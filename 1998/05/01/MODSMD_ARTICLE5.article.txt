# Faculty Senate looks at progress of diversifying faculty
## Hiring concerns discussed 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Gains in minority hiring have been "continuous but
slight, slow but steady." according to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Hob Weisberg.
The annual report on professorial gains and losses,
the subject of much tit yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting, was greeted with limited approbation bv the
senators.

Junior faculty has shrunk by 50 members
in the last 10 years, and I don't think that's
a terribly good trend.'
— John Shoven

"We would like to go faster [in hiring minority fac
ulty]. but we all recognize the real-world constraints."
Weisberg said.
The University has hired 13 new minority profes
sors in the last year and 122 in the last 10 years.
"The available pool, or pipeline, is a major deter

minant of who v\e hire, but it isn't an
absolute determinant and can't be
used as an excuse." Weisberg said.
Provost Condolee/za Rice em
ph r i/.ed looking for faculty mem
bers. especially minority faculty
members, outside the traditional hir
ing lanes.
"I worry about the same names

moving around the chessboard, she said. Before I
became provost. I would get a call every six months
from some university that only wanted me after Stan
ford had vetted me. and an\ minont\ professor can
tell you the same story "
Another concern voiced b\ members ol the senate
was the decreasing proportion of non-tenured faculty
"Junior faculty has shrunk b\ 50 members in the
last 10 years, and 1 don't think that's a terribly good
trend." said Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven.
Although the number of professors has remained


Rice
relatively stable in the past 10
years, the number of non-tenured
faculty has decreased from 311 to
261.
The senate tabled discussion of
professorial gains and losses
among women until its May 14
meeting, which will focus on issues
of gender in the professoriate.

What is necessary is for
us to push our culture
against the perception
that the best researchers
are those who ignore their
teaching.'
— Cecilia Ridgeway

The senate also discussed the
long-term direction and interests
of tenured faculty. The Planning
and Policy Board suggested a peri
odic review for senior faculty, in
cluding an examination of their re
search, teaching and service priori
ties.
"We're trying to create some
thing that is not a problem-solving
device but an opportunity-creating
device," said History Prof. David
Kennedy, chair of the board. "We
certainly don't mean this as a dead
wood detector."
The report also suggested the

prioritizing of teaching and ser
vice, which many senators assert is
currently seen as less important
than research.
"If you come out of the Dean's
Office and say, 'I get to teach fewer
courses in the next five years and
do more research,' people would
say, 'great', but if you come out
saying, 'I get to do less research
and teach an extra class,' people
say, 'What?' " said Philosophy
Prof. John Perry.
The board's report suggests in
centives for professors who con
centrate on teaching, possibly in
cluding extra funds or a "distin
guished professor" title.
"What is necessary is for us to
push our culture against the per
ception that the best researchers
are those who ignore their teach
ing," said Sociology Prof. Cecilia
Ridgeway.
Some faculty members object
ed. however, to an attempt to em
phasize teaching over research.
"I appreciate the incentive this
program would provide for those
who take overactive teaching
roles, but what about those who
take overactive research roles?"
asked Assoc. Dean of Research
Craig Heller.
The senators concurred, howev
er, that a periodic faculty review
would benefit all individuals in
volved.
"Accountability is something
we all agree that we have to add to
the post-tenure stage somewhere
or another," Ridgeway said.
