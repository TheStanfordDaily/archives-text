With hopes of attracting a larg
er crowd and creating a festive out
door atmosphere, planners of
Rinc-A-Delt '4N decided \esterda\
to move the event to Wilbur Field

The day and time. Sunday at 1
p.m., have not changed. Neither
have the performers. The annual
musical event will feature Train,
the E.B. Fralev Band. I'he Basics
and Brando.
"We're expecting a lot more
people to come, cruise around and
have some good fun in the sun."
said Rinc-A-Delt co-chair lim
Springer. "It's going to be a very
solid benefit concert."
The day-long showcase of bands
organized every spring by Rin
conada. an all-freshman dormito
ry. is a charity benefit this year lor
the Ecumenical Hunger Program,
which feeds impoverished families

in East Palo Alto.
The event was originally slated
to be in Frost Amphitheater, with

We're expecting a lot
more people to come,
cruise around and have
some good fun in the sun.'

Rinc-A-Dclt co-chair Doug
Alev said the change came after
the week's ticket sales for the event
were not on par with the organiz
ers' expectations.
Alev said the Rinc-A-Delt com
mittee had hoped to sell about
1,000 tickets by the end ot yester
day hut only sold 2(H).
"We hadn't sold as many tickets
as we had wanted to by today, so
we decided to move (the event) to

V\ ilbur Field to get more people to
come." A ley said.
The committee hopes the
change of venue will allow the ad
dition of "really cool events
around Wilbur Field [such as) vol
leyball. Slip 'n' Slide and a carni
val-type atmosphere." Aley said.
"It's going to be a really tun
event, and people are going to hear
some great music for free." he
added.
Students who have already pur
chased tickets can receive refunds
at the event on Sunday Those who
purchased tickets through Bass or
the Tresidder Ticket Office can get
refunds at the point of sale.
The elimination of an entrance
fee will not preclude Rinc-A-Delt
from contributing to the Ecumeni
cal Hunger Program as planned.
I he hunger program will have a
barbecue booth at the event and
will keep all profits. In addition,
