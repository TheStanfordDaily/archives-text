### Ann Kim Staff writer 
With hopes of attracting a larg
er crowd and creating a festive out
door atmosphere, planners of
Rinc-A-Delt '4N decided \esterda\
to move the event to Wilbur Field
and offer free admission.
The day and time. Sunday at 1
p.m., have not changed. Neither
have the performers. The annual
musical event will feature Train,
the E.B. Fralev Band. I'he Basics
and Brando.
"We're expecting a lot more
people to come, cruise around and
have some good fun in the sun."
said Rinc-A-Delt co-chair lim
Springer. "It's going to be a very
solid benefit concert."
The day-long showcase of bands
organized every spring by Rin
conada. an all-freshman dormito
ry. is a charity benefit this year lor
the Ecumenical Hunger Program,
which feeds impoverished families

in East Palo Alto.
The event was originally slated
to be in Frost Amphitheater, with
tickets priced at $13 for general ad
mission and $6 for students

We're expecting a lot
more people to come,
cruise around and have
some good fun in the sun.'

Rinc-A-Dclt co-chair Doug
Alev said the change came after
the week's ticket sales for the event
were not on par with the organiz
ers' expectations.
Alev said the Rinc-A-Delt com
mittee had hoped to sell about
1,000 tickets by the end ot yester
day hut only sold 2(H).
"We hadn't sold as many tickets
as we had wanted to by today, so
we decided to move (the event) to

V\ ilbur Field to get more people to
come." A ley said.
The committee hopes the
change of venue will allow the ad
dition of "really cool events
around Wilbur Field [such as) vol
leyball. Slip 'n' Slide and a carni
val-type atmosphere." Aley said.
"It's going to be a really tun
event, and people are going to hear
some great music for free." he
added.
Students who have already pur
chased tickets can receive refunds
at the event on Sunday Those who
purchased tickets through Bass or
the Tresidder Ticket Office can get
refunds at the point of sale.
The elimination of an entrance
fee will not preclude Rinc-A-Delt
from contributing to the Ecumeni
cal Hunger Program as planned.
I he hunger program will have a
barbecue booth at the event and
will keep all profits. In addition,
Rinc-A-Delt will make a contribu
tion to the hunger program with
funds contributed to the event by
its corporate sponsors.
These sponsors include One
Zero Media Inc., a Cambridge,
Mass.-based company that pro
duces a syndicated show for CBS
television, and Flegel's Home Fur
nishings of Menlo Park.

Attendees who bring nonper
ishable, canned food items to the
music show will receive a free raffle
ticket for "cool stuff," Aley said.
Rinc-A-Delt co-chair Brent Ja
cobsen pointed out that the event's
contribution to a charity organiza
tion — achieved without charging
entrance fees — will allow all par
ties to benefit.
Atlantic Records will be at Rinc-
A-Delt giving away free posters and
compact discs. Round Table Pizza
will be selling food as well.
