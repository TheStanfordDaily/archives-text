# Music Department performing opera
## 
### Brittney Jensen 
For the first time in over a decade,
Stanford's Department of Music will
stage a full-length opera. Stanford
students perform the principle roles
in "Dido and Aeneas," playing this
weekend at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
" 'Dido and Aeneas' is ideal for
someone new to opera," said direc
tor Jennifer Lane, a senior lecturer in
voice. "The plot is interesting and
easy to follow." The opera is in Eng
lish and about an hour long.
Henry Purcell wrote the opera in
1689 for "young gentlewomen" at a
boarding school in London. This pro
duction recreates the baroque period
with extravagant sets and costumes.
Professionals and Stanford facul
ty members make up the 30-person
production staff, which includes a
wig master and baroque gesture
coaches.
Costume designer Bonnie
kruger, from Washington Universi
ty, is bringing in more than 60 period
costumes from previous productions
she's designed. The costumes would
cost $2.IXX) to $3.(XK) to build from
scratch.
The sets are based on the only in
tact baroque opera house in the
world, the Castle Theater at Czeskv
Krumlov in the Czech Republic.
Stanford students and Drama De
partment faculty members, under
the guidance of Stephanie Felton,
constructed the backdrops and flats
of Greek columns and disappearing
ships.

Lane brings extensive opera
background to her directing debut. A
mezzo-soprano, she has performed
extensively throughout the United
States and Europe and has recorded
the role of Dido twice on compact
disc.
The libretto is based on Virgil's
"Aenied." Freshman Kate Hogan
plays Dido, whose abandonment by
Aeneas leads her to suicide.
The story is interspersed with live
ly choruses and dances. Supporting
the nine student-performed principle
roles are the Stanford Early Music
Singers, Chamber Chorale and
Chamber Orchestra.
Period-style dances will be per
formed by the Side River Dance En
semble, a California baroque dance
group under the direction of Linda
Tomko, co-director of the Stanford
Baroque Dance Workshop.
Starring in the opera are Hogan as
Dido, Mark Tendall as Aeneas. Liz
Weisberg as Belinda, Liz Horn as the
Second Woman. Michelle Geoffrion
as the Sorceress, Julia Ulehla as Mer
cury, Jack Yu as the Sailor and Jenn
Pfotenhauer and Joanna Dickler as
Witches.
