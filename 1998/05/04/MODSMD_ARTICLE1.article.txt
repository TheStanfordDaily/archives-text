# Not going quietly
## Taxis protest Wais 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Theta Xi fraternity members are
now protesting the loss of their
house, but the University is standing
by its decision to dehouse the frater
nity for not meeting its residency re
quirement.
Last Tuesday, Dean of Students
Marc Wais announced on behalf of
the Office of Student Activities and
the Office of Residential Education
that the Taxis would lose their house
for the upcoming school year. The
Taxis were four members short of
meeting their 29-member housing re
quirement, according to Taxi Presi
dent Jeff McCarty. a senior.
"It is my belief that we have done
everything possible to have Taxi suc
cessfully meet the minimum residen
cy requirement," Wais said.
The fraternity disagreed. On Fri
day, Taxi members began to actively
protest the housing decision.
"We didn't feel we had any op
tions, but several [fraternity] meet
ings later, we came to the group con
sensus that we were being screwed
and we deserved another chance,"

explained McCarty.
The fraternity members claim
they deserved a short extension to get
new pledges, due to extenuating cir
cumstances. Six members, or approx
imately one-third, of its pledge class
de-pledged on Monday, just days
after Greek housing information was
due. This brought the fraternity
down to 12 pledges.
Fraternity members say they
asked Wais for 48 hours —just until
today — to get new pledges.
"All we really want is a fair
chance," McCarty said. "We feel if
we had some more time, we could
line up four or five more people to
live in the house next year."
A group of Taxi members met
with Wais early Friday morning to
discuss getting more time to recruit
members.
In response, Wais met with repre
sentatives of the Office of Student
Activities, Residential Education
and Housing Assignment Services
the same day to discuss giving the fra
ternity more time to fulfill its mem
bership requirement. Later that day.
he informed the fraternity that he
would not grant an extension.
"We've been really accommodat
ing for three years running," Wais ex
plained. 'T can't assume responsibili
ty for their inability to generate and
maintain membership."
Wais said the fraternity has failed
to meet its membership requirement
for the last three years.
However, Taxi members say the
fraternity actually met the 90-percent
requirement last year. The Universi
ty failed to count one member who
was overseas, according to McCarty.
Some Taxi members cited the
housing crunch as a potential reason
for the loss of their house.
"We have Greeks living on a cam

pus with a tight housing situation, and
housing is at a premium." Wais said.
However, he was quick to add the
housing crunch "had absolutely no
bearing on the issue."
Focusing on the Taxis' failure to
meet its membership requirement,
Wais said they should "have recruit
ed more members to create a greater
buffer."
Sophomore Nik Charov. one of
this year's Rush chairs, responded
that recruiting more would not have
been practical. "If we had any more
than the 100-percent requirement,
we'd have to force some members to
live outside the house," he said.
One thing that both Wais and
Taxis can agree on is the high level of
alumni and active member protest to
the Taxis losing their house.
Living in the same house since
1914. the Taxis are the longest-run

ning housed fraternity on campus,
McCartv said.
"We've been inundated with
phone calls and e-mails from actives,
parents of actives, and alumni." Wais
reported. Even the governor of Neva
da has given a call to the University.
However. Wais said the response
will not influence the decision; in
stead. he encouraged alumni to get
involved in a different way. "We
hope the alumni will group with the
active membership to help them in
their transition to being an unhoused
fraternity," Wais said.
Taxis have other ideas. "We're
going to continue what we're doing
until we either get the house back or
they forcibly throw us off campus."
Charov said.
The Taxis are currently working
to round up more members, but ac
cording to Charov, it is difficult oven

the housing situation. "It's tough to
get a clear answer from potential
pledges because there are uncertain
ties on both sides." Charov said.
However, he is hopeful that they
will still have at least four new pledges
by today.
Other Taxi members are not so
positive about the future and are
even talking about disbanding the
fraternity. "Some guys would rather
have the fraternity disband than not
have a house." said junior Ross Miller.
Wais. nonethless. continues to
emphasize that this year was a time of
growth for the Stanford Greek com
munity. "The fact is that we have two
previously housed fraternities — the
Kappa Alphas and the Dekes — w ho
will be resuming occupancy of their
previous housing in September IWB
in addition to the Thetas and the Tri
Delts receiving new houses," Wais said.
