# Not going quietly
## Taxis protest Wais 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Theta Xi fraternity members are
now protesting the loss of their
house, but the University is standing
by its decision to dehouse the frater
nity for not meeting its residency re
quirement.
Last Tuesday, Dean of Students
Marc Wais announced on behalf of
the Office of Student Activities and
the Office of Residential Education
that the Taxis would lose their house
for the upcoming school year. The
Taxis were four members short of
meeting their 29-member housing re
quirement, according to Taxi Presi
dent Jeff McCarty. a senior.
"It is my belief that we have done
everything possible to have Taxi suc
cessfully meet the minimum residen
cy requirement," Wais said.
The fraternity disagreed. On Fri
day, Taxi members began to actively
protest the housing decision.
"We didn't feel we had any op
tions, but several [fraternity] meet
ings later, we came to the group con
sensus that we were being screwed
and we deserved another chance,"

explained McCarty.
The fraternity members claim
they deserved a short extension to get
new pledges, due to extenuating cir
cumstances. Six members, or approx
imately one-third, of its pledge class
de-pledged on Monday, just days
after Greek housing information was
due. This brought the fraternity
down to 12 pledges.
Fraternity members say they
asked Wais for 48 hours —just until
today — to get new pledges.
"All we really want is a fair
chance," McCarty said. "We feel if
we had some more time, we could
line up four or five more people to
live in the house next year."
A group of Taxi members met
with Wais early Friday morning to
discuss getting more time to recruit
members.
In response, Wais met with repre
sentatives of the Office of Student
Activities, Residential Education
and Housing Assignment Services
the same day to discuss giving the fra
ternity more time to fulfill its mem
bership requirement. Later that day.
