## 
### Sonya Schneider Contributing writer 
Friday night the Coffee House
was packed with people and laughter;
"Comedy of Color," featuring stand
up comedy by comedians of different
ethnic backgrounds, officially kicked
off the campus Asian Pacific Islander
Heritage Month that will run
throughout May.
Sponsored by Okada — the Asian
American theme house — and the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, the month is an opportunity to
educate all Stanford students about
the diverse cultures and issues specif
ic to the Asian-American communi
ty.
AIM Heritage Month began in the
1 with a single speaker series. In
the past three years, the number and

variety of events has greatly in
creased. Roughly one-fourth of the
Stanford student body is Asian
American. According to Nadinne
Cruz, resident fellow of Okada
House, the support for the events in
creases as the student groups on cam
pus multiply.
"Every year, API Month keeps
getting to be more of a collaborative
event — more consultative across dif
ferent groups," Cruz said.
Along with A ASA and Okada,
whose staff Cruz calls "the stars of the
event,"the month is organized by
various Asian-American groups on
campus. It also feature events put on
by Asian Americans outside of the
Stanford community, including
prominent authors, dancers and pan
elists. This will include AASA's pre
sentation of "Asian Images" on May

11 and "Extravaganza" on May 22.
Cruz also pointed out that as the
Asian Pacific Islanders community
increases in representation, it is evi
dent that students within the commu
nity are not aware of the cultures that
make up the diverse population.
"Not only is this month an oppor
tunity for Asian American students
to take leadership and make connec
tions with the outside world," Cruz
said, "it is important because it pro
vides people within the API commu
nity a chance to learn about each
other."
Jenny Kim, a senior and treasurer
of Hwimori, a Korean American cul
tural activist group, called the event
"the month when we learn the most
about other API groups."
For Jane Kim. a junior and resi
dent assistant of Okada. organizing

this month has been challenging but
worthwhile. Kim, who chaired
AASA last year, is dedicating this
year to making API Heritage Month
possible.
"The RAs and residents have
been planning since December," she
said. "Things have gone really well.
We have raised almost $IS,(XX) for
this year."
Okada, which puts together the
calendar for the month, hosted
"Comedy of Color" and now looks
forward to putting on the renowned
"Da Hype." a showcase featuring
world champion mixologists and hip
hop performers in Wilbur Courtyard
on May 30.
"All of the fund raising really
helps us realize our goal," Kim said.
"The money lets us advertise off cam
pus. and 'Da Hype' brings people

from all over." In the past it has at
tracted disc jockeys from New York
and L.os Angeles.
Jane Kim said of the specific
theme of this year's API Heritage
Month: "We chose 'Standing on the
Shoulders of Those Who Struggled

Before Us So We Could Be Where
We Are Today' to remind ourselves
that the present is impossible without
understanding our heritage.
'Without realizing the past as uur
foundation, we won't be able to know
where we're going," Kim said.
