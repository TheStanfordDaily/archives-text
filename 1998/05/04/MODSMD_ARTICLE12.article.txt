## Scientists continuing brain research Shuttle returns 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla.
(AP) â€” Space shuttle Columbia
and its crew returned to Earth yes
terday, ending two weeks of lab
work that advanced brain research
despite unexpected animal casual
ties. And the experiments were far
from over.
Within an hour, the crew was
hustled off to medical tests that
were expected to go on for days.
Six of the seven astronauts left on
stretchers; doctors wanted them
reclining to preserve their weight
less state.
At the same time, NASA
rushed to unload the animals so sci
entists could begin dissecting the
few dozen surviving baby rats, as
well as the nearly 2,(MH) fish, snails,
crickets and older rodents that
flew. Most of the young rats died in
orbit, victims of maternal neglect.
It was a race against gravity: the
sooner the astronauts and animals
could be examined, the greater the
likelihood of observing space
induced changes in the nervous
system.
"I'm sitting here like a little kid
with ants in my pants," said Gay
Holstein, a Mount Sinai School of
Medicine researcher whose rats
flew on Columbia. "I can't wait to
get going on my experiment."
To everyone's relief. Columbia
landed right on time at the
Kennedy Space Center, where
about 2(H) researchers waited with
scalpels.
Commander Richard Searfoss
had only two functioning
hydraulic power units for most of
the hourlong descent. The cooling
system for the third unit failed to
work Saturday; Searfoss turned

that unit on just minutes before
touchdown so it would not over
heat.
As soon as Columbia rolled to
a safe stop. Mission Control con
gratulated the astronauts for "a
historic mission that elevated neu
roscience research to record
heights."
Among the space firsts
achieved during the 16-day Neuro
lab flight: first direct nerve record
ings, first joint recording of sleep
and breathing, first embalming of
animals, and first surgery on ani
mals meant to survive.
"The data obtained are really a
precious resource that will help us
to unlock some of the mysteries of
the brain," said NASA program
scientist Mary Anne Frey.
Only the rodent researchers
knew for sure what they were get
ting back.
The astronauts kept close
watch on the 170 rodents that
rocketed into orbit with them on
April 17, especially when the baby
rats started dying. The surrogate
mother rats could not or would
not nurse the young animals in
space. Although 55 of the % baby
rats died prematurely, researchers
hoped they still could achieve
their primary objectives.
Because the containers for the
fish, snails and crickets were inac
cessible aboard Columbia, the
astronauts did not know how
those animals fared in weightless
ness.
A quick inspection after land
ing. however, revealed that only
25 of 225 baby swordtail fish sur
vived the mission, a much higher
mortality rate than expected.
