# Real Quiet takes Kentucky Derby crown

LOUISVILLE, Kv. (AP)
Trainer Bob Baffert could be fol
lowing the path taken by D. Wayne
Lukas in winning the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness three years
ago.
The Baffert-trained Real Ouiet
won the Derby on Saturday, while
his favored stablemate Indian
Charlie finished third.
In 1995, Lukas won the Derby
with outsider Thunder Gulch and
finished third with favored Timber
Country. Then Timber Country
won and Thunder Gulch finished
third in the Preakness.
Such a switch between Real
Ouiet and Indian Charlie would not
be out of the question, and the two
colts appeared headed for the
Preakness on May 16 at Pimlico in
Baltimore.
"Right now I would say yes."
Baffert said yesterday following his
second consecutive Derby victory.

He won last year with Silver
Charm, and he has a remarkable
record of two wins, a second and a
third in only three Derbies.
Just like Thunder Gulch. Real
Quiet toiled in the shadow of a sta
blemate â€” until Saturday.
Kent Desormeaux put Real
Ouiet on the lead at the quarter
pole, and the colt held on for a half
length win over Victory Gallop,
who had been next-to-last in the 15-
horse field with a half-mile remain
ing.
"You want to be in front at the
eighth pole and then just stagger
home, and that's what he did." Baf
fert said.
The previously unbeaten Indian
Charlie, racing for only the fifth
time in his career, was second with
an eighth-mile remaining, but he
couldn't hold off Victory Gallop,
who finished 2 1/4 lengths in front
of him.
