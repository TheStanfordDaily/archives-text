Web page and search engine
ease some of the pain of
buying at the Bookstore

SICK OF STANDING in lines to
locate and purchase texts
required for your courses? The
Bookstore's online search engine,
which has been in place for several
months, has been a much-welcomed
contribution to improving its service to
Stanford students and faculty.
High prices and long lines define
most students' experiences with the
Bookstore. This gives it a reputation
for being unaccommodating to stu
dents' needs. We applaud the store's
efforts to respond to its critics with
thoughtful and decisive action.
The store's user-friendly World
Wide Web site located at http://book
store/index.html allows students to
find the price and availability of mate
rials required for courses. They can
also locate general interest books.
The "Textbook Search Engine"
provides clear instructions on how to
select an academic department. It then
asks the user to select his or her course
within each department. The result of
this query is a display of the texts
required for the selected course. The
number of used books available is also
listed. This display may be printed for

use when students shop for their books,
cutting down on shopping time.
Faculty can benefit from this site by
ordering their course materials online.
This cuts down on potential communi
cation errors and saves faculty mem
bers' time.
The store's "Advanced General
Books Search Engine" also provides
users the ability to locate books other
than textbooks. Using this engine pro
duces a readout featuring the title of
the selected work, author's name,
price, and other helpful information
for tracking the book down such as the
publisher, shelving category and loca
tion in the store itself.
Users can also leave their name, e
mail, phone number and mailing
address to place any title on hold. The
store will supply ordering and shipping
information for titles not in stock and
respond to inquiries for titles not
found in their database.
These features will hopefully cut
down on long lines when students buy
their course materials at the beginning
of each quarter. While shopping for
books isn't an enjoyable experience,
the Bookstore has made welcome
attempts to make the process as pain
less as possible.
Hopefully, as other campus institu
tions and enterprises appraise their
effectiveness in meeting student needs,
they will consider and act upon stu
dent response.
