## An anniversary not to celebrate 
### 
Last week, peo
ple joyously cele
brated the 50th
anniversary of the found
ing of Israel. 1 am not
enthusiastic about this
birthday, and am uncom
fortable celebrating a day

that represents pain, ter
ror and hardship for so many people,
including Jews. After 50 years, I wonder if
we can consider Israel a success story.
Israel was founded! out of Western guilt
as a facile way to remove Jews from Europe
and North America by confining them to
territory in the Middle East. In looking to
create a Jewish state, the United Nations
considered several sites, including Uganda.
The fact that it looked to Uganda, and not
anywhere in the industrialized world, sug
gests that the creation of Israel was a quick
way to appease a community that had been
persecuted for centuries.
Once again, Britain and the United
States played a colonial role in making
amends to Jews, without thinking about the
enormous ramifications their decisions
would have. In trying to redress one group's
oppression, they abused and violated
another group. This is part of the legacy of
Western colonialism and imperialism.
The creation of Israel came after the
Holocaust, an event in which Jews suffered
one of the most significant losses in human
history. However, the Holocaust did not

only affect Jews. Five million non-Jews
including gypsies, gays, disabled people,
blacks and Christians were also killed.
The Holocaust was a manifestation of
hatred against people who did not fit Nazi
Germany's notion of "perfection." I raise
this point not to overlook the historical
specificity of Jewish persecution, but to
encourage thought about shared injustice.
While Jews had promised never to allow
another Holocaust, 1 am disheartened by
their relative silence during genocide in
Rwanda, Bosnia and elsewhere. The Jewish
experience could be used effectively to
bring world attention to similar massacres
that continue to occur.
Creating a place for Jews displaced
Palestinians who have lived on that land for
centuries. With support from the U.S. gov
ernment and the Jewish lobby in Washing
ton D.C., Israel has gained more land,
power and legitimacy than it began with.
Palestinians cannot resist an Israeli state
that is supported by wealthy foreign gov
ernments.
In celebrating Israel's birthday, it is
important to look at the exclusions and
oppressions that are involved in creating
any nation. No place is homogenous and
every nation contains disenfranchised peo
ple. For example, many countries were cre
ated through European colonialism, which
overlooked indigenous populations in the
Americas, Asia and Africa.
How successful has Israel been? Thou

sands of Jews and Palestinians have been
killed in the five wars that have occurred
since Israel was founded. National borders
are still contested, and Palestinians do not
have sufficient land or autonomy. Most
Jews are still in the Diaspora. Most have no
intention of returning to their homeland.
Even for the Jews who have moved to
Israel, the situation has been less than ideal.
In a European-Jewish dominated govern
ment. Ethiopian and Russian immigrants
are having a difficult time assimilating, as
are Sephardic and Arab Jews. Many Jews
have not found comfort in the country that
was formed as a refuge for the displaced.
It is important to understand history
from multiple viewpoints, but we cannot
continue to argue about the past. 1 await a
peace agreement between Israel and Pales
tine. I only hope that the Jews, who have
more economic and political power and
international support, are fair in their treat
ment of the Palestinians. I hope that the
Jews remember how only 50 years ago, they
too were in a similar situation. I hope this
time, the correct decision is made.
My opinions could be incorrectly dis
missed as anti-Semitism. However, I urge
you to consider my perspective and chal
lenge your own views on Israel, 50 years
later.
