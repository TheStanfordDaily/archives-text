Friday's cartoon did not
deserve to be published
Imagine if you had a cartoon repre
senting a hook-nosed Jew, a flat-nosed
African and a slant-eved Asian submitted
to you. You would reject these immedi
ately, I hope, as offensive and unenlight
ened stereotypes. But somehow it is OK
to portray the Ku Klux Klan as the typical
readers of The Stanford Review. I have
been mocked and misquoted by The Stan
ford Review as often as anyone on this
campus, though perhaps not as often as
The Daily. I have never hesitated to criti
cize The Review, at times harshly, but I
have never ascribed to its writers the ideas
of the KKK, even in its most degraded
days.
Recent issues of The Review have been
calm and cerebral, compared to its more
distant immature past. Nothing has even
remotely warranted this cartoon.
How does Friday's cartoon add to the
intelligent discourse of the editorial page
of your edition, with its otherwise reason
able commentary? I know it's just a car
toon, not a think piece, and the staff of
The Review should be able to take some
heat as well as dish it out. But this isn't
even vaguely thoughtful. Is it funny?
Provocative? Interesting?
No. it is just stupid and offensive. The
Daily should know better. Were you all
asleep at the switch? Was there just too
much blank space asking to be filled? Did

not at least one of you have a little twinge
of conscience suggesting this was a bad
idea? Yet you went ahead and published
it. You owe us all. not just The Review, an
apology. Stay out of the gutter. You could
get dirty.

Don't disrespect Review
I am writing you concerning the igno
rant. disrespectful cartoon you printed in
Friday's newspaper. While I myself do not
agree with many of the views printed in
The Stanford Review, associating The
Review with the Ku Klux Klan is abso
lutely outrageous. I find it hard to believe
that if you actually read the Review, you
could have misinterpreted their opinions
so terribly.
