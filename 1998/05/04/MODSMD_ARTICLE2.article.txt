When Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich spoke at Hoover In
stitution on Friday, he promised his
speech would be "risky."
The riskiest position in the
room, however, was that of any De
mocrats present.
To warm applause by the audi
ence, Gingrich, a Republican from
Georgia, skewered the Democratic
Party for its big-government phi
losophy.
"Our friends on the left believe
in slogans over science, in a high
tax redistributional society, which
takes money from those who earn
it and gives it to those who, in many
cases, did nothing to deserve it,"he
said.
Gingrich also criticized Presi
dent Clinton, who was also in the
area this weekend, for his alleged
illegal behavior, saying that "no
one is above the law, even the pres
ident."
According to Gingrich, the

country as a whole is predominant
ly conservative but is misrepresent
ed and misinformed by university
professors and by the media.
"There is no question that an
amazing percentage of tenured fac
ulty have no idea of the way the
world works, and the news media is
the same way," Gingrich said.
"The truth is that they're a not
very-important small group of
three million people who read The
New York Times editorials and
watch the Sunday talk shows and
think that that's the way things
are."
Gingrich put forth an eight
stage model of planning and lead
ership that he uses as a format for
making decisions.
The first four stages are the
preparation levels.
"To efficiently run a large sys
tem, you must begin with a vision,
then continue with strategy," he
said.
"The third level is projects.
which are attainable, delegatable
achievements, and then come tac
tics."
After those are completed, Gin
grich proposes four levels of lead
ership.
"The first thing is to listen be
cause in the Information Age, if
leaders don't listen, they're already
obsolete. Then comes learning,
helping and leading."
It is using this model, Gingrich
asserted, that the Republicans

have been able to effectively lead
in Congress.
"Any management team in the
world that moved their business
from a $225-billion projected
deficit to a surplus in four years
would be on the cover of Fortune
Magazine," he said.
Gingrich spent much of his
speech concentrating on the "vi
sion" of his plan.
"We want to establish that in a
peacetime society, if you work all
of Monday and half of Tuesday to
pay taxes, then that's enough." he
said.
"No one should have to pay

more than 25 percent of their in
come in taxes."
Gingrich proposed replacing
the current income tax with either
a flat tax or a sales tax.
"We can't do it until we get a
Republican president because
Clinton or Gore would demagogue
it into the ground." he said.
Gingrich came to Hoover as
part of the Hoover Forum Lun
cheon Series, a regular series that
brings public figures from around
the world to speak at the institu
tion.
The speech was open by invita
tion onlv.
