## Rethinking an archaic system of tenure 
### 
Alda Leu

WOMEN AND MINORITIES
are simply less intelligent than
white males.
After decades of affirmative action for
undergraduate admissions, graduate work
and even tenure-track academic positions,
it's time that women and minorities in
academia take that last step toward suc
cess by, earning their own tenure.
If after all of that "help," the underrep
resented cannot manage to earn tenure by
their own merit, maybe they don't deserve
it.
What else could it be?
The continued existence of a huge gen
der and racial disparity among faculty and
tenured professors at Stanford must have
a cause.
Before condemning all women and
minorities as genetically inferior, it may be
prudent to explore other reasons and work
to counteract those forces. I have some
suggestions — sexism, racism, inadequate
support, an archaic system...
The controversy surrounding the
tenure denials of former Asst. Anthropol
ogy Prof. Akhil Gupta and Asst. History
Prof. Karen Sawislak have caused ripples
of furor around campus. Central to the

debates has been the question of the value
of affirmative action in the tenure process.
To be fair, tenure is nothing to be taken
lightly. It offers lifetime job security, pro
tection from employer backlash for
expressing unfavorable ideas, and is
reserved for scholars at the top of their
fields.
The University sends letters to aca
demics at other institutions asking them to
rank the scholarship of the tenure candi
date among his/her peers. If the person
does not consistently rank first or second,
then he or she is deemed not worthy of
tenure.
The scholars must be outstanding and
recognized for their talent, and to be rec
ognized. the academic must be published.
A lot.
This being said, we must ask ourselves:
Is having more minorities and women in
tenured positions at Stanford a worthy
goal? Why has the current system failed to
provide this? How can these failures be
improved on? Where does the student
voice come into play?
Students and academics can benefit
from having a diverse, broader perspective
on issues whether it be history, physics or

economics. Students can discover role
models and mentors similar to themselves;
academics can interact with other types of
individuals and accept them as equals.
The effect would be a more balanced
University, which translates ultimately
into a more diverse intellectual elite and a
more balanced society.
If you have teachers whom you can
look up to, then you have better advisers
and more motivation and inspiration to
achieve.
According to a report issued by the
Women's Coalition for Gender Equity,
women represent 50 percent of the under
graduate population, but only 30 percent
of graduate students, 17 percent of all fac
ulty and 13.3 percent of tenured faculty.
The Stanford Report noted that blacks
represent 2.5 percent. Latinos 2.76 percent
and Asians 8.27 percent of faculty.
Maybe the University is not doing
enough either to promote academia as a
career choice or to retain women and
minorities.
Salary discrepancies still persist
between men and women. Women make
less than their male counterparts. The
American Association of University Pro

fessors in 19% determined the average
salary of full professors to he $K.(KK) less
for women.
Subtle raeism and sexism also continue
to exist due to ideals embedded in white
male institutions. These ideals may not
value feminist literature, black history or
new areas of focus as worthwhile areas of
scholarship. These intellectual biases are
self-perpetuated by a group of academics
which in and of itself lacks diversity.
Additionally, professors, in general,
complain of inadequate support for teach
ing, administration, advising, research and
writing.
Professors in the humanities are not
equipped with assistants or secretaries to
cope with the workload. One can easily
imagine a scenario where scarce minority
advisers are in high demand for advising
and are thus overtaxed.
Furthermore, women, more often than
men, must balance these jobs with family
pressures. Although maternity leave adds
time to the tenure clock by one to two
years, the burden of full-time parenthood
is not taken into consideration in the equa
tion.
Perhaps the institution of tenure is

itself outdated and unproductive: in eco
nomic terms, the tenure system does not
make much sense. Offering a lifelong job
does not provide incentives to produce
once tenure is attained. Likewise, basing
tenure on research does not improve the
level of teaching and advising. However,
since there are many professors who have
obtained tenure, the job protection they
are afforded should encourage them to air
their grievances.
After all. they are the ones who are
here to stay. Why does the faculty allow
itself to be an institution that so poorly
embodies equality and diversity?
The University can work toward pro
moting academic professions tor women
and minorities It can create an environ
ment that is both welcoming and support
ive of research, and then modify the
tenure systen o value the other aspect of
being a distll. ;uished faculty member —
teaching.
Only then can it be determined
whether or not women and minorities are
just "empirically" intellectually inferior.
