## In the dugout, it's a strange brew Rally caps, jackets, songs work to spice up the Cardinal's clubhouse 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
The sounds comifigTrom the dugout are a
hit disturbing. An a cappella group gone
bad.
They may be dressed in matching base
ball jerseys, but not many are confusing this
crew with the Stanford Mendicants. One is
beating his chest, another clapping his
hands; a third is trying to spit a bassline beat
out of the side of his mouth.
This group, however, does not go by the
name of "Everyday Pitchers" or "Rallv
men." They do not give many concerts and
have not spent much time working on har
monies. The only record these guys have is a
winning one.
This is no ordinary college baseball team,
and Chad Hutchinson is not your ordinary
pitcher. Despite going eight innings Satur
day to earn his ninth win of the season.
Hutchinson does more than just pitch to as
sure his team victories. On the days when he

is not on the mound, the two-sport star still
plays a role in the games, granted a bizarre
one.
"We all started getting into it my fresh
man year." he said. "We have the rally space
jackets, the rally muscle jackets, rally drags
and the rally rhythmic beat."
It's a tossup as to which is more enter
taining — watching Hutchinson on the
mound or watching Hutchinson in front of
the dugout, cheering on his teammates at the
plate.
"I'm goofy, but I'm not really supersti
tious," Hutchinson said.
"Chad!" yells a group of kids after his vic
tory Saturday. "ChAAAAAd!"
"These kids," he says with a sheepish grin
after turning around to wave. "Can't they
see I'm busy," he chuckles.
The thing is, Hutchinson has not gotten
used to the popularity. He doesn't think of
himself as the same star the kids are anx
iously waiting around for. Rather, "Hutch"
is one of them, a kid running amok in his

playground, the dugout. He won't leave the
kids there, screaming his name, without talk
ing or playing with them for a bit.
"With the rally muscle jackets. we use all
the muscle groups," he explained. Pushing
the sleeves high up their arms. Hutchinson
and his crew flex in multiple positions to in
spire the hitter. If that doesn't work, he
might resort to the "rally space jackets" in
which the Cardinal warmup jackets are
worn inside out. or even the "rally drags."
"Sometimes they will pose, sometimes
they will cage someone up," Hutchinson
said of the fifth-inning sweep of the infield
with rakes and cages by the Cardinal players.
"Once, they did the Iwo Jima Memorial"
pose.
Only at Stanford.
"The "soundfest thing." as Hutchinson
describes it. is a combination of different
sounds dedicated to getting a rally going.
And as the Cardinal approaches postseason
play and dreams of the 1998 College World
Series, the beat goes on.

Stanford junior ace Jeff Austin hurled his seventh complete game of the year in the Cardinal's 5-4 win over Arizona State in
