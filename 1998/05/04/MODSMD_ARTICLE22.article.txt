### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
Stanford's track athletes had a
chance to force the California track
squads into submission Saturday at
the 105th annual Big Meet. The
women were able to defend their
Big Meet title, but despite gutsy per
formances. the men were unable to
repeat last year's success.

TRACK AND FIELD
■ Saturday: WOMEN — Stanford
113, California 50. MEN — Cal 92.
Stanford 71.

The Stanford women dominated
the meet throughout, taking individ
ual wins in 13 of the 19 events. The
women more than doubled Cal's
score, winning 113-50 and gaining a
one-win advantage in the series his
tory. 10-9.
The men's performances were
equally formidable. The distance
crew gathered 35 of the possible 36
points in their events and the throw
ers captured 19 of a possible 36. But
sweeps by Cal in the 1 10-meter hur
dles, the relays and all of the hori
zontal jumping events dealt a devas
tating blow to the Cardinal cause.

The men lost by a final score of 92-
71.
Head coach Vin Lananna was
nevertheless pleased with the efforts
from both squads.
"The women just dominated the
meet all the way around," Lananna
said.
