## 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
Stanford's track athletes had a
chance to force the California track
squads into submission Saturday at
the 105th annual Big Meet. The
women were able to defend their
Big Meet title, but despite gutsy per
formances. the men were unable to
repeat last year's success.

TRACK AND FIELD
■ Saturday: WOMEN — Stanford
113, California 50. MEN — Cal 92.
Stanford 71.

The Stanford women dominated
the meet throughout, taking individ
ual wins in 13 of the 19 events. The
women more than doubled Cal's
score, winning 113-50 and gaining a
one-win advantage in the series his
tory. 10-9.
The men's performances were
equally formidable. The distance
crew gathered 35 of the possible 36
points in their events and the throw
ers captured 19 of a possible 36. But
sweeps by Cal in the 1 10-meter hur
dles, the relays and all of the hori
zontal jumping events dealt a devas
tating blow to the Cardinal cause.

The men lost by a final score of 92-
71.
Head coach Vin Lananna was
nevertheless pleased with the efforts
from both squads.
"The women just dominated the
meet all the way around," Lananna
said.
Provisional NCAA qualifiers
came from freshman Sally Glynn's 9
minute, 26.3 second win in the 3.(X lO
meter run and fellow freshman Julia
Stamps' 5,000-meter blowout in
16:31. The times were personal bests
for both Stamps and Glynn.
Individual event winners includ
ed seniors Heather Miller in the 100
(12.14 seconds), Bernadette Ar
mand in the 1(K) hurdles (14.30). ka
trinka Jackson in the high jump (5
feet,4 I/4 inches); junior TaraOet
tinget in the triple jump (38-11);
sophomores Tracye Lawyer in the
long jump (18-11). Cassie Romuld
in the shot put (47-9). Allison Beat
ty in the javelin (150-7), Summer
Pierson in the discus (175-0); and
freshmen Danielle Spurlock in the
4(X) (55.67) and Melissa Feinstein in
the pole vault (12-0).
On the men's side, superior ef
forts in the throws, vertical jumps
and distance races kept the Cardinal
in the mix for much of the meet.
"The men performed just about
as well as they could have," Lanan
na said. "Where we were beaten, we
were beaten by better athletes."
In the throws, junior Adam Con
nolly's 53-7 shot put was not only
enough for the win, but it was a per
sonal best by 7 feet. Freshman Mark
Ganek stepped up to win the discus
with a toss of 177 feet, and both Con
nolly and Ganek scored points in
the hammer throw.
Freshman Todd Beyerlein
soared 6-8 3/4 inches to take first
place in the high jump, and sopho
more Toby Stevenson cleared the
bar at 17-4 1/2 in the pole vault for
first place and an NCAA provision
al qualifier.
Stanford was all but uncontested
in the distances, taking first, second
and third place in every event but
the 5,000 meters. Sophomore
Michael Stember won the 800 me
ters with a blistering kick in 1:51.52,
and freshman Gabe Jennings left
Cal competition eating his dust with
a 3:45.52 in the 1,500.
Sophomores Brad and Brent
Hauser went one-two in the S£XX),
crossing the line together in 14:03.18
and 14:03.20, respectively.
Freshman Jonathan Riley put a
gap between himself and the rest of
the pack, winning the 3,000-meter
steeplechase in 9:03.39, while a
strong effort from senior Greg Jim
merson and a vicious last 100 meters
from junior Donald Kennedy
helped the Card complete the sweep
of the event.
The men's team was in con
tention for the title for most of the
meet, but when the Golden Bears
took first and second in the 200-
meter dash and swept the points in
the triple jump, the show was over.
"Sure, a win for the men would
have been nice," Lananna said.
"But the efforts our guys put out are
what the Big Meet is all about."
