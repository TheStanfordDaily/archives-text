# Card sticks fork in ASU's league hopes
## 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
Stanford brought out the brooms this
weekend and swept Arizona State out of the
race for the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division title.
With yesterday's 12-8 victory, the No. 1
Cardinal (40-8-1, 21-6 Six-Pac) silenced the
No. 13 Sun Devils (33-20,18-11) in a crucial
series and put Stanford in a prime position to
win its second consecutive title.
"I have a feeling we're going to peak at
the right time, and (this] game was evidence
of that," said junior center fielder Jody
Gerut. who hit his 16th home run of the sea
son and had five RBls on the day. "Right
now we are starting our offensive comeback.
Our pitching has been up all year. Hitters are
getting the chance to return the favor."
With the three victories this weekend.
Stanford stands atop the division, leading
No. 6 USC by two games. When the Trojans
come to town next weekend, the Cardinal
needs to win just one of the three games in
order to clinch the title.
"They're the type of team that will go for
our throats," Gerut said of USC. "I antici
pate a dogfight. It's not going to be a walk in
the park." Last year Stanford needed to win
just one of three at second-place UCLA to
win the Six-Pac, and it did — in the finale.
Scoring six of its 12 runs in the first two in
nings yesterday, Stanford forced Arizona
State to use six pitchers to get through the 3
hour. 40 minute game.
"I thought we were pretty consistent
throughout the game swinging the bats."
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
Trailing 6-2 in the top of the fourth, the
Sun Devils made their biggest attempt at a
comeback by scoring three runs off the even
tual winner. Cardinal freshman Austin
Coose (3-0). Stanford came back, however,
with two rum in the bottom of the inning and
the three-run homer by Gerut in the sixth
"I'm not going to think about I 'SC for a
day or two." Marquess said after the sweep.
"They're just too good."
With a controversial call at the plate
going the Cardinal's way. Stanford also took
a 4-3 win over the Sun Devils on Saturday.
After pitching eight complete innings
and allowing only two earned runs, junior
Chad Hutchinson (4-3) gave the Cardinal a
4-2 lead heading into the ninth inning. Sun
Devil second baseman Willie Bloomquist,
however, who went 4 for 5 at the plate on the
day. hit a RBI double to center field in the
top of the inning with two men on base.
After one run scored on the shot. Gerut
gunned out the tying run at home.
Arizona State head coach Pat Murphy
didn't agree with home-plate umpire Mike
Riggers' call and let Ritmers know b\ re

peatedly humping chests with him.
"He was pretty angry," said Stanford
sophomore catcher Damien Alvarado. "He
was yelling that he had a right to argue, along
with a bunch of obscenities. But I know I
tagged him though. The throw was perfect."
Marquess felt he didn't have the best of
views from Stanford's dugout, but he had
complete faith in Alvarado.
"I couldn't tell. I had no clue." Marquess
said of the play. "I asked my catcher if it was
fine, and he said (the call] was fair "
Stanford scored its first three runs of the
game in the first inning, with home runs by
sophomore left fielder Edmund Muth and
sophomore first baseman John Gall.
"i'm seeing the ball really well right
now," Gall said. "Today was unbelievable.
The guys came through when we really
needed to."
Freshman designated hitter Joe Bor
chard added a crucial insurance run in the
eighth with an RBI single to center field.

Junior Jeff Austin (11-2) seemed very
pleased with the offensive support as well.
After retiring 12 of the first 15 batters he
faced. Austin gave up two runs in the fifth in
