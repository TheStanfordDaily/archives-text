# Softball starts, sputters in South
## Team creams Arizona State, then falls limp against Wildcats 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
Stanford softball came up a little
short in its quest for revenge this
weekend. The No. 9 Cardinal swept
No. 15 Arizona State to avenge a
split earlier in the season but contin
ued to struggle with No. 1 Arizona,
and the Pacific 10 Conference
champion Wildcats swept the Card

for the second time this season.
Stanford (35-16, 13-11 Pac-10)
can do no better than tie for second
place in the Pac-10 with Washing
ton and no worse than a fourth
place tie. A single win over Oregon
next week would clinch third place
for the Cardinal, who has never fin
ished better than fifth. Stanford also
has posted school records in wins
and conference wins.

The Card first took two low
scoring games from the Sun Devils
on Friday in Tempe. 4-1. 1-0. drop
ping ASU into last place.
In the first game. ASt (36-22,8-
lh after sweeping Cat on Saturday)
got the lead in the third when Jen
nifer Gall hit an RBI single.
Stanford came back in the fifth
when junior shortstop Michelle
Schneider doubled in junior second

baseman Jennie Foyle. In the sev
enth. the Card exploded for three
runs off pitcher Carrie Breedlove
(14-13). one coming on a Foyle sin
gle. one on a Schneider single and
the other on a double by junior
pitcher Marcy Crouch.

bottom of the inning to hold on for
the win. For the game, she walked
two and struck out six.
Stanford proved it deserves its
top-10 ranking by solidly beating the
nation's No. 15 team, but Arizona
similarly proved why it's No. 1 by
handily defeating Stanford 10-3 and
8-0 (in six innings) in Tucson.
"We left Arizona with the feeling
that we can play with this team,"
Crouch said. "Given a different field
[without 1,500 Arizona fans], it
would have been a completely dif
ferent game."
Stanford started things off quick
ly in the opener, jumping to a 2-0
lead in the first. Sophomore catcher
Kellie Wiginton led off with a hit.
With one out, Schneider walked
and Crouch hit a single to load the
bases. Then Acosta hit a ground ball
to the second baseman, whose throw
to the plate got past the catcher.
Wiginton and Schneider scored.

Stanford's lead was short-lived,
as the Wildcats (57-3, 23-1 after
sweeping Cal yesterday) had their
way with Blevins and senior Jessica
Schulman.
In the first inning, Katie Swan hit
a grand slam off Blevins for her third
home run of the season, putting the
Wildcats ahead 4-2.
Stanford got into the action in the
fifth when Blevins hit what ap
peared to be a home run. However,
she overran the runner ahead of her
and was awarded a single and an
RBI instead of a home run.
In the second game, Stanford ran
into the same trouble it had earlier
— Arizona pitching was nearly un
hittable, and eight 'Cats had hits.
Shortstop Nancy Evans, who got
her 116 th career win on the mound
in the opener, put the nail in the cof
fin with a three-run blast that put
Arizona up 7-0 in the fourth inning.
Stanford was unable to score in
the remainder of the game en route
to the 8-0 loss. Crouch took the loss
for the Card, while Becky Lemke
(21-2) earned the win for Arizona.
