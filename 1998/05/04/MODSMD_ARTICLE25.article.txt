# New dollies chosen
## 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
Despite the dark clouds and
steady rain, the dollies were greeted
by an anxious and cheering crowd
whose energy and joy was only mir
rored by that of the dollies them
selves and the Stanford Band.
It may just be the highly creative
advertising for Dollie Splash, but
what everyone gathered for that day
was a Stanford tradition, the adop
tion of a new group of Stanford
sweethearts with a warm and grateful
goodbye to the old.
They danced with graceful non
chalance, flashing genuine smiles and
teasing winks into the crowds filled
with their friends and fellow Cardi
nal.
After only five weeks of practicing
together, the new dollies learned
eight traditional dances and choreo
graphed one new dance to the Band
closer, "All Right Now."
Dollies of previous years joined
the new class for one dance right be
fore "White Punks on Dope," where
the band chanted "out with the old"
while the crowd responded with "in
with the new."
The performance ended with the
Band throwing the dollies into the
fountain along with some of this
year's.
The new dollies include sopho
mores Wendy Marinaccio, Lani Lud
wick and Lynn Chiu, and freshmen
Helen Huang and Lizzie Barnett.
They were chosen out of 25 women
who tried out.
"It is always hard to pick out new
dollies. Most of the girls are very
qualified dancers," said sophomore
Jon Stemnile. "By the third round,
dance ability is no longer a concern.
We were looking for five girls to pro
ject the image of the Band and of
Stanford. I think these new dollies
are perfect."
Stemmle is this year's "Dollie
Daddy" which means that he is the
one responsible for making sure
that the new dollies are adapting
well, getting along and, most impor
tantly, having one of their best and
most memorable experiences at
Stanford.
Few realize exactly how much of a
commitment being a dollie is. They
accompany the Band in each of its
events, which not only includes sport
ing events, but also off-campus rallies
and performances. Other dollie du
ties also include designing their own
outfits and choreographing their own
dances.
"Well, Lani is always super up
beat. Helen is quiet but warm.
Wendy is spunky. Lizzie is highly so
cial and involved. Lynn is very friend

ly. But they all are very happy peo
ple," said Stemmle, describing this
year's quintet.
Lizzie Barnett's dance back
ground includes gymnastics, cheer
leading and recreational dancing.
She is also a field hockey player. Her
attitude toward being a dollie is com
pletely motivated by a love for dance.
"I love to dance, and I had wanted
to get more involved with Stanford. 1
wanted something to do. Being a dol
lie means a lot of tradition, fun, sport
ing events, and 1 get to hang out with
the Band," Barnett said.
Lani Ludwick has studied karate
for 11 years and has also competed in
ternationally. She claims that her
martial arts background has been in
valuable to her dance. Despite no for
mal dance experience, she did cheer
and street funk in high school. Her
first exposure to the dollies came
when she was a prospective fresh
man, and she has wanted to be one
ever since.
"I love dancing, and I've been in
love with the Band for so long," Lud
wick said. "Now I am a part of it."
Lynn Chiu is a pre-med student.
She has four years of song and cheer
experience from high school. She has
also studied ballet and tap. For her,
dancing is a stress reliever and puts
her in a good mood.
"When I am dancing, I am danc
ing with a purpose, which is to share
the joy of dancing," Chiu said.
Helen Huang is a water-skier. She
has background in ballet, jazz, funk,
pom and tap. She was on the dance
team for four years and captain dur
ing her senior year.
"There is so much tradition, even
small ones which we don't know
about," Huang said. "Originally, I
wanted to do it for the dance, but now
I love it for so much more."
Wendy Marinaccio is the only one
with band experience. She was the
percussion section leader. Marinac
cio's band, "Too Much Neon," won
the Battle of the Bands earlier this
year.
She originally chose to be a drum
mer because it wasn't something girls
traditionally did. Marinaccio's moth
er started her on ballet at age 5, and
she is minoring in dance.
For her, the hardest part of be
coming a dollie was the transition
from the wild drummer image the
Band was used to, to the graceful
dancer image.
"It is the most exciting experience
of my life," Marinaccio said. "I am
still surprised. I love making the little
kids smile. My parents can see me at
home during nationally televised
sports events. I love to dance, and
being a dollie represents everything
good about Stanford."
