## Last Exotic Erotic jammed 
### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Ending one of Stanford's better known tradi
tions, Alpha Sigma's Exotic Erotic Ball came to an
end on Saturday.
Featuring a bouncy castle, wading pool / bubble
bath, a waterfall and a pudding play area, the party
that has been known for the attire, or lack of attire,
of its guests finished its last year at Alpha Sig. which
will house the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority begin
ning next fall.
"Last night was incredible." said house manager
Jason Mendelson.
"Everyone I've ever seen at Stanford was there."
he added.
The party may have been packed, but the night
did not pass without any glitches. Several people re
ported missing clothing, wallets, identification cards
and other personal items.
"When 1 went to the front door last night, a girl at
the door asked me to take my jacket off. so 1 took it
off and gave her my ID as well, which she put in a
bag." said freshman Kate Chauncey. "Then after the
party, when I went to get my stuff, it was gone," she
added.
"I know a couple of other people who were miss
ing stuff too."
Personal items, which were placed in bags out
side the front door, were watched over by members
of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, who served as se
curity for Saturday night's event.
Staff members at Alpha Sig say it is a common oc
currence, however.
"I would venture to guess that most people didn't
get their stuff stolen." Menselson said.
"We have piles and piles of clothing left over
from last night, that people haven't claimed yet. It
happens every year," he added. "As far as I know,
no one has reported anything stolen." he said.
Anyone missing items is encouraged to go to
Alpha Sig and talk to members of the staff.
