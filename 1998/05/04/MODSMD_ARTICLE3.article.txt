# Athletic sponsorship increasing
## 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Corporate sponsorships remain
an important source of funding for
the Stanford Athletics Department,
although questions have been raised
about excessive commercialization of
the Cardinal.
Stanford's corporate funding for

athletics has increased to $1.4 million
this year, not including apparel agree
ments. And even though that number
continues to rise, the Athletics De
partment is making some moves to
ward lowering the profile of corpo
rate sponsors' presence at athletic
events. But the most controversial of
those sponsors. Nike Inc.. continues
to play a major role in Stanford ath

letics. much to the displeasure of fac
ulty and students who have staged re
cent protests against it.
Sponsorship today
According to Valerie Veronin. as
sociate athletic director of finance
and operations, the University's
funding from corporate sponsors in
creased bv about $200,000 from last

year. The total operational budget
for the Athletic Department is about
525.H million.
In addition, two-thirds of the $1.6
million athletic apparel budget is
funded through coaches' agreements
with clothing and shoe companies.
Jon Denney. associate athletic di
rector for external relations, said
Stanford is following a nationwide
trend, with corporate sponsorship of
collegiate athletics skyrocketing dur
ing the past five years. He said it is dif
ficult to make direct comparisons
with other schools but called Stan
ford's level of sponsorship compara
ble to schools with similar programs.
"I think we do well." he said.
Sponsorships come in many differ
ent forms, from hotels and restau
rants trading services for an affiliation
with Stanford to signs displayed
prominently in Stanford sporting
venues. Other forms of sponsorship
include radio advertising, promotion
al giveaways and corporate tailgate
parties.
"Sometimes we're contacted,
sometimes we contact them." said
Robert Carruesco, marketing man
ager for the Athletics Department.
He said he had 30 pages listing differ
ent corporate sponsorships, but only

about 75 to 1 (X) organizations —
among these GTE, Citibank and
Pepsi — contribute substantially.
The same companies tend to spon
sor Stanford athletics year after year,
leaving few opportunities for others
who might want to join in after partic
ularly good seasons, such as the re
cent success of the mens basketball
program.
"We have a good retention rate."
Denney said.
Veronin said corporations seek to
sponsor Stanford athletics for a vari
ety of reasons, including exposure
through television and radio.
Carruesco noted that Stanford
presented a good demographic for
advertisers. "The challenge is not to
take everything that comes along," he
said, adding that the department tries
to keep advertisements uncluttered
and tasteful.
"The concern is too many com
mercial signs at events," explained
Tim Warner, vice provost for budget
and auxiliaries management.
The Athletics Department recent
ly decided to eliminate the advertis

ing billboards that cover the perime
ter of Stanford Stadium near the field
and is planning to consolidate the
signs near the floor of Maples Pavil
ion to a location near the scoreboard.
" The situation is dynamic and
changing all the time," Carruesco
said. "We're concerned, as are other
people, that we don't look too com
mercial."
Nike's impact
At a February Faculty Senate
meeting, some professors expressed
concern about the over-commercial
ization of Stanford athletics, most no
tably the University's affiliation with
Nike. In addition, a group of students,
faculty and staff has organized within
the last year to protest any University
involvement with Nike, a company
that has come under fire in recent
years for alleged labor abuses in
Southeast Asia.
At Stanford and most schools,
each individual sport is allowed to ne
gotiate its own apparel deal. Nike has
agreements with many high profile
sports at Stanford, including both

football and men's and women's bas
ketball. In addition, Nike has an "um
brella" contract under which it pro
vides apparel for lower-profile sports
that lack an apparel agreement.
Most Stanford athletes' uniforms
display at least one of Nike's
"swoosh" logos.
But controversy has recently sur
rounded Nike's labor practices. An
internal audit report conducted by
the accounting firm Ernst and Young
leaked to the media last year reported
that workers suffered from "despera
tion, physical exhaustion and pres
sure to work overtime to meet high
production quotas."
Nike produces most of its products
in Southeast Asian countries where
wages are as low as $ 1.60 a day.
A group of consumer lawyers last
month filed a lawsuit in San Francisco
Superior Court alleging that Nike
misleads the public about its labor
practices.
At Stanford, Assoc. Drama and
Classics Prof. Rush Rehm has spear
headed an effort to convince the Uni
versitv to sever its ties with Nike.

Stanford has always had ties to vari
ous corporations over the years, but
Nike is "a disgusting organization,"
according to Rehm.
"I think people really don't like
the idea of corporate sponsors,"
Rehm said, noting that a similar cor
porate sponsorship with the Drama
Department would not be well re
ceived.
Rehm said he had support from
more than 40 people at Stanford, al
though his committee has only about
six core members. The group has
passed out lliers at Stanford sporting
events and has staged a protest in an
effort to increase awareness about the
situation.
About 65 faculty members have
signed a letter expressing unhappi
ness with University involvement
with Nike, he added.
When Nike CEO Phil Knight,
who received an MBA at Stanford in
1 %2, spoke on campus last spring, he
was met by a group of about 40 pro
testers.
While some people consider Nike
and Phil Knight a financial success

story, Rehm said Nike's success is un
ethical.
"Nike is about exploitation," he
said flatly, "not 'Just do it' or i can' "
— two slogans prominently featured
in advertising.
"Stanford has an opportunity to be
a leader (on this issue)," said Rehm,
who feels the University hasn't
thought through the situation.
Similar student movements
against Nike exist on college campus
es across the nation, but so far, they
have had little impact on athletics de
partments.
Rehm emphasized that the issue
affects everyone involved with the
University.
"I don't want to be on Nike's
team." he said. "Do you?"
Looking ahead
Athletics Department representa
tives emphasized the importance of
its apparel agreements.
Veronin said the department has
been approached by Nike with a deal
that would make the company the
sole provider of apparel for all Stan
ford sports.
"Ohio State seemed to prosper
after such a deal." she said.
However, no such deal would go
into effect before the summer of 2001
due to existing contracts. Veronin
said officials are "trying to assess
what is in the best interest of the Ath
letics Department."
"I think that's a consideration,
what a company represents and what

they do." Carruesco added.
"1 don't know the Nike situation,"
he continued, suggesting that many
companies might be guilty of similar
labor practices. "Unfortunately for
Nike, they are high profile."
Veronin agreed. "They've gotten
the most exposure. We're all aware.
We will give all consideration to it
when we go into the next contract ne
gotiation."
Rehm said he has met with Ath
letic Director Ted Leland in the past
and has a meeting, along with other
members of the committee, sched
uled with Provost Condoleezza Rice
later this month.
