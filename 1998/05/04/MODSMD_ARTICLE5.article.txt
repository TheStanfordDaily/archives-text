As the spring sun warms Stan
ford's red-tiled rooftops, it also high
lights the poles of the white tipis nes
tled in a nearby eucalyptus grove.
While tipis may not be a building
style usually associated with Palo
Alto, the lodges have become a regu
lar feature of the Stanford campus
each Mother's Day weekend.
This Friday. Saturday and Sundav

will mark the 27th year ot the annual
Stanford Powwow. Over 30.000 Na
tive American dancers, artisans,
drummers and interested visitors
from around the country now con
verge for the event.
The Stanford Powwow is the
largest student-run multicultural
event on campus and the biggest
powwow in the nation. So how did
one of the West Coast's most notable
powwows end up at a university bet
ter known for its Nobel Prize-winners

than its Indian try bread
Students from the Stanford
American Indian Organization have
organized the event from its 1970 in
ception. Judy Gonsales. of the Pima
and Dakota tribes, began her under
graduate career in 1975. Now a doc
toral candidate in education, she sits
beneath a dozen framed powwow
posters in the Native American Cul
tural Center and recalls her involve
ment in the 1976 Stanford Powwow.
"As an undergraduate. I sau [the

Powwow J as an opportunity tor the
larger Stanford community to be ex
posed to the aspects of intertribal re
ality." she said. She felt that SAIO
was a family, a way to keep in touch
with her tribal roots.
Powwows are a relatively modern
tradition among Native Americans,
evolving from the times when the
tribes of the Great Plains would re
unite in the summer after spending
the winter in smaller bands. It was a
time for celebration, socializing and
ceremony. Open to the public,
today's powwows provide an oppor
tunity to learn about various tribal
backgrounds and customs that weave
through the whirl of feathered re
galia. the jingle of dance bells and the
crunch of spicy Indian tacos.
Dancers, artisans, singers and
their families travel the country par
ticipating in various powwows. The
events are a time to socialize and to
catch up on gossip, but there is also
serious prize money to be won at the
dance competitions.
Music pulses from groups of
singers gathered around single
drums, singing competition songs for
dancers and special songs to honor in
dividuals.
Dancers from many tribes don
elaborate regalia decorated with in

tricate beadwork. brightly-colored
feathers and shiny bells to compete.
The men's categories are fancy, tradi
tional and grass dancing; the women
compete in shawl / fancy, traditional
and jingle dancing.
Each dance type is grouped by
age, and competitions can last for
days. Winners can come away with
hundreds of dollars in prize money.
The top awards at the Stanford Pow
wow are $S(X).
The Stanford Powwow's success
depends on the effort of students,
who devote hundreds of hours to the
event. Steered by a core group of
about seven, SAIC) prepares, negoti
ates and fund raises year-round.
Marcel Begay, a Navajo / Chippe
wa senior, and Dave LaSarte, a third
year doctoral student in law and busi
ness from the Coeur d'Alene tribe,
are co-chairs of this year's Powwow.
"The Powwow costs about
$W.(XX) to put on," LaSarte said.
"Eight thousand dollars comes from
the University, so we have to raise the

rest."
"We also have to get the grounds
ready and work with the Athletic De
partment, the Office of Planning and
the police," Begay said. In all, 10 dif
ferent departments must coordinat
ed. Applications for the 130 food and
art booths are also coordinated by the
students. After vendors are selected,
health and safety permits are
arranged, and vendors' tax ID num
bers are verified.
Bringing families together helps
make the work worthwhile. "For
many of these students, they're the
first generation attending college,"
LaSarte said. "Lots of families would
never come to California, much less
Stanford."
Local Native Americans also ben
efit from the event. Over 40,(XX) Na
tive Americans live in the Bay Area.
Begay said the event is a good way for
them to get together.
Denni Woodward, assistant direc
tor of the Native American Cultural
Center since 1981. is a lifelong mem

ber of that community. She attended
powwows during her childhood in
Menlo Park and has enjoyed the If)
Stanford events that have taken place
since she began working here.
Woodward agreed that the Stan
ford Powwow presents a much-need
ed chance for both the University and
surrounding communities to learn
about Native American cultures.
"Stanford has a tradition of great
involvement by its Native American
students," she said. "It started with
just four students. ... Although the
numbers of Native students then
were small, they were very active.
That the Powwow is such a big event
is really testimony to the involvement
of Indian students here."
The University's first Native
American students were drawn to
gether bv both social and political
motives. Lucia Mele, a Seneca from
the Allegany reservation, entered
Stanford as a freshman in 1974. Now
working in San Francisco, Mele re
calls the strong tradition of Native
American student activism that char
acterized the fledgling SAIO. She re
members students as "very progres
sive."
The students made their first sig
nificant mark on campus by cam
paigning against Stanford's "Indian"
mascot, a large-nosed cartoon carica
ture that embarrassed and offended
many students.
"The civil rights movement was
cranking up," Woodward said. A
push to admit ethnically diverse stu
dents was on.
A 1992 issue of the Native Ameri
can community newsletter, "Coming
Voice," recalled that in November
1970, the Native American student
group presented a petition to school
administrators objecting to a "live"
incarnation of the mascot â€” "Prince
Lightfoot," known otherwise as
Timm Williams, who performed at
University athletic events.
Students felt Williams' antics
made a mockery of Native American
religious practices. Lois Amsterdam,
ombudsperson in 1972, joined the
students in presenting a petition to
then-Universitv President Richard

Lyman.
"Stanford's continued use of the
Indian symbol in the 1970s brings up
to visibility a painful lack of sensitivi
ty and awareness on the part of the
University," Amsterdam wrote.
Lyman agreed and made the official
decision to remove the mascot.
Activist spirit carried over into
planning the Stanford Powwow. The
students challenged traditions they
felt were outdated, even within their
own cultural boundaries. They broke
one tradition of awarding more prize

money to male competition dancers
than to female ones.
" These days, all powwows have
equal prizes for men and women,"
Mele said, "but [in 1971] it was almost
scandalous. There were more women
than men among the Indian students
... and we didn't have trouble getting
SAIO to approve this."
Today's students have built on
these roots, and encourage everyone
to attend Stanford Powwow and ex
perience the richness of Native
American cultures.
