### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
After three consecutive appearances at
the Final Four, Stanford men's rugby made a
valiant effort but could not overtake a
tremendous California team.
The Bears, who boast the nation's only
varsity rugby program, came back from a dis
appointing first half to stop the Cardinal 34-
15 at Balboa Park in San Francisco.
Stanford jumped out to a surprising 15-10
lead behind tries by Michael Ceballos and
David Warter and a penalty kick by Warter.
but the second half was all Cal.
However, those were the only times Stan
ford put points on the board, while the Bears
went on to score an unanswered 24 points.
Cal had only two tries in the last moments of
the second half, but Cal's offense kept the
ball long enough to force five penalty kicks.
Stanford had met Cal earlier this season
and lost in a 48-19 disappointment, but the
Cardinal surprised Cal with its effort in yes
terday's final.
As the Pacific Coast runner-up. Stanford

had to get past two tight matches against Vir
ginia Tech at the regional competition in
Houston in order to get to the Final Four.
Stanford took on second-seeded Indiana
in a close match on Saturday but escaped with
a 38-25 victory. The Hoosiers were making
their first-ever Final Four appearance after
beating Truman State 31-22 to advance.
The Cardinal knew it would be facing a
challenge, because top-seeded Cal was the
clear favorite going into the tournament.
Senior Ryan De Lee said Stanford knew
Cal would be ready for anything the Cardinal
could bring to the game.
"Cal is by far the best team in the coun
try," De Lee said. "They've been No. 1 for so
long."
The defending champion Bears (15-0-1)
were running high on the first undefeated
season of 33 when it entered the tournament.
The Bears overtook Dartmouth in a crushing
70-0 match to get to the finals this year. This
was Cal's 15th national title since the champi
onships began in 1980.
"I think the entire team played very well.

A rugger skies for an inbounds pass in Saturday's
38-25 national semifinal victory against Indiana.
The team lost to California yesterday in the cham
pionship game, 34-15.
Our defense was on top of its
game," De Lee said. "But in the sec
ond half, they just wore us down.
They just had more subs.
Despite the loss in the finals.

there was no doubt Stanford gave it
their all on the field.
"The guys all played with a lot of
heart," De Lee said. "They left
everything they had out there. No
body held back. The upperclassmen
really showed a lot of leadership,
and the underclassmen really
stepped up when we needed them."
