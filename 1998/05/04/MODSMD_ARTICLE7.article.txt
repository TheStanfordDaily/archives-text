### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
In the wake of last week 's ASSI
presidential runoff election, the
ASSI' Hearings Committee has
found both slates not guilty of al
leged election rule violations.
Specifically, the Maren Norton
Santos Marroquin campaign was
found not guilty of three e-mail vi
olations. stemming from alleged
misuse of campus e-mail lists in the
days preceding the runoff election.
The committee also declared
that the Matt Spence Bianca Ling
ticket did not intentionally misrep
resent the position of MEChA and
the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization in their ASSU-spon
sored statement in The Daily.
"We find that Matt Spence
acted out of carelessness but not in
tent," said the committee in an e
niail Saturday. "Furthermore, his
ability to rectify the mistake was
greatly hindered by confusion as to
the position taken by the respec

tive cores.
The Spence statement that was
published in The Daily advertise
ment included an endorsement
from MEChA.
Spence was, in fact, in the
process of attempting to secure the
endorsement of MEChA but
hadn't.
"I sent the elections commission
two copies of the statement" for
The Daily advertisement. Spence
said, one in the text of an e-mail
and one as an attached document.
The e-mail text did not include the
MEChA endorsement, he said, but
the attached version included un
confirmed endorsements, as
Spence anticipated receiving them
at a later time.
The elections commission used
the latter version.
Spence said the advertisement
problem was an honest mix-up.
Hearings Committee Chair
Solomon Lefler agreed with
Spence.
"We think some people did
some stupid things," Lefler said,
"but we think that no one violated
the rules."
Norton was pleased by the
committee's findings.
"We're glad it was looked into
and cleared via the processes set
up," Norton said.
"Now we can get to work on
the things that are really impor
tant."
