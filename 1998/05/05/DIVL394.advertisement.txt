carry around over 4000 pages of MCAT

Make eye contact with
motorists, cyclists, and
walkers, and use hand
signals when it's safe to do
so. But signaling doesn't
change traffic rules — being
in the correct road position
is the best signal of all.
Don't bike behind vehicles
that are backing up,
especially trucks — their
drivers can't see you.
Vtlien you hear a truck's
backup beeper, STAY CLEAR!
Expect the unexpected
Keep your attention on
the street ahead Stay out
of the "door zone" next to
parked cars.
