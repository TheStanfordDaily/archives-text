# Wheee!
## Students experience sky diving joys 
### Art Diaz Contributing writer 
Soaring at 125 mph, it's not a bird or a
plane but senior Matt Blythe in another one
of his sky diving jumps.
Blythe has been throwing himself out of
airplanes in this extreme sport for most of his
senior year. He has completed over 200
jumps, which makes him one of the most ex
perienced skydiver on campus.
Blythe's peers in the sport include junior
Jon Bruck and senior Beau Pelle. The two
started sky diving last July when they were
roommates at summer school.
Bruck had wanted to sky dive for some
time, but each time he found a seemingly
willing thrill seeker, the person backed out. It
wasn't until Bruck asked Pelle if he wanted to
make the jump that Bruck found a sky diving
companion.
In the months since July, the two have
jumped over 50 times, giving them Class A
certification, the first level of certification at
tainable.
Blythe started jumping in order to satisfy
his curiosity after being trained as a private
pilot. As part of his acrobatic training, he had
to wear a parachute but didn't get the chance

to use it. Last summer though. Blythe com
pleted his first dive.
"Probably some of the most adrenaline
my body has ever experienced," he said.
"Every nerve in my body felt it."
Daredevil sports such as skydiving and
rock climbing, according to an article in
Climbing magazine, are known to ignite the
same chemical signals in the body as hallu
cinogenic drugs.
Blythe has gone on to specialize in free fly
ing. a position in which the person's head is
oriented toward the ground during the dive.
He is currently training with the third-ranked
free flyer in the world.
According to experienced jumpers, the
sky diving experience is unlike any other.
"Sky diving is such a unique experience.
There's really no way to explain or describe
all the sensations that you feel when you are
flying," Bruck said.
At such great speed and distance from the
earth, the sensation during sky diving is not
of plummeting but of soaring through the
sky.
"Falling at 120 to 150 mph. you're so high
that there is no sensation of falling. You just

feel like you're flying," Bruck ex
plained.
"You're so far up that you don't
have a perspective of things. You
only feel a falling sensation after
you pull your chute which slows
you down to 5 niph from 150 mph."
According to Pelle, the best
feeling is falling through sparse
clouds.
"It's like going through a car
wash in three seconds. Your en
veloped in white, which feels like
you're in another world, and then
you come out with drops of water
that are dried by the fast winds,"
Pelle said.
There are some drawbacks to
the sport, however. Sky diving is
expensive, costing about $150 per
jump.
Buying all the necessary equip
ment can set someone back about
$5,000. including the cost of a com
puterized system that will deploy
the parachute automatically if the

jumper is knocked unconscious.
Parental objections present the
other major obstacle.
"1 sky dived under the worries
of my parents. They would say
'Hell no, not under my roof.' To
which I said, 'OK, so I'll wait until
I'm out of your roof,' " Pelle said.
Blythe said. "First, they were
apprehensive, but given the fact
that 1 am going to do it anyway,
they support me now.
"And actually, my entire family
is going to sky dive when I gradu
ate."
As for those parental fears, sta
tistics show that they may be un
founded.
Last year, there were 39 total
sky diving deaths in the United
States.
In fact, it is more likely to crash
a car driving to the drop zone than
dying from a jump out of a plane.
Most deaths, according to
Blythe, are caused by jumpers
doing tricks once the parachute is
out rather than by defective para
chutes.
For those considering skv div

ing, there are two options — tan
dem and accelerated tree fall
(AFF). In tandem, the cheaper of
the two, a certified sky diver is at
tached to the jumper's back. In
AFF, the person jumps alone. The
major difference comes in the
number of hours a person is willing
to devote to taking training classes
and the amount of nerve and
money they have.
Blythe also recommended
videotaping the first jump for sen
timental reasons and to actually
see what happened.
There is so much adrenaline in
your body that you are likely to for
get the whole series of events when
you hit the ground, he said.
"It's sort of weird," Blythe ex
plained. "Very rarely do people
have a clear memory of their first
couple of jumps."
"I still watch my first jump and
still get that tingly feel of excite
ment in my stomach."
In response to why someone
would want to jump out of a per
fectly good plane, Blythe replied.
"You'll never know until you trv it."
