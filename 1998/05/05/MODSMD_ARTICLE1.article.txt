## Students experience sky diving joys

Soaring at 125 mph, it's not a bird or a
plane but senior Matt Blythe in another one
of his sky diving jumps.
Blythe has been throwing himself out of
airplanes in this extreme sport for most of his
senior year. He has completed over 200
jumps, which makes him one of the most ex
perienced skydiver on campus.
Blythe's peers in the sport include junior
Jon Bruck and senior Beau Pelle. The two
started sky diving last July when they were
roommates at summer school.
Bruck had wanted to sky dive for some
time, but each time he found a seemingly
willing thrill seeker, the person backed out. It
wasn't until Bruck asked Pelle if he wanted to
make the jump that Bruck found a sky diving
companion.
In the months since July, the two have
jumped over 50 times, giving them Class A
certification, the first level of certification at
tainable.
Blythe started jumping in order to satisfy
his curiosity after being trained as a private
pilot. As part of his acrobatic training, he had
to wear a parachute but didn't get the chance

to use it. Last summer though. Blythe com
pleted his first dive.
"Probably some of the most adrenaline
my body has ever experienced," he said.
"Every nerve in my body felt it."
Daredevil sports such as skydiving and
rock climbing, according to an article in
Climbing magazine, are known to ignite the
same chemical signals in the body as hallu
cinogenic drugs.
Blythe has gone on to specialize in free fly
ing. a position in which the person's head is
oriented toward the ground during the dive.
He is currently training with the third-ranked
free flyer in the world.
According to experienced jumpers, the
sky diving experience is unlike any other.
"Sky diving is such a unique experience.
There's really no way to explain or describe
all the sensations that you feel when you are
flying," Bruck said.
At such great speed and distance from the
earth, the sensation during sky diving is not
of plummeting but of soaring through the
sky.
"Falling at 120 to 150 mph. you're so high
that there is no sensation of falling. You just
