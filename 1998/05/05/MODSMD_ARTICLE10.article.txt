## McDougal charged

LITTLE ROCK. Ark. (AP)
Former Whitewater partner Susan
McDougal was charged yesterday
with three felonies for refusing to
tell a grand jury what she knows
about the first family's business
dealings, including a savings and
loan check marked with the words
"Payoff Clinton."
The indictment was handed
down by a grand jury here that is
wrapping up two years of Whitewa
ter-related investigation.
It threatens to punish McDougal
with years more of prison time for
her feisty and high-profile cam
paign to refuse answering prosecu
tors' questions.
McDougal. 43, was charged with
two counts of criminal contempt for
refusing to answer grand jury ques
tions in September 1996 and again
last month and one count of
obstruction of justice.
Her lawyer vowed to take the
case to trial, and to use such a trial
to examine recent allegations that
one of the prosecution witnesses in
an earlier case against his client had
been paid by conservative critics of
President and Mrs. Clinton.
"She is not going to be bullied by
them," attorney Mark Geragos
said, insisting he would subpoena
Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr and his top deputy as witness
es.
Starr spokesman Charles Bakalv
said McDougal had been granted
immunity from prosecution in
exchange for her testimony and had
no legal grounds for refusing a
judge's order to cooperate.
"There is not a constitutional
right not to answer questions," he
said, also accusing the president of
"injecting" himself into the highly
public feud between prosecutors

and McDougal with comments he
made in interviews.
That allegation drew a sharp
retort from Clinton's private attor
ney. Starr "through his public rela
tions officer, has seen fit to assert
that the president somehow
improperly injected himself into the
investigation." David Kendall said.
"This claim is wholly false."
"The president's statements
have been both accurate and appro
priate." the lawyer added. "It is for
the public to judge what the inde
pendent counsel's motivations may
be."
Starr issued a statement saying
the indictment did not accuse the
president of wrongdoing.
But court documents attached to
the indictment revealed previously
undisclosed evidence affecting Clin
ton.
In videotaped testimony submit
ted in 19% during McDougal's first
trial. Clinton testified under oath in
19% he never had any loans or
financial dealings with the failed
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan
owned by McDougal and her late
ex-husband. James.
The indictment includes a partial
transcript of McDougal's last grand
jury appearance in which she was
confronted by prosecutors with a
$5,081.82 check she signed over to
Madison Guaranty that was
marked "payoff Clinton."
The check from August 1983
was drawn on a McDougal account
and paid to the S&L that eventual
ly failed, the court record said.
Prosecutors do not say in the
indictment what they believe the
check was for. hut indicated the rea
son they were interested in it was
because it related to Clinton's
videotaped testimony in 19%.
