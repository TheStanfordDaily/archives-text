SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
— Unflinching and unrepentant,
Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski
was given four life sentences yester
day as the families of his victims
prayed aloud for his eternal damna
tion and demanded that he be
locked up "so far down that when
lie dies he'll be closer to hell."
"He's diabolical, evil, cunning, a
murderer." said Susan Mosser,
whose husband, Thomas Mosser.
died before her eyes in New Jersey
after he opened a bomb sent by
Kaczynski.
The outcome of the sentencing
was never in doubt: U.S. District
Judge Garland Burrell Jr. gave the
55-year-old former mathematician
four life sentences plus 30 years, as
spelled out in a plea bargain
reached in January. Kaczvnski's
plea spared him the death penalty
and a trial in which his lawyers
planned to portray him. against his
will, as deranged.
When given a chance to address
the court. Kaczynski, the man
whose 35,000-word manifesto
against the evils of technology filled
eight newspaper pages, spoke only
briefly, offering no apologies and
no explanations.
He strode to a courtroom
lectern and, in a high-pitched nasal
voice, complained that the govern
ment had lied about his anti-tech
nology philosophy and was "dis
crediting me personally."
"I ask only that people reserve
judgment on me and the
I Jnabomber case," Kaczynski said.
He said he would explain his
motives at a future time.
In imposing the sentence, the
judge said. "The defendant com
mitted unspeakable and monstrous

crimes for which he shows utterly
no remorse."
He added that he feared
Kaczynski would try to kill again if
not closely watched.
The Unabomber. so named
because he targeted university pro
fessors and airlines as well as others
in his anti-technology terrorist cam
paign. killed three men and injured
29 others in 16 attacks between
1978 and 1995.
The attacks ended with Kac/vn
ski s capture at his Montana shack
in April 1996. He was caught after
his brother notified the FBI that

Kaczynski's letters bore a resem
blance to the Unabomber mani
festo published under pressure in
The Washington Post.
The plea bargain covered the
three deaths and the maimings of
two scientists.
As part of the plea bargain,
Kaczynski acknowledged responsi
bility for all of the Unabomber
attacks.
He will be sent to a high-securi
ty federal prison, possibly in Lom
poc or in Colorado. At the sentenc
ing. six of the Unabomber survivors
came forward to describe their

grief, pain and anger.

man. and I fight daily to find the
carefree happiness ... that was
taken from me." sohhed (iary
