VATICAN CITY (AP) â€” The
newly appointed head of Pope John
Paul IPs Swiss Guards, his wife and
another member of the elite corps
were found shot to death in the
commander's apartment last night.
Vatican officials said.
The bodies of Alois Estermann.
his wife and officer Cedrich Tornay
were found in the apartment inside
Vatican City after a neighbor
reported hearing loud noises com
ing from the commander's home,
said the Rev. Ciro Benedettini. a
Vatican spokesman.
There was no official word on
what caused the shooting. But
Benedettini said it appeared to be a
"moment of madness" by Tornay.
Estermann, 44, had been

appointed to head of the pope's
bodyguards earlier that very same
day by the Roman Catholic pontiff.
The position had been vacant for
nearly seven months, and Ester
mann had been serving as acting
commander.
He had been married to the
Venezuelan-born Gladys Meza
Romero for nearly 15 years. Italian
media said Tornay, 23. was a non
commissioned officer with the Swiss
Ciuards corps.
The Vatican spokesman said
investigators found Tornay's pistol
underneath his body. All three vic
tims were dressed.
An autopsy was scheduled for
today at the Vatican by forensic
experts who are consultants to the

Vatican health service.
An 18-year Swiss veteran of the
force, Estcrmann was one of the
few and rare non-noblemen to head
the Swiss Guards.
The 100-member corps, whose
colorful uniforms were designed by
the legendary artist Michelangelo,
traditionally is headed by a noble.
The Swiss Guards keep order at
papal events and guard the
entrances to Vatican City. A plain
clothes detachment accompanies
the pope on his foreign travels.
Estcrmann had been the guards'
acting commander and had traveled
with John Paul on more than 30
trips abroad. He joined the Swiss
Guards after four years as an officer
in Switzerland's army.
