Denny's is accused again
BALTIMORE (AP) — Black sixth-graders on a
field trip to Disney World were denied service at a
Denny's restaurant, school officials said yesterday,
the latest in a series of complaints against the chain
that settled a $46 million discrimination lawsuit in
1994.
The Baltimore students and their chaperones
entered the Oconee. Fla. restaurant Thursday night,
and were not greeted or seated, school officials said.
After seating themselves, the students waited 20
minutes before some received menus, and left an
hour later without being served. Meanwhile, white
customers who entered later were served, said school
officials, who added they planned to file a complaint
with the company.
"The way we were greeted, actually entering the
restaurant, we were not welcomed, chaperone
Peggy Brown said.
The incident will be investigated, said Ray Hot*d-
Phillips. chief diversity officer for Denny's, a post
created following the 1994 settlement.
"If we find that discrimination has occurred, it
doesn't matter if it's a company store or a franchise
unit, we take swift action." Hood-Phillips said.
"Employees are fired if they're found to discriminate,
and if it's a franchise, we take the franchise away."
The lawsuit settled in 1994 was brought by black
Secret Service agents who said they were denied ser
vice.

NRA displeased with Streisand
BEVERLY HILLS. Calil.(AP) — Charlton Hes
ton called Barbra Streisand the "Hanoi Jane of the
Second Amendment" yesterday, continuing his criti
cism of a TV movie she produced.
Heston. the acclaimed actor and National Rifle
Association vice president, said "The Long Island
Incident" misrepresented the NRA and the Second
Amendment of the I S. Constitution, which deals
with the right to bear arms
"We are talking about a sacred document in
America and to distort it and misstate its reality is a
very serious error." Heston said.
Barbara Streisand, meanwhile, defended the
accuracy of her movie and the film's director
denounced Heston's remark as inflammatory.
The movie, which aired Sunday on NBC. told the
story of Carolyn McCarthy, who won a seat in
Congress after a gunman killed her husband and five
other people on a New York commuter train in 1993.
McCarthy campaigned on the issue of gun control.
Heston said executive producer Streisand had
become "the Hanoi Jane of the Second Amend
ment." drawing a comparison to actress Jane
Fonda's 1972 visit to North Vietnam during the Viet
nam War.
