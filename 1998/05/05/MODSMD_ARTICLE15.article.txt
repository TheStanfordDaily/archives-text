PARIS (AP) — Officials at the
Louvre were examining security
measures yesterday after a thief
stole a $1.3 million painting by
Camille C orot from a room without
TV surveillance.
The theft — the second at the
Louvre this year — caused officials
to question security at one of the
world's most famous museums,
spokesman Christophe Monin said.
Although the French govern

ment has spent about $1 billion ren
ovating the Louvre, a lack of money
for guards forces the museum to
keep up to 2<) percent of its collec
tions closed to the public. Monin
said. About new guard jobs were
created last fall. About 3<M) guards
are posted in galleries throughout
the sprawling museum, which han
dles up to .VUKK) visitors on any
given Sunday. The first Sunday of
each month is free. Former Culture

Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said
he was stunned. Visitor traffic
through the former royal palace has
increased steadily in recent years,
following a massive overhaul by
architect I.M. Pei and the creation of
a shopping mall nearby.
Tourists were temporarily
trapped Sunday inside the Louvre
when a guard discovered Corot's
"Sevres Road" was missing from the
third fltx>r of the Sully wing.
