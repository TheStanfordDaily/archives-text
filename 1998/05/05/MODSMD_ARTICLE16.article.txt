Don't let this year's Exot
ic Erotic be the last to
grace the Stanford cam
pus

Naked revelry was
something I was curious
about my freshman year.
Having graduated from a small all
girls' high school, my exposure to
bare flesh and bare members of the
opposite sex was limited.
But that was four years ago. Since
then, I have attended two Exotic
Erotics. The first was neither exotic
nor erotic. But Saturday night's fes
tivities lived up to the event's reputa
tion as one of Rolling Stone maga
zine's top college parties. Congratula
tions. Alpha Sig. for going out with a
bang.
Beneath the Saran Wrap and alu
minum foil, Exotic Erotic is about
community; not simply drunken
debauchery. Although Alpha Sig as a
house will no longer exist, former res
idents. sorority members and other
enlightened Row residents should
work together to continue the 36-
year-old tradition and offer the entire
campus a chance to get "nekkid."
Contrary to what some administra
tors may believe, Exotic Erotic fos
tered bonds and was a community
building exercise for both those who
worked hard to plan the final bash as
well as those who made it past the
Delt "bouncers."
As a resident assistant in a four
class dorm. I was happy to introduce
my residents to the pleasures that
scantily-clad flesh, loud music and
jiggling booties can bring. Especially
since this vear's ball was touted as

"The Final Exotic Erotic."
After a well-timed progressive
stripped away inhibitions, I and a
large group of freshmen made the
trek from Lagunita Court to Alpha
Sig. As one freshman put it, there's
something about seeing your RA's
breasts (not mine!) that puts things
into a different light. This is exactly
what Exotic Erotic brings to a Stan
ford education — perspective.
Who would have thought that both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents. could come together for a
night of festive raunchiness and
good-humored exhibitionism? Who
would have thought that the guy in
your CS section, or worse yet, your
TA, could Lill a white tube sock sSk
nicely? -
Exotic Erotic drew together a
diverse cross-section of students from
all corners of our 8,180-acre campus.
For one night, we were reminded that
beneath everything, we are all human
beings looking for a good time.
Despite the abundance of fishnet and
G-strings, the party was more about
liberation than lasciviousness.
Exotic Erotic challenged individu
als to reach new comfort levels —
whether that meant wearing briefs
instead of boxers, being able to carry
on a casual conversation on a couch
next to a couple doing the horizontal
rumpshaker, or actually being that
couple acting out all the positions so
artfully depicted in Day-Glo paint on
the wall.
For all who missed out, I urge you
to venture past the fog machines and
entangle your sweat-covered body
parts on the dance floor with those of
strangers, friends, neighbors and
lovers — if you get that chance.
