## Four years of true nothingness 
### 
I PROPOSE a column
about nothing. "A
column about noth
ing?" you ask. Why not?
It made millions for Jerry
Seinfeld, and while 1
might not have my own
laugh track. Stanford

seems as viable a place as
any to discuss the ramifications of noth
ingness in our everyday lives.
In order to truly perceive the pervasive
effects of nothing on our campus, one
need only consider the übiquity of small
talk. How many of these conversations did
you have last week:
"Hey Marsha, how's it going?"
"Not bad, Greg. How about yourself?"
"Pretty good. Well, see you around."
"Yeah, take care."
The perpetrator could be the room
mate of your ex-flame or your neighbor
down the hall. You've had the chance to
engage in substantive conversation before,
but have never taken the opportunity. A
good half-hour of my time every day is
consumed in such banal chitchat. After
four years here, 1 have trouble crossing
White Plaza without being subjected to at
least one of these conversations.
That's not to say 1 wouldn't want to sit
down and have a real conversation with
most of these people. I'm busy, they're
busy; the usual excuses apply. True, there
are alternatives. For example, the inale
recognition-head-nod, where a simple
incline of the head can signal anything

from, "Hey Greg, it's nice to see you
again," to "Greg, quit following me, you
twisted, maniacal sociopath." There are
also variations upon the classical theme:
Small talk at freshman orientation:
"Hi. Marsha (reading from name tag), my
name is Greg."
"Hi. Greg. What CIV are you in?"
"Great Works. What's your CIV?"
"Humanities. I guess we can't sit together
at lectures then, huh?"
"Guess not. Well, see you around."
Premed small talk:
"Hi, Marsha. Are you in the Bio core,
too?"
"Yeah, what evening do your Kaplan
MCAT classes meet?"
"Tuesdays. How about you?"
"Mine meet on Thursday."
"Too bad. Well, I'm off to lab (stress
induced blood shoots out of eyes)."
Small talk at Exotic Erotic:
"Hi. Marsha. It's me, Greg."
"Hi, Greg. I didn't recognize you in only a
hot dog bun."
"Wow, you look great. Is that plastic?"
"No, fruit leather."
"Mind if I — "
"Please don't."
Small talk at graduation:
"Hey Marsha, congratulations."
"Yeah, you too, Greg. What are you up to
next year?"

"I've been having a tough time deciding,
but I think my folks are cool with me mov
ing back home. How about you?"
"I'm consulting with Andersen (smirks). I
just picked out an apartment in San Fran
cisco."
"Gee, that's great (must resist the tempta
tion to inflict bodily harm on Marsha)."
With one chance encounter, both Mar
sha and Greg have locked themselves into
four years of interminable, mundane ban
ter. In conversations like these, "What's
up?" becomes more of a brush-off that an
actual expression of interest. Try replacing
the usual response of, "Fine," with, "The
voices in my head are much quieter
today," or, "That damn rash just won't go
away," and watch the reaction you'll get.
In all likelihood, the conversation will be
much shorter, sparing both participants
the agony of inanity.
I'm not suggesting we completely aban
don the decorum of common courtesy.
Quite the contrary; I hope we can cease
feigning interest in one another's lives, cut
the small talk and return to honest, mean
ingful dialogue.
It may take a few more minutes out of
your day, but you might end up happier
with the results.
At least you'll learn a thing or two
about somebody other than yourself.
