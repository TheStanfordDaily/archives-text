## 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
A year alter its approval by the ASSU
and Faculty senates, the new judicial char
ter is "running well and working smooth
ly." according to Judicial Affairs Adviser
Jennifer Perkins. Seven hearings have oc
curred so far this academic year.
According to sophomore Jonathan
Lotz, a member of the pool of students
who sit on judicial panels, the new charter
is more equitable and fair than the old
one.
"Students have more of a voice under
the new system and are more involved in
the process," he said. "The new charter is
much closer to the legal system because
students are now judged by their peers."
The new judicial charter is completely
different from the previous one, ex
plained Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback.
who chaired the Committee of 15 that rec
ommended the charter last year.
"For one thing, the student body plays
the key role in running the new judicial
system," he said.

"In a system based on the Honor Code,
all parties — but especially students
must be part of the process for it to work."
he said. "For another, students accused ol
violations have a formal process by which
they can protest their innocence."
Under the previous system, students
could choose to have the dean of students
hear their case as opposed to a panel. The
new system requires that all cases be
heard before a judicial panel consisting of
four students and two faculty or staff
members.
" This new process is clearly meant to
be a community process and one which
greatly increases the impact of students,
faculty and staff on the adjudication ol ju
dicial cases," Perkins said.
The new charter also divides up re
sponsibilities in the Judicial Affairs Of
fice. Separate officers now conduct inves
tigations into the alleged violation and ad
vise accused students on the judicial
process.
The judicial officer. Suzanna Mak.
conducts these investigations. She
charges students with violations when ap

propriale and presents the evidence at ju
dicial hearings.
The judicial adviser works with stu
dents and complainants to explain the ju
dicial process and a person's rights.
Under the previous charter, these two
jobs were combined into one.
Lotz said he thinks Mak and Perkins
do a good job of both prosecuting and ad
vising accused students.
"Both officers help students along in
the process." he said, "'and I think stu
dents who have experienced the new
process are pleased with its fairness."
The judicial charter governs alleged vi
olations of the Honor Code, Fundamental
Standard and other rules of student con
duct.
The judicial charter approved last year
was the first new charter since I%K. Criti
cism of the old charter focused on its lack
of student involvement in the decision
making process.
Prior to its passage by the Faculty Sen
ate on May 1.1997. the charter faced crit
ics who argued it still was not fair enough
to students.
