Tenure system works
I he recent uproar about Stanford not
using "affirmative action" in its tenure pro
cess. and thereby not hiring women, is a dis
gusting attempt to try and subvert the one
meritocratic process that ensures that those
professors who will be with us until retire
ment are the best possible. The current sys
tem is fair and consistent with affirmative
action at the student level.
In admissions, affirmative action is
applied as a first step to eliminate biases in
opportunity and thus get the best possible
mix of students. Once at Stanford, howev
er. grades are dependent on merit, not on a
student's race, ethnicity or sex. I and most
other Stanford students would find it insult
ing and demeaning if grades were given on
the basis of race. Imagine a professor giving
out As. Bs and Cs to match the ethnic
makeup of the class.
1 enure is much like a pass /no credit
course. Individuals have been admitted to
or hired by Stanford with affirmative action
used to eliminate external biases. Once

within Stanford, they must impress the
tenure reviewer by their work and their
achievements. A pass would he the analog
of tenure acceptance. A no credit grade
would be the equivalent of a rejection. The
only difference is that tenure is much more
selective than letter grades.
Just as grades must not be parceled out
on the basis of race, neither must tenure. It
ain't broken — don't screw it up!

Review is not bigoted
Ciod — or Nature if that makes anybody
feel more comfortable — endows different
people with different gifts. The Daily is
endowed with different gifts. Political pun
ditrv is not one of them.
In the May 1 Daily, the opinions cartoon
depicted three members of the Ku Klux
Klan reading The Stanford Review in the
wake of a burning cross. By running this
cartoon on its opinions page. The Daily tac

itly endorses the view expressed in the car
toon. If The Daily believes that The
Review, being conservative, is ipso facto
associated with the KKK, then The Daily
must also prove that the United States
Congress, also run by conservatives, is
secretly being run by the KKK. People —
journalists included — can believe whatev
er they want. Heck, maybe the Easter
bunny is really running Congress.
It seems natural and trite for The Daily
to accuse The Review of espousing views
typical only to members of the KKK — and
The Review just to respond with an
unequivocal, "No." We have a better idea.
L{>ok back at the last five issues of The
Review, the entire volume under our cur
rent editor. Rohan Masilamani. Try to find
one story or sentence that makes The Stan
ford Review look bigoted. If you can prove
that any of the current members of The
Review, let alone the entire paper, have
anything to do with the politics of the KKK.
then you have quite a story to run. Hope
fully, such a story would appeal to the good
sense of enough students and administra
tors that The Review would lose its office
on University property and cease printing.

Sadly for The Daily, it will find no link
between the KKK and this volume of The
Stanford Review. Instead, readers will find
nothing but intelligent and reasonable dis
course unparalleled on the Stanford cam
pus. Recent examples include Candice
Jackson Mayhugh and Nakia Johnson's cri
tiques of campus feminism, Mike Toth's
analysis of Stanford's exaggerated rape
statistics, and Eric Jackson's reasons why
we should not blindly give to the Stanford
Fund. Moreover, they will find hard-hitting
yet fair news coverage of issues often
ignored by The Daily.
Such stories include religious conser
vatism on campus, selective censorship of
student publications by resident fellows,
and why bureaucratic indolence caused a
statue of our Founding Family to languish
in a noisy parking lot for two decades.
Perhaps The Review is doing its job
quite well. For 11 years, The Review has
maintained a strong commitment to indi
vidual rights here on the Farm, in this era of
rampant political correctness and group vic
timization.
Because conservatism is a diverse philos
ophy, we have consistently attracted people

of diverse ideas, all of whom share funda
mental ideals of liberty and equality of
opportunity. As a result, we have always
attracted individuals from all racial and
social backgrounds. If The Review's com
mitment to individual rights is tantamount
to KKK membership, then maybe
Rousseau or Mill were really members of
the KKK.
So that The Daily might save time and
face next time, and avoid confusing the pol
itics of The Review, might we suggest actu
ally reading it? Or better yet, have some
body read it to you.
