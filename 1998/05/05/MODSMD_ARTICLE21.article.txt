# Showering with the boys
## Soggy jeans and swigs of Jack at Big Sur

THIS WEEKEND I got schooled. Big
time. Mother Nature taught my sorry
butt a lesson I will not forget.
In the wake of all the glorious prospective
freshmen and welcoming sunshine. I wanted
to utilize this pre-midterm weekend to its
lullest. My friend and 1 decided to go camp
ing at Big Sur and attempt the 20-mile hike to
the hot springs.
Friday morning we set out in search of
adventure. Although the weather reports
called for rain, 1 figured it was no big deal.
And after the timely Thursday re-opening of
Route One, I figured the Fates were on our
side.
Boy, was 1 wrong.
Admittedly, we got off to a late start. I had
worn through my old hiking boots and it
took a lot of time to find a new pair. We
didn't arrive at the Big Sur base camp until a
little before 5 p.m. By the time we hit the
parking lot it had begun to rain. Slow, fat
drops fell from endless gray skies.
Undaunted, we jumped from the car and

gathered our gear. After filling our water
bottles and packing our food, we set out with
about two hours of light and five miles to
cover.
The first half hour was a bit wet, but not
bad. We tromped over a gentle path, winding
up through the base of the hills.
But soon, life was not looking so nice. The
rain kept falling and we kept walking. Every
little thing that I had forgotten to account for
suddenly became necessary.
First of all, in the rain, it helps to have rain
gear. Not only do jeans absorb water faster
than a sponge, but they do NO T dry well
overnight. Putting on cold, wet jeans first
thing in the morning is about as pleasant as
putting on a cold, wet sports bra.
Then it occurred to me as the gentle hills
turned into two miles of steep grade switch
backs that perhaps this wasn't the ideal way
to break in new boots.
And of course, as our tent began shifting
from side to side on my back, I was thor
oughly sorry that I had brought my little day
pack instead of a full pack with hip straps.

I could have managed most of this if I
hadn't decided to forgo my contacts and
wear my glasses. Unfortunately, the humid
and rainy climate was not conducive to spec
tacle wearing, as there was a continual layer
of fog. And being nearly blind without glass
es is not conducive to taking them off.
But it was getting pretty dark, so it didn't
matter all that much anyway. 1 could hardly
see the one-foot-wide trail, which by the sec
ond hour had become unrecognizable in a
few parts, littered with downed redwixxis.
By the time we hit mile four, I was soaked
head to toe, aching from an unbalanced
pack, blind for all intents and purposes, and
seriously questioning my sanity.
At mile three I remember saying, "Except
for being outdoors, getting exercise and
enjoying the company, this is the most miser
able I have been in years." And, at that
moment I meant it.
But right as I was ready to give up, lie
down on the trail, roll over and die. I smelled
the most beautiful smell in the world: smoke.
I practically ran to the site, where we

found two guys with a fire miraculously blaz
ing in the rain. They took one look at my
sorry state and handed me a large bottle of
Jack Daniels. Nothing has ever tasted sweet
er. Those guys with their fire and liquor were
about the kindest things I could imagine.
Eventually we pitched the tent and made
the best-tasting pasta I have ever consumed.
We put all of our clothes in a wet pile and
curled up in our sleeping bags â€” the only dry
things we had.
The next morning we found our gear and
clothes every bit as saturated as we had left
them. After a look at the still-shadowed
skies, we made the decision to head home
instead of attempting the next 20 miles.
Mission aborted, we trekked home, each
five pounds heavier from added water. Hut in
the patches of sun I saw what I had missed
the night before. The path of loose stones
and dark corners of the night became a
breathtaking trail of curves through the top
of the magnificent green hills and redwood
forests. The light, and clear glasses, brought
out spectacular views, numerous waterfalls

and bright purple wild irises scattered along
the way.
As I hiked home in a ludicrously wonder
ful mood, the complete frustration and
exhaustion of the previous night seemed
worlds away. I had gone from the depths of
despair to the top of the world in 24 hours.
When we finally found our way hack
home 1 took a long shower, indulged at a nice
restaurant, had some wine and slept in a soft,
dry bed. But the comforts of Palo Alto just
didn't measure up to the fire and the
whiskey, the pasta and the tent's shelter.
Spending a miserable night ill-prepared
for the trials of nature made me aware of the
power of simple comforts. And as I started
my next day. dry and rested in the comfort of
my room, just feet away from e-mail and an
answering machine and clean dry socks,
midterms didn't seem that important any
more.
