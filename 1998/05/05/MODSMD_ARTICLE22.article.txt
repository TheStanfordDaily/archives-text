Only after finishing its noncon
ference play can the Cardinal focus
on No 6. USC's visit to Stanford
this weekend and the possibility of
making it to the Pacific 10 Champi
onship series at Washington.
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said the team wouldn't let
angst about this weekend's series
affect its play tonight.
" This team doesn't get real up or
real down," Marquess said. "We're
just going to go to the guys who
didn't throw [against Arizona
State]. We'll give those guys some
work."

Like many of the Tuesday
games so far this season. Marquess
might use tonight's matchup to ex
periment. With the USC series fol
lowed immediately hy postseason
play, the Cardinal only has a limit
ed amount of time to make mis
takes.
"It's a little hit different when
you get to postseason," Marquess
said.
San Jose State is led hy infielders
Casey Cheshier. who is hatting .353
with eight home runs and 57 RBI,
and Joe Chutuk, who is hatting
.429. Coming off a victory over
Saint Mary's, the Spartans will trav
el to Honolulu for a three-game se
ries with Hawaii after tonight's
game at Sunken Diamond.
On the Cardinal's side, the hats
of sophomore first baseman John
Gall and junior center fielder Jody
Gerut have aided the team's offen
sive performance recently. Gerut,
who leads the team in home runs,
nailed his 16th of the season on
Sunday.
"He's done a great joh for us,"
Marquess said. "He's got big-time
power. He has worked hard and
gotten stronger."
Although the teams play in dif
ferent conferences, Stanford and
San Jose State will be meeting for
the second time this season. In an
