■ Saturday: Stanford won the Western Women's
Lacrosse League championship by defeating UC-
Davis 10-8.

The Cardinal jumped two slots from last year's
third-place league finish with the win over UC-Davis.
"We went from third place last year to first this
year. It feels great," said head coach Heidi Connor.
"It just goes to show that all of our hard work paid off.
These girls put a lot of time and energy into making
themselves into a championship-caliber team."
Stanford entered the league's Final Four in San
Diego last weekend as the No. 1 seed from the north
ern division. The pool of teams was completed by
Davis at No. 2 in the North and the No. 1 and 2 seeds
from the Southern division, Arizona and UC-Santa
Barbara, respectively.
Saturday pitted the first and second seeds from
the opposing divisions to determine the matchup for
Sunday's finale. Stanford took on the Santa Barbara
Gauchos in what turned out to be a bigger blowout
than the halftime score predicted.
The game was tied at eight points apiece at the
half. But Stanford came out charged in the second —
a move the team would make its trademark for the
entire weekend — and finished the game with a com
manding 19-12 win.
Junior goalkeeper Stephanie Tuerk came up with
13 saves in 25 shots to help the Cardinal shut the Gau
chos down. Sophomore Hedy Born and senior Dara
Kaplan were both in usual high form, combining to
