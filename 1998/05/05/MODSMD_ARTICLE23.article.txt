WOMEN'S LACROSSE

■ Saturday: Stanford won the Western Women's
Lacrosse League championship by defeating UC-
Davis 10-8.

The Cardinal jumped two slots from last year's
third-place league finish with the win over UC-Davis.
"We went from third place last year to first this
year. It feels great," said head coach Heidi Connor.
"It just goes to show that all of our hard work paid off.
These girls put a lot of time and energy into making
themselves into a championship-caliber team."
Stanford entered the league's Final Four in San
Diego last weekend as the No. 1 seed from the north
ern division. The pool of teams was completed by
Davis at No. 2 in the North and the No. 1 and 2 seeds
from the Southern division, Arizona and UC-Santa
Barbara, respectively.
Saturday pitted the first and second seeds from
the opposing divisions to determine the matchup for
Sunday's finale. Stanford took on the Santa Barbara
Gauchos in what turned out to be a bigger blowout
than the halftime score predicted.
The game was tied at eight points apiece at the
half. But Stanford came out charged in the second —
a move the team would make its trademark for the
entire weekend — and finished the game with a com
manding 19-12 win.
Junior goalkeeper Stephanie Tuerk came up with
13 saves in 25 shots to help the Cardinal shut the Gau
chos down. Sophomore Hedy Born and senior Dara
Kaplan were both in usual high form, combining to

score 10 goals.
The real test for Stanford came
in the championship game Sunday.
The Cardinal played a tough match
against division rival Davis, who
had downed Arizona the day he
fore.
"This Stanford-Davis rivalry
grows with each year." Connor said.
"This was an emotionally charged

game. On any given day, it's hard to
tell who will come out with more
will to win.... Sunday, it was Stan
ford."
But the Aggies were not going to
concede anything to the Cardinal as
they looked to avenge a regular
season loss at Stanford's hands ear
lier this year.
Davis came out quickly in the
first half and appeared to have the
game plan necessary to stop Stan
ford short. After the first half, Stan
ford was down bv a score of 6-2.

"After we went down so badly in
the first half, I was really question
ing whether or not we would be able
to battle back against a four-goal
deficit," Connor said.
The Cardinal did battle, holding
Davis to only two second-half goals
while adding eight points of its own
for a final score of 10-8. Stanford
was able to shut down the Aggies'
offensive threats and get back into
form for the last 30 minutes.
"After we scored the first goal of
the second half," Kaplan said. "I

knew that we were going to win,
that we were capable of coming
back."
Stanford came away from half
time with two quick goals. By the
last nine minutes, the score was tied
at eight.
The real turning point was a
breakaway goal by sophomore at
tacker Gaby Duno. Born came up
with a steal from an overthrown ball
by the Aggie goalie. A quick pass to
Duno and a 30-meter sprint to the
goal gave the Cardinal the lead —

one it wouldn't lose again.
Stanford came up with the draw
on the restart and remained in the
driver's seat.
The defense was great in the sec
ond half, not only holding Davis to
only two goals but forcing
turnovers as well. Tuerk played an
outstanding game in the second
half, allowing the Cardinal come
back. For her efforts in the tourna
ment, Tuerk was named defensive
MVP.
The Stanford team has made the

league championship a goal for the
entire season. The close games last
weekend in San Diego attest to the
strength of each of the teams pre
sent.
Stanford is trying to show that
the caliber of lacrosse in the West is
ready to rival that of the Eastern
schools and is now in a position to
move ahead. Stanford should be a
strong team in the years to come, as
most players will return.
Only one player, Kaplan, will be
bidding the team farewell.
