WOMEN'S RUGBY

â–  Last weekend: Stanford won the
Women's National Collegiate
Rugby Plate Division champi
onship. defeating Dartmouth 34-5
in the semifinal and Illinois 26-0 in
the title game.

The Cardinal topped Illinois 34-
5 for the title after claiming an easy
26-0 victory over Dartmouth earli
er in the weekend.
"Our win still hasn't set in." said
junior inside center Heather
Smith, "hut it is starting to."
The Fighting lllini proved to he
the tougher opponent for the Car
dinal but not by much. Illinois uti
lized its fast runner to force the

Stanford team to play hard during
the first half. The team's bigger
players tried to take advantage of a
sore and tired Card with hard hit
ting and tackling.
But nothing could break the
Stanford women.
Everything they worked on
during the season came together
against Illinois. Each player sacri
ficed her body to finish the play,
embodying the team's slogan of
"Guts on the deck" out on the field.
The more experienced Stanford
scrums played at top caliber with
low tackles to bring their bigger op
ponents to the ground. Stanford's
front row ripped apart Illinois' de
fense by setting fast breaks, fixing
the defenders, taking advantage of
any open gaps and handling the ball
well.
Unlike Illinois, Stanford suf

fered a very low turnover rate as its
high-pressure defense forced
turnovers.
Stanford went up early in the
first 10 minutes with a lead of 10-0.
By the end of the first half, the Card
was already sealing its claim to the
national title with a 24-0 lead.
In the second half, Stanford re
turned to put away a worn out Illi
nois team despite its own exhaus
tion. In the bottom quarter, the
Fighting Illini rallied together to
score five points, but it was too lit
tle, too late.
Before Illinois, the Cardinal had
a meeting Saturday in the semifi
nals against Dartmouth. The match

was anticipated to he a close one as
the Big Green has the same speed
and playing style as the Card with
slight size advantages. What this
meant for the Card was a loss of its
greatest edge, speed, combined
with a tackling disadvantage.
The first 40-minute half against
Dartmouth was back and forth with
hard playing on both sides. By the
end. the Card was ahead 15-0.
After a short five-minute break,
a re-energi/ed and confident Stan
ford team returned to put Dart
mouth away. Unlike Stanford, the
Big Green was already completely
worn down by the first quarter.
Stanford played a superb mental

game with patience on both the of
fensive and defensive games. Each
time Stanford scored, Dartmouth's
lack of confidence showed more
and more. The team's exhausted
performance on the field increased
with each passing moment.
Ironically, Dartmouth's speed
actually worked in the opposite di
rection for the Big Green.
Stanford was able to adapt to
Dartmouth's speed and similar
style of play and capitalize on it in a
way the Big Green couldn't. The
Card controlled the tempo in the
second half and had no trouble bag
ging Dartmouth with a final score of
26-0.

"It was a real momentum builder
for us," Smith said. "With all the
hype preceding this game, we were
expecting a close match and real
ized that we could actually lose to
this team. So beating Dartmouth re
ally let us know that we were good."
Junior hooker Sara Dwight led
the Stanford defense with aggres
sive ruck and back line support.
Sophomore flanker Biasha
Mitchell stepped up her level of
play as well, always managing to be
at the right field position at the right
time and exhibiting reliable field
movement.
Smith and freshman outside cen
ter Brittnev Blunt read each other's

minds to take advantage of each
gap in the defense.
Throughout both matches, Stan
ford exhibited better field coverage.
With this energy-conserving tactic,
Stanford did not get as worn out as
its opponents as the match dragged
on.
Add to this the fact that the Card
proved itself to be a better and
tougher team both mentally and
physically, and the blowout victo
ries were nothing short of being ex
pected.
Senior fullback Susie Hoffman,
junior prop Susan Landsittel and
Blunt, a rookie to rugby, were
named All Americans.
