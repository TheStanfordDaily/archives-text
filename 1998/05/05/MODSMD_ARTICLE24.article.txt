in the semifinal and Illinois 26-0 in
the title game.

The Cardinal topped Illinois 34-
5 for the title after claiming an easy
26-0 victory over Dartmouth earli
er in the weekend.
"Our win still hasn't set in." said
junior inside center Heather
Smith, "hut it is starting to."
The Fighting lllini proved to he
the tougher opponent for the Car
dinal but not by much. Illinois uti
lized its fast runner to force the

Stanford team to play hard during
the first half. The team's bigger
players tried to take advantage of a
sore and tired Card with hard hit
ting and tackling.
But nothing could break the
Stanford women.
Everything they worked on
during the season came together
