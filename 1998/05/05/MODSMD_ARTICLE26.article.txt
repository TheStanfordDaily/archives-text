women defeated Kansas. Novice
women defeated Washington State.

The men's team only faeed one
opponent over the weekend. Cal
ifornia. while the women faced
three — Cal. Kansas and Wash
ington State.
The races were the only home
events for Stanford this season.
The C ardinal was victorious in
only two races this weekend, al
though the rowers made some sig
nificant improvements even in the
losses.
The women's varsity, the only
boat to race against the Jayhaw ks,
won by about 10 seconds.
"We are just a stronger crew
than they are," said women's
head coach Aimee Baker.
The other winner on the weck

end was the novice women's
team, which beat Washington
State.
"It was their best race of the
weekend." Baker said.
The Cardinal women's team
lost all three races to Cal but im
proved its times since the two
schools' last meeting.
The women's varsity "lost to
Cal by about half as much as last
time." said sophomore Lauren
Russell. "It's a good sign that we
are catching up."
The women faced their final
opponent, Washington State.
Sunday.
The Cougars also surprised the
Bears Saturday before edging the
Cardinal.
The women's varsity boat fin
ished just four seconds behind
Washington State.
"The weak point in our race
plan was our start." Baker said.
"We know what we need to work
on. and we have two weeks until
Pac-lOs to do start after start."
The men's races against the
Bears were difficult ones for the
Cardinal, but the team's losses
were to a consistent powerhouse
crew squad.
"It is a reality check for us to
see how much of a difference
there is [between Stanford and
Cal]," said freshman Mike Izard.
In each race, Cal jumped to a
lead in the first 500 meters and
continued to build throughout.
A mild to strong headwind ex
isted for the races, which gave the
Bears somewhat of an advantage.
"They have more experience,
so the poor conditions might
have made a difference," Izard
said.
The Cardinal will not race
again before Pac-lOs and needs to
turn in strong performances there
in order to earn a bid to the na
tional championship tournament.
"We're really closing the mar
gin and catching up to Pac-10 op
ponents," Russell said, "so
everyone is really optimistic."
