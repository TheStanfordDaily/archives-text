## National representative describes options for fighting discrimination 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The director of a national advo
cacy fund for women in higher edu
cation discussed yesterday ihc pros
and cons of legal action in fighting
perceived gendei discrimination
on campus.
Patricia Stroud, director of the
American Association for Univer
sity Women's Legal Advocacy
Fund, slopped by Stanford after a
California association convention,
speaking to about 10 students and
professors in a lunchtime meeting
at the Lavs School.
l he association started its Legal
Advocacy Fund in IIASIl l ASl in recogni
tion of the overwhelming costs of
suing a I niversitv lot sex discrimi
nation, Stroud said.
Most of the women aided by the
fund are lighting sexual harass
ment or discrimination in promo
tions or pay.
•Oftentimes, the monetary side
of it was preventing the women
from takinn litigation through to its

conclusion," Stroud said, noting
that women still regularly settle out
of court — a method that often re
sults in winning a monetary award
but losing a job.
And while a lawsuit can force a
university to release important
tenure data, it may not always be
the best route, Stroud cautioned.
At Stanford, rallies and reports
regarding diversity in the professo
riate have drawn nat'onal atten
tion. Stroud said, and keeping the
issues at the forefront is the most
important thing.

People think we've already
achieved equity, but it's not
true.'

"There's a lot of ennui with re
gard to sex discrimination," she
said. "People think we've already
achieved equity, but it's not true."
A positive outcome to legal ac
tion has become less sure. Stroud

said, because of a combination of
relatively conservative judges in
the appeals courts and increasingly
subtle forms of discrimination.
"You may not see those blatant
statements any more," for exam
ple, ones that state that women
aren't capable of certain jobs, she
said.
"What you sec are trends that
keep women oui of high-ranking
positions."
The Legal Advocacy Fund
aided a Stanford professor in a dis
crimination lawsuit in the mid
1980s. Stroud noted. The religious
studies professor, who claimed dis
crimination based on gender and
national origin, settled for $55,000
from the University but didn't keep
a job here.
Stroud's visit yesterday was
prompted by a national effort to
speak out at college campuses, she
said.
Stroud contacted law student
Corinne Sumpter, a member of a
women's group at the Law School,
who organized the meeting.

"I thought it was really impor
tant to get information out there
about what AALJW does,"
Sumpter said. "I think the prob
lems stretch across departments at
this school, and the only way we
can solve some of the problems is
to work together."

What you see are trends
that keep women out of
high-ranking positions.'
— Patricia Stroud

Although the School of Human
ities and Sciences and the School of
Medicine have been criticized most
prominently for failing to give
tenure to enough women and mi
norities. students in other schools
face the same issues, Sumpter said.
Recognizing that something
needs to be changed is a good first
step. Stroud said, encouraging her
audience "as a campus community
to continue to expose the in
equities."
