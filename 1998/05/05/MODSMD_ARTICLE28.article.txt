Several items with an estimated value of
more than $500 were recently stolen from the
Women's Center and the Lesbian. Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center.
Both community centers are located in the
Fire Truck House, with the Women's Center on
the first floor and the LGBCC on the second.
SI RE Escort service is also located on the
first floor of the building but did not report any
items missing.
Two items, an AM / FM CD stereo valued at
$100 and a VCR worth $270. were stolen from
the LGBCC.
Taken from the Women's Center were sever
al one-dav parking permits valued at $78 and a
small refrigerator worth $100.
According to the Stanford Police report, the
thefts ,het>veen the hours of 7 p.m.
April 25 and 9:30 a.m. April 26. They were re
ported to the police last Tuesday.

The timing of the theft was especially unfor
tunate. said education master's student Diana
Swartz. program director for the Women's Cen
ter.
"The refrigerator was donated from Cam
bridge University Press on Friday (before the
burglary)," she said.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. the case is classified as grand theft, as
there was no evidence of forced entry into the
building.
"It looks like they had the code." Niemeyer
said.
The outside doors to each center require sep
arate special entry codes after normal hours of
operation.
The Women's Center is "so open 1 can't
imagine anyone breaking and entering," Swartz
said.
Sophomore Nick Chan, a staff member of the
LGBCC. noted that the weekend of the theft
was especially hectic due to Stanford Admit
V J 'A*
Weekend. The LGBCC served as a late regis

tration site for prospective freshmen on Satur
day night.
"We don't know if it was a volunteer, if it had
something to do with Admit Weekend." Chan
said.
"We don't know if someone left the door
open."
Swartz said someone with entry to the
LGBCC would have easy access to the
Women's Center through the stairway connect
ing the two.
However, she noted that the thief could also
have entered through the Women's Center.
Both community centers have changed their
door entrance codes in response to the thefts
hut are otherwise maintaining normal opera
tional hours.
Niemeyer said that although police dusted
for fingerprints, the investigation has yet to pro
duced either evidence or suspects.
Niemeyer urged anyone with Â£
that would help the case to call the Stanford Po
lice at 723-9633.
