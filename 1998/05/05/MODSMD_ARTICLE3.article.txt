### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Disabled and injured students using
the Disability Resource Center's golf
carts were left in the lurch last weekend
due to vandalism of the DisGo carts.
All three of the center's carts were dis
covered with the ignitions shoved into the
golf carts. One cart also had a broken
front window. The center reported the
vandalism to the Stanford Police, who
were unavailable for comment.
Injured students, permanently dis
abled students and injured faculty mem
bers ride the DisGo carts in order to
move around campus.

"It's critical to have these carts for stu
dents to get to class." said Joan Bisagno.
assistant dean and the center's director.
Sabrina Sabharwal, a junior who uses
her own DisGo cart, also emphasized the
importance of having them available.
"I wouldn't be able to go to any of my
classes without it." she said.
Last year, the carts were used an aver
age of 1.058 times per quarter to trans
port disabled or injured students.
Unfortunately, vandalism and at
tempted theft of the carts is not uncom
mon.
"I've had a few instances where people
have tried to take my golf cart." Sabhar
wal said.

While the center's employees are try
ing to find ways to ensure that vandalism
does not occur again. lack of interior stor
age space for the carts makes that diffi
cult. Currently, the carts are locked up
outside Meyer Library
"They need to be inside somewhere,
but where we could put them is a real
problem." Bisagno explained. "We're
thinking of what to do. but we can't see
any immediate solutions."
The center has managed to get the ig
nitions of the carts working, but repairs
will still be needed. "We're going to have
to send them in for repair and rent some
other carts from the vendor," Bis
agno said.
Each cart costs about $5,000 to
replace.

Bisagno expressed frustration at
the crime and hopes such vandal
ism will not occur in the future.
"I would hope that students will
understand that there's a critical
function for these carts and that
vandalizing them is a really lousy
thine to do," she said.
