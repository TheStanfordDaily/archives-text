# Stats prof elected to Academy of Sciences

### Fei Wu 
Statistics Prof. David Donoho
was elected to the National Acade
my of Sciences on April 28. making
him one of the 60 new members
and 15 foreign associates recog
nized for their "distinguished and
continuing achievements in origi
nal research."
Established in 1863. election to
membership in the academy is con
sidered one of the highest honors a
scientist or engineer can receive.
With his field in theoretical sta
tistics, Donoho's past research in
cludes rates of convergence, which
estimates the amount of data one
needs to obtain a certain degree of
accuracy.
Also working on problems re
lated to practical issues, Donoho's
early interest was in undoing signal
distortions. He said, 'i started
working on this when 1 had a job as
a researcher in seismic prospecting
many years ago. Later. 1 learned it
was connected also to solving prob
lems in mobile communication
such as cellular phones."
Currently interested in image
and signal processing, Donoho and
his colleagues developed tools

named edgelets, wedgelets and
ridgelets, the templates of an image
in order to better represent edges
in an image.
Describing statistics as a field
that analyzes data from many dif
ferent scientific disciplines, Dono
ho said, "One day we may see data
that were collected by as
tronomers. another day data that
were collected by medical re
searchers. For us it's the same
thing: data.
"Statisticians are lucky; we are
like the butterflies that go around
and sample the nectar in all differ
ent flowers, returning to whichever
ones are most beautiful or tastiest,"
Donoho said.
Donoho came to Stanford in
1990 after being a faculty member
at IJC-Berkeley since 1984. He cur
rently teaches two graduate cours
es: Theoretical Statistics and
Wavelets and Beyond.
"You couldn't ask for better
graduate students." he said. "This
makes teaching a lot of fun. The
students really understand and
want to learn quickly."
Emmanuel Candes, a doctoral
student in statistics, has worked
with Donoho for two-and-a-half

years on projection models. "He's
very comfortable with deep math
subjects but also has great concern
with applications," Candes said.
"Probably why he is so famous is
that he's able to translate his think
ing into things people can under
stand."
"He's a genius. What can 1 say?
He's always one to try something
more, always ambitious, always
starting new projects," said Xiaom
ing Huo, a fifth-year doctoral stu
dent in statistics.
"He's also very encouraging,
very capable of giving students
technical details. It's amazing that
somebody could have so much
knowledge," Huo said.
Donoho said he has not been
concerned with recognition, but it
may be good for his family and stu
dents.
He said. "It's good for my fami
ly to see that when I stay at work
late, it's lor work that other people
might notice.
"It's also excellent encourage
ment for the graduate students that
I am advising to see that the field
that they are working in is appreci
ated by the scientific community at
large."
