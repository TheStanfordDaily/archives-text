A Cinco de Mayo celebration in Casa Zapata lounge
today at noon highlights a week of Chicano-themed events
on campus
Cinco de Mayo commemorates the successful Mexican
peasant revolt againsi French tyrant Emperor Maximilian
in 1562.
"It is actually celebrated more here than in Mexico."
said junioi Andres Romero, an ethnic theme associate at
Zapata.
Cecilia Burciaga, currently the special assistant to the
president at Cal State-Monterey Bay, will be the keynote
speaker at the celebration. There will also be a catered
lunch and music.
Cecilia and her late husband, Tony (who painted Zapa
ta's murals). were the resident fellows of Zapata from 1985
to 1994. In Ma\ 1994, Cecilia Burciaga was dismissed from
her position as associate dean of student affairs in what the
University maintained to be t budget-cutting move. At the
time, she was the University's highest-ranking Chicana ad
ministrator.
Some students interpreted her dismissal from the Uni
versity as an indication <>i administrative indifference over
Chicano issues, which included serving grapes farmed by
migrant workers and proposed budget cuts for El Centro
( hii .UK \fter a Sunday Flicks audience shouted racial
slurs while iewing a film about migrant farm workers, ac
n\ isis si;Â»ge<i i hunger strike.
Al'tei 'out students fasted for three days, the strike
ended when ' 'niversitv President Gerhard Casper and
Provost t omloli ezza Rice signed an agreement promising
the administration would address important
Chicano / Latino issues.
Burciaga is expected to speak on
the history of Zapata, which she was
instrumental in founding.
Casa Zapata was founded 26
years ago on Cinco de Mayo during
the Chicano movement of the l l )70s,
according to Romero. Casa Zapata
was located in a house on Alvarado
Row until it was mysteriously
burned down and relocated to Stern.

Sunday afternoon Zapata hosted
a Spanish Catholic mass, with the
Ballet Folklorico and an address by
Martin Valadez, a history doctoral
candidate. He talked to the audience
of about 50 students on how C'hi
canos at Stanford have the responsi

bility of being leaders in the Catholic
and Latino community.
On Thursday from 7 to 8:30 p.m.,
