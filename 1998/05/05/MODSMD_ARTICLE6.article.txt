For a child spending his formative
years in ghettos and concentration camps,
the Holocaust provided an "alternate ed
ucation," survivor Zev Kedem told about
300 people at Kresge Auditorium last night.
In a speech sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, Kedem described his
childhixxl in Poland in the 19305, which

was disrupted by the German invasion.
Horn in 1934. Kedem spent a decade in a
ghetto in Cracow and at the Plasov and
Auschwitz concentration camps. He
briefly worked in ()skar Schindler's 112 acto
ry. made famous in Steven Spielberg's
1904 movie "Schindler's List."
After remaining silent for 50 years,
Kedem began speaking about his Holo
caust experiences after seeing the movie,
on which he advised Spielberg.

it freed me from my silence and pro
vided me with a new language." he ex
plained.
lVior to finding that freedom. Kedem
refrained from breaking his silence even
to his children. Silence, he said, was one of
the first lessons he learned in World War
II — after his grandfather reprimanded
him for complaining tixi loudly while they
were hiding in an attic pigeon coop in Cra
cow in order to avoid deportation.

At that point, "1 had to internalize all
the fears, angers, whatever they were."
Kedem said "It was a lesson of silenee
that stayed with me tor my concentration
camp years and the next 50"
Kedem's mother eventually bribed an
acquaintance to sneak him into the Plaso\
camp even though children below 13 were
not considered to be ol value to the Na/ts
There, he worked in a brush factory,
sitting on a box to make him look
more grown up and producing too
many products for anyone to com
plain.
The factory window offered a
view of a hill where regular execu
tions took place, Kedem said — a cal
culated move on the Nazis' part to
demonstrate to the workers "the
privilege of slavery and their absolute
authority."
"To shoot someone now was like
to swat a fly. You had been complete
ly dehumanized."
One day, Kedem was confronted
by a Nazi commandant, who ques
tioned his usefulness at such a young
age. The 9-year-old talked himself
out of the apparent trap.
Surviving situations like that "was
actually beating a totally corrupt sys
tem, like winning big at Las Vegas,"

Kedem said. And as a child, he said
he was, in a way, more fortunate than
the adults because he had no illusions.
"The individual had only one
hope, and it consisted of a piece of
bread every day and a bowl of watery
soup," he said.
As the Russian army approached
Plasov, the camp was evacuated to
Auschwitz. Schindler saved many of
his employees by claiming he needed
them at a fictional ammunition facto
ry in Czechoslovakia, but Kedem and
four other boys were discovered and
sent back to Auschwitz.
From there, he was evacuated
once again on a forced death march
further into German territory. The
war ended for Kedem on May 3.
1945, when the U.S. Army liberated
Mauthausen. He recalled that realiz
ing his freedom took a while to set in.
"Their uniforms were different,
but my imagination couldn't grasp
that they were anything but Ger
mans." Kedem said.
Then he saw a black soldier. "1 re

alized that no black soldier could he
in the fanatical Nazi army," he said.
An army unit setting up displaced
persons camps adopted Kedem after
he spent a few months wandering
around and desiring only shelter,
food and his life. He later studied
briefly at Oxford University and then
married and moved to Israel, where
he worked as an environmental engi
neer and made documentaries about
Jerusalem's Old City.
The fanaticism he saw in the Nazis
has not left his memory — nor has it
disappeared from the world, Kedem
told the crowd. He now speaks about
his own experience in part to memo
rialize the 1.5 million children killed
in the Holocaust, he said.
But in light of recent ethnic fight
ing in Bosnia. Rwanda and other
countries, Kedem said he hoped his
story also would convince people to
take action to "minimize the repeti
tions of holocausts that have gone on
since then.... It seems to be part of
the human condition."
