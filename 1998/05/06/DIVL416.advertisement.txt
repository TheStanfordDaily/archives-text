Congratulations, Julia Stamps, 1997-98 Honda Award Nominee. She has been chosen as one of the nation's leading
NCAA athletes. Beyond athletic performance, each woman is recognized for academic achievement and community
involvement. A donation is made to her school's general scholarship fund to support future women athletes. This year,
we're proud to honor Julia for her many accomplishments. And encourage her to take a well-deserved break.
