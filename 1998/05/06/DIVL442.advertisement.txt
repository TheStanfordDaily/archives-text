is hiringl!
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA: Alyanza Software LLC today announced it is
ramping up on its efforts to develop, market and support a suite of 100%
Java applications designed to improve resource utilization and
information flow within large service organizations. The suite includes
modules to capture, process and analyze operational activities such as
employee time, expense reports, project budgeting, planning and
management.
Alyanza, founded in June 1997 by two fellow Stanford CS students â€”
Mike "Iceman" Hoefer and Felipe "Flippy" LLoreda, and a Stanford
second-year MBA student, Jay Goldin, is looking for bright developers to
help us implement our suite of Java applications, have a great time and
live the startup experience.
We are looking for smart, intriguing, self-motivated, and creative young
minds that want to work full-time and for the summer in a virgin startup
environment. The compensation is competitive, great stock option
plans as well as free soda, drinks and food, and a healthy and
international work environment (hey, got customers in Mexico
already...). It's an opportunity to go as far as you want to go, as fast as you
may ... you set the limits.
The founders will be having a presentation session at 7 p.m. Thursday in
Tresidder's Sequoia Room. Come see the product, hear the founders talk,
drop your resume and pick up some chow and drinks.
