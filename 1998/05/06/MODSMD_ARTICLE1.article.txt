# 50 students already declared majors
## CSRE to hire prof in Chicano Studies 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Almost 50 students have already declared majors in
the Program in Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity.
The program has grown dramatically since its incep
tion in early 1997. Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven initially announced the interdisciplinary pro
gram's creation in February 1995.
Program director A 1 Camarillo also said yesterday
that the History Department has recommended a Chi
cano studies scholar for hire.
Shoven in 1995 had promised funding for two profes

sors, based in existing departments, who would specialize
in ethnic studies. The Political Science Department hired
Carolyn Wong in 1996 to teach Asian American studies
courses, but the search for a Chicano studies professor
has hit several roadblocks.
Shoven said he is pleased with the success of the pro
gram — which allows students to major in comparative
race and ethnic studies or in Chicano, Asian-American,
African-American, Native American or Jewish studies.
The program's quick growth makes him "'very happy,"
Shoven said, adding that he expects it to expand further.
Having 50 majors makes CSRE one of Stanford's


Shoven
more popular majors. Thirty-three
of those majors are concentrating on
comparative ethnic studies, said Ca
marillo, a history professor.
Seven or eight students have
placed their emphasis on each of
Chicano and Asian American Stud
ies, while Native American studies
has attracted one student, Camarillo
said. Stanford's Program in African
and Afro-American Studies just re
cently joined CSRE, so only majors
declared since the merger are count
ed in the program's total.
Camarillo said no students have
yet chosen to concentrate on Jewish
studies. Prior to the creation of
CSRE, the Program in Jewish Stud
ies only offered an honors program
and coterminal program for under
graduates.
The ethnic studies program grew
out of 25 years of activism on the
Stanford campus. Although the
University established African
American studies in the late 19605, it
only expanded into Chicano, Asian
American and Native American
studies after a series of explosive
protests during the 1993-94 school
year.
In the spring of 1994, four Chi
cana students fasted for three days,
demanding a Chicano studies de
partment, among other requests.
Around the same time, several
members of Stanford's Asian-
American community disrupted a
Faculty Senate meeting to ask for a
department focusing on their history
and current issues.
Out of the protests grew several
committees, which eventually rec
ommended the new program in
1995.

The students majoring in the pro
gram are a "wonderful group of mo
tivated, young scholars who are par
taking of many, many opportunities
that we are providing them," Ca
marillo said. "We've already created
what we consider a very special
major."
Students majoring in CSRE say
the program is attractive for a vari
ety of reasons.
Sophomore Yolanda Anyon
said she chose CSRE because of an
interest in civil rights and the dis
proportionate effect of poverty on
minorities. But the biggest benefit
she has found in the program comes
from its individualized attention.
"I've just had a really wonderful
experience, not just because of the
classes but more because of the peo
ple," she said, noting that the pro
gram hosts sessions each quarter to
hear feedback from students.
Anyon, whose focus is on com
parative ethnic studies, said advising
is a big focus in the program, offering
her more attention than most of her
friends find in their respective ma
jors.
Senior Jennie Kim, a double
major in Asian American studies
and psychology, agreed.
"The best aspect of the program
is the personal attention the students
get," she said.
Both emphasized, however, that
the University needs to increase its
support of the program in order to
keep its quality high.
"I think in order to grow and
meet the needs of the students, the
program needs more support in
terms of hiring more professors, who
will then be able to offer more class
es," Kim said.
Camarillo said he doesn't antici
pate funding for any additional pro
fessors.
