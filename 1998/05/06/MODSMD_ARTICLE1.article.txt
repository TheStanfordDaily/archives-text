# 50 students already declared majors
## CSRE to hire prof in Chicano Studies 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Almost 50 students have already declared majors in
the Program in Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity.
The program has grown dramatically since its incep
tion in early 1997. Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven initially announced the interdisciplinary pro
gram's creation in February 1995.
Program director A 1 Camarillo also said yesterday
that the History Department has recommended a Chi
cano studies scholar for hire.
Shoven in 1995 had promised funding for two profes

sors, based in existing departments, who would specialize
in ethnic studies. The Political Science Department hired
Carolyn Wong in 1996 to teach Asian American studies
courses, but the search for a Chicano studies professor
has hit several roadblocks.
Shoven said he is pleased with the success of the pro
gram â€” which allows students to major in comparative
race and ethnic studies or in Chicano, Asian-American,
African-American, Native American or Jewish studies.
The program's quick growth makes him "'very happy,"
Shoven said, adding that he expects it to expand further.
Having 50 majors makes CSRE one of Stanford's
