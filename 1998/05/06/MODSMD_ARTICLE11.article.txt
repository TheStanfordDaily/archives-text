# Arab-Israeli stalemate continues

### 
LONDON (AP) — It now takes
two hands to count U.S.-sponsored
Mideast meetings that have ended
without result over the past two
years.
At the latest one yesterday in
London, an exasperated Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright set a
deadline for Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to accept
Washington's compromise propos
al. The plan calls for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from an addition
al 13 percent of the West Bank
beyond the 27 percent already
handed over.
If he agrees by Monday, then
President Clinton is ready to pre
side over the ceremonial launching
of talks between Israel and the
Palestinians on the final phase of

the 1993 Oslo accord — a perma
nent peace agreement, Albright
told a news conference.
If Netanyahu balks, then "we
will have to re-examine our
approach to the peace process,"
Albright said. She did not specify
what the Clinton administration
might do differently, except that it
would not abandon its role as medi
ator.
One option is to make the U.S.
initiative public and openly blame
Israel for the failure of the peace
talks, a step advocated by Palestini
an negotiators.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
already has his ticket to the White
House, having accepted the Ameri
can initiative last month.
Over the next six days, it will be

up to the U.S. special Mideast
envoy, Dennis Ross, and
Netanyahu aides Danny Naveh and
Yitzhak Molcho, to try and resolve
the differences.
It was not clear how Albright
expected mid-level negotiators to
succeed where she had failed, espe
cially with Netanyahu adamant that
Israel could not accept the Ameri
can withdrawal proposal.
"The difficulty arises from a
very simple point. We cannot com
promise on Israeli security,"
Netanyahu told reporters before
returning to Israel. "We have not
resolved the territorial issue of the
further redeployment."
Israel's best offer has been a
withdrawal from 9 percent of the
West Bank, provided the Palestini

ans make a better effort to combat
Islamic militants who have carried
out more than a dozen suicide
bombings in Israel since 1994.
Israeli officials have said
Netanyahu might raise his offer to
11 percent.
Back in Israel, Netanyahu faces
threats from far-right lawmakers
who say they will bring down his
government if he hands any land to
the Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
The legislators have the power to
break up his coalition.
With his political survival at
stake, the Israeli leader seems more
inclined to defy Washington than
his coalition partners. He apparent
ly is taking a gamble that the Clin
ton administration will not seek an
open confrontation with Israel.
