### 
NEW YORK (AP) — What's
good for Microsoft is good for
America.
So sayeth Bill Gates.
In a pro-Microsoft event laced
with patriotic superlatives, the
software maker's chairman argued
yesterday that any attempt to
block the mid-May release of its
new Windows 98 software would
hurt "the most vibrant industry in
the economy."
"It would be like telling GM
they cannot come out with any
new cars this fall," Gates told

reporters amid speeches from fel
low high-tech leaders and a
demonstration of Windows 98's
features.
"No industry is doing more to
move America forward."
The splashy event orchestrated
by Microsoft was part of a last
ditch effort to sway antitrust offi
cials from taking action that would
delay the software's mid-May
release.
More than 50 representatives of
the computer industry showed up,
including the heads of Compaq,

the largest personal computer
maker, and CompUSA, the
biggest chain of computer stores.
But the event in some ways
gave Microsoft's critics more
ammunition to argue that the com
pany's dominance in the technolo
gy industry has grown too great.
Sen. Orrin Hatch. R-Utah, who
is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and held hearings ear
lier this year into Microsoft's busi
ness practices, accused the Red
mond, Wash., company of twisting
executives' arms.

"I cannot help but wonder how
many of these executives are on
that stage because they truly want
to be," Hatch said on the Senate
floor yesterday
"It strikes me as curious that it
was only after calls from Microsoft
that many of these individuals saw
fit to sign letters and make public
appearances."
The event widened the fault
lines in the debate over what
action, if any, should be taken
against the world's largest maker
of personal computer software.
