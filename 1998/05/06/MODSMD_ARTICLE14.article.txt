MOSCOW (AP) — Pledging to
streamline Russia's bureaucracy.
President Boris Yeltsin said yester
day the country's new government
would be half the size of its prede
cessor. but would have more auton
omy.
"There will be a serious restruc
turing. such as we've never had
before," Yeltsin promised, accord
ing to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko met yesterday to
decide on the last appointments to
the Cabinet. Last week, 20 Cabinet
members were named.
Russia's interim government
has been handling only routine
business since Yeltsin abruptly
dismissed Premier Viktor Cher
nomyrdin and his Cabinet on
March 23 for failing to produce
tangible economic and social
progress.
At the same time, Yeltsin
announced he had signed a decree
authorizing Kiriyenko to make
decisions without consulting the
president. Yeltsin spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the
Cabinet's new powers "significantly
exceed the powers of the previous
Cabinet."
"Now. Premier Sergei

Kiriyenko will sign the decree and
that will be it. From now on. the
government will bear responsibility
for its decrees." Interfax quoted the
president as saying.
In addition to some new faces,
the new government will also have
a different structure. Yeltsin said
the new system will have fewer
ministries handling a greater work
load.
The purpose of the changes is
"to simplify the administrative
decision-making chain, eliminate
unnecessary links in the bureau
cratic apparatus," Yastrzhembsky
said.
"In total, the government appa
ratus will decrease by half. Yeltsin
said, according to Interfax news
agency.
Last week. Yeltsin and
Kiriyenko reappointed several
members of the former Cabinet,
including prominent economic
reformer Boris Nemtsov, and
brought in a few new people.
Yeltsin made one new appoint
ment yesterday, naming chief of the
state land committee Ilya
Yu/hanov as Russia's new minister
for land policy, construction and
residential issues, Yastrzhembsky
said.
