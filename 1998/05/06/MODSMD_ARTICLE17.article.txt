Athletics Department
should help curb negative
perceptions about hostesses

IN SPIKE LEE'S new movie, "He
Got Game," the lead character
takes a recruiting trip to Tech Uni
versity, where his host shows him
around campus. During his visit, he is
approached by vivacious co-eds who
try to persuade him to join Tech's pro
gram "by any means necessary."
At Stanford, the Department of
Athletics does not support such
attempwJUuUits hostesses pro
gram coulch^ c percc;ved as a cousin of
these salacious programs. If the Ath
letics Department shares our view that
such an image is repugnant, then it
might want to take a good look at its
recruitment policies to ensure that it is
not casting such a perception.
Every year, close to 1(X) potential
football recruits tour the campus. Dur
ing their visits, the recruits enjoy a
number of perks, including a two-hour
campus tour on a golf cart with their
parents and a Football Hostess. This
tour allows the recruit and his parents
to see the campus and talk with a
"Stanford woman" about her perspec
tive on life at the University. Both the
recruit and the parents are able to get
the attention they deserve, outside of

the regimen of the try-out "interview."
After the two-hour tour, the hostess'
job is over.
On the surface, the hostess role
does not resemble the pictures painted
in typical recruitment folklore. But
certain aspects of the football hostess
es program make it seem strikingly
similar to the offerings at other
schools.
Only women are selected for the
program, and no men are offered the
chance to be escorts. This leads to the
concern that women are relegated to
positions of servitude. The fact that the
recruitment for the football hostesses
happens through specialized networks
(i.e. sorority sisters, friends of friends.)
leads to a perception that the program
is exclusive. Having a specialized pro
gram for only the football team and
not for other teams adds even more
fuel to the fire.
To help dampen these flames and
quench the perceived impropriety, the
Athletics Department should consider
modifying the football hostesses pro
gram. One option is to utilize the Stan
ford tour guides as a resource. These
outgoing, knowledgeable Stanford stu
dents would be more than happy to
answer recruits' questions. The tour
guide program would benefit signifi
cantly from additional revenues and
the Athletics Department would fend
off any additional negative percep
tions.
