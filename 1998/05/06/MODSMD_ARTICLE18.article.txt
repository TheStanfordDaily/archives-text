Honor Israel's birthday
I was disheartened by the biased and
uneducated, views expressed by Aly Rem
tulla in his column. "An anniversary not to
celebrate." Remtulla expresses concern
over Israel's 50th anniversary because of
the suffering associated with the nation's
existence.
Israel's past has been marred by point
less wars and deaths. This is why thou
sands of Jews worldwide commemorated
Yom Hazikaron on the day preceding the
anniversary. Yom Hazikaron is the day of
remembrance for those who perished so
needlessly in the Middle Eastern struggle.
Remtulla asks us to consider, "How
successful has Israel been?" The fact that
Israel is flourishing is a reason to cele
brate. On the day that Palestine was split
into a Palestinian half (now Jordan) and a
Jewish half (now Israel), five countries
ruthlessly attacked the infant nation.
Four more times, war was declared on
Israel. Despite these and other efforts by
fundamentalists to eradicate the Jewish
homeland, Israel is still a home for Jews,
who have been persecuted worldwide
wherever Jews are perceived as foreign
ers. This is what Israel's anniversary is
about — celebrating the continued exis
tence of a minority nation.
In 50 years. Israel has turned a barren
desert into a modern nation with a thriv
ing economy. Israel is home to 5 million
Jews who live there free of persecution.
Israel airlifted thousands of Ethiopians to

safety during Ethopia's civil war, rescued
people from Bosnia, and has absorbed
countless penniless Russian immigrants.
Israel is an inspiration to other nations.
This article was only one example of
Remtulla's pessimism. In a previous col
umn, "Neocolonialism for the nineties,"
Remtulla criticized President Clinton for
his visit to Africa, postulating that Clinton
was starting a new relationship of
exploitation and neocolonialism.
Being African myself, I was proud of
Clinton's brave attempt to improve condi
tions in Africa — a continent in desperate
need of help.
Remtulla's only justification for his
bizarre theory was that Clinton was
accompanied by businessmen.
Economic development is needed in
Africa. How better to do it than with for
eign investment? African countries crave
American businessmen
Mr. Remtulla, a few words of advice.
Your articles focus on negativity. You see
problems in situations most would praise.
There is a lovely saying that goes: "Look
for the bad and you will find it. Look for
the good and you will find it." In future
columns, I urge you to look for the good.

Dollies are retrograde
After reading the article on the new dol
lies on May 4, I was fairly impressed by

them. They come across as intelligent, tal
ented, hardworking and respectable. But I
still have a hard time respecting the insti
tution they're joining.
I first thought about the dollies at a
women's basketball game my freshman
year. Watching the players and the crowd,
I was impressed that, in the gender-imbal
anced world of athletics, I was seeing a
women's sports team that was admired
and taken seriously by both male and
female fans. The event exemplified an
absence of gender stereotyping and dis
crimination — almost.
Because then there were the dollies.
Five attractive women in tight leotards
and short skirts, flaunting their bodies for
the entertainment of the audience. Of
course, the women were talented dancers.
Still, if the purpose of their presence
was to showcase their talent and their art,
why weren't there men among them? Why
were their outfits so tiny? Why did so
much of their performance involve show
ing off their shapely legs? Why, for good
ness sake, were they called "dollies"? The
name invites suspicion. Their function
confirms it.
Last year's dollies were good perform
ers, and I'm sure this year's are too. All
the same, the institution reeks of exploita
tion. While it's a relatively benign sort of
exploitation, it's a lot less than could be
hoped for in this "enlightened"' age.
As respectable as the new dollies seem,
I don't understand how any woman who
takes herself seriously could take part in
an institution that presents a group of

women as cute, sexually appealing and lit
tle more.
Women are making marked progress in
their efforts to be recognized for their
intelligence and their athletic ability. So
why would anyone choose instead to be
seen as a "dollie"?

Protest exploitation
This week many American corporations
are having their annual shareholder meet
ings to discuss policy for the upcoming
year. Among them are ARCO and
Freeport McMoßan. Both corporations
have strong ties to Stanford.
ARCO continues to support the brutal
military dictatorship in Burma. ARCO is
also a large donor to Stanford — go check
out the beautiful ARCO Courtyard in
Green Earth Sciences.
To protest ARCO's presence in
Burma, activists from 25 nations (includ
ing members of Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford) are participating in
a three-day fast.
Freeport is the purveyor of massive
environmental and cultural destruction in
Indonesia. In addition to Freeport\s dona
tions and Stanford's heavy investment in
Freeport, one of Freeport's Board mem
bers (Ward Woods) is also a member of
Stanford's Bo?rd of Trustees.

Two members of SEAS are currently at
the Freeport shareholders meeting as part
of a larger effort to call attention to
Freeport's egregious abuses and Stan
ford's responsibility for them.
While these are two highly visible
examples, Stanford's corporate connec
tions run deep. Check out the World Wide
Web site http://corporate.stanford.edu.
President Casper, hiding behind the
veil of institution, has repeatedly claimed
that the University cannot take political
stands on issues such as these.
Yet Stanford is already taking a politi
cal stand by supporting ARCO, Freeport
and others. Stanford is not only complicit
in, but is also actively benefiting from, the
actions of these corporations. These
actions contradict the stated goals of the
University because they are unjust, impe
rialist and racist.
Actions speak louder than words. What
is Stanford teaching us?
