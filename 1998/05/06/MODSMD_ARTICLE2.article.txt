### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Police arrested La Casa Italiana's former financial
manager yesterday for allegedly embezzling $2(MXX) to
$23,000 of last year's house funds.
Jeremy Smith, a senior and the La Casa Italiana's fi
nancial manager for the 1997 winter and spring quarters,
is now in the Santa Clara County Jail. His hail is set at
$100,000.
Senior Amanda F "lin. the current La Casa Italiana
financial manager, was the first to notice financial prob
lems early this fall.
"When 1 took over the position, I noticed some things
that concerned me," Bardin explained. "I took it to
[Asst. Director of Student Management] Laurette Bee-

son. and at that time, it became a joint investigation.''
According to Stanford Police Capt.Raoul Niemever.
Student Management became suspicious when Smith
refused to turn over the house financial records. "They
investigated the fact that he wouldn't turn over the
books and he couldn't account for these funds,"
Niemeyer said.
At that point. Beeson turned the investigation over
to the Stanford Police.
"Det. Allen James [discovered that he] had been co
mingling a lot of these moneys with his personal ac
count," Niemeyer reported.
Smith was still supposed to be financial manager this
fall, but, according to Bardin. "due to some personal is-
sues, he wasn't able to come back as
financial manager." Instead, he de
cided to live off campus in Mountain
View.
"The whole process has been dif
ficult — dealing with one of your
peers," Bardin said.
The house staff was informed of
the investigation, but. according to

Bardin. it is likely that not everyone
in the house knows about it since it
concerned last year's finances.
"We've had a very financially
sound house this year," Bardin em
phasized.
La Casa Italiana houses 47 stu
dents, and its average quarterly
room and board ranges from $7(X) to
$1,100.
Coincidentally, Stanford Police
arrested another Stanford student
on their way to pick up Smith.

Aleksandr Ciamburg, a 23-year
old chemistry master's student, sped
past the police, who were in an un
marked car, swirled into a C'arl Jr's
restaurant and hit one of its signs, ac
cording to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said Gamburg then
flipped the car into reverse and
"hammered it."
After pursuing him for a two or
three blocks, the Stanford Police
turned him over to the Los Altos Po
lice Department for a hit-and-run.
