## Scoring points for road trip fun 
### 
Road trip! two
of the sweetest
sounding words in
the English language. No
one can deny that the
American college experi
ence is incomplete with
out a little road tripping.
So here's a simple point

system for maximizing your Road Trip
Experiences (RTE®). You can compare
with your friends and see wbo has the most
RTE® points. *
Destination: Stanford students have a
plethora of road trip opportunities just wait
ing for them. Go for a quickie to Point
Reyes, Napa or Big Sur, and you'll score a
fine 20 points. That's a good warmup for a
full rager like Los Angeles, Reno, Las
Vegas or the Grand Canyon, which can
score you 40 points a pop. For the more
autophobic, mini-road trips like Gilroy,
Half Moon Bay or the Cowell Cluster score
a point per each person in the car if the car
has at least five passengers.
Transportation: This is key. The ideal is
the old-but-still-running clunker with a big
back seat. But anything with wheels will do.
For bus and train trips, take 75 percent of
the full destination points. However, if you
really want to go for the showcase show
down, you can get double points if you
reach your destination by any of the follow
ing methods: sky diving, cross-country ski

ing, hoverboarding or sailing the Titantic.
Go ahead ... take the physical challenge!
Purpose: Most road trips fall into two
categories. If you went to see the Final Four
in San Antonio, you fit into the first catego
ry: going to watch a big sporting event. Most
other road trips fit into the second genre —
there is no purpose. The important thing is
the chance to collect good stories while
grooving to good tunes.
How many have you road tripped with
only one cassette tapw? It dpesn't matter
how amazing your mix is. Even the most fit
ting songs, like "Interstate Love Song," get
old after 50 plays. If you really want to hear
10 songs over and over, you can always stay
at school and listen to Alice.
Memorabilia: Give yourself 0.2 points
for each road trip photo. Give yourself 0.5
points for any photos displaying new friends
you met on the way. Give yourself a full
point for each photo you wouldn't feel com
fortable showing your parents, BUT sub
tract five points for any activity involving
vomit. Don't worry about the deductions
too much. You can make up a lot of points
by collecting road signs (7 points each — 10
points if in a foreign language).
Run for the border Score a 30 point
BONUS for going international, and give
yourself additional points for each dollar
you spend at Taco Bell. Subtract a point for
each dollar you spend at other (i.e. legiti
mate) eating establishments.

Inside the border On a recent road trip
to Tijuana with some Stanford pals, I came
across a few things I want to warn you
about. Bargaining is a little bit different
there. One night we were walking down the
street and a young girl offered me a free
rose. After I politely refused her initial
offer, she raised her price to 50 cents and
then to $1. I tried hard to contain my laugh
ter.
You will also encounter different tactics
for attracting customers. Along La Avenida
Revoluci6n, men stand outside bars recruit
ing tourists. We tried to politely decline and
continue walking, but one comment was so
disturbing we'll never forget it: "Come in
guys, I'll show you my sister." The surreal
thing is that it happened again in Ensenada
the next day. I guess we looked sketchy.
Finally, there are the little flea markets
that seem like a great place to get some
recuerdos for the friends and family. But we
couldn't help but notice that the trinkets in
Tijuana were identical to the ones we had
seen in Prague and Budapest last summer...
Ever wonder if there's a big factory out in
the hills somewhere that pumps out flea
market jewelry, wall hangings, toys and
purses for distribution at flea markets all
over the world?
