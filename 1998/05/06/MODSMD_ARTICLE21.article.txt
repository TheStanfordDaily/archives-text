# From the fourth dimension
## Kerry Rodgers Defending Sturges: It's art, not kiddie porn 
### 
I THINK I'M becoming unpopular with
my friends. Every time I introduce my
topic du jour, I start getting suspicious
glances from those I consider my confi
dants.
I am not in allegiance with the
Unabomber. But I do side with a very con
troversial figure.
His name is Jock Sturges, and he is a
photographer of considerable acclaim.
However, because his subjects are often
nude and under IS, his work has raised
some eyebrows.
In 1990, his studio was raided by the FBI
and all his work was confiscated on suspi
cion of kiddie porn. A year and a half later,
a grand jury failed to indict him for doing
anything wrong, but he's been walking on
eggshells ever since.
Six months ago the eggshells began to
crack when Randall Terry entered the
scene. Terry is the former head of Opera
tion Rescue and is currently the leader of a
right wing group called "Loyal Opposi
tion." Terry's new group has
been inciting the destruction of "obscene"
photography books, including those by
Sturges.
Yielding to the pressure of Terry and his

gang, courts in Alabama and Tennessee
have indicted Barnes and Noble book
stores for selling obscene materials.
When I relate this news story, I receive
the knee-jerk response: "It's wrong for any
one to take pictures of children nude."
As an artist, I'm inclined to come at this
from the other angle — "It's wrong to cen
sor anyone's art."
True child pornography is unquestion
ably harmful and demented. But what actu
ally constitutes child pornography can get
sticky.
The official definition of kiddie porn is
"visual reproduction of person under 18
years of age involved in obscene acts."
With this in mind, I made my way to the
art library to take a peek at Sturges' con
tested book, "Radiant Identities."
The photographs are mostly of people
on the beach. They're not all nude, and
they're not all adolescents. Many are pic
tures of adults or parents with their chil
dren.
As I was viewing the pictures, I found
myself wondering, what is obscene about a
bunch of people lounging around naked at
the beach?
Certainly the photos are sensual, but

one doesn't need to read Freud to know
that people of all ages are sensual. Why is it
a crime to represent them as such?
To analyze the images, I decided to
employ one of my favorite tactics for dis
cussing controversial issues — to substitute
the loaded component with a tamer
replacement, and reevaluate. I do this with
gender and race issues. For example. 1 ask
myself, what if the actor were a man rather
than a woman, or black instead of white?
In this scenario, I imagined that the sub
jects of the book were all adults. If this
were true, there would be no controversy.
The work in no way resembles adult
pornography.
In his book, Sturges explains that he is
documenting the beauty of the human
body in all of its evolving life stages.
He also notes that most of the pictures
are taken on a "naturist" (a.k.a. clothing
optional) beach in France among friends.
He never asks his subjects to remove cloth
ing. He photographs them only as he finds
them. He never asks his subjects to sign a
model release but instead requests permis
sion every time he intends to use their
images.
His subjects also explain how enjoyable

it is to be photographed by Sturges and
how empowering they find the pictures.
If the subjects aren't complaining, then
what is all the hoopla about?
One of the great concerns is that pho
tographs such as these are fuel for
pedophiles. Terry believes "these are the
tools of child molesters."
I have a hard time when people claim
that deviant or violent acts are caused by a
certain movie, picture or song. Certainly,
pedophiles might get a kick out of this
book. They probably also get a kick out of
pictures of kids in their underwear in the
Sears catalogue. But their sickness isn't
caused by the presence of such things.
People are concerned because they're
afraid the children in the pictures don't
understand the repercussions of their par
ticipation.
We assume that children are short-sight
ed and misguided and will one day grow up
and feel incredible shame when they see
Sturges' book on their in-laws' coffee table.
Remember the embarrassment you felt
when your mom and dad sent a picture of
you in the bath to your dorm RAs for the
"guess whose baby picture this is" day?
Multiply that times a hundred.

The bottom line is that people don't
always know what's best for them. They
have so much developing and growing to do
that a child nudist today may end up being
a prickly prude 10 years down the road.
The logic is that if the subjects might
someday have a problem with the pictures,
they should never have been made.
The emotional life of the subjects is
more important that the photographer's
work. I agree with this basic principle of
emotional health over work. But does it
follow that the slight risk of causing some
one future embarrassment is criminal?
The wisest response to the dilemma
came from a friend who refuses to take
sides on such a complex issue. He thinks no
single position encompasses all the values
he would like to represent.
1 agree. One of the values often over
looked is the value of Sturges' work. Inside
these photos people live in their bodies
openly and free of shame — offering us a
vision of a better world.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of visual art, plans to move to
a nudist colony in southern France after she
graduates. Screw management consulting.
