Column suffered from
anti-Western contempt
Aly Remtulla's rambling Israel-bashing
column suffers from a poor command of
history (the United Nations suggested
Uganda? really!), too many well-worn clich
es, and an incoherent thesis.
The fanciful yarn about how the evil
Anglo-Americans created Israel to oppress
Arabs, Holocaust survivors, Sephardis,
Russian and Ethiopian immigrants alike
held my interest for awhile.
Alas, our author spoiled his story by sud
denly waxing generic ("the exclusion and
oppression that are involved in creating any

nation.")
Having perused some of Remtulla's pre
vious columns, I suspect he was simply dis
tracted from his baleful deconstruction of
Zionism — the most remarkable national
liberation movement of modern times — by
his endemic contempt for all things Ameri
can and Western.

As a 1991 alumnus of Stanford and
Theta Xi, I am writing to discuss the recent

decision to remove the Theta Xi fraternity
from its home at 717 Dolores Street.
My four years at Stanford were a time of
unparalleled learning, personal growth, and
enjoyment. Taxi was the critical link in all of
these areas, and the critical link of Taxi was
the house.
A large part of our fraternal experience
was living together in our home. I was there
in 1989 when we spent most of the school
year out of the house due to the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake.
That year was my most difficult one at
Stanford. I was living away from the friends
1 had come to love and depend on. The fra
ternal experience that year was not on par
with that in the years when 1 lived in the
house.

I want my current and future brothers to
have the experiences that come from living
together at our home on the hill.
University President Gerhard Casper
and the entire University are faced with a
choice in this matter. Allowing the mem
bers to stay in their home will give current
and future generations of students the nch
experiences and friendships with which we
were blessed. No one will be harmed by or
be upset with this decision.
The alternative is to sacrifice the one
thing that hundreds of current and past
members hold most dear, our beloved
home at 717 Dolores Street. Doing this
would deal the current members a devastat
ing blow and would be an enormous loss for
over UXXJ Taxi alumni.

1 implore Casper to make the right
choice. Choose the rich experiences that
Taxi provides over the loss of the one thing
at Stanford that meant the most to my
brothers and me.
