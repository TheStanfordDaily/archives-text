A new test devised by Stanford Medical Center researchers may
allow doctors to better diagnose infections in newborns. Infant
immune systems are often undeveloped at birth, and immediate treat
ment of infections contracted before or during birth is critical to the
newborn's survival.
"Newborns can die within six hours if they are infected," said
Leonore Herzenberg a professor of genetics and senior author of a
paper on the new test that appeared in the Journal of Pediatrics. How
ever, because accurate diagnosis of disease in infants is extremely dif
ficult, doctors often prescribe antibiotics for babies who are not infect
ed.
"In neonates, it's hard to define what is an infection and what is
not," said Yvonne Maldonado, an associate professor of pediatrics
and also an author of the paper,
"You end up treating a lot of children for suspected bacterial infec
tions when in fact they have either a benign viral infection or just vari
ations in their normal behavior," she continued. "This involves a sub
stantial cost in terms of hospital care and antibiotics."
Current tests for bacterial infections in newborns often take days
to yield results. During this time, doctors have no choice but to give
antibiotics to suspect infants and keep them hospitalized.
The new test determines whether or not an infection is present by
determining the levels of another protein, CD lib. CD lib is
expressed on the outside of white blood cells called neutrophils when
the immune response is activated against an infection. Unlike CRP.
however, CDI lb appears within five minutes of exposure to bacteria.
The researchers tested 106 infants suspected of harboring a
pathogen. Of the 106, five babies had bacterial infections that were
confirmed by bacterial culture. All five showed elevated CDI lb lev
els when admitted to the intensive care unit.
Two more were later revealed to have viral infections, and both
showed high CDllb levels, while neither had elevated CRP levels. In
another 17, doctors suspected bacterial infections but could not con
firm that any bacteria was present. Sixteen of the babies had high
CDllb levels, and 15 were later proven to be infected.
Herzenberg suggests that a multicenter trial should be set up to
confirm the results. If CDllb proves to be an accurate harbinger of
infection, testing could become a standard part of hospital protocols.
"A test like this has value in giving doctors more information about
the infants they treat," Herzenberg said.
"The second value may be in cutting down on intensive care admis
sions if we get the predictive values high enough." she added. "And
the third issue is looking at all babies to catch infections that might be
missed."
