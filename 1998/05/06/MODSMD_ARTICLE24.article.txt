# Ancient cities on shaky ground
## Researchers fault earthquakes for civilizations' demise 
### Vijay Rao Contributing writer 
The sudden destruction of
ancient cities has pu/zled
mankind for centuries.
Early explanations attributed
the violent demise of cities to
divine forces. According to the
Bible, Joshua and his followers
brought down the famed walls of
Jericho after blaring their trum
pets for seven days.
Recently, archaeologists and
other scientists have sought to
resolve these mysteries through
scientific or historical explana
tions. Theories attribute the sud
den decline of a city on factors
such as warfare.
These approaches, however,
ignore an enormous factor: earth
quakes. Prof. Amos Nur, chair of
the Geophysics Department, has

performed research suggesting
that many of these cities fell after
experiencing devastating earth
quakes.
Nur believes earthquakes can
help precipitate the destruction of
civilizations vulnerable to attack
by neighboring hostile peoples.
Many of the ancient cities that
inexplicably disappeared. Nur
thinks, may have fallen due to
earthquakes.
Biblical Jericho, for example,
was located in the middle of a
desert, surrounded by hostile
nomadic peoples. Its fabled walls
were its only protection against
the outside world.
Around 1400 8.C., a large
earthquake completely shattered
many of the city walls, leaving it
vulnerable to attack. Archaeologi
cal data and Nur's findings reveal
that the citv sustained extensive

damage. I his allowed besiegers to
capture the town.
Another area of interest to Nur
is the Mediterranean sites where
many ancient civilizations, such as
the Trojans. Mvcaneans, Hittites,
and Assyrians, once flourished. At
the end of the Bronze Age. around
1200 8.C., these civilizations died
out suddenly within a span of 50
years.
Patterns of damage at archaeo
logical sites suggest that a series of
earthquakes hit the area around
this time.
Nur believes these earthquakes
destroyed city walls, leaving the
cities open to attack by hostile
neighbors. Some historians believe
these very natural forces may have
dealt these decaying empires their
final death blow.
In order to prove these theo
ries. Nur and others must look for
scientific clues that prove two
things: first, that the city was actu
ally damaged by an earthquake,
and second, that the damage was
extensive enough that major dis
ruption of daily life occurred. Cer
tain clues prove that an earth
quake occurred and help reveal
the extent of seismic damage.
The most obvious clues are
walls that collapsed in a unit and
neat rows of fallen columns. No
man made destruction could have
replicated the severe damage
caused by earthquakes.
Another clue is patched walls.
Because several earthquakes can
hit an area over a period of time,
constant rebuilding can reveal the
occurence of a series of earth
quakes.
The most definitive proof of
earthquakes are the crushed skele
tons found under collapsed struc

tures. Since earthquakes easily
topple structures, finding crushed
skeletons provides convincing evi
dence that an earthquake once hit
the town.
Nur's research at these ancient
sites has also allowed him to learn
more about the nature of earth
quakes themselves.
In the Mediterranean area, it
appears that a series of earth
quakes hit within a relatively short
period of time.
Nur's data suggest that tectonic
plates may remain "quiet" for a
long period of time and suddenly
unleash a "storm" of earthquakes,
and then become "quiet" again.
T his possibility could apply to Cal
ifornia as well, where potential
earthquake areas have remained
"quiet" so far.
Nur's findings also pertain to an
area of history that still remains an
enigma to us today â€” the Dead
Sea Scrolls. These scrolls were
found about 50 years ago in caves
near the Dead Sea. Many of these
caves are buried under rubble that
suggests an earthquake affected
the area.
Coincidentally, an earthquake
hit the region in 31 8.C.. arounc
the time the scrolls were written
so these scrolls may have been lost
due to this earthquake. Nur pre
dicts that more scrolls are hidden
away in these caves, as many
caves still remain buried under
huge boulders. Nur continues to
visit these sites in hopes of finding
and learning more.
Though some archaeologists
and scientist still view the idea that
earthquakes destroyed ancient
cities with skepticism, evidence in
support of this view continues to
accumulate.
