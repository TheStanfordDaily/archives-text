# Preventing friendly fire:
## T cells distinguish friend from foe 
### Caroline Roberts 
Every minute, cells are viciously
destroying themselves — and each
other — inside your body. With the
efficiency of Navy SEALs, cells of
the immune system, called T cells,
aid in eliminating invading foreign
particles. In this combat theater,
innocent T cells need a way to
shield themselves from crossfire.
Research conducted by postdoc
toral fellow Yasumichi Hitoshi and
Asst. Molecular Pharmacology
Prof. Garry Nolan has uncovered a
unique protein that may protect
immune system cells from them
selves.
Named "toso," after a Japanese
liquor which is drunk ceremonially
to celebrate long life and eternal
youth, the new protein seems to
inhibit programmed cell death, or
apoptosis, when it is produced by
active T cells.
Nolan's research originated

from the observation that T cells
signal other body cells to undergo
apoptosis, yet they themselves
seem resistant to apoptosis.
T cells play a crucial role in
immunity. When a cell is diseased,
it displays bits of the disease caus
ing foreign particle on its surface.
Display of these particles, or anti
gens, raises a red flag in the
immune system, telling it to destroy
the diseased cells. T cells aid in this
immune response by recognizing
antigen displaying cells.
After recognizing a cell as dis
eased, the T cell then releases a sig
naling molecule called Fas telling
the cell to undergo apoptosis.
All cells can undergo apoptosis,
including, theoretically, T cells.
They, however, fail to do so in
response to the Fas signal.
"If these T cells are killing their
targets," he wondered, "what stops
them from killing themselves?"
To find out. Hitoshi and Nolan

laid out a simple strategy for identi
fying a protein that might he
enabling this resistance.
By growing T cells in the labora
tory, Hitoshi and Nolan were able
to prevent them from becoming
activated by a foreign antigen. To
isolate the cause of apoptosis resis
tance, they produced random pro
teins in these T cells and subjected
them to Fas.
Those few cells which survived
treatment with Fas were found to
be making toso. Cells which were
not expressing toso were eliminat
ed
Toso is made by T cells as they
prepare to fight off an infection. By
studying toso, it may be possible to
uncover a way to turn off the pro
tein. allowing T cells to commit sui
cide.
Why should a patient want to
induce T cell death? A healthy
immune system protects people
from all kinds of ambient

pathogens — by contrast, AIDS
patients, whose immune systems
are compromised, are bombarded
with infections. But T cells do not
always act in a beneficial manner.
Sometimes T cells cause autoim
mune diseases.
Autoimmune diseases affect 5 to
7 percent of the population, and
can be organ-specific or systemic.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a common
systemic autoimmune disease in
which the T cells attack the host's
connective tissue.
Other autoimmune diseases,
including lupus, juvenile diabetes,
and pernicious anemia, can be crip
pling or fatal. By eliminating the T
cells responsible for these attacks,
revolutionary treatments for some
of these diseases may be accessible.
"Toso has the potential to be a
very interesting drug target."
according to Donald Payan. vice
president of research for Rigel.
Inc.. the company licensing parts of
the toso discovery.
"If in fact it protects T cells from
cell death — acting as a shield
against suicide — it may be an
important target for eliminating T
cells that are activated inappropri
ately."
Transplant patients may also
have reason to hope for better ways
to deal with graft rejection, which is
rapidly becoming the major cause
of graft failure. After a transplant,
the host's T cells attack the new
organ, recognizing it as foreign.
This is usually treated by gener
al suppression of the immune sys
tem using agents such as
cyclosporine often leaves the host
vulnerable to outside infections.
Turning off toso in cells that recog
nize the new organ could induce
them to commit suicide, leaving
most of the immune system intact.
"This could be a new way to
knock out cells that are inappropri
ately activated and to kill them in a
selective way," Payan said.
Although it is easy to project
p<issiblc uses for the new protein, it
is too early to say what will come of
this discovery.
