With the effects of winter subsiding and the return of spring's
weekly rituals at Sunken Diamond, we can finally get to work on
our tans. We have suffered through enough rain and clouds these
past few months. But before we exuberantly rush to worship the
sun, we should think about exercising some restraint.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser
vices, about 90 percent of skin cancers are caused by sun exposure
and 90 percent of visible age-related changes that occur in fair skin
are caused by ultraviolet light.
According to UCSF researcher Barbara Gerbert, 750.000
Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each year. In 1995,
there were 34,(XX) new cases of malignant melanoma in the Unit
ed States, 7.000 of which resulted in death.
Despite the clear and grave dangers ot excessive exposure to
summer rays, too many people treat the problem lightly. In a
recent article published in the June issue of the Journal of Cancer
Education. UCSF researchers analyzed individuals' attitudes
toward sun exposure.
Participants were placed into two different groups: low-concern
and high-concern. The study showed that those unconcerned
about the effects of excessive sun exposure were unaware of the
magnitude of the risks. Individuals in the low-concern group said
they rarely considered using sunscreen and viewed exposure to
sunlight as a beneficial activity.
Such exposure, this group said, allowed them to look better,
improve self-esteem, get vitamin D and enjoy the outdoors,
fhough they could list the negative effects of excessive sun expo
sure. they did not view these harms as serious. Only one group
member knew of someone with skin cancer.
Those in the high-concern category noted the positive and ben
eficial effects of sun exposure but were also very aware and con
cerned about the risks involved. They were careful to use sun
screen during intentional exposure to the sun.
Many individuals in this group had relatives or fnends who had
fallen victim to skin cancer and other dermatologic problems such
as precancerous moles or lesions.
Early prevention is a key issue, so the next time you're having
a pint at Zot's or watching a water polo game at deGuerre in noth
ing but your suit, cover up with some sunscreen. Your body will
thank you for it in years to come.
