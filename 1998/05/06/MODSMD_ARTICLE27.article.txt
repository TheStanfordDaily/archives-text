■ today: Stanford vs. San Jose State
2 p.m. Stanford Softball Complex.

In last year's bizarre double
header, the Spartans mercy-ruled
Stanford in the first game, while
Stanford returned the favor in the
second game.
To avoid a similar fate this year,
the Card will have to take the Spar
tans more seriously than they took
University of the Pacific earlier this
season. Stanford split that series
with the Tigers.
San Jose State, like Pacific, is an
out of conference team with a
mediocre record that Stanford will
meet in between tough Pacific 10
Conference matchups.
Though Stanford dropped a
doubleheader to No. 1 Arizona last
weekend, the team continues to
pick up the level of play.
"We're close to peaking right
now, which is what we want to do,"
said junior slugger Michelle
Schneider. "San Jose should give us
a good chance to catch some mo
mentum for this weekend."
San Jose State will not go down
without a fight, however. Though
the Spartans are currently under
.500 on the season, they have risen
to the challenge on a few occasions
this season — the Spartans defeat
ed then-No. 12 Nebraska 8-1 in
April.
The Spartans are led at the plate
by junior Kara Kanney. who is cur
rently battinc .304 with four home

runs and a .481 slugging percent
age, as well as junior Lindsay
Lewis, who sports a .303 average
with four home runs, 22 runs and 24
RBIs.
"Though San Jose State has had
an up-and-down season, they've
got some players who can hit the
ball," said Stanford head coach
John Rittman. "Flaying the Spar
tans will definitely he a challenge
for us. There is a bit of a rivalry be
tween us, so it's also important for

bragging rights."
On the mound, the Spartans are
led by junior Niki Zenger. who
boasts a 3.36 ERA with a 10-11
record and 46 strikeouts for the
season.
The other San Jose States
starter is senior Corina Lilly, who
sports a 3.60 ERA with a 6-10
record and 50 strikeouts for the
season.
"We have to do the right things
to beat this team." said junior ace

Becky Blevins. "As we learned
from Pacific, we cannot take an\
team lightly."
In recent action, the Spartans
have been floundering even against
mediocre competition. They went
0-4 on a recent road trip, which in
cluded a sweep by Colorado State
3-0. 4-3 and a sweep by Utah 5-1,
11-0.
Stanford meets San Jose State
today at 2 p.m. at the Stanford Soft
ball Complex.
