# Alter-ego takes over Estes in the pool
## 
### Brianna MacDonald Contributing writer 
Who would have thought get
ting cut from the team could be one
of the best things that ever hap
pened to you?
But that's the way it happened
for Stanford water polo's Ellen
Estes.
The Cardinal sophomore went
out for Novato High School's water
polo team only after being cut from
the tennis squad at the beginning of
her freshman year.
"I really wanted to play tennis,
but 1 got cut," Estes said. "1 decided
I still wanted to play some kind of
sport."
Enter Estes' swim coach, who
urged her to try water polo.
After her sophomore year,
Estes began playing club polo in

Marin. Calif. Up until that point,
Estes' high school only had a coed
team. But in her junior year, the
women received varsity standing,
and Estes really began to fall in love
with the sport.
"We got to travel to universities
and play against college teams. At
that point, the sport was so new [for
women] that the high school and
college teams were about the
same," Estes said. "I saw that 1
could play in college, and I got ex
cited."
Now. Estes is playing for the No.
2 women's water polo team in the
nation.
"The dynamics on the team are
awesome," Estes said. "I like play
ing with the Stanford girls. We help
each other out in the water and out
of it."
This vcar, Estes has shown her

self to be one of the best women
water polo players at both the col
lege and the national level.
In 1997, Estes was a second
team Ail-American. This season,
she was named Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Player of the
Year and shared tournament Most
Valuable Player honors with
UCLA's Coralie Simmons at the
MPSF championships.
Estes has been setting the hole
— and the pace — for the Cardinal
offense all season. She led the team
in scoring in 22 out of 31 games. She
also broke last season's scoring
record of 63 goals, set by fellow
sophomore Suze Gardner. Estes is
currently at 85 goals with one more
tournament to go.
"Ellen has a real knack for scor
ing goals," said head coach John
Tanner. "She has an accurate shot

even when she's off-balance. That
separates her from a lot of people."
Although a lot of attention has
been focused on her personal
achievements, Estes attributes her
success to the team.
"It's a team effort all the way,"
Estes said. "1 only score when the
team is doing a good job. When
they do well. 1 do well. When they
don't plav well. I don't play well."
Yes. even Estes has her difficult
days. But she gets motivation and
inspiration from her coaches and
her teammates.
"I owe a lot to [TannerJ and [as
sistant coach] Susan [Ortwein] and
the team." Estes said. "Everyone
can tell when someone is having a
tough day and the others tap into
that and get them thinking and fo
cused."
The focus for Estes — and the
rest of the team — has been nation
als this year. The Stanford squad
heads to USC for the national tour
nament this weekend, where the
team will attempt to topple top
ranked UCLA for the national
title.
"Winning nationals has been the
whole goal this year." Estes said.
"We have the smarts and the talent
to do it."
After nationals, Estes will have
one week off before she begins
training with the senior women's
national team. Fifteen players from
the 24 member squad will travel to
Europe for international competi
tions.
And if the U.S. team qualifies,
11 of those women will be in the in
augural women's water polo event
at the summer Olympics in the year
2(MX).
"Ellen is mature and composed
at two-meters, which is a difficult
position," Tanner said. "As a
sophomore, she has a strong colle
giate future, and she definitely has
the ability to become a member of
the national team."
In spite of the fact that Estes is at
the forefront of the growing move
ment of women's water polo at
both the collegiate and the national
