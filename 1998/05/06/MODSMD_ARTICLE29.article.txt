# Rob and Va bid a fond farewell
## 
### 
In light of Vanessa's imminent de
parture/or New York <she was draft
ed by the New York Liberty of the
WNBA), thus will be our last column
together. Before you cry and smudge
the ink, we thought we'd share what
we've learned through thus experi
ence.
Kohin: The world is coming to an
end! I don't know how I'll ever he
able to go on.
Ya: Really? I feel strangely liberated.
Freed from the shackled cloud of dis
content that writing this column
brought to my life.
Kohin: ITiat's not a compliment, is
it?

Ya: Maybe.
Kobin: Well, since this was such a
miserable existence for you. why
don't we try to figure out a few tips
for others who may attempt similar
ventures? That way it won't be so
torturous for them.
Ya: 1 kneu you were good for some
thing.
Kobin: Well, that works for our first
tip. Don't write a column with some
one who hates you and likes to
makes fun of you and beats you and
generally isn't nice and ...
Ya: ITiat's not fair. Robin. You're
not that bad.
Kobin: What do you think is a key to
a successful column *
Ya: lambic pentameter.
Kobin: I don't know what that is. but
I know we didn't do it.
Ya: My point exactly.
Kobin: Well, what was your favorite
thing about the columns?
Ya: All the great adventures we took
— to the rodeo, fishing, lawn dart
championships, building our own bat

cave under "ITie Daily—
Kohin: That brings up another very
important point: Making things up is
bad; truth is good.
Va: But Robin, the truth isn't funny.
Failing your oceans midterm be
cause you got bitten by a shark is
much funnier than saying you didn't
study.
Kohin: Have you ever heard of jour
nalistic integrity?
Ya: No. is it anything like virtual re
ality?
Kohin: I don't understand you. An
other important thing for writing
columns is to always have a clear,
thought-out topic.
Ya: You could've told me that four

months ago.
Kobin: Do you have any advice for
the readers?
Ya: One thing I've noticed is that in
side jokes don't work with an audi
ence ;\s big as Hie Daily is so maybe
you should try to avoid them. Nanny-
Kv>. But when you think about it.
aren't all jokes inside? Some are just
more inside than others. It's like a
bunch of concentric circles, that just
keep circling and circling and circling
until it kx>ks like one gigantic pile of
circles.
Kobin: Are you done yet? Because I
have another tip. You should be sure
to find a co-columnist who can actu
ally focus on the task at hand.
Ya* What? Did you say something?
I'm watching the game.
Kohin: Well, since if I have y»>ur at
tention for just a second, maybe you
could tell me if there are any issues
we didn't cover that you would have
liked to have discussed.

Robin
Davidson
Va: Short coaches — do they really
carry the same authority? Dog rac
ing—why? It retired horses go to the
glue factory, where does retired glue
go? Mascot basketball — why is it so
entertaining? And, the ever popular
problem that really has nothing to do
with sports — why do you say take a
dump when you obviously leave a
dump?
Robin: Those are riveting topics. My
favorite that we never got the chance
to write was "Famous Historical Fig
ures — What Sport Would They
Play?"
Va: Abraham Lincoln would have
made a kick-ass curler. With his
beard he wouldn't even need a
broom. And can you imagine our
founding fathers in a street luge, fed
eralists vs. anti-federalists grudge
match? I hear Thomas Jefferson had
a very low center of gravity.
Robin: OK., getting back to the col
umn. Another tip is to avoid random
tangents that don't make any sense.
Va: They make sense to me.
Robin: Is there anything that you
learned from this experience? Or to
put it another way, what will you
take away from this experience?
And don't use this as an opportunity
to pick on me.
Va: Well, the rinht thing to say would

be that 1 learned that journalists'jobs
aren't as easy as they look and
maybe they should get all those seats
really close to the court even though
they didn't pay for them. But the
things I really learned... wait a
minute, just like a Cal student, I
didn't learn anything. What did you
learn, Robin?
Robin: Clearly, 1 learned more than
you. but that would be true on most
days. What I really learned is that
most things 1 think are funny really
aren't. And most things you think
are funny are twisted and mean.
Va: Hey, this is more depressing than
the ending of "Seinfeld." Before ! go,
in the tradition of Fiona Apple, I'd
like to take the opportunity to use
this forum to make a statement
about society. I don't remember that
Maya Angelou quote, but here's
what I have to say: The world would
be a much better place if people fol
lowed the rule of DOTTING your
i's. Make a dot. not a circle, not a
heart, not a smiley face, not a sham
rock — a dot. And that's all 1 have to
say about that.
Robin: 1 just want to have the last
word. Word.
If there's anyone out there who actu
ally en joys reading this column and
doesn'/ want to see it end, send us
money and may he it won't. Then
again, maybe it will. Either way we
could use a free hurrito, Nanny-boo.
