# Rob and Va bid a fond farewell
## 
### 
In light of Vanessa's imminent de
parture/or New York <she was draft
ed by the New York Liberty of the
WNBA), thus will be our last column
together. Before you cry and smudge
the ink, we thought we'd share what
we've learned through thus experi
ence.
Kohin: The world is coming to an
end! I don't know how I'll ever he
able to go on.
Ya: Really? I feel strangely liberated.
Freed from the shackled cloud of dis
content that writing this column
brought to my life.
Kohin: ITiat's not a compliment, is
it?

Ya: Maybe.
Kobin: Well, since this was such a
miserable existence for you. why
don't we try to figure out a few tips
for others who may attempt similar
ventures? That way it won't be so
torturous for them.
Ya: 1 kneu you were good for some
thing.
Kobin: Well, that works for our first
tip. Don't write a column with some
one who hates you and likes to
makes fun of you and beats you and
generally isn't nice and ...
Ya: ITiat's not fair. Robin. You're
not that bad.
Kobin: What do you think is a key to
a successful column *
Ya: lambic pentameter.
Kobin: I don't know what that is. but
I know we didn't do it.
Ya: My point exactly.
Kobin: Well, what was your favorite
thing about the columns?
Ya: All the great adventures we took
— to the rodeo, fishing, lawn dart
championships, building our own bat

cave under "ITie Daily—
Kohin: That brings up another very
important point: Making things up is
bad; truth is good.
Va: But Robin, the truth isn't funny.
Failing your oceans midterm be
cause you got bitten by a shark is
much funnier than saying you didn't
study.
Kohin: Have you ever heard of jour
nalistic integrity?
Ya: No. is it anything like virtual re
ality?
Kohin: I don't understand you. An
other important thing for writing
columns is to always have a clear,
thought-out topic.
Ya: You could've told me that four

months ago.
Kobin: Do you have any advice for
the readers?
Ya: One thing I've noticed is that in
side jokes don't work with an audi
ence ;\s big as Hie Daily is so maybe
you should try to avoid them. Nanny-
Kv>. But when you think about it.
aren't all jokes inside? Some are just
more inside than others. It's like a
bunch of concentric circles, that just
keep circling and circling and circling
until it kx>ks like one gigantic pile of
circles.
Kobin: Are you done yet? Because I
have another tip. You should be sure
to find a co-columnist who can actu
ally focus on the task at hand.
Ya* What? Did you say something?
I'm watching the game.
Kohin: Well, since if I have y»>ur at
tention for just a second, maybe you
could tell me if there are any issues
we didn't cover that you would have
liked to have discussed.
