time trial and the criterium.
In the road race, consisting of up
to three laps on a 27-mile course,
Stanford women brought in the title,
as well as third and fifth places,
thanks to graduate students Cindy
Ferguson, Christine Thorburn and
Megan Troxell, respectively. Dario
Falquier placed third for the men,
while Pete Armitagetook fifth.

The Stanford cycling team fin
ished its regular road season last
weekend as the third-place team in
the West Coast Cycling Conference
Championships.
Despite not improving on last
year's performance, the team has
high hopes for capturing its fourth
consecutive national title later this
month.
" The team's ranking of third in
the conference doesn't bode ill for its
chances at nationals." said head
coach Art Walker — at least not if
the pattern remains consistent.
In the championships, held in San
Diego, Stanford actually placed sec
ond as a team, hut because results are
totaled for the entire season's races,
however. UC-Santa Barbara was
able to edge out the Cardinal with its
third-place finish at the champi
onships. Walker said.
UC-Davis finished first, earning
its first-ever conference title after
three events: the road race, the team

CYCLING
■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford placed
third overall at the West Coast Cy
cling Conference Championships.

As a team, Stanford placed sec
ond to UC-Davis with 201 points to
the Aggies' 241.
The time trial pits four-rider
teams against each other on a 7.5-
mile course. The Cardinal cleaned
up iri this event, winning with 400
points — more than 20 beyond the
second-place Santa Barbara squad.
The men's A team finished in 16
minutes, three seconds, and the
women came in at 17:40.

In Sunday's criterium races on a
.46-mile course, each rider took be
tween 40 and 75 laps depending on
his category. Walker called the cri
terium grounds "not an ideal course
for a conference championship," as it
was set up in a parking lot. Despite
that, his riders left most of the com
petition behind.
Cardinal team captain Omar
Leung, Grant Stevens, Ted Manning
and Erin Kassoy placed in the B, C
and D categories.
The Stanford women combined
for 117 points in the A criterium,
while the men also raced hard.
The Cardinal also competed for
individual season omnium — or
overall — titles at the conference
championships.
Troxell topped the list for the
women's A omnium, while team
mates Ferguson and Thorburn
slipped in at second and sixth places,
respectively. Troxell, who also won
in 1995, is the first Stanford cyclist in
many years to be a multiple winner in
that category. Walker said.
Among the men, Armitage

barely missed the top spot — his
400.5 points for the season were
less than five short of first place.
Walker said Armitage was unoffi
cially recognized as MVP in the
conference.
"Pete has been a huge part of this
team's existence and fortunes for the
past three years," Walker said.
Looking ahead to the national
championships, Ferguson said she
expected the team to be competitive
even though it has lost some of the
strength of past years, largely due to
the departure of several key mem
bers of its men's team.
"We lost a lot of our men with a
lot of experience," Ferguson said.
"That will really hurt us on the
points. Hut 1 think our women's team
is as strong or stronger than it's ever
been. I think we could do really
well."
Ferguson said the women espe
cially are aiming to win the team time
trial championship, which they won
in 1994 and 1995 but haven't been
able to capture during the past two
years.
