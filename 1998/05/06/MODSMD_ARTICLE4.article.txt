# Campus rock climbers find their niche
## 
### Emma Brown 
When we're kids, we climb
things as it by instinct. Monkey bars,
fences and trees offer the possibility
of falling and the satisfaction of
overcoming the challenge of gravity
to make it to some quiet spot above
the rest of the world.
Some stop climbing trees as they
age. Some don't — they start climb

ing rocks instead.
The climbers around campus
may have gone unnoticed, scaling
the walls of Memorial Church and
other buildings. They are boulder
ing — climbing relatively low to the
ground — without the aid of ropes
or harnesses. They are perfecting
the art of using their bodies to travel
vertically.
"I enjoy climbing because it de

velops cixirdination and strength
but is also an aerobic workout." said
freshman Ben Suter.
Climbing is a relativeh young
sport. While at one time people
were content to leave the high peaks
and seemingly unscalable vertical
ascents to the gods, bv the mid- Nth
century the first climbers in Europe
