# Campus rock climbers find their niche
## 
### Emma Brown 
When we're kids, we climb
things as it by instinct. Monkey bars,
fences and trees offer the possibility
of falling and the satisfaction of
overcoming the challenge of gravity
to make it to some quiet spot above
the rest of the world.
Some stop climbing trees as they
age. Some don't — they start climb

ing rocks instead.
The climbers around campus
may have gone unnoticed, scaling
the walls of Memorial Church and
other buildings. They are boulder
ing — climbing relatively low to the
ground — without the aid of ropes
or harnesses. They are perfecting
the art of using their bodies to travel
vertically.
"I enjoy climbing because it de

velops cixirdination and strength
but is also an aerobic workout." said
freshman Ben Suter.
Climbing is a relativeh young
sport. While at one time people
were content to leave the high peaks
and seemingly unscalable vertical
ascents to the gods, bv the mid- Nth
century the first climbers in Europe

had seen the summits of such leg
endary mountains as the Matterhom
and Mont Blanc.
Mountaineering and climbing
spread to other parts of the world,
most notably the Himalayas in Asia.
It was slow to come to the United
States.
Recently, however, rock climbing,
as both a competitive and recreation
al sport, has been gaining popularity
as part of a larger trend of an increase
in outdoor recreational activity in the
United States.
The increasing number of dedi
cated climbers is apparent on cam
pus. Last year the Climbing Wall re
ceived a $30,000 ASSU special fee,
and according to the group's organiz
ers. the wall will be completed by
mid-summer for use by the Stanford
community. The climbing wall will be
constructed on the exterior wall of
deGuerre facing the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium. There will be in
struction available at the wall for
those who want to learn how to
climb.

In addition, Redwood Outdoor
Club's climbing subgroup is offering
a climbing school for beginners and
trips for both novices and more expe
rienced climbers. Climbing subgroup
chair Bryan Palmintier, a master's
student in aeronautical /astronauti
cal engineering, hopes the group will
help people "develop valuable lead
ership and group skills" as well as
provide a way for people to have fun
together outdoors.
" The combination of the Red
wood climbing subgroup and the
climbing wall are going to make a big
splash in the climbing community,"
said sophomore Dennis Murphree,
who is one of the teachers for the
climbing school and an active mem
ber of the climbing wall project.
Climbers at Stanford enjoy differ
ent kinds of climbing and have all lev
els of experience. One kind is com
petitive, in which competitors climb
indoor walls in pursuit of the highest
speed or greatest distance.
Tanya Laidman, a coterminal stu
dent. is one of the top five women on
the U.S. climbing team. She trains for
the difficulty competition, in which
an extremely hard route is set and the
winner is the climber who achieves

the greatest vertical distance from the
ground.
Laidman said outdoor climbing is
"much more fun," but indoor climb
ing is necessary for serious competi
tion training. She trains at Mission
Cliffs in San Francisco, one of the
largest gyms in the country, and at
Planet Granite in Santa Clara.
Laidman said climbing is "so dif
ferent for everybody. ... It's really
fun. It pushes you to focus. For a lot
of people it is a release."
The advent of climbing gyms has
not only given competitors a place to
train. The gyms, which are becoming
more and more common, also give
novices a place to try climbing with
out the risk associated with outdoors.
"Climbing is an inherently dan
gerous sport," said senior Keith
Chen.
Before gyms, however, climbers
pursued their sport exclusively out
doors. This remains the preferred
arena for many. The closest place to
climb in the area is Castle Rock State
Park, a 40-minute drive south on Sky
line Boulevard. Other popular places
include Pinnacles National Monu
ment. Joshua Tree National Monu
ment and Yoseniite National Park.

The latter two are famous worldwide
for excellent climbing.
Rock climbing requires physical
fitness and body awareness as well as
strong concentration and the ability
to think several moves ahead to avoid
getting stuck. The combination of the
intellectual and physical is one of the
most attractive elements ofthe sport.
"Rock climbing is good for your
body, good for your mind and good
for your fellowship — you get to meet
good, fun people," Murphree said.
Climbing helps develop intangi
bles like confidence and problem
solving skills, but it also comes in
handy in the most unlikely places.
Chen, who has been climbing for five
years, spent a quarter last year at
Stanford in Oxford, where there is a
building constructed of horizontal
stripes of rainbow-painted bricks.
Chen joined a secret society
whose mission it to take down the
ugly building, one brick at a time.
"There's an easy way to tell how risky
you are," Chen said. The bricks are
color-coded by height, and only the
best climbers can get the colors at the
top. Chen managed to climb 50 feet
where he hammered out a brick and
returned victoriously to the ground.
