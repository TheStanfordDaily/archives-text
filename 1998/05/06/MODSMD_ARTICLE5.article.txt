### Sonya Schneider Contributing writer 
Stanford professors and students
yesterday discussed the problems
created since Israel's foundation as
a nation-state at a "teach-in" titled
"Palestine and Israel: Reflections
on 50 Years After 1^48."
Among the speakers were Histo
ry Prof. Joel Beinin. electrical engi
neering doctoral student Osama
Shana'a and Yael Ben-Zvi. a doc
toral student in modern thought and
literature. History doctoral student
Shira Robinson moderated the dis
cussion.
To a crowd of 35. who were
mostly students. Robinson intro
duced the presenters by explaining
that despite their different back
grounds. all three would explore the
"grave individual suffering on the
part of those people who have been
excluded from a traditional image
of the Israeli state."
She stressed that although the
50-year independence has been
cause for much celebration, particu
larly in the United States, the teach
in would address a less commonly
perceived notion of the lessons
learned from WM to the present.
Beinin. in his talk on "The Nor
malization of the Arab-Israeli Con
flict." focused on the Western view
that Jews have a "divine right" to
the country he called Palestine.
Perpetuated by Zionism and en
hanced by the trauma of Nazism
during World War 11. this romanti
cized vision of Israel is the main rea
son for the West's unwillingness to
recognize it as anything other than
the "inheritor of a moral legacy,"
Beinin said.
Although the situation has
changed significantly over the past
few decades. Beinin continued,
there has been a backlash in the
There remains "a lot of work
to be done." he said.

In her talk called "Together ir
Pride. Together in Hope?" Ben-Zv
questioned the validity of Israel'
claim that it is the only democracy ii
the Middle East. Skeptical of thi
slogan taken from the Israeli nv
tional anthem, she asked it violenc
and oppression uphold democrati
ideals.
"One cannot innocently accep
Israel's proud togetherness." Ben
Zvi said.
She also spoke briefly about hei
experience as a member of an Is
raeli lesbian feminist group, saying
"Israel's acceptance of queers can
not mislead people into believing it
embraces democracy."
In his talk called "Palestinians'
Independence from the Anniver
sary of Independence!" Shana'a dis
cussed the oppression he telt as a
Palestinian m a state he said was
"founded by terrorism."
"Every day is a new day of strug
gle." Shana'a said. "Palestinians are
looking for the day when they can
earn control for their destiny."
The speakers also addressed pos
sible solutions. Shana'a said no solu
tion will work until there is a mutual
trust between parties.
Ben-Zvi said. "Perhaps there
will not be peace until the US places
sanctions on Israel." And Beinin
said that until there is a recognition
of both national entities in the land,
he does not see a hopeful future.
The audience had a very mixed
response. Elana Piller. a sophomore
majoring in international relations
and minoring in Jew ish studies, said
it was "ver\ frustrating that the peo
ple presenting were all on one side."
"I don't know how to counter
what the\ say. even if 1 know it is
wrong." she said.
Amy Robinson, a divtoral stu
dent in British history, said "It was
great to hear people willing to
speak out on this controversial
issue."
Noam Leslau. a junior in history

and economics, called it "informa
tive" hut said that like many Middle
East discussions, the panel didn't in
clude both sides.
"I'd be curious to see it over
again with someone arguing against
them." he said.
