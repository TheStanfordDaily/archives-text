### Nicola Skidmore 
R Gordon Gilbert, who worked
in accelerator physics at Stanford
for 33 years, died April 4.
He is remembered at Stanford
both for his high intelligence and
command of his science and for his
strong concern for his co-workers
and for safety issues involved in ac
celerator physics.
Born in St. Louis in 1922. Gilbert
attended Washington I inversus.
During World War 11. he worked at
the mass spectrometer facility at
Oak Ridge. Tenn.. then in Los
Alamos. N.M.. testing neutron pro
duction instruments.
In 194 b.he entered graduate

school at the UC-Berkeley. where
he temporarily turned away from
physics in favor of political science.
Gilbert came to Stanford in
1953. working at what was then
called the High Energy Physics Lab
on the Mark 111 accelerator. His
final move was to the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center in 1969
when the Mark project wound
down.
Perry Wilson, now an emeritus
professor at SLAC. was Gilbert's
supervisor at HEPL. He remem
bers the time he and Gilbert
worked together as "wonderful
years."
"He was a tremendously consci
entious guy," Wilson said. "He
would spend hours with the opera
tors, going over their problems. ...
He was concerned about the human
aspects."
Gilbert "had endless patience,"

said Wilson, who credits Gilbert
with making operations of the ac
celerator on which they worked run
smoothly.
At SLAC, Gilbert served on the
Radiation Safety Committee, an as
signment he took very seriously.
SLAC physicist Ted Fieguth said
Gilbert "was one of the most ethical
people that ever worked here at
SLAC. He was a reasoned man ...

and very considerate of other peo
ple." He added, "He was a wonder
ful role model. I miss him a great
deal."
During his 46-year residence in
Palo Alto, Gilbert volunteered with
the Palo Alto Co-op and was a do
cent at the Long Marine Lab in
Santa Cruz. He began playing the
bassoon in high school and contin
ued to play with local orchestras.
