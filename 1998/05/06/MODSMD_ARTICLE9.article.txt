## Executive privilege denied 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal
judge denied President Clinton's claims of
executive privilege in the Monica Lewin
sky case. The Associated Press learned
yesterday. Meanwhile, prosecutors fin
ished their work with an Arkansas grand
jury and turned their attention back to
presidential friend Vernon Jordan.
The White House could appeal the rul
ing. confirmed by two officials familiar
with the legal dispute between the admin
istration and Whitewater prosecutor Ken
neth Starr. Any decision to appeal would
further delay Starr's investigation into
whether Clinton had sex with Lewinsky
and lied about it.
At the height of the Watergate scandal
in the summer of 1974, the Supreme
Court in less than six weeks voted to
uphold U.S. District Judge John Sirica's
decision against President Nixon, who
invoked executive privilege to deny
access to tape-recorded conversations in
the White House. Nixon resigned five
weeks later.
It wasn't immediately clear how sweep
ing was the ruling by the presiding judge
in the case, Norma Holloway Johnson, or
when she handed down her decision.

Longtime presidential confidant Bruce
Lindsay refused earlier this year to answer
certain questions for the grand jury on
grounds of executive privilege.
With the case under seal, Clinton has
refused to even acknowledge publicly that
he invoked the privilege — a rarely assert
ed presidential stance that played a cen
tral role in the Watergate affair.
Aides speaking on condition of
anonymity have said the claim was limit
ed; it pertained to grand jury questioning
about White House strategy, not about
the president's relationship with Lewin
sky.
It wasn't immediately clear whether
Starr would ask for a new grand jury to be
empaneled in Little Rock.
The indictment of Susan McDougal, a
former business partner of President and
Mrs. Clinton who was charged with crimi
nal contempt and obstruction, was the last
to be handed up by the grand jury there
before it concluded its business. Its term
was to expire tomorrow.
McDougal issued a defiant statement
promising, "If they expect to see the same
passive woman" who was convicted in a
previous Whitewater trial, "they are in for

a surprise. I intend to fight these charges.
... I here is a great deal of information
that has not yet come to light."
Other evidence gathered in Little
Rock, including information on Hillary
Rodham Clinton's billing records at the
Rose Law Firm, could easily be taken up
by the grand jury in Washington.
Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman,
said it was still possible that prosecutors
could seek a new grand jury in Arkansas
to hear additional evidence. "We may
seek to present evidence to another grand
jury in Little Rock," he said. "That is a
possibility, but there's been no decision
about that."
The federal grand jury investigating
the Lewinsky case here called Jordan for
testimony a third time.
In addition, sources familiar with the
investigation said that Clinton's personal
secretary, Betty Currie, will testify this
week.
She and Jordan have testified previous
ly and both befriended Lewinsky, a one
time White House intern, raising ques
tions of whether there was an effort to
keep her quiet about a possible presiden
tial affair and coverup.
