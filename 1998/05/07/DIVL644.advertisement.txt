Whitfield Diffie, author of
PRIURCY ON THE LINE:
The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption
Telecommunication has neuer been perfectly secure, as a Cold War culture of
wiretaps and international spying taught us. Vet many of us still take our priuacy for
granted, euen as we become more reliant than euer on telephones, computer
netuiorks.and electronic transactions of all kinds. So many of our relationships now
use telecommunication as the primary mode of communication that the security of
these transactions has become a source of wide public concern and debate. Whitfield
Diffie and Susan Landau argue that If we are to retain the priuacy that characterized
face-to-face relationships in the past, we must build the means of protecting
that priuacy into our communication systems.
Diffie and Landau strip away the hype surrounding the policy debate to
examine the national security, law enforcement, commercial, and ciuil liberties Issues.
They discuss the social function of priuacy, how it underlies a democratic society, and
what happens when it is lost. They also eHplore the workings of intelligence and law
enforcement organizations, how they intercept communications, and how they use
what they intercept.
Diffie and Landau
