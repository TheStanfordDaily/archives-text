# Area One pilot well received

Students, faculty and administrators seem pleased
as the first year of the Area One requirement restruc
turing comes to a close.
In 1995, the Faculty Senate recommended a broad
review and reform of the Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program, the mandatory year-long humanities course
for freshmen.

According to the senate report,
the courses should no longer at
tempt to form a comprehensive sur
vey of culture or civilization but in
stead introduce students to human
istic methods of inquiry and analy
sis.
This is the first year in a three
year transition period. "This year
was designated to begin our one-

quarter-two-quarter sequence," noted Ramon Saldi
var. vice provost for undergraduate education.
In this system, students take an Introduction to the
Humanities course that focuses on a small number of
texts during fall quarter. Then students join various
two-quarter "track" courses that are structured
around defined themes and critical questions.
"We had two brand new first-quarter Introduction
to the Humanities courses, while we modified old (TV
courses." Saldivar said. "Next year, there will be four
or more new courses."
In response to student criticism of too much read
ing. the new courses focused in depth on four to five
texts instead of the usual 10 to 15 required in CIV.
"In Introduction to the Humanities, students learn
to read texts closely, to think analytically and to de
velop critical arguments." said Area One Program Di
rector Harry Elam, an associate drama professor.
Next year, the vast majority of freshmen will do the
one-two quarter sequence. By 1999-2000, all Area
One courses, except for Structured Liberal Education,
will follow this structure.
Freshman Ethan Kurzweil said he enjoyed one of
the new Introduction to Humanities courses, titled
"Why Read It?" The students read Plato's "Sympo
sium." Shakespeare's "King Lear," Montesquieu's
