# Area One pilot well received

### Brittney Jensen Contributing writer 
Students, faculty and administrators seem pleased
as the first year of the Area One requirement restruc
turing comes to a close.
In 1995, the Faculty Senate recommended a broad
review and reform of the Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program, the mandatory year-long humanities course
for freshmen.

According to the senate report,
the courses should no longer at
tempt to form a comprehensive sur
vey of culture or civilization but in
stead introduce students to human
istic methods of inquiry and analy
sis.
This is the first year in a three
year transition period. "This year
was designated to begin our one-

quarter-two-quarter sequence," noted Ramon Saldi
var. vice provost for undergraduate education.
In this system, students take an Introduction to the
Humanities course that focuses on a small number of
texts during fall quarter. Then students join various
two-quarter "track" courses that are structured
around defined themes and critical questions.
"We had two brand new first-quarter Introduction
to the Humanities courses, while we modified old (TV
courses." Saldivar said. "Next year, there will be four
or more new courses."
In response to student criticism of too much read
ing. the new courses focused in depth on four to five
texts instead of the usual 10 to 15 required in CIV.
"In Introduction to the Humanities, students learn
to read texts closely, to think analytically and to de
velop critical arguments." said Area One Program Di
rector Harry Elam, an associate drama professor.
Next year, the vast majority of freshmen will do the
one-two quarter sequence. By 1999-2000, all Area
One courses, except for Structured Liberal Education,
will follow this structure.
Freshman Ethan Kurzweil said he enjoyed one of
the new Introduction to Humanities courses, titled
"Why Read It?" The students read Plato's "Sympo
sium." Shakespeare's "King Lear," Montesquieu's


Saldivar
"Persian Letters"and Hurston's
"Their Eves Were Watching God."
They then studied the books from
varying humanistic perspectives.
"We focused on the works in
depth." Kurzweil said.
"Assigning a reasonable
amount of work ensured that mem
bers of the class had gotten up to
speed and could discuss the works
intelligently."
Freshman Mike Dudas, who
took the other new course. "Word
of the World." gave a less favorable
review.
"The class was Web-based,
which was confusing." he said.
"Students were asked to read the
same books twice, which, obvious
ly, few students did."

Students will take some new and
some traditional CIV tracks in the
winter and spring. The old tracks,
such as "Great Works" and "Myth
and Modernity," are being modi
lied in response to student sugges
tions.
"This year in Great Works, we
read at most one manageable text a
week," said John Shank, a lecturer
in Great Works and an Area One
Program coordinator. "We took
three weeks to read the 'Odyssey.'
Students are responding positive
ly."
Some freshmen don't think real
reform has occurred.
"There is way too much materi
al to read and not enough time to
discuss it," said Aimer Khan, a
freshman in the philosophy track.
"Many students don't read a single
book."
Sections are being kept to an av

erage size of 15 students, and all
section leaders are now three-year,
term-limited postdoctoral schol
ars.
Reforms are addressing another
common student complaint — the
lack of flexibility and student
choice in the three-quarter CIV
track.
"Students will not he at com
plete liberty to change over at any
moment," Saldi'var explained, "but
after they complete the fall quarter
course, they can choose which win
ter and spring course they would
like to take."
This change responds to student
complaint of feeling trapped in a
decision they make in August.
But the new flexibility has draw
backs.
"The old program had a nice
feature, where faculty could meet
students fall quarter then stay to

gether all year," Shank said.
"A section would stay together
all year and bond. This was excep
tional when it worked."
Some students still complain
about the lack of diversity in Area
()ne.
"There was a huge Bible bias,"
Khan said. "The minorities they fo
cused on were Western minorities,
like Western women and African
Americans."
According to Saldi'var. includ
ing diverse viewpoints is still part
of the mandate for reform, but the
focus is on structural changes.
"Now the course's object is to
teach students how to be human
ists." Shank said. "To explore the
questions humanists ask. the
method humanists use. People are
going to have diverse perspectives
regardless — we don't need to
mandate that."
