# Advertising fuels election
## Three-way primary for governor features negative campaigning 
### 
SAC RAMENTO. Calif. (AP) — In a
race that has received little media cover
age, California's candidates for governor
are waging a television air war in which
they hurl charges of incompetence, greed
and mudslinging to get the attention of
voters.
The latest wave of commercials con
tains no concrete plans on how to improve
the state. It consists largely of attack ads
and ads responding to attack ads.
Driving the ad hinge is airline tycoon
Al Checchi, a Democrat who has spent
more than $25 million of his own money
and may set a national spending record for
a non-presidential race by the time the
election is over.

The saturation ad campaign comes at a
time when TV stations are devoting less
and less time to an election they see as a
ratings loser. The candidates rarely stump,
making TV commercials virtually the only
glimpse many California voters will get of
them.
Checchi's latest ad charges that as state
controller. Davis squandered millions of
tax dollars, illegally failed to collect inter
est on state-supervised bank accounts and
made 112 und-raising calls at public expense.
Davis' aides called the charges untrue.
In turn. Davis' newest ad — one of
three now on the air — says Checchi, for
mer co-chairman of Northwest Airlines,
killed kindergarten legislation to save a

tax break for his airline and fired 4,O<H)
people while paying himself $10 million a
year.
C'hecchi responded that the bill
beeame law with no tax break for his air
*
line. In addition, he said Northwest Air
lines rehired more than 2.(XX) workers
"furloughed" in the 1992 industry reces
sion.
Meanwhile, the third leading Demo
cratic candidate. Rep. Jane Harman.
defended her record in a new ad disputing
Checchi's claims that she is an ofttjn
absent congresswoman.
A tally by the magazine Roll Call
found Harman had missed 63 percent of
1998 votes through March 12.
