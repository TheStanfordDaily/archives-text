# Clinton defends use of privilege
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rejecting
parallels to Watergate without elaborat
ing. President Clinton declared yesterday
that his executive privilege claim in the
Monica Lewinsky investigation is "quite
different" from the landmark battle over
Richard Nixon's tapes.
Meanwhile, at the federal courthouse
where many of Nixon's legal battles were
fought. Clinton's personal secretary testi
fied anew as the independent counsel's
grand jury continued its inquiry.
Clinton, questioned by reporters at the
White House, would not say whether he
would appeal a judge's decision refusing
to block presidential aides from testifying

on executive privilege grounds.
After the White House legal team met
to discuss the decision, lawyers familiar
with the deliberations said an appeal was
likely. One Clinton confidant, also speak
ing on condition of anonymity, said the
decision to appeal had already been
made.
Some political advisers, however, are
concerned that such an appeal, regarded
by legal experts as a longshot, will only
extend comparisons to Watergate.
Any appeal would set in motion a case
that could become the first executive priv
ilege battle to reach the Supreme Court in
a quarter century.

"The matter is still under seal. And 'as
I have said in all these cases, at least one
party in every case should follow the
judge's orders. Preferably, it's better 'if
both do. So 1 can't comment on it." Clin
ton told reporters at a news conference
with Italian Prime Minister Romanc
Prodi.
The president noted the White House
has told the court it supports releasing the
pleadings in the sealed case "so that vol
and the American people can evaluate m\
position and any differences that exi*
between that which we have asserted aiK
previous assertions of executive privj
lege."
