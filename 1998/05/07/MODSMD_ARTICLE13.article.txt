# Army training to be divided by sex
## 
### 
WASHING TON (AP) â€” Over
Clinton administration opposition,
a key House committee voted for
separate military training for
women and men yesterday,
accepting the argument that the
change could thwart sexual mis
conduct and distractions.
"All we're trying to do is get
basic training back to basic train
ing, not social experimentation."
said Rep. Gene Taylor, R-Miss.
Opponents on the House
National Security Committee, in
debating the defense authorization
bill, said separating men from
women during training will work
against cohesion in the field and
could result in less equality for
female soldiers in the male-domi
nated armed forces.
"It will roll back opportunities
for women.... It will not reduce
sexual misconduct," argued Rep.
Jane Harman, D-Calif. "We
learned long ago that a policy of
separate but equal results in
unequal opportunities."
Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., a
leading opponent of separate
training, failed to win committee
approval for an amendment to
hold off on a decision until a con
gressional commission studying
the matter makes its report. The
amendment failed 23-30.
Under the legislation, the
Army, Navy and Air Force would

be required to house and train
male and female recruits separate
ly. something the Marine Corps
already does. A panel headed by
former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum
Baker. R-kan.. studied the ques
tion last year after a sex scandal at
an Army base in Aberdeen. Md.,
and recommended separate basic
training last year for all military
services.
"The sexual dynamic is both an
attraction and a distraction," Rep.
Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md.. said yes
terday in arguing for separation.
"There's no place for this in the
armed forces."
The Pentagon would have to
begin gender-separate living and
training by April 1999, although
waivers would be allowed until
October 2001 in order to give the
services time to build facilities as
needed.
The committee approved $8
million for the Army to buy locks
and take other measures to sepa
rate the sexes until barracks can be
built at a cost of about $160 mil
lion.
The House plan goes beyond
recommendations of Defense Sec
retary William Cohen, who wants
the services to house male and
female recruits in separate areas
but doesn't want separate basic
training.
On the defense budget itself.

lawmakers grumbled that it falls
short of needs to keep the military
in fighting form.
"This budget is good for eco
nomic security, but I'm not sure
it's good for national security,"
complained committee Chairman
Floyd Spence. R-S.C! 4
Under last year's balanced bud
get deal between Congress and
President Clinton, defense spend
ing for fiscal year 1999 is limited to
about $270 billion, which Spence
and several Republican members
of his committee said isn't enough
to maintain full military readiness.
Spence calculated defense
spending will fall $54 billion
behind the rate of inflation in the
next five years, meaning programs
will have to be curtailed, he said.
The Pentagon acknowledged
Tuesday that maintaining a high
level of preparedness among its 1.4
million force is "a challenge." But
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
the military is still able to fulfill its
required capability of fighting two
major regional conflicts at the
same time if necessary.
In another measure in the
Defense Authorization Act for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. the
committee voted to set a limit on
spending for troops keeping the
peace in Bosnia to $1.86 billion for
the year. So far, some $10 billion
has been spent.
