Students should voice
their opinions about the
Toyon Eating Clubs

THIS YEAR'S Alpha Sig deba
cle led students to lash out at
Residential Education for not
paying attention to their needs. But
part of the responsibility rests with stu
dents. We need to be informed about
campus changes and mobilize to influ
ence decisions before they happen. If
students are serious about having a
voice in new policies, the future of the
Toyon Eating Clubs will offer them a
chance to prove it.
The eating clubs offer Toyon Hall
residents an alternative to University
dining services. Students appreciate
the high food quality and the choices
eating clubs offer. However, the clubs
are not University-owned, and their
future is far from certain. Next year,
Housing and Dining Services will
decide the fate of the eating clubs.
Next year may seem far away. But
students need to think about issues
now so that they can be informed par
ticipants in upcoming discussions. It's
useless to mount a protest once Hous
ing and Dining announces its plans
two years down the line. By then, plans
will have been made, and students will
be able to do little besides complain
that the University doesn't listen to
them.
When it was announced last quarter
that Toyon would offer priority to
sophomores, administrators declared
that the eating clubs were not in dan
ger- But Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Dining, recently said that
vvhen Toyon becomes eligible for Cap
ifal Improvement Plan renovations in

two years, some changes may be
effected on them.
The eating clubs' facilities are next
to the new Schwab Residential Center.
Guy called the clubs "a bit of an eye
sore" compared to Schwab. The club
facilities need renovation.
Guy informally mentioned two pos
sible options for the eating clubs. One
is to relocate the facility. The other is
to consolidate its operations into a
University-operated "eating-club
style" dining facility offering com
bined service for Toyon and Branner.
The first option forces the clubs to
come up with the money for renova
tions and for relocation. The second
option means that the University will
take over the food service for Toyon,
theoretically eliminating the indepen
dently-owned eating clubs.
Is this what students want? If they
value the eating clubs, they should let
Housing and Dining know that they
want to take part in planning meetings
about Toyon.
The problem is that Toyon will be
almost exclusively a one-class house.
Next year's sophomores might not
care if sophomores several years from
now eat mediocre food. But students
have to look at the bigger picture. As
University dining services begins to
consolidate, the eating clubs will
become one of the last alternatives to
typical dorm food.
If Housing and Dining ignores or
refuses to communicate with students,
then students will have something to
protest.
But administrators aren't evil ogres
out to make students' lives miserable.
Housing and Dining does an annual
survey to try to find out what students
think. The office makes the first step
by soliciting opinions. It's up to stu
dents to actively respond.
