## Like mother, like daughter 
### 
H OW MANY
times as a child
did you say you
never wanted to be like
your mother when you
grew up? Or that you'd
always let your son or
daughter do what your

mother forbade you to
do? Or that when she said, "Someday you'll
thank me for this!" that day would never
come?
Well, that day has come. And I'm not
talking about Mother's Day, which is this
Sunday, in case you've forgotten. I'm talk
ing about beginning to understand what
your mother was talking about all those
years.
Despite the fact that we were still a fair
ly traditional Chinese household, my moth
er had an avid interest in health food when
I was growing up.. We soon discovered that
some traditional dishes just don't go well
with brown rice, and pot stickers just don't
taste the same when they're made out of
whole-wheat Hour.
She didn't allow us to eat refined sugar,
so I hid my trick-or-treat candy at a friend's
house each year after Halloween. With an
inbred aversion to Western medication, my
mother substituted concoctions of herbs for
aspirin when 1 got sick. That usually did the
trick; I got well quickly because I didn't
want to drink something with the taste and

consistency of stewed bark.
UTuT KacTa mania for cleanliness that
went beyond leaving your shoes at the door.
I was not allowed to go barefoot on the
lawn because the water from the sprinklers
was supposedly contaminated. I became
scared about germs, pesticides, microwaves,
magnetic fields from high-tension wires and
other random invisible things. We even got
rid of our television when 1 was in the third
grade. (1 deeply resented this because 1 was
the only one in my class who couldn't watch
"Mr. Belvedere").
But, you know. I have a sneaking suspi
cion that I'm going to do the exact same
thing to my children. I'm going to put water
filters in the sink, air filters in their bed
rooms and cram Brewer's yeast down their
throats. And 1 know at first they're going to
hate me for it, but not for eternity.
Some things will never change. My
mother is still the only person who can bring
me to tears of rage and frustration within
half a minute. But I am closer to under
standing the actions she took when I was
growing up. and am starting to recognize
myself in her. and her in myself.
This past summer I traveled for three
weeks in Europe with my mother, which
some people, particularly my older sister,
thought I was crazy for doing. I'm sure
there were times when we drove each other
crazy, but I also realized that the two times
when you most wish your mother were

around arc when you're in ihe flu
or when you're alone in a foreign country.
And whenithose two situations combined
for me, my mother was invaluable. On a
good day, she out-walked me, out-talked
me and still had the energy left to chat up
the hotel receptionist.
I also realized that I had inherited my
appreciation for much of what we saw in
galleries or museums from her. When my
mother came to New York from Taiwan to
study, she devoured the arts.
She stood in lines for hours to attend
concerts or plays and braved crowds to get
Laurence Olivier's autograph. She skipped
classes to go see films by Truffaut and God
dard.
I can imagine her with the same feeling
of excitement I had when I went to a
gallery, the theater and a screening at the
London Film Festival all in the same day.
Giddy with culture that night, 1 understood
her, at 19, suddenly starry-eyed with what
the world had to offer her.
A while ago, my mother called me and
said that she's changed her outlook on life.
"I don't want to grow up," she said. "I just
want to grow." 1 hope in 38 years I'll feel the
same way.

thought and literature, still thinks aspirin is
dubious, refined sugar suspect and that
microwaves are just plain scary.
