Apologies given for officer
core election endorsements
To clarify, we were not endorsed by the
MEChA and SAIO officer cores. While
members of both cores may have support
ed us as individuals, neither organization,
to our knowledge, made an official
endorsement for either of the ASSU pres
idential slates.
We fully admit that the error in the
handbook statement was our fault.
There were two versions of the hand
book statement that were e-mailed to the
elections commission.
The version that was ultimately includ
ed in the statement was a preliminary ver
sion, and the officer cores of MEChA and
SAIO were "unintentionally" listed as
endorsements in that version.
We discovered the error only after the
statements had been printed and immedi
ately took action, contacting at least one
of the chairs of both organizations.
We sincerely and completely apologize

for any misconceptions and consequences
that this statement may have led to.
We are strongly committed to the com
munities of color at Stanford, and know
deeply the ramifications of misrepresent
ing any organization.

Rem full a made incorrect
generalizations about Israel
Aly Remtulla's column on Monday was
fraught with incorrect, unresearched
information.
I strongly encourage readers to ques
tion and research his statements, because
Remtulla boiled down an incredibly com
plex topic into sweeping generalizations
and inflammatory opinions.
Israel has many reasons to celebrate its
50th anniversary. Israel has a strong sig

nificance to many people throughout the
world. Jews view it as their homeland, a
place they are always welcome.
Thirty-six pcrcent of world Jews cur
rently live in Israel, but all Jews benefit
from a place where they can defend them
selves under their own government and
not depend on others to protect Jewish
civil rights.
Jews in the Diaspora have family in
Israel, feel pride in their Jewish homeland,
and aid in its development.
Jews living in the United States have
not only fought for Jewish causes, but they
often speak out against the prejudices of
other people.
Jews were very active in the civil rights
movements of the 1960s and in gaining
more rights and resources for blacks and
women.
In 19%, Israel provided $1 million in
food, medicine and technical relief equip
ment for Rwanda. Israel has provided $2.5
million in humanitarian aid to Bosnia in
1997.
Israel's doors are open to international
historical scholars and those wishing to

research their own roots in the region.
Israeli universities are top contributors
to international knowledge in the sciences
and humanities. Israeli high-tech compa
nies are internationally renown for their
innovations.
For such a young country, Israel has
created amazing infrastructure. It cultivat
ed a desert, provided health care to all cit
izens, built villages and cities, revived the
Hebrew language, and created a thriving
community that controls its own economy
and culture.
Israel strives for peace but knows how
to defend itself, bringing progress to all
the country's inhabitants.
Israel welcomes all Jews and helps
them with the politics and pragmatics of
immigration.
Recent immigrants have faced chal
lenges, but that is to be expected when a
million people immigrate to a country of
four million in the span of a few months.
Unlike many countries, Israel has an
amazing program for all immigrants, pro
viding housing, education, jobs and medi
cal care.

Israel has gained power and legitimacy
through its own citizens' hard work, earn
ing international respect for its rapid
achievements. Israel has a lot to celebrate.
