Apologies given for officer
core election endorsements
To clarify, we were not endorsed by the
MEChA and SAIO officer cores. While
members of both cores may have support
ed us as individuals, neither organization,
to our knowledge, made an official
endorsement for either of the ASSU pres
idential slates.
We fully admit that the error in the
handbook statement was our fault.
There were two versions of the hand
book statement that were e-mailed to the
elections commission.
The version that was ultimately includ
ed in the statement was a preliminary ver
sion, and the officer cores of MEChA and
SAIO were "unintentionally" listed as
endorsements in that version.
We discovered the error only after the
statements had been printed and immedi
ately took action, contacting at least one
of the chairs of both organizations.
We sincerely and completely apologize

for any misconceptions and consequences
that this statement may have led to.
We are strongly committed to the com
munities of color at Stanford, and know
deeply the ramifications of misrepresent
ing any organization.

Rem full a made incorrect
generalizations about Israel
Aly Remtulla's column on Monday was
fraught with incorrect, unresearched
information.
I strongly encourage readers to ques
tion and research his statements, because
Remtulla boiled down an incredibly com
plex topic into sweeping generalizations
and inflammatory opinions.
Israel has many reasons to celebrate its
50th anniversary. Israel has a strong sig

nificance to many people throughout the
world. Jews view it as their homeland, a
place they are always welcome.
Thirty-six pcrcent of world Jews cur
rently live in Israel, but all Jews benefit
from a place where they can defend them
selves under their own government and
not depend on others to protect Jewish
civil rights.
Jews in the Diaspora have family in
Israel, feel pride in their Jewish homeland,
and aid in its development.
Jews living in the United States have
not only fought for Jewish causes, but they
often speak out against the prejudices of
other people.
Jews were very active in the civil rights
movements of the 1960s and in gaining
more rights and resources for blacks and
women.
In 19%, Israel provided $1 million in
food, medicine and technical relief equip
ment for Rwanda. Israel has provided $2.5
million in humanitarian aid to Bosnia in
1997.
Israel's doors are open to international
historical scholars and those wishing to

research their own roots in the region.
Israeli universities are top contributors
to international knowledge in the sciences
and humanities. Israeli high-tech compa
nies are internationally renown for their
innovations.
For such a young country, Israel has
created amazing infrastructure. It cultivat
ed a desert, provided health care to all cit
izens, built villages and cities, revived the
Hebrew language, and created a thriving
community that controls its own economy
and culture.
Israel strives for peace but knows how
to defend itself, bringing progress to all
the country's inhabitants.
Israel welcomes all Jews and helps
them with the politics and pragmatics of
immigration.
Recent immigrants have faced chal
lenges, but that is to be expected when a
million people immigrate to a country of
four million in the span of a few months.
Unlike many countries, Israel has an
amazing program for all immigrants, pro
viding housing, education, jobs and medi
cal care.

Israel has gained power and legitimacy
through its own citizens' hard work, earn
ing international respect for its rapid
achievements. Israel has a lot to celebrate.

Israel deserves celebration
In Mr. Remtulla's Monday column,
"An Anniversary not to Celebrate," he
begs the question, "Can we consider Israel
a success story?" Perhaps if Mr. Remtulla
had done a little more investigation and
fact checking, he would have found much
cause to celebrate this historic milestone.
Israel was not founded as "a facile way
to remove Jews from Europe and North
America" but as a Jewish state in the tra
ditional Jewish homeland under the belief
that the Jewish people deserved a country.
In its first 12 years alone, over 12,500,000
people immigrated to Israel, over half
from Asia and North Africa.
Israel has not in fact gained land "with
support from the U.S. government and the

Jewish lobby." While the United States
has supported Israel as an ally, Israel has
only gained its land through counterat
tacks after its larger Arab neighbors initi
ated wars and thrice tried to completely
destroy Israel. The most significant U.S.
action affecting land was to negotiate the
Egypt-Israel peace treaty, which resulted
in Israel losing and not gaining land.
Has Israel been a success? It is the most
modern and high-tech country in the Mid
dle East. It has a stable parliamentary gov
ernment and a wonderful education sys
tem. All Israelis (including Arabs) have
access to Israel's health care system.
Israel's mere existence in the face of
the Arab armies, its fast-paced economy
and the home it has provided for countless
displaced people should remove any
doubts Mr. Remtulla has about Israel

being a success story and give him much
cause to celebrate.

Preserving ZAP\ character
Questions from Draw hopefuls in
recent weeks have prompted us to
respond to projections that next year's
Cowell Cluster will be something of a
"Bob Cluster," and a favorite for pre
ferred-year sophomores.
We are pleased to report that the Cap
ital Improvement Flan changes, while
having little effect on residents' private
domains, will help improve common areas
and social life. ZAP will never be a house
of closed doors.

ZAP has always valued a balance of
loose community life and formal social
functions, which the high board bill
reflects. The benefits of this social atmo
sphere carry responsibilities of cleaning
and caing for the house.
Students will participate increasingly in
cooking and team projects next year. T his
will help preserve ZAP's identity as a sell
op: an alternative to Cireek houses and
theme residences.
Finally, no amount of capital improve
ment could change the "feel" of ZAP
dark, mellow and simply far-flung from
campus center.
The carpets may look like Hotel Kim
ball. but the wood-paneling reminds you
that it's Cowell Cluster ... our beloved
home.
We look forward to a group of resi

dents who will help maintain and strength
en ZAP independence in coming years.
Best of luck in the Draw.

ernment and a wonderful education sys
tem. All Israelis (including Arabs) have
access to Israel's health care system.
Israel's mere existence in the face of
the Arab armies, its fast-paced economy
and the home it has provided for countless
displaced people should remove any
doubts Mr. Remtulla has about Israel

being a success story and give him much
cause to celebrate.

Preserving ZAP\ character
Questions from Draw hopefuls in
recent weeks have prompted us to
respond to projections that next year's
Cowell Cluster will be something of a
"Bob Cluster," and a favorite for pre
ferred-year sophomores.
We are pleased to report that the Cap
ital Improvement Flan changes, while
having little effect on residents' private
domains, will help improve common areas
and social life. ZAP will never be a house
of closed doors.

ZAP has always valued a balance of
loose community life and formal social
functions, which the high board bill
reflects. The benefits of this social atmo
sphere carry responsibilities of cleaning
and caing for the house.
Students will participate increasingly in
cooking and team projects next year. T his
will help preserve ZAP's identity as a sell
op: an alternative to Cireek houses and
theme residences.
Finally, no amount of capital improve
ment could change the "feel" of ZAP
dark, mellow and simply far-flung from
campus center.
The carpets may look like Hotel Kim
ball. but the wood-paneling reminds you
that it's Cowell Cluster ... our beloved
home.
We look forward to a group of resi

dents who will help maintain and strength
en ZAP independence in coming years.
Best of luck in the Draw.
