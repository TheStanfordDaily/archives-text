### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Two freshmen may face assault
charges stemming from a fight at the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity Rush re
treat three weeks ago.
Three rushees, freshmen Mike
Ternoey, Christian Felix and
1 iam/ah Ma/ari. were involved in the
altercation the night of April 17.
which resulted in the hospital treat
ment of Ternoey.

Ma/.ari and Felix are suspects in a
criminal investigation being conduct
ed by the Santa ( ru/ ( 'ounty Sheriffs
Department.
According to a source within the
Santa ( ru/ ( ounty Sheriffs Depart
ment. charges are likely. Due to the
severity of the injuries to Ternoey, he
expects felony charges of "assault
with serious bodily injury" to be filed
by the Santa Cru/ County District
Attorney's ()t lice.
I 'niversitv policy violations by Phi

Delt are also under investigation by
the (ireek Judicial Board and Suzan
na Mak. the University judicial offi
cer. In addition to the alleged assault,
several sources confirm that alcohol
was present at the Rush event, a vio
lation of dry Rush policy.
A civil action is also possible, said
Ternoey's lawyer. Todd Emanuel.
"11 the facts call It . it. Michael
could possibly sue the assailants and

possibly others," he said.

The fight took place late Friday
night at Laguna Beach, located about
X miles north of Santa Cruz. In his vic

Alcohol was present at the retreat
and was provided by members of the
fraternity, said former fraternity pres
ident Daniel Broderick.
According to the victim's state
ment. after a heated exchange of
words, Ternoey was punched by
Mazari. who was "noticeably intoxi
cated." Then he was kneed in the face
by Felix, who was "more intoxicated
than Mazari."
Fraternity members dispute this
version of events. According to one
witness who was nearby when the
fight broke out and witnessed its af
termath. the fight only involved
Ternoey and one other man.
In this account, a third rushee "got
involved and tried to break [the fight]
up." According to that witness, Ter
noey fell into the sand and landed on
a sharp object.
"Anger got out of control. It hap
pened so fast, there was nothing we

could do," he added.
"[Ternoey] wasn't drunk," the
witness said, "but he was intoxicated.
He knew what was going on, hut he
didn't break his fall."
According to Ternoey's state
ment, other members of the crowd
checked on him and restrained Felix
and Mazari. Broderick and another
fraternity member then took Ter
noey to nearby Dominican Hospital
in Santa Cruz. He was later taken to
Stanford Hospital.
Based on what Ternoey told him
after the incident, Broderick did
not believe Ternoey had been in
toxicated.
Broderick added that although al
cohol was brought to the retreat by
members, he did not think that the in
cident was a result of alcohol use.
"Judging by the time they arrived
and the time of the incident," it
doesn't seem likely that alcohol was a
major factor, according to Broderick.
When asked about the fight,
Emanuel responded, "Attack is a
better word."
He characterized the fight as both
unprovoked and intentional.
Emanuel reported that Ternoey re
quired several stitches in his face, and
the vision in his right eye is just com
ing back. His injuries also called for a
plastic surgeon. Ternoey said he had
a compound fracture in his face.
Emanuel, Ternoey's lawyer, said
he thinks investigators are close to
submitting the results of their work to
the district attorney in Santa Cruz
County. In response to inquiry, Felix
declined to comment, while Mazari
was unavailable for comment.
University action possible
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, said that the
Greek Judicial Board process will

end "in the next week. We need to do
it as soon as possible."
"We have Rush violations every
spring," she commented.
However, "only when clear viola
tion of University policy is suspected
does it go to the Greek Judicial
Board." The board's role is "to deter
mine what happened. Until the
process is complete, [Phi Delt is)
given the benefit of the doubt," I lowe
explained.

However, concerning the list of
allegations, "it's one of the most se
rious I have seen in terms of Rush
policy," said Heather Dunn, assis
tant director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
In providing liquor for rushees,
Phi Delt violated the Inter-Fraternity
Council and I Jniversity policy of dry
Rush. It states in 19981FC Rush poli
cy that "serious violations may be
passed on to the Greek Judicial
Board with sanctions imposed by that
body and/or by the Dean of Stu
dents."
In the past at Stanford, various
chapters have been suspended from
campus, lost their houses, been lined
or made to enroll in educational and
community service programs. The
most severe punishment would be
loss of a chapter's charter.
One concern about this decision is
its timeliness. II losing the house is a
possibility, then Phi Delt members
will have to enter the Draw.
Even with this consideration, "we
will not sacrifice a fair process in
order to make a decision before

Draw," Dunn said.
Fraternity reaction
Broderick explained that a "bad,
unfortunate injury occurred." He
conceded that there is a possibility
that Phi Delt might lose its house.
"Our primary concern is that
[Ternoey is) alright. The fraternity,
the alumni and everyone involved
feel horribly about what hap
pened."
"My reaction is sincere regret
and apologies to [Ternoey] and his
family. We would like to do any
thing that could make this easier for
him." He hoped for "a just resolu
tion" to what he described as a
"tragic incident."
The fraternity has been ordered
by the police not to contact Ternoey
and advised by Residence Dean
Andy Fernandez not to get in touch
with Ternoey's parents, Broderick
said.
According to the student who
was present after the light, a small
minority in the house has been caus
ing problems. He said the fraternity
is trying to work with the I Jniversity
through community service and
alumni involvement.
"It's hard to find 20 guys who
aren't going to have problems con
trolling themselves when under the
influence," he said. "When you're
shooting for numbers as well as
quality of guys, sometimes you have
to take the bad with the good."
"There were rules violated. [Phi
Delt] should be punished," he ad
mitted. "but it shouldn't entail los
ing the house."
Both Felix and Mazari eventual
ly decided to pledge Phi Delt. Ter
noey did not. Emanuel said,
"Michael has physically, emotional
ly been through hell."

and was provided by members of the
fraternity, said former fraternity pres
ident Daniel Broderick.
According to the victim's state
ment. after a heated exchange of
words, Ternoey was punched by
Mazari. who was "noticeably intoxi
cated." Then he was kneed in the face
by Felix, who was "more intoxicated
than Mazari."
Fraternity members dispute this
version of events. According to one
witness who was nearby when the
fight broke out and witnessed its af
termath. the fight only involved
Ternoey and one other man.
In this account, a third rushee "got
involved and tried to break [the fight]
up." According to that witness, Ter
noey fell into the sand and landed on
a sharp object.
"Anger got out of control. It hap
pened so fast, there was nothing we

could do," he added.
"[Ternoey] wasn't drunk," the
witness said, "but he was intoxicated.
He knew what was going on, hut he
didn't break his fall."
According to Ternoey's state
ment, other members of the crowd
checked on him and restrained Felix
and Mazari. Broderick and another
fraternity member then took Ter
noey to nearby Dominican Hospital
in Santa Cruz. He was later taken to
Stanford Hospital.
Based on what Ternoey told him
after the incident, Broderick did
not believe Ternoey had been in
toxicated.
Broderick added that although al
cohol was brought to the retreat by
members, he did not think that the in
cident was a result of alcohol use.
"Judging by the time they arrived
and the time of the incident," it
doesn't seem likely that alcohol was a
major factor, according to Broderick.
When asked about the fight,
Emanuel responded, "Attack is a
better word."
He characterized the fight as both
unprovoked and intentional.
Emanuel reported that Ternoey re
quired several stitches in his face, and
the vision in his right eye is just com
ing back. His injuries also called for a
plastic surgeon. Ternoey said he had
a compound fracture in his face.
Emanuel, Ternoey's lawyer, said
he thinks investigators are close to
submitting the results of their work to
the district attorney in Santa Cruz
County. In response to inquiry, Felix
declined to comment, while Mazari
was unavailable for comment.
University action possible
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, said that the
Greek Judicial Board process will

end "in the next week. We need to do
it as soon as possible."
"We have Rush violations every
spring," she commented.
However, "only when clear viola
tion of University policy is suspected
does it go to the Greek Judicial
Board." The board's role is "to deter
mine what happened. Until the
process is complete, [Phi Delt is)
given the benefit of the doubt," I lowe
explained.

However, concerning the list of
allegations, "it's one of the most se
rious I have seen in terms of Rush
policy," said Heather Dunn, assis
tant director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities.
In providing liquor for rushees,
Phi Delt violated the Inter-Fraternity
Council and I Jniversity policy of dry
Rush. It states in 19981FC Rush poli
cy that "serious violations may be
passed on to the Greek Judicial
Board with sanctions imposed by that
body and/or by the Dean of Stu
dents."
In the past at Stanford, various
chapters have been suspended from
campus, lost their houses, been lined
or made to enroll in educational and
community service programs. The
most severe punishment would be
loss of a chapter's charter.
One concern about this decision is
its timeliness. II losing the house is a
possibility, then Phi Delt members
will have to enter the Draw.
Even with this consideration, "we
will not sacrifice a fair process in
order to make a decision before

Draw," Dunn said.
Fraternity reaction
Broderick explained that a "bad,
unfortunate injury occurred." He
conceded that there is a possibility
that Phi Delt might lose its house.
"Our primary concern is that
[Ternoey is) alright. The fraternity,
the alumni and everyone involved
feel horribly about what hap
pened."
"My reaction is sincere regret
and apologies to [Ternoey] and his
family. We would like to do any
thing that could make this easier for
him." He hoped for "a just resolu
tion" to what he described as a
"tragic incident."
The fraternity has been ordered
by the police not to contact Ternoey
and advised by Residence Dean
Andy Fernandez not to get in touch
with Ternoey's parents, Broderick
said.
According to the student who
was present after the light, a small
minority in the house has been caus
ing problems. He said the fraternity
is trying to work with the I Jniversity
through community service and
alumni involvement.
"It's hard to find 20 guys who
aren't going to have problems con
trolling themselves when under the
influence," he said. "When you're
shooting for numbers as well as
quality of guys, sometimes you have
to take the bad with the good."
"There were rules violated. [Phi
Delt] should be punished," he ad
mitted. "but it shouldn't entail los
ing the house."
Both Felix and Mazari eventual
ly decided to pledge Phi Delt. Ter
noey did not. Emanuel said,
"Michael has physically, emotional
ly been through hell."
