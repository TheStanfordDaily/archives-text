## Liberté, toujours: Smoking ban limits freedoms 
### 
T. J. Babbitt

I'M NOT ASHAMED to admit it. I
don't mind secondhand smoke. Some
times I actually miss it when it's not
there, because it seems like an integral part
of experiencing a night on the town. I have
always done my drinking and dancing and
flirting in the midst of a mild haze of pleas
ant- smelling smoke.
So when the ban on smoking in Califor
nia bars went into effect this January, I have
to admit I was disappointed.
I was disappointed even though I am not
a regular smoker. Even though self-righ
teous friends said what a relief it was that
their shirts no longer "stank" of cigarettes
when they came home after a night in the
City.
Even though constant exposure to sec
ondhand smoke could conceivably pose a
small health risk to nonsmokers.
People in favor of banning smoking in
public places think of smoking as something
that economists would call a negative exter
nality.
True, the smoker gets the nicotine high,
but I get the smoke blown in my face.
For some people, the externality is actu

ally a positive one: you, chain smoker, are
running the risk of long-term health prob
lems, but 1 enjoy the atmosphere you pro
vide for free.
Ideally, this would all be sorted out by
the free market, with some establishments
becoming nonsmoking because they find it
helps them attract customers, and others
allowing smoking for the same reason.
The tide in the United States has turned
against cigarettes, and it seems that private
businesses would ban smoking in most
buildings without government help.
Unfortunately, when it comes to the
"war on drugs, American legislators all too
often abandon the free market and start
passing stupid laws.
Congress, for example, is currently
debating legislation that would restrict
tobacco advertising so heavily that, if
passed, the law might even be an unconsti
tutional infringement on free speech.
It is also considering levying punitive
taxes on cigarettes. The idea is to make the
cigarettes prohibitively expensive for
teenagers and other smokers, as well as to
find a politically correct way of raising taxes

and government spending. This would force
unpopular groups to pay more than Ihcir
lair share of taxes.
They're called "sin taxes," and they're
politically popular. Hut they're a bad idea.
Having smokers and drinkers finance more
national defense, education or public high
ways than nonsmokers and nondrinkers is
unfair and illogical.
Hut what about the second goal? Could
the tax hike Congress is considering cause
people to spend their money on something
other than cigarettes? Well, maybe, il the
tax were high enough.
A reporter from The New York limes
interviewed some teenagers about what
level of tax might cause them to cut down or
quit smoking. The consensus was some
where around $5 a pack.
"At that price, you might as well buy
weed," a teen told the reporter.
The idea that higher cigarette taxes
could induce people to substitute illegal
drug consumption for legal drug consump
tion might seem far-fetched, as does the
tobacco industry's prediction that a black
market could develop if cigarettes were

taxed too heavily. Hut it could happen.
Some prisons have banned smoking
among their inmate populations with pre
dictable results — a bustling black market
that drives prices sky-high.
Worse yet. inmates fight over cigarettes,
and some of those fights inevitably turn vio
lent.
I find all of this fascinating. Because of
my late birth, I never got to witness Prohi
bition firsthand, but maybe we'll all get to
relive that American experiment.
Right now, I am on the Stanford in
Berlin program, living on a continent that
feels very differently about smoking.
People here do not use the criminal jus
tice system to harass each other about wisps
of smoke. Smoking is a personal issue, not a
government issue.
If people don't want to be around people
smoking, they can go to places where smok
ing is not allowed. For example, smoking in
McDonald's is strongly forbidden and local
establishments are also moving in that
direction. Or people can sit in the increas
ingly common nonsmoking sections of
restaurants.

One thing that is the same on both sides
of the Atlantic are silly advertising cam
paigns for cigarettes. One advertisement for
Camels, which is presumably forbidden in
the United States because it might appeal to
children, shows a recently defenestrated
cartoon camel on fire. " Don't throw burn
ing camels out the window," says the adver
tisement.
Another campaign for Galojses
cigarettes shows appealingly nerdv French
people hanging around and runs with.the
copy. "Liberte. toujours." Freedom, always.
Well. I would be the last person on earth
to equate the ideals of the French Enlight
enment to a particular brand of cigarettes.
Just because people should have the free
dom to smoke doesn't mean that smoking
Galoises makes you free.
Still, the slogan has a valuable message
As America ponders the wisdom of a big
crackdown on smoking, we should all
remember that insisting on personal free
dom is the right idea — always.
