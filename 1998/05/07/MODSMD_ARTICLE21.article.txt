### Will Chang Contributing writer 
It's the March Madness of the
Ultimate Frisbee season.
Saturday and Sunday's Ulti
mate Regionals, hosted at UC-
Santa Cruz, are the last step on the
way to the national title. Only two
teams from each region in men's
and women's Ultimate will ad
vance.

ULTIMATE FRISBEE
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford men
and women participate in Regionals
competition, UC-Santa Cruz.

Even though both Stanford
teams are heavily favored to move
on to the national competition, the
pool is replete with tough competi
tors more than capable of pulling
off an upset against the Cardinal or
another top team.
The tournament's first day is
round-robin competition in which
the teams are divided into four
pools of four teams each. Each
team competes for seeding in the
second day of double-elimination
competition.
The Stanford women enter as
the only undefeated contestant in
this regional competition. The

Card has played and defeated
every team it will face this weekend
except Oregon State, which poses
the biggest threat.
"It will be the first time we play
Oregon this year," senior captain
Martita Emde said.
"They have been training all
year just to beat us. We are the
team to beat, and everyone is gun
ning for us."
The Stanford women also will
be facing the University of British
Columbia, whom they met at last
year's nationals.
Despite all of this, the Card en
joys many advantages.
First, the Stanford women have
the deepest team in the nation —
all 18 members of the A team can
carry the team in any circumstance.
Thus, while other teams are worn
down over the course of a long
tournament, the Cardinal can sub
stitute fresh players and keep the
pace up.
Second, Stanford's starting line
up is filled with franchise players.
Imagine having Jordan. Pippen.
Payton, Malone and Robinson on
one basketball team with a bench
of Richmond, Olajuwon and
Stockton.
Stanford has the Ultimate
equivalent in Emde, seniors An
drea Johnson, Chewie Chen, Ash
ley Simon and Maggie Mathiasand
junior Mary Hunt Martin.
Johnson is a nominee for LJlti
mate's top honor, the Callahan
Award.
The team is also in prime condi
tion and has been playing with con
fidence and mental toughness.
"It takes heart, adversity and
execution," Chen said. "We know
what it takes to win, and we are
going to."
On the men's side, regional
competition features five of the top
10 teams in the nation.
The men's A team enters as the
second seed behind IJC-Santa
Barbara.
The Card has only suffered four
defeats this year, while Santa Bar
bara has only two — both of which
came at Stanford's hands.

The Stanford team is the fastest
in collegiate Ultimate and exhibits
remarkable athleticism. Like the
Card women, the Stanford men
enjoy one of the deepest teams in
the nation.
"With teams like Santa Bar
bara, three to four players run the
show," said senior captain Alex
Young. "We can rely on our entire
team."
While the Stanford A team
blew through the sectionals easily,
the B team had to utilize all of its
resources to beat Cal and Davis at
the sectionals, with a close loss to
Santa Cruz.
The Stanford B team will defi
nitely be playing the underdog as
the 13th seed of 20 teams.
The Card will face the fourth,
fifth, 12th and 20th seeds the first
day. Then Stanford will have to
eliminate top-seeded Santa Bar
bara in order to move on to nation
als.
While nearly half of the B team
is made up of rookies, the group

has exhibited a maturity, raw ath
leticism and young talent that
Stanford has not seen for years.
"We are a team based on funda
mentals," senior B team captain
Ben Wang said.
"We need to take that to the
max. If we play every point as if it
was our last and we play at top
form, we can advance. Regionals
should not be the end of our sea
son."
During the preseason, the Card
set a goal for itself to play the best
it could. Watching the team, there
is no doubt they've succeeded.
The sectionals boosted the
Card's confidence.
Star player and senior captain
Dan Eisenberg has recovered from
injury. All of Stanford's plays from
the traditional stack offense to the
four-man cup zone defense have
been fine-tuned.
"This is it. We are at our peak."
Young said. "Our season can be
over or we can go all the way. This
is crunch time."
