■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford men
and women participate in Regionals
competition, UC-Santa Cruz.

Even though both Stanford
teams are heavily favored to move
on to the national competition, the
pool is replete with tough competi
tors more than capable of pulling
off an upset against the Cardinal or
another top team.
The tournament's first day is
round-robin competition in which
the teams are divided into four
pools of four teams each. Each
team competes for seeding in the
second day of double-elimination
competition.
The Stanford women enter as
the only undefeated contestant in
this regional competition. The

Card has played and defeated
every team it will face this weekend
except Oregon State, which poses
the biggest threat.
"It will be the first time we play
Oregon this year," senior captain
Martita Emde said.
"They have been training all
year just to beat us. We are the
team to beat, and everyone is gun

The Stanford women also will
be facing the University of British
Columbia, whom they met at last
year's nationals.
Despite all of this, the Card en
joys many advantages.
First, the Stanford women have
the deepest team in the nation —
all 18 members of the A team can
carry the team in any circumstance.
Thus, while other teams are worn
down over the course of a long
tournament, the Cardinal can sub
stitute fresh players and keep the
pace up.
Second, Stanford's starting line
up is filled with franchise players.
Imagine having Jordan. Pippen.
Payton, Malone and Robinson on
one basketball team with a bench
of Richmond, Olajuwon and
Stockton.
