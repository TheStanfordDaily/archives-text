Going into the 199K women's
golf season, Stanford head coach
Caroline O'Connor realized she had
a good opportunity to host this
year's NCAA West Regionals.

■ Today-Saturday: No. 6 Stanford
hosts the NCAA West Regionals,
Stanford Golf Course, 8 a.m.

Knowing she would have an ex
tremely young team, O'Connor
made a bid for the Stanford Golf
Course (par 73; 6,093 yards) and was
accepted.
Now, on the eve of the Western
Regionals, the inexperienced Cardi
nal hopes to reap the benefits of its
coach's clever foresight.
"I knew that it would be a great
chance for our young team to get a
little edge," O'Connor said. "I was
actually lucky that other schools
didn't apply to host, and now we are
looking at a great opportunity."
Earlier in the season, the Cardi
nal proved it could perform on its
home course when it won the Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate. In
that event, freshman phenom Hilary
Homeyer won her first collegiate
tournament.
"We have shown that we can play
well on our home course." O'Con
nor said. "We won in the fall and
gave ourselves a great boost of con

fidence. It just gives us a psychologi
cal edge to feel so comfortable on
the course."
However, more recently, the
Cardinal showed that it also can per
form poorly on its home layout, as it
finished fourth at the Peg Barnard
California Classic in April.
Although the Cardinal was play
ing on familiar grass, many of the
players felt it was harder to prepare
and focus for that tournament.
"It is hard to get into the tourna
ment mode when you are staying in
your dorm room," freshman
Stephanie Keever said. "It is diffi
cult to go to sleep in the dorms and
have to wake up at 5:30 and be ready
to play for real."
The Cardinal will be staying in a
hotel off campus for the weekend to
remove such concerns for this all
important event.
The strong field for the Region
als consists of 20 teams —11 from
the Far West District and nine from
the West District.
Fourteen of the participating
teams are ranked in the Master-
Card Top 25 poll, including four in
the top 10. Arizona leads at No. 1,
followed by No. 2 Arizona State.
No. 4 Tulsa. No. 6 Stanford and No.
9 Oregon.
Thirty individuals are ranked in
the top 50, led by Grace Park of Ari
zona State, the No. 1 player in the
nation.
The top 11 squads will advance to

the NCAA Tournament in Madi
son. Wise. The Cardinal is certainly
one of the favorites heading into the

three-day event and should advance
to the championship round.
"We are going into this tourna
ment with a positive mindset,"
O'Connor said.
"We know that this course allows
you to miss some shots, and we just

need to play smart and use our short
games to get up and down regular
ly"
Tournament play gets under way
today at 8 a.m.. but the Cardinal will
not tee off on the 10th hole until
12:25 p.m.
