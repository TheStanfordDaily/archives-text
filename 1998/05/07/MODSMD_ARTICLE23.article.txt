# A 						rookie among veterans
## Two-sport freshman Joe Borchard an asset to the Stanford lineup

The Baltimore Orioles were calling, but nobody
picked up the phone.
Camarillo High's three-sport star. Joe Bor
chard. needed to made a decision. The basketball
team's power forward, the Southern Section's foot
ball player of the year and the first team All-State
baseball hero had neared the conclusion of a fan
tastic high school career, managing to juggle far
more than the California town's average athlete.
But now. he had to choose which sport would
prove to be his calling, and many eagerly awaited
his decision. The Orioles, the University of Texas
Longhorns. the University of Arizona Wildcats
and most of the free world seemed interested in
which sport Borchard would continue to dominate.
When the time came, he dropped basketball...
and only basketball. While many schools recruited
the 6-foot-4. 195-pound athlete for football and
baseball, there was only one place where Borchard
knew a two-sport star could feel at home.
"If it was good enough for Chad [Hutchinson], it
was good enough for me," Borchard said.
Stanford's head football coach once played col
legiate baseball, and Stanford's head baseball
coach once played collegiate football. There was
little question, then, as to where Borchard's deci
sion to pursue both football and baseball would be
understood.
"I pretty much knew that the best situation for
me would be to go and play at Stanford," the fresh
man said. "They have had so many guys come here
and be successful playing two sports. It's also an
other thing you can talk about with your coaches.
They know what you're experiencing."

found his way over to Sunken
PI amond after football season
without knowing exactly what to ex
pect. While knowing that the Cardi
nal returned a powerful team, he
didn't anticipate just how large a
role in the team's season he would
j-flay.
' "I came in here just trying to
break into the lineup," he said. "I
missed a lot of fall practice so 1 was
just trying to show them what I
could do."
It didn't take Borchard long to
jjreak into the lineup, and now no
body can get him out.
Batting .326 and starting at either
the designated hitter or right field
position in just about every game
this season, the only freshman in the
yr j|> j
•starting lineup finds himself part of
the No. 1 collegiate baseball team in
the nation.
"It's ereat," Borchard said.

"There are a lot of guys here that
are going to go on and play at the
professional level, and it will be
great to say that I played with these
guys in college."
Perhaps they will be saying the
same thing about him.
"1 really enjoy hanging out with
these guvs off the field as well as
playing with them." Borchard said.
Thankfully, "they haven't declared
open season on me. I'm kind of still
waiting for it."
While he might be a rookie to the
team and he might be watching his
back when it comes to the pranks.
Borchard has another set of eyes
looking out for him — those belong
ing to junior pitcher Chad Hutchin
son. The two grew close last sum
mer in football practice, where
Hutchinson was the starting quar
terback and Borchard was redshirt
ing at the same position.
"We spend a lot of time togeth
er." Borchard said. "That gives us a
lot of common stuff to talk about.
He's just been a good guy to help me

out."
The veteran — who has been
through the grueling months of
practicing and playing one sport
after another — might come in
handy for the young Borchard, who
is learning how to squeeze in time to
study between practices and games.
"You do miss a lot of class," said
Borchard, who is considering histo
ry as a major. "You play such a long
season. Sometimes, you're just tired
and need to rest. It's been a tough
adjustment for me, but I think I'm
beginning to get used to it."
While his two-sport mentor
Hutchinson has an important deci
sion ahead of him — whether or not
he should leave Stanford football in
order to pursue a major league
baseball career — the young desig
nated hitter has plenty of time to
relax and enjoy playing two sports
for the Cardinal.
"All I can do is just go out, play,
get the opportunities and try to take
advantage of them." he said. "I'll
just take what I can get."
