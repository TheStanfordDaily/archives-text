## Two-sport freshman Joe Borchard an asset to the Stanford lineup

The Baltimore Orioles were calling, but nobody
picked up the phone.
Camarillo High's three-sport star. Joe Bor
chard. needed to made a decision. The basketball
team's power forward, the Southern Section's foot
ball player of the year and the first team All-State
baseball hero had neared the conclusion of a fan
tastic high school career, managing to juggle far
more than the California town's average athlete.
But now. he had to choose which sport would
prove to be his calling, and many eagerly awaited
his decision. The Orioles, the University of Texas
Longhorns. the University of Arizona Wildcats
and most of the free world seemed interested in
which sport Borchard would continue to dominate.
When the time came, he dropped basketball...
and only basketball. While many schools recruited
the 6-foot-4. 195-pound athlete for football and
baseball, there was only one place where Borchard
knew a two-sport star could feel at home.
"If it was good enough for Chad [Hutchinson], it
was good enough for me," Borchard said.
Stanford's head football coach once played col
legiate baseball, and Stanford's head baseball
coach once played collegiate football. There was
little question, then, as to where Borchard's deci
sion to pursue both football and baseball would be
understood.
"I pretty much knew that the best situation for
me would be to go and play at Stanford," the fresh
man said. "They have had so many guys come here
and be successful playing two sports. It's also an
other thing you can talk about with your coaches.
They know what you're experiencing."
