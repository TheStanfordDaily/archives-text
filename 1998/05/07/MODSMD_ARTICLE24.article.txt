# Mulitauaopele, Owen set to join
## ABL drafts two 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Funny how things seem to work
out in the end — just ask senior
Naomi Mulitauaopele.
The 6-foot-4 center was selected
in the second round of Monday's
American Basketball League draft at
San Jose Arena by her hometown
Seattle Reign as the 13th overall pick
Senior forward Heather Owen
was selected by the Portland Power
late in the fourth round. 3Sth overall.
Mulitauaopele. who sat out this
season due to a knee injurv and had a
year of eligibility remaining, had an
nounced in early March that she was
going to graduate and pursue oppor
tunities in professional basketball
When she made her announce
ment. the center had mentioned the
close ties to her family, so the oppor
tunity to go home obviously w as ver\
appealing.
"It all worked out perfectly."
Mulitauaopele said. "I had a gtx*J
feeling about it (heading into the
draft) because 1 had spoken to the
(Seattle) coaches and they said they
were doing regional picks."
Terms of her two-year deal were
not disclosed, but she jokingly said
the contract "makes leaving Stanford
worthwhile. And being at home is an
added bonus."
Mulitauaopele said recovering
from her knee injury factored into
her choosing the ABL over the
WNBA. She will be cleared to play

bv July, too late for the WNBA tea
son. which begins June 11.
For Owen, last season was a real
opportunity to fill the void left by
Mulitauaopele and display her full
potential. She came through with her
best season ever, averaging 10 points
per contest in 27
Among her highlights were a teatfl
high 21 points against Connecticut
and a 13-point. 11-rebound perfor
mance against California.

But despite a solid workout at the
recent ABL combine, she was not sr
lected until the fourth round, whitjh
means she is not guaranteed a s[x it i
Portland's roster until she passes life
team's trvout. J
Mulitauaopele and ()wen are
of the five Cardinal seniors on ttte
basketball team planning to pick uy
their basketball careers beyond tile
Farm. All five of them getting drafted
or signed by the ABL. or WNBA iva
nice reward for a Stanford run that
saw the quintet go 113-14 overall, win
four Pacific 10 Conference titles ami
participate in three consecutive Finpl
Fours. ;
"There definitely wasn't any su)
pnse." Mulitauaopele said of hit
classmates moving on to the proto*
sional leagues. "We had a reallv tal
* ft
ented class, so we had a great feeling
about moving on to bigger things
We're ready for the next level and
we're ready tosee how everyoneel|c
does."
Owen could not be reached I'Ar
