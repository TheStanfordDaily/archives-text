# Sincere apologies

### 
The Stanford Daily would like,
to extend an apology U >1
unbalanced sports coverage
of the rugby national championship
tournaments.
As many readers have noticed,
the men's rugby second-place finish
was run on the front page of Mon
day's paper, while the women's
rugby national championship victo
ry ran on Tuesday's sports page.
The men's rugby story was run on
the front page on Monday with the
intention of running the women's
rugby story on the front tlv. n xtday
as well. However, due to an honest
miscommunication among staff
members in the office, this goal was

not achieved.
In no way did we intend to imply
that the women's first-place victory
was less important than the men's
second-place finish.
The men's tournament was
played in Balboa Park in San Fran
cisco; the women's played in Penn
sylvania. Consequently, the writer
of the women story needed more
time to write the story, as he had to
wait for the team to return in order
to get quotes.
It is standard practice that writers
for weekend road games are given
an extra night to contact team mem
bers returning late on Sunday. An
informed articic with quotes from

players is well worth waiting an
extra day.
(lender cquit) is not an issue
taken lightly at The I >aily. This year.
The Daily believes it has given fair
coverage to all the teams of both
genders. We have also run news sto
ries on the gender double standard
in NCAA insurance programs.
Again, we sincerely apologize for
the error. There is no excuse for the
miscommunication that occurred.
But this mistake should not be in
terpreted as a representation of The
Daily's overall lack of concern for
gender equity. This was a one-time
mistake; we will work to ensure that
no such oversight occurs again.
