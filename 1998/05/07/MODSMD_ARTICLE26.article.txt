three divisions of last weekend's National Wrestling

in IWS by John duPont. on whose estate he had been
living.
Stanford's Patricia Miranda, a freshman, lost in the
championship match to Stephanie Murata of Sunkist
Kids. Her second-place finish topped all other Card
wrestlers.
"Patricia's wrestled Murata a couple times, and each

time the match is tougher than the last." said teammate
Kayvon Bina. a freshman. "One of these days she-s
going to whup up on her." *
In the freestyle division, the elub placed six wrestlers,
led b\ George Mason University assistant coach Jtfci
McCiovern and Lehigh University assistant Joel Sh.if
ratt. who took third in the 167- and 187-pound weight
classes, respectively. The Sunkist Kids team won ilt*'

The team's success continued in
the Greco-Roman division, which
was dominated by the Armed
Forces team. The Dave Schultz club
managed to place five wrestlers,
good enough for second place.
Stephen Neal of Cal State-Bak
ersfield wrapped up the competi
tion with his sixth-place finish in the
heavyweight division.
The club came close to stealing
the women's event as well, placing
all its wrestlers while winning one
weight class (Kansas' Jimi Horn
buckle at 136 pounds) and taking
second in three others.
That success came despite the
club's relative paucity of entrants.
Minnesota-Morris, the eventual
winner, arrived with 26 wrestlers,
while the Dave Schultz club entered
only six.
