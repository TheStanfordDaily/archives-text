# Grads get emergency housing aid
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
This year, a significant number of
graduate students suffered financial
crises due to rapidly increasing housing
costs in the Stanford area. In response,
the I Jniversity is establishing the (iradu
ate Student Housing Emergency (Irani
to assist students in emergency housing
crises.
According to Assoc. Dean of (iradu
ate Policy Thomas Wasow. housing
prices around the Stanford area have
been increasing by 20 percent per year.
That is significantly greater than the in
crease in graduate student income.
The Provost's Office has increased
graduate student stipends and assistant
ships this year in an effort to cover rising
housing costs. I'he average graduate as
sistantship increased 6.5 percent.
I his increase, however, still falls short
of the increased cost of housing. "N't)
one's income goes up as fast as housing
costs." Wasow said.
The rising costs have led to increased
complaints among graduate students
and also from concerned faculty this
year, according to Wasow. The emer
gency grant is intended as a one-time cri
sis grant for students lacing immediate li

nancial difficulty with off-campus hous
ing.
Some emergency situations that the
grant is intended for are: students whose
rent is increased at short notice beyond
their ability to pay and who need help
making the rent while looking for cheap
er housing: students whose leases are ex
piring, if the rent is going up and the stu
dent has found cheaper housing but the
leases overlap, or if there is a gap be
tween the end of the old lease and the
start of the new one; il a student's apart
ment building is destroyed and he or she
must find more expensive housing.
The grants range from $100 to $ 1.0(H)
and will be limited to doctoral and law
students living off campus. Students
must complete an application from the
Financial Aids ()t lice. A special commit
tee consisting ol Wasovv and representa
tives from the graduate financial aid of
fice. Housing and Dining Services and
the Provost's ()ftice will evaluate the ap
plications. According to Wasovv. a re
sponse will be provided "usuallv within
10 working days."
The program is modeled after an ex
isting aid program for graduate students
called Grants in Aid, which provides for
personal emergencies such as deaths in
the family and health problems.

I his grant is one of a number of solu
tions intended at alleviating the graduate
housing crunch on campus. Wasow said.
" The l ! niversit\ is committed to build
ing substantial new housing in the next
two to three years." Wasow said.
C hanges are also being made to the
priority system tor graduate housing. In
the old system, first-year students and
students with families were guaranteed
housing while everyone else entered the
lottery. Starting next vear. the lotterv

will be split into first- and second-priori
ty levels. Master's students will have two
years of lirst priority while doctoral stu
dents w ill have six.
"Those students in the second-priori
ty levels will probably not get housing."
Wasow said.
More spaces are also being made in
existing graduate housing. "Some singles
will be conserted to doubles and some
