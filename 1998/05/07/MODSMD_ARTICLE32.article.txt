### Brian Eule Staff writer 
Continuing a long-standing
tradition on college campuses
across the nation, the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault will con
clude its Rape Awareness Week
tonight with a " Take Back the
Night" march. The march is one
of the many activities held this
week by the coalition in order to
raise awareness of problems of
sexual assault.
"We're about empowerment,
communication between men
and women and romantic part
ners, supporting the healing of
survivors, and breaking the si
lence around rape." said junior
co-coordinator Marian Ham
mond. "I think we have a great
program this year."
The march will cap off a week
that has included such projects as
the "Clothesline Project." de
scribed as a powerful survivor art
project to raise awareness on
campus about sexual assault, and
the "Survivor Fence," where rib
bons are tied to a wire fence to
represent and empower sur
vivors.
"It's symbolic." Hammond
said. "We will march around the
Stanford campus ... to support
survivors and demand the right
for women to walk alone at
nii>ht."

The ceremony will begin at 7
p.m. in White Plaza with a one
hour free concert performed by
the group the Girl and I. After the
concert, Hammond and co-coor
dinator Esther Park will speak
briefly before survival testimoni
als are given. The ceremony will
conclude with the actual march
and a reception in the Women's
Center. Participants of the march
are advised to bring a candle and
a cup to catch the wax.
In addition to the two ongoing
projects this week, several work
shops have been held, including
one on sex and violence in addi
tion to a self-defense workshop.
"All of these activities are re
ally focused on participation,"
I lammond said.
While Rape Awareness Week
does draw attention to the coali
tion's objectives, there has been
some negativity at times. Last
year, there was an incident of
vandalism in which excrement
was smeared upon the T-shirts in
the clothesline project. This year
there have been a small number
of negative responses. Ham
mond. however, wants to keep
the coalition's focus on a positive,
informative message.
"We just felt that we don't
want to change what we are
doing," she said. "Our focus is
raising awareness to the issue and
supporting survivors."
