## Kristin Hersh 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
No one noticed that I was hopelessly late and freezing cold during my interview with
Kristin Hersh, founder and former member of the underground band Throwing Muses.
When 1 finally showed up to meet her at Palo Alto's Cubberley Community Center, huffing
and puffing from exertion, Hersh was busy sound-checking. Her friends, family and dog
were outside the auditorium playing with her bubble-headed roly-poly baby boy, Wyatt.
Mark Weiss, head of Earthwise Productions, the company responsible for

bringing Hersh to Palo Alto, told me that they'd
be sound-checking a little while longer. So I
headed to the nearby supermarket to ask some
questions and get a bite to eat.

It could have been any day. The supermarket

checkout boys were taking their 6 p.m. break. A

woman in the parking lot was waiting for a ride.
Cars drove up and down Middlefield Road at

the same pace they probably always did. It
was rush hour, a big star was coming to

Palo Alto, and things were moving along as
usual.
"Who?" was the response I got from
anyone 1 asked about Hersh. Although
some were excited after I recited a brief
history of her career, few understood the
importance of her visit. She's a biggie.
Hersh, called the "modern day loan of
Arc of Rock" and "the antithesis of the
Spice Girls," began her rock career in the
early eighties. Ever since the age of nine,

when Hersh picked up her first guitar, she's

been able to create new and interesting

sounds. At the age of 14, however, things

changed. She began hallucinating and hearing

voices. Soon Hersh's hallucinations became the ba

sis of all of her lyrics, lending them a quality that no
one could mimic or mock. Meanwhile, Hersh and her best

friend Tanya Donelly taught themselves to play guitar. After

Hersh's mother married Donelly's father, the two girls created what

became the Throwing Muses, a group that slowly began to gain respect in the
Boston punk scene. By the time the two girls graduated from high school, they were
signed to 4AD records, a British label.
Over the years, the Throwing Muses became more Hersh's personal domain;
Donelly had to drop out to pursue her own musical horizons. Those horizons were
called The Breeders and Belly. The Throwing Muses finally broke up in 1997.

A couple of the members of the Throwing Muses helped Hersh create her first solo al
bum, "Hips and Makers," in 1994. Rolling Stone called it "one of (the Muses'] best." Her
most recent album, "Strange Angels," called "a thorough delight" by the Boston Globe, is
quite folksie â€” a distinct change from the rock 'n' roll-ness of her Throwing Muses days.
"Folk used to make me cringe [as I was] growing up," Hersh said. "I'm a rockhead. I
cut my teeth on electric guitar. But folk music is the original stuff. It's only recently that
people started playing music to make money. Originally, music was just for the family.
You played in the living room if there was a guitar around, or for your friends in the bar."
Hersh has little patience for other women singer / songwriters. "[The an

noyance with them] is justified. I am sick of whiny women."

And Hersh has a right to be sick. As the Muses grew in pop
ularity during the late 70s, Hersh's hallucinations contin

ued to worsen. In an interview with Melody Maker,

Hersh spoke about her emotional turmoil. At one

point, she walked through a blizzard for 24 hours,

trying to calm herself. "I was so angry with my

self for turning into a crazy person that there
was no fear," she told the English music cul

ture magazine.
That was in 1978. It wasn't until 1990 that

she checked into a mental institution, where
she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a
condition very much like schizophrenia.
Although she wrote about what she was
experiencing, her lyrics weren't so much
complaining as they were descriptive.
In the meantime, Hersh has become a
mother, wife and cult figure.
Hersh's music and her family have al

ways been connected. When asked about
how it felt to tour with her family, she was

very clear. "I'm pretty used to it. I've had kids
ever since I started making records. It's pretty

civilized to have your family with you. They're a

nice foil for me. They keep my feet on the ground

and keep me healthy.

"I just made an Appalachian music record [with my fam

/ rr * '
ily]. Ryder (my 6 year old) played backup [guitar], my husband

played a big mayonnaise jar, and the baby's on it somewhere. 1 don't

think I'll do that again."
It's no coincidence that Hersh came across so kindly. She describes herself as having
"no ambition whatsoever."
"In my bag I carry around a list of things I could do other than [tour and play music].
I could be a baker. That's a good one. But I don't like heat. Apparently ovens are very hot."
It's a pity I couldn't stick around for her concert. Good music is very hot, too.
