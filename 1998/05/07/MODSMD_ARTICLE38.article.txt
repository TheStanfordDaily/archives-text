# Frenetic, funky acoustic folk music Apricot Jam's James White
## 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
Intermission spoke with James
White, who plays upright bass for
the Portland-based band Apricot
lam. An upcoming visit to Stanford
on Monday and the scheduled re
lease of a new album in June made
White more than willing to talk
about everything from how Apricot
Jam got its name to Gertrude Stein.
Intermission: How did
Apricot Jam start?
James White: We formed
spontaneously in November 1991.
We had all been independently in
vited to a party, although [Lewi
and Shawn and I] knew each other
peripherally. Everyone had been
invited to bring instruments, and
there was a big electric jam session
going on. The three of us were
waiting for our turn to join in
when the police came by and shut
down the jam.
As it happened, the three of us
were the only ones who had
brought acoustic instruments, so
we were able to play. I guess you
could say we were born by police
intervention (laughter). It just
worked, you know? Sometimes
you play with another musician
and it's like talking to a brick wall.
With others it's a two-way street.
I: When did it turn into a
"band"?
JW: We started playing coffee
house gigs backing up our lead
singer, Shawn. Pretty soon, people
were turning out for our shows and
pushing aside tables to dance. That
was when we said, "Hey, we've got
something here." We also got our
name at one of those gigs. Know
how everybody has his or her own
list of awesome band names? At one
show, we asked the audience to
write it down and send it to us. The
name that won was Greasy Uncle
Apricot, and a few months later we
changed it to a more "acceptable
to-our-parents" name.
I: Describe your sound.
JW: That's one of the hardest
questions you can ask a band, un
less it is a Hootie and the Blowfish
cover band (laughter). I'll stab at it
anyway ... how about frenetic,
funky acoustic folk music?
I: So some of your influences
would be ... ?
JW: We all come from fairly dif
ferent musical backgrounds. Shawn
comes from the Paul Simon / Cat
Stevens singer-songwriter end of
things. Lewi comes from The Who
/ Rolling Stone/Black Flag / P.

Funk school. And I come from the
John Scofield / Charlie Parker / Sun
Ra side ... and Beethoven, too. It all
gets stirred in a big pot.
I: So who does the songwriting
in Apricot Jam?
JW: Shawn came to the band
with about 30 originals, which
we've been playing. Lewi and I
have been writing since the band
came together as well. I'd say that
Shawn has written about half the
songs, Lewi has written a third of
our songs, and me the rest.
I: So you've written one-sixth of
the songs?
JW: (Laughter) Let's see, one
half is three-sixths, and one-third
is two-sixths, which is five-sixths,
which means, yeah, I've written
one-sixth of our songs.
I: What's the process of song
writing in the band? Do people
bring fully formed songs to the
group?
JW: Actually, usually someone
will just have some loose chord
structures and lyrics. The arrange
ment and individual parts evolve
through practice and live perfor
mance. We do lots of arranging on
the fly, a sort of improv arranging.
One night we'll take a song in a
particular direction and like it, and
then we'll try to get back there the
next night. We've got a strong ethic
about wanting the songs to assume
a life of their 0wn.... You know
how you asked about our influ
ences earlier? 1 left out that all
three of us coalesce on Neil Young.
He's so good. There's a quote I like,
from Gertrude Stein, that goes
something like, "Immature artists
borrow from other artists, mature
artists steal." What that means is
not that we're trying to sound like
anyone else, but that it's about tak
ing what you like and adding it to
yourself. Music is a language and
you try to increase your vocabu
lary by learning the tradition and
the stuff that comes before you.
I: So what's it been like living in
a rock band?
JW: The last three years we've
been touring every other month.
We recently moved to Portland,
stopped touring and tried to get
some things happening locally.
Now that that's happened, we're
getting more confident about get
ting back on our loop. Portland's
closer to the places where we enjoy
playing, like the Bay Area.
We haven't been on tour since
November, weekend gigs excluded.
It's been really good, we've got a
bunch of new material, and we es
tablished a regular rehearsal

schedule. This coming from m
band that didn't rehearse for ftp
first three years.
I: Any plans to go back into tabih
JW: Actually, we just finished M
project that we're going to relemK
the first week of June. It's for
die label called Lotus Sound. AflgS
going to Stanford we're goi|*||
down to New Mexico for a CD |®
lease party and then we'll codbfi
back up through California. ' ■Wik
The album is called "Nfi
Fancypants," and it was reCQgpfi
all live, in the studio. It's great,al|
cause we get the clarity of the sfsm
dio with the energy of the live pqPIl
formance. Our first album was a&l
separately tracked, so this is like a|t|
official bootleg.
I: Who's your favorite artist tig
JW: Trillian Green. For
think it's with Zuba, from BouijlV
Colo. We've played at the last ftwn
High Sierra Music Festivals,
got to jam with String ChJKs
Incident and Leftover SalriHy
That's also where we got to*@
with Trillian Green. I
the first time I was at the festraEH
was like there were more pJBfl
there playing in the festival tjwp:
listening to the festival. Wal|H|

I: Do you feel tapped
community of musicians ugil
Portland?
JW: Oh yeah, that was oifl
the main reasons why we left jfl
Mexico. The musical commuH
there is so striated and jjfl
mented; there's tots of dissinjH
other bands. We got
were amazed to find all these olu
bands that were glad to welcifl
people into their family, fill
blew us away. At High Sierra N4H
Festival, it instantly felt like wM
longed there. It was like we |H
coming home. The festival leffl
to want to move somewhere waH
we could be a part of that conifl
