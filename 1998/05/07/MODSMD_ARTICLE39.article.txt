# Going Against the Grain:
## Down Low of G.P Wu 
### Ryan Snyder 
On its debut album, "Don't Go Against the Grain," G.P. Wu proves that it isn't simply a Wu-
Tang clone. Pop the Brown Hornet, Down Low Recka, June Luva and Rubberbands have been

down with The Great Eight from the git (they got
shouts out on "Enter the 36 Chambers"), but
they are definitely in their own groove. So, as G.P.
Wu itself says, "You better recognize G.P. fuck all
that other bullshit, basically."
You have to resist pegging G.P. Wu as deriva
tives. You have to recognize their critique of
mainstream rap, including anything affiliated
with Puff Daddy and other "fake playa-ass killa
emcees" who talk about all the people they've
killed while holding empty bottles of Cristal
and, as Mos Def puts it, "making videos in
homes that you know you'll never own."
G.P. Wu walks a hip-hop tightrope, being
neither flashy nor preachy while succeeding at
being what all these platinum punks want to be
— that is, real — by just being themselves.
It's a seemingly simple task. But it's tough to
pull off. Not only do you have to resist the im
mediate fortune and fame of the sell-out route,
but you've got to be connected to a situation in
which you have control of the end product.
That's hard to come by in the major label music
industry. These four everyday people have man
aged to infiltrate the mainstream and give hope
in the expanding hip-hop world, in addition to
producing the bulk of the album themselves,.
G.P. Wu proves that there's room for both real
ness and mass appeal in the music industry, and

that anyone with talent can get their message heard on a global scale.
Eager to learn and make sure we were hearing the message in the music, Intermission got
ajchance to sit down and talk with G.P. Wu member, Down Low. But the man threw a curve
by saying that because G.P. Wu's debut includes many different elements that float through
the hip-hop community (consciousness-raising, partying, thug life), and different people
can take away different things, "the album is not really a message. You gotta wait for the
movie or the book to get our message."
Or you can sit down and have a serious intellectual discussion.
Though he deflected questions about the philosophical content of G.P.'s music, Down Low
was kind enough to give Intermission the exclusive details of the book he's working on: "The
book is gonna be about the reality of life. It's definitely gonna be education. You're not gonna
be able to just read that. You're gonna have to read a little and go back. By the time you get to

chapter eight, you're gonna have to go back to chapter one."
Sounds like some deep stuff. He expects people to come to his
work with the same ethic that guides his own studies.
When asked about what gives him the strength to do the
work he does, Down Low simply said, "Spiritually — books.
Read. That keeps my spiritual on point. 1 just read, and I like
to read everything. Whatever I get my hands on, I'll read it."

'Life is a balance. You cant have
peace without war, you cant have
love without hate, and everybody
cant be rich.'

This sort of intellectual inclusiveness stretches beyond Down Low's reading list and into
the realm of personal experience. Everyday experience plays a large role in shaping the way
he looks at the world, varying from the deepest levels of thought right down to the basics.
"I've worked plenty of jobs, ever since I was 16. I'm 26 now. I've worked a lot of jobs and I
saw that if you didn't have money, then you weren't really gonna go that far. If you didn't
have knowledge, then you weren't really gonna go that far. The things that my experiences
taught me is that if you didn't have something, then you weren't gonna get nothing. If you
don't know nobody, then you wasn't gonna get to know nobody."
What is it that he has now?
"I have knowledge, I have experience. Having knowledge, being able to speak your
knowledge and being able to understand what you're speaking — that's all you really need.
If you don't have that, than you're not gonna get nowhere. It all basically starts with just
knowing what you gotta do."
But the question of what Down Low, or any of us, know at any particular point in time
is a difficult question.
"I can't really put my finger on what I know now, because I don't pick and choose what
I wanna know about. I soak in whatever comes. That's the secret. Whatever comes to you,
take it in. If you don't understand, ask questions. It's everything. It's not just one thing or
two things, it's everything in life, whatever comes your way. If it's bad for you, let it go. You
never know. Life is a balance. You can't have peace without war, you can't have love without
hate, and everybody can't be rich."
His dynamic and improvisational perspective on the world compounds Down Low's

frustration with the narrow corner that the mainstream media tries to paint hip hop into.
And so there are definitely things about hip hop, as it is taken up by the radio airwaves and
major labels that he doesn't like.
"I don't like Puffy. I don't like Mase — and, yeah, you can quote me, I'm a player-hater,
'cause this is not a game to me, it's a business. I

don't like people comin' up in here playing with
my craft like that and throwin' the wool over my
fans' and the consumers' eyes, makin' them think
that they're getting something that they're not re
ally getting. 1 don't like brothers like that. I don't
like people who talk about shootin', how much
crack they sellin' and all that."
This corporate appropriation, trading off of
a stereotypical "gangsta" or "playa" image to
make quick loot without paying respect to the
hip-hop tradition and the other music it bor
rows from, is more than just a disrespect to the
hip-hop artform. "That's just a disrespect to
people, period. It's a universal disrespect. I don't
damn people for doing what they do, but don't
put your business all out in the street like that.
No matter what kind of bad things 1 do that
make me get respect, I would never put that out
in the open, 'cause this is what I gotta do to sur
vive, this is what I do to live, this is what I do to
eat. If you rappin', you rhymin', you making
music, then that's your bread and butter right
there, you ain't out in the streets no more. I un
derstand you went through it, you lived it. If
you liked it you should have stayed there. If
they'da liked it, they wouldn'a got into rappin'.
It's obvious they wanted a way out. They keep
themselves in the past, by bringing it back up all

the time."
What's the cause of this problem? "The reason why the world is in chaos is because of
money. I think money is the root of all evil. Because money is what makes people poor.
Everything comes from the earth. Why put a price on these things? They're put here for all of
us to enjoy."
How do we change things?
"Everybody would have to be equal. First of all, there would be no money, there would
be no government overruling everybody. It's like we're overlookin' each other, and I don't
think that that's right."
But within our global community, this type of social change is a large order. "There's bil
lions of people right now. If it does change, that's gonna be a hell of a change. If it's gonna

change, it's gonna take something drastic. Nobody's really trusting

anybody right now. I might get a million people following me, but
then there's another million saying, 'Forget that.' So it's gonna take
something really drastic for everybody to wake up and listen."
To build the trust necessary to support a collective movement
for social change, it seems we need to start with our smaller local
ized communities and branch outwards. We all have to share the
- work. "You gotta work from your core. You can start with yourself

and then you work outwards. If you touch one person, that person might touch two people,
those two people might touch two other people. You just gotta spread it like that. It just gets
tighter and tighter. It's like paying your dues."
Thus, Down Low's "whole goal in life is to make a foundation for my family." His sense
of family, however, stretches beyond any narrow technical definition; it's also a large part of
what G.P. Wu is about as a hip-hop group.
"We were all born and raised in the same projects, so when it was time to go to school, we
went to the same school. We've always been together, we always been rhymin' together and
we always represented G.P." As much as it is a family relation, it's also an inclusive cultural at
mosphere with room for different people to do different things and remain on the same vibe.
Describing the group's creative process, Down Low explained that "we always write by
ourselves, we never sit down and write a song together. The way we did the album is we got
a beat, and I'd go in one room, Pop would go in another room, June would go in this room,
Bands would go into another room. But somehow, some way, it always came together and it
always fit." What is it that brings the members of G.P. Wu together? "It's just knowing your
self, and knowing your history, and knowing your culture, and knowing everybody's culture."
The infusion of independent spirit and collective ethic expressed in music pushes Down
Low and G.P. Wu into the future even as they work for creative change in the present and re
spect the past. As Down Low puts it,Tma always do music, I'ma always write books. I've been
writing rhymes for 14,15 years, and I just got a deal, so it's not like that's gonna ever stop. I've
always wanted to write books. If my career doesn't really go nowhere, I'll just take it to the
street. If I have to get a job or something, after work, I'll be up in the clubs, snatchin' the mic."
