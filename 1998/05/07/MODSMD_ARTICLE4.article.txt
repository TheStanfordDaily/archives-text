# ASSU grad housing survey finds deep concerns
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
Last week, nearly 1.300 graduate stu
dents responded to an online housing
survey conducted by the ASSU Task
Force on (iraduate Student Housing and
the Graduate Student Council.
The result is indicative of graduate
students' concern over the University's
housing crunch. Last week, only about 4
percent of graduate students vote ' in the
ASSI presential runoff election.
According to Jesse Adams, a master's
student in mechanical engineering and a
graduate resident assistant in Crothers
Memorial, the responses have been so

great because "this cuts a little closer to
home."
"The graduate students are worried
about housing. Those off campus are
worried that they can't afford it and those
on campus are worried about not getting
housing," said Robert Rudnitsky, a grad
uate senator.
One of the main complaints from
graduate students concerns the decision
by the University to change some existing
singles to doubles and doubles into
triples, according to Stephanie Toering, a
second-year doctoral student in bio
chemistrv and chair of the graduate hous-
ing advisory committee.
According to Rudnitsky. the ini
tial responses to the survey have
been very good. "We've been get
ting very well thought-out respons
es."
The purpose of the survey is to
get more student input on the cur
rent housing situation and inspire
administrative change to address
the problem.
"We think the University isn't re
sponding fast enough to the prob
lem and could do more to help the

situation." Adams said.
"We really hope the survey will
bring to the light the problem." To
ering said. "This is really the first
hard data that anybody has gathered
on the extent of the housing prob
lem."
The survey will be posted until
tomorrow. The results will be writ
ten up over the weekend and sent to
various administrators. The com
mittee has also asked permission to
present the results at the next Facul
ty Senate meeting.
