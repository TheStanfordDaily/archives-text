## 'THE Demon Spirit' R.A. Salvatore talks about his latest work of fantasy 
### Nitin Chopra Contributing writer 
With the release of his latest book, "The Demon
Spirit" (Del Rey, $25.95), Robert A. Salvatore offers
readers all the three-dimensional characters, vivid battle
scenes and page-turning plot that has established his
work among fantasy lovers.
On the most basic level, the story chronicles the typical
battle between good and evil. The world of Corona has
recently recovered from the awesome destruction of a
powerful Demon, but the land continues to reek with the
awful stench of chaos. Enemy armies, disorganized yet
potent, are regrouping in the North. Elbryan and Pony
— with the experience of many hard-fought battles and
the affection of lovers — must counterattack and ex
punge the evil forces from the land.
Meanwhile, at the church of St. Mere-Abelle, Master
Jojonah must search for the true root of the Demon while
preventing the dubious Father Markwart from advanc
ing his own agenda.
"The Demon Spirit" is a wonderful book of heart-rac
ing fantasy. Anyone familiar with Salvatore's earlier
works should find this one right up his or her alley, levers
of the famous dark elf, Drizzt, should be sure to explore
the vast new world that Salvatore creates.
The book's most striking difference from other fantasy
novels is its depth and scope. It's not just about a couple
of heroes who kick some bad guy's butt. It's about the
church and the ideological split that has managed to
creep through its walls. It's about the nature of evil and
the two "truths" to every story. Politics, religion and
honor also enter the fray.
However, there are a few disconcerting things about
"The Demon Spirit." At times, the important issues of the
book seem a bit too dramatic. After all, this is supposed
to be a fantasy book, not Plato's "Republic. And then
there's the romantic interest between the two main char
acters — something that readers aren't used to seeing in
Salvatore's work.
Intermission recently spoke with Salvatore about his
thoughts on "The Demon Spirit." By the end of the inter

view it became evident that he's a
regular family man with a great
sense of humor and an amazing
mind for writing fantasy.
Intermission: You began
writing after reading J.R.R.
Tolkien's "The Hobbit." When
you finished the book, did you
say, "This is what I want to do
with my life," or was it more
gradual than that?
Robert Salvatore: No, it was
a lot more gradual than that. I
used to read a lot when 1 was lit
tle, like first or second grade.
Mostly "Peanuts," Charles
Schultz stuff — Snoopy and
Charlie Brown were the guys.
After that, I don't know what
happened, but 1 think school
beat the reading out of me. 1 re
ally stopped reading and actually
entered college as a math major.
During my freshman year, my
sister gave me the "Lord of the
Rings" series, and I read them
during a snowstorm that had
canceled school for a week.

Those books showed me that I
eould actually read books that I would love. I changed
my major to communication — tech writing. I gradu
ated college in 1981 and about that time I was out of
fantasy books to read. Out of frustration I said, "I'm
just going to write my own." So I did. I sat down on the
edge of the bed with a spiral notebook and a pen, by
candlelight, with
Fleetwood Mac's "Tusk"

album playing in the
background. I spent six
months writing my first
book, "Echoes of the
Fourth Magic."
I: Is "The Demon
Spirit" going to be a part
of a trilogy?
R.S.: Yes, it's going to be
a trilogy, but then I'm go

'The hero Is not the guy with the
biggest sword, but the one wtth
the biggest Ideals. That's what I
love about fantasy.'

ing to write another three books based on the world.
I'm going to keep coming back to this world. This is
my last fantasy world, my home, my "Shannara." I love
this place.
I: Sneaking of "this place," when you sit down to
write a series in a new world, how do you begin? Do
you paint a mental picture of the whole world and all
its intricacies, or is it a little less formal than that?
R.S.: This one was different. Del Rey said they
wanted me to take as long as I needed to write the best
book I could write. If you look at the number of books
I have out, you can see I was writing two or three books
a year. But with this series, I spent six months working
on the world — working out the magic system, the po
litical structure, the social structure and particularly
the religious structure — before I even started writing
the book. And this place looks so real to me.
I: I read that you are interested in doing some more
social commentary with your writing. Are we going to
see this in the trilogy?
R.S.: With this world, it's my world. I know the
place. I know what's going on, and I know what's going
on among the leaders in the different kingdoms. So

yeah, there's going to be a lot of social commentary.
Once when my friends got together to play a game for
the night, instead of playing the game we had a theo
logical argument as to which side was right — that's
been one of the joys of this trilogy. In these books I'm
really going to do a lot of social commentary — not to
point fingers, but just to take a look at what happens
when one gains power. I consider these books much
more mature than my other works.
I: How else is "The Demon Spirit" different from
your other books?
R.S.: It's bigger. Most of my books have either been
personal tales or other small-scale works. This whole
trilogy is so much bigger in scope and importance. It's
not just a story of three protagonists, but it's a story of
the schism that has come to the Abellican Church and
the way everyone around it is going to deal with it. It's
also the story of the Demon. Is the Demon a physical
manifestation who brings about evil, or is the Demon
the result of the evil that is in mankind? That's what
this series is about.
I: There is an unusually strong romantic element in
"The Demon Spirit" between Elbryan and Pony. Why
the romance as opposed to just two friends?
R.S.: I've stayed away from the romantic element for
a long time because I know that younger people are
reading my work. But when I look at what's on televi
sion at 8 o'clock at night, I realize I can push that
boundary a little more than I have been. I'm trying to
write about real people here — real people have ro
mantic interests. That's the way the world is. Now, just
like I try to stay away from gratuitous violence, I'm cer
tainly going to stay away from gratuitous sex. Also, I'm
trying to put a moral element to it. Elbryan and Pony
are married, and there's a moral element to that. That's
what I love about fantasy — the hero is not the guy

with the biggest sword,
but the one with the
biggest ideals. He sticks to
those ideals, even when
things get tough. In fan
tasy, heroes are rewarded
for making the right
choices, and they're pun
ished for making the
wrong ones. And I think
that's true in the romantic

department, too. It just
gives me one more thing that I can explore to make
these people more real.
I: Recently there have been some movies based on
video games like "Street Fighter" and "Mortal
Kombat." Do you ever see any of your epics as a movie?
R.S.: Yeah, I always do. If I got a call from Steven
Spielberg or lames Cameron, I wouldn't say no. The
thought scares and intrigues me at the same time. With
movies you reach so many more people. You can have
much more fun with it. I think the "Dark Elf" books
would make wonderful movies, and the "Icewind
Dale" trilogy, too. These books would be tough to do
because they're big, but if someone did it right, it
would be wonderful. You have to be careful, though. A
lot of these movies, like "Mortal Kombat," are based on
two-dimensional fighting machines. That's not what
movies are supposed to be like; movies have to tell a
story. I think what has been lacking in fantasy movies,
with a few notable exceptions like "The Princess
Bride," is the ability to tell a story within the context of
the special effects. It makes me crazy when the solution
is a trick or a gimmick that makes no logical sense at
all. You don't get away with that in a book.
