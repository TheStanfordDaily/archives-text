## Ska: Taking on the Airwaves 
### 
From the white sandy beaches of the Caribbean to the cold streets of London to the nightlife of New York, ska
has been influenced from all walks of music. Ska is best described a reggae sound with a faster beat. There are also
jazz and punk influences. Horns are the crucial instruments in a ska band, but a good drummer, bassist and gui
tarist are also important elements. Most of the lyrics are about everyday things, ranging from women to jobs to pop
icons, like William Shatner. Ska definitely is for fans of many types of music, from Bob Marley and the Sex Pistols
to the likes of Miles Davis.
The first wave of ska came from the reggae scene of Jamaica as a new musical genre in the late '60s. It com
bined a reggae beat with jazz — complete with horns, guitars and drums. Ska then made its way to the London
musical scene, transforming into a second wave in the early '70s and '80s. Innovative bands like The Specials made
ska a staple in the London underground scene. A ska listener, also known as a "rude boy," was easily identifiable
by his style of dress: a black suit, white shirt and black tie.
In the mid-'Bos, ska went third wave. Bands from New York and the East Coast adapted the London sound with a
punk style. Groups such as The Scofflaws, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and The Skatelites spawned a whole new era.
The third wave burst onto the New York musical scene and gradually moved across the nation without going fully main
stream. These groups influenced Midwest bands like Mustard Plug, MU33O and others. Ska began to gain popularity
throughout the nation, as evidenced by the sound of Southern California bands like No Doubt and Reel Big Fish.
In the early '90s ska was on the move again. With the fourth wave, bands began to move away from the jazzy
horns and began using the punk variation that has come to define the ska on the radio.
Despite ska's growth and change it continues to gain popularity and acceptance on the music scene. The air
waves have become filled with horns and beat that can only be the result of the influence of ska.
