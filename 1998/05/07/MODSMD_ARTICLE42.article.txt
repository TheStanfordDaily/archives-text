# Modem Classic rock?
## Still Working Through the Paradox 
### 
There's a resurrection of classic rock going on — literally. Based on the blues, classic rock combines groove-edged bass
and drums, lightening electric guitar riffs, acoustic rhythm guitar and harmonized vocals into an amazing live experience.
[he same isn't always true of classic rock albums cut in the studio. Wiihin the last five years, both The Beatles
and The Doors have released new music featuring their lead singers (John Lennon and Jim Morrison respectively),
who have both been dead for over 15 years.
The combination of original vocals from old studio sessions and newly recorded instrumental tracks has met
with acclaim and disdain. Fanatics praise the additions to the compendious legacy of music from both bands, while
purists attack the efforts, calling them cash-cow tactics violating the sanctity of the bands' previous recordings.
The industry doesn't seem to care for the new releases, either. Most classic rock radio has stuck to old favorites and
quickly dropped the novelty items after a brief period of light rotation — the same response stations had to the recent glut
of comeback tours and albums by aging classic rockers like The Who, Plant and Page, The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac.
But consumers don't seem to care that — to the bands — these comebacks are more about making money than
making interesting music. Witness the inflated tour ticket prices people gladly swallow up
There are bands like The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Crosby Stills and Nash, whose current incarnation is
respected because their workhorse consistency has meant an album and a tour every four to seven years for over
30 years. Which is why those bands can charge $75 ticket prices
