# Hip hop
## Taking on the Airwaves 
### 
If you wanna talk about hip hop, you
gotta understand the underground.
That's where it started and that's where
its heart is. Although we've gotten to a
point where hip hop's infiltrated the
airwaves, the power of the words and
sounds are being produced by folks
most have never heard of.
Since the very beginning, in the
late 70s, when DJ Kool Here was
throwing park jams in the South
Bronx, hip-hop has been infused with
an independent spirit. Fed up with
major label bullshit and the way me
dia misinterpreted what hip-hop was
all about, a few artists struck out on
their own, creating record labels in an
effort to establish creative control and
to ensure that the cash they earn
ended up in their pockets.
If you wanna check the innovators
on the do-it-yourself tip, hook your
self up with a Mystik Journeymen
tape. Its track "Black Sands" can be
heard on the recent Industry Records
compilation, "Beats and Lyrics,"
along with a posse cut, "Nowyouno,"
by their crew, Living Legends. The
compilation also features work by
Xzibit and the Pharcyde. Check out
the group's Web page:
www.mystk Journeymen, com.
Another indie group using the
Web are the kids from Hieroglyphics
— del the lunkee homosapien, Souls
of Mischief, Casual and the Prose.
Fed up of being jerked by the majors,
the collective regrouped and started
selling tapes over the Internet and
promoting its shows around the
country. It produced an album, "Third
Eye Vision," which it released in
March on its own Hieroglyphics
Imperium label. Swing by the group's
Web page: www.hieroglyphics.com.
In Los Angeles, the underground
scene is held down by the Project
Blowed crew. Check out Aceyalone's

new album, "The Book of Human
Language," and Abstract Rude's
"Underground Fossils." These two
also represent with Acey's fellow
Freestyle Fellowship crew member
Mikah 9, backed by a jazz quintet, as
Haiku D'Etat. The group's live and
recorded music have folks hoping lor
a full-length project soon.
The collective and avant-garde
artistic atmosphere in Seattle has
been fertile ground for hip-hop, as
evidenced by the compilations self
released by Jasiri Media Group
("Word*Sound* Power") and Tribal
Music, Inc. ("Do the Math"). Pick up
these albums to get your know on,
and keep an ear open for Source of
Labor and Ghetto Children, two of the
dopest bands on the planet.
In New York things are kept live by
Rawkus Records. The label emerged
with the release of Company Flow's de
but, "Funcrusher Plus," along with a
slew of 12-inches by folks like Mos Def
and Sir Menelik. Check for "Black Star,"
by Mos Def (the MC-of-the-moment)
and Talib Kweli (of Reflection Eternal)
and the first volume of the lyricist
Lounge" series, a two-disc compilation
of freestyles. Also look out for DJ
Stretch Armstrong's indie, Fondle 'Em
records, which plans to release the solo
LP from MF Doom, the artist formerly
known as Zev Love X, from KMD.
For those of you itching for some
well-known stuff, Wu-Tang should be
coming out with some nice work
soon. Method Man's "T2" should
blow up the summer, as should
Brooklyn's mighty mighty Boot Camp
Clique. Check for the Cocoa Brovaz's
"The Rude Awakening" and Heltah
Skeltah's "Magnum Force." as well
The two top spots in my rota
tion are held by Gangstarr's magnum
opus "The Moment of Truth"and
Goodie Mob's sophomore joint "Still
Standing" — definitely two of the
tightest albums in recent memory. On
that tip, keep an eye out for A Tribe
Called Quest's next album, "The Love
Movement," (which, rumor has it,
harkens back to the classic sound of
"The Low End Theory") to be dropped
early in the summer.
