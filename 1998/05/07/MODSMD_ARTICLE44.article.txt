# Radio Pop:
## Cheap, Fast, Easy 
### 
Good pop is not a crime. America's suspicion of pop is surely an attempt to make bands like Pearl Jam or
Smashing Pumpkins (decidedly NOT pop) seem unnecessarily deep
Aquas "Barbie Girl," one of the best pop songs of the year, gets derided for being fun, witty and self-consciously
shallow, while bands like Soundgarden are supposed to be brooding instigators of musical revolution just for dis
torting their guitars and swapping the words "Barbie Girl" with "Black Hole Sun."
So far, 1998 has been a bad year for good radio pop. Good pop, made by one-hit wonders who pour everything they
have into three minutes of musical fame, is unnamable. Oftentimes, it's made by bands who disappear, only to reappear
20 years later on a greatest hits compilation. You know a truly good pop song when you'll take the long way home, or
pause half a minute before you turn the car engine off, just so you can sing along to another meaningless last chorus
Few recent songs fit that bill. Oasis' new album lacked instant sing-a-long wonders. No Doubt, Better Than Ezra.
Matchbox 10, Sublime and Third Eye Blind have attitude, sincerity, some bounce, but little more. Their songs tire quickly
They are cheerful but the groups take themselves too seriously — like Tom Jones singing Ezra Pound poems with
a frown on his face, or a film with an artsy title that has Keanu Reeves starring in every role. In short, they're ridicu
lous and facile without having the courage to own up to it.
Admittedly, the Verve has put out two excellent pop songs, Dimitri from Paris threatens to bring some chintzy
humor to the airwaves, and Hanson released the ultimate in sophisticated sugary nonsense with "MMMBop" But
these are exceptions to the rule.
Last year we heard some of the finest pop songs of the decade. Space's "The Female of the Species," OMD's "How
Bizarre," "Lovefool," "Going the Distance" and "6 Underground" all had the qualities of truly classic pop. Beck pro
vided catchy and lovable songs. White Town's "Your Woman" had the best sample and the most idiotic lyrics.
The Chemical Brothers and Prodigy provided an electronic alternative to the stagnant waters of "alternative," ex
emplified by Pearl Jam's "Betterman" and Hootie and the Blowfish.
Even Alanis Morrisette had her pop moment when she redefined the word "ironic" to mean things it had never
previously referred to.
None of this has been evident in the pop music in the first half of 1998 It seems that radio stations have
stopped taking risks. Ska offers some hope of novelty, but certainly not in the form of No Doubt Perhaps as El Nino
passes and the clouds dissolve into sunshine, the radio will remove its serious mask and give us back some hint of
last year's laughably good tracks.
