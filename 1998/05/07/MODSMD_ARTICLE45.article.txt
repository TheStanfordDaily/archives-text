# Grassroots Rock
## Woody, Reedy, Indie

It started with the indie record label movement ot the 1980s, when bands began to cut their own albums and
distribute them via the labels.
The idea quickly spread trom the punk and indie scene to the neo-hippie grassroots jam / funk community,
whose sound features noodling guitar solos, ride-the-wah rhythms, upstroke drum beats and cerebral bass lines
The crown prince of the genre is the psychedeliciously-laced Phish. Started in 1984, the band has toured Europe mul
tiple times and sold out a three-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the final night of which was Ne*
Year's Eve.
Several other similar working-class bands (i.e., SlO-S2O a tickets) hail from the Northeast Ominous Seapods.
moe., Percy Hill and a few others tour the country playing everywhere from oversized bars to genuine concert halls
New York City has its own prodigious output, in the form of Blues Traveler and Spin Doctors (ugh), both of
whom add a heavy dose of pop to their sound.
Another breeding ground for grassroots jam bands is the Colorado high country Leftover Salmon, a self-de
scribed "polyethnic cajun slamgrass" band (read rock, blues, bluegrass and zydeco) from Boulder, Colo includes
both a banjo player and a mandolin/fiddler/guitarist in its lineup, while String Cheese Incident, from Crested
Butte, Colo trades the banjo for a keyboard
A set of bands from the South has also achieved high visibility Widespread Panic, The Funky Meters and
Galactic blend Southern rock and a funky strut into a infectious combination
Most of these bands won't be heard on commercial radio, but they have a significant presence on non-comm
and college stations.
