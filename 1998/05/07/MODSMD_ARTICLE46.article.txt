## Jimmy Page & Robert Plant: 'Walking Into Clarksdale' 
### 
In Rolling Stone's review of "Walking Into Clarksdale," Robert Christgau wrote that "Page is in
excellent form, effortlessly summoning the spirits of light and dark that his extraordinary play
ing has always sought to embody ... Strings provide a strange, celestial elegance to crashing
rhythms and unsettling time signatures. Folk-rock melodies deliver warmth and humanity to
arrangements that might otherwise be daunting in their architectural scale."
Warmth and humanity?
Uncontrollable morphing dominates "Walking Into Clarksdale" just as horrible as Christgau's re
view. Gentle acoustic picking, Arabic-flavored modal electric guitar leads, sustained electric rhythm
guitar chords, rumbling bass lines and downbeat heavy drums fly in and out gracelessly, stumbling
against each other like an oversized litter of pigs rushing to a limited number of teats.
The problem is that every element gets tossed into every song. If it made the album wind up
sounding more like a "concept" album, that might be great. Unfortunately, all it does is homogenize
interesting sounds into a banal set of wannabe Zeppelin tunes.
The biggest pig of the lot is Robert Plant. Anyone hoping for classic Plant upper-octave wailings
won't be shortchanged. That is, if you can stand an overdose of pseudo-mystical warblings.
"Walking Into Clarksdale" is a disaster of repetition. Song titles almost uniformly derive from
endlessly repeated choruses. Only a few of the 12 tracks — including"Shining In The Light," "Most
High" and the title song — stand out as thoughtful and unique.
Zep fans, beware; this barely counts as Led Zeppelin Lite. Sure, Page spikes the dials with some
blazing riffs, and the disturbing avalanche called the rhythm section thunders often and ominously.
But there's nothing here that wasn't done much better over 20 years ago.
It's safe to say that Page and Plant will never be our overlords. Better that you spend your hard
earned money on the recently released Led Zeppelin double-disc "BBC Sessions," which features live
and studio tracks from 1968 through 1971.
I'll bet the 1971 Page and Plant would'vebeen ashamed to know they'd ever release "Walking Into
Clarksdale."
