# Goodie Mob:
## 'Still Standing' 
### 
Goodie Mob is back with its second album
"Still Standing." In the new album, the
group drops knowledge and talks about the
'Good dying mostly over bullshit.'
These Atlanta boys have that special style of
singing, talking quickly and rapping that almost
resembles Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Once you de
cipher their rat-a-tat words, their lyrics actually
make you think. Knowledge with beats.
No subject is too paltry for the Mob to discuss.
It dedicates a whole song to talking about the way
people only posture and pose instead of dancing
with each other on its already released hit "They
don't dance no mo'."
Mostly, the group's raps expose contradictions.
It talks about the defacement and destruction of
neighborhoods, and the relationship of gender

roles to money and tradition. On "The
Experience," Goodie Mob delves into the different
meanings of the nigger / nigga.
The band dedicates a whole song to black
women and to women in general, explaining that
men are not the only ones who disrespect women.
They claim that some women disrespect them
selves or allow themselves to be disrespected.
On "Beautiful Skin," Goodie says, "You're my
beginning / My end / You're my / Sister, lover and
friend / What they say 'bout you ain't true /
There's no me /If there is no you /1 hope that you
understand / You got to respect yourself before I
can."
That's what I'm talking about.
