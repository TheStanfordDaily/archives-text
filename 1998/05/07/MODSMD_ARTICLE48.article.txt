# Anton Schwartz:
## When Music Calls' 
### 
Anton Schwartz's debut album "When Music Calls" is excit
ing and revolutionary precisely because it sounds so old.
Unlike much of modern jazz, which is textured by synthe
sizers, electric guitars and over-production, "When Music Calls"
is all about classic jazz. That means good compositions, good mu
sicians and good improvisation.
The album consists mainly of original compositions, which is
very strange for a first jazz album. However, Schwartz has the tal
ent to pull it off, and his pieces don't suffer too much when jux
taposed with the two covers, "Where or When" by Rodgers and
Hart and "Paradoxy" by Sonny Rollins. "Too Much Pepper" has a
feisty swing and a strong John Coltrane feel, "Poketown" has a laid
back groove, and "When Music Calls" is just lovely.
Moreover, Schwartz is not half bad on saxophone. He wears his
influences on his sleeve, particularly Coltrane ("Tidepool" sounds
like "Absolution" in the Caribbean), but doesn't sound derivative.
The band swings, but occasionally the intensity runs a little low or
an improvisation goes on a little long.
"When Music Calls" is a very promising debut, and hopefully
we'll hear more from Schwartz in the future.
