# Ben Neill:
## 'Goldbug' 
### 
Once upon a time there was a techno revolution and every
one thought that he or she could do it well. And everyone
was wrong. Ben Neill seems to have a lot of ideas about
how to make techno music. Unfortunately, most of them do not
work in "Goldbug."
He mixes horrible electronic noises with half-hearted beats.
Perhaps he intended this to be jazzy techno, but it just sounds like
bad techno with bad instrumental. Every once in a while Neill
adds women's vocals, probably because he hopes to make this
danceable music, but his good intentions pave the road to hell.
The vocals end up sounding like computer-generated tone deaf
voices.
Every once in a while, I thought I heard the promise of good
techno, and I hoped that he'd hit his stride. But then some funky
sounding trumpet entered and messed it up again. "Goldbug" is
a well-meaning but ill-devised attempt at techno.
