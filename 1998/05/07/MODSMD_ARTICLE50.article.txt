# 'Black Dog' bites
## No redemption for Patrick Swayze 
### 
Even two tall boys of
Budweiser couldn't
delude a person
enough to save "Black Dog"
from a lousy review. So let's
just get the chicken slaugh
ter out of the way now.
The plot is unbelievably
predictable and com
pletely unoriginal. A poor,
noble family man named
Jack Crews (Patrick
Swayze) is forced to do a
"job" in order to save his
family's home from fore
closure. The job entails
driving an 18-wheeler full

of assault rifles from one place to another, avoiding death and de
struction from greedy villains along the way.
Jack is a trucker who could "drive an ice truck through a parade on
the Fourth of luly," as his evil boss Cutler (Graham Beckel) puts it. But
Jack has become a reluctant trucker, having just spent two years in jail
for an accident that occurred when he fell asleep behind the wheel.
The acting is about what you'd expect from a B-movie. The actors

are typecast and the dialogue is pathetic. There is nothing special about the action
shots. There is no artsy film stuff. The best thing about this flick — what distin
guishes it from a 90-minute wannabe "Dukes of Hazard" episode — is that there are
no commercials. For the love of God, do not spend your money on this movie.
Having said that, it's only fair to point out the charming aspects of the flick. First
of all, it is about truckers and trucking. This is an occupation that hasn't been ro
manticized on the big screen for a while. In fact, the title of the movie refers to the
legendary evil animal spirit of exhaustion that appears to truckers who have been
pushing too long and hard.
Second, it's short. At only an hour and a half in length, "Black Dog" lets you out
in time to do other stuff with your night.
Third, it's just so damn bad that it's funny. Toward the end, there was even a lit
tle audience participation going on in my theater. People were laughing at the corny
ending and clapping for the stupid death of the villainous, evangelistic Red (played
by Meatloafl). There was a kind of solidarity between all of us losers who had de
liberately paid $7.50 to see a made-for-TV movie.
Hey, it was fun. But stay far, far away from this movie.
