## 'Les Mis' the movie No songs, but a decent adaptation 
### 
Merde happens. That pretty much sums up
the book, musical and now the film ver
sion of Victor Hugo's "Les Miserables."
Danish director Bille August's ("Smilla's Sense of
Snow") adaptation of "Les Mis" does a pretty good
job of cramming a couple-thousand-page book
into two engaging hours. Fans of the original novel
will be pleased; the movie stays startlingly close to
Hugo's work. Most of us, however, only know "Les
Mis" from the hugely successful Broadway musical.
Its fans will be a lot less pleased.
Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean, a reformed ex
convict who is unjustly treated by The Man, per
sonified by Inspector Javert. The Inspector, per
formed superbly by Geoffrey Rush, is a cold and
fanatically law-abiding policeman who is ob
sessed with hunting down Valjean.
The desperate Valjean assumes a new identity
and begins a prosperous life as the mayor of a small
town. Then Fantine (Uma Thurman), who is fired
from the factory he owns, attracts his attention by
collapsing in front of him. He agrees to raise her
child after she dies. Meanwhile, he must outrun
Javert, who has found him out.
Fast-forward to Paris in the infancy of its 1832
revolution. Famine's daughter Cosette (Claire
Danes) has come of age and fallen in love with

Marius (Hans Matheson), the stereotypical hot-blooded revolutionary. At this point
the movie becomes disappointing.
Valjean and Javert are the only well-developed characters in the film; Cosette
and Marius are severely one-sided. Yet the film downplays the revolution consid
erably and instead focuses on the love story.
Have you musical fans noticed what's missing here? There's no Eponine. Her
character figures prominently in the musical and garners much empathy from that
audience. The movie follows the book, where Eponine is a less central character.
With the exception of Eponine's loss, the subtle changes that August made
were for the better, plucking a comprehensible plot from Hugos giant morass
and weaving it into a good story.
The most disappointing aspect of the film is that it has the power to enthrall but
does not use it nearly enough. "Les Miserables" will hold you, but as my roommate
put it, "I never forgot I was in a theater."
