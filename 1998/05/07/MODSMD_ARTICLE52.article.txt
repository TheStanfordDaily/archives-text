# Building 'Character'
## Now we know why this movie got an Oscar 
### 
Last March, "Character"
won the Oscar for
Best Foreign Language
Film. In doing so, it
demonstrated that this
award is reserved for the
most non-Hollywood film.
"Character," a Dutch movie
by renowned director Mike
van Diem, is the antithesis
of movies like "Jurassic
Park." And it is fantastic.
The movie is dense,
intense and full of sus
pense. Based on the novel
by Ferdinand Bordewijk,
the movie sucks the audi-

ence into the claustrophobic air of an
Amsterdam between the two world wars.
The difference between our lives and the
Dutch life of the '20s made me uncomfort
able and attentive to the movie's dynamics.

"Character" is so foreign to movie-goers — starting with the language — that it
creates a critical distance, enabling the audience to better perceive the beautiful
cinematography and intricate plot.
While being questioned about the murder of the count-bailiff Dreverhaven (Jan
Decleir), the young lawyer Katadreuffe (Fedja Van Huet) goes into an autobio
graphical description of his relationship and experiences with the dead man.
It is soon revealed that Katadreuffe is Dreverhaven's bastard son, the result of
Dreverhaven's forced one-time relationship with Katadreuffe's ever-silent and dis
tant mother Joba (Betty Schuurman). Katadreuffe's cold relationship with his
mother and obsessive competition with his father expose his complex and inter
esting personality. In the end Katadreuffe proves himself a determined and com
petent professional, but there are still things to be resolved about his character.
The movie is really a close study of Katadreuffe's personality. The way the
scenes are made — with a lot of zooms and dim lights — creates an intimacy be
tween him and the audience. We are so trapped into Katadreuffe's life that it feels
like we are analyzing our own characters.
Strangely enough, the movie is not as centered on acting — which is good, but
includes no extraordinary performances — as it is on the visual imagery. The only
flaw in "Character" is that it drags on a little toward the end before it gives the audi
ence the answers to Dreverhaven's death and Katadreuffe's character.
If Cannes is not on your route this summer, but you still want to get a taste of
European film, try "Character." Just remember that it is no lighthearted matter.
