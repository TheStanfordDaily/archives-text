# 'Shooting' the moon
## A 						British romantic comedy clashes with dramatic themes 
### 
£ hooting Fish" wants to be ridiculously
funny, but it winds up just being amusing
and sometimes plainly ridiculous. If you
are into witty romantic comedies or British ac
cents and feel like seeing a movie this weekend,
you will enjoy this one. If you are in a more criti
cal mood, you will appreciate the film's potential

but leave the theater a bit dissatisfied.
The first scene — cleverly written and shot in vibrant primary colors — makes
you want this movie to work. However, 20 minutes into the film, the over-the-top
soundtrack, coupled with some fast-paced sequences, begins to make you wonder
whether the movie was conceptualized by the producers of the "Be young, have
fun, drink Pepsi" commercials.
The story follows the adventures of Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart
Townsend), a pair of young swindlers who scam the rich in order to buy a man
sion for a couple of orphans. The catch lies in the fact that the orphans are Jez and
Dylan themselves.
Futterman — last seen playing Robin Williams' son in"The Birdcage" — and
Townsend are perfectly cast as the smooth-talker with no brains and the brainy no
talker, respectively. Townsend's performance is particularly noteworthy for its bal
anced blend of nerdiness and charm. Kate Beckinsale, playing the swindlers' charm
ing love interest Georgie, illuminates the screen and completes the triangle of
chemistry needed to make the movie work.
What does not end up working completely is the cartoonish quality of the film.
Accentuated by the bright cinematography and the snappy editing is the notion that
this movie should be outrageous and hilarious. Like Wylie Coyote and the
Roadrunner, the main characters move from one scam to the next, big and small, non
stop. The problem is that the scams become convoluted and can be somewhat stupid.

The sappy romantic and
philanthropic themes that try
to prevent the movie from be
coming a 90-minute Spice
Girls music video actually bog
it down. They contradict
rather than complement its
overall mood and euphoric fi
nale. Nonetheless, this movie is
funny and definitely as worth
while as all the predictable
Hollywood films that are
showing in the theaters now.
