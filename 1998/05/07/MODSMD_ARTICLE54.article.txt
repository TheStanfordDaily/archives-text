27-word fiction

Hello, lovers of 27-word fiction!
As usual, this week we have some prose about roommates. Keep this stuff
coming, folks. This is your personal forum for trashing your present and for
mer roommates. If you loved them to death, see if you can compress those joy
ful experiences into 27 words, too. Maybe you don't like the way he or she
smells; write about it! Maybe you fantasize about hanging them from twine
while tickling their underarms and gradually burning their feces — well, you
get the picture.

We made a couple of mistakes last week: Ilias' poem had nothing to do with
"B.R " and Michael Baer wrote the haikus last week, not Anonymous.
Keep in mind that this is officially National 27-word Fiction Month. That
means you have to write at least one work of 27-word fiction a day. There are
no exceptions, especially if you major in English or public policy. So now that
you're forced to write 'em, you might as well send 'em to Intermission.
Happy writing and reading!
