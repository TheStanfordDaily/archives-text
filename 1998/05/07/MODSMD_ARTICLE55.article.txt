## How to Really be Anal 
### Mae West Coltrane 
Anal sex isn't just for men
anymore. According to sites like
www.fishnetmag.com, women
can also enjoy it. This can be
done with the aid of a strap-on
and an open mind. Anal sex is a
form of intimacy that most
know nothing about. So, in the
interest of increasing knowl
edge, let's plumb some depths.
Like any other sexual act, the
most important part of anal sex
is the consent of both people in
volved. Sneaking up on a part
ner who has said he or she'd be
willing to do it is wrong. While
consent may be there, pain is
very possible. First-time anal
sex needs to be slow.
Before you begin, have
some stuff handy:
1) An anal condom.
Vaginal and penile con
doms are not good enough.
They tear. While pregnancy is
n't an issue, AIDS, herpes, gen
ital warts and any number of
other STDs are very real dan
gers that need to be avoided.
2) Water-based lube.
Unlike the vagina and the
mouth, the anus does not lu
bricate naturally. So it's very
easy to cause painful tears dur
ing lovemaking.
3) Extra condoms.
The anus is full of bacteria.
The vagina cannot deal with
anal bacteria. If you move from
the anus to the vagina or
mouth, you must take off the
anal condom and put on a
vaginal pouch or normal latex
condom. Otherwise, you risk
getting your partner very ill.
4) A willingness to stop.
'Nough said.
5) If you plan to use toys,
make sure that your anal toy is
flared at the end so that you
can't lose it, and that the com
pletely clean toy has no sharp
edges. Toys need anal condoms,
too. This is a hard and fast rule.
Just as a penis or toy in a
vagina comes out slathered in
vaginal fluid, anything stuck in
a rectum will come out covered
in shit. Before having anal sex,
spare yourself some embarrass
ment by flushing your rectum
with water. Not too much! The
warm water should come out
clear when you're done. Some
people use the vaginal douches
that you can buy in drugstores,
making sure to empty the bulb
of the perfumes that come with
the product. Perfumes and
asses don't mix. So don't mix
them. Don't hurt yourself. It
helps to do an enema regularly
until it's easv. Then you can

wash and go when you need to.
According to www.sexdoc
.com, it's important to be kind
to your butt. Any time you as
sault it by trying to put some
thing into it the wrong way,
your sphincter muscles will
clench. This is natural. Contract
any muscle long enough and
you will build up enough lactic
acid to have a charley horse. It's
annoying when you have one in
your leg. Imagine having one in
your bottom!
Now that you have your
clean tools and your behind is
spic and span, let's begin some
ass play. First, apply the lube.
You or your partner can do it. If
it's the first time, it might be
best for the recipient to slather
it in. Make sure to liberally
slather some lube on your pe
nis, finger or anal toy.
Have your partner relax his
or her anus muscles and push
out. Sometimes it helps to lay
on your side. DO NOT ENTER
HIM OR HER FROM THE
START. Stay still and have your
partner slowly push the anus
over a finger, then over a small
anal toy until the anus is dilated
to the correct width. Be sure to
take time to relax as necessary.
Then, he or she will let you
know when anal sex with your
toy or penis is possible. DO
NOT THRUST. The receiving
partner must be completely in
charge of the initial penetration.
There are two muscles that
make up what we know as the
"sphincter." They function in
dependently. The outer one is
the one you can control. The
inner one is out of your con
trol. You just have to let your
muscles get comfy.
Now, how does it feel?
There are many different opin
ions. For men on the receiving
end, stimulation of the prostate
gland can be very nice. Somc
men (and even some women!)
can have an orgasm from anal
sex alone. However, it's very
rare that a receiving end part
ner will have an orgasm that
way. Some genital manipula
tion is usually key. But hey, you
might be lucky.
Ultimately, the most im
portant thing to remember is
that physical injury from anal
stimulation will never result if
both partners refuse to toler
ate pain, never use force and
avoid drug use.
