and its others we and they. north and south." said
Elisabeth Mudimbe-Boyi. conference organizer and
professor of French and Italian and Comparative Lit
erature.
"After a decade ol thinking in terms of opposi
tions. and because of the increasing globalization, it is
necessary to move away from binaries, which do not
translate concrete situations." she explained.
Panelists' papers will also deal with consequences
ot intercultural encounters andthe consequences in
terms of formulating identities and self-ascriptions,
creatine Uxral histories and narratives. Mudimbe-
Boyi said.
To emphasize the global orien
tation of the conference, panels
will not be organized around sepa
rate geographic regions.
Discussion topics will vary from
examining the situation of Africans
in Germany to how people such as
Chinese-Americans articulate

their self-identities.
The conference does not aim to
prescribe policy or reach certain
conclusions.
"In their presentations, speak
ers would like to keep the debate
going, to present new ideas and
reconceptualization for contexts
and situations are not as clear-cut,
as prepresented by dichotomies,"
Mudimbe-Boyi said.
The conference's intercultural
and comparative perspective cre

ates a unique opportunity for stu
dents to hear views of speakers
who study several geographic
areas, she added.
"This is an opportunity for the
Stanford community to see how so
cial sciences are thinking about cul
tural and national identity in light
of work that is currently being
done across the globe," added doc
toral student and conference orga
nizer KenricTsethlikai.
Tsethlikai also stressed that the

conference will provide students
with an international perspective
on the aformentioned issues.
"A lot of times in universities we
are confined to the American per
spective," Tsethlikai said.
The conference is sponsored by
several departments in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, as well
as by the Office of the Dean of Stu
dents. All conference panels will be
held in Room 113 of Pigott Hall
