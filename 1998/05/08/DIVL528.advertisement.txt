THE NEW MAP OF MEN'S LIVES
"Understanding Men's Passages"
by Gail Sheehy
Published by Random House
Understanding Men's Passages by Gail Sheehy, author of the
bestselling New Passages and The Silent Passage, is an intimate and
candid account of what men's lives are really like today, revealing
their doubts, their passions and their hunger for renewal. Sheehy
conducted hundreds of interviews with men in middle life who
shared with her their personal stories. By listening carefully to their
own words, she makes the case that it is men in middle life who have
the best chance to become masters of their fates. Featured are
confidences from both celebrities and everyday heroes, creating a
mirror in which every man can locate his possibilities for growth and
change. These bold, feisty, imaginative men recount how they have
discovered what is missing and forged new directions to invigorate
the second half of their lives.
