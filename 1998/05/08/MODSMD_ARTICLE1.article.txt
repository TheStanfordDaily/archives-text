# Terra fights for murals
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
The community spirit of Stan
ford's cooperative houses are in
spired, in part, by the ways each
house has been painted, decorated
and adapted by its residents. Students
of Terra are fighting to retain their
murals and the right to paint their
walls after this summer's Capital Im
provement Plan renovations.
"One of the things that is really
special about the co-ops is that they
emphasize the individual," said for
mer Terra Kitchen Manager Thomas
Willeke, a coterminal student. "The
murals are one way that the house
can be given personality."
Once a house goes through CIP
renovation, University rules permit
no student painting. This regulation
was put into place to prote:ct the fi
nancial investment that is made in
each house when the process occurs,
according to Diana Conkli n, manag
er for undergraduate resident facili
ties in Housing and Dining Services.
"The most important thing is that
the renovations are an opportunity to
give the house a fresh start for people
who will live there in the future,"
Conklin said. "But we have to figure
out how to keep the comm unity that's
there preserved as well."
Residents of Terra and represen
tatives from other co-ops have met
with administrators from the Office
of Residential Education and Hous
ing and Dining to present their posi
tion as to why murals an; integral to

co-op living. The two sides are look
ing to find a compromise that will
allow the house to be preserved and
accommodate administrative needs.
At present. Terra residents are
drafting a proposal explaining why
preserving the murals is important
and what compromises they see are
possible to integrate the interests of
the University and the house. One of
the most important issues from an ad
ministrative standpoint is that each
residential facility is used throughout
the summer to house boarders. Both
adults and youth programs pay the
University to use the facilities. Close
to 20,(XX) people will live on campus
this summer, Conklin said.
The houses are more desirable for
high-paying adult groups when un
painted and recently refurbished.
"We have to have residences that
accommodate the needs of students
and the groups of people who stay on

campus for the summer," Conklin
said.
Willeke said residents of Terra
will suggest in the proposal that the
University place youth groups, which
are generally less discriminating in
their impressions of summer facili
ties, in Terra over the summer. They
will also suggest that the members of
the house take complete responsibili
ty for dealing with issues of post-sum
mer vandalism to the murals and stu
dent requests for repainting. Terra
residents are also presenting emo
tional appeals for the preservation of
the murals and the right to paint their
walls. They emphasize that unlike
other co-ops, which are motivated by
political agendas or have unique
spaces, the murals distinguish Terra.
They also mention the changes
that have occurred in the community
of Kairos since its murals were re
moved in the CIP two years ago. Stu

dents are afraid Terra "won't feel like
home anymore," according to
Willeke.
"'A co-op isn't the walls — it's the
people," said Lorette Beeson, assis
tant director for student manage
ment in Res Ed. "But the students
feel that the murals are a part of their
house. ... We want to support them
in any way we can."
Further concern is that other
houses will want exemption from the
painting rules if Terra is allowed to re
tain its murals. EBF and Columbae
will be renovated in the upcoming
years. The administration insists that
painting rules in houses must be de
cided on a case-by-case basis.
"The mission statement of Hous
ing and Dining Services says that one
of [its] goals is to keep the houses
more personal and less institutional,"
Willeke said. "We think that the mu
rals reallv do this."
