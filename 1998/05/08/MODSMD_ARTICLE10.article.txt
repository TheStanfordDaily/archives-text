# Unanimous Senate approval for giving taxpayers more rights
## Senate approves extensive IRS reforms 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) â€” Legisla
tion to clean up the Internal Revenue
Service won unanimous Senate approval
last night in an election-year display of
outrage over heavy-handed enforce
ment tactics and other abuses.
The Senate passed the bill on a 97-0
vote as one lawmaker after another
spoke out about a "culture" at the
nation's tax collection agency in desper
ate need of change.
Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del., chief
architect of the measure, said that for
too long, the IRS has treated the taxpay
er "as the enemy and not the customer."
The legislation includes "the most
extensive reforms ever made to balance
power and responsibility inside what can
only be characterized as one of Ameri
ca's most powerful agencies," added the
chairman of the Finance Committee.

"We need to pass IRS reform,"
agreed Senate Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota. "We need to
get on with reforming it, restructuring
the IRS, sensitizing them."
President Clinton applauded the Sen
ate's action, and urged both the House
and Senate to "send me a bill that
expands taxpayer rights and moves us
forward towards delivering an IRS the
American people deserve."
At the same time, administration offi
cials said they would seek some changes
in the bill when lawmakers meet to work
out a final compromise.
No detail seemed too small for law
makers eager to demonstrate their con
cern with the agency that many taxpay
ers fear and despise.
One provision would require the IRS
to publish telephone numbers of its local

offices.
More broadly, the measure would
provide a variety of new rights for tax
payers. including shifting the burden of
proof to the IKS in certain court cases. It
also would provide new protections lor
divorcees, mostly women, who face col
lection actions due to mistakes made b\
former spouses without their knowl
edge.
IRS penalties and interest would be
suspended in some circumstances, and a
new nine-member oversight board
would be given authority over law
enforcement and collections activity ;is
well as personnel.
Not voting on Senate passage were
Democrats Daniel Akaka of Hawaii and
John Glenn of Ohio, as well as South
Carolina Republican Strom Thurmond.
The House passed a similar though

less-sweeping hill last year. But Senate
GOP leaders decided to hold up their
own measure as they held a second set of
well-publicized hearings in the Senate
Finance Committee at which a string of
witnesses described the mistreatment
they had suffered at the hands of the
nation's tax collectors.
Some Democrats and the Clinton
administration initially expressed mis
givings about the bill, with its proposed
oversight board. But the political appeal
of reining in the IRS was so strong they
quickly switched field last year, and Clin
ton used his radio address last weekend
to urge Congress to send him a bill
quickly.
The appeal was evident, as well, in
remarks made by a bipartisan procession
of lawmakers in the hours before the
vote.
