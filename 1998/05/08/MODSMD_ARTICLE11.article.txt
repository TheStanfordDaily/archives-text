### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minis
ter Benjamin Netanyahu resisted heavy
pressure yesterday to hand over territo
ry to the Palestinians and said U.S.-pro
posed talks in Washington next week
may not get under way as planned.
"I don't know if we will get to Wash
ington by Monday because there are a
lot of issues left open," Netanyahu said.
The Israeli leader said during a CNN
World Report forum that he was not
certain his Cabinet could approve a U.S.
proposal for a West Bank troop with
drawal in time for next week's planned
meeting.
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is scheduled
to arrive in Israel today and meet with
Netanyahu for an intensive round of
negotiations. U.S. officials were upbeat,

saying the Ross visit was a positive sign.
Arafat, president of the Palestinian
Authority, warned that failure to move
the peace process forward now would
mean "the whole region of the Middle
East will he in a confused state." He
spoke during the same CNN program.
The U.S. proposal calls for Israel to
make a 13-percent withdrawal from the
West Bank over a 12-week period in
which Palestinians would introduce new
measures to fight terrorism.
"Every single percent counts." said
Netanyahu, noting that each percentile
covered an area larger than the city of
Tel Aviv and was fraught with danger
for Israel's security.
The two leaders also dueled over the
possibility of a Palestinian state, an issue

placed in the limelight by Hillary Rod
ham Clinton, who told a group of Israeli
and Arab teen-agers in Geneva on
Wednesday that she supports an inde
pendent Palestinian entity.
Arafat said that an existing interim
agreement with Israel expires on May 4
1999, and the Palestinians would then
"have the right to declare our indepen
dent state."
But Netanyahu said limits had to be
placed on Palestinian sovereignty,
adding that "unbridled self-determina
tion" would allow Palestinians to import
tanks and artillery that could threaten
Israel.
After inconclusive talks with the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Lon
don this week, the Clinton administra

lion gave Netanyahu six days to accept
the U.S. proposition. Aralat has already
accepted the figure. which is tar less than
the 30-percent withdrawal that Palestini
ans had hoped tor.
However. Netanyahu spokesman
Shai Bazak told I he Associated Press
the I S. proposal was not yet slated lor
debate by Israel's 17-member Cabinet al
its regular meeting Sunday.
And another official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that
"chances are slim" thai Netanyahu
would be ready with an agreed-upon
plan by Monday.
President Clinton has proposed that
Monday's summit open talks on the
future of Jerusalem. Jewish settlements,
refugees and borders.
