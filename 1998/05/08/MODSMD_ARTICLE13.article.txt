## Editorial An informed Draw 
### 
An improved ASSU Draw
guide can help students
make an informed choice

THE RECENTLY established
ASSI' Web-based Draw guide
is a much needed step toward
making the Draw process more conve
nient and understandable. It does,
however, have areas that can be
improved.
The Draw guide provides valuable
information about the different houses
on campus, such as room configura
tions, house sizse and board options.
The site is also easy to navigate and
provides convenient access to the
Housing and Dining Services Web site.
Furthermore, by soliciting current
residents' opinions about their houses
through a survey, the guide offers per
sonal perspectives that most students
value highly in their decisions of where
to Draw.
A good number of houses, however,
have little or no information listed.
Many do not even appear on the list of
dormitories — i.e., most of the Row
houses, a number of houses in Flo
rence Moore Hall and the majority of
the Wilbur Hall houses. In addition,
the information provided about hous
es is inconsistent; some sites describe a

house's features in detail while others
provide only minimal information.
The Draw guide could be improved
in a number of ways, especially by
working more closely with Residential
Education. First, coordinating with the
Office and obtaining information
through the Res Ed survey would
make the process of gathering infor
mation more efficient.
Second, resident assistants may be
of help in boosting survey return rates
'Hie student survey is one of the most
valuable features of the Draw guide
and is unavailable in other sources.
But it is difficult to get a large number
of students to fill out surveys, as was
evidenced this year by the lack of resi
dent opinion offered for a number of
houses. RAs could improve the survey
return rates by encouraging students
to fill out the survey during house
meetings or other dorm / house events.
Furthermore, the surveys would
fare better if they did not coincide with
the annual Res Ed surveys, which
already have enough trouble soliciting
adequate student feedback.
Considering how complicated the
current Draw process is due to the
numerous changes made this year, the
ASSU has provided a valuable guide
to help students understand the system
and decide where to Draw. But as with
most pilot programs, there is much
room for improvement.
