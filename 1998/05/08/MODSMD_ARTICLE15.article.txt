## Dissed by the Draw, yet again 
### 
ALAS, almighty
Draw, you have
gnashed your
sharpened teeth once
again on my poor Draw
group known to your cold
computer interface as
"6dodes." Perhaps this
year was less painful for

you as your talons fit nicely into the gaping
holes you tore into me in years past. But
resting in your unloving grasp, I smell the
likes of Casa Zapata or, possibly, Soto on
your rotten breath.
Have you no shame or dignity? Or even
a simple notion of the law of averages?
Freshman year 1 had no idea of the evil you
possessed. The number 1969 changed that
quickly. Burned by your fire, my Draw
group attempted to appease you by imme
diately offering you another one of our pre
ferred years as a sophomore.
But again you spit that out like a piece
of hair in a Wilbur quesadilla, and handed
us 1681. An improvement — however, it
only opened about one more door on the
Stanford campus than our previous num
ber. This year we just grabbed our ankles
and said do your worst. And you did —
2855.
I mean, the choices we have to put on
our Draw list are overwhelming. 1 was cal
culating some figures on my convenient
Draw list worksheet compliments of Hous
ing Assignment Services, and came up with

the following list: Choice 1: Any coed dor
mitory. Choice 2: House closet in Granada.
1 honestly drew a blank at choice 3. Actual
ly I am considering putting Bob first just to
say up yours to an inane system.
Would I feel differently had I been one
of the chosen few to tickle the Draw's soft
underbelly in such a way to earn at least
one decent Draw number? Probably. How
ever, I maintain that it is up to the people
who get screwed to make a system better.
There are two key changes that need to
be made to the Draw before it can be treat
ed as a fair system.
The first is to establish a three-tier pref
erence system that guarantees Drawing 1-
1,000 for at least one year. The most obvi
ous way of doing this is organizing the
Draw by seniority.
An argument against this would be from
the people who go overseas during their
junior year and who will somehow lose out
on their medium year of housing.
However, the places they will live when
they get back will most likely have been
filled by juniors who have left for their
overseas quarters and therefore will still be
part of the medium range of housing.
Mixed-class Draw groups would still be
allowed. However, they would have to
agree on Drawing within the youngest class
of the group.
The second change that needs to be
made is real-time choosing of housing and
not these cockamamie Draw lists. If it is

possible to sell assigned seats to Gaieties,
then it is possible to let people pick their
housing once they see what is available.
Granted, it would take longer than run
ning the computer program they have now,
but it would be much less time than it takes
to process split Draw group petitions. The
satisfaction in choosing the best housing
available would immediately outweigh the
time issue.
However, I do not expect these changes
any time soon. Getting your Draw number
first is an improvement; but it is such a
small change when you consider the
immense potential for a quality Draw sys
tem. At least in the old system there was
some drama when you saw what numbers it
took to get into the houses on campus.
And so the beast lives on in the Housing
and Dining Services Office. Do not try to
sneak between its legs through some spe
cial Draw exempt spot. 1 tried to do so this
year by becoming the next social manager
at Alpha Sig, and they took away the damn
house.
My colleague Tom "The Bomb" Jacobs
tried the same thing. He pledged Delta
Kappa Epsilon last year only to see the
house ripped away. In another attempt this
year, he was elected one of Alpha Sig's
would-be house officers. There is simply no
escape from the beast.
