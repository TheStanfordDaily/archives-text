Row residents should
monitor house finances

As I read today's article on the embez
zlement of tens of thousands of dollars
from La Casa Italiana, I was surprised
that this was the first time in recent mem
ory that Row house embezzlement has
come to light.
The unfortunate incident illustrates
the astonishing absence of financial
accountability in Row houses, an issue
that has received a disconcerting lack of
attention in the past.
Before I graduated last spring, I lived
in Whitman house for three years. I spent
two of those years as the house / financial
manager.
During that time I learned a lot about
what should happen and what can happen
to residents' money.
The La Casa Italiana embezzlement
and the revelation last November of an
$ I JS.(KK) surplus at Grove (where the Row
Office happens to be located) are just two
examples of how haphazard financial
management on the Row can be.
The reason lies in the strength and
weakness of the Row — it is run by stu
dent managers who are truly accountable
only to the residents.
This characteristic provides an incredi
ble environment for managers to learn
and to take on responsibilities unheard of
at other universities.
Unfortunately however, residents

often don't have a clear idea of, or any
interest in.the amount of money a house
should be spending. As a result, suspect
financial practices can thrive on the Row.
My successor and I put out board bills
at a student-cleaned self-op with a profes
sional cook that probably averaged to less
than $750 per quarter. In the spring of
1997, the board bill was $670 and there
was still enough surplus from that single
quarter to give residents a $155 refund.
While at Stanford. I found it unbeliev
able when I heard about houses with
board bills exceeding $1,000 or being
chronically in debt.
Often, financial managers just don't
know how to manage the house's money
effectively.
Occasionally, money is embezzled,
which I must say is amazingly easy and
untraceable in a Row house.
Forget about cooking the books; you
don't even need to have books on the
Row! When I started managing, the only
financial records passed on were a few
receipts and an incomplete set of check
carbons.
Residents of Row houses have some
choices — risk getting bilked by the occa
sional inept or deceitful financial manag
er. hand over the auditing responsibility
to the University or a third party, or start
asking questions when your board bill
climbs over $900 (my personal favorite).
Row houses are and should continue
to be the most economical way to live on
campus. It's up to all Row residents to
make sure that it remains that way.

I am writing with great disgust in refer
ence to Aly Remtulla's Monday column,
"An anniversary not to celebrate." I have
respect for Mr. Remtulla's good inten
tions regarding the Middle East peace
process. However.l the one-sided manner
in which he represents his views are unac
ceptable.
Mr. Remtulla has made a great misin
terpretation over the reason Israel was
founded. Israel was founded through the
sheer determination and perseverance of
those who realized the urgent need for a
Jewish homeland.
Theodor Herzl would turn in his grave
if he knew Israel was today viewed as a
state "founded out of Western guilt as a
facile way to remove Jews from Europe
and North America by confining them to
territory in the Middle East," as Mr.
Remtulla would like to suggest. This is
not true.
Further, Mr. Remtulla makes an
extremely ignorant statement regarding
the Jews' "relative silence during geno
cide in Rwanda, Bosnia and elsewhere."
Has Mr. Remtulla done research or found
evidence that the Jews have been less
active than anyone else in recognizing the
obvious atrocities occurring in Rwanda
and Bosnia?

In fact, in June 19% Israel provided $1
million in food, medicine and technical
relief equipment for Rwanda. Further,
during the Bosnian war Israel sent sever
al shipments of humanitarian aid in the
form of food and medicines. In addition, I
would like Mr. Remtulla to know that the
chief prosecutor of the United Nations
International Criminal Tribunals for the
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Richard
J. Goldstone, is Jewish. Is this the
"silence" Mr. Remtulla is referring to?
Mr. Remtulla goes on to ask: "How
successful has Israel been?" Let me
answer that by saying that as a country
Israel has been extremely successful,
boasting one of the world's most stable
economies, as well as technological
advancement to rival any country in the
world.
We must not forget that 50 years ago
Israel was a barren wasteland, and today
it is a thriving country. That is reason
enough to celebrate.
I, too, am deeply distressed by the
unnecessary wars and loss of lives that
have occurred during Israel's 50-year his
tory. Yet, the country has survived. To
deny the celebration of a country's
anniversary is like denying the country's
existence.
I am deeply offended by the general
bias against the Jews that Mr. Remtulla
presents in his article. Throughout, there
is an underlying implication that Israel
should never have been declared a Jewish
state.
This is evident in Mr. Remtulla's state

ment: "I hope this time the correct deci
sion is made." Is Mr. Remtulla implying
that the last time, the incorrect decision
was made regarding the declaration of the
State of Israel? Mr. Remtulla comments
that "we cannot continue to argue about
the past." Aly Remtulla, you are stijl
arguing, and it is people like you who art
