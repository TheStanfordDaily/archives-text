## Expressing what Hallmark can't 
### 
Jocelyn Wiener

AS MY FAMILY gathers around
the dinner table, all ears are on my
grandmother as she unwinds the
joke.
A man in dirty, ragged clothing enters a
brothel. The madam looks up and asks how
she can help him.
"I would like to see Natalia," he replies.
"Natalia is our most expensive girl," the
madam tells him. Her clients pay $I,(MX) a
night. The man pulls a roll of money from
his threadbare pocket, peels off 10 $1(K) bills
and shows them to her. She motions him
upstairs.
The next night, he returns. "I'd like to
see Natalia again," he explains. "Alright,"
says the Madame, "but it will cost another
$I,(KX)." He shows the money and proceeds
upstairs.
When she sees him return for the third
night with another $I.(MK), Natalia herself is
intrigued.
"Where did you come from?" she asks
the mysterious stranger. He tells her the
name of his hometown.
"Why. my sister lives in that town!" she
exclaims.

"I know," replies the man. "She gave me
$3,(XX) to bring you."
My grandmother looks up and grins. "A
friend sent that to me on e-mail. Cute joke,
isn't it?"
My father laughs. "Grandmothers trad
ing dirty jokes over the Internet," he says.
My mother, stifling her amusement, laughs
out loud.
"It will be Mother's Day next week," she
said. I raise my eyebrows menacingly. By
now, she is a veteran of that sunshiny block
of time when her children annually deliver
burnt toast and runny eggs at 8 a.m. when
all she wants, just this once, is to sleep in. My
grandmother is also nonchalant, having sur
vived a good number of Mother's Days her
self.
Neither seems to realize that times
change when kids go to college. My family
lives so close to Stanford that I could go to
class with an umbilical cord attached. So I
didn't notice the change either — until 1
joined the crowd in front of the Hallmark
display case on the top floor of the Book
store.
1 looked over the shoulder of one guy.

who was holding a pink, flowered card. "To
those who comfort with a mother's hand, we
thank you. To those who encourage with a
mother's praise, we applaud you. To those
who love with a mother's heart, we honor
you."
A glittery, ribboned card (also pink and
flowered) says, "Today's your day. Mom.
Enjoy laughter and smiles and be good to
yourself."
Finally I locate a non-pink one. "Every
thing a grandma does she does because she
sees a chance to warm a heart or set a mind
at ease, a chance to gently touch the lives of
those she's fondest of."
No doubt such phrases capture some of
the essence of motherhood. My mother has
turned out to be the kind of mother who
buys ice cream every time you go to the
dentist, who strokes your forehead when
you're about to go to sleep and then pre
tends she doesn't see when you pull out a
flashlight to read under the covers. She is
the kind of mother who is there in the
friendless hours of third-grade square danc
ing, when the teacher angrily pronounces
you "stubborn" for refusing to partner up

with Scott L.
My grandmother always buys Softbatch
cookies and Lucky Charms for the distin
guished tastes of young visitors.
By decree, a grandchild must not leave
her house without being pronounced
"objectively" wonderful. In the "kiss-and
make-better" conception of "Mom." Hall
mark has the matriarchy of my family down
cold. Sort of.
But for $3.95 worth of flowers and glitter
and poetry, there seems to be a couple of
missing components. Hallmark probably
has a card relevant to the time my mom
stood up for me when the next door neigh
bor called me a tattletale.
But I bet they don't have one to thank
one of the (objectively) sweetest mothers in
the world for Hipping off some impatient
Bostonian who got frustrated with traffic
and proceeded to ram his car into ours.
Hallmark probably doesn't have a card
appreciating her for combining a teaching
career, a Ph.D. and four kids' worth of car
pools without exploding.
Hallmark probably has 12 cards thank
ing Gammv for alwavs sending me home

with a variety of dainties from her kitchen.
But I don't think I could find one to express
my admiration for her earning a chemistry
degree during the Depression. And what
about one for taking a class on Imperial
China, for talking to taxi drivers in
Guatemala, for doing water aerobics three
mornings a week? Where is the Hallmark
card with the "inappropriate" jokes that
make dinner so much fun?
My mother comes out with two freshly
made strawberry pies and whipped cream.
"Mom. you promised to take me to Baskin
Robbins." my youngest brother reminds
her.
" That's your problem," Gammy tells my
mom. "You can't promise them anything."
My brother continues his plea. My grand
mother waits a minute. "I could swing by
Baskin Robbins and pick up some icecream
for him." Gammy says.
I love them so much because they are
prototvpically Hallmark. And even mote
because they aren't.
