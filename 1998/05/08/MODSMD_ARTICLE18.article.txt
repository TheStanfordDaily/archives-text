The football hostesses, the Stanford fac

the football coaching staff to educate the
recruits and their parents about all aspects
of student life at Stanford. It is a process of
which we are very proud, one that includes

It is irresponsible for The Daily editorial

recruiting weekend.
First, they are included in a Faculty
•' Brunch on Saturday morning for the
recruits and their parents. Faculty are
' matched with recruits based on their
• ' intended majors. Similarly, a hostess is
' matched with each recruit based on two cri
teria: college major and hometown.
Throughout the Brunch, the recruit and his

parents learn about the academic life and
challenges at Stanford University. The
hostesses are an excellent resource for pro
viding a student's point of view. Secondly,
the hostesses give the group of recruits a 30-
minute. golf-cart tour of campus.
Any suggestion that this process is
"repugnant." as was referenced in your edi
torial, comes from a lack of understanding.
What a dangerous line the media crosses
when it writes editorials based on assump
tions, does no background check for facts
and has little knowledge of the topic.
The hostesses. Athletic Department,

In defense of the Dollies
To begin with. I would like to thank
Laura Back for the friendly tone she used
in her letter to the editor on May f>. Not
many offended women are as fair in their
assessment of the Dollies.
However, I am confused why she does
not believe that women, as well as men,
can admire the Dollies. Of course, this
issue is hardly new; as a Dollie in 1995-96,
1 found myself having to constantly
defend an institution of which 1 am a
proud member.
Being a Dollie is much more than
dancing in short, tight dresses. It is a les
son in public relations, time management
and group dynamics. It is a physical test of
endurance and a creative challenge to

choreograph 20 dances.
It is a time commitment of 30 hours a
week for a year, in addition to a full aca
demic load. So what if we wear tight dress
es? Yes. they do show off our legs because
sweatpants just would not allow for the
same clarity when we are kicking.
Take our model from ballerinas; leo
tards and tights are worn to show off the
lines of their bodies as they dance. Per
sonally. as a ballerina. 1 much prefer our
dresses to performing in leotards and
tights.
More importantly, whether we wear
tight dresses or not is not the point. We
are so secure in our notions of ourselves as
strong, capable women, that we do not
care if our wardrobe or our title causes us
to be perceived as floozies — we know
otherwise. Fortunately for us. we can be
seen as "cute" and "sexually appealing"
and know that, on the other hand, we are
headed to MD / Ph.D. programs next
year, we are starting companies in the Sil
icon Valley and we are graduating with
honors. If anything. I think that we are
models for this enlightened age. not
exploiters.
Ms. Back correctly lauds the five new
Dollies as "intelligent, hardworking and
respectable." but wonders why they
"choose" to be seen otherwise. The Dol
lies do not have a choice when members of
the audience stereotype us this way: we
certainly don't share the same perception
of ourselves.
So. instead of questioning our institu
tion, perhaps you should question your
mindset. You do not understand how "any
woman who takes herself seriously could
take part" as a Dollie.

1 do not understand how any woman
who tries to be open-minded about the
unlimited capabilities of women could
take part in such close-minded behavior.

Defining a Dollie
Although the word "dollv" is a little
different from what we in the Stanford
Band mean by "Dollie." I will neverthe
less, for the sake of argument, submit the
following excerpt from the Ye Olde C um
pleate and Unabridged Oxford English
Dictionary:
Dolly. 1. a familiar form of the name
Dorothy
2. a female pet or favorite ....
5. dolly-bar. a block or bar in the
trough of a grindstone which is lowered
into the water to raise the latter against
the face of the stone by displacement
In her letter in Wednesday's Daily.
Laura Back must have been thinking
about definition #2 when she claimed that
the name "Dollie" invites suspicion. She
chose that definition among others, and
she also chose one perspective among oth
ers when thinking about the role the Dol
lies play. The perspective she chose to
adopt — that the Dollies are flaunting
their bodies for the entertainment of the
audience — is certainly one which is
shared bv some audience members.

The point I want to make is that this is
not the perspective taken by the Dollies
themselves, by a vast majority of the mem
bers of the Stanford Hand, or by the many
audience members who choose to view
the Dollies as skilled artists taking part in
a long and respected tradition.
Dancing is undeniably a sexually
charged art form: it is about bodies in
motion. It is understandable that someone
who is not familiar with the medium could
consider it exploitative. Moreover, the
question Ms. Back raises regarding the
institution being traditionally all-female is
a legitimate one. However, to jump to the
conclusion that Dollies are presented as
"cute, sexuallv appealing, and little more"
is grossly unwarranted. Such a sweeping
generalization demonstrates either a
poorly thought-out argument or a deliber
ate misrepresentation. Needless to say. it
is disrespectful and belittling to the
women who Mv Back claims to be
defending from exploitation.
Contrary to Ms. Back's letter, the Dol
lies most certainly "take themselves seri
ouslv" so much so that they have the
self-confidence to dance in front of tens of
thousands of people at Stanford Stadium.
While the Band accepts literally hundreds
of musicians, there are only five Dollies,
and they are chosen from dozens of
women, nearly all of whom have danced
for years. Their artistic efforts deserve to
be taken just as seriously as the efforts of
Stanford's many top-notch female athletes
and countless top-notch female scholars.

In defense of the Dollies
To begin with. I would like to thank
Laura Back for the friendly tone she used
in her letter to the editor on May f>. Not
many offended women are as fair in their
assessment of the Dollies.
However, I am confused why she does
not believe that women, as well as men,
can admire the Dollies. Of course, this
issue is hardly new; as a Dollie in 1995-96,
1 found myself having to constantly
defend an institution of which 1 am a
proud member.
Being a Dollie is much more than
dancing in short, tight dresses. It is a les
son in public relations, time management
and group dynamics. It is a physical test of
endurance and a creative challenge to

choreograph 20 dances.
It is a time commitment of 30 hours a
week for a year, in addition to a full aca
demic load. So what if we wear tight dress
es? Yes. they do show off our legs because
sweatpants just would not allow for the
same clarity when we are kicking.
Take our model from ballerinas; leo
tards and tights are worn to show off the
lines of their bodies as they dance. Per
sonally. as a ballerina. 1 much prefer our
dresses to performing in leotards and
tights.
More importantly, whether we wear
tight dresses or not is not the point. We
are so secure in our notions of ourselves as
strong, capable women, that we do not
care if our wardrobe or our title causes us
to be perceived as floozies — we know
otherwise. Fortunately for us. we can be
seen as "cute" and "sexually appealing"
and know that, on the other hand, we are
headed to MD / Ph.D. programs next
year, we are starting companies in the Sil
icon Valley and we are graduating with
honors. If anything. I think that we are
models for this enlightened age. not
exploiters.
Ms. Back correctly lauds the five new
Dollies as "intelligent, hardworking and
respectable." but wonders why they
"choose" to be seen otherwise. The Dol
lies do not have a choice when members of
the audience stereotype us this way: we
certainly don't share the same perception
of ourselves.
So. instead of questioning our institu
tion, perhaps you should question your
mindset. You do not understand how "any
woman who takes herself seriously could
take part" as a Dollie.

1 do not understand how any woman
who tries to be open-minded about the
unlimited capabilities of women could
take part in such close-minded behavior.

Defining a Dollie
Although the word "dollv" is a little
different from what we in the Stanford
Band mean by "Dollie." I will neverthe
less, for the sake of argument, submit the
following excerpt from the Ye Olde C um
pleate and Unabridged Oxford English
Dictionary:
Dolly. 1. a familiar form of the name
Dorothy
2. a female pet or favorite ....
5. dolly-bar. a block or bar in the
trough of a grindstone which is lowered
into the water to raise the latter against
the face of the stone by displacement
In her letter in Wednesday's Daily.
Laura Back must have been thinking
about definition #2 when she claimed that
the name "Dollie" invites suspicion. She
chose that definition among others, and
she also chose one perspective among oth
ers when thinking about the role the Dol
lies play. The perspective she chose to
adopt — that the Dollies are flaunting
their bodies for the entertainment of the
audience — is certainly one which is
shared bv some audience members.

The point I want to make is that this is
not the perspective taken by the Dollies
themselves, by a vast majority of the mem
bers of the Stanford Hand, or by the many
audience members who choose to view
the Dollies as skilled artists taking part in
a long and respected tradition.
Dancing is undeniably a sexually
charged art form: it is about bodies in
motion. It is understandable that someone
who is not familiar with the medium could
consider it exploitative. Moreover, the
question Ms. Back raises regarding the
institution being traditionally all-female is
a legitimate one. However, to jump to the
conclusion that Dollies are presented as
"cute, sexuallv appealing, and little more"
is grossly unwarranted. Such a sweeping
generalization demonstrates either a
poorly thought-out argument or a deliber
ate misrepresentation. Needless to say. it
is disrespectful and belittling to the
women who Mv Back claims to be
defending from exploitation.
Contrary to Ms. Back's letter, the Dol
lies most certainly "take themselves seri
ouslv" so much so that they have the
self-confidence to dance in front of tens of
thousands of people at Stanford Stadium.
While the Band accepts literally hundreds
of musicians, there are only five Dollies,
and they are chosen from dozens of
women, nearly all of whom have danced
for years. Their artistic efforts deserve to
be taken just as seriously as the efforts of
Stanford's many top-notch female athletes
and countless top-notch female scholars.
