# Bulletin's new look doesn't appeal to all
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
It's the first day of the quarter.
You throw your brand new note
books. the Stanford Bulletin and the
Time Schedule into your backpack
and rush off to shop classes.
Sound familiar? Well, as of next
year, you might not be able to lit
those same items into your backpack
quite as easily. The Bulletin is grow
ing larger, and many students aren't
happy about it. Under the direction
of Registrar Roger Printup. the Stan
ford Bulletin, which contains infor
mation on courses and degree re
quirements. will increase in size from
6 by 9 inches to 8.5 by 11 inches. The
book will also triple in weight, going
from one pound to three pounds.
"The new version looks like a
phone book, like the Stanford Direc
tory," said one student who works in
the Registrar's Office. "It's twice the
paper size but has almost the same
stuff inside."
The complaints come as a surprise
to Printup, who envisioned these
changes as improvements.
"I've been hearing from students
and other people around the Univer
sity that the Bulletin is not attractive,
not accessible and dull," Printup said.
"Every comment on it over the past
five years has been negative."
The primary complaint that stu
dents voice about the new Bulletin is
that, due to its new. larger si/e. they
will not be able to carry it around with
them as easily.
"I prefer it the size it is now." said
junior Amy Chang. "It's easier to tote
around."
Printup asserts that the changes,
which also include a larger font and
thicker paper, are designed to make
the book more attractive and easier
to read. "The Bulletin is. of course,
primarily intended for students, but
we do also send it to a lot of places.

and we sell a couple thousand copies
of it a year," Printup said. "It does
represent Stanford, and I think that it
should say something good about this
University."
( hang said that the appearance of
the book is its least important aspect.
"I don't really care if it looks nicer,
just so it's easier to carry around," she
said.
As for being easier to read, that is
a subject not agreed upon by all ob
servers.
"It will be less dense, but in terms
of being more readable, that's debat
able." said Editorial and Publications
Coordinator Tom Stephens. "We're
changing the font and tripling the
space between the lines, but we're
not sure whether this new font is eas
ier to read than the old one."
The new Bulletin will also be
about 20 percent more expensive to
print, according to Stephens.
The student who works in the of
fice feels that "it's silly that they're
spending a great deal more money to
reformat in a manner that is less use
ful."
Despite the increased expendi
ture, the content is remaining essen
tially the same.
"We're adding a chart comparing
various majors, but other than that,
and a little reordering of content,
nothing inside is really new."
Stephens said.
Students seem puzzled by the in
crease in size and weight without a
corresponding increase in substance.
"If they were adding a lot more
info, then the change would be
worthwhile," said sophomore Justin
Der.
The Bulletin, which is currently
879 pages, will become slightly thin
ner at approximately 712 pages.
The new format of the Bulletin,
which will not be printed until Au
gust or September, is not finalized
completely.
