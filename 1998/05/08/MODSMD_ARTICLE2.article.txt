# UAC begins new advising program
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
It's hard to take advantage of everything Stanford has to offer. It's even
harder to be aware of all that Stanford has to offer. With this in mind, the
Undergraduate Advising Center is looking at new advising strategies to
better serve students.
In developing the new Freshman Advising Resources and Mentoring
undergraduate advising model. Lori White, director of undergraduate ad
vising, hopes to facilitate freshmen's understanding o! University re
sources and help these students more knowlodgeably navigate their four
years at Stanford.
The existing undergraduate advising model is familiar to most Stan
ford students. A group of about seven or eight freshmen meet with an ad-
vising associate and a faculty advis
er several times throughout the
academic year.
While the existing model is help
ful to some students, others find
that the knowledge and availability
of advisers is inconsistent at best.
The new model differs from the
existing one in several ways. A key
difference is the addition of a grad
uate student mentor into the advis
ing scenario.
"About half our campus is made
up of graduate students... a won
derful but untapped resource,"
White said.
"Graduate students can help un
dergrads understand how best to
negotiate a campus the size of Stan
ford.
They can advise undergrads on
how to feel comfortable approach
ing faculty."
In addition, graduate students
might be useful for students' deci
sions about majors and careers.
"Before they come to Stanford,
students are asked about their pre
liminary academic area of interest.
But do they really know what that
means?" White asked. "The gradu
ate students can have really exten
sive conversations with students

about what that really means and
what skills will make them most
successful."
White also noted that graduate
students would be given a small re
search grant in exchange for their
advising services.
The program also features more
consistent advising sessions than its
predecessor.
"There will be a weekly group
session facilitated by the graduate
mentor and the AA that will last at
least one hour per week," White
said.
New students at Stanford are
asked to absorb a lot of information
during Orientation.
"We want to stretch out that
concept over a whole quarter," she
said.
The program will be an option
for incoming students of the class of
2002. Those who don't opt for it
will work under the existing under
graduate advising model.
Organizers hope for 200 partici
pants in the pilot year, and. if that
goal is reached, those students will
all be placed in West Lagunita. If
less than 2(X) students express inter
est in the program, however, the
program will instead be piloted in
Rinconada and Otero.
Graduate students interested in
participating should contact White
