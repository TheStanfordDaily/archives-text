WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Today: (iAME£ ONE — Stanford vs.
Michigan in the first round of the women's
water polo National Championship Tourna
ment ;it Long Beach State, l():l()a.m. GAME
I'WO — Stanford vs. Massachusetts at USC,
7:30 p.m.
■ Saturday: Semifinal round at IJSC.
■ Sunday: Final round at I ISC.

At the women's water polo National
Championships at USC and Long Beach
State this weekend, it's the Stanford team

that has that advantage.
I he No. 2 Cardinal squad will have to de
feat Michigan and Massachusetts today in
older to qualify for the semifinals tomorrow,
which will probably be against No. 3 (Califor
nia if past tournaments are any indication.
If Stanford can beat ('al again — the ( ai d
has toppled the Bears in the past three meet
ings between the two — then the Stanford
team will be playing in the final against top
ranked IJCLA. I Jnlessthe undefeated Bruin
squad loses hold of its winning streak.
"I think it's really good to be going in
[ranked] second," said junior Lindsay l am.
"UCLA can't improve — they just have to
hold their position. We have nothing to lose
so we can come out a lot more confident."
At last year's nationals, Stanford lost the
third-place match to San Diego State in an 8-
7 overtime decision. Cal took second while

UCLA won the national title for the second
year in a row.
This year, the Card is enjoying its best
ranking ever under the direction of new
head coaeh John Tanner and assistant coach
Susan ()rtwein, who left their coaching posi
tions at University of Pacific to take over the
Stanford program.
" The team is in really good spirits and
they seem ready to play," Tanner said.
"Everything this year has been focused on
pulling us in a position where we can win.
That's the way we've operated since the first
day."
The Stanford squad and coaching staff
have been fine-tuning the team's strategies
and skills during the two weeks since the
Western Regional tournament, and the
overall attitude of everyone is confident.
" The energy level is really high and posi

tive," said sophomore f:lissa Keszler.
"We're having so much fun right now. We're
nervous, but we're not showing it [in prac
tice). We're ready to bring it."
Stanford's first two games in the tourna
ment are against teams the Card has not
faced this year— Michigan and UMass.
"It's going to be a real contrast between
the two teams we've never played before
and don't know much about and then [if we
advance], the teams we've faced three or
four times already this year," Tanner said.
"UMass is going to be tough," Keszler
said. "Hut it's good to have to play a good
team [on the first day]. We can use that team
to set the tone for the whole weekend."
I he ('ardinal's success this season is the re
sult of many hours of practice, strength train
ing and strategizing But most importantly, it
has been a total team effort from day one.

"It's what everyone has done every day at
practice," lam said. "It's all the little things
that everyone's contributing that makes the
difference. That's what's gotten us where we
are. and if we win. it will be a win for all of us."
"I've never been on a team that puts so
much heart into everything," Keszlersaid. "I
feel really good and really confident about
the way things are going."
It has been a long season for the Cardinal
women, who began practicing in October
and haven't ha ! much reprieve since then.
Nevertheless, !,e team still seems to have a
lot of energy left going into the final — and
definitive — weekend of the season.
"We're looking strong in the water, we've
been tapering, the energy level is really
high.... People are focused because it's the
end and you've got to push through," Tam
said.
It all conies down to who has nothing to
lose.
