All the cliches, all the statistics and all the one-lin
ers won't do this series justice.
In Saturday's opener, the No. I Stanford Cardinal
will find itself just one victory away from achieving the
first of its several preseason goals w hile facing one of
the top pitchers in the nation.

No. 7 USC (37-13 overall, 19-8 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) comes to Sunken Diamond
with the hopes of sweeping Stanford (40-8-1, 21-ft)
and robbing it of back-to-back division titles. Just one
Cardinal victory in the three-game series, however,
would send Stanford to the Pac-10 Championship rep
resenting the Southern Division.
"Whenever you get a win. it's big." said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "But this was one of our
goals. We'll be disappointed il we don't win (the
title]."
Trojan star Setli Etherton (10-2) will hike to the
mound Saturday with the goal of shutting down Stan
ford's big red offensive machine, which has a team
batting average of .316 and 7ft home runs. Shutting
down offenses, however, is something Etherton's
been doing all year.
"He doesn't make that manv mistakes." said Stan

ford junior centerfielder Jody Gerut. whose solo
home run was the only run scored in the Cardinal's
previous encounter with F.thcrton. "Last time we
faced him, he established the corners of the plate early
and he does that well. If we can identify that early. I
think we will put more balls in play. We need to stay
aggressive."
Needing to win just one out of three games could
make a team lazy, but Marquess knows that this can't
be a problem.
"There's a carry-over into the postseason." Mar
quess said. "You're always concerned about relaxing
your game. We're smart enough to realize we can't
relax. It's not the personality of this team to do that."

It's an all too familiar position for Marquess. I lead
ing into the final conference series of this season at
UCLA. Stanford needed just one win to take last
year's division title and ended up with a large
headache. The Cardinal got its victory, but it took
three games to do it.
While Stanford took two ol three at I 'SC earlier
this year and comes oft a three-game sweep ot the
then-No. 13 Arizona State Sun I )evils. the Trojans are
returning from a nine-dav break for finals. Having
won eight <.>t" its last nine games, however, I S(' has the
capability to give Stanford another headache.

Senior shortstop Jay Pecci dives back into first base during the Cardinal's game against California April
26. This weekend, Pecci and the rest of the Card take aim at USC, the only team that can still swipe the
Pacific 10 Southern Division title away from Stanford. The Card needs to win one game to seal up the
race.
"In postseason plav there's an
element of luck, but over the regu
lar season it's more consistency
and that's what's nice about win
ning the Southern Division in the
Pac-10 conference," Marquess
said. "We know we will need to
play well to beat them."
1 Junior Jeff Austin (11-2). who
will be i)n the mound for the Cardi
nal tomorrow, knows he has to be
}it his best to match Etherton's per
formance. According to Marquess,
though, this is not a foreign ap
proach for Austin.
Austin "has pitched well every
weekend for us," Marquess said. "He

always gives us a chance to win."
This time, however, Austin will
be giving the Cardinal a chance to
win more than just a game.
