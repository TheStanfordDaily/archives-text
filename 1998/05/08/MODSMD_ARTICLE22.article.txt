Stanford needs just one win against Oregon
to clinch a third-place finish in the Pac-10. De
pending on how Washington does this weekend
in Pac-10 play, the Card could finish in a tie for
second.
Earlier in the season. Stanford split with both
()regon schools. April 4 saw the t ard drop the
first game toOregon State 3-2. but came back in
the second game of the doubleheader 1-0 to
earn the split. l~he next day against Oregon.
Stanford again lost the titst game M but rallied
to take the second 4-0.
Stanford is not looking to split this weekend

with either team. Winning against both schools
is important not only fot Pac-10 standing hut
also lor regional selections, which will be an
nounced on Monday Ihe Card is vying for a
top-seed or a two seed in one of the eight re
gions.
Moth Oregon schools bring solid squads to
the field. I lie Beavers and Ducks both have
strengths in defense and pitching, and they will
therefore match up well with Stanford.
Oregon State is led at the plate by sopho
more larrah Be\ster. who is cunently batting
.402 with RBls and 12 home tuns. Beyster is
the only Beaver whoisbattingover .300: she also
leads the Beaver's pitching staff. sporting a 1.40
ERA with a 21-14 record for the season.
Recently the Beavers have been on a skid,
losing nine ol their last 1 1 games. 1 ast weekend
they were swept by No. 4 Washington 7-1. 8-2
and split with I Jt'LAO-3,2-0.
I hc Ducks are led by sophomore Jill Robin
son and junior Katie Murphy . Against Washing
ton last weekend. Murphy hit a grad slam and
Robinson went 3 for 4in an 11 -8 victory.
Both ()regon teams w ill have tocontend with
a Stanford team that ts playing at the top of its
game. While the Card's pitching and defense
have been solid all year, its hitting which has
been inconsistent for much of the season — has
picked up recently.
