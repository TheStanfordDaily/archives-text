# Not your typical Hall of Famer
## Koppett reflects on life, sports and journalism 
### 
/ ■ i \er\ day isn't going to he a possible
§H Pulit/er Prize." I his is just one of thi
J Jman\ pieces of advice I heard Iron
Leonard Koppett. Hall of Famer.
So what is his lifetime batting average, you ask?
How many points did he score, you wonder? Well,
he's a Hall of Famer of a slightly different genre.
You see. he's in the sportswriter's wing of both the
Basketball and Baseball Hall of Fame.
Now 74 and living in the Palo Alto area. 1 spent
my Wednesday afternoon in Koppett's living room
discussing the past and the future of the sports world
he has covered for several New York papers for the
better part of his life.

And what a past it v\as! A self-proclaimed ' bred
but not born'" New Yorker, he covered the New
York sports scene for? 2 years dating back to his un
dergraduate da\s at Columbia University. These
were the da\s of Yankee supremacy. Bobby
Thompson's pennant-winning home run.the epic
(iiants-Colts NFI Championship game, the birth of
the NBA and the height of the Nil college basket
ball tournament.
Not a bad time to be a sportswriter.
But had Koppett not escaped the grasp of Joseph
Stalin's purges, his career never would have taken
off. As he has said in past interviews, his strong be
lief in luck started from his childhood days in
Moscow.
\ stroke of good fortune
Ihe heavyset. jovial man who was sitting before
me on this rainy afternoon tells one heck of a sports
story. But it's Koppett's escape from Russia that is
probably the most poignant.
His parents came from Kerch, a port and resort
town on the Black Sea. in what is now I kraine. His
father grew up in a privileged world of wealth and
was able to attend college and become a musician.
After spending most of World War I as a pr isoncr of
war in Hungary. Koppett's father returned to
Moscow after the Russian Revolution of I^l7.
One problem: Because Koppett's father came
from a tradition of affluent capitalists, his family w as
in clear danger under the socialist regime. So he re
lied on Koppett's mother's family, made up of doc
tors and engineers useful to the new regime, for
help.
But Koppett's family was able to gain some re
prieve in another way.
"One of the few things the country had to sell
were fish products caviar, herring." Koppett said
in a 1 Wfi interview. "And this is exactly what my fa
ther had grown up with in his father's business. So
they put him to work in the foreign trade office and
eventually sent him to New York in W27."
Five-year-old Leonard Koppett and his mother
followed a year later. It was shortly thereafter that
Stalin began his infamous purges. With the country
experiencing famine, the scapegoats were members
of the food industry. Needless to say. Koppett's fa
ther quietly left his job, became an American citizen
and found other work in New York City.
In the shadow of greatness
The Koppett family settled into the Bronx area.
