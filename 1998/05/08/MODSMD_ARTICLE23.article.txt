# Not your typical Hall of Famer
## Koppett reflects on life, sports and journalism 
###

J Jman\ pieces of advice I heard Iron
Leonard Koppett. Hall of Famer.
So what is his lifetime batting average, you ask?
How many points did he score, you wonder? Well,
he's a Hall of Famer of a slightly different genre.
You see. he's in the sportswriter's wing of both the
Basketball and Baseball Hall of Fame.
Now 74 and living in the Palo Alto area. 1 spent
my Wednesday afternoon in Koppett's living room
discussing the past and the future of the sports world
he has covered for several New York papers for the
better part of his life.

And what a past it v\as! A self-proclaimed ' bred
but not born'" New Yorker, he covered the New
York sports scene for? 2 years dating back to his un
dergraduate da\s at Columbia University. These
were the da\s of Yankee supremacy. Bobby
Thompson's pennant-winning home run.the epic
(iiants-Colts NFI Championship game, the birth of
the NBA and the height of the Nil college basket
ball tournament.
Not a bad time to be a sportswriter.
But had Koppett not escaped the grasp of Joseph
Stalin's purges, his career never would have taken
off. As he has said in past interviews, his strong be
lief in luck started from his childhood days in
Moscow.
\ stroke of good fortune
Ihe heavyset. jovial man who was sitting before
me on this rainy afternoon tells one heck of a sports
story. But it's Koppett's escape from Russia that is
probably the most poignant.
His parents came from Kerch, a port and resort
town on the Black Sea. in what is now I kraine. His
father grew up in a privileged world of wealth and
was able to attend college and become a musician.
After spending most of World War I as a pr isoncr of
war in Hungary. Koppett's father returned to
Moscow after the Russian Revolution of I^l7.
One problem: Because Koppett's father came
from a tradition of affluent capitalists, his family w as
in clear danger under the socialist regime. So he re
lied on Koppett's mother's family, made up of doc
tors and engineers useful to the new regime, for
help.
But Koppett's family was able to gain some re
prieve in another way.
"One of the few things the country had to sell
were fish products caviar, herring." Koppett said
in a 1 Wfi interview. "And this is exactly what my fa
ther had grown up with in his father's business. So
they put him to work in the foreign trade office and
eventually sent him to New York in W27."
Five-year-old Leonard Koppett and his mother
followed a year later. It was shortly thereafter that
Stalin began his infamous purges. With the country
experiencing famine, the scapegoats were members
of the food industry. Needless to say. Koppett's fa
ther quietly left his job, became an American citizen
and found other work in New York City.
In the shadow of greatness
The Koppett family settled into the Bronx area.


Ed
Guzman
hear hallowed Yankee Stadium.
The young Koppett began to see a
glimpse of his future.
"As a kid living around Yankee
Stadium, you were very aware of
what was going on." Koppett said.
"I played a lot of baseball in the
streets, but I wasn't any good at it.
There were no dreams of being an
athlete. So the natural thing in
those days was to be a writer. There
was no radio and no television to
speak of."
He was first exposed to the New
York newspaper scene at Colum
bia. where he enrolled in the fall of
1940. He began doing correspon
dent work for several papers, cov
ering Columbia's sports teams.
After three years of serving in the
army during World War 11. he re
turned to be a stringer for six or
seven news organizations, includ
ing The New York Times and the
Associated Press.
"That was great training," Kop
pett said. "You're writing the same
lead six different times for six dif
ferent places. Then I got a job, and
1 never moved into anything else.
In one sense, it was a way of not
growing up."
A golden age
Koppett's first full-time job was
•at the New York Herald-Tribune,
where he covered mostly college
basketball until 1954. From there,
he moved on to the New York Post,
where he covered a budding young
league called the NBA. History
was unfolding before his eyes, and
"he got to tell the story.
In early 1963, New York City was
crippled by a 1 14-day newspaper
strike. Suddenly with no real work,
Koppett began to wonder if he want
ed to stay in journalism. The thought
-of switching papers and that some
paper might be willing to pay him
more never occurred to him. But The
.New York limes needed a baseball
.writer, and Koppett had always
'wanted to work for them full-time.
"So I'm back in business work
ing at The limes and making a bet
ter living," Koppett said. " That was
the last time there was any ques
tion about staving in."

Alas, if I was looking for a funny
Mickey Mantle story or a vivid de
scription of being in the press box
at Ebbetts Field, Koppett was
going to tell me to go look it up.
"1 believe that one of the most im
portant characteristics that a newspa
per man has to have is a short memo
ry," Koppett said. "You write your
story, you hand it in and it's gone.
Something will be there the next
morning. I don't remember a lot. but
1 know where to look it up. But you
have to know how and be willing to
look things up."
A world of fun and games?
Perhaps one ol the reasons Kop
pett seems hesitant to fondly recall
his days covering the Yankees is
because issues like labor unions
and antitrust laws were beginning
to protrude the sports world.
"It came on gradually," Koppett
said. "It started in the 1950s with
the Congressional hearings on
baseball's antitrust laws. 1 would be
the one who was sent to it because
that was the side of the boat it fell
on. Then the player unions are
starting and so you've got to write
about that because it's part of the
beat. After a while, the courtroom
becomes your beat, so 1 got good
grounding in that."
After moving to Palo Alto in
1973 to serve as the Times' West
Coast correspondent. Koppett got
the opportunity to teach a sports
journalism class at Stanford based
on his 30-plus years of practical ex
perience. Out of this course, called
"Sports Culture." came a book he
titled "Sports Illusion. Sports Real
ity." Published in 1981. the obser
vations and views in the book are
strikingly relevant today.
"Of course, all the details are dif
ferent," Koppett said. "But really
nothing's changed because you can't
change the fundamental appeal and
therefore the financial viability of
what professional sports is.
"What I try to do in the book is
get at the underlying principles of
how that works."
Perhaps the most striking exam
ple of relevancy was when he
states: "In broadcasting, hype pays
off and credibility doesn't count for
much."
Remember, this is written be
fore Sportscenter hit its stride and

countless other sports highlight
shows infiltrated the airwaves.
"Now for the first time, they're
boasting about their lack of credi
bility," Koppett said Wednesday.
"The phenomenon of the talk show
is the antithesis of journalism.
There's not even a desire for seri
ous approach to news.
"My idea of news is to tell peo
ple what's going on so that they can
decide what they think about.
What we've fallen into is the guys is
telling you what he thinks without
even bothering to tell you why he
thinks it. 'President Clinton is a
schmuck, but just take my word for
it.' That is not my idea of journal
ism."
Journalists "make the bricks so
architects can build houses. With
out bricks, they can't build houses.
But the bricks have to be legitimate
good bricks."
Hard work pays off
The Baseball Hall of Fame
came calling in IW2. and Koppett
got inducted into the Basketball
Hall of Fame two years later. His
career was essentially complete.
"I was very pleased by it be
cause I earned it." Koppett said.
"There was a time when 1 really
was the most active basketball
writer when I was with the Post,
when the league was just taking
form. I was on the ground floor and
1 feel like 1 had an influence."
But this does not mean he has
stopped writing. Koppett still occa
sionally contributes to the Oakland
Tribune and the San Mateo Coun
ty Times, showing some of the old
flair that made him one of the best
in his business. But he has also
gained a good sense of perspective.
"I'm just starting to get a grasp
on what it's really about," Koppett
said. My old writing "seems to me
naive and incomplete compared to
what I would think now. I under
stand more what they're trying to
do and why things come out the
way they do."

help.
But Koppett's family was able to gain some re
prieve in another way.
"One of the few things the country had to sell
were fish products caviar, herring." Koppett said
in a 1 Wfi interview. "And this is exactly what my fa
ther had grown up with in his father's business. So
they put him to work in the foreign trade office and
eventually sent him to New York in W27."
Five-year-old Leonard Koppett and his mother
followed a year later. It was shortly thereafter that
Stalin began his infamous purges. With the country
experiencing famine, the scapegoats were members
of the food industry. Needless to say. Koppett's fa
ther quietly left his job, became an American citizen
and found other work in New York City.
In the shadow of greatness
The Koppett family settled into the Bronx area.

hear hallowed Yankee Stadium.
The young Koppett began to see a
glimpse of his future.
"As a kid living around Yankee
Stadium, you were very aware of
what was going on." Koppett said.
"I played a lot of baseball in the
streets, but I wasn't any good at it.
There were no dreams of being an
athlete. So the natural thing in
those days was to be a writer. There
was no radio and no television to
speak of."
He was first exposed to the New
York newspaper scene at Colum
bia. where he enrolled in the fall of
1940. He began doing correspon
dent work for several papers, cov
ering Columbia's sports teams.
After three years of serving in the
army during World War 11. he re
turned to be a stringer for six or
seven news organizations, includ
ing The New York Times and the
Associated Press.
"That was great training," Kop
pett said. "You're writing the same
lead six different times for six dif
ferent places. Then I got a job, and
1 never moved into anything else.
In one sense, it was a way of not
growing up."
A golden age
Koppett's first full-time job was
•at the New York Herald-Tribune,
where he covered mostly college
basketball until 1954. From there,
he moved on to the New York Post,
where he covered a budding young
league called the NBA. History
was unfolding before his eyes, and
"he got to tell the story.
In early 1963, New York City was
crippled by a 1 14-day newspaper
strike. Suddenly with no real work,
Koppett began to wonder if he want
ed to stay in journalism. The thought
-of switching papers and that some
paper might be willing to pay him
more never occurred to him. But The
.New York limes needed a baseball
.writer, and Koppett had always
'wanted to work for them full-time.
"So I'm back in business work
ing at The limes and making a bet
ter living," Koppett said. " That was
the last time there was any ques
tion about staving in."

Alas, if I was looking for a funny
Mickey Mantle story or a vivid de
scription of being in the press box
at Ebbetts Field, Koppett was
going to tell me to go look it up.
"1 believe that one of the most im
portant characteristics that a newspa
per man has to have is a short memo
ry," Koppett said. "You write your
story, you hand it in and it's gone.
Something will be there the next
morning. I don't remember a lot. but
1 know where to look it up. But you
have to know how and be willing to
look things up."
A world of fun and games?
Perhaps one ol the reasons Kop
pett seems hesitant to fondly recall
his days covering the Yankees is
because issues like labor unions
and antitrust laws were beginning
to protrude the sports world.
"It came on gradually," Koppett
said. "It started in the 1950s with
the Congressional hearings on
baseball's antitrust laws. 1 would be
the one who was sent to it because
that was the side of the boat it fell
on. Then the player unions are
starting and so you've got to write
about that because it's part of the
beat. After a while, the courtroom
becomes your beat, so 1 got good
grounding in that."
After moving to Palo Alto in
1973 to serve as the Times' West
Coast correspondent. Koppett got
the opportunity to teach a sports
journalism class at Stanford based
on his 30-plus years of practical ex
perience. Out of this course, called
"Sports Culture." came a book he
titled "Sports Illusion. Sports Real
ity." Published in 1981. the obser
vations and views in the book are
strikingly relevant today.
"Of course, all the details are dif
ferent," Koppett said. "But really
nothing's changed because you can't
change the fundamental appeal and
therefore the financial viability of
what professional sports is.
"What I try to do in the book is
get at the underlying principles of
how that works."
Perhaps the most striking exam
ple of relevancy was when he
states: "In broadcasting, hype pays
off and credibility doesn't count for
much."
Remember, this is written be
fore Sportscenter hit its stride and

countless other sports highlight
shows infiltrated the airwaves.
"Now for the first time, they're
boasting about their lack of credi
bility," Koppett said Wednesday.
"The phenomenon of the talk show
is the antithesis of journalism.
There's not even a desire for seri
ous approach to news.
"My idea of news is to tell peo
ple what's going on so that they can
decide what they think about.
What we've fallen into is the guys is
telling you what he thinks without
even bothering to tell you why he
thinks it. 'President Clinton is a
schmuck, but just take my word for
it.' That is not my idea of journal
ism."
Journalists "make the bricks so
architects can build houses. With
out bricks, they can't build houses.
But the bricks have to be legitimate
good bricks."
Hard work pays off
The Baseball Hall of Fame
came calling in IW2. and Koppett
got inducted into the Basketball
Hall of Fame two years later. His
career was essentially complete.
"I was very pleased by it be
cause I earned it." Koppett said.
"There was a time when 1 really
was the most active basketball
writer when I was with the Post,
when the league was just taking
form. I was on the ground floor and
1 feel like 1 had an influence."
But this does not mean he has
stopped writing. Koppett still occa
sionally contributes to the Oakland
Tribune and the San Mateo Coun
ty Times, showing some of the old
flair that made him one of the best
in his business. But he has also
gained a good sense of perspective.
"I'm just starting to get a grasp
on what it's really about," Koppett
said. My old writing "seems to me
naive and incomplete compared to
what I would think now. I under
stand more what they're trying to
do and why things come out the
way they do."

journalist.

/ ■ i \er\ day isn't going to he a possible
§H Pulit/er Prize." I his is just one of thi
J Jman\ pieces of advice I heard Iron
Leonard Koppett. Hall of Famer.
So what is his lifetime batting average, you ask?
How many points did he score, you wonder? Well,
he's a Hall of Famer of a slightly different genre.
You see. he's in the sportswriter's wing of both the
Basketball and Baseball Hall of Fame.
Now 74 and living in the Palo Alto area. 1 spent
my Wednesday afternoon in Koppett's living room
discussing the past and the future of the sports world
he has covered for several New York papers for the
better part of his life.

And what a past it v\as! A self-proclaimed ' bred
but not born'" New Yorker, he covered the New
York sports scene for? 2 years dating back to his un
dergraduate da\s at Columbia University. These
were the da\s of Yankee supremacy. Bobby
Thompson's pennant-winning home run.the epic
(iiants-Colts NFI Championship game, the birth of
the NBA and the height of the Nil college basket
ball tournament.
Not a bad time to be a sportswriter.
But had Koppett not escaped the grasp of Joseph
Stalin's purges, his career never would have taken
off. As he has said in past interviews, his strong be
lief in luck started from his childhood days in
Moscow.
\ stroke of good fortune
Ihe heavyset. jovial man who was sitting before
me on this rainy afternoon tells one heck of a sports
story. But it's Koppett's escape from Russia that is
probably the most poignant.
His parents came from Kerch, a port and resort
town on the Black Sea. in what is now I kraine. His
father grew up in a privileged world of wealth and
was able to attend college and become a musician.
After spending most of World War I as a pr isoncr of
war in Hungary. Koppett's father returned to
Moscow after the Russian Revolution of I^l7.
One problem: Because Koppett's father came
from a tradition of affluent capitalists, his family w as
in clear danger under the socialist regime. So he re
lied on Koppett's mother's family, made up of doc
tors and engineers useful to the new regime, for
help.
But Koppett's family was able to gain some re
prieve in another way.
"One of the few things the country had to sell
were fish products caviar, herring." Koppett said
in a 1 Wfi interview. "And this is exactly what my fa
