# Triathlon club is born
## Swimmers, runners, bikers carve out niche on Farm

A one-mile swim, a 24-mile
bike ride and 6.2-mile run. togeth
er. in succession, with no break,
all by yourself.
This is the hell or heaven to
some — known as a triathlon.
This year, senior Josh Dapice
and freshman Dave Mayer joined
forces and created a club for Stan
ford so die-hard students could
compete for their school.
"Stanford has produced six or
seven pro triathletes in the past,
but it has never been a cohesive
group," Mayer said. "So when I
met Josh at a race last year we de
cided to do it."
Both Mayer and Dapice are
veterans of the sport.
Originally a swimmer from
Boston. Dapice got into triathlons
at the age of 15 after realizing he
was never going to be a world
class swimmer. He finished in the
middle of the pack in his first race
but thought he could improve.
He kept working and eventual
ly won a handful of races and a
spot on the junior national team,
which he has been a member of
for two years.
"I like triathlons because tal
ent doesn't play as much a part as
desire and work ethic," Dapice
said. "In certain sports if you
don't have the quickness or skill,
you're going to hit a glass ceiling.
But in triathlons, it's all about
how good you want to be. The
most deserving athlete always
wins."
After he graduates this year,
Dapice will continue training and
racing professionally around the
United States, starting with the
Goodwill Games qualifying
triathlon in Florida this summer.
As for Mayer, he was a swim
mer and runner at San Mateo
High School. 30 miles north of

Stanford. At the Farm, he runs
the SOO for the track team. After
graduating two years ago. Mayer
took a year off and trained six
hours a day 60 miles of running.
300 miles of biking and 20 miles
of swimming a week — for the
Canadian Ironman.
The Ironman is the mother ol
all triathlons. It consists of a 2.5-
mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride,
and a 26.2-mile run. Mayer was
the second-youngest competitor.
"It was a long day. but fun."
Mayer said. "It was more a test of
patience and will. Coming off the
bike and thinking I would have to
run a marathon was mentally in
timidating. It's unlike any race
I've raced before because 1 wasn't
concerned about going fast. I just
wanted to cover the ground."
After Dapice met Mayer at a
race last year, they decided to
form a club at Stanford. The team
gathered members by word of
mouth or hearing about friends of
friends.
Dapice expects the team will
gather strength and members
over the next couple of years and
claims it will only be a matter of
time before they win the Wild
flower triathlon, the nationa
championship race.
At Stanford's first showing las
week at the Wildflower 1 riathlor
in San Luis Obispo, the Cart
placed two athletes in the top 10
Dapice placed third after an all
out sprint in the final 20 \ ards anc
graduate student Matt Mi
Cormick placed ninth.
Dapice was pleased with hi>
performance after a knee injury
prevented him from running for
four weeks prior to the race. He
had a solid swim, finishing with
teammates McCormick and
sophomore Kurt Spencer and led
on the bike for the majority of the
race.
Dapice was concerned he

would hit the wall during the run
but he ran well, finishing two min
utes. six seconds behind Universi
ty of Oregon's Matt Saracenoaml
University of Arizona's Da\
Seargant.
More impressive even than th
individual performances was tli
fact that it was the first year Stan
ford fronted a team, as well as it
dominating performance on th
first leg. the one-mile swim.
Four of the top five men U
come out of the water were from
Stanford. Freshman Adam Mess
ner. a member of the Stanford
men's swim team, swam in first
breaking the course record. 11
was followed by Spencer, also
member of the swim team. M
Cormick and Dapice.
Mayer was unable to compel
because of a broken foot.
"I was more excited to see the
club get going." said a humble
Dapice. "There are a lot of great
athletes that can't be on varsii\
teams for whatever reason. Th
club is a good chance to do some
thing for Stanford."
I nfortunateh. Stanford didn't
place as a team because the\
needed three men and three
women competing. But sopho
more Emma Brown was Stan
ford's sole female competitor.
"It was a realh good showing
for the first year, especially since
teams like Colorado bring out 80
people." Mayer said. "It's really
good publicity to have a Stanford
gu\ the first one out of the water.
Two guys in the top 10 was better
than any other team."
As for now, the members of
the triathlon club will keep on
running, swimming and biking
their way to a national champi
onship.
The team's next challenge will
be May 17 when the team will
compete in the Powerbar South
bay Triathlon in San Jose.
