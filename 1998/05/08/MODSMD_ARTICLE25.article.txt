# White to display art at Spring Fair
## 
### Ariana Garfinkel Contributing writer 
Alma White loves to paint happy
families and guardian angels. Living a
life in which the first has been stolen
from her and the second does not al
ways intervene, the 42-year-old artist
— who once was homeless — finds
her joy in creative expression.
"When I'm drawing," White said,
"I feel like my friends are coming out
of my fingers, coming out to play with
me. And when other people enjoy my
art, it's like I'm bringing new people
into my world."
This weekend, White hopes to
bring the Stanford campus into her
world, as she joins over 130 other
artists displaying their work at the
Spring Fair in White Plaza.
White's booth will feature her
color prints, stationery and original
paintings and drawings.
Her pictures are mostly brightly
colored scenes of dark-skinned peo

pic engaged in what White calls "or
dinary life" — a mother combing her
child's hair, a girl sitting amidst a gar
den of flowers or musicians practic
ing. She expresses a sense of intimacy,
community and pleasure in the world
that may combat some of her own life
experience. White will also bring her
hand-made dolls dressed in African
style clothing to the fair.
"I never had black dolls growing
up because they didn't make them
back then," White said. "It made me
think maybe there was something
wrong or ugly about being black.
When 1 had my own daughter, 1
wanted her to play with black dolls, so
1 decided I had to make them my
self."
White so frequently mentioned
her now 1 S-year-old daughter that it's
a surprise to learn she hardly knows
the young woman. Fifteen years ago,
White's twin daughter and son were
kidnapped by their African father,
who Hew the 3-vear-olds to Kenva

and never returned, she said.
Unable to raise enough money for
airfare, White was brushed aside by
missing children organizations and
ignored by the U.S. Embassy. She
tried for a year to retrieve her chil
dren, but when Christmas came, she
realized that her older son Dominic
was paying the price for the tragedy.
"I was so torn up about my kids
being in Kenya that I had bought
them Christmas presents and
couldn't afford any for Dominic,"
White recalled. "I had been holding
on so hard to those kids, but at that
point, I knew I had to raise the son
who was here with me."
White receives Social Security and
general assistance while nurturing
her art career with exhibitions all
over the area. Currently, her art can
be viewed in the window of The
Great American Framing Shop and
at the Cafe Renaissance in downtown
Palo Alto. Cafe Renaissance shows
the work of various local artists, but

an employee said that White's work
has sold more than any other since it
was included at the beginning of the
year. Five of her pieces have been
bought in the past month.
"I know that I have talent," she
said, "and that I can be successful as
an artist. Everyone who helps me get
my art seen gives me a little piece of
the puzzle to help me on my way."
The Stanford Spring Fair will be
another chance for White to get her
work out to the public. The Bridge,
which puts on the event as one of its
fund raisers, donated a booth to
White in exchange for an original
painting of hers.
Although White has been inter
ested in art throughout life, she had
not considered making a living from
it until she found herself with few
other options. She traced her finan
cial troubles to the death of her moth
er, when other relatives and the legal
system forced her out of the family
home and into an apartment that she
couldn't afford. Unable to make the
rent in her apartment. White had to
sleep three nights outside before find
ing a spot at the Urban Ministry
homeless shelter, where she stayed
for four months. Now living in a sin
gle room occupancy in Palo Alto,
White looks back on her hard times
with dignity.
"I had to become homeless to find
myself, and now 1 know that I can
take care of myself. Homelessness is a
temporary thing, but the feelings it
brings up can stay with you."
White felt her art has given her the
confidence to put aside those fears.
An even greater happiness came
from letters she has received from her
twins indicating that this might be the
year they will return to the United
States. She told the story of a recent
day when she was sewing the costume
for one of her dolls and a butterfly
landed on her hand.
"It just rested there on my finger
for a few minutes," she said. "I truly
believe when something like that
happens, it is a sign of a person at
peace."
