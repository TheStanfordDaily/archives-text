## 
### Henry Buttocks Bitch Writer 
The Daily, having upset whiny let
ter-writing frosh, all the ASSU presi
dential candidates, The Stanford
Review, the state of Israel, and even
John Reider, has finally lost its last
friend in the whole world.
John Fairbrother, a resident of Los
Altos, has read and admired the Daily
for the past 20 years. Not anymore,
however.
"They misquoted me," explained
Fairbrother. "For instance, I didn't say
those last few words. The Daily just
made that up.
"Also, my last sentence didn't
begin with 'For instance,' it began with
'Those bastards.' They just keep putting
words into my mouth. Like these ones."
Without Fairbrother, The Daily is
now ignored by everybody. People
don't even care enough to spit on the
Daily office as they pass by.
"The Daily is filled with heartless,
exploitative, arrogant writers who only
like seeing orphans cry," Fairbrother
said. "That's what I've learned from this
experience."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
added, "I really think that Taxi is filled
with a bunch of really swell guys, I real
ly didn't want to have to do this." He
then looked out of his office window,
laughed a long, hollow laugh, clapped
his hands together and muttered,
"You're mine, you bitches, all mine."
