Poor taste and inaccuracy are only
to be expected of The Daily. However,
last Friday's cartoon, depicting members
of the Ku Klux Klan reading the Stan
ford Review, went beyond the pale.
The suggestion that the Ku Klux
Klan in any way endorses the middle
class extremism represented by The
Stanford Review is offensive in the
extreme. Caricaturing Klan members as
readers of such a despicable magazine is
simply unhelpful, unintelligent and plain
insulting. The poor Grand Dragon was
so upset he was reduced to tears.
Is this the best The Daily can do to

attack the Klan? Of course this sort of
thing is only to be expected of a campus
rife with politically-correct, multicultur
alist, and anotherlongword zealotry.
Further, your artist, "GD '98,"
propagated many myths that have been
forced onto the Klan by an ill-informed
and hostile liberal media.
For instance, although you wouldn't
know it from the cartoon, our pointy
hats have insignias on them. We spend a
lot of time embroidering them onto the
linen. It isn't easy and requires a lot of
concentration. It is typical that a left
wing artist would choose not to draw

anything that might represent all the
hard work and sewing skills that the
Klan enjoys. The poor Grand Dragon
was so upset he was reduced to tears.
Also, one of the Klan members in
the drawing had a pointy hat that had a
drooping point. This is simply ridiculous.
All of our pointy hats have special
wire frames on the inside that make it
impossible for such drooping to occur.
The Grand Dragon really likes nice
pointy points. When he saw the droop
ing hat in your cartoon, he was so upset
the poor man cried for hours.
Yet again The Daily demonstrates

its liberal bias, its ignorance, and its lack
of imagination. An apology would be
too much to expect, I suppose. Hasn't
the Klan taken enough abuse by now?
And as for the Grand Dragon, do you
really think it's big and tough to make a
defenseless man, whose only crime is a
love of wearing pointy hats and perpe
trating the odd lynching, cry?
