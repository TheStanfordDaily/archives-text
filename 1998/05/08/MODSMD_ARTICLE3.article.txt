### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
With her head full of random
facts about national parks, china
patterns of past American presi
dents and foods that begin with "Q,"
sophomore Mari Webel represent
ed Stanford at this year's Jeopardy!
College Championship.
Webel was one of 15 college stu
dents from schools across the nation
who qualified to participate in the
tournament. She spent part of her
spring break, March 22 and 23, film
ing for the show in Berkeley and
hanging out with the group of stu

dents who had been selected.
"It's not something 1 ever expect
ed to be doing," Webel said. "My
friends and I joked in high school
about trying out for the college tour
nament ... but it was crazy doing it."
Webel said that she prepared for
the game by playing Trivial Pursuit
with her friends, although the pro
ducers suggested that she watch old
episodes of ihe show. Many of the
other students seemed to be prepar
ing much more seriously â€” studying
lists of facts or reading intensely be
fore the taping.
