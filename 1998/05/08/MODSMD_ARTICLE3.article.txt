## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
With her head full of random
facts about national parks, china
patterns of past American presi
dents and foods that begin with "Q,"
sophomore Mari Webel represent
ed Stanford at this year's Jeopardy!
College Championship.
Webel was one of 15 college stu
dents from schools across the nation
who qualified to participate in the
tournament. She spent part of her
spring break, March 22 and 23, film
ing for the show in Berkeley and
hanging out with the group of stu

dents who had been selected.
"It's not something 1 ever expect
ed to be doing," Webel said. "My
friends and I joked in high school
about trying out for the college tour
nament ... but it was crazy doing it."
Webel said that she prepared for
the game by playing Trivial Pursuit
with her friends, although the pro
ducers suggested that she watch old
episodes of ihe show. Many of the
other students seemed to be prepar
ing much more seriously — studying
lists of facts or reading intensely be
fore the taping.
"A lot of other people had books
that they were studying from, but I
just had a lot of fun with it," Webel
said.
She was surprised at the lack of
competition among the students
who were involved. She said that
each of them felt that they were com
peting against the game, the pres
sure of being taped and the audience
— but not against each other.
"It was really a great group of
people, and it was so awesome to get
to spend the day with them," Webel
said. "I met some girls because we
were sequestered in the basement
for about six hours waiting to find
out who would get the wild card
slot."
The Bay Area had a strong show
ing at the event with a woman from
UC-Berkeley and a man from Santa
Clara University also in the tourna
ment. Webel said that at one point
during the taping, Berkeley students
began hissing at her, but the rivalry
was in good fun.
Other students were from schools
such as Brown University, Columbia
University. University of North Car
olina at Chapel Hill. Harvey-Mudd
College and Yale University. Dur
ing her round. Webel played against

students from the University of Illi
nois at Chicago and the University of
Alabama.
Webel participated in the Scholar
Bowl at her southern Illinois high
school and qualified with her team
for the national championships. She
is now a history major.
She is also an academic adviser at
Donner Hall and said she mentioned
the dorm during the"chat session"
with Alex Trebek.
"We didn't hang out with Alex,
but he was perfectly nice and actual
ly pretty funny," Webel said.
Jeopardy! has the right to use her
image now that she has been taped
for national television.
Webel mentioned that a friend
called her one night to tell her that
she had just seen her on a commer
cial.
"It's really crazy seeing yourself
on national television.... I can't wait
to see the game," she said.
Tonight, Webel will watch the
show with a group of friends on cam
pus (It airs at 7 p.m. on KGO, Chan
nel 27). Although she could not re
veal the outcome, she said that if she
qualified for the finalist round, it will
air sometime next week.
"It was definitely a production,"
Webel said. "I don't think that I
would ever try out for a game show
again because it was so hectic. But it
was also so much fun."
