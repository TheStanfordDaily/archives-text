With the words, "Shake hard
the conscience. ... Tell them what
is happening so that the conscience
might wake up," film maker Marty
Rosenbluth screened his film, "Is
rael: An Occupation Set in Stone?"
A crowd of 50 people attended
the screening last night. The film
documents the Israeli treatment of
Palestinians in the West Bank.
" The movie was very sad, but it
had truth to it. I don't think it was
biased," doctoral student Amr
Awadallah said.
The film highlights the system
atic removal of Palestinians from
East Jerusalem.
According to the film, before
1967, Palestinians owned and occu
pied 100 percent of the land in East
Jerusalem.
By 1995, they inhabited only 14
percent. The Israeli government
has designated the remaining land

as either a "green zone," where no
Palestinian can build, or as a Jewish
settlement.
Rosenbluth is a Jewish Ameri
can who spent seven-and-a-half
years in the West Bank. He grew up
in a Jewish family and was an active
Zionist.
"When I went to college and
started talking to Palestinians, my
whole image of Israel changed,"
Rosenbluth said. "Before that, I
had believed the common image
that Israel was a desert before the
Jews came. 1 realized that wasn't
true."
According to Rosenbluth, the
main reason for Israeli apathy is
that most Israelis don't believe
they are taking someone else's
land.
"I think a lot of Israelis don't see
[their] communities as settlements
in occupied territory."
He said that the movie "came
out of frustration" and the reality

that it was "impossible to get infor
mation out.
The American media didn't
want to air this," he said.
Rosenbluth's film has aired in
America on only a few PBS affili
ates.
Rosenbluth said the Israeli gov
ernment did not give him any trou
ble while he was making the film.
However, as soon as the film
aired, the situation between the
two parties changed.
"The mayor of Jerusalem called
up Uri Banashir (a film participant
who works in urban planning in
Jerusalem) and said to never talk to
the press again.
Nobody had told [Banashir] to
lie, so he got into trouble," Rosen
bluth said.
At the screening, people reacted
positively to the film. Rosenbluth
said most receptions have been
similar.
In addition to winning numer

ous awards, such as the Charleston
Film Festival award for best politi
cal documentary, Rosenbluth's
film has also received high praise
and even some awards from Jewish
film festivals.
According to Rosenbluth, he
experienced few problems living as
a Jew in the West Bank.
When these occurred, the ma
jority of his neighborhood sided
with him. The Israelis, however,
harassed him at airports and inter
rogated him before allowing him to
leave.
Rosenbluth said he believed a
solution would come only when
more countries begin to criticize
the Israeli policy on Palestine.
"What I hope will happen is that
the European community and
powers other than the United
States will put pressure on Israel to
reach a true peace and give both
groups their rights," Rosenbluth
said.
