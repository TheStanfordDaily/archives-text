### Kelly Young Editorial staff 
The voice that brings late-night
news to millions of Americans will
be one that outgoing seniors will
remember for a long time.
ABC News' "Nightline" anchor
Ted Koppel has been announced
as this year's Commencement
speaker.

"I'm looking forward to it,"
Koppel said. "I feel especially
honored and privileged. There's
no way I'm going to turn down an
opportunity to come back here."
The Senior Class presidents dis
tributed a survey to seniors via e
mail fall quarter asking their rec
ommendations for a speaker.
According to the presidents. Kop
pel. Class of '62. was among those
at the top of the list.
"All of the seniors we've talked
to are really excited about it." said
Senior Class President Laudan
Nabizadeh. "1 think he's a very
respected person. We've all grown
up watching him every night on
TV."
University President Gerhard
Casper has been equally enthusi
astic about this year's speaker.
"I am delighted that we have
been able to secure Ted Koppel as
our Commencement speaker,"
Casper said. "He unites the desire of
students to have a nationally known
individual, my desire to have a
speaker with Stanford ties and the
desire of us all to have a speaker of
both substance and style "
Koppel was born in Lancashire,
England in 1940. He moved with
his parents to New York when he
was 13 and excelled in boarding
school. He began his undergradu
ate years at Syracuse University
when he was 16.
Koppel was unfamiliar with
Stanford until his adviser at Syra
cuse told him that Stanford had a

solid program in mass communica
tions research.
"Where and what is Stanford?"
Koppel asked.
"He told me it was in Califor
nia. and that was all I needed to
hear."
Koppel went on to receive his
master's in mass communications
research and political science from
Stanford. He wrote his disserta
tion on the trials of Adolph Eich
mann. a Nazi war criminal.
Koppel biked to class his first
year because he was unable to
receive car insurance until he was
21. He lived in a house with five
other g r aduate students in Red
wood City, so the trek to and from
class sometimes proved strenuous.
If he forgot something at home, he
sometimes wound up biking 30
miles per day.
Koppel said he also had more
pleasant memories of campus.
"I met my future wife there,"
he said. "She and I met in Septem
ber 1960 and married three years
later."
Koppel and his wife, Grace
Anne, return to campus to "look
at the old haunts .. . Hoo Tow and
Mem Chu" when business calls
him to the West Coast.
"It always improves with age
and distance." Koppel said.
"That's our youth we left behind
on campus."
After Stanford, Koppel began
his career in radio and switched to
television in 1963 when ABC
News hired him as their full-time
general assignment correspondent
in New York.
Later, he covered the Vietnam
