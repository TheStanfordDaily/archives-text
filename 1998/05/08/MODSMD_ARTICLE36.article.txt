From El Nino floodwaters to
men's basketball reaching the
Final Four, seniors had no lack
of excitement as their time at
Stan ford came to a close.
The onset
Two hundred fifty members of
the media barraged the Universi
ty as the presidential family
brought its only daughtei to cam

first appearance at Stanford.
The Class of 2(X)1 had an expe

study that concluded there was
no way to continue the tradition
without harming the tiger sala
mander. an endangered species
that lives in the lake bed.
The 100 th Big Game had to

Arrillaga Amphitheater.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal

21-20. snapping a five-game los
