# A 						year in review

From El Nino floodwaters to
men's basketball reaching the
Final Four, seniors had no lack
of excitement as their time at
Stan ford came to a close.
The onset
Two hundred fifty members of
the media barraged the Universi
ty as the presidential family
brought its only daughtei to cam
pus. It was President Clinton's
first appearance at Stanford.
The Class of 2(X)1 had an expe
rience like no other, having to
pass through metal detectors and
wear special badges to see Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's Convocation.
Expanded streets
Stanford emerged victorious
in the Sand Hill Road battle
when voters on November 4
approved its Measure O. giving it
permission to expand Sand Hill
and Ouarn Roads to four lanes
within Palo Alto city limits and
extend them both to El Camino
Real.
The I niversitv will now spend
$342 million o\er five years to
implement its plan, which
includes building 1.100 units of
housing for senior citizens, facul
ty and staff along Sand Hill. It

also has plans tor expanding the
Stanford Shopping Center by
S().(KM) square feet.
Smoke and ashes
A hallmark of the Big Game
since its inception in the early
IWH)s. the Lake Lagunita bonfire
was given the ax this fall for the
fifth straight year. The cancella
tion came on the heels of a recent
study that concluded there was
no way to continue the tradition
without harming the tiger sala
mander. an endangered species
that lives in the lake bed.
The 100 th Big Game had to
settle for a 4-cubic foot version in
Arrillaga Amphitheater.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal
football team defeated UC-
Berkeley by a narrow margin of
21-20. snapping a five-game los
ing streak before a sellout crowd
of 85.000 at Stanford Stadium.
Tenure denied
Asst. History Prof. Karen
Sawislak filed her first grievance
in early October protesting her
tenure denial at the deans' level
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences. The History Depart
ment had voted nearlv unani
mously to tenure Sawislak, a spe
cialist in American labor history.
After both Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven and
Provost Condoleezza Rice
declined to reverse the decision on
Sawislak's appeals, she filed
another one to Casper and the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council for a final review of her
case in April.
"1 have no doubt that she
should have gotten tenure," said
History Prof. George Frcdrickson.
"She has a very strong case."
Her tenure denials and rejected
appeals spurred student mobiliza
tion across campus, and more than
100 protesters marched in White
Plaza in April to protest the lack of

faculty diversity on campus.
Flood fun
El Nino left the campus reeling
in early February, Hooding streets
and University buildings. The Row
became a water park as students
rafted down Campus Drive on
mattresses and rolled down slip
pery slopes in garbage cans.
Classes and midterms were can
celed as students, faculty and
administrators fought to recover
from the water damage. Green
Library, Jonsson Library of Gov
ernment Documents, Cubberley
Auditorium and Braun Music
Center were submerged in up to 2
feet of water.
Hundreds of student volunteers
showed up in the middle of the
night to help in the Green Library
rescue efforts. By 11:30 a.m., a
total of 3,000 boxes of materials

had been moved to higher ground.
"It was very gratifying to see;
the University was in a time of
need ... and students rallied to
help," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais.
However, the flooding still
damaged 120,000 books from
Green — most of which have been
saved using a freeze-drying pro
cess — and 10,000 recordings at
the Braun Archive of Recorded
Sound.
Double Nobel
Business Prof. Emeritus Myron
Scholes was awarded the 1997
Nobel Memorial Prize in Econom
ic Sciences in October for his role
in the development of a widely
applied pricing formula for
options.
Physics and Applied Physics
Prof. Steve Chu raised the number


of this year's winners to two when
he won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
This is Stanford's third physics
Nobel Prize in three years. Chu
won it for devising a method for
trapping and cooling atoms that
allows them to be studied more
closely.
"I'm really not a great physi
cist." Chu said. "I'm the same guy
I was yesterday."
Greek revisited
Residential Education Director
Jane Camarillo announced in
March that the Delta Delta Delta
and Kappa Alpha Theta sororities
would be housed in ATO and
Alpha Sigma, respectively.
This was a marked victory for
those who had fought for the

return of sorority housing after 56
years. However, it was a significant
loss for those in the Alpha Sig
community, and a huge uproar
immediately followed. Protests
and petitions were filed, charging
that the administration had not
done enough to solicit student
input in deciding which houses
would go to sororities.
A bittersweet farewell was bid
to Alpha Sig's last Exotic Erotic
Ball, where hundreds of scantily
clad partygoers went to experience
the debauchery honored in Rolling
Stone magazine as one of the top
college parties in the nation.
NCAA madness
Men's and women's swimming,
women's volleyball and men's

cross country captured NCAA
championship titles earlier in the
year, putting Stanford in a good
position to surpass the record-set
ting six titles it won last year. Car
dinal fans across the nation
watched the men's basketball team
compete over spring break, reach
ing as far as the Final Four in San
Antonio, Texas. March Madness
was sweeter than ever. After
defeating Rhode Island in over
time, juniors Arthur Lee and Mark
"Mad Dog" Madsen were the new
Cardinal heroes.
The women's basketball team
suffered unfortunate circum
stances, namely knee injuries
which put out two of its star play


ers, forwards Vanessa Nygaard
and Kristin Folkl. They lost in the
first round of NCAA competition
against Harvard. Nonetheless, the
strength of this year's class is
unprecedented in Stanford histo
ry-
Five seniors were drafted by
the ABL and WNBA: Folkl.

Naomi Mulitauaopele, Nygaard,
Heather Owen and Olympia
Scott. This quintet went 113-14
overall, won four Pacific 10 Con
ference titles and participated in
three consecutive Final Fours.
More than 200 points ahead of
any of its competitors — and with
top-ranked baseball and tennis
teams — Stanford is looking to
win the Sears Cup for the fourth
vear in a row.
