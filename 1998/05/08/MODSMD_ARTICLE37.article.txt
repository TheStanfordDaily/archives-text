# Graduating from the college of the 'real world'
## 
### 
To those who won't graduate this
year ... I refuse to say it. You
already know that your time at
Stanford is short and that you
should take advantage of it while
you can. Blah, blah, blah. It's all oft
repeated old news. You know it
already. You live it.
F-very day. you explore another
library, thinking. "Golly dang. I sure
am lucky. I sure am fortunate!"
Then you do all or most of your
homework and get good grades.
You're taking two pretty hard class
es instead of just one. Your signifi
cant other seems to like you a whole
lot, and I bet you seem to like him or

her. too. You have leadership posi
tions in several campus organiza
tions. Late nights, after you've wan
dered around your department or
some library you've sneaked into,
you like to masturbate in random
places or write graffiti on the walls.
Damn, you're happy. And it's no
wonder. Your subversions are
small, and you generally do the right
thing.
Here's some much-needed, and
ncvcr-asked-for advice: quit it.
I have taken advantage of almost
every resource I could at this well
endowed school, and now that I am
about to leave campus for the final

time. 1 feel empty and closed off.
Pretty as my resume and diploma
are. the\ re still just sheets of paper.
1 am 22 years old, my life is
stretched before me. and I am still
not sure who I'm supposed to hug at

graduation. For all of my haro work

in the libraries and in various posi
tions given to me by Residential
Education. I am leaving this sehix>l
almost .is nameless and unconnect
ed as I always was. None of the rea
sons matter. Problems, shmoblems.
Instead of working things out. I
chose to wallow in self-pity, my
classes or extra-currics as it suited
me. 1 moved from each bad situa
tion to a worse one until all I could
do was watch, unsure if I was being
hilarious or depressing. Probably a
bit of both. When I leave here,
someone might wave goodbye.
I've spent most of my Stanford
experience observing with tunnel

\ision. Each da\ was a succession of
tasks that had to be done. And each
task 1 completed or missed was a
notch on the belt that was my anal
notebook. Don't ask me about
fountain-hopping, cause I have
never done it. What's "the Dish?" I
didn't discover pear cider until late
la>t year, and I can point to almost
no one that I will stay in contact
with post-graduation. I don't know
where Alpha Sig is. I've never been
to Miyake's. I dunno San Francisco
from San Luis Obispo, hut I can tell
you how to get a campus job that
pays no less than $10 an hour.
I can tell you all about yourself in

disparaging terms, and why you are
superior to me. But don't ask me
how to interact, because I cannot
tell you nght now. All my learning
has been on my own. 1 can tell you
how to fund your campus organiza
tion. 1 can tell you how to start
almost any substantial project.
These are things I've done. I've
learned more about how campus
works than how to work with those
who make the campus work. I've
learned to interact with the build
ings.
1 will leave here quietly and will


Nkomo
Morris
inglv. Next year, a couple of people
might notice a gap where I am not.
Maybe they will drop an e-mail in
my direction. I will leave this cam
pus as silently as the pre-adolescents
who rollarblade here on weekends.
I may run into a few people in a bar
bv accident in several years, but I
doubt they will say hello.
No matter.
This is not a sad story. Life is
wonderful. 1 actually made friends
this year.
I am gifted in a bunch of ways,
and there are those who love me.
However, these things are only true

when I remember, and I have spent
so much time forgetting.
I've confused the buildings on
campus with the people inside them,
and my teachers with the classes
they teach. I've wasted my time here
trying too hard to take advantage,
and now I'm lost. I've spent four
years of lost time.
But don't cry for me, Lagunita,
Yost, Florence Moore, Toyon. The
trick is that I've realized my mis
take. It's a bit late, but I am still in
my 2()s. The world is my college
now. and when the real graduation
comes, people will clamber to kiss
me goodbye.
