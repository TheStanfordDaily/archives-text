# Samuel Park
## An extraodinarily typical four years 
### 
Perhaps because I am an RA liv
ing in a dorm with 177 freshmen,
sometimes 1 find myself looking at
Stanford as if I'd just gotten here. 1
bike excitedly past palm trees,
green lawns and splashy fountains.
I gawk at the bold and the beauti
ful.
I enjoy the kinetic motion of
other bikes swooshing past me,
arches in the Quad angling closer
with every push of the pedal,
columns edging nearer like film
strip.
Have I died and gone to Par
adise? My Paradise, of course,
entails writing essays on topics like
Dickens and finding nostalgia in a
beat-up computer, listening to John
Coltrane and sipping Coke like it's

rum. I go for some coffee later and
chat with friends about our current
crushes and the state of everyone's
hearts.
A typical day in my life feels sur
real, almost absurd. I wake up late,
have a stimulating breakfast / lunch
with my frosh, maybe laze around
in the lounge and listen to the
nationally-ranked pianist perform a
piece.
Then I bike to class, where I'm
dazzled by a brilliant lecture by a
renowned Shakespeare scholar. I
smile. Later, I read a short story sit
ting by the Oval or on the lawn,
under a tree. Friends walk by and
say hello; I talk to one or two. I
smile some more.
Then at night maybe Camille

Paglia or Gloria Steinem is speak
ing and I get my mind warped, chal
lenged, roused by them. Or perhaps
1 go see a play or go book-shopping
in San Francisco or just spend the
night watching videos with a good
friend. Either way, there's mental
stimulation, novelty and excite
ment.
A typical day has much to give:
People who are glad to see you and
whose presence you enjoy. Profes
sors who respect you and like your
work. Books that offer some of the
answers for your many, many ques
tions.
But of course, Stanford's not
really Paradise. I've done my share
of crying, feeling frustrated, being
lonely. But I've learned a lot about

happiness and I know to be happy
now in a way I didn't know coming
in as a freshman.
1 feel like 1 and my sense of who
1 am has changed dramatically over
the past four years. Last year, for
instance, living on the Row, I led a
fantasy glamorous existence as
magazine editor, theater director /
playwright and television producer,
each in a different quarter. Then
this year I realized a lot of things:
my selfishness, my need to have
"roles" in order to maintain my
self-esteem, and my lack of touch
with real life's problems. Yes, I'd
gotten a lot from Stanford, but had
1 given anything back?
This year as an RA, I started
doing that. I listened to people cry.

laugh, share and open up. And I
felt like everything I'd done before
— my writing, my editing, my aca
demic work — was not as satisfying
as being in the world of people. I
learned how much I could learn
from people, how much I had yet to
grow.
1 learned the emptiness of status,
the pitfalls of "power," the shallow
ness of recognition. And above all.
I learned that giving things to peo
ple, like my time, attention and
interest, was much more fulfilling
than hoarding those to myself.
Some of my happiest memories
will come from very simple things:
Yelling my frosh's names on a
microphone as they arrived in
Branner and later fountain-hop

ping and rollerblading with them
Taking one of my frosh to get so mi
Jamba Juice after she had a terri
ble. terrible day. Giving a buddinj
playwright some tips on construct
ing a plot. Sharing hugs, throwinj
kisses. Yes. I wax sentimental: thi
is prose that might get me in trou
ble with the Attitude Police.
But the point is. I am much hap
pier sharing my time with othei
people than when 1 was concentrat
ing exclusively on my own interests
like play writing or writing papers.
Of course. I'll always have tirm
for myself and write, but I hope t(
keep in mind that I need to givt
myself up sometimes, to other peo

pie, other lives. I used to think the
highlights of my Stanford career
would have to do with theater. But
no, it has to do with people. Again,
I get sentimental.
But sentimental or not, I know
I'll appreciate what Stanford has
taught me. And it has taught me to
seek my own happiness.
I refuse to borrow conventional
ideals of what a good life entails; I
reject the notion that you need a
glamorous job, an attractive lover
and a healthy cash tlow in order to
be happy.
Perhaps we all have a different

happiness to pursue, and there is
no point in being unhappy, because
we don't have something that we
never really needed in the first
place.
Happiness for me is no longer
about getting that piece in The
New Yorker, or winning a plum
teaching job at an Ivy League Uni
versity, or becoming a well-known
playwright. Happiness, shy with the
smile of a child, has become other
people.
For what else is in the world?
Stanford is suddenly a wonderful
bunch of first names: That's all and
yet it feels like everything.
