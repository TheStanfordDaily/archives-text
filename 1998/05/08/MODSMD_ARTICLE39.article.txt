## Stanford an irreplaceable experience 
### 
What a ride it has been. What a
thrilling, challenging, intimidating,
hut always exhilarating experience.
One which began years ago with a
letter that was our ticket. The
acceptance to four fun-filled years
of what have been called "the best
days of your life."
None of us truly knew what it
would be like, but we were proud,
nervous and elated to say. "I'm
going to Stanford!"
Looking back at that freshman
book gives any senior a little flavor
of where they have been, where
they have traveled and where they
have come from. Stanford has
taken most of its seniors and done
a miraculous thing: made them sad

they were going to have to leave
The Farm.
Nonetheless, we should give
thanks to Leland. We should be
grateful because Stanford gave
each individual donning their cap
and gown this June 14 a precious
gift. Not just the sprawling 8.800-
acre campus, not just the top-notch
teachers, not just the prestige, but
all of the little things in between
that is what we will remember
years from now.
The memories that made Stan
ford an irreplaceable experience in
our lives.
Crazy freshman RAs that made
all feel safe on a new, intimidating
campus. Running with the Band.

Walking everywhere in groups of
14 or more, standing in the Quad
and trying to jump at the right time
to "Alright Now." Your first room
mate. Full Moon on the Quad,
both times.
A first bike accident, then your
second. (The average student
encounters three in their fours
years on the Farm.)
Standing in line for books,
watching bizarre events in White
Plaza, studying, but not really, in
the Co Ho.
Big Game, boat dances, e-mail,
CIV. the Core, CSIOS and other
classes that took over your life.
Hoo Tow, your Pro Fro, Mem
Chu, and Fro Yo at the Co Po. The

sophomore slump, the unpre
ferred housing year, fountain
jumping, the first day on campus
as a senior.
Perhaps after our time on the
Farm we are more mature, wiser,
and a little more ready to conquer
the world. But we may also be a lit
tle jealous.
Jealous of our younger Stanford
peers who have more time to work,
play and soak in everything that is
Stanford.
How most of us would long to
be back in our younger Stanford
days where we just wanted to finish
our CIV paper so we could go to
Flicks.
While our time to forge new

paths beyond the confines of Palm
Drive has come, we need not be
sad that there will be no more
White Plaza hangs, lines at the post
office or registering on Axess.
Because we have a new gift from
Stanford; and this time it is our
ticket out.
While scary, it too is something we
should meet with great elation,
pride and triumph.
And for those not ready to leave
the Farm, fear not; once a Stanford
student, always a Stanford student.
As generations come and go, as
the Farm shifts and changes, we
are all still Stanford. My grandfa
ther, Class of 1943, still tells me,
"Hillary, Stanford never leaves

you." He is just as Stanford as me,
as indicated by the end of his let
ters, where he writes, "P.S. "Beat
Cal.'"
While it is difficult to sum up
the sentiments, experiences, tri
umphs and tribulations of the Class
of IWB, we can all take joy in that
no matter where we go or what we
choose to do, no one can take away
that which in our lives is forever:
Stanford. May you all remember
the place that gave you the spirit to
be so excited on June 14 â€” that
you were once and always, a part
of it.
