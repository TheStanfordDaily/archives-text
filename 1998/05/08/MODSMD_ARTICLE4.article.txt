# Shoven leaves mixed legacy
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
John Shoven's five years as dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences have been anything but
uneventful.
University President Gerhard
Casper chose the economics pro
fessor — who will resume his
teaching and research duties at the
end of this year — to head Stan
ford's most academically diverse
school in the midst of heavy budget
cuts. Shoven leaves as the Univer
sity has recovered, allowing the
creation of new programs as well as
an examination of existing ones.
But although the school has
strengthened its focus on ethnic
studies, undergraduate education
and the humanities under his guid
ance, Shoven's tenure has not been
without its controversy.
As he leaves office, many at
Stanford will remember him for re
cent controversial tenure deci
sions, while others claim he has
weakened the University's com
mitment to affirmative action.
Such complaints go with the terri
tory, Shoven said.
Overall, "it's been a very good
experience," he said. "Things are
going extremely well for the
school."
Expansion
In the months after Casper be
came Stanford's ninth president in
1992, committees dealt with a flur
ry of appointments. Shoven's selec
tion to replace outgoing Humani
ties and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas came at virtually the same

time as Casper
announced his
choice of a new
provost, Con
doleezza Rice.
Rice
spent her early
years in office
charting the
University's

course through a series of lis most
harsh budget cuts ever. In a highly
controversial money-saving move,
she eliminated a position hold by
Cecilia Burciaga, at the time Stan
ford's highest-ranking Chicana ad
ministrator.
As a result, hundreds of stu
dents participating in a hunger
strike and series of protests in the
spring of 1994 demanding, among
other things, a Chicano studies pro
gram. Concurrent protests for
Asian American studies led to a
year of intense committee work. at
the end of which Shoven an
nounced the Program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
That program has pushed Stan
ford to the forefront of American
universities, most notably in its in
terdisciplinary approach to the
field. Casper also provided funding
for the Center for Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
.which has accepted President Clin
ton's call to open a national dia
logue on race by sponsoring a se
ries of conferences and speeches.
"Stanford must be one of the
only universities that's really excit
ed about the ethnic studies pro
gram," Shoven said.


Shoven
He added that such a successful
program will most likely expand.
C'SRE currently has 50 majors.
CSRE Program Director Al Ca
marillo credits Shoven with staying
behind the program.
"He was extremely supportive
both in its concept and in its imple
mentation." Camarillo said. "1
think thi»t he saw this as an impor
tant development for our under
graduate studies and for intellectu
al interests among faculty and grad
uate students."
Developments in undergradu
ate studies have formed the core of
much of Shoven's legacy as dean.
Under his guidance, divisions of
Humanities and Sciences have in
stituted an undergraduate minor,
restructured the Cultures, Ideas
and Values Program, provided sup
port for stronger language and
writing requirements, and spon
sored the majority of Stanford's
new freshman and sophomore
seminars.
Shoven himself taught a fresh
man seminar on Social Security
policy during winter quarter, a sort
of warmup for his return to the
classroom that he called "probably
the best teaching experience of mv
life."
Fhe institution of the minor is
something of a personal triumph
for Shoven, a physics major who
minored in economics and turned
the latter into a career.
Despite concerns that the mi
nors might lead to the demise of
small departments that depended
on double majors. Shoven said he
thinks they have strengthened the
school as a whole. Students with
double majors often are spread too
thin, he explained, and minors
allow departments to expand the
requirements for their majors.
"I think that's going to be a plus
for the curriculum." he said of the
program.
"It's in the students' best inter
est."

Budget ebbs and flows
Also in the students' best inter
est is the booming economy, which
has allowed Stanford to climb out
of its lean years and hire additional
professors, as well as making more
overall hires from among tenured
ranks around the country.
The tight budget upon his ar
rival in IW3 meant he could hire
only assistant professors, Shoven
explained.
But within the past year, Casper
lias allocated funding for four more
professorships in the humanities.
In addition, a freer flow of money
lias allowed Stanford to compete
for "star" professors with other
elite universities.
"Appointments of the last cou
ple yeai s have been particularly ex
citing." Shoven said, adding that in
his 25 years at Stanford, now is "the
best hiring we've done in an awful
ly long time. ... These are good
times."
Hiring professors on the
tenured level means hiring fewer
assistant professors, however, and
Shoven's deanship has been
marred by criticisms that young
professors are not supported and
later fail to win tenure.
Shoven counters that while the
tenure-level hirings are essential to
maintain Stanford's excellence, he
wouldn't want the demographics of
the school to shift too dramatically.
"We want to continue to hire
some of the best young people." he
said.
During the two years, Shoven
has denied tenure to some of whom
many consider the "best young
people." leading to the most wide
spread criticism of his role. Stu
dents and faculty alike have
launched a series of protests aimed
at Shoven's denial of tenure to
Akhil Gupta in anthropology and
Karen Sawislak in history.
Gupta — who focused his re
search on gender issues in South
Asia — eventually won tenure on
appeal to the provost, while the
case of Sawislak — an American
labor historian — is currently being

reviewed for its final chance before
the Advisory Board of the Acade
mic Council.
Shoven has been the focus of
much of the outcry, as he denied
tenure to a woman and a minority
in non-traditional fields, each of
whom was approved unanimously
for tenure at the departmental
level.
In a report released in Febru
ary. the Women's Coalition for
Gender Equity argued that Shoven
has erased the gains made by his
predecessor. Psychology Prof.
Thomas.
This uproar is "understand
able." Shoven said, as "the stakes
are extraordinarily high" in tenure
cases.
Hut he urged an examination of
his five-year record rather than
looking at appointments and pro
motions on a yearly basis.
One year is "just too short a pe
riod to get a fair assessment." he
said, adding that overall he believes
"women and men have been about
equally successful [and there has
been] no adverse pattern with re
spect to minorities."
"I am comfortable that we have
applied consistently fair standards
case by case by case." he said.
Shoven added that as a school
encompassing 28 departments. Hu
manities and Sciences is always hir
ing and promoting.
"It's simply not true that most of
these decisions are controversial,"
he said.
He also came under fire for the
1996 closure of the Food Research
Institute, whose work he felt was
duplicated elsewhere, including the
Economics Department and Grad
uate School of Business.
But Shoven also took responsi
bility for the Program in Science,
Technology and Society, which the
University threatened to axe in
19% due to lack of faculty support
for it in the School of Engineering.
The program has flourished in its
new home.
Thomas said he admired
Shoven's strength in the face of
criticism.

"I admire the courage with
which he attacked some fundamen
tal projects, like which department
should be closed or which depart
ments he should be thinking of,"
Thomas said. "One can have confi
dence that the school was in good
hands."
Moving on
Although Shoven says he's not
offended by the charges made
against him as dean, he is neverthe
less looking forward to spending
more time with his family and on
teaching and research during the
coming years.
He will spend next year on sab
batical and working at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behav
ioral Sciences, after which he in
tends to focus his energies on re
search into Social Security, pen
sions and investments.
The Social Security research is
especially exciting, he said, as Clin
ton has named that a top priority
for the country.
During his five years as dean,
Shoven has continued to work with
graduate students, which he said
will ease the transition back into a
professor's life.
He also hopes to teach an un
dergraduate course on invest
ments, perhaps in addition to Eco
nomics 1. Part of the next year, he
said, will be spent refining his old
notes and updating the courses.
As he moves on, Shoven has no
doubt that the School of Humani
ties and Sciences will remain
strong, as will the University as a
whole.
Stanford right now is "as well
positioned as any other university"
in the country, he said. "I don't see
anybody gaining on us right at the
moment."
The biggest challenge will be to
maintain excellence over such a
broad range of areas.
"We're trying hard not to spe
cialize — we're trying to be good at
everything," Shoven said. "That's
just flat out hard."
