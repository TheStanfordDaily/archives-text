# Shoven leaves mixed legacy
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
John Shoven's five years as dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences have been anything but
uneventful.
University President Gerhard
Casper chose the economics pro
fessor — who will resume his
teaching and research duties at the
end of this year — to head Stan
ford's most academically diverse
school in the midst of heavy budget
cuts. Shoven leaves as the Univer
sity has recovered, allowing the
creation of new programs as well as
an examination of existing ones.
But although the school has
strengthened its focus on ethnic
studies, undergraduate education
and the humanities under his guid
ance, Shoven's tenure has not been
without its controversy.
As he leaves office, many at
Stanford will remember him for re
cent controversial tenure deci
sions, while others claim he has
weakened the University's com
mitment to affirmative action.
Such complaints go with the terri
tory, Shoven said.
Overall, "it's been a very good
experience," he said. "Things are
going extremely well for the
school."
Expansion
In the months after Casper be
came Stanford's ninth president in
1992, committees dealt with a flur
ry of appointments. Shoven's selec
tion to replace outgoing Humani
ties and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas came at virtually the same

time as Casper
announced his
choice of a new
provost, Con
doleezza Rice.
Rice
spent her early
years in office
charting the
University's

course through a series of lis most
harsh budget cuts ever. In a highly
controversial money-saving move,
she eliminated a position hold by
Cecilia Burciaga, at the time Stan
ford's highest-ranking Chicana ad
ministrator.
As a result, hundreds of stu
dents participating in a hunger
strike and series of protests in the
spring of 1994 demanding, among
other things, a Chicano studies pro
gram. Concurrent protests for
Asian American studies led to a
year of intense committee work. at
the end of which Shoven an
nounced the Program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
That program has pushed Stan
ford to the forefront of American
universities, most notably in its in
terdisciplinary approach to the
field. Casper also provided funding
for the Center for Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
.which has accepted President Clin
ton's call to open a national dia
logue on race by sponsoring a se
ries of conferences and speeches.
"Stanford must be one of the
only universities that's really excit
ed about the ethnic studies pro
gram," Shoven said.
