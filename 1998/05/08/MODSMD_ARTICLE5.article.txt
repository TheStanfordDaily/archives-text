### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
In an effort to reflect sculptor Auguste RixJins orig
inal vision, the Stanford Art Museum has begun recon
figuring the six "Burghers of Calais" statues.
The project is scheduled to be completed by June 14.
Four of the six statues were previously displayed in
Memorial Court, a fifth was stationed in the Lane His
tory Court and the sixth was in the Rodin Sculpture
Garden. The six will now be gathered together in
Memorial Court.
We will use a scheme (Rodin] had for the
'Burghers/ and will install them the way that he want
ed them to be installed in the town of Calais itself," said
Tom Seligman, director of the museum, which w ill soon
be renamed the Cantor Centor for Visual Arts. "We
have six individual figures that do not share a base, so
we will align them in the same orientation to each other
as some other versions of the sculptures that have the
same casting base."
Seligman noted that the new configuration will still
allow visitors to pass between the individual statues.
Bids are still being accepted for parts of the project,
which is headed by the museum's chief curator,
Bernard Barryte. Seligman estimated that the total cost
will be between $40.(MK) and $50.(HX). receiving ttttC
support from the President's Fund.
Each of the life-size bronze statues will receive a
new base in an on-campus location. New footings for
the statues will be made from cobblestones purchased
from the City of San Francisco.
"The city has a whole stockyard of the things that
they use for paving their streets." Seligman said.
Auguste Rodin designed the statues as
a memorial to six 14th-century citizens of the French
city of Calais. Each statue depicts an identified, historic
