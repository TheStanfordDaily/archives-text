(Mercedes and Chrysler merge
LONDON (AF) — The parent of Mercedes
-Benz agreed to buy Chrysler Corp. for more than
-$37 billion yesterday in a deal the two companies
see as a way to sell more cars around the world
rather than an opportunity to cut jobs and close fac
" tories.
Dealerships aren't to be combined and assembly
lines are supposed to be left alone. And so shoppers
won't see Mercedes Grand Cherokees in show
rooms and Dodge Neon factories won't be churn
. ing out E-Class luxury cars.
"We will keep the brands totally separate,"
Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen Schrempp said at
a London news conference.
Based on last year's car sales figures, the new
company, to be called DaimlerChrysler, would
rank fifth in the world.
'Unknown' soldier to be exhumed
• WASHINGTON (AF) — Fourteen years after
President Reagan presided over the burial of a
Vietnam veteran in the Tomb of the Unknowns,
the remains will be exhumed to see if they can be
identified after all.
Relatives of Air Force Ist Lt. Michael J. Blassie,
*.a missing Vietnam War pilot, requested the
*" remains be exhumed for possible identification in
"the hope modern and sophisticated forensics tech
niques can help identify him.
Goodbye, Geraldo
NEW YORK (AF) — For the 2.163 rd and last
episode of his daytime talk show. Geraldo Rivera
brought back a chair he'd like to forget.
It was the one a white supremacist used in 198K
to conk Rivera over the head, breaking his nose
and setting a standard for daytime TV debauchery
at a time when Jerry Springer was just another
washed-up politician.
A subdued Rivera rolled footage of that melee
pointing out where he managed to get in a punch
after being hit — during an emotional taping of his
final show yesterday. He agreed to leave daytime
TV behind to take on a larger role at NBC News.
