# Voter reg not focus
## Political groups waiting until fall 
### Erica Platt 
The deadline to register to vote
in the June 2 primary election has
passed and with it, the opportuni
ties for campus political organiza
tions to register students.
While groups like the Stanford
Democrats have actively cam
paigned to register students in the
past, there has been little action
this quarter.
"In the 19% national election,
the Stanford Democrats registered
more than 1,(X)() students," said
sophomore Tom Soule, director of
administrative affairs for Stanford
Democrats.
"In the coming weeks, we'll be
talking about the November 1998
elections."
Turnout among college-age vot
ers traditionally is low in both na
tional and primary elections. But
the recent lack of registration dri
ves on campus cannot be attributed
to apathy on the part of political or
ganizing groups.
"Partisan organizations like the
Stanford Republicans and Democ
rats are just as involved as ever,
and these groups aren't overly con
cerned that the deadline to register
for the primary has passed," ex
plained junior Steve Macias, a
member of Stanford Democrats.
"They shouldn't be. The focus is
usually on the fall elections — reg
istering incoming freshmen and re
registering upperclassmen who
have changed rooms and address
es."
Sophomore Scott Neuman of
the Republican Youth Majority
agreed.
"This campus is so large that it's
more effective to focus on the gen
eral elections," he said. "Plus, our
group focuses more time and ener
gy on individual candidates and
campaigns."
The primary systen. itself may
have complicated efforts to get stu
dents out to the polls.
"Even though I have voted in
every election since I was 18 —
local through national — I am frus
trated at having to vote in the open
primary this June," sophomore
Jason Mendelson said. "I voted
against the open primary system,
and 1 believe it just furthers voter
confusion."
Senior Julie Johnson, chair of
Stanford in Government, doesn't
see a lack of student interest in vot
ing and the political process.
"A lot of people worry about
registering away from home," she
said.
"It makes sense to register in the
place where you go to college, but
you can also get an absentee ballot.
Stanford students don't necessarily
know more about their hometown
governments than they do about
the politics of Palo Alto."
"The most important thing is to
vote and get involved at any level.
But for most students, visible na
tional issues make national elec
tions appear more important than
the upcoming primary."
Still, some unregistered stu
dents see the recent lack of campus
registration drives as a missed op
portunity.
"I haven't registered at school
or back home yet." said freshman
Gina Martinez. "If I had seen or
heard about any groups trying to
register people. I would definitely
have signed up."
