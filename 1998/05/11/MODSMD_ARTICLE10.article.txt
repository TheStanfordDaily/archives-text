Tobacco revenues disputed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican strategists yesterday
accused Congress' leading tobacco bill of underestimating by hun
dreds of billions of dollars how much it would earn for the federal gov
ernment.
Their analysis bolsters critics of the legislation, who have labeled it
a "big government" move that puts too much money into federal cof
fers.
The Republican Policy Committee said the bill, overwhelmingly
approved by the Senate Commerce Committee, would bring in $755
billion to $869 billion over 25 years.
The bill's backers, including chief sponsor Sen. John McCain, R-
Ariand the White House budget office estimated the bill would
raise $516 billion in cigarette taxes and industry payments.
The new estimate adds in adjustments for inflation and-penalties
tobacco companies face if they do not meet goals for reducing teen
smoking.
Supporters of the bill responded that the new estimate was just
part of a "numbers game" as the Senate prepares to debate the issue.
McCain's measure is the only tobacco bill to have passed a committee
and is headed to the Senate floor next Monday.
Don't cry for Seinfeld
WASHINGTON (Al') — Fans may shed some tears, but don't
expect a deluge when the cast of "Seinfeld" signs off this Thursday.
A new survey by the Pew Research Center finds that only half the
people who watch the popular sitcom will miss it when it ends its run.
Of the 1 ,(X)9 adults interviewed by phone for the survey, 62 percent
said they watch the program and 14 percent named the show as their
favorite. But only 19 percent said they will miss the show a great deal
and 51 percent of viewers say they won't miss the show much.
Other findings of the survey:
• Of those who watch the show. 44 percent picked Kramer as their
favorite character.
• 54 percent of viewers say they would not want friends like the sit
com characters.
• 27 percent of those interviewed could name all four characters.
Campaign finance demands set
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats said yesterday they'll coop
erate in the House campaign finance investigation but only if the
GOP removes Rep. Dan Burton as head of the probe.
Democrats argue Burton has turned the investigation into a parti
san attack on the president, while Burton accuses Democrats of try
ing to keep the truth from the American people.
Rep. Henry Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Govern
ment Reform and Oversight Committee, said yesterday that
Democrats would end their opposition to immunity for some witness
es if another Republican on the committee replaced Burton.
"For the investigation to have any legitimacy, this must happen,"
Waxman. D-Calif., said in a letter sent yesterday to House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
That's unlikely, although the Republican leadership has suggested
that the investigation into alleged Democratic fund-raising violations
in the 1996 presidential campaign could be moved to another com
mittee where the Republicans have the two-thirds majority needed to
grant immunity to witnesses.
Burton. R-Ind., made that point himself on "Fox News Sunday,"'
saying that if Democrats continue to "try to keep the truth from the
American people," the stalled investigation might move to another
committee.
Republicans arc seeking immunity for four witnesses who may be
able to provide more information on the alleged campaign abuses.
Burton became the focus of Democratic complaints over the
direction of the probe 10 days ago when his staff released excerpts
of phone conversations between President Clinton's Arkansas
friend Web Hubbell and his wife. Su/y, made while Hubbell was in
prison.
Burton's chief investigator. David Bossie, was forced to resign last
week after it was revealed that his staff omitted Hubbell's comments
that were favorable to the president — that Mrs. Clinton did nothing
wrong in the Whitewater land deal and that Hubbell did not take hush
money from presidential friends to protect the C lintons.
Bossie. who appeared on ABC's "Ihis Week With Sam Donald
son and Cokie Roberts" and CNN's "Late Edition," acknowledged
he made an error in not originally releasing all the tapes. He said he
and Burton agreed he should step aside to deprive the White House
of an issue and "put the focus back onto the tapes."
