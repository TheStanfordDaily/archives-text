# FAA grounds old Boeing 737s
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government yesterday grounded
older models of the Boeing 737. the
world's most popular jet. after
mandatory inspections of some ail -
craft found extensive wear in power
lines running through their wing fuel
tanks.
The order affected 15 percent of
the 737s operating domestically,
causing scattered (light cancellations
as the business week began. But with
a typical inspection taking about six
hours, the impact on the flying public

yesterday apparently was minimal.
A number of flights were can
celed at Philadelphia International
Airport, but ticket clerks attributed
most of them to the weather. The
few passengers affected by inspec
tion delays seem to take the develop
ments in stride.
"If you have wiring problems, it's
better to cancel the flights, ground
the fleet." said Kevin Sagers. a 34-
year-old Air National Guard pilot
waiting at the Philadelphia airport
for a substitute flight to Dayton,

Ohio, because his own flight was
delayed by a different mechanical
problem on another type aircraft.
"I've seen guys die from malfunc
tioning airplanes, so I'd rather see it
fixed than see people die."
At Reagan National, just outside
Washington. Doug C lowers said his
United (light to Chicago was can
celed. " but they made sure they
didn't mess up my plans tix) much
They made sure I was on the next
available flight."
The emergency inspection, the

broadest FA A order lor commercial
aircraft since McDonnell-Douglas
DC-l()s were grounded in 1979.
came three days after the Federal
Aviation Administration gave air
lines up to a week to inspect their
oldest 737s for signs of wear in the
wiring or the pipes that carry the
wires through the fuel tanks.
A recent inspection of a Conti
nental Airlines 737 found both
exposed wires and holes in the piping
believed to have been caused by
electrical sparks.
