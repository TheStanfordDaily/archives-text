JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross said a meeting scheduled today in Washing
ton to launch Mideast peace talks would be post
poned, a top Palestinian negotiator said.
"We met with Mr. Ross and he informed us
that the meeting would not be held on Monday,"
Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian municipal affairs
minister, said yesterday.
Earlier, David Bar-lllan. a top aide to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israeli
side had received no official word that President
Clinton had decided to postpone the scheduled

meeting.
The delay apparently came after Ross failed to
persuade Israel to agree to a U.S.-proposed 13
percent pullback in the West Bank.
Clinton had offered to play host to a new round
of Mideast talks Monday if Israel approved the
U.S. plan.
Erekat said that Ross would now return to
Washington for consultations with Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
Before leaving. Ross was scheduled to hold a
third and final meeting with Netanyahu after pre

vious discussions failed to budge the Israeli leader
from his position that the scope of the propi>sed
withdrawal would endanger Israel's security.
Netanyahu, angered b\ I S. insistence on the
13-percent withdrawal, had accused the Ameri
cans of portraying him as an obstacle to peace dur
ing a Friday meeting with Ross, the daily Vlaariv
reported yesterday.
"You want to depict me as the one who is
thwarting the peace process, and I 'm not prepared
to accept that." Netanyahu told Ross, according to
Maariv.
