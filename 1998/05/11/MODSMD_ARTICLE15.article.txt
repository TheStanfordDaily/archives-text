Big Siblings program should
not be perceived as extending
privileges to excluded frosh

THE NEW STANFORD Uni
versity Big Siblings program
is a valuable addition to the
process of welcoming new students to
the Farm. But it should not under
mine existing sibling programs by
misunderstanding their purposes or
by suggesting a degree of unprece
dented inclusiveness.
Sibling programs are offered
through ethnic or religious groups
because of a perceived lack of sup
port networks for new students in
these respective communities. These
sibling programs aim to provide
attachments so that students won't
feel isolated.
The SUBS program is commend
able because it offers incoming fresh
men the chance to join a small stu
dent-support group independent of
cultural or religious background. The
program has the potential to put stu
dents in touch with upperclass men
tors and to encourage them to seek
close relationships with professors.
Most of these elements, however,
are not new to the sibling programs
already in place.

While the new program has distin
guished itself from eurrent programs
by advertising its inclusiveness, it is,
in theory, no more inclusive than
existing programs. These are also
open to any and all students who ask
to participate.
However, not all students feel
comfortable participating in a pro
gram that specifically targets an eth
nicity or religion that may not be
their own.
Indeed, what distinguishes existing
sibling programs from the new one is
that they offer cultural or religious
support that is lacking in the academ
ic advising or residential education
programming geared to the entire
freshman population.
While we recognize the program's
value, the selling point of SUBS is not
its inclusiveness — an element that
the existing programs already boast
— but its intended appeal to students
across cultures and religions.
Some may say that these needs are
already met through Res Ed and
other University-wide events, but the
initiative that the student leaders
demonstrate is admirable.
However, they should be wary of
undermining the cultural, religious
and educational value that existing
sibling programs contribute to the
larger Stanford community.
