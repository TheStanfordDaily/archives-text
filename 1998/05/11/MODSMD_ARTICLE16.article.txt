Respect rape survivors
So you might have heard us last
Wednesday night.
In fact, I know you did.
I saw you peeking around the curtains
as we passed by below your windows.
Some of you even opened your win
dows to hear us better as we chanted and
yelled.
Last Wednesday night was the Take
Back the Night March. Many women and
a few brave men gathered to share their
thoughts about rape and the ways it has
affected their lives.
You'd probably be surprised at how
many women on this campus have either
been raped or helped a loved one deal
with the trauma.
We carried our candles and marched
around campus, heading to places where
rapes have occurred in a symbolic effort to
reclaim the night.
Unfortunately, dark, isolated campus
walkways aren't the only dangerous
places. This was proved to me again last
night as we passed certain residences on
campus.
My friends have told me horror stories
about being harassed on other campuses
during their Take Back the Night marches,
but I always assumed that Stanford men
would be a little better, a little more sensi
tive, a little more human.
I guess I was wrong.
Some men marched with us. Others
yelled at us.
As we passed one fraternity house, men

taunted us from their windows.
As we passed the next house, men came
outside and hid behind trees to yell back at
us. I thought Stanford men were better
than that.
I was disappointed and angered at the
insensitivity of these men, both toward
women in general and toward the rape
survivors who were marching in our
group.
You may not consider yourself a femi
nist. You may not even like women.
But it is appalling to mock and disre
spect the women who have survived vio
lent crimes.
To you men who mocked us or taunted
us or looked furtively out your windows:
yes, we were talking to you.
To you women who peered from
behind curtains: why don't you join us
next time?

Calamity for Palestine
Two letters in Thursday's Daily
charged that Aly Remtulla's thoughtful
column of May 3 was "incorrect," "unre
searched," and required "more investiga
tion." Remtulla had argued that Israel's 50
years of existence involved pain and hard
ship for Jews as well as Palestinians and
said his aim was to "encourage thought
about shared injustice." None of the lei

ters in response pointed out any factual
errors in his column, but instead praised
Israel as an unalloyed success.
Israel is undoubtedly a success, with an
average per capita income of $17,000
(some 14 times larger than that of the
Palestinians under Israeli occupation), a
powerful nuclear arsenal and control over
far more land than was allotted to it by the
United Nations in 1947. Part of Israel's
success is due to the close cooperation and
help the United States has given Israel
over the years, including more then $75
billion in aid. Israel has also been helped
by the fact that most of the world rightly
feels sympathy for a long-persecuted peo
ple who survived one of history's most
atrocious crimes.
Remtulla reminded us that Israel's suc
cess came at high cost to the Palestinians
on whose land the Jewish state was built.
Several Israeli historians have recently
challenged the established myths of
Israel's origins by revealing that Israel
forcibly expelled hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians from their homes in 1948 and
provoked much of the fighting that has
taken place since then.
Benny Morris, professor of history at
Ben-Gurion University, recently wrote in
Tikkun magazine that Israel turned down
Israeli peace offers in 1949-51, that former
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan had
admitted that "most of the border troubles
between Israel and Syria in the 1950s and
60s were instigated by Israel," and that
Israel's rejection of "reasonable Egyptian
peace offers in 1970-71" led to the 1973
war.

Today it is especially important to rec
ognize that Israel's triumph meant calami
ty for the Palestinians. Since 1967, inhabi
tants of the West Bank and Gaza have had
to endure the hardships of military occu
pation and the confiscation of their land
and water for Jewish settlements.
In recent years the almost continuous
border closings and roadblocks imposed
by Israel have further crippled the Pales
tinian economy. The Oslo agreement of
1993 brought hope that within five years
both peoples could achieve a lasting
peace. Israel's success will not be complete
until this hope is realized, and Palestini
ans, like Jews, can enjoy security and inde
pendence in a state of their own.

Exploitation in Israel
Reading the spate of letters that were
published in response to Aly Remtulla's
column last Monday, I noticed that most
of the letter writers who opposed the
columnist's view proclaimed similar senti
ments.
Most declared that Israel has achieved
tremendous progress despite the heavy
odds against it, and that itself is a cause for
celebration. This may be true, but does
this development have any tangible mean
ing for the native Palestinians?
Applying the same logic, even advo

cates of South Africa's erstwhile racist
regime could claim that South Africa has
been a success, despite economic sanctions
against it for decades, since it has managed
to provide a "great" life for it citizens.
The whole purpose of development is
defeated when the word "citizens" applies
only to a privileged part of the society. In
South Africa's case the blacks were
deprived of their citizenship rights. In
Israel's case it is the Palestinians.
No country can claim progress based
upon preferential treatment of only a sec
tion of its populace.
