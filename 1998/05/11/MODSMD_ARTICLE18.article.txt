## Working hard to find pleasure 
### 
Last week my
worlds collided
when my best
friend from Calgary came
for a visit. Jackie and 1
have been friends since
the sixth grade. She
knows more about me
than anyone else.

I am often struck by how incredibly dif
ferent Jackie and I are. She is a college
dropout with a certificate in film produc
tion, and I am graduating from Stanford.
She is a struggling composer and artist,
and I am applying to the top graduate
schools in my field. Jackie works at a drug
store selling cosmetics, while I look for
internships in Europe.
This may look like a simple story of
"have" and "have not." As always, after
spending time with Jackie, I am not sure
which of us is the "have." Many of us at
Stanford have simple notions of success —
a top graduate school, a high-paid consult
ing job or a position on Capitol Hill. My
friend has none of these, yet she is one of
the most fulfilled people I know.
Jackie lives with her fiance David in a
small house. They are getting married
next summer — a short outdoor ceremony
during an all-day beach barbecue party for
family and friends. She has just planted a
vegetable garden and enjoys occasional
visits to the tanning salon. Jackie recently
turned down a lucrative, 16-hour-a-day

film job so that she could spend quality
time with David. Jackie is ambitious, but
unlike many people here, she is not willing
to sacrifice everything to be successful.
Jackie and David have sex at least once
a day. They enjoy each other's company
and spend most of their time together.
They are so interested in pleasure and so
comfortable with their sexuality that they
recently went to a swinger's club and met
another couple that they have seen twice.
Jackie has sex with the other man, while
David and the other woman watch, and
then they reverse roles. The swinger's
scene is not for everyone, but is an illus
tration of Jackie's appetite for personal
and shared pleasure.
Jackie has had many relationships.
Before David, she dated a woman for over
three years. Jackie had to end the rela
tionship when it became negative, but she
has no regrets.
I compare her relationship history with
my own. I have only dated one person in
the last four years, and I had to end that
short relationship because he could not
give me enough of himself.
Granted, my pickings are slim, but part
of my dating drought is that I don't make
time to meet people. Like so many Stan
ford students, I am too self-interested,
which makes it difficult to meet men. That
we joke about dating as a "five unit class"
is itself a sad commentary on where our
values lie.

In the academic hustle and hustle of
Stanford, many of us lose sight of the
important things. Jackie's visit gave me a
chance to look at my life with new eyes. I
saw Stanford as a beautiful place, not just
a set of sandstone buildings. We prepared
a meal for my friends, and I enjoyed cook
ing, eating and drinking wine. Jackie
insisted on frequent smoke breaks. I
admire that she can take five minutes
every few hours for personal pleasure.
Despite my honors thesis, I
took four full days off to spend with my
best friend, and they were some of my best
times at Stanford. I don't make enough
time for myself during the academic year.
I don't always enjoy my food, lie in the sun
or get enough sleep. These are all difficult
to do when you are immersed in the fast
paced Stanford culture. A lot of the time I
feel guilty for enjoying the simple plea
sures of life. I even count the fat grams in
my cookies.
I am graduating in June, and although I
have gotten much out of my Stanford
experience, fun has not been at the top of
my list. Given my ambitions, I am not sure
that it ever can be my first priority. Today
I make a vow to try to look at my life from
a different perspective — to try to find
pleasure in each day. I urge you to join
me.
