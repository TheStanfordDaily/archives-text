## Alda Leu Explaining why everyone deserves a 'wife' 
### 
I WANT A "wife." My very own June
Cleaver, stay-at-home, traditional
"wife."
Someone to cook and to make sure
there's a warm, delicious gourmet dinner
waiting on the table after 1 get home from
a long day at work.
Someone to clean, keep the house neat,
nicely decorated and free of dust and clut
ter.
Someone to do the laundry, and pick up
the dry cleaning so my Chanel suits don't
get wrinkled and worn.
Someone to run errands, shop for gro
ceries, go to the bank, drop off a bill pay
ment, mail letters, send out Christmas
cards, select gifts, buy the kids clothes,
sporting goods and school supplies.
Someone to chat with the other
house"wives" to make sure that our chil
dren are doing better on their multiplica
tion tables, scoring more runs, reading at
an earlier age.
Someone to talk to, to keep up with
politics, stay well-versed in art, understand

philosophy, challenge my mind.
Someone to listen to me talk about my
"rough" day at work, provide sympathy
and warmth, offer a massage.
Someone to take out, to

make clever conversation at
cocktail parties, stun the
crowd with good looks, vaca
tion with in the Cayman
Islands, enjoy the opera with,
cheer with at a 'Niners game
(from our private luxury box,
of course).
Someone to chauffeur the
kids, drop them off at school,
pick them up after school,
drive them to piano lessons,
soccer, baseball, football, ten
nis, Kumon.
Someone to monitor the
children's schoolwork, read to

them, check their homework,
be the room mother, bring cupcakes to
class for their birthday, go to teacher-par
ent conferences, volunteer to supervise for

field trips.
Someone to mother the children, make
sure there are fresh-baked snacks for them
when they get home, change diapers,
nurse them to health, give

_ — ■ -
them baths, put them to bed
at a decent hour.
Someone to volunteer,
work at the hospital, monitor
students at recess, organize
I the annual country club char
ity auction, teach Sunday
school.
Someone to do all of the
things that a traditional
"wife" does.
Who wouldn't want one?
I've known for quite
some time that I simply was
not cut out for the traditional
"wife" role. Hut that does not

mean that I don't appreciate
their job, and the value of it.
Let's face it, it's hard work. Maybe the
jobs that have traditionally gone to a

"wife" should always be shared. Hut his
toricaily, they haven't been.
In exchange, I'd gladly share my life,
my love and my salary with my "wife."
He'd deserve every ounce of it.
He can buy the Jeep (irand Cherokee
(Limited, naturally), have the 2-carat
Tiffany-set diamond ring, go on shopping
sprees, keep full charge of the Platinum
AmEx, golf when the children are at
school, play bridge, knit, whatever he
wants — as long as everything's taken care
of at home, of course.
1 refuse to believe that only women are
vested with domestic, maternal instincts.
There must be a man out there who can
meet these stringent requirements.
Women have been meeting them tor
years.
But if my mate hath a career, then so be
it. At the very least, we'll split evenly the
"wife" responsibilities.
And maybe get a housekeeper for our
summer home as well.
I'll be damned if it's just me making

those parent-teacher conferences or miss
ing important meetings to pick up sick
children from school.
If we're both working, then we're both
working at home and in the office.
My hat goes off to all those "wives" and
mothers out there that have balanced
work and "wifedom" successfully. Thanks
to all those working mothers, male or
female.
You should get appreciation more than
once a year.
You are truly amazing.
I'll be the first person to admit that I
can't hack it. nor do I think that any one
person should have to. I am simply not
genetically engineered to be a full-time
"wife."
That sort of thing just isn't my bag.

were some way that men could share the
"iov" of childbirth, too.
