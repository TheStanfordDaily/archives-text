Film invites dialogue
In light of the recent rash of letters in
opposition to Aly Remtulla's column "An
anniversary not to celebrate," (Monday,
May 4) we would like to heed his call to no
longer "continue to argue about the past."
The Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), along with the Organiza
tion of Arab-American Students in Stan
ford (OASIS), wants to look toward a
peace process that situates the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict in the present.
We hope to begin accomplishing this by
screening "People and the Land" [1997)
on Wednesday. May 13 at 10:30 p.m. in
several dorms.
The film will be followed by an intimate
and informal discussion to begin a conver

sation on this topic.
The Palestinian situation is easy to dis
regard if the Palestinians continue to be
portrayed as a mass of unknown faces.
The film depicts the human dimensions
and daily struggles of Palestinians living in
Israel.
We invite the Stanford community to
further investigate and question the Pales
tinian-Israeli conflict by screening this
movie, which provides a perspective that is
not often depicted by the mainstream
media.
"People and the Land" was produced
by Tom Hayes and shown on various Pub
lic Broadcasting Service (PBS) affiliates.
The raw footage used in the film passed
through two levels of Israeli censorship
before leaving Israel.
"People and the Land" was previously
viewed at the New York Museum of Mod

ern Art, the Vermont International Film
Festival, the Middle East Studies Associa
tion of North America (MESA) FilmFest
and at numerous other venues.
When Hayes was requested to attach a
letter to the film by his distributor to
explain the film's intention, he wrote that
"People and the Land" is a story told from
an American point of view â€” the view
point of a person who steps over homeless
people on his way to work while his gov
ernment is dumping $828.(XM) per hour
into another country.
Serious discussion among taxpayers of
the United States' role in this brutal occu
pation is 29 years overdue.
Discussion cannot occur until Ameri
cans are aware of the way the information
they receive is being filtered. Americans
must see the occupation through the- eyes
of independent American sources.

Through interviews with Israeli settlers,
officials, members of the army and Pales
tinians. the video portrays discrepancies in
Israeli policies and the implementation of
those policies regarding Palestinians,
Israelis and tourists in Israel.
The film also reminds the mainstream
media of its deficient portrayal of the
plight of Christians in Israel.
Eman, a Palestinian Christian, noted
that her children have been deprived ol
the privilege of visiting some of Christian
ity's most sacred shrines, including the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Elias, a Palestinian pharmacist, stated
that since the occupation. Christians have
been prohibited from enacting the proces
sion to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
to bring back the light during Easter.
In last Thursday's Daily. Yael Paster
nak and Tamar Entzel wrote that thc\

"strongly encourage readers to question
and research. . .** the Palestinian-Israeli
situation. We respond by urging you to
screen this video to initiate conversations
and begin a process of mutual respect and
understanding.
