## Softball awarded top regional seed 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
When the selection show for the
199K Softball College World Series
began at 6 p.m. last night, Kissick Au
ditorium in the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center was packed with play
ers and their families.
The Cardinal knew that its 39-16
record and third-place finish in the
Pacific 10 Conference (17-11) would
be enough for the program's first
postseason berth; the only questions
remaining were what regional the
team would be sent to and whether it
would get a No. 1 seed.
All weekend the buzz at Stan
ford's two doubleheaders against the
Oregon schools was about the tour
nament. The team was on the bubble
for a No. 1 seed. The Card might get
sent back east. Texas was also a pos
sibility, as was Louisiana or Florida
or even Michigan.
Perhaps the most dreaded possi
bility was a potential No. 2 seed in
Fresno, where the Card would surely
face third-ranked Fresno State. The
only thing anyone knew for sure was
that the Card was going somewhere.
That was the most important thing.
"I'm so proud of our team and the
accomplishments of these players,"
said head coach John Rittman. "It's
the blcxxl, sweat and tears that every
program goes through and the grow
ing pains. And for them to be here in
this program's (fifth] year says a great
deal about the players that are here."
The first two brackets were re
vealed without little surprise. Two
time defending national champion

Arizona (61-3) got a top seed along
with Big 12 Conference champion
Nebraska (44-10).
When Ann Arbor. Mich., was an
nounced as the site of the third re
gional, the tension grew. It was re
leased with a loud cheer when 11th
ranked DePaul (45-6) got the No. 2
seed in a bracket with top-seeded
Michigan (51-5). A second seed in a
bracket with the second-ranked
Wolverines was dodged.
The excitement got a little higher
when 12th-ranked Louisiana State
was sent to the regional in Seattle,
and one more potential No. 1 seed
was eliminated from the remaining
four regionals.
"It was stressful," said junior
pitcher Becky Blevins. "It was excit
ing because just to go to regionals was
amazing for us, but then we also
knew that we would be a No. 1 or No.
2 seed. We kind of knew what was
going to happen while we were
watching."
Amherst, Mass., was selected as
the site of the fifth regional, and the
crowd at Kissick let out a collective
groan when Oklahoma (47-13) was
awarded the top seed in the weakest
bracket.
But the enthusiasm quickly
picked up when eighth-ranked Texas
(46-14) got the No. 1 seed in Tampa,
Fla., eliminating the Longhorns as a
host school and placing No. 6 South
Florida (55-12) as a second seed.
That left just two more sites to be
filled. Fresno State was an obvious
choice for one of the two remaining
No. I seeds, and Stanford could ei
ther be sent to Fresno as the two or
get the final one seed.
"When Oklahoma went to Mass
achusetts, we were kind of sad he
cause Fresno was still an option at
that point," Blevins said. "The best
was [when they announced] Fresno
because we knew there was only one
place left, and we knew we were
going there as a No. 1 seed."
And that's exactly what hap
pened. The cheers were almost ear
shattering when Cal State-North
ridge was announced as Fresno's
No. 2 seed, and they continued
through the rest of that bracket.
Stillwater, Okla., was announced
as the last regional site, and sudden
ly the crowd became dead silent an
ticipating the announcement of the
top seed. And when the Card was
named the final No. 1 seed, the play
ers jumped to their feet, shouting,
exchanging hugs and celebrating
their first postseason appearance.
"To not go to regionals for the
first time as a three or four seed, but
to do it right and go as a No. 1 seed
feels really good," Blevins said.
But it wasn't all fun and games.
Junior tri-captain Marcy Crouch sat
quietly on the front row staring
thoughtfully ahead at the screen.
"Obviously we were on the bor
derline for getting a No. 1 seed, so
that's why have such a good No. 2
team," Crouch said. "Both Okla
homa State and Florida State are
quality teams."
Oklahoma State (37-17) is the
host school, and the Cowgirls were
awarded the No. 2 seed. The Semi
noles (51-19) grabbed the thirdseed,
and the fourth seed — Stanford's
game one opponent — is Southwest
Missouri State (30-20).
The other "three of these pro
grams have a lot of soft ball tradi
tion," Rittman said. "Nothing is easy
about the postseason. Regionals is
going to be a war. Everybody's gun
ning for the World Series now."
