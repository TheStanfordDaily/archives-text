# Women's golf third in West
## 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
The Arizona women's golf team came to Stanford
as the top-ranked team in the nation and continued its
dominance of the collegiate ranks by capturing the
NCAA West Regional team title.
The Wildcats played fantastic golf in all three
rounds at the par-73, 6,093-yard Stanford Golf
Course and ran away from the field by posting a
three-day total of 5-under-par 871.
As the spectacular play of the Wildcats continued
throughout the weekend, it was easy for all the other
teams in the field to sit back and marvel.
But this tournament was far too important for the
Stanford squad, and the Cardinal did a lot more than
spectate.

WOMEN'S GOLF

■ This weekend: Stanford (301-296-298 — 895) tied for
third with Tulsa at the NCAA West Regional, 24 strokes
behind Arizona.

The Card quietly fought into a tie for third place
with Tulsa at 895, clinching a spot in the NCAA
Championships, which will be held May 20-23 at the
University Ridge Golf Course in Madison, Wise.
"Arizona played unbelievably well this weekend,"
said freshman Hilary Homeyer. "But in reality, the
regional was just a qualifier for the championships.
All we needed to do was get through this round, and
that is exactly what we did."
Considering that the tournament was held on its
home course, the Cardinal hoped to post lower scores
but was content to take third.
"We obviously would have liked to have scored
better on our course," Homeyer said. "But the team
was pleased with the outcome, and we are looking
forward to Wisconsin."
The Cardinal was especially satisfied with its fin
ish, considering its poor performance in the opening
round Thursday. Stanford posted a 9-over-par 301
and was tied for 1 Ith.
"I think we were all just happy to make it through
after our performance on Thursday," said sophomore
Julie Dunn. "No one really scored well in the first
round, and it says something about our team that we
were able to come back from that.'
The Cardinal quickly began to repair the opening
round's damage Friday, firing a team total of 2% to
jump into a tie for fifth. Stanford then completed the
comeback Saturday, carding a 298 and leaping into
third.
"It was great that we didn't get scared after the first
round," Homeyer said. "Being in Uth and on the
bubble to qualify for nationals, it would have been
easy to panic. Hut we came back
the next two days and scored well."
The top 11 qualifiers from the
regional advanced to the NCAAs.
Arizona State took second at
KK6 (10 over par). Other qualifiers
include Tulsa (K95). Texas (899),
USC (K99), New Mexico (908),
New Mexico State (90S). Washing
ton (911). Oregon State (912) and
Oregon (912).
Arizona State freshman Grace
Hark, the top-ranked player in the
nation, took the individual title at
7-under-par 212. Park posted an
even-par 73 in Saturday's final
round.
For Stanford. Dunn posted the
highest individual finish, a tie for
11 th. Dunn rebounded from a first
round 77 with consecutive rounds
under par. She carded a 72 in Fri
day's second round and secured
her 11 th-place finish by firing a 2-
under-par7l Saturday.
"I was very happy with the way 1
played the last two days." Dunn
said. "I started to hit my driver a lot
straighter. and I controlled my
short irons very well. It felt good to
have my game come together alter
such a rough first round."
The top two Stanford players,
Homeyer and freshman Stephanie
Keever, each struggled on the final
day and shot a pair of 775. Keever
ended up in a tie for 15th. while
Homeyer finished in a tie for 30th.
"1 hit the ball pretty poorly all
weekend," said Homeyer, who is
ranked ninth in the nation.
"But I managed my game and
was able to make my scores re
spectable. I know that my game
will come back really soon, and if I
can get some luck on the greens,
my scores should be really low in a
couple of weeks."
This week, the Cardinal will
enjoy a light practice schedule in
preparation for its departure for

Madison.
"This week will not be a time to
make any big changes," Homever
said. "We are very confident in our
ability, and look forward to re

bounding at nationals. Obviously
things could have gone a little bet
ter this weekend, but we are mov
ing on. We will be focused and
ready to compete."
