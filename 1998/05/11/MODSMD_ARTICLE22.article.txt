# Women's golf third in West

The Arizona women's golf team came to Stanford
as the top-ranked team in the nation and continued its
dominance of the collegiate ranks by capturing the
NCAA West Regional team title.
The Wildcats played fantastic golf in all three
rounds at the par-73, 6,093-yard Stanford Golf
Course and ran away from the field by posting a
three-day total of 5-under-par 871.
As the spectacular play of the Wildcats continued
throughout the weekend, it was easy for all the other
teams in the field to sit back and marvel.
But this tournament was far too important for the
Stanford squad, and the Cardinal did a lot more than
spectate.

University Ridge Golf Course in Madison, Wise.
"Arizona played unbelievably well this weekend,"
said freshman Hilary Homeyer. "But in reality, the
regional was just a qualifier for the championships.
All we needed to do was get through this round, and
that is exactly what we did."
Considering that the tournament was held on its
home course, the Cardinal hoped to post lower scores
but was content to take third.
"We obviously would have liked to have scored
better on our course," Homeyer said. "But the team
was pleased with the outcome, and we are looking
forward to Wisconsin."
The Cardinal was especially satisfied with its fin
ish, considering its poor performance in the opening
round Thursday. Stanford posted a 9-over-par 301
and was tied for 1 Ith.
"I think we were all just happy to make it through
after our performance on Thursday," said sophomore
Julie Dunn. "No one really scored well in the first
round, and it says something about our team that we
were able to come back from that.'
The Cardinal quickly began to repair the opening
round's damage Friday, firing a team total of 2% to
jump into a tie for fifth. Stanford then completed the
comeback Saturday, carding a 298 and leaping into
third.
"It was great that we didn't get scared after the first
round," Homeyer said. "Being in Uth and on the
bubble to qualify for nationals, it would have been
