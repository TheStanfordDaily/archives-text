Stanford placed third at the National
Championships in Los Angeles.

But that's what the Stanford
women's water polo team had to do
yesterday, playing Hawaii for third
place after losing to California in the
semifinals of the National Champi
onships at USC.
Despite the disappointment of
losing to the Golden Bears in the
semifinals, the Cardinal (29-6) re
gained its composure for a 10-4 victo
ry over the Rainbow Wahine (29-12).
"We really worked as a team very
well," said sophomore Ellen Estes.
"But Cal took us by surprise, and they
were able to win when it counted."
Stanford had won its last three
matches against Cal (27-6), which
went on to lose the title match 7-3 to
UCLA (35-1).
"It's hard to come back from a loss
like that," said sophomore Elissa

Keszler.
Saturday's loss placed Stanford in
the third-place match. After the dis
appointment of losing a shot at the
national title, yesterday's game was
an opportunity for redemption and a
chance for the Cardinal squad to
prove something to itself.
"All season we were focused on
winning" nationals, said Stanford
head coach John Tanner. "We didn't
want second or third or fourth. But
the third-place game is essential to
any tournament. To lose that (semifi
nal) game and come back the next
day requires a lot of pride. It's a great
test of resilience."
And the Cardinal women proved

their resilience in a decisive victory
over Hawaii.
"Stepping it up and coming back
like that said a lot about our team."'
Keszler said. "I'm proud of how we
played."
Stanford attacked quickly, putting
away four goals in the first quarter
and shutting down the Wahine of
fense. Keszler started things off with
a goal shot from the top at 7 meters.
Sophomore Suze Gardner and Estes
followed with goals converted from
six-on-five opportunities. The final
goal of the period came from a break
away counterattack from junior
Lindsay Welsh.
In the second period, Estes scored

on a sweep shot from the hole.
Hawaii's first goal came from Cana
dian national team member Mane-
Luc Arpin on a 4-meter called against
freshman Kris Koblik. In yet another
man-up situation. Gardner fired in a
goal from the top in the last three sec
onds of the quarter to make the score
6-1 at the half.
Stanford's defense, led by junior
goalie Heather Crary in the cage,
came through well in the third quar
ter. again shutting out Hawaii's offen
sive attempts. Crary blocked two
shots n a row and denied a skip shot
to hold the shutout.
