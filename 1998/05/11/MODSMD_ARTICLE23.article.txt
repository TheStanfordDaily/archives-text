Stanford placed third at the National
Championships in Los Angeles.

But that's what the Stanford
women's water polo team had to do
yesterday, playing Hawaii for third
place after losing to California in the
semifinals of the National Champi
onships at USC.
Despite the disappointment of
losing to the Golden Bears in the
semifinals, the Cardinal (29-6) re
gained its composure for a 10-4 victo
ry over the Rainbow Wahine (29-12).
"We really worked as a team very
well," said sophomore Ellen Estes.
"But Cal took us by surprise, and they
were able to win when it counted."
Stanford had won its last three
matches against Cal (27-6), which
went on to lose the title match 7-3 to
UCLA (35-1).
"It's hard to come back from a loss
like that," said sophomore Elissa

Keszler.
Saturday's loss placed Stanford in
the third-place match. After the dis
appointment of losing a shot at the
national title, yesterday's game was
an opportunity for redemption and a
chance for the Cardinal squad to
prove something to itself.
"All season we were focused on
winning" nationals, said Stanford
head coach John Tanner. "We didn't
want second or third or fourth. But
the third-place game is essential to
any tournament. To lose that (semifi
nal) game and come back the next
day requires a lot of pride. It's a great
test of resilience."
And the Cardinal women proved

their resilience in a decisive victory
over Hawaii.
"Stepping it up and coming back
like that said a lot about our team."'
Keszler said. "I'm proud of how we
played."
Stanford attacked quickly, putting
away four goals in the first quarter
and shutting down the Wahine of
fense. Keszler started things off with
a goal shot from the top at 7 meters.
Sophomore Suze Gardner and Estes
followed with goals converted from
six-on-five opportunities. The final
goal of the period came from a break
away counterattack from junior
Lindsay Welsh.
In the second period, Estes scored

on a sweep shot from the hole.
Hawaii's first goal came from Cana
dian national team member Mane-
Luc Arpin on a 4-meter called against
freshman Kris Koblik. In yet another
man-up situation. Gardner fired in a
goal from the top in the last three sec
onds of the quarter to make the score
6-1 at the half.
Stanford's defense, led by junior
goalie Heather Crary in the cage,
came through well in the third quar
ter. again shutting out Hawaii's offen
sive attempts. Crary blocked two
shots n a row and denied a skip shot
to hold the shutout.

Sophomore Ellen Estes struggles against Cal in the Cardinal's disappointing semifinal loss at the na
tional championship tournament. Estes was named to the all-tournament first team.
The lone goal of the quarter was
scored by Stanford's Nicole Glazer,
who put one in from the post off a
pass from Gardner on six-on-five of
fense.
"Heather [Crary] played great,"
Tanner said. "She was balanced the
whole time and responded well to
each sequence."
Tanner was also pleased by the de
fensive play of Gardner and Welsh,
who took turns matching up with
Arpin, Hawaii's most dangerous
player.
"Arpin is a wonderful all-around
player," Tanner said. Gardner and

Welsh "didn't give her an inch."
The final period of play saw a
man-up conversion for Stanford from
Koblik in what Estes described as a
"boom-boom" play.
Freshman Kelly Shouey made the
pass to Estes, who was edging out
from the post to draw out her defend
er. Estes passed it into the post to
Koblik, who put the ball in the back of
the net. Hawaii managed to score two
more goals, one of which came while
Stanford was playing man-down.
But Stanford answered back with
another goal from Welsh and an in
credible full-court shot from goalie
Crary. The final goal of the game was
scored by Hawaii in a six-on-five at
tack.
"I'm proud of the way they

played," Tanner said. "They played
with a lot more fluidity."
The entire Stanford squad showed
incredible talent and composure in
the game against Hawaii. And the
women proved that they truly are one
of the best teams in the nation.
"We were able to overcome the
disappointment [of losing to Cal] and
we won resoundingly," Tanner said.
"This wasn't really where we
wanted to be," Gardner said. "It was
hard to come out after such a hard
loss. This was a game for pride. Even
though we didn't get to prove to
everyone else that we were the best,
we proved it to ourselves. It was a
great year. The friendship on the
team is incredible. Even though we
lost, that's still there."

The win is even more impressive
considering the 8-5 heart-breaking
loss the team suffered at the hands of
Cal in the national semifinal.
In the first quarter, the Card led
the Bears 3-2, with goals coming from
junior Rachel Best, Estes and Gard
ner. Gardner scored again on a shot
from outside the 7-ineter mark at the
beginning of the second period of
play, but Cal answered back with two
more goals to tie it up at the half.
Stanford held Cal scoreless in the
third quarter until the last 90 seconds
when a skip shot got past Crary and
into the cage. But despite two man-up
opportunities in the period, the Car
dinal offense could not put any of its
shots into the goal.
Stanford's passing and shots were
slightly off all quarter and the Card
was unable to recover in the last peri
od of play.
In the final quarter of the game,
Cal hole-set Alisa von Hartiszche
scored three times. Her first goal
came from a 4-meter penalty shot
called against Shouey. Both of von
Hartiszche's other points were scored
by spinning her defender at 2 meters
and firing the ball past Crary at point
blank range.
With 3:25 to go in the quarter Cal
was leading 8-4 and the deficit proved
too much for Stanford to overcome.
The Card scored once more when
Gardner took a 4-meter in the last 30
seconds.
"We never got up to our full po
tential," Estes said. "We never got up
to our top speed. And that's what we
needed to do."
"Cal was loose and they shot
well," Tanner said. "They played
great defense against us. We had a
few periods without good team de
fense. They outplayed us, but that's
not to say we couldn't have won. Re
sults aren't always everything, but
[the loss] was incredibly disappoint
ing."
The Cardinal got off to a strong
start in the tournament Friday by de
feating Michigan 10-1 and Massachu
setts 10-2.
In Stanford's first game of the
tournament at Long Beach, the Car

dinal got out to a 4-0 lead over the
lOth-seeded Wolverines (32-9-1 at
tourney's end) after the lirst quarter.
At the half, the margin had widened
to 6-0.
In the third quarter, the Card tal
lied two more points and kept Michi
gan scoreless. Michigan's only point
came in the first 30 seconds of the
fourth period, and Stanford an
swered back with another two goals.
Scoring for the Card were Keszler,
Estes, Koblik and freshman Dani
Bell with two apiece. Senior Julie
Baker and Shouey each scored once.
The Cardinal defense was led by
Crary in the first half and freshman
goalie Alii Henry in the second.
Friday evening, Stanford took on
seventh-seeded Massachusetts, one
of the top teams from the East. Once
again, the Card started off with a
strong and effective offensive attack.
Junior Nicole Glazer, Welsh and
Gardner each put one away in the
first quarter.
Glazer and Welsh's goals were
converted from man-up opportuni
ties, which the Stanford team strug
gled with at regionals. Gardner
scored on a 4-meter penalty shot
drawn by Estes.
Estes scored twice in the second
quarter, once on another man-up and
once on a backhand from the hole. In
the third period of play, freshman
Anne-Marie Keenan scored on a
breakaway.
The Minutewomen (30-6 at tour
ney's end) put one away on a skip
shot past Crary with 2:34 to go in the
quarter. The second UMass goal
came on a shot from the outside at
1:46. But that would be the last goal
for the opposing team, in spite of a
penalty shot later in the quarter
which Crary denied. To round out the
third period, Estes and Keszler added
two more points to the Cardinal total.
In the final quarter, freshmen Hi
lary Gallogly and Ali Riddell notched
two more for the Card to make the
final score 10-2.
Estes and Gardner went on to
claim first-team all-tournament hon
ors. while Crary took home honor
able mention distinction.
