BASEBALL

■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 4, No. 7 USC 2
■ Yesterday: USC 5, Stanford 2

■ Today: USC (38-14,20-9 Six-Pac) at Stanford
(41-9-1,22-7), 6 p.m.. Sunken Diamond.

With a 4-2 victory over No. 2 USC (38-14.
20-9 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) on Saturday in the first of a three-game
series. No. 1 Stanford (41-9-1,22-7) clinched
its second straight — and possibly final —
Six-Pac title. Next year, the southern and
northern divisions might play a 10-team, 27-
game schedule prior to a conference tourna
ment.
Most of the pregame ballpark buzz Satur
day afternoon, however, hummed to the
tune of the pitching duel, a projected show

down between the Cardinal's junior ace Jeff
Austin (12-2) and Trojan senior starter Seth
Etherton (10-3).
Austin, the Cardinal workhorse, had
thrown a total of seven complete games en
tering the matchup and is one of 12 finalists
for the Rotary Smith National Player of the
Year Award, in addition to being a project
ed first-round draft pick.
Etherton. by contrast, rejected a contract
offer from the St. Louis Cardinals to return
for a final run at the College World Series
with the Trojans and has largely carried the
IJSC squad through the season.
In addition, the right-hander reigns as the
all-time strikeout king in Pac-10 history and
suffered his only league loss this season to
the Cardinal in an 1-0 defeat April 3.
Even the pitchers' personalities are simi
lar — both hard-working, extremely polite
and determined not to lose.
Austin is "one of the best pitchers in the
nation," Etherton said. "It's always fun to go
against guvs like that."

In arguably his biggest victory of the season, junior Jeff Austin won the pitchers' duel
against USC ace Seth Etherton. Austin led the baseball team to clinch its eighth Six-
Pac title with Saturday's victory.
But as the game progressed,
Etherton labored ever more slowly
at the mound, while Austin contin
ued his style of quick, effective
pitching.
Austin "limits his pitches he
cause he doesn't walk many guys.
He's had an unbelievable season
for us," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
USC's Dedeaux Field witnessed
a superhuman pitching contest
when Austin and Etherton last
met.
Austin threw a complete-game,
six-hit shutout, while Etherton
threw a four-hitter with no walks
and 15 strikeouts.
Baseball America heralded the
Card's 1-0 victory as '"the best col
lege baseball game of the season
thus far."
Junior center fielder Jody
Gerut, then — as he did again Sat
urday — spoiled the day for Ether
ton with a solo homer over the
scoreboard in right-center in the
top of the seventh.
Perhaps haunted by visions of
Gerut's April night out on the
town, Etherton surrendered a solo
bomb over Sunken's right-field
fence in the first.
Austin sympathized with Ether
ton's plight.
"That kind of hitter, I wouldn't
want to get up and face him,"
Austin said of Gerut.
Etherton described Gerut as a
"great hitter. He capitalized on a
really bad pitch by me," Etherton
said.
Cardinal sophomore first base
man John Gall then crossed the
plate on a double by junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang to give
Stanford an early 2-0 lead.

Austin blanked the Trojan run
ners at the plate, retiring the side
through the first three innings.
Trojan catcher Jeff DePippo
scored in the fourth off a double by
first baseman Robb Gorr to cut the
Cardinal lead to 2-1.
Stanford senior shortstop Jay
Pecci responded in the bottom of
the fourth with an RBI single that
scored freshman right fielder Joe
Borchard.
Despite a run tallied by Trojan
shortstop Seth Davidson, a home
run by Hochgesang in the bottom
of the eighth effectively silenced a
USC rally.
Yesterday, however, the first hit
of the game was ultimately the
most important one.
The Trojans struck hard in the
second inning against junior pitch
er Chad Hutchinson when right
fielder Brad Ticehurst rocketed a
three-run homer off a fastball to

and determined not to lose.
Austin is "one of the best pitchers in the
nation," Etherton said. "It's always fun to go
against guvs like that."

In arguably his biggest victory of the season, junior Jeff Austin won the pitchers' duel
against USC ace Seth Etherton. Austin led the baseball team to clinch its eighth Six-
Pac title with Saturday's victory.
But as the game progressed,
Etherton labored ever more slowly
at the mound, while Austin contin
ued his style of quick, effective
pitching.
Austin "limits his pitches he
cause he doesn't walk many guys.
He's had an unbelievable season
for us," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
USC's Dedeaux Field witnessed
a superhuman pitching contest
when Austin and Etherton last
met.
Austin threw a complete-game,
six-hit shutout, while Etherton
threw a four-hitter with no walks
and 15 strikeouts.
Baseball America heralded the
Card's 1-0 victory as '"the best col
lege baseball game of the season
thus far."
Junior center fielder Jody
Gerut, then — as he did again Sat
urday — spoiled the day for Ether
ton with a solo homer over the
scoreboard in right-center in the
top of the seventh.
Perhaps haunted by visions of
Gerut's April night out on the
town, Etherton surrendered a solo
bomb over Sunken's right-field
fence in the first.
Austin sympathized with Ether
ton's plight.
"That kind of hitter, I wouldn't
want to get up and face him,"
Austin said of Gerut.
Etherton described Gerut as a
"great hitter. He capitalized on a
really bad pitch by me," Etherton
said.
Cardinal sophomore first base
man John Gall then crossed the
plate on a double by junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang to give
Stanford an early 2-0 lead.

Austin blanked the Trojan run
ners at the plate, retiring the side
through the first three innings.
Trojan catcher Jeff DePippo
scored in the fourth off a double by
first baseman Robb Gorr to cut the
Cardinal lead to 2-1.
Stanford senior shortstop Jay
Pecci responded in the bottom of
the fourth with an RBI single that
scored freshman right fielder Joe
Borchard.
Despite a run tallied by Trojan
shortstop Seth Davidson, a home
run by Hochgesang in the bottom
of the eighth effectively silenced a
USC rally.
Yesterday, however, the first hit
of the game was ultimately the
most important one.
The Trojans struck hard in the
second inning against junior pitch
er Chad Hutchinson when right
fielder Brad Ticehurst rocketed a
three-run homer off a fastball to

BASEBALL

■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 4, No. 7 USC 2
■ Yesterday: USC 5, Stanford 2

■ Today: USC (38-14,20-9 Six-Pac) at Stanford
(41-9-1,22-7), 6 p.m.. Sunken Diamond.

With a 4-2 victory over No. 2 USC (38-14.
20-9 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) on Saturday in the first of a three-game
series. No. 1 Stanford (41-9-1,22-7) clinched
its second straight — and possibly final —
Six-Pac title. Next year, the southern and
northern divisions might play a 10-team, 27-
game schedule prior to a conference tourna
ment.
Most of the pregame ballpark buzz Satur
day afternoon, however, hummed to the
tune of the pitching duel, a projected show

down between the Cardinal's junior ace Jeff
Austin (12-2) and Trojan senior starter Seth
Etherton (10-3).
Austin, the Cardinal workhorse, had
thrown a total of seven complete games en
tering the matchup and is one of 12 finalists
for the Rotary Smith National Player of the
Year Award, in addition to being a project
ed first-round draft pick.
Etherton. by contrast, rejected a contract
offer from the St. Louis Cardinals to return
for a final run at the College World Series
with the Trojans and has largely carried the
IJSC squad through the season.
In addition, the right-hander reigns as the
all-time strikeout king in Pac-10 history and
suffered his only league loss this season to
the Cardinal in an 1-0 defeat April 3.
Even the pitchers' personalities are simi
lar — both hard-working, extremely polite
and determined not to lose.
Austin is "one of the best pitchers in the
nation," Etherton said. "It's always fun to go
against guvs like that."
