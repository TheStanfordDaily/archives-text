■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford 4, No. 7 USC 2
■ Yesterday: USC 5, Stanford 2

■ Today: USC (38-14,20-9 Six-Pac) at Stanford
(41-9-1,22-7), 6 p.m.. Sunken Diamond.

With a 4-2 victory over No. 2 USC (38-14.
20-9 Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion) on Saturday in the first of a three-game
series. No. 1 Stanford (41-9-1,22-7) clinched
its second straight — and possibly final —
Six-Pac title. Next year, the southern and
northern divisions might play a 10-team, 27-
game schedule prior to a conference tourna
ment.
Most of the pregame ballpark buzz Satur
day afternoon, however, hummed to the
tune of the pitching duel, a projected show

down between the Cardinal's junior ace Jeff
Austin (12-2) and Trojan senior starter Seth
Etherton (10-3).
Austin, the Cardinal workhorse, had
thrown a total of seven complete games en
tering the matchup and is one of 12 finalists
for the Rotary Smith National Player of the
Year Award, in addition to being a project
ed first-round draft pick.
Etherton. by contrast, rejected a contract
offer from the St. Louis Cardinals to return
for a final run at the College World Series
with the Trojans and has largely carried the
IJSC squad through the season.
In addition, the right-hander reigns as the
all-time strikeout king in Pac-10 history and
suffered his only league loss this season to
the Cardinal in an 1-0 defeat April 3.
Even the pitchers' personalities are simi
lar — both hard-working, extremely polite
and determined not to lose.
Austin is "one of the best pitchers in the
nation," Etherton said. "It's always fun to go
against guvs like that."
