# Austin on the hill
## 
### 
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Trojan nine that day.
They came to Stanford three games down with but three more to
play.
Division title dreams floated in all the players' heads.
The night before had seemed so long, restless in their beds.
But Southern California knew its chances were so slim.
With Jeff Austin on the mound, the outlook seemed so dim.
The man could pitch nine innings with much grace and so much ease.
Three up. three down to end each half, it seemed like such a breeze.

The Trojans knew there was one hope that they could win this game.
They had one ace to put on the mound, their star, their own big name.
Seth Etherton arose and walked out upon that field.
The Trojan strikeout king had made many batters yield.
He had been the National Pitcher of many weeks this year.
And thus he was one of the few that the hitters knew to fear.
A certain kind of confidence streamed out from this man's head.
He felt that could match Austin and that Stanford's batters would be dead.
But Jody Gerut could hit him. and he knew just what to do.
When he homered into right field and put the Cardinal up by two.
Austin remained near perfect, keeping the batters in their place.
But Etherton was yanked with a frown upon his face.
It seemed as if the Trojan batters were stuck amid a daze.
Austin continued crushing them, he had almost 10 K's.
The SC fans frowned, moaning as they pulled at their hair.
"Nobody can hit this Stanford pitcher." they screamed out in despair.
But I JSC's big slugger would have to be the Trojan hope.
Ip in the ninth and down by two. his team began to mope.
Morgan Ensberg was his name and he bat in the fourth spot.
His hands began to tense as his face grew oh so hot.
So Ensberg stepped up to the plate with much weight upon his bat.
He glanced over at the dugout to where his skipper sat.
And now Austin holds the ball, and now he lets it go.
And now the air is shattered by the force of Ensberg's blow
Oh. somewhere in this favored land the sun in shining bright;
The Band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.
And somew here men are laughing, and little children shout;
But there is no joy at USC, the mighty Austin struck him out.
