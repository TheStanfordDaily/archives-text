# Seniors lead Softball to sweeps of Ducks, Beavers
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Entering the final weekend of its
regular-season schedule, the ninth
ranked Stanford softball team didn't
feel the pressure of a must-win situa
tion.
The Cardinal (39-16,17-11 Pacific
10 Conference) had all but secured a
postseason berth, and a third-place
conference finish was already in the
bag. But that certainly didn't slow the
squad down as Stanford took all four
games against the Oregon schools.
With regional seedings following
the conclusion of yesterday's double
header against Oregon, the Card
took advantage of its final chance to
impress the selection committee in

hopes of landing a top seed, beating
Oregon State 7-1 and 2-1 Saturday
and Oregon 1 -0 and 3-0 yesterday.

Game one against the Beavers
(27-28, 8-20) wasn't close for long.
Oregon State's Brooke Hofstetter
practically pitched batting practice as
the Card juiced the sophomore for
seven runs off 14 hits. Junior desig
nated hitter Marcy Crouch and junior

right fielder Michele Acosta led the
way at the plate as the Card jumped
out early.
Acosta struck first with a two-RBI
double in the bottom of the first, and
Crouch and Acosta each added one
in the third. Crouch took over from
there with a fourth-inning single that
drove in two more runs and a sacrifice
tly in the sixth for Stanford's final
score.
Their performances were good
enough to give both Crouch and
Acosta 33 RBIs on the season and
break the single-season record of 32.
set last year by Acosta. Junior pitcher
Becky Blevins and the Cardinal de
fense did the rest, and one run from
the Beavers in the seventh was too lit
tle, too late.

Game two against Oregon State
wasn't quite the offensive perfor
mance the opener was. After 12
scoreless innings, the Beavers put one
across in the top of the 13th as junior
Jodi Chmielewski drove in freshman
Brooke Rutschman, who began the
inning on second because of the in
ternational tie-break rule.
In the bottom half of the inning,
the Card came down to its final out
and junior second baseman Jennie
Foyle. With runners on second and
third, Foyle ripped a two-out single
into center field to score the game
winning runs.
"We had to get a hit, and I knew
that one hit would score two runs,"
Foyle said. "I was just really relaxed,
and I knew 1 could hit her. It was an

awesome weekend. It's a great way
for the seniors to end their homes
tand."
Yesterday's doubleheader against
Oregon (38-29, 10-18) marked the
final home games of the year. Stan
ford seniors Jessica Schulman, Dawn
Kobata and Blevins were honored
before the game, and the Card went
on to win the final two games of the
regular season.
"It's always emotional," said head
coach John Rittman of Senior Day.
"But to imagine what those kids have
been through here, and to top it off
like this is awesome. All three of them
have been instrumental. They've
played maybe not the star role, but
they've all contributed with leader
ship and personality. And they're all a

huge part of the team."
The first game was again a defen
sive battle that Stanford won, thanks
to one run in the sixth inning. After

tom of the first but didn't score, nei

run in the sixth.
Junior shortstop Michelle Schnei
der reached on an error, and Crouch
drew a walk. Acosta followed with a
rip to left field that looked to score
Schneider, but Oregon junior Alana
Burns made a great throw to get
Schneider at the plate.
But freshman first baseman Jenni
Shideler caught the Ducks off guard
with a squeeze bunt that scored
Crouch for Stanford's only run
Blevins pickcd up the complete
game shutout, her eighth of the year
and improved to 23-K for the season
The junior struck out six while allow
ing just three hits and walking two.

Aeosta came up big at the plate in
game two, driving in all three Stan
ford runs with a 2-for-2 hitting per
formance.
It was more of the same as far as
shutout pitching; Crouch gave up just
three hits in five innings before Schul
man came on in relief. And fittingly,
the senior retired all six batters she
faced in her final game at the Stan

ford Softball Complex as the Cardi
nal pulled out the 3-0 win.
"That was fun, especially since it
was at home and to finish like that,"
Schulman said. "It was a fun day. It
was sad, but it wasn't as sad as it
could've been knowing we have
