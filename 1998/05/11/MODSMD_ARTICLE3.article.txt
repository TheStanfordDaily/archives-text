## New group seeks to create network of student pilots 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
The pursuit of flight has captured the imaginations of
people since the beginning of time.
A new Stanford club is dedicated to furthering that
pursuit by offering students a network for taking to the
air in all forms — from flying airplanes to hang gliding to
skydiving.
Co-presidents Ted Leng. a senior, and Paolo Resmi
ni, a sophomore, created the flight club this quarter with
several goals in mind.
"We wanted to let all the pilots in the Stanford com
munity know who is out there so we could form a net
work of people who love to fly," Leng said.

The club is also dedicated to providing an outlet for
all those who have ever had an interest in flight. Its
founders hope to educate the community about recre
ational and professional aeronautics.
"It was something I wanted to do since my freshman
year when 1 couldn't find someone to fly with." Leng
said, "but for some reason, 1 waited until now."
Out of the 40 members who have joined the club since
April, only 10 are licensed pilots — which is understand
able because a flight license requires 60 to SO flight hours
and $5,000.
The time commitment alone can equal anywhere
from six months to two years, enough to deter manv
would-be pilots regardless of the
monetary commitment.
But the flying club is available to
help. Although the club receives no
University funding, it offers dis
counts on flight trips for its mem
bers, Lengsaid.
As far as flight instruction goes,
the licensed pilots in the club are
more than willing to help. Leng ex
plained that one of the strongest
held beliefs among pilots is that fly
ing is a community effort.
The flight club's activities are not
limited to piloting, as members hope
to bring in guest speakers such as air

line captains, speakers from the Fed
eral Aviation Administration and
naval aviators to share their experi
ences.
Stanford Flight will hold a "fly
in" from the Palo Alto airport to the
Watsonville airport for an air show
on Saturday, May 30.
Ihe club meets every other
Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. in the Car
denal lounge.
"I started flying when I was 15,"
Lengsaid. '"Ever since then. I've had
the 'flying hug.' I'm just excited
about meeting new pilots and shar
ing the experience."

nization independent was intro
duced in the 19705, it was not until
1995 that University funding ceased
altogether.
Since that time, the ASSU has
been completely independent of
University finances.
In addition to the high perfor
mance of the accounts this year,
Coleman said the new structure of
the ASSU's finances has created a
philosophical change. There is less
incentive to spend irresponsibly at
the end of the year because the
money that goes unused can be rein
vested into the endowment and used
at a future date.
"The new system has taken much
of the political nature of budgeting
away," Coleman said. "The goal is
that we are always able to grow a lit
tle bit and serve students."
