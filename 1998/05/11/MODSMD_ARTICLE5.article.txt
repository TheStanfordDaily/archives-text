# ASSU stable in independence
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
A year after the creation of an en
dowment to ensure its self-sufficien
cy, the ASSU has never been so fi
nancially well off, student leaders
say.
Last year, in a crucial decision
made by the senate, the ASSU
sought to make itself more financial
ly stable after the University cut off
its funding in 1995. Money to fund
the political and student-based as
pects of the ASSU is now provided
through an endowment.
In addition, the senate voted to
spin off its financial arm into a new
corporation called Stanford Student
Enterprises.
Over its history, the ASSU had
built up a large reserve of money.
The formal creation of this endow
ment has given the organization a
long-term perspective on its budget
ing and spending activities, ASSU
Financial Manager Don Coleman
said.
At the same time, the money for
SSE was separated from that of the
rest of the ASSU. Although there is
some oversight, the two organiza
tions are financially autonomous
from each other.
"The system works wonderfully
well," Coleman said. "The ASSU

for the first time in
a long time is with
in its operating
budget for the
year."
The new inde
pendent system al
locates 5 percent of
the endowment

every year — regardless oi its pre
sent size — to be spent on ASSU ac
tivities. The remainder of the money
accrues interest through various in
vestments.
The money from the endowment
is invested in stocks, bonds and
money market accounts, according
to Coleman. The use of the money is
handled by professional money mar
keters and a student investment divi
sion.
"Should there be a significant
downturn in the market, we would
feel it a little bit," Coleman said.
"But with an endowment you have
long-term investment possibility."
A committee of four students in
the ASSU Investment Division
monitors the accounts on a weekly
basis. Senior Jacob Foe. the ASSI J's
investment director, has been in
charge of splitting the financial port
folios of SSE and the general ASSU
funds over the past vear.
