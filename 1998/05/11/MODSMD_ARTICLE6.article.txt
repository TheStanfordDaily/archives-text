## Student advocates fight senate bill that would jail truants, runaways 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
A new student organization will
hold a letter-writing campaign to
protest Senate Bill 10 in White
Plaza tomorrow and Wednesday
from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
"This is anti-crime legislation
that decreases the age that children
can be tried as adults and increases
the number of crimes that they can
be charged as adults for." said
freshman Alexis Kaminsky,
founder of Stanford Advocates for
Children. "It also provides no
money for preventative pro
grams."
The bill would repeal the
mandate that keeps children and
juveniles out of adult prisons.
Among other measures, it would
also give federal prosecutors the
choice of whether to try children as
adults, a decision that belongs to
judges.
The bill would cause juvenile
crimes to remain on ;in individual's
permanent record and would make
records of those crimes available to

courts and schools. It would also
allow children to be jailed for ac
tions that are ndt considered
crimes for adults, such as truancy
and running away from home.
The campaign involves sending
letters to the president, vice presi
dent. senators and representatives
to protest the bill and its compan
ion bills in the House of Represen
tatives.
"We don't feel that sending chil
dren to adult jails will solve any
problems," Kaminsky said. "If
you re looking to rehabilitate these
children, this won't help."
Fhe letter-writing project is the
first action from Stanford Advo
cates for Children, which Kamin
sky started this quarter with the
help of sophomore Jade Caines.
The group is dedicated to raising
campus awareness on issues having
to do with children as well as advo
cating those issues on a national
level.
"Jade and 1 went to a Children's
Defense Fund conference as part
of Alternative Spring Break, and
we got inspired to set a group like
this up," Kaminsky said.
Caines added that when they re
turned to campus, they found no
politically active organizations that
focused on children's issues.
"All the existing groups on cam
pus that were dedicated to children
focused on one-on-one programs
like tutoring, and we want to do

something broader." she said.
The group was started with the
help of the Children's Defense
Fund, which is trying to set up "ac
tion centers" in different areas
around the country.
Kaminsky and Caines are plan
ning to apply to the ASSU Com
munity Service Board and possibly
the Haas Center for Public Service
for funding for next year.
"We're going to be a lot more
ambitious for next year, but we
wanted to do something before
school let out this year, so we came
up with the letter-writing cam

paign," Caines said.
For next year, the organization
is planning a twice-quarterly
newsletter, more letter-writing, a
rally and possibly a conference
with prominent speakers.
"We're keeping our plans flexi
ble because whatever we do. we
want to direct it to what's going on
in the news at that time." Caines
said.
