# Senior helping Russia's homeless
## 
### Jennifer Saba Contributing writer 
When Jhumki Basu was at the Stanford in Moscow
program fall of her junior year, she noticed some dis
turbing reports about the growing problem of children
living on the streets.
The senior also noticed that there was little data back
ing up these reports.
If the government wanted to intervene, it needed
quantitative figures, said Basu, a human biology
major.
So instead of coming home and forgetting about the
issue, she set out to conduct the research herself.
With the help of professors and grants, she returned
to Russia to undertake the daunting and emotionally ex
hausting task of documenting the number of children liv
ing on the streets.

"It was the most challenging thing
I've ever done." Basu said.
During the summer. Basu spent
time with street children in Moscow
and St Petersburg.
Some of the children she found
lived on the streets; others resided in
shelters or detention centers. Once she
established a rapport with the chil
dren. she could ask about anything
from health issues to lifestvles.

"Some of them just aren't children." Basu explained.
"They were older in a lot of ways."
One way she got people to open up was by taking
their pictures with a Polaroid camera. The younger chil-


Basu
dren watched intently as the pictures
developed, she said. The older kids
pretended not to care but enjoyed
the attention.
"In a personal sense, it was really
hard because I'm not a lot older than
these kids," Basu said.
According to Basu, the criminal
detention centers were difficult to
face on a daily basis. The detained
children had nothing to do and little
freedom, a situation often made
worse by dangerous conditions. In
the case of a fire, the centers offered
no escape, she added.
"It was hard to go back and face
that every day," Basu said.
Some of the children in detention
centers had engaged in serious crim
inal activities such as armed robbery.
Others were sent there for commit
ting petty crimes like stealing food.

Hut incarceration also could result
from improper documentation.
In Russia, it is necessary to carry
housing documents, similar to an in
ternal passport, in order to travel
from city to city. Since many chil
dren don't have homes in the first
place, they can be arrested for not
having papers. Basu explained.
Moscow and St. Petersburg also
react to the problem of street chil
dren in different ways.
When Moscow celebrated its
Ks()th anniversary last year, people
from all over the world visited the
city, limiting the space for the chil
dren. In her research, Basu found
that many children had been pulled
off the streets and sent to detention
centers outside the city during the
celebrations.
The organizations and shelters in
St. Petersburg were more responsive
to establishing a relationship with
needy kids, she said.
Basu attributes the origin of the

large number of Russian children on
the streets to alcoholism, domestic
violence and structural problems.
"There's not a lot of money for so
cial safety nets," Basu said. "Street
kids are a small subpopulation."
Basu hopes her research — the
first round of data collected on the
subject — will make a difference.
Currently, she is using her re
search as part of her honor's thesis
and as a program proposal for
IJNICEF.
"Ultimately, I'd like to see my
project turn into a program for
health services for kids and to do fur
ther research as to what diseases to
target." Basu said.
One in six of the kids in Basu's
sample used IV drugs.
Basu would eventually like to
work abroad helping underprivileged
children with health-care problems.
"Some of the kids are amazing,
and 1 learned more than I could give
back in a concrete way," she said.
