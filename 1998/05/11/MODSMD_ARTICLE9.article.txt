## Sinn Fein backs Irish peace agreement 
### 
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) — Sinn Fein
leader (Jerry Adams led his IRA-allied
party down the road from revolution to
reform yesterday, winning full backing for
the Northern Ireland peace accord against
the odds of history.
In a fundamental reversal of decades
old policy, 331 out of 350 Sinn Fein
activists voted to let their leaders partic
ipate in a new compromise administration
for Northern Ireland.
The verdict followed several hours of
public debate at the Royal Dublin Society
hall.
Sinn Fein's warm, if belated, embrace
of the accord may not make ratification of
the deal any easier in May 22 public refcr
endums. Although Northern Ireland's
main Protestant party, the Ulster Union
ists, approved it last month, many Protes
tants will oppose any deal deemed accept
able to Sinn Fein.
Still, the decisive outcome marked a
personal triumph for Adams, who since
taking charge of Sinn Fein in IS)S3 has
inched the party slowly out of isolation
while averting potentially deadly splits in

the Sinn Fein-Irish Republican Army
movement.
"Today, we cleared the way for the
future. Tomorrow, we start to build the
future." Adams told 1 .(KM) cheering dele
gates.
Adams emphasized that the decision
doesn't mean Sinn Fein accepted the right
of Northern Ireland to exist, even though
he is now free to help govern it.
That key issue has driven the past 30
years of bloodshed - and is spurring dis
sidents to try to wreck the IRA cease-fire
of July 1997.
During the conference. IRA dissidents
claimed responsibility for firing two mor
tar shells at a police barracks in the North
ern Ireland border town ol Belleek. injur
ing no one. On Saturday, in their first pub
lic statement, they called the truce "over"
and accused Adams of taking Sinn Fein
down the road of accepting Ireland's par
tition.
Because of the potential for such splits.
Adams had delayed formally accepting
the compromise accord reached April 10
with the British and Irish governments

and seven other Northern Ireland parties.
British Prime Minister lony Blair wel
comed Sinn Fein's decision. "It means
Sinn Fein has signed up to a process in
which there is no place whatsoever for vio
lence or the threat of violence." his office
said in a statement.
Adams and Martin McGuinness, Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator, offered polite
applause to about a dozen speakers who
bluntly opposed changing Sinn Fein's pol
icy of boycotting government institutions
in Northern Ireland, a Protestant-majority
state founded in 1920.
"Your beliefs are born in your heart,
your strategies in your head. When the
two collide, something has to give," said
John Murphy, a Sinn Fein activist in his
mid-2(K from the Irish Republic border
town of Monaghan who wanted to reject
the agreement.
Hut for most IRA supporters, the head
prevailed. Sinn Fein leaders argued that
Sinn Fein had to sit on the proposed 1()8-
seat Assembly in Bellast, which would be
overseen by a 12-strong Executive from
several parties including Sinn Fein.
