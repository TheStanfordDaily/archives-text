TONIGHT @ 7:3(1 PM - KATIIRYN GUSTAFSON
Kathryn Gustafson is an American-born, Paris-educated landscape architect and
environmental artist who has been practicing since 1980, primarily in France.
Before graduating from the Ecole Nationale Superieure du Paysage in Versailles,
Ms. Gustafson studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and
worked as a stylist for 7 years both in Paris and New York.
Gustafson's work has been predominantly civic, institutional, and corporate,
including parks, gardens and community spaces. As an environmental artist, she
has worked on projects addressing the impact of massive infrastructures on the
landscape. She has managed, throughout her career, to create spaces that are
rooted in Modernist abstraction and derive from her intuition, memory and
emotion with respect to the site.
