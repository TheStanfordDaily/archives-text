# Housing top concern for grad students
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
Four out of five graduate students feel that the Uni
versity does not do enough to meet housing demands,
according to a recent survey.
The results came from the online housing survey by
the Graduate Student Council and the ASSIJ Task
Force on Graduate Student Housing. A total of 2,115
students responded to the survey â€” nearly 30 percent
of the total graduate population.
Separate versions of the survey were available for
on-campus and off-campus students.
"It's amazing how many responses we got," said
Stephanie Touring, a doctoral student and one of the
organizers of the survey. "We're really excited about
the results."
The survey asked for the students' opinions on their
housing situation. Other issues addressed were isola
tion within the graduate student community, availabil
ity of parking spaces and the future of graduate resi
dential assistants.
According to Touring, more than 130 pages of com
ments were received during the survey.
"Ine issues touch people in so many ways," said
doctoral student Alane Murdock.
"In general, people are worried about moving off
campus" because of high rents and isolation, Murdock
said. Comments from students reflected feelings of
deep frustration and isolation within the graduate stu
dent population.
"Some of the stories are pretty depressing," Tour
ing said.
In one survey, a student described how he looked at
more than 200 different apartments off campus before
finding one that was affordable.
Another student said, "Graduate students are adult
human beings and deserve to be treated as such."
Most students were dissatisfied with the administra
tion's efforts to address the housing situation. Many of
the comments were aimed at a recent decision to put
graduate students in one-room doubles and two-room
triples.
James Maricondo, who will be a coterminal student
next year, said, it "really wouldn't be as appealing" to
have to share a room as a graduate student.
The survey also showed that 90 percent of students
think the University should seek more student input on
housing matters. Many students pointed to the dis
crepancy between the cost of living and their Stanford
stipends.
"A lot of people said more
housing is needed," Touring said.
Some students even recommended
bringing back the Manzanita trail
er park, which was demolished to
make room for the new Schwab
Residential Learning Center.
Some students feel that the poor
housing situation will deter talent
ed students from attending Stan

ford and hurt the school's alumni
fund-raising efforts. Others added
that the administration's student
housing policies show a blatant dis
regard for the well-being of the
community.
The survey also showed that 85
percent of the students living on
campus think that graduate RAs
should be kept. Students said grad
uate RAs are helpful in emergency
situations and for providing infor
mation about on-campus activities.
According to the survey, half of
all graduate students feel isolated

froni the Stanford community.
The survey's sponsors offered
awards to participants. The grand
prize winner was Nikhila Pai, a
doctoral student in English. The
other cash prizewinners were
Doug Kusyk. David Atencio,
Derek Gurney and Maricondo.
A full survey report will be com
piled by the task force and sent to
administrators.
