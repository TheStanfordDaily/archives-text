# Postal rate raise approved

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Stamps are
going up a penny, to 33 cents, for the millions
of letters, birthday cards and other first-class
mail Americans send every day. Packages will
cost more. too. but vacation postcards will
stay at 20 cents.
The question now is when the new rates
will take effect. The independent Postal Rate
Commission grudgingly granted much of the
post office's request for higher prices yester
day. But it said there is no need to make the
changes until 1999 because the Postal Service
has been making profits of better than $1 bil
lion a year since the last increase in 1995.

Setting the date is up to the Postal Ser
vice's governing board, which meets in early
June. Yesterday's action did not involve rates
for international mail, which are set by the
postal governing board. In the piist. the board
has often subsequently changed international
rates to reflect adjustments in domestic rates.
While it agreed to the increase in the basic
first-class rate, the commission recommended
cutting the cost of each extra ounce from 23
cents to 22 cents. That means the price of send
ing a 1-ounce letter would rise to 33 cents, a 2-
ouncc missive would remain 55 cents. Any
thing heavier would cost less than at present.
