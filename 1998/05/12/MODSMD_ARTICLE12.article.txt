NHW DELHI, India (AP)
India set off three underground
nuclear blasts yesterday and
announced it was capable o! making
nuclear weapons, enraging its neigh
bor and rival. Pakistan, and defying
a worldwide campaign to contain
the spread of nuclear arms.
India's 1-month-old government,
led by the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party, surprised
allies and enemies alike with the
nation's first nuclear tests in 24
years.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vaj
payee summoned reporters to his
home to reveal that India had con
ducted three underground nuclear
tests in the desert 330 miles south
west of New Delhi.
No radiation was released into
the atmosphere, he insisted, adding
that scientists tested a fission device,
a low-yield device and a thermonu
clear device. He refused to answer
questions. India's ambassador to the
United States said India was not
planning an extensive nuclear
weapons program.
India did not comment on the

size of the explosion. The Swiss Fed
eral Institute of Technology said its
earthquake-measuring devices put
the magnitude at 5.2. which it said
would he equal to about 10 kilotons
of TNT. The U.S. atomic bomb that
devastated Hiroshima, Japan, was
the equivalent of about 15 kilotons.
Pakistan, also believed to have
nuclear capability, immediately
pledged to make its defenses
"impregnable against any Indian
threat, be it nuclear or convention
al."
"The responsibility for dealing a
death blow to the global efforts at
nuclear nonproliferation rests
squarely with India," Pakistani For
eign Minister Gauhar Ayub told
lawmakers in the Pakistani capital
of Islamabad.
The United States expressed its
disappointment but did not say if it
would ban aid or impose sanctions
to keep sophisticated technology
out of India.
" This runs counter to the effort
the international community is mak
ing to promulgate a comprehensive
ban on such testing." Clinton

spokesman Mike McCurry said in
Washington.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called for "maximum
restraint" from countries in the
region and said the explosions vio
lated an international understand
ing.
The U.N. statement noted that
India had not signed the Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty, adopted in
September 19% by the U.N. Gener
al Assembly. The treaty, which has
not taken force, would ban all nucle
ar tests.
It was signed by all five nations
that acknowledge holding nuclear
weapons â€” the United States.
Britain. France. China and Russia.
Despite the angry reaction. Indi
an officials were clearly in a celebra
tory mood, handing out sweets to
reporters at a news conference.
"We have taken economic reper
cussions into account. We will not
face any problems." said Brajesh
Mishra. an aide to the prime minis
ter. "These tests have established
that India has a proven capability
for a weanonized nuclear nroeram."
