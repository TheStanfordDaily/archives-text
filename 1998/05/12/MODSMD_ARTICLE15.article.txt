ASSU senators should
attend tonight's meeting
and validate the election

Remember the campaign
frenzy last month? There
were fliers in every dorm and
pictures of elated newly elected
ASSU members on the front page of
The Daily. That frenzy will fizzle if
the ASSU doesn't wrest itself from
inaction.
Tonight, the current ASSU senate
will convene. Let's hope it reaches
quorum this time. Until the election
is validated and certified, the newly
elected president, vice president and
senators cannot take office. These
actions are the responsibility of the
current senate.
At last week's meeting, validation
was on the agenda. But so few sena
tors attended that quorum was not
reached. No votes were taken, so the
new ASSU will not meet for at least
another two weeks.
The president and vice president
have served in the senate and under
stand that poor attendance is a prob
lem the organization perenially faces.
They may even have plans to change
that fact.
However, incoming senators might
not understand the ASSU as well.
They campaigned with enthusiasm
and were excited to be elected. They
are mostly freshmen and sophomores
and may believe that the ASSU is a
dynamic, or at least productive, orga
nization. That enthusiasm is slowlv

dissipating as the current senate fails
to do one of its final tasks.
The poor attendance record of cur
rent senators sends a negative mes
sage to impressionable new senators.
On the most basic level, it suggests
that the ASSU can't get anything
done; even something as basic as a
procedural vote.
Second, new Senators receive the
message that bv the time the ASSU
does do something, it's too late. Even
if enough people come to meetings
tonight and next week to validate and
certify election results, by the time
the senate can meet, senators will be
concentrating on finals, term papers
and projects.
They won't be able to learn much
about the senate in the crunch time at
the end of the quarter.
Third, poor attendance suggests to
new senators that old senators don't
value their jobs or consider the
ASSU a priority. They can't even
take the time on a Tuesday night sev
eral times a month to show up at a
meeting. It suggests to new senators
that it's alright to slack off because
nobody will care.
We hope that incoming ASSU offi
cers and senators do care. That's why
students elected them, and that's why
they should take office.
We urge all current ASSU sena
tors to attend tonight's meeting. It
may be slow and it may be dull. But
think about it from the practical per
spective. As long as you fail to show
up. your terms will drag on and you
will prevent the new ASSU from tak
ing office.
