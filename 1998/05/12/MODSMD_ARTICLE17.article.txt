## Thesis insanity at crunch time

the pain

Perhaps you have heard
these very words around
campus, faint whimpers
emanating from the South
Mezzanine of Green
Library or the Tresidder

LAIR.
Most undergraduate honors theses are
due this week, and all the work we promised
to get done months in advance is being
crammed into a few weeks of concentrated
insanity. Some folks wrote page one last
week. Their cries of pain are among the
loudest.
I wrote mine months ago ... in my head.
Unfortunately, there are significant discrep
ancies between my thoughts and the actual
words on the page. Right now I'm knee
deep in library books, my overdue fines at
Green paled only by the amounts I have
spent on print quota. I've gone through
enough fluorescent Post-it notes to stock the
entire offices of Old Union, and my com
plexion is beginning to resemble the color of
my computer monitor.
True, there are moments of transcen
dence, when an original thought works its
way onto the written page. However, as the
deadline gets closer, those moments seem
fewer and more removed. Lately I've been
struck by the urge to toss my laptop out of
my third-floor window — an urge barely

satiated at Flicks when I threw wads of my
rough drafts at unsuspecting moviegoers.
I'm sure all thesis-writers have felt these
fluctuations between elation and depres
sion, writing brilliantly one moment, want
ing to spit blood the next. Perhaps some
masochistic impulse compels us to keep
writing, researching, pulling all-nighters just
to gather another set of data or get the con
clusion just right.
Strangely, with the deadline just three
days away, I only have one regret: I wish I
could explain my work to more people.
That's not to say that my work is terrifi
cally complex or well above the comprehen
sion level of those around me. In fact, every
three minutes another person asks me what
my topic covers. At first I gave a 10-minute
answer, talking incessantly about American
authors in the early 20th century, mentally
rehearsing what I was preparing to write.
Now I find myself replying to these same
questions with a terse "William Faulkner"
or worse yet "William Faulkner and his rela
tionship with the writings of Harold Bloom,
Paul de Man, Nietzsche and Freud" (an
answer which invariably drives the innocent
questioner screaming out of the room). Part
of this isolation is my inability to express my
own ideas. I'm so close to my work that it's
difficult to explain it to others.
However, I think these feelings are symp
tomatic of a larger trend at Stanford — the
lack of an undergraduate academic commu
nity. I came here half expecting arguments

about Marx at the dinner table and discus
sions about Kant and Kafka spilling out of
dorm rooms. For the most part. I've been
sorely disappointed.
Instead, students shy away from each
other's intellectual and philosophical con
victions, eschewing confrontation in order to
maintain a placid atmosphere of mutual
accord. Long, awkward silences are the
norm in discussion sections. We jealously
guard paper topics, lest someone in our sec
tion "steal" our ideas. Group projects in the
humanities are almost unheard of.
A spirited conversation with my peers
would have proved infinitely more useful
than the hours I sealed myself off from the
world doing research. Of course, there
comes a time when we have to write instead
of discuss, where the specificity of our own
research cuts us off from our peers. Howev
er, I wish I could recover some of those
moments at the project's inception and col
laborate more with my peers.
This Friday afternoon I will be relaxing
on the front lawn of Kimball, drinking a gin
and tonic and smoking a cigar, trying to
recover some of my former pigmentation.
Perhaps some people will want to know
what the party is all about.
I'll be more than happy to tell them.
