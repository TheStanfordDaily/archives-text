Stop brutal treatment
Aly Remtulla's column in last Monday's
Daily has drawn a torrent of criticism
denouncing him as uneducated and simplis
tic. This is an unfair analysis.
The situation in Israel is as complex as
any human situation.
However, Mr. Remtulla's column gave a
different perspective on the situation than
the one presented by the 50th anniversary
celebrations.
From any perspective, what the Israeli
government has done to the Palestinians in
the Occupied Territories is unconscionable.
Palestinians of all ages are routinely
harassed, arrested, held without bail or trial,
tortured, denied fundamental human rights
and assassinated.
Palestinians are forced to live as
oppressed second-class citizens in a land
that is just as holy to them as it is to Jewish
Israelis. Israel justifies this in the name of
security.
I have no wish to make statements about
which group has the more legitimate claim
to the region — clearly both cultures value
the land.
What is wrong, and what is supremely

racist, is the claim that only Israelis deserve
to live in the region, and that they (as the
more powerful group) have no mandate to
ensure Palestinian rights and culture.
If Israelis truly want peace, the easiest
road to their goal is not the brutalization of
a people.
They must stop bulldozing Palestinian
homes. They must end the military pres
ence in the Occupied Territories. They
must make every effort to include Palestini
ans in the government of the region.
They must make every effort to fully
redress the wrongs done to the Palestinian
people.
Israel may have a lot to celebrate, but
the present celebrations are little more than
a mask for 50 years of oppression that needs
to be identified, understood and acted
upon.

Trying a beer today
On behalf of most of the readers of The
Daily. I would like to thank Aly Remtulla
for changing my perspective on life. It had

never previously occurred to me that
there are more important things than
grades, internships and lucrative careers.
Nor would I have ever looked for ful
fillment in anything beyond my economics
textbook.
However, Aly's innovative notion of
seizing the day, of finding pleasure in all
parts of life, of living each day as though it
were my last, has truly captured my inter
est and my soul.
Schoolwork and careers now come sec
ond in my book, right after "happiness." I
think I will try a beer today.
