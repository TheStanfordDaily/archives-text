# Showering with the boys
## Coolness counts: revisiting junior high 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

THIS WEEKEND I was 17 all over
again. For an evening I returned to the
land of soeial awkwardness, where
everyone works hard to act way too cool.
Being a dashing woman with many seem
ingly useless skills, I often find myself making
cash in some of the most obscure ways. This
weekend I filled in for a local youth orches
tra that was short a percussionist.
Such an engagement is not all that unusu
al in the life of a music major. Calls come in
from everywhere, San Jose to San Francisco.
Most aren't glamorous, but they are a good
way to get to play and pay for dinner.
So while most of the campus was heading
off to the senior formal, I passed over my
long, green sequin gown for full blacks.
Black skirl, black nylons, black shirt. I
looked ready for the streets of New York.
Arriving at the performance center, I
found the director, who gave me my music.
Being schooled in works from Beethoven to
Berio. I felt ready for anything.
The conductor told me we'd start in a half
hour, so I went to the rehearsal hall and took
a seat in the back. 1 began looking over the

mallet part for the ever-so-moving "Themes
from Jurassic Park" and the timpani part to
the always exciting "James Bond Medley."
Members of the orchestra began to drift in.
Forty kids from seventh to 12th grade
straggled through the doors in their concert
best, lugging instruments, stands, bows, reeds
and cello cases weighing half their body
weight.
I felt a rush of nostalgia. Of being 14
again. Of dressing up and playing music. Of
taking myself and other adolescents so darn
seriously.
I watched a boy and a girl talking in a cor
ner, the boy leaning on the wall, trying hard
to look cool in his oversized tux. The girl,
with her Jennifer Aniston hair and 2-inch
soled shoes, played with her bow and gazed
around the room, apparently disinterested in
the works of the compact Casanova.
An oboist, apparently the leader of her
section, began yelling, trying to get some
attention as two other members of the wood
wind section remained deaf to her pleas.
They had thrown off their jackets and were
whacking the crap out of each other with

their collapsible metal stands.
I tried my best to blend in as the group
pulled itself together, but it wasn't long
before they sniffed me out. As The Outsider,
1 was quickly identified and began receiving
scattered looks. For some reason the tall
blond girl sitting in back holding mallets and
grinning didn't look like one of the team.
Two boys wielding violas began whisper
ing. pointed at me and then started laughing.
I blushed and looked down at my music, a lit
tle flustered that these pint-si/.ed people
could make me feel self-conscious.
As I diligently attempted to absorb the
intricacies of the timpani part to "Live and
Let Die," I felt a tap on my shoulder.
I looked up and found a boy standing in
front of me. holding a stand and wearing a
suit bought to be grown into.
"Hey," he said, flashing a dazzling braces
laden smile.
"Hey," 1 responded.
"What's up?"
"Not much," I said.
He looked at the pile of sticks on my lap
and said, "Percussion?"

"Yup."
"I play the clarinet. Section leader."
"Cool," I said.
"My name is Josh. I go to Paly. I'm 17 and
I have my driver's license."
"Really," I said. "Well, my name is
Vanessa, I'm in college and my boyfriend is
22."
"Oh," he said.
"So, do you know those two girls down
there?" I said, glancing at a couple of big
haired French horn players who were talking
to each other, flashing me a "Just-who-do
you-think-YOU-are" look.
"Yeah. 1 guess. I'm sorta. ya know, seeing
one of 'em. You know how it is."
"Yeah, I guess."
I"he conductor walked in. My clarinetist
gave me a sly nod and said. "Well. I probably
should go."
As he returned to his seat, the first French
horn player sent me one last dirty look.
Soon we headed to the concert hall and
began our portion of the program. The
group played its heart out. I have never
heard the James Bond theme song sound

quite like that.
I got caught up in the energy. I muddled
through my parts, madly sight reading and
watching the conductor like a hawk, grateful
for his deliberate downbeats.
When we finished, the audience of par
ents and families clapped. We took a bow.
As the members of the group found their
families and ran off to eat ice cream and be
cool. I headed for my car.
Before I left I saw the French horn player
corner my clarinetist and give him a kiss. The
woodwind boys again started cracking each
other over the head with their stands. And
the violinist struggled to look cool in his size
t(x>-large tux.
As I got in my car. the clarinetist shot me
one last wink I turned the ignition and said a
prayer, thankful that I had survived 17 and
ended up as normal as I am. It's not easy
being cool. And one night made me remem
ber whv vou couldn't pav me to do it again.
