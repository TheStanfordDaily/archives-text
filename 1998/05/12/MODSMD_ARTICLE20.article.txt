■ Last night: No. 7 USC 5, No. 1
Stanford 1.

set a new one. With a win over
No. 2 USC last night at Sunken
Diamond, No. 1 Stanford would
have become the first Cardinal
squad to have won every series
the team entered.
There was only one problem.

The Cardinal needed to score
more than one run. So in the
end. the Cardinal fell to the Tro

ference Southern Division) by a
score of 5-1.
In the long run. however, a
win last night didn't mean too
much. The Cardinal (41-10-1,
22-8) had already clinched the
Six-Pac title and a shot at the
Pac-10 Championship May 14-
16 in Seattle.
Additionally, the NCAA an
nounced yesterday that the Car
dinal squad will host its third
