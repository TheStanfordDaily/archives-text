They've set a lot of records

■ Last night: No. 7 USC 5, No. 1
Stanford 1.

And last night, they almost
set a new one. With a win over
No. 2 USC last night at Sunken
Diamond, No. 1 Stanford would
have become the first Cardinal
squad to have won every series
the team entered.
There was only one problem.

The Cardinal needed to score
more than one run. So in the
end. the Cardinal fell to the Tro
jans (39-14, 21-9 Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division) by a
score of 5-1.
In the long run. however, a
win last night didn't mean too
much. The Cardinal (41-10-1,
22-8) had already clinched the
Six-Pac title and a shot at the
Pac-10 Championship May 14-
16 in Seattle.

Regional Tournament May 21-24.
The pairings for the regional will
be announced on Monday. May 18
at noon.
"We're extremely excited to
once again have the opportunity to
host an NCAA Regional at
Sunken Diamond." said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "Ob
viously we feel that playing at
home is an advantage in our drive
to the College World Series."
Stanford has compiled a 20-3
record in regional games at
Sunken.
The loss to USC bothered Mar
quess for reasons of pride, howev
er.
"We're disappointed because
this is the first series we've lost all
year." Marquess said. "But I don't
think we're going to stay focused
on that very long, whereas we've
got to get ready to play and gener
ate some offense."
Indeed, the only Cardinal run
of the night belonged to first base
man John Gall. The sophomore
smashed his 12th home run of the

season over the left field fence on a
1-0 count in the first to give Stan
ford an early 1-0 lead.
But junior left-hander Brent
Hoard struggled on the mound, al
lowing the Trojans to capitalize
with two runs in the top of the sec
ond.
Third baseman Morgan Ens
berg and shortstop Seth Davidson
crossed the plate in the inning, and
the Cardinal bullpen immediately
revved its engines.
By contrast, the IJSC pitching
arsenal remained motionless as
right-hander Mike Penney
blanked the Cardinal offense for
the rest of the game.
The Trojan push continued
when Trojan left fielder Jason
Lane stole home in the top of the
fourth after being walked by Car
dinal freshman reliever Brad
Drew.
And still the Cardinal bats re
mained speechless. In fact, they
seemed to have gone on a tempo
rary hiatus.
Meanwhile, the Trojan scoring
deluge continued. IJSC designated
hitter Jeremy Freitas and right
fielder Brad Ticehurst scored in
the sixth, augmenting the Trojan
lead to 5-1.
They've set a lot of records
