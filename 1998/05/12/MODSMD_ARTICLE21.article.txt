# Crown for rugby is first ever
## But the road map shows more successes ahead for the women

They've come a long way. baby.
Only a couple of years ago, the Stanford
women's rugby team would get slaughtered bv the
East Coast teams every time it traveled to the na
tional championship tournament.
Not this year.
This year, the Card beat Illinois 35-4 to win the
national championship for the first time in history.
"It was incredible," said team president Lara
Strauss, a junior. "I was bawling because I was so
excited that we had come so far. We totally de
served it, and I was so proud to be a part of it."
Women's rugby has been gaining momentum
in the Bay Area in the past couple of years — six
new teams formed this year alone, and club actic>n
has been getting more intense. Traditionally an
East Coast-dominated sport. West Coast teams
are etching their place among the big leaguers.

As West ( oast rugby grows, "the competition
grows and the league gets better," said senior cap
tain Susie Hoffman. "In the past. Pacific Coast
teams were creamed, so for us to win and win so
definitively is great."
The championship was a culmination of three
years of hard work by a core group of juniors and
two seniors. The experience of the upperclassmen
and the enthusiasm and youth of the rookies
proved to be a winning combination.
This year, Hoffman, junior Sue Landsittel and
freshman Brittney Blunt were recognized with
All-America honors.
"Everybody made a difference," Strauss said.
"We had two phenomenal seniors in solid posi
tions and then four or five rookies who just start
ed playing in other key positions."
Since most Stanford students have never
played rugby before, part of the challenge for the
team is learning how to play the game.
"Everybody knows nobody has played it be

fore, and the upperelassmen were so awesome
about helping out." Blunt said.
A three-sport athlete in high school, Blunt
wanted to try something new when she got to
Stanford. She was ultimately turned on to rugby
because her brother — a two time All-American
and now a Stanford assistant coach enjoyed it
so much.
The team attributes much of its success to the
camaraderie it carried into the games from off the
field. The team was also able to bond and gain
valuable experience against tougher teams when
the ( ard traveled to Canada, San Diego and Seat
tle.
The squad also trained harder then ever —
whether it was sprints at noontime or a late after
noon jog — in preparation for the Final Four.
Mental training was also important.
"From the beginning of the season, everyone
wanted to make it last as long as pos
sible," Strauss said.
Much of the team's training was
self-directed, and the group's cohe
sion and fitness level eventually paid
off.
"I think all of our training, com
bined with the fact that we wanted
it more than any other team, was
what made the difference." Strauss
said.
The team's fitness was especially
beneficial because the squad had to
play two games back-to-back at the
national championship tournament.
With each game running 80 minutes,
fatigue set in for some teams. But
not for Stanford.
The future bodes well for the

Cardinal squad. However, because
of the title. Stanford will move up
from the plate division — a less chal
lenging league for rugby upstarts —
to the cup division, where the team
will find tougher competition.
With only two graduating se
niors, a core group of juniors who
have been playing for three years
and the talented freshmen from this
year, another title doesn't seem un
realistic. The squad will gain some
international experience during a
tour this summer in Fiji and New
Zealand.
"Next year will be great," Hoff
man said. "We need more people
to form another core group to con
tinue the development of the team
and establish a larger base. 1 think
this year and next year's team will
leave a Stanford women's rugby
legacy."
