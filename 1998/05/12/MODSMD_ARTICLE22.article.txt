# Team fought through triple bypass
## Men's golf faced a bumpy season 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Despite a disappointing finish,
the Stanford men's golf team had a
successful season, considering the
obstacles it had to overcome.
Teamwork and the individual ef
forts of junior Joel Kribel made the
difference as the Cardinal worked
toward a sixth-place finish at the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championship
last week.
Unfortunately, the performance
was not enough to win a spot at the
NCAA West Regional tournament,
but head coach Wally Goodwin
who suffered a heart attack early in
the year — called the season a suc
cess.
"Under the circumstances, the
guys turned out as good a season as
could be expected." Goodwin said.
()>ercoming a crisis
Goodwin first suffered a heart at
tack at the William H. Tucker Invi
tational at Championship Golf
Course in Albuquerque. N.M., on
Sept. iy.
"I first thought it was indigestion
in Albuquerque, where Joel | kri

bel] played badlv — that was really
his only had tournament." Goodwin
said. "We flew from there to Sacra
mento for I Jniversity of the Pacific's
tournament, where it really hit me
again."
Goodwin immediately under
went triple bypass surgery, which
kept him sidelined for several
weeks. Fortunately, the coach has
made consistent progress and ap
pears to be in good health.
"I've made a great recovery , and
1 feel wonderful." he said. "It was
just a small setback."
In the meantime. El Nino
wreaked havoc on the team's sched
ule. canceling practices and tourna
ments alike.
"We just never got to play or
practice over the fall because of the
rain." Goodwin said. "We only got
to play a few times in February, so
we went to (the UTEP Intercolle
giate Tournament in El Paso.
Texas,] unprepared. We didn't real
ly get under way until just before
spring break."

10 Championship at the end of April, was one of the brightest spots
in the Cardinal's season. Stanford finished sixth.
nament at the Sandpiper Golf
Course in Santa Barbara and fourth
at the Antf.ater Invitational in Coto
De Caza. Calif.
"Once we got going. I could see
there was a light that was going to go
on." Goodwin said. "We made
progress up to the Pac-lOs, and we
went into them ranked 13th."
The team probably needed a top
four finish to crack the top 12 roster
for regionals.
"It was an exciting first day at
Pac-lOs because we led." Goodwin
said. "Joel had a good tournament.
We took sixth, but that wasn't good
enough to get us into the top 12."
krihel anchored team
Kribel led the team all year, fin
ishing with a team-high nine top-10
finishes. He won the Ping Arizona
Intercollegiate Tournament, im
proving every day with a career-best
13-under-par 2(H) ((SB-67-f>s).
After missing the U.S. Intercolle
giate because of the Masters in Au
gusta. Ga., — where he missed the
cut by a stroke — Kribel took second

at the Pac-lOs with a four-round
final score of 285.
"Joel's had a great year." Good
win said.
After a slow start. Kribel's victo
ry in Arizona launched a string of
top-10 finishes, interrupted only by
the Masters.
"I didn't have a very good fall
season." Kribel said. "To come out
and win the first spring tournament
was great."
Wait until next year
"I have wonderful hopes about
next year. We lose our captain [se
nior] Eri Crum, but everyone else is
back." Goodwin said. "We have a
wonderful schedule coming up next
year because it's Joel Kribel's last
year, and everyone wants him at
their tournament."
The recruiting class for next year
is strong as well, and it would appear
that Cardinal golf can look forward
to "three or four great years." Good
win said.
"We've got three or four good
guys coming in next year — a really
strong recruiting class," he said. "I
think we're on one of those rocket
deals going upward. I'm really en
thusiastic."
