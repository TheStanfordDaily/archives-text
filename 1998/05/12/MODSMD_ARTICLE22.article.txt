### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Despite a disappointing finish,
the Stanford men's golf team had a
successful season, considering the
obstacles it had to overcome.
Teamwork and the individual ef
forts of junior Joel Kribel made the
difference as the Cardinal worked
toward a sixth-place finish at the Pa
cific 10 Conference Championship
last week.
Unfortunately, the performance
was not enough to win a spot at the
NCAA West Regional tournament,
but head coach Wally Goodwin
who suffered a heart attack early in
the year — called the season a suc
cess.
"Under the circumstances, the
guys turned out as good a season as
could be expected." Goodwin said.

Goodwin first suffered a heart at
tack at the William H. Tucker Invi
tational at Championship Golf
Course in Albuquerque. N.M., on
Sept. iy.
"I first thought it was indigestion
in Albuquerque, where Joel | kri

bel] played badlv — that was really
his only had tournament." Goodwin
said. "We flew from there to Sacra
mento for I Jniversity of the Pacific's
tournament, where it really hit me
again."
Goodwin immediately under
went triple bypass surgery, which
kept him sidelined for several
weeks. Fortunately, the coach has
made consistent progress and ap
pears to be in good health.
"I've made a great recovery , and
1 feel wonderful." he said. "It was
just a small setback."
In the meantime. El Nino
wreaked havoc on the team's sched
ule. canceling practices and tourna
ments alike.
"We just never got to play or
practice over the fall because of the
rain." Goodwin said. "We only got
to play a few times in February, so
we went to (the UTEP Intercolle
giate Tournament in El Paso.

ly get under way until just before
spring break."
