ULTIMATE FRISBEE
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford men's
and women's A teams advance to
nationals after wins at the I'ltimate
regionals in Santa Cruz.

After two days of intense compe
tition. the Stanford men's and
women's I'ltimate A teams
emerged as the top-ranked teams in
the nation.
Saturday, the first day of the
tournament, was conducted in pixil
play. Each game had a two-hour
time limit, with the win going to the
first team to hit 13 points.
Unfortunately, the Stanford
women's A team had to face the
Stanford H team, which it beat 13-0.
Then, the San Diego B team forfeit
ed its game to the Card
The I Jniversity of British C'olum
bia was the next team to fall, with an
11 -3 defeat. Stanford would claim its

last victim of the day with a 13-3 vic
tor) over I.as Pocitas College.
While other teams were adverse
ly affected by high winds at Santa
Cru/. the Card women capitalized
on the conditions. The Stanford
zone defense worked beautifully all
day. forcing opponents to throw
high-risk passes that could be easily
turned over.
British Columbia also attempted
to use zone defense, but it lacked
one huge advantage: precision
throwing. That was the Card's
biggest edge. Stanford was able to
read the wind and throw accurately.
Double-elimination play was
held Sunday. While the two-hour
time limit remained, the score cap
was raised to 15.
The Stanford women met UC-
Santa Barbara in the quarterfinals
and blew the Gauchos away 13-2.
Stanford then moved on to defeat
California 15-4 in the semifinals.
The closest game of the day came
from a team Stanford had already
defeated the day before — British
Columbia. l"his time the Card was
only able to win by nine with a 15-6
victory.
Stanford's depth made a huge
difference in facilitating the Card's
wins. The Stanford bench is so good
that it can defeat any team regional
ly ranked from six to 10 without the
help of the starting line.
When Stanford actually met the
top-ranked teams, the Card would
face a worn-out opponent with a
fresh starting line. This especially
became a major factor in the two
day tournament.
Despite the blowouts indicated
by the scores, the games were actu
ally very high energy. The Stanford
women still took dives for layout de
fensive plays. According to head
coach Jennifer Donnelly, that is the
secret to the Card's success.
"We take every team seriously,"
Donnelly said. "We respect every
team. We treat them like they can
beat us. It is hard to stay at the top of
the ladder. We have to take every
game seriously, and that's why we
win."
Stanford and Oregon are the
two teams who will move onto na

tionals.
The Stanford men's A team mir
rored the women's success with a
flawless regional run.
In the first day of pool play, Stan
ford easily took care of Oregon and
Washington with 13-5 and 13-2
wins.
The Card faced UC-Santa Cruz
in the third game. With the score
tied at eight and the cap put at nine,
the Card was pinned at its end of the
field. Senior Justin Deng threw a
full field huck to graduate student
Mike Chevalier, who jumped two
feet over his defender to complete
the victory.
Stanford finished off pool play
by defeating Northern Arizona
13-7.
Stanford played with unbeliev
ably intensity. The team added new
meaning to layout defense. Hori
zontal dives became an art form.
Everyone from the starting line to
the bench treated each point as if it
was the last.
While the Card began with zone
defense, it quickly adapted to man
to-man defense when the former

didn't prove effective.
Both the women's Ultimate
teams and the men's B team were
out there supporting, cheering
and pumping up the men on the
field.
The momentum carried over
into the double-elimination rounds
on Sunday.
Stanford met Las Pocitas in the
quarterfinals. With the score tied at
7-7, the Card finally found the
rhythm to pull away to a 15-K win.
In the semifinals, Stanford came
out strong with a 6-1 lead. Despite a
strong run. I JC-San Diego never re
gained the lead and fell in a 9-5 de
feat to the Card.
Stanford faced top-ranked Santa
Barbara in the finals. The Gauchos
came out strong with a three-point
lead against the Card.
Stanford fought back to tie the
score at four, then five. Unfortu
nately, the momentum didn't last, as
Stanford fell behind by three.
But the Card wouldn't give up
the match that easily. Stanford
clawed back to tie the match at
eight, with the cap put at 10.

Santa Barbara had possession
near the Stanford goal zone. The
Gauchos were pumped and played
with renewed confidence.
Both teams were exhausted at
the end of a two-day tournament.
Santa Barbara managed to find a
gap in the Stanford defense for a
long run-down pass.
Realizing the game was at stake,
senior Wally Tseng dove from be
hind his opponent while on the run
to catch the disc six inches off the
ground right in front of the Stanford
goal.
From there, the tides of victory
swept in Stanford's favor, as the
Card defeated the top-ranked team
in the nation 10-8.
Both Ultimate teams will now
travel to Minnesota for the national
championship in three weeks.
"It was a great weekend for us."
said captain Alex Young, a senior.
"We were able to come back when
we were down, which is something
we haven't been able to do. Now we
know we can win nationals since
we've beaten the top teams in the
nation."
