## Cardinal athletes match up against nation's top competitors 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
Cardinal track athletes invited
some of the nation's top competi
tors to play in their own backyard
Friday night at the Cardinal Invita
tional held at Cobb Track and An
gell Field.
The meet, though primarily a
tune-up for the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference and NCAA meets, was
the setting for quick times and
strong marks from the many Stan
ford athletes who competed.
The unscored invitational fea
tured athletes from teams such as
Wisconsin, Florida, Colorado State
and Boise State, as well as post-col
legians sponsored by Reebok. Adi
das, and Asics shoe companies and
a host of athletes representing
Great Britain.
For the women, sophomore
jumps specialist Julie Tinker edged
junior Tara Oettinger for first place
in the long jump, with a leap of 18
feet 10 3/4 inches to 18-10. Junior
Rhonda Witmer took a decisive
win in the triple jump where she
hopped, skipped and leaped out to
a distance of 37-7 1/4. Junior
Mandv Clayton placed third in the
event with a mark of 37-0 1 / 2.
In the 3,000-meter run. fresh
man Courtney Adams appeared to
be just another contender in the
large pack chasing Michigan's
Katie McGregor, but a fearless
surge, with less than 1 ,(XM) meters to
go, put a gap between Adams and
the rest of the field.
A strong finishing push over the
last two laps helped Adams gain
ground on McGregor. Adams' fin
ishing sprint was a tremendous dis
play of strength and determination,
and although she was unable to
catch McGregor in the end. her
time of 9 minutes and 27 seconds
was enough for an NCAA provi
sional qualifier and a personal best.
In the throws, sophomore
Cassie Romuld continued her

string of solid shot put perfor
mances. as her throw of 47-3 3/4
was enough for a second-place
showing.
In the pole vault, freshman
Melissa Feinstein continued her
improvement since her return from
injury, vaulting over 12-2 1 / 4 for a
second-place finish.
The Cardinal men once again
displayed the team's trademark ex
cellence in throws and distances,
competing against collegiate all
stars from around the nation.
Junior Adam Connolly and se
nior Justin Strand destroyed the
field in the hammer throw, taking
first and second place with throws
of 221-6 and 214-5, respectively.
The 800-meter run, which was
stacked with middle distance aces
from around the nation, lived up to
its pre-meet expectations as a race
not to be missed. The race rabbit
took the runners out in a 52-second
first lap. with a tight pack of Stan
ford and Wisconsin runners, as well
as Colorado State's national indoor
mile runner-up Bryan Berrvhill. in
hot pursuit.
"1 went out like a bat out of
hell," said freshman Gabe Jen
nings, who raced alongside fellow
freshman Mark Hassell.
The rabbit dropped out at 6(X)
meters, leaving the runners in a
dogfight for the finish stripe. Berry
hill surged ahead, stringing out the
field and leaving Jennings and Has
sell to battle the remainder of the
pack from behind.
Undaunted. Jennings and Has
sell kicked in the turbos over the
last 150 meters and surged to catch
the field.
" The last turn is where I really
made my move," Jennings said. "1
must have passed half a dozen peo
ple right there."
Jennings and Hassell caught
and out-leaned the majority of the
field at the tape, finishing third and
fourth behind Berryhill and Der
rick Small from Rice. Jennings'

time of 1:48.66 was good enough
for a provisional qualifier, and Has
sell's 1:49.07 was another in a string
of personal-best efforts.
Freshman I odd Beyerlein won
the high jump for the second week
in a row, leaping over 6-8 for the
victory. Stanford throws coach and
19% Olympian Robert Weir, who
competed with the Great Britain
contingent, won the discus with a
toss of 193-1.
Cardinal athletes will now pre
pare for the Cardinal qualifier and

Pac-10 Championship which will
also be held on Stanford turf. Hep
tathletes and decathletes will com
pete Saturday against their Pac-10
rivals, and the remainder of the
Stanford team will compete in the
qualifier this week and the Pac-lOs
next week.
The Pac-10 meet promises to be
one of the most intense competi
tions the Cardinal has faced yet,
with national leaders in several
events participating. Tickets are
still available for the meet.
