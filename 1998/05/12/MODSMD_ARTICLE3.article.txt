# Phi Delts stay
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais in
formed the Phi Delta Theta fraterni
ty last night that they will keep their
house next year. However, the Uni
versity will impose sanctions on the
chapter.
"We're keeping our house, and
everyone here is very excited about
that," said Daniel Broderick, a se
nior and Phi Delt president. "We'll
be around for many years to come."
The sanctions stem from an al
leged altercation involving alcohol
on the Phi Delt Rush weekend trip
April 17-18 near Santa Cruz. One
pledge was sent to the hospital with
injuries from an alleged assault by

two other pledges. The Santa Cruz
County Sheriffs Office is in the
process of a criminal investigation.
Both Wais and the Phi Delts re
fused to comment on the specifics of
the sanctions. Hut Greek Judicial
Hoard Chair Amie Rooney, a se
nior. said measures were taken to
counter a "pattern of problems" in
the Phi Delts. She said the board bat
ted around the idea of sanctions last
ing anywhere from one to three
years: according to Rooney, Wais
was leaning toward three years.
"I believe the sanctions are fair
and appropriate given the nature of
the violation and the overall history
of the fraternity." Wais said.

Despite a Rush incident that sent one student to the hospital, Phi Delta Theta fraterni
ty will remain at its current location.
However, fraternity members
were clearly pleased with the deci
sion.
"We thought the University deci
sion was very thorough and fair."
said Jackson Wagener, a sophomore
and incoming Phi Delt president.
According to Rooney, the Phi
Delts also face a "zero tolerance"
rule — any more infractions of Uni
versity or Interfraternity Council
rules could result in a reconsidera
tion of their housing status.
"As for the future of the Phi
Delts, it's completely in their hands,"
Rooney said.
Wais said he based his decision on
four components: review and analy
sis of the Greek Judicial Board's
findings and recommendations, a re
view of the fraternity's history, a re
view of how Stanford handled simi
lar violations, and consultations wit h
various University administrators.
"By utilizing this process, what I
believe to be the right and fair deci
sion emerges," Wais said.
Wais "agreed with all the Greek

Judicial Board findings, applauded
their efforts and only changed a few
things," Rooney said. "This inci
dence is a good representation of an
incidence where the Greek Judicial
Board, the fraternity in question and
the dean [of students] are all on the
same page."
Both the hoard and Wais serious
ly considered dehousing the fraterni
ty, they said.
Wais emphasized, though, that
the Phi Delt case was markedly dif
ferent that of the Delta Kappa Ep
silon fraternity last year, when the
fraternity lost its house after an in
toxicated pledge was hospitalized.
Each case is considered on its in
dividual merits, according to Wais.
"I can assure the campus commu
nity that all of the cases that go
through this process are treated in a
consistent fashion, but they all have
very unique and individual circum
stances and organizational histo
ries," Wais said.
Rooney said the board was par
ticularly concerned about the Phi
Delts because this is not the first time
this year the fraternity has come be
fore the board.
"It was a fairly egregious thing

that happened especially in light of
the recent history of the Phi Delts,"
Rooney said. "It's no secret they had
their share of problems this year."
She added that the board is be
ginning to see improvements in Phi
Delt behavior, although those im
provements are not as well-docu
mented as the board would like.
"I hope they focus their efforts
and comply with all the sanctions,"
Wais said.
Broderick said he personally
hopes that the alleged aggressors in
the attack will be able to remain con
nected to the fraternity in the future.
Like most cases before the judi
cial board, the Phi Delt case has im
plications for the future of the entire
Greek community.
"Every time you strengthen an in
dividual chapter, you're strengthen
ing the Greek community as a
whole," Rooney noted.
Also, the case marks an increased
effort at dialogue between the dean of
students and the board. Rooney said.
Wais met with the board twice
during the Phi Delt decision-mak
ing process; he explained his deci
sion to the board before he met
with the Phi Delts.
