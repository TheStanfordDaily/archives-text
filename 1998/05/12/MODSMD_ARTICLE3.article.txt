# Phi Delts stay
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais in
formed the Phi Delta Theta fraterni
ty last night that they will keep their
house next year. However, the Uni
versity will impose sanctions on the
chapter.
"We're keeping our house, and
everyone here is very excited about
that," said Daniel Broderick, a se
nior and Phi Delt president. "We'll
be around for many years to come."
The sanctions stem from an al
leged altercation involving alcohol
on the Phi Delt Rush weekend trip
April 17-18 near Santa Cruz. One
pledge was sent to the hospital with
injuries from an alleged assault by

two other pledges. The Santa Cruz
County Sheriffs Office is in the
process of a criminal investigation.
Both Wais and the Phi Delts re
fused to comment on the specifics of
the sanctions. Hut Greek Judicial
Hoard Chair Amie Rooney, a se
nior. said measures were taken to
counter a "pattern of problems" in
the Phi Delts. She said the board bat
ted around the idea of sanctions last
ing anywhere from one to three
years: according to Rooney, Wais
was leaning toward three years.
"I believe the sanctions are fair
and appropriate given the nature of
the violation and the overall history
of the fraternity." Wais said.
