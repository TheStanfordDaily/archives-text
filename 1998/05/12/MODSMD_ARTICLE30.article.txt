# Frito-Lay recalls snack after student finds flaw
## 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
An unhappy study break for an economics doctor
al student resulted in a major recall by Frito-Lay, the
snack foods division of Pepsi Co. Inc.
Raphael Thomadsen had been studying late in the
economics building with some friends when he decid
ed he needed a little snack.
After examining the ingredients on his package of
Grandma's Homestyle Fudge Chocolate Chip Big
Cookies, Thomadsen noticed (hat the ingredients
made no mention of eggs.
Being allergic to eggs, Thomadsen was happy to
find a snack that he thought suited his dietary needs.
After biting into the cookies, though, he soon discov
ered that he had been misled.
"I ate a couple of bites, and I was sick right away,"
Thomadsen said. "I was pretty unhappy that evening."
Thomadsen immediately called the toll-free num
ber on the back of the package to complain to Frito-
Lay.
Initially, they just said that they would look into the
matter and send him some free coupons.

A couple of days later, company representatives
called him back and told him there would be a recall ol
1.5 million packages of the cookies because the labels
on the bags fail to list eggs among the ingredients.
Thomadsen said that Grandma's Cookies were
originally considering two different recipes for the
Fudge Chocolate Chip cookies.
The ingredients listed on the package were for the
recipe that was not used.
According to the Associated Press, the company
said anyone with allergies or severe sensitivity to eggs
risks a serious or life-threatening reaction if they eat
the product.
The Frito-Lay response was "about what 1 had
hoped they would do," Thomadsen said.
According to company spokeswoman Lynn
Markley, all other Grandma's Cookie varieties are la
beled correctly and are not involved in the recall.
Grandma's Homestyle Fudge Chocolate Chip Big
Cookies with freshness dates ranging from June 2 to
Aug. 11 have been pulled from stores.
As compensation for his grievances, Thomadsen
has received coupons for seven free Frito-Lay prod
ucts.
