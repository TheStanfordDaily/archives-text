School politics, then party poli
tics.
Most aspiring politicians follow
this path. But not sophomore
Nikki Love.
Elected an ASSU senator last
month. Love is also running for a
position on the Santa Clara County
Central Committee for H. Ross
Perot's Reform Party in the June 2
primary. The committee is respon
sible for ensuring justice within the
local party and for debating local
level party issues.
As a committee member. Love
will be the official delegate to state
and national party conventions.
Organizations are already seek
ing her political prowess.
"Already, I am getting letters
from advocacy groups." she said,
smiling. The letters generally ask
for Love's views so they can inform
others.
Love's dedication to the Re
form Party is so deep that she at
tributes her Stanford admission to
Perot, the party's founder.

Sophomore Nikki Love, who is running for a position on the Santa Clara County Central Committee tor the Reform Party,
mugs with her H. Ross Perot paraphernalia.
After speaking at the 1995 Unit
ed We Stand convention in Dallas,
Perot walked through the crowd
right next to Love. Her mother
held up the camera and took a pic
ture, hoping to capture Love and
Perot in the same frame.

Reformers nationwide
know me best as 'that
college girl' or the
Hawaiian delegate'.'
— Nikki Love

Her efforts were successful, and
Love used the photo and a corre
sponding essay to respond to the
infamous Stanford admissions ap
plication question asking about the
significance of a photograph.
Her dorm room wall is filled
with gold-framed photos of herself
at party conventions, meeting with
Perot and moderating panels. Let
ters of thanks from party chair
Russ Verney and congratulations
from Perot also adorn the.

She's already been to three Re
form Party conventions. This fall,
while studying for midterms, she
decided at the last minute to travel
to Kansas City for the Reform
Party National Founding Conven
tion.
"I've always done everything
for Perot, and it's always worked
out, so 1 went," she explained. She
arrived back on the Farm Sunday
night facing a paper deadline and a
midterm Monday morning.
At each conference, she has
been Hawaii's sole representative.
In 1996. she traveled to Pennsylva
nia for the Perot-Choate conven
tion, and while on her way to visit
Stanford in 1995, she represented
Hawaii at the United We Stand
events.
Her allegiance is marked by the
optimism she has for third parties,
especially the National Reform
Party.
Reform party members "will
not go away." she said while sitting
beneath her wall shrine to the
party. "There's no giving up."
She said she understands that
the party will not be immediately
recognized. "This is a long-term
process. Think decades down the

road."
So, even if "we lose a lot now.
we are not going to give up."
In a party made up of mainly
middle-aged citizens, her long
term availability and age are
unique, as is her part-Japanese eth
nicity.

Already, I am getting
letters from advocacy
groups.'
— Nikki Love

"Reformers nationwide," she
smiled, "know me best as 'that col
lege girl' or 'the Hawaiian dele
gate'."
Her uniqueness gives her au
thority.
"If 1 could do something big, it
would change people's perspective
of the Reform Party," she said.
Indeed, Love is willing to give
the time necessary to make a
change.
"All 1 want to do is the Reform
Party," she explained.
"If I live to be 90. I have 70
years. I have plenty of time. That's
a lot of elections."
