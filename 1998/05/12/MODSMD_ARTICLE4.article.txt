School politics, then party poli
tics.
Most aspiring politicians follow
this path. But not sophomore
Nikki Love.
Elected an ASSU senator last
month. Love is also running for a
position on the Santa Clara County
Central Committee for H. Ross
Perot's Reform Party in the June 2
primary. The committee is respon
sible for ensuring justice within the
local party and for debating local
level party issues.
As a committee member. Love
will be the official delegate to state
and national party conventions.
Organizations are already seek
ing her political prowess.
"Already, I am getting letters
from advocacy groups." she said,
smiling. The letters generally ask
for Love's views so they can inform
others.
Love's dedication to the Re
form Party is so deep that she at
tributes her Stanford admission to
Perot, the party's founder.
