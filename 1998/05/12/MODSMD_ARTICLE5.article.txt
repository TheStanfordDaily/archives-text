# Loan interest rates reviewed
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
In a nearly unanimous vote last week, the House of Repre
sentatives delivered a resounding boost for students across the
nation by reapproving the Higher Education Act.
However, the bill must also be approved by the Senate, a con
ference committee and the president before it becomes law. The
legislation's most direct impact, as it stands, will be to cut inter
est rates on student loans from 7.6 percent to 6.8 percent while
borrowers are in college and from 8.2 percent to 7.4 percent after
college.
The bill could mean total savings of more than $8(H) for a stu
dent over the life of a $ 15.(KK) loan. Additionally, the bill autho
rizes increases in federal Pell Grants. The legislation would not

take effect until the 1 wy-20(M) school year.
"The changes will be great, if we get them." said Cynthia Rife,
director of student awards and financial aid. "It's going to affect
every institution."
The new interest rates will help out both subsidized federal
Stafford and Perkins loans.
According to Rife, the bill must complete the process before
September. However, the interest rate portion of the bill must
be resolved by July.
"It's a tradeoff." Rife said of the lower rates. "We all want
lower interest rates. But if it's tin) low . it isn't profitable for the
lenders."
To prevent this from happening, the bill would provide subsi-
dies for lenders.
This point has put the legisla
tion in jeopardy. In a letter to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-
Ga.), Education Secretary Richard
Riley wrote, "We strongly object
to taxpayers subsidizing record
bank profits."
According to Rife, the Stanford
Financial Aid Office has been
working with large lenders, such as
Northwest Education Loan Asso
ciation, to make sure lenders will
be guaranteed.
The bill was also recently
threatened by an amendment pro
posed bv Rep. Frank Riggs, R-
Calif.
The hill barred federal support

for public colleges and universities
that granted preferential treat
ment based on race, gender or eth
nicity.
President Clinton had threat
ened to veto the bill if the amend
ment were included.

if we get them. It's going to
affect every institution.'

"Mr. Riggs' attempt to ban af
firmative action is nothing more
than a scheme to return higher ed
ucation to the bad old days, when
colleges where bastions of discrim
ination," Rep. William Clay, D-
Mo., told the Chronicle of Higher
Education.

The amendment was voted
down by a margin of 249 to 171.
Threats to the reauthorization
of the Higher Education Act wor
ried many universities.
The bill made many other
changes, including restructuring
how aid is delivered and raising the
threshhold the amount of money a
student can earn before it is ac
counted for in a determination of
student needs.
The package also included $250
million block grants to encourage
better undergraduate teaching and
partnerships between secondary
schools and universities.
The bill intends to strengthen
tribal schools and increase aid to
minority-serving colleges.
Few of these programs will af
fect Stanford because it is a private
institution.
