# Piano minus pain and parents
## Seniors spreading the joy of music to underprivileged schoolchildren 
### Art Diaz Contributing writer 
Piano lessons for many Stanford stu
dents can he a painful childhood memory,
often associated with parental coercion.
But there are some children who desire to
plav but don't have access to instruction.
Seniors Monica Klement and Tiffany
Kuo decided to remedy this situation by
creating Stanford Alliance for Service
Through the Arts, otherwise known as
SASTA.
The alliance operates in conjunction
with John Ciill Elementary School in Red
wood City. Its primary goal is to provide

piano and some music theory instruction
to economically disadvantaged elemen
tary school children.
What is especially different about this
school is its performing arts and commu
nications technology focus, so many of
these children are eager to learn the ba
sics of music.
The school operates on the belief that
much of what children learn at a young
age is brought about through creative
forms of instruction.
The alliance's relationship with the el
ementary school started after Klement
found it difficult to give up her love of
music after entering college. She wasn't a

music major, opting instead for a life of
science, hut she still wanted to make
music a part of her life.
"When I came to Stanford. I really
wanted to continue playing music since
I've been playing piano for 11 years."
klement explained. "I thought 1 could
teach piano for community service, hut
when I looked. I couldn't find any such
programs."
Last summer. Klement and Kuo decid
ed to call local elementary schools to try
and establish a music tutoring program.
They eventually came into contact with
Todd Gavalaio, who was then a
principal at an East Palo Alto
school and making the move to
John Gill Elementary.
The alliance works well with
John Gill Elementary because
each organization's curriculum
centers around music.
According to Klement, the ele
mentary school was a perfect
match because "all their teachers
wanted [such a program] and had a
lot of ideas we could work with."
Kuo, who has been playing
piano since since she was 3 1/2, be
came involved with choir and or
chestra at Stanford.
She now leads the volunteers

and is in charge of the teaching cur
riculum.
"First- and second-graders
spent a couple of months learning
about the orchestra before going
on a trip to see one," Kuo said.
"What we did was to bring some
orchestral instruments for some
demos of what a brass and wood
wind instrument were like."
Piano lessons usually entail that
one Stanford student meet with
two elementary students once a
week for 45 minutes.
A different set of teaching vol
unteers come in once a week and
teach music theory and apprecia
tion.
Fourteen students currently
volunteer through the alliance.
Klement and Kuo hope that
more students will get involved in

the program.
Klement said that expansion
will not be a goal unless the effi
ciency they now have can be main
tained with a larger group. They
hope to teach all the children who
are signed up for lessons and per
haps even rival similar programs at
other universities, such as Harvard
where over 70 students are in
volved.
"A huge percentage of the Stan
ford population plays a musical in
strument," Klement said.
"Most were lucky that their
school taught them or their parents
could afford to pay for lessons,"
Klement added.
"A lot of schools don't have it
these days, and not all parents have
the money to pay for private
lessons," she said.
