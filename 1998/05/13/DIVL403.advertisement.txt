A Master of International Business.
(In Mexico, France, or Germany)
In today's globally competitive environment, many companies are looking for managers with
multicultural business and language skills. Pepperdine's innovative Master of International
Business (MIB) is a unique 20-month program that provides you with practical management
skills and a thorough understanding of international competition. While language proficiency is
certainly to your advantage, it is not a requirement for admission to the MIB program, nor do
you need an undergraduate business degree or work experience. The first year combines inter
national business courses with intensive Spanish, French, or German language study at our
campus in Malibu, California. During the second year in Mexico, France, or Germany, you will
complete your studies as well as a full-time internship with a multinational organization.
Broaden your career horizons with the Master of International Business degree. We're still
accepting applications for our Fall 1998 program, so call today.
