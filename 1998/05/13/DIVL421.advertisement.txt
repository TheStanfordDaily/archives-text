Stewart Brand. My fellow members
of the board of The Long Now
Foundation are Danny Hillis, Esther
Dyson, Kevin Kelly, Brian Eno, Doug
Carlston, Paul Saffo, and Peter
Schwartz. We're building a 10,000
year Clock and 10,000 year Library.
The purpose is to foster long term
responsibility. Just now we're
looking for a staffer at our office in
the San Francisco Presidio. It's a full
time job helping marshall the
resorces for this project and aid the
public understanding of it. The
person we hire will be speaking for
the project, so we're after someone
with considerable brains,
resourcefulness, and passion. We'll
provide the skills to a fast learner
You can find our more about the
Clock/Library @ www.longnow org.
