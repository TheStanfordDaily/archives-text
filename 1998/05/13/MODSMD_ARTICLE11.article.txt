### 
WASHINGTON (Al>) — One day
after India's nuclear tests stunned the
world. President Clinton pledged yester
day to implement U.S. laws that virtual
ly guarantee punitive sanctions. He
urged India's nervous neighbors "not to
follow down the path of a dangerous
arms race."
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers chastised
U.S. intelligence agencies for what one
committee chairman called "a collosal
failure" in not warning about India's
plans. And Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott predicted trouble for U.S. rat
ification of a comprehensive test ban
treaty in light of the explosions.
"This is very bad thing that ihey have
done, and it will have ramifications,"
said Lott. R-Miss.
Declaring himself "deeply disturbed"
at news of the tests, Clinton called on

India's two-month-old Hindu govern
ment to sign the test ban treaty and stop
all testing "now and without conditions."
A White House official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Clinton set
no deadline for a decision on sanction,
hut added that the president intended to
act quickly, perhaps as early as today.
The Senate Foreign Relations sub
committee that oversees policy toward
India scheduled a hearing for today to
discuss sanctions. Its chairman. Sen. Sam
Brownback. R-Kansas, promised that
the nuclear tests would "trigger a set of
automatic sanctions" and urged other
nations in the Asian subregion not to
react in anger.
Aides began reviewing the Nuclear
Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 to
determine how Clinton could respond
through sanctions and other penalties.

while American Ambassador Richard
Celeste was summoned to the United
States for consultations.
" This sort of flies ,n the face of what
everybody else was doing," said Sen.
John Glenn. D-Ohio. an author of the
1994 law.
Under that law. if the president fails
to act. the sanctions would automatically
take effect after 30 days unless ( ongress
decided otherwise. Before he departed
on a week-long trip to Europe, Clinton
promised to enforce the measure.
"Our laws have very stringent provi
sions ... and I intend to implement them
fully." he said.
"I call on India to announce that it
will conduct no further tests." Clinton
said. "1 also urge India's neighbors not to
follow suit, not to follow down the path
of a dangerous arms race."

The White House and Congress
seemed to have been caught unaware by
India's test. Presidential spokesman
Mike McC'urry said officials were trying
to determine whether failures in commu
nicating intelligence played a role.
"We'll go back and look and see how
much we knew, and how we knew it,"
McC 'urry said.
Senate Intelligence Committee
Chairman Richard Shelby. R-Ala.. said
there was "a colossal failure" of U.S.
intelligence, and Lott questioned its
capabilities in light of the tests. "For our
intelligence community not to know that
India was about to do this, that's a con
cern." he said.
