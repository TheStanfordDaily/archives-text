A potent argument
NEW YORK (Al') — A doctors' group is accusing
insurance companies of sex discrimination for cover
ing the impotence pill Viagra hut not birth control for
women.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gyne
cologists urged Congress yesterday to pass a bill
requiring insurers that pay for prescription drugs to
cover contraception as well.
Dr. Anita Nelson, a spokeswoman for the doctors'
group meeting this week in New Orleans, said contra
ception is a "medical necessity."
Insurance companies are demonstrating "a clear
bias," said Nelson, an obstetrician and gynecologist at
the University of California at Los Angeles. "Viagra
just hit like a tsunami and had immediate acceptance.

I'm glad there's coverage for male impotence, but it
does contrast with the lack of coverage for contracep
tion."
Insurers say that birth-control coverage is available
but that many employers decide not to offer such ben
efits because of the cost.
While nine out of 10 employer-based health insur
ance plans cover prescription drugs, most don't cover
prescription contraceptives, the doctors' group said.
Employer-based plans cover two-thirds of all women
ages 14 to 44.
By contrast, nearly half of the almost 3(X).(XX) men
per week who take Viagra — the latest and most pop
ular impotence drug — are reimbursed at least in part
by their insurers, according to IMS Health, a consult
ing group. Up to 73 percent of patients using rival
impotence treatments are reimbursed.

Big hands but, man, can she sing!
JERUSALEM (AF) — She looked fabulous:
slinky, sleeveless top. tight blaek pants, masses of dark
hair, dazzling smile. And she sounded — well, as fab
ulous as is necessary to win the Eurovision song eon
test. a sugary but hugely watched pop event.
So why on earth was Israeli diva Dana Internation
al fielding earnest questions yesterday about religious
coercion, civil liberties and artistic freedom?
Because up until a sex-change operation five years
ago, Dana — whose name is pronounced DAH-nah
— was a man, one Yaron Cohen. And since her week
end Eurovision victory, she has reluctantly become a
symbol of the increasingly hitter rift between Israel's
secular majority and its ultra-religious minority.
The country's Orthodox establishment has

denounced her as an abomination, unnatural and
decadent, a disgrace to the Jewish state. The secular
side responded with a volley of complaints about nar
row-mindedness.
Dana herself is trying to stay above the fray. At hei
first news conference since her return irom Britain
where the song contest was held, not a harsh wort
crossed her bee-stung, cherry -tinted hps.
"I want everyone to be happy," she sweetly told ;
jostling mob of journalists and gawkers who came U
see her welcomed home b\ Israel's tourism minister
"My victory was a present to all of Israel."
Dana's popularity is seen as a sign of increasing
acceptance of gay and alternative lifestyles, even ir
Israel's highly macho culture. With word of her victo
ry. raucous late-night celebrations broke out Sunday
in Tel Aviv's central square.
