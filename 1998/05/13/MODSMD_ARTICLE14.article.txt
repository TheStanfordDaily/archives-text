## Editorial An addition to advising 
### 
Graduate student mentors
are good beginning, but not
the complete solution

Undergraduate advis
ing at Stanford has been
criticized by students and
faculty as being inconsistent, ineffec
tive and sporadic at best.
In an effort to remedy this, the
Undergraduate Advising Center will
implement new advising strategies
for freshmen in a pilot program dur
ing the 1998-99 academic year.
Specifically, the Freshman Advis
ing Resources and Mentoring
(FARM) undergraduate advising
model will add a graduate student
mentor to each advising group.
In exchange for a small research
grant, graduate students are expected
to join undergraduate advising asso
ciates in facilitating weekly advising
sessions.
Freshmen involved in the pilot
program will be housed together in
West Lagunita, Rinconada or Otero.
While the move toward improve
ment is commendable, the advising
center should recognize that gradu
ate students cannot fill all the gaps in

the current advising system.
Graduate students are a valuable
resource for students who have a
good idea of what they're planning
on majoring in.
Graduate students from the same
department can offer insight into spe
cific departments' faculty, courses,
honors studies and potential careers.
They can also advise students on
post-graduate academic options.
For the freshmen who have not yet
found their academic direction, how
ever, graduate student mentors have
a limited effect.
Graduate students who have not
been Stanford undergraduates have
little knowledge of the Stanford
undergraduate experience.
Although advising associates will
still be a part of the core advising
group, their knowledge is often limit
ed to courses in their own major.
While the addition of graduate stu
dent mentors to the freshman advis
ing system could have many advan
tages, we hope this is a first step of
many in buttressing the existing
advising system.
Since this will be a pilot program,
future changes should be implement
ed as needed, based on feedback
from students and all those involved
with the program.
