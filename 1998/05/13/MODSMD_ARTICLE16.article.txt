## Six secrets to survival in section 
### 
Sometimes you
just draw a blank.
Sometimes you can't
think of anything to say.
Sometimes you can't think
of anything.
Has this ever
happened to you in sec-

tion? At this point in the
quarter, we're barreling down the home
stretch, and chances are, last week's
midterm reduced your already waning con
fidence in your GPA.
Don't fret. You've got plenty of time if
you utilize section to its full potential. Rise
above your sectionmates with these secrets
to scoring in section, without spending
senseless hours in preparation. CIV will
never be the same again.
Context: Always remind your class of
the context in which the author is writing.
Try something like this: "Imagine life with
out a phone. Without computers. No radios.
No VCRs. No TVs. No CD players. No 8-
track players. No e-mail. No cars. No air
planes. No subways. No nuclear bombs. No
Led Zeppelin ... etc. This was the age of
Descartes and his contemporaries. They
lived in an entirely different world than we
do. How can we be so foolish as to assume
their writing has any relevance in our lives!"
There's also, "Kant never strayed 20
miles beyond his home. He never even went
to Safeway, not to mention Bogota. How

can he be so audacious as to philosophize
on universal principles!"
Relativity: Wait for someone to say
something and then lash out at their dogged
narrow-mindedness. "Just 'cause it doesn't
fit your paradigm doesn't mean you have to
reject it."
If you feel the need to elaborate, try the
following: "The West continues to be con
strained by an archaic attachment to
Manichean dualism and all its limitations.
Just as geographical designations like 'Ori
ent and Occident' are no longer valid
paradigms, neither are distinctions like
'black and white.' Aspects of life are not
dualistic (spicy vs. bland, etc.) but part of a
continuum, and all terms are relative. Noth
ing better illustrates the continuum
between male and female than the poems of
Sappho," etc.
Translation: Most texts before the last
two centuries were written in languages
other than English. Be sure to make every
one aware of this. "Let's not forget the
political motivations behind translating
texts. I'm sure most of you would put little
stock into books used as propaganda by
Xerxes' Persia or Maoist China, so how can
you trust anything by an American corpo
ratist in the 20th century?" Or, "Can we
really conceptualize the Hegelian dialectic
without a deep understanding of the Ger
man verb auflu^benV ,
Karma: Mention the interconnectivity of

actions early in the novel with the unfolding
of events leading to the peripeteia. Good
terms to use include "hubris," "karma,"
"tabula rasa" and "pathetic fallacy." Once
you get comfortable using these words,
work on developing impressive rhetoric for
linking the concepts. For example, "In this
case, the metaphysical metamorphosis elu
cidates how his hubris is inextricably inter
twined with his karma."
Universal principles: Tie everything into
overarching universal principles. Artfully
dismiss the writings of time-honored lumi
naries as rather "dubious claims." For
example, you could say, "What you are all
saying here are words, but let's not forget
that language is a subset of society which in
itself is a subset of nature. Thus, by simple
logic, words in themselves are incapable of
unraveling the mysteries of the universe."
In desperation: For those occasions
when the TA calls on you amidst a whiff of
sleep or you just can't think of anything,
convince everyone that your lack of partic
ipation is not due to the fact that you
haven't done the reading. Rather, it's
because you are wisely choosing to abstain
from meaningless babble. Simply quote the
great Taoist philosopher Lao-tzu (in Chi
nese if possible): "He who speaks does not
know. He who knows does not speak."
