Appreciate columnists
Dan Badiak's letter in yesterday's Daily
falsely lauding Aly Remtulla, though quaint
ly satirical, was offensive and insulting. What
gives him the right to tear down those ivory
walls of prose? What makes him think he can
deflate one of the campus' most literate trea
sures?
Mr. Badiak, I urge you to rethink your
social politics. Bitterness and anger will
never be constructive. Why don't you try lis
tening to your betters ?
The Daily columnists contribute to the
campus' well-being and it's mean people like
Mr. Badiak who keep us down. Packed with
insightful commentary and honest advice,
the columnists' weekly offerings bring a little
sun into my otherwise fluorescent-bulb life.
I'd like to believe that if we were all less judg
mental, if we all followed Remtulla's exam
ple just a bit more, then our world might just
be a better place.
After reading Remtulla's column and the
Kerry Rodgers piece I have on my wall, I was
inspired. Despite the rain, I went for a run to
the Dish. It was my first time ever jogging,
and I really enjoyed it. I don't think 1 would
have tried it had it not been for Remtulla's
"pep talk." I HAVE been hitting the b(H)ks
too hard, I have been spending too much
time in careerist pursuits. Well, forget that.
Now I want to have fun. I want to live.
With the whole bay spread beneath me
and a rainbow bending over Stanford, I came
to a realization. My personal well-being is
the most important aspect of my life and
from now on I'm going to care of it. Look out
world, because here I come.

Work toward tangible
goals for Palestinians
The effort to screen "People and the
Land" is admirable project necessary to
educating the American public. As heads of
OASIS (Organization of Arab-American
Students at Stanford) and MSAN (Muslim
Students Awareness Network), Ibrahim
and Yusufali (or others like them) should
consider taking steps to promote organiza
tions capable of promoting material change.
Many already versed in the Palestinian
plight, but leery of Palestine Liberation
Organization ineptitude and Hamas mili
tanc, are eager to see viable conduits for
their energy and funds. Are there groups
pursuing tangible goals with sound tactics?
Such goals might include:
1. Assisting Palestinian authorities to
internalize a policy-effective understanding
of the United States and Israel.
2. Promoting Israeli authors like Benny
Morris or Israel Shahak.
3. Translating these authors into Arabic.
4. Considering ways to take material
advantage of overwhelming world support
for the Palestinian cause, as voiced over
decades by the United Nations, Arab
League, European Economic Community,
Islamic Conference and Non-Aligned
Movement.
5. Drawing practical lessons from the
obviously useful model the African Nation
al Congress provides.
6. Finding ways to counter alarming
AIPAC influence over the political process
here.
7. Finding expressions of poignant issues
that accommodate the attention span pop

ular media markets demand, for instance,
the startling and shameful record of U.S.
vetoes against U.N. censures of Israeli pol
icy. That can be expressed in under 10 sec
onds and may promote the rethinking our
nation so desperately needs.
Are there groups doing such things?
The Palestinian cause enjoys
widespread support in almost every coun
try on earth, with the possible exception of
Israel and our country. Efforts to educate
Americans, like screening "People and the
Land," are urgently required.
But at the same time, we must accept
that Israeli practical efforts, state terror,
and focus on policy-effective actors in the
United States has thus far outmaneuvered
the Palestinian leadership's promotion of
generalities, however much sympathy the
facts have aroused.
It is essential to convince interested
people that organizations with practical
goals, strategic foresight, and attention to
detail do exist and can benefit from infu
sions of money or energy.
I suspect such efforts in the United
States may be an integral step in prevent
ing the Palestinians from fragmenting into
a homeless Diaspora, following in the
tragic steps of so many other native
groups.
