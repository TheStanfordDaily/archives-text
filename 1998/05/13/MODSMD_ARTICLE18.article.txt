## Bidding a fond farewell to the old ASSU 
### 
Emily Andrus and Ben Decker

YOU MAY NOT have noticed
through the puddles and the clouds,
but May is halfway over. The final
weeks of this academic year arc lining up for
the countdown. Students await their residen
tial fates and scramble to find exciting sum
mer positions. Those who are graduating this
year fill their days with old friends and look
forward to new experiences.
As our terms come to a close, we sit in the
ASSU office among a year's worth of senate
agendas and paperwork. We can now reflect
on the experience, the changes that have
occurred and the people we have been so
fortunate to work with during this past year.
A quiet revolution has taken place in the
ASSU. This year's ASSU is one of the few
that has been committed to internal cooper
ation, fiscal responsibility and concrete pro
jects that make a measurable difference in
student lives. We have focused on providing
opportunities and resources, responding to
student-initiated issues and incorporating all
interested students and organizations into
ASSU projects.
We don't believe that just because we
were elected, we have all of the answers. We
have looked to the students to gain their per

spective and encouraged them to assume a
role in ASSU action.
We have been criticized by some for not
taking on national efforts or high-profile
campaigns. We came into office committed
to improving students' lives, not promising
we were going to change the world.

The Liberal Arts
Career Fair, the Draw
Guide, student work space,
campus safety efforts and
improvement of under
graduate teaching are
examples of student ser
vices the ASSU has
focused on this year.

We have worked with the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center to create open
dialogue about the interests of Stanford stu
dents and the impact of the job search on
their lives. The CPPC was very responsive
,and additional career fairs will continue to
benefit students for years to come.
The Draw Guide has helped many stu
dents, especially freshmen, navigate their
way through the Draw process and maxi
mize their options. The student space sur
vey that was sent out to nearlv 4(M) student

leaders has helped prove to the administra
tion that students are frustrated. Students
need storage space and work space.
The ASSU Teaching Awards will be pre
sented to faculty to recognize outstanding
teaching and dedication.
One of the most significant changes that
has occurred this year is a spirit of cohesion
in the ASSU. Instead of bickering and
attacking each other, senators have worked
together toward achieving their goals. They
have focused on ensuring that student
groups get the money they need when they
need it, and have initiated programs like
Dorm Outreach and the Frosh Council.
In addition, the recent structural changes
passed in the senate will help us better rep
resent the student body by assigning a con
stituency of residences and a few student
organizations to each senator. This will fos
ter improved communication between sena
tors and students.
The ASSU has assumed a new perspec
tive. We've worked hard to lay a ground
work that would ensure the success of
future ASSU administrations. Many may
not find our projects as interesting as the
ideological battles of the past. We set out to

initiate projects and make internal improve
ments that will make Stanford a better
place, not only while we're in office, but for
years to come.
Looking back on the obstacles we've
encountered, we now understand that some
of the projects we have undertaken were

not within the boundaries
of our control. We have
experienced firsthand
lessons about the benefits
and difficulties of the rela
tionship between the
ASSU and the adminis
tration. We have dealt
with the challenge of rec-

onciling the short time line of a student
leader with the long-term time line of an
administrator. But we are pleased to have
pursued these issues and to have progressed
in the right direction.
As the ASSU enters its 107 th year, we
could not ask for a more competent leader
than Maren Norton. We have worked with
her during the last two years and are confi
dent that she will continue working to build
an ASSU that is more interested in improv
ing life on the Farm than in making head

lines. Maren and Santos will have challenges
to face, hut we firmly believe that they will
he successful in accomplishing their goals.
As the year comes to an end, we are
pleased that we have remained focused on
laying a foundation on which future ASSU
administrators can build. We are proud of
the legacy of cooperation, focus and deter
mination that this year's ASSU will pass on.
The political system at Stanford is more
stable than it has ever been. Individuals of
many different backgrounds have become
involved with the ASSU and have aided in
increasing awareness of the issues that are
important to students. It has been a privi
lege to work with students, faculty and
administrators towardcommon goals and to
develop respect and lasting relationships in
the process.
Most of all. we are proud to have played
a small role in maintaining a hundred years
of Stanford tradition.
