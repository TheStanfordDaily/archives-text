eDear Health Forum,
What exactly is Viagra? Do you think it
is safe to use?

A Dear Reader,
It seems that there isn't a single soul who
hasn't heard about this amazing new won
der drug. Commentary on Letterman and
Leno has been endless.
Viagra, otherwise known as Sildnenafil Citrate, is
used to treat erectile dysfunction, or impotence, in
men. During normal sexual activity, a substance
called nitric oxide is released into the blood stream.
Nitric oxide helps smooth muscle cells relax. Viagra
enhances nitric oxide's effects and encourages addi
tional blood flow into the penis, resulting in a better
and more sustained erection.
Viagra was tested in clinical trials involving more
than 3,(XX) men impotent for reasons ranging from
spinal cord nerve damage to side effects from
prostate surgery. Each patient documented the
drug's efficacy by keeping a personal diary of sexual
activity. Results varied among patients, but all those
receiving the treatment reported improvement. The
FDA approved the drug on March 27,1998.
The recommended median dose of approxi
mately 50 mg is to be taken an hour before sexual
activity. According to studies, some men may need
less (25 mg) and others may need more (100 mg) to
achieve the desired effect. The most common
reported side effects were headache, flushing or
"hot flashes," and indigestion. Approximately 3
percent of patients taking Viagra reported changes
in color perception. Viagra should not be used with
organic nitrates such as nitroglycerine patches or
sublingual pills — the combination may lead to a
severe drop in blood pressure.
Before taking Viagra, all patients should have a
thorough physical, a medical history analysis and a
consultation with their urologist or primary care
physician. Those men who have cardiac disease may
also want to discuss the risks of increased cardiac
output during enhanced sexual activity while using
Viagra.
