# ASSU validates runoff election
## 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
An ASSU meeting originally
called to order more than a week
ago finally came to a close last
night.
The drawn-out meeting was
necessary in order to certify the re
sults of the 1998 ASSU Spring
General Election and to validate
the spring runoff election.
With the validation behind
them, presidential winner Maren
Norton and Vice President Santos
Marroquin will be able to move on
to the certification of the runoff
election at next week's meeting.
Once certified, the two can official
ly take office as the ASSU presi
dent and vice president.
Senate Deputy Chair Joe Fre
und kicked off the meeting with a
blithe introduction. "After a 168-
hour recess, we have readjourned
the 16th meeting of the second sen
ate," he said.
Last week's meeting was re
cessed after 45 minutes of waiting
for enough senators to arrive to
make quorum.
They failed to meet the require
ment of 13 senators necessary to
make quorum and act as a voting
body.
The senate called for a recess
rather than an adjournment be
cause of a technicality in the senate

bylaws. The by
laws require the

validation of an election to occur in
the first senate meeting following
the election.
Since the original meeting had
only been recessed, last night's af
fair was technically still the first
meeting following the runoff.
The process of validation is in
tended to ensure that an election
has been run in a fair and nonparti
san manner, while certification
verifies and accepts the results of
an election.
Norton and Marroquin are
eager to put the technicalities be
hind them and get to work.
"We've already started meeting
with (newly-elected] senators."
Norton said.
"We are talking about how we
can work with them."
Marroquin agreed.
"A lot of stuff is going to get
done spring quarter," he said.
" There is a lot we plan to get done
this summer also."
Ihe two plan to distribute
copies of the ASSU Constitution
and the senate bylaws for the new
senators to peruse over the sum
mer.
They also plan to implement a
recent bill by assigning each newly
elected undergraduate senator to


Norton
one of 15 residence-based districts.
"We are going to wait until
Draw results come out," Norton
explained.
Knowing where the senators
will be living will enable them to
decide which residences they can
best represent.
The senate voted to certify the
general election — including the
undergraduate and graduate sena
tors, special-fee groups and class

presidencies — with just one
hitch.
Two senators from the School
of Engineering received the same
number of votes in the election. In
order to certify the election results,
the senate needs to break the tie
and decide which of the two to ap
point as graduate senators.
The senate wielded another ma
neuver to avoid a violation of the
bylaws, which state that the com
plete general election must be cer
tified within four weeks of the elec
tion.
Tuesday, the senate will first

vote to change the bylaws to allow
for the late certification and then
vote to certify the remaining grad
uate senator.
Once validated, current sena
tors Norton and Marroquin were
suspended from the senate as re
quired by the bylaws.
The senate also voted to sus
pend two senators who had been
absent for most of this quarter's
senate meetings.
With these four senators gone,
the senate will now only need 11
senators in order to make quorum
Tuesday.
