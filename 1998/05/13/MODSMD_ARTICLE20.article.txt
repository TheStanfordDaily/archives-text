Who would have thought that the same copper
telephone lines that allow someone in Kalamazoo,
Mich, to "touch someone" in Delhi. Texas could pro
vide enough bandwidth to deliver megabits of com
puter data as well as high-quality television program
ming?
Thanks to research performed by John Cioffi,
associate professor of electrical engineering, telecom
munications companies are transforming copper net
works into superfast highways for information. The
same wires cursed for inducing Internet data bottle
necks may sewn help ease the congestion.
The technology Cioffi pioneered, called discrete
multi-tone (DMT), multiplies capacity on existing
copper networks so that data travels 30 to 50 times
faster than present rates.
Though Cioffi developed the technique in 1993.
industry has been slow to rally around the standard.
Only two months ago, a consortium including
Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, GTE and four of the five
Baby Bells approved a technology derived from Ciof
fi's DMT, called G. ADSL Lite. "It took a while, but I
think everyone is now on the same page." Cioffi said.
Cioffi's work commenccd in 1986 when he began
working on a method to transmit digital television sig
nals via copper telephone lines.
After three years of research, Cioffi developed a
solution — squeeze more capacity out of copper by
adjusting the transmission to compensate for the
quality of the line. DMT-equipped modems sample
the line 10 to 100 times a second and adjust the fre
quency of the signal accordingly.
"No two phone lines are exactly alike," Cioffi said.
"They're different lengths, some have radio-signal
noise, impulse noise, crosstalk noise, etc. DMT uses
intelligent modems that learn about the line, tell each
other about it and change their signal accordingly."
By 1993, the industry could not ignore Cioffi's
DMT. Cioffi's idea attracted so much interest that
Texas Instruments purchased a start-up founded by
Cioffi for $450 million.
Stanford also stands to gain from Cioffi's succcss.
The Office of Technology Licensing (OTL), which
has applied for four DMT patents, expects to earn
millions in future royalties.
"We hope that this | technology] will bring in
between $20 and $30 million more in royalty income
over time, which would make it the second or third
largest revenue generator that we have had to date,"
said Katharine Ku, director of OTL.
