# Researchers fight multiple sclerosis
## Gene therapy may alleviate autoimmune disease 
### Akash Garg Contributing writer 
A group of Stanford researchers led by Prof, of
Medicine Garrison Fathman has devised a gene thera
py technique that alleviates symptoms of a disease
resembling multiple sclerosis in mice. If successfully
used on humans, the technique could offer some relief
to patients with MS.
Inflammation has been implicated as the cause of
the damage associated with MS â€” reducing the inflam
mation should alleviate the disease's symptoms.
Fathman's group used a retrovirus to deliver a gene
coding for inflammation-reducing proteins called sup
pressor cytokines into the immune system's T-helper
cells.
These cells normally travel to sites of inflammation.
By expressing suppressor cytokines in T-helper cells,
researchers were able to deliver a package of inflam
mation-fighting cytokines to precisely those areas
affected by MS.

"We can give a very limited
amount of the [cytokines] in a
highly defined area so that we
only target areas of inflamma
tion where the tissue is being
destroyed," Fathman said.
Most current treatments for
autoimmune diseases such as
MS involve systemic suppres
sion of the immune system.
This approach restrains the
immune system's assault on
body tissue, but doing so leaves
the body vulnerable to oppor
tunistic infections.
"This [new] method is a way
to target the molecule to the
site of the injury, thereby avoid
ing the toxicities involved in
more systemic approaches."
said Dr. Richard dal Canto, a
graduate student working with
Fathman.
To devise a technique to
deliver the gene into T-helper
cells. Fathman collaborated
with Gary Nolan, assistant pro
fessor of molecular pharmacol
ogy. Nolan inserted the gene
encoding for suppressor
cytokines into modified retro
viruses.
These retroviruses can enter
a cell and insert their genes into

the cell's genome, but cannot reproduce.
"Retroviruses permanently integrate themselves
into the DNA, so they make ideal vehicles," dal Canto
said. "So this is a way of permanently putting the DNA
into the cell and getting the cytokine we need to the
right part of the body while taking advantage of the
homing properties of these immune cells."
Researchers performed their study in mice with
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse
equivalent to MS. The approach, however, may be a
good way to deal with a variety of autoimmune dis
eases. Rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes are both
examples of autoimmune diseases in which tissue
becomes inflamed.
The strategy of engineering T-helper cells to deliver
suppressor cytokines to sites of inflammation may be
an effective therapy for these diseases as well.
"We are very seriously considering the appropriate
strategy to address MS or rheumatoid arthritis in which
we could adapt this therapy in the not-to-distant future

for human clinical trials," Fathman said.
MS is a debilitating and painful autoimmune disease
of the nervous system. In patients with MS. the immune
system mistakes a protein called myelin for a foreign
particle. Myelin is found in the glia cells which wrap
around neurons, insulating and shielding them.
Over time, the immune system destroys myelin-con
taining glia. the insulation wears thin and neurons
begin to fire improperly. These "brush fires" as Fath
man calls them, occur at sites throughout the body.
Symptoms of MS include impaired vision and poor
motor control, eventually leading to death.
"The presumption is that if we could put out the
brush fires with the suppressor cytokines, we could
achieve homeostasis and put the immune system back
into a state where it can fend off disease, not fight [the
body] itself." Fathman said.
Other researchers contributing to the study included
postdoctoral fellow Michael Shaw and Neurology Prof.
Lawrence Steinman.
