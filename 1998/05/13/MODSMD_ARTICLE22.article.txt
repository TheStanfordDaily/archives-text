# How gene therapy can help treat multiple sclerosis
## 
### 
Using an attenuated
retrovirus — one that
can no longer replicate
itself — researchers
can insert a gene cod
ing for suppressor
cytokines into T-helper
cells.

Multiple sclerosis
is an autoimmune
disorder that caus
es certain neural
tissues to become
inflamed.
Researchers hope
that the engi
neered T cells will
travel to these tis
sues and release
suppressor
cytokines that will
help reduce the
inflammation.
