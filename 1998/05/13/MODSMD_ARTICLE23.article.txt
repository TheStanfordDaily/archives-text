# Physicians combat debilitating sleep disorders
## Dement starts pilot project training physicians to diagnose and treat sleep disorders 
### Rollin Hu Staff writer 
Dr. William Dement, director of the Sleep Disorders
Clinic and Research Center at Stanford Medical Center,
believes that every primary care physician should recog
nize and respond to sometimes fatal sleep disorders. As
a result, he is coordinating a project to increase aware
ness of such disorders.
Earlier this year. Dement testified before the House
Subcommittee on Health and Environment that sleep
disorders are one of the nation's most threatening health
problems. "The magnitude of suffering that results from
sleep disorders is so large as to be almost incomprehen
sible," he said.
It has been estimated that sleep disorders cause in
excess of $1(X) billion a year in lost productivity. Further
more, many accidents are caused by those suffering from
sleep disorders. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration estimated in 1996 that 1,500 deaths and
76,(XH) injuries could be attributed to drivers falling
asleep at the wheel. The cost of treating and fixing acci
dents caused by sleepy drivers totaled $12.4 billion a
year.
Unfortunately, many doctors often ignore or are
unaware of the telltale symptoms of sleep disorders.
Thousands of people suffer from diseases such as
obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy and insomnia. Sleep
apnea is defined as a temporary cessation of breathing
while sleeping, a phenomenon which often awakens the
sleeper.
Those who suffer from sleep apnea can wake up
over 100 times in a night. As a result, sleep apnea can
lead to insufficient rest, causing problems during the day.
Narcolepsy is a neurological sleep disorder that results in
excessive daytime sleepiness and occasional losses of
voluntary muscle control.
Dement believes that primary care doctors need to
look for sleep disorder symptoms and know how to treat
them. As a pilot project. Dement and colleagues at Stan
ford have begun a campaign to educate and train groups
of primary care physicians in Walla Walla. Wash, and
Moscow. Idaho. The effort is part of the National Pn
mary Care Project, which is funded by both private cor
porations and nonprofit foundations. The program is
also expected to extend to Alamo. Calif.
"()ur goals include educating and training a group of
primary physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of

sleep disorders and also, based on what we are learning,
to devise a national strategy to treat sleep disorders."
Dement said.
The Stanford researchers have met with success.
According to Richard Simon, a diKtor at Walla Walla
Clinic and now the area's first board-certified sleep
medicine specialist. "Just knowing about sleep has been
particularly helpful." Simon said that approximately 8.5
percent of the patients he has seen since 1983 have at
least mild sleep apnea. Snoring, he said, is a potential
sign of apnea. "I don't take snoring lightly." he said.
"Physicians need to ask questions."
Dement suggests that pnmarv care physicians should
routinely ask patients whether they have the common
symptoms of sleep apnea, like constant fatigue or loud
snoring punctuated by silence and gasps.
Most people can be treated as long as they are cor
rectly diagnosed. Clete Kushida. Dement's associate on
the Walla Walla and Moscow projects, said that "treat
ing most sleep-disorder patients is not difficult as long as
physicians recognize the symptoms. Our job as sleep spe

cialists is also basic — to help our colleagues in family
practice understand the warning signs of sleep depriva
tion. apnea and more sophisticated sleep problems."
One success story is Gloria Barker, a 42-vear-old
woman recently diagnosed b\ the Moscow clinic as hav
ing sleep apnea. Before her diagnosis, her sleep apnea
caused her to wake up an average of 111 times a night,
and her snoring was so loud that her husband was forced
to sleep elsewhere.
After the diagnosis, her condition was treated with
the simple fitting of a continuous positive airway pres
sure machine (CPAP). which uses air pressure to pre
vent airway blockage. Barker said that the results of the
machine were instantaneous. "This machine is wonder
ful." she said. "It's been wonderful for my family."
Dement said that his work was extremely gratifying.
"Patients who never knew why they were so sick are
finally getting sufficient sleep." he said. "Some patients
who simply thought they were old. fatigued and sapped
of energy are able to function successfully at work for the
first time in years and are able to enjoy their lives."
