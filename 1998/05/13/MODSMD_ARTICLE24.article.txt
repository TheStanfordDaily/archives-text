## Kobe who? College sports better than pro

ARE THE BULLS going to their fifth NBA
championship title in the last six years, or are the
Lakers the team of the future?
To tell you the truth, 1 don't really care. In fact, I can't
even tell you the teams left in the playoffs.
You are wondering why The Daily's sports editor
doesn't care about sports, hut think again, fair children.
It is not that I don't care about sports. Growing up in
Los Angeles, I was a diehard Dodgers fan. (Here I am
mixing up my sports ... I liked the Lakers but baseball
was my passion). First thing every morning, I would check
the box scores and look at my favorite's lines ... Pedro
Guerrero and Steve Sax in elementary school gave way to
Raul Mondesi and Mike Piazza in high school. I could rat
tle the stats of the starting lineup on the spot.

Upon my arrival at Stanford, however, things
changed.
I began to follow Stanford sports.
My first football game was enough to convert me into
a college sports fanatic. I don't remember who won the
football game, or even who we played. What I do re
member is the energy in the stadium, the sea of red (ex
cuse me... Cardinal) and rooting for the guys in my CIV
section.
I've come to realize that there are a few reasons I pre
fer to obsess over college sports rather than professional.
The best part of being a college sports fan is having a
vested interest in the teams. In most cases, people chose
to attend Stanford and did not just randomly end up on
the Farm. This instills an instant pride in the institution,
and logically, the institution's sports teams. (Sure, there
are those few people from Arizona who still root for the
Wildcats when our basketball teams meet, but they'll
come around.)
Let's compare being a Stanford baseball fan to being a
Chicago Cubs fan. Those poor souls born tin the north
side of Chicago have no say in the fact that they were born
Cubs fans and will never see their team win a World Se
ries. Granted, no one has to root for her hometown team,
but it is tough to go all the way to another state to watch a
game.

Another great part about being a
Stanford sports fan is knowing the
athletes It is much more fun to know
the people your are rooting for
rather than just the players. Seeing
dormmates serve an ace invokes a
certain pride because you know
what type of toothpaste he uses, or
whether she prefers Stern's pink fe
tuccini to carrot-orange soup.
A more practical reason for lov
ing college sports is the price of tick
ets. A season of exciting men's or
women's basketball costs students

only $25, the price of a single ticket to
an NBA game. Anil who can com
pete with the Sixth Man Club? The
Cheeseheads sit so far from the field
that their heckles can't he heard by
the opponents. Hut the Sixth Man
Club is notorious for getting into the
heads of the visitors with its," Whose
your daddy"-esque jeers.
And my personal favorite reason
for preferring Stanford games to
professional ones: no cheerleaders.
'Nuf said.

Jennifer Splunsky apologizes to any
one who was a high school cheer
leader. Hid, hey, you Here a high
si hoot cheerleader.
