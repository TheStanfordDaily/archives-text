# Reflecting on a winning season
## 
### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
When you win, you win together.
And when you lose, you lose together.
The only constant in the equation of
competitive athletics is that together
ness. If you don't have it, no national title
can give it to you. But if you do have it,
even the most devastating loss can't take
it away.
For the Stanford women's water polo
team, last weekend's loss to California in
the semifinals of the national champi
onships meant the second-ranked Cardi
nal had to settle for a third-place finish.
Quite a letdown for a team that had set
its sight, and heart, on challenging the de
fending champion UCLA squad in the fi
nals. But, as the coaching staff and the
girls maintain, winning isn't always
everything.
"Every person is both a teammate
and a close friend," said sophomore
Elissa Keszler. "Our team has some
thing that every team wishes to have but
few get to experience .. . genuine team
love."
"When I think about what it would be
like to be on UCLA and have that na
tional championship, I realize that I
wouldn't trade one morning workout
with my team or one white board talk for
a place on the UCLA team," said sopho
more Ellen Estes. "They may have a na
tional championship, but I've learned
some valuable skills and been involved
with some of the best people and that to
me is worth more than a national title.
"What makes our team special is that
the journey we had together since Octo
ber was amazing, and we were able to
work hard and accomplish many goals
along the way."
Stanford head coach John Tanner
stands by his statements made at the be
ginning of the season. Back in October,
Tanner said, "Our goal is to handle our
selves as a championship team everyday.
We also wHfU to operate completely as a
team, where everyone feels engaged in
what we are doing."
Even though the team didn't achieve
its goal of winning nationals, Tanner was
proud of what the team did accomplish.
"Something the girls have developed
as a group is the ability to pick them
selves up and recover from disappoint
ment." Tanner said. "They are a wonder
ful group of girls that are skilled as well as

athletic. They're terrific people, and they
have a lot of respect and admiration for
each other. They're strong and cohesive
and there are great relationships within
the team. The loss doesn't diminish
that."
The Stanford team has certainly
shown itself to be a championship-cal
iber team. The players attribute that to
the team unity that has developed
throughout the season.
"I've never seen or been a part of a
group of more committed, dedicated or
supportive teammates," said junior
Maureen Eger. "And that's what defines
a championship team — what exists be
yond talent. In my eyes and in my heart
we are champions, and I am proud to be
a member of this team."
The success of the team is due to the
camaraderie of the women not just in
practice and games, but off the pool deck
as well.
"Basically, the best thing about the
team, no question, is the friendship," said
junior Lindsay Tam. "I love spending
time with my teammates outside the
water, and that just makes for better dy
namics in the water, at practice and in
games. Everyone on our team has a lot of
respect for each other, and you can tell
we do by the way we work so hard and
are able to have so much fun."
"This whole year has been about sac
rifice for each other .. .any one of us
would do anything, in or out of the water,
to help a teammate if she asked." said
freshman Alii Henry.
The closeness of the group — being
on the same "wavelength" with your
teammates — makes playing together a
thrill, but it also makes the end of the sea
son a time for a little sadness and nostal
gia.
If a team is really close, a player may
take that withdrawal to an extreme —
feeling depressed that she doesn't have
to get up for 7 o'clock weights, missing
the lingering scent tier
clothes, hair and skin. j;;, t
"The past few days I have felt really
sad and it took me a while to realize
why," Estes said. "[One of the reasons]
why I was so sad was because I was hav
ing some withdrawals from not being
around my teammates every day. In fact.
I left my traveling clothes on the entire
day yesterday and when I thought about
it, I thought that maybe a reason I was
leaving them on was because I wasn't

ready to let go of this season or my team
yet."

"During a very emotional team meet
ing to put closure on this season," said ju
nior Heather Crary. "we all shared our
feelings with each other and supported
each and every member of the team. [ We
exchanged] acknowledgments and a re
assurance that next season will be yet an
other journey that we'll make together.
[We will] work hard every step of the way
so that we may accomplish next year

what we didn't this year."
"That's not to say that this season was
a complete waste. Ask anyone on the
learn and they'd mou likely »sav that
they'd do it all again." . iy t ,
The Cardinal will t»e losing senior
Julie Baker, and new freshmen will be
coming in so the team will have a "slight
ly different composition" next year, ac
cording to Tanner, who added that "even
small changes in personnel can change
the way a team functions."
But a team that is strong enough to

overcome the difficulties the Cardi
nal faced after last weekend's semi
final loss to Cal is a team that will
obviously he strong enough to sup
port each other through any
changes the next season brings.
"I am so proud to be a part of
something this wonderful," said
freshman Allie Riddell.
"I have never met a group of
people who are so focused, dedicat
ed, committed, hard-working, car
ing or fun as this team is."
And that's what really makes all
of the joy and pain worthwhile.
"We are a family and whatever
we place, no matter how disap
pointing — and third in the nation
is really not that bad — we go out
with our heads held high, our arms
around each other, proud to repre
sent Stanford," Henry said.
