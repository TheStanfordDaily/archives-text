ITie only thing harder than hit
ting one of Becky Blevins' fastballs
is getting her to talk about her per

sonal accomplishments.
For Blevins, success is not an in
dividual achievement. It is the result
of a strong team, dedicated parents
and supportive friends.
Whether it's by the help of oth

ers or by individual efforts, she's
certainly come a long way in playing
softball.
"My whole softball life hits been
just totally messed up," Blevins said,
laughing.
As a child. Blevins did not even
want to play softball; she liked soc
cer instead, but her mother insisted
that she at least try softball for one
season. After that one season,
Blevins was hooked. She has played
in the highly competitive Amateur
Softball Association (ASA) every
summer since she was 14. The junior
now has played in a total of 15 fast
pitch softball seasons. However,
Blevins only played for two full sea
sons in high school, her freshman
and junior years, because she at
tended three different schools in
that period.
As a member of the Lake Hava
su High School team. Blevins
pitched in the winning game in the
Arizona state championship her
freshman year. In Blevins' sopho
more year, her parents moved from
Lake Havasu, Ariz, to an apartment
in Phoenix so that Becky could at
tend a school strong in academics
and play softball.
"Without the support of my par
ents. 1 wouldn't be here," Blevins
said, teary-eved. "There's no way I
can pay them back."
Her team, the Lil' Saints, went
on to ASA nationals her junior year
and then the ASA national champi
onship game her senior year.
According to Blevins. playing in
high schix>l was great, but being at
Stanford is a real dream come true.
Softball head coach John
Rittman is equally glad to have her
here.

"I wouldn't trade her for any
thing," Rittman said. "She's an out
standing competitor. and she works
very hard. Anybody would love to
coach Becky Blevins."
Despite the words of praise now.
Blevins almost did not get asked to
play Stanford softball. Blevins sent
in a tape of her pitching her junior
year, but the coaches replied that
they were not interested. Then, over
the summer before her senior year,
then-assistant softball coach Andy
Pearce spotted her playing in an
ASA tournament. Remembering
her name from the letter accompa
nying her videotape, he decided to
add Blevins to his list of recruits
after all.
Blevins always wanted to play
Pacific 10 Conference softball and
go to college in California. ITie offer
Stanford later gave her could not
have been better. She accepted cm
the spot. When she first came to
Stanford. Blevins was a part of the
second group of softball recruits,
seven in all. Stanford was trans
forming softball from a club sport
into a varsity one.
"Our freshman year, no one re
ally knew there was a softball
team." explained Blevins.
Blevins has improved over the
last three years. She holds the all
time Stanford record for strikeouts
with ,W4 to date and has broken her
own record for single season strike
outs with 147 this year.
"She's really perfected her
game." said junior teammate Jennie
Foyle.
Blevins admitted she dix*s have
her perfectionist side. If a game
