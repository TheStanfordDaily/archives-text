heavy bags of clubs.

A simple, democratic game of
golf.
A game of Frisbee golf.
Frisbee golf has been alive and
flourishing on the Stanford campus
for over 20 years. It is a pastime that
has been enjoyed by a wide spec
trum of Stanford students ranging
from Ultimate players to freshman
dorm residents. It is so popular, it
has a cult following that is fierceh
devoted to keeping detailed maps
of courses, score cards, pictures and
clarifications on the World Wide
Web so any Stanford student can
take part in the fun with a click of
the mouse.
It has become so mainstream
that the Stanford Axe Committee is
hosting a Frisbee golf tournament
this Friday at 5 p.m. so novices and
diehards alike can test their skills.
The tournament consists of
teams ol four plavers and all partic
ipants receive food. prizes and T
shirts. The committee expects over
20 teams to participate.
"This is the eighth tournament in
recent years, but it has been a cam
pus tradition for aw hile." said reser

The game of Frisbee golf is quite
simple. It is just like golf—but with
a Frisbee. A pre-determined course
with IS holes is followed, and the
player tries to hit the hole (say a
trash can or an archway or the mid
dle of the rosetta) in the least
amount of throws as possible. A par
is pre-determined for each hole,
and each player keeps score. After
a full round, the player with the
least number of throws wins. In the
case of the tournament, the individ
ual scores are added up for a team
score.
The possibilities for Frisbee golf
courses at Stanford are endless with
all the fountains, archways, steps
and sculptures that dot campus.
"Frisbee golf is an activity many
students enjoy, but it's never orga
nized," Shei said. "That's why we
have the tournament."
Students primarily use two
courses. Ihe holes and their pars
are passed down orally through the
years, and maps of each are easily
available on the Web.
"The" Stanford Frisbee golf
course is the most well-known on
campus. Teeing off on the "L.e Fau
con" statue behind kresge Audito
rium. the course winds throughout
campus One of the favorite holes
requires the golfer to throw his Fris
bee over the Term an Engineering
Center pond. Many a Frisbee have
been lost in the pond, but every true
golfer retrieves his or her Frisbee at
any cost.
Anyone can make up their own
course with a little investigating.

That's exactly what former student
John Knuth and his friends did back
in the eighties. Knuth, a former star
of the Stanford Ultimate team,
founded the "Ted Parks Memorial
Course" in 1984. Legend has it. Ted
Parks was a resident assitant who

thought Stanford students studied
too much. Late at night. Parks
would round up some of his friends
and play along the major study
areas like Terman, Green Library
and Meyer Library. He would make
as much noise as possible and try

and convince other people to join
him. After enough rounds, the path
Parks and his friends had followed
became a course. Knuth still travels
to Stanford once a month to test his
skills.
"We never hit anvbodv," Knuth

said. "And only one person ever lost
a Frisbee when they chucked it into
a palm tree."
People who would like to par
take in the tournament should con
tact Kenny Shei at 7-5637 and bring
their own Frisbee.
