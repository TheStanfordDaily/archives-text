Frisbee golf has been alive and
flourishing on the Stanford campus
for over 20 years. It is a pastime that
has been enjoyed by a wide spec
trum of Stanford students ranging
from Ultimate players to freshman
dorm residents. It is so popular, it
has a cult following that is fierceh
devoted to keeping detailed maps
of courses, score cards, pictures and
clarifications on the World Wide
Web so any Stanford student can
take part in the fun with a click of
the mouse.
It has become so mainstream
that the Stanford Axe Committee is
hosting a Frisbee golf tournament
this Friday at 5 p.m. so novices and
diehards alike can test their skills.
The tournament consists of
teams ol four plavers and all partic

recent years, but it has been a cam

The game of Frisbee golf is quite
simple. It is just like golfâ€”but with
a Frisbee. A pre-determined course
with IS holes is followed, and the
player tries to hit the hole (say a
trash can or an archway or the mid
dle of the rosetta) in the least
amount of throws as possible. A par
is pre-determined for each hole,
and each player keeps score. After
a full round, the player with the
least number of throws wins. In the
case of the tournament, the individ
ual scores are added up for a team
score.
The possibilities for Frisbee golf
courses at Stanford are endless with
all the fountains, archways, steps
and sculptures that dot campus.
"Frisbee golf is an activity many
students enjoy, but it's never orga
nized," Shei said. "That's why we
have the tournament."
Students primarily use two
courses. Ihe holes and their pars
are passed down orally through the
years, and maps of each are easily
available on the Web.
"The" Stanford Frisbee golf
course is the most well-known on
campus. Teeing off on the "L.e Fau
con" statue behind kresge Audito
rium. the course winds throughout
campus One of the favorite holes
requires the golfer to throw his Fris
bee over the Term an Engineering
Center pond. Many a Frisbee have
been lost in the pond, but every true
golfer retrieves his or her Frisbee at
any cost.
