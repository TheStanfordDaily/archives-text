### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Three finalists have been chosen
for the half-time directorship posi
tion at the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center. Each can
didate — chosen from a competi
tive pool of 61 applicants — will an
swer questions from community
members in a series of open forums
that will begin today at the center.
"All three have a solid record of
experience dealing with |lesbian,
gay and bisexual] issues," said As

sociate Dean of Religious Life
Maurice Charles, head of the com
mittee of students, faculty and stall
that selected the finalists.
During the open forums, each
candidate will speak briefly about
what they perceive are the critical
issues facing the center. A question
and-answer session will follow.
Each candidate will spend the
day at Stanford, where they w ill un
dergo multiple interviews with the
committee, the center's adviser
Troy Gilbert and Dean of Students
Marc Wais.

"1 would encourage anyone
who's interested — whether they're
gay. straight or questioning — to
come to the community forum,"
said Hillary McKinney. a master's
student in the School of Education
and committee member. "It's im
portant for everyone to he in
volved."
The committee will meet soon
after all the candidates ha\e been
interviewed and present their find
ings to Wais, who will make the
final decision.
"We want to be able to an
nounce the name of the new direc
tor before the close of the academ
ic year." Charles said.
The first forum, to be held today
from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.. will feature
John-Peter Wilhite, former direc
tor of education at AIDS Services
in Austin. Texas. Wilhite was active
in lesbian, gay and bisexual issues
as a graduate student at Southwest
Texas State, where he earned a de
gree in speech communication.
Sara Sperling, who is assistant
director for the Center for Student
Leadership at Santa Clara Univer
sity. will speak with students from 2
to 3:30 p.m. on Friday.
Sperling earned a master's de
gree in higher education adminis
tration from Stanford, and worked
as the student coordinator of the
center.
l'he third candidate, Gwen
dolyn Dean, is a graduate coordi
nator at the Office of Lesbian. Gay
and Bisexual Life at Emory Uni
versity in Atlanta. Students may
speak with her on Monday from
3:30 to 5 p.m.
The selection of the three final
ists marks the culmination of a
three-year effort by students seek
ing a permanent employee for the
center, which is currently the only
community center without a per
manent director.
Students first wrote a proposal
requesting the University to allo

cate funds for a full-time director in
1995. and many were disappointed
when the University agreed this
January to fund only a half-time
position.
It wasn't easy to get students in
volved in the search process,
Charles said, although two students
serve on the committee.
Senior Micah Carvalho, staff
member for the center, said that
there may have been a correlation
between lack of student participa
tion on the committee and disap
pointment at past University deci
sions. "but there was no way to
prove it."
Carvalho said he expected a
high attendance at the forums.
"The director is for us, and we
need to say what we want in order
to get it."he said.
Students were initially con
cerned that the University would
have difficulty attracting quality
applicants for a half-time position.
But Charles said this has not been
the case.
Charles did note, however, that
three other finalists withdrew their
applications after receiving lull
time jobs, and some applicants
thought they were applying for a
full-time position.
Nevertheless. Charles was im
pressed with the number of appli
cants. He added that although the
opening was only advertised local
ly, the committee received appli
cants from across the nation.
"It says something about the
reputation of Stanford," Charles
said. "It's clear people want to be
here."
