# Budding actors deal with space issues

Editor's note: This is the first in a
weekly series analyzing the arts scene
at Stanford.
Some people are in iheir element
only in front of an audience. With
lighting from above and the gaze of
shadowed faces, a person's true na
ture comes closer to full expression.
The desire to be on stage — the
desire to create a different character
from what's inside you is a driving
force in many lives. For many stu
dents. putting on a show is the center
and soul of their time.
The drama scene at Stanford is
primarily organized by two entities:
the Drama Department and student
run Ram's Head Theatrical Society.
Each year. Ram's 1 lead puts on Big
Game Gaieties, Winter One Acts
and a spring musical, which was
"Chess" this year.
The Music Department and the
Dance Division of the Drama De

partment also have a hand in orga
nizing performances. Independently,
the Savoyards bring Gilbert & Sulli
van to campus, dormitories produce
musicals, and theme groups create
performances relevant to their area
of interest.
Senior George Mitchell, an exec
utive producer for Ram's I lead, finds
the drama community supportive.
"The audiences are terrific." he
said. "We always have to turn people
away from Winter One Acts."
Drama is prolific at Stanford, but
nevertheless, it faces certain obsta
cles.
Mitchell complained that there is
no quality space on campus where
groups can stage productions outside
Memorial Auditorium.
"We really have no place to do
theater," he said. "Mem Aud is not a
theater. It's an auditorium. It's huge
and plagued with sound problems.
The Little Theater is a great space,
hut it has so few seats that tons of
people get turned away."

According to Mitchell. Dinkel
spiel Auditorium makes production
work difficult. The only other option
is an outdoor venue like Frost Am
phitheater.
"But then you're limited by the
time of year, and if it rains, you're
screwed," he said.
Even drama faculty recognize the
space crunch for student performers.
"There's a real problem with both
rehearsal and performance space on
campus," said Michael Ramsaur,
teaching professor and program co
ordinator for the Drama Depart
ment. "The Drama Department has
some of the prime venues on campus,
but we do 20 or so performances a
year that really fill everything up.
That leaves only very difficult space
to use for student-initiated projects.
Students are looking all over campus
for places to rehearse. There's an ex
treme lack of facility where there
seems to be a lot of desire for activi
ty."
Mitchell said that Stanford needs

to match the demand of the 4(X) to
6(M) seats most plays need.
Extra space "would be used by
everybody — the Drama Depart
ment, outside groups, dance groups,"
he said. "I think if you build a build
ing like that, it will make its money
back. It would get so much use and
prove to the community that there is
an interest in drama."
In addition to lack of a suitably
sized space, several students interest
ed in drama note that the Drama De
partment and other groups are
forced to share the use of a limited
amount of space, materials and tal
ent.
Ana-Catrina Savulescu, a sopho
more who directed the Winter One
Act "Solitaire for Two," pointed out
that these limits increase the interac
tion between artistic groups.
"We always share props and cos
tumes and there's always collabora
tion for space." she said. "There's a
little bit of competition between
Drama and Ram's Head, but in the

long run it's a collaboration. 1 lowev
er, few people do work with both. It's
either, 'I'm a Rani's Head' or Tm a
drama.'"
Mitchell said the efforts of the
Drama Department reflect more
professionally constructed "high art"
while Ram's Head offers popular
theater with productions like Gai
eties.
"I'd love to do stuff with Drama,
but 1 feel it's not as mainstream," said
Kevin Lemon, a junior who has only
performed in Ram's Head produc
tions. "There's not as many opportu
nities to act for fun."
"It seems reserved to a small
group of people actually studying
drama," Lemon added.
Entrance into acting, writing and
producing at Stanford is the usual
blend of auditions, rewrites and
meetings. Some bring their passion
for acting from high school and dive
right in. while others move more
slowly.
"When I first came, I was very

skeptical," Savulescu said. "Stanford
is not very famous for drama, but
then 1 became involved with many
very talented actors and directors."
According to Mitchell, the dra
matic arts are vigorous and growing
at Stanford.
"It's clear that people in this area
want more theater. They're looking
for someone to give it to them, and it
should be Stanford,"
Mitchell said. "The environment
is definitely right for an increase in
the arts at Stanford, and it will pay off
if we make that initial investment
now."
