May 1 was the 50-year anniver
sary of the founding of Israel. The
dominant image portrayed by the
American media is one of celebra
tion and pride.
But for many Palestinians, this
week is a commemoration for the
50th anniversary of Al Nakba,
which in Arabic means "the great
catastrophe."
Through campus events this
week, Muslim Students Awareness
Network and the Organization of
Arab-American Students in Stan
lord will strive to provide their
views of the Palestinian condition

alter 50 years of Israeli nation
hood.
"Our objective is to provide un
derstanding of the underrepresent
ed perspective of the plight of the
Palestinians," said president of the
Muslim network Salim Yusufali.
"We hope this awareness can he
the first step toward a balanced
view of the greater conflict and a
better understanding of what can
be done to achieve a peaceful reso
lution."
"Palestine, 50 Years of Dispos
session. 50 Years of Struggle" is the
program commemorating the 50th
anniversary of A 1 Nakba.
The main features of the pro
gram include a presentation by

Richard Curtiss and the screening
of the Public Broadcasting System
documentary, "People and the
Land."
A lecture by Curtiss, executive
editor of the Washington Report
on Middle Eastern Affairs, will be
held today at 7 p.m. in Lane Histo
ry Corner. Room 2.
The presentation is entitled
"What everyone should know
about Palestine: America's legacy
in Israel," and the Muslim organi
zation is projecting an attendance
of approximately 60 people.
Immediately following the talk
is the campuswide screening and
discussion of "People and the
Land" at 10:30 p.m.

"The video situates the Palestin
ian-Israeli conflict in the present hv
taking us to the area and showing
us the reality of the situation,"
Yusufli said.
"People and the Land," whose
scheduled screenings have caused
stirs on campus in the past week he
cause of its controversial nature,
will he shown at more than 20 hous
es across campus.
The two organizations said they
hope that showing the video in
dorms will stimulate deeper under
standing and dialogue that will mu
tually benefit all.
