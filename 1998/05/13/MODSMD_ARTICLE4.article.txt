# System shutdowns rare
## 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
Last month's computer snafu at
the Graduate School of Business is
a vivid reminder of the need to
back up computer data.
About 15 students and profes
sors at the Business School lost re
search data after department com
puters were shut down for an up
grade in early March. A number of
dissertations and research was lost.
When the computers were
turned back on at their new loca
tions, some original file content
was not recognized and subse
quently lost.
Although the data loss caused
headaches for some Business
School students and faculty, most
schools or departments don't have
to worry about such a crash occur
ring on their systems.
While the incident highlights the
need for individuals to save copies
of their own work, the tvpe of serv

er used by departments also affects
the likelihood of losing data in sys
tem mishaps.
The question is whether the de
partment is using a centralized
server — the Leland system — or a
separate server run only by the de
partment. said Dennis Michael,
manager of the Leland system.
"Department machines are run
by departments and are used only
for the |individual| departments,"
Michael said.

According to Michael, the Le
land system, which has about 100
servers, is centralized and used by
the entire University.
"A lot of departments rely on
both [departmental and Leland
servers]," he said.
Robert Boyd is an academic
technology specialist with Stan
ford's libraries and works with fac
ulty to facilitate research. He said,
"No system is foolproof."
However, of the options that are
available to University depart
ments. he felt that the central Le
land server is probably the most re
liable.

"As far as work done on larger
servers [like Leland], there are lots
of backup systems that are not nec
essarily incumbent upon individu
als ... rather, the system will back
itself up," he said.
Although some departments
say the Business School system's
mishap has prompted them to back
up data more conscientiously,
other staff report that regular data
saves were already part of depart
ment routine.
Departments are being more
careful about how the computer
systems are backed up now, said
Mark Urbanek, a senior computer

technician for the Communication
Department, and everyone has
horror stories about lost files.
For example, in the Law School,
full backups are run on the school's
computers every night. In the
Chemistry Department, individu
als are responsible for backing up
their own work, a department em
ployee said.
There is not a centralized per
son responsible for computer back
ups.
To avoid a repeat accident,
Michael said, the Business School
is planning a move to the central
ized Leland system at Forsvthe.
