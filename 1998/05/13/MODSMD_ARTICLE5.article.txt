Stern Hall Student Affairs Specialist Janet

derful job the Harveys performed as Larkin RFs.
"It will leave a real Sue and Bob Harvey lega
cy, since they did such a wonderful job as RFs,"

Wright said, "and I think whenever their name
comes up. we remember that."
Each year, winners receive a certificate and a
cash award provided by the 1 larveys' endowment
fund. Last year, the prize was awarded to Andrew
Josephson of Larkin.
According to Wright, the award is designed
both to motivate and recognize outstanding RAs.
"I think it's motivational for new RAs coming on
board for the next few years." she said.
"Sometimes RAs get taken for granted, and
people think they just have the job to get paid or
to get single rooms, but they really do earn their
keep."
Candidates are recommended lor the award by
their RFs and evaluated by a selection committee
consisting of a staff member, a senior administra
tor from the Office of Residential Education, a

residence dean, an RA in a four-class dorm who
formerly lived in an all-freshman dorm, and three
students who ii\ed in all-freshman dorms the pre
vious year.
Recipients are selected on the of three
criteria set up b\ the Harveys. Among other
things, winners of the award are supposed to h: e
welcomed freshmen and made them feel a pari i
the dorm community, actively participated and
led community development activities, and sup
ported and helped freshmen to benefit from their
first year at Stanford.
"She h;»s been a key figure in generating en
thusiasm for programs. She also serves a key role
as a mediator in the dorm," Otero Rl Jed Black
said.
Despite her qualifications as an
outstanding RA. Mason was sur
prised by the award. "It was nothing
that crossed inv mind through the
year." she said.
Mason agreed that RAs are an
important part of the freshman col
lege experience.
"RAs are important in all-frosh
dorms." she said. "Freshmen come

in without really knowing anything
and need guidance through the
year. RAs really provide that with
dorm programming as well as gen
eral support."
Mason said being an RA has not
only provided a good experience for
the freshmen in Otero, but for her as
well.
"It's been an amazing year," she
said. "The freshmen are really won
derful. and it's been fun to get to
know them and to learn about their
interests."
