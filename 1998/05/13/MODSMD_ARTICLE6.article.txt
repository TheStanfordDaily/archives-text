# LSAC says prep access doesn't matter
## 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Every year, exasperated law
school applicants spend hundreds of
dollars to get their noses ahead in the
horse race that law school admissions
have become. Among the most frus
trated were the students who could
not afford commercial test prepara
tion courses.
I Inequal access of underrepre
sented minority students to these
courses were thought to be a big
problem in achieving higher scores in
the Law School Admissions Test.
However, the Law Schix>l Admis
sions Council, which administers the

test, said last week in the Chronicle of
Higher Education that the difference
in LSAT mean scores between mi
nority and white students can no
longer be attributed to unequal ac
cess to test preparation courses.
The survey indicated that during
the 1 academic year, minority
students attended these courses at ap
proximately the same rate as white
students.
The article also mentions that the
scores of that year's test showed that
white test takers scored an average of
six points above the ( hicano Latino
mean and 11 points above the black
mean.
"There alwavs has been some sort

of mvsterv surrounding ihe [racial

disparity] in test
scores." said Stan
ford Law School
Dean Paul Brest.
These tests are
"full of cultural bi
ases" that prevent
the minorities from
scoring well, ac
cording to second

year-law student Melissa Bianchi. "1
think (the ratio of minorities] at Stan
ford is pretty good, compared to
other law schools," she said
According to the I -aw School's Di
rector of Admissions and Financial
Aid Favc Deal. minorit\ applicants

are harder to come by in a general ap
plicant pool. However, she said, "the
school has no set quota for minorities
that we have to fulfill."
Second-year law student Katnna
Waiters, a black student who did not
take preparatory courses, attributed
the racial imbalance in law schools to
class and income differences. "As a
group, you have more white people
that have gotten that far in their edu
cation. rhey have a college degree."
lTÂ»e admissions office considers
LSAI scores, gTadc-pomt average,
work experience and extracurricular
activities of each applicant 1 lowever.
