Romance? Adventure?
Summer Travel?
Are you a smart woman who'd enjoy joining a warm, highly intelligent man to:
• Cruise the Greek Isles?
• Flirt with luck in Monte Carlo?
• Skinny-dip on the French Riviera?
• See how fast they REALLY drive on the German Autobahn?
• Learn & grow by experiencing emotions at the Berlin Wall?
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marty. I'm an incredibly nice, nonsmok
ing single white male attorney. I love cats, including my Tiggy! I've traveled to
every continent (except Antarctica!). I'm in my 30's. My other interests are: Swimming,
Aqua Aerobics, Comedy, Humor, Relationship Psych., Communication, Swedish
Massage, Blackjack, Star Trek, & Lots of Concerts — soft, soul & dance!
The qualities I offer are: emotional openness & warm communication, exceptional
intellect (150 IQ), being lovingly sensual, & adventurous. I'm spiritually oriented,
but not religious. I seek a special, single or divorced, childless woman, weighing under
199 lbs., 20-30's, who's not religious, to join me on this summer trip. Possibly leading
to other travel and even a more permanent "journey?"
You should possess these qualities, which also describe me:
• A nonsmoker only - as I'm allergic to the stuff! (Stepping outside is not enough!)
• Incredibly nice - enjoys caring, pleasing, reciprocating to who cares for her.
• Highly intelligent - to be able to truly enjoy and interact with a top 1% guy.
• Career - using her intellect, or, if a student, has career or graduate school goals.
• Emotionally warm — like me, with a truly loving sweet side.
• Adventurous - would enjoy ALL of these adventures. No scaredy cats please!
• Communicative - saying it nicely without raised volumes, and no mind reading!
• Looks - what's inside the gift, that is a woman, is more important than the
"wrapping."
If these qualities describe you, please tell me how they do & how they do not? What
do you seek in a man? Please include your phone. Photo appreciated, not required.
Martin Firman, Law Offices, 606 S. 9th St., Las Vegas, NV 89101, or E-MAIL:

During May, I'll be in the Bay Area: Fri. & Sat. 5/15-16; or Sat. eve., & Sun.
