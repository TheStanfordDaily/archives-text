SERIES LIFE BY THE NUMBERS
by Keith Devlin, Senior
Researcher at Stanford's
Center for the Study of
Language and Information
A lively and visually striking Introduction to the remarkable range
of ways in which math shapes our lives. Beautifully illustrated with
over 160 photos and illustrations, it reveals that math, like its
cousin, science, has the power to amaze us with its masterful han
dling of chaos, its ability to reveal the mystery behind natural phe
nomena, and its uncanny knack for transforming the ordinary into
the extraordinary. Keith Devlin explores the vital role math plays in
such diverse areas as sports, space exploration, the mapping of
the ocean floor, the patterns of nature, cinematic special effects,
and more.
