# Caucus reports on female profs
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
j Both Provost Condoleezza Rice
and a committee of women faculty will
paluate the status of Stanford's ef
forts to achieve gender equity in the
professoriate in separate reports at
today's Faculty Senate meeting,
i Rice is giving her annual report on

the status of women faculty, while six members of the
Faculty Women's Caucus will offer a somewhat differ
ent take on the situation in a report of their own.
, The 16-page report from the women's caucus con
cludes that while the University is making some
progress in hiring and promoting more women, it has
created an atmosphere unfriendly to female faculty
members at the same time.
i With the report, the caucus committee meant to ad
dress that perception, rather than any quantitative prob
lems, said Sociology Prof. Cecilia Ridgeway, who will
present the findings to the senate.
"The fact is that there's a perceived problem about
whether the atmosphere is conducive to gender equity
on campus," Ridgeway said. "And that perception itself
needs to be addressed."
But Rice, who for the second year in a row will be re
porting to the senate on the status of women faculty, said
SStanford continues to address the issue and is not doing
kvorse than its peer institutions.
"I don't believe myself that there is a crisis," she said.
"I think Stanford is a good place for women."
I"It turns out to be a tough place to get tenure," she
added, "but I don't think there's anything systematic
that unfairly discriminates against women."
Subconscious biases, however, probably do exist,
poth Rice and the committee agree. Like a February re
port from the Women's Coalition for Gender Equity,
the new report examines subtle biases that make gender
discrimination more difficult to fight.
Citing a number of scholarly sources, the committee
— which in addition to Ridgeway included History
Profs. Estelle Freedman and Nancy Kollman, Assoc.
History Profs. Mary Louise Roberts and Paula Findlen
and Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra Sat/ — calls for an
open discussion of bias on decisions in hiring and tenure.
"Gender bias is very difficult to detect," the report
concludes. "The fact that these biases do not operate at
a conscious level makes them all the more pernicious."
Regardless of whether biases are conscious, Stanford
still lags behind in the hiring and promotion of women
faculty, according to the report, which also notes that is
sues of minority faculty are similar.
Women made up 18.1 percent of the overall faculty
for the 1997-98 year and 13.3 percent of tenured faculty
