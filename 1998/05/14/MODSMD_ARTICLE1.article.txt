# Caucus reports on female profs
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
j Both Provost Condoleezza Rice
and a committee of women faculty will
paluate the status of Stanford's ef
forts to achieve gender equity in the
professoriate in separate reports at
today's Faculty Senate meeting,
i Rice is giving her annual report on

the status of women faculty, while six members of the
Faculty Women's Caucus will offer a somewhat differ
ent take on the situation in a report of their own.
, The 16-page report from the women's caucus con
cludes that while the University is making some
progress in hiring and promoting more women, it has
created an atmosphere unfriendly to female faculty
members at the same time.
i With the report, the caucus committee meant to ad
dress that perception, rather than any quantitative prob
lems, said Sociology Prof. Cecilia Ridgeway, who will
present the findings to the senate.
"The fact is that there's a perceived problem about
whether the atmosphere is conducive to gender equity
on campus," Ridgeway said. "And that perception itself
needs to be addressed."
But Rice, who for the second year in a row will be re
porting to the senate on the status of women faculty, said
SStanford continues to address the issue and is not doing
kvorse than its peer institutions.
"I don't believe myself that there is a crisis," she said.
"I think Stanford is a good place for women."
I"It turns out to be a tough place to get tenure," she
added, "but I don't think there's anything systematic
that unfairly discriminates against women."
Subconscious biases, however, probably do exist,
poth Rice and the committee agree. Like a February re
port from the Women's Coalition for Gender Equity,
the new report examines subtle biases that make gender
discrimination more difficult to fight.
Citing a number of scholarly sources, the committee
— which in addition to Ridgeway included History
Profs. Estelle Freedman and Nancy Kollman, Assoc.
History Profs. Mary Louise Roberts and Paula Findlen
and Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra Sat/ — calls for an
open discussion of bias on decisions in hiring and tenure.
"Gender bias is very difficult to detect," the report
concludes. "The fact that these biases do not operate at
a conscious level makes them all the more pernicious."
Regardless of whether biases are conscious, Stanford
still lags behind in the hiring and promotion of women
faculty, according to the report, which also notes that is
sues of minority faculty are similar.
Women made up 18.1 percent of the overall faculty
for the 1997-98 year and 13.3 percent of tenured faculty


Rice
for the 1996-97 year, the report says
— numbers that vary by school.
About 21 percent of the faculty of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences is female, compared to 25 per
cent in medicine, 8 percent in earth
sciences and 6 percent in engineer
ing.
Departments vary even more
widely. The committee reported
that 41 percent of departments in
the School of Engineering have ei
ther never hired or never promoted
a female assistant professor — the
same percentage as in the School of

Humanities and Sciences.
Such statistics, the report argues,
show the danger of assuming that
some areas — such as engineering
— have the most difficulty in diver
sifying. Measured as a percentage,
the Graduate School of Business
has improved the most, increasing
its proportion of women faculty
from 7.7 percent in 1992-93 to 15.3
percent this year.
Overall, trends show only three
out of every 10 professors hired dur
ing the past five years has been fe
male, according to the report, mean
ing the diversity of the faculty will
remain virtually unchanged during
the next decade.
Although the promotion, not hir

ing, of women faculty has been the
focus of recent campus discontent,
the report found that between 1976
and 1997, "promotion rates of men
and women faculty are indistin
guishable."
A number of steps have been
taken in the past few years to ensure
that women have an equal chance of
earning tenure, the report says, in
cluding the creation of a new vice
provost position to support junior
faculty and a task force on diversity
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
And while the report praises
those efforts, it says they may not be
enough. Primarily, its authors call
for an investigation of whether affir

mative action is an appropriate con
sideration in promotions. Rice
stands firmly against that position.
"I very strongly feel that tenure is
an evaluation," she said. "You've
had seven years to prove it. If we
start to introduce affirmative action
politics into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
Affirmative action is appropriate
in hiring, she said, but when consid
ering a promotion, "what has to be
judged is the record. That for me is a
matter of principle."
In addition to considering affir
mative action, the committee asks
the senate to discuss several other
proposals and pass a resolution re
newing its 1993 request that "the

University treat concerns about the
status of women faculty at Stanford
with the utmost seriousness."
Despite improvements, "a mood
of crisis and low morale character
ized not only many women faculty
members but also many junior and
minority faculty at Stanford," the
report said, resulting from "an un
easy sense that the University's
commitment to diversity was declin
ing and squeezing out many of the
strongest women and minority ju
nior faculty members."
Without more work, the report
warns, both junior and senior
women will leave Stanford at a cost
"incalculable" to the University as
a whole.
