# Murderer goes free
## Burke trades testimony for immunity 
### 
BOSTON (AF) â€” Federal pros
ecutors thought they had a pretty
good handle on John Burke when
they talked the tough guy from the
Boston neighborhood of
Charlestown into ratting out his
brother and friends for a deadly
armored ear robbery.
They didn't realize they may
have helped Burke get away with
murder.
After striking a deal last Novem
ber in which he got immunity from
prosecution and a lesser sentence in
return for his testimony, Burke
admitted to prosecutors that he had
gunned down a man in a driveway
18 years ago.
Burke, 43. told a jury in New
Hampshire the same thing days
later as he testified about a string of
robberies, including a 1992 holdup
in which two armored car guards
were killed. David Vicinanzo, the
assistant U.S. attorney in New
Hampshire who prosecuted the
robbers, said he didn't expect a
murder confession.
But once Burke told prosecutors
about the 1980 shooting, it, too,
became protected under an agree
ment that said his statements in the
armored car trial could not be used
"directly or indirectly" against him.
In Massachusetts, Suffolk Coun
ty prosecutors can charge him only
if they can show Burke was a sus
pect before he admitted the killing.

"The fact is. the only reason that
they would have known that John
Burke was even connected to that
homicide is if he opened up his
mouth." Vicinanzo said.
Boston police said the case is still
open. They would not say whether
Burke has ever been a suspect.
Burke admitted killing 27-vear
old Stephen R. Hughes, who was
gunned down outside his apartment
while unloading groceries.
According to news accounts at
the time, two men pulled up in a
black Camaro and shot Hughes five
times. His pregnant wife, Carolyn,
found her husband dead in a pool
of blood. She went into labor and
gave birth prematurely the follow
ing morning. She could not be
located for comment on this story.
Burke testified that he shot
Hughes in self-defense because
Hughes was a hitman who was try
ing to kill him: "I had to eliminate
him before he eliminated me, so I
killed him."
Burke's testimony broke the
"code of silence" in Charlestown, a
tough Irish neighborhood of corner
taverns and brick housing projects
where a gang of criminals often
escaped prosecution because neigh
bors were too scared to open their
mouths. Between 1975 and 1994.49
people were killed in Charlestown.
Arrests occurred in only 26 of the
cases.
