# India sets off two more bombs
## U.S. and other nations rush to stop nuclear arms

NEW DELHI, India (AP)
India set off two more underground
nuclear explosions yesterday, even
as President Clinton ordered up
tough new sanctions as punishment
for the nation's nuclear test blasts.
Sounding like a cold warrior,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee insisted the five surprise
tests this week were necessary to
protect his country in a nuclear
world — a need that outweighs the
world condemnation they have
brought.
"Some countries think only of
their own security and that they
alone can take steps using nuclear
technology to protect their borders
and that others cannot do so. We
cannot accept this," Vajpayee said.
Three underground nuclear

explosions Monday and two more
yesterday prompted the United
States and other countries to
announce immediate sanctions in
an urgent attempt to stop a new
nuclear arms race.
But the tests were welcomed in
India, which suffers from poverty
and ethnic and class divisions, as a
sign of power, scientific sophistica
tion and its ability to stand up to
world opinion.
"Ideally, I'd like a nuclear-free
world. But that's not the reality
today," Vajpayee told supporters
gathered outside his home to show
er him with rose petals and hail him
as a hero. Vajpayee has said india
faces nuclear threats from neigh
boring China and Pakistan, with
whom India has fought four wars in

the last 50 years.
China is known to have devel
oped nuclear weapons and Pakistan
is suspected of it.
China did not immediately com
ment yesterday, though it con
demned Monday's tests. Pakistan
was determined to respond with its
own tests since "it seems that the
Indian leadership has gone
berserk." Pakistani Foreign Minis
ter Gohar Ayub said.
India also said it was prepared to
reopen talks on the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, hut this time as a
nuclear state.
India refused to sign the treaty
approved in 19%. saying it froze the
advantage of nations such as the
United States and France that
already tested and refined sophisti

cated nuclear weapons.
The treaty does not require
countries to give up their existing
nuclear weapons.
In India, all the five tests were
conducted near Pokaran in the
Thar desert, 330 miles southwest of
New Delhi. None released radioac
tivity into the atmosphere, the gov
ernment said.
The government said yesterday's
explosions measured less than 1
kiloton — much smaller than Mon
day's. which international monitors
estimated at 10 kilotons. The bomb
the United States dropped on
Hiroshima was 15 kilotons.
The ban on loan and guarantees
could prevent Indian companies
from raising capital for joint ven
tures with U.S. companies.
