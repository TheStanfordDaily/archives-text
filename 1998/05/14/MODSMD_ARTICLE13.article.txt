JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)
Street violence took hold yesterday
in Indonesia's capital, where mobs
battled security forces, looted and
set lire to dozens of buildings in a
growing uprising against President
Suharto.
For the second day, police fired
rubber bullets and live ammunition
into crowds, badly wounding at
least 10 people, student activists
said. On Tuesday, security forces
shot dead six student demonstra
tors.
They were the first student
deaths in three months of campus
based protests against Suharto, who
is weathering the worst economic
crisis of his three-decade rule and

increasing demands for democratic
reform.
Yesterday's violence broke out
after students clashed with police
following a massive memorial ser
vice for the dead protesters at
Jakarta's Trisakti University, the
site of Tuesday's shootings.
The concentration of police at
the university created a security
vaccuum in other parts of the capi
tal, apparently encouraging poor
workers and unemployed young
people to start rioting and looting.
Those involved have suffered the
most under Indonesian's current
harsh economic conditions.
There were more than a half
dozen flashpoints in the city, includ

ing a predominately ethnic Chinese
quarter in west Jakarta. Alter dusk,
mobs looted and attacked shops
and houses, witnesses said.
Chinese people make up a tiny
fraction of Indonesia's population
but dominate commerce and indus
try. Many Indonesians resent their
wealth and frequently make them
scapegoats in tough times.
Major roads were blocked as
hundreds of rioters threw rocks and
bottles at police. They set up
makeshift roadblocks and lit bon
fires as night fell. Water cannons
dispersed unruly crowds as armed
troops climbed down ropes from
helicopters.
Student leaders told reporters

that people rioting outside the cam
puses were not students, and they
urged their classmates not to join
the rioters.
Unconfirmed reports said foreign
companies were planning to evacu
ate employees and dependents,
while the embattled Indonesian cur
rency'. the rupiah. dropped about 15
percent in value. The once-thriving
stock market plunged 8 percent.
Violence also broke out last
week after Suharto imposed tough
new austerity measures under a $43
billion rescue plan imposed by the
International Monetary Fund.
The result was riots and looting in
the nation's third-largest city.
Medan.
