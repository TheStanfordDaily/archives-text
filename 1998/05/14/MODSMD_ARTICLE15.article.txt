# Ex-general snubs Netanyahu
## Anxieties raised about far-right revolt in Israel

JERUSALEM (AP) — Hawkish ex-general Ariel
Sharon openly challenged Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu yesterday by refusing to join him in a diplo
matic trip to Washington, raising anxiety about a far
right revolt against the prime minister.
Sharon is a pivotal figure in Netanyahu's Cabinet,
and his snub made glaring the weaknesses of
Netanyahu's coalition government as the Israeli leader
headed into talks with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
Sharon is trying to block Netanyahu from accepting
a U.S. proposal that calls for Israel to cede another 13
percent of the territory to the Palestinians — a compro
mise aimed at breaking the 14-month logjam in peace
talks.
The former defense minister, who argues that any
thing beyond a percent withdrawal will compromise
Israeli security, could try to topple Netanyahu if he suc
cumbs to U.S. pressure on the scope of withdrawal.
"If Sharon says he won't support it. Netanyahu's sit
uation will be very grave." said Reuven Rivlin. a law
maker from Netanyahu's Likud Party.
In a statement released yesterday from New York.
Sharon said he saw no reason to meet with Albright
before the Israeli Cabinet had voted on the U.S.-spon
sored pullback plan.
"It is not in niv interest ... to mislead the secretary

of state," said Sharon, who serves as infrastructures
minister in the Cabinet.
Netanyahu said that he would not comment directly
on Sharon's action. Instead he offered this statement, "I
expect every minister, at this difficult hour, to give me
their support. I am doing what is necessary and fighting
with all my strength to protect our vital interests for
Israel's future." the prime minister told Israel TV in
Washington.
Relations between Netanyahu and Sharon have
been lukewarm at best. Sharon was very instrumental in
rallying key religious and settler support for
Netanyahu's election in IWb. but Netanyahu then tried
to shut him out. fearing the seasoned politician would
seek to undercut him.
Finally, after pressure from inside Likud, Netanyahu
created the powerful Infrastructures Ministry especially
for Sharon.
Netanyahu hammered together a diverse coalition of
parties to get the one-seat majority in parliament that
he needs to govern, and Sharon's potential to scuttle the
U.S. plan is emblematic of the far-right's ability to hold
Netanyahu to their agenda.
Last year, during initial talks on a troop withdrawal
from the West Bank. Netanyahu brought Sharon into
the inner circle of decision-makers, sending a signal to
the Palestinians that he would not make concessions.
