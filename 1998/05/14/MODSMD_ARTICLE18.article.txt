## Editorial Continue course guide 
### 
Long-term continuity
is key to the ASSU's
credibility

WITH THE ELECTION
safely behind it, the ASSU
is undergoing its annual
transition. As new faces occupy old
offices, priorities of student govern
ment will likely shift as well.
We hope that one of these priorities
— an informative and useful course
guide — will remain high on the
ASSU's list.
The annual change of guard is a nec
essary consequence of the popular
election of student leaders. Ironically,
it can also seriously undermine the
ASSU's credibility, especially when it
comes to long-term negotiations with
the administration.
While the turnover of student politi
cians occurs annually. University poli
cy changes at a snail's pace. The time
frame of effective student advocacy
efforts should, then, ideally span many
years.
Thus, every time the administration
tries to address the priorities of stu
dent politicians, it runs the risk that the
winner of the next election will not be
interested in the same issues. The
result is a disincentive for the Univer
sity to pay attention to the ASSU.
We urge Maren Norton, the newly
elected ASSU president, to make sure
that this unfortunate reality does not
threaten the course guide, one of this
year's most promising projects.
Although its first edition was less than
stellar, the very fact that the Universi
ty administration released important
data from class evaluations was an
important success for student advo
cates.

Now, the ASSU must convince stu
dents and administrators that the
course guide will live on and keep
improving. While some negotiation
with the administration lies ahead, the
biggest challenge facing the course
guide is consistent, long-term produc
tion. Consistent? Long term? At least
partly because of annual elections,
these are not staple adjectives of the
ASSU's political wing.
It took the efforts of student politi
cians to get the course guide started;
now student entrepreneurs should
make it a lasting, quality publication.
Accordingly, we urge Norton to move
production aspects of the course guide
to Stanford Student Enterprises, an
organization with a track record of
continuity.
In making this recommendation, we
recognize that publishing the course
guide may never become a revenue
generating project. However, a perma
nent structure for producing it should
place the ASSU in a better position to
ask the administration to help fund
the publication.
Indeed, we believe that the course
guide should be funded by the Univer
sity and created by students. The for
mer because it offers a crucial academ
ic service to undergraduates; the latter
because it must maintain the credibili
ty of uncensored peer advice.
No doubt, this proposal will be hard
to sell to the administration, mainly
because it would be asked to put a
great deal of faith (and some money)
into the work of student leaders.
In order to keep its part of the bar
gain, the political side of the ASSU
ought to demonstrate that the course
guide will stay as individual students
come and go. Moving the publications
production to an organization with
long-term continuity, like SSE, would
be a wise step in that direction.
