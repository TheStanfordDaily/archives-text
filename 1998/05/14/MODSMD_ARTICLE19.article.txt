A more secure Israel
The barrage of letters criticizing Aly
Remtulla's now infamous Israel column
have prompted a series of letters in his
defense.
I write in response to the recent letters
which largely fail to grasp a fundamental
driving force in Israeli politics — the need for
security.
Remtulla's defenders have wisely and tac
tically refrained from hacking some of his
more absurd claims — that Israel was an
imperialist construct of racist anti-Semites in
the American and British governments, that
Israel is a failure because there are still Jews
residing outside of it, and his unfounded
attack on the Jewish community for its
alleged inaction in the face of the horrors in
Bosnia and Rwanda.
Instead they have, validly, pointed at
Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip as a reason not to
blindly celebrate this anniversary.

They are right to condemn the actions of
Israeli police in the Territories and right to
call for the establishment of a Palestinian
state.
Any practical and fair solution must pro
vide land, autonomy and a means to eco
nomic prosperity for the Palestinians. How
ever, this is only half of the picture — the
needs of Israelis must also be addressed.
Remtulla and his defenders err when they
ignore the Israeli perspective, particularly
the experience of living in a state that was
under siege for decades, and still suffers from
terrorist atrocities.
Their treatment of the first three decades
of Israel's existence lacks any recognition of
the fact that Israel faced several dire threats
to its own security, including several attempt
ed invasions.
In effect, they fault Israel for somehow
failing to conclude peace with states that
seemed intent on its destruction — states
which hosted terrorists and often crafted pol
icy statements in extremely anti-Semitic
terms.

Today, Israel enjoys perhaps the greatest
degree of military security in its history.
However, the attacks of terrorist groups such
as Hamas and Hezbollah have made Israelis
doubt the capacity of the peace process to
allow them to feel safe in their own state —
leading to the regrettable results of the 19%
Israeli election.
The implication of 1996 is clear — any set
tlement must contain some visible provisions
for Israel's security.
Over the last 50 years, many innocent
Israelis have been subject to brutal, indis
criminate violence. Their need for some level
of security is nothing to scoff at.
There is a dual meaning to Israel's s()th
anniversary. Israelis should celebrate the
success of their state in providing sanctuary
to refugees, in developing its economy, and
in surviving in an often hostile region.
At the same time, Israelis should realize
that much remains unaccomplished. In order
to build a lasting peace, Israel must reason
ably address the needs of its Palestinian pop
ulation. Then we will all have an anniversary

worth celebrating.

Respect campus sculptures
The article "Frisbee Golf Good Fun for
Everyone" in Wednesday's Daily includes
campus sculpture as one of the "endless
possibilities" of targets for Frisbee golf.
Works of outdoor art on campus are a
valuable resource that should be respected
and protected by the campus community,
not misused and abused as Frisbee targets.
The Panel for Outdoor Art, which is
comprised of members of the Stanford fac
ulty and administration, Stanford students
and individuals in the community, is
charged by the University to select and
maintain these sculptures for the education
and enjoyment of all.
We do not object to the idea of Frisbee
golf, but wish to remind Frisbee golfers and

others that campus sculptures are works of
cultural property and should be treated as
such.
