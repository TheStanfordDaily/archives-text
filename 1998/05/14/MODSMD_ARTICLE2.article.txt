# Marlowe subject of Riggs biography
## 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
It's a challenge to tell the life
story of someone you've never met
1.. who also happened to live 400
years ago.
But that didn't stop English
Prof. David Riggs from deciding to
do just that over the next year and a
half. He is preparing a biography on
16th-century playwright Christo
pher Marlowe and has the backing
of two prestigious research awards
to support his work.
I Riggs was recently awarded
grants by the Guggenheim Founda
tion and the National Endowment
for the Humanities. He said he was
''very pleasantly surprised" to re
ceive both grants, which will allow
him to devote research time to the
project.
"Nasty, Brutish and Brilliant:
The Life of Christopher Marlowe"
is the title of Riggs' new work, and
he enjoys the challenge of bringing
the mysterious contemporary of
Shakespeare to life,
t "Marlowe is an interesting
topic," Riggs said. "People say a lot
about him, but there aren't a lot of
first-person utterances [from Mar

lowe himself]."
Marlowe was born into a poor
family in 1564, the same year as
William Shakespeare's birth. He
was educated at Cambridge Uni
versity's Corpus Christi College —
unusual for someone from a lower
social class.
"Marlowe was the son of a poor
man and basically gate-crashed the
educational system," Riggs ex
plained.
Cambridge authorities had some
difficulty with Marlowe, who re
fused to take holy orders at the
school, according to a literature
World Wide Web page. Although
Cambridge finally granted Mar
lowe his Master of Arts degree in
1587, his name had become linked
to a growing atheist movement.
"The topic that swirls around
[Marlowe] is atheism," Riggs said.
Although nearly a dozen contem
poraries called the writer an atheist,
it is not clear if he truly was in
volved in the movement.
"Whether or not he was an athe
ist," Riggs contended, "he was an
important figure in atheism."
Although Marlowe finally had
his Cambridge degree, he was con
sidered overeducated for his social

class and was unable to get an acad
emic position within the church. So
in 1587. he began writing plays and
set the stage for one of theater's
most influential periods.
"He was present at the concep
tion of unrhymed metered verse,
and he pretty much teaches Shake
speare how to do it," Riggs said.
Marlowe's six-year playwriting ca
reer established his place as a major
dramatist and yielded influential
works such as "Doctor Faust us."
"Tamburlaine." "The Jew of
Malta" and "Edward 11."
Marlowe's death remains the
center of much intrigue. According
to the Web site, he was killed in a
tavern brawl on May 30,1593 at the
age of 29. Some scholars believe his


Riggs
murder was part of a deliberate as
sassination plot.
During that time, Riggs ex
plained. there was agitation against
the British crown, and the queen
began rounding up people, includ
ing Marlowe and Thomas Kyd. who
were suspected of being "Puritan
separatists."
"Kyd was broken on the rack,
literally," he said. "Marlowe goes
to a private meeting with three
other men — one of whom is a
queen's security officer — and he

dies from a puncture wound
through the eye."
Putting together the pieces of
such a short but dramatic life is not
easy.
"The question of writing about a
life you don't know anything about
is an interesting philosophical and
intellectual question," Riggs said.
"Biographies are suspect be
cause it's hard to get inside some
one's head. [With Marlowe], you
can't even have that pretense if
there are no first-person state
ments."
No letters or diaries written by
Marlowe have survived, so Riggs is
turning to other sources to help him

reconstruct the intriguing details of
the writer's brief life.
"In looking at how such a figure
was produced ... we are recon
structing the institutions [of which
he was a part]," Riggs said.
He and several research assis
tants are now methodically sorting
through the names and short bi
ographies of all young men who at
tended Corpus Christi College be
tween 1580 and 1587.
"We also have Xeroxes of all the
lessons from the textbooks that
they would have used," said Riggs,
who also uses the historical text
copies in literature courses.
Riggs, who is a native of Cincin

nati, came to Stanford in 1969 after
receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard
University. He became interested
in Elizabethan playwrights after
"getting hooked on Shakespeare as
an undergrad." His interest in the
period led him to write a biography
of Ben Jonson, which was pub
lished in 1989.
"1 enjoyed writing the Jonson
book enormously from the point of
view of telling a story," Riggs said.
The last biography about Jonson
had been written in 1925.
He sees "Nasty, Brutish and
Brilliant" as filling a similar niche.
The last biography of Christopher
Marlowe was written in 1945.
