# Marlowe subject of Riggs biography
## 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
It's a challenge to tell the life
story of someone you've never met
1.. who also happened to live 400
years ago.
But that didn't stop English
Prof. David Riggs from deciding to
do just that over the next year and a
half. He is preparing a biography on
16th-century playwright Christo
pher Marlowe and has the backing
of two prestigious research awards
to support his work.
I Riggs was recently awarded
grants by the Guggenheim Founda
tion and the National Endowment
for the Humanities. He said he was
''very pleasantly surprised" to re
ceive both grants, which will allow
him to devote research time to the
project.
"Nasty, Brutish and Brilliant:
The Life of Christopher Marlowe"
is the title of Riggs' new work, and
he enjoys the challenge of bringing
the mysterious contemporary of
Shakespeare to life,
t "Marlowe is an interesting
topic," Riggs said. "People say a lot
about him, but there aren't a lot of
first-person utterances [from Mar

lowe himself]."
Marlowe was born into a poor
family in 1564, the same year as
William Shakespeare's birth. He
was educated at Cambridge Uni
versity's Corpus Christi College â€”
unusual for someone from a lower
social class.
"Marlowe was the son of a poor
man and basically gate-crashed the
educational system," Riggs ex
plained.
Cambridge authorities had some
difficulty with Marlowe, who re
fused to take holy orders at the
school, according to a literature
World Wide Web page. Although
Cambridge finally granted Mar
lowe his Master of Arts degree in
1587, his name had become linked
to a growing atheist movement.
"The topic that swirls around
[Marlowe] is atheism," Riggs said.
Although nearly a dozen contem
poraries called the writer an atheist,
it is not clear if he truly was in
volved in the movement.
"Whether or not he was an athe
ist," Riggs contended, "he was an
important figure in atheism."
Although Marlowe finally had
his Cambridge degree, he was con
sidered overeducated for his social

class and was unable to get an acad
emic position within the church. So
in 1587. he began writing plays and
set the stage for one of theater's
most influential periods.
"He was present at the concep
tion of unrhymed metered verse,
and he pretty much teaches Shake
speare how to do it," Riggs said.
Marlowe's six-year playwriting ca
reer established his place as a major
dramatist and yielded influential
works such as "Doctor Faust us."
"Tamburlaine." "The Jew of
Malta" and "Edward 11."
Marlowe's death remains the
center of much intrigue. According
to the Web site, he was killed in a
tavern brawl on May 30,1593 at the
age of 29. Some scholars believe his
