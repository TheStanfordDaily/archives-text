## A
						heroine with whom to identify 
### 
This weekend,
while I was pro
crastinating on my
theisis writing, I came
across pieces of a fantasy
novel that I had written
the summer after sixth
grade. I had started writ
ing it with a friend, and

when she quit out of boredom, I kept on
going.
I invented characters with unpronounce
able names, who lived as kings and queens
in a sort of medieval Eurocentric world of
castles and bucolic villages. It was a place
where the women were beautiful, the men
were brave and all the villains were old,
shriveled white men like the Emperor from
"The Return of the Jedi." I thought of all of
my characters as being Caucasian, like they
are in all proper fairy tales.
The heroine of my novel was a 15-year
old girl who was orphaned and became the
ruler of her country. She was betrothed by
the time she was 20, because I thought 15
was mature and 20 was over the hill. Fur
thermore, she owned a horse who could
speak to her telepathically.
Therapists might have had a field day
with this preteen angst — "So, you wish
your parents were dead?" when it was real
ly more like, "I wish I had a horse." But
what I realize now is that I wrote about a
heroine I couldn't possibly identify with. In
addition to the fact that she was a spoiled

princess, she had chestnut hair, green eyes
and was unbelievably perky. If she had
existed in this day and age, she would have
been a cheerleader.
Maybe I imagined this character this way
because back then, I had no role models to
write about who resembled myself. I read a
great deal of fantasy and science fiction
when I was growing up. The former always
had an Arthurian tone, while the latter
mostly concerned Europeans colonizing
outer space. The only eharacters I could
convincingly see myself as were the aliens.
Not much has changed, even though I've
graduated to reading more general fiction.
Despite the Maxine Hong Kingston and
Amy Tan phenomenons, I'm encountering
just as few Asian or Asian-American hero
ines. If I want to read a book in class with
such characters, I basically have to take a
course from the Asian Languages Depart
ment.
If I want to see them on the big screen, I
have to go to a film festival (or else wait for
this summer's Disney cartoon). I'm not
even going to talk about television.
No character I have ever imagined,
whether it be back when I was 12 or in the
four fiction writing classes I have taken at
Stanford, was Chinese-American or even
Asian. Each character has parts of me in
them, but not the most obvious one — eth
nicity.
I have heard people say that they don't
want to bring ethnicity into their writing

because they want their writing to be uni
versal. They don't want to make race (an
"issue." They don't want to be typecast iAto
writing solely about immigration laws and
concentration camps and prejudice — the
kinds of things that made their ancestors'
lives miserable. Certainly, some of this is
what 1 have said to myself.
You can also believe that whatever you
write is about yourself. You can't hide
behind your name, because chances hre
,anyone who reads it will be able to guess
the general vicinity of where your parents
came from. And if where you come from is
important to you. it will make itself evident.
A friend who was Asian American once
told me that 1 didn't act "Asian" at ali. I
took that as a compliment. I couldn't
change the way 1 looked, but I could change
the way 1 acted. I could write about charac
ters who lacked the part of me that I didn't
want to identify with.
But identity has to do with being com
fortable with every aspect of yourself,
whether it's something as significant as
where your parents came from, or as trivial
as the shape of your eyes. Because when
either starts becoming a source of discom
fort, it can leave you with no one to write
about at all.

Wendy Lee, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, wants to know why
there aren't any Asian-American women
singing in the Lilith Fair.
