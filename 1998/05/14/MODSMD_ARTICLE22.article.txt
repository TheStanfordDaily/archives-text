# Bordering on slander
## T.J. Babbitt Heartfelt confessions of a Daily columnist 
### 
HEY! WHAT do you want, any
way? That's the question all of the
Daily columnists face each week.
You're a tough crowd to figure out. Since
there are no Nielsen ratings for newspapers,
it's always a bit of a puzzle to figure out
who's reading and why. When have we
done our job?
A colleague of mine told me that she
thought a successful column was one that
generated lots of letters to the editor. That's
as close as you can get to a ratings point in
the world of print media, unless you send
out spies to CIV lectures and Jamba Juice to
watch what people are reading.
But you see the problem — to get a flood
of mail, all a columnist has to do is mention
an inflammatory issue (the Greek system,
California table grapes, Israel). But that's
no guarantee that the less assertive, silent
majority of non-letter-writing Daily readers
is being well served.
•.Maybe they'd prefer a heartwarming
anecdote about my weekend, or perhaps
they'd enjoy some non-controversial book
recommendations. Who knows?

The more I write, the less I know what
people want to read.
A better proof of "success" than mail is
when people I don't know approach me and
start talking to me about something I wrote,
as though we were continuing a personal
conversation. That smudgy, glisteningly
sweaty, frowning face at the top of the col
umn doesn't look very much like me, but
apparently it is enough for people to go by.
One of the first times that ever happened
was with a column I wrote criticizing The
Review. People thanked me for doing such
a good hatchet job, which made me feel a
little uncomfortable.
I had wanted to show that The Review
could be a better paper if it were more
focused. Its writers ramble on about nation
al topics and Stanford topics and what
movies they've seen recently as though peo
ple at Stanford had nothing better to do
than read every single thought they ever
had. My (well-hidden) point was that if it
were more consistent, it would have a more
consistent readership.
Personally, I wish The Review would

compete directly with The Daily and write
well-researched stories about Stanford. Or
it could be a political review or a cultural
magazine. It just needs to be something.
A later column made a far bigger splash,
even though it didn't draw any letters to the
editor. I'm sure it was my most successful
attempt at connecting with a readership.
The column was venomously critical of Res
idential Education.
Remember when Res Ed administrators
decided to eliminate Alpha Sig for not
being part of its glorious — yet eternally
mysterious — mission? Apparently that
ticked off a lot of people.
My e-mail inbox starting filling up that
morning and didn't stop for a couple of
days. People stopped me on the way to class
to thank me for writing the column, and
even came up to me at parties to talk about
how angry they were at Res Ed. Within a
few days I felt like I had heard enough oral
histories to write a book about Res Ed
wrongdoing in the 19905.
Did the column do any good? Well, jour
nalists believe that telling the truth is a suc

cess in and of itself. But. sadly, the answer is
no — Res Ed didn't take away Alpha Sig
because it failed to understand student
opinion. It did that because it doesn't care
about student opinion. Until it does, our
efforts are in vain. Jumping onto the hand
wagon and writing a column critical of an
office that has made hundreds of students
hopping mad is one way to get read. Anoth
er surefire way to get noticed is to make a
mistake in an ASSU election endorsement.
A few weeks ago I implied that former
ASSU presidential candidate Matt Spence
had been paid for his work on the ASSU
course guide. The friend 1 quoted was incor
rect in believing that he had been paid. I
apologize for repeating the error.
Fortunately, my mistake was corrected
four times in this paper before and during
the election, sometimes with an amusing
degree of self-righteousness. One delight
fully bombastic letter said that my "lies"
were "a calculated attempt to destroy the
reputations of two students."
As long as I'm on the subject of mistakes,
though. I might as well come clean about

another biggie of my own, one that was not
corrected in multiple letters to the editor. In
the Alpha Sig column, 1 fingered all the
right people for being involved in the deci
sion, but also implied the complicity of
someone who wasn't, our fine young Dean
of Students. It is of course an outrageous
slander to even suggest that someone has
been involved in a Res Ed decision-making
process when he is completely innocent.
Thinking about past successes and fail
ures is fascinating, for me. But that doesn't
help answer the perennial question: What to
write about next week?
I don't have any idea. What do you want
from your Daily dose, reader? You should
drop us a line — Stanford is a small enough
world that your voice has a gcxxi chance of
being heard, at least by us. We always love
eettine mail.
