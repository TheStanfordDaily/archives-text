■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford men and women compete in
the national tournament in South Carolina.
Led by master's student Pete Armitage, Stanford
has cleaned up this year, winning meets throughout the
Western Collegiate Cycling Conference.
This year's national meet is hosted by Clemson and
includes a team time trial course of 12 miles and a road
race of 7K miles for men and 52 miles for women. The
criterium is a timed race of 90 minutes for men and 60
minutes for women.
The women's depth should keep the Cardinal in the
running for another national title. Megan Troxell,
Cynthia Ferguson, Cathy Norbutas and Christine
Thorburn are all medical students, while political sci
ence doctoral student Kelly Chang rounds out the line
up.
"In terms of the depth of the squad, the experience,
our women's should be the best," said head coach Art
Walker.
"The way the scoring is done at nationals, it doesn't
matter how many points you win by — you get points
toward omnium according to your rank.
"It becomes really important to have a good distrib
ution of team results. Our women's team has that."
The men's team is less evenly distributed and will
rely primarily on the efforts of leaders Armitage and
doctoral student Dario Falquier, who have been on the
team for three and four years, respectively.
"We'll take between fourth and eighth in the team
tr al," Walker said.
"I don't know how we'll do in the road race — if Pete
and Dario both have good races, we'll be in the top
three or four, and in the criterium, it pretty much comes
down to Pete."
The men's team will need Scott Crawford and Mike
Ft .• to back up its "big guns." Walker said. Sophomore
W,ll Parks, the only undergraduate on the team, will be
making his first appearance at nationals.
"Will's going in the road race for exposure — 1 want
him to be at ease. 1 want him to be comfortable when he
goes to nationals next year," Walker said.
"Scott and Mike, they have aspirations, but in truth,
they are there as much to perform in the team time trial
a> they are in the mass starts.
"I would be more optimistic knowing these guys, but
historically, it's been only the guys who are real
capons that are going to place well in the mass starts
nationals. There are just too many good riders."
As with any bike race, ho vever, luck will inevitably
I ay a part.
"There's a certain rand mness in bike racing,"
\ alker explained. "It helps 10 have a lot of riders so
v u can get a good team resu t. That's how it should be
v h our women. In our men. we really need to rely on
< big hitters."
)verall. the team can look lor a top-five finish, with
hope of adding another national title to the list of
t, > year's accomplishments.
"I think we'll be in the top four, but will we win? I'm
less optimistic than I was last year," Walker said. "Hut
we'll do all right."
