## At Pac-10s, baseball looks to trump Washington 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
It's all about a little revenge.
Today the No. 1 Cardinal (41-
10-1, 22-8 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) kicks off a best
of-three series as it faces old neme
sis No. 19 Washington in the battle
for the Pac-10 championship.
The Huskies (37-15,17-7 Pac-10
North) beat the Cardinal last May
15-17 at Stanford two games to one
to capture the 1997 conference
title.
"There's a revenge factor from
last season going against the
Huskies," said sophomore first
baseman John Gall. "I know we'll
be up. During the year — whenev
er we've been up and our backs
have been up against the wall
these guys have come through."

first game with a homer in the l()th
by then-junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer to give Stanford a 7-6 victory.
However. Stanford fell prey to
shaky defense and even shakier
pitching in handing the Huskies 13-
8 and 12-9 victories and the Pac-10
title.
And while the defense has solid
ified during the 1998 season, the
pitching arsenal, with the excep
tion of junior ace Jeff Austin, has

been a bit wobbly recently.
Against USC (39-14, 21-9)
Monday night, junior southpaw
Brent Hoard gave up two runs in
three innings and took the loss for
the Cardinal, evening out his win
loss record at 3-3.
The day before, junior Chad
Hutchinson fell prey to a three-run
fastball homer by USC right fielder
Brad Ticehurst in the second.
According to Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, the depth of
the Huskies bullpen will be a
Washington advantage heading
into the championship.
The Huskies will send sopho
more right-hander Jeff Heaverlo
(4-2. 5.76) to the mound for game
one at 3 p.m. today. Marquess will
give the nod to junior right-hander
Chad Hutchinson instead of
Austin.
"I really don't know if 1 want to
start Jeff with only four days rest."
Marquess said. "He's not used to
that. So that's why I limited
Hutchinson's pitches [Sunday
against USC] so if need be .. . we
can start Hutch on Thursday and
Austin on Friday."
In tomorrow's 1 p.m. game,
Austin will return to the rotation to
face freshman rightv Jeff Carlsen
(7-3.4.15).
If Saturday's third game is nec
essary, junior lefty Matt Hampton
;(3-4, 6.of>) will start for the Dawgs
l in a nobn nkvting.
* The Caaftrtal offense will be led

by junior center fielder Jody
Gerut. who leads the Cardinal
squad with a whopping 17 home
runs. Hot on his heels is power hit
ter Gall, with 12 homers.
The Huskies, like the Cardinal
so often this season, have gone on
the unpredictable ride known as
the Pac-10 schedule in their series
matchup against California.
Washington's Kyle Woods' solo
home run in the seventh inning
broke a tie and lifted the Huskies
to an 8-4 win over the last place
Bears (22-32) Sunday at Husky
Ballpark.
The Huskies (37-15) won the
three-game non-conference series
against the Bears two games to
one.
Woods hit the home run. his
13th of the vear. with two down in

the seventh off of Cal reliever
Ryan Drese (3-6), who took the
loss.
The winner of the Pac-10 cham
pionship earns the conference's
automatic berth to the NCAA
Tournament, the field for which
will be announced Monday at noon
on ESPN.
More than likely, however,
Washington will receive an at
large berth even if Stanford wins
the Pac-10 series.
The Cardinal is already guaran
teed a spot in the tournament, as it
was named one of eight regional
hosts Monday.
Should Washington make it to
an NCAA regional, it will mark the
team's fourth NCAA appearance
in the 1990s and its first back-to
back appearances in history.
