It's all about a little revenge.
Today the No. 1 Cardinal (41-
10-1, 22-8 Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division) kicks off a best
of-three series as it faces old neme
sis No. 19 Washington in the battle

The Huskies (37-15,17-7 Pac-10

8 and 12-9 victories and the Pac-10
title.
And while the defense has solid
ified during the 1998 season, the
pitching arsenal, with the excep
tion of junior ace Jeff Austin, has

been a bit wobbly recently.
Against USC (39-14, 21-9)
Monday night, junior southpaw
Brent Hoard gave up two runs in
three innings and took the loss for
the Cardinal, evening out his win

The day before, junior Chad
Hutchinson fell prey to a three-run
fastball homer by USC right fielder
Brad Ticehurst in the second.
According to Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, the depth of
