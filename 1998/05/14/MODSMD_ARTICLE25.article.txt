# Foul balls, physics and the Cubs
## With baseball's draft coming up, life is getting exciting for Jody Gerut 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
There was perhaps one high school
teacher who had more influence on Jody
Gerut than any other person in his life.
An honors physics teacher at Willow
brook High pushed this teenager to the
limits, reminded the school's baseball
phenom that education came first — and
always made sure he wasn't late for din
ner.
"I didn't call him Mr. Gerut — I called
him dad," Stanford's junior center field
er said of his physics instructor. "It was all
right. Everybody knew."
There was no slacking off when it
came to academics in the Gerut house
hold. With two high school teachers for

parents, the eldest child soon learned
what was expected of him. A member of
three national honor societies, a 3.9
grade-point average student and the
Chicago area's baseball player of the
year. Janet and Charles Gerut's little boy
could master everything — except
physics.
"That science gene was not passed on.
I ended up getting a B for the entire
year," he said. "I knew [the situation] was
unique. I didn't abuse the fact that my fa
ther was my in-house tutor. 1 only asked
him questions occasionally. Obviously,
though, he didn't show any favoritism."
Gerut's father might not have picked
favorites in the classroom, hut there was
little doubt as to how proud he was of his
son when major league scouts began call

ing after the boy's 14th birthday.
"He asked me. 'Jody. do you know
what my dream is?'" Gerut recalled.
" 'My dream is for you to give me tickets
to a World Series game that you are play
ing in for the Cubs." "
The younger Gerut grimaced.
"He said that knowing that I was a
White Sox fan at the age of 14. I'd be
caught in the twilight zone," said Gerut,
still an avid Sox fan, of the possibility of
being a Cub. "Fair-weather fans are beat
en up in my town."
Fifteen major league ball clubs have
now contacted Gerut, Stanford's leader
in home runs and RBIs. He's batting .329
with 17 homers and 57 RBIs.
With the draft in less than a month,
teams have been vying for the center

fielder. Among them, the Chicago Cubs.
"They need a center fielder." Gerut
said. "My dad just calmly expressed to
me how he felt about the possibility of
playing for his Cubs, //is Cubs."
He might have thought his father was
joking about the World Series, but all of
a sudden, professional baseball was a lot
closer than it seemed.
In fact. Gerut did not even anticipate
the opportunity of coming to play for the
Stanford Cardinal. The high school All-
American was convinced he would be a
member of the Fighting Irish.
"1 was all set to go to Notre Dame." he
said. "At that point. 1 thought it was what
I wanted to do. Stanford was an option I
