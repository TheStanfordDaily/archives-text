# Foul balls, physics and the Cubs
## With baseball's draft coming up, life is getting exciting for Jody Gerut 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
There was perhaps one high school
teacher who had more influence on Jody
Gerut than any other person in his life.
An honors physics teacher at Willow
brook High pushed this teenager to the
limits, reminded the school's baseball
phenom that education came first — and
always made sure he wasn't late for din
ner.
"I didn't call him Mr. Gerut — I called
him dad," Stanford's junior center field
er said of his physics instructor. "It was all
right. Everybody knew."
There was no slacking off when it
came to academics in the Gerut house
hold. With two high school teachers for

parents, the eldest child soon learned
what was expected of him. A member of
three national honor societies, a 3.9
grade-point average student and the
Chicago area's baseball player of the
year. Janet and Charles Gerut's little boy
could master everything — except
physics.
"That science gene was not passed on.
I ended up getting a B for the entire
year," he said. "I knew [the situation] was
unique. I didn't abuse the fact that my fa
ther was my in-house tutor. 1 only asked
him questions occasionally. Obviously,
though, he didn't show any favoritism."
Gerut's father might not have picked
favorites in the classroom, hut there was
little doubt as to how proud he was of his
son when major league scouts began call

ing after the boy's 14th birthday.
"He asked me. 'Jody. do you know
what my dream is?'" Gerut recalled.
" 'My dream is for you to give me tickets
to a World Series game that you are play
ing in for the Cubs." "
The younger Gerut grimaced.
"He said that knowing that I was a
White Sox fan at the age of 14. I'd be
caught in the twilight zone," said Gerut,
still an avid Sox fan, of the possibility of
being a Cub. "Fair-weather fans are beat
en up in my town."
Fifteen major league ball clubs have
now contacted Gerut, Stanford's leader
in home runs and RBIs. He's batting .329
with 17 homers and 57 RBIs.
With the draft in less than a month,
teams have been vying for the center

fielder. Among them, the Chicago Cubs.
"They need a center fielder." Gerut
said. "My dad just calmly expressed to
me how he felt about the possibility of
playing for his Cubs, //is Cubs."
He might have thought his father was
joking about the World Series, but all of
a sudden, professional baseball was a lot
closer than it seemed.
In fact. Gerut did not even anticipate
the opportunity of coming to play for the
Stanford Cardinal. The high school All-
American was convinced he would be a
member of the Fighting Irish.
"1 was all set to go to Notre Dame." he
said. "At that point. 1 thought it was what
I wanted to do. Stanford was an option I

didn't think 1 was going to have. Ini
tially, I dismissed the thought.' 4
Then came the one at-bat that
changed Gerut's life.
"If you ask me, 1 got to Stanford
because of a foul ball," he said.
Invited to the Team 1 National
Showcase in which the top 60 high
school juniors in the country play be
fore college and professional scouts,
Gerut traveled to Cincinnati to con
tinue making a name for himself.
"The place is packed, and every
person there can make a difference
in your future," Gerut said. "Talk
about pressure."
It rained. It rained the entire
weekend. Most of the games were
called off, and the Chicago native
was forced to settle for three plate
appearances, all of which ended in
walks.
"I was at bat facing a 6-foot-5-
inch giant," Gerut said of one at-bat.
"I stepped up there, and I was scared
to death. The first pitch he threw me
was an inside fastball, and I yanked it
down the line, over the home run
fence ~. foul.
"But Stanford had not seen me
play before or after that. That's all
they had."
A short time later, the Cardinal
called.
"They took a big chance. They
needed an outfielder at the time. I'm
one of the luckiest people on Earth
because I am at a school that I never
thought I'd be able to attend. Every
day I count my blessings."
Now, there is little doubt that the
Stanford veteran has any regrets as
to selecting the Cardinal over the
Irish.
Despite the fact that Stanford has
an in-house rule that only allows
baseball players to receive a 90-per
cent scholarship, whereas Notre
Dame offered him a full ride, Gerut
is bleeding Cardinal red.
"This place sells itself," he said.
"It beats a 100-percent scholarship
at any other school any day of the
week."
One disadvantage, however, has
been the fact that Gerut now lives
across the country from his parents.
With one visit a year from mom and
dad, Gerut's parents don't get to see

him play much. Even when the slug
ger was starting in the College
World Series last season in Omaha.
Neb., his parents only came for two
days.
"My dad doesn't like to miss
school," Gerut said. "Education
first, remember?"
It's little wonder that his father's
philosophy stuck with Gerut. The
first student out of his high school to
attend Stanford, he has been milk
ing it for all it's worth.
Despite the fact that he plans to
leave Stanford to pursue his dreams
of baseball. Gerut is adamant that
he will return in the fall and possibly
winter to earn his degree.

"I'm going to graduate for sure,
because that's what I came to school
for."he said.
With dreams of possibly playing
10 years in the big leagues, followed
by law school. Gerut seems on top of
everything. Perhaps it is his pure tal
ent. his incredible arm. his brains —
or perhaps it is his view of life.
"I'm like a kid in a candy store."
Gerut said. "For me. it's not neces
sarily do what you love. For me. it's
love what you do."
With this outlook on life. Stan
ford's optimistic center fielder
seems to be able to take on anything
in life.
Even playing for the Cubs.

Center fielder Jody Gerut. a junior, will probably leave the Farm this
spring in the 1998 amateur baseball draft. But he has plans: first, pro
ball in the summer and spring; then, after a few years, law school.
