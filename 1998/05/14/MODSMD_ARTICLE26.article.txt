■ Sunday: Stanford men's and women's
varsity, junior varsity and novice crew
teams compete in the Pacific 10 Confer

Each division will have three heats

move on to the finals. Placement in the
heats is determined through seeding
based on each boat's performance so far

this season.
For the novice boats, the top two fin

to the IK A championships May 28-30 in
Camden, N.J.. and the women to the
NCAA championships May in
Gainesville, Ga.
For Kith the varsity and junior varsity
boats, the top three in the final will ad

The men's and women's varsity eights
must face the defending national cham

ington. The Huskies have been picked to
repeat as national champions this season.
The Husky women lost just one mem
ber of their crew from last year's squad,
while the men's varsity boat that went
undefeated last season lost five. That
crew has two senior national team and
world champion members — Bob Cum
mins and coxswain Sean Mulligan.
The Stanford men's team may also
meet preseason No. 2 California
this weekend, possibly in addition
to Oregon State, a team that re
ceived votes in the poll hut not
enough to place it in the top 10.
Cal's Sebastian Boa is also a mem
ber of the world championship
team.
"After two weeks to prepare, our
boats are confident that we will
have a good performance," fresh

man novice rower Joey Elger said.
"We're looking to end our season
on a good note."
For the women's varsity eight,
the Huskies are a clear favorite, but
places two through six are up in the
air.
The Cardinal enters that race as
a No. 6 seed behind Washington.
Washington State, Cal, Oregon
State and USC. Stanford has fin
ished within three to six seconds of
each of these boats this season.
The women's junior varsity boat
enters as a fifth seed.'

"They have been making great
improvements and figuring out
what it takes to be fast," Stanford
women's head coach Aimee Baker
said. "A realistic goal for us is to fin
ish higher than our seed, and we
have a chance to do that."
The women's novice boat has
been awarded the fourth seed for
the races.
"We're very optimistic," Baker
said. "We've geared everything
[this season] toward this weekend,
and it will show what we have ac
