Witt won Ail-American honors four times in high school.
Earlier this season, he was named to the All-MPSF team.
Knight named NBA All-Rookie
Tuesday, the NBA named ex-Stanford basketball player
Brevin Knight to its 1998 All-Rookie Team.
Knight, a point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, was
second in the league with 2.45 steals per game and eighth
with 8.2 assists per game. Both stats were tops among rook
ies this season.
Third in overall voting. Knight received 54 of 56 points
possible in the voting by the NBA's 29 coaches. Two points
are awarded for a first-team vote and one point for a second
team vote. No coach is allowed to vote for his own players.
Rookie of the Year power forward Tim Duncan of San
Antonio and power forward Keith Van Horn of New Jersey
were both chosen for the team unanimously.
The team is rounded out by center Zydrunas Ilgauskas,
Knight's teammate, and Boston Celtic forward Ron Mercer.
Last year with Stanford, Knight led the Cardinal in a sur
prising performance in postseason play. The Card made it to
the Sweet Sixteen in San Jose, where it lost to Utah.
