## Eck talks religion 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
In a speech last night at Kresge
Auditorium, Harvard Comparative
Religions Prof. Diana Eck argued
rttat America is entering a "new reli
gious landscape" in which people
must strive to encounter and learn
from other cultures.
Throughout her lecture, Eck em
phasized that religious and cultural
differences are becoming more visible
In American society, and people must
find ways to live comfortably with this
changing demographic landscape.
• "American society is a history of
religious encounters, and many facts
throughout our history remind us of
religious persecution," Eck said.
. "Even today, stories of vandalism
ire not uncommon, and this goes
along with religion's increasing visi
bility," Eck said, referring to the ten
dency of the media to dramatize reli
gious violence.
; Eck spent considerable time dis
cussing the differences in America's
approach to dealing with religious di
versity. During some parts of Ameri
can history, the government has tried
io exclude those who were not white
and Christian. At other times, she
said, it has encouraged the "melting
pot" ideology in which immigrants

are expected to assimilate into Amer
ican culture and language.
The third model for dealing with di
versity, about which Eck spoke most,
is the emerging notion of pluralism.
"Pluralism is active engagement
with diversity. It is meeting and par
ticipating and learning about others.
In today's society, tolerance does lit
tle to remove ignorance. Pluralism
makes room for an understanding
and appreciation of real religious dif
ferences," Eck said.
Examples of pluralism include in
terfaith councils that sponsor discus
sion about religious differences and
combat violence. Eck also told the
story of a 12-year-old Hindu Girl
Scout who spoke at a White House
ceremony in January 1996 to com
merate the end of the Islamic fasting
period of Ramadan.
Sophomore Deepa Srinivasan en
joyed the lecture. "It made me think
about being an immigrant in America
and the history of other religions."
she said.
Nonetheless. Srinivasan is not sat
isfied with the religious outlook at
Stanford. "People are often caught up
in classes and do not get into real reli
gious conversation. The whole pur
pose of college is to learn about other
people, but for many at Stanford it
doesn't really happen," she added.
