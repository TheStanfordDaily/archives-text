# Memoirist Mah tells childhood tales
## 
### Mariam Ali 
Adeline Yen Mah, author of an autobiography
titled "Falling Leaves", spoke in Kimball Hall yes
terday about her experience as an unwanted
daughter of a Chinese family.
Mah began her address with a ringing declara
tion that the truth had to be told in order for injus
tice to end. Explaining why her book broke tradi
tional taboos of Chinese society, she referred to the
2,(HX)-year Chinese history of female silence and
submission in the face of discrimination.
"Falling Leaves" caused Mah to be ostracized
from her family for disrespecting the memory of
her dead parents, she said.
Mah described how her Eurasian stepmother
divided the family into "two classes of citizens": on
one side, her own favored children, and on the
other, the despised children of the deceased first
wife. Because Mah's mother had died giving birth

to her, Mah was labeled "bad luck" and singled out
for additional discrimination.
During the first 14 years of her life in Shanghai,
Mah never volunteered a single comment at the
dinner table. Her only champion in those lonely
days was a spinster aunt, who was also despised for
being financially dependent on her brother, Mah's
father.
This aunt encouraged her to "prove them
wrong" and succeed in school. She would lock
Mah's report cards in her safety-deposit box and
wear the key around her neck to show Mah how
precious her hard work was.
Mah explained that her life has been a journey
of self-discovery culminating in the writing of her
book, which she called the most important and dif
ficult task she has ever undertaken. She gave up a
lucrative medical practice in Southern California
to commit herself to voicing the tragedies of her
childhood.

More than 2(X),(XX) copies of Mah's hook have
been sold, and NBC has just bought the rights to
the book to create a mini-series scheduled to air
next fall.
The Undergraduate Chinese-American Asso
ciation and Kimball sponsored the author's visit to
campus as part of Asian Pacific Islander Month.
Mah was originally scheduled to speak in Menlo
Park, but the co-chair of the association, Albert
Lin, decided her "very, very inspiring story" de
served to be brought to Stanford students.
Before concluding her lecture and signing
books for the audience, Mah pleaded with students
not to view history as an unimportant part of a dis
tant past, but rather as a lesson for the future.
She said that "Falling Leaves" was intended to
remind the forgotten and abused that "the spirit
can prevail." She ended by claiming that she want
ed to encourage others because "one positive
dream is better than a thousand negative realities."
