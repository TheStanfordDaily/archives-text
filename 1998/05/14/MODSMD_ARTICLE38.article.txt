F. 0.8 8
The Asian American Theater Project produces its first show
in three year. "F. 0.8." was written by Stanford Alum David
Hwang, who also authored "M. Butterfly" and "Golden Child."

The mother-daughter relationship is examined onstage in
the Drama Department's production of "The Memory of
Water."
Film Festival 5
It's cartoon time again! Stanford Flicks has brought back
Spike and Mike for their Classic Festival of Animation, fea
turing the Oscar-winning Pixar production "Geri's Game."
Interview 6
Eric Bogosian. You probably saw him in "Deconstructing
Harry." Maybe you saw the movie based on his play,
"SubUrbia." You might remember him from "Under Siege 2."
He also does stand-up comedy. So you probably know him.
Just guessing.
Books 7
Hugh Gallagher, the guy who wrote the college essay we've
all read or heard about, has FINALLY written his first novel.
It's called "Teeth." We didn't like it.
Music 10
Gaze, Agents of Good Roots, Lou Reed and Tamia. Now
say it five times, fast.
Movies 12
The sky is falling! A comet threatens life as we know it in
"Deep Impact." And if you're not into disaster flicks, you can
see "Woo," "Chinese Box," "In God's Hands" or "Homegrown."
27-word fiction 14
Someday you'll have to fork over some cash to read these
authors' works. For now you can read it free in Intermission.
