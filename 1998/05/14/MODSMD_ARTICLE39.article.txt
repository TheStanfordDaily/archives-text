## Mommy Dearest: The 						Department of Drama presents The Memory of Water’ 
### Alejandro Gramaglia 
During one of the scenes in the first stumble
through of "The Memory of Water," director Jan
Kuzminski's shoulders shake as she tries to contain
her laughter. Once in a while, she just cracks up. So
does the rest of the small audience present. A
minute later, there is complete silence. The scene
she's watching has just shifted from light to
somber with a quick slip of the tongue. The mood
recaptures its former lightness moments later.
Then it becomes dark again.
"The Memory of Water" is young British play
wright Shelagh Stephenson's first play. A humor
ous and eloquent portrayal of the return of three
sisters to their childhood home on the eve of their
mother's funeral, the play was engaging enough
to secure a run at the Hampstead Theater in
London the year it was written. It recently had its
United States premiere at Chicago's Steppenwolf
Theater.
Kuzminski saw the play while it was getting
rave reviews in England and fell in love with it im
mediately. Directing "The Memory of Water" at
Stanford gives her the chance "to do something
different, something very realistic" within the
constraints of naturalism, and to tell a story that
she deems relevant.
Onstage, the three daughters toss dresses, purses
and hats in the air as they try on their deceased
mother's clothing and make fun of her behavior.
Reckless, self-obsessed Catherine (Sarah Cathgart)
has gotten her sisters high on marijuana, and
bossy, over-organized Teresa (loya Martuscello)
has joined in the fun. Surrounded by the pink walls
of their mother's home, Mary (Ryan Bath£) —
who has immersed herself in her medical career in
an effort to run away from her mother's lifestyle
— points out to her sisters that "mother runs
through us whether we like it or not." Her words
foreshadow the appearance of Vi (Doan Ly), the
mother's ghost, who revisits Mary to reconstruct
their fragmented relationship.
Kuzminski was drawn to the conflict between
work and family exposed by the play. The ques
tions surrounding success and femininity as de
fined by society and women themselves lie at the
core of the piece, and she wanted to explore how
these tensions resulted in the breakdown of the fe
male characters' relationships.
"Vi's explosive view of femininity pushes
Mary away from her mother's pink world with
out the tools to deal with what lays beyond its
walls," said Kuzminski.
Mary, like many others of her generation, is
never properly initiated into today's version of

womanhood. She faces a reality that demands the juggling of work and family to attain happiness after having grown up believ
ing she must choose between the two. This dynamic has ramifications that must ultimately be confronted by the family as a unit.
The themes of "The Memory of Water" are universal because they deal with the way mothers and daughters interact and how
this interaction affects all other relationships. However, the play does not simply blame the mother for the problems in her
daughters' lives. As one actress put it,"For all things mothers do, even when you hate them, they are doing the best they can. They
love you even though their actions might be stemming from their ignorance." Vis ghost reappears to make Mary understand why
Vi did the things she did. In the end, Mary is the one who must be forgiven for abandoning her mother during her final years.
To give life to these issues in a realistic manner, Kuzminski allowed her actors to run through their own personal and "organic"
processes to develop the characters. She then took what she was given, added her own input and worked from there.
One of the challenges of staging "The Memory of Water" as a college production was the casting of younger actors in roles writ
ten by and for older people. The cast, however, is an experienced one. Martuscello, Ly, Cathgart, and Tom Freeland (playing Teresa's
husband, Frank) have appeared in numerous drama productions. Both Bath£ and Sterling Brown (as Mike, Mary's lover) have been
admitted to NYU's Tish School of the Arts' MFA program. They all have shared the stage previously and prmoise to deliver solid per
formances as an ensemble.
A mix between a farcical sitcom and an earnest drama, "The Memory of Water" promises to entertain.
