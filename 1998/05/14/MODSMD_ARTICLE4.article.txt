# Anthropology Dept may split
## 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
The Anthropology Department,
which has long suffered from internal
divisions, has submitted an applica
tion to the Provost's Office to split
into two separate departments.
The new departments would be
named the Anthropological Sciences
Department and the Social and Cul
tural Anthropology Department.
The desired split formalizes a
philosophical and personal rift within
the department that has existed for
several years. Difficulties arose in the
past few years largely because of the
differences between approaches to
anthropological research.
"Within the field of anthropology
nationally, there is a divided opinion

as to what are the important subjects
to be studied," said Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Hans An
dersen.
While social and cultural anthro
pologists tend to emphasize cultural
interaction and social history in ana
lyzing human behavior, scientific an
thropologists focus on biological
forces and the biological history of
humans.
According to Andersen, this dif
ference is not unique to Stanford but
is part of a larger trend in the field of
anthropology. "There seems to be a
similar controversy in aU anthropolo
gy departments," he said.
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Joanna
Mountain agreed.
