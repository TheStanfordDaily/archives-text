# Anthropology Dept may split
## 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
The Anthropology Department,
which has long suffered from internal
divisions, has submitted an applica
tion to the Provost's Office to split
into two separate departments.
The new departments would be
named the Anthropological Sciences
Department and the Social and Cul
tural Anthropology Department.
The desired split formalizes a
philosophical and personal rift within
the department that has existed for
several years. Difficulties arose in the
past few years largely because of the
differences between approaches to
anthropological research.
"Within the field of anthropology
nationally, there is a divided opinion

as to what are the important subjects
to be studied," said Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Hans An
dersen.
While social and cultural anthro
pologists tend to emphasize cultural
interaction and social history in ana
lyzing human behavior, scientific an
thropologists focus on biological
forces and the biological history of
humans.
According to Andersen, this dif
ference is not unique to Stanford but
is part of a larger trend in the field of
anthropology. "There seems to be a
similar controversy in aU anthropolo
gy departments," he said.
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Joanna
Mountain agreed.
"I think it's part of a larger trend,"
she said. "Departmental divisions are
somewhat arbitrary anyway, and an
thropology departments tend to be
even less cohesive. Most departments
are no longer trying to cover all ways
of looking at things."
Students also noticed the disagree
ment between the two philosophies.
"Students have been affected by
this split for a while," said Heather
Laird, a senior majoring in anthropol
ogy. " There's a long history of issues
that haven't been reconciled between
different people studying different
things."

However, the possible split in the
Anthropology Department also has
roots in personal problems that exist
within the department at Stanford.
"There's a history of the two
branches not working together at all,"
Andersen said. "The department was
not functioning well. They had to de
cide to work together well or to spilt.
We left that decision up to the depart
ment itself."
Faculty in the Anthropology De
partment decided a split would be
more effective. If given approval by
the Provost's Office to split the de
partment, Prof. William Durham,
current chair of the Anthropology
Department, will be the chair of the
Anthropological Sciences Depart
ment. and Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako

will chair the Social and Cultural An
thropology Department.
If the split occurs, the two depart
ments will be treated as separate and
will not compete directly for space or
funding, Andersen said. The split, if it
is approved, would require the Uni
versity to create a new department of
fice and to separate the finances and
administration of the two depart
ments. According to Andersen, the
two departments would have differ
ent accounts by Sept. 1. The graduate
aid would also be split up between the
two departments.
According to Andersen, the new
space and staff plans were put for
ward after it became clear to Univer
sity officials that the department
would go forward with the split. The

plans should take two to three years
to implement.
If the split is approved, students
who declare a major in anthropology
after the split occurs will have to de
clare in one of the two separate de
partments and be subject to different
major requirements.
Mountain sees this change as ben
eficial to students. "I think it might
give them more flexibility in design
ing their undergraduate program."
she said.
However, not all students see this
specialization as a benefit. Laird com
mented, "We're already compart
mentalized enough. I think it was a re
ally interesting aspect of my anthro
pological training to be exposed to
subjects I was not studying."
