# SPIKE AND MIKE'S IS BACK
## The 						1998 Classic Festival of Animation plays at Cubberley film festival 
### Matt Bell 
Spike and Mike's Classic Festival of Animation — the mainstream twin of the Sick
and Twisted Animation Festival that was here last fall — is coming to Stanford from
May 14-23.
Over the years, the festival has popularized the work of famous animators such as
Nick Park ("Wallace & Gromit") and Tim Burton ("The Nightmare Before
Christmas"). This year's festival features 13 animated short films from the far reaches
of the animation industry.
Those of you who associate animation with Saturday morning cartoons and Disney
movies will be pleasantly surprised by the wide array of styles presented in the festival.
Nearly every major animation medium is showcased, including simple pen lines, char
coal, watercolor, eel animation, stop motion and computer animation.
Many of the shorts come from foreign countries such as England, Germany, Turkey
and Russia. They range in length from only a couple of seconds to 13 minutes, for a to
tal length of about two hours.
While many of the cartoons are not memorable, there are a few spectacular ones that
make the overall show worthwhile. The more standard cartoons have enough redeem
ing qualities to entertain you until the really incredible ones appear. Since it is very dif
ficult to find these animations anywhere else, I highly recommend going to the Spike
and Mike festival.

t.r.a.n.s.i.t;
This eel animation from
England took four years and
$400,000 to make. It tells the
story of a love affair gone
horribly wrong through a se
ries of vignettes in different
cities. The overall story is wo
ven together through a suit
case that appears in every vi
gnette. The plot is cleverly
told in reverse chronological
order by flashing back to the
cities depicted in the travel
stickers on the suitcase.
The animation style is dis
tinctive and well adapted to
each location. The scenes in
Cairo are portrayed with out
lines of light and dark brown
against a medium brown
background, giving it a strong
feeling of heat and mystery,
while the opening shots on a
luxury ship are portrayed in a
sharp art-deco style.

'Welcome'
This watercolor animation
from Russia is based on the Dr.
Seuss story of a moose who of
fers to let an animal ride on his
antlers and soon finds himself
carrying many of the animal's
friends. The watercolors are
innovatively used for detailed
shading that is not possible
with traditional eels and to
portray the streaming motion
of scenery. The plethora of
characters is lovingly por
trayed and developed.

'Fruhling'
This animated short from Germany is a mod
ern-day "Fantasia," in which the music of spring
time is acted out by a dining set. Chairs prance
around like animals, while a meadow of green
forks sprouts and grows. All the animation was
done through stop motion filming of papier
milch6 models. There is little plot, but the aim of
the movie is to visually create the music's emotion,
which this short does very successfully.

'Stage Fright'
This claymation short is
the latest production from
Aardman Animations, which
made the well-loved "Wallace
& Gromit" shorts. It tells the
story of a dog juggler who
finds himself upstaged and
bullied by a movie star. "Stage
Fright" retains many elements
from "Wallace & Gromit," in
cluding the distinctive anima
tion style and character
voices. However, the tone of
the story is heavier, and the
characters aren't nearly as ex
citing or dynamic. Although
the cartoon is well done, it's a
bit of a disappointment when
compared to the "Wallace &
Gromit" series.

'Geri's Game'
This is another technological rev
olution from Pixar Studios. Pixar is
famous for producing "Toy Story,"
the first feature-length computer
animated film. "Toy Story" showed
that computer animation technol
ogy could do an incredible job at
mimicking most things in the real
world, but was poor at animating
human characters. Human move
ments were often blocky, and their
facial features were awkward and
unrealistic. The animators avoided
these difficulties somewhat by min
imizing the presence of humans in
the movie.
"Geri's Game" is a direct attack on
this problem. Because the film con
sists of an old man, Geri, playing a
game of chess against himself, a
computer-animated human being is
in nearly every shot. His skin is very
fluid and realistic, and his face is ca
pable of displaying the wide range of
convincing emotions that is essential
to the humor. These substantial ad
vances are due to Cloth technology
and other innovations developed at
Pixar. The other computer-animated
cartoon in the festival, "Gilten
Appetit," gets around the problem of
human depiction by splicing in
footage of an actual person.
