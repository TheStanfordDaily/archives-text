## Necessary Rounding: Intermission talks with playwright, actor and stand-up comic Eric Bogosian 
### Arthur Schram 
Intermission: Describe the creative
process behind your work.
Eric Bogosian: A lot of what I do is
not conscious humor — I try to vent
and get out an energy. The audience
tells me what works and what doesn't.
If I'm playing a character, 1 get inside a
guy and I let that guy do the talking.
My drug dealer / biker-guy character,
Red, who compares skiing to sex —
exists because I've known guys like
that. I know the way they're going to
talk and the way they're going to
think. A guy named Red actually came
up to me in a parking lot because I
had a "Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll" jacket
on. He said, "Hey man, you dig sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll? Me too, man.
Can you get me a jacket like that,
man?" He gave me a card that said,
"Red, motor captain, Hell's Angels."
Then he said, "You ride?" His whole
idea of who I was was so completely
off base. I thought it would make a
great routine.
My whole life, I've been the guy
watching other people. I'm fascinated
by people. One of my favorite things
to do is to watch people far down a
subway platform and try to figure out

from their body language what they are saying to each other.
My writing itself comes in different forms. There is the starting
stage, which is me just flailing around and trying things. With the
solos, for example, I may just lock the door, drink a bunch of cof
fee, turn on the tape recorder and bounce around the walls for an
hour to see what comes out. After that stage comes the fixing and
the endless rewrites.
I: How autobiographical is your work?
EB: What we're always doing is playing who we are. I swim around
in the vagueness of my own personality. People are addicted to the
thought that performers are clearly outlined "personalities." I like to
screw with that. If I told you that Marilyn Manson takes all [of his
makeup] off at the end of the day, goes home, smokes a pipe and plays
scrabble with his four kids, it would jar you. People make assump
tions about me. They think I'm a very cool guy. I don't even know
what cool means. Back when I was using drugs, I would do interviews
and tell people that I was doing drugs, as if it would give me brownie
points. I don't know what kind of moron would be into me because
of that. Of course, I was that kind of moron, because I was once into
(drugged-out voice) Lou Reed, man — heroin. What is that about? But
that's exactly what it's about today. So much of what makes an audi
ence attracted to a performer is who they think that performer is.
I: How do the varying strands of your career come together? Do
you see yourself as a writer, an actor, a comedian or a combination of
all of those things?
EB: I like to not be pinned down, but I know that I am a natural
born actor. If I always had the opportunity to act in things that were
challenging and fulfilling, then I would do that all the time. But there

are a limited number of exciting roles to play. I have a strong impulse to make
things, and for me that means writing.
When I do a one-nighter in New York, and it's "my crowd" at the Knitting
Factory, it's ballistic and really exciting. But if 1 do a long run for a solo show,
it can become a drag after a while. Then writing comes to save the day be
cause I can swim off into my writing and make up anything I want.
I: Beyond your New York "crowd," do you cater to a specific audience?
EB: I call it a "tribe." My ilk is probably people who, like myself, have one
foot in pop and one foot in something more serious. I take things seriously,
and 1 think that that's also a characteristic of people in my tribe. I expect the
people who walk into the theater to have strong opinions about things, and I
want them to bounce their opinions in and out of what I say. For me, humor
divides all humanity between people that I'm interested in and people that
I'm not interested in. There are people who don't ever laugh, and I don't care
about those people. Most of them are Republicans, anyway.
I: Do you think that comedy should have a message?
CB: No, I think that if someone can pull off something completely vacuous,
I'll enjoy it. Routines that are about something tend to have more staying
power, but a routine can be about a lot of things. I'm not big on topical hu

mor. What I always want
to zero in on is comedy
based on my own little
foibles, pettiness, hopes
and fears.
