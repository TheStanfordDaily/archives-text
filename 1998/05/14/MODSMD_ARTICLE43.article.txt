## Fresh off the stage The 						Asian American Theater Project produces its first event in three years 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial Staff 
After senior Jeff Li took "Introduction to
Acting" fall quarter, he found his life forever
changed. His teacher, drama doctoral stu
dent Shannon Steen, suggested looking
through a play called "F. 0.8." to find a
monologue appropriate for an Asian-
American actor.
"When I read ("F.0.8."], it struck a chord
in me," Li said. "Then, when 1 read the his
tory of the play — how it was written by a
Stanford student and first performed at
Okada — I knew that I wanted to see it done
here at Stanford."
What began as a quest to find a mono
logue turned into a humongous drama pro
ject involving three departments, four spon
sors and two well-known pillars of the
Asian-American theater community. These
pillars are Stanford alumnus David Hwang
(who wrote the Tony Award-winning
Broadway hit,"M. Butterfly") and renowned
director of the San Francisco Asian
American Theater Company, Lane
Nishikawa. Hwang wrote the Obie Award
winning "F. 0.8." in 1979, during his senior
year at Stanford.
Li's project, to produce and star in the
first Asian American Theater Project (AATP)
production in three years, will culminate to
day, tomorrow and Saturday in a three-day
run of "F. 0.8." Producing the show has
taken a considerable amount of work on Li's
part, but he doesn't see his efforts as finite.
"I didn't know it was going to be this
much work," he said. "Every little thing is
[the producer's] responsibility. The other
day, two electricians and 1 were sitting down
staring at outlets to see if they could take the
lights we are using for the show."
Li wants the AATP to stay, now that its
hiatus has been broken. "This is part of a
larger thing. We've been talking about how
to make AATP more permanent. We've had
financial help from the Drama Department,
and all of the people involved are getting
[academic] units."
Art for art's sake
It's the legitimacy of the actors' perfor
mances in the show that seems to be the
most important concern for the cast mem
bers. Nishikawa explained his involvement
as "a good way to legitimize what students
have been trying to do here for 20 years."
The play is first and foremost about hu
man experience. However, it happens to
have Asian Americans at its center. "F. 0.8." is
not just an artless political statement.
As actor, Joseph Hei put it, "One thing
with Asian-American theater is that there's a
problem with overpoliticization. The goals
of ethnic theater are the same as the goals of
normal theater. A lot of the time, people
from the community will go see an ethnic
piece because it's something they think they
should do for the community, and they go
with the attitude that, 'When I go to see
Asian-American theater, I'm not going to be
critical of it or feel obligated to like it.' I want
to encourage the community to watch the

play as a play."
From the beginning, the artistry of the
show was a priority.
"Joe [Hei] and Risa [Okamoto] both have
a lot of experience," Li said. "There were no
tavorites played in the casting process. Lane
made all of the casting decisions. I tried out
and was lucky to get in."
If legitimacy as a theatrical production is
what AATP is going for, it helps a great deal

to have Nishikawa as director. In the book
"Asian American Drama," editor Brian
Nelson refers to Nishikawa as "one of the
seminal forces in keeping Asian-American
theater alive in an era when any theater at all
struggles to survive." Nishikawa's career in

Asian-American theater spans over 20 years,
several countries and many different roles.
From 1986 until 1994, Nishikawa served
as artistic director for the Asian American
Theater Company (AATC) in San Francisco.
For 18 seasons, he's been involved in AATC
as an actor, writer and director in over 55
different productions.
Nishikawa isn't limited to theater, how
ever. He's been involved with many films, in
cluding Wayne Wang's "Eat A Bowl of Tea"
and Steven Okazaki's "Living on Tokyo
Time." Recently, Nishikawa appeared in

"American Sons," which aired on PBS last
spring. He's also received many awards, in
cluding the Solo Performance Fellowship
from the National Endowment for the Arts
and the Ruby Yoshino Schaar Playwright
Award from the Japanese American Citizens
League.
Nishikawa has been instrumental in
bringing Asian-American theater to numer
ous college campuses. Nishikawa directed

the first Asian-American plays ever to be
performed at both Chabot College in
Hayward and the UC - Santa Barbara.
"It's an interesting story of how I started
working on this play," Nishikawa said. "I had
just done a show for Stanford Lively Arts.

Some students saw the show and read in the
program that I ran AATC, and thought that
[my experience with AATC and AATP]
would make a good marriage."
For this production, Nishikawa had to
work with students inexperienced with
Asian-American theater. "I had done a lot of
training actors before. A lot of the work you
do in small theater companies is the devel
opment of actors. It was a nice chance to do
both for students. 1 enjoy this."
When asked why he chose to work with
Stanford students, Nishikawa revealed his

true motives. "Jeff [Li] made me an offer I
couldn't refuse," he said.
Take that as you will. Nishikawa is actu
ally directing the play out of love for the art.
"Lane has taken a significant pay cut to
direct this play," Li said. "It got down to
choosing between a student director and
Lane, and I chose Lane. I'm glad, too, be
cause every rehearsal has been a complete
learning experience."
"Fresh Off the Boat?"
Many of us have probably never heard the
term "F. 0.8." It means "Fresh Off the Boat"
and refers to the social behavior of a new
Asian immigrant who hasn't yet learned the
sort of social interactions commonly ac
cepted in America.
The play begins as Dale, a second-genera
tion American of Chinese descent, instructs
the audience in F.0.8.-ness: "F-O-B. Fresh
Off the Boat. F. 0.8. What words can you
think of that characterize the F. 0.8.?
Clumsy, ugly, greasy F. 0.8. Loud, stupid,
F. 0.8. Big feet. Homy. Like Lenny in 'Of
Mice and Men.'"
Or, as Hei, a senior, put it, "F. 0.8. is like
— you tuck in your T-shirt and you wear
belts, or you swim in Speedos instead ot
normal swimming trunks, even if you
aren't an athletic swimmer ... I don't think
any of my white or black friends have ever
heard the term [F. 0.8.). lust my Asian
friends ... so, it's not like a white person
calling you 'chink,' it's like another Chinese
person calling you 'chink.'"
The play, which takes place in the back
room of a small Chinese restaurant in
Torrance, Calif. — is a dialogue between
Chinese immigrants at the turn of the cen
tury and during one day in 1980."F.O.B." fo
cuses on the lives of three people of Chinese
descent: Dale (Li), Grace (Okamoto), a first
generation Chinese-American who is Dale's
cousin, and Steve (Hei), a recent Chinese
immigrant and friend of Grace. Each char
acter grapples with some aspect of his or her
identity. The play symbolizes a change in
identity through the addition and subtrac
tion of a Chinese accent, specific body lan
guage and the ability or inability to under
stand what is going on.
In the world of "F. 0.8," no one is quite
what he or she seems. Inspired by writers
Maxine Hong Kingston and Frank Chin,
Hwang was moved to combine both authors'
visions to create his own play.
Chin, who was the first Chinese-
American to be produced off-Broadway pro
fessionally, has a character in a play called
"The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"
named Gwan Gung. Gwan is the god of war
riors and writers. Kingston's novel, "Woman
Warrior," portrayed a mythical figure, Fa Mu
Lan, who goes to war to save her village bear
ing good luck wishes that were carved into
her back by her parents.
Hwang originally wrote "F. 0.8." hoping to
figure out a way to combine both authors'
views of life as an Asian American with his
own. Because his two main sources are so dif
ferent, the only way to effectively combine all
of those resources was to create characters that
basically lived in several dimensions at once.

The characters live in layers, showing the audience
first one version and then another version of selfhood.
Steve isn't just a new immigrant who can barely speak
English. He's an articulate rich boy from China, accus
tomed to having servants and maids rather than serving
hungry customers. But he's more than that — Steve is
an incarnation of Gwan Gung. Grace isn't just a young,
Chinese-American woman; she is the incarnation of Fa
Mu Lan — she is also the object of Steve's desire. Dale
isn't just a hip A.B.C. (American-Born Chinese); he's a
person who's been trying his entire life to fit into
American society. Dale describes his isolation in a
monologue early in the play:
"I have friends now. Lots. They drive Porsche
Carreras; well, one does. He has a house up in the
Hollywood Hill, where I can stand and look down on
the lights of L.A. 1 guess I haven't really been there yet,
but I could easily go, 1 just have to ask — my parents.
They don't know nothing about the world, about watch
ing Benson at the Roxy, about ordering hors d'oeuvres
at Scandia's, downshifting onto the Ventura freeway at
midnight. They're yellow ghosts and they've tried to
cage me up with Chineseness when all the time we were
in America, so I've had to work real hard, real hard to be
myself. Not to be a Chinese, a yellow, a slant, a gook, to
be just a human being like everyone else. I've paid my
dues and that's why 1 am much better now."
Though Dale spends much of the play being annoyed
at Steve, Dale actually fears him. To Dale, F. 0.8. Steve
symbolizes everything that Dale is afraid of becoming.
Ultimately, Dale is the lost one. Although Grace and
Steve are both strangers in a strange land, they have the
opportunity to morph into gods from time to time —
they have access to what Hwang called in a 1994 speech
at M.I.T. a "sort of unconscious treasure trove of mem
ories and cultures." Dale is alienated from a culture that
rightfully belongs to him, because he's grown up in a
culture that doesn't belong to him yet.

A universal play
Good fiction, good plays and good movies aW
have something in common: no matter how out
landish or somber they are, on some level it is possi
ble to relate to the characters involved. While many
Stanford students have no Asian roots, "F. 0.8." has
many themes that resonate with the difficulties of
growing up in other communities. Overall, "F. 0.8" is
about learning to accept yourself as a pure unit of
self, not as some sort of article to be quantified and
measured against a vague ideal. "F. 0.8." isn't an
Asian play, but a human play.
Hwang himself put it very neatly: "I don't know
that that's actually going to help us figure out what
kind of society we're going to have in the future. So,
in the final analysis, authenticity to me is a debate
over the quest to validate the humanity of various
peoples, of all the people in this country. I know a
couple who's — gosh — he's Irish and Jewish and
lapanese and she's Haitian and Filipino and some
thing else," Hwang said.
"I began to wonder if this child grows up and be
comes a writer — let's say it's a woman — what do we
call her? Is she an African-American writer or an
Asian-American writer, European-American or is she
basically a woman's writer or etcetera? And I think
that when the day comes when we can simply call her
an American writer, then we will have gone a long way
to claiming the humanity and the authenticity of all
our experiences as Americans," Hwang said.
