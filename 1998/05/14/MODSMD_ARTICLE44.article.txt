## The 						Tuesdays 
### 
At least they're not the Spice Girls.
There's nothing else good to say about
the latest addition to the growing number
of all-women bands, The Tuesdays.
The five Tuesday women may not be
Spice wannabes, but they certainly copy
cat other mainstream bands. While this
may be like comparing Harold Robbins
to Shakespeare, it's worthwhile to note
that the opening few measures of some of
the group's songs sound suspiciously fa
miliar to songs by the Gin Blossoms and
the Smashing Pumpkins.
"Take Me Home" is reminiscent of
"Eternal Flame." This is a nasty trick, in
deed. Unfortunate listeners, convinced that
they are about to hear an infinitely more
talented band, are disappointed by what
they actually hear — alt-rock gone bad.
Not only are The Tuesdays' instrumen
tal conveniently snatched from already
popular music, but the lead vocalist, Laila
Samuels, screeches over the music in a
whiny, little-girl voice reminiscent of
Wilson Phillips. Perhaps that's the main

problem with The Tuesdays — the group
is always reminding me of someone else.
1 have no idea who they actually are.
A piece of advice for these women: If
you can't make it as musicians, try com
edy. One of the motifs of the song "I Was
Thinking of You" goes something like
this: "I can understand you're jealous /
But he didn't touch my heart / No - he
wasn't even better / Not even in the good
parts." It's safe to say that these ladies
would clean up at the Comedy Club, so
long as they stayed away from the femi
nists. The Tuesday women can't seem to
sing about anything else other than the
men who left them and their resulting
misery: "So if you ever change your mind
/ Please just let me know / Where to go."
Try a support group.
The Tuesdays' only redeeming quality is
that the group is a good imitator. The band
might sound okay to a person who's lived in
a musical vacuum for their entire existence.
