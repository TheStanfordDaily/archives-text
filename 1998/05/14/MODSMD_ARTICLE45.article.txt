# Kristin Hersh:
## 'Strange Angels' 
### 
A guitar and a voice. Nothing new,
but Kristin Hersh manages to
make simple things sound differ
ent. "Strange Angels," her second solo
album, retains all of her eponymously
titled album's good qualities without,
sadly, adding any new ones.
Hersh's voice haunts, her strumming is
caustic and her lyrics intrigue. She laces
her songs with surprises. Extra instru
ments appear out of nowhere, disturbing
the simple arithmetic of guitar plus voice.
Taking her cue from her former band,

The Throwing Muses, she swings moods violently, start
ing sweetly, building violently, ending suddenly.
Her strumming patterns, although atypical, have
changed little since her last album, where they were al
ready beginning to sound trapped with little hope for
development. The magic tricks in her melodies still delight,
but they're in danger of becoming stale.

This album also sees Hersh making her voice more emotive
than she has previously. This is a pity. Her lyrics, bizarre and puzzling,
have always benefited from being sung in a distant wisp. Listening to
someone sing, "Poor sucker freaked, couldn't swim with the monkeys"

as if all the world depended on it, is faintly ridiculous.
"Strange Angels" is a good album, but it is hardly a step forward foi

Hersh. One could easily swap this album with its predecessor. If you
don't own any Kristin Hersh, get this album. But if you've already t

got the first album, don't bother to buy it a second time.
