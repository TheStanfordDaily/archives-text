# Lou Reed:
## 'Perfect Night Live in London' 
### 
The last Lou Reed album to re
ceive any critical acclaim was
"Magic and Loss" from 1992. If
his latest, "Perfect Night Live in
London," really does represent a "per
fect night" for Reed, then perhaps a
better title would be "Magic Lost."
However, that wouldn't make any
money off of the people who know
him from "Perfect Day" on the
"Trainspotting" movie soundtrack.
All of this is very sad, because Lou
Reed is one of the great figures in rock
V roll history. His seminal under
ground rock band The Velvet
Underground revolutionized rock music
and practically created punk, alternative,
gothic and countless other genres in the
course of a four-year career.
However, unlike his musical peers
Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Patti Smith,
Reed has not aged gracefully. He grunts
and grumbles through the show, and the
lyrics that come through aren't worth
the effort. For instance, "Kicks" sounds
so much like a Lou Reed parody that it's
hard not to laugh, while "Sex With Your
Parents" is just an obsolete anti-
Republican rant.
There are some good songs, though,

that almost make the album worthwhile.
"I'll Be Your Mirror" is a charmingly
gruff revision of the Velvet Underground
original, while "Riptide" and "Coney
Island Baby" have some of the wide-eyed
exhilaration that marks Reed's best work.
One of the strangest things about the
album is that Reed, who recorded some
of the rawest guitar ever on "White Light
White Heat," has become an audiophile.
The liner notes consist mainly of a lov
ing tribute to the "Feedbucker," a device
that eliminates all of the feedback from
an amped guitar. I only wish that Reed
had put as much passion into his perfor
mance as he did into the production.
