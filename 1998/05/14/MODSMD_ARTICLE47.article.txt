# Tamia

### 
If you're like me, you jammed to
Tamia's hit "You Put A Move On
My Heart" when it came out. It was
a real song, with romantic lyrics, wist
ful music, strong vocals and none of
that breathy-whispery stuff that was
being passed off as R&B singing.
Then you got restless waiting for
Quincy Jones' newest prot£g£ to re
lease a full album that would showcase
her immense talent.
You waited a long time. Two years.
Just when you thought it was safe to
forget all about her and write her off
like Jones' other prot£g£, Tevin
Campbell — Tamia, like Campbell,
resurfaces and comes back.
Two years is a long time to wait, but
her self-titled album from Qwest /
Warner records is well worth it. It's ac
tually quite good.
There's a big difference between
Tamia and the numerous other young
female singers out there now. Tamia
can actually sing.
Sure, her voice sounds youthful like
Brandy's and breathy like Aaliyah's on
her fast-paced jeep-bumping hits
"Imagination," "Falling For You" and
"Is That You?" But she can sing a soul
ful ballad when she chooses to.
Her voice is deep, rich and thought
ful on "This Time It's Love," "Loving
You Still" and the re-released bonus
track "You Put A Move On My Heart."
Definitely an album worth getting.
