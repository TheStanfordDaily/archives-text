# Agents of Good Roots:
## 'One By One' 
### 
"One By One" attempts to
blend pop, rock, soul and blues
with an urban alt-rock sensibility.
While most of the pop and soul
falls flat, the blues and rock suc
cessfully carry the album.
Part of the problem is the
production. It's just too slick.
The good songs on this album
are the "dirty" ones. The others
have potential but get coated in
the Oleo vat of radio-friendly
major label production.
"One By One" starts strong.
"Come On," a driving, distorted
guitar-rock track, is quickly fol
lowed by "Two Bucks In Cash," a
sexy, bluesy groove with great
saxophone riffs that acknowl
edge Morphine's influence on
Agents of Good Roots.
"Miss America" crosses Tom
Petty-smart verses and heavy Black
Crows choruses. It also has the first
real guitar solo on the album, a
soaring acid-laced piece of work.
"Upspin," an R&B soul piece,
gets sunk by too many Motown
cliches (like humming female
backup singers), but the album re
covers quickly. "Miss Misbelieving"
is a subtly midtempo country
blues song with languid slide guitar
work, and "Shortchange" uses a
deep alt-rock groove as a way to
present the band's forte: jamming.
"Hoping, Waiting, Longing" is
a surprisingly good rock pop bal
lad with Pink Floydian keys and
acoustic guitar. It leads well into
"Hobby," a great bass / saxo
phone swing with a fantastic gui
tar and sax freakout-jazz jam.
Stewart Myers' deep bass ex
plodes with thunder (hello, Les
Claypool) and the Agents of
Good Roots finally moves.
"Where'd You Get That Vibe?"
shifts from fast alt-rock into bril
liant, mellow jazz. It's so good, I
don't understand why there isn't a
whole album of the Agents' jazz.
Unfortunately, "One By One"
continues with "I'll Be Back," a
bland pop number that should
have been left off.
Agents of Good Roots have a
faithful East Coast following that
is well deserved. They'll be at the
Great American Music Hall in San
Francisco on June 13, and if this
album is any indication, it's a
show worth checking out — as
long as they stay away from pop
and stick to the rock.
