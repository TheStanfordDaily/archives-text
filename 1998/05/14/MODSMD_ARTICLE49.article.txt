# Project Pitchfork:
## 'Alpha Omega' 
### 
Imagine you wanted to hear some hard
core, aggressive, adrenaline pumping
music. You might turn to Ministry, Nine

Inch Nails or Prong, but you hear that a new
band, Project Pitchfork, has that same type
of sound.
Feeling adventurous, you pick up this
new band's CD. Imagine putting this pris
tine disc into your home stereo and turning
it on, ready to get that blood rushing
through your veins. Now imagine that you
hear the following lyrics: "You have the
power to change the world / Every little
thing you do causes huge effects / The whole
world depends on your actions / You're re
sponsible, understand that."
What???
A preaching lecture is the last thing in the

world an industrial music fan wants to hear,
yet that is ail you will find in Project
Pitchfork. It brings the typical hard-core in
dustrial beats and rhythms that are common
in this style of music, along with vocal dis
tortions that make the vocalist sound like
Max Headroom.
With preaching lyrics that try to create
substantial world impact within each indi
vidual song, the end result is just ridicu
lously cheesy. Imagine what "We Are The
World" would sound like if you ran it
through a garbage disposal...
