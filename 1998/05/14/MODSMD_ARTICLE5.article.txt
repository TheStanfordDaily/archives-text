### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
There will soon be 35 new faces
looking out from behind the glass
display cases in the lobby of Old
Union. This year's winners of the
James W. Lyons Awards for Service
were announced yesterday.
An award ceremony today will
bring this year's recipients together
to receive their certificates and
medallions. The award, which was
named in honor of a former dean of
student affairs and current teacher in
the School of Education, honors a
wide range of contributions to the
Stanford community.
Senior Blake Harris, one of the
recipients, was astonished by the
award.
"I appreciate it enormously, hut I
feel like 1 didn't need an award for
doing things I enjoy." he said.
Harris has been at Stanford for a
total of six years. "1 feel like they

gave me an award for loving Stan
ford and giving back to my school,'
he said.
According to Wais. Harris re
ceived the award for "translating his
love of Stanford into action which ul
timately benefits us all," particularly
in his work in connection with Orien
tation and the Alumni Association.
Another recipient of the award
was junior lan Chun. Chun was sur
prised as well when he was notified,
since he has only been "fulfilling his
dream for the past three years."
Chun started a class and an Alter
native Spring Break program on
Hawaiian culture, history and tradi
tions. He raised funds and brought in
guest lecturers and renowned speak
ers from his home state. Chun taught
the 4<>-person class as well.
"We basically did a lot of commu
nity service on and off campus and
had fun dome it." Chun said.
"It's important that the 14 people
we took back to Hawaii for an out
reach program learned a lot more
about Hawaii than the average
tourist would have."
This is the eighth year that under
graduates and graduate students
have been recognized for their con
tributions through a variety of pro
jects serving Stanford both on and
off campus.
Faculty, staff and students made
nominations throughout winter
quarter. Out of these. Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais and committee of
representatives from the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and the Office
of Residential Education. choSe the

emotional event" that Wais looks

forward to each year, he said. Nomi
