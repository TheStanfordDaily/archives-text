# Gaze:
## 'Mitsumeru' 
### 
Can everyone say "girl
band?" "Mitsumeru" is
the debut full-length al
bum from this Vancouver trio,
best described as some of the
poppiest girl pop I have heard
in a long while.
"Mitsumeru" is slow pop that
consists mainly of rudimentary
drumbeats, cymbals and repeti
tive guitar riffs fronted by an
noyingly sweet prepubescent

sounding vocals. Most of the
songs on this album sound too
similar to be differentiated.
"Any Way" and"Portrait" are
two tracks representative of the
rest of the album. But they are
different from the other tracks
because they are more interest
ing. "Any Way" has a fast tempo
and vocals which are not as
grating, while "Portrait" is a
slow ballad song.

Gaze, for girl pop, is cu'ie
good. But if you expect to w ir
something different from t a ,
you will be very disappointed.
"Mitsumeru" is not a bad
first attempt. However, if Gaze
does not vary its sound more
on the next album, 1 doubt that
we'll see a third.
