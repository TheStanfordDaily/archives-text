## Scoot over, Hale-Bopp This movie makes an 'Impact' 
### 
Deep Impact is a film from the pro
ducers of "Independence Day." While
the subject of an invasion from outer
space is preserved, this time the Earth's fu
ture is threatened by a comet the size of
Mount Everest.
Everything starts when a high school as
tronomer, Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) no
tices a star that seems to be out of place. As it
turns out, he has discovered a comet that will
cross paths with the earth in less than 2 years.
While the government covers up this ex
tinction-level event (E.L.E.), scientists start
working on a system to blow the comet out
of Earth's path. Jenny Lerner (T£a Leoni), an
up-and-coming reporter at MSNBC, finds
out about the comet by chance, causing a
media uproar.
When President Beck (Morgan Freeman)
tells the world the bad news, people's lives

change drastically with the knowledge that
the human race may be extinct in two years.
The first 90 minutes of the film focus mostly
on what people do when faced with the fact
that they may soon die. Some of this is inter
esting, but mostly is just too melodramatic.
While the story is predictable from start to
finish, the magnitude of the approaching dis
aster makes it well worth the wait. The special
effects may at times be trying to do too much,
resulting in fake-looking shots. On the other
hand, I've never seen what it really looks like
when New York City gets hit by a 3,000-foot
tidal wave, so maybe I shouldn't judge.
While Freeman's performance is solid and
Wood does as much as he can with his shal
low character, Leoni is the surprise of the
day. She has the benefit of playing the most
interesting character and is very believable.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said

for the crew on board the spaceship trying
to save the planet. I would be worried if
these were really the people charged with
saving the Earth in an emergency. Good

thing for the people on Earth
that Spurgeon Tanner (Robert
Duvall) takes command of the
ship just hours before the
comet's impact.
All in all, "Deep Impact" is a
very entertaining film, but it con
tains absolutely no material that
makes it original. The same type
of story was recently made into a
television special. In July, another
film about a comet will come
crashing onto movie screens.
However, Leoni, Duvall and
Freeman are able to carry the
weight of this movie on their
shoulders, and they make it into
something fun to watch.
