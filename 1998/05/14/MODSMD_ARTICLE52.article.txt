# The 						urban comedy myth
## Jada Pinkett Smith can't 'Woo' Audiences 
### 
A poor attempt at com
edy, "Woo" seduces the
viewer with the lus
cious Jada Pinkett Smith
("Scream 2") in the title role.
But the film falls short in
most other aspects.
For those who frequent ur
ban comedies, this movie may
be exactly what you're look
ing for. However, the world of
temptress women and misog
ynistic, testosterone-laced
men is not what I would call
entertainment.
It was not as if I sat there

stone-faced the whole time. There were some good laughs, set up expertly by
director Daisy V.S. Mayer ("Party Girl") and executive co-producer John Singleton
("Boyz N the Hood"). There is a sequence involving burning toilet paper which is
handled with a deft, comic and almost cartoonish touch.
Pinkett Smith's character, nicknamed Woo, is aloof and cruel to the men around
her for no apparent reason. She has guys crawling all over her, but she is unwilling
to give any of them a chance. Part of the explanation may be the inherent sex-dri
ven nature of many of her past relationships; she now craves something more sub
stantial. As a result she is selfish, self-centered and exceedingly manipulative.
Enter Tim (Tommy Davidson, "Booty Call"), the straight-man with few nu
ances. Tim is the lawyer-to-be who gets little action outside of step-aerobics
videos. For a while, we wonder whether he is gay, and we really don't know since
the subject is never directly addressed. There is only a lot of trash-talking from his
three macho friends.
Tim is set up with Woo on a blind date, and initially the two of them don't
hit it off. Woo is hopeful that he will be Mr. Right, since her crossdressing for
tune teller predicted that she would soon be enamored with a man. But their
personalities are completely dissimilar, as his idea of an evening out on the town
is different from Woo's.
We get treated to a sequence of events around Brooklyn, from a stop at the po
lice station to a sketchy dance club. There is little to discuss in terms of plot — the
entire film begins in the afternoon and finishes late that night.
LL Cool J has a brief appearance as a romantic womanizer. He was a pleasant
surprise, although his persona further emphasized the self-deprecating attitude of
the movie toward its characters. "Woo" is, thankfully, a short film, but the few
laughs thrown into the mix are not nearly enough of a reason to watch Pinkett
Smith strut around in skimpy outfits for 85 minutes.
