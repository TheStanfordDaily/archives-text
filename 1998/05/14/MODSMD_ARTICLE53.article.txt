# All, Hong Kong!
## 'Chinese Box' explores life and love in the big city 
### 
When you go see "Chinese Box," don't expect to see a traditional Hollywood
movie. The fact that director Wayne Wang's film is so different from what
we're used to makes it an interesting visual experience.
The story is about John (Jeremy Irons), a British journalist who's been in Hong
Kong for over 15 years. The year is 1997, and with the imminent handover of Hong
Kong to the Chinese, he has grown tired of reporting about politics and finance in
a place that seems to have no future. He wants to learn more about the city, its cus
toms and what makes the people of Hong Kong tick.
Intertwined with the city's story is the love story between John and Vivian
(Gong Li). Vivian, an immigrant from northern! China and consequently a
member of the lower class, has refused John's marriage proposal. John cannot
figure out why.
The parallel plots in this film are integrated seamlessly, a factor that makes
"Chinese Box" all the more engaging. Rather than limiting itself to one type of au
dience, it manages to be a documentary and a love story simultaneously.
John learns many things by opening his eyes to the real Hong Kong. He wit
nesses the rampant animal abuse and widespread infidelity among married cou
ples. Most shockingly, he learns that many respected women are really prostitutes.
To make his life more miserable, John finds out that he has a serious health
problem that may kill him. His life starts to tail apart, until he meets Jean (Maggie
Cheung), a woman whose life — and face — has been scarred by Hong Kong's so
cial prejudices. He sets out to document this woman's life in an attempt to better
understand the city.
This film is not for the faint of heart — images of animal abuse, suicides and
the sex industry are present throughout. Everything in this film is pretty depress
ing, but that is a refreshing change from all the feel-good movies that Hollywood

is churning out.
The cast is entirely Chinese
with the obvious exception of
Irons and his roommate Jim
(Ruben Blades). The combina
tion of English and Cantonese
(with subtitles) added to the
authenticity of the film.
The picture is filmed with
out tripods in an attempt to
make it look more like a docu
mentary. A lot of the scenes
rely on the help of Hong Kong
locals to show the camera what
the city is really like.
