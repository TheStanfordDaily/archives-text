# Waves come crashing
## Zalman King ditches sex for surf 
### 
Director / writer Zalman King is best known for erotic fare like "Wild Orchid" and "9
1/2 Weeks." In his latest film, an almost sexless tale of three surfers, he shows that he
can't do much else.
The first hour of "In God's Hands" features mesmerizing visual images coupled with a
thumping soundtrack. Unfortunately, this combination only evokes moods — it fails to es
tablish a coherent plot.
In pursuit of authenticity, world-class surfers were recruited to star in this film. While the act
ing of the three leads — Patrick Shane Dorian, Matt George and Matty Liu — is not atrocious,
these men are not experienced enough as actors to compensate for a story with little direction.
Character archetypes are developed in the young and innocent surfer Keoni (Liu), the past
his-prime-but-an-excellent-mentor surfer Mickey (George) and the aloof and profound surfer
Shane (Dorian). However, efforts to establish dynamic characters with complex motivations fail.
It is obvious that "In God's Hands" endured a lot of chopping in the editing room. Several
scenes of an adult nature were dumped in an effort to snatch a PG-13 rating (after all, kids like
surfing, right?), but key scenes featuring plot and character development were also sacrificed to
keep the film at its tidy running time of 92 minutes — perfect for a prepubescent's attention span.
But Zalman King never intended to produce a kiddie movie, so instead we have a stripped
down mature audience film devoid of those elements for which King is most famous. While we
remain blessed with his unrivaled ability to capture an original visual image, the once elaborate
plot is left scattered, and the potential eroticism of the movie is erased.
Ah, but let us shift to a discussion of what the movie does have. Both surfing lovers and
nature lovers will be blown away by the film's dazzling surfing footage.
The goal of the surfers in the movie is to surf a wave so big that it cannot be paddled into;
instead, jet skis must be used. As a result, the surfing footage is not only well-filmed, but as-

tounding in the sheer magnitude of
the waves being attempted — mas
sive 40-foot waves that leave the
surfer "In God's Hands," so to speak.
Once the surfing really gets
started, the movie, regardless of
other factors, is a joy to watch.
Forget about the plot or lack
thereof. Just lay back, relax and en
joy the spectacle of excellent surfers
riding monstrous waves.
