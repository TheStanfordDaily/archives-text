# You call this a pot flick?
## 'Homegrown' is a crop full of weed 
### 
The gaping maw of
Hollywood has success
fully spewed forth an
other piece of cinematic crap
with "Homegrown."
Billed as a marijuana comedy,
"Homegrown" is more of an ac
tion-adventure flick. It depicts
the Northern California pot
growing community as a scaled
down version of the Colombian
cocaine fields, replete with plot
jumpers, crooked cops and a
small arsenal of conventional
weapons in everybody's pockets.
Jack (Billy Bob Thorton),
Carter (Hank Azaria) and
Harlan (Ryan Phillippe) work a

$4 million crop of plants up in Marin County. When their boss Malcolm (John
Lithgow) gets offed and they try to sell the crop, everyone from the Feds to the San
Francisco Mafia (with an excellent cameo by Ted Danson as mob boss Giannii) puts
in his two cents on who rightfully owns the plants.
If the boring and far-fetched plot isn't enough to make you steer clear, then the
misogyny, racism and ridiculous portrayal of marijuana as a paranoia- and psy
chosis-inducing drug should be. Sex-interest Lucy (Kelly Lynch) is just a pretty body.
The "community" of growers (including Jon Bon Jovi and Jamie Lee Curtis) hates
Italians worse than it hates the cops. And Thorton, Azaria, Phillippe and Lynch are so
wacked out on demon-weed that by the end of the flick they pull their guns on each
other during every scene.
Even a stellar cast with sometimes thoughtful character development isn t enough
to salvage this wreck. The rare bright spots include Thorton, who does an excellent job
of turning into his former boss Lithgow, and Phillippe, who portrays a 20-year-old kjd
in way over his head.
Don't get burnt by "Homegrown." Wait for the video.
