Hello, 27-word fiction loyalists!
We have some more roommate prose. Cool. Keep it coming. We have had a
lot of roommate trashing, but how about some present and former significant
other trashing? Let's hear all about that pesky bad breath, that annoying whiny
voice, and the other secret hates we can't think of right now.
If you lovedhim or her to death, see if you can compress those joyful expe
riences into 27 words, too. Do you know why? Because of the woncderful things
he does! da dum, da dum, da dum! (That was an Oz reference,)

We made a couple of mistakes last week, as usual: apologies to Joe Euclid for
representing him incorrectly in last week's issue. Also, last week's "best prose"
was written by Zia Khan, not Zia Kahn. Keep in mind that this is still officially
National 27-word Fiction Month. That means you have to write at least one
work of 27-word fiction a day.
By the way, Nkomo's birthday is on Saturday. Happy writing and reading!
