# Muted applause for Nike
## 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
University response has been favorable to new labor
initiatives announced by Nike CEO Phil Knight on Tues
day. The initiatives aim to improve working conditions in
the c* mipany's foreign factories.
Criticism of the company's treatment of workers ir
underdeveloped countries such as Vietnam and Indone
sia has led some to question the Athletics Department's
involvement with Nike. The company's trademark
"swoosh" logo is prominent on the majority of Stanford
athletic uniforms.
"We're very pleased Phil Knight made these an
nouncements," said Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"Our hope." he added, "is that other corporations will
follow Nike's lead on these is-

sues and that Nike, in fact,
will take further steps to A

improve conditions for
its workers."
The company an- j
nouncedthat allofits I
foreign factories 1
would meet U.S.
standards for indoor

air quality by the end of the
year. In addition, the minimum age of workers in
fwtwear factories, where workers sometimes deal with
heavy machinery and hazardous chemicals, will be raised
from 16to IS.
Knight, who recieved an MBA from Stanford in 1%2.
also announced that non-governmental organizations
would be allowed to interview workers and examine
working conditions firsthand.
"We believe that those are processes which the.con

scientious. good companies will follow in the 21st centu
ry." Knight said, addressing the National Press Club.
"This is good news." said Assoc. Drama and Classics
Prof. Rush Rehm. head of a group of students, faculty and
staff protesting University inv olv ement with Nike. "But it
doesn't say anything about paying people a living wage or
their rights to organize."
Nike Director of Labor Practices Dusty Kidd said that
the changes were "bv no means the last word." adding
that they did serve to indicate the direction in which the
company was headed.
Rehm called Nike's initiative to expand monitoring of
its factories the most significant of the announcements.
"Everybody that has worked on the issue will agree."
he said, explaining that independent monitoring would
reveal to the public the true working conditions in the
Asian factories.

W Rehm dismissed
other announcements

made by Nike regarding loan
and educational programs for workers.
"In my opinion, that's doubletalk," he

~ said, adding that an increase in pay would mean
more to workers. He said he hoped Stanford would use
the announcement as an opportunity to encourage Nike
to continue revising its labor practices.
"We're still reviewing our relationship with Nike." Le
land said.
Damn Jackson, assistant athletic director, called the
issue a tough one, noting the Athletics Department's rep
utation as a leader in areas such as gender equity.
"Basically, what we have to do is figure out if being as
sociated with Nike tits [our program]." he said. Similar
concerns have been raised at other universities. Duke

University adopted a code of con
duct in March requiring manufactur
ers of Duke apparel to comply with
health and safety standards for their
workers. Leland said the University
was not currently considering adopt
ing similar regulations and noted
that Nike already has a similar code.
"Our tendency is going to be to
work with Nike and make them en
force their own code," he said.
Nike will also fund four programs
dealing with responsible business
practices in the upcoming academic
year.
