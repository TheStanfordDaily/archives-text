## Microsoft avoids suit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In down-to
the-wire negotiations, Microsoft made
"major concessions" to the government yes
terday and averted — at least temporarily
— a sweeping antitrust case.
The Justice Department anil at least 20
states agreed not to file lawsuits as planned
against the world's most powerful software
maker. Microsoft, in turn, agreed to delay
shipping the latest upgrade of its popular
Windows software to computer makers until
Monday.
Both sides said discussions will continue
over the next several days, although there
were no indications that a resolution was
imminent.
Government lawyers contend Microsoft,
whose Windows software is used on virtual
ly all desktop computers, has used its mar
ket domination to illegally crimp competi
tion in booming high-tech markets.
They want Microsoft to relax many of its
sales agreements with computer makers,
giving them more freedom to install com
petitors' products over Microsoft's and to
customize the versions of Windows they
sell.
One source familiar with the negotiations
said Microsoft made new "significant
offers" to respond to government antitrust
concerns, including modifying the compa
ny's agreements with Internet companies
and computer makers. A source with one of

the state attorneys general spoke of "major
concessions."
Critics were skeptical, citing Microsoft's
IW4 agreement with the Justice Depart
ment that ended an earlier round of govern
ment antitrust concerns.
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said.
"We think a lawsuit would he bad for con
sumers, bad for the industry, bad for
Microsoft and bad for taxpayers."
The investigation is one of the biggest
antitrust efforts since the 19K4 breakup of
AT&T. Microsoft is the world's most suc
cessful and influential software company.
The cases, if they were eventually filed,
could profoundly affect the Redmond.
Wash.-based company's legal freedom to
add new features to Windows, such as the
ability of computers to understand speech.
Microsoft said the brief delay in shipping
Windows 98 to computer makers would
have no impact on its plans to sell the soft
ware to consumers starting June 25.
"The company has taken this step so that
discussions with the government ... can
continue," spokesman Mark Murray said.
The government argues, among other
things, that Microsoft's decision to bundle
its own Internet browser with Windows
amounts to illegal "tying" under the federal
Sherman Act, and hurts consumers and
competitors, such as rival Netscape Com
munications Corp.
