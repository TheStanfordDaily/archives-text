## Officials say India's actions leave them with no choice 
### 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)
Scoffing at the international sanctions
imposed on India for setting off five
underground nuclear blasts, Pakistani
officials said yesterday that their neigh
bor had left them little choice hut to go
ahead with their own nuclear test.
"What India has done is short of a
declaration of war — the provocation
has been that extreme," Foreign Minis
ter Gohar Ayub told The Associated
Press.
American officials rushed to Islam
abad. hoping that even belated diploma
cy could contain a nuclear arms race that
threatened to sweep up India. Pakistan
and possibly China.
In an evening session in Parliament.
Pakistani senators demanded the gov
ernment carry out a nuclear test, but
warned that the country should be pre
pared lor international sanctions.
"We would be in great difficulty"
without a nuclear test. Ayub said in the
interview. "Our policy has been for a
balance of power with India."
Earlier, Pakistan's Cabinet declared
that the safety of South Asia was jeopar
dized by the tests India set off Monday
and Wednesday in the desert bordering
Pakistan.
"Not only Pakistan's, but also the
security of other countries in this region.

has been threatened." said Tariq Altaf. a
foreign ministry spokesman,
"Some sanctions have been
announced which are pretty irrelevant."
he added.
Ayub is to talk today with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Tal
bott and Gen. Anthony Zinni, comman
der of the U.S. Central Command, who
were flying to Pakistan to reinforce
Washington's call for restraint.
"They'll talk to us. and we will listen,"
Ayub said, adding that he has no prior
knowledge of what offers, if any. the
U.S. envoys are bringing.
Pakistan has been living with U.S.
sanctions since 1990 when the United
States cut off $650 million worth of aid
because it believed Pakistan had a nucle
ar bomb. "We've gotten used to sanc
tions." Ayub said.
Both India and Pakistan are betting
that neither the World Bank nor the
International Monetary Fund will pull
out of the region and risk the economic
collapse of an area with 1.2 billion peo
ple.
At a nuclear-control conference in
Geneva, India stood alone yesterday as
friend and foe alike gave an unprece
dented outpouring of criticism.
From Mongolia to Bangladesh. 43
governments at the Conference on Dis

armament deplored India's decision to
flout the global test-han treaty negotiat
ed in the same forum only two years ago.
South African representative Jacob
Selebi said the tests raised "the specter
of a nuclear holocaust."
Also yesterday, the U.N. Security
Council deplored India's nuclear test
explosions and urged "maximum
restraint" and dialogue to ease tensions
between India and Pakistan.
In a joint declaration, the 15-member
council called on India. Pakistan and
others to sign unconditionally the
international treaties banning test explo
sions and nuclear proliferation.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry, mean
while. accused India of painting China as
the region's biggest threat as an excuse
to develop nuclear weapons. "This is
utterly groundless," it said yesterday in
Beijing.
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged
governments worldwide to pressure New
Delhi into abandoning its nuclear
weapons. His remarks were the first indi
cation Beijing might be prepared to take
action against its longtime regional rival.
But spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused
to comment when asked whether China
would impose sanctions, as the United
States. Japan. Germany and other gov
ernments have done.
