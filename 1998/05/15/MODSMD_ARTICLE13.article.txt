JAKARTA. Indonesia (AP)
Rioters tore through the smoke
filled Indonesian capital yesterday,
burning and looting in the worst
violence in decades and the biggest
challenge yet to President Suhar
to's rule.
With 20 reported killed, the mil
itary ordered its troops to take over
the streets.
Suharto, Asia's longest-serving
leader, cut short a trip to Cairo to
return home early today to deal
with the third straight day of arson,
looting and gunfire.
Tanks rolled through the streets
and plumes of thick smoke bil
lowed across the skyline of Jakarta.
Mobs set afire cars, tires, shops and
houses. Rock-throwing teens and
children smashed hundreds of win
dows in a frenzy of destruction that
sent foreigners and minorities flee
ing.
The violence erupted when
police shot to death six student
marchers Tuesday, after tolerating
three months of intensifying
protests over an economic crisis
that has sent prices and unemploy
ment soaring.
Unconfirmed reports said as
many as 20 people were dead or
missing and feared dead yesterday.
The military said four soldiers were
also killed.
"We must face rioters and loot
ers firmly," Maj. Gen. Syafrie
Syamsudin, the city's military com
mander. said in an evening speech
to troops that was broadcast on
local television.
"We are soldiers who will sup
port the nation and we will never
surrender," he said.
Witnesses said security forces
resorted to firing directly into
crowds to try to clear the streets.
Frightened residents com

plained the military failed to stop
mobs rampaging through many
parts of the city.
In some places, the crowds
cheered the troops and clambered
aboard their vehicles as soldiers
stood by, sometimes chatting with
protesters.
The rioting paralyzed the capital
of 11 million people, and raised
doubts about the political future of

the world's fourth most-populous
nation.
Armored personnel carriers
were positioned around the city,
including three outside the U.S.
Embassy, which urged Americans
to defer nonessential travel to
Indonesia and decided to evacuate
relatives of embassy staff.
Some U.S.. Japanese and other
foreign companies temporarily

closed offices and ordered employ
ees home.
The unrest exploded last week
after Suharto introduced new aus
terity measures under a $43 billion
rescue plan imposed by the
International Monetary Fund.
Looters acted largely out of
anger over rising food prices and
reduced subsidies on fuel, transport
and electricity.
