QARARA. Gaza Strip (AP)
In a blunt display of his power to
send hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians into the streets, Yasser
Arafat declared a national day of
mourning yesterday that turned
into a day of rage.
At least five Palestinians were
killed and nearly 2(K) injured in
clashes with Israeli troops that
erupted as Palestinians commemo
rated what they call "al nakba"
the catastrophe — of Israel's found
ing and their own uprooting a half
century ago. It was the worst Israeli-
Palestinian fighting in 20 months.
Pitched battles between Pales
tinian stone throwers and Israeli
troops raged from the town of Jen in
in the northern West Bank to the
southernmost Gaza Strip town of
Rafah. Twenty Israeli soldiers and

two Israeli civilians also were hurt,
according to the army.
"What difference did these 50
years make?" one young protester
said angrily, snatching up a jagged
rock.
In every major city of the West
Hank and Gaza, marchers — chil
dren holding hands, old men in
robes and headdresses and veiled
women — turned out at Arafat's
behest for the anniversary, which
Israel marked April 30 under the
Hebrew calendar.
While most of the marchers — 1
million by official Palestinian esti
mates — were peaceful, thousands
of young men broke away and
headed toward Israeli army out
posts. In clash after clash, they
hurled stones at Israeli soldiers who
responded with tear gas. rubber bul

lets and, sometimes, live rounds.
The massive protests sent a mes
sage of growing Palestinian impa
tience over deadlocked peace
efforts, and the outbreaks of vio
lence signaled that a failure now
could prove explosive.
Israel TV reported from Wash
ington that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, in response to
a request from \isiting Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
called Arafat later yesterday and
asked that he work to calm the situ
ation.
Ominously, the tension sparked
ugly confrontations between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian trin>ps who
were supposed to be working
together to keep order.
Brig. Gen. Yoav Galant. the
Israeli commander in Gaza, accused

Arafat's government of deliberately
organizing demonstrations so large
as to be uncontrollable.
Palestinian officials, in turn,
denounced Israel for dealing so
harshh with demonstrators armed
only with stones and bottles.
The casualty toll remained in
confusion even after the fighting
abated. Em ad Tarawiva. head of
the Palestinian Health Ministry, ini
tially said six Palestinians had been
killed and the Palestinian police
commander in Gaza put the num
ber at eight.
Scores of other Palestinians were
hurt by rubber bullets and live
rounds.
In a speech broadcast on Pales
tinian television, Arafat promised
that a Palestinian state would
become a reality.
