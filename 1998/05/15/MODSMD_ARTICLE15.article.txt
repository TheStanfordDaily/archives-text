Frank Sinatra dies at 82
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Frank Sinatra, the dashing teen idol who
matured into the premier romantic balladeer of American popular
music and the "Chairman of the Board" to his millions of fans, died last
night of a heart attack. He was K2.
Sinatra, who had not been seen in public since a heart attack in Jan
uary 1997. was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m. in the emergency rixmi
of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said his publicist. Susan Reynolds.
Sinatra's wife. Barbara, was with him when he died, and the rest of
his family arrived a short time later, a source who requested anonymity
told The Associated Press.
A private funeral was planned. Reynolds said.
"Ol" Blue Eyes" was a master craftsman and ranked as one of the
most influential singers in this country's history In more than 200
albums, his music led the evolution from Big Band to vocal American
music.
The blunt, often aggressive son of Italian immigrants communicated
across generational lines with love songs filled with a rare mix of vul
nerability and verve — from "Strangers in the Night'' to "One For My
Baby." He refused to compromise — "I'm going to do as 1 please." he
once said — and his trademark song was "My Way."
His appearances created such hysteria and fits of swooning that
newspapers turned to psychiatrists for explanations. The Paramount,
and New York City's police, came in for a dose of Sinatramania in
when 10.000 kids jammed the ticket line and an estimated 20.(XM) others
piled into Times Square, breaking windows in the crush.
Continuing stalemate in Mideast talks
WASHINGTON (AP) — An intensive effort by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to reopen peace talks between Israel and the Pales
tinians ended yesterday without a breakthrough. But lower-level Amer
ican and Israeli specialists were directed to keep trying to fashion an
agreement.
With Israeli officials saying no agreement was reached on any of the
difficult issues, including how much territory Israel would relinquish on
the West Bank, the Clinton administration seemed to have suffered a
foreign policy setback.
"There is no agreement yet on the issues that were discussed." said
Gadi Baltiansky. the Israeli Embassy spokesman. "But they continue to
be discussed." he said.
Albright's spokesman. James P. Rubin, said. "We do have sufficient
reason to continue serious work," He said Albright had ended direct
talks with Israeli lYinie Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and would fly to
London this weekend to join President Clinton in meetings with Euro
pean leaders.
FBI cleared of Ruby Ridge charges
BOISE. Idaho (AP) — A federal judge yesterday dismissed an
involuntary manslaughter charge against an FBI sharpshooter for the
death ot white separatist Randy Weaver's wife during the siege at Ruby

honestly discharging his duties when he tired the shot that killed Vicki
Weaver on Aug. 22. 1992.

vidual cases, but not for a club with a large number of patients with dif
