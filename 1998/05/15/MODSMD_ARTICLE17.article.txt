## Notebook Take a 32-cent trip 
### 
Send a letter and express
your feelings the
old-fashioned way

Eighty years ago today
regular airmail service
between New York City,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
began under the direction of the Post
Office Department, a predecessor of
the United States Postal Service.
Today, the world greets electronic
mail with the same enthusiasm and
interest that regular mail must have
received. With college life operating
at a furious pace, the practice of letter
writing appears as obsolete as the
delivery technology used in 1918.
A few days ago I received an e-mail
from a friend stating, "I e-mail
because I'm too cheap to call long dis
tance, too lazy to write ... and, oh
yeah, because you're important to
me." His comment is as true as it is
funny. While costly college tuition
places a constraint on long-distance
phone bills, being lazy has an even
higher cost. The high- paced, low-pay
ing college career doesn't leave much
time in general; it leaves even less
time to think.
While typing at the keyboard is
more efficient with respect to time, it
is hardly more efficient in terms of
content. For me, the act of writing a
letter by hand has come to provide a
much needed opportunity to think
while writing, to be precise with
words, and as a result, to truly express
what I mean.
In"The Human Province," Elias
Cannetti, winner of the 1981 Nobel
Prize in Literature, indirectly suggests
how writing letters might fit into the
college experience, and moreover, an

education that will endure beyond col
lege.
He writes that there are "various
languages you ought to have — one
for your mother, which you will subse
quently never speak again; one which
you only read but never dare to write;
one in which you pray but without
understanding a word; one in which
you do arithmetic and to which all
money matters belong; one in which
you write (but no letters); one in
which you travel, and in this you can
write your letters."
Most Stanford students have devel
oped a language for mom most recent
ly used last weekend for Mothers
Day. We have a language in which we
read but never dare to write in our
academic undertakings. We have a
language in which we pray without
understanding prior to finals. One in
which we do arithmetic and to which
all money matters belong before each
quarter, and one in which we write
everyday.
It is rare that we take the opportu
nity to cultivate this last type of lan
guage — one in which we discover as
much about ourselves as we convey to
the addressee. A letter, as Cannetti
implies, is much like the spirit of a
great road trip since it allows us the
freedom and the time we need to tran
scend the confined — whether it be
Stanford's campus, or assumptions
about ourselves.
It is sad to witness the vanishing of
personal sincerity in what should be a
highly personal form of communica
tion. My friend's message reminded
me of the value of writing an occa
sional letter or two. E-mail anytime,
but spend 32 cents when you really
want to formulate your thoughts, and
to capture those of someone who is
"important to you."
