## Downfall of a black squirrel 
### 
WHEN LIFE AS
a student
seems hectic
and hopeless, I invite you
to consider the life of a
Stanford squirrel.
Although our young
squirrel cohabitants do
not need to take

midterms or attend sections, every frantic
movement the squirrel makes involves
spilt-second life or death decisions.
Freshman year I was exposed to the
harsh realities of this turbulent lifestyle.
Two of my friends were biking through
White Plaza one afternoon when they
detected a large amount of movement in
some overhanging trees.
This movement was being caused by a
young squirrel named Newton. Newton
was a black squirrel, the type that is
rumored to have been created by a failed
Stanford research experiment. The experi
ment involved giving the squirrels large
quantities of speed. Mountain Dew and an
early prototype of Viagra. The goal: to cre
ate a really squirrely squirrel. The black
squirrels were then released into the Stan
ford wild and like CIA LSD testing
washouts, they were ignored by the institu
tion that gave them their drug addictions.
This left the poor creatures in a perma
fried state of withdrawal.
In spite of his troubled heritage, New
ton was a typical Stanford squirrel in that
he spent most of his day scurrying from
branch to branch in hopes of humping
other squirrels. The remainder of his days
were spent crossing in front of bicycle

paths at the last possible second for cheap
adrenaline highs. Twice, he had been
sucked into the spokes and completed one
full revolution.
Unfortunately, there would be no more
hot squirrel sex-capades or death-defying
stunts for Newton. The movement that my
friends had spotted was a stumbling New
ton who had just crept onto a branch that
was not stable enough to support his Stan
ford squirrel obesity.
T he branch broke with a loud crack and
my friends observed fat Newton fall from a
height of 14 feet, or 20 squirrel lengths.
The terrified Newton released a yelp most
likely caused by his lungs collapsing as his
body hit the pavement.
The sound is similar to when a squirrel
is run over by a golf cart. His tiny squirrel
hands were still clutching the branch that
led to his demise.
Rushing to the scene, my friends
assessed the situation. Newton was
attempting to roll away from his landing
spot. Newton had survived!
But Newton's survival was not a bless
ing; he had incurred too much damage to
remain a functional squirrel. He laid on the
pavement paralyzed and whimpering. My
friends determined that the most humane
course of action would be to execute New
ton. It was at this point that the lives of
Newton and the freshmen of Alondra
would intersect.
My friends scooped up the dismantled
Newton and placed him in one of their
backpacks. They contemplated drowning
him immediately in the Claw fountain, but
they decided that drowning would be more

horrible then letting Newton die on his
own. Rejecting the surrounding methods
of execution, my friends rushed Newton
back to Alondra where a proper execution
could be arranged. Upon arrival, a crowd
quickly surrounded the squirrel.
Although everyone wanted the best for
Newton, large disagreements arose con
cerning the method. The girls would not
stand for a Newton execution and insisted
that he could make a recovery on his own if
he just had some time to heal. Meanwhile,
the guys had suggested everything from a
firing squad to constructing a miniature
electric chair for Newton. One particularly
disturbing suggestion was to choke Newton
to death. Everyone had ideas, but nobody
wanted to be the actual executioner.
Finally, a suggestion was made that
Newton would be placed in a bag which
would be attached to the exhaust pipe of a
car. Newton would be executed by means
of a gas chamber. Christopher Gruber, one
of the original men who discovered New
ton, would be in charge. Nobody could
bear to watch Newton die, so Gruber had
to sneak Newton out of the building.
As it was freshman year and cars were
in short supply, there were simply no cars
around at the time. Realizing that each
moment of Newton's suffering outweighed
the manner in which Newton was execut
ed, Gruber made a controversial decision.
At 7:13 p.m. on May 13, 1996 Newton was
pronounced dead after being smashed with
a large rock.
