# NSI shift in works
## 
### Jennie Berry Staff writer 
In a few years, many students may he able to apply to
Stanford on the World Wide Weh. find out over the In
ternet what course requirements would change if they
declared a new major and receive University financial
aid reminders by e-mail.
University Registrar Roger Printup is leading an
evaluation of the Network for Student Information, the
software system that is central to conducting the admis
sions, financial aid. registrations, records and bursar
business of the University. The evaluation could lead to
replacement of the current system by December 2000.
"The idea behind the NSI evaluation is to measure
the effectiveness of the current business and technical
environments, to measure the readiness of marketplace
system solutions to help us. as well as to measure our
own willingness to change." said Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya.
The University is looking at three different options


Printup
for the current system: leaving it
virtually as it is now, updating it
with a new in-house system, or pur
chasing a new system from an out
side software vender.
In June, the University will de
cide if it wants to invite an outside
software vendor to come in and re
place the current NSI system. Such
a project would cost the University
millions of dollars.
"This is not your $5 piece of soft
ware you get from Fry's or some
thing you get off the Internet,"
Printup explained. "This is a very
sophisticated, multilinked system."
NSI serves the Stanford under
graduate and graduate student
body as well as 950 faculty and staff
members. Printup has involved
hundreds of people in his NSI as
sessment.
"Technology is playing a more
important role in the support that
we offer, and we want to make cer
tain that the system we have avail
able to our students is an effective
one," Montoya said.

Printup claimed a changed sys
tem would provide a better level of
service, would be easier to operate
and would be well integrated.
"[The currentj NSI isn't as flexi
ble and doesn't have as many fea
tures as systems developed more
recently," Printup said.
Under a new system, students
could experiment with possible
majors and minors and see the
course requirements they would
have to fulfill — even the specific
courses they could take to fulfill
those requirements.
According to Printup, a new sys
tem "doesn't replace academic ad
vising but helps students know
more about where they are in their
degree and what options they have
remaining to complete their de
gree." He added that it would allow
students to have more substantial
talks with their advisers because
they could try out academic scenar
ios on their computer before talk
ing to their advisers about them.
"My objective in all of this is to
provide a higher quality of service
to students and faculty by having
information available more easi
ly," Printup said.

He said such change is in
evitable; it is "more a question of
when."
The current system was de
signed and implemented in the
1980s or, as Printup termed it, "an
cient history in computer years." In
the 19905, the University added the
old text version of Axess to it.

multilinked system.'

The current system, like that of
most other universities, was devel
oped in-house. "We're right along
with our peers right now in terms of
having systems that were devel
oped in the universities them
selves," Printup said.
However, he added, a trend
among more and more universities
is to turn to outside venders to de
velop their information systems.
Four companies came to Stan
ford at the end of fall quarter to
show what they could offer the
University. According to Printup,
only two companies had a possibil
ity of meeting Stanford's needs.

Since January, the University
has been closely looking at these
two companies: People Soft and
Systems and Computer Technolo
gy, more commonly known as SC T.
Yale University uses SCT; Cor
nell University and the University
of Michigan use People Soft.
Printup said he has gained valu
able insight by examining other
schools. "We don't want to raise
false expectations about how
quickly and at what cost we can do
this project," Printup said. "Many
people enter this type of project
with rose-colored glasses on."
In addition to improving system
performance, Printup said the Uni
versity must also address the fact
that the system rests on an outdat
ed database.
New computer technicians are
trained to operate databases differ
ent from the one Stanford uses.
The constant changes in the
database, such as the new Draw
system this year, require full-time
workers.
"The system doesn't stay static,
so we have to have people who are
working on the system all the
time," Printup said.
