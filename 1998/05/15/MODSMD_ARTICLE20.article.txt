Questioning inclusiveness
Last Monday's Daily editorial about the
Stanford University Big Sibling Program
praised SUBS for offering "incoming fresh
men the chance to join a small student-sup
port group independent of cultural or reli
gious background." However, it criticized
the program for advertising its inclusiveness.
The basis of the argument is that existing
cultural and religious sibling programs are
"open to any and all students who ask to par
ticipate." The question to be raised is how
open these existing sibling programs are. No
one argues the point that the programs are
inclusive, "in theory." But. what is the reali
ty? How much cross-enlistment really exists
if these sibling programs are directed toward
a specific group of people? Simply put. these
programs don't exist for the benefit of the
entire freshman population.
I would agree with the argument that
SUBS should "be wary of undermining the
cultural, religious and educational value that
existing sibling programs contribute to the
larger Stanford community."

However. The Daily should have been a
little more thorough in its investigation. 1 e
mailed one of the SUBS program organizers,
Stephen Kane. He replied that SUBS was
originally designed as an umbrella organiza
tion. Other big sibling program coordinators
had liked the idea of SUBS, but the Univer
sity wouldn't allow the SUBS program to
mail information to incoming freshmen. In
my opinion. The Daily's criticism of the
SUBS program was invalid and based on
poor journalism.

T.J Babbitt's column in yesterday's Daily
raises an interesting point. Should the colum
nist write about "what the people want" or
what he or she wants ?
We are deluged today by mediocre jour
nalism. mediocre politics and mediocre
entertainment, and the only excuse is "this is
what the people want."
Why is there this exaggerated pandering

to so-called public opinion? It seems to me
that public opinion (at best) is an aggregate
of individual opinions that have been formed
by independent thought. Journalists, analysts
and columnists succecd because of their abil
ity to bring their own unique perspective to
the events that they cover.
In fact, I would go as far as to say that the
best way to contribute to society is to achieve
excellence through the development of one's
own talents and ideas. Although this point of
view could lead one to a dark room filled
with Ayn Rand tomes, it at least prevents us
from tolerating / accepting the sort of inani
ties that the modern media foists upon us by
claiming "the public wants it."
I applaud T.J. Babbitt's desire to under
stand and explore what people are interested
in. I would, however, also recommend that
he continue to write about things that he
finds interesting and fascinating. After all, I
read The Daily columns not because I want
my opinions echoed in print, but because I
want to hear what someone else has to say.

Please park politely
I looked out my living room window, and
saw that again she had parked in front of my
house in such a way that prohibited another
car from parking. This time, I asked her
kindly if she would please move her car for
ward so another car might park there as
well.
She responded by saying she had no time.
She had to catch the bus to get to her class at
Stanford. She then added she did not block
my driveway. I found her remark rather dis
courteous, and called both the Palo Alto
Police and the Stanford Transportation
Department. I found both departments
more courteous than the Stanford student.
Last year a student in a hurry to get to his
class was driving fast and rammed into the
back of my car as I was pulling out of my
driveway. He got out of his car and said it
was my fault, and that I would have to pay
for the damages. He called later and asked if
we could just let it go.
Stanford students are charged for park

ing permits on campus. Stanford has areas
where only Stanford residents can park. Col
lege Terrace is being used by more and
more students as a free parking lot. The least
that the students could do is be courteous in
the way they park.
Do Stanford students think that they are
immune to social responsibilities and normal
courtesies? Hopefully not. Academic
achievement is not sufficient to become a
successful human being. Some students
seem to need lessons in integrity and ethics.
I am hoping they will read this letter and
show more of their humane side to their
neighbors.
