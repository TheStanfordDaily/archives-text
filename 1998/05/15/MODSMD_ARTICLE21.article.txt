Person reported his neighbor is
draining his pool into the street.

Someone reported his neighbor's gardener
using a gas-powered leaf blower.

Someone reported his gardener had had a
leaf blower stolen from his truck.
I grew up in Los Altos, a medium-size
Silicon Valley suburb that still clings nostal
gically to its roots as a quiet town of apricot
orchards. There was a time, I must admit,
when I was quite embarrassed to hark from
a place where cell phones and leaf blowers
dominated the local paper's "Crime
Report."
So when Los Altos first headed up the
leaf blower wars in the late 1980s, I was
there with derisive grin and ironic comment.
Now, more than a decade later, Menlo
Park, Palo Alto and communities through
out the state are following suit. That which
used to be an anomalous issue popping up
weekly to appease my satirical appetite is

now a statewide political agenda.
Why are gas-powered leaf blowers such
the hot-button issue? Perhaps because, as
many Peninsula homeowners point out,
they are annoying. They are loud and envi
ronmentally unfriendly. Palo Alto Mayor
Pro Fem Paul Collacchi put it simply,
"Everyone agrees that really noisy leaf
blowers are horrible and they have to go."
By "everyone," of course, Collacchi is
describing residential homeowners, not the
day laborers who use the leaf blowers on
acres of sod and geraniums. These hired
gardeners are currently less than pleased
with the idea that their capital investments
(leaf blowers can cost $350) are now illegal.
In Menlo Park, the gardeners have
mounted a successful campaign to raise the
1 ,S()0 signatures necessary for a referendum
next November. They say prohibiting leaf
blowers will hurt their incomes by decreas
ing the number of jobs they can complete.
(Mayor Collacchi's recent suggestion of a
$5 per week pay increase as compensation
for lost time has not swayed them.)
The gardeners also claim that such legis

lation has, embroidered in its ideology,
some thick threads of racism. With this
argument they are attempting to plunge
past fallen foliage to strike at the root of a
deeper issue. But the editorial board of the
Palo Alto Weekly would endorse no such
dialogue. "There are many regrettable
impacts of the leaf blower debate," it said,
"but the most disturbing is the argument by
gardeners that regulating leaf blowers is
fundamentally a racist action aimed at Lati
nos. There is not even the slightest evi
dence to support this assertion."
Having grown up in a conservatively
affluent and liberally apathetic community
myself, the Palo Alto Weekly's editorial
rings familiarly defensive. In part, this is
understandable. Despite my adversity to
Los Altos' politics, the people I know and
love best have always been distinctly non
racist.
But race is an issue in Palo Alto. Menlo
Park and Los Altos. Race is an issue when
a mayor suggests, in all sincerity, that $5 a
week is fair compensation to gardeners
cleaning in a community of million-dollar

homes and six- and seven-figure salaries.
Race is an issue when the Latino popula
tion in a community shrinks to almost
nothing after day laborers go home at
nightfall. Race is an issue â€” sometimes
overtly and always implicitly. But, compli
cated by questions of power and privilege,
it is generally simpler to ignore it.
So the issue is just leaf blowers. Those
confounded things are noisy. They are envi
ronmentally malevolent and antagonistic to
the interests of a community. These are not
racist arguments, true. But freeways, espe
cially when they are built straight through a
community, are much noisier, more pollut
ing and more divisive than leaf blowers. So
are toxic waste plants. East Palo Alto want
ed neither. It got both.
Now. East Palo Altans (oh. is that where
day laborers go?) are no longer welcome to
cart their gas-powered leaf blowers over to
clean up the lawns of their affluent neigh
bors. But Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents go right ahead and drive their Mer
cedes down Highway 101; Los Altans send
our pesticides and Jacuzzi cleaners over to

ROMIC Chemical Corporation. Race isn't
involved in such disparity?
But whereas the freeway debate and the
ROMIC debate were truncated at birth,
the leaf blower debate spreads. These are
the self-imposed, rose-tinted earplugs of
privilege lulling a child to complacency as
she grows up in a community that is Palo
Alto times two.
When I confessed such sentiments to a
friend in El Salvador this past summer, he
turned to me reproachfully. "Compafiera,
you have to be proud of your community."
I don't know, maybe the population of
Peninsula suburbia, having shut down
those noisy leaf blowers, will have an easier
time hearing what their gardeners are say
ing. Whether they will listen is, perhaps,
another question.

Jocelyn Wiener is a junior majoring in his
tory. Someday, she would like to appear in
the Los Altos Town Crier Crime report.
Unfortunately, she is too much of a goody
two-shoes to ever use a gas-powered leaf
blower.
