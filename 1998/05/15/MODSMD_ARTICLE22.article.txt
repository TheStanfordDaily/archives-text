On Monday, Nabeel Ibrahim, president
of the Organization of Arab-American Stu
dents in Stanford (OASIS) and Salim Yusu
fali, president of the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN) co-authored a
letter to The Daily in which they responded
to Alv Remtulla's column (May 4) and pro
moted a campus-wide screening of the docu
mentary "People and the Land."
The producer of the film. Tom Hayes,
claims that "discussion cannot occur until
Americans are aware of the way the infor
mation they receive is being filtered." 1 low
ever, in packaging his product, he could
stand to be a bit more forthcoming.
"People and the Land" is among the most
controversial depictions of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict ever produced. While Ibrahim
and Yusufali make reference to Tom Hayes'
letter accompanying the film, they failed to
note another letter, from Mark Rosenblum,
co-founder of Americans for Peace Now.
Even though he opposes continuation of
Israeli occupation. Rosenblum wrote that
the film is "approximately 20 percent accu

rate but ultimately becomes part of the prob
lem in affairs between Palestine and Israel in
presenting the "other side' in totally demonic
terms."
Unfortunately, the film shares this distinc
tion with Remtulla's column. Both neglect
to inform their audience of several basic facts
about the creation of Israel and the Palestini
an refugee crisis.
Neither Remtulla nor the film mention
that Israel was attacked by Egypt. Syria, Jor
dan. Iraq and Lebanon on the day it declared
independence. Neither Remtulla nor the film
note that the original occupiers of the post
mandate West Bank and Gaza Strip were
not Israelis. They were Egyptians and Jorda
nians. who decided not to create a Palestini
an state and to instead continue to push for
the annihilation of Israel. Neither Remtulla
nor the film bother to mention that the clo
sure of the occupied territories came after
Hamas-sponsored suicide bombs which took
the life of over 70 Israeli civilians.
Nevertheless, the event led to several con
structive conversations in dorms across cam
pus. If "People and the Land" tan get Jews
and Muslims talking, it served a noble purpose.

The same can not be said of OASIS/
MSAN's co-sponsorship of Richard Curtiss.
In his presentation. Mr. Curtiss, a former
Foreign Service officer, chose to focus his
attacks on the organized American Jewish
community in an extremely unconstructive
manner. He twice linked the current Wash
ington scandals with an American Jewish
"conspiracy," but offered no evidence to sup
port his claim.
On another occasion, he questioned the
loyalty of Jews who serve their country in the
American government. In the past. Mr. Cur
tiss has published countless articles that play
on tired, unfortunate stereotypes of Jews.
Such rhetoric suggests that Mr. Curtiss' goal
is not to participate in dialogue, but rather to
polarize the parties and inhibit intelligent dis
cussion.
The Jewish Community Relations Coun
cil welcomes OASIS and MSAN's efforts to
bring a Palestinian perspective to the Stan
ford community. We are excited about the
proposed Jewish-Muslim dialogue which we
hope will be sponsored by the Office of Mul
ticultural Education. At the same time, we
note that speakers who attack Jews simply

for being good citizens offer nothing in the
marketplace of ideas.

Tips for the cartoonist
I found The Daily's editorial cartoon on
May 13, which depicted a generic Indian sit
ting on a condom-sheathed nuclear missile
offensive. In the cartoon the anonymous
Indian vehemently denies that he is a
"eunuch." The most charitable interpreta
tion I can give this cartoon is that it is in poor
taste. At worst, it is racially insensitive and
even downright racist.
The cartoonist wants the viewer to avoid
the latter conclusion, because he includes a
note claiming the words of the Indian are "an
actual quote." Unfortunately, this note does
not shield the cartoon from the racist label
since the quote is not attributed to anyone!
Not having any cartooning skills myself, I
am loathe to give advice on the subject to
anyone. Nevertheless. 1 cannot resist in this
case. So for what it's worth. Mr. Cartoonist:

1. The reason your cartoon is offensive is
that it paints with too broad a brush. Effec
tive political cartoons specifically identify
who is being lampooned. For example, you
could have drawn a picture of the Indian
prime minister on your missile with the name
of his political party (BJP) across his chest.
This would have simultaneously avoided a
generic and spurious attack on Indians and
made the cartoon more pointed.
2. If you are going to use a quote, use one
that is well-known. Barring that, at least
identify the source of the quote. You see. op
ed cartoonists are subject to the same jour
nalistic standards as other reporters.
3. You should try to avoid stereotyping, if
possible. Following this rule, you would not
depict, for example, a generic Stanford con
servative as a KKK member, or a generic
Indian as an insecure jingoistic militarist.
Thanks largely to conservatives. Stanford
no longer has a speech code, which could be
used to punish people who draw such car
toons. On this point, I think both the car
toonist and I are thankful.
