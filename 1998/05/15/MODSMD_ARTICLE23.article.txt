## Southwestern Missouri St. up first for Card Sluggers head to regional 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER. Okla. — The
Stanford softball program is headed
someplace it's never been — Stillwa
ter, Okla.
But it's not the destination that's
important — it's what's happening
there. Oklahoma State is host to the
NCAA Regional No. 8 today
through Sunday, making Stillwater
the sight of postseason action.
And when the ninth-ranked Car
dinal (39-16) takes the field today at 5
p.m. PS I'against Southwest Missouri
State (30-20), it will mark the first
postseason appearance in the pro
gram's history.
But don't expect Stanford to be in
awe at its first regional showing. I'he
Cardinal has the top seed and feels it
is more than capable of winning the
regional and advancing to the Soft
ball College World Series.
"1 think the whole team feels real
ly confident." said junior pitcher
Becky Blevins. "If you talked to any

body on the team right now they'd
say we're going to the College World
Series. I don't feel any pressure
[being the No. 1 seed], I think it just
puts us in a better position. It's an ad
vantage for us. but I don't feel any
pressure because we've never been
here before."

■ Today: No. 9 Stanford (39-16) vs.
Southwest Missouri State (30-20), 5
p.m. PST.

But in order to advance, Stanford
will have to take care of the opposi
tion in Stillwater this weekend. And
first up are the Lady Bears. South
west Missouri State is making its third
consecutive appearance in the tour
nament by claiming its third straight
Missouri Valley Conference title.
The Lady Bears are led on the
mound by 25-game winner Nora
Cagwin. The junior has a 1.19 ERA
and 212 strikeouts on the season.
Cagwin was also named the Missouri
Valley Conference pitcher of the

year.
At the plate the Lady Bears are
led by senior second baseman Diedre
Shores. The .354 hitter was a first
team all-conference selection along
with sophomore catcher Tawnya
Cirout and senior outfielder Heather
Anderson.
"She's tough." said Stanford head
coach John Rittman of Cagwin.
"Everybody I've talked to says
you've got to he disciplined with her.
She hits locations and moves the hall
around so we've got to try to put the
hall in play, put a little pressure on
their defense, get some runners in
scoring position and play good de
fense ourselves. I expect them to he a
very scrappy team. Every game is a
war from here on out. If you come out
flat this time of year, something's
wrong."
Southwest Missouri State enters
the tournament riding a 10-game win
streak; however, the Lady Bears have
not played a tournament team since
