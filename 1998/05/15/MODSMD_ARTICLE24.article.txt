# Pac-10 dominates the field
## National softball strength lies in the west 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER. Okla. — When you talk about con
ference domination of a sport, things like men's basket
ball and the Atlantic Coast Conference come to mind.
Or maybe even the Southeastern Conference in
women's basketball.
Whatever comes to mind, you can bet there's no con
ference as dominant in one sport as the Pacific 10 Con
ference in softball. For starters, the Pac-10 has claimed
the last 10 NCAA titles (Arizona in 1991, '93, '94, '96,
'97 —and UCLA in 1988.'89,'90.'92,'95. The 1995 title
was stripped from the Bruins for NCAA violations).
And with the two-time defending champion Wildcats
earning the top seed in the tournament this year, the
streak could quite easily continue.
But Arizona isn't the only Pac-10 team in the tour
nament. Washington, Stanford, California, Arizona
State and Oregon all got in. making a total of six Pac-10
teams in the regionals — at least two more than any
other conference.
Sounds impressive? Consider the fact that Washing
ton State and USC do not have softball programs and
that UCLA cannot participate in this year's tournament

due to NCAA probation, and it gets a little more im
pressive. Six out of seven eligible teams from the Pac-1(
are in the postseason.
"I think every team has an opportunity to be suc
cessful," said Stanford head coach John Rittman of the
Fac-10 schools. "In '96, four Pac-l()teams made it to the
World Series."
This season three of the six teams picked up No. 1
seeds (Stanford. Arizona and Washington), and the
Wildcats and Huskies are hosts to their respective re
gionals. So if everything goes according to seedings. the
Pac-10 should get three teams into the Softball College
World Series.
But don't jump too far ahead. All three teams still
have to survive their respective regionals, and Cal. Ore
gon and Arizona State all have a shot in their regionals.
The No. 16 Sun Devils (37-25) landed the fourth seed
in Region 6 and will take on eighth-ranked Texas (46-
14) in the first game of that regional today in Clearwa
ter. Fla. The other half of the draw is just as tough with
No. 23 Florida (47-20) and the host South Florida (55-
12) ranked sixth in the nation but overlooked for a top
seed in the tournament.
Cal and Oregon both landed
three seeds in the tournament, with
the 24th-ranked Bears playing in
Region 7 in Fresno and the Ducks
in Lincoln, Neb., in Region 2. In
order to advance, Cal (34-25) will
have to defeat No. IS Cal State-
Northridge (37-17) and top-seed
ed, third-ranked Fresno State (45-
10).
"Cal's at Fresno State," Rittman
said. "It's not going to be easy. But
Cal has won there and advanced to
the World Series as recently as '%
so that's definitely a possibility."

Oregon (3N-2 1 )) meets up with
No. I 1 ) lowa (37-IS) in its first game
and would likely have to defeat
fifth-ranked Nebraska (44-10), the
host team, in order to advance to
the World Series.
As for the top seeds. No. I Ari
zona (61-3) takes on Niagara (22-
17). The Metro Atlantic Confer
ence champions. Niagara had to win
a play-in against Robert Morris in
order to qualify for the tournament.
The other two teams in Arizona's
bracket are No. 10 Hawaii (45-13)
and unranked Pacific (27-20).
The No. 3 Huskies are hosting in
Seattle and face the Southland Con
ference champion Northwestern
State (40-16) in their first game.

Alter that, the bracket gets a little
more difficult as 12th-ranked
Louisiana State (56-12) and No. 15
Long Beach State (3K-1K) occupy
the other half of the draw.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal (39-
l(i) faces Southwest Missouri State
(30-20) in game one and will meet
either host No. 13 Oklahoma Shite
(37-17) or 14th-ranked Florida
St;ite (51-19) in game two.
"Any time you play in the Pac
-10, it's going to prepare you for the
postseason," Rittman said. "The
Pac-10 schedule has definitely pre
pared us for what we're going to
see here. Every weekend it's a
tough battle, so that prepares you
for this."
