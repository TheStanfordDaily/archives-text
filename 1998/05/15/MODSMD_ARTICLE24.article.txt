# Pac-10 dominates the field
## National softball strength lies in the west

STILLWATER. Okla. — When you talk about con
ference domination of a sport, things like men's basket
ball and the Atlantic Coast Conference come to mind.
Or maybe even the Southeastern Conference in
women's basketball.
Whatever comes to mind, you can bet there's no con
ference as dominant in one sport as the Pacific 10 Con
ference in softball. For starters, the Pac-10 has claimed
the last 10 NCAA titles (Arizona in 1991, '93, '94, '96,
'97 —and UCLA in 1988.'89,'90.'92,'95. The 1995 title
was stripped from the Bruins for NCAA violations).
And with the two-time defending champion Wildcats
earning the top seed in the tournament this year, the
streak could quite easily continue.
But Arizona isn't the only Pac-10 team in the tour
nament. Washington, Stanford, California, Arizona
State and Oregon all got in. making a total of six Pac-10
teams in the regionals — at least two more than any
other conference.
Sounds impressive? Consider the fact that Washing
ton State and USC do not have softball programs and
that UCLA cannot participate in this year's tournament

due to NCAA probation, and it gets a little more im
pressive. Six out of seven eligible teams from the Pac-1(
are in the postseason.
"I think every team has an opportunity to be suc
cessful," said Stanford head coach John Rittman of the
Fac-10 schools. "In '96, four Pac-l()teams made it to the
World Series."
This season three of the six teams picked up No. 1
seeds (Stanford. Arizona and Washington), and the
Wildcats and Huskies are hosts to their respective re
gionals. So if everything goes according to seedings. the
Pac-10 should get three teams into the Softball College
World Series.
But don't jump too far ahead. All three teams still
have to survive their respective regionals, and Cal. Ore
gon and Arizona State all have a shot in their regionals.
The No. 16 Sun Devils (37-25) landed the fourth seed
in Region 6 and will take on eighth-ranked Texas (46-
14) in the first game of that regional today in Clearwa
ter. Fla. The other half of the draw is just as tough with
No. 23 Florida (47-20) and the host South Florida (55-
12) ranked sixth in the nation but overlooked for a top
seed in the tournament.
