SEATTLE — It was an uglv day
in Seattle yesterday.
Rain splattered Washington's
Husky Ballpark, clouds swept across
the sky and a blistering wind cut
straight to the bone. But for the No.
I Cardinal (41-l 1.22-8), the weather
had nothing to do with the day's mis
ery.
All that Stanford felt was the
shocking 16-4 loss to No. 19 Wash
ington (38-15,17-7) yesterday in the
first of the best-of-three Pacific 10
Conference Championship series.
This was the Cardinal's worst loss
since Feb. 16. 1996 when Fresno
State pounded Stanford 16-1.
"I don't think that we were very
competitive." said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "They just
beat us every way that you could."
Stanford was plagued by all parts
of its game. The pitching staff al
lowed 16 runs (11 earned), hit four

batters, threw two wild pitches, al
lowed three past balls, and gave up
16 hits. The defense committed an
uncharacteristic three errors, and
the offense could only score four
runs.
In the first inning, junior

watched in dismay as Magruder

only pushed one run across the plate
in the first inning, it was the begin

The Cardinal, however, claimed
its only lead in the top of the first in
ning as sophomore first baseman
John Gall clobbered a 1-0 pitch just
fair over the left field wall. Gall's
13th home run on the season
brought in sophomore designated
hitter Jeff Rizzo, who reached base
on a walk.
This lead lasted only until the

inflicted their more serious damage
in the later innings.
In an unbelievable two-out rally
in the fourth inning, Magruder, Ste
fanick and shortstop Kevin Miller
crossed the plate to give the Huskies
a 5-2 lead.
Three more Huskies, Magruder,
Na and second baseman Marc Rit
tenhouse, extended the lead to 8-2
as they came home in the bottom of
the fifth to the jubilant cheers of the
Husky crowd.
Washington continued to slaugh
ter the Cardinal in the seventh as the
entire Husky lineup took a turn at
the plate, tallying seven runs to
bring the Washington lead to 15-2.
Freshman Jason Young started the
inning for Stanford and loaded the
bases before being relieved by ju
nior Tony Cogan, who completed
the game. All seven Huskies crossed
the plate in the seventh before the
first out was recorded.
And still the Cardinal bats slum
bered on. blanked by the superb
play of Jeff Heaverlo (5-2). In pitch
ing a complete game, the
righthander tallied 11 strikeouts on
the day to silence the slumping Car
dinal offense.
"To hold that type of ballclub

like [Heaverlo] did gave us a chance
to win." said Washington head
coach Ken Knutson.
Cardinal junior center fielder
Jodv Gerut garnered a run for Stan
ford with a home run over the right
field fence in the eighth to bring the
score to 15-3. Gerut was 2 for 4 on
the day.

'I don't think we were very
competitive. They just beat
us every way that
you could.'
— Mark Marquess

Magruder scored again in the
eighth, while junior second base
man Tony Schrager tallied the final
Stanford run of the afternoon in the
top of the ninth to bring the score to
its final 16-4.
"It was fun. It was a hell of a day,"
Heaverlo said. "It shows Stanford
that we're not going to roll over be
cause they've got a big number one
in front of their name."
The Cardinal will challenge the
Huskies again today at 1 p.m. Stan
ford's junior ace Jeff Austin (12-2) is
expected to face Husky freshman
Jeff Carlsen (7-3) in today's game.
Stanford's starter for Saturday's
game, if necessary, has not been an
nounced.
