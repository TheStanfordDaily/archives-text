# Strand throws his injuries aside
## 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
The fiery sensation that shot through Justin Strand's back on an
afternoon early this February wasn't cause for much alarm for the
seasoned athlete.
After all. this senior football standout-turned-track star has seen

his share of serious injuries, including a busted knee from a Big
Game dog pile that led to six surgeries on his right leg.
But for the All-American thrower and co-captain of Stanford's
highly respected track and field team, perhaps the pain should have
caused a bit more concern.
"I thought it was just a pulled muscle." said Strand, who was
practicing his throwing at the time.
After an MRI and a couple of spinal injections, however, the
three disks that were bulging out of Strand's lower back were prop
erly diagnosed.
With the NCAA national meet just weeks away. Strand is light
ing his way back from that injury to the top of the national ranks in
his event — the hammer throw. It was in thisevent that he captured
fourth at the NC 'A A Championships last year and competed in the
19% Olympic Trials in Atlanta. And according to Strand, there is
still some unfinished business to be taken care of this year.
"I should have won I'ac-lOs last year," Strand said, "and it was
disappointing not to win nationals."
If Strand can attain these goals this year, he will have come a
long way from not just early this season but from his early days in
the Stanford track program.
Strand attributes the drastic turnaround to the hard work of
head coach Vin Lananna. who first began coaching the Stanford
squads just before Strand's freshman year.
" This program has grown leaps and bounds since Vin arrived."
Strand said. "There has been so much improvement."
Lananna has made it clear that the respect is mutual.
"Justin is a phenomenal competitor." 1 ananna said. "When we
needed a shot putter. Justin has been a shot putter, when we need
ed a javelin thrower, he's been a javelin thrower. And he learned
the hammer from scrap."
Strand showed promising talent in high school, competing in
three sports 111 high school, winning the Washington state discus
championship for Gon/aga Preparatory SchixM in Spokane. Wash.
The Cocur d'Alene. Idaho native commuted across state lines
every day just to attend school.
At Stanford. Strand participated only in lixithall until dixtors
barred him from playing after his sophomore season because of his
injuries. 1 le started throwing the hammer around in his spare time,
and s(xm he was making an impact in the Cardinal throwing line
up.
Still. Strand did not really consider himself a gixxl hammer
thrower until he qualified lor and competed in the l Olympic
