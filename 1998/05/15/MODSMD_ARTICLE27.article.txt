■ Saturday: Cardinal Qualifier at Cobb Track
and Angell Field.

"There will be representatives from a lot
of the top Pac-10 men's and women's
teams," said Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna.
Most of Stanford's athletes will compete
in the Cardinal Qualifier, which will be the
athletes' last opportunity to post a qualifying
mark for the Pac-10 conference meet to be
held next weekend on the Farm. Cardinal
heptathletes and lone decathlete junior Josh
Cileason will compete this weekend for the
Pac-10 championship.
The Decathlon/Heptathlon Champi
onships will feature Cileason in the de
cathlon. while juniors Katrinka Jackson and
Tracyc Lawyer and sophomores Julie Tinker
and Joy Cioff will compete in the heptathlon.
Lawyer is the defending Pac-10 hep
tathlon champion. She placed fourth in the
NCAA championship meet as a sophomore,
and has already qualified for the meet again
this year in the heptathlon with a point total
best of 5.544 and the high jump with a leap
over the bar at an even 6 feet.
Cileason. who has posted a season best of
6.404 points, will face stiff competition from
the likes of Arizona's power combination of
Dominic Johnson and Klaus Ambrosch. w ho
have posted point total bests of 7.362 and
7.407, respectively, as well as California's
Bevan Hart (7.351). All three have qualified
for the national meet. Cileason was fifth in

last year's Pac-10 decathlon.
Most of the athletes competing in the
multi-event championships will also have the
opportunity to compete in next weekend's
Pac-10 team championships.
The Cardinal Qualifier, which is set to
take place tomorrow evening, promises fast
times and high marks as athletes will attempt
to eclipse qualifying standards for both the
Pac-10 and national meets.
Squads from many Pac-10 teams, including
Cal. Washington State and conference-lead
ing Arizona, as well as partial squads from the
Arkansas women and defending national
champion men's teams will compete.
Though all of these teams will provide
stiff competition, the Card's greatest compe
tition may come from itself, as athletes vie
for the 24 available Stanford spots for the
Pac-10 meet.
Both the Cardinal men and women have
qualified greater than the allotted 24 maxi
mum athletes, and intra-squad competition
may decide w ho competes next weekend and
who will watch from the stands.
"We've got about 30 qualified for the
men's team and as many on the women's side
as well," Lananna said. ' We've just got too
many good athletes for them to compete at
the Pac-lOs."
On the men's side, look for the Cal squad
to provide exciting action in the jumps and
sprints. Washington State has top caliber
throwers as does Arizona, and both WSU
and Arkansas should give the Card men
heated competition in the distance races.
For the women. Arizona's Amy Skieresz
is one of the top distance runners in the na
tion. and Arkansas' women are also deep in
the distances. Washington State has a strong
sprinting unit, and they are well-rounded in
many of the other events.
The meet will not be scored for team
points and is set to begin tomorrow after the
Decathlon/Heptathlon Championships have
been contested.
