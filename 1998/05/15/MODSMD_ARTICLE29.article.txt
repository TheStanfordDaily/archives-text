## On life's long journey, look for the little things 
### 
Pearls of Wisdom

How sad I was. A great job, a
loving family, comfort destined to
last until my declining years, I
thought I had it all. I didn't. In
fact, my life was hollow, a pathet
ic charade. I had entirely forgot
ten about the little things.
All too often in the modern
world we let the big things —
cars, houses, money — obscure
our view of what is really impor
tant. Even now, I can scarcely
believe I spent so long worrying
about my mortgage, my job, my
wife. If only I had thought a little
bit moie about the little things.
Like bullets,
i Bullets 'are little. And now,
thank God, I have 4020 of them.

Even now, as I finger these little
things, sit them in my palm, roll
them round my mouth, I am filled
with a warm glow. I'm a changed
man.
I thought I could find happi
ness in the love of my children.
But children aren't really little;
sometimes it's easy to forget that.
In this modern world stripped of
value, we too readily confuse
youth with littleness. Actually
some children are quite large,
given their age. So I left my chil
dren and looked for some really
little people: midgets and Victori
ans.
If only we all took some time
off and considered these things,

just for a moment. We'd see the
joy left out of our lives. Little,
simple things can fill your hollow
life.
Those little voices in your
head, for instance. Take some
time to really listen to them.
I used to ignore them. Now
that I do everything they tell me
to I'm much happier. I don't think
I've ever laughed so much in my
life as I have in the past three
years. In fact, there's not been a
moment in the past three years
when I haven't been laughing. I
can't exactly remember what it
was I was laughing about in the
first place. But I don't care, I just
continue laughing and poking my

eyes with my thumb. That's why
the little things are so important.
When I told my family I was
leaving them they thought I was
insane. But tell me, what is insan
ity? Is it thanklessly toiling in a
big job all your life only to end
up in an anonymous plot in a
graveyard, discarded and forgot
ten?
Or is it to dress in scuba gear
and, muttering about bigness,
march out of your house chewing
bullets and crashing big cymbals
together? Tell me, who's really
insane and who is just trying to
live life to the full?
I-almost forgot molecules!
Take care of your molecules.

They're the most little of all little
things. Some people don't look
after their molecules properly, in
which case, frankly, they don't
deserve to keep them. I have a lot
of other people's molecules now.
I keep them in a suitcase.
Are classes really so impor
tant? Are you really so anxious to
have a successful career that
you'd sacrifice so much?
Grab liftj by the tail and hold
on for as long as you can. If you
let go for a moment, you 11 lose it
forever. Take notice of the little
things.

This writing is little. Little letters little letters. 1 like this writ
ing. I can see its appeal. You can pretty much write anything
and people will think, "Oh, it's in italics, it'll be funny then. '
