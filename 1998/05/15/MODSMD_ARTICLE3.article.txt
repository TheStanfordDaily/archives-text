# Birthday party
## Israel celebrates 50 
### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
More than 60 people gathered yesterday in the Old
Union Courtyard to celebrate the nation's 50th birthday
with song, dance and short excerpts from speeches by for
mer Israeli leaders, such as David Ben (iurion.
The celebration of Israel's independence is an annual
event at Stanford. Tzipor Ulman, a doctoral student in
chemistry and president of the Israeli Student Organiza
tion. gave a short speech during the event. He said the cel
ebration marks "50 years of democracy and 50 years of hop
ing for peace" in the region.
The event, sponsored by Hillel, brought together stu
dents from several different Jewish organizations. Jim Fin
sten. a coterminal international policy studies student and
co-chair of the Stanford Jewish Community Relations
Council, said. "We feel very fortunate to live in a time
where there is an Israel."
"I feel that this homeland is deserved - it's much more
than a compensatory gift for what [the Jews] sulfered in the
Holocaust," said Meredith I Idler, t 'lass ol '97.
Some students were decidedly aware ol the significance
of Israeli independence for the Palestinians as well.
Heller said that ideally, the exis
tence of the state of Israel would not
translate into the displacement of the
Palestinians, but instead, a situation
in which different peoples live to
gether harmoniously.
"I don't know how to reconcile
(the displacement of the Palestinians
with the creation of the Israeli state],
but now that the Israeli state exists,
it's a matter of strengthening it and
encouraging harmony with its neigh
bors." she said.
"I think it's great to celebrate Is
rael. her accomplishments, and the
accomplishments of her people, but

it's important to remember that lots
of people have suffered injustices"
with the creation of the Israeli state,
said senior Oren Ahoobim. "The
Palestinians need a homeland of their
own. and hopefully soon, we can cel
ebrate both homelands." Without in
validating our own celebration, he
said, everyone must remember that
"our celebration has caused a lot of
suffering."
Finsten said that there is a lot of
excitement about discussion with
Arab-American and Muslim student
groups. However, he said, "This was
not designed to be a political event."
The event closed with the cut
ting of a birthday cake and the
reading of the Hatikva, the Israeli
national anthem.
