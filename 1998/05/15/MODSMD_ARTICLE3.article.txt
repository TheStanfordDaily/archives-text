### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
More than 60 people gathered yesterday in the Old
Union Courtyard to celebrate the nation's 50th birthday
with song, dance and short excerpts from speeches by for
mer Israeli leaders, such as David Ben (iurion.
The celebration of Israel's independence is an annual
event at Stanford. Tzipor Ulman, a doctoral student in
chemistry and president of the Israeli Student Organiza
tion. gave a short speech during the event. He said the cel
ebration marks "50 years of democracy and 50 years of hop
ing for peace" in the region.
The event, sponsored by Hillel, brought together stu
dents from several different Jewish organizations. Jim Fin
sten. a coterminal international policy studies student and
co-chair of the Stanford Jewish Community Relations
Council, said. "We feel very fortunate to live in a time
where there is an Israel."
"I feel that this homeland is deserved - it's much more
than a compensatory gift for what [the Jews] sulfered in the
Holocaust," said Meredith I Idler, t 'lass ol '97.
Some students were decidedly aware ol the significance
of Israeli independence for the Palestinians as well.
