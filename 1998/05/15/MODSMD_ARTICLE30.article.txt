# MONKEY WITH SHAKESPEARE?
## 
### P. Poullet-Shokair with Dr. Dax Bamberger 
In a shocking announce
ment yesterday, scientists at a
leading research university
revealed that a monkey, typ
ing on a typewriter for the
past thousand years, has final
ly written the complete works
of Shakespeare.
"Actually," Lead Scientist
Barry Boner said. "While Mr.
Bim-Bim has completed all
the sonnets, poems and
tragedies, ke is not quite fin
ished with the comedies."
Scientists are quite elated
with the discovery because it
confirms the theory that a
thousand monkeys typing on
a thousand typewriters for a
thousand years could repro
duce the works of Shake
speare.
The results, however,
were hard-earned. "Frankly, it

Burger Cheese has
rendered William
redundant...'

took us many years just to get
the conditions for the experi
ment right," says Program
Coordinator Nancy Sinatra.
In the beginning, the
Simian Shakespeare study
used a thousand monkeys but
only one typewriter.
"It was a bloody mess,"
Sinatra said. "And I don't
mean that in the British collo
quial sense. There was literally
blood everywhere. Those
monkeys fought over that
typewriter like . . . like . . . I'm
sorry. I'm a scientist. I'm not
good at analogies."
Finally, 999 more type
writers were brought in, but
tjjat only briefly alleviated the
problem. "It was quite confus
ing," Sinatra said.
"We thought for a long

time the monkeys were suffer
ing from writers block, but
one of our scientists formulat
ed the hypothesis that the
monkeys were all dead and
further experimentation,
which consisted of poking
them with sticks and crashing
cymbals in their ears, proved
this theory correct."
New monkeys were
brought in and the experi
ment began in earnest in 998
A.D. At first, an unnamed
source said, everything the
monkeys wrote was garbage.
Crime novels, screenplays,
romances, horror stories, chil
dren's books; it was all com
pletely dreadful.
But finally Mr. Bim-Bim,
who has outlived his compan
ions by about 950 years,
began producing some quality
work, and eventually wrote
the first sentence of Hamlet
which sparked within him the
creative fire that has produced
almost all of Shakespeare's
opus.
Study Director Tasty
Jowls foresees a future in
which everyone will have their

very own writing monkey.
"The possibilities for its
use are endless. Well, not end
less in the true sense of the
word, but endless in the sense
that I am going to make a
whole lot of money. You could
have a monkey write all your
Christmas cards, correspon
dence and shopping lists. If

'Monkeys could
very well be eat
ing my ear.'

you're a novelist you could get
a monkey to write your next
book! Why, I know scientists
who are doing incredible
things with lawyer rats, politi
cal aardvarks, musician sloths,
crime-fighting bats . . . soon
animals will be doing all our
work!"
Ground zero of this liter
ary explosion remains quite
unperturbed by all the
hoopla.
Mr. Bim-Bim sits in his
cube, typing the day away,
occasionally applying Vaseline
to his ankle to ease the
chaffing where the chain that

keeps him locked to his desk
is attached.
Scientists report that Mr.
Bim-Bim is a good sport
about the whole thing. Scien
tist Steely Dan said, "He's
only twice defecated on the
typewriter. He used to be
worse, but after the death of
Mr. Chuckles, who seemed to
be Mr. Bim-Bim's chief rival,
he really settled into some
good writing." It was during
this period leading up to the
Shakespearean redux that Mr.
Bim-Bim wrote the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel I Elimi
nate On Your Mother, and
countless other critically
acclaimed essays and musings.
The head reviewer for The
New York Times Book
Review once said of Mr. Bim-
Bim,"He has a wonderful
command of the English lan
guage, and yet, in spite of this,
his essays often wander off
into pages of misspellings,
horrible punctuation, bad
grammar, questionable word
choice, and oddly stained
paper. All quite refreshing,
actually."
Dr. Harry Jewels was also
quite delighted by the discov
ery. "This proves that the var
ious theories about Bacon
writing Shakespeare's plays is a
bunch of hooey. Logically, if
Mr. Bim-Bim is writing the
complete works of Shake
speare, it then follows that he
is writing only what Shake
speare wrote, and thus what
Bacon did not write."
Dr. Jewels is chair of liter
ary criticism at the university
where the study took place,
and has spent most of his
career attempting to prove
that neither Bacon, nor any
other meat product, wrote
Shakespeare's plays.

despite all. I will not have read a list of 84 unfunny
statements for naught.
90. I'm so close, I can feel it. Something funny ahead, there
must be.
98.1 passed a corpse. I think of Elaine at home, waiting for
me. I have gone so far, I am tired, so tired.
99.1 could turn back now, but what if the last one is so
monumentally funny that it changes everything?
100. Not funny.
