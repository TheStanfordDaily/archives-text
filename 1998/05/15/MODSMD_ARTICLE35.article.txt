# Grad schools recruiting more minority students
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
Three years after School of Hu
manities and Sciences Dean John
Shoven announced expanded pro
grams to recruit and retain graduate
underrepresented minority stu
dents, programs are functioning
well, according to various school ad
ministrators.
Shoven announced this new
focus on minority graduate students
in his 1995 State of the School ad
dress. Efforts have been made since
1994 to increase the number of mi
nority applicants to graduate pro
grams campus-wide and to ensure
that these students are well support
ed once at Stanford.
Beginning in 1994, the Academic
Enhancement Program was started
by the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. attempting to improve the ex
perience of graduate minority stu
dents. The program is specifically fo
cused on highlighting the academic
achievements of underrepresented
minority graduate students through
forums, presentations and group di
alogues. Students are given opportu
nities throughout the school year to
present their work.
The school, under the direction
of Geneva Lopez, also recruits mi
nority students aggressively through
various programs that have been
created since 1995.
"This year we had an excellent
yield rate," Lopez said. "Seventy
percent of our minority admits de
cided to come to our programs in the
humanities and sciences.... That's
our highest yield in history."
Lopez said that she. student
representatives of the graduate
school and various professors at
tend conferences throughout the
nation to talk to prospective grad
uate students. Examples of such
conferences are the National Con
ference of Black Physics Students
and the Society for Advancement
of Chicano and Native Americans
in Science.
The school also holds a special
Graduate Diversity Admit Week
end every spring to talk to prospec
tive students. This year, the confer
ence took place in April and has
been a positive addition to recruit

ment rates over the past few years.
The school also attracts students
through mass mailings and advertis
ing, Lopez said.
Other schools, such as the School
of Medicine and the Law School,
have also made special efforts since
Shoven's address to recruit and re
tain minority graduate students.
Tim Westergren. diversity coor
dinator for medical students in grad
uate affairs, mentioned that the
number of applicants in the Medical
School's doctoral program has in
creased dramatically since 1994.
doubling from 24 to 52 out of 9(X) ap
plicants in 1997.
The number of students admitted
and enrolled however, has stayed
fairly constant. Westergren empha
sized that the enrollment rate is diffi
cult to increase since graduate stu
dents have to consider many factors,
such as the cost of housing and qual
ity of life, when deciding whether to
come to Stanford.
Retention rates, according to
Westergren, are sometimes low be
cause of the added pressures of
being a minority in the intensive
graduate program that Stanford offers.
"The department has to commit
itself to making sure students get
through the first year or two here,"
he said. "Retention rates really lie
with the faculty. The labs have to be
supportive."
The involvement of the gradu
ate-aimed ethnic centers on campus
also play a role in situating Stanford
graduates to the community.
The Black Graduate Student
Program, the Chicano / Latino
Graduate Student program and the
Stanford Native American Gradu
ate Student Group work through the
ethnic centers on campus and pro
vide a support system for students.
"The ethnic groups are a great
way for graduate students to meet
their colleagues from other de
partments and other professors."
Lopez said. "It's a great opportu
nity for them."
Minority students, during the
1997-98 school year made up 22.3
percent of those enrolled in the
Stanford graduate programs, ac
cording to Paddy McGowan, di
rector of research at the Regis
trar's Office.
