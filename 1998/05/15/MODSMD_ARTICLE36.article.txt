# Neighboring schools stack up in number of drug arrests
## 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
In a survey of campus drug ar
rests conducted by the Chronicle of
Higher Education, neighboring
UC-Berkeley was first with 193,
San Jose State University reported
160, while Stanford's arrests re
mained relatively low.
Stanford reported 33 drug-relat
ed crimes in 1997, tripling from
19%. Out of 500 schools surveyed
nationally, Stanford ranked in the
bottom half.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer thinks Stanford's rural
location accounts for its smaller
number of arrests.
"Both San Jose State and
Berkeley are in downtown, metro
politan areas. 'Beserkly' has always
been known for its radical element
and accompanying drug counter
culture, while the area surrounding
San Jose State is one of the top 10
places that one should avoid at all
costs," Niemeyer said.
"Especially after dark, what
with hordes of homeless people,
dopers, pushers, prostitutes and
halfway house' residents."
Elise Lenox, director of alcohol
and drug prevention at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, agreed. "Most
arrests at Stanford are not students
but stray people and travelers from
urban settings."
According to Lenox, drug of

fenders are often caught at large,
on-campus events like football
games and concerts.
Lenox also said she thinks larger
state schools approach drug of
fenders differently than Stanford.
"Some police departments give
drug offenders the option of going
to jail or going to school. Students
who opt to go to school may bring
their drug habit along, and 1 think
we see this more at San Jose State
and Berkeley," she said.
Officials at San Jose State and
UC-Berkeley are quick to respond
to suggestions that drug use is
prevalent on their campuses. Sgt.
Joe Hernandez of the San Jose
State Police Department said.
"The majority of those arrested for

drug use by the San Jose State Uni
versity Police are nonassociates of
the university. Of the 162 arrests in
1997, only two were of students."
Hernandez also noted that San
Jose State includes drunk driving
arrests in its count of drug-related
offenses. Seventy-seven of the 162
drug arrests were for drunk driving.
Dawn Finch, public information
officer for University Health Ser
vices at Berkeley, noted that UC-
Berkeley owns a large part of the
city of Berkeley where students
don't frequent.
"Most of our arrests are in cam
pus-owned areas where people not
associated with the university are
arrested by campus police," Finch
said.

Drug arrests rose by 5 percent in
1997 at universities across the
country, according to the ("hronicle
survey. The institutions with the
highest arrest numbers were large,
public universities with police de
partments empowered to make ar
rests. Many small schools use only
campus security guards to enforce
regulations on campus.
Nevertheless, a small number ol
arrests does not necessarily mean
that a college is drug- and alcohol
free.
According to Hernandez, many
schools prefer to send offenders —
especially those with an otherwise
clean record — through counseling
or campus judiciary, rather than ar
rest them.
