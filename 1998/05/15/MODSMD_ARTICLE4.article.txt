## Fac Sen hears report on hiring of women faculty 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
A contentious discussion in the
Faculty Senate yesterday followed
two reports presented on women (ac
uity by a team of female professors
and one by Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
The six professors presenting the
report titled " The Status of Women
on the Stanford Faculty" contended
that Stanford lags far behind the
available pool in both the hiring and
promotion of women.
"Gender equity can be defined as
representation proportional to the
pool, and we're well below the rate of
even the 19K5 pool." said Sociology
Prof. C eeilia Ridgeway. one of the re
port's authors.
Currently, women compose IK
percent of Stanford faculty and 13
percent of tenured faculty.
Rice, while acknowledging possi
ble concern over hiring levels, \ocit
erously defended the University
tenure promotion rates and policies
which do not take affirmative actio!
into account.
"There is no tenure rate differen
tial between men and women. Rio

said.l his problem is more ol a per
ception than a realit\
"1 am completely opposed to affir
mative action at the time of tejiure as
a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we vu>uld be very
sorry to go down."
Rice added that the University
will continue to follow affirmative ac
tion policies in hiring.
The report's authors and several
female faculty members contended
that affirmative action is necessary
during the time of tenure considera
tion to overcome unconscious biases.
"Policies that are race-blind or
gender-blind may reinforce these bi
ases." said History Prof. Estelle
Freedman. one of the report's au
thors "Affirmative action d(x.-sn't re
quire the lowering of academic stan
dards."
Both parties agreed, however
that the primary area ot concern i:
the hiring of women, not the promo
tion of women.
"When we do our hiring, we'r
oversampling from one gender pot
and undersampling from another.
