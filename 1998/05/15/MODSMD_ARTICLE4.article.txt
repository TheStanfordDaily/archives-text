## Fac Sen hears report on hiring of women faculty 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
A contentious discussion in the
Faculty Senate yesterday followed
two reports presented on women (ac
uity by a team of female professors
and one by Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
The six professors presenting the
report titled " The Status of Women
on the Stanford Faculty" contended
that Stanford lags far behind the
available pool in both the hiring and
promotion of women.
"Gender equity can be defined as
representation proportional to the
pool, and we're well below the rate of
even the 19K5 pool." said Sociology
Prof. C eeilia Ridgeway. one of the re
port's authors.
Currently, women compose IK
percent of Stanford faculty and 13
percent of tenured faculty.
Rice, while acknowledging possi
ble concern over hiring levels, \ocit
erously defended the University
tenure promotion rates and policies
which do not take affirmative actio!
into account.
"There is no tenure rate differen
tial between men and women. Rio

said.l his problem is more ol a per
ception than a realit\
"1 am completely opposed to affir
mative action at the time of tejiure as
a matter of principle. It would be a
slippery slope that we vu>uld be very
sorry to go down."
Rice added that the University
will continue to follow affirmative ac
tion policies in hiring.
The report's authors and several
female faculty members contended
that affirmative action is necessary
during the time of tenure considera
tion to overcome unconscious biases.
"Policies that are race-blind or
gender-blind may reinforce these bi
ases." said History Prof. Estelle
Freedman. one of the report's au
thors "Affirmative action d(x.-sn't re
quire the lowering of academic stan
dards."
Both parties agreed, however
that the primary area ot concern i:
the hiring of women, not the promo
tion of women.
"When we do our hiring, we'r
oversampling from one gender pot
and undersampling from another.
Rkh>L'\\a\ said
The faculty report also stressed
the difference in hiring practices be
tween departments.
"Over one-third of the depart
ments in engineering have never
hired a woman, hut what is really sur
prising is that the same thing is true in
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences," Ridgeway said.
Rice agreed that certain areas of
the University have done better at
hiring female faculty than others. She
specifically cited the Graduate
Sch(X)l of Business and the School of
Medicine for their increases in
women faculty. The Business School
has doubled its amount of women
faculty, to 15 percent, in the past five
years. Rice also stressed that Stan
ford is comparable with other univer
sities in its percentage of female faculty.
"When you compare our law
school to other top law sch(X)ls. our
engineering school to other engineer
ing schix)ls, our percentages are simi
lar to everyone else's." she said.
Ridgeway contended, however,
that this was not enough.

"We want Stanford to show moral
leadership in this area in the same
way that we show intellectual leader
ship in the academic world," she said.
Itie writers of both reports also
cited Stanford's low faculty turnover
rate as one factor behind the small
number of female faculty.
"Because this Stanford faculty is
quite stable, the current faculty com
position is a historical imprint," Rice
said. "It's a simple math problem: a
slow-moving numerator and a slow
moving denominator means a slow
moving total."
University President Gerhard
Casper emphasized the highly
charged legal and political climate
under which this issue comes to light.
"Proposition 2()9 has made life
more difficult for all of us." he said.
The senate passed a resolution
recommitting itself to gender equi
ty and promising to report yearly
on the progress of female hiring
and promotion.
The senate also renewed the pro
grams in Latin American Studies and
African and Afro-American Studies
and appointed Statistics Prof. Brad
Efron as president of next year's Fac
ulty Senate.
