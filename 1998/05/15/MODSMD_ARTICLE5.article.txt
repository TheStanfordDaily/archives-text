# Row changes financial manager policy
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
In light of concerns about the financial security of Row
house bank accounts, the Row Housing Office has issued
a set of requirements for financial managers of student
run houses. The requirements come on the heels of the
recent arrest of senior Jeremy Smith for allegedly embez
zling money from La Casa Italiana during his tenure as fi
nancial manager.
Laurette Beeson, assistant director for student man
agement. formulated the new requirements with the input
of current financial managers. The new regulations in
clude suggestions for smoother operation of financial

transactions.
"When I came into my current position two years ago.
there were lots of potential problems with a unique sys
tem. and | Ann Porteus and I] wanted to implement more
safety nets for Row houses." Beeson said.
"During winter quarter, I met with all of the financial
managers on the Row and got lots of ideas from them.
( here was clearly a lot of room for mismanagement by fi
nancial managers, whether intentional or sloppy, she
said.
Junior Alex Teekell, current financial manager of Sla
vianskii Dom, said. "This year, more so than last year. be-
cause of the La Casa Italiana inci
dent. the Row Housing Office has
gotten more hands-on in the financial
manager position."
Teekell said that previously, the
Row office took more of a laissez
faire attitude toward the financial
manager position, imparting a great
deal of trust to the financial managers
of Row houses to do their jobs hon
estly and correctly.
Up to this time, student-run hous
es have essentially run their financial
operations as they wished, as long as
they reported back to the Row office
and the house bills were being paid.
Senior Amanda Bardin, the cur
rent financial manager of La Casa

Italiana, said, "Accountability varies
a bit from house to house. Some
houses have excellent systems; others
have systems that need to be worked
on."
The new requirements, which go
into effect beginning fall quarter next
year, do not represent a drastic
change for the role the financial man
agers will play in Row houses.
Beeson said that much of the Row
is already operating with some or
most of the suggestions on the new
guidelines, and the new guidelines
merely formalize the procedure for
more uniformity in the way things are
run.
"We wanted to be more explicit
about what we wanted from financial
managers," Beeson said.
Some of the key requirements in
clude requiring that financial man

agers have canceled checks returned
with bank statements; requiring the
house, kitchen and financial man
agers to have signature authorization
on the house bank account; and man
dating that financial managers must
have deposit-only ATM cards.
Houses will also be required to use
the Quickbooks program as their ac
counting software. The Row office
will buy and provide the software as
well as hands-on training for using it
effectively.
Beeson said that the software re
quirement was to help ensure a more
uniform approach for all financial
managers. "Automation makes it
much easier to give reports to the
house," she said. This way, students
can easily see where their money is
going.
The Row office is also mandating

that each house run an internal quar
terly audit, in which a member of the
house other than the financial man
ager review and verily the financial
manager's statements, reports and
receipts.
In addition, the Row office will re
serve the right to do external audits to
ensure that the guidelines are being
followed.
"Hopefully, knowing that some
body's watching them will make il
harder to embezzle money for ex
tended periods of time," Beeson said.
"I also hope that, by increasing inter
nal accountability, houses will be able
to audit themselves. The financial
manager position is meant to be edu
cational. and if they are developing
future leadership potential, then the
financial managers need to run the
houses like a legitimate business."
