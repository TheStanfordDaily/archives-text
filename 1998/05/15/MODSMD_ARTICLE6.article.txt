Senior Jeremy Smith, t he former La Casa Italiana fi
nancial manager accused of embezzling about $23,000.
wai\ his right to a preliminar\ court hearing in the
Palo Alto Municipal Court on I uesda\
Preliminary court hearings determine whether
there is enough evidence for a full trial to take place.
Court records indicate that Smith used the funds for
many expenses unconnected to La
Casa Italiana, including an unex
plained $3,()(X) check, a $750 pur
chase from GTE Mobilnet and sev
eral purchases from Bachelor Books,
a pornography shop in Redwood
City.
According to court documents,
there was $11,485 in the house's
Wells Fargo bank account when
Smith was hired as financial manager

in January 1997.
He remained in the position until
June, when he was placed on acade
mic suspension.
Smith's academic standing made
him ineligible to live in the house any
longer, and his tenure as financial
manager ended. However, because
Smith chose to appeal his suspen
sion. he remained in control of the
house's accounts through the sum
mer. When Smith's name was finally
removed from the house's bank ac
count in October 1997, the account
balance was $165.

Current La Casa Italiana financial
manager, senior Amanda Hardin,
noticed the abnormality and asked
the Stanford Police to investigate.
Court records say that Smith was
somewhat aware of the investigation
hut that investigators tried to remain
discreet to prevent him from leaving
the area. In an April \b report, inves
tigators wrote: "Smith's ... future at
Stanford is still uncertain, therefore
his ties to the Bay Area are question
able."
According to the police investiga
tion report. "There appears to be no

reasonable explanation why Smith
should have legitimately spent over
$11.500 / quarter above estimated
operating expenses during the two
quarters he was financial manager."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said that Smith's case
began several months ago. after
Bardin reported that Smith had re
fused to turn over the house ac
counts.
Smith — who posted his $ 1 (K).(KK)
bail on May 9 after spending three
days in the Santa Clara County Jail
— is scheduled to give a plea May 28.
