In the last of a series of lectures at Stan
lord. Bill Bradley called on Americans to re
examine their role in a global context in light
of America's status as a dominant world
power.
The speech was the fourth in a series given
by Bradley, this year's Payne Distinguished
Lecturer at the Institute for International
Studies. Bradley, the former I J.S. Senator for
New Jersey and basketball player for the New
York Knicks, focused the lecture series on the
theme. " Thoughts for a New Century: Amer
ica's Role in the World."
In this final speech entitled "In Search of a
New American Narrative." Bradley recalled
each generation's need for a redefinition of
what it is to be American and emphasized that
the current generation's need for redefinition
is equally great, given the current state of
world affairs.
"For all of these reasons, our times are full
of promise and fraught with uncertainty....
The world has arrived at another new begin
ning." he said.
Bradley identified five new international
realities that have fundamentally altered the
state of world affairs. These realities — rang
ing from the lack of a clear division between
domestic and international policies to the
emergence of democracies as the dominant
world powers have given the United States
a great opportunity. Bradley said.
"The United States has tremendous power
but no enemy in the world. We can be a friend
ol all and an enemy of none," he said.
Bradley cautioned, however, that the

United States should be guided by certain
principles in its attempt to take a new position
in world affairs.
By acknowledging the legitimacy of
human security as a goal to protect America's
territorial integrity, these principles should
govern the application of foreign policy, en
suring America's ability to aid worldwide de
velopment. Bradley said.
The absence of American leadership in
implementing these guiding principles could
have disastrous consequences. Bradley
warned.
"If America relinquished a belief in the
possibility of progress, then freedom s flame
could be snuffed out. and progress would take
a nose dive."
Setting out six objectives for American
foreign policy. Bradley emphasized the spe
eial role of the United States in the world.
Citing examples such as U.S. efforts to
achieve a dialogue between Taiwan and
China or between Turkey and Greece.
Bradley said the I 'nited States has a "unique
role as a broker of peace."
Using this role, the I 'nited States should
focus on cultivating the right relationship with
today's five major powers — China, (ier
many. Japan. Mexico and Russia, Bradley
said.
"These countries are the only countries
with the economic and technological interests
to threaten our interests." he said.
Concluding his speech. Bradle\ told his
audience to keep t heir perspective focused on
the larger picture.
"We need to know whatwi are lor. not just
what we are against.. .We need a vindica
tion of more than just our own
