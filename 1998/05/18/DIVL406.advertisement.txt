HEEDED!
Unique way to help childless,
otherwise blessed, warm couple.
Our dream is: s'B" or taller,
slender, Nordic type (since we
are), demonstrated intelligence,
excellent health, age 21-31.
Although our gratitude cannot
be measured in dollars, if we
were in your shoes, the least we
would expect is:
$5,000 plus expenses
