This is just a sampling of what you could buy with the $1200 of
Coffee House gift certificates that will be awarded to the
CoHo Mural Contest
The CoHo will be undergoing a major remodel over the summer
and we'll reopen with an updated look, revised menu and one
student's mural across the main wall.
You'll apply your artistic vision and talent to the CoHo walls the
first week in September.
We'll supply you with $1200 worth of gift certificates to keep you
caffeinated throughout the following year, your brushes and
supplies, and our envy knowing that "we couldn't do that"
All entries must be received by 11:59 p.m., June sth.
Our unbiased but opinionated panel of judges
will announce the winner June 12.
Stop by the Coffee House for an entry form.
