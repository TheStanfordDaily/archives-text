# Jasper Ridge throws birthday party

### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Sunshine, clear skies and thousands of curious
visitors greeted yesterday's historic opening of the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve to the general
public.
Yesterday's opening, or "Jasper Ridge Discov
ery Day," marked the first time in the history of the
preserve that it has heen opened to the public. In
general, because of its status as a preserve, the area
is open only to researchers and small groups of visi
tors led by docents.
And by most accounts it was a success.
Palo Alto resident Mary Carlstead, a first-time
visitor to the preserve, remarked on the area's
beauty as she sat in the sunshine near a lake.
"This is a pristine jewel," she said. "It's like
opening up the crown jewels and going to see it be
cause you may not get another chance."
The day, designed to celebrate the 25th anniver
sary of the preserve, offered visitors a chance to
take a walking tour of 24 natural history exhibits,
chat with docents or simply absorb the beauty of the
area.
Visitors to the preserve ranged from young chil
dren to guests, who remembered the area's earlier
history as a recreation area before it was designated
as a preserve in 1973.
"I've seen a lot of people who used to come
here," said Bob Dodge, a doeent for the preserve.
