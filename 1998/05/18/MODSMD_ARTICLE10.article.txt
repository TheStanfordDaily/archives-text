### 
NEW DELHI, India (AP) â€”
Now that India says it has the abili
ty to produce a nuclear bomb, it is
perfecting missiles to carry one, the
government's top nuclear scientist
said yesterday.
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam told
reporters India was working to
increase the range of its Agni mis
sile. Testing of the Agni was sus
pended two years ago but is expect
ed to resume soon.
Agni is believed to have a range
of 1,550 miles, enough to reach
Shanghai or Beijing. India has said
it needs a nuclear defense against
China, also a nuclear state, and
neighboring Pakistan.
"We are now working on the
next version of Agni," Kalam, top
scientific adviser to India's defense
minister, said at a packed news con
ference in New Delhi.
He was flanked by three other
top scientists who organized last
week's five nuclear explosions, less
than a month after receiving gov
ernment orders to do so.
The tests, followed by India's
declaration that it is capable of pro
ducing a bomb, set off a storm of
international criticism.
Yesterday, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub told the
Associated Press his country had
decided to go ahead with testing a
nuclear device in retaliation.
The Agni. the centerpiece of
India's $3(K) million missile pro
gram, was test-fired three times.
India has also tested a short
range ballistic missile. Prithvi. which
can target Pakistani cities within 95
miles. The Prithvi has been tested
16 times.
India and Pakistan have fought
three wars since 1948 and still
engage in frequent border skir
mishes.
