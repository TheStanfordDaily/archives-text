ISLAMABAD. Pakistan (AP)
Pakistan will test a nuclear
device in response to India's five
explosions despite earlier assur
ances to U.S. officials that no such
decision had been made, Pak
istan's foreign minister said yester
day.
Other Pakistani officials and a
top U.S. envoy continued to deny
that the leadership had agreed on
whether to conduct its own tests. A
U.S. delegation left Pakistan on
Saturday saying the government
had indicated no "final or irrevoca
ble" decision had been made.
But Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub said yesterday that Pak
istan's position had since hardened,
sending the strongest signal yet that
his country is ready to match India
in kind.
"It's a matter of when, not if,
Pakistan will test. The decision has
already been taken by Cabinet."
Ayub told the Associated Press in a
telephone interview from his rural
home in northwestern Pakistan.

"We have taken in view every
thing and discussed what it will
cost us and we will go ahead." he
said.
Pakistan has said its decision
hinges on how hard the interna
tional community cracks down on
India for its detonation of the
underground nuclear devices last
Monday and Wednesday.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said yesterday that Pakistan
needs only 12 hours of preparation
to explode a nuclear device.
"We will be forced to test ...
and no one can stop us from doing
so." if the international communi
ty's response to India is weak, he
told reporters outside his home in
the Punjab provincial capital of
Lahore.
Sharif did not say whether the
government had decided on tests.
On Friday, he told a U.S. delega
tion led by Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott that Pakistan
was in no hurry to conduct nuclear
tests.
