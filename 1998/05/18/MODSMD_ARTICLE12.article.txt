BIRMINGHAM, England (AP)
Beset once more by threats of a
nuclear arms race, leaders of the
world's most powerful nations
ended their annual summit yester
day with a plea to Pakistan not to
respond in kind to India's five nucle
ar explosions.
President Clinton called the tests
"a nutty way to go" and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair
described "a sense of frustration" as
Pakistan signaled it would conduct
its own test blast.
Gloom over the nuclear-testing
confrontation in south Asia domi
nated the weekend summit, so much
so that when an inaccurate rumor of
a Pakistani test swept through Birm

ingham it drew uncharacteristic
comment from several leaders.
Despite disagreements over
imposing economic sanctions on
India, the leaders appeared to find
common ground elsewhere.
In a final communique, they
pledged to step up efforts to provide
debt relief so that all the world's
poorest nations will qualify for spe
cial assistance by the year 2(XX), and
sounded united over environmental
targets.
"Of course we did not go as far as
many would have liked us to go ...
but I think we did make very con
siderable progress," Blair, referring
to debt relief, told reporters at the
close of the Group of Eight meet

ings.
The leaders insisted on demand
ing economic reforms and evidence
of official probity in exchange for
aid. "The most important thing is to
convince our people that if more
money is going, it is going to benefit
those countries directly," Blair said.
Clinton gave Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, admitted for the first
time fully to the group, his G-K lapel
pin as a memento of the event, and
most others made a point of praising
him,
Clinton also weighed in on Blair's
most immediate challenge â€” a refer
endum Friday in Northern Ireland
on a peace accord providing for
Protestant-Catholic power-sharing.

Clinton made two big appeals in
TV interviews for a yes vote on the
agreement, brokered by the British
and Irish governments.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott arrived here from Pakistan
empty-handed, unable to extract
even a half-promise from Pakistani
leaders not to match neighboring
India's nuclear tests.
Talbott depicted the Pakistanis
as wrestling with an lonely problem,
and told reporters, "We shall just
have to wait and see."
Reflecting the new tensions. Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto both said they'd heard
what later turned out to be false

rumors of a Pakistani test explosion
yesterday morning.
The fear of where it aJI might
lead was pervasive.
"The answer is not for India to
become a nuclear power, and then
for Pakistan to match it stride for
stride, and then for China to he
brought in ... and for Russia to
come in and to recreate in a differ
ent context the conflicts of the cold
war." C linton said in a BBC inter
view.
However. Russia. France. Ger-
Italy and Britain blocked
efforts by the United States. Canada
and Japan to get a coordinated pro
gram of economic embargoes
against India.
