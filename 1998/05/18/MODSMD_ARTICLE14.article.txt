# Microsoft breaks off talks and ships out new software
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
lung-awaited courtroom collision
between the government and
Microsoft appeared imminent yes
terday. with the Justice Department
and at least 20 states set to file
antitrust suits today that could
change how consumers buy and use
most computers.
With negotiations stalled, the
world's most powerful software
company has said it will go ahead
and ship today to computer makers
the latest upgrade of its flagship
software. Windows 98. The compa
ny had planned to ship the package
on Friday, but agreed last week to
delay its release until today, pend
ing the outcome of talks.
Eleventh-hour negotiations col
lapsed Saturday over what
Microsoft described as the govern
ment's "unreasonable demands,"

including a condition that the com
pany put a copy of rival Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Internet
browser in every copy of Windows,
the operating system used to run
virtually all desktop computers.
"I do sometimes shake my head
and wonder why this is happening. I
just don't understand." Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates told Time
Magazine. "We worked hard to set
tle. I wish we had been able to. I'll
seize every opportunity to do so."
One government official said
yesterday that Microsoft "absolute
ly refused any meaningful conces
sions at the end of the day."
The Justice Department and the
states believe Microsoft is using its
market dominance with Windows
to illegally stifle competition in
other parts of the computer indus
try. especially the fiercely competi

tive market for Internet browsers,
the software people use to view
information on the World Wide
Web.
Two government officials
involved in the negotiations said
independently yesterday that
Microsoft withdrew a major conces
sion it had made earlier in the week,
which would have given computer
makers more freedom in choosing
the screen that consumers see when
they first turn on the computer.
"The Microsoft negotiators said
Bill Gates had rethought it and now
said that Bill Gates wouldn't discuss
it." one government official said.
" That was the tenor of the talks....
It was the total refusal on
Microsoft's part to yield meaning
fully. There was no question that
they agreed to do some things and
then reneged."
