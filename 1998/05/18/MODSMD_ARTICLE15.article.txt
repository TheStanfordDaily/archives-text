# Investigating donations to the Democratic Party
## Justice Department questions American policy toward China 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Clinton welcomed an investiga
tion into whether he improperly
signed a waiver in 1996 to approve
exporting satellite technology to
China. He said yesterday the deci
sion was not swayed by six-figure
donations from an executive who
benefited.
But the Justice Department has
opened a preliminary inquiry into
possible influence on the president's
decision of more than $GU).O(X) in
donations to the Democratic Party
by Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman
of Loral Space and Communica
tions Ltd., a government official
said. The export waiver covered
Loral and another company.
Speaking in Birmingham. Eng

land. where he was attending the
economic summit of world leaders.
Clinton said he had heard about the
new allegations but insisted the
money did not change the United
States' China policy.
"All foreign policy decisions, we
made in the interest of the Ameri
can people," the president said.
"If someone tried to influence
them (decisions), that is a different
issue. There ought to be an investi
gation." he said.
India's nuclear tests, and the pos
sibility that Pakistan and a regional
nuclear arms race might follow, also
are heightening congressional inter
est in the subject.
Investigations are gearing up in
both the House and the Senate into

the administration's decision to let
Loral and Hughes Electronic Corp.
export satellites to he launched atop
Chinese roekets.
Critics claim that, along with the
satellites, the two space firms gave
China technology that helped it
improve guidance systems of its
long-range ballistic missiles, includ
ing some aimed at the United States.
China and India are longtime rivals
and fought a border war three
decades ago.
Republicans see their investiga
tion into the waiver as a political
winner this summer. They hope to
tie the contracts to big campaign
donations that Schwartz and other
executives of both firms made to
Democrats.
