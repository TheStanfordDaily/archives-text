Law School must listen to
students and faculty on
military recruiting question

IN 19%, CONGRESS approved
legislation that threatens with
drawal of federal funds — includ
ing some student financial aid — from
law schools that do not allow the mili
tary to recruit students on its premises.
Stanford Law School is one of them.
The Law School has a policy of
opening facilities only to employers
who do not discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation, among a num
ber of protected categories. In this
case, the military's "Don't ask, don't
tell" approach to gay and lesbian per
sonnel may violate this policy.
As the Law School's administration
ponders its options for coping with the
federal law, we hope that its decision
will be guided primarily by the values
of students and faculty, not by finan
cial considerations.
So far, it has been able to avoid
deciding whether the military even
violates the law school's policy. Last
year, recruiting interviews were held
at the Career Planning and Placement
Center, which is technically not a law
school facility.
If the military is not satisfied with
this arrangement, difficult choices will
have to be made. Whatever the even
tual outcome, we urge the administra
tion to pursue an open and inclusive
decision-making process.
It is crucial for the Law School to
consider the views of students along
with those of the faculty. As we
learned during last year's controversy
over possible ROTC classes on cam
pus, student opinion is not likely to be

homogeneous. While some deplore
the military's treatment of gays and
lesbians and argue that it has no place
at Stanford, others believe that the
armed forces deserve a stronger pres
ence on campus.
Of course, by giving students and
faculty a strong voice in setting the
policy toward the military, the admin
istration would have to accept one
possibility — the Law School's com
munity may in fact urge that the
armed forces be banned from recruit
ing on its premises. This, in turn, could
lead to a loss of government funding
as mandated by a federal law called
the Solomon Amendment.
We do not suggest that the jeopar
dized funds — estimates of the
amount range from several hundred
thousand to a million dollars — are
negligible. Absorbing such losses
would not be easy, but it should not be
catastrophic. Despite passage of the
Solomon Amendment, at least one
other law school. New York Universi
ty, has already taken a stand against
allowing the military to recruit on its
campus.
The precise consequences for the
Law School of violating the Solomon
Amendments (and the degree of vigi
lance with which they are enforced)
are uncertain. The law may even face
a challenge in the courts on constitu
tional grounds. For the time being,
then, some of the decisions might be
more strategic then principled.
Still, the Law School's students
and faculty should be the leading
voices in resolving the tensions
between the military's policies and
the school's anti-discrimination regu
lations. If they choose a principled
position against military recruitment,
the Law School administration
should follow their lead.
