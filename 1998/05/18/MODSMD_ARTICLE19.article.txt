## Parting wishes: positive change 
### 
AS MY TIME at
Stanford draws
to a close, it is
easy for me to get nostal
gic and sentimental about
the Farm. But before I
leave. I want to give the
administration some ideas
about how to improve the

place. Here are 10 suggestions in no partic
ular order:
1. Tenure and Diversity: As is clear from
several cases in the last few years, the
tenure system needs to be revamped. The
University must be clear about its expecta
tions, recognize harassment and pressure
facing junior faculty, and form a system
which more justly recognizes outstanding
scholars and teachers. The University must
also increase the number of top administra
tors and professors who are women, people
of color, disabled and queer. These minori
ties must be truly committed to change and
equality.
2. Housing: With rising property and
rental prices, it is increasingly difficult to
find affordable housing in the area. Stan
ford built Lyman Hall and Schwab Resi
dential Center, but we need much more
housing for graduate students, as well as for
staff and faculty. This year the crunch has
also affected undergraduates, many whom
remain unhoused or live in converted study
and recreation rooms.
3. Investment responsibility: Nike, a
major sponsor of the Athletics Department,

recently announced plans to improve its
treatment of workers in Southeast Asia.
This is a small first step. We must think crit
ically about whose money is supporting this
institution, and who we are supporting by
investing our endowment in their ventures.
What atrocities are we complicit in?
4. Community service: Most students at
Stanford don't know how to apply what
they learn to the real world. I propose a
mandatory service learning curriculum
requirement for all undergraduates. People
could work in schools, community organi
zations and local governments. This might
give us an idea of how the majority of
Americans live.
5. Alumni membership: I was surprised
to learn that after four years and $120,000.1
still have to pay $350 to become a member
of the Stanford Alumni Association. If I
don't pay the money, I'll lose touch with my
alma mater. Why should I have to pay to
become an official alumnus? What about
people on financial aid who can't afford to
pay? Haven't we given enough?
6. Academic integrity: There are so
many intelligent and hard-working people
here that it is unfair to assign grades accord
ing to the "bell curve" model, which is
based on a random population. However, I
still feel that high grades are often unde
servedly given out. I understand a generous
B, but an undeserved A is much harder to
justify.
Also, many undergraduates abuse the
incomplete policy and hand in assignments

months and even years after they are due.
This is unfair to professors and students who
finish on time. Waivers should only be given
in genuinely extenuating circumstances.
7. Support the arts: Stanford has both
super-funded departments and under-fund
ed ones. The administration must increase
support by hiring more professors and
artists, improving facilities, increasing grad
uate aid and moving away from the attitude
that science is the only subject of value.
8. Post office: Every day, a line extends
outside the building. Stanford should push
the government to provide the requisite
facilities and staff to meet the needs of our
community. The post office should fill every
counter position during rush times, supply
express lines for stamp buying, questions
and form pick-ups. It should also provide
more lockers for packages.
9. Marguerite: The hours have already
been extended this year. This is great, but
they should be expanded later into the night
and especially to the weekends, so that peo
ple without cars can get off campus more
easily.
10. Parking: This is particularly problem
atic for people who live off campus. Some
people come to campus several hours early
so they can find a spot. We have so much
unused land along Palm Drive and west
campus; why not building a new six-story
parking structure?
