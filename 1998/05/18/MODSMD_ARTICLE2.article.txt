# Scant progress in postal negotiations

Representatives of the University
and the postal service will soon dis
cuss the latter's latest proposal re
garding the status of the campus post
office.

Ever since the 1995 expiration of a
35-year lease between Stanford Man
agement Company and the post of
fice, both parties have been negotiat
ing a new lease every month for the
current post office site.
"The problem [with the negotia
tions] is that the University has high

er priorities than the post office," said
Norma Jellison. real estate manager
of the Pacific Facilities Service Office.
The office deals with leases and ac
quisitions for all post offices in Cali
fornia and Hawaii. Stanford's seismic
upgrade project, she said, has taken
precedence over the search for a new

on-campus post office site.
"The University originally said.
'We can't concentrate on finding a
site for another five years," " Jellison
said.
Although the long-term goal of
the post office is to move to a new site
chosen by the University, post office
negotiators say the more immediate
goal is to sign a lease for its present
location in White PI a/a. The current
month-to-month leasing pattern is
highly unstable, Jellison said.
"It's just not how we do business,"
she said.
Leonie Batkin, manager of prop
erty services at Stanford Manage
ment Company, represents the Uni
versity in the negotiations. He de
clined to comment on the points of
contention between the two parties.
With the new site, Jellison said
post office officials hope to improve
conditions for workers and the gen
eral environment for patrons. In the
present building, there is no air con
ditioning, and the walls are lined with
mailboxes that allow cold winds to
blow in during the winter, she said.
Very few universities even have
post offices on campus, Jellison
added.
