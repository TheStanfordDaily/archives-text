Abolish stereotypes
As a law student, I don't read The
Daily with much regularity. One reason is
because reading it often causes me to be
disturbed about the position of women on
this campus. Coming from a small liberal
arts college that few would describe as lib
eral, I assumed that Stanford would be
much more progressive with respect to
women's issues and that feminist voices
would be heard and valued. So far, I think
I've been wrong.
At the first football game, I was
delighted to see that Stanford had such a
talented dance team. As a four-year par
ticipant and coach of my undergraduate
dance team, I recognized how skillful
these women were and was impressed by
their stage presence and technical ability.
When I heard someone call them the
"Dollies," I thought they were kidding.
How could an institute of higher learning
in this day and age refer to a group of
women with a term that conjures up an

image of a doll? I take issue with sugges
tions that there are other connotations to
the term. The doll is a symbol used by
feminist authors to represent the stereo
typical images of women as merely having
physical value.
Since the Dollies have been around for
a long time, I can only assume that the
feminist consciousness was not present
when the group was named. But what
about now? Change the name already!!!
Perhaps a more appropriate name
would remove the sexist insinuations that
these women are anything less than mas
ters of athleticism and artistry. Dancers
may wear little clothing, but it is a func
tional requirement of the activity. I have
yet to hear anyone criticize swimmers or
track runners for being scantily clad.
Similarly, dancers need their body
motions to be visible. You would be hard
pressed to find baggy clothing on any
dancer in a performance.
I can vouch for from my years as a pro
fessional dancer. So give these women the
credit and respect they deserve, and quit

demeaning them by referring to them by
the name "Dollies."
The article on football hostesses is
equally disturbing and demonstrates the
low level of consciousness present in many
administrators. Asstistant football coach
Dave Tipton attempts to defend the insti
tution by stressing how legitimate the
hostesses' duties are.
But he does not explain why men
would not tak»* part in this activity Tf it is
truly on the "up and up." why can't serve
the exact same function as these women
do?
I do not mean to suggest that any sexu
al favors are being exchanged, but perhaps
wooing these boys with an attractive
woman is an underlying goal. By not
admitting men into this program, the ath
letic directors are tipping their hand. Why
has this program gone on for so long with
out objection?
Finally. The Daily really needs to
rethink its portrayal of women athletes. A
story on May 4 referred to the Dollies as
"sweethearts." A story on April 4 on a

first-year swimmer had the headline. ".Sit
ting Pretty." The sports article highlighted
her prom queen past and continually
returned to the image of the tiara to
describe her. Many women 1 spoke to
found that highly offensive, especially in
light of how impressive an athlete that
young woman is.
Members of the campus community —
especially women — need to speak up, not
just to each other but to the administra
tion. Let administrators know that these
demeaning stereotypes will not be tolerat
ed. 1 am tired of being silent about this. I
hope others will speak out as well.

Appreciate mean people
It appears that I have been discovered.
Mr. Charov, obviously a man who aced his
reading comprehension tests, has seen
through my false praise of Aly Remtulla's
Mav 11 column and revealed the bitter

criticism underneath (May 13). Foiled
again. But in all fairness. 1 must say,
"Kudos to you. Mr. Charov."
My only hope as you lead your minions
down the yellow brick road to worlds of
rainbows and ice cream and pillow fights
is that you remember all of us "mean peo
ple." Remember us for all the trouble we
caused, all the students we mocked, all the
alcohol we consumed.
We are the ones who make life inter
esting for the rest. Without our antics,
what would you do when it came time to
write letters and whine? You need mean
people.
