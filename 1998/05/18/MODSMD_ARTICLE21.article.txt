## Asian images: sex and interracial dating 
### 
Alda Leu

ASIAN AM ERIC AN S need an
image overhaul. Most of the
time, students don't think twice
when interracial couples walk by at Stan
ford. It happens all the time, especially in
California. But when it's an Asian female
and a white male, assumptions are made
— people question their motives for dat
ing, the dynamics of their relationship and
the self-esteem of the individuals involved.
The controversy surrounding interra
cial dating among Asian women and white
men stems from perceptions perpetrated
in the media about Asian Americans.
Personally, I am not attracted particu
larly to any one race or ethnicity. Moving
from Texas to California has helped me to
appreciate the empirical good looks of all
types of people. Nonetheless, if I happen
to be dating someone who is white, com
ments from Asian male friends suggest
disapproval.
Perhaps it's because the percentage of
Asian women dating outside their race
exceeds that of Asian men. There is the
fear that the women do it out of a self

hate.
There is the general perception from
Asian men that Asian females who date
white males are "sellouts," but when
Asian males do the same, the response is.
"Chalk one up for us." The underlying
theme is that dating a white person is
somehow more desirable.
In a recent discussion with an Asian ex
boyfriend. he joked that Asian female out
dating (dating outside the race) only both
ered him if the Asian woman was good
looking — a crude remark to say the least.
It did. however, key in on the fact that
much of dating hinges on images of beau
ty-
It's impossible to avoid the image of
beauty portrayed in the media. Tall, thin,
athletic, young — white. Asian women are
often portrayed as exotic and beautiful
and more desirable to some men due to
their "subservience" and other racist
virtues. There is always the concern that
some men have an "Asian fetish." which
implies an insulting objectification of an
entire race of women.

Asian men, on the other hand, arc por
trayed as either overly-dominant patri
archs or short, weak wimps.
The only way that suspicions about
interracial dating and its underlying
motives can he alleviated is to equalize
beauty standards.
Asian men and women need to start
taking a more active role in being positive
ly portrayed in the media. It is through the
difficult and slow process of public recog
nition that accurate representation can
occur.
The American public will start to see
Asian Americans as attractive, strong and
successful through a positive portrayal in
the media. We need to move beyond pro
files of successful businessmen to balanced
media depictions.
Jackie Chan revitalized the Asian male
in popular culture. His recent fame in
America paved the way for Chow Yun-Fat
to star with Mira Sorvino in "Replacement
Killers." which was a marginal success.
However, any suggestion of sexuality sur
rounding the male lead was removed in

the film. The same thing happened to Sid
ney Poitier during the beginning of his pio
neering career. I can only hope that some
day the calculated gambles Hollywood
took on hugely successful Hong Kong
actors will translate into more openness
toward Asian-American actors.
Breaking into the television or film
industry is especially difficult for Asian
Americans. The short-lived series "All
American Girl" starring comedian Mar
garet Cho attests to the lack of a market
for such endeavors.
Asian Americans have enough people
to create a co/y market niche and the
ethnic group, for the most part, is not char
acterized by its lack of purchasing power.
So the only problem remaining is how
to mobilize to support the efforts of Asian-
American projects. Asian Americans
should create a market for featuring
Asians in films, television shows, commer
cials and advertisements. We need to
begin by patronizing independent Asian-
American films and showing that there is
an untapped audience.

Asian-American individuals shouldn't
he dissuaded from becoming journalists,
actors or models — especially Asian-
American males. It takes the hard work of
a few pioneers to produce significant
change.
It's time the media sat up and took
notice of Asian Americans, male and
female. Only then can these images of
beauty in the media he counteracted.
Bitterness that sometimes exists with
respect to interracial dating stems from
these inihalanced perceptions of Asians
and the overriding inculcation of certain
types of people as being more attractive.
If media images were more balanced,
interracial relationships would be less
scrutinized and taken more for what they
usually are — a coupling of two compati
ble people.
