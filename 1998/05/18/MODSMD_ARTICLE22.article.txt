## Softball season ends after solid showing at regional 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
S TILLWATER, Okla. — When the dust
settles on what was its first NCAA regional
appearance, the Stanford Softball team will
have a long list of accomplishments it can be
proud of.
In addition to its first-ever postseason
berth the ninth-ranked Cardinal (41-IS) com
pleted a record-setting season with a new high
in wins and put together a third-place confer
ence finish. Individually, the Card set single
season records for RBIs, walks, strikeouts
and wins by a single pitcher.
But yesterday, the Card could only tear
fully accept the fact that its season was over
and that the group of 16 players who achieved
this record-breaking season had played their
last game together.
"One of the things people said when they
were crying after the game was, 'I wasn't cry
ing because we lost; I was crying because I'm
never going to get to play with this group of 16
girls again.' " said junior tri-captain Marcy
Crouch. "And that is probably the saddest
part because if you looked at the beginning of
the year and said this is where we were going
to be at the end. we would've been happy."
The Cardinal fell 4-0 to second-seeded
Oklahoma State (40-17) in yesterday's re
gional final, ending Stanford's season and
halting the Card's first postseason appear
ance two wins short of the Softball College
World Series.
That contest was the fourth game of the

weekend for Stanford. The Cardinal com
piled a 2-2 record at the regional, which ran
Friday through yesterday at Cowgirl Field. As
the top seed, Stanford faced off against South
west Missouri State in its first game Friday.
And right from the start Stanford looked
like the No. 1 seed. Junior pitcher Beeky
Blevins struck out the first five batters she
faced, and not until the fifth inning did the ball
even make it out of the infield.

In the bottom of the fifth, the Cardinal
struck with two runs. Senior left fielder Dawn
Kobata doubled into the gap in right-center,
and one batter later sophomore catcher Kel
lie Wiginton ripped a two-out RBI hit and
reached third base on the throw to home. Ju
nior second baseman Jennie Fovle then beat
out a grounder to short, allowing Wiginton to
score Stanford's final run.
A highly charged Cardinal squad headed
into the field for the sixth, and that's when dis
aster struck. With one out. senior second

baseman Diedre Shores drew a walk. Sopho
more left fielder Sarah Madden connected for
an RBI triple. Then sophomore catcher
Tawnya Grout fouled off 13 pitches before fi
nally winning the battle for an RBI double.
Southwest Missouri State tallied five runs
in the inning, and Crouch was brought on for
in relief. The junior pitcher finally got out of

the inning by getting Shores to ground to
short with the bases loaded. Stanford put run
ners on in the next two innings but was never
able to score, falling to the Lady Bears 5-2.
"1 think we did overlook them a little bit."
Crouch said. "And we t(x)k for granted that
we've been shutting out teams all year long.
Once we got two runs I think we just said.

"Hey, we're going to win. We always shut out
teams; we play better hitters than this all the
time.' And we just let down a little."
The loss put the Card in the losers" brack
et of the tournament, where any loss meanl
