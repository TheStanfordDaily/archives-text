## Softball season ends after solid showing at regional 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
S TILLWATER, Okla. — When the dust
settles on what was its first NCAA regional
appearance, the Stanford Softball team will
have a long list of accomplishments it can be
proud of.
In addition to its first-ever postseason
berth the ninth-ranked Cardinal (41-IS) com
pleted a record-setting season with a new high
in wins and put together a third-place confer
ence finish. Individually, the Card set single
season records for RBIs, walks, strikeouts
and wins by a single pitcher.
But yesterday, the Card could only tear
fully accept the fact that its season was over
and that the group of 16 players who achieved
this record-breaking season had played their
last game together.
"One of the things people said when they
were crying after the game was, 'I wasn't cry
ing because we lost; I was crying because I'm
never going to get to play with this group of 16
girls again.' " said junior tri-captain Marcy
Crouch. "And that is probably the saddest
part because if you looked at the beginning of
the year and said this is where we were going
to be at the end. we would've been happy."
The Cardinal fell 4-0 to second-seeded
Oklahoma State (40-17) in yesterday's re
gional final, ending Stanford's season and
halting the Card's first postseason appear
ance two wins short of the Softball College
World Series.
That contest was the fourth game of the

weekend for Stanford. The Cardinal com
piled a 2-2 record at the regional, which ran
Friday through yesterday at Cowgirl Field. As
the top seed, Stanford faced off against South
west Missouri State in its first game Friday.
And right from the start Stanford looked
like the No. 1 seed. Junior pitcher Beeky
Blevins struck out the first five batters she
faced, and not until the fifth inning did the ball
even make it out of the infield.

In the bottom of the fifth, the Cardinal
struck with two runs. Senior left fielder Dawn
Kobata doubled into the gap in right-center,
and one batter later sophomore catcher Kel
lie Wiginton ripped a two-out RBI hit and
reached third base on the throw to home. Ju
nior second baseman Jennie Fovle then beat
out a grounder to short, allowing Wiginton to
score Stanford's final run.
A highly charged Cardinal squad headed
into the field for the sixth, and that's when dis
aster struck. With one out. senior second

baseman Diedre Shores drew a walk. Sopho
more left fielder Sarah Madden connected for
an RBI triple. Then sophomore catcher
Tawnya Grout fouled off 13 pitches before fi
nally winning the battle for an RBI double.
Southwest Missouri State tallied five runs
in the inning, and Crouch was brought on for
in relief. The junior pitcher finally got out of

the inning by getting Shores to ground to
short with the bases loaded. Stanford put run
ners on in the next two innings but was never
able to score, falling to the Lady Bears 5-2.
"1 think we did overlook them a little bit."
Crouch said. "And we t(x)k for granted that
we've been shutting out teams all year long.
Once we got two runs I think we just said.

"Hey, we're going to win. We always shut out
teams; we play better hitters than this all the

Junior tri-captain Marcy Crouch scores the winning run in the top of the ninth inning against Florida State. Stanford s 1-0 vic
tory Saturday over the Seminoles was Stanford's first-ever postseason victory.
yet, Stanford gave its most impres
sive defensive showing of the year in
game one Saturday against third
seeded Florida State (51-21).
Stanford held the Seminoles
scoreless through seven innings be
hind Blevins' pitching and sharp de
fense. Unfortunately for the Card.
Florida State freshman Jennifer
White was as impressive as Blevins.
shutting down Stanford and sending
the game into extra innings. Stanford
was quite accustomed to close games,
with 25 one-run contests on the year.
In the bottom of the eighth Flori
da State began to threaten, and Stan
ford junior third baseman Shane An
derson made arguably the most im
portant play in Stanford history.
With one out and runners on first
and second, sophomore designated
player Teresa Edenfield ripped a
shot down the third baseline that
would have easily scored the game
winning run. But Anderson some
how backhanded the hard-hit
grounder, stepped on third base and
then threw to first for the inning-end
ing double play.
The Card carried the momentum
into the top of the ninth. Crouch led
off with a single to left and was bunt
ed over by junior right fielder
Michele Acosta. Then freshman first
baseman Jenni Shideler came up
with an RBI double to drive in the
game's only run. Blevins held off the
Seminoles in the bottom of the inning
to earn the 1-0 victory and the first
postseason win in Stanford history.
"I think when you know that any
game can be your last; there's a lot
more at stake," Anderson said. "We
as a team wanted it so much you
could feel the energy. And today we
just weren't ready to go home, and
we were going to do whatever we
could to make sure we didn't."
Meanwhile in the winners' brack
et, Oklahoma State upended South
west Missouri State, sending the
Lady Bears to the losers' bracket for
a rematch with the Cardinal.
This time the outcome was differ
ent. Stanford jumped on the Lady
Bears early, scoring three runs in the
third on two hits and an error. Foyle
got things going this time with a two
out base hit up the middle. Junior
shortstop Michelle Schneider fol
lowed that up with a bunt single, and
Foyle caught the Lady Bears sleep
ing and advanced to third because
Southwest Missouri State didn't have
a player anywhere near the bag.
Stanford made the Lady Bears
pay with an RBI single from Crouch.
Acosta came through next with a
shot up the gap to score Schneider.
SMSU went to third to try to get
Crouch but made a bad throw, allow
ing Crouch to score Stanford's third
run of the inning.

That's all the offense the Cardinal
would get. but it turned out to be all
Crouch would need. The pitcher shut
down the Lady Bears and allowed
just two hits after Stanford's three
run third inning.
With the win the Cardinal ad
vanced to yesterday's championship
against Oklahoma State. Coming out
of the losers' bracket, Stanford need
ed two wins over the Cowgirls in
order to advance to the World Series.
And at the beginning of yester
day's contest it looked as though two
games were imminent. Stanford put
runners on second and third in the
first inning and first and third in the
second but was unable to score. In
the top of the third Foyle got things
going with a hard single.
But as proved to be the case for
most of the game, Stanford did not
get the breaks it needed to produce a
run. Schneider ripped a line drive di
rectly at first baseman Jaime Foutch.
Then Crouch hit a shot toward the
middle. But the Cowgirls were in per
fect position, and they easily turned
the double plav on the hit and run.
"Things really didn't go our way,"
Crouch said. "Luck just was not with
us, and I really think that's a big rea
son we lost. We hit that pitcher. She
got lucky to get away with 110 runs."
But while Stanford was hitting
hard shots directly at Cowgirls,
Blevins was impressive on the

more than the minimum in the first
three innings, and the Card seemed
set for another low-scoring game.
But unfortunately for Stanford
the scoreless standoff didn't last. Ju

the plate. The Cowgirls' leading hit

great plays to shut down any Cardi

S TILLWATER, Okla. — When the dust
settles on what was its first NCAA regional
appearance, the Stanford Softball team will
have a long list of accomplishments it can be
proud of.
In addition to its first-ever postseason
berth the ninth-ranked Cardinal (41-IS) com
pleted a record-setting season with a new high
in wins and put together a third-place confer
ence finish. Individually, the Card set single
season records for RBIs, walks, strikeouts
and wins by a single pitcher.
But yesterday, the Card could only tear
fully accept the fact that its season was over
and that the group of 16 players who achieved
this record-breaking season had played their
last game together.
"One of the things people said when they
were crying after the game was, 'I wasn't cry
ing because we lost; I was crying because I'm
never going to get to play with this group of 16
girls again.' " said junior tri-captain Marcy
Crouch. "And that is probably the saddest
part because if you looked at the beginning of
the year and said this is where we were going
to be at the end. we would've been happy."
The Cardinal fell 4-0 to second-seeded
Oklahoma State (40-17) in yesterday's re
gional final, ending Stanford's season and
halting the Card's first postseason appear
ance two wins short of the Softball College
World Series.
That contest was the fourth game of the

weekend for Stanford. The Cardinal com
piled a 2-2 record at the regional, which ran
Friday through yesterday at Cowgirl Field. As
the top seed, Stanford faced off against South
west Missouri State in its first game Friday.
And right from the start Stanford looked
like the No. 1 seed. Junior pitcher Beeky
Blevins struck out the first five batters she
faced, and not until the fifth inning did the ball
even make it out of the infield.

In the bottom of the fifth, the Cardinal
struck with two runs. Senior left fielder Dawn
Kobata doubled into the gap in right-center,
and one batter later sophomore catcher Kel
lie Wiginton ripped a two-out RBI hit and
reached third base on the throw to home. Ju
nior second baseman Jennie Fovle then beat
out a grounder to short, allowing Wiginton to
score Stanford's final run.
A highly charged Cardinal squad headed
into the field for the sixth, and that's when dis
aster struck. With one out. senior second

baseman Diedre Shores drew a walk. Sopho
more left fielder Sarah Madden connected for
an RBI triple. Then sophomore catcher
Tawnya Grout fouled off 13 pitches before fi
nally winning the battle for an RBI double.
Southwest Missouri State tallied five runs
in the inning, and Crouch was brought on for
in relief. The junior pitcher finally got out of

the inning by getting Shores to ground to
short with the bases loaded. Stanford put run
ners on in the next two innings but was never
able to score, falling to the Lady Bears 5-2.
"1 think we did overlook them a little bit."
Crouch said. "And we t(x)k for granted that
we've been shutting out teams all year long.
Once we got two runs I think we just said.

"Hey, we're going to win. We always shut out

Junior tri-captain Marcy Crouch scores the winning run in the top of the ninth inning against Florida State. Stanford s 1-0 vic
tory Saturday over the Seminoles was Stanford's first-ever postseason victory.
yet, Stanford gave its most impres
sive defensive showing of the year in
game one Saturday against third
seeded Florida State (51-21).
Stanford held the Seminoles
scoreless through seven innings be
hind Blevins' pitching and sharp de
fense. Unfortunately for the Card.
Florida State freshman Jennifer
White was as impressive as Blevins.
shutting down Stanford and sending
the game into extra innings. Stanford
was quite accustomed to close games,
with 25 one-run contests on the year.
In the bottom of the eighth Flori
da State began to threaten, and Stan
ford junior third baseman Shane An
derson made arguably the most im
portant play in Stanford history.
With one out and runners on first
and second, sophomore designated
player Teresa Edenfield ripped a
shot down the third baseline that
would have easily scored the game
winning run. But Anderson some
how backhanded the hard-hit
grounder, stepped on third base and
then threw to first for the inning-end
ing double play.
The Card carried the momentum
into the top of the ninth. Crouch led
off with a single to left and was bunt
ed over by junior right fielder
Michele Acosta. Then freshman first
baseman Jenni Shideler came up
with an RBI double to drive in the
game's only run. Blevins held off the
Seminoles in the bottom of the inning
to earn the 1-0 victory and the first
postseason win in Stanford history.
"I think when you know that any
game can be your last; there's a lot
more at stake," Anderson said. "We
as a team wanted it so much you
could feel the energy. And today we
just weren't ready to go home, and
we were going to do whatever we
could to make sure we didn't."
Meanwhile in the winners' brack
et, Oklahoma State upended South
west Missouri State, sending the
Lady Bears to the losers' bracket for
a rematch with the Cardinal.
This time the outcome was differ
ent. Stanford jumped on the Lady
Bears early, scoring three runs in the
third on two hits and an error. Foyle
got things going this time with a two
out base hit up the middle. Junior
shortstop Michelle Schneider fol
lowed that up with a bunt single, and
Foyle caught the Lady Bears sleep
ing and advanced to third because
Southwest Missouri State didn't have
a player anywhere near the bag.
Stanford made the Lady Bears
pay with an RBI single from Crouch.
Acosta came through next with a
shot up the gap to score Schneider.
SMSU went to third to try to get
Crouch but made a bad throw, allow
ing Crouch to score Stanford's third
run of the inning.

That's all the offense the Cardinal
would get. but it turned out to be all
Crouch would need. The pitcher shut
down the Lady Bears and allowed
just two hits after Stanford's three
run third inning.
With the win the Cardinal ad
vanced to yesterday's championship
against Oklahoma State. Coming out
of the losers' bracket, Stanford need
ed two wins over the Cowgirls in
order to advance to the World Series.
And at the beginning of yester
day's contest it looked as though two
games were imminent. Stanford put
runners on second and third in the
first inning and first and third in the
second but was unable to score. In
the top of the third Foyle got things
going with a hard single.
But as proved to be the case for
most of the game, Stanford did not
get the breaks it needed to produce a
run. Schneider ripped a line drive di
rectly at first baseman Jaime Foutch.
Then Crouch hit a shot toward the
middle. But the Cowgirls were in per
fect position, and they easily turned
the double plav on the hit and run.
"Things really didn't go our way,"
Crouch said. "Luck just was not with
us, and I really think that's a big rea
son we lost. We hit that pitcher. She
got lucky to get away with 110 runs."
But while Stanford was hitting
hard shots directly at Cowgirls,
Blevins was impressive on the

more than the minimum in the first
three innings, and the Card seemed
set for another low-scoring game.
But unfortunately for Stanford
the scoreless standoff didn't last. Ju

off the fourth with a base hit. That's
when the slumping Foutch came to
the plate. The Cowgirls' leading hit
ter jumped all over a high pitch and
sent it bouncing off the truck parked

run in the fifth and sixth for the final
score. Oklahoma State made all the
great plays to shut down any Cardi

walked away with the 4-0 win and a
trip to next weekend's World Series.

more than the minimum in the first
three innings, and the Card seemed
set for another low-scoring game.
But unfortunately for Stanford
the scoreless standoff didn't last. Ju
nior center fielder Casey Acree led
off the fourth with a base hit. That's
when the slumping Foutch came to
the plate. The Cowgirls' leading hit
ter jumped all over a high pitch and
sent it bouncing off the truck parked
behind the left-field fence.
Oklahoma State added one more
run in the fifth and sixth for the final
score. Oklahoma State made all the
great plays to shut down any Cardi
nal comeback, and the Cowgirls
walked away with the 4-0 win and a
trip to next weekend's World Series.
"You get a pitch up, and she can
do that," Rittman said of Foutch's
hit. "I know Becky would like to have

S TILLWATER, Okla. — When the dust
settles on what was its first NCAA regional
appearance, the Stanford Softball team will
have a long list of accomplishments it can be
proud of.
In addition to its first-ever postseason
berth the ninth-ranked Cardinal (41-IS) com
pleted a record-setting season with a new high
in wins and put together a third-place confer
ence finish. Individually, the Card set single
season records for RBIs, walks, strikeouts
and wins by a single pitcher.
But yesterday, the Card could only tear
fully accept the fact that its season was over
and that the group of 16 players who achieved
this record-breaking season had played their
last game together.
"One of the things people said when they
were crying after the game was, 'I wasn't cry
ing because we lost; I was crying because I'm
never going to get to play with this group of 16
girls again.' " said junior tri-captain Marcy
Crouch. "And that is probably the saddest
part because if you looked at the beginning of
the year and said this is where we were going
to be at the end. we would've been happy."
The Cardinal fell 4-0 to second-seeded
Oklahoma State (40-17) in yesterday's re
gional final, ending Stanford's season and
halting the Card's first postseason appear
ance two wins short of the Softball College
World Series.
That contest was the fourth game of the

weekend for Stanford. The Cardinal com
piled a 2-2 record at the regional, which ran
Friday through yesterday at Cowgirl Field. As
the top seed, Stanford faced off against South
west Missouri State in its first game Friday.
And right from the start Stanford looked
like the No. 1 seed. Junior pitcher Beeky
Blevins struck out the first five batters she
faced, and not until the fifth inning did the ball
even make it out of the infield.

Stanford finishes second in NCAA Regional.

In the bottom of the fifth, the Cardinal
struck with two runs. Senior left fielder Dawn
Kobata doubled into the gap in right-center,
and one batter later sophomore catcher Kel
lie Wiginton ripped a two-out RBI hit and
reached third base on the throw to home. Ju
nior second baseman Jennie Fovle then beat
out a grounder to short, allowing Wiginton to
score Stanford's final run.
A highly charged Cardinal squad headed
into the field for the sixth, and that's when dis
aster struck. With one out. senior second

baseman Diedre Shores drew a walk. Sopho
more left fielder Sarah Madden connected for
an RBI triple. Then sophomore catcher
Tawnya Grout fouled off 13 pitches before fi
nally winning the battle for an RBI double.
Southwest Missouri State tallied five runs
in the inning, and Crouch was brought on for
in relief. The junior pitcher finally got out of

the inning by getting Shores to ground to
short with the bases loaded. Stanford put run
ners on in the next two innings but was never
able to score, falling to the Lady Bears 5-2.
"1 think we did overlook them a little bit."
Crouch said. "And we t(x)k for granted that
we've been shutting out teams all year long.
Once we got two runs I think we just said.

"Hey, we're going to win. We always shut out
teams; we play better hitters than this all the
time.' And we just let down a little."

Junior tri-captain Marcy Crouch scores the winning run in the top of the ninth inning against Florida State. Stanford s 1-0 vic
tory Saturday over the Seminoles was Stanford's first-ever postseason victory.
yet, Stanford gave its most impres
sive defensive showing of the year in
game one Saturday against third
seeded Florida State (51-21).
Stanford held the Seminoles
scoreless through seven innings be
hind Blevins' pitching and sharp de
fense. Unfortunately for the Card.
Florida State freshman Jennifer
White was as impressive as Blevins.
shutting down Stanford and sending
the game into extra innings. Stanford
was quite accustomed to close games,
with 25 one-run contests on the year.
In the bottom of the eighth Flori
da State began to threaten, and Stan
ford junior third baseman Shane An
derson made arguably the most im
portant play in Stanford history.
With one out and runners on first
and second, sophomore designated
player Teresa Edenfield ripped a
shot down the third baseline that
would have easily scored the game
winning run. But Anderson some
how backhanded the hard-hit
grounder, stepped on third base and
then threw to first for the inning-end
ing double play.
The Card carried the momentum
into the top of the ninth. Crouch led
off with a single to left and was bunt
ed over by junior right fielder
Michele Acosta. Then freshman first
baseman Jenni Shideler came up
with an RBI double to drive in the
game's only run. Blevins held off the
Seminoles in the bottom of the inning
to earn the 1-0 victory and the first
postseason win in Stanford history.
"I think when you know that any
game can be your last; there's a lot
more at stake," Anderson said. "We
as a team wanted it so much you
could feel the energy. And today we
just weren't ready to go home, and
we were going to do whatever we
could to make sure we didn't."
Meanwhile in the winners' brack
et, Oklahoma State upended South
west Missouri State, sending the
Lady Bears to the losers' bracket for
a rematch with the Cardinal.
This time the outcome was differ
ent. Stanford jumped on the Lady
Bears early, scoring three runs in the
third on two hits and an error. Foyle
got things going this time with a two
out base hit up the middle. Junior
shortstop Michelle Schneider fol
lowed that up with a bunt single, and
Foyle caught the Lady Bears sleep
ing and advanced to third because
Southwest Missouri State didn't have
a player anywhere near the bag.
Stanford made the Lady Bears
pay with an RBI single from Crouch.
Acosta came through next with a
shot up the gap to score Schneider.
SMSU went to third to try to get
Crouch but made a bad throw, allow
ing Crouch to score Stanford's third
run of the inning.

That's all the offense the Cardinal
would get. but it turned out to be all
Crouch would need. The pitcher shut
down the Lady Bears and allowed
just two hits after Stanford's three
run third inning.
With the win the Cardinal ad
vanced to yesterday's championship
against Oklahoma State. Coming out
of the losers' bracket, Stanford need
ed two wins over the Cowgirls in
order to advance to the World Series.
And at the beginning of yester
day's contest it looked as though two
games were imminent. Stanford put
runners on second and third in the
first inning and first and third in the
second but was unable to score. In
the top of the third Foyle got things
going with a hard single.
But as proved to be the case for
most of the game, Stanford did not
get the breaks it needed to produce a
run. Schneider ripped a line drive di
rectly at first baseman Jaime Foutch.
Then Crouch hit a shot toward the
middle. But the Cowgirls were in per
fect position, and they easily turned
the double plav on the hit and run.
"Things really didn't go our way,"
Crouch said. "Luck just was not with
us, and I really think that's a big rea
son we lost. We hit that pitcher. She
got lucky to get away with 110 runs."
But while Stanford was hitting
hard shots directly at Cowgirls,
Blevins was impressive on the
