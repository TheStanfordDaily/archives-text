weekend in the ttnierald City for
the baseball team.

while Stanford may have been No. 1
in the country, the Huskies still
planned to bite back.

"There's an element of luck in
the postseason because all the
teams are fairly good and you face a
hot team or get a guy that domi
nates you at the bat, but I don't see
a weakness with them," said Stan

ford head coach Mark Marquess.
"They're not a surprise to me now
that I've seen them for the last two
years. They've done a great job. and
they're a good team. Whoever has
to play them, they've got their
hands full."
This indeed was the case, as
every Washington starter — with
the exception of second baseman
Marc Rittenhouse — crossed the
plate to taunt the normally over
powering Cardinal defense.
Center fielder Chris Magruder.
who reached base all six times in
Thursday's 16-4 win over Stanford,
went 4 for 6 Friday with a double, a
home run. three runs and three
RBls. Right fielder Nick Stefonick
went 3 for 6 with a two-run homer,
and catcher Ryan Bundv. whose

triple scored the Huskies' first two
runs, went 3 for 5.
Meanwhile, the Husky bullpen
seemed as deep as Puget Sound. A
total of six Washington pitchers
jogged to the plate for the Huskies
to match Stanford junior Jeff
Austin (12-3) and hand the All-
American and National Team ace
the loss. Austin gave up eight runs
on eight hits in only three innings.
"I was surprised they hit Austin
today," Marquess said. "1 thought
Austin had pretty good stuff, but
that's a credit to them. They hit a
couple of good pitches. He got be
hind a little bit more than he nor
mally does. But I was very im
pressed with the way they hit both
days — especially today."
Austin retired the mound to
freshman up-and-comer Justin
Wayne in the top of the fourth, who
allowed the Huskies four runs. Car
dinal freshman right-hander Austin
Coose relieved Wayne in the ninth to
close the books on the demoralizing
Cardinal loss, which is Stanford's
fourth straight

The Huskies trailed Stanford 3-0
at the close of the first. Cardinal
sophomore leadoff man Edmund
Muth banged a lofty solo homer that
glided over the right-field fence on a
3-1 count.
Junior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang followed later in the in
ning with a two-run shot to bring in
sophomore first baseman John Gall.
But Washington scored five in the
second and never looked back.
Uncomfortable on Husky Ball
park's uniquely constructed mound

that perches atop a blindingly green
sea of artificial turf. Austin sputtered
in the second. He gave up a walk, sin
gle, double, triple and homer as the
Huskies ran up a 5-3 lead.
Washington added to its lead in
the third as Austin surrendered solo
homers to first baseman Ed Erickson
and left fielder Kyle Woods before
hitting designated hitter Jim Na, who
later scored off a single by Magruder
to bring the score to 8-3.
Under the leadership of junior
center fielder Jody Gerut, the Cardi

nal fought back in the bottom of the
third. Gerut, who reached base on a
single, promptly stole second, rushed
to third on an error by Bundy and
came home on a sacrifice fly bv
Hochgesang to bring the Cardinal
within four runs.
The Husky onslaught, however,
continued throughout the game. The
Dawgs tallied runs in six innings.
But the Cardinal threatened late,
retaliating with a two-run homer
from freshman right fielder Joe Bor
chard in the fifth as well as an RBI

double from Gerut. A second dou
ble by Gerut in the bottom of the
sixth brought home Muth and
brought the Cardinal to within 10-8
after six, but the Cardinal could
score no more.
Husky closer Ryan Bundy
blanked the Cardinal in the ninth
and sealed the loss.
"I'his is the best time you want to
go out and get hot," Magruder said.
"We've got a whole bunch of guys
who are hot. II we can take that into
next week and Omaha, look out."
