# Familiar ground for Card
## 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
SEATTLE — Deja vu.
It's always a little eerie and often conjures
up concerned talk.
And it's just happened to No. 1 Stanford,
who hobbled back-to-back games to No. 19
Washington and handed over the Pac-10
championship to the Huskies this weekend.
Last season witnessed the same scenario
May 15-17 at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The Huskies trounced Stanford last year in
three games to win their first overall confer
ence title since 1922. After the Cardinal took
the Thursday opener with a 7-ft come-from-be
hind win. the then-No. 23 Huskies blasted the
then-No. 5 Cardinal 13-8 in game two and 12-9
in the finale.
And this year — this weekend in fact — it
unfortunately happened again up at Washing
ton's Husky Ballpark.
And in both series, the similarities were just
a little too uncomfortably similar.
In both championships, the customarily in
surmountable Cardinal pitching staff fell to
pieces.
Last year, then-sophomore southpaw Brent
Hoard unleashed a series of unrestrained
pitches in the Friday match that ultimately tar
geted everything except the strike zone.
Then-junior reliever Josh Koons fared no
better. Koons dished out eight balls in eight
pitches and walked in a run before Marquess

ond year in a row.
yanked the right-hander who was
saddled with the loss.
Now deep within the bullpen.
Marquess next, called on then
sophomore Cameron Newton and
then-junior Adam Harris, both of
whom until that time had seen
very little mound action and are
not on the roster this year.
The painful result: By the end
of the inning, four different Cardi
nal pitchers combined for a total
which included one hit batsman,
four hits and nine runs.
Fast forward one year.
Same situation, same outcome.
In the first game, preseason
All-American Chad Hutchinson's
control abandoned him. After
only 4 2/3 innings of work,
Hutchinson had allowed 10 hits,
eight runs (four earned), four
walked batters, two wild pitches
and two hit batters.
Cardinal junior ace Jeff Austin,
perhaps the nation's best pitcher,
also fell victim to a tough Wash
ington offense. Austin suffered his
worst game of the season, giving
up eight runs on eight hits in just
three innings.
To compound Stanford's trou
bles in both series, the defense and
offense stumbled slightly.
Last year, Stanford's six errors
in the Saturday game turned 12
Husky hits into 12 runs, while the
offense was blanked at the plate in
the final three innings.
This Friday the defense com
mitted three errors — an unchar
acteristically high number — and
the offense could only score four
runs.
So should there be extreme
concern heading into the regional
this weekend?
Probably not.
Unlike last year, the Cardinal
has been ranked No. I all season
long for a fine reason — Stanford
lost a series for the first time last
week.
In fact, four Stanford players
were recently honored with all
conference accolades, and four
more received honorable men
tion.
Topping the list is Austin. The
junior has been nothing short of
spectacular this season for the
Card with a 12-3 overall record.
The Cardinal ace has overpow
ered his opponents, striking out
126 batters in 123 2/3 innings.
Joining Austin on the first team
is senior shortstop Jay Pecci. who
once walked on to the squad but is
now heralded as one of the best
collegiate shortstops in the coun
try.
Junior Jody Cierut. a virtual
wall in center field who leads the
squad with 18 home runs, and
sophomore first baseman John
Gall, who going into this weekend
was batting a team-leading .385,
were also selections.
Honorable mentions were
awarded to two-sport standouts
Joe Borchard and Hutchinson,
sophomore outfielder Edmund
Muth and freshman pitcher Justin
Wayne.
And if the loss to Washington is
a little too large a dose of deja vu
for some, then just remember that
it's not over yet. The regional has
yet to be played.
