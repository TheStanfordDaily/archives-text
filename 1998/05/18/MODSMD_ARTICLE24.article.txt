# Familiar ground for Card

SEATTLE — Deja vu.
It's always a little eerie and often conjures
up concerned talk.
And it's just happened to No. 1 Stanford,
who hobbled back-to-back games to No. 19
Washington and handed over the Pac-10
championship to the Huskies this weekend.
Last season witnessed the same scenario
May 15-17 at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
The Huskies trounced Stanford last year in
three games to win their first overall confer
ence title since 1922. After the Cardinal took
the Thursday opener with a 7-ft come-from-be
hind win. the then-No. 23 Huskies blasted the
then-No. 5 Cardinal 13-8 in game two and 12-9
in the finale.
And this year — this weekend in fact — it
unfortunately happened again up at Washing
ton's Husky Ballpark.
And in both series, the similarities were just
a little too uncomfortably similar.
In both championships, the customarily in
surmountable Cardinal pitching staff fell to
pieces.
Last year, then-sophomore southpaw Brent
Hoard unleashed a series of unrestrained
pitches in the Friday match that ultimately tar
geted everything except the strike zone.
Then-junior reliever Josh Koons fared no
better. Koons dished out eight balls in eight
pitches and walked in a run before Marquess
