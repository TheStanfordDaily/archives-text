Swimming
Stanford swimming swept the
NCAA Championships, but the
men's and women's teams couldn't
sweep either the Pacific 10 Confer
ence swimmer or coach of the year
awards.
Freshman Misty Hyman was
easily the women's choice, adding a
Pac-10 trophy to her NCAA swim
mer of the year award. But Ari
zona's Frank Busch edged Stan
ford's Richard Quick as the confer
ence's coach of the year.
A Wildcat kept the men from a
sweep as well. Rvk Neethling re
peated as swimmer of the year,
beating out Tom Wilkens and sev
eral Stanford athletes for the
honor.
A Cardinal man has not won the
conference's top honor since Brian
Retterer in 1995.
Stanford coach Skip Kenney
earned his 12th conference coach
of the year award.

Men's golf
Stanford graduate Notah Begay
111 became the third golfer to score
under 60 for a round on a U.S. Pro
Tour on Friday. Begay. a member
of the 1994 NC A A champion team,
fired a 13-under-par 59 for the sec
ond round of the Nike Dominion
Open in Richmond. Va.
Begay averaged a birdie for his
last 11 holes and aced a hole-in-one
at the 196-yard No. 3. which he
played on the back nine of the
7,020-yard Dominion Club course.
No golfer on the Nike tour had
ever scored in the fifties, and only
A 1 Geiberger and Chip Beck have
enjoyed such success on the PCiA
Tour. The most recent 59 — Beck's
— came in 1991.
Begay's second-round heroics
couldn't earn him the title. He blew
a four-stroke lead by firing 74s in
the final two rounds, finishing at 11 -
under-par 277. Begay finished in a
four-way tie for sixth, while Bob
Burns earned his first Nike Tour
victory at 14-under-par 274.
