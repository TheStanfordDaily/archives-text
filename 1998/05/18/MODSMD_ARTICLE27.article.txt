### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Completing another successful
year, Bechtel International Center's
18th annual International Festival
took place Saturday afternoon in the
center's backyard,
" This is our biggest event of the
year, and each year it gets better as
long as the weather gets good," said
Anton Rowe, resident host at the
center and one of the organizers of
the event.
The festival featured food booths
from groups such as the Armenian
Student Association, the Korean
Student Association and the Thai-
American Intercultural Society. It
also showcased cultural tables from
groups such as the Stanford African
Student Association, the Associa
tion of Chinese Students and Schol
ars at Stanford and the Lebanese
Student Association.
In addition to the food and cultur
al display tables, there was a contin

uous program of entertainment with
dance and music from countries all
over the world.
The festival was well attended,
mostly by Stanford affiliates and
members of the local community.
"We saw an advertisement in the
Palo Alto Weekly, and we do things
together so we decided to come,"
said Phil Carter, Class of '51, and
Evelyn Draper, an adjunct professor
in the Drama Department. "It's very
pleasant and colorful," they added.
Those in charge of the event were
thrilled with its success.
"The attendance this year is as
good as ever and the food booths are
all selling out," said center director
John Pearson.
"This is the one event a year that
the international center can show
some of the diversity that exists at
Stanford.... Any credit for this goes
to Lynn [Kroner]."
Student groups were equally
happy with the turnout.
"We think it's a very nice event,"

said doctoral student Oliver Thum,
vice president of the Stanford Ger
man Association, a group that orga
nizes events related to German cul
ture and politics.
"We've had a lot of people com
ing here all day, asking to buy loaves
of our bread," he added.
In addition to serving the tradi
tional German fare of bratwurst,
sauerkraut and rye bread, the group
applied for and received a liquor li
cense and sold beer, marking the first
time that liquor has been available at
the festival.
"We have two types of imported
beer available, a pilsner from north
ern Germany and a hefeweizen from
the south," Thum said.
Concerns about the weather were
paramount given the lack of space
inside the center to hold the event.
"I'm really happy that it didn't
rain. That would have put us in a
bind," said Lynn Kroner, assistant
foreign student adviser and festival
co-coordinator.
