### Bimal Shah Senior staff writer 
This year's Presidential Lectures and
Symposia in the Arts and Humanities
wraps up tonight with renowned literary
critic Harold Bloom speaking at Kresge
Auditorium. His lecture, titled "The Way
We Read Now," will begin at 7 p.m.
A professor at Yale University and New
York University, Bloom "has been for re
ally 30 years one of the key persons in liter
ary criticism," according to French and Ital
ian Prof. Hans Gumbrecht. director of the
series. Bloom has had an impact on the way
we see the history of English literature,
Gumbrecht explained.
Bloom was outspoken in his views con
cerning literary study. "Literary study ...
has declined very sharply in the U.S. and
the English-speaking world." Bloom said,
predicting the demise of the field as it is tra
ditionally known. He cited political ele
ments such as multiculturalism and femi
nism as chief culprits.
"1 believe to read in the service of ideol
ogy is not to read at all," Bloom said,
adding that the teaching of the aesthetic as
pect is gone in most university instruction.
As a result, there is an "increasing gap

between faculty and undergraduates," with
the students less interested in the propa
gandizing. Bloom said.
"I'm going to talk [at my lecture] about
what it means to read." That is, to do so
deeply and in search of the aesthetic, he
added.
Given that Bloom is "very outspoken
and provocative," Gumbrecht hopes the
esteemed literary critic will attract as many
"anti-Bloomians" as "Bloomians."
Gumbrecht added that Stanford is
rather famous in the debate about literary
studies and the humanities because of the
introduction of the Cultures, Ideas and
Values curriculum in the late 1980s. Stan
ford was one of the first to open up the lit
erary canon to seriously address multicul
tural issues.
Bloom is critical of this opening up, and
Gumbrecht said he expected debate about
the literary canon during Bloom's visit to
campus.
In addition to his lecture, Bloom will lec
ture tomorrow morning to ClV's "Great
Works" track. Later that day from 4 to 6
p.m., he will participate in a panel discus
sion at the Humanities Center Annex.
