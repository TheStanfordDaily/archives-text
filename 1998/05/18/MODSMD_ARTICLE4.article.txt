of adult students by an out-of
touch University is the main theme
of a comprehensive report on grad
uate housing by the ASSIJ. the
Graduate Student Council and the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
These specific concerns tie into
a larger sense of resentment and
isolation felt by graduate students
and a feeling that Stanford's ad
ministration fails to respect and ap
preciate the role of graduate stu
dents in the University community,

survey.

the recent graduate housing survey
conducted on the World Wide Web
by the Graduate Student Council
and the ASSU Task Force on

ing issues, in
cluding the
