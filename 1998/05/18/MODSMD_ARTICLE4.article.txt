# Student report identifies major grad student housing problems
## Housing blues 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
A worrying picture of rapidly in
creasing rents, decreasing housing
quality and patronizing treatment
of adult students by an out-of
touch University is the main theme
of a comprehensive report on grad
uate housing by the ASSIJ. the
Graduate Student Council and the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
These specific concerns tie into
a larger sense of resentment and
isolation felt by graduate students
and a feeling that Stanford's ad
ministration fails to respect and ap
preciate the role of graduate stu
dents in the University community,
according to comments from the
survey.
The report is based on results of
the recent graduate housing survey
conducted on the World Wide Web
by the Graduate Student Council
and the ASSU Task Force on
Graduate Housing.

The report
addressed a
wide range of
graduate hous
ing issues, in
cluding the
quality and
quantity of
housing, park
ing spaces.

graduate resident assistants and
lack of administrative support.
lack of on-campus housing
The report expressed the deep
concern of the graduate students
on the lack of on-campus housing.
The number of applications for on
campus graduate housing in
creased in all categories in this
year's lottery. Last May. K(X) stu
dents were refused housing in the
lottery. After the waiting list as
signments. 591 single students and
126 couples remained unassigned.
The lack of on-campus housing

has forced more graduate students
to seek off-campus apartments. Ac
cording a San Jose Mercury News
article quoted in the report, there is
less than 1 percent vacancy in Santa
Clara and San Mateo counties.
Stiff competition for housing —
mostly from well-paid Silicon Val
ley employees — has caused a sharp
increase in local rents. Housing
prices in the area have gone up 35
percent over the past three years
and 20 percent over the past year.
Graduate stipends however, have
only gone up 11 percent during the
same three-year period.
According to Community Hous
ing Services, the average monthly
rent for a one-bedroom apartment
in the Peninsula is on average $3(X)

to $600 more than those in New
Haven, Conn, and $150 to $450
more than Boston.
The survey showed that Stan
ford students pay a median of $600
to $699 a month for housing. Only
Manhattan had a higher calculated
cost of living out of the areas in
which major universities are locat
ed.
The report also showed that cur
rent stipend levels place graduate
student income below the mini
mum cost of living estimated by the
Bursar's Office.
The estimated minimum budget
for a single graduate student was
$20,492 for 1997-98, while the mean
graduate income during the same
period is $16,(XX) to $16,999. This
amounts to a yearly deficit of near
ly $4,(XM). The situation is worse for
students with a spouse and children.
University support to aid students

in finding off-campus housing is also
lacking, according to the report.
However, many international stu
dents are not allowed to work he
cause of the status of their visas. Com
ments from the survey pointed to the
fact that listings provided by Com
munity Housing Services are out of
date and not comprehensive enough.
The steep housing prices have
forced some graduate students to
seek part-time jobs and accept sub
standard housing in unpleasant or
dangerous neighborhoods. In addi
tion. the report indicated that some
students are considering dropping
out of doctoral programs due to in
creased debt from living expenses.
Ninety-one percent of students
currently living on campus said they
would like to live on campus again
next year if they were eligible, ac
cording to the report. In addition,
21 percent of the students denied

housing are requesting to
come back, and an addi
tional 24 percent would do
so if not for the assumption
that they would be rejected
by the lottery.
The report recommend
ed construction of 1,000
more housing spaces for
graduate students, and
urged the University to
take a "paradigm shift" in
its approach to graduate
housing.
Provost Condoleeza
Rice said, "Nobody ex
pected this steep rise in
rental prices coupled with
low inventory in the out
side campus market. Our
response has been to make
as many beds available as
possible on campus.... We
are looking at longer-term
solutions but we had no
choice but to put as many
people on campus as possi
ble. We have also signifi
cantly raised stipends this
year as well."
Other administrators
would not comment on the
issue until later in the
week.

Quality of on-campus housing
The report showed that a vast
majority of the graduate population
was concerned about the quality of
on-campus housing, particularly
with the scheduled restructuring of
existing housing to fit more stu
dents.
The University is planning to
add 260 new spaces by converting
130 Crothers and Crothers Memor
ial singles into doubles and by en
forcing double occupancy in one
bedroom apartments and triple oc
cupancy in two-bedroom apart
ments in 130 Escondido Village
units.
The survey found little support
for this solution. Many students felt,
as one said, "patronized by an ad
ministration oblivious to basic re
quirements for graduate student
living."
Many graduate students come to
graduate school after years of work
ing and living in the "real world."
As one survey respondent put it,
"We are not children — we are
adults with lives and beds and book
shelves."
The report recommended that a
one-bedroom, one-person standard
for single graduate student housing
be adopted by the University to en
sure a reasonable standard of living
for graduate students.
A secondary issue addressed by
the report concerned housing poli
cies and customer services provided
by the University.
The report asked that Housing
Assignment Services be more flexi
ble in their deadlines for moving
dates and application deadlines in
order to accommodate the needs of
graduate students.
It also indicated dissatisfaction
with the service received from
Housing Assignment Services and
Community Housing Services. Em
ployees of Housing Assignment
Services were specifically criticized
for being inflexible, unnecessarily
bureaucratic and unfriendly.
"I found out that I would be at
tending a graduate program at
Stanford two weeks before classes
began," wrote one student. "I had

never been to the area before and
[had] no idea how to go about look
ing for housing ... so I met with a
member of the housing office. This
woman took no interest in my situ
ation, [and] offered no help.... I
found that I had to go about the

process of finding housing alone,
[despite the fact] Stanford is using
part of my tuition money to pay the
community housing services de
partment to help students like my
self."
Students also expressed concern
over the lack of unfurnished apart
ments and the prohibition of pets in
on-campus housing.
Graduate resident assistants
Of the 1.260 respondents who
wrote comments. 84 percent said
that they thought the graduate RAs
performed a useful role and would
like to see that role continue. Over
half of the graduate students re
sponding felt isolated from the Uni
versity, and most felt that graduate
RAs serve an important role in
community building.
The fact that graduate RA posi
tions were eliminated without con
sultation with graduate students
was a major area of concern for stu
dents.
"I resent the fact that the deci
sion to scale down the role of Ci RAs
and thus reduce their effectiveness
was made without student input."

one student commented in the sur
vey.
Forecast for the future
The report recommended several
short-term solutions for the current
housing crisis. They include the pur-

chase of off
campus hous
ing by the
University;
increases in
graduate
stipends
throughout
the Universi
ty; housing
subsidies for
off-campus
students;
seeking help
through fac
ulty and local
alumni to rent
rooms for stu
dents; and the
construction
af temporary

trailers and graduate housing in the
Sand Hill Road project.
The report also asked that free
off-campus listings be provided by
Community Housing Services.
Finally, the report indicated that
the current housing problems may
have a detrimental effect on gradu
ate student recruitment.
Many students surveyed said
that they are starting to warn
prospective graduate students
against coming to Stanford because
of the extremely high cost of living.
Alumni fund raising from gradu
ate students may also be affected by
the current housing problems.
Graduate students who feel aban
doned by the University are less
likely to donate money later, ac
cording to the report. This will affect
the donations individual depart
ments receive, which comes in large
part from former graduate students.
One respondent of the survey
wrote. "To put it bluntly, it's plain
the housing administrators don't
give a damn about us. That's OK.
When we're rich alumni, we will re
turn the sentiments."

come back, and an addi
tional 24 percent would do
so if not for the assumption
that they would be rejected
by the lottery.
The report recommend
ed construction of 1,000
more housing spaces for
graduate students, and
urged the University to
take a "paradigm shift" in
its approach to graduate
housing.
Provost Condoleeza
Rice said, "Nobody ex
pected this steep rise in
rental prices coupled with
low inventory in the out
side campus market. Our
response has been to make
as many beds available as
possible on campus.... We
are looking at longer-term
solutions but we had no
choice but to put as many
people on campus as possi
ble. We have also signifi
cantly raised stipends this
year as well."
Other administrators
would not comment on the
issue until later in the
week.

Quality of on-campus housing
The report showed that a vast
majority of the graduate population
was concerned about the quality of
on-campus housing, particularly
with the scheduled restructuring of
existing housing to fit more stu
dents.
The University is planning to
add 260 new spaces by converting
130 Crothers and Crothers Memor
ial singles into doubles and by en
forcing double occupancy in one
bedroom apartments and triple oc
cupancy in two-bedroom apart
ments in 130 Escondido Village
units.
The survey found little support
for this solution. Many students felt,
as one said, "patronized by an ad
ministration oblivious to basic re
quirements for graduate student
living."
Many graduate students come to
graduate school after years of work
ing and living in the "real world."
As one survey respondent put it,
"We are not children — we are
adults with lives and beds and book
shelves."
The report recommended that a
one-bedroom, one-person standard
for single graduate student housing
be adopted by the University to en
sure a reasonable standard of living
for graduate students.
A secondary issue addressed by
the report concerned housing poli
cies and customer services provided
by the University.
The report asked that Housing
Assignment Services be more flexi
ble in their deadlines for moving
dates and application deadlines in
order to accommodate the needs of
graduate students.
It also indicated dissatisfaction
with the service received from
Housing Assignment Services and
Community Housing Services. Em
ployees of Housing Assignment
Services were specifically criticized
for being inflexible, unnecessarily
bureaucratic and unfriendly.
"I found out that I would be at
tending a graduate program at
Stanford two weeks before classes
began," wrote one student. "I had

never been to the area before and
[had] no idea how to go about look
ing for housing ... so I met with a
member of the housing office. This
woman took no interest in my situ
ation, [and] offered no help.... I
found that I had to go about the

process of finding housing alone,
[despite the fact] Stanford is using
part of my tuition money to pay the
community housing services de
partment to help students like my
self."
Students also expressed concern
over the lack of unfurnished apart
ments and the prohibition of pets in
on-campus housing.
Graduate resident assistants
Of the 1.260 respondents who
wrote comments. 84 percent said
that they thought the graduate RAs
performed a useful role and would
like to see that role continue. Over
half of the graduate students re
sponding felt isolated from the Uni
versity, and most felt that graduate
RAs serve an important role in
community building.
The fact that graduate RA posi
tions were eliminated without con
sultation with graduate students
was a major area of concern for stu
dents.
"I resent the fact that the deci
sion to scale down the role of Ci RAs
and thus reduce their effectiveness
was made without student input."

one student commented in the sur
vey.
Forecast for the future
The report recommended several
short-term solutions for the current
housing crisis. They include the pur-

chase of off
campus hous
ing by the
University;
increases in
graduate
stipends
throughout
the Universi
ty; housing
subsidies for
off-campus
students;
seeking help
through fac
ulty and local
alumni to rent
rooms for stu
dents; and the
construction
af temporary

trailers and graduate housing in the
Sand Hill Road project.
The report also asked that free
off-campus listings be provided by
Community Housing Services.
Finally, the report indicated that
the current housing problems may
have a detrimental effect on gradu
ate student recruitment.
Many students surveyed said
that they are starting to warn
prospective graduate students
against coming to Stanford because
of the extremely high cost of living.
Alumni fund raising from gradu
ate students may also be affected by
the current housing problems.
Graduate students who feel aban
doned by the University are less
likely to donate money later, ac
cording to the report. This will affect
the donations individual depart
ments receive, which comes in large
part from former graduate students.
One respondent of the survey
wrote. "To put it bluntly, it's plain
the housing administrators don't
give a damn about us. That's OK.
When we're rich alumni, we will re
turn the sentiments."



Miler Lee — Daily (
A worrying picture of rapidly in
creasing rents, decreasing housing
quality and patronizing treatment
of adult students by an out-of
touch University is the main theme
of a comprehensive report on grad
uate housing by the ASSIJ. the
Graduate Student Council and the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee.
These specific concerns tie into
a larger sense of resentment and
isolation felt by graduate students
and a feeling that Stanford's ad
ministration fails to respect and ap
preciate the role of graduate stu
dents in the University community,
according to comments from the
survey.
The report is based on results of
the recent graduate housing survey
conducted on the World Wide Web
by the Graduate Student Council
and the ASSU Task Force on
Graduate Housing.

The report
addressed a
wide range of
graduate hous
ing issues, in
cluding the
quality and
quantity of
housing, park
ing spaces.

graduate resident assistants and
lack of administrative support.
lack of on-campus housing
The report expressed the deep
concern of the graduate students
on the lack of on-campus housing.
The number of applications for on
campus graduate housing in
creased in all categories in this
year's lottery. Last May. K(X) stu
dents were refused housing in the
lottery. After the waiting list as
signments. 591 single students and
126 couples remained unassigned.
The lack of on-campus housing

has forced more graduate students
to seek off-campus apartments. Ac
cording a San Jose Mercury News
article quoted in the report, there is
less than 1 percent vacancy in Santa
Clara and San Mateo counties.
Stiff competition for housing —
mostly from well-paid Silicon Val
ley employees — has caused a sharp
increase in local rents. Housing
prices in the area have gone up 35
percent over the past three years
and 20 percent over the past year.
Graduate stipends however, have
only gone up 11 percent during the
same three-year period.
According to Community Hous
ing Services, the average monthly
rent for a one-bedroom apartment
in the Peninsula is on average $3(X)

to $600 more than those in New
Haven, Conn, and $150 to $450
more than Boston.
The survey showed that Stan
ford students pay a median of $600
to $699 a month for housing. Only
Manhattan had a higher calculated
cost of living out of the areas in
which major universities are locat
ed.
The report also showed that cur
rent stipend levels place graduate
student income below the mini
mum cost of living estimated by the
Bursar's Office.
The estimated minimum budget
for a single graduate student was
$20,492 for 1997-98, while the mean
graduate income during the same
period is $16,(XX) to $16,999. This
amounts to a yearly deficit of near
ly $4,(XM). The situation is worse for
students with a spouse and children.
University support to aid students

in finding off-campus housing is also
lacking, according to the report.
However, many international stu
dents are not allowed to work he
cause of the status of their visas. Com
ments from the survey pointed to the
fact that listings provided by Com
munity Housing Services are out of
date and not comprehensive enough.
The steep housing prices have
forced some graduate students to
seek part-time jobs and accept sub
standard housing in unpleasant or
dangerous neighborhoods. In addi
tion. the report indicated that some
students are considering dropping
out of doctoral programs due to in
creased debt from living expenses.
Ninety-one percent of students
currently living on campus said they
would like to live on campus again
next year if they were eligible, ac
cording to the report. In addition,
21 percent of the students denied

housing are requesting to
come back, and an addi
tional 24 percent would do
so if not for the assumption
that they would be rejected
by the lottery.
The report recommend
ed construction of 1,000
more housing spaces for
graduate students, and
urged the University to
take a "paradigm shift" in
its approach to graduate
housing.
