# Program easing profs' retirement
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Contributing writer 
The University has seen moder
ate success in its efforts to make re
tirement a more appealing and pop
ular option for faculty through its
Faculty Incentive Program, which is
now in its fourth year.
The program was established by
the Provost's Office to not only ease
older faculty members into retire
ment. but also to create an effective
turnover rate so that more positions
are open to junior faculty.
"We hope that the program is
helpful for individuals who are re
tiring since it allows them to contin
ue teaching a bit after retirement."
said Kathryn Gillam. senior associ
ate provost for faculty affairs. "It
also provides more opportunity for
junior faculty."

The program is voluntary, and it
allows for faculty who retire be
tween the ages of 60 and 65 to re
ceive a salary bonus equal to twice
their base salary. If they retire at
age 66. the salary bonus is 1.8 times
as much. 1.5 at 67. l.Taf 6K and 0.6
Fsealty members are eligible
for the program after 15 years of
service.
"Basically, you sign an agree
ment on a completely voluntary
basis." Gillam said. "You know
then that there is a pay incentive to
retire within a particular age brack
et."
The 1994 initiation of this pro
gram replaced the University's for
mer retirement program begun in
the 19705, called the Early Incen
tive Program. It called for mandato
ry retirement at age 65, which was
later raised to 70. If a faculty mem
ber retired earlier than this, the Uni
versity would pay a retirement al
lowance from the time of retirement
to age 65.
Payments under the old program
were a fraction of the retiree's
salary, based on a comparison of the
individual's salary to professors'
median salary, while also factoring
in the length of service at Stanford.
This program had to be altered
when the tax laws changed in the
early 19905, making it difficult to
pay professors after retirement. The
mandatory retirement age also had
to be eliminated, so the Provost's

Office developed new guidelines.
The turnover rate has improved
since the program's initiation four
years ago. The University did not
have as many retirements prior to
the program's existence. In fact, re
tirements under the new program
are greater now than the sum of reg
ular retirements and those under
the old Early Incentive Program.
"It's in the University's interests
to have turnover because it brings
newer faculty in," Gillam said.
Although the turnover rate has
increased, program facilitators like
Gillam are not sure about how to
judge its success, especially since
there is no way of knowing how
many people would have retired
without the program.
"We are modestly pleased with
how it's been running," she said.

"It's safe to say that we probably
have more retirements."
Faculty response, according to
the Provost's Office, has been fairly
good, although program coordina
tors are looking to be more flexible
and make changes in the program
accordingly.
Other universities have similar
programs intact; one that has been
particularly popular is called the
"phase program," which allows for
a gradual type of retirement spaced
over a couple of years.
"Nationally, the question of fac
ulty retirement is something that a
lot of universities are talking
about," Gillam said. "A lot of differ
ent programs are available to aid
faculty members in the process,
though there's no way of knowing
which is the best."
