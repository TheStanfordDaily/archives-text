Reception for the
Publication of
Thinking Fascism:
Sapphic Modernism and
Fascist Modernity
with Discussion
and Signing by
Stanford author
Erin 6. Carlston
Thinking Fascism analyzes three works by women writers-
Djuna Barnes's Nightwood (1936), Marguerite Yourcenar's
Denier du reve (1934), and Virginia Woolf's Three Guineas
(1938) - that engage, directly or indirectly, with fascist politics
and ideology. Through these analysis, the author explores
the conjunction between fascism and other forms of moderni
ty, and refines the discussion about the relationship between
women intellectuals and the various aesthetic and ideological
practices collected under the names of modernism and fas
cism. The author argues that Western intellectuals of both
genders and all political persuasions were preoccupied in the
1930's with the commodification of culture and sexuality and
the erasure of liberal bourgeois concepts of the individual and
the work of art in mass society.
