## Indonesia in turmoil 
### 
JAKARTA. Indonesia (AP)
His nation in turmoil after a week
of deadly rioting. President Suharto
lost the support of top Parliament
allies yesterday but held onto the
all-important backing of Indone
sia's powerful military.
Parliament Speaker Harmoko
said yesterday that leaders of Par
liament's four factions would make
a joint appeal today for Suharto to
step down.
"We will urge Suharto to resign
for the integrity and the unity of the
nation," Harmoko said as more
than 3,(XM) student protesters rallied
for political change outside the Par
liament building, guarded by a cor
don of troops.
The autocratic Suharto, his
power virtually unassailable for
three decades, now finds his gov
ernment splintering, riven by the
strain of the nation's financial crisis
and ever louder demands for new
leadership.
Last week's rioting, burning and
looting over food and fuel price
increases killed at least S(X) people
in the capital and loosened Suhar
to's hold on this nation of 2(X) mil
lion people, the world's fourth
most-populous.
Yesterday, however, years of
courting military brass paid off for
Suharto, himself a retired army gen
eral. Indonesia's armed forces chief.
Gen. Wiranto. indicated at a news
conference that Suharto should stay
in power and guide the implementa
tion of political reforms.
Any transition of power should
be handled by an electoral assem
bly. Wiranto said, rejecting
Harmoko's assertion that Suharto
should heed political leaders' wish
es and quit. "Based on the constitu
tion. the statement has no legal
basis," he said.
With the backing of the 4(X).(XX)-
strong military, Suharto's authority
is secure for now despite the bloody
riots. Hundreds of thousands of stu
dents are pressing for his ouster.
"The military is the only and the

most powerful party in the coun
try," said Dr. Salim Said, an
Indonesian armed forces expert. In
fact, the military forms its own fac
tion in Parliament and dwarfs the
three civilian parties in influence.
Earlier yesterday, thousands of
students shook hands with troops
guarding Indonesia's Parliament in
a peaceful protest under the relent
less tropical sun. Some placed (low
ers in the barrels of M-16s. Others
hugged the crews of tanks and
armed personnel carriers parked
outside the legislature.
Suharto held urgent talks yester
day with his vice president and key
Cabinet ministers, while an aide
said he would respond to the parlia
mentary challenge today.
Suharto has held sway over
Indonesia for 32 years and is serv
ing his seventh five-year term,
which ends in 2(X)3. A generation of
Indonesians have never known
another president.
One of the last of the world's
great Cold War strongmen, Suharto
has repeatedly said in recent days
that it is "not a problem" for him to
step down if the people wish it.
Even though the military has
sided with him, his credibility has
been badly damaged and the nation
faces the prospect of more turmoil
Wednesday during planned anti
government rallies.
Wiranto said the demonstrations
would lead to chaos and warned
that the military would deal harshly
with rioters.
Early today, the military pres
ence had visibly increased near the
presidential palace. More armored
tanks were seen, barbed-wire road
blocks had been erected in at least
two spots and several hundred
troops were being addressed by an
officer near the palace.
Shocked students had suspended
rallies until Monday to cool tensions
after looters fed up with economic
hardship rampaged across the capi
tal, burning hundreds of cars,
motorcycles, stores and houses.
