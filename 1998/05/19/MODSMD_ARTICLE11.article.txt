# Microsoft hit with antitrust case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government filed a sweeping
antitrust case yesterday against
Microsoft Corp., saying the power
ful software company's "choke
hold" on competitors is denying
consumers important choices
about how they buy and use com
puters.
In an industry that, in this
decade, has energized the nation's
economy and revolutionized how
people work and play. Microsoft's
popular products have become an
"8(X)-pound gorilla" that suffocates
innovation and raises prices, one
state official said.
"Microsoft's actions have stifled
competition in the operating-sys
tem and browser markets," Attor
ney General Janet Reno said. "But
most importantly, it has restricted
the choices available for con
sumers."
Microsoft — whose Windows
software is used on 90 percent of
all desktop computers — fired
back, saying the case "is counter
productive, costly to the taxpayers
and ultimately will be unsuccessful
in the courts."
Among the most sensational of
the claims by the federal govern
ment and 20 states: that Microsoft
met secretly with rival Netscape
Communications Corp. in 1995 to
divide up the market for Internet
browser software — an attempt at
illegal collusion to crimp competi
tion.
In a precursor to how nasty and
personal this battle of titans could
become, Microsoft's billionaire
chairman. Bill Gates, called that
charge "an outrageous lie."
The lawsuits came on the day
that Microsoft shipped to comput
er makers the final version of Win
dows 98, the latest upgrade to its
flagship product.
The government did not try to
block yesterday's shipment, but
asked a federal judge to force

Microsoft to make broad conces
sions before the software is sold to
the public, beginning June 25.
The lawsuits' effects were felt
on Wall Street. Microsoft's stock
dropped nearly 4 percent yester
day in extremely heavy trading,
down 3 3/8 to close at 86 1/16. The
value of Gates' own holdings fell
by $1.8 billion.
The antitrust case, in the form
of dual, separate-but-similar feder
al lawsuits from the Justice
Department and the states, focuses
almost exclusively on Microsoft's
agreements with other companies,
since more than two-thirds of all
copies of Windows 98 are expected
to be sold through computer mak
ers.
The first hearings in the case
were scheduled for Friday.
Among other things, the law
suits accuse Microsoft of:
•Requiring computer makers to
install Microsoft's Internet brows
er as a condition of selling Win
dows 98. The government claims
that's illegal "tying" of separate
products, but Microsoft contends
its browser is "integrated." which
is allowed.
As a remedy, the government
asked a federal judge to order
Microsoft to remove its browser
from Windows 98 or include a
copy of rival Netscape's, a condi
tion that particularly rankled
Microsoft.
"As long as they have that as
one of their demands, we are
going to need to resolve it in the
courts." Gates said, adding that
during the high-stakes negotia
tions that collapsed over the week
end, "the words out of their mouth
were always Netscape this.
Netscape that. If you can't prove
that you're going to really hurt
your market position in a dramat
ic way. then we're not interested.'"
•Requiring computer makers
to agree to a uniform startup pro

cedure that doesn't give them
flexibility to customize the wa\
that people run software applica
tions under Windows.
•Entering into agreements
with major Internet companies to
offer Microsoft's browser "pri
marily or exclusively." whi '.urt

the market for Netscape.
The government's case is part
ly base J on the words of
Microsoft's top executives,
including ( intes. w hose electronic
messages and memorandums
were handed over under civil sub
poena.
