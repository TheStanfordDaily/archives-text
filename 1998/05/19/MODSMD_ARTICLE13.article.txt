SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill yes
terday giving school districts broad
freedom to select any approach to
bilingual education that works
and endorsed a pending statewide
ballot initiative that would teach
immigrant children almost exclusive
ly in English.
"Bilingual education in California
has been a serious failure," Wilson
wrote in vetoing the bill. "(The bill]
fails to provide much hope of
improvement."
But the backers of Proposition
227 on the June 2 ballot were less
than thrilled to have the support ol
the Republican governor.
Wilson alienated many immi
grants with his support of Proposi
tion IS7, a IW ballot measure deny

ing most social services to illegal
immigrants. In contrast, recent polls
find Proposition 227 supported by
about half of the Latino households
surveyed.
'it is very unfortunate that the
governor has chosen to endorse our
initiative said Ron Unz, author ot
Proposition 227.
"It would be grossly opportunistic
and deceitful if our opponents seized
on Wilson's endorsement to attempt
to discredit those of us ... who have
worked so hard over past year to
improve the public education of ( al
ifornia's immigrant children," Unz
said.
The bill by state Sen. Dede
Alport. D-Coronado, was intended
as an alternative to Proposition 227.
The ballot measure would require

that the 1.3 million "limited English
proficient" children in California to
be educated almost exclusively in
English.
Schools would offer a one-year
transition class, after which the stu
dents would be placed in regular
classes.
The current system — which
teaches primarily in children's first
language and gradually introduces
English — would be scrapped,
although parents could keep their
children in bilingual programs under
certain circumstances.
"This veto is simply shortsight
ed." Alpert said. "Yes. some of these
children will survive academically,
and anecdotal evidence will be that
one or two may even excel. Hut Uxi
many will fall behind."
