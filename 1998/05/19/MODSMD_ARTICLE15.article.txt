TV debates not inclusive
WASHINGTON (AP) The Supreme ( ourt. in
a sweeping endorsement of broadcasters free
speech rights and journalistic discretion, ruled yes
terday that even public stations owned and run b\
states need not invite marginal candidates to political
debates they sponsor.
"Were it faced with the prospect of cacophony on
the one hand and First Amendment liability on the
other, the public television broadcaster might choose
not to air candidates' views at all. Justice Anthony
M Kennedy wrote for the court.
The 6-3 ruling freed an Arkansas educational
television network from any liability for not inviting
a fringe congressional candidate to a TV
debate.
"When a public broadcaster exercises editorial
discretion in the selection and presentation of its pro
gramming. it engages in speech activity." Kennedy
said.
