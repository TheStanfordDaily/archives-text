University should make
Jasper Ridge more
accesible to the public

TIHE OPENING OF Jasper
Ridge Wilderness Preserve on
Sunday May 17 was an event
that should not go unnoticed or unre
pealed. The overwhelming number of
people visiting the preserve on its first
day open to the public in 25 years tes
tifies to its popularity and usefulness to
the Stanford community.
The 1100 acres that make up Jasper
Jtave been an outdoor class
room for the University since 1891,
anfl ctfif£ntfy serves as a natural labo
ratory for over 50 research projects for
scientists world-wide. The preserve is
home to several endangered species,
rare plant species, and a serpentine
grassland.
Nevertheless, many students are
unaware of the resources that Jasper
Ridge has to offer. While the preserve
is open for prearranged guided tours
and class trips, it has been primarily
used by researchers and visiting scien
tists since 1973. By increasing the num
ber of events and tours open to the
public, Jasper Ridge could become a
more visible educational resource.
Once a quarter, the preserve should
be available for any interested stu
dents and community members to tour
and visit. The openings should be well
publicized and easily accessible, like
Sunday's event.
The main concern with increased

public access to Jasper Ridge is that
visitors will disrupt research projects.
Nearly 2(X) students have completed
theses based at least partially on
research done at Jasper Ridge.
Noticeable signposts and strcitly
guided tours could be a viable solution
to these concerns. These measures
would prevent visitors from interfering
with scientific investigations.
At present, future researchers
might conclude their Stanford career
without ever having heard of Jasper
Ridge.
Preserve officials are concerned
that there will not be sufficient volun
teers to conduct more tours. Volunteer
docents must go through a vigorous
two-quarter course taught by Stanford
faculty incorporating biology, botany,
geology, and anthropology. There are
currently 90 available docents.
More public tours, however, would
certainly attract students interested in
becoming paid docents. This would
create more student jobs and increase
the number of people available to help
out during open houses and guided
tours.
While Jasper Ridge is first and fore
most a research area, with attention
and care, university officials could
make it more accessible and valuable
to students.
There are only a handful of compa
rable reserves in the country, and
Jasper Ridge attracts numerous schol
ars to Stanford. The university has a
responsibility to make sure that stu
dents know about the tremendous
opportunities that lie within their own
backyard.
