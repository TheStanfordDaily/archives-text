						Message for the Class of '98 
### 
NOW THAT I'VE
finally learned
how to navigate
my way around Stanford -
the "dos" and "don'ts" of
Dining Services, the
virtues of the Courier font,
the location of the "Secret
Safeway" - the university

is preparing to kick me out the door.
As I get ready to say my good-byes to my
home here, I was recently reminded of a sim
ilar departure: my high school graduation.
Asked to write a few words to the graduating
class of Oak Hall High (forty-two students
strong, nestled in the humid clime of
Gainesville, Florida) this is the best I could
come up with:
"No doubt you have already been sub
jected to a barrage of commencement
advice. Follow your dreams. Seize the day.
Maybe the valedictorian and guest speaker
quoted Jackie Robinson or Robert Frost,
possibly Thoreau.
"You are the first generation of the new
millennium, the hope for a new America and
the emerging leaders of the world... now
drive safely and party responsibly. My grad
uating class will be told much the same thing
four years later.
"I don't want to merely echo these senti
ments. They have their place at every defin
ing moment in one's life. After leaving
school I fully intend to continue following
my dreams and live each moment to its
fullest. Who wouldn't? Let me instead offer

you some more practical advice about your
next four years, suggestions that I wish 1 had
been told before I came to college.
"Have convictions and share them with
others. Learn why you think the way that
you do. Jettison those convictions that no
longer make sense. Allow yourself to be
wrong. Those who receive the least from
college are the ones who have convinced
{hemselves that they have nothing new to
learn.
"Actively search for people who are dif
ferent from yourself. Universities are as
socially narrow as you choose to make them,
and your friends will ultimately determine
who and what you are exposed to. Read
voraciously. Read books that aren't on the
syllabus.
"Prepare to have your expectations shat
tered. Know that the pieces rarely fit back
together. Raise your hand in a crowded lec
ture hall. Ask the questions that others are
afraid to ask. Clamor for attention.
"Remember that you live in a capitalistic
society which continues to revolve around
the almighty dollar. Try your hardest not to
forget that there are other ways to organize
your interactions with others. Don't con
sume mindlessly.
"Become aware of the effects your
actions have upon the people around you.
Be proactive without becoming ruthless, crit
ical without becoming cynical. Cynics are a
dime a dozen and rarely accomplish any
thing.
"Pragmatism is the most prevalent form

of fundamentalism on campus, and for that
reason, the most pernicious. Too many stu
dents approach their college education as if
they were trying to get the best return upon
an investment. Use the next four years as
something other than a vehicle for making
money.
"Under the same rules, your university
may treat you more like a product that a per
son, spinning you through the gears of a pre
ordained system. Refuse these expectations,
lest you sacrifice meaning for sheer value.
"There are plenty of other things to tell.
Learn to separate your colors and your
whites when doing laundry. Learn to he
entertained, and be entertaining, without the
assistance of alcohol. Take risks.
"I could go on like this interminably...
your commencement speaker probably
already has. In all likelihtxxl you'll come to
many of these same realizations on your
own. Enjoy that process of discovery. If you
do, the next four years will change your life
forever.
"I'm leaving college knowing I have seen
very little of the world around me. Not much,
yet seemingly everything, has changed since
I began my tenure here. 1 wish you the same
luck, the same joy, the same heartache."
Best wishes, class of '98. Gtxxl luck trying
to get it right.
