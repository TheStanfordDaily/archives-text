# Alumni merger set
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
The Stanford Alumni Association Board
of Directors voted unanimously Saturday to
become part of the University, changing the
independent status the association has held
for the past 106 years. The merger, which will
create an alumni division within the Univer
sity, will he put to a final vote by the associa
tion's 72,(KK) members this summer.
The change— expected to be complete in
September— should bring the association
several million dollars of additional annual
revenue from the University.
As a result of the merger, the association
hopes to enact new programs, including in
creased opportunities for alumni volunteers,
expanded on-line services and enhanced
alumni education offerings.
"This merger came about as a conclusion
of three or four different studies that showed
us that there weren't enough ways for alum
ni to get involved except by writing checks."
said association President Bill Stone . "We
found that we underserve alumni because we
let the University off the hook."
Under the new system. Stone would re
port to University President Gerhard
Casper, and his position would be equivalent
to that of a university vice president.

Rich Jaroslovskv. chair of the association
Board of Directors, emphasized the prob
lems the association has experienced while
separate from the University.
"As time has gone on. a number of us have
grown increasingly frustrated with the legal
complexity of being two separate entities,"
he said. "From a practical standpoint, we
have always been one."
According to Jaroslovskv. the merger
vote came after protracted discussion by the
board.
"One hundred years of tradition demand
ed that we have a full and extremely lengthy
debate," he said.
In a press release issued yesterday, Casper
said. "I am delighted by the alumni associa
tion board's vote, which reflects our common
desire to do a more effective job in alumni re
lations."
This merger comes as the association, cur
rently housed in Bowman Alumni House,
makes plans to construct a new building.
"We've just hit a wall in terms of space."
said Jaroslovsky. "There are a number of
programs we've wanted to start up in the past
few years that Bowman hasn't allowed us the
physical space to carry out."
The new building, which will be paid for by
donations, has concept approval from the
Board of Directors. No location has yet been
chosen, but the association hopes to break
ground on campus by the end of IWB, ac
cording to Stone.
The merger will also affect the organiza
tional structure of Stanford Magazine, a bi
monthly publication currently produced

jointly by the association and the Stanford
News Service. Under the new system, the
magazine will be published under the newly
formed alumni division.
"The magazine will continue to provide
news of the campus, but we will now do it
under one organization rather than two," said
Stanford Magazine Editor Bob Cohn.
