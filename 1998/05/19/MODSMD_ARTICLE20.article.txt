Administration neglected
graduate housing
I would like to respond to the statke
ment made by Provost Rice in the May 18
article "Housing Blues."
First, Provost Rice stated, "Nobody
expected this steep rise in rental prices cou
pled with low inventory." This is false. Last
year's CARE survey pointed to housing as
a major problem in this area, and statistics
from the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) show that rental
prices have been increasing in this area
since 1980.
The Stanford administration has chosen
to ignore the graduate housing situation
until very recently; the ASSU Task Force
on Graduate Housing believes they have
been irresponsible in this respect. The
administration will argue that they just
completed construction on two new gradu
ate housing complexes.
This is true, but if you count the number
of spaces lost by the destruction of the Man
zanita Trailer Park, the new buildings do
not provide a net gain in spaces.
Due to their lack of action and short
sighted planning, the administration was
forced to develop undesirable short-term
solutions to the graduate housing crunch.
They do not plan to build enough to allow

all single grad students who want to live on
campus to have their own bedroom.
The Task Force believes that the univer
sity should set a one bedroom, one person
standard of living for single graduate stu
dents. This is a reasonable request when
you consider that most upper-class under
graduates at Stanford have single rooms.
Second, Provost Rice stated, "we have
also significantly raised stipends this year."
This statement implies a much more gener
ous move than what actually has taken
place. Minimum stipend levels have been
raised, which affects only the students who
receive a stipend from the university at the
minimum level.
Considering that the minimum stipend
level is around $1(),(XK) and that the Bursar's
Office estimates the annual cost of living at
$20,(XX), this is hardly sufficient. Plus, the
many graduate students who are paid by
outside fellowships or who belong to
departments which pay higher than the
minimum stipend will not benefit from this
change.
The Task Force hopes to be able to meet
with Provost Rice to discuss reasonable
solutions to the housing crisis.

Graduate students nation
wide fight for recognition
As someone who spent far too many
years as a doctoral student at Yale Univer
sity, I wish to add my own perspective to the
debate about graduate student housing at
Stanford.
For many years at Yale, graduate stu
dents were subjected to a series of daily
indignities by the school administration.
Over time, these small but significant
affronts came to seem like nothing less than
an insidious means of creating a two-tiered
system of citizenship at the school: one for
privileged undergraduates and tenured fac
ulty, the other for those who were meant to
be seen and not heard.
Eventually, graduate students at Yale
took a course of action to which second
class citizens are fully entitled: they orga
nized politically to fight the corrosive,
patronizing attitude of the administration
and to improve the circumstances of their
lives through collective action.
Through their organizing experience
activists at Yale came to focus the terms of
debate about graduate student issues above
all on the status of teaching as work. In par
ticular, they came to understand the central
role that graduate students played as teach
ers within the university and to emphasize

that without their labor, the school simply
could not function.
It seems to me that graduate students at
Stanford and those at Yale have something
in common. No matter what the good inten
tions of individual administrators - and I
certainly would not advocate letting any of
them off the hook of condemnation - the
fact of the housing crisis for graduate stu
dents here is just one local event in a nation
al transformation in the conditions of
employment for graduate teachers.
Like the related transformation in condi
tions of employment for clerical and other
staff members at all universities, including
Stanford, this is a situation that all ethically
concerned people, no matter what their pol
itics, should vigorously opposose.
