# Showering with the boys
## Impressing his mom: must be the shower 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

I HAVE BEEN on my best behavior for
almost three weeks. For a full twenty
plus days, I have been hosting a parental
parade. Three parents. Three weeks.
Parents number one and three were pret
ty easy because they are mine and I love
them. Plus, they're quick for old folks.
They know that my car usually isn't
washed and my bed is never made. They
know that I put my elbows on the table and
that I am predisposed to occasionally using
less than kosher four-letter words. Any
efforts I make to feign manners or attempt
cleanliness is appreciated but they are wise to
my ways.
They have been around the block a few
times, 7439 times to be exact. And apparent
ly they are quite fond of me because they just
keep coming back for more.
I tend to see this as adoration.
I am pretty sure they tend to see this as
following the maturation of a rather large
investment. They have put so much time and
money into me, especially these last three
years, that they'll be damned if they don't get
seats for the whole show.

I think my parents have been a little curi
ous about how I spend my time. After all,
they are helping to shell out some serious
cash for me to take less classes than naps. I
think they are interested to see just how I am
occupying my oodles of free time.
So, Mom came out three weeks ago. Dad
arrived yesterday.
Both are quite welcome anytime. I am
fortunate beyond all reasonable hope to
have amazing relationships with both par
ents. Mom and I hiked in the foothills and
cavorted in the city. Dad and I talked for
hours over great Mexican food and managed
to do away with a pitcher of Margaritas.
Although I seemed to have convinced
two parents that my life indeed is this good, I
still was left with one more parent to please,
the illusive number three: my boyfriend's
mother.
"Oh dear," is right. Always a touch scary.
She has heard about you, you about her. But
in living person, you are forced to perform.
On your best behavior. No elbows. No
swearing.
And you have to like her because she

comes with the object of your affection. One
with the other. Like Jagerrneister and a
hangover.
She, on the other hand, is under no obli
gation to like you even the least little bit. She
has seen others come and go at the drop of
the hat. She knows you are not the first
woman. She may even hope you are not the
last.
So, with some apprehension, I met his
mom for dinner. 1 brushed my hair and wore
clean clothes. I kept my elbows at my side
and answered questions as eloquently as pos
sible, managing not to say anything particu
larly ridiculous or offensive.
I was actually quite proud of myself.
But the true test was to come. Of me and
my space. Of her and her standards of clean
liness.
1 agreed to let his mom stay in my room.
In fact I think I may have volunteered it. For
some reason, my idealistic little noggin
blocked out the co-ed showers, pot smoke,
and rats in the kitchen. But, as I tromped off
to stay on a friend's futon, letting his mom
have her own space somehow didn't seem

like such a bright idea anymore.
So, I did the only thing I could to prevent
long-lasting damage — I cleaned. I put alco
hol in the closet and swept the dirt under the
couch. I put my clothes in drawers and books
on the shelves. And with clean sheets and
washed wood floors. Mom Number Two
descended upon my little co-op single.
And let me tell you, she fared damn well.
She fiercely protected her toothpaste
from the Monday clean crew determined to
use it in a toothpaste shrine and assertively
claimed her own 6AM shower time — not
that it was in high demand.
She didn't complain about the never-end
ing Grateful Dead played about the house
nor the hairball the size of a small cat in the
shower.
That made quite an impression. I'll admit.
I liked her as soon as 1 met her but. watching
her resiliency, I was awed. Truly a woman of
my own kind. Undaunted by dirt. Unfazed
by fUth.
I wonder if I lived up to her standards. 1
left my bag of house condoms on the shelf,
and I playfully called a long-absent friend a

"shithead" in her presence.
To make matters worse, she informed me
that she was also checking me out for the
extended family Apparently my boyfriend's
eight-year old cousin, Kevin, devised a
check-list of standards I was to fulfill.
I had to be nice and pretty. Fun and smart
too. And I had to have g(xxl manners, so 1
was to be watched at meal time. Lastly, I had
to be willing to pnxrreate. (Kevin thought
that my boyfriend really wanted at least one
kid — that was news to my boyfriend.)
Considering Kevin's lofty standards, I am
a little nervous about my success in my quest
to impress, but I tried.
So 1 don't know if his mom liked me as
much as mine liked him. but. to be fair, mine
bunked in the faculty club.
Come to think of it. Dad doesn't have a
place to stay tomorrow night.. .maybe I'll
send him over to my boyfriend's place.

music. She is sorry the boys lost their shit, but
reminds them that wily chipmunks gather
nuts.
