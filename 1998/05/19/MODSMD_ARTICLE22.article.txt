## Regional is set Dangerous Tide's rolling in 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
Following a season as the wire-to
wire No. 1 squad in the nation, the
Stanford baseball team anxiously
awaited the announcement of the
NCAA Tournament's Regional as
signments, hoping to be rewarded
with an easy draw.
Now the brackets are in, and con
sidering the presence of Alabama in
its region, the Cardinal's path to the
College World Series will not be as
easy as expected.
The pairings for the West Region
al, to be held for the third-consecu
tive year at Stanford's Sunken Dia
mond May 21-24, were announced
yesterday at noon on ESPN.
The top-seeded Cardinal (41-12-
1) will play host to the second-seed
ed Crimson Tide(43-16) and third
seed Long Beach State (37-20-1).
North Carolina State (39-2-1) will be
the No. 4 seed and Minnesota (45-
13) the fifth, while Loyola-Mary
mount (33-21-1) rounds out the Re
gional in the sixth seed.
"This is an extremely difficult re
gional," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess.
"Both ourselves and Alabama
made it to the College World Series
last season and the other four schools
are more than capable of advancing
to Omaha," Marquess said.
Alabama, which finished second
to defending national champion
Louisiana State in the Southeast

Conference West Division, will be
making a school-record fourth
straight regional appearance.
Along with Stanford, the Crim
son Tide reached the Final Four of
last season s CWS before falling to
LSIJ in the championship game.
Long Beach State, the Big West
Conference tournament champion,
will be making its eighth-consecutive
regional appearance, while the less
experienced Loyola Marymount
Lions feature a young pitching staff
and solid hitting.
The No. 1 seed will be a key ad
vantage in the double-elimination
tournament as the Cardinal will face
the weaker Lions Thursday at 7 p.m.
The winner of that game will face
the loser of Thursday's 11 a.ni match
between the 49ers of Long Beach
State and North Carolina State.
The NCAA awarded 48 postsea
son berths overall yesterday, half of
which were automatic bids. The re
mainder came from at-large invita
tions.
Unlike last season, Stanford has
not faced any of the squads who will
visit Sunken Diamond this weekend.
"Really, we know nothing about
any of these teams," Marquess said.
"We haven't played any of these
teams in a long time.
"We're kind of going in blind.
When you go in like this, 1 tend to
focus more on our guys. We can try
and get some scouting reports, but a
lot of times you don't learn that
much."

Three teams from the Pacific 10
Conference's Southern Division re
ceived regional berths: Stanford,
USC and Arizona State.
The top-seeded Trojans will be
shipped across the country to the
East Regional, where they could
eventually meet perennially strong
Clemson.
The third-seeded Sun Devils will
journey to the Midwest Regional
where they will face off against

Arkansas.
Washington, who upset the Car
dinal this past weekend to clinch the
Pac-10 Championships, was award
ed a third seed in the Central Region.
Heralded as potentially the toughest
regional, the Huskies will have to
overturn top-seeded Rice (45-15).
The champions of each of the
eight NCAA Regionals will advance
to the College World Series, held
May 29-June 6 in Omaha, Neb.
