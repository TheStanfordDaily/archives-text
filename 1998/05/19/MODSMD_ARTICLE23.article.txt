Heading into the Pacific 10 and
Pacific Coast Rowing Champi
onships, the Stanford crew team
had high hopes to qualify for na
tionals. Unfortunately, its dreams
were left in the wake of a strong con
ference.
Despite not qualifying, the team
has come far this year and is not at
all disappointed with its season.
Saturday, the second women's
novice crew competed at the Pacific
Coast Rowing Championships and
placed second behind UC-Davis.

"Our technique was not the best
since we were not in our usual boat,
but I felt like we were really power
ful," said freshman Laurie Mason.
"Overall we're pleased with our
performance."
The rest of the Cardinal compet
ed Sunday at Pac-lOs, held in Sacra
mento at Lake Natoma.
Both the men's varsity and junior
varsity finished fourth in the cham
pionships. The top four finishers in
each division were identical.
"We had a great race and every
one gave it their all. there is no ques
tion about that," said captain Jamie
MacQuarrie, a senior. "1 think that

we are a stronger team and it was an
unfortunate turn of events that we
couldn't pull together at the end and
take third."
In the men's varsity Grand Final,
Stanford was nearly able to post a
third place finish, but was pushed
out by Oregon State.
"It was a real controlled race,"
said senior Matt Jollev. "It was very
close, but Oregon State pulled out
for third. California and Washing
ton are kind of out of our league."
Cal and Washington finished
first and second in the race, respec
tively.
The men's novice boat took first

in the Third Final after finishing
fifth in its heat. Fifth plaee was not
high enough to put the Cardinal
boat into the Grand Final Race.
All three women's boats placed
in the top three in their heats, so
each moved on to the Grand Final.
The varsity and novice boats fin
ished sixth and the junior varsity
boat took fifth place.
In its heat, the varsity boat took
second, edging out UC-Davis on its
path to the Grand Final.
"We pulled away [from Davis] in
the second I.(KK) meters." said cap
