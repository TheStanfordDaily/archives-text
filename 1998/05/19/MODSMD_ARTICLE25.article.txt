### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
Saturday's Cardinal Qualifier
proved an excellent primer for next
week's PacificlO Conference
Championships, as Stanford ath
letes took advantage of their final
chance to qualify for the champi
onship by establishing top marks —
including a pair of new school
records.
Though the events were un
scored. Stanford's men and women
dominated much of the meet and
gave Pac-10 rivals Washington
State. California Arizona a small
taste of what to expect next week.
The pole vault was one of the
most exciting events of the night as
both men's and women's teams en
joyed great success.
Sophomore Toby Stevenson and
freshman Melissa Feinstein both es
tablished new schcxil records in the
event.
Feinstein demolished the old
school record, vaulting into the
number three spot in the nation
with a leap of 12 feet 7 1/4 inches,
while Stevenson launched over 17
feet 10 1/2 inches to beat his own
school record by 1 3/4 inches.
Freshman Todd Beyerlein cap
tured first place in the high jump,
arching his body over the bar at a
height of 6 feet 11 3/4 inches.
On the track, senior Monal
Chokshi celebrated one of her last
races as a member of the Cardinal
squad by surging from behind to
chase down the leaders in the
women's 15(X) meter run.
Although she appeared to be a

non-factor for much of the run.
Chokshi was actually exacting a
smart tactical race, using her torrid
kick in the final lap to chase down
runners who had spent their energy
too soon.
Chokshi crossed the finish line in
4 minutes. 20.45 seconds, good
enough for third place.
Her time, a personal best, is an
NCAA provisional qualifier and
may be good enough to usher her
into the national meet.
Sophomore workhorse Michael
Stember followed Chokshi's lead in
the men's 15(X). challenging former
NCAA champions Niall Bruton
(1500) and Pascal Dobert (steeple
chase), and Kenyan Luke Kip
koskei for top honors.
Stember. who has been nagged
by a hamstring problem for most of
the season, conserved energy in the
early laps of the race by running in
the middle of the pack for much of
the way.
"I knew the race would take care
of itself." Stember said. "I knew the
guys would keep the pace quick and
honest."
With one lap to go. Stember
blitzed the field. Surging past seven
runners. Stember took Dobert by
surprise and closed on Bruton in the
final 100 meters, almost catching
him before the stripe.
Stember finished third with a
personal best time of 3:41.99. sec
onds behind Bruton and Kipkoskei.
who ran awav from the field earlv in
the race to finish first.
Stember threw his hands up in
celebration upon crossing the
stripe.
"I shouldn't have let the leaders

get so far out ahead of me," Stember
said. But. according to Stember,
"the goal was to qualify and to take
one little step in the right direction."
Other track bright spots included
freshman Sally Glynn's improved
3.(XX) qualifying time of 9:26.2 in a

second-place effort and freshman
Gabe Jennings' solid second-place
showing in the 8(H), where he ran a
personal best time of 1:47.98, beat
ing out Arkansas top-dog Seneca
Lassiter (1:48.24).
Jennings also dropped time off

his provisional qualifier.
The women's ever-dominant
throwing unit was at it again, as
sophomores Summer Pierson and
Cassie Romuld took first and sec
ond in the discus with throws of 163-
10 and 156-6, respectively.

Romuld was also second in the
shot put (46-0) and sophomore Alli
son Beatty took third in the javelin
(138-6).
With these strong performances
under their belts, the Cardinal
squads will now head into the Pac-10

meet with victories on their minds.
Pac-l()s will begin Saturday at
Stanford's Cobb Track and Angell
Field, with finals in many field and
distance events beginning at 1 p.m.
All other finals will be contested on
Sundav.
