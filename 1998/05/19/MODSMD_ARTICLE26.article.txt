WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: Santa Clara 2, Stanford 1

women's soccer team gave national
power Santa Clara a tough mateh be
fore falling 2-1 in Friday's home
game.
"It was a great game for us," said
Stanford head coach Steve Swanson.
"They're definitely one of the top
teams in the country and playing

against them, you don't get any false
impressions from weak competition.
It let us know that we aren't that far
away from where we want to be."
As a measuring stick, the Broncos
provided a demanding comparison.
Santa Clara advanced to the Final
Four in last year's NCAA Tourna
ment. nearly knocking off eventual
champ North Carolina. This year's
squad looks to be no less dominant.
"They'll be one of the favorites
this year." Swanson said. "They don't
have many weaknesses. They press
hard and move the ball really well."
In the framework of the spnng
season. Friday's game gave the
Cardinal a glimpse of its strengths
and weaknesses.
"It was nice from an evalutation
standpoint," Swan son said. "Ihere
were a lot of things we did well and a
few things we need to work on too.
That's exactly what we expect out of a
spring game."
However, the spring schedule
training role didn't prevent the squad
from throwing everything at the
Broncos.
"We always have strong rivalry
with Santa Clara, whether we play in
the spring, summer or during the reg
ular season," Swanson said. "The in
tensity was definitely there."
Stanford may have fared slightly
better had it enjoyed the luxury of a
complete roster. Several players who
would normally fill key roles on the
team are out of action for reasons
ranging from injury to other athletic
endeavors.
The Cardinal found itself rather
thin at the midfield position, with
three of its top players absent. Junior
Trayce Lawyer was around on the
Farm, but had her hands full winning
the Pacific 10 heptathalon title.
Sophomore Ronnie Fair and junior
co-captain Christy Stoffel were both
truly absent. Fair travelling with the
U.S. national team and Stoffel study
ing abroad in Oxford, England.
"It's always good to have every
one healthy and playing, but we've
been productive this spring even
with a few missing pieces," Swanson
said.
Coming out of the Santa Clara
contest, Swanson finds praise for
the team's defensive organization
and shape, but looks to see improve

ment in consistency and pressure.
"There were lots of good things,
but our individual defending
broke down a little." he said, 'it takes
a team effort and we need to help
each other out a little more.
"It was really good to face Santa
Clara because thev aren't

going to cough the ball up just be
cause the defender gets around
them."
For Stanford, the spring games
have been a continual effort of sharp
ening skills and experimenting with
the lineup. Friday night's matchup
displayed that work in progress.


Kwesi Leggett — Daily
Senior Rita Hermiz threads the needle between two USC defenders
last month. Last Saturday, Stanford gained valuable experience as
it fell to the Santa Clara Broncos 2-1. Next up for the squad is a boys
team from Europe.
