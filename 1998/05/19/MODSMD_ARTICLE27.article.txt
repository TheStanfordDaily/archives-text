# Change in the wishing Wells
## "Perfect" Yankee pitcher doesn't compare to old greats 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Until Sunday. I thought of perfect games as mythical beings.
It was Sunday when — as I'm sure you've heard — a young, ob
scure Yankee rebel named David Wells became the 15th pitcher ever
to pitch a perfect game over the 120-year history of baseball.
But the picture on the front of the New York Times yesterday was
decidedly un-mvthical.
It showed Wells jumping for joy. hauling his Harley Davidson
girth into the air and yelling w hat I imagined to be a throaty, gurgling
moan of delight.

Inside the paper, the New York Times had a few articles compar
ing this newly-crowned miniem-day hero to Don Larson, the last
Yankee to pitch a perfect game.
Larson turned the trick 42 years ago. against the then-Brooklyn
Dodgers in the 1956 World Series.
But for some reason, the comparison between Larson and Wells
turned sour in my mouth. I had always thought of Larson's perfect
game as an incredible moment in time, as if a magical flash of light de
scended from the clouds above as he got the last out.
Why did I feel so differently about Wells' perfect game? They
both retired 27 straight batters. Both didn't give up any hits or walks.
Why do the old stories seem so much greater than the new ones?
