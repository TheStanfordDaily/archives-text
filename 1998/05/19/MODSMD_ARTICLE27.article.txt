# Change in the wishing Wells
## "Perfect" Yankee pitcher doesn't compare to old greats 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
Until Sunday. I thought of perfect games as mythical beings.
It was Sunday when — as I'm sure you've heard — a young, ob
scure Yankee rebel named David Wells became the 15th pitcher ever
to pitch a perfect game over the 120-year history of baseball.
But the picture on the front of the New York Times yesterday was
decidedly un-mvthical.
It showed Wells jumping for joy. hauling his Harley Davidson
girth into the air and yelling w hat I imagined to be a throaty, gurgling
moan of delight.

Inside the paper, the New York Times had a few articles compar
ing this newly-crowned miniem-day hero to Don Larson, the last
Yankee to pitch a perfect game.
Larson turned the trick 42 years ago. against the then-Brooklyn
Dodgers in the 1956 World Series.
But for some reason, the comparison between Larson and Wells
turned sour in my mouth. I had always thought of Larson's perfect
game as an incredible moment in time, as if a magical flash of light de
scended from the clouds above as he got the last out.
Why did I feel so differently about Wells' perfect game? They
both retired 27 straight batters. Both didn't give up any hits or walks.
Why do the old stories seem so much greater than the new ones?
The myth of Muhammad Ali

could slog through all of the commercials and corporate sponsor-

ships and find some genuine mo
ments.
One of those was the lighting of
the Olympic torch by Muhammad
Ali, a man who many consider the
greatest American athlete ever.
But stricken with Parkinson's
disease, Ali's perpetually quiver
ing hand could barely grip his fiery
torch. Shaking, he made his way
over to the Olympic to light it.
On television, the picture
flashed to show Bill Clinton. The
president was crying.
He wasn't the only one. For
most Americans, it was an emo
tional moment. It touched my par
ents and my friends' parents.
But 1 didn't really understand
then, and realize now that I might
never.
For members of our parents'
generation, Ali wasn't just an ath
lete — he was a legend.
He was athleticism, mystery,
and romanticism personified. He
had everything that David Wells
doesn't.
For starters, he had an incredi
ble athletic ability. But it was his
mythical quality that gave him an
untouchable position in so many
hearts.
There is an aura surrounding
him, one that implies that you
might get close but you will never
understand.
You might reach out but you
will never grasp him.
For instance. Ali spoke only in
iambic pentameter. You remem
ber, "Float like a butterfly, sting
like a bee?" Count 'em, 10 sylla
bles.

Then there was the time when,
in 1%4, complaining of rampant
racism in America, he dropped his
Olympic gold medal into the Ohio
River, explaining simply, "the gold
was wearing off."
Off of the medal? Or off of the
American dream? I've never heard
of gold wearing off Olympic
medals.
Simpleton or genius?
Metaphorical or a dunce? One can
start to sense the mythical haze
that surrounds him and the roman
tic feeling that gives way to idola
try.
And we can start to see why our
parents cry when, weakened by
disease, the mythical hero can
barely hold onto an Olympic torch.
Today's Muhammad
The point is that David Wells,
our perfect-game pitcher, is sup
posed to be the Ali of today.
Likewise, Barry Bonds is sup
posed to be yesterday's Willie
Mays — but Mays never failed to
pay child support.
Even Michael Jordan, perhaps
the best basketball player ever,
doesn't seem so mythical after he
hawks his cologne on television.
It seems that today's athletes
are missing something that our
parents' athletes had, and I'm not
sure what — or why — it is.
But perhaps it's just years that
turn people into romantic icons. If
so, in 50 years the Yankees' Wells
might seem as romantic and myth
ic as Ali does to us.
A romantic genius? The New
York Times quoted Wells as say
ing. "I wish my mom could have
saw that."
It isn't exactly iambic pentame
ter.
