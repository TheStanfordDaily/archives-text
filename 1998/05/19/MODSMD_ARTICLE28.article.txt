# Negative body image and too much exercise a problem on campus
## Students suffer eating disorders 
### ARt Diaz Contributing writer 
On a campus where going to the gym is
a favorite past time, its hard to believe that
anyone would gain the notorious freshman
15. What's even harder to believe is that a
considerably large portion of the Stanford
community has a problem with its body
image.
But according to the Body Image. Food
and Self Esteem Group, body image prob
lems are far too common among the Stan
ford community.
I he organization's co-president, senior
Karen Fel/er. said. "A 1993 student health
survey found a v ast majority of students of
both the graduate and undergraduate
community are the exact bodv weight they

should be. At the same time, 80 percent of
female undergraduates and 50 percent of
male undergraduates don't think that their
body weight is acceptable.
"People who have eating disorders tend
to be perfectionists; that's why you'll find
that eating disorders are extremely com
mon on college campuses," said Felzer.
But this type of thinking is by no means
a phenomenon reserved for college stu
dents. On the national level, a quarter of
all women think their eating is out of con
trol.
One senior, Paul (who asked that his
name be changed to protect his privacy),
felt his eating disorder was out of control.
He recalls the summer before his sopho
more year in high school in which he went
from 180 pounds to 120 pounds in two
months.
Paul states that he is one of the males
who breaks the stereotype that only fe
males have eating disorders.
"1 transposed a lot of my issues onto my
weight. I just kept telling myself that when
I lose weight, everything is going to be
fine," Paul explained.
Paul was dealing with issues of sexuali
ty. self-esteem and identity. He also saw
his parents' lifestyle give them happiness,
and according to Paul "I wanted to some
how fulfill the roles that my parents lived."
He lost weight by going on a strict diet
and running excessively. Before his disor
der. Paul used to eat a 20-piece chicken
nugget meal, large french fries and a Big
Mac for lunch. When the summer came,
however, he would eat one Saltine cracker
for every mile he ran in 90 degree weather.
A whole summer of similar eating habits
and strenuous exercise caused him to drop
to a weight of 110 pounds, remarkably low
for his height of 5'9".
Running became a daily priority, as he
eventually got to the point where he was
running five miles a day. His running got to
such an extreme state that his muscle tissue
started to break down. In later examina
tions. Paul found out that his abdominal
tissues were seriously damaged.
"At first I was happv with the with the

way 1 was looking and I didn't realize how
caught up I was in my weight. This was
more or less me talking myself into being
validated," he explained.
Upon arriving back at school, other stu
dents initially asked if he was sick, but
these questions quickly turned to praise.
"At the same time that people were
commending me, and in a sense affirming
my weight loss, two of my teachers that re
ally knew me and knew where I was com
ing from, took me aside and talked to me. I
listened to them because I trusted them."
With the help of these two teachers,
Paul was able to see that he needed help.
Recovery for him, though, has been a long
process. It has taken him three years to say
that he was finally free of the disorder.
"Admitting that you have an eating dis
order is by no means a defeat," said Paul.
"It is more of a process of taking responsi
bility for yourself and taking the necessary
actions to get help.
"There are times that I have fallen back
into that mentality, but I am able to see
how that is just an indication that some
thing else in my life is going wrong, and I
need to find what it is in my life that's mak
ing me do this."
Paul's personal story is not unlike that
of many other students. Help is available
on campus for those coping with eating dis
orders and body image problems. The
body image group offers Monday night
support sessions at the Bridge at 8 p.m.,
and offers dorm presentations in hopes of
better educating the Stanford community
about nutrition, body image, and eating
disorders.
The Body, Image, Food and Self Es
teem Group was created six years ago
when a group of women wanted a support
network. According to Felzer, there are a
variety of resources to help people con
front a negative body image.
"There's the health library at the back
of Cowell and our support group, where
there are no professionals, but peers who
have experienced the same things. Its just
important that you do something and try to
get help," said Felzer.
