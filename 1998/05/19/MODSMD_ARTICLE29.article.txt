# Fallows speaks on media
## 
### Matthew H. Blumenstein 
James Fallows,
editor of U.S. News and
World Report, spoke last
night about the troubling
condition of the modern
American news media and

suggested ways it might be rescued.
Two years ago Fallows wrote "Breaking
the News: How the Media Undermine
American Democracy." Also two years
ago, he began his job as editor of U.S. News
and World Report. Last night, as an editor
and an activist, he gave "a progress report"
on the objections raised in his book.
Fallows believes that the "press collec
tively was needlessly harming the way we
get public business in America."
Among other complaints, he asserted
that the media industry is guilty of "melding
journalism with entertainment" and stated
that this will be "doom for our industry."
He cited the frequency of movie stars on
the covers of such magazines as Newsweek
and Time. According to Fallows, some pub
lications go so far as to grant stars full edito
rial rights on the stories which portray them.
He sadly voiced that many of America's
best writers are writing only about movie
stars and other celebrities.
Another problem with the media, ac
cording to Fallows, is its tendency to trivial
ize important events and swell relatively
unimportant stories.
The Monica Lewinsky scandal is one
such event. Fallows said. He believes jour
nalists and broadcasters need to maintain a
"divided consciousness" with which they
cover the story while maintaining an under
standing of its overall importance.
Fallows believes that a "hand-wringing
era" will set in eventually when people and
media institutions regret the fervor with
which they pursuo4 this story.

A final objection Fallows raised about
modern media is its prevailing attitude of
cynicism. One reason for this attitude, he
cited, is the increasingly homogenous back
ground of the American journalist.
Fallows is concerned by the prevailing
mold of very well-educated, Democratic
journalists in an industry that used to be
more diverse and "blue collar." This mold is
detrimental because it enables specific atti
tudes to become normalized.
To counter this trend. Fallows said that
U.S. News and World Report is making a
great effort to hire people from different
areas with different perspectives and be
liefs. In this way, the magazine may repre
sent a greater percentage of Americans.
Fallows' overarching goal with his maga
zine, he stated, is "to make what matters in
teresting."
One way to achieve this, in his opinion, is
to stray from the "conveyor belt" wire ser
vice news formula and to write stories
which, although they might not make the
headlines, matter nonetheless.
An application of this philosophy is their
annual article on the best ideas that writers
have heard over the course of the year. It is
important. Fallows stated, to place less em
phasis on the most obvious stories like
bombs and crimes.
These reforms have met huge resistance,
according to Fallows. He jokingly stated
that the entrenchment of habits in the
media industry rivals that of the Detroit car
industry in the 1970's and the United States
military in Vietnam.
Two years after publication. Fallows said
that he would change almost none of what
he wrote in his book. Journalism, he said,
has an enormous potential for reinvention
by those who practice it. It is th<? individual
responsibility of the men and women of
journalism to save it from its current peril
and resurrect a more pure and beneficial
news media.
