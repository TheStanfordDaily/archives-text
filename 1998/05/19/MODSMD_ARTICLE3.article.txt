# GRA Loss Adds to Woes
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
The elimination of the Graduate
Residential Assistant program is part
of a $4 million University-wide re
duction in the Housing and Dining
Services budget, according to Uni
versity administrators. It also reflects
a change to a "holistic approach" for
supplying support to the graduate
community.
However, for many graduate stu
dents, CiKAs were a main source of
connection to the University. A re
cent report by the Graduate Student
Council and the ASSU based on a
World Wide Web graduate housing
survey indicated that half of the grad
uate student population felt isolated
from the University.
Eighty-four percent of the 1260
respondents who gave written com
ments said they believed GRAs per
formed a useful role.
The Role of the GRA
Currently, the GRA program
consists of 50 GRAs, each of whom is
assigned a neighborhood within a
graduate residence.

According to doctoral student
Jason Wong, a GRAin Lyman Resi
dences, the primary role of GRAs is
to build a graduate residential com
munity. This involves programming a
variety of social activities.
"GRAs help facilitate the com
munication between graduate stu
dents who are often deeply involved
with academics," said Wong. "We
provide social outlets for students to
help balance their lives."
The GRAs are involved in wel
eoming new students, providing in
formation for their residents, coordi
nating emergency responses, and
"acting as an informal liaison be
tween the University and its graduate
students," said Wong.
Besides programming activities,
the GRAs are trained to handle resi
dential conflicts, including roommate
problems, noise issues, and some per
sonal problems.
"GRAs are the front line in prob
lem situations," said Chris Griffith,
director of Graduate Residences.
Why GRAs were eliminated
The decision to eliminate the

GRA program
was "driven by
the need to keep
the budget
down," said
Griffith. The
budget crisis was
caused by an in
creased demand

for housing due
to the rapid rise in housing costs in the
area over the past several years.
"Keeping the cost of on-campus
housing prices down was a top priori
ty," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montova.
Montoya added that the office of
Residential Education was asked to
cut expenses by $250,000. One hun
dred thousand dollars of this money
will come out of the GRA program.
The decision was made by the Direc
tor of Residential Education, Jane
Camarillo, in collaboration with
Montoya and Graduate Residences.
Since over 50 percent of the grad
uate population lives off ca'fripus.
Montoya said, the decision reflects a
shift to provide services to graduate
students at the University level rather

than at the residential level.
Griffith said the shift will encourage
"shared responsibilities" among the dif
ferent institutions on campus, including
the Graduate Student Programming
Board, Residential Education, Gradu
ate Residences and the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs office.
As part of this new approach. Dean
of Student Affairs Marc Wais said he is
heading a national search for an associ
ate dean of student affairs.
••'Hiis dean will work very closely
with the graduate offices, [Director of
Graduate Residences] Chris Griffith
and [Associate Dean of Graduate Poli
cy] Tom Wasow to coordinate pro
grams for graduate students," Wais
said.
Wais pointed out that graduate stu
dents tend toaffiliate more with their in
dividual departments, programs and
schools than with the University as a
whole. This is a reason for the new holis
tic approach.
The several campus-wide graduate
student activities planned by the GSPB
over the past two years were also a re

sult of this shift.
"We are trying in significant ways to
enhance the quality of graduate student
life," said Wais.
The housing report recommended
building a centralized community cen
ter for graduate students, one that
would provide childcare facilities, exer
cise facilities, and a community bulletin
board.
Wais said that students have dis
cussed such a complex with him, but he
could not comment on the possibility of
its construction.
Student Concerns and Administrator
Response
The housing report also voiced stu
dent concern that the decision to elimi
nate the G R A program was made with
out student consultation.
In response. Montoya replied that
"this is one situation in which we felt
compelled to make a decision without
consultation with the students. No cuts
in any area affecting student life will be
popular, but this was a situation where I
needed to depend on the expertise of
my staff that a [budget] safety net be
kept."
Montoya noted that there would be
a separate program instituted next year

with volunteer Community Associates
who will take over the community
building role of GRAs.
According to Griffith, these volun
teer ('As will provide similar social pro
grams to those of the GRAs.
Another worry is the disorganiza
tion of emergency responses due to the
elimination of GRAs. Volunteer CAs
will not be involved in coordinating
emergency responses, said Griffith.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of public safety, coordinating
emergency responses is not a very com
plicated task.
"The focus is to have someone
who'll be there taking charge and who
can then hand the situation off toothers
such as the police department," he said.
Herrington said that the C As, if they
were to take on the responsibility of co
ordinating emergency responses,
"could certainly do it."
An additional concern with the
elimination of GRAs is a lack of conflict
mediation.
ITiis concern is even stronger due to
a new housing policy that will change
some singles into doubles and doubles
into triples.
"For the first time in many years
[graduate students] will have room

mates." Griffith said, admitting that she
expects more conflicts to arise next
year.
"All the conflicts will escalate to the
point where graduate students will he
come more isolated and unhappy,"
Wong said. "The administration will
then be swamped handling these is
sues."
Ihe role of the CAs, according to
Griffith, will be to refer conflicts to the
resident deans.
"We will be more likely to intervene
directly than we currently do," said
Griffith.
She recognizes that this is a new situ
ation that may cause negative coase
quences. "This is new to me too, but
we're doing every conceivable thing we
can think of so that things can work."
Some of that will require more in
volvement by the administrators with
the graduate population, Griffith
added. "We're going to have to let the
students know who we are."
"Its not a decision that I had hoped
for in this situation," Griffith said, but
"we have put a program in place for
next year."
Mon toy a added that if more prob
lems arise next year, he will reevaluate
the situation.

nate the G R A program was made with
out student consultation.
In response. Montoya replied that
"this is one situation in which we felt
compelled to make a decision without
consultation with the students. No cuts
in any area affecting student life will be
popular, but this was a situation where I
needed to depend on the expertise of
my staff that a [budget] safety net be
kept."
Montoya noted that there would be
a separate program instituted next year

with volunteer Community Associates
who will take over the community
building role of GRAs.
According to Griffith, these volun
teer ('As will provide similar social pro
grams to those of the GRAs.
Another worry is the disorganiza
tion of emergency responses due to the
elimination of GRAs. Volunteer CAs
will not be involved in coordinating
emergency responses, said Griffith.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of public safety, coordinating
emergency responses is not a very com
plicated task.
"The focus is to have someone
who'll be there taking charge and who
can then hand the situation off toothers
such as the police department," he said.
Herrington said that the C As, if they
were to take on the responsibility of co
ordinating emergency responses,
"could certainly do it."
An additional concern with the
elimination of GRAs is a lack of conflict
mediation.
ITiis concern is even stronger due to
a new housing policy that will change
some singles into doubles and doubles
into triples.
"For the first time in many years
[graduate students] will have room

mates." Griffith said, admitting that she
expects more conflicts to arise next
year.
"All the conflicts will escalate to the
point where graduate students will he
come more isolated and unhappy,"
Wong said. "The administration will
then be swamped handling these is
sues."
Ihe role of the CAs, according to
Griffith, will be to refer conflicts to the
resident deans.
"We will be more likely to intervene
directly than we currently do," said
Griffith.
She recognizes that this is a new situ
ation that may cause negative coase
quences. "This is new to me too, but
we're doing every conceivable thing we
can think of so that things can work."
Some of that will require more in
volvement by the administrators with
the graduate population, Griffith
added. "We're going to have to let the
students know who we are."
"Its not a decision that I had hoped
for in this situation," Griffith said, but
"we have put a program in place for
next year."
Mon toy a added that if more prob
lems arise next year, he will reevaluate
the situation.
