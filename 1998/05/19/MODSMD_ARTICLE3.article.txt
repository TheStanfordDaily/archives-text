# GRA Loss Adds to Woes
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
The elimination of the Graduate
Residential Assistant program is part
of a $4 million University-wide re
duction in the Housing and Dining
Services budget, according to Uni
versity administrators. It also reflects
a change to a "holistic approach" for
supplying support to the graduate
community.
However, for many graduate stu
dents, CiKAs were a main source of
connection to the University. A re
cent report by the Graduate Student
Council and the ASSU based on a
World Wide Web graduate housing
survey indicated that half of the grad
uate student population felt isolated
from the University.
Eighty-four percent of the 1260
respondents who gave written com
ments said they believed GRAs per
formed a useful role.
The Role of the GRA
Currently, the GRA program
consists of 50 GRAs, each of whom is
assigned a neighborhood within a
graduate residence.

According to doctoral student
Jason Wong, a GRAin Lyman Resi
dences, the primary role of GRAs is
to build a graduate residential com
munity. This involves programming a
variety of social activities.
"GRAs help facilitate the com
munication between graduate stu
dents who are often deeply involved
with academics," said Wong. "We
provide social outlets for students to
help balance their lives."
The GRAs are involved in wel
eoming new students, providing in
formation for their residents, coordi
nating emergency responses, and
"acting as an informal liaison be
tween the University and its graduate
students," said Wong.
Besides programming activities,
the GRAs are trained to handle resi
dential conflicts, including roommate
problems, noise issues, and some per
sonal problems.
"GRAs are the front line in prob
lem situations," said Chris Griffith,
director of Graduate Residences.
Why GRAs were eliminated
The decision to eliminate the

GRA program
was "driven by
the need to keep
the budget
down," said
Griffith. The
budget crisis was
caused by an in
creased demand

for housing due
to the rapid rise in housing costs in the
area over the past several years.
"Keeping the cost of on-campus
housing prices down was a top priori
ty," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montova.
Montoya added that the office of
Residential Education was asked to
cut expenses by $250,000. One hun
dred thousand dollars of this money
will come out of the GRA program.
The decision was made by the Direc
tor of Residential Education, Jane
Camarillo, in collaboration with
Montoya and Graduate Residences.
Since over 50 percent of the grad
uate population lives off ca'fripus.
Montoya said, the decision reflects a
shift to provide services to graduate
students at the University level rather
