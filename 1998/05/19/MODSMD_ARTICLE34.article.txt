### Will Chang Contributing writer 
This week the Black Student
Union will present "Remembrance,
Reflection, and Revelation." a week
long event that celebrates the life and
ideals of Malcolm X.
An annual nationwide event,
Malcolm X Week strives to educate
and expose the Stanford community,
in a present- day context, to Malcolm
X and his messages.
"Our main purpose is to com
memorate his legacy and to try to im
plement his ideals." said sophomore
Brian Rikuda, a member of the
Black Student Union.
According to junior Chary Jones,

a representative from the BSU, Mal
colm X is commonly perceived as a
reverse racist and a separatist. Some
feel that this role was influenced by
Malcolm X's membership in the Na
tion of Islam as a young adult.
Malcolm X advocated Pan-
Africanism. the idea that all black
people separated by the tragedy of
the slave trade are united in common
heritage.
This week, the BSU will also ad
dress the issue of current racism.
"Malcolm's message is more im
portant and necessary in present-day
society at Stanford and in the real
world," said Jones.
"Racism, prejudice and oppres
sion are not as overt as thev were in

the 50's and (SO's. Blacks have be
come passive. They ignore things
such as glass ceilings and the insur
mountable barriers which still exist,"
she said.
Events began yesterday with the
showing of Malcolm X speeches in
White Plaza. BSU representatives
were also present to discuss and an
swer questions.
Today, a presentation will be
given by Professor Emeritus of
Spanish and Portuguese Sylvia
Wynter in the Ujamaa Drake
Lounge at 7 p.m. The program is ti
tled "Revisiting Malcolm X. Re
thinking Race, and What Does He
Say to Us Today."
Wynter will share her perspective

and the underlying meanings of his
message.
Tomorrow, at the same location
and time, Cobie Harris, professor of

cal science at San Jose State Univer
sity, will present his vision of the life
of Malcolm X.
