Members of Disabled Students at
Stanford met Roger Whitney, assis
tant director of Housing and Dining
Services, and Jane Camarillo. direc
tor of Residential Education, Friday
afternoon at the Disabled Commu
nity Center to discuss how recent
changes in housing choices will af
fect the disabled community.
Freshman Jonathon Reichanthal
organized the meeting to address
community members' discontent
with Toyon's new all-sophomore
status and Kimball's new all-upper
class status.
"One of every available housing
option must be made available to
members of the disabled communi
ty," said Junior Jessica Lehman.
"Toyon is becoming an all-sopho
more preference dorm, and it isn't
very accessible. It's an option that
should be made available to us," she
said.
Additionally, Kimball is sched
uled to have an elevator before the
beginning of the 1998-99 school

year. This will make it the most ac
cessible dorm on campus. However,
as an upper-class dorm, Kimball will
not be available to disabled fresh
men.
According to Whitney, the deci
sion to change Kimball's status pre
ceded plans to construct a new ele
vator.
"The decision was made that ver
tical accessibility would be available
after first floor accessibility was
widespread. The Kimball elevator
was a gift. Certainly it's an improve
ment that we would have made, but
it was made ahead of time," said
Whitney.
Cameral also addressed other
housing concerns. In an effort to
make Standard life more pleasant,
the University has been trying to
create more all-freshman residences
and better housing choices for up
perclassmen. It was Camarillo's task
put those plans into effect.
"In order to make all-frosh hous
ing. we have to take freshmen out of
somewhere and make those houses
upperclass," said Camarillo. In this
case, freshmen were removed from

Toyon and Kimball.
"[The housing decision] is not
possible to reverse, for me, because
of a numbers issue. We need fresh
men to draw from somewhere else.
The question is, can freshmen still
live in Kimball? 1 think that is [a
concern] we can work with," she
said. "I don't think that elevatorscan
make or break a student's experi
ence, or every residence would have
an elevator."
Junior history major Daniel
Davis was not impressed by the re
sponses of Camarillo and Whitney.
"Here was an opportunity to get
ahead of the game. We already have
upperclass housing that has an ele
vator. Having another upperclass
housing option with an elevator
doesn't seem as important as frosh
housing with an elevator," he said.
Camarillo expressed regret but
pointed towards community in
volvement as the answer.
"We need response from the
larger community to make changes
in housing. One of our large prob
lems is that when we ask for input,
no one comes," she said.
