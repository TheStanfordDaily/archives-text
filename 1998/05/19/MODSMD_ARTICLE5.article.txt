# Gay pride symbol remains despite controversy
## Rainbow flag flies at Haus 
### Sharon Armstrong Contributing writer 
Three years after the flags of Germany. Austria, and
Switzerland were removed from Haus Mitteleuropa
during the house's renovation, they fly again. Only this
time there is a hard won additionâ€”a rainbow Hag com
memorating gay pride.
The Hags are flying as part of Haus Mitt resident and
sophomore Amy Hsu's theme project to bring the flags
back after they were taken down in 1995. While every
member of Haus Mitt is required to do a theme project
focused on central Europe, few projects have met such
controversy as the addition of this new flag.
Last quarter, a two-hour house meeting was held to
determine whether the rainbow flag should fly or a re
placement flag should be found. Some residents op
posed the flag because of its political connotations. Oth
ers supported it because of Haus Mitt's reputation as a
gay-friendly house.
"There's a spectrum of views." said Zack Allen, a se
nior resident of the house who voted to fly the flag. Allen
added that he didn't feel the house was doing anything
extraordinary by adding the rainbow flag to the others.
"We didn't feel we were setting a precedent in terms
of making a political statement." he said.
Junior Mike Gaisford, another resident of the house,
feels differently. "There's no reason for it to be there."
he said. "People walk by and wonder why it's there."
Haus Mitt house manager David Stein, a junior,
agreed.
" The rainbow flag, while it's purpose is good, has a
strong political commitment. And to put it on the out
side. it imposes a view on the members of the house who
don't agree with it."he said.
Financial manager Maria Medetis. a senior, said that
the issue was not the flag's subject matter but it's irrele
vancy to the house's theme. "Very simply put. the rain
bow flag doesn't ostensibly have anything to do with the
German theme."
But Hsu believes that the rainbow flag is very rele
vant. "There is a strong history of gay liberation move
ments in Germany, definitely in pre-Nazi days, and as a
political statement it has relevance in that sense." Hsu
added that there is a "common perception of Germans

as unaccepting and harsh." and that many house mem
bers wanted to fly the tlag in hopes of assuaging some of
those perceptions.
Another point of contention surrounding the Hag was
the manner in which the decision to fly the Hag was
made.
Hsu said house members decided in a preliminary
vote that only a majority would be necessary to fly the
flag. In both votes. Allen s.ud. the majority of residents
voted for the flag.
But other house members believe that the decision
needed more than a majoritx
