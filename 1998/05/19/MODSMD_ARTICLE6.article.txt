# Final hearing in tenure case
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Psychiatry Prof. Adolph Pteffer
baum and a lawyer representing
Stanford were given a final opportu
nity to present their cases yesterday
before the Academic Council's Ad
visory Board, which University
President Gerhard Casper has
charged with determining if he has
grounds to fire Pfefferbaum.
A psychiatrist and neurologist
w ho has spent most of his 21 years at
Stanford working both at the Schixil

of Medicine and the Palo Alto Vet
erans Affairs Hospital. Pfefferbaum
is fighting Casper's move, which
came in response to Pfefferbaum's
attempted retirement from his V'A
hospital position in I*)%.
Casper has argued that the retire
ment also constituted a retirement
from Pfefferbaum's tenured profes
sorship at Stanford. When the pro
fessor and a Santa Clara County
judge disagreed. Casper initiated
formal proceedings before the Advi
sory Board, which has collected tcs
timony for the past year.

Pfefferbaum. Medical School
Dean Eugene Bauer and the lawyers
for the respective sides provided
final testimony before the board
during a three-hour hearing yester
day. l"he lawyers will submit closing
briefs within the week, after which
the Advisory Board will issue a rul
ing.
The final testimony revisited
many concerns already debated in
hearings this year, most of which
came before an independent hcar
ings officer retained by the Advisory
Board to rule on six "disputed facts"
in the case.
Pfefferbaum's lawyer, Pete Me-
Closkey, pointed out that yesterday
marked the only time his client had
been allowed to testify on the issues
he felt were most pertinent to the
case, specifically concerns about
academic freedom and the griev
ance process for professors assigned
to the VA hospital.
Casper has accused Pfefferbaum
of neglecting his academic duties in
resigning from his VA post, a charge
McCloskev called "manifestly false
and legally contrived" as he urged
the Advisory Board to consider the
situation as academic and not legal.
The problem only grew worse,
according to McCloskev. because of
"muddleheaded, shoot-from-the
hip decisions" made by Provost
Condoleezza Rice, who he claims in
terfered in Pfefferbaum's rights as
defined bv academic freedom.
Pfefferbaum traces the origin of
his problems at the VA hospital to a
complaint he and two other doctors
filed against then-VA Chief of Staff
Richard Mazze. The results of that
move. McCloskev said, were "swift
and they were terrible."
But Eli Gould, the lawyer repre
senting Casper in the case, said aca
demic freedom was not and had
never been the focus of the dispute.

Attempting to dismiss a tenured
professor is "a very hard thing for
any institution to do," he said. How
ever. he added, as a result of Pfeffer
baurn's neglect of academic duties,
the University was left with no
choice.
Allowing a professor to leave his
assigned duties because of a soured
working relationship or a negative
proficiency report of the kind Pfef
ferbaum received in 1996 would set
a "dangerous precedent," Gould
said. "I think you can envision the
chaos that would bring."
Bauer, sitting next to Gould at
the hearing, told the professors on
the board that Pfefferbaum'sactions
were fully inappropriate for a pro
fessor.
"What has happened in this dis
pute represents a violation of Dr. Pf
efferbaum's obligations as a faculty
member, which 1 think requires seri
ous sanctions," he said.
Pfefferbaum replied that he
feels he already has suffered - from,
among other things, the effective
end of his job, months without pay,
the loss of grants from the National
Institutes of Health and the closing
of his Mental Health Clinical Re
search Center at the VA hospital.
Pfefferbaum has moved his re
search base to SRI International,
which is not affiliated with Stan
ford.
"I have already received the most
severe of sanctions," he told the
board. "I am guilty of a lot of things
but not neglect of academic duty."
