# Sophomore Dan Perkel wins praise

There was this understanding that
when you were pulling with him, he
would help you out. — sophomore
Dave Weekly, technical consultant
for the Elections Commission
The elections commissioner has a
largely thankless job, and Dan really
tried hard to keep the process moving
effectively. He always works hard
and cares about what he's doing. —
sophomore Matt Spence, deputy
ASSU Senate chair
There's no lack of praise for Dan
Perkel, who served this year as the
ASSU elections commissioner, run
ning voting, examining possible vio
lations and ensuring a smooth elec
tion for next year's student govern
ment.
But Perkel's interests stretch well
beyond the ASSU. A sophomore
planning on a major in science, tech
nology and society, Perkel wears
more hats than the average student.
Self-described as "pretty inde
pendent," Perkel has been interest
ed in student government for sever
al years but has also tried to take ad
vantage of everything else Stanford

has to offer.
This quarter, Perkel is taking
classes in subjects as diverse as com
puter science, economics and art.
He is also a manager of the football
team. Next winter, he plans to study
at Stanford in Florence.
Originally from Dayton, Ohio,
Perkel decided that "Stanford
seemed like the place for me" after
visiting as a prospective freshman.
But student politics didn't imme
diately grab his attention.
"I envisioned myself as being a
part of the whole student govern
ment process" as early as high
school, Perkel said. That first year,
however, he remained an observer
and paid close attention to the elec
tion process.
"I didn't understand why certain
things had to be a certain way, like
why at this school [where] we have
all these intelligent people, [becom
ing] an ASSU senator requires zil
lions of fliers ... and slogans which 1
found kind of ridiculous," he said.
"I really did not like the cam
paign at all."
Litter that spring, he saw an ad
about applying to be elections com
missioner and decided to get in

volved.
Going into this year's spring gen
eral election, Perkel's main goal was
"to run an election which... the stu
dents found legitimate," he said.
"We didn't want to repeat any of the
past mistakes that were made."
ASSIJ elections rarely run
smoothly. Controversies during the
past several years have involved
campaign financing, voting on over
seas campuses and fraudulent votes.
Perkel said he thinks he met most
of his goals.
"Theelection ran .. .assmoothly
as possible," he said. "It was a fair
election."
The smoothness resulted from
good planning, Perkel said, explain
ing that "the commission tried to
take a very direct and open stance
on all the issues with the candi
dates. ... I was very serious about
deadlines early on, and I think it
made people take us seriously."
To avoid problems such as the
one last year in which about 50 stu

dents at Stanford in Oxford could
not vote because of a scheduled
field trip during the election, Perkel
said he found out when field trips
occurred this year and allowed
overseas students to vote ahead of
time.
Last year, another controversy
arose after a slate of candidates for
sophomore class presidential candi
dates spent more than their limit on
T-shirts. Perkel helped establish a
fair market value for funding in this
year's election.
Perkel doesn't attribute his suc
cess to foresight — hut rather to
timing.
"We happened to be running an
election after the controversy," he
said.
He credits his elections commis
sion for the success.
" The election is what it is not he
cause of what I did, but because of
what they did," he said.
Perkel also offered praise for ju
nior Ghazal Badiozamani — last
year's election commissioner — for
guiding him through the process.
"I didn't have to worry about the
senate looking over mv shoulder."

Perkel explained.
"He did a good job." Badio/a
mani said. "He is very hard-working
and very dedicated. He really lis
tened to what I had to say and ran a
good election."
His involvement with the ASSU
didn't end with the election.
Perkel plans to work on rewriting
the ASSIJ Bylaws, which he says is
"absolutely necessary. If we don't
do it. next year's elections commis
sion will be left with some archaic
laws."
Looking back. Perkel described
his job as incredibly stressful.
"It is definitely one of the most
difficult and demanding things that
I've ever done," he said, adding that
tie received about 3(H) election-re
lated e-mail messages in two weeks.
"And I spend three hours replying
to six of them."
But. he said, the job was "re
warding. 1 gained a lot of experi
ence."
Perkel added that students can
still apply to be next year's elections
commissioner. Applications will be
available tomorrow and are due
May 29.
