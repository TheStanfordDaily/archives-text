There was this understanding that
when you were pulling with him, he
would help you out. — sophomore
Dave Weekly, technical consultant
for the Elections Commission
The elections commissioner has a
largely thankless job, and Dan really
tried hard to keep the process moving
effectively. He always works hard
and cares about what he's doing. —

ASSU Senate chair
There's no lack of praise for Dan
Perkel, who served this year as the
ASSU elections commissioner, run
ning voting, examining possible vio
lations and ensuring a smooth elec
tion for next year's student govern
ment.
But Perkel's interests stretch well
beyond the ASSU. A sophomore
planning on a major in science, tech
nology and society, Perkel wears
more hats than the average student.
Self-described as "pretty inde
pendent," Perkel has been interest
ed in student government for sever
al years but has also tried to take ad
vantage of everything else Stanford

has to offer.
This quarter, Perkel is taking
classes in subjects as diverse as com
puter science, economics and art.
He is also a manager of the football
team. Next winter, he plans to study
at Stanford in Florence.
Originally from Dayton, Ohio,
Perkel decided that "Stanford
seemed like the place for me" after
visiting as a prospective freshman.
But student politics didn't imme
diately grab his attention.
"I envisioned myself as being a
part of the whole student govern
ment process" as early as high
school, Perkel said. That first year,
however, he remained an observer
and paid close attention to the elec
tion process.
"I didn't understand why certain
things had to be a certain way, like
why at this school [where] we have
all these intelligent people, [becom
ing] an ASSU senator requires zil
lions of fliers ... and slogans which 1
found kind of ridiculous," he said.
"I really did not like the cam
paign at all."
Litter that spring, he saw an ad
about applying to be elections com
missioner and decided to get in

Sophomore Dan Perkel describes his term as this year's ASSU elec

things that I've ever done."
