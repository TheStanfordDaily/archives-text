CHARLESTON. W.Va. (AP) — Hoping to win the world's richest
lottery jackpot? Dream on.
You're 40 times more likely to die falling out of bed and 320 times
more likely to perish in a plane crash than you are to win even a piece
of the $175 million Powerhall jackpot being drawn tonight.
Not that that is discouraging some people from buying tickets.
"Somebody's got to win. Why not me?" Mary Whiting of
Charleston said yesterday.
People lined up to buy tickets in the District of Columbia and the
20 states that take part in the Powerball lottery. One store in New Cas
tle. Del., chose to close rather than deal with a line that stretched out
side the door. The store had to call the police to handle customers
angry at leaving empty-handed, some after waiting four hours to put
down their bets.
The odds of matching all six numbers for a share of the jackpot are
SO.l million-to-1. But the odds of just person one hitting the numbers
and winning all the money are. well, forget it.
Charles Strutt, executive director of the West Des Moines-based
Multi-State Lottery Association, which handles Powerball. wouldn't
hazard a guess. But he said the chances are 60 percent to 70 percent
that there will be at least two winners.
According to "The Book of Risks" by Larry Laudan. a philosophy
professor at the University of Hawaii, the odds of dying are:
• 3 million-to-1 by freezing to death.
• 2 million-to-1 by falling out of bed.
• 250,000-to-l in a plane crash.
• 5.0()0-to-l in a car crash.
Still, "there's always that chance of winning," Melissa Browder of
E:lkview said as she and two friends bought $20 worth of tickets.
For the record, the odds of getting hit by a meteorite are 5 billion to-1
Hacking away the Internet
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate committee heard seven of the
nation's top computer hackers claim yesterday they could cripple the
Internet in a half-hour. Given more time and money, they boasted,
they could interrupt satellite transmissions or electricity grids and
snoop on the president's movements.
While Internet security experts said such claims might be hyper
bole, testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs C ommittee
raised troubling questions for some about security ol the nation s pub
lic and private computer networks.
Sen. John Glenn. D-Ohio. said the testimony pointed to a threat to
national security.
"If you look at this, in some ways it's a whole new way of making
warfare," Glenn said, referring to attacks on sensitive computer sys
tems. "I don't think that overstates it one bit.'
