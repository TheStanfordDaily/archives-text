# Saving for retirement
## Proposal would allow Social Security investment 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Americans
could save more money tax-free for retire
ment and invest part of their Social Security
contributions in the stock market under a plan
proposed yesterday by a group of lawmakers,
business leaders and scholars.
" The goal of this is to have people more
involved in their own savings." said Sen. John
Breaux. D-La.. a leader of the panel, which
was convened by the private Center for Strate
gic and International Studies.
The detailed plan recommends steps to
make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77
million babv boomers become eligible for
Social Security benefits, including a gradual
increase in the retirement age to 70.
Saying the proposal also would mean more
individual risk in planning for old age. a liber
al academic group denounced the plan as
"rigged" by Wall Street and big business
against working-class Americans.
"It discriminates against people who don't

have lives that are comfortable enough so that
they can even get to age 70 and retire." said
Theresa Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the
Institute for Public Accuracy.
President Clinton and Republican leaders
in Congress have said they would like to over
haul the nation's retirement system. The GOP
would like to see Social Securit\ contributions
go into new privately controlled accounts.
('linton has said he does not rule that out. but
has some concerns
"I'm convinced our plan provides a solid
middle ground where I see the congressional
debate going." said Breaux.
Sen. Judd Gregg. K N H, and Reps. Jim
K"'be R-Ariz.. and Charles Stenholm. D-
Texas. also helped lead the project.
Among the other 20 participants were the
chairman of Wall Street investment firm Paine
Webber Group Inc.. Donald B Matron. IBM
vice president Josephine Tsao: and Tupper
ware Corp. chief executive Warren Batts.
