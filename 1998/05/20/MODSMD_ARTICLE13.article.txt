# Suharto agrees to relinquish power
## Student protesters storm Indonesian Parliament building 
### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)
Student protesters forced their way
into the halls of Parliament and
army tanks took up position around
President Suharto's white
columned palace yesterday, both
sides bracing for new clashes after
Indonesia's authoritarian leader
said he will step down — but not
just yet.
"Hang Suharto! Hang Suharto!"
the more than 15,000-strong student
contingent chanted from inside the
echoing, marble-trimmed building,
unfurling banners demanding
reforms from the roof of parliament
in a protest unlike any other in
Indonesia's history.
Under pressure from economic
crises, months of student protests
and now riots in the capital of his
country. Suharto told the nation
yesterday that he would end his 32-
year reign — but only at a still
unspecified time, and only after he
oversees government reforms, a
Cabinet shuffle, and new elections.
"This decision comes from my
feeling of responsibility in an effort
to save the country from destruc
tion." Suharto said in a sometimes
somber. 15-minute speech televised
nationally.
He said his insistence on making
long-refused reforms before he
steps down should not be interpret
ed as "resistance on my part to step
down." But Indonesia's increasingly
aggressive opposition ti>ok it as just
that.
Students pushed their way into
the halls and onto the ri>of of Par
liament. occupying the building
ahead of what's touted to be the
largest yet in months of growing
anti-government protests — a rally

that the opposition hopes will draw
up to 1 million students and work
ers to a park just outside the presi
dential palace.
Army tanks and trucks rolled
out by the dozens just before mid
night last night, unloading barbed
wire for barricades to block off the
park and taking up positions on
streets around the site — apparent
ly intent on keeping students from
the protest site when daylight came.
While much of the public has
turned against him in the face of
soaring food and fuel prices,
Indonesia's top military brass are
backing Suharto, a retired general

who himself came to power in time
of turmoil in — and has ruled
with little tolerance for dissent ever
since.
Students cheered and applauded
the lone. 10-member contingent of
soldiers who entered the grounds of
Parliament yesterday Women stu
dents handed them flowers.
The army largely has acted with
restraint against the students: it was
police who fired on a crowd of stu
dent demonstrators earlier this
month, seting off days i\f looting
and burning in Jakarta last week.
More than S(K) people died, most of
them looters trapped inside stores

set afire hv the mobs
Environment Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said Suharto hopes to
push through reform and resign by
year's end as head of the world's
fourth most-populous nation.
Suharto himself did not give a
timetable for the reforms, saying
elections would be held "as soon as
possible."
But he stressed that he would
follow the country's 1945 constitu
tion. which could mean at least
three to six months before a new
vote.
He promised to appoint a special
reform council.
