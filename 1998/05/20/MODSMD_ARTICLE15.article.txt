Administration should
actively monitor student
financial managers

IN THE WAKE of the arrest of a
former La Casa Italiana financial
manager on embezzlement
charges, a renewed emphasis is thank
fully being placed on training and
overseeing Row financial managers.
Managing a house budget is a valu
able learning exercise, but it is essen
tial for the University to carefully
guide students through the process
and to prevent student financial man
agers from actions that place them and
the money of fellow students at risk.
And the stakes are high, given that stu
dent-managed houses collectively han
dle over $5.5 million dollars annually.
The new financial procedures gov
erning Row financial managers
announced last week by Asst. Director
for Student Management Laurette
Beeson are a positive step toward
ensuring greater financial accountabil
ity on the Row.
Requiring financial managers to
have canceled checks returned with
bank statements, to have "deposit
only" ATM cards, and to run internal
quarterly audits in which another
house member verifies the financial
manager's statements, reports and
receipts are among the beneficial prac
tices that will be uniformly instituted.

But above all, houses must be vigi
lant about minimizing the amount of
money they hold in reserve. It is sim
ply much easier to embezzle a thou
sand dollars here and there out of a
$30,000 reserve budget than out of
$5,(X)() one.
Residences should clearly state
their refund policies at the beginning
of the year, and financial managers
should guard against reserve funds
that grow annually. By doing so, man
agers minimize their personal risk and
properly serve their fellow residents.
The Office of Residential Educa
tion, in conjunction with the Office of
Student Activities, should also consid
er designing official training programs
geared specifically toward dorm trea
surers.
Although dorm treasurers typically
handle smaller budgets than Row
financial managers, the potential for
financial mismanagement remains.
Current training of dorm treasurers,
who are typically elected by dorms
each fall, is far from uniform.
Although these treasurers can attend
the numerous one-hour financial
workshops that Student Activities
offers for registered student groups
and house government presidents, this
resource is underutilized.
Res Ed and Student Activities
should continue to do their best to
ensure that the finances of all resi
dences and student groups are closely
managed. After all, the buck literally
stops with these two organizations.
