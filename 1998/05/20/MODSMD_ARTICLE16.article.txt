Abstinence is the answer
If all of the 28 women in Cowell Stu
dent Health Services' "Preventing Preg
nancy" ad in Monday's Daily abstained
from vaginal intercourse, none of them
would get pregnant. Abstinence as a
method of birth control, however, is listed
last in the ad, as an afterthought, under
"other options."
How can an institution that promotes
student health barely mention the most
effective method of birth control? Even if
one chooses to disregard the preponder
ance of moral arguments which agree that
sexual intercourse should only occur with
in the context of marriage, or the statisti
cal evidence of the Family Research
Council which shows that saving sex for
marriage reduces divorce and adultery,
and that married couples are the most sex
ually satisfied Americans, abstinence is
objectively superior to any other option.
Cowell rates the birth control options
from fair to excellent. Abstinence, though,
is the only 1(H) percent effective method of
birth control. It is also completely effec
tive against sexually transmitted diseases
and has no side effects. How much would
you piy for a device which does all this?
Abstinence is completely free!
Stanford students need to protect
themselves from the false messages of
"safe" sex that are trumpeted continuous
ly at this school. Beginning with Orienta

tion and"The Real World," abstinence is
described as just one of the "other
options," instead of promoted for what it
really is, the best option. It is also the only
option for anyone who truly cares about
his or her own physical and emotional
health, and the health of girlfriends,
boyfriends, wives, husbands, children and
society.

A new name for the
Dollies?
1 was puzzled by Megan O'Neill's letter to
the editor in Monday's Daily, in which she
suggested that the Dollies' title is demean
ing. The idea that a name that implies physi
cal attractiveness is automatically "demean
ing" is strange to me.
Ms. O'Neill's lengthy explanation of why
wearing little clothing is a "functional
requirement of the activity," followed by her
statement that she has "yet to hear anyone
criticize swimmers or track runners for being
scantily clad," would seem to indicate that
she thinks the Stanford community is merely
being vindictive; that it uses the name "Dol
lies" to mock the dancers for wearing reveal
ing outfits. If this is Ms. O'Neill's sincere
impression, then I would have to say that she
is rather confused.

Ms. O'Neill goes on to suggest that "a
more appropriate name would remove the
sexist insinuations that these women are any
thing less than masters of athleticism and
artistry." It isn't at all clear to me, however,
how the name "Dollies" conjures images of
clumsiness and inexperience.
Perhaps she would find the title "Masters
of Athleticism and Artistry" more appropri
ate. Or maybe, to remove that last tinge of
sexism, she would be happier with "Non-
Physically Attractive Masters of Athleticism
and Artistry." Now that's a catchy name for
a dance group.

David Wells is no
Muhammad Ali
Faulty logic permeated Ben Freda's
column, "Change in the Wishing Wells" in
Tuesday's Daily. Freda would have bene
fited from a deeper knowledge of Ameri
can sports history. For instance, his con
tention that "David Wells, our perfect
game pitcher, is supposed to be the Ali of
today" is simply wrong. From the time he
fought as Cassius Clay in the Olympics, to
the time he adopted Islam (and his new
name) and claimed he was a conscien

tious objector to the American war in
Vietnam, to the times of his brutal con
tests against Foreman, Norton and Frazier
in the 19705, Ali was at the forefront of
not only the sports world, but American
popular culture.
As Freda mentions, Ali's importance as
an American icon who transcended sports
continues today. This is evidenced by the
widespread reaction to his lighting of the
Olympic torch. Muhammad Ali had and
still has immense cultural relevance not
only within the sports world, but within
American society at large.
David "Boomer" Wells, on the other
hand, is a journeyman pitcher who on one
day got everything perfect. A perfect
game is a moment in time that does not
ensure that the pitcher will achieve any
more than the requisite "15 minutes of
fame."
Boomer Wells has already disappeared
from the cultural consciousness. Wells will
soon become, like most of the other per
fect-game pitchers besides Sandy Koufax,
Catfish Hunter and Cy Young, a footnote
in baseball history.
Does anyone remember Len Barker,
who threw a perfect game for Cleveland in
1981? How about Kenny Rogers, who
threw his perfect game for Texas in 1994?
(Actually, he's pitching for Oakland now
and has a bloated ERA.) Don Larsen was
a journeyman pitcher like most of the
other perfect-game pitchers, and of the
same ilk as Wells.

Does Mr. Freda realize that Larsen lost
21 games for Baltimore just two years
before pitching his legendary perfect con
test in the World Series, and that his life
time record was a mere 81 wins and 91
losses?
Indeed, despite the "sour taste" in
Freda's mouth, one could argue strongly
that, except for the stage (World Series
versus regular season), incontestable par
allels exist between the two Yankee "one
day greats."
The fact that these two pitchers were
"one-day greats" and had no sustainable
impact on the larger American culture,
unlike Muhammad Ali. is the larger point
Freda fails to consider fully.
That missed point fatally undermines
the logic of his column. In 50 years, no one
will remember Boomer Wells and only
baseball trivia buffs will remember Don
Larsen. But Ali's central place in the cul
ture of his period will keep Ali in the
American consciousness.
