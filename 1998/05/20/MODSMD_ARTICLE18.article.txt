ing. Management con
sulting. Medical
school. Law school.
Coterming. Hi-tech. If
you're a Stanford student,
chances are you have felt
pressured to select one of
the above post-graduation

paths and do what they told you.
Choosing something to do can be diffi
cult. It's hard to find that balance between
exploitation and oppressing the masses. But
regardless of the new scene you plahT>n
ing, you'll invariably spend most of your
hours staring at a computer screen. Unless,
you're a CS major — then you'll go into
management.
Resumes: The key to spicing up your
resume is to label every job you've done as
an internship. This transforms ordinary jobs
into extraordinary jobs. Did you spend last
summer flipping burgers at Mickey D's?
Great! Future employers will certainly be
impressed that you did a "franchise restau
rant internship."
Also make sure to avoid the surreal
resume. The real resume lists what you did
for 20 percent of your job. On the other
hand, the surreal resume lists the remaining
80 percent. For your multimedia "intern
ship" list the real aspects (enhanced tech
nology skills); DO NOT list the surreal
aspects (Web surfing, e-mail). Creatively
illustrate your multifaceted talents and

experience by focusing less on specific
aspects of the job (Solitaire. Minesweeper,
Hearts, etc.) and more on the strengths you
developed (hand-eye coordination, work
ing independently, etc).
Phone conversations: It's really impor
tant to keep frequent contact with Compa
ny X to show it your overflowing interest.
Accuracy is essential, so make things clear,
i.e., "I live on Grove Street; that's G as in
Gary, R as in Rob, etc." Again, overcome
the urge to be surreal. DO NOT say,
"That's Grove Steet; G as in gonorrhea, R
in RSStftfarirfn, O as in oscillating, etc."
Interviews: If the job is anything like
consulting, remind the interviewer of your
keen awareness of the bottom line by
adding the key phrase "add value" as often
as possible. Also make sure to shift the
power during the interview so that you are
the one asking questions and putting Com
pany X on the line. Let them know who's
boss!
In group interviews or role-playing ses
sions, don't be bothered that everyone else
knows so much more than you do. Just use
your rhetorical skills to assume the lead role
by simply summarizing what everyone else
says; "So far, A says ... B says ... and C
says .. . I'm glad we're working as a team
and reaching a consensus. Now let's make
sure this plan really adds value to Company
X." If you're really desperate you'll have to
Pull Obscurity™. Leave your fellow inter
viewees in the dust with phrases like, "Let's

look at Y2K factors." Don't give them a
chance by stating it in obvious terms. "What
if there's a Year 2(KX) Problem?"
Catch-22: Once you've gone through the
whole resume and interview process, then
you'll have to select a job. This is where you
meet the unavoidable Satisfaction/Com
pensation Paradox™. Simply stated, the
S/C Paradox means that job satisfaction and
salary are indirectly proportional. You're
forced to make a sacrifice. Which one will it
be? 1) Lame job and good pay, 2) Good job
and lame pay or 3) So-so job and so-so pay.
Whatever you do after Stanford, please
make sure to give back to all those who
have sacrificed to allow you to get where
you are now.
A good start is to donate 10 percent of
your annual salary to Microsoft. Where
would you be now if it weren't for Word
and Excel?
Also be sure to give kudos to those
folks who chose the path less trodden,
truly sacrificing their lives to make this
world a better place (for you and for me
and the entire human race). Although they
disagree with our fundamental principles
of Western civilization (hard work, indi
vidualism, imperialism, racial hegemony
and so on), our lives would be much worse
off without them.
