# From the fourth dimension
## Kerry Rodgers Skirting the lake of fire to find spirituality 
### 
£ A CCEPT JESUS CHRIST as the
/\ Messiah or you'll burn in a lake of
-Z A.fire forever and ever," a guy said
to me as I rode through White Plaza the
other day.
Just the happy news I was hoping for —
that I'll be damned to hell for all eternity
because of my religious beliefs (or lack there
of).
Perhaps there is still hope, since last Sun
day I actually dragged my butt out of bed in
the morning to (gasp) go to church.
Admittedly, this wasn't your typical Sun
day service. It was more like a rockin' gospel
concert, with a bit of feel-good preaching,
community organizing and AA confessing
thrown in for good measure. Moreover, the
congregation looked like an advertisement
for "We are the World." Persons of every
ethnicity, religious background and sexual
orientation had gathered in the Tenderloin
district of San Francisco to take part in the
fun.
This is a regular occasion at Glide Memo
rial Church, which is technically a Methodist
establishment, but effectively a non-denom

inational celebration of love and compas
sion. So the alienation that I usually feel at
places of worship was replaced by a bottom
less sense of acceptance.
1 have only been to church a handful of
times — mostly when I was in junior high.
I've also sat through services at a few
weddings. I even went to Christmas midnight
mass a few years ago since family friends
were performing a musical duet. It ended up
being a bad night. I was bored by the prose
lytizing priest, and I vowed never to attend
church with my family again, lest we be sub
ject to my father's incessant anti-organized
religion grumblings.
My father is a devout atheist, and my
mother a recovering Catholic. They reared
my brother and me to view the children's
Bible as a literary work and to celebrate
Christmas as a secular holiday. Even so, my
mother exposed me to spirituality at a young
age by reading me books like "The Tao of
Pooh" and taking me to sermons at a Vedan
ta Hindu Temple.
I have perpetually felt a craving for a real
religion 1 could call my cwn, especially when

I have witnessed friends find comfort in their
faith. So when I left home for college, I
struck out with considerable enthusiasm to
find a religion that I could believe in.
I attended some Quaker meetings, spent
a weekend at a pagan retreat, and even dab
bled in an Eastern religious practice called
Subud. None of my spiritual experiments
stuck. I was unmoved by them and left feel
ing more empty than I had been before.
I decided that religion just wasn't in my
DNA, and so I settled on existentialism. I
embraced the idea that meaning is not inher
ent in the world, but something we create
because it makes us better people.
However, something about this stance felt
hollow to me. like I was lying to myself.
Then, about a year ago, things started to
change when I began meditating more and
reading less about theories of religion. I also
began practicing more yoga and contemplat
ing less about what happens after death. I
began living life more fully while agonizing
about it less.
Gradually, a metamorphosis occurred. 1
didn't realize it until someone asked about

my views on spirituality, and I surprised
myself by identifying as a believer. I had
dropped my identity as incurably agnostic,
questioning, searching and uncertain.
My precise spiritual persuasions are diffi
cult to explain. I don't believe in any orga
nized system that neatly explains all the mys
teries of the world — the first or second
incarnation of Ciod. the immaculate concep
tion or the five stages of enlightenment. I
don't believe in purgatory, heaven or hell or
that bad people are reincarnated as slugs.
I am uninterested in "proofs" of God's
existence. If there is ;i spiritual being, she is
far too complicated for rationality to explain.
Faith means believing that there is more
to this world than rationality; that there are
miracles that our senses cannot perceive.
Conversely, it means awakening to the
knowledge that miracles, like our senses
themselves, are abundant.
I believe that death is not the end, but that
it is something like finals — a time to reflect
on what you've learned, and move on to the
next quarter. I believe that intuition is spirit
tapping at your shoulder, that love is what

happens when souls dance, and that joy is an
angel awaiting embrace.
My newfound conviction, however,
doesn't have a name, a place of worship, or
even a New Age book title. It's simply some
thing that goes on inside of me as I make my
way through time. I feel it strongest when I
walk in nature and when I paint or write. The
arts have become my practice, and the inner
musings that adjoin them are my secret ser
mons.
Organized services still make me feel like
an outsider peeking in. I guess that's where
(ilide Church comes in. It wasn't the most
profound spiritual experience that I've had,
but it was definitely the most inclusive. My
favorite part Ux>k place after a short prayer
to "the mother and the father our Lord."
With deep conviction. I responded with the
rest of the audience: "Amen. Hallelujah.
Kiyht on. Shalom. Salaam."

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philoso
phy and form of visual art, hopes that she can
bring marshniallows to the lake of fire. And
chocolate and graham crackers, too.
