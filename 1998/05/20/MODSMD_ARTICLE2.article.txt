For some people, the only real
way to tell a story is through moving
pictures drawn into the eye of a cam
era. They need to express themselves
using the veracity and sensuous qual
ities of film.

Initiation into Stanford film
ITie film arts at Stanford are limit
ed. but the film community continues
to grow rapidly as student film fans
work to project their dreams on
screen.
"I love it," said rookie filmmaker
John Norwood, a sophomore who di
rected his first video this year. "If 1
have a passion, it lies in film. I'd real
ly love to [make movies], for the rest
of my life."
Stanford is known worldwide for
its high-quality graduate documen
tary film and video program, but
there is no specific program for film
at the undergraduate level. Howev
er, it is available as a focus in the
Communication Department. Film
classes exist at Stanford, but they are
scattered through 12 different de
partments, and only one, "Introduc
tion to the Moving Image," is a pro
duction class.
Without a centralized program in
which students can learn about the
filmmaking process, independent

groups and individuals have begun
creating their own film and video
projects.

This is what I wanted to
do, find other people who
wanted to tell stories
visually.'
â€” Mark Lipawen

Senior Michael Glass said he has
directed five films in 16mm format.
Other student projects arc being pro
duced everywhere, by independent
individuals, through SCBN, by mem
bers of the Stanford Film Society and
by a young collaborative filmmaking
group called Short/.!
Short/.!, a 2-year-old effort found
ed by Stanford alumnus Mark Li
pawen, directs the collective energy
of the group for the making of indi
vidual film and video projects.
"[The group] was a culmination of
all thines I tried to do at S( BN when

I was at Stanford, basically narrative
film in video format." Lipawen said.
"Rather than going it alone. Short/!
gets people together with a vision of
telling stories."
Five students joined the video
group by application in the fall, while
the graduates of the first Short/! pro
gram have gone on to work in Super-
K film and train incoming partici
pants. Everyone writes, directs and
edits their own projects with support
and assistance of other Short/! mem
bers.
"This is what I wanted to do. find
other people who wanted to tell sto
ries visually," Lipawen added. "It's
also motivated by the fact that as an
undergrad you have few. if any. film
making opportunities."
Jonathan Levitt, the founder of
the Stanford F r ilm Society, said that
he started the society because. "As a
freshman arriving in 1995.1 was very
surprised and disappointed, realizing
