# Students living life on the screen
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
For some people, the only real
way to tell a story is through moving
pictures drawn into the eye of a cam
era. They need to express themselves
using the veracity and sensuous qual
ities of film.

Initiation into Stanford film
ITie film arts at Stanford are limit
ed. but the film community continues
to grow rapidly as student film fans
work to project their dreams on
screen.
"I love it," said rookie filmmaker
John Norwood, a sophomore who di
rected his first video this year. "If 1
have a passion, it lies in film. I'd real
ly love to [make movies], for the rest
of my life."
Stanford is known worldwide for
its high-quality graduate documen
tary film and video program, but
there is no specific program for film
at the undergraduate level. Howev
er, it is available as a focus in the
Communication Department. Film
classes exist at Stanford, but they are
scattered through 12 different de
partments, and only one, "Introduc
tion to the Moving Image," is a pro
duction class.
Without a centralized program in
which students can learn about the
filmmaking process, independent

groups and individuals have begun
creating their own film and video
projects.

This is what I wanted to
do, find other people who
wanted to tell stories
visually.'
— Mark Lipawen

Senior Michael Glass said he has
directed five films in 16mm format.
Other student projects arc being pro
duced everywhere, by independent
individuals, through SCBN, by mem
bers of the Stanford Film Society and
by a young collaborative filmmaking
group called Short/.!
Short/.!, a 2-year-old effort found
ed by Stanford alumnus Mark Li
pawen, directs the collective energy
of the group for the making of indi
vidual film and video projects.
"[The group] was a culmination of
all thines I tried to do at S( BN when

I was at Stanford, basically narrative
film in video format." Lipawen said.
"Rather than going it alone. Short/!
gets people together with a vision of
telling stories."
Five students joined the video
group by application in the fall, while
the graduates of the first Short/! pro
gram have gone on to work in Super-
K film and train incoming partici
pants. Everyone writes, directs and
edits their own projects with support
and assistance of other Short/! mem
bers.
"This is what I wanted to do. find
other people who wanted to tell sto
ries visually," Lipawen added. "It's
also motivated by the fact that as an
undergrad you have few. if any. film
making opportunities."
Jonathan Levitt, the founder of
the Stanford F r ilm Society, said that
he started the society because. "As a
freshman arriving in 1995.1 was very
surprised and disappointed, realizing


Arts at Stanford
Part 2 in a series
there's no film production and no
film studies. That's something I
wanted to rectify. I think we've made
some pretty substantial strides."
The film society supports both
film exhibition and production. Ex
hibition programs including spon
soring festivals, such as the Black
Maria, as well as independent films
toured around the country by their
directors and producers.
The film "Mary Jane's Not a Vir
gin Anymore" was a success earlier
in the year; the film society's project
entitled "Bringing Sundance to Stan
ford Initiative" also brought the films
"The Well." " The Pigeon Egg Strat
egy" and "Modulations" to campus
this spring. The Short Series pro
gram. which runs in the Coffee
House, focuses on short films on cul
tural heritage, political documen
taries, experimental and avante
garde works, according to coordina
tor Seeta Gangadharan,Class of '97.
"The film community on campus
is stronger than it's ever been,"
Levitt said. "One of the best things
that's happened [with the film soci
ety] is that it's considered an estab
lished and legitimate group, even by
its detractors. It's got staying power."
Funding
A step beyond movie exhibition is
the act of creating a film, which could
involve writing, directing and edit
ing. The filmmaking process is not
easy because of technological neces
sities, costs and the travails that face
any creative effort.
Costs arise from cameras, video
tapes, microphones, costumes and
many other necessary items.
Scrounging and filmmaking-by
credit card seem to be mainstays of
independent movie-making. Some
filmmakers even fund their films by
themselves.
Short/! is personally funded by
Lipawen.
"I wanted to give back to the
Stanford community, and I've been
fortunate enough to work some
where that's good to me." he said. "A
lot of the expenditures are capital
equipment for my own production
company if I decide to do that. And
this isn't completely altruistic.
[Short/!] allows me to discover talent
— people in the Bay Area who are
interested in film."
Lipawen. a professional surfer for
Yahoo!, provides use of a camera,
film and editing capabilities. But the
students are responsible for the inci
dentals relating to filmmaking, de
velopment of the film, reels and
other essentials.
The film society helps fund stu

dents' films hy directing a portion of
their budget toward a grant program
for independent undergraduate film
makers. "We decided not to fund
class projects," Levitt said, but any
other student project is considered.
Some of this year's grants went to
help cover the student costs associat
ed with Shortz! productions.
Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties, said the program seldomly funds
film projects. "The primary reason is
that IJRO grants have to be based in
some kind of academic work that the
students are doing, and there are not
really a lot of production classes
going on in the Communication De
partment.

'The film community on
campus is stronger than
it's ever been.'
—Jonathan Levitt

"Also, filmmaking is much more
expensive than the average IJRO
grant can help with, in terms of time
and money," Selznick added.
Communication Prof. Henry
Breitrose said, "I wish we could do
more with the undergraduates, but
it's a matter of staff and equipment.
It's been very difficult to get the Uni
versity to provide capital equip
ment."
Film classes
According to Breitrose, the Uni
versity really recognizes two levels of
support lor teaching: a chalk and a
blackboard, and major lab space for
the sciences.
"There's an idea that because
movies cost a lot of money, there's a
lot of money for film education, but
film industry money is more likely to
go to a medical school than to film
education. On the other hand, given
the constraints that we've had, 1
think we've done reasonably well."
There was recent planning for a
film minor, but after discussion, the
organizers including Breitrose, de
cided that there were not enough
qualified faculty available to support
the program.
"A minor needs a core and elec
tives, and the trick is that you need a
serious core that is taught pre
dictably," Breitrose said.
"It'll happen when the school
thinks it's of sufficient priority and
they are prepared to make an addi
tional appointment. Wonderful
things can happen if we get signifi
cant teaching support from the Uni
versity."
Equipment
Cameras and editing decks exist
in several places on campus includ

ing Meyer Library, the Communica
tion and Drama departments and
SCBN. Meyer's equipment is avail
able to all, while there are varying
levels of availability at the other loca
tions.
"The documentary film and video
program has been very helpful, but
they're not in a position to share
equipment," Levitt said.
Putting it all together
Filmmaking is more than a cam
era. It is a creative art that is blended
with all the difficulty of a technologi
cal enterprise.
"Filmmaking is just inherently
hard," Glass said. " These days, I
think anyone on the street has a pitch
for a story. To make something that
works visually, that even looks like
the lowest common denominator
standard of Hollywood, is a really
complicated process."
"There's a difference between
that original idea and the steps to the
visual presentation, to composing a
shot that's not just pretty but expres
sive, to get the whole film to have a
certain feel, editing, getting to the
sound to match, a trillion technical
problems," Glass said.
"There's an unrealism on the part
of undergraduates who don't realize
what it means to make a movie,"
Breitrose said. "It takes over your
life."
John Norwood, who made his
first film this year with Shortz!, en
countered few of these difficulties.
"With the support of a good cast
and crew, filmmaking is possible for
anybody," he said. "Just give me the
equipment. That's all I ever wanted,
all 1 never needed. Mark Lipawen,
he was sent down from heaven to
me."
Lipawen said he has learned a
great deal about filmmaking.
"You can read a script, see how a
director works, or look at footage,
but it isn't until a person sits down in
the editing room that you get an idea
of their true talent and creativity," he
said.
The future
The film community at Stanford
seems to be growing quickly as stu
dent and faculty forces combine to
develop programs and groups that
support the film arts.
Breitrose sees advancement in
the respect given to the field. "The
idea of studying mass communica
tion. film and television no longer
elicits giggles. People realize how im
portant it is," he said.
According to Breitrose, they only
"had a Bolex and a tripod" when he
first arrived to study film at Stanford
in 1%(). Perhaps in another 38 years,
what Stanford has now will seem like
a Bolex camera and a tripod.
For some people, the only real
way to tell a story is through moving
pictures drawn into the eye of a cam
era. They need to express themselves

Senior Michael Glass said he has
directed five films in 16mm format.
Other student projects arc being pro
duced everywhere, by independent
individuals, through SCBN, by mem
bers of the Stanford Film Society and
by a young collaborative filmmaking
group called Short/.!
Short/.!, a 2-year-old effort found
ed by Stanford alumnus Mark Li
pawen, directs the collective energy
of the group for the making of indi
vidual film and video projects.
"[The group] was a culmination of
all thines I tried to do at S( BN when

I was at Stanford, basically narrative
film in video format." Lipawen said.
"Rather than going it alone. Short/!
gets people together with a vision of
telling stories."
Five students joined the video
group by application in the fall, while
the graduates of the first Short/! pro
gram have gone on to work in Super-
K film and train incoming partici
pants. Everyone writes, directs and
edits their own projects with support
and assistance of other Short/! mem
bers.
"This is what I wanted to do. find
other people who wanted to tell sto
ries visually," Lipawen added. "It's
also motivated by the fact that as an
undergrad you have few. if any. film
making opportunities."
Jonathan Levitt, the founder of
the Stanford F r ilm Society, said that
he started the society because. "As a
freshman arriving in 1995.1 was very
surprised and disappointed, realizing


Arts at Stanford
Part 2 in a series
there's no film production and no
film studies. That's something I
wanted to rectify. I think we've made
some pretty substantial strides."
The film society supports both
film exhibition and production. Ex
hibition programs including spon
soring festivals, such as the Black
Maria, as well as independent films
toured around the country by their
directors and producers.
The film "Mary Jane's Not a Vir
gin Anymore" was a success earlier
in the year; the film society's project
entitled "Bringing Sundance to Stan
ford Initiative" also brought the films
"The Well." " The Pigeon Egg Strat
egy" and "Modulations" to campus
this spring. The Short Series pro
gram. which runs in the Coffee
House, focuses on short films on cul
tural heritage, political documen
taries, experimental and avante
garde works, according to coordina
tor Seeta Gangadharan,Class of '97.
"The film community on campus
is stronger than it's ever been,"
Levitt said. "One of the best things
that's happened [with the film soci
ety] is that it's considered an estab
lished and legitimate group, even by
its detractors. It's got staying power."
Funding
A step beyond movie exhibition is
the act of creating a film, which could
involve writing, directing and edit
ing. The filmmaking process is not
easy because of technological neces
sities, costs and the travails that face
any creative effort.
Costs arise from cameras, video
tapes, microphones, costumes and
many other necessary items.
Scrounging and filmmaking-by
credit card seem to be mainstays of
independent movie-making. Some
filmmakers even fund their films by
themselves.
Short/! is personally funded by
Lipawen.
"I wanted to give back to the
Stanford community, and I've been
fortunate enough to work some
where that's good to me." he said. "A
lot of the expenditures are capital
equipment for my own production
company if I decide to do that. And
this isn't completely altruistic.
[Short/!] allows me to discover talent
— people in the Bay Area who are
interested in film."
Lipawen. a professional surfer for
Yahoo!, provides use of a camera,
film and editing capabilities. But the
students are responsible for the inci
dentals relating to filmmaking, de
velopment of the film, reels and
other essentials.
The film society helps fund stu

dents' films hy directing a portion of
their budget toward a grant program
for independent undergraduate film
makers. "We decided not to fund
class projects," Levitt said, but any
other student project is considered.
Some of this year's grants went to
help cover the student costs associat
ed with Shortz! productions.
Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportuni
ties, said the program seldomly funds
film projects. "The primary reason is
that IJRO grants have to be based in
some kind of academic work that the
students are doing, and there are not
really a lot of production classes
going on in the Communication De
partment.

campus is stronger than

"Also, filmmaking is much more
expensive than the average IJRO
grant can help with, in terms of time
and money," Selznick added.
Communication Prof. Henry
Breitrose said, "I wish we could do
more with the undergraduates, but
it's a matter of staff and equipment.
It's been very difficult to get the Uni
versity to provide capital equip
ment."
Film classes
According to Breitrose, the Uni
versity really recognizes two levels of
support lor teaching: a chalk and a
blackboard, and major lab space for
the sciences.
"There's an idea that because
movies cost a lot of money, there's a
lot of money for film education, but
film industry money is more likely to
go to a medical school than to film
education. On the other hand, given
the constraints that we've had, 1
think we've done reasonably well."
There was recent planning for a
film minor, but after discussion, the
organizers including Breitrose, de
cided that there were not enough
qualified faculty available to support
the program.
"A minor needs a core and elec
tives, and the trick is that you need a
serious core that is taught pre
dictably," Breitrose said.
"It'll happen when the school
thinks it's of sufficient priority and
they are prepared to make an addi
tional appointment. Wonderful
things can happen if we get signifi
cant teaching support from the Uni
versity."
Equipment
Cameras and editing decks exist
in several places on campus includ

ing Meyer Library, the Communica
tion and Drama departments and
SCBN. Meyer's equipment is avail
able to all, while there are varying
levels of availability at the other loca
tions.
"The documentary film and video
program has been very helpful, but
they're not in a position to share
equipment," Levitt said.
Putting it all together
Filmmaking is more than a cam
era. It is a creative art that is blended
with all the difficulty of a technologi
cal enterprise.
"Filmmaking is just inherently
hard," Glass said. " These days, I
think anyone on the street has a pitch
for a story. To make something that
works visually, that even looks like
the lowest common denominator
standard of Hollywood, is a really
complicated process."
"There's a difference between
that original idea and the steps to the
visual presentation, to composing a
shot that's not just pretty but expres
sive, to get the whole film to have a
certain feel, editing, getting to the
sound to match, a trillion technical
problems," Glass said.
"There's an unrealism on the part
of undergraduates who don't realize
what it means to make a movie,"
Breitrose said. "It takes over your
life."
John Norwood, who made his
first film this year with Shortz!, en
countered few of these difficulties.
"With the support of a good cast
and crew, filmmaking is possible for
anybody," he said. "Just give me the
equipment. That's all I ever wanted,
all 1 never needed. Mark Lipawen,
he was sent down from heaven to
me."
Lipawen said he has learned a
great deal about filmmaking.
"You can read a script, see how a
director works, or look at footage,
but it isn't until a person sits down in
the editing room that you get an idea
of their true talent and creativity," he
said.
The future
The film community at Stanford
seems to be growing quickly as stu
dent and faculty forces combine to
develop programs and groups that
support the film arts.
Breitrose sees advancement in
the respect given to the field. "The
idea of studying mass communica
tion. film and television no longer
elicits giggles. People realize how im
portant it is," he said.
According to Breitrose, they only
"had a Bolex and a tripod" when he
first arrived to study film at Stanford
in 1%(). Perhaps in another 38 years,
what Stanford has now will seem like
a Bolex camera and a tripod.
For some people, the only real
way to tell a story is through moving
pictures drawn into the eye of a cam
era. They need to express themselves
using the veracity and sensuous qual
ities of film.

Initiation into Stanford film
ITie film arts at Stanford are limit
ed. but the film community continues
to grow rapidly as student film fans
work to project their dreams on
screen.
"I love it," said rookie filmmaker
John Norwood, a sophomore who di
rected his first video this year. "If 1
have a passion, it lies in film. I'd real
ly love to [make movies], for the rest
of my life."
Stanford is known worldwide for
its high-quality graduate documen
tary film and video program, but
there is no specific program for film
at the undergraduate level. Howev
er, it is available as a focus in the
Communication Department. Film
classes exist at Stanford, but they are
scattered through 12 different de
partments, and only one, "Introduc
tion to the Moving Image," is a pro
duction class.
Without a centralized program in
which students can learn about the
filmmaking process, independent

groups and individuals have begun
creating their own film and video
projects.

do, find other people who
