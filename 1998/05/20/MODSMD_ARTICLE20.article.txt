## Field ecology teaches students on science 
### Miler Lee Editorial staff 
Under the setting Mojave Desert sun, a
group of students kneels down in the sand
dunes. They watch harvester ants emerge
from underground and deposit seed husks
and debris at their nest opening. One of the
observers, Nathan Sanders, pauses for a
moment, then lifts a nearby rock to find a
half-dozen termites on the underside; he
drops the white fleshy insects near the nest.
Immediately, the ants grab the termites in
their mandibles and scurry to bring their
prizes back to the nest. "See," he tells the
others, "they've switched tasks."
Watching ants at all. much less in the
middle of the desert, may seem an unusual
activity for most Stanford students. Howev
er, this is standard fare for students in Biol
ogy IK1: Field Ecology.
This one-of-a-kind class, taught by post
doctoral fellow Diane Wagner and assisted
by biology doctoral students Sanders and
Taylor Ricketts, offers undergraduates the
opportunity to engage in hands-on learning
and research in ecology. For those in the

class, it is a refreshing and valuable depar
ture from the way science is normally
taught, in impersonal lecture halls or labo
ratories.

Wagner's aim has been to give students
practice doing science. "1 have two goals for
the class. One is to encourage students to
ask questions about the natural world. The
other is to equip them with the tools, the
ecological methods, to answer some of
those questions on their own."
To this end, students spend most of the
class hours outdoors, refining their field

skills. For five hours
every week, they
examine various eco
logical questions at
Jasper Ridge Biologi
cal Preserve. Recent
field exercises have
included investigation
of arthropod diversity
in areas infested by
Argentine ants and
study of plant distribu
tion on the serpentine
and sandstone grass
lands.
These field meth
ods have also proved
useful on the other
field trips that the class
has taken. Some of the
trips have been to the
marshlands to observe
shore birds, to Moss
Beach and Pescaderc
Beach to study inter

tidal and coastal strand communities, and to
the Granite Mountains in the Mojave
Desert to examine desert ecology.
However, the most important compo
nent of the class is not necessarily the field
exercises, but the independent projects that
each student will undertake. "Doing a lab
that someone else conceived is in some
ways like coloring in someone else's
sketch," Wagner said. "There are things
you can learn that way, but it's a lousy way
to figure out whether you like painting or
whether you're good at it.
"You could do canned labs for years and
never have any idea what it feels like to look
at the results of a study you designed: it can
be an absolute thrill."
Junior human biology major Lindsay
Stallcup agrees. "The individual project is
great because you get to create something
that you're interested in ... it's the real
thing; you're doing your own field work."
Many students taking the class feel that
this emphasis on individual learning is a rare

opportunity, especially in the sciences. "It's
more or less a one-time-onlv deal." Stallcup
said.
Although the Biology Department has
offered similar courses in the past — most
notably. Prof. Harold Mooney's Biology of
Natural Populations, which was offered
intermittently in various forms from 1970
until a few years ago — Wagner's class fills

a curricular hole in the
Biology Department.
"It's a great opportuni
ty to get hands-on experi
ence working in the
field." Stallcup added.
"What I'm learning in
field ecology is really
important for my major..
. but it's not anything
that's offered through a
traditional lecture/class
room-style class."
Her classmate, junior
biology major Michele
Flagge, shares this senti-

ment. "Out of all of the classes that 1 have
taken so far at Stanford. 1 have learned the
most information from Field Ecology. 1
think, this is a demonstration that hands-on
learning is far superior to pureK classroom -
based instruction."
Sophomore human biology major Emily
Yates-Doerr said, "Field Ecology is what I
thought college would be like."
