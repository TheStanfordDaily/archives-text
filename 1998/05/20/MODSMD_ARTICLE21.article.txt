Dear Tom,
My father is suffering from chordoma, a very
rare tumor growing on his spine. He has already
gone through three surgeries since March 1995, but
the tumor keeps growing again after each surgery.
Now, eight months from his third surgery, he has to
go through the fourth soon. Is there any alternative
way to control chordoma?

Dear Nick,
For those readers who are not aware, chordomas
are traditionally considered slow-growing and
locally invasive primary cancer cells I tumors.
Fifty percent of them occur in the sacral region
of the spine, 35 percent occur at the base of the
skull and 15 percent occur on the true vertebrae.
Onset is usually between the ages of 50 and 70 and
they appear in males twice as often as in females.
It seems as though your father is looking ahead
to additional surgical intervention, and although
that's probably as appealing to him as seeing the
dentist, current literature suggests that this is the
most common method of treatment.
I would venture a guess that a combination of
therapies is also available, such as surgery coupled
with radiation or chemotherapy treatment. How
ever, each case has individual needs and intricacies

for which your orthopedic surgeon and oncologist
know best.
Current research suggests that surgical removal
of chordomas is temporarily successful, but that
the mass, or a portion thereof, usually recurs to
some extent. In this case, additional intervention is
necessary.
Side effects of surgery can include lower back
pain, hip discomfort, and in some cases, some
degree of urinary and bowel incontinence.
Regardless, most doctors who have published in
this area rely on surgical intervention as the most
direct and best approach.
I came across an abstract from 1986 by de Vries,
et al, regarding a surgical approach called
"cryosurgery." Although the abstract did not go
into specifics concerning this procedure, it alluded
to freezing local tissue and then removing it.
The authors reported that because this frozen
tissue is susceptible to infection, infection preven
tion was very important. The authors, however, did
report a higher success rate of post-surgical sur
vival than other routine surgical techniques. It
might be worth looking into or asking your father's
doctor about.
I suppose the answer to your question is that
surgical interventions seem to be favored for this
type of condition, but other modalities exist to aug
ment treatment (i.e.. radiation therapy, chemother
apy.)
Inquire with your father's doctor as to whether
he / she feels additional interventions such as these
would be beneficial.
