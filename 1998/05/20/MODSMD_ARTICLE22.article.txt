According to a new study by Stanford researchers,
daughters taking care of sick parents face more stress
than wives taking care of sick husbands.
"This is the first evidence of differential physio
logical effects of caregiving in the natural environ
ment for daughters versus wives," said Abby King,
assistant professor of health research and policy at
the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Preven
tion.
King and colleagues measured cardiovascular
stress in daughters and wives caring at home for rela
tives with dementia.
Compared to the wives, daughters showed signifi
cantly larger increases in heart rate and blood pres
sure when interacting with the sick parent. However,
when the relative was not present, there was no dif
ference in these measures of cardiovascular stress.
The study involved 81 women living in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Most of the sick relatives suf
fered from Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease
or a stroke.
Nearly half of the women were wives caring for
their husbands, while the other half were daughters
caring for their parents.
The women were asked to walk on a treadmill
while the researchers measured their heart rate and
blood pressure. The two test groups, wives and
daughters, showed no differences in these two mea
sures when exercising.
However, when the groups were asked to talk

about their experiences taking care of their relative
while having their heart rate and blood pressure
monitored, wives showed greater increases in blood
pressure.
"Just talking about their experiences was a little
more stressful physiologically for the wives than for
the daughters." King said.
However, the trends were reversed when the
women were asked to earn a portable heart moni
toring device while actually taking care of their rela
tives at home. The data showed that daughters had
significantly larger increases in both measures of car
diovascular stress.
"Daughters recorded significantly more distress in
interpersonal interactions." King said. 'They report
ed having more difficulty relating to their care recip
ient — their father or mother — than did the wives,
and those reports were linked to increases in blood
pressure and heart rate responses."
King hypothesizes that daughters face more stress
because they are younger, have independent lives,
and may not have expected their roles as caretakers.
Both groups of women are now enrolled in a super
vised program designed to decrtase cardiovascular
stress related to their caretaking duties.
"We're interested in seeing how these interven
tions might have a positive impact on their health."
King said.
The study was part of a larger NIH-sponsorcd
research project intended to improve the health of
older caregivers, whose numbers are likely to
increase as the baby boom generation ages. About 75
percent of elderly caregivers are women.
