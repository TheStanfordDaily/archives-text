Joining the likes of President

President Elizabeth Dole, author
Michael Crichton and film director
Francis Ford Coppola, 31 Stanford
juniors and 141 Stanford seniors
were elected for membership in the
Phi Beta Kappa Society this year.
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide
society with 255 chapters that hon
ors students for excellence in their
undergraduate studies. Each chap
ter establishes its own selection cri
teria for electing new members.
Approximately 10 percent of
each graduating class is elected to
the Stanford chapter, with about
one-fifth of this number chosen
during their junior year. Thirty-two
current seniors were elected during
their junior year.
Chapter Secretary Jane Marcus

said the election process at Stan
ford "is pretty rigorous in terms of
the selection committee looking
for excellence and breadth."
Marcus, a computing informa
tion systems analyst at Information
Technology Systems and Services,
explained that election to Stan
ford's chapter is not merely based
on grade-point average.
"It's possible that someone with
a very high GPA will not get in."
she said.
In addition to GPA. the selec
tion committee looks for excellent
performance in a variety of courses
in the natural sciences, social sci
ences and humanities.
"In the short run. it's a very high
academic distinction," said
Michele Marincovich, director of
the Center for Teaching and
Learning and former secretary of
the chapter. "In the long run, it puts
you in a community of people who

are serious about intellectual life."
Marincovich explained that the
organization fosters an "intellectu
al community" through newslet
ters, guest speakers and updates on
new books and ideas in various aca
demic fields.
"It's definitely a nice way to end
my time at Stanford," coterminal
psychology student Scott Judd said
Senior Sarna Renfro, a human
biology major, said. "Part of me
wants to make sure that it doesn't
become kind of an exclusivist thing
... putting something on your re
sume just for the sake of putting it
on your resume."
The Greek letters Phi Beta Kappa
are an acronym for the organization's
motto that translates to "Love of wis
dom. the guide of life."
Initiates receive a golden key
with an image of a pointing finger
and three stars. These represent
the ambition of young scholars and

the three principles of the organi
zation: friendship, morality and
learning.
Founded in 1776 at the College
of William and Mary, Phi Beta
Kappa then expanded to include
chapters at other universities.
The academic records of all
Stanford students are automatical
ly reviewed by the chapter's selec
tion committee. Students' names
are removed from their records to
ensure anonymity.
The Stanford chapter's initia
tion ceremony will be at 7:30 p.m.
on Friday, June 12 in Memorial
Auditorium. The featured speaker
will be William Halter, Class of '83,
a member of the Board of Trustees
and senior adviser at the Office of
Management and Budget in Wash
ington, D.C.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
trustee Judge Pamela Rymer will
also be at the ceremony.
