# International Knight Fellows named
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Eight journalists from around the globe have
been awarded John S. Knight Fellowships, the Uni
versity announced Monday.
Among the print and broadcast journalists se
lected are the program's first black reporter from
South Africa and the first Knight Fellow from
Spain in 10 years.
Knight Fellowship Deputy Director James Bet
tinger called the group "more international than
we've had in some years. They are all individually
accomplished."
Twelve U.S. journalists were named Knight Fel
lows earlier this month. Like their domestic coun
terparts. the international fellows — who are re
quired to be fluent in English — will pursue inde
pendent courses of study and participate in special
seminars during their year at Stanford.

While their areas of origin may differ. Bettinger
said all the journalists are at relatively similar points
in their careers. The program attracts "mid-career
journalists who take a year off and then go back" to
better their papers and stations, he said.
Bettinger. a one-time Knight Fellow, praised
the international side of the program.
In his time as a fellow, "the single most unex
pected benefit for me was the presence of the in
ternational fellows because it broadened my per
spective," Bettinger said.
The eight fellows and their planned areas of
study include:
• Maria Abraham, senior correspondent. The
Week, Bombay, India; studying management of
AIDS in the United States compared to Asian
countries.
