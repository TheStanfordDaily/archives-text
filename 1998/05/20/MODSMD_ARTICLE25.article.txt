# ASSU agrees to speaker's airfare
## Film Society funded

Australian director Samantha
Lang presented her film, "The
Well," in Cubberley Auditorium
on April 25. The day before her ar
rival, the Stanford Film Society
still did not know how they were
going to pay for her $4,400 plane
ticket.
The film society had to take
care of an unexpected procedural
snag in accessing their special-fee
money in order to fund the ticket.
The film society had agreed —
in accordance with Lang's agent —
that the organization would pay
for Lang's $4,400 airfare from Syd
ney along with a very small hono
rarium to compensate her for her
appearance.
However, the film society's
ASSU special-fee budget included
no provision for travel expenses in
its itemized budget. Without this
expense category, the film society
was unable to access the $11,000 in
its ASSU special-fee funds left for
the school year.
By classifying the airfare as an
honorarium, a category that was
already part of the film society's
budget, the ASSU was able to
transfer funds to this category of
the film society budget and pay for
Lang's airfare.
"Technically, the ticket was a
travel expense, but in terms of our
agreement [with Lang], the air
plane ticket also functioned as a
partial honorarium," said film soci
ety secretary Catherine Chang, a
senior.
Chang also pointed out that in
this arrangement with Lang, the
airplane ticket would substitute for
the larger honorarium she custom
arily receives at speaking engage
ments.

When an organization seeks a
special fee in the ASSU election, it
must present an itemized budget to
the voting students for approval.
While it is fairly common for or
ganizations to make minor adjust
ments in their budgets during the
school year, there is no precedent
for creating a new expense catego
ry midyear.
"The original problem was that
they wanted to transfer funds to a
line item that didn't exist," said
ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee Chair Maren Norton.
"We realized we could transfer the
funds to a line-item expense that
existed and cleared that up."
"As long as the line items exist,
line-item transfers happen all the
time," Norton added. "We don't
mind being slightly flexible in that
regard."
However, Norton noted that
the amount of the line item trans
fer was "more major than most."
The film society's screening was
a success.
According to Chang, over 300
people attended the film screen
ing, and about 75 more stayed after
the screening for a 40-minute ques
tion-and-answer session with
Lang, whose film was shown at
both the Cannes and Sundance
Film Festivals.
Borofsky also gained an im
proved understanding of the
ASSU's protocol for financial mat
ters.
"There are a lot of procedures
that financial managers in general,
and also student associations,
don't really quite understand," she
said.
"There's a lack of communica
tion between the ASSU and stu
dent groups. We had to get on that
communication to make sure our
check got processed."
