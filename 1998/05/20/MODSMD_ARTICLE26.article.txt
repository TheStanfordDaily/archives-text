■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford placed
second overall in the road race na
tional championship in Greensville,
S.C. Medical student Cynthia Fergu
son led individual finishers, taking
the women's omnium title.

Leading the Stanford team was
medical student Cynthia Ferguson,
who not only won the women's road
race but also the women's individual
omnium title — the top rider award
for the entire year's competition.
Several other Cardinal riders
also placed high in the road race and
in the team time trials. Five men and
five women made up Stanford's
team.
For the past three years, Stanford
has won both the national champi
onship at the road race competition
and the omnium title, given to the
best combined team for the year in
road, track and mountain biking
competitions.
In this year's intense competition
Stanford was uprooted by the Uni

versity of Colorado-Boulder, a team
it knew would make for stiff compe
tition.
Track racing and mountain bike
nationals are held in the fall. In
order to earn the omnium title, the
Stanford team would have had to
finish at least four places higher than
Colorado at last weekend's race.
"They always have a good team,"
doctoral student Pete Armitage said
of Colorado. " They were a very,
very close third last year and are al
ways a threat."
A number of graduations last
year made the difference for the
Stanford cyclists. "I thought we had
a very good chance," Armitage said,
"but our men's team lacked depth."
Colorado did more than keep
ahead of Stanford — the team won
the road competition. Colorado
ended the year with 497 points com
pared to Stanford's 430. Florida
came in third with 324 points.
The Stanford team had to adjust
for hot, humid weather as well as a
flatter course than it trains on.
A number of Stanford riders fin
ished well at the road nationals, de
spite the unfavorable conditions.
Medical student Megan Troxell fin
ished second in the women's criteri
um. while Armitage placed seventh
in the men's criteriuni. Doctoral stu
dent Dario Falquier also had a
strong performance in the men's
road race.
