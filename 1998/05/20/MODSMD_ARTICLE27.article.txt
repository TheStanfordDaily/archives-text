# Women's golf heads to NCAAs

### Will Flemming Staff writer 
From the first day of fall practice, Stanford women's
golf head coach Caroline O'Connor told her players to
view every event as a stepping stone toward the postsea
son.
O'Connor knew that her young team had the kind of
talent it takes to win a national championship and didn't
want early-season discouragement to knock the team off
its course.
So far. O'Connor's strategy has been extremely effec
tive, and the Cardinal has gained valuable experience and
perspective while winning several tournaments. As the
team walked off the course at the Western Regional after
a third-place finish, O'Connor said she had her team "ex
actly where she wanted them."

■ Today-Saturday: Stanford competes in the NCAA
Championships. Madison, Wise.

It is now the dawn of the NCAA Championships in
Madison. Wise.
With the memories of a rain-soaked winter and an in
consistent spring dancing in the back of its head, the Car
dinal must find a way to tap into its best golf and put the
last piece of O'Connor's puzzle into place.
As the team left the Farm on Saturday, O'Connor was
confident in where it stood and its progress throughout
this long campaign.
O'Connor told her players before they departed for the
defining tournament of the year that all the pieces were in
place and the team only had to maintain its current level of
play.
The Cardinal has a group of young players near the top
of their games, prepared to make some noise at the high
est level.
"Coach didn't want anyone changing their swings or
making any drastic changes," said freshman Lauren
Robertson. "This is not the time of year to be changing the
foundations of your golf game. Coach feels we are in a
great position right now and that if we play the way we
should, we will be right near the top in this tournament."
The tournament features the top teams in the nation,

and Stanford figures to challenge
them all. Western Regional champi
on Arizona, the No.l team in the na
tion, is the favorite. Arizona State,
which finished second behind the
Wildcats in the West, is another
team to look out for. The Duke Blue
Devils appear to be the most serious
challenger from the East.
Another opponent for Stanford
will be the weather. At the Universi
ty Ridge Golf Course in Madison,
the Card will have to overcome hot
and muggy conditions and slick, un
dulating greens if it hopes to bring
home the hardware.
"The weather is pretty unpleas
ant out there," said freshman
Stephanie Keever. "The heat will
definitely be a factor, and the team
that manages it the best will defi
nitely have an advantage."
As far as the tricky putting sur
faces, the Card has had two full prac
tice rounds to adapt to their speed

and multiple breaks.
"Coach wanted everyone to
focus on the greens in the practice
rounds," Robertson said. "It is obvi
ous how important putting is — you
can't just be satisfied with hitting the
most greens. You have to get the
ball in the hole."
However, the iron plav cannot be
underestimated, as ball position is a
big step toward managing difficult
greens.
"If you put the ball in the right
place on the greens, you can find
some easy putts out there," Robert
son said. "The hole is just as round
and flat there as it is anywhere, and
if you put yourself on or near that
flat area, you are fine."
Needless to say. Stanford has its
work cut out in Wisconsin.
After all. this is just the first na
tional championship that this young
team has experienced together,
right?
Despite that, there is no reason it
can't bring home a national title if
the Cardinal finds a way to peak in
Madison.
