# Women's golf heads to NCAAs

### Will Flemming Staff writer 
From the first day of fall practice, Stanford women's
golf head coach Caroline O'Connor told her players to
view every event as a stepping stone toward the postsea
son.
O'Connor knew that her young team had the kind of
talent it takes to win a national championship and didn't
want early-season discouragement to knock the team off
its course.
So far. O'Connor's strategy has been extremely effec
tive, and the Cardinal has gained valuable experience and
perspective while winning several tournaments. As the
team walked off the course at the Western Regional after
a third-place finish, O'Connor said she had her team "ex
actly where she wanted them."

■ Today-Saturday: Stanford competes in the NCAA
Championships. Madison, Wise.

It is now the dawn of the NCAA Championships in
Madison. Wise.
With the memories of a rain-soaked winter and an in
consistent spring dancing in the back of its head, the Car
dinal must find a way to tap into its best golf and put the
last piece of O'Connor's puzzle into place.
As the team left the Farm on Saturday, O'Connor was
confident in where it stood and its progress throughout
this long campaign.
O'Connor told her players before they departed for the
defining tournament of the year that all the pieces were in
place and the team only had to maintain its current level of
play.
The Cardinal has a group of young players near the top
of their games, prepared to make some noise at the high
est level.
"Coach didn't want anyone changing their swings or
making any drastic changes," said freshman Lauren
Robertson. "This is not the time of year to be changing the
foundations of your golf game. Coach feels we are in a
great position right now and that if we play the way we
should, we will be right near the top in this tournament."
The tournament features the top teams in the nation,
