# Women's tennis ready for another title
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
After 12 months of enjoying last
year's dream season, the defending na
tional champion Stanford women's ten
nis team seeks to repeat as NCAA
champs this week at Notre Dame.
Last May. the Cardinal ran through
opponents on its way to the crown, beat
ing all four of its opponents without even
having to play doubles. A stacked Stan
ford lineup featuring eventual NCAA
singles champion Lilia Osterloh and
four-time All-American Katie Schluke
bir had no trouble at all, even against un
defeated and top-seeded Florida in the
final match.

The joy ride continued into this year
as the Cardinal (24-1) reeled off IX
straight wins to start the season. A shock
ing loss to then-No. 16 UCLA cost the
Cardinal its No. 1 ranking and the top
seed in the NCAA draw, but the team
nevertheless finished the season strong
with a five-match winning streak and its
11 th-straight Pacific 10 Conference
championship.
Still, the road to the title will not be as
smooth as it was a year ago, when the
Cardinal hosted the NCAA Champi
onships.
The team that most threatens a Stan
ford repeat this weekend in South Bend
is No. 1 Florida (23-0), yet again.
The Cardinal and the Gators have

quite a rivalry in women's tennis. In the
past two years, the squads have met in the
NCAA finals, with each team emerging
as champion once.
Two years ago in Tallahassee, it was
the Gators who took the title in front of a
raucous Florida audience. But the Cardi
nal avenged that last season, handing
Florida its first loss in 62 matches in sin
gles, 5-1.
I'his year the Gators are as strong as
ever.
Undefeated in 23 dual matches, the
Gators moved into the top spot in the
rankings after the Cardinal lost to the
Bruins. The Florida lineup boasts the na
tion's No. 11 singles player, senior Daw n
Buth. who has compiled a 16-6 record.

Senior Bonnie Bleeker is undefeated lor
the Gators, with a 20-0 record in the No.
6 spot.
In doubles. Florida has the No. 3 tan
dem in the nation â€” two-time defending
NCAA champs Buth and junior
Stephanie Niekitas. who are 15-2 for the
Gators this year. Florida and Stanford,
the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds, respectively,
can only meet in the finals.
Before even starting to think about
Florida or the title, the ( ardinal has three
matches to win.
The other top seeds. No. 3 Duke and
No. 4 Georgia, are gunning for the title as
well. Led bv the third-ranked singles
