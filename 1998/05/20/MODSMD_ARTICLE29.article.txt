# Success is no sweat for tennis' Wolters
## 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
You begin to get an idea of the kind of guy Ryan
Wolters is when he keeps apologizing for not getting
back to you earlier and you only called a few hours ago.
As his coach puts it, "Ryan is one of the most out
standing young men I've ever coached both on and off
the court."
A junior, Wolters is currently ranked 21st in the
country — but rankings aren't what he's after.
"I just try to have fun," he said. "I try not to put too
much pressure on myself. If you're not having fun doing
what you're doing, then you shouldn't be doing it. That's
why I play tennis —I'm out there every day having fun."
That's not to say Wolters isn't one of the toughest
competitors around.
Wolters was considering Georgia, Texas and USC in
addition to Stanford, and though academics were an ob
vious factor in his choice, he also said Stanford's NCAA
record influenced him.
"One of my goals was to win a national champi
onship." Wolters said. "Looking at Stanford's NCAA
record, if you stay for four years, you're guaranteed to
win at least one championship."
One of the top recruits coming into Stanford.
Wolters posted an excellent 22-3 record last year at first
singles.
But head coach Dick Gould said things have only re
cently started to come together for Wolters.
"To tell you the truth," Gould said, "he didn't play
that well last year, but he still had one of the best records
ever at No. 1 singles. That just tells you how good of a
player he is. He's a much better player this year — once
he got going, he was phenomenal."
Wolters struggled through a back injury for the last
part of the summer and all of fall quarter after he pulled

a muscle in his back in early August.
"1 didn't pick up a racket for two months," he said. "1
had no mobility — 1 couldn't even get my socks on. It
was really devastating to me both physically and men
tally."
Even after two months of recuperation, Wolters was
not up to 1(X) percent when he finally returned.
When Wolters competed in the Rolex Northern Cal

ifornia Men's Intercollegiate Tennis Championships in
the fall, he fell to Washington's Robert Kendrick in the
quarterfinals, a player he has since beaten twice.
"It was frustrating to me to know that if 1 wasn't in
jured I would have been able to beat him. Wolters said.
Having to stay off the court was onlv one of Wolters'

member of the Cardinal men's tennis team.
concerns this fall.
Referring to a white board in his
room. Wolters said. "Yeah, when I
couldn't play for two months, I just
sat around and got kind of fat. So I
wrote 'Fat' up on my board, and
that's been my nickname ever since.
Well, not really."
But regardless of weight gain, it
was not until February that Wolters
felt he had fully recovered. Since
then, he has not lost a dual match.
"I'm playing vpry wellnpw.rniity
as good of shape as I've ever been

in,"he said.
Still, he often does not get as
much recognition and publicity as
some of his teammates. Rut Gould is
full of praise.
"One of the main reasons the
team is so good is because of Ryan,"
Gould said. "There is no better
sportsman in the world than he is. He
is extremely unselfish, a model citi
zen, a great competitor and a
tremendous individual. Everyone on
the team likes him and admires him."
Wolters said tennis is his focus
right now and he plans to play pro
fessionally. But he said he also
knows that there is more to tennis
than just the competition.

"I think the thing I enjoy the most
is the camaraderie of the players,"
he said. "We all live together, play
together and travel together. We're
all so close and really enjoy hanging
out with each other.
"Tennis has brought me so many
opportunities. For the most part, it
has enabled me to do more than I
would ever have been able to do
otherwise."
And although he. like any other
talented college player, has consid
ered going pro instead of finishing
college, Wolters said getting his de
gree in economics important.
"1 definitely plan to graduate and
get my degree," Wolters said. "I

made that commitment to myself
and the people around me. I know I
can only play tennis for so many
years before I have to get out there
and make a real living and get a real
job."
For now, Wolters is Icxiking for
ward to the upcoming NCAA cham
pionships in Athens, Ga.
"I expect what everyone else ex
peels — we won't be satisfied unless
we come back with the national
championship trophy." he said.
"Gould keeps telling us that we've
had an unbelievable year, but an un
believable year won't mean any
thing if we lose."
Not that there's any pressure.
