# Success is no sweat for tennis' Wolters

You begin to get an idea of the kind of guy Ryan
Wolters is when he keeps apologizing for not getting
back to you earlier and you only called a few hours ago.
As his coach puts it, "Ryan is one of the most out
standing young men I've ever coached both on and off
the court."
A junior, Wolters is currently ranked 21st in the
country — but rankings aren't what he's after.
"I just try to have fun," he said. "I try not to put too
much pressure on myself. If you're not having fun doing
what you're doing, then you shouldn't be doing it. That's
why I play tennis —I'm out there every day having fun."
That's not to say Wolters isn't one of the toughest
competitors around.
Wolters was considering Georgia, Texas and USC in
addition to Stanford, and though academics were an ob
vious factor in his choice, he also said Stanford's NCAA
record influenced him.
"One of my goals was to win a national champi
onship." Wolters said. "Looking at Stanford's NCAA
record, if you stay for four years, you're guaranteed to
win at least one championship."
One of the top recruits coming into Stanford.
Wolters posted an excellent 22-3 record last year at first
singles.
But head coach Dick Gould said things have only re
cently started to come together for Wolters.
"To tell you the truth," Gould said, "he didn't play
that well last year, but he still had one of the best records
ever at No. 1 singles. That just tells you how good of a
player he is. He's a much better player this year — once
he got going, he was phenomenal."
Wolters struggled through a back injury for the last
part of the summer and all of fall quarter after he pulled

a muscle in his back in early August.
"1 didn't pick up a racket for two months," he said. "1
had no mobility — 1 couldn't even get my socks on. It
was really devastating to me both physically and men
tally."
Even after two months of recuperation, Wolters was
not up to 1(X) percent when he finally returned.
When Wolters competed in the Rolex Northern Cal

ifornia Men's Intercollegiate Tennis Championships in
the fall, he fell to Washington's Robert Kendrick in the
quarterfinals, a player he has since beaten twice.
"It was frustrating to me to know that if 1 wasn't in
jured I would have been able to beat him. Wolters said.
Having to stay off the court was onlv one of Wolters'


Junior Ryan Wolters has swung back from an injury and is in top form finishing his third season as a
member of the Cardinal men's tennis team.
