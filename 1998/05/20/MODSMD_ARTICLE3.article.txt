## Secret Service agents share all in Wilbur panel

Two U.S. Secret Service agents let Rin
conada in on their big secret last night: the
earpieces they wear are actually just police
radios.
A large crowd gathered in the Rinconada
lounge to hear what special agents Hector
Barron, who works on the detail for fresh
man Chelsea Clinton, and Matt Preston,
from the San Jose field office, had to say
about their occupation as special agents.
The two agents answered questions about
their personal experiences and showed an in
formational video.
One student asked, "When you see some
one who's trying to be bad ass, do you ever
think, "I could break you?' "
"There is that temptation," Preston an
swered jokingly.
The agents are trained in firearms, de

fense, investigation and even offensive dri
ving, Preston said.
The roughly 2,(KX) U.S. special agents' job
descriptions include both protection and in
vestigation, Barron explained.
Protection is provided not only for the
president and his family but also for impor
tant officials, including the vice president and
the secretary of the treasury. Protection is
also provided for visiting heads of state from
other countries, a duty Barron called "for
eign gigs."
Some officials are, according to the
agents, especially noteworthy. President
Jimmy Carter, for example, allows his detail
to hunt and fish on his farm in Georgia. Bar
ron said.
The other part of their job. investigation,
involves mostly white-collar crimes, accord

nally established to investigate
counterfeiting of U.S. currency and
has since expanded into other types
of fraud.
Barron and Preston related per
sonal stories of being in the line of
lire. Preston said he once nearly
shot a suspect who appeared to be
reaching for his gun.
"Shoot or don't shoot is one of
the scariest decisions you have to
make," he said.
A special agent's job is to be
aware of danger at all times. "You

keep thinking of everything that
could go wrong," Barron explained.
The job is very serious, and you
can't joke around much on duty,
Barron added.
Off-duty is a different story,
however.
"Some of the wildest people I
know are agents." Preston said.
The two agents' humor chal
lenged traditional perceptions of
Secret Service agents as stoic and
serious.
"You could actually joke
around" with them, freshman Mark
Hoover noted.
When asked about stereotypes.
Hector retorted, "A lot of them are

true." Preston then put on his sun
glasses to pose for the crowd.
When asked about his experi
ences this year at Stanford. Barron
said he is enjoying his time, espe
cially interacting with the students.
Hector said it's easy to pick out
suspicious people around campus.
"You guys have all the same man
nerisms," he explained.
The agents have an office in Rin
conada. "They're really nice," said
freshman Sylvia Lin. a resident of
the dorm.
"They're real, normal people,"
said senior Angelika Rampal, the
Rinconada resident assistant who
arranged the program.
