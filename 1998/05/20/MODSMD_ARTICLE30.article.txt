# Extra! Extra! Bek replaces Va
## Left out again 
### 
Ever since Va left me for the greater world of the
WNBA, I have been conducting a massive search for a
replacement. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one, so I
turned to m\ roommate, Becky. Some people think
she 's kind of funny, and even though she won 't he
playing professional basketball, she's sort of an ac
complished athlete in her own mind.
Kohin: Hi. Bek. Welcome to the column.
Belt: Hidy-ho. Robin.
Kohin: It's so nice that you were able to take time out
of your busy schedule to talk to me. Besides. 1 need
ed to replace Va, and you were my last choice ... I
mean first choice. And luckily, you were available.
Bek: Why thank you. Poll\ Prissvpants. I'm glad 1
could help out.

Kohin: That's great, but don't call me Polly Prissy
pants or Nanny-boo or any other name.
So this week's topic is perspectives from the left
out. Becky, you always seem to be left out so you must
be an expert. What kind of qualifications do you have
to shed light on the topic?
Bek: W ell. I 'm pretty much left out of everything and
have been since I was a child. You could sav that I'm
out of the loop.
Kohin: What do you mean, since you were a child?
Bek: It started when I was 8. at least that's as early as
I can remember. All previous memories have been
repressed.
My parents threw a huge surprise party for me on
my birthday. They took me out to dinner so that
everyone could go to my house. W hen I got back from
the bathroom, my parents were gone. By the time I
found a ride home from the restaurant, everyone was
leaving my house, but it Itxiked like they had a great
time.
Kohin: Is that all? That's nothing. Granted. 1 don't
think I've ever met anyone who's been left out of her
own surprise party, but come on. I've hung out with
you. and you're not that much fun at parties anvway.
Bek: You raise a valid point, but my friends could
have at least left my presents instead of taking them
home.
1 have indeed been left out of other things. For in
stance. The Daily ran an article on the softball team
about senior day. 1 am. in fact, a senior on the softball
team and was left out entirely from the article.
