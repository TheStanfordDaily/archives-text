# Extra! Extra! Bek replaces Va
## Left out again 
### 
Ever since Va left me for the greater world of the
WNBA, I have been conducting a massive search for a
replacement. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one, so I
turned to m\ roommate, Becky. Some people think
she 's kind of funny, and even though she won 't he
playing professional basketball, she's sort of an ac
complished athlete in her own mind.
Kohin: Hi. Bek. Welcome to the column.
Belt: Hidy-ho. Robin.
Kohin: It's so nice that you were able to take time out
of your busy schedule to talk to me. Besides. 1 need
ed to replace Va, and you were my last choice ... I
mean first choice. And luckily, you were available.
Bek: Why thank you. Poll\ Prissvpants. I'm glad 1
could help out.

Kohin: That's great, but don't call me Polly Prissy
pants or Nanny-boo or any other name.
So this week's topic is perspectives from the left
out. Becky, you always seem to be left out so you must
be an expert. What kind of qualifications do you have
to shed light on the topic?
Bek: W ell. I 'm pretty much left out of everything and
have been since I was a child. You could sav that I'm
out of the loop.
Kohin: What do you mean, since you were a child?
Bek: It started when I was 8. at least that's as early as
I can remember. All previous memories have been
repressed.
My parents threw a huge surprise party for me on
my birthday. They took me out to dinner so that
everyone could go to my house. W hen I got back from
the bathroom, my parents were gone. By the time I
found a ride home from the restaurant, everyone was
leaving my house, but it Itxiked like they had a great
time.
Kohin: Is that all? That's nothing. Granted. 1 don't
think I've ever met anyone who's been left out of her
own surprise party, but come on. I've hung out with
you. and you're not that much fun at parties anvway.
Bek: You raise a valid point, but my friends could
have at least left my presents instead of taking them
home.
1 have indeed been left out of other things. For in
stance. The Daily ran an article on the softball team
about senior day. 1 am. in fact, a senior on the softball
team and was left out entirely from the article.

Robin: I had no idea you were on the
softball team, I mean, left out of the
article. That must've been a lame
softball writer.
Bek: I can't really comment on that
because the writers don't speak to
me about softball.
Robin: Well. I'm sure it was an hon
est mistake. Everything else in soft
ball stories is true.
Since we've established that
you're an expert on being left out,
let's talk about your perspectives.
The men's basketball team did well
this vear and had lots of exciting.

sold-out games. What did you think
of the Stanford-UCLA game?
Bek: I did go to that game, but actu
ally, I was left outside. They didn't
have enough room for everyone,
and I was left out. I did sort of wan
der around Maples trying to get in.
It did sound like an exciting
game, you're right. I heard intermit
tent roars from the crowd. I could
only assume that we had dime some
thing good to elicit such cheers.
Robin: That's pathetic. Anything
else about the game?
Bek: Yes, I was standing with my
face smashed against the fence,
thinking that maybe I could see
through the doors, and a nice red
coat yelled at me and told me to go

home and get a life. Lovely advice. I
think.
Robin: Sounds fascinating. Let's
move on. I'll is year was the 10()th
Big Game, and I'm sure you were
there. Wasn't that a great finish to
the game?
Bek: I didn't actually see the end of
the game, so I can't really comment.
I had every intention of going but
was unable to get in.
Robin: Sounds familiar. What hap
pened this time?
Bek: Apparently, my coach neglect
ed to list me on the player pass ros
ter. so the red coat wouldn't let me
in. I tried begging and then crying,
but he told me to leave and get a life.
I can tell you, however, that the

parking lot was packed with cars
right up to the end of the game. I
could hear cheers during that one,
too — it really sounded like a lot of
fun. People seemed to be really ex
cited after the game.
Robin: You must have an interesting
relationship with the red coats. Well,
I have to go to class in a few minutes,
so we're going to end the column
now. I figure that with your experi
ence. being left out of the rest of it
won't be too much to handle.

Becky would like to say that in all
honesty, she has never had a nega
tive experience with a red coat. But
that doesn 't apply to the OKC WH
chocolate milk.
