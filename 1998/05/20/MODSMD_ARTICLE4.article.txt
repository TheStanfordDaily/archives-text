# Tresidder will stay open later
## Wais extends hours until 2 a.m. 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
The first floor of Tresidder I Jnion
will stay open until 2 a.m. for the last
three weeks of the quarter. Dean of
Students Marc Wais announced to
the ASSU Senate last night.
The Senate also certified the
spring runoff election, confirmed
nominees to 4<) University commit
tees and passed several minor bills in
a 30-minute flurry of a meeting in
Law School Room 190.
The extended hours — scheduled
to begin May 26 and to continue until
the quarter ends — represent a joint
venture between Wais' office and the
ASSU. They are contingent on
ASSU recruitment of students to

work as paid "monitors" to supervise
the area between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m.
"One of the themes I keep hear
ing." Wais said, "has been the desire
to have Tresidder have extended
hours."
Negotiations for extended hours
of Tresidder food service are ongo
ing. he added.
Several candidates for ASSU
president, including junior Presi
dent-elect Maren Norton, included
longer Tresidder hours in their plat
forms.
Last night. Norton stood with
Wais during the announcement and
praised the decision.
"This is kind of a test, a step in the
right direction." she said. "It's a good
start."
The senate agreed, applauding
Wais when he finished.
"I think it's a great idea." said Sen
ate Deputy Chair Matt Spence, a
sophomore. "It's something 1 know

the ASSU had been talking about a
few months ago. I'm excited that they
acted so quickly."
Wais said that Tresidder vendors'
agreement to the proposal hinged on
the monitors, who will be paid about
$8.50 per hour to prevent theft and
vandalism during the late hours.
Wais' office will only provide funds
for the three-week trial run.and he
appealed to the senate to fund a per
manent program of extended hours.

"At this point. I'm going to say
that we'll negotiate funding at a later
date," Norton said.
After Wais' presentation, the sen
ate crammed five votes into a 20-
minute period to avoid losing quo
rum. The certification bill was passed
unanimously without debate.
Elections Commissioner Dan
Perkel. a sophomore, was not con
cerned with the senate's haste.
"There was nothing to debate," he

said.
The senate spent less than five
minutes debating the recommenda
tions of the ASSU Nominations
Commission. Junior Lisa Liao, the
commission's chair, said more than
2(X) students applied and 130 were in
terviewed for spots on University
committees. Still, some more techni
cal committees — such as the Ad
ministrative Panel on Human Sub
jects in Non-Medical Research —

were not filled due to a lack of inter
est.
"It's really hard to get people for
these," Liao said. ,
In a final burst of activity, the sen
ate approved changes in Graduate
Student Council bylaws, changed
senate bylaws to allow official senate
certification to occur up to four
weeks after an election and certified
the election of industrial engineering
coterminal student David Hutton as

a graduate senator.
Hutton had tied with his room
mate. industrial engineering cotermi-
Brian MorfUt, for the
final seat representing the School of
Engineering.
Perkel said the pair had requested
the tie be broken via coin flip; when
Senate Chair Joe Freund's toss came
up heads, the senate broke into
cheers and unanimously voted to
confirm Hutton.
