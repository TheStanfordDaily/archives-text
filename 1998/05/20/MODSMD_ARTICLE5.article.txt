# Little agreement on housing needs
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
The I Jniversity and its graduate
student? >«ree that they need more
housing. I hev disagree, however,
on where, when, what kind and
how much is needed.
A committee of administrators
and graduate students is currently
formulating a plan to build 2(H)
new spaces by fall 2(HM). but many
students claim that solution is too
small and comes too late.
"The construction of those
buildings is a couple years away, so
that's obviously inadequate." said
Alane Murdock. a doctoral stu
dent and member of the commit
tee.
Student demands come as a re
sult of a survey on graduate stu
dent housing conducted on the
World Wide Web by the Graduate
Student Council and the ASSI
Task Force on Graduate Housing.
The results of that survey were or
ganized in a report released last
week.
University officials contend,
however, that 4(K) spaces approxi
mates both the demand for hous
ing and the total debt that Housing
and Dining Services can afford.
Housing and Dining is self-sup

porting anc
therefore lim
ited in the
amount of debt
it can take on.
"That num
ber is a result
of demand but
mainly of af
ford a bi lit \

said Student Affairs Administra
tion Director Margaret Ann Fi
dlcr. another committee member.
The committee has yet to de
cide on final plans, but the most
likely site for the housing is in-fill
sites in Escondido Village, said
Assoc. Student Housing Director
Rodger Whitney.
This means that housing would
be built between and around exist
ing buildings.
Long-term solutions
Disagreement arises between
the various parties on the need for
future building. Students contend
that I.(HK) total spaces are needed,
while some administrators feel
that 4(H) will adequately meet the
demand.
"Four hundred seems to identi
fy the housing need at this point."

said University Budget Director
Tim Warner.
The task force report states that
the University denied on-campus
housing to 800 graduate students in
last year's housing lottery.
Whitney asserts that the student
claims of housing need are inflated.
"When we look at true housing
need, we look at the students who
put down on their housing form
that they will accept any Universi
ty housing, and that number is not
that high," he said.
Other members of the adminis
tration feel that more study is
needed in order to determine fu
ture plans.
"The idea is to quickly develop
400 spaces but then to develop a
master plan of what to do next." Fi
dler said.
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya agreed that
this committee should not be the
sole long-term planning vehicle.

'There's talk of additional
building, but we don't
think that there is enough
talk.'

"This group is more of an inter
mediate-term committee," he said.
He plans to meet with Assoc. Dean
of Graduate Policy Tom Wasow to
discuss longer-term plans.
The authors of the report con
tend. however, that demand for
new housing is high and evident,
and that their pleas are being ig
nored.
"There's talk of additional
building, but we don't think that
there is enough talk." said one of
the report's authors, doctoral stu
dent Stephanie Toering, also a

member of the committee.
"They just sort of nod in our di
rection."
Short-term solutions

The report sug
gests several short
term solutions, in
cluding University
purchase of off
campus apartment
buildings, the con
struction of trailer
parks and encour
aging local alumni

to rent rooms to students.
"We think that this constella
tion of short-term options is some
thing that the University should
look into," Murdock said.
Primary among these recom
mendations is a call for Stanford to
purchase area apartment build
ings.
The University "should consid
er purchasing off-campus housing
and reserving spots at a low cost for
grad students," the report suggest
ed.
According to Warner, however,
that solution makes little sense.
"That solution includes not only
buying the building but buying the
land that the building is on. and
that gets prohibitively expensive."
he said. "Since we already own a
lot of land, that isn't the most feasi
ble solution."
Another proposed solution is
the building of trailer parks. The
Schwab Residential Center re
placed a set of temporary trailers
behind Manzanita Park last year.
Since the removal of those trail
ers, however, Santa Clara County
has altered its regulations, making
it more difficult to erect trailers.
"Trailers are not something that
we have considered." Warner said.
Encouraging local alumni to
house graduate students is a plan
that has been enacted by the Med
ical School in recent years, accord
ing to Toering.
This is not a solution that the
committee or the administration

has seriously considered, accord
ing to Whitney.
Is cramming a solution?
As another short-term solution,
the University is fitting 260 extra
students into the existing space for
the 1998-99 school year. This will
be done by placing two students in
one room in Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall and by
placing three students in two-bed
room apartments in Escondido
Village.
"People are aware that these
are not optimum conditions, but
putting these rooms back in their
original configurations is not un
reasonable." Whitney said.

That solution includes not
only buying the building,
but buying the land that the
building is on, and that gets
prohibitively expensive.'
— Tim Warner

The rooms in Crothers and
C i others Memorial were originally
built as one-room doubles for
graduate students.
According to Toering, this
setup is not appropriate for gradu
ate students.
"It's unreasonable to have 25-
vear-olds in the same room that
don't know each other, but the
University has gotten itself into a
position where it has no other op
tions." she said.
Both Toering and Murdock
have asked for a guarantee from
the University that the rooms will
eventually revert to their current
configuration, but they say that no
one has been willing to make that
promise.
"It, after the 400 spaces are
built, there is still very high de
mand. consideration would he
given to keeping the rooms this
way rather than not housing stu
dents at all." Fidler said.
