The I Jniversity and its graduate
student? >Â«ree that they need more
housing. I hev disagree, however,
on where, when, what kind and
how much is needed.
A committee of administrators
and graduate students is currently
formulating a plan to build 2(H)
new spaces by fall 2(HM). but many
students claim that solution is too
small and comes too late.
"The construction of those
buildings is a couple years away, so
that's obviously inadequate." said
Alane Murdock. a doctoral stu
dent and member of the commit
tee.
Student demands come as a re
sult of a survey on graduate stu
dent housing conducted on the
World Wide Web by the Graduate
Student Council and the ASSI
Task Force on Graduate Housing.
The results of that survey were or
ganized in a report released last
week.
University officials contend,
however, that 4(K) spaces approxi
mates both the demand for hous
ing and the total debt that Housing
and Dining Services can afford.
Housing and Dining is self-sup

porting anc
therefore lim
ited in the
amount of debt
it can take on.
"That num
ber is a result
of demand but
mainly of af

said Student Affairs Administra
tion Director Margaret Ann Fi
dlcr. another committee member.
The committee has yet to de
cide on final plans, but the most
likely site for the housing is in-fill
sites in Escondido Village, said
Assoc. Student Housing Director
Rodger Whitney.
This means that housing would
be built between and around exist
ing buildings.
Long-term solutions
Disagreement arises between
the various parties on the need for
future building. Students contend
that I.(HK) total spaces are needed,
while some administrators feel
that 4(H) will adequately meet the
demand.
"Four hundred seems to identi
fy the housing need at this point."
