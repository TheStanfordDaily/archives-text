Give Me Your Password!
I'm a Hacker
I can use your password to break in to Stanford's computers. Even
if you don't tell me your password, I'll steal it off the network.
Unless, that is, you're using MacLeland or PC-Leland on your
personal computer.
Stanford is always adding security features to make it harder for
me to break in. But when you log in or check email and type your
password "in the clear," these features won't work. MacLeland
and PC-Leland make life tough for me because:
* They're free!
* They're easy to use!
* They protect your password.
* They give you taster access to computing.
They even lock your computer! Both are available on the web at:
http://www/~security/desktop/
For more information, contact Stanford's Customer Assistance at
consult@forsythe or 725-8181.
