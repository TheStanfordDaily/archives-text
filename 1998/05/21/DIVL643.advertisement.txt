DAILY STAFF
Yeah, you know
You know that weird guy in the suit?
the one who always wears a black hat and cowboy boots?
He's running for editor in chief.
But he can't get elected unless you ...
a) Stop by at noon to ask him questions during the grill session. Free food!
b) Vote between 1 and 10 p.m. at The Daily's offices
(Check the list on the front door to see if you're eligible to vote. Hint: This is not a multiple choice question.)
