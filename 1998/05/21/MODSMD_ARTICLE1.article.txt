# Van Derveer tells a tale of Title IX

Iri a lunchtime speech at Tresidder Union
yesterday, women's basketball coach Tara
VanDerveer lauded the effects of Title IX, the
1972 federal law requiring gender equity in
high school and college athletics.
"Title IX definitely changed my life," Van-
Derveer told the crowd. "I spent half of my life
not getting to play and the other half playing."
VanDerveer told the story of her lifelong in
terest in basketball, from her preteen days
shooting hoops in her neighbors' driveways in
upstate New York to her tenure as a head
coach at Stanford and the 1996 Olympic
Games.
Since her youngest days, "I've loved the
game of basketball, and I can't tell you why,"
she said.
At the age of 8 or 9, VanDerveer said, she
would diagram plays while watching the
Boston Celtics play on television. She would
also play ball by herself regularly, all the while
imagining an arena packed with people watch
ing her dribble and shoot.
As she grew older and improved as a player,
she said, she began to encounter more opposi
tion from boys not wanting to let her play.
. "I learned that the best way to get in the

game with the guys was to
bring the ball," she ex
plained.

When she entered seventh grade in a ju
nior/senior high school, she found the oldest
boys the most accepting. They let her practice
with them regularly. As was standard for the
time, her school didn't have a girls' basketball
team.
At the end of that year, the graduating se
nior star of her school's boys' basketball team
wrote a message in her yearbook.
"He wrote, 'Tara, someday you'll go to the
Olympics.' At that time (the 19605), women's
basketball wasn't an Olympic sport I won
dered whether he knew something I didn't."
With no team to play on, she said, "I had to
get my basketball fix." She became her school's
mascot, a bear, in order to get her parents to
take her to all the games. However, she refused
to cheer with the cheerleaders during the
game.
"What do you mean 'cheer'? I'm watching
the game," she told them. She was fired
halfway through the season.
VanDerveer moved with her family when
she was 15. She decided at that point that she
was too old for basketball.

"I definitely got the message
that girls playing basketball wasn't
coolâ€” To be cool in this town, you
had to cruise up and down Main
Street and drink beer, and 1 didn't
even like beer." She tried out to be
a cheerleader but withdrew after
her shirt split down the middle dur
ing her tryout.
At Indiana University, shortly
after the passage of Title IX, Van-
Derveer worked as a waitress to
pay the extra fee required of
women's basketball players. Mens'
players, on the other hand, received
full scholarships to play for Bobby
Knight.
"It never occured to us that this
was wrong," she said.
After she graduated, her parents
were supportive but somewhat du
bious when she announced her
plans to become a women's basket
ball coach.
"There were no full-time jobs in
coaching" for women, she said.
Women's coaches were graduate
students or part-time employees.
But Title IX began to even the
playing field, and VanDerveer
held several head coaching posi
tions before taking the job at
Stanford in 1985.
"My playing timing was bad. but
my coaching timing was great."
