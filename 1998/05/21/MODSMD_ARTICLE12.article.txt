after crushing an abortive leftist coup in 1965.
Backed by fellow military officers, he reined
in and then replaced Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno in 1967.
He turned around a country that had been
in social and political chaos and on the brink
of economic ruin, and his supporters praise
him for creating stability and reducing pover
ty.
His critics say he lorded over a system rid
dled with corruption, nepotism and collusion,
and they condemn him for suppressing dis
sent. ignoring human rights and enriching his
six multi-millionaire children as well as other
relatives and friends.
