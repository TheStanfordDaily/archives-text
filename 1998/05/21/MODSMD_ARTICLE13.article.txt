# Satellite loses sight of Earth, millions left without pagers

GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) — From one end
Of the continent to the other, millions of pagers
sjopped beeping, gas pumps wouldn't take credit
cjtrds and TV and radio broadcasts were knocked
off the air — all because a single satellite rolled out
of position. It was a stark demonstration of the
vulnerability of technology and just how depen
dent we have become on instant communication.
The chaos began Tuesday evening when a
satellite owned by PanAmSat of Greenwich sud
denly lost track of Earth, knocking out service to
an estimated SO percent to 90 percent of the
nation's 45 million or so pagers. PanAmSat imme
diately began shifting signals onto other PanAm-
Sat satellites but said yesterday that it will take
about a week to restore service to everyone.
; Doctors, midwives, TV meteorologists, law
officers — even drug dealers — scrambled to find
ways to cope with the technology meltdown.
» Some hospitals turned on dusty loudspeaker
systems that hadn't been used in years, credit card
users actually had to walk into gas stations and pay
an attendant, and people who are used to going
out while they are on call had to stay by the phone.
I Ralph Griffith of Piano, Texas, was among
those who stayed close to home. He was waiting to
hear about the lung transplant he needs. "I don't
t+iink I'm going to leave until this is straightened
9ut," he said.
The $250 million Galaxy IV satellite rotated
out of its proper position after its onboard com
puter control system and a backup system failed.
. PanAmSat said such an outage was unprece

dented. The overall industry loss of satellites in
orbit is less than 1 percent over the last five years.
"It's a real longshol," said Frederick Landman,
chief executive and president.
PanAmSat would not say how many customers
were affected. But Scott Baradell. a spokesman
for Texas-based pager service PageNet, estimated
that (SO percent to 90 percent of the nation's pager
users lost service. Landman said the paging indus
try relies so heavily on the satellite because of its
power and its central location over the continent.
The satellite stays in orbit 22,300 miles up. approx
imately over Kansas, an attractive spot for ground
based stations to point at.
PanAmSat said that it does not know why the
computer system failed but that it has virtually
ruled out sabotage or the possibility that the satel
lite was hit by something in space.
The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission. William Kennard. said the agency
would look into what went wrong and make rec
ommendations to the industry.
"We have the best communication system in
the world, until it has a hiccup and then we realize
just how dependent we are." said Jeffrey Kagan.
president of Kagan Telecomm Associates of
Atlanta, a communications consulting firm.
Some TV and radio stations were knocked off
the air. and others were inconvenienced. Don
Harman, a meteorologist at WOWK-TV in
Charleston. W.Va.. said he was unable to look at
developing weather patterns, making long-term
forecasting nearly impossible.

Chevron s;iid the satellite outage halted pay-at
the-pump service at 5,4U() of 7.7(H) its gasoline sta
tions. The pumps depend on the PanAmSat satel
lite to transmit credit card information for
approval.
At the University of Pennsylvania Health Sys
tem in Philadelphia, nearly all 2.1 XX) pagers were
idled, forcing it to pull old wire-based pagers out
of storage, said Dr. David Shulkin. chief medical
officer. The hospital, like many others across the
country, also turned to its antiquated loudspeaker
system. "It's a very noisy place in the hospital right
now." Shulkin said.
For midwife Roberta Gottlieb of Milford.
Conn., the loss of pager service forced her to stay
at home. "I'm the kind of person that when I'm on
call I usually go out and do things." she said. "It's
a bit of a drag."
Kristina Price, spokeswoman for the Elk
Grove Village. 111.-based company, said United
gets a lot of weather information from the satellite.
The situation was resolved early Wednesday.
At the Southwest Transplant Alliance in Dal
las. which matches patients with organs,
spokeswoman Pam Silvestri said workers were
terrified that a patient might miss a call that an
organ was available. "Last night I was freaking."
she said. "This is life and death."
Even pager-dependent drug dealers were
scrambling to find a safe way to communicate.
" That's about the only positive thing I can think of
so far that's come out of this." said Los Angeles
police I t. Anthony Alba.
