# Jackson bill receives $20 face lift
## 
### 
< WASHINGTON (AP) — A
new $20 bill is coming with high
tech features designed to trip up
pomputer-savvy counterfeiters. Hut
the change people will notice first is
the larger and slightly off-center
portrait of Andrew Jackson.
• The new portrait, like the old. is
based on a drawing from about
.1820. But it's a close-up and shows
'the nation's seventh president with
darker hair than the earlier version.
The view on the back depicts the
White House from the north rather
than from the south.
; Most of the changes are more
than cosmetic. They're aimed at
bogus bill makers armed with
increasingly sophisticated color
copiers, computer scanners, color
ink jet printers and publishing
grade software.
"As we ... raise the hurdle even
higher for criminals, we ensure that
tuir currency remains respected and
trusted around the globe." said
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
who unveiled the new design yester
day with Federal Reserve Chair
man Alan Greenspan.
The features include:
• A watermark to the right of the

portrait and in its shape, only small
er. visible when the bill is held up to
light.
• An embedded polymer securi
ty thread to the far left of the pur
trait. "USA TWENTY" and a Hag
are printed on the thread. When
exposed to ultraviolet light, the
thread glows green.
• A numeral on the lower right
corner of the front printed in color
shitting ink that looks green when
viewed straight on and black when
viewed from an angle.
• Very fine lines around Jack
son's portrait and the picture of the
White House. When duplicated on
a copier, the lines come out in a
wavy moire pattern.
•The words "United States of
America"in microprinting visible
with a magnifying glass along the
lower left rim of Jackson's portrait
and microprinted "USA" within the
numeral 20 in the lower left.
The bills shouldn't seem that dif
ferent from the notes already in
Americans' wallets. The same cot
ton linen paper is used and the
same colors.
"It is the same easily recogniz
able 'greenback' known around the

world." Rubin said at a ceremony at
the Bureau of Engraving and Print
ing.
The new notes will begin circu
lating in the fall. Old $20s will be
recirculated until they wear out. on
average in about two years I hose
notes will be legal tender indefinite
ly.
" The United States has always
honored its currency at its full face

value, no matter how old."
Greenspan said.
I he government began redesign
ing I S folding money with the
introduction of a $I(X) note with
Benjamin J ranklin in March
and the $><) hill with Ulysses S.
(irant last (Vtoher.
Simultaneous issues of new $i()
and $5 notes and a "more modestly
redesigned" $1 note are planned.
