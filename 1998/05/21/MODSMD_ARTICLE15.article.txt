WASHINGTON (AP) —The House voted overwhelmingly yes

dent Clinton's approval of such an export earlier this year was "not in

policy as part of a $270 billion defense spending bill.

Blair pledges to enforce peace accord
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — Determined to win over
wavering Protestant voters. British Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged
yesterday to enforce the most contentious aspects of Northern Ire
land's peace accord.
Blair's unusual gesture, a handwritten "Pledge to the people of
Northern Ireland" to be distributed throughout the province, came on
his third and final visit to garner "yes" votes for tomorrow's referen
dum on the April 10 accord. The north's substantial Catholic minori
ty generally supports the accord, which would create a new multipar
ty government for British-ruled Northern Ireland. But pro-British
Protestants appear evenly split.
Many reject the deal because it would allow Irish Republican
Army prisoners to be freed b\ mid-20(X) and give the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party a place in the new Belfast administration. Acknowledging
these fears. Blair pledged in his document: "Those who use or threat
en violence (will be) excluded from the government of Northern Ire
land. Prisoners (will be) kept in unless violence is given up for good."
Surpeme Court probes Israel's use of torture
JFRI SAL! M (AP) — In an unprecedented examination of secu
rity forces' use of torture, a government lawyer told the Supreme
Court yesterday that Israel was at war with Palestinian militants and

cy. cannot sanction such practices as tying up Palestinian detainees in
painful, contorted positions, shaking them violently and depriving
them of sleep for prolonged periods.
In the opening hearing yesterday, the panel of nine justices hinted
it might not render a decision at all but instead pass the question to the
legislature. Parliament is expected to debate a bill later this year that
would regulate activities by Shin Bet. Israel's security service.
State attorney Shai Nitzan was grilled by judges during his four
hour presentation, especially after he contended that physical pres
sure was often the only way to pry information from suspects.

preventing terror attacks, which have killed dozens of Israelis in the
past four years.
