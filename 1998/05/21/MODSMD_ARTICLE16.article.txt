Treat graduate students
as adults in University
housing policies

THE UNIVERSITY needs to
fundamentally change the way
it approaches the graduate
housing crisis. The policies applied to
graduate students repeatedly show the
University's insistence on treating
ithem like undergraduates when, in
;tact, graduate students have a relation
ship to the I niversity more accurately
!resembling that of employer and
employee.
It is time for the University to treat
I graduate students accordingly and
J respond to the graduate housing crisis
!with respect for the needs of a com
|munitv it relies on for academic inno
vation, research, teaching and patents.
; Many had full careers and families
! before entering graduate school. Ihe
• University disrespects this fact when it
.limits the number of unfurnished
J apartments available, prohibits pets
' and enforces rigid moving dates. It also
• shows disrespect when it manipulates
• numbers to present the housing crisis
; in a softer light.
! While the University can't control
! the rising cost of housing in the area, it
• certainly has direct influence over its
; own policies. The University policy of
'"stuffing." or reconfiguring units to
'house more students in a given space,

is another example of unfriendly grad
uate student policy.
In the recent report issued by the
ASSU, the Graduate Student Council
and the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee, detailed recommenda
tions were made to the University that
should be seriously considered and fol
lowed as soon as possible.
Among other things, the University
should build more housing, purchase
off-campus housing as a short-term
solution, increase graduate stipends in
a manner commensurate to the rising
real estate values in the area, "unstuff"
graduate student housing and reinstate
the graduate resident assistant pro
gram.
Only then can the University begin
to build a solid base of satisfied gradu
ate students who can enjoy a decent
standard of living. Only then will
"trolling for protein" — scavenging
University events for free food —
become unnecessary.
Graduate students are undoubtedly
an integral part of the Stanford com
munity. They shouldn't have to live out
of their cars or share small, single
dorm rooms like undergraduates.
Stanford's housing difficulties have
and will continue to deter top prospec
tive graduate students from choosing
Stanford. This is a sacrifice that neither
the administration nor the students
want to make. If Stanford is the world
class institution it claims to be, the cal
iber of its treatment of graduate stu
dents should fit accordingly.
