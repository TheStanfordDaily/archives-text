Last weekend
I met with my high
school English
teacher, who had been
chosen by one of my for
mer classmates to receive
an award here at Stanford.
Among other things, she

had taught us how to spot
sexual innuendo in Shakespeare and how to
do the Highland Fling. It's nice to know that
some things never change — she's the same
acerbic, proud Scotswoman as she's always
been, and I'm sure that if she were reading
this she'd be correcting my grammar.
It's difficult to describe what makes a
good teacher. You would think that since
you've observed teachers nearly all your
life, you would know what a good teacher is
like. After all, you've seen a pretty good
range from the psychotic to the inspiring to
the just plain boring. Still, the definition
remains elusive.
High school teachers were easy to char
acterize because for us. many of them were
caricatures. The strict disciplinarian, the
pushover for sob stories, the one who cried
when the class wouldn't quiet down, the one
who hadn't recovered from his last acid trip
25 years ago.
College professors, however, are more
difficult to describe. Some professors are
terrific when you're sitting at the back of
the lecture hall, but they fall apart in semi
nars. Others lead deadly dull seminars, but

come alive when you talk to them about the
esoteric subject they've been researching
for the past five years.
Professors are also tough to get to know.
1 don't deny that some students form close
bonds with their professors, and continue to
keep in touch with them years after gradua
tion. I know people who spill their personal
lives to their professors, turning office hours
into therapy sessions. I also know people
who do that so they can ask for that all
important letter of recommendation two
years down the line.
Granted, professors are not here to form
one-on-one relationships with students.
They've got more important things on their
minds, such as contributing to their field or
earning tenure at a cutthroat university.
Many indistinguishable students sleep
through their classes and skip their sections
every year. Students likewise have 10 mil
lion things going on in their lives that make
getting to know a professor low on their pri
ority lists. I am definitely among the major
ity of students who don't go to office hours
unless it is necessary. It just takes too much
effort.
And that is too bad. since Stanford is
supposed to have an incredible faculty. But
just because they're great scholars doesn't
mean that they're great teachers, or that
you can have positive and meaningful inter
actions with them.
The only professor I have had at Stan
ford that I know I will keep in touch with no

longer teaches here. She was not the profes
sor of one of my most important classes,
and she didn't have a list of credentials a
mile long. She taught my fiction writing
class, but I enjoyed the class not because of
what 1 learned, but because 1 got to know
her as a person.
For those of us who don't have grad
school looming in our futures, this may be
the last time we will find ourselves in a for
mal teacher-student relationship. Aside
from the occasional trip to traffic school, we
are done forever with anything that resem
bles this sort of environment.
But for some of us. myself included, we
will soon find ourselves on the other side as
teachers. We'll have to deal with the fact
that even though we once were students, we
might not know how to relate to them.
If you are a graduating senior, you know
about the various opportunities to recog
nize professors by nominating them for
awards. Another way to recogni/e that par
ticularly good teacher you've had, whether
it was your kindergarten teacher or your
CIV section leader, is to use what they've
taught you. The best teachers you've had. I
think you'll realize, are always the ones you
got to know as individuals.
