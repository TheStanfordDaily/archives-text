A recent survey of graduate students re
veals a widespread feeling that the current
graduate housing crisis may negatively af-

fect prospective stu
dents' decisions on
whether to attend Stan
ford.
The findings
come in a report on
graduate housing by the
ASSU Task Force on
Graduate Housing and
the Ciraduate Student

Council, which indicated that the housing
problems faced by graduate students have
led many of them to recommend against at
tending Stanford to prospective students.
The University, however, has begun to ad
dress these problems.
In the housing survey conducted by the
ASSU and the council, graduate students
commented that many departments have
been unable to attract their top choices and
had to reopen admissions.
One respondent to the survey said. "I

have personally told several prospective
graduate students the depressing housing
situation here, and some of them seemed re
ally concerned enough to make housing a
negative factor weighing heavily against
coming to Stanford."
Students point to the rapid rise in housing

costs around the area and the lack of on
campus housing as a cause of the admissions
decisions. The report says that the housing
problems signal that the University doesn't
care enough ahout its graduate students.
