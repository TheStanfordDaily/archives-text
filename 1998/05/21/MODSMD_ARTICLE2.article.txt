# Graduate students see effects on yield rates

### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
A recent survey of graduate students re
veals a widespread feeling that the current
graduate housing crisis may negatively af-

fect prospective stu
dents' decisions on
whether to attend Stan
ford.
The findings
come in a report on
graduate housing by the
ASSU Task Force on
Graduate Housing and
the Ciraduate Student

Council, which indicated that the housing
problems faced by graduate students have
led many of them to recommend against at
tending Stanford to prospective students.
The University, however, has begun to ad
dress these problems.
In the housing survey conducted by the
ASSU and the council, graduate students
commented that many departments have
been unable to attract their top choices and
had to reopen admissions.
One respondent to the survey said. "I

have personally told several prospective
graduate students the depressing housing
situation here, and some of them seemed re
ally concerned enough to make housing a
negative factor weighing heavily against
coming to Stanford."
Students point to the rapid rise in housing

costs around the area and the lack of on
campus housing as a cause of the admissions
decisions. The report says that the housing
problems signal that the University doesn't
care enough ahout its graduate students.

Eighty-three percent of the 2,115 re
spondents felt the University is not
doing enough to address the housing
situation.
However, in response to some of
the concerns raised by the report, the
University has taken action to meet
some of the recommendations made
by graduate students.
At the Faculty Senate Steering
Committee meeting yesterday,
Provost Condoleezza Rice agreed to
contact local faculty and alumni
about renting out rooms to graduate
students. She also made rental listings
at Community Housing Services free
to students. Both issues were short
term solutions recommended in the
report.
"We're glad to get a quick re
sponse on these items." said doctoral
student Stephanie Toering, chair of
the Graduate Housing Advisorv

Committee. We "hope that the ad
ministration will continue to examine
and implement the ideas presented in
the report."
But students' problems may not
be entirely addressed by these new
programs.
One student said that he came to
Stanford because it seemed the grad
uate students were happy and able to
afford to live here. But now, "Stan
ford is not the same grad-student
friendly place it once had a reputation
of being."
Since departments generally rely
on current graduate students in re
cruitment. this has taken a toll on get
ting new students. One student said
that he now "thinks twice about rec
ommending [Stanford] to prospec
tive grad students."
Prospective students also seem to
be increasingly worried about the
cost of living at Stanford.
"Last year we had to prompt
prospectives to think about housing
costs. This vear, they needed no

prompting; all 22 interviewees were
very concerned about this," one stu
dent said.
Another respondent said that
only three students will be attending
Stanford out of the 12 accepted by his
department this year. The acceptance
rate in the past has been at least 50
percent.
Administrators from individual
departments agreed that housing is a
concern of prospective students.
Representatives of the admissions of
fices at both the Graduate School of
Business and the School of Medicine
said that prospective students have
asked about housing issues.
"They're pretty aware of it," said
the Business School representative.
"It's a deterrent." However, both
said they're not aware of housing
being a factor in the students' deci
sions.
"No one's making a decision
based on that," said the representa
tive from the medical school.
Housing was more of an issue

within some of the other departments
on campus. Biology Prof. Liqun Luo,
a member of the admissions commit
tee of his department, said that all
three students he hosted asked about
the housing issue.
He also said that admissions at the
Biology Department has been down
the last two years but did not know
exactly how much a role the housing
issue plays.
Physics doctoral student Robert
Rudnitsky, a member of the Gradu
ate Student Council, thinks that hous
ing is affecting admissions. He said
that departments often rank their
choices and that even though yield
rates may have stayed the same, de
partments are now getting less of
their top choices. However, none of
the departments had any concrete
data that housing issues are affecting
admissions rates.
The housing problems and the
high cost of living may even be forc
ing some current students to leave
Stanford.

" This year I have been seriously
considering the possibility of being
forced to drop out of the Ph.D. pro
gram in the all too likely event of
being unable to find affordable hous
ing," lamented one student.
Another filth-year doctoral stu
dent said he will probably drop out of
his Ph.D. program because he can't
afford housing in the area.
The report also said that lack of
support from the University in the
housing problem will affect alumni
fund raising in the future.
This will especially hurt the indi
vidual departments who receive the
majority of graduate alumni dona
tions.
One respondent put it very blunt
ly. "I don't think there's any question
that after being treated (and particu
larly) housed the way we are during
our years here, most of us are just
happy to get out of here and not par
ticularly likely to want to give money
after the way it was sucked out of us
while we were here."
