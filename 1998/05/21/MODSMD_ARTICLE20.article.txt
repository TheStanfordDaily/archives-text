An improred decision
making process needed
With the recent elimination of funding
for graduate resident assistants. I am once
again amazed by the fact that, regarding
graduate housing, some very prominent
administrators just don't understand the
situation here.
As some graduate students are ratchet
ing themselves into debt because of the
housing crunch and contemplating drop
ping out. others face the prospect of being
crammed into an Escondido Village dou
ble with two other people.
The decision and the decision-making
process in this case add insult to injury.
At the same time that some of his col
leagues are preaching about "trying in sig
nificant ways to enhance the quality of
graduate student life." Vice Provost for
Student Affairs James Montoya and his
staff felt it completely appropriate to
make the decision to eliminate graduate
RAs.
In doing so. they knocked out. without
student input, one of the only non-depart
mental support structures here for gradu
ate students.
The amount of money involved is
$80,000. That's less than $2 per month for
• each graduate student living on campus.
That's less than four hundredths of one
percent of the monev lliat Housing and

Dining Services will take in this year from
graduates alone. That's 6 percent of the
additional revenue Housing and Dining
Services will take in for cramming more
graduate students into existing housing,
according to the Graduate .Student Coun
cil / ASSU graduate housing report.
That's salary plus overhead on one
mid-level administrator. Was that cut real
ly necessary to fulfill the stated priority of
keeping on-campus housing costs down,
or is $80,000 absolutely negligible com
pared to other parts of the Housing and
Dining Services budget?
Was this the smartest way to cut the
budget? Well, it was certainly an easy way
to do so. Sure, this eliminates some mea
ger additional income for 50 to 60 strug
gling graduate students, and affects 3,000
others, but so what.
The administration is well aware that
they will have no problems finding "vol
unteers" to be "Community Associates,"
since the off-campus housing situation is
so bad that people will be willing to say
yes to extra work as long as they get on
campus housing. And what are graduate
students going to do — move off campus
in protest?
It's been one year since the Committee
on Academics Research and Evaluation
committee's report came out. in which we
specifically said:
"The University administration and
departments frequently make decisions
which affect large numbers of graduate

students; yet. the University spends a vast
ly smaller fraction of its information-gath
ering resources on determining the status
of. and then impact of such changes on,
the graduate community."
Nice to see that we had such a pro
found impact.
Look. I know there's no quick fix to the
housing situation, and I know that there
are people working hard to ameliorate the
crunch, but would it be so hard to have a
better decision-making process here?

Administration's numbers
underestimate demand
We were shocked to see University
Rudget Director Tim Warner and Assoc.
Student Housing Director Rodger Whit
ney assert that 400 new spaces in graduate
housing will meet the demand.
Last year's housing lottery, which
denied K(X) students on-campus housing,
clearly shows their number underesti
mates demand by a factor of two.
In addition, the results of the recent
ASSU Task Force on Graduate Housing
survey strongly suggest even this larger
number understates the true demand.
This is because an additional 23 percent
of off-campus students would apply if they
thought they had a chance in the lottery or

if they thought they would not he kicked
off campus again in a year.
The Task Force on Graduate Housing
is asking for 1.000 new spaces to be built.
Looking at the numbers from last year's
lottery and the survey, this number is eas
ily justified. The administration argues
that "true" demand should be measured
by how many people are willing to live
anywhere on campus.
This number only tells you how many
desperate graduate students who are will
ing to live in a living room; to say a gradu
ate student doesn't really want on-campus
housing because they are unwilling to live
in a living room is absurd.

Camarillo missed the boat
I am frankly shocked at Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo's
comment in Tuesday's Daily. Nkomo
Morris quotes Camarillo. "We need
response from the larger community in
order to make changes in housing. One of
our large problems is that when wc ask for
input, no one comes."
This comment, coming as it does a

month or so alter enraged students went
so far as to stage a rally in White Plaza to
try to gain Camarillo's attention, is, to say
the least, disingenuous.
Shame on you. Jane, for attempting to
blame students for the poor performance
of your office.
I spent two or three hours in your
office myself giving you volumes of
"input" that was summarily ignored, pri
marily on the issues of privacy for student
grades and respect for student autonomy.
The truth is that Res Ed makes the deci
sions which are convenient and beneficial
for Res Ed.
Living in Stanford dorms is a humiliat
ing. demeaning experience because of the
paternal, patronizing tone of Res Ed.
I'm indicating on a student survey I just
received that I would NOT recommend
attending Stanford to anyone, and I'd
think Jane could guess whom I'd blame
for that.
