## So how do you like Stanford? Which Stanford? 
###

Some questions don't deserve an
answer. Or at least they don't deserve a
straight answer.
Take college applications. You were sup
posed to write about an event that changed
your life for Yale, a very important person
for Columbia and a small object that meant a
lot to you for Stanford.
Somehow you managed to send basically
the same essay to everyone, right? About the
midget who changed your life?
ITiere's no shame in this. Many questions
that people ask you are stupid or pointless.
But often you have to answer them anyway.
What are you supposed to do at a job
interview when a complete stranger asks you,
"What would you say your biggest weakness
is?"
All of us pre-professional types know
exactly what to do. We rattle off a scripted
answer, in which the "weakness" ends up
being a "strength" — like "I get really
involved in my work to the detriment of my
personal life." You're hired!
Usually, even when we aren't consciously

aware of it, we have a few scripted answers
tucked away in our heads — answers to the
frequently asked questions of our lives. All
freshmen have "Do you know what you're
going to major in?" on their FAQ list. Even
if they don't know, they can tell you why they
don't know and when they expect to have it
all figured out.
It is always frustrating to he asked one of
these obvious questions and not be able to
provide a quick, coherent answer. This
always happens to me when I'm asked a
question that almost everyone reading this
column, whether Stanford student or staff,
has been asked approximately a million
times: "So how do you like Stanford?"
If I wanted to answer the question with a
scripted response, I suppose I could use some
of the six words that Director of University
Communications Terry Shepard came up
with a couple of years ago in his "Strategic
Communications Plan" for Stanford.
The idea was that Stanford faculty and
staff could use the words in their external
communications in order to brush up the

University's image. Stanford, they could say,
is "incomparable, challenging, pioneering/
Western, vibrant, boundless, and stunning."
We 11... maybe on a gtxxl day.
If I try to tell people what 1 think of Stan
ford without Mr. Shepard's help, though, I
get in trouble. Whether or not I like Stanford
depends on which Stanford I'm thinking
about.
Is it the Stanford that is obsessed with
public relations and looking good, even
when that means suppressing discussion
about its future?
Or is it the professors, staff and students
who think that open and rigorous debate
about this university is vital to its long-term
health?
Is it the Stanford with enough resources
and financial support to build a new Science
and Engineering Quad from scratch?
Or is it the Stanford whose president has
complained about the expense of making
older buildings comply with the Americans
with Disabilities Act?
Is Stanford the humanities departments

that faced enormous and permanent budget
cuts in the early 199()s and somehow managed
to preserve their morale and sense of mission?
Or is it the Housing and Dining Services
that charges some of the highest board rates
in the nation and that, rather than downsiz
ing its unpopular services, might actually
elbow its inefficient way into the Toyon Eat
ing Clubs?
Is it the offbeat and decentralized under
graduate housing of Lamda Nu. EBF. Alpha
Sig and the frats — one that is based on stu
dent creativity and management?
Or is it the "new" synthetic Stanford of
sophomore pride and entrepreneurial spirit
theme dorms created and administered by
Res Ed bureaucrats?
Is it the Stanford that maintains high
quality overseas campuses all over the world
and promotes the value of studying abroad?
Or is it the Stanford that has shed its core
liberal arts curriculum and replaced it with
almost nothing, turning freshman year into
an essentially random experience for an
awful lot of students?

Most of these idle preoccupations of mine
are too difficult to explain to the person
who's asking me whether or not I like Stan
ford. That's why it's a lot easier to answer
people's questions by saying. "Life is gtxxi in
the Bay Area," or "I love my department" —r
two things which are unquestionably true.
Sometimes, though, the questioner is per
sistent, usually because they have a child who
is thinking of coming here. Is Stanford the
right school for their kid? .
'that's a question I have an easier time
answering. If their child wants to major in an
engineering or pre-professional field with the
goal of obtaining rigorous vocational training
along with a great name to put on theif
resume, there's no better place.
But if they want to major in a humanities
field or if they want to be immersed in a col
legiate atmosphere that emphasizes learning
for its own sake.. .well, that's a really good
question.
