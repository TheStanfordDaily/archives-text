Use Jasper Ridge for
research, not recreation
I would like to respond to Tuesday's edi
torial about making Jasper Ridge more
aecessible to the public. 1 agree wholeheart
edly that Jasper Ridge is an invaluable
resource to the Stanford scientific commu
nity. As mentioned in the editorial, there
are some 50 ongoing research projects at
Jasper Ridge, and the area has previously
spawned nearly 2()0 theses. In addition,
some very important ecological theory has
been based on observations and work done
at the preserve.
I encourage anyone who is interested in
this kind of cutting-edge research and
exploration to make use of one of the many
ways to involve themselves with Jasper

Ridge. You can arrange for a docent-led
tour or take one of over ?5 Stanford cours
es that use the preserve. This way you can
have a chance to see the place for yourself
while learning something about its unique
ness in the process. You can apply to con
duct your own research, join existing
research groups or enter the docent pro
gram. In addition, you can apply to be a
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve ranger
and ensure that the preserve is being used
for its intended purpose â€” research and
education.
People must remember that Jasper
Ridge is not Stanford's private park for the
enjoyment of a privileged few. The purpose
of Jasper Ridge is for research and educa
tion, and as a requirement for holding to
this purpose, the land must be managed to
minimize human impact.
The editorial states that the main reason

for not granting public access is that
research plots will be disturbed. This is true,
but it is not the whole story. There is an end
less list of problems associated with public
use of "protected" lands. For example,
exceedingly high rates of erosion occur
along heavily used hiking trails. Similarly,
people coming in and disturbing an area (an
inevitable side effect of human use) dramat
ically increases the risk of biological inva
sion by harmful species. This is already a
serious problem at Jasper Ridge.
The greatest source of scientific value
that Jasper Ridge has to offer is the oppor
tunity to discover the unknown, and this can
only be done in an area preserved for future
study and free from external pressures.
Jasper Ridge serves many functions in the
Stanford community, but providing a place
for nostalgic strolls along the lake at the
expense of future research is not one of

them. Every effort needs to be made to
attract as many students as possible to
Jasper Ridge, but opening the doors to the
general public once a quarter will cause
more damage than good.

Rooms weren't designed
for double occupancy
Cramming extra occupants into existing
floorplans is not the solution to the graduate
student housing problem. According to
Assoc. Student Housing Director Rodger
Whitney in yesterday's Daily, the Universi
ty will restore rooms back to their "original
configurations" next vear.

While that statement may be accurate
for the rooms in Crothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial Hall, it certainly can't refer to the
one-bedroom apartments in Escondido Vil
lage that will be converted into double
occupancy apartments.
I refuse to believe that the so-called orig
inal configuration of these apartments is to
shoehorn two people into living space with
only one bedroom.
If these apartments were supposed tc
have two people in them, they would have
two bedrooms and not require one occu
pant to sleep in the living room.
T he decision to accommodate more stu
dents bv eliminating one-bedroom single
occupancy floorplans is discriminator}
toward the graduate students who choose to
live alone and want to live on campus.
