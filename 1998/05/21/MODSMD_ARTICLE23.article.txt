matches to dash any Tennessee

hopes for an upset. Stanford sopho
more Anne Kremer. currently the
No. 8 singles player nationally, con
tained Malhotra with a 6-2, 6-1
straight-set win. Three other Cardi
nal players notched wins in straight
sets.
The Volunteers got their only
point of the day in the No. 1 dou
bles match, in which Malhotra and
Lepsi defeated Kremer and sopho
more Teryn Ashley 8-2.
While Tennessee is coming off
three wins in its regional last week
end. the Cardinal has not played a
dual match since a 5-4 win over
I ( 1 A on April IS.
Stanford did finish the season
in strong fashion, however, win
ning five straight matches and
wrapping up its 11th consecutive
Pacific 10 Conference team cham
pionship.
The individual Cardinal players
continued their impressive play at
the Pac-1() Championships at the

end of April, when seniors Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott captured
yet another doubles title. In the sin
gles draw, Ashley reached the fi
nals before losing, and Bles/ynski
strung together some big wins to
reach the semifinals.

players ranked in the top 51 nation
ally: No. 7 Scott. No. X Kremer. No.
17 Ashley and No. 51 Bles/ynski.

singles and doubles players for the
Vols are ranked.

season at 8-6. good for sixth place
