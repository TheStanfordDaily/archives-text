In his three years of college baseball, junior Jeff
Austin has never faced Loyola Marymount. But the
Lions are not exactly foreign to Stanford's ace.

■ Today: No. 2 Stanford (41-12-1) opens NCAA West
Regional play vs. Loyola Marymount (33-21-1), 7:30 p.tn
Sunken Diamond.

"1 see their big letters on the side of the mountain...
every time we're down in LA to play I 'SC or UCLA."
he said. "We must have driven by it about 50 times, bul
I have yet to face them."
There's a first time for everything.
Tonight, Austin and the Cardinal (41-12-1) face the
sixth-seeded West Coast Conference champion Lions
in the first game of the NCAA West Regional at
Sunken Diamond.
"1 can't see a tougher regional than this one," said
Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess. "I think the
sixth-seed team last year was nowhere near as strong as
this year's. [LMU is] a really good offensive team. They
kind of scare you because they're a little unpredictable.
If they get hot with the bat, they can scare you."
While the Lions may be coming to Sunken Diamond
tonight with fiery bats, winning eight of their last 10.
top-seeded Stanford can not claim the same.
The past week has not been the best of times for the

now-No. 2 Cardinal. Alter losing its past four games.
Stanford realizes that the second season starts tonight
and a loss takes on an entirely different meaning.
"You don't like to go into regionals losing four
games in a row," Austin said. "I think we have realized
there is a sense of urgency now. We need to get hack on
the right track."
Because of the double-elimination format at the re
gionals. "it's a tough road if you lose [now]," he said.

Despite being derailed in its past four games, Stan
ford does not seem overly concerned with its first los
ing streak of the season.
"When we were winning every series this year, [our
mentality] was to just go out and do our business, said
junior pitcher Chad Hutchinson, who will start in the
Cardinal's second postseason game on Friday. "Noth

ing has changed. We've never lost
confidence."
The only thing that might have
changed is that at one time Mar
quess might have viewed the first
regional game as time to experi
ment with pitching and not use
Austin for too many innings. Now,
theCardinal is thinking twice.
"You take a big risk trying to do
that with this field," Marquess said.
"You can outsmart yourself. 1 wish
it were like football and basketball,
where you could take your guys out
and substitute them back in. This is
a really strong field."
While the Cardinal will be
throwing the veteran Austin (12-3)

at 7 p.m., the young Lions will be
placing their faith in freshman
pitcher Michael Schultz (tf-2).
"He's earned it," said LMU
head coach Frank Cruz. "For about
an hour, 1 thought about going with
someone else, and then 1 just said,
'Let's go with our best.' To get this
experience would be big for him."
In fact, gaining experience
seems to be one of Cruz's main ob
jectives heading into tonight's
game. In their first NCAA Region
al in eight years, Cruz and the
Lions are looking to build to the fu
ture.
"It's exciting for our guys," Cruz
said. "Here we are against the best
in the country. [We've got] a bunch
of fighters. Every tight game these
youngsters get into is going to help
us. Down the road, I am sure it will

pay off for us."
Austin, however, seems more
concerned about the present.
"They're probably the toughest
sixth-seed in the nation," he said.
In his second year at the helm of
the Lions, Cruz sees the berth into
the regionals as a reward for hard
work and doesn't plan to let his
players overlook that.
"1 told [my guys] that I'd try and
relax in the dugout and have some
fun as a reward for them working so
hard," he said.
The matchup, will be the third
game of the day at Sunken Dia
mond, following an 11 a.m. game
between Long Beach State and
North Carolina State and a 3 p.m.
game between the second-seeded
Alabama Crimson Tide and Min
nesota.
