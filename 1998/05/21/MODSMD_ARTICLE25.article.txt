# Bright future for Austin
## Pitcher reveals it's his mom who steers the ship 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
Even if Jeff Austin didn't know it. his fu
ture was decided long ago.
In fact, it was determined at a routine base
ball game in Houston during his sophomore
year in high school ... from his mother's
point of view, at least.
"My mom was sitting back [in the stands),
and I was throwing all right, pretty hard or
whatever," Austin said. "But a couple of ju
nior college coaches turn to my mom and say.
Where's he going to school? What's he going
to do?' And my mom was like. 'Oh. he's going
to Stanford."
"First of all." Austin emphasized, "1 had
never even heard of Stanford until my junior
year in high school. And there was no way
they had contacted me. so I guess it was al
ways my mom's dream that 1 go to Stanford."
When he was accepted, his mother's re
sponse confirmed her plan.
"She was ecstatic," Austin said. "1 remem
ber when 1 got the phone call from |tlnrd base
coach Dean Stotz], I kind of nodded to her
like I got in.and she was jumping up and
down and clapping. She was really happy.'
The Cardinal junior ace and top collegiate
prospect for the June IWH Amateur Baseball
Draft now laughs about the incident.
But with a 12-3 record, a luminous 2.W
ERA and a fastball that has blown past qnak
ing hitters with more fury than a tempest, his
mother's foresight has definitely proven ben

eficial to the Cardinal.
The accolades don't stop there for the
Texan, who consistently overpowers his op
ponents on the mound Recently selected as
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division
Co-Pitcher of the Year — an honor he shares
with I JSC ace Seth Etherton Austin is also
one of three finalists for the Rotary Smith Na
tional Player of the Year Award. [See note

Austin, dubbed "the Cardinal work
horse." was N-2 with a 2.73 ERA in league
contests and has thrown eight complete
games in 17 matchups. The right-hander has
also gone the distance in six of his last eight
outings.
He has tallied 310 career strikeouts, mak
ing him fifth on Stanford's all-time list. And
he was named Collegiate Baseball National
Player of the Week on April b after throwing
a complete game six-hit shutout at then-No. 2
IJSC.
But although there have been enough
speed guns in Sunken Diamond stands to
monitor traffic on Highway 101. Austin re
mains as calm and level as the Texas prairie.
"The more pressure there is. the better I
seem to do." Austin said. "I really think 1
seem to thrive on that, especially coming out
of the bullpen. You come into the game in
such a tight situation —you're either the hero
or the goat. I kind of like that."

Kwest Leggett — Daily file
Junior hurler Jeff Austin, the No. 1 prospect in June s 1998 Amateur
Baseball Draft, admits he probably won't be playing baseball on the
Farm next year. His last performance in a Cardinal uniform will most
likely be in Omaha, Neb., at this year's College World Series in June
if the team can survive this weekend's Regional tournament at
Sunken Diamond.
the Cardinal at the College World
Series in several clutch situations.
The right-hander worked a total
of 10.1 scoreless innings, allowing
eight hits. He struck out five and al
lowed two hits over four scoreless
innings to pick up the save in an 8-
3 wjn over Auburn on May 30.
Later. Austin earned the win in
an 11-4 victory against the Tigers

after throwing 6.1 shutout innings.
A Texas-sized slab of fame de
scended soon after.
Heralded as the only Stanford
player to be named to the College
World Series All-Tournament
Team. Austin next went 4-1 with a
3.63 ERA as Team USA's top
starter.
But despite his love and grati
tude for the Stanford community
and his team, Austin realizes he'll
likely move on when the draft
comes around in June.

"I'm going to focus on the task
at hand and try to be the best base
ball player I can be for the next five
years, at least," Austin said.
"And if, after five years, I'm not
where I need to be, then I'll hang
them up and see if I can't find
something else to do."
And with herds of scouts assess
ing every outing and major league
opportunities extended hot on
their heels, Austin might do best to
seek the advice of his mother.
It worked before.
