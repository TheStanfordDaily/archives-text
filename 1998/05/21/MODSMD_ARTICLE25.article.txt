Even if Jeff Austin didn't know it. his fu
ture was decided long ago.
In fact, it was determined at a routine base
ball game in Houston during his sophomore
year in high school ... from his mother's
point of view, at least.
"My mom was sitting back [in the stands),
and I was throwing all right, pretty hard or
whatever," Austin said. "But a couple of ju
nior college coaches turn to my mom and say.
Where's he going to school? What's he going
to do?' And my mom was like. 'Oh. he's going
to Stanford."
"First of all." Austin emphasized, "1 had
never even heard of Stanford until my junior
year in high school. And there was no way
they had contacted me. so I guess it was al
ways my mom's dream that 1 go to Stanford."
When he was accepted, his mother's re
sponse confirmed her plan.
"She was ecstatic," Austin said. "1 remem
ber when 1 got the phone call from |tlnrd base
coach Dean Stotz], I kind of nodded to her
like I got in.and she was jumping up and
down and clapping. She was really happy.'
The Cardinal junior ace and top collegiate
prospect for the June IWH Amateur Baseball
Draft now laughs about the incident.

mother's foresight has definitely proven ben

eficial to the Cardinal.
The accolades don't stop there for the

Co-Pitcher of the Year — an honor he shares

Austin, dubbed "the Cardinal work
horse." was N-2 with a 2.73 ERA in league
contests and has thrown eight complete
games in 17 matchups. The right-hander has
also gone the distance in six of his last eight
outings.
He has tallied 310 career strikeouts, mak
ing him fifth on Stanford's all-time list. And
he was named Collegiate Baseball National
Player of the Week on April b after throwing
a complete game six-hit shutout at then-No. 2
IJSC.
But although there have been enough
speed guns in Sunken Diamond stands to
monitor traffic on Highway 101. Austin re
mains as calm and level as the Texas prairie.
"The more pressure there is. the better I
seem to do." Austin said. "I really think 1
seem to thrive on that, especially coming out
of the bullpen. You come into the game in
such a tight situation —you're either the hero
or the goat. I kind of like that."

Junior hurler Jeff Austin, the No. 1 prospect in June s 1998 Amateur
Baseball Draft, admits he probably won't be playing baseball on the
Farm next year. His last performance in a Cardinal uniform will most
likely be in Omaha, Neb., at this year's College World Series in June

Sunken Diamond.
