# Softball's postseason unique
## Nothing like the first time 
### 
There can only be one first time. May he that's
what made this year's trip to Stillwatjet,
Okla.. with the Stanford Softball team 'So
much fun and unlike any other postseason I've <&
perienced while working for The Daily.
Ir wasn't my first trip to the postseason I'ye
been to the Final Four with women's basketball ;tiQ< I
even covered a national championship women's
volleyball team.
But it was a first for softball. There's something
special about being with an entire team that's
experienced the thrill of the postseason before. *»'
There's an excitement, almost a glow, around rtii
whole group, and you know that no matter how tltj \
finish, just being there is an experience that won't N
forgotten. Hut you also reali/e its an experience
that won't be duplicated.

Next year, when the soltball team heads into the
postseason, only the freshmen on the squad will he
wide-eyed and anxious. The rest have been there.
That's not to say it's a bad thing. In fact, it's ex
actlv the opposite. The goal of any program is to be
competitive even year, and with the improvement
the softball team has seen in recent years, confer
ence championships, the Softball College W orld Sc
ries and even the ultimate sports prize of a national
championship probably aren't very far off
In a few seasons, the softball team will probably
expect things like 5l>-win seasons, hosting a regional
or competing with a powerhouse like Arizona. 1 he\
will all be a mark of continued improvement and
success. But those things only make the 1WS season
all the more special for those who experienced it.
Even year the C ardinal has seemed to build on
the successes of the season before, but this season
was different because it was the year all those in
provementsculminated into the kind of success that
earns accolades, recognition and respect.
This year. Stanford posted its best record evet
and finished third in the perennially strong Pacific
10 Conference. The Card broke into the top 25 for
the lirst time ever and proceeded to climb all the
was to No. M by the end of the regular season.
Stanford swept Washington and UCLA for the
first time ever, and Arizona was the only Pac-tO
team to take an entire series from the Card. Stan
ford and Washington both swept at home, giving tin
two teams a tie in that series, and the Cardinal unjk
three out of four games from the other Pac-»r0
schools.
Individually, the Cardinal had a banner year *is
well. Junior Marcy Crouch tied the record for clou
bles in a season (13). while fellow junior Miehcle
Aeosta tied Crouch's mark set last year for home
runs m a single season (three). Aeosta and Crouch
both topped the record for RBIs in one year with v
and 34. respectively.
Junior Michelle Schneider tied the record lor
stolen bases and beat the record for walks in a sea
son. Junior pitcher Becky Blevins bested her old
record for strikeouts in a season with 162. recording
her 4(Wth career strikeout to put her at the top of the
