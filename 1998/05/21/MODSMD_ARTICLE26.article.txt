# Softball's postseason unique
## Nothing like the first time 
### 
There can only be one first time. May he that's
what made this year's trip to Stillwatjet,
Okla.. with the Stanford Softball team 'So
much fun and unlike any other postseason I've <&
perienced while working for The Daily.
Ir wasn't my first trip to the postseason I'ye
been to the Final Four with women's basketball ;tiQ< I
even covered a national championship women's
volleyball team.
But it was a first for softball. There's something
special about being with an entire team that's
experienced the thrill of the postseason before. *»'
There's an excitement, almost a glow, around rtii
whole group, and you know that no matter how tltj \
finish, just being there is an experience that won't N
forgotten. Hut you also reali/e its an experience
that won't be duplicated.
\

Next year, when the soltball team heads into the
postseason, only the freshmen on the squad will he
wide-eyed and anxious. The rest have been there.
That's not to say it's a bad thing. In fact, it's ex
actlv the opposite. The goal of any program is to be
competitive even year, and with the improvement
the softball team has seen in recent years, confer
ence championships, the Softball College W orld Sc
ries and even the ultimate sports prize of a national
championship probably aren't very far off
In a few seasons, the softball team will probably
expect things like 5l>-win seasons, hosting a regional
or competing with a powerhouse like Arizona. 1 he\
will all be a mark of continued improvement and
success. But those things only make the 1WS season
all the more special for those who experienced it.
Even year the C ardinal has seemed to build on
the successes of the season before, but this season
was different because it was the year all those in
provementsculminated into the kind of success that
earns accolades, recognition and respect.
This year. Stanford posted its best record evet
and finished third in the perennially strong Pacific
10 Conference. The Card broke into the top 25 for
the lirst time ever and proceeded to climb all the
was to No. M by the end of the regular season.
Stanford swept Washington and UCLA for the
first time ever, and Arizona was the only Pac-tO
team to take an entire series from the Card. Stan
ford and Washington both swept at home, giving tin
two teams a tie in that series, and the Cardinal unjk
three out of four games from the other Pac-»r0
schools.
Individually, the Cardinal had a banner year *is
well. Junior Marcy Crouch tied the record for clou
bles in a season (13). while fellow junior Miehcle
Aeosta tied Crouch's mark set last year for home
runs m a single season (three). Aeosta and Crouch
both topped the record for RBIs in one year with v
and 34. respectively.
Junior Michelle Schneider tied the record lor
stolen bases and beat the record for walks in a sea
son. Junior pitcher Becky Blevins bested her old
record for strikeouts in a season with 162. recording
her 4(Wth career strikeout to put her at the top of the


Robin
Davidson
career list. Blevins also set a new
mark for wins with 24 this year — al
most matching her previous total of
27 — and topped the single-season
ERA mark with a 1.24.
Blevins and sophomore catcher
Kellie Wiginton earned the school's
first-ever selections to the All Pac-10
first team, and Crouch and Acosta
were named to the second team.
Schneider and junior Jennie Foyle
made honorable mention.
In the postseason, Crouch, Acos
ta, junior Shane Anderson and
freshman Jenni Shideler landed
spots on the All-Region team.
When the regional brackets were
announced May 10, Stanford
claimed one of eight top seeds in the
tournament and headed to its first
ever postseason appearance.
In its first game, the Cardinal fell
to Southwest Missouri State 5-2.
Perhaps a case of jitters — whatever
was wrong, Stanford fixed it and
took two games Saturday to advance
to the regional final.
Unfortunately, the Card fell short
against Oklahoma State. But the
achievement of the program's most
successful year cannot be over
looked. After the season-ending loss
to the Cowgirls, Stanford head coach
John Rittman couldn't hide the
pride he felt for his team.
"It's been a wonderful year," he
said. "I think we exceeded our ex
pectations. Our kids played with a
lot of heart and pride all year.

"To come out here and bounce
back after our loss to Southwest Mis
souri State — these kids never quit,
and they're going to go places."
You can bet he's right about the
team going places. With a core of
this year's team returning next
year. Stanford has nowhere to go
but up.
One of the top five defenses in the
nation remains intact for next sea
son. and a slew of hard-hitting fresh
men recruits should add a little of
fensive power to the lineup.
But no matter what the future
holds for Stanford Softball, the nov
elty and excitement of the 1998 sea
son will never be matched. Sure, the
Softball program will top the success
of this season, and the accomplish

ments that lie ahead may even be
more exciting than this year's.
But they will be different.
There's something about that
first time that can never be repeated.
The novelty and the excitement will
never be exactly the same, and the
years of work it took to get there
won't be appreciated as much.
The 1998 season is unique be
cause it's the end of one era and the
beginning of another. The 16 players
on the team hold a historic place in
the softball program and have
achieved something no other team
here ever will.

Robin Davidson plans to attend next
year's Oregon game to see if the Car
dinal will win the dance contest.
