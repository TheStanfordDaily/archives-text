Women's golf
The Stanford women's golf team didn't play as
well as it hoped in the first round of the NCAA Cham
pionships in Madison, Wise.
The Cardinal suffered one of its worst rounds all
season yesterday, firing a 16-over-par 304 — a score
that leaves the team 27 shots behind Arizona State.
The Sun Devils were able to blitz the links with a
record-tying 277 (-11).
Stanford stands in 18th place in the 19-team field,
only ahead of Oregon.
Sun Devil standout Grace Park is tied for the indi
vidual lead after shooting a course-record-tying 65.
"I hit a lot of good shots and made some good putts
for birdie, but there were still some more that I could
have made," Park said.
Duke's Jenny Chuasiriporn matched Park's open
ing round, leading the Blue Devils to a tie with Flori
da for third place, eight shots back at 285. 'i was real
ly reading the greens well and putting it where I want
ed to put it," Chuasiriporn said. "I just felt really com
fortable out there all day."
The better-than-expected Indiana Hoosiers stand
in second place after firing a 284. Rounding out the
top five are Arizona and North Carolina, tied for fifth
at 290.

On a day in which the University Ridge Golf
Course was in perfect condition and most players felt
a similar comfort level, Stanford simply didn't take
advantage of the par 72,6,033-yard layout.
"The course is in perfect condition, just perfect,"
said Arizona's Heather Graff, who shot a 70.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, yesterday's poor
performance shattered any realistic hopes of a na
tional championship.
Baseball
The Rotary Club of Houston yesterday named
Cardinal junior pitcher Jeff Austin one of three final
ists for the Rotary Smith Award, an honor given an
nually to the best college baseball player.
Austin, who hails from Kingwood, Texas, has nur
tured a 2.98 ERA en route to a 12-3 record as Stan
ford's ace starter. He also was named the top prospect
in the June 1998 Amateur Baseball Draft.
The list of finalists is rounded out by Miami's Pat
Burrell, a junior third baseman whose .873 career
slugging percentage is second all-time in the NCAA,
and Florida junior outfielder and pitcher Brad Wilk
erson, who has put together a .347 batting average
and drawn 77 walks so far this season in between
pitching assignments. On the mound, he has a 9-4
record and 4.23 ERA.
Former finalists for the award include Major Lea
guers Jim Abbot, Robin Ventura and Ben McDonald.
The winner of the award will be announced July 8.
