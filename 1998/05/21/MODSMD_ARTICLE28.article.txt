# Women face wheelchairs
## Hoopsters to try their hand at sit-down basketball 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball team will take
on the Bay Area Meteorites tonight at Maples Pavil
ion in a game sponsored by the Disabled Students of
Stanford.
But this won't be a simple case of the reigning Pa
cific 10 Conference champion Cardinal beating up on
a team of local policemen for a good cause. Instead,
Stanford will face the challenge of adapting to the Me
teorites' game: wheelchair basketball.
The disabled students' group organized a similar
game four years ago.
"We hope to make it an annual event," said group
member Jessica Lehman, a junior.
The Bay Area Meteorites are the only women's
wheelchair basketball team in Northern California.
Currently ranked eighth in the National Women's
Wheelchair Basketball Association, the team prac
tices and plays home games at Mills College in Oak
land.
The Meteorites carry 10 active players ranging
from high school age to 50 years old whose disabilities
range from polio to spinal cord injuries and amputa
tions. The team has two former U.S. Team members
on its roster, including Jennifer Howitt, who played
for the 1998 Gold Cup team, and Kathlyn Black, who
played for 1997's Gold Cup team and was an alternate
for the 1996 Atlanta paralympic team.
"We played [Stanford] four years ago and beat
them," said Meteorite team member Vanessa Siegel.
The rules to wheelchair basketball are almost iden
tical to that of the NCAA, except for dribbling. The
game is played with an NCAA women's ball on a reg
ulation court with a standard 10-foot basket.
Traveling occurs when a player pushes the wheel

more than twicc without bouncing the hall at least
once on the court.
Furthermore, players are ranked according to the
extent of their disability and rated accordingly.
In the United States, the scale of disability runs
from 1 to 3, while international competition uses a
scale of 0.5 to 4.5.
Players with more severe disabilities are rated
lower, and a team can have a maximum of 12 points in
players on the floor at one time.
The greatest differences between wheelchair bas
ketball and the college game lie in the strategy, Siegel
said.
"We do have some players who shcx)t three-point
ers," she said. "We also use what's called a 1-out,
where you corner an offensive player after a rebound
and wait for your teammates to bring the ball upcourt
Then you run upcourt and can play numbers until the
other player catches up."
The positions in wheelchair basketball are also a bit
different.
There is a point guard, typically a player who sits
low in her chair to protect the ball, but the other four
players are broken up into the high and low post. Low
post players typically sit high in their chairs for re
bounds, putbacks and layups.
Such strategies will no doubt be foreign to the C ar
dinal. who will be without this year's graduating se
niors. Junior Kristin Folkl is still recovering from her
torn ACL and will miss the match as well.
However, the Card has been preparing for the
game by practicing in wheelchairs.
"They've been in wheelchairs for a week, so they
should be up and running," Siegel said. "Or. 1 guess
down and rolling."
The game begins at 7 p.m. and will be wheelchai
accessible. Admission is free.
