# Santa Clara County tops state in home prices
## 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
The rate of increase in the price of an av
erage home in Santa Clara County topped
all other California counties, according to a
new survey conducted by the California As
sociation of Realtors. This news comes in
the midst of debate over the availability of
off-campus student housing at Stanford.
According to Kathleen Bransfield, man
ager of Housing Assignment Services,
more graduate students are entering the
graduate housing lottery as higher home
prices translate into higher rents for living
oft campus.
"We had a big increase in the number of
students in the [graduate] Draw last year.

and we continue to anticipate the entry of
more students." Bransfield said.
To meet this increased demand, the Uni
versity plans to build new residences and
create more space in existing ones.
"There has definitely been more interest
from students in obtaining campus housing.
The University certainly has the intention
to build more graduate housing." said Uni
versity Budget Director Tim Warner.
"We're in the process of developing plans
right now, but this takes time."
As for undergraduates, a crunch at the
beginning of the year forced the University
to convert study rooms across campus into
residence nxims. This was directlv caused
by a higher freshman yield rate than
expected, hut over the years, fewer
and fewer undergraduates have been
choosing to live off campus.
Undergraduate and graduate stu
dents face different factors when

finding places to live. Graduate stu
dents are guaranteed University
housing their first year but must get it
through a housing lottery in subse
quent years. Undergraduates are
guaranteed four years of on-campus
housing.
For undergraduates, if a house or
apartment can be found in the super
heated housing market in the area,

living off campus can be much cheap
er than living anywhere on campus.
Many undergraduates also re
ceive financial assistance from par
ents and other relatives. A large
number of graduate students, howev
er, have their own families and have
been financially independent for
years.
These older students suffer due to

the University's low pay scale for
graduate student employees. In addi
tion, international students seldomly
hold outside jobs because of rest ruc
tions on their visas.
Graduate campus housing ranges
between $430 and $460 per month,
while off-campus housing is almost
always above $S(X) per month, Pai
said.

According to the survey, the aver
age price of a home in Santa Clara
County was $335,970, an increase of
17 percent from 1997.
Santa Clara County is also home
to three of California's most expen
sive cities. Atherton, Woodside and
Los Altos had average home prices
of $975,000, $965,000 and $715,(XX).
respectively.
