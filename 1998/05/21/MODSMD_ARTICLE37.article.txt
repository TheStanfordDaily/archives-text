## Actors playing actors: American Conservatory Theater's 'The Guardsman' 
### Samuel Park Senior staff writer 
Do mediums ever go to kindergarten? If
so, theater, with its self-conscious dramatics
and narcissistic self-reflections, might have
been beaten up once or twice by other medi
ums like film or literature. For theater is the
only medium at once petulant enough and
self-congratulatory enough to ask the audi
ence to applaud its efforts at the end.
And why not? Theater is fascinating. It's
no wonder that so many playwrights are ob
sessed with the stage, dazzled at a play's abil

ity to represent the world. It's Shakespeare's legacy, perhaps,
to turn the dich6 that all the world's a stage into our focal
understanding of theater. His plays are full of self-conscious
references to acting, staging and performing.
The Hungarian fin-de-siecle author Ferenc Molnar is another
playwright who is obsessed with the medium. His plays — on
the surface light comedies about love, jealousy, fidelity and ro
mantic misentanglements — are actually deeply interested in
how much the world reflects the conventions of the stage.
"The Guardsman" is an excellent example of this. It cen
ters around an acting couple, Ilona (Lynnda Ferguson) and
Nando (James Carpenter), who are experiencing marital
problems. After six months of marriage, they are tired of
each other. But relief, as well as comic pleasure, results from
Nandor's attempt to seduce Ilona by playing a "Guardsman."
His plan is to see if she'll fall for this Guardsman and thus
end his doubts about Ilona's possible infidelity. All the acting
stirs up passions and serves to liven up their marriage.
Molnar examines some of the mysteries and beauties of the
ater throughout the play. Nando first appears as the Guardsman
with a full stage entrance, emphasizing the transformation from
one actor to another. In a later act, Molnar offers another en

trance by the Guardsman, but this time his entrance is preceded
by his putting on make-up and costumes. It's as if Molnar were
showing us the magic of acting, reminding us that these are not
real people but actors in costume.
Molnar is in awe of the ability of acting to transform peo
ple. He borrows from Shakespeare, who explored the idea of
performance in many of his works, particularly in the History
plays. In these works, royalty is often aligned with acting.
Nando's transformation into the Guardsman is at the
heart of this play.
With the Guardsman's "courting" of Ilona, some wonder
ful comic complications arise. There are some really funny
moments as the Guardsman tries not to react when others
praise or criticize Nando. Carpenter's performance is best
when he "plays" the Guardsman, giving us just enough of
Nando to keep the set-up alive but also indulging in this
whole new, different character, royal accent and all.
Ferguson's Ilona is a model of class and elegance, moving
across the stage with the expected self-assurance of an actress.
But her Ilona is a complicated woman. This becomes espe
cially clear in the end, as we get a glimpse of her internal sit
uation. Molnar's play has a turn in its final moments that I

won't give away. This turn deepens the
play's meaning and moves it in a
slightly tragic direction. Ferguson gets
it just right, projecting enough wistful
ness to make us understand Ilona's situ
ation but keeping herself guarded
enough so as to keep things ambiguous.
The ending moves the play beyond a
light-hearted comedy about marital
woes and marital spats to become an
examination of trust, truth, fantasy and
people's hunger and desire for drama in
their lives. Molnar's obsessive emphasis

on medium — concentrating on act
ing, scripted lines and correct entrances and exits — is not
simply a self-absorbed playwright's narrow vision of the
world. In fact, Molnar uses the conventions of theater to
make a broader, powerful statement about people, marriage
and relationships.
Yes, this play is long (nearly three hours) and it may be
hard for some of us to relate to its New Yorker-cartoon look
and feel, from the sketchbook scenery to the overly clever
comebacks. But "The Guardsman" should be exciting for
anyone interested in mediums, staging and the connections
between acting and living.
