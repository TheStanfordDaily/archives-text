I would Ih' undc.rdrcssed .il Spajw*
I'alo \llii. I knew that ihe loiul,
designed In Wolfgang I'nck,
would turn oul In he excellent. I
knew that the restaurant would
tre.it the ciistomer like .1 movie
>l.ir, 01; .1 king, tor .< uveal. All ol
mv expectations and then
,>t»nie were met .11 Sp.igo's
Mother s 1 >av brunch on May 10.
I did not opt tor valet parking,
hut it i> prohabiv an excellent idea
il vou plan 011 eating dinner at
Spago iluring Ihe weekend.
Downtown I'alo Alio i> terriblv
lacking in parking, so rather than
enduring the ha»le i>l trying to
lind that last remaining spot, use
the service provided hv the
restaurant,
I pon entering, I notice.d the
outdoor dining tables, li looked
like a great place to spend a la/y
atternoon with \«»n 1 business
partners and watch the cars drive
by. It il hadn't been so chillv, I
might have requested lo eat
brunch outdoors.
Ihe interior decor designed
by Marbara l a/arotl makes the
setting ver\ appealing. I he,
mural-like artwork was created
by Robert liaushenhcrg and the
Smith \ndersen liallerv ol I'alo
Alto. It's inodci 11, absir.icl alvd e\
pressionist at its chaotic best.

In addition to the eye catching
artwork, the resiauralit s coloring
scheme brings vibrant\ indoors.
Sharp blue, green and red pastels
cre.tle .111 atmosphere conducive
to idle chitchat. I lie bright lighi
ing, augmented by the open win
dows .Hid an ample amount ol
lamps, added lo the pleasure ol

splurging al one of llie most
popular and expensive
restaurants in the area.
Perhaps what I appreci
ated most were the waiters. I
did not have to ask lor my
water to he refilled the
various waiters must have
refilled my water glass' 111
times! They were all dressed
in a. striking combination
— a bright blue top with a
splashy tie, and .1 black
apron lor the checks! I was
pleased al how nianv limes
Michael, mv waiter, came by ,
|o make sure everything was

And now onto I lie" tood,
which you c.tn watch being

prep.lred in I he upon kitchen. The
Mothers I >.i\' Immch was pri\-
live, which means that I could se
lect 'two items on the menu
( choosing among appoti/crs, pas
las'aiul main courses)' lor the
same price. I opted lot tlie prime
filet steak tartare with quail ei-j*.
shaved Parmesan and grilled
Lountrv bread. I lie waiter politeK
inlormed me that the dish was es
sentialh uncooked meat, used as

a spread 011 the bread. I thought,
"Win not?"
I got over the thought ol ealirig
raw meat In realizing 111.1l I
should lake advantage ol this op
poitiuiitv to sample exotic ciii
sine. I was supposed lo mix the
meat with the ipiail egg yolks,
which were splashed around the

pl.ili' i\ilher .11ti'slkally. I Ik' sleak
did not own taste like it was
Moody or uncooked rather, it
w.is hiylilv t.istv, and i was ul.ul
that I, tried it. Spajio piled so
much meat on I Ik' plate that I
couldn't even finish all of it.
Nest up was the i hine-<e duck
with red uiitv, junker, mi/una

I he diuk had to he slow roasted

the skin crispy and the meal len
