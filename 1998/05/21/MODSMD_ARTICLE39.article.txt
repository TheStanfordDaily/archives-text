## This ain't poetry, It's POEtry Musician David Poe talks about the industry 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
You might recognize singer / songwriter David Poe as
the act that opened for Tori Amos on her preview tour a
couple of weeks ago. Poe's self-titled first album, which was
released earlier this year, is a mellow mix of warm guitar
tones and Poe's soft, mellow, sensuous voice. As
Intermission spoke with Poe, he was getting ready for a
friend to come over so the two of them could have dinner
and plan their funerals.
Intermission: You've said that you are "against fascism
in vocals." What does that mean?
David Poe: I like it when musicians are conjuring,
seducing, lulling and dreaming it up for people who
aren't dreaming it up themselves. What I don't like is
when they are trying to hammer their point into your
brain with their voice as a spike.
I: So you don't like Ani DiFranco, then?
DP: No, I don't mean that at all. I think Ani's fantas
tic. I don't think she's preachy. I think she's verbose, but
in an incredibly endearing way.
I: You've also said that you don't like to think of your
words as poetry. Do you mean that your listeners
shouldn't pay attention to them?
DP: Yeah! Pay no attention to the words behind the
curtain. I just meant that I don't want people to pay ex
clusive attention to the words. People will pay a lot of at
tention to the words, which is good because I spend a
lot of time on them. It's just that you need to remember
that they are just words to a song, not a poem.
I: What's the difference between lyrics and poetry?
DP: There's Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost and
Bukowski for poetry. Those guys didn't try to make al
bums — well, maybe a few of them did — but for the
most part they didn't. That's how I think of it. I'm no
lizard king. I'm more like a lizard boot.
I: What would you be if you weren't a musician?
DP: Irish.
I: What level of popularity would you like to attain?
DP: Umm ... I don't really think about it. To me, the
last reason to do music is to make money. People that
enter into it that way are not only fooling themselves,
but they're also kind of prostituting the whole musical
experience. It's not made for people to use as a vehicle
for their own popularity, or their own wallet. And that's
because it takes too long and it's too hard. You have to
squeeze too much out of yourself. If you want those
things, you're better off becoming a shock rock radio DJ
or a music journalist or a porn star — by the way, I've
had all of those jobs in the past.
I: You've been a porn star?
DP: Oh yeah! You know. Haven't we all?
I: Where do you want to be as a musician?
DP: I just want to keep playing. It's what I've been
doing since I was 16. I'm 29 now. I just want to be good
enough to play "Mood for a Day" by Steve Howe. He's
the guitarist in Yes. I hope that they play that song at my
funeral. My idea for [the funeral] is to have a balance of
secular and religious songs, which is kinda like what my
life has been like. So I'm gonna have "All Glory, Laud and
Honor," which is a hymn by Bishop Theodolf that I love
and used to sing when I was a little boy in the boy's
choir. Then I want to include some of the songs that
have meant something to me, hopefully by the original
musicians who are still around. And then maybe one of
my own songs.
I: Many of your songs are about bad relationships. Is
that because those are the only relationships you've had,
or because those are just easiest to write about?
DP: I guess it's a bit of both. I don't want to get into
a big thing about my life. I should also say that the songs
aren't necessarily autobiographical. They're based on
true stories or something. I don't know what my dis
claimer is. (laughs) It's sort of like in the movies, you
know? Any resemblance to persons living or dead is
purely coincidental.

I: What pushes you to write songs?
DP: I don't know. I write them whenever I have time.
I: Why put it out for others to hear?
DP: Well, I think I'm really good at it. It's the thing
that I do. It's kind of like asking someone why they
rollerblade. It's just a fun thing I do. Writing songs is
most like doodling in the margins. It's just something I
do for fun that doesn't necessarily have a point to it.
I: Would you say that music is the thing that you are
best at?
DP: It's definitely the thing I am most interested in.
I: What's the thing you are best at?
DP: I would say communication. I am a bit sleepy
right now, so that's probably not coming out
I: What were some weird moments during your tour?
DP: I love surreality. It got there on this tour. That
dream state appeared more than once, and I'll tell you
why. It's like, me and this other guy are driving in this
rented car —an Oldsmobile Achieva, champagne
sparkle, for nine hours. We're listening to John
Coltrane. It's raining. We're not talking much. Then we
get to the venue. We pull up in this car, and there are all
these kids waving behind barricades hoping to get a
glimpse. No one thinks about our car. We get out of it,
and there are a few screams and waves. I go into the
venue, and I go into my little dressing room, where
there's a usually a couch, a pot of tea and a vegetable
plate. I write down the set list, tune my guitar, make sure
everything works halfway. Then usually I am kinda late
to get on stage. There's usually someone knocking on
my door, (bangs on something) Poe! One minute, man!
(laughs) I walk through a darkened hallway with my
guitar on, up a ramp, through a curtain. Suddenly, I go
from the dark into this highly lit room with thousands
of people in it. And they're screaming. And I think, God,
20 minutes ago I was in this lame rented car.

I: Who do you specifi
cally NOT listen to? Who do
you dislike?
DP: I guess the only
thing I don't like is below
average songwriters who are
extremely popular.
I: Like who?
DP: Paula Cole. I find her
really embarrassing.
I: She has a pretty voice.
DP: No, she doesn't. It's
like, Paula Cole? Please. How
much time do you have in
your day? How much time
do you have to listen to a
woman singing a song?
Because if you have time to
hear only five songs a day of
a woman singing a song,
why would you choose Paula
Cole over Joni Mitchell or
Sarah Vaughnn or Ella
Fitzgerald? I'd even listen to
Sheryl Crow over Paula
Cole. Sam Phillips is good,
too. Don't buy into this
Lilith Fair business. It's a
myth. Its just another ver
sion. If people need icons to
dedicate themselves to, fine.
That's not what music's about,
though. This whole construct is
just another thing they are trying
to sell you. It's not that these are
the best musicians. They're the
ones who have the most interest
ing marketing plans. The prettiest
dresses, the prettiest makeup
artists and stuff. I think they be
lieve in what they're doing, but
really they're just saying, "Look

how pretty I am, look at my skin shine, look at my teeth
shine." That doesn't really translate to a record, (laughs)
I: I sense some bitterness.
DP: I don't mean to be mean to anyone. I don't mean
to slam Paula Cole. You're asking me to publicly make a
statement against a fellow musician, and I don't need to
do that. And in no way am I making a statement against
Lilith Fair. God love 'em! They're great. It's the hippest
big tour going. And there are a ton of people there that I
love. I love Erykah Badu, Tracy Chapman — I think
Fiona [Apple] is pretty cool. I think the Indigo Girls
have a couple of good things to say. Lisa Loeb is a great
friend of mine. People want to talk about her pink
sweatshirt or her glasses, or the fact that she's showing a
little leg on her record. I don't care about any of that.
I: People just get upset because she gets a lot of airplay.
DP: I think that's fine for Lisa. She crafted that stuff
to get airplay. What's going to happen with Lisa —
who's smart as hell, she went to Brown — is that she's
going to stake her claim and get herself known in a
commercial way. Later on, you'll see her making records
that are not so commercial and a lot deeper. Lisa's going
to be around for as long as Shawn Colvin has been
around.
I: What's your most cherished tour memory?
DP: The food in Seattle was pretty good.

'Paula Cole? Please.
How much time do
you have in your day?'
