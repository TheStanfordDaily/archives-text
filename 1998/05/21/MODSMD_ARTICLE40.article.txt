# Where Have All the Flowers Gone?

In the drive to become the biggest, the
best and the most well-rounded college ath
letic department in the nation, some sizable
groups may have been left behind.
The last 10 years of Stanford athletics have
been marked by a gradual decrease in avail
able field space for club sports, intramurals
and general recreation.
Men's and women's Ultimate Frisbee
teams are headed into their respective na
tional championships in relative anonymity,
although both are ranked No. 1, and the
women are defending a national champi
onship. This could be because they have not
played a single home game this season — for
lack of a place to play it.
Last year the Stanford Invitational Frisbee
Tournament was held at UC-Santa cruz, and
this year, the teams were forced to fund raise
$4,000 in order to rent a soccer field 45 min
utes away in Morgan Hill.
"[The Department of Athletics) is not do
ing everything it can to help all club sports,"
said Alex Young, co-captain of the men's
Ultimate team.
"Go to places like UC-Santa Cruz —
they're able to host games at their own
place," Young said. "The same is true with
UC-Santa Barbara."
The women's rugby team came away with
a national championship this year, with the
men just barely falling short as a runner-up
in the tournament. This fall, the field for
men's and women's rugby was used as a
parking lot for Big Game.
"It destroyed the field," said Lara Strauss, a
rugby player and the president of Club Sports.
"It wasn't fixed for all of winter quarter."
Most of the club sports teams who are
able to play on campus have to practice and
play on the same field.
"We tear up the field during the practice and
then have to play a game there the next day,"
said junior lacrosse player Benton Williams.
Some recent changes to the fields near the
football stadium have made it especially dif
ficult for club sports teams and IMs to find
field space in recent years. The new women's
softball stadium was placed on the old soccer
field during the 1996-97 school year, and
soccer was moved onto the south IM fields
last summer.
The number of IM teams has dropped
considerably, simply for the lack of available
space to play the games.
"They had to cut back on the IM soccer
season because of field space," Young said.
Professor of Slavic Languages Richard
Schupbach is a self-proclaimed "gadfly" and
"rooter" for the student voice in finding
more field space.
"I was sort of appalled that this whole situa
tion came to pass," Schupbach said of the ab
sence of IM field space. "How can you not real
ize that you don't have the field space, being the
Department of Athletics at Stanford?" he asked.
Outsiders to Stanford campus — one of
the few places where people can find large
fields in the Bay Area — are being asked for

Stanford identification and getting turned
away with soccer balls in hand.
"One group that has been really affected
are people who come to play pick-up soccer
and Ultimate games," said Dan Eisenberg,
the other co-captain of men's Ultimate.
But a change might be on its way. A week
ago today, the Athletics Department received
approval to turn an open space of land into
five to six 1M playing fields. The spot is nes
tled between Pasteur Drive and Sand Hill,
Oak and Welch Roads, and is scheduled for
completion by fall quarter.
Valerie Veronin, associate athletic director,
said, "I thought that the students have done a
good job in making sure the issue wasn't put
on the backburner."
It hasn't been easy, and it has been a long
time in coming.
Heyward Robinson of Redwood City, who
has been associated with the University for over
10 years, has spearheaded the fight for more
field space during the past two years. Robinson
played Ultimate Frisbee for Stanford in the late
1980s during his time as a doctoral student in
materials science. His wife now works at
Stanford as a professor in anthropology.
Robinson leads a group known as Sijve Our
Fields, a loose coalition of students organized
through e-mail, who have demanded change.
In March 1997, Athletics Director Ted
Leland responded to a letter Robinson had
sent him and suggested a meeting. With a
group of four or five other members of Save
Our Fields, Robinson expressed his concerns,
suggesting eight or nine things that the
Athletics Department could do in order to
better utilize field space.
"He tried to marginalize us by saying they
were the only people who cared about this,"
Robinson said.
The Athletics Department is in charge of
allocating space for all varsity teams as well
as club sports. Often, and not surprisingly,
varsity sports get first priority. The depart
ment raised money for the new softball and
football stadiums without compensating
IMs for their lost space.
"They act like they own the land,"
Robinson said, "because football brings in so
much dollars."
"People there do not care ... Stanford
does not get any brownie points for having
great IMs and club sports," he said.
Club Sports faces a difficult task in bar
gaining for extra space, because most of its
money comes from its special fee. Club
Sports are financially dependent on the
Athletics Department to hear its voice and
find the space.
"One would think we would be getting a
lot more money," Strauss said. "We don't
have any training space or anything."
After a persistent effort by Robinson and
his clan, the Athletics Department made an
announcement last December of their plan
to add new fields to fill the space near Sand
Hill Road.
"This is what the administration came
back with," Robinson said. "They had said
the fields would be built by winter — we
know that didn't happen."

Veronin explained that the county requires
a 60 to 90-day period to process the request
for land use. The effort to create the fields has
also been slowed by the age-old Stanford
nemeses, El Nifio and the tiger salamander.
"The project was delayed until April be
cause of tiger salamander issues," Veronin
said. There had been concerns that the new
fields may harm the salamander habitat.
(Now you know the answer to the famous
riddle. "Why is Big Game bonfire like an IM
playing field?")
Last Thursday, the action was finally made
official. Once the permit has been received,
work should get off the ground.
"It's taken too long to get something done
but it is not totally unreasonable," Robinson
said, regarding the yearlong process of get
ting the new fields approved.
The announcement was certainly a victory
for student voice on campus. In a year punctu
ated by students' protests over housing, which
have seemed to fall on deaf ears, the success ol
Club Sports and IMs is encouraging.
"I don't know if they would have done it if
[HeywardJ and some other people hadn't
made some noise," Eisenberg said.
Schupbach has a more positive, possibly
more unbiased, opinion of the effectiveness
of student voice on campus. "When the kids
get really exited about something, it's amaz
ing how fast things are changed," he said.
Veronin concurred. "The students kept us
focused — there is a lot going on. They have
been patient."
But it's all about perspective.
"My problem is that we had to raise the is
sue in the first place," he said.
Robinson expressed his frustration over
the silence from other parts of campus. The
Committee on Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPER), the oversight com
mittee for the Athletics Department, made
no comment on the subject of club field
space during the year, Robinson said.
His quest is not yet complete. Robinson
wants to revitalize Roble Field. The modules
on the field, Bambi and Godzilla, were origi
nally intended as temporary solutions after
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. And the
field that remains is in bad shape.
"Roble Field is in horrible condition,"
Strauss said. "There was a month and a half
when the [frisbee teams] could barely prac
tice because it was so muddy."
Robinson also seeks to rectify the issue of
parking on the fields. He suggests moving event
parking, such as for Big Game, to a new garage.
Stanford may not have it so bad, though.
At UC-Berkeley, a much more urban campus
with much less open space, the Ultimate team
must practice on the womens' softball field.
Regardless of remaining problems,
though, next year should look a lot nicer for
club players and IM athletes.
Schupbach lauded Robinson's role in es
tablishing new fields.
"It was Heyward who took the ball and
ran with it,"he said. "They should name
them after him."
