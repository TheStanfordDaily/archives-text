## Various Artists: Largo

As any music
reviewer
l knows,
there are hundreds
and hundreds of
bad albums re
leased every year.
Most of them suf-

fer from a lack of something — vision, originality,
musical talent, etc. — or seem to have been tossed
off without a thought. However, every once in a
while an album comes along that has all of these
things and still manages to be spectacularly bad.
"Largo" is such an album.
"Largo" is the brainchild of producer / songwrit
ers Rick Chertoff and Rob Hyman, who envisioned
a concept album in which Dvorak's "Largo" theme
would tie together an epic American song cycle.

Their obsessive vision was so powerful that they attracted a large group of
famous and talented musicians including the Chieftains, Taj Mahal, Carol
King, Cyndi Lauper and three members of The Band. Unfortunately, all of
this musical talent goes to waste on a set of insipid and awful songs.
The main problem is that the lyrics are uniformly awful, which isn't that
surprising considering this is the same songwriting team that burdened the
world with Joan Osborne's "What If God Was One of Us?" They all sound
like an academic trying to write "intelligent" folk songs, and often include
dreadfully politically correct anachronisms. The music is equally bad, with
lots of lame "bluesy" guitars that sound like 70s classic rock.
There are some good performances — the Chieftains and Garth Hudson
each do great instrumentals of the "Largo" theme, and Taj Mahal plays a fiery
cover of Lightnin' Hopkins "Needed Time" on a dobro — but they can't re
deem this album.
In the end "Largo" is reminiscent of that other American epic, "Moby Dick,"
in which the pursuit of an obsession results in tragic and disastrous failure.
