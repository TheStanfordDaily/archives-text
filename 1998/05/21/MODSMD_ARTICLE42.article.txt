# Tori Amos
## 'From the Choirgirl Hotel' 
### 
Some say that Tori Amos has written some
of the most beautiful and personal music
ever created. Others maintain that it is
among the most obfuscated and annoying. Her
eclectic 1996 album, "Boys for Pele," did noth
ing to lessen this divide. The album even frus
trated some fans, present company included.
Her new album, "From the Choirgirl Hotel,"
throws in some industrial and turns up the rock
'n' roll a notch but is ultimately a more accessi
ble and cohesive album. Stand-outs include
"Spark," the first single; "Raspberry Swirl," a
mainstream dance number; "Jackie's Strength,"
a touching ballad which contrasts Amos' recent
marriage with memories from her childhood;
and "Playboy Mommy," an intimate portrait of
her miscarriage.
Primal beats and guitar distortions will take
fans by surprise, though Amos' primal cries will
surprise no one. The ballads are as beautiful
and heartbreaking as ever. The songs take re
peated listenings to fully enjoy. However, even if
you were disappointed by "Pele" or have none
of her other albums, "Choirgirl" is a worthwhile
purchase and a great album.
