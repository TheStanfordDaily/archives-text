# Peter, Paul and Mary:
## 'Around the Campfire' 
### 
One of Peter, Paul and Mary's greatest
strengths is its versatility. However, on
the group's latest release, "Around the
Campfire," this flexibility actually works
against it. Designed as a collection of "campfire
classics" that serves as a comprehensive greatest
hits album, the double-disc set features an
eclectic mix of folk classics and children's songs
which the trio has released through the years.
Many of the songs are the ones that made
the trio famous. Classics such as "Where Have
All the Flowers Gone," "If I Had a Hammer"
and "Puff (the Magic Dragon)" showcase the
beautiful harmonies and musically articulate
guitar melodies that Peter, Paul and Mary has

mastered. Folk anthems like "Blowin' in the
Wind," "500 Miles," and "We Shall Overcome"
remind the listener that one of the greatest val
ues of folk music is its message.
Interspersed with these staples of Peter,
Paul and Mary's career are a number of
lesser-known but incredibly beautiful bal
lads. "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" is one of the
most memorable songs on the album, fea
turing tremendous three-part harmonies
and a haunting minor tune. "Light One
Candle" is also a gem that features a back
ground chorus and a near-gospel feel.
But the continuity of the album is inter
rupted by the inclusion of children's songs

that fit the campfire motif. "The Marvelous
Toy," "Right Field" and "Kumbaya," though
terrific for younger kids, detract from the
adult orientation of the rest of the program.
In trying to appeal to all listeners, Peter, Paul
and Mary puts together a frustrating pas
tiche that switches from thought-provoking
protest to storybook sing-along.
However, navigating "Around the
Campfire" is worthwhile, since many of the
songs are both beautiful and timeless, re
vealing the talent and musical accessibility of
Peter, Paul and Mary.
