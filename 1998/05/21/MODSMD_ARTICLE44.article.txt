## 'ESPN Presents Music From the X-Games Volume 3’ 
### 
ESPN has brought new alternative sports
to television with the X-Games.
Unfortunately, this compilation featuring
music from the X-Games has little to offer.
Many of these songs have received lots of air
play in the past couple of years. That isn't to say
that the songs aren't good. This album ha 3 many
great songs, but if you're a fan of punk, ska,
metal and electronica, then you probably have
most of these songs, or at least the good ones.
The album opens with the song which had the
most airplay in 1997, "The Impression that I
Get" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. The
other ska song on the album, "Road of the
Righteous" by Dropkick Murphys, is a fun polit
ical rant that provides a good balance of old
school attitude and new-school musicality. 311, a
genre-crossing band, provides "All Mixed Up," a
mellow song that also has received much airplay.
There are two great punk songs on the al
bum: "I'm the One" by Descendants and
"Society" by Pennywise. But most people who
are into West Coast punk already have albums
by either Pennywise or Descendants. So these
songs are redundant.
The electronica on this album includes two
big-time hits, "Going Out of My Head" by
Fatboy Slim and "Busy Child" by Crystal
Method. The big breakbeats and rock samples
of Fatboy Slim contrast greatly to the synthe
sized organized noise of Crystal Method.
The Chemical Brothers unfortunately come
up a little short with a barely musical remix of
"Toothache" by The Charlatans UK. Aside
from "I'm Broken" by Pantera, which really en
capsulates the essence of thrash but is 5 years
old, the metal additions are worthless. The
downside: maybe "heavy metal" on this album
is disappointing.
Compilations in general are designed to get
new bands heard. The good songs are well
known and from prominent bands, which
makes this one somewhat repetitive.
