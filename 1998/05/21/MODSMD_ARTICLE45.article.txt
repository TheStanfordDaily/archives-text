# Bad Religion:
## 'No Substance' 
### 
With "No Substance," punk
veterans Bad Religion
surge forward into un
charted realms of musical prowess.
The band does what it has done best
while continuing to churn out fresh,
original songs. "Substance,'' one of the
group's strongest albums yet, repre
sents the best of everything that has
made the band stand out for 18 years
— powerful vocals, intellectually chal
lenging lyrics and classic punk
rhythms.
The group launches into the al
bum with "Hear It* a traditional
style Bad Religion number powered
by the pull-no-punches onslaught of
guitarists Greg Hetson and Brian
Baker. As the band charges forward,
singer Greg Graffin hits full stride,
ringing out "like a morning crow and
his unwelcome song / or a worn-out
broken record that keeps skipping
along / mountains of instructions
you keep piling on me / resound like
a cacophonous symphony."
The most stunning performance
on the album is the gallop-paced
drumming of Bobby Schayer, whose
full-throttle style is no longer ham
pered by familiar repetitions or pre
dictability. "Substance" proves Schayer
to be not only one of the best in the
business but also an indispensable
member of the group.
"The Biggest Killer of American
History," one of the album's strongest,
is pure Bad Religion — hard, fast and
melodic. Charged by Schayer's drum
chirps and Jay Bentley's trademark
bass rumble, Graffin hits a zone,
singing fearlessly, challenging societal
values and harnessing full control of
his band's power.
Spine-tingling vocals are delivered
through bleak storytelling in"The
Voracious March of Godliness" and
"Victims of the Revolution," possibly
Bad Religion's most powerful songs
ever. Graffin's brutally honest lyrics
alone make this album — like other
Bad Religion albums —.» must
have. Punk rock has never sounded
this way before.
