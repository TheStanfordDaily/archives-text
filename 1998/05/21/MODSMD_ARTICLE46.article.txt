# Eve 6
## 
### 
By the time I got through
"Tongue Tied", the eighth
track on Eve 6's self-titled
debut, I was tongue-tied, won
dering how a band could pro

duce eight nearly identical tracks
featuring the same chords and
the same chord progressions.
I had to resign myself to the
fact that Eve 6 was going to offer
me little more than an amateur
ish combination of Green Day
and Silverchair.
The band lacks originality. If
you're going to fall into an estab
lished mold and produce the
widespread genre of poppy radio
rock, then you'd better do it well.
Eve 6, while graced with some
potential, is nothing special at
this point.
Eve 6's lyrics read like really bad
poetry. Listeners will have trouble

identifying with them because
they are so cryptic. Even worse,
Collins tries to use really big words
to intellectualize his music but ob
viously lacks the vocabulary and
(dare I say it?) the intelligence re
quired to pull off such a feat.
"So Cal is where my mind states
but not my state of mind / I'm not
as ugly sad as you /or am I
origami folded up and just pretend
demented as the motives in your
head," he babbles in "Inside Out."
All I can say is, know your limits.
"Inside Out," one of the few
tracks on the album with an infec
tious riff and memorable chorus,
demonstrates hit-potential.

The rest of the tracks all sound
the same: bad.
The musicians seem talented
beneath their mediocre product.
Drummer Tony Fagenson and
guitarist Jon Siebels appear to
have mastery over their instru
ments. Collins' voice, on the other
hand, is lacking. He is sometimes
overpowered by the instruments.
Give these boys time, though.
They're not hopeless. Let them
work out the kinks in their debut
album and maybe we'll have a
band on our hands.
