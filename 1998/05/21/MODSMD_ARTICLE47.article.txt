# Semisonic:
## 'Feeling Strangely Fine' 
### 
Semisonic, a Minneapolis-based trio, has re
leased its second album "Feeling Strangely
Fine." Anyone who has bothered to turn on
a radio must be familiar with the lead track of
this album, "Closing Time," a song that has been
steadily played for some time now.
"Closing Time" seems to have caught many
people by storm. It's the kind of catchy song to
which the lyrics are known even to the people
who hate it. Semisonic mixes a calm piano,
nice guitar and drumriffs in this song well,

turning it into a louder rock 'n' roll chorus.
Semisonic sounds like many other top 40
bands with a special hint of Oasis and Elton
John. Other than "Closing Time" its sound is
not anything especially new or different.
"Closing Time" is, unfortunately, the first and
best track on "Feeling Strangely Fine" which
makes the album disappointing.
Although there are a couple good tracks on
"Feeling Strangely Fine" — "Closing Time"
and "Singing in My Sleep" — the rest of the
album does not deliver. The other tracks are
much slower and rely a great deal on the ver
satility of a vocalist who is not that versatile.
