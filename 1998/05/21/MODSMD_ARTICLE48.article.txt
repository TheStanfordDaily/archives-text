## A 						portrait of the artist as a young woman 'Artemisia' has an historic heroine 
### 
( a rtemisia' is a French import about the young life of art history s first female painter.
/\ Valentina Cervi plays the 15-year-old Baroque artist in 1610. Stuck in a convent
-ZjLschool in Rome, Artemisia steals church candles to sketch at night. When her father,
the famous artist Orazio Gentileschi, discovers her gift, he tears her out of the convent faster
than you can say "da Vinci" and sets his prodigy to work in his studio.
Saturated with her father's teaching, Artemisia applies to the famous Academy. She is refused be
cause of her gender, but not before the professor tells her father that she paints well —"like a man."
As luck would have it, Agostino Tassi, a Florentine as famous for his art as his debauchery, ar
rives to assist Orazio with frescoes commissioned by the papacy. Although he taunts Artemisia
for her beauty, telling her to model, he is impressed with her talent and accepts her as a pupil.
As with many tragic lovers, antagonism colors the pairs first sessions. But artistic and sex
ual passion is the result, and their love affair becomes the inspiration for Artemisia's most
famous work — "Judith Beheading Holofernes."
And like many great love stories, father isn't happy to discover that his teenager's art
lessons involve more than painting with a man 20 years her senior. Orazio, in a well-meant
but destructive move, has Agostino arrested for rape. It is here that the lovers' true passions
are put to the test.
"Artemisia" begins as an interesting portrait of the developing talent of one of art history's
most important figures. Cervi gives a performance worthy of a young woman torn between
passion, ambition and puberty. She is backed by a script that allows the facets of her charac
ter to emerge with humor and surprise.
Unfortunately, the script and the picture flounder halfway through. Instead of remaining
the story of a woman struggling both for artistic acceptance and reconciliation of her love
and talent in a time of confusion, the story turns into a courtroom drama. Instead of show
ing maturity in the face of adversity, Artemisia reverts to pouting.
The film is saved somewhat when Artemisia continues her first priority — being a serious
artist. But in the end, it is perspective that the film lacks, and as hard as it tries, "Artemisia"
needs more than a strong beginning and starring performance to make up for that.
