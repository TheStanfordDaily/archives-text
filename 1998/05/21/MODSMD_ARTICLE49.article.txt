# Honest, but hypocritical
## 'Bulworth' is a political paradox 
### 
What would happen if a politician actually told the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth?
All hell would break loose, of course. And break loose it does in writer / actor / director
Warren Beatty's new farce, "Bulworth."
The purpose of the film is to provide an attractively packaged (read: commercially suc
cessful) soapbox for Beatty's politics. Like the jaded Senator lay Bulworth, Beatty is more than
a bit disillusioned with a Democratic Party that he thinks has sold out — its core values hav
ing been tainted (or replaced) by special-interest corruption and the politics of compromise.
Under the guise of the truth-telling Bulworth, Beatty gives a scathing criticism of political
corruption in which he literally runs the gamut. "Bulworth" effectively attacks everything
from politicians under the thumb of insurance companies to the abandonment of the
African-American community by greedy, corporate political parties.
And having secured the nearest thing to creative control one can find in Hollywood today,
Beatty is able to fashion "Bulworth" into a pretty irreverent social commentary.
The movie's downfall, however, is the unfortunate desire to be all things to all people. It's rather
ironic that Beatty suffers from this desire, given what "Bulworth" is so obviously trying to say.
Such caustic irreverence is indeed hard to swallow, so Beatty tries to lighten things up
with a comedic subplot that throws him into the urban black ghetto — to which he must
assimilate in order to survive. The irony here is not ineffective, but it is unnecessary. Many
of these scenes, however humorous, seem contrived solely for the sake of making Beatty's
views go down more easily.
The best scenes in "Bulworth" are Beatty's rap-style political invectives, the most mem
orable of which he launches on a national talk show. It's a speech that makes you think,
whatever your politics may be.
It's only when "Bulworth" strays from political attack that it becomes anything less than a
good movie. Maybe Beatty is missing his own message about who really loses in the politics
of compromise.
