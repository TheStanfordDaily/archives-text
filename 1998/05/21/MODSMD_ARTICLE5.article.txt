graduate degree. Afterward, he de
cided to focus on teaching and took a
job at the College of San Mateo. In
1937, he returned to Stanford as a
professor and taught until 1971.
"I've had the chance to meet some
of his students," said Bvrd's son-in

debted to him for getting them on the
right track." From his first teaching
job in 1930 until his retirement, he is
estimated to have taught over 40,(KK)

acted as its head until his retirement.
His students went on to establish sim

across the country.

more than SO kxiks on health and.
according to Looniis, was instrumen
tal in making medical knowledge un
derstandable and available to the av

erage person. In order to aid the
spread of medical knowledge to pub
lic and private institutions, he acted
as a consultant to many school dis
tricts. colleges, universities, corpora
tions and government agencies.
Byrd was also a loyal sports fan.

fered the position of head track coach
at Stanford, he turned it down to
focus on teaching and writing.

Research Advisory Committee of
the Lifetime Sports Educational Pro

commended by the California State
Assembly, and in 1991 he was hon
ored with the National Honor Award
by Beta Sigma Gamma for his inspi
rational teaching style.
"He was at the top of his game,
loved teaching and was very active in
his profession." said Bvrd's son.
Thomas.
Despite all his other achieve

achievement was diagnosing his wife
Jennie's cancer, which was operated
on in time to allow them to spend a
long, full life together.

"If it wasn't for the scholarship he

the opportunity to attend Stanford,"
Thomas Bvrd said.
