# Not quite 'Excalibur ...’
## but 'Quest for Camelot' is enchanting 
### 
I know what you're think
ing. This film is for little
kids, so why would a col
lege student go see it? The fact
is that "Quest for Camelot" is
an entertaining tale about
King Arthur and Excalibur.
The artwork doesn't match up
with Disney, but the morals
spliced into this animated fea
ture are comprehensible for
both the younger set and the
older kids at heart.
Unfortunately, "Quest for
Camelot" will not be seen by a
wide audience because of
poor publicity. This is too
bad. I enjoyed watching
Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) strug
gle to find Excalibur with the
help of a blind outcast named
Garrett (Cary Elwes). Along

the way, strong bonds develop between them,
and, well, you know the rest.
Gary Oldman is the evil knight Ruber, who
has his Griffin (Bronson Pinchot) steal the mag
ical sword from King Arthur (Pierce Brosnan).
Oldman supplies a powerful and cruel voice for
the ugly manifestation of Ruber; the believabil
ity of the bad guy in "Quest for Camelot" is cen
tral to making it work.
Kayley gets involved in the search for
Excalibur when her father, Sir Lionel (Gabriel
Byrne), is killed by Ruber. Kayley becomes
quite determined, bringing up themes similar
to those in"The Lion King" and "Pocahontas."
Against all odds, the central orphaned charac
ter must find ways to overcome adversity.
In "Quest for Camelot," the formula works
well because of the sentimentality attributed to
the blind Garrett. We want them to find
Excalibur, and we hate Ruber for killing her fa
ther and trying to destroy the kingdom.
Along the way, sidekicks appear to bring

humor into the mix. The aloof Cornwall (Don
Rickles) and the quasi-socialite Devon (Eric
Idle) are the dual personalities of a two-headed
dragon with confidence problems. They help
our hero and heroine in their battle against
Ruber's mechanized army created from an
Acme solution (Wile E. Coyote, anyone?).
The music in the film is average. Celine Dion
and Bryan White sing some of the musical
numbers, but none of them roll off the tongue
like "A Whole New World" or "Under the Sea."
"Quest for Camelot" is still worth the time
if you are expecting something light and
whimsical. In addition to the gags aimed at
children, there is some humor just for adults
— one sequence playfully denounces inbreed
ing, while another mimics Clint Eastwood's
classic "are-you-looking-at-me" scene. One
last reason to go see the film — Stanford Allen
was the fdm editor. Enough said.
