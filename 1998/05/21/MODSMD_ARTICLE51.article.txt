# Big trouble in little Kiev
## Cheers for 'A Friend of the Deceased 
### 
Kiev is one of those exotic places that we used to think was in Russia but is actually in
the Ukraine. Life there has changed alarmingly since the disbandment of the Soviet
Union. "A Friend of the Deceased," an excellent new film from Vyacheslav
Krishtofovich, tells us how it all goes wrong for one citizen.
Anatoli (played by Alexandre Lazarev) is very much the "superfluous man" of late 20th
century Kiev. Beloved of 19th-century Russian novels, this character type emerges with new
force in the changing world of post-Communism. Unemployed and unemployable, Anatoli's
raison-d'£tre lies in the past. In the Communist era he was a respected linguist, a man of fine
sensibilities and above all an intellectual. Now he is nothing.
When his wife Katia (Angelika Nevolina) runs off with a tall bearded man in a large red car,
it becomes time to hit the vodka. Luckily, his drinking partner Dima (played with convincing
roguishness by Eugen Pachin) has a scheme to save the day. He knows a contract killer.
The farce begins. Deciding that suicide is better than murder, Anatoli designates himself
as the hit man's target and sets up his date with fate. When there is an unexpected change of
plan, Anatoli is left with time on his hands. After an unscheduled night of excitement with a
prostitute named Lena (Tatiana Krivitska), he changes his mind about ending his life.
It's just too bad that the killer can't be un-hired. This is where a second hit man be
comes necessary...
Morbid though this sounds, the film resonates as a comedy. Daily life verges on the
bizarre. Expressions of affection have been replaced by loving donations of money. Even the
toughest criminal gaze softens perceptibly at the moment of transaction.
Anatoli's own heart is lined with lead. Given the chance to function both as the Angel of
Death and the Angel of Mercy, he is equally impassive in either capacity. This heaviness
weighs things down a little, but the film pulls through without languishing.
Krivitska is pleasantly chirpy as Lena, but the most intriguing performance comes from
Elena Korikova, playing a widow who becomes involved with Anatoli. After the death of her
husband, everyone else has fallen away, leaving behind neither love nor money. What is her
place in life? Perhaps she is the last beautiful thing in a grimy, dying world.
