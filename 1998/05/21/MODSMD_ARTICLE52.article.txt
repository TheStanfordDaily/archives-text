# Robert Redford's equine escapades
## 'The Horse Whisperer' gets a whinny 
### 
< r T" l he Horse Whisperer' should have been billed as a horse movie for grownups. Don't take
-I- little girls to it unless they're sedated.
Robert Redford's latest endeavor attempts to capture the essence of Nicholas Evans' best
selling, critically-acclaimed novel. There isn't a lot of condensing involved — the movie is al
most three hours long — but somehow the spirit of the book got lost anyway.
Kristin Scott Thomas stars as Annie Mac Lean, a slightly neglectful workaholic mom who ed
its a New York magazine. She leaves most of the parenting to her husband Robert (Sam Neill).
The movie opens when their 13-year-old daughter Grace (Scarlett Johansson), a champion
horseback rider, gets into a disastrous riding accident involving her horse, Pilgrim, and a truck.
Part of Grace's leg comes off, and Pilgrim is severely wounded, physically and mentally.
So Annie finds someone to help heal Pilgrim (and perhaps the withdrawn Grace) — a
"horse whisperer." This person is supposed to be able to "help horses who have people prob
lems." Annie, ever in control, takes Grace and Pilgrim to the horse whisperer's Montana ranch.
Enter Redford as Tom Booker, a calm, in-charge and slightly smug man who spends a lot
of the movie taking Annie down a few pegs.
If you are very, very patient or are a film student, you can spend three hours adoring
Robert Richardson's breathtaking cinematography. However the elements that give the
movie an ethereal feel in the beginning start to drag on after an hour.
The plot begins to stretch, too. The screenplay concentrates more on Pilgrim than on the
other significant elements of the story — Grace and Annie's need to heal their relationship, the
Mac Leans' marital problems and, of course, the budding romance between Annie and Tom.
Johansson provides the most stellar acting; she plays the sullen Grace, a teenager dealing
with intense tragedy. She clicks especially well with Thomas, and the two create a very believ
able troubled relationship. Redford, however, appears to be playing himself in a cowboy hat;
maybe with his reputation, he doesn't need to bother acting anymore.
"The Horse Whisperer" definitely has its moments, but they're few and far between. Not even
the solid performances of a talented cast can save you from feeling every minute of this movie.
