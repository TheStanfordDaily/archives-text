# Go now to see 'Go Now'
## A 						disability shakes an authentic romance 
### 
£ o Now' is a traditional love
I story with a slight twist
rarely portrayed in roman
tic films — disability. The movie,
which flip-flops among comedy, love
story and drama, has a talented cast of
actors including English rap artist
Tricky and Robert Carlyle, who re
cently starred in"The Full Monty." "Go
Now" is about a couple who falls in love
just as disaster, in the form of multiple
sclerosis, appears in their lives.
Sometimes things just don't turn out
the way you want them to. That is the
case for Nick (Carlyle). He has a tight
group of friends that he plays soccer
with, he loves his construction job, and
he's young. Everything is going right. He

finds and falls in love with a beautiful
woman named Karen (Juliet Aubrey).
They move in together, and it seems as if
they were meant for each other.
Then, things begin to go wrong.
Nick's body begins to deteriorate inex
plicably. At first, his eyesight wavers; then
parts of him begin to go numb. By the
time he learns that he has multiple scle
rosis, he has stopped hanging out with
his friends, quit his job and needs two
canes to move around. He's still in love
with Karen, but he's afraid of holding her
back with his illness. He does his best to
make her leave him (hence the title).
"Go Now" is a brilliant piece of work.
Director Michael Winterbottom works
with a wonderful cast and a very good

script to create a frighteningly realistic
story. It feels less like a movie and more
like a documentary. The story seems gen
uine because Winterbottom chooses to
disperse the emotionally wrenching
scenes among comedic ones. The soccer
scenes, which don't actually show anyone
playing soccer, contain some of the
movie's funniest moments.
Don't be put off by the subject matter.
Although "Go Now" has its sad mo
ments, it is above all a love story. If you
liked "Sleepless in Seattle," but wish it
had been less fairy tallish, this is the
movie for you.
