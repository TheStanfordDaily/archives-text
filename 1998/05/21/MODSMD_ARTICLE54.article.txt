27-word fiction

Pinch us, baby! Only two more issues!
Yar yar yar yarJ Boogie bump! Fizzle pop! That's the sound of our brains
slowly reconstituting. We will miss hanging out at The Daily at all hours, shirk
ing our schoolwork and not getting enough sleep. Psyche!
Anyway, we are really enjoying how everyone's sense of the 27-word fiction
piece has matured. We aren't Just getting scraps of poetry anymore. Oh, no!
Now we even get bits of philosophy and upsetting bits of thought
For once, no mistakes. Yay! We will try to make some more mistakes in this

issue* so that we will have something to write about in this box next week.
Hopefully, everyone remembered to celebrate Nkomo's birthday this past
weekend. If not, you have a whole other year to plan for the next time. Next
year, it will be on a Sunday.
Anyway, kiddies. Feel good, don't eat too many prunes and remember that
a slippery floor is nothing but a wet surface after all.
