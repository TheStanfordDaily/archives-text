## Got None? 
### Mae West Coltrane 
So you're not getting any.
Everyone else is flaunting the
stains, the packaging and the
red eyes that ... er, ... come
with "relating" to a significant
other with frequency. I bet
you're tired of it, aren't you?
Actually, that's wrong. You're
NOT tired of it. You probably
have more energy than usual,
chipper young dapper that you
are. And no wonder. Unless
you've been shaking your own
hand, chances are that you
haven't been having orgasms at
all for the past few weeks. You
probably feel a bit stronger. You
could probably just run for
miles and miles. Great.
(Quit your snarling! I'm
trying to make you feel better.
After all, you are part of a long
standing tradition of not-get
ting-any people.)
For instance, priests.
According to a recent arti
cle in"The Independent," the
Catholic church invented
"priestly celibacy" in 1139 in or
der to stop priests from having
sex with women whose children
would then lay claim to dioce
san property and wealth. It's
been a part of priestliness since
then. And Catholic priests have
done a lot of nice things with
their time.
A few devout Hindus also
have something in common
with you.
In Tantric traditions, ejacula
tion was believed to waste the en
ergy equivalent of about 24 hours
of concentrated mental effort. So
they avoid that s-e-x word.
You also have something in
common with many Taoists.
Taoism has advocated
celibacy for the past 6,000 years.
According to Times Newspapers
Limited, as recently as 1993,
many Taoists believed that a ta
blespoon of semen was supposed
to be the equivalent of two pieces
of steak, 10 eggs, six oranges and
two lemons. Makes you rethink
your dinner, doesn't it?
Women don't need to
worry. Apparently, orgasms for
women do not cause any loss of

vital fluid, according to Taoist
theory. Female orgasms are
supposed to actually give en
ergy to sexual partners. How
you can give energy without
losing any is beyond me, but
never mind that.
I hope you are learning
something from this.
You probably didn't get a
chance to hang with Tiger Woods,
but you might have something in
common with him, too.
Try asking any not-yet
snapped-up friendly neighbor
hood athletes who they like to
do before a big game.
Apparently, it's all the rage not
to do anyone at all. In a 1994
edition of Runner's World, for
mer no. 1 world-ranked 5,000-
meter runner in the world
Marty Liquori put it well. "Sex
makes you happy, and happy
people don't run a 3:47 mile."
"If you're on a mountain
top retreat for a week eating
berries and nuts like 1960
Olympic 1,500-meter cham
pion Herb Elliot did, you're go
ing to beat someone who steps
out of an air-conditioned
Mercedes. It's the edge that the
Africans have, that anyone
from a poor country has. You
cannot have the same aggres
sion when your needs are met,"
Liquori said.
Granted, Liquori is a tiny bit
of a rascist (in both senses of the
word) but he has a good point.
You also have something in
common with an English free
lance health writer.
In 1986, an English woman
by the name of Liz Hodgkinson
wrote a book called "Sex is Not
Compulsory." The book not
only advocated celibacy, but
called sex unhealthy and
claimed that falling in love was
a disease akin to a stress-related
condition. She and her hus
band, a medical journalist, said
that they'd been celibate for five
years at the time the book was
written and went on to say that
a strict vegetarian diet was a
necessary component of their
sexless lifestyle.
So don't feel too bad. It
seems you have a leg up over your

competitors. (Unfortunately,
not in a literal sense.)
After all, look at the an
imals. According to a 1997
article in Scientific
American called "Does lust
for sex kill males in their
prime?" too much sex can
even kill you. An English
scientist at University
College in London experi

mented on worms and
found that male worms
didn't live as long as female
worms because they spent
their energy and time com
peting with other male
worms, chasing females and
defending territory. When
genetically altered so that
they were chronically lazy,
they'd live almost twice as

long. Slacker female worms
didn't live any longer than
active young wormen.
Finally, take a look at all
the bad stuff that's out there.
Just getting properly tested
for all the requisite diseases
can take three or four weeks.
Plus there's that two-hour
sex talk you need to have,
the hassle of dental dams,

condoms, lubricant, sex toys
and a copy of the most re
cent free sexx column.
It's really not worth the
effort. Just kidding.
