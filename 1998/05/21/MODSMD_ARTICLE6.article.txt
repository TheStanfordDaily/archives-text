The American Academy of Arts
and Sciences has elected five Stan
ford faculty members and one re
searcher to its membership.
The academy was founded during
the American Revolution to recog
nize achievement in science. scholar
ship. the arts and public affairs and to
conduct various projects and studies,
according to its World Wide Web
site. This year, the academy added
146 new fellows and 22 foreign hon
orary members to its membership of
more than 4,(KK). which includes
many members of the Stanford com
munity.
"I'm very pleased to be a mem
ber." said Richard Scheller. a profes
sor of molecular and cellular physiol
ogy and a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator. "It's your col
leagues who nominate you and who
give you a vote of confidence bv

electing you. so it's a great honor."
Scheller was honored in biomed
ical sciences as a result of his research
on the mechanisms of synaptic trans
mission and cell-to-cell communica
tion. The aim of the research is to aid
in the understanding of biomechani
cal processes behind learning and
memory.
Prof. Richard Tsien. the founder
of the Department of Molecular and
Cellular Physiology and a Howard
Hughes investigator, was honored
for similar research on intracellular
signaling. His research focuses on the
role of calcium ion channels in synap
tic mechanisms.
Another recipient. French and
Italian Prof. Hans Gumbrecht. was
cited for his work as editor of a 25-
volume handKxik on medieval liter
ature and his work on the history of
Spanish literature.
"ITie academv honors you for the
impact you have on your field,"
Gumbrecht said. "It's kind of a life
time achievement award. I assume
my current work on the beauty of
American football wouldn't have
gotten me in."
As an immigrant, he added that "it
is especially nice to be chosen bv an
academy of a country I came to. After
coming here nine years ago from
Germany, 1 no longer feel like an im
migrant."

Helen Quinn, a senior staff physi
cist at the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center, was inducted to the phys
ical science class of academy fellows.
She is coordinating the study of
SLAC's new collider, the Asymmet
ric B Factory, and is also involved in
programs to improve public science
education, such as annual workshops
for high school physics teachers.
Chemistry Prof. Edward
Solomon was honored for his use of
spectroscopy — how materials ab
sorb and reflect different colors
and frequencies of light — in the
studv of industrial and biological

catalysts. His research has been
used by pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies.
Leonard Ratner, a professor
emeritus of music, has been teaching
music composition and theory at
Stanford since 1947. His works for
string quartets and symphonies have
been performed by the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra.
The academy will host an offi
cial induction ceremony in October
at its headquarters in Cambridge,
Mass. The first duty of the new
members will be to nominate next
year's fellows.
