49ers.
However. Zenobia Austin, a se

Rather, she will he performing as
a Gold Rush cheerleader. She re
cently found out she will join 33 other
females in cheering for the profes

tense competition against 250 other
hopeful Gold Rush cheerleaders for
approximately 13 spots. There are M
girls on the squad with about 21 re
turning from last year.
"When 1 went to go try out. 1 was
so intimidated. All of the other girls
were really good dancers, so I was re
ally shocked when I found out that 1
made it." said Austin, who first heard
about the trvouts from a friend.

The selection process included
four rounds that started in the begin

volved dancing, and the fourth was a
formal interview. An interview that,
according to Austin, was meant to
show how she carried herself and
how she would represent the team.
