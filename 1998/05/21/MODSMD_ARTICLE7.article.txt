### Art Diaz Contributing writer 
The various destinations that
graduating Stanford seniors will he
heading to next year now include the
playing field of the San Francisco
49ers.
However. Zenobia Austin, a se
nior economics major, will not he
taking the field as an NFL player.
Rather, she will he performing as
a Gold Rush cheerleader. She re
cently found out she will join 33 other
females in cheering for the profes
sional football team. Austin faced in
tense competition against 250 other
hopeful Gold Rush cheerleaders for
approximately 13 spots. There are M
girls on the squad with about 21 re
turning from last year.
"When 1 went to go try out. 1 was
so intimidated. All of the other girls
were really good dancers, so I was re
ally shocked when I found out that 1
made it." said Austin, who first heard
about the trvouts from a friend.

The selection process included
four rounds that started in the begin
ning of May. Three of the rounds in
volved dancing, and the fourth was a
formal interview. An interview that,
according to Austin, was meant to
show how she carried herself and
how she would represent the team.

matchup for Austin as it allows her
to couple her love for dancing with
her enthusiasm and admiration for
the sports team.
"They're a quality and re
spectable organization. To be a part
of that is really awesome," Austin
said. "I was a huge fan ever since I
grew up in Stockton, (Calif.,) so
they're my team."
Dancing since the age of 3, Austin
performed ballet until she was 8, at

which point she started to focus on
jazz, lyrical and hip-hop dancing in
stead.
"I used to run around a lot when 1
was a little kid. My mom decided I
should channel all that energy, so she
put me in dance."
Austin became involved in cheer
leading her last two years of high
school. Interestingly enough, she did
not make the squad her sophomore
year. Here at Stanford, Austin was a
member of the now defunct Stan
ford cheerleaders her freshman and
sophomore years. Austin consid
ered the loss of the Stanford cheer

leaders a great one for the Universi
ty. You can presently see her dance
in Jam Pac'd, a dance troupe on cam
pus that specializes in modern danc
ing.
According to Austin, her family is
equally ecstatic about her recent ac
ceptance into the professional
squad.
"Mv whole family loves the 49ers.
My dad can look back at all those
years of dance classes and finally say
that they were worth it," she said.
While Austin performs with the
49ers. she will also be working for the
technology company. Intel.
