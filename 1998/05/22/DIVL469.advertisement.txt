Program is reflected in its thematic focus, Research as a Form of Public Service . This means that research and scholarship are applied to serve specific community needs or the
general public interest. This year s Public Service Scholars theses exemplify the incredible range of community concerns, application of research to explore solutions, and the power
of uniting community service with the development of knowledge.
