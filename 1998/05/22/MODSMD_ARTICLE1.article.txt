# More graduate students left unhoused

According to Housing Assignment Services manager
Kathleen Bransfield, 883 graduate students who entered
the lottery were left unassigned.
Graduate housing lottery numbers became public in
formation prematurely last night when students found
them posted on the World Wide Web before their sched
uled release time. The numbers, confirmed by Bransfield,
validated the recent graduate housing survey's predic
tions of a significant shortfall in on-campus housing next
year.
This total is divided into three housing groups: 244 sin
gle graduates who said they would live anywhere, 323
graduates who said they would live in only specified choic
es, and 158 couples. All families who registered in the
housing lottery received housing.
This number does not appear much higher than last
year's total of 809 students unassigned at first glance, but
looking at the numbers closely reveals more problems.
"They really just need to build more housing," said
Tony Lopez, a master's student in physics.
In order to provide more immediate spaces. Universi
ty housing officials doubled up students in Crothers Hall
and Crothers Memorial Hall, and moved more students
into Escondido Village. This allotted 260 extra spaces for
students entering, significantly changing the "unstuffed"
statistics — if these spaces had not been created, at least
1,143 people would not have been assigned.

"These results are every bit as bad as the survey indi
cated they would be, and this unmet demand of more than
1,1(X) students, when you consider the stuffing, indicates
that the University has to start treating this as a more seri
ous situation," said physics doctoral student Robert Rud
nitsky, a member of the Graduate Student Council.
"Graduate students who lost the lottery are about to
be thrown into a housing market that many of them can't
really afford," he added.
The number of couples without children that were left
unassigned this year also rose dramatically, from 110 ap
plications denied to 158—ostensibly because each couple
denied allows two more single students to be housed.
In previous years, couples were guaranteed housing,
but when the housing demand began to rise a few years
ago, Housing Assignment Services switched to provide
singles and couples with the same percentage of housing
assignments, according to Alane Murdock, a doctoral stu
dent and a member of the student Graduate Housing Ad
visory Committee. This year, however, the number of
couples who would receive housing was capped at a max
imum of last year's number — 450 pairs. T his allowed the
percentage of assigned single students to rise.
"I think the numbers from this year clearly show that
the estimate of meeting 1 .(XX) new spaces is justified, and
perhaps even an underestimate," Murdock said.
After looking at the numbers, Murdock reiterated that
one of GH AC's demands is that the 260 spaces created in
Crothers and Escondido Village be "unstuffed."
"Just to meet demand in unstuffed spaces," Murdock
said, "They need to add at least 1,143 spaces, not includ
ing people who didn't apply."
