New president takes oath
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — An untested,
little-trusted successor took over yesterday in
Indonesia confronting the same problems that
drove former president Suharto from power after
32 years: angry students, powerful generals and an
economy on the brink of collapse.
As Suharto's vice president and protege,
Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie himself faced calls to
step down almost as soon as he took the oath of
office at the presidential palace — immediately
after a mournful, apologetic Suharto resigned
under growing public and international pressure.
Unappeased, the students who spearheaded
Indonesia's anti-Suharto drive occupied parliament
for a fifth straight day. Some swore to stay there
until an entirely new administration took power.
4 Designer' cows
WASHINGTON (AP) — Using cloning tech
niques similar to those that created the sheep
Dolly, researchers have produced six genetically
identical calves in an important step toward build
ing herds of "designer" cattle.
The research proves that it will be possible eco
nomically to produce cows that give human milk or
make drugs, or even to create pigs that grow human
organs, said Steve L. Stice, chief scientist at
Advanced Cell Technology Inc. in Worcester,
Mass.
A report on joint research by Stice and scientists
at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, is
being published today in the journal Science.
Could it be you?
PELL LAKE, Wis. (AP) — Somebody out
there came into the Lakeside Grocery and Deli in
this little town and bought a $195 million ticket to
the good life.
But who?
Only one ticket had the six winning numbers in
Wednesday night's Powerball drawing, and the lot
tery computers show it was sold at the grocery store
in this community of 1,300.
The odds of picking the winning numbers were
80.1 million-to-1.
