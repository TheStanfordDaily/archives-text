# Student opens fire at Oregon school
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, Ore. (AP) — In a rampage that
has become frighteningly familiar, a student expelled
for having a gun returned yesterday and allegedly
opened fire on a crowded school cafeteria, killing a
classmate and critically wounding eight others. Two
bodies were later found in his home.
Shots rang out about 8 a.m. in the Thurston High
School cafeteria, where up to 400 people were milling
around before class. Witnesses said the 15-year-old sus
pect. dressed in a cream-colored trench coat, ran
through the cafeteria firing his rifle from the hip.
"He was swiveling back and forth, firing at every
one," said 16-year-old Jonathan Crawford.
"He just mowed 'em down," said another student,
Michelle Calhoun. "It was just sort of happening in slow
motion."
Around the gunman, bullets shattered the huge
plate-glass windows and terrified students ran for cover
and dived under tables, but the boy remained strangely
calm as the staccato gunfire was reduced to the click,
click of empty chambers.
Finally, as he was trying to reload, wrestler Jake
Ryker, despite a gunshot wound to his belly, tackled the
boy, took his gun away and ended the terror.
After the boy was arrested, police said, they fol
lowed up on a suggestion from the boy to check his
house. There, they found the bodies of a man and a
woman. Sheriff Jan Clements refused to say how the
victims were related to the gunman, but broadcast
reports said they were the boy's parents.
"We spoke to him afterward — he was very calm,"
said police Capt. Jerry Smith. "His motive, what he was
thinking about, his motive, what caused him to do that
— we're a long way from there."
Police identified the suspect as Kipland P. Kinkel,
who had been arrested, expelled and released to his
parents' custody a day earlier on a charge of possession
of a stolen firearm. Police said he had been in trouble
before for throwing rocks at cars from a highway over
pass.
"He always said that it would be fun to kill someone
and do stuff like that," said student Robbie Johnson.
"Yesterday, he told a couple of people he was probably
going to do something stupid today and get back at the
people who had expelled him."
Some students said he once gave a talk in speech
class about how to build a bomb and in middle school

was voted "Most Likely to Start World War III."
Police said Kinkel parked a few blocks awav and
walked inside the cafeteria carrying a .22-caliber rifle, a
.22-caliber handgun and a Glock handgun.
Kinkel was arrested Wednesday after the school got
a tip that he was trying to buy a stolen weapon on cam
pus. He and another boy were arrested, expelled and
released to the custody of their parents, said Jamon
Kent, school superintendent.
"You don't make sense out of this. There is no sense
to it." said wrestling coach Gary Bowden. "I think we
ought to disarm. If this isn't a reason to. what is? I can
Hunk a kid and he can walk in and blow me away."
"Any kid who takes a gun to school — why he isn't
put under observation for a few weeks is beyond me."

District Attorney Doug Harcleroad said the boy
will be charged as an adult with murder. But because
of his age. he cannot be given the death penalty if con
victed.
The school of 1.350 students was shut down immedi
ately after the shooting. Parents, many of them weeping
and screaming, waited outside.
Of the 23 people injured. 1M were hit by gunfire and
the rest were hurt in the panic to flee the cafeteria.
Eight were hospitalized in critical condition, seven oth
ers in serious condition.
Springfield is a working-class town of 51.000 people
about 110 miles south of Portland.
It was the latest in a series of school shootings across
the countrv.
