## Editorial Eliminate subtle bias 
### 
More must be
wary of unconscious
bias in tenure process

YOU'VE SEEN the Daily arti
cles and heard about the
protests. But you're probably
not convinced that it matters. You
might think the fuss about women and
minority faculty is just a case of over
reaction to a couple of tenure denials.
But you would be wrong. A report
presented at last Thursday's Faculty
Senate meeting contained the usual
statistics â€” that women make up less
than 20 percent of tenured and
untenured faculty. But the scarier
statistic is that since 1980. the gender
ratio in hiring at the junior and senior
levels has been 3-to-7, female to male.
That means that two times as many
men as women have been hired during
the last 20 years.
The lack of female representation is
undeniably a problem. But the larger
concern is that this underrepresenta
tion will never change, given the cur
rent bias toward hiring and tenuring
men. That's why progress is slow in
changing the gender composition of
faculty.
Bias can come in subtle forms. One
study cited in the report showed that
given two identical papers, reviewers
gave the paper higher ratings if it was
labeled with a male author's name.
Another study reported that students
are more likely to rate female profes
sors on how much they care about stu
dents, rather than how effective they
are as teachers. These factors add up.

When a woman is evaluated for
tenure, the subtle bias that has fol
lowed her throughout her academic
career automatically enters into the
equation.
That's why it's not enough to
assume that female faculty are on a
level playing field with their col
leagues, once recruited. I~he situation
demands a solution. We cannot contin
ue to ignore the issue of female faculty
hiring and retention.
Factors such as unconscious bias can
be addressed by extra vigilance at all
levels. Tenure committees must exam
ine letters of recommendation for
hints of bias. To reinforce the impor
tance of the issue, the administration
can reward departments that succeed
in hiring and promoting women. Stu
dents themselves must realize that
they are also a part of the solution.
Next time you fill out an evaluation,
remember that what you say counts.
Are your ratings influenced in any way
by the fact that your professor is a man
or a woman?
Eliminating bias requires an effort
at all levels. Students, faculty and
administration must weed out negative
perceptions and stereotypes. Aware
ness is the first and most important
step to solving the problem.
Stanford compares about equally to
other elite institutions in the percent
age of women faculty. But that's no
excuse for inaction. The University
claims to care about diversity. We must
lead the nation in committing our
selves to creating an environment that
mentors and promotes female faculty.
Faculty must not let the issue die, and
students must realize the legitimacy of
the struggle.
