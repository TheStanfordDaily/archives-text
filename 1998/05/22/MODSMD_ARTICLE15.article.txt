## Responsibility for juvenile crime 
### 
THE TEXAS state
legislature will
debate a measure
next year that would
make 11-year-olds eligi
ble for the death penalty
if convieted of murder.
While it is important to

remain open-minded
about crime-fighting strategies, it seems
criminal to even suggest that 11-year-old
children should be executed for horrible
actions. Take a minute to think about what
handing out long-term and even final sen
tences to children entails.
In Texas a 14-year-old named Tim Dun
can stabbed and mutilated a 13-year-old girl.
The judge allowed him to be tried as an
adult, and he was given a 40-year sentence in
an adult prison. By sending youths to our
prisons, we, as a society, are giving up on our
children. While it is debatable whether reha
bilitation can work for most adult criminals,
children are still impressionable enough for
such efforts to succeed. What are the odds of
Duncan being more suitable for life amid
the rest of our society after being caged with
criminals for 40 years?
Think about what it would be like to be
held accountable for the worst decision you
made at the age of 11 for the rest of your life.
Granted, the decisions we make during this
time shape a great deal of our future as we
grow into adulthood. Yet, during this

growth process we make mistakes from
which we have a chance to learn and change
our behavior. How can any child recover
from a mistake when the punishment will
last for 40 years?
Before lowering the age at which juve
niles can be tried as adults, we must remem
ber why the distinction between adults and
juveniles exists at all. All children deserve
the chance to learn from their mistakes.
Inconceivably heinous crimes, such as the
shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., seem to have
blinded us to this. The amount of evil asso
ciated with a crime does not change the age
of the perpetrator and does not make the
perpetrator more of an adult than one of his
peers. Putting these kids away and turning
our backs is the easy way out. Turning of our
backs is what leads to these crimes in the
first place.
Another reason the juvenile status exists
is that children are not fully responsible for
their actions. We do not entrust even the
most qualified juveniles to live on their own
and face ultimate responsibility for their
decisions. Why should juveniles who com
mit crimes face the adult consequences of
their actions?
Who is ultimately responsible for juve
nile crime? The answer is a mixture of the
youth offenders themselves, their parents
and our society. However, trying to carve
though this blend with legislation is futile.
Preventative programs are a start to curbing

juvenile violent erime. However, no pro
gram can make up for parental involvement,
a quality school that is fun to go to or an
immediate group of people who care about
and love the child. How far will we have to
inch down the age at which juvenile status
ends before someone will take the remain
der of responsibility for these crimes?
Is there such a thing as an incorrigible
child? Perhaps therapy exists to allow every
person in our society to function within the
limits of our laws. However, there is only so
much the average or even above-average
parent can do. This is why laws that punish
parents for their children's crimes are unjust.
The variant standard "I've done everything
1 could" by parents is too difficult to deter
mine with any type of consistency.
Do not let the horrible escalation of high
profile juvenile offenses mask the basic
rights and services that should be extended
to all children. Do not let mistakes made by
children, however severe, ruin the remain
der of their lives. Before supporting any
measure to lower the age at which juveniles
can be tried as adults, ask yourself what fun
damentally has changed about children
except the society and families they live in.
Do not let children take the fall for missing
the guidance and protection our society says
they are entitled to.
