Grad housing crisis impacts
undergraduate education

Last Friday's Rastux comic in The
Daily implied that graduate students have
been "whining" about the lack of on-cam
pus housing, seeming to indicate that
undergraduates should not be concerned
with the issue of graduate housing.
However, recent information shows
that undergrads will be affected.
Complaints about housing prompted
the ASSU and the Graduate Student
Council to establish a task force on gradu
ate housing, whose work culminated in a
survey-based report that can be found on
the World Wide Web at http://www.stan
ford.edu/group/assu/grad/housing/report.
html.
The results of this report point to a seri
ous problem for Stanford as a whole,
including undergraduate students.
Poor housing of graduate students
leads to a poor undergraduate education,
as it makes Stanford less attractive to
quality students who work as teaching
assistants.
The shortage in graduate housing also

forces current TAs to spend more time
searching for homes, working part-time
jobs and commuting.
As a graduate student in the Math
ematics Department, I have come into
contact with prospective graduate stu
dents who are actively recruited by the
department.
All of those I have met have at some
point asked about quality and availability
of housing, and I have been honest.
The off-campus situation is absurd and
getting worse. In the last three years, rents
in the Palo Alto area have risen 33 percent
and 20 percent in the last year.
The result has been a huge demand for
comparatively reasonable on-campus
housing.
Last year, over K(X) students were
denied on-campus housing in the lottery,
and this year it is projected that roughly 35
to 45 percent of all continuing single grad
uate students and couples who applied for
housing will be rejected.
Also, on-campus rents are to be
increased next year by an average of 6.2
percent.
Since many of these prospective stu
dents were considering other schools with
similar academic reputations, such as

Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton and the
University of Chicago, the convenience of
housing arrangements could he a deciding
factor.
Indeed, the housing report shows that
it would require $30,0(H) for a student liv
ing in Palo Alto to match the standard of
living of a student in Princeton receiving a
$17,000 per year stipend.
I really enjoy working in the Math
ematics Department here. We have many
excellent professors and a great program
of research colloquia.
Graduate students, however, should
not he forced to take on extra debt or
part-time jobs to continue their studies.
I wish I could tell prospective students
that this is the best environment in which
to pursue a graduate mathematics pro
gram, but I can't because 1 don't believe
that anymore.
The only reason I don't feel it's the best
is because of money, and I think that is a
shame.
I suspect that similar conversations
have taken place in other departments. In
fact, comments from the housing report
show that many graduate students are
advising prospectives and friends not to
come.

As this graduate housing crisis contin
ues. it will steadily become more difficult
for Stanford to attract good graduate TAs
and prevent attrition of those already
enrolled.
In addition, as TAs are forced to live
farther from campus due to the ridiculous
housing market, they become much less
available to their students.
The distance from campus and the time
and effort involved in commuting result in
fewer nighttime office hours, review ses
sions. and less time devoted to section and
lecture preparation.
The frustration with this whole situa
tion has even discouraged some TAs from
trying to be good teachers.
To solve this problem, the University
must find a way to make good housing
available to a larger percentage of its
graduate students.
. My advice: build more housing, pro
vide substantial financial assistance to stu
dents who don't get on-campus housing,
or reduce the graduate population by
admitting fewer students.
A solution that allows Stanford to
maintain its high reputation will probably
require that money to be spent on
improvements to graduate housing.

This is not a problem that should be
handled by Housing and Dining Services;
it is a University crisis which demands
attention from the top.
