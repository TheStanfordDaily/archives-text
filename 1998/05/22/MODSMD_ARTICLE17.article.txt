## Unfair entry denial of chef's French wife 
### 
Jocelyn Wiener

£ HE WAS RUDE and vulgar, and
was chewing gum so that my
wife could not understand what she
said. She grabbed my wife's bag and turned
it upside-down. She saw that she had nice
perfume, and she tix>k the perfume and
sprayed it on herself like this."
Philippe Gion, the EAST House chef de
cuisine, spritzes imaginary perfume on his
neck. He is describing the actions of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service offi
cer who threw his wife Marie-Pierre Desaire
out of the country on Feb. 19.
" 'Why do you have so many stamps (on
your passport)?' she asked my wife. Then
she locked her in a room for three hours,
treating her like a criminal, taking finger
prints and a mugshot. My wife thought she
was going to be sent to jail."
Philippe leans toward me as we sit on the
patio of the East Asian Studies Theme
house. His voice is notably more intense than
the smiling "you-like-my-erabcakes?"
demeanor he maintains with the students
who float through his aromatic kitchen. My

ears slowly acclimate to the nasal melody of
his strong French accent.
"You know why 1 asked if we could sit
outside?" he asks. With gusto, he pulls out a
pack of cigarettes. "So I can smoke," he pro
nounces. After a second's contemplation, he
adds, "if you don't mind."
Philippe has been a legal resident of the
United States for slightly over 10 years. His
wife, Marie, is a painter who he met in
France in 1993 and married when she came
to the United States on a six-month tourist
visa last year. The visa, which is valid for up
to 10 years, was issued by the U.S. Embassy.
Philippe claims that she has been victimized
by recent changes in immigration law.
According to Philippe, the law now gives
INS officers the full power to deport, without
trial, any foreigner they perceive as intending
to live here illegally.
"If they don't like your face," he says,
"they can reject you."
Perhaps the law to which he refers is the
1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi
grant Responsibility Act. Ensconced in the

daunting pages of text is a provision legaliz
ing the existing deportation practice of
"expedited removal." Rather than refer all
cases of perceived inadmissibility to an immi
gration judge, trained INS officers can sim
ply turn an immigrant around and send her
home. But since Marie had a tourist visa,
there must be something more.
Philippe believes the cause for deporta
tion was the large number of U.S. / France
stamps on her passport. This, with the sale of
some paintings and a U.S. bank account,
seemed to indicate to the INS officer that
Marie must be living in this country. In fact,
Marie never stayed here longer than the six
month limit, flying back to France to visit her
young son every few months.
Nonetheless, after an eight-hour flight
from Paris to Chicago, Marie was detained at
the airport for three hours. Then, with a
police officer seated on either side of her, she
was escorted to a France-bound plane. "Like
a criminal," says Philippe. "They wouldn't
even let her get on with the regular passen
gers, and she had to pay for her return tick

et." When she arrived in France, she had
nothing with her. She called Philippe, crying.
He had been waiting at their home, with
wine and flowers.
"I am in the process of sueing the INS for
harassment," says Philippe, nodding his
white hair angrily. Fie said his wife is well
educated, never did anything unlawful in the
United States, and has never stayed past her
allotted time. And yet she was denied entry
at the whim of "this rude and aggressive
woman." Uneducated people who wield
power are a dangerous combination, he said.
These adjectives are not quite parallel to
those used by the INS to describe their immi
gration officers. Rather than "rude" or
"agressive," they opt for "specially trained"
and "quality assuring."
Western Europeans are not the most dis
enfranchised immigrant group in this coun
try. If an INS agent feels comfortable grab
bing and emptying the purse of a French
woman who owns a 16th-century chateau,
one needn't think too hard to predict the
plight of a p<x>r Haitian. Cambodian. Puerto

Kican or Mexican.
In a cynical sense, maybe this law is fairer.
Now no one can count on being guaranteed
a trial to defend his or her right to stay in the
country. Maybe liberty is now blind to the
alluring shades of skin color and money.
Philippe doesn't think so. Even if the pro
cess were "•fairer." it doesn't seem that way
when it happens to your wife.
So why does Philippe choose to stay?
His wife will be unable to return for at
least a year, and then only if he is granted
citizenship.
"A very good question." he smiles ironi
cally. I enjoy working for the students very
much. They are open-minded.
"1 was in the process of leaving, but 1 will
be back in September. After all. I am legal. I
pay my taxes. I deserve the opportunities
that this country has to offer.
"They cannot treat everybody as a num
ber." he mutters, shaking his head. "They
break a couple's life."
