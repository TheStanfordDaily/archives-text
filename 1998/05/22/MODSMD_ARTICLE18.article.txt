# DGs undergoing evaluation
## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
. Delta Gamma, the oldest soror
ity on campus, is currently under
going an evaluative process to de
termine whether their chapter will
continue next year.
The DGs, who have been on
campus since 1897. have a lower
number of members now that at
any time in their recent history. At
present, there are 28 members, al
though some of these women will
graduate this spring.
The National Delta Gamma Or
ganization initiated the evaluative
process. The organization evalu
ates all of its national chapters on a
routine basis.
In efforts to determine whether
the goals of DG are being met at
Stanford, the national organization
is asking all Stanford DG alumni
and present members to give their
input on the state of the chapter.
"We anticipate that if a woman
becomes a Delta Gamma then they
have the chance to grow and devel
op personally." said DG National
Executive Director Maggie
Watkins. "We're looking to see
what kinds of contributions Delta
Gamma is making to the Stanford
community."
The evaluation is occurring over

a 60-day period. The national orga
nization is monitoring information
on the number of members, finan
cial status of the chapter, the types
of programming and campus visi
bility.
Watkins said the positive bene
fits that DG brings to the Stanford
community concern her most.
"We think of our programming
as an adjunct to the educational
opportunities of the university,"
Watkins said.
"Even though the chapter is
small, we are strong and stable,"
said DG President Kalee Magnani,
a junior. "With a larger chapter we
could probably be more active on
campus, but we've formed really
close friendships because we're
small."
Magnani is encouraging all DG
alumnae and members to write let
ters to the DG National Council
outlining why the chapter is impor
tant to Stanford and to them per
sonally.
"We were the first sorority to be
recognized at Stanford, and since
then we've been active on this cam
pus," Magnani said. "The main
issue is that our numbers have
been continually low over the past
several years."
This spring, the DGs did ac
quire several members through in

formal Rush, although no one
pledged following the formal Rush
process. The chapter has decided
not to initiate any new members
because they will not know
whether they have a charter for
next year until late June.
In June, Magnani will travel to
the National Delta Gamma Con
vention in order to represent the
chapter and discuss the status of
the Stanford DGs with the Nation
al Council. The convention is a
gathering of thousands of DGs â€”
all current chapter presidents and
any members are invited to partic
ipate.
Magnani is hopeful that they
will be able to continue on campus.
The University has no role in
the decision to maintain the DGs.
The loss of the charter would be
the responsibility of the national
organization, not the University.
The University only requires
that the sorority maintains six
members in order to remain a stu
dent group on campus.
"The national board needs to
make sure that all of us are having
a meaningful experience," Mag
nani said.
"My goal has been to have a fun
spring quarter, though, and not
focus on the negative aspects of
this process."
