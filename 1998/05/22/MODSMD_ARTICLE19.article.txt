# Pager service disrupted
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Did your pager stop working
earlier this week?
It was probahlv due to a space
satellite moving out of position —
a small incident that affected mil
lions of people across the nation.
Early Tuesday evening, a satel
lite owned by PanAmSat of Con
necticut rolled out of its track, and
between SO to 90 percent of the na
tion's 45 million pager customers
lost service.
The Stanford campus was af
fected as well. Students, faculty
and staff couldn't use pagers, pump
gas from gas pumps that take cred
it cards, or receive television and
radio broadcasts.
"For basically a day I was total
ly out of touch with everyone," said

Ryan Medders. a senior who uses
his pager to help him run SCBN's
news program.
"Because of my show, my re
porters and technical managers
need to be able to get a hold of me
quickly if they need to access
equipment or the studio," Medders
said. "People paged me, and I
didn't get the messages."
At the Medical Center, prob
lems were less intense than at other
hospitals across the country. Ac
cording to Kent Safford, a public
relations representative at the cen
ter, there were very few problems
because the hospital operates on a
local paging system based on
phone lines instead of the national,
satellite-based system.
"We had to pass out about 50
local pagers for those on long-dis
tance service," Safford said.

Safford explained that in gener
al, when there is a pager service
problem, people with long-dis
tance pagers will call the hospital
operator, leave a page on the sys
tem, and it gets passed on through
the normal, local channels.
Lost pager service also affected
hospital patients waiting for trans
plants — patients carry pagers in
order to he notified as quickly as
possible when an organ becomes
available. Many patients nationally
were forced to wait at home by the
phone.
At the Medical Center, howev
er, transplant patients use local
pagers on the same system as the
rest of the hospital, and therefore
did not lose service. Safford added
that even if the local system failed,
a backup telephone system is al
ready in place.
