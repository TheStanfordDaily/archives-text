## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Over 2(X) undergraduates will
be unhoused next year, according
to Housing Assignment Services
Manager Kathleen Bransfield.
Cutoff numbers for on-campus
houses were posted for a brief pe
riod last night on the World Wide
Web. allowing access by a number
of students before they were re
moved by Bransfield's office.
This year, 234 students went un
housed in the Draw, according to
Bransfield. a slight increase over
last year's figure of 231. These stu

dents will he forced to attempt for
walk-in housing in the fall or look
for off-campus housing.
Although the individual cutoff
numbers for each of the houses
were not confirmed by Housing
Assignment Services, the number
of students unassigned was.
The official results for each
house will be posted on the Webby
3 p.m. today, according to Brans
field.
Several dormitories viewed the
Web site while it was up yesterday
evening. However. Bransfield said
that the cutoff numbers were sub
ject to change.

"That site should have been
password protected," Bransfied
said. "I'm not sure exactly how
that site was made public, but it
should not have been."
According to the unconfirmed
individual house numbers, prefer
ences shifted significantly, espe
cially in houses that are scheduled
to be renovated as part of the Cap
ital Improvement Plan.
As in past years, houses on the
lower Row drew the best. For men
and women. Bob received the
highest Draw.
Xanadu was the second most
demanded dorm.
Among the other houses that
drew well were 557 Mavfield, 553
Mayfield and Storey House.
Several houses demonstrated a
marked change in the numbers
that drew into them. Among those
houses with the most changes in
preferences were houses in the
Cowell cluster, such as ZAP and
Whitman.
These two houses drew around
500 to 600 for both men and
women. Last year, however, these
two houses averaged near 1.900
for both men and women. Both

houses will be renovated this sum
mer.
The houses which drew the
worst were fairly consistent with
last year's results. For men. the
worst were Serra. Mirlo. Arroyo,
Okada and Adams. For women,
the worst houses were Mirlo,
Serra. Arroyo, Okada and Tran
cos.
The spring housing lottery,
which always creates a great
amount of excitement on campus,
left some ecstatic about their as
signments. Others were glad just to
receive housing.
Sophomore Jeff Clarke, who
had a Draw number of 2.764. was
part of the last male Draw group to
receive housing for next year, ac
cording to last night's numbers.

"I'm just glad not to be living in
uncertainty any more," Clarke
said, "it's nice to know that I'll be
somewhere."
This year's Draw celebrations
are bound to be different from past
years, since students knew which
numbers they were assigned be
fore the Draw.
Students had a general idea
about which houses would be prac
tical for them to list on their pref
erences.
"The Draw was less exciting
this year," said Junior Laura
Drum, who had access to the num
bers during their brief stint on the
Web, "but it was also more fair be
cause you could more reasonably
estimate where you would be able
to live."
