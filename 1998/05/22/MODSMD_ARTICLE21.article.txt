# Profs debate tenure process
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Five professors yesterday urged students to contin
ue debating the tenure system during a panel discus
sion sponsored by the Women's Coalition.
Three tenured professors and two assistant profes
sors argued the various aspects of the tenure process
before a group of about 25 students and community
members. They agreed that the system is imperfect but
came to no consensus on recommendations.
Instead, the panel encouraged students to stay in
volved and to continue to openly debate the process it
self and specific cases with which they disagree.
Tenure "determines who's going to teach you,"
Assoc. History Prof. Mary Lou Roberts pointed out.
"Some of the best and most beloved teachers right now
are getting turned down."
Among those cases are now-Assoc. Anthropology
Prof. Akhil Gupta and Asst. History Prof. Karen Saw
islak, both of whom students have actively fought lor.
Gupta received tenure on appeal last June; Sawislak,
who sat on the panel, is currently undergoing the ap
peals process.
Assoc. Comparative Literature Prof. David Palum
bo-Liu warned students that they must be informed
about the tenure process in order to have their opin
ions carry weight. He also suggested networking
among students both inside and outside Stanford and
meeting with administrators and department chairs to
voice their concerns.
Such actions can help to a certain extent, the pro
fessors said, but bias still pervades the process.
"Bias continues — often silent — when it's no
longer tolerated on a visual level," Roberts said.
"That's the way 1 think bias often works at Stanford."
Other factors that make it difficult for women and
minorities to earn tenure include the innovative and
sometimes controversial nature of their research, the
lack of a support network and their tendency to be
more in demand as advisers and mentors. Roberts said.
"Just as women are often undervalued in society,
women's history is often undervalued," she said,
adding that as a result, it is difficult to get a consensus

on the value of a female professor's research in refer
ence letters.
Such bias, often unconscious, can he reversed with
some effort on the part of the University, Palumbo-Liu
said.
Several years ago, a study of California universities
showed they were admitting Asian Americans at a rate
inconsistent with those students' grades and test
scores, he said. When Stanford recognized its bias in
doing this, admission rates increased dramatically.
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Alice Bach — whose
tenure was denied earlier this year by the deans of the
School of Humanities and Sciences — called for affir
mative action at the time of tenure, calling Provost
Condoleezza Rice's adamant refusal to do that mis
guided.
Bach cited Rice's argument that affirmative action
would undermine the legitimacy of women and minor
ity professors and said the policy is often portrayed "as
women and men of color getting something they don't
deserve.
"Any woman or minority I know works just as hard
as the old guard," she said.
Professors also discussed the disruption that a
tenure denial can create in the life of someone who has
established a life at a certain university, often after he
or she was assured tenure was likely.
But that disruption is hard to avoid. Education Prof.
John Baugh said. "It is the fact that it takes place in a
human and political context and that there is overt and
cover bias." he said, "that makes it very difficult for a
junior faculty to predict what's going to happen."
Some uncertainties can't be changed, but Stanford
could do significantly better, Sawislak said, who noted
that the number of women in the History Department
has remained constant at six since she arrived in 1990,
while the number of men has increased from 28 to 34.
"One of the great things about being at Stanford is
the diversity of the classroom," said Sawislak, whose
appeal is being examined by the Academic Council's
Advisory Board. "It's so skewed what our student
body looks like and what our faculty looks like. It's a
... problem that 1 think the administration needs to
take much more seriously."
