Distinguished faculty and stu
dent advisers received the annual
Undergraduate Advising Center's
Outstanding Adviser Awards yes
terday.
Lori White, the center's direc
tor, called all of this year's award
winning advising staff members
"obviously fantastic," recognizing
the amount of time that they volun
teered.
The five Outstanding Advising
Associate awards — based on let
ter responses from advisees —
went to juniors Douglas Mooney,
Stephanie Blossom, Stephen Alli
son and Jonathan Weil, and sopho
more Corey Griffin.
Mooney, an AA in Kimball
Hall, said the award came as a sur
prise for him.
"I'm really appreciative of my
advisees," he said. "They're a great
bunch for taking the time to nomi
nate me."
Mooney said he enjoyed the in
formal advising meetings through
out the year with his eight fresh
man advisees. They had all indicat
ed interest in the social sciences at
the beginning of the year, and as

the academic year draws to an end.
some have come to Mooney asking
him about specific majors.
"For most of them, (this year
was about) exploring academics
here," he said. "I was just helping
them decide classes and encourag
ing them that there's no hurry."
Griffin said the best part about
his year as a Larkin A A was getting
to know his advisees.
"I really wanted to spend a lot of
time with them," he said.
"If there's one thing that I would
want to change about my freshman
year, it would be my advising expe
rience. 1 didn't want to be just an
other upperclassman to them. I
wanted to make it better for (my
advisees)."
His advisees, who were present
at the awards ceremony, said they
couldn't have had a better AA for
their freshman year.
"He's super." said Murtaza Al
imohamed, who is considering
human biology as a major after ex
ploring options this year. "He's al
ways around, bringing us goodies
and coming to dinners."
Fellow advisee freshman Abby
Baca, who may follow in Griffin's
footsteps and become a civil engi
neering major, agreed.

"We actually have gotten to
know him," she said. "He comes to
visit us all the time and takes us out
to ice cream during midterms."
The Henry Tien Memorial
Award was founded in honor of a
former head A A who died two
years ago in an accident at
Yosemite National Park. It recog
nizes a single head A A out of 25
and went to coterminal student
Rahul Young.
"It really means a lot to me that
people in the dorm took the time to
write a letter for me," said Young,
the head AA for Larkin. "I'm
proud of the award, but really, it's
an award for the entire staff."
Young added that the resident as
sistants and the AAs in the dormi
tory had agreed to work closely to
gether to cut down the boundaries
between the responsibilities of the
two positions at the beginning of
the year.
" That freed me up a lot to do my
job," he said.
The ceremony also honored the
departments of Earth Systems,
History, and Comparative Litera
ture for outstanding departmental
advising, as well as individual ad
visers who have served for at least
five, 10 or 20 years.
