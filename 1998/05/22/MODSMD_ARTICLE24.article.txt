### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
Continuing its winning ways
shouldn't be too difficult for the
Stanford men's tennis team.
As junior Ryan Wolters put it.
"Looking at Stanford's NCAA
record, if you stay for four years,
you're guaranteed to win at least one
championship."

MEN'S TENNIS
■ Tomorrow: NCAA Champi
onships First Round — No. 1 Stan
ford (24-0) vs. Minnesota (14-12).

En route to that next win, the No.
1 Cardinal opens play tomorrow in
the NCAA Championships in
Athens, Ga.. against No. 50 Min
nesota.
A win in the finals at the tourna
ment would be the fourth-straight for
the Cardinal (24-0), giving Stanford
seniors Paul Goldstein and Charles
Hoeveler four championships in four
years on the Farm. It also would
make Stanford the sole holder of the
most NCAA titles.
Stanford is currently tied with
use and UCLA at 15 titles each.

The next teams are William and
Mary and Georgia, tied at two each.
However, it is only in recent years
that Stanford has dominated the col
lege tennis world — all 15 titles have
come in the last 25 years, and all have
come under the direction of head
coach Dick Gould.
Gould, the Cardinal coach for 32
years, has an impressive 636-124
record overall (.837) and has led this
year's team to another undefeated
season.
An NCAA tournament win looks
promising for the Cardinal, which
captured the Pacific 10 Conference
championship earlier this month.
Gould was named Pac-10 Coach
of the Year, while Goldstein was Pac
-10 Player of the Year. Sophomores
Bob and Mike Bryan, along with
Wolters and Goldstein, were first
team All Pac-10, while sophomore
Geoff Abrams and freshman Alex
Kim earned honorable mentions.
In addition. Goldstein was named
IT A Player of the Month in singles
for April, and the Bryans were the
ITA Players of the Month in doubles
for April.

Senior Paul Goldstein slams one back against California in Febru
ary. The Cardinal starts work on its fourth-straight NCAA title today
in Athens, Ga.
Gould said these awards give the
team a boost heading into the tour
nament in Georgia.
"These are all nice little things,"
Gould said. "We're all proud."
Stanford has been first in the
rankings all year, with all six of the
starting lineup players ranked in the
top 1(X).
Stanford also defeated the cur
rent No. 2 team, Louisiana State, 7-0
earlier this year at the National Team
Indoor Championships.
Stanford is the top seed in the
NCAA tournament, followed by
LSU, Georgia and Mississippi.
However, Stanford won't have to
face any of these teams until at least
the semifinals. In the first round, the
Cardinal will take on Minnesota, the
champions from the Midwest Re
gional.
The Golden Gophers (14-12),

ranked No. 50 in the most recent
polls, beat top seeds Notre Dame,
Northwestern and Duke in the re
gional tournament.
However, if any team wants to
beat Stanford, it will have to be in top
form. With the exception of a small
tonsillitis / strep throat scare for
Mike Bryan, all of Stanford's players
have been healthy.
With interchangeable top players
in the lineup, Gould has decided to
play Goldstein at first singles, Mike
Bryan at second. Bob Bryan at third
and Wolters at the No. 4 spot.
Abrams will play at No. 5, and Kim
will round out the lineup at No. 6.
In doubles, the Bryans have the
top spot, Goldstein and Wolters will
play second doubles, and Abrams
and Hoeveler will play at No. 3.
"The amazing thing is that we're
all playing better than we were in
February when we beat LSU,"
Wolters said. "For a team to beat us,
they're going to have to come up
with something unbelievable."
