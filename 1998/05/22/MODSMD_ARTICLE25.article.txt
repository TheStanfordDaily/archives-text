"We have not played [Wake Forest] this year,"
head coach Frank Brennan said. "But we have
played them in the past, and they are a well-coached
and disciplined team. It should be tight between us,
and this week, there will be no easy matches."

pended after the singles sweep.
"I am pleased with the way our team played."
Brennan said. "The preparation for these matches

earlier this season, and they came out with the same
matchups we had then. Our team capitalized on it."
