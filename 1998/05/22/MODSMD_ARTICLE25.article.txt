### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The defending champion Stanford women's ten
nis team took the first step toward defending its na
tional crown by making a clean sweep of No. 16 Ten
nessee 6-0 in the opening round of the NCAA
Championships at Notre Dame yesterday.
The No. 2 Cardinal moves on at noon today to
face No. 13 Wake Forest (18-8). who edged No. 7
Brigham Young 5-4 yesterday to advance to the
quarterfinals.
The victory was the sixth straight for the Cardi
nal. which has yet to lose in 17 first-round matches in
the NCA As.
In fact, the odds are against the Demon Deacons
upsetting the Cardinal in the second round as well,
as Stanford is 16-0 in the second round in its NCAA
tournament history.

"We have not played [Wake Forest] this year,"
head coach Frank Brennan said. "But we have
played them in the past, and they are a well-coached
and disciplined team. It should be tight between us,
and this week, there will be no easy matches."
Yesterday, though, the Lady Vols were no match
for the second-seeded Cardinal, who took all six sin
gles matches in straight sets. Doubles play was sus
pended after the singles sweep.
"I am pleased with the way our team played."
Brennan said. "The preparation for these matches
was just stellar for our team leading up to the tour
nament. We had the fortune of playing Tennessee
earlier this season, and they came out with the same
matchups we had then. Our team capitalized on it."
