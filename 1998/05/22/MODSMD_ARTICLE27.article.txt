# Stanford hosts track Pac-10s
## 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
As this weekend's Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships draw closer,
anticipation of some of the greatest
track-and-field competition to grace
Stanford soil continues to mount.
The nine-team rumble for the
top should be very close through
out the star-studded two-day com
petition.
Aside from Oregon State, which
does not support a track-and-field
program, every Pac-10 team will be
a factor in the meet.

TRACK AND FIELD
■ Tomorrow-Sunday: Stanford
hosts the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Cobb Track and
Angell Field. Field events begin at 1
p.m.: track events begin at 3 p.m.

Among national leaders to per
form on the men's side are Stanford
sophomore Brad Hauser in the
10,000 meters, UCLA's Mebrotam
Keflezghi (S.(XX)), Arizona's Patrick
Nduwimana (8(X)). Arizona State's
Mike Laiho (hammer) and Wash
ington State's lan Waltz (discus).
For the women. USC's Torri Ed
wards (100) and Granyza Penc
(1,500) and Washington's Aretha
Hill (discus) are national leaders
participating in their keystone
events.
The Cardinal women's and men's
squads will have their work cut out
for them as they go head-to-head
with these and other formidable op
ponents in hopes of improving on
last year's performances.
Last year. Stanford's women
placed third with 110 points, a
record amount for their squad. The
Cardinal men tied for sixth with 86
points, although they were less than
10 points away from a fourth-place
finish.
USC's men and UCLA's women
are the defending champions.
Stanford women participating in
the meet include freshman Sally
Glvnn in the 1.50(3. freshman Julia

Stamps (3.(XK) and S,(XX)), sopho
more Summer Pierson (discus), ju
nior Tracye Lawyer (high jump) and
freshman Melissa Feinstein in the
pole vault, among many others.
Participants for the Stanford
men's squad include sophomore
Michael Stember and freshman Jo
nathon Riley in the 1,500, twin
sophomores Brad and Brent Hauser
(5.000), junior Adam Connoly and
senior Justin Strand (hammer),
freshman Todd Beyerlein (high
jump) and sophomore Toby Steven
son in the pole vault.
This year, head coach Vin Lanan
na believes the titles are open for the
taking by any of the top teams.
"On the women's side, lICLA is
favored, but after that, it's anyone's
game," Lananna said.
For the men, Lananna considers
UCLA and USC as the favorites,
but Arizona, Oregon, Washington
State or Stanford could be a spoiler.
For Stanford seniors, the Pac-10
meet will also take on an emotional
tone, as it is their final home compe
tition.
Senior Monal Chokshi, who has
been a huge factor in the Cardinal
distance program, will run the 3,(XX)
meters in her final home perfor
mance.
"It's going to be a lot of fun. with
all of the friends and relatives com
ing to watch our last home meet,"
Chokshi said. "I'm really excited to
go out there and see what we can
do with the home-crowd advan
tage."
The very fact that the meet is ex
pected to be so competitive for the
Cardinal speaks to the determina
tion of the senior class, according to
Lananna.
The seniors "have battled from
the basement of the conference to
where they are today," he said. "It's
a tribute to where they have set the
standard."
Other Cardinal seniors bidding
farewell at Pac-lOs will be Heather
Miller (200), Sara Moore (1,500),
Kortney Dunscombe (5,000 and
lO.(XX)), Bernadette Armand (100

hurdles), Katrinka Jackson (shot
put and high jump) and Sami Jo
Small (javelin).
The men competing at Stanford
for the final time include Jason Lunn
(800), Mike Prindiville (I,soo),Greg
Jimmerson (5,000, 1 (),()()() and
steeplechase). J.J. White (5,000),

Jason Perscheid (5,000 and K).(KK))
and Justin Strand (hammer).
The Pac-10 Championship meet
begins tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Stan
ford's Cobb Track and Angell Field
with all preliminaries and some fi
nals. All other finals will be complet
ed Sunday.
