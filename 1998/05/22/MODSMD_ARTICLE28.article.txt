# Another first
## Three on softball named All Americans 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Stanford softball added another
accomplishment to its season-long
string of first-time achievements this
week when three Cardinal players
earned the program's first All-
American honors.
Juniors Becky Blevins, Michele
Acosta and Marcy Crouch were se
lected Wednesday as third-team
Louisville Slugger NFCA-NCAA
Division I All Americans.
"I just feel really blessed to be on
this team," Acosta said. "It shows
that the program is on its way to be
coming a national contender."
All three were selected to the
All-Pacific Region team earlier this
season and were therefore eligible
for All-American honors. Blevins
was also an All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence first-teamer, while Crouch and
Acosta earned second team honors.
A pitcher from Lake Havasu,
Ariz., Blevins ranked fourth in the
conference this season with a 1.24
ERA. The junior recorded 24 wins

and nine shutouts, while striking out
162 batters on the season.
Blevins holds the only two no
hitters in Stanford softball history —
the most recent coming this season
against Harvard — and is the only
Cardinal pitcher to record more
than 4(X) strikeouts in her career.
Acosta, who was also named to
the NCAA Regional All-Tourna
ment team last weekend in Stillwa
ter, Okla., led this year's squad in
hitting with a .331 batting average,
60 hits, a single-season record 37
RBI and three home runs. The right
fielder from Tucson, Ariz., is first on
the career list for RBIs with 81.
Crouch, a designated player and
pitcher from Huntington Beach,
Calif., was also selected to the All-
Regional team last weekend. Her
.307 batting average was second
only to Acosta.
Crouch tied the single-season
record for doubles with 13, a mark
that ranked her sixth in the confer
ence. She also recorded 55 hits,
scored 28 runs and knocked in 34
RBIs this season.
