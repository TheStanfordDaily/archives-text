# The 						suit guy to take Daily helm
## 
### Managerius editoriae Editorial staff 
For the first time since the Carter
administration. The Daily will have
a New Yorker with a muddled
British accent dressed in a suit as its
editor in chief.
A classics major, Adam Ke
me/.is, like Odysseus before him,
has traveled widely in Daily circles.
Having relaxed his pace this vol
ume after having served as manag
ing editor for news during Volume
212, Kemezis' journey to becoming
editor in chief has been an exciting
and fulfilling one.
"Those sirens on the shores of
Lake Lagunita kept urging me to
come back to The Daily," Kemezis
said.
Kemezis expressed joy with the
outcome of the election, which he
decidedly won with 75 votes. He
gave much credit to his strong fami
ly lineage.
"My father Ux)ks astoundingly
like Trotsky in photos," Kemezis
said.
He also gave a substantial
amount of credit to his wardrobe of
suits, hats and cowboy boots.
In this tradition, the first item on
his agenda is to install a
suit / hat / boots dress code at The

Daily, adding, "You all kx)k like a
hunch of slobs."
Kemezis also vowed to allow no
vegetables into The Daily office.
Sausage, pepperoni pizza, pork
chops, fried potatoes and black cof
fee will be staples for Daily events,
Kemezis promised. Daily vegetari
ans expressed disappointment.
"I live for those baby carrots,"
said Managing Editor Elise Lip
kowitz.
He also promised to ban wine
coolers as they are "sissy drinks."
"Nothing but whiskey, scotch
and MOD," Kemezis said with a
maniacal laugh.
Kemezis campaigned on "get
ting back to basics." For Daily
staffers, this means solid colors,
none of "them fancy picture
things," paper strewn all over the
news office and more country- music
reviews in Intermission. "Tammy
Wynette is one of America's unsung
heroes," he said.
Kemezis will also give The Daily
a bit of an ancient twist by running
Diversions stories written in Latin
and Greek and giving occasional
orations at lunchtime in White
Plaza.
"1 won't go for interviews at
SCBN. That is a bit too 20th centu
ry, for my tastes," he claimed.

Odysseus-wanna-be Adam Kemezis, a.k.a. The Suit Guy, cele
brates his victory as The Daily's Volume 214 editor in chief. Ironi
cally enough, Kemezis has considered doing away with the horo
scopes. See Cancer, page 11.
