In the most competitive year for
Stanford's undergraduate admissions
process, 64 percent of students admit
ted have chosen to accept their offers.
Only 13 percent of a record 18.888
applicants were offered a spot in the
Class of 2002, the lowest acceptance
rate in Stanford history.
The incoming freshman class in
cludes 611 students admitted through
the Early Decision program.
The percentage of students accept
ing places in next year's freshman class
was only slightly higher than last year,
but the total number of 1,6(X) is about
80 less than the 1997 amount.
"We're still doing very well," said
Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid Robert Kinnallv. "Yield is good.
This puts us in perfect position."
Last year, about 60 more students
accepted admissions offers than were
expected to, contributing to shortages
in upperclass housing on campus.
"Given the current housing situa
tion. we wanted to make sure we
didn't over-enroll this year," Kin
nallv said.

"We won't add to the shortage of
housing for returning undergraduates
who have guaranteed years remain
ing," Kinnally said. "Space is a very big
issue."
After all responses to admissions
offers were in. however, "we didn't hit
the goal" of 1,6(X) students, he said.
As a result. 46 students on the wait
ing list were offered admission, and it
is assumed that most of them will
come. Last year, the admissions office
did not take any students from the list.
"The frosh number obviously has
an impact on the number of spaces
available for upperclass assignments
in the Draw." said Kathleen Brans
field. manager of Housing Assign
ment Services.
"We have worked very closely with
[the Admissions Office] so that we
each understand one another's num
bers." she said. "We have done a bet
ter job of holding out the right number
of spaces for frosh and transfers from
the assignments in the Draw."
Transfer applications saw an in
crease of about 1(H). at 1,330. A total of
111 transfer applicants accepted offers
