## Barnaby Crackow How radio won the second World War 
### 
These Colors Don't Run!

World War II would have been
very different without radio. That
magic little box kept our morale sky
high as we stomped Kraut keister
over half of Europe. We loved the
great NBC Friday night line-up of
Jack Benny, Groucho Marx, Buster
Keaton and Marcel Marceau. How
we laughed at Marcel's silent antics
as we mowed down acre after acre of
the so-called "master race." The
frantic verbal gymnastics of Groucho
brought a smile to our lips and a ray
of sunshine to our brow as we merci
lessly hacked off various Nazi
appendages.
When we first arrived in Europe,

we were afraid the Hun might speak
English and thus be privy to our
vaunted NBC broadcasts. Much to
our relief, however, they spoke
"German," an awful language that
obliges the listener to kill himself
after 5 sentences. This stroke of luck
allowed our morale-boosting box of
transistors and speakers to remain
impenetrable to Nazi ears.
Our secret safe from the Saxon,
we kicked off the war on Sunday, lis
tening to the soothing voice of the
Rev. Billy Graham as he so elo
quently preached the all-encompass
ing love of our savior Jesus Christ.
This wonderful, uplifting sermon

gave us the peace of heart to rip the
heads off schoolgirl's budgies, and
find it within us to forgive the lowly
Nazi as we thoughtfully disembow
eled him.
We played tag with Rommel in
the deserts of North Africa to the
swingin' tunes of Glenn Miller and
his orchestra. We bopped half the
summer away to such tunes as
"Tuxedo Junction," "Pennsylvania 6-
5000" and "Kalamazoo." Soon, we
were so punch drunk with giddiness
from the delightful programming
that we invited Rommel and his boys
over to be killed. They readily acqui
esced, and we beat them to death

with coconuts.
The fire bombing of Dresden and
concurrent invasion of Italy mir
rored the dramatic elocutions of
Pennzoil's "Classic Theater present
ed by Pennzoil." One memorable
winter eve, my friend Jack killed this
entire Italian horde with his left
hand while following along in his
dog-eared copy of "Our Town" with
his right.
When we finally reached Hitler's
hide-out, we discovered that the
lousy sneak thought he could evade
us by cunningly shooting himself in
his evil head. But that hardly mat
tered to us as "Live From the Roxy"

was on. Spasms of joy coursed
through our bodies. Some of the
more adventurous among our ranks
called upon deep reserves of
strength to crack open walnuts with
their sphincters.
Presently, the Soviet phalanx
reached our position in Berlin, but
so deep was our stupor from the
quality programming on NBC that
we almost laid waste to their entire
battalion. We awoke just in time,
though, and realized that we had
won the war, all thanks to radio.

Madam, I'm Adam. Lo! Often I'm a
T.S.Eliot on onanism: "Sin! A No-no! Toil,
estaminet fool."
