# Don't Worry, Gregor! (It's only a phase.)
## 
### 
Gregor Samsa has written to us,
worried and confused by certain
changes that have taken place to
his body in recent times. Gregor,
who lives with his parents in Franz
Kafka's story "Metamorphosis," has
noted that he has changed into a
giant insect.
Gregor, don't worry, it's all a
natural and healthy part of grow
ing up. Believe me, you are not the
only person to whom this has hap
pened. Every boy was embarrassed
the first time he woke up from a
strange dream to discover that his
pajamas were ruined because he
had transformed into an insect.
A healthy boy, starting at age 13,
should notice certain changes hap
pening to his body: a hard exo-

skeleton, compound eyes, an extra
set of little legs and, of course, acne.
Of course it's embarrassing
when, after swim class in the
showers, all the other boys make
fun of you because you're the only
one with indigo-blue skin and
giant pincers. But don't worry.
Soon they'll be going through
exactly the same thing as you are,

trust me.
And those feelings for girls are
natural too. There's no need for
guilt. You've noticed certain urges.
You want to glue yourself to the
girl in geography class and, once
she's produced 900 larvae, eat her.
These feelings are confusing; you
never had them when you were
nine. But, in the end, you'll see
that, for an insect, they're quite
natural.
Sometimes you'll feel that your
parents don't understand you. They
might seem to be terrified of you.
Sometimes they use a big stick to
beat you back when you approach
them. Remember, these changes are
as difficult for you as they are for
them. Their little boy is gone and

instead, they have a 5-foot insect
squirming on its back and scream
ing. Well, I think their reaction is
understandable, don't you, Gregor?
So, Gregor, please don't worry.
What you've gone through is con
fusing, exhausting and agonizing,
but it's all natural. Everybody has
to go through it. So Gregor, cheer
up, and try not to eat me.
