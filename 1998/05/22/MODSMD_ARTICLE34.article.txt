Church declares sin to be a sin
(AP) VATICAN CITY - In an unusual excur
sion into metatheology, the church yesterday
proclaimed sin to be a sin. "We felt it neces
sary given the closed-system nature of the
theology of sin," said Cardinal Godel. "Sin
was not self-referential, so we felt that step
ping out of the system and making sin a sin
was the next logical step."
Rope-a-Pope?
(AP) VATICAN CITY - The Pope retracted
last week's statement that he would take on
Mohammed Ali "anytime, anywhere" and
"whomp on his ass." The Pope said he was
unaware that Ali, 52, was now "an incontinent

old fool. A washed-up scrambled-brains and
flab man." He then said that his challenge to
Joe Frazier was still valid and that he was
looking forward to "opening up a six-pack of
whup-ass" on Mr. Frazier.
Satan sues for libel, slander
(AP) HELL - Saying he has been seriously
maligned by the Catholic Church for over
2,000 years, Satan and his cadre of ACLU
lawyers, working pro bono in exchange for a
lifetime of all earthly pleasures, slapped the
Church with a $1 gadzillion lawsuit. In a
press conference held at the gates of Hell,
Satan said he was confident of a win and then
laughed maniacally as flames shot out of his
ears.
