# Post-modernist slays Bloom
## 
### Magnus Bergenson 
The stakes in literary
criticism were raised yes
terday when Harold
Bloom, renowned cultural
critic, was blown up by a
bomb wielded by Prof.
Argle Bargleson of the
Comparative Literature
program.
"The man refused to
accept that the self was a
construct of language,"
Bargleson said "I was sim
ply not going to allow that
old man to stand in the
way of the new era of post
modernism."
Bloom's death was par
ticularly tragic in light of
the fact that he was proba
bly going to be praised by

The Stanford Review.
"From now on you'll
really have to mean it
when you say that irony is
merely a product of the
process of writing," contin
ued Bargleson from prison.
Witnesses said that
Bloom had just finished
explaining how enjoyable it
could be when Bargleson
stood up and screamed,
"Liar!" and hurled his
bomb at Bloom.
Bloom mentioned that
he was extremely
depressed at being blown
into several tiny pieces and
said that this was ju√üt a
symptom of a wider prob
lem in the humanities.
