In response to students' insistence that it
is inhumane to make them study without
munehies near at hand, Tresidder Unions
Corner Pocket will now provide food until 2
a.m.
In a joint effort by the ASSIJ, the dean of
students and the Bon Appetit management
to improve the quality of Tresidder ser
vices, the management of the Corner Pock
et has agreed to provide food throughout
the extended study hours of the Tresidder
cafeteria area. The extended hours and
food will be available beginning Tuesday
and will continue until the last day of finals.
"We're delighted that Bon Appetit is
providing this service for students," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. "I think it's a
wonderful gesture."
Corner Pocket management has agreed
to do one of two things. If possible, they will
hire new staff so that hot food services can
be provided until closing time. If staffing

constraints prevent them from doing so,
they have agreed to instead provide compli
mentary cookies and coffee, or something
similar.
"They're trying to do what they can. but
they have to look at the economics, too,"
said ASSIJ President Maren Norton. "The
biggest complaint to [Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James] Montoya has been that
Tresidder needs to cater to the needs of stu

dents." Norton expressed that this change
was the first step toward accomplishing that
goal.
In order to extend the study hours of the
Tresidder area from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., Stan
ford Management Company has requested
that student volunteers be present to moni
tor the area. Paid student monitors will
make sure that nothing is removed or dam
aged in the area.
