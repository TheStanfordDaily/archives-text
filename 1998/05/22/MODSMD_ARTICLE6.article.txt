### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
Parking is a paramount problem on cam
pus. according to a recent survey of graduate
students. Ninety-six percent of students sur
veyed said they had regular problems find
ing parking on campus.
The report, as part of a larger examina
tion by the Graduate Student Council and
the ASSU Task Force on Graduate Hous
ing. said the construction tit new housing on
campus has complicated the issue.
Buildings such as the Science and Engi
neering Quad. Gates Computer Science
Building, the Center for Clinical Sciences
Research. Schwab Residential Center and
1 vman Hall were all constructed without
building the appropriate number of addi-

tional parking spaces.
"In the medical
school, they construct
building after building
without parking." said
Jim Brewer, an
M.D. / Ph.D. student.
"Construction of
Lyman ... resulted in a
significant net local loss

in parking spaces, creating a horrendous
parking situation." the report said.
The situation also affects undergraduates
and staff members.
"It's pretty bad." said sophomore Mike
Hopp. a resident of the Suites, adjacent to
Lvman.
