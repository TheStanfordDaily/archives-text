# Parking prime problem for graduate students
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
Parking is a paramount problem on cam
pus. according to a recent survey of graduate
students. Ninety-six percent of students sur
veyed said they had regular problems find
ing parking on campus.
The report, as part of a larger examina
tion by the Graduate Student Council and
the ASSU Task Force on Graduate Hous
ing. said the construction tit new housing on
campus has complicated the issue.
Buildings such as the Science and Engi
neering Quad. Gates Computer Science
Building, the Center for Clinical Sciences
Research. Schwab Residential Center and
1 vman Hall were all constructed without
building the appropriate number of addi-

tional parking spaces.
"In the medical
school, they construct
building after building
without parking." said
Jim Brewer, an
M.D. / Ph.D. student.
"Construction of
Lyman ... resulted in a
significant net local loss

in parking spaces, creating a horrendous
parking situation." the report said.
The situation also affects undergraduates
and staff members.
"It's pretty bad." said sophomore Mike
Hopp. a resident of the Suites, adjacent to
Lvman.

He compared his situation to
last year. "I lived in Wilbur last
year, and it was never a problem."
Other students had more fla
grant things to say.
"It's resulted in many frustrated
and angry people," said sopho
more Ben Hurlbut. "I often have
to walk 15 minutes to my car, and if
you come in late at night, you can't
find a spot."
The situation is amplified for
graduate students because "gradu
ate students living off campus are
faced with both commute times
and parking issues," the report
said.
In addition, graduate students
often keep unstructured hours, re
quiring parking outside of the typi
cal 9-to-5 time slots.
Additionally, students are often
forced to park far away from their
destination late at night, which
could be especially dangerous for
women.
"If you're going to choose to get
a ticket or walk far away where it's
dangerous, you'd choose to get a
ticket," said Elise Temple, a doc
toral student in neurosciences and
a resident of Escondido Village,
where the parking situation is par
ticularly acute.
The limited hours of SURE Es
cort are also an issue for graduate
student researchers, who often
work past the time that the service
stops, according to Robert Rudnit
sky, a physics doctoral student and

a member of the Graduate Student
Couneil.
Julia Fremon, program manag
er of Transportation Programs,
told The Daily last Oetober that
she thinks safety is not an issue.
"We all have to walk, and we all
have to walk in the dark. There has
been no evidence of any safety
concerns," Fremon said.
In dealing with these issues,
Transportation Programs has
come up with solutions such as
Park and Rides, in which one
would park their car and then ride
bikes around campus.
Also, they have provided a $90
incentive for graduate students to
commute by means other than
cars. The Marguerite has been ex
panded to handle longer hours as
well.
However, few feel these pro
grams are working. Brewer, who
recently received two parking tick
ets, commented that "I paid back
all the money I saved [from the $90
coupon | in a couple of days."
"[ The parking program] is just
not organized very well," Hurlbut
said, and went on to describe how
several new fire lanes had been put
in and that large portions of the
student lots were blocked off near
the Suites.
"Resources are scarce.... The
University wants land for educa
tion, not parking," said Trans
portation Programs Business Man
ager Louise Aryapour last fall.
The report recommends an ex
amination of the permit system.
Brewer said simply, "We need
more A stickers."
