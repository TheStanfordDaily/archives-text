(A PLEASE DO NOT ABANDON
/r YOUR CATS AND OTHER PETS
w While University housing policy prohibits keeping
J pets in or (/about Campus residences,
/ some/y students still have them.
/ \ \\Despite good intentions,
I J 3/ some of those pets will be lost or
V abandoned on Campus.
Cats are abandoned in desperation, when students cannot
take them home, travelling, or to a new apartment/career.
They reproduce and, with their offspring, may die of
starvation and disease.
. L uow
Critters left behind in student housing may die of
dehydration and starvation,
before they are found too late in the summer.
If you or someone you know is in this predicament,
please find a way to keep your pet or find a good home for it.
If you cannot work it out, or you find a lost/abandoned animal,
will work with you to find a humane solution.

Give Me Your Password!
I'm a Hacker
I can use your password to break in to Stanford's computers. Even
if you don't tell me your password. 1 11 steal it off the network.
Unless, that is, you're using MacLeland or PC-Leland on your
personal computer.
Stanford is always adding security features to make it harder for
me to break in. But when you log in or check email and type your
password "in the clear," these features won't work. MacLeland
and PC-Leland make life tough for me because:
* They're free!
* They're easy to use!
* They protect your password.
* They give you faster access to computing.
They even lock your computer! Both are available on the web at:
