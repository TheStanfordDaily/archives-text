SUMMER
In hot weather and espe
cially during exercise, our
bodies lose fluids from evapo
ration and sweating. Drink 8 to
10 glasses of water and/or
rehydration drinks daily. Watch
for symptoms of dehydration:
lightheadedness, a dry mouth,
sticky saliva, dark yellow urine
and infrequent urination.
Under the Sun
Exposure to the sun greatly
increases your risk of skin
cancer. Your skin will age more
quickly (and you'll look older
than you are). When you're in
the sun, use sunscreen with a
sun protection factor (SPF) of at
least 15. Apply it fifteen minutes
before going out in the sun, and
reapply according to directions.
Also protect yourself from the
rays with long sleeves, loose
clothes, and a brimmed hat.
Avoid the strongest rays
(between 10 and 2). If you do
get burned, drink lots of water,
and cool down in a bath. For
headache, take aspirin or
acetaminophen and lie down in
a cool room. Lotion may help
itching, but there's nothing you
can do to stop peeling.
The Open Road
For that cross-country bike
trip, get a helmet that fits right
and wear it properly. Most
bike-related deaths are from
head injuries that could have
been prevented by a helmet.
Stay visible on your bike (use
reflectors and lights at night),
use hand signals, and obey the
same traffic rules as motorists.

These cool dudes are headed for
some summer fun (note the
Stanford sticker on the wind
shield).
The Wilderness
Conditions in the wilderness
change fast, and you can
suddenly find your-self in a
serious situation. Bring the
following on your outdoor
adventures:
Q Water
□ A map and compass
□ A pocket knife
□ Waterproof matches or
lighter
LI A flashlight
CI A whistle
□ Extra energy food
□ Extra layers of clothes and
a shell
□ Some money (e.g.: $10)
□ First aid items such as
Aspirin or acetaminophen,
scissors, tweezers, antihista
mine pills, Band-Aids (lots), 4"
sterile gauze pads and adhe
sive tape, and a 3" (Ace) elastic
bandage
□ A space blanket
□ A cellular phone
Consider taking a first aid and
CPR course, or read a first aid
book. Study the area you'll be
going into ahead. Identify
inhabited areas where you can
get help.
Hie Mountains
It takes your body about 14
days to adjust to altitudes
above 8000 feet regardless of
your physical condition.
Although it doesn't affect
everyone every time, Acute
Mountain Sickness (AMS) can
come on within 6 hours of
rapidly ascending 8000 feet.
Start below that and walk up.
If you're driving or flying,
don't go higher than 8000 feet
in the first 24 hours. Take a
rest day after every 3000 foot
climb.
AMS symptoms may include
headache, fatigue, nausea, and
appetite or balance loss. If you
get AMS, wait until symptoms
decrease before going higher.
Drink water to prevent dehy
dration; take aspirin or ibu
profen for headache. If symp
toms increase, head down to a
lower altitude.
At high altitudes eat lots of
carbohydrates, drink 3 to 4
quarts of fluid a day, and
avoid over-exertion, tobacco,
alcohol and other depressants
as they slow down your ability
to acclimate. Daimox, a medi
cine, can prevent AMS. Q
Everyone, at Cornell wiskes
youscvsafe, and happy sunatur.
