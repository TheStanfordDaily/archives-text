# Lyman bike racks cause controversy
## 
### James Buxbaum 
In recent months the appear
ance of Cape Cod-style bike shel
ters in the parking lot between
Sterling Quad and Lyman Hall
have caused great controversy.
Despite their aesthetic appeal,
many students feel that the struc
tures lack purpose, unaware that
they are future bike storage facili
ties.
Others have become enraged
after receiving tickets for parking
in front of the structures. Junior
Tara Hale expressed the frustra
tion of many Governor's Corner
residents, saying "they are a major
waste of space in an area that needs
more parking."
A law student who wished to re
main anonymous complained bit
terly about the noise and delays as
sociated with the construction of
the shelters.
"They only seem to do work on
the structures during finals week
and then only very early in the
morning," he said.
Nevertheless, school officials
and some students are optimistic

about the future of these struc
tures. " This is an experiment to see
how these structures work in re
ducing theft and protecting stu
dents' bikes," said Bicycle Pro
gram Manager John Ciccarelli.
Although they take up 16 park
ing spaces, the structures will pro
vide shelter for more than 150 bicy
cles. Ciccarelli said similar struc
tures at the Schwab Residential
Center have been met with great
enthusiasm by business students
who store their bikes there.
Although construction was de
layed by inclement weather, the
Governor's Corner structures are
expected to be finished and avail
able for use in about one month.
Many graduate students living
in Lyman look forward to the day
when they can house their bikes in
these shelters.
"Most people hate the struc
tures because of the controversy
associated with their construc
tion," said doctoral student Pavel
Bogdamnov, "but it sure will be
nice to park there."
Medical student Ron Firstein
added. "1 would be happy to put my
bicycle in there."
Undergraduates living in Gov
ernor's Corner may also have the
opportunity to use the structures if
there is extra space, Ciccarelli said.
In manv ways, the frustration

surrounding the bike structures is
more of a symptom than a cause of
the parking problems on the west
part of campus.
"1 have never actually seen the
structures," said junior Tammy
Presser. "but somebody has to do
something about the parking prob
lem out in Governor's Corner, per
haps by creating inward slanting
rather than horizontal parking
spaces along Santa Teresa."
