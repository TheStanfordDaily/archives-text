# Indonesia to hold elections
## 
### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Breaking from a
lengthy tradition of autocratic rule, Indonesia's president
promised yesterday to hold elections that could cost him
his new job but move the country toward greater politi
cal stability.
In other major concessions to reformers, the govern
ment granted freedom to two political prisoners and said
it would review its business dealings with some compa
nies owned by former President Suharto and his family,
who amassed great wealth during his 32-year rule.
President B J. Habibie had pledged to reform the cor
rupt economic systems installed by Suharto, who
resigned Thursday. Few believed, however, that he had
the will or the clout to carry it out.
Habibie had risked further unrest and his own ouster
if he attempted to serve out Suharto's five-year term.

Student protesters, democracy activists and some Cabi
net ministers had called on him to quit or set new elec
tions.
Meanwhile, military chief Gen. Wiranto said he
would seek a swift trial for 14 soldiers the army named as
suspects in the killing of six anti-Suharto demonstrators
this month.
The May 12 killings and anger over rising prices trig
gered rioting that killed at least 500 people in Jakarta
alone and ultimately led to Suharto's ouster. Officials
said yesterday that at least 56 people remained missing.
Compounding the government's woes, food short
ages were reported in parts of the country, the business
newspaper Neraca reported. Economists said the food
supply is adequate, but the riots shattered distribution
networks.
