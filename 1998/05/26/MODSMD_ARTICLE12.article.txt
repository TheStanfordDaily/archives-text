Draw revisions have
hurt disabled freshmen
and sophomores

MOST STUDENTS know the
good and bad news. Draw
1998 results are in. Some stu
dents were satisfied; others were
excluded from their prime choices. In
particular, Toyon Hall filled with
sophomore priorities, and Kimball Hall
was filled with upperclass students, as
specified by this year's Draw changes.
These results raise important con
cerns about the extent of disability
access in University residences.
Kimball hosts excellent facilities for
disabled students. The upcoming instal
lation of an elevator will make it one of
only four housing options on campus
with vertical accessibility.
Ability to move between floors is an
important factor in enabling students to
integrate into dorm life.
Kimball is perhaps the most attrac
tive option for disabled students as
other vertically accessible dorms such
as Florence Moore Hall, Mirrielees, and
Synergy require students to cross heav
ily trafficked intersections or ascend
steep hills.
However, the Kimball option will be
unavailable to next years incoming dis
abled freshmen, who will have to live in
residences that require crossing busy
streets. Toyon, on the other hand, is not
highly accessible for disabled students.
Students with wheelchairs must use lifts
to reach some rooms — an option that
is not entirely safe.
Moreover, Toyon has only one emer
gency exit that is handicapped accessi
ble; that exit may not be operable in the

event of a power outage.
The Residential Programs Imple
mentation Group was unaware that
Kimball would be receiving an elevator
when it decided to make it an upper
class house. Draw results have already
also been released, so the damage for
the coming school year can't be
undone.
As it plans for the 1999-2(XX) aca
demic year, the implementation group
should consider accessibility and
rethink its decisions about upperclass
and all-sophomore housing. Admitting
only disabled freshmen into Kimball
would isolate them in a community of
older students. But admitting a critical
mass of freshmen, including disabled
students would allow the latter to live in
their best housing option while inte
grating into a community.
Likewise, if the University believes
that an all-sophomore community is a
valuable social and academic entity, it
should ensure that this community is
accessible to everyone.
When Toyon is renovated under the
Capital Improvement Plan three sum
mers from now, administrators should
make improving accessibility a high pri
ority.
If the University is truly committed
to improving disability access, it must
realize that sophomores who use
wheelchairs may want to live in an all
sophomore house just as much as other
sophomores. As the implementation
group considers plans to create a fresh
man / sophomore living cluster, it
should make sure plans include dis
abled students.
This year's housing decisions left dis
abled freshmen and sophomores out in
the cold. We hope that future housing
changes and improvements will not
make the same mistake.
