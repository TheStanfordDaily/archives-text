## Exiting Stanford gracefully 
### 
MY FOUR year
lease on Stan
ford is coming
to a close.
Admittedly, the
University has been quite
civil in its gentle
reminders that my class'
time is through. They

have planned cocktail parties and lun
cheons and social hours in our honor. 1 have
very nice eviction notices — euphemistical
ly designated "graduation announcements"
— printed with my name on them.
1 am sure my parents will be suitably
impressed with the whole affair, and I will
proudly play the tour guide as I show them
around the past four years of my life here.
The only thing between me and that diplo
ma is a $7.50 fine at Green Library, and I
doubt that will postpone the inevitable.
I have also resisted the urge to extend
my lease here for another few years. 1 will
not coterm, though the siren call of a pro
tracted stay on campus is extremely com
pelling. Nor will 1 work in the Financial
Aids Office or the Bursar's Office in order
to remain in close proximity to the Coffee
House.
I have no desire to delude myself into
believing I am still an undergraduate. I have
canceled my post office box. The Bookstore
will have to mail my last rebate check. I'm
cashing in my Stanford chips once and for
all. The time is at hand.

I'm off to a seven-digit salary in the cut
throat world of international information
exchange. Well, 1 am actually teaching
English in Japan and my salary is paid in
yen, but I have to do something to keep
stride with my investment banking and
management consulting brethren. My new
home will provide challenges of its own,
such as the specter of one of the local deli
cacies: horseflesh sashimi. The next two
years will not be a point of departure from
my Stanford experience, but rather an
extension of my years here.
1 cannot help but carry the lessons of the
classroom and the company of friends
across the ocean with me. The thought of
the 1,600 members of the senior class
extending a network of friendships out into
the big, bad "real world" is terrifically com
forting. Perhaps we could transmit the dis
tinct Stanford character to the world
around us, infusing others with the vitality
that distinguishes us. 1 would be content to
live in a world that more closely resembles
this campus.
This swell of optimism will carry most of
us through the initial withdrawal pangs
from Stanford. However, the truly consci
entious among us will have to come to
terms with a world that continues to privi
lege economics over ethics, that cripples
individuals as readily as it indulges them.
Indeed, many of the issues I have dealt
with in this column — the lack of an under
graduate academic community, the

increased division among different disci
plines, growing cynicism and rampant prag
matism — may speak toward larger issues.
In our attempts to remedy what is wrong
and celebrate what is right at Stanford, we
can prepare ourselves to be citizens of the
world.
All of this sounds grand enough, but is
nothing more than shouting at the wind if
we cannot proactively effect change in the
lives of others.
Hardly the tireless crusader for social
justice, I will begin to quietly pack my bags
soon. I'll be content to put off world peace
for a short while if I can cram all of my stuff
into boxes. I'm already trying to spend as
much time with friends as possible before 1
leave, all too aware just how fast the next
two weekp will !ly by.
1 will rent my cap and gown, and in def
erence to tradition, get roaring drunk at
"The Graduate." Then I will climb aboard
my hippity-hop (or pogo stick, or weather
balloon) for the Wacky Walk and walk /
hop/glide off into the cloudless California
sunset.
I will do my best not to glance over my
shoulder.
