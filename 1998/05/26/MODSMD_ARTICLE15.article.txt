Remaking the Asian male
I am writing in response to Alda Leu's
May IS column titled "Asian images: sex
and interracial dating." She talked about an
interesting issue which I (as a non-Ameri
can) thought was too controversial to be
discussed, even in America. After all, sticky
subjects like sex, race and beauty are raised.
I am not at all against interracial dating/
marriages. Indeed, I believe it is one of the
ways that can enhance the mutual under
standing of different races.
However, it is more complicated if this
kind of interracial interaction occurs pre
dominantly only between certain races.
Take Alda's example of white males and
Asian women. The übiquity of these cou
ples and the apparent disapproval of some
Asian men are hard to miss.
Although Alda referred to Asian Amer
icans, I can reassure you that this phe
nomenon exists in Asian countries. In Sin
gapore for instance, they use the derogato
ry term "S.P.G." to label Asian women who
actively seek to date / marry white men (ask

your Singaporean friends what that
acronym stands for).
Alda's theory of media influence is actu
ally quite plausible. We often underesti
mate the power of the media. After all, we
tend to think: "Hey, it is just some damned
movie, television series or magazine
photo." Nevertheless, I think it works at a
subliminal level. Asian women were not as
desirable when the ideal woman was the
voluptuous Marilyn Monroe.
By the same token, when the ideal man
is Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, and how good
looking you are is directly proportional to
how blond your hair is and how blue your
eyes are, obviously Asian men are per
ceived as less attractive.
Like Alda, I think Asian men are under
represented in the media (name me an
Asian male heartthrob or fashion model).
In fact, it is worse than that.
They are usually portrayed as unroman
tic and chauvinistic beings who leave their
women no choice but to run to kind white
gentlemen for salvation.
Just recall the storyline of "A Thousand
Pieces of Gold," "Miss Saigon," "Joy Luck

Club"and "The Pillow Book" for several
examples of movies that project skewed
images of Asian men.
The objective of this letter is not to
attempt to sell the image of Asian men. Nor
is it to denounce the "predation of our
women by white men." Indeed, some white
males are grappling with the rather popular
black man-white woman pairings.
The point I am trying to make is simply
that there are stereotypes about Asian men
which should be pointed out and that our
notion of beauty can be subconsciously dic
tated by the media. So, the next time you
find someone attractive, delve into your
soul and ask yourself if that is your own per
ception or that of Hollywood's.

Decline of the humanities
1 preceded Harold Bloom at Yale by
eight years or so and know well the snob
bish atmosphere against which he justified
himself, ( leanth Brooks, a genteel South

ern agrarian whom I had studied with and
saw later, expressed to me his displeasure:
Bloom, with his unkempt hair and
sweater, didn't jibe with his image of a
gentleman's university.
Bloom got hit first by the snobs whom
he strove mightily to outshine and then,
again, by the political assault on the very
Western culture he was riding to glory.
All this may help to explain the
prophetic thunder of his talk here,
although the main cause is clearly the
overall threat to the very survival of that
culture. To those in the audience who
questioned the gravity of that threat, he
replied, "Where have you been?" His
"suffering servant" sincerity was his cen
tral contribution in the appearance.
An article published in the May/June
issue of Harvard Magazine presents the
hard facts about that decline — more than
90 percent in terms of enrollment in the
humanities across the country since the
19205. All the other curves, of quality,
salaries and staffing, follow the same
sharp drop.
The authors inculpate money, but my

colleagues and I know that the main fail
ure is the loss of humanistic (as well as
sacred) faith. It isn't because they don't
earn as much as lawyers that we see fewer
priests!
The faith, energy and funding pivoted
sideways into the secular and ideological
dimension: neo-Marxist egalitarianism,
political activism of various resentful
groups, business, professionalism, special
izing science and technology.
The traditional core of the University,
the humanities — featuring great litera
ture — almost disappeared.
Reason enough to exhibit acute pain
and bellow like Jeremiah.
