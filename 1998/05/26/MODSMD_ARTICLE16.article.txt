# Showering with the boys
## Carpe diem isn't the catch of the week 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

I THINK THAT only when you are in
your twenties will you drive down to Los
Angeles for one night.
When you are young, every ride over 15
minutes seems like an eternity. When you get
as old as my father, you fly anywhere over an
hour away.
But being young and spry, with a whole
long weekend before me, I jumped into the
car and hit Highway 5.
Compared to two hours of lecture, six
hours of driving to the music of your choice
really isn't all that bad — especially consider
ing that I made my friend Jim drive the
whole way.
We left in the morning and arrived in LA
in time for an afternoon appointment to tour
the J. Paul Getty Museum. Which, may I
add, is structurally amazing, though it lacks a
plethora of great works — unless you count
the token Van Gogh.
From there, we navigated the traffic of the
405 freeway and did the 10-mile trip down
town in approximately an hour. Ridiculous.
We caught a quick bite to eat and then
headed off to a concert. By midnight we were

out getting beers with my friend Angela —
my RA from freshman year. The three of us
laughed at ourselves for hours, talking about
the future and even indulging in a little rem
iniscing about the past.
By two we were back at her house, crash
ing for the night.
The perfect weekend when you are 20.
Culture and art. Music and food. After all,
this is the time of your life.
You know what everyone tells you: "You
are only young while you are young." "Life is
short" and "Carpe diem isn't the catch of the
week." Yadda, yadda, yadda.
Self-indulgence is the name of the game.
Sleeping late is required. Focusing on only
the world around you is OK when you spend
$30,000 a year to live it.
So I figured that after cranking out a
paper Friday, a visit to El Pueblo de Nuestra
Senora la Reina de los Angeles de Porciun
cula was a place to actualize my id's poten
tial. And I'd say I did a darn good job.
But Sunday, I relinquished control to
Angela. I figured that if she could deal with
my whining, asinine, freshman questions for

nine months and still want to be my friend,
then she must have a pretty good idea about
what was going on.
I asked her to show me what was worth
seeing in the city of smog, scandal and sketch.
So, humoring me, she and her younger sister
Melissa drove Jim and I down Hollywood
Boulevard and wowed us with its wannabe
famous and fabulous filth.
Then we traveled over to Venice Beach
and walked the boardwalk. I was dazzled by
the stunning tattoos and artistic piercings on
the hardened bodies of the unimaginably
vain.
But soon I grew tired of the crowds and
endless hustle. I was sick of seeing skin and
appalled by apathy.
Mercifully, Angela put me back in the car
and headed off to the last sight of the day —
the Memorial Day dinner at her grandma's
house.
We sat on blue plastic lawn chairs and
drank soda, waiting for other members of the
family to arrive. First came Angel's aunt,
Angela Sr., her husband and 8-year-old son
Justin. We sat out on the porch and watched

Justin do about a hundred impersonations ot
his favorite professional wrestlers: from both
the WWW and the NWO.
Then Angela's parents arrived, followed
by Angela's unele and his wife. With all 10
members of the family aecounted for, we
were herded into the kitchen, met by the
aroma of Grandma's okra gumbo.
Handed a bowl, I followed the mass down
the length of the counter and stove, first dish
ing myself a large dollop on riee. then cover
ing it with three ladle-fulls of gumbo.
We progressed into the dining room and
crammed around the table, passing fresh bis
cuits and crackers for the crab. And before
everyone had found a space, everyone was
digging in to the best Louisiana gumbo I had
ever tasted.
Soon everyone was either stuffing his or
her mouth or talking. Two or three conver
sations were often being batted back and
forth across the room at once.
Angela was filling her uncle in on being a
doctoral student, and I was talking to Angela
Sr. about Justin's refusal to eat anything but
McDonald's hamburgers and microwave pi/-

/as.
As we settled in and second helpings were
served, the family began telling stories and
laughing about growing up. growing broader
and growing older.
1 love my parents and sister, but my
extended family is scattered across the globe.
And sitting at the table, watching everyone
involved in each other's lives and caring for
every cousin and in-law and step in between,
I truly saw something beautiful.
So. though the Getty was splendid and the
music was wonderful, eating gumbo with
Angela's family made my weekend. No
doubt papers must get written and equations
must be memorized as medical schools and
investment firms eagerly await, but in the
end all there is is family.
Life may be short, and those whose table
you sit around are really all you have to help
you seize the great big fish of life.
