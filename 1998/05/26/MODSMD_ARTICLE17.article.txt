ford (26-2) 4. NCAA Championship semifinal.
■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford 5. Wake Forest (IK-9)
2. NCAA Championship quarterfinal.

Ihe Blue Devils (24-5) avenged a mid
season loss to the Cardinal (26-2) hv coming
from behind in the No. 1 and No. 3 doubles
matches. In doing so. Duke stole a spot in
the finals from the Cardinal, who has not
lost in the semifinals since 1995.
Early play looked promising for the Car
dinal.
Stanford seniors Ania Bleszynski and
Julie Scott gave the Cardinal a 4-3 lead b\
taking their No. 2 doubles match over
Duke's Megan Miller and Kristin Sander
son. The seventh-ranked doubles team in
the nation put the momentum in Stanford's
favor by rolling over its Duke counterparts
8-2.
The Cardinal looked good at that point,
winning by a 6-5 margin in both remaining
doubles matches and needing only one to
advance to the finals. But Duke stormed
back in both matches and earned its first

ever trip to the NCAA Championship
match.
"They're a good team." said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "We've been
nip and tuck with them for years. I wouldn't
consider this an upset by any means."
In the No. 1 battle. Duke junior Vanessa
Webb clinched the match with a slam as she
and Karen Goldstein — together the No. 2
doubles team in the nation — defeated
Stanford sophomores Anne Kremer and
Tervn Ashley. Blue Devils Kathy Sell and
Brooke Siebel put Duke in position to win
with an 8-6 win over sophomore Jennifer
Heiser and freshman Sarah Pestieau in the
No. 3 match.
"1 was confident going into doubles be
cause I think we are really good." Brennan
said. "We had lots of chances. In fact, we
were up in both at one time, but we couldn't
finish them off. Duke did that, and I give
them credit for it."
Stanford was fortunate to be up 4-3 after
seven matches. Going into singles, the Car
dinal was headed tow ard a 2-4 deficit before
Kremer came from behind to earn a huge
win over the third-ranked Webb in the No.
1 singles match. After dropping the first set.
the eighth-ranked Kremer responded with a
2-6. 6-1. 7-5 victory.
"1 felt good going into the match against
Vanessa.'" Kremer said. "I've beaten her be
fore. I knew what was going to work for me
with these conditions out there."
Also victorious for the Cardinal were

Senior captain Julie Scott led her team as far as she could, but the Card was defeated 5-4 by the Duke Blue Devils in the na
tional semifinal match.
Scott and Bleszynski in the No. 2
and No. 4 matches, respectively.
Scott did her part with a 6-2, 7-5
win over Sanderson. For the sec
ond straight day, Bleszynski put
the Cardinal up 1-0 early in the
match, cruising to a 6-2, 6-2
straight-set win over Goldstein.
But the Blue Devils earned
points in unexpected places. In the
No. 3 singles match, Duke freshman
Megan Miller had to contend with
perhaps Stanford's most consistent
dual-match performer. Ashley lost
her fourth match of the dual-match
season to Miller, 6-4,7-6 (8).
In the No. 6 spot, Heiser had put
together an impressive hot streak,
stringing 12 wins together and tak
ing 24 of 26 overall matches. But
Duke took that match also, as Zifer
notched a 4-6,6-3,6-2 victory.
In the No. 5 match, Duke's Sell
recorded a straight-set win over
6-1,6-4.
In their first meeting this sea
son, Stanford took four of six sin
gles matches en route to a 5-3 vic
tory in the semifinals of the Na
tional Indoor Championship.
However, the Cardinal saw a
different lineup from the Blue
Devils this time. In the Stanford
win. Miller and Goldstein were re
versed in the lineup in the No. 3
and No. 4 spots, and Siebel was in

the singles lineup in place of Zifer
at the No. 6 spot.
Both Duke adjustments made a
difference in the outcome, as
Miller and Zifer posted wins.
"I think Duke has changed a lot
since we last played them indoors,"
Brennan said. "We beat [the Blue
Devils] there, hut they had a differ
ent lineup."
The match may have signified a
coming-out of sorts for the Duke
program. Stanford has eliminated
the Blue Devils in two consecutive
national semifinals and was 6-0
against Duke in previous meetings.
"It's gieat for the program and
great for the girls to finally beat
Stanford," said Duke head coach
Andy Ashworth. " This is the first
time ever we have beaten them.
They knocked us out of this thing
the last two years, so it was great all
around."
With the upset, Duke spoiled a
Stanford-Florida rematch in the
national championship meeting.
The Cardinal and Gators had met
in the finals for two straight sea
sons — each team emerging with
the crown once. After the exhila
rating semifinal, Duke was no
match for top-seeded and unbeat
en Florida, which went on to win its
second title in three years.
The relatively early exit from
the team draw was just the fourth
time in 16 seasons that the Cardi
nal has failed to reach the title
match.
