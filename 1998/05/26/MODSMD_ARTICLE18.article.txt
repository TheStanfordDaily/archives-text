WOMEN'S GOLF
■ Wednesday-Saturday: Stanford
(304-292-305-298 — 1199) finished
eighth in the NCAA Championship,
Madison. Wise.

But following a disappointing
first day during which it shot a 16-
over-par 304. all realistic hopes of
a national championship disap
peared.
Fortunately, the young Cardi
nal squad bounced hack over the
weekend and posted a respectable
eighth-place finish.
"If you had told us going into
the tournament that we were
going to finish eighth, we would
have probably been pretty disap
pointed," said freshman Hilary
Homeyer. "But considering the
way we played on the first day, to
come back the way we did was
pretty encouraging."
The only bright spot in the
opening round came from sopho
more Jae Jean Ro, who shot a first
round 73 to move into a tie for
32nd. Freshman standout
Stephanie Keever posted a 75 to
tie for 51 st, while classmate Home
yer found herself tied for 68th
after opening with a 77.
Following the poor opening
round, Stanford bounced back on
Thursday with a team total of 4-
over-par 292. In the second round.
Keever made her biggest move of
the weekend, graduating to a tie
for 12th after shooting 2-under
par 70.
The real story, however, after
two days at the University Ridge
Golf Course, was the spectacular
play of Arizona State freshman
Grace Park, who was lapping the
field at 14-under-par with consec
utive 655.
Stanford was not distracted by
the remarkable scoring of the Pa
cific 10 Conference Champions,
however, and spent the remainder
of the weekend chipping away at
the Sun Devils' lead and moving
up the leader-board.
Deapite another poor found of

305 on Friday, the Card rebound
ed with 298 in Saturday's final
round to lock up the eighth posi
tion.
Keever fired a pair of 73s to
complete her charge into the top
10, ending up tied for ninth.
Although Keever was the only
member of the Cardinal to finish
in the top 10, several of her team
mates endured an up-and-down
week and posted solid finishes.
Freshman Hilary Homeyer bat
tled streaky putting all week long
but managed a tie for 30th at 300.
Sophomore Jae Jean Ro, the Car
dinal's peak performer in the
opening round, came back to the
pack on day two but rebounded
with a solid weekend, ending up
just one shot back of Homeyer at
301.
"1 was very happy with my
game," Keever said. "I struck the
ball well the entire week and made
some really big putts. 1 was glad
that I got my worst round out of
the way on the first day and was
able to rebound with some solid
scores."
Arizona State cruised to the
team title 18 shots ahead of Flori
da. It was the Sun Devils' second
consecutive title and their fifth
crown in the last six years.
USC freshman Jennifer Ros
ales capitalized on the shocking
free fall of Park — who shot 77 and
76 in the last two rounds — and
captured the individual title after
an even-par 72 on Saturday to fin
ish at 9-under.
Although the Card would have
liked to perform better in the sea
son-ending national champi
onship, the team gained invaluable
experience.
"It was a really fun week."
Keever said. "We are still a
young team, and our goal was to
relax and enjoy the experience
— and that is exactly what we
did."
Despite the eighth-place finish
in the most important tourna
ment of the year, the week in
Madison was one of the high
points of the Cardinal's season in
some ways.
"We all had a lot of fun last
week," Homeyer said. "We obvi
ously would have preferred to fin
ish higher, but that's golf. This was
definitely one of the greatest
weeks I've had."
