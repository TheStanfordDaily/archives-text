The top four seeds all advanced to
the semifinals, where Stanford's dou
bles struggled a bit against Mississip
pi State but pulled out two matches to
win the doubles point. In the other
semifinal meeting. Georgia topped
No. 2 seed LSU.
Fourth seed no match
Against Mississippi State, sopho
mores Bob and Mike Bryan won
their point against Marco Baron and
Simon Larose 8-5, while senior Paul
Goldstein and junior Ryan Wolters
took the 35th-ranked team of
Matthieu Ballay and Thomas Dupre
down 8-3. Sophomore Geoff Abrams
and senior Charles Hoeveler lost
their doubles match to Jeremy Bayon
and Michael Metz 3-8.
In singles competition, Stanford
blew by Mississippi State more quick
ly than usual for the semifinals of the
NCAA Championship.
Freshman Alex Kim was the first
to win his match, blowing by the Bull
dogs' Derek Pope 6-0, 6-2 in his first
NCAA win.
Goldstein took on Mississippi
State's Dupre, who is ranked eighth

in the country and put up a good fight
but lost 6-3,6-2.
"Paul played as smart a match as I
have ever seen in my 14 years of
coaching," said Mississippi State
coach Andy Jackson of Goldstein's
performance.
Bob Bryan closed out the match at
fourth singles with a win over Ballay
6-3,6-3.
"We didn't play poorly," Jackson
said. "We looked like we played
poorly because of how talented, well
coached and experienced Stanford
is."
UCLA subdued
Stanford was out on the courts
again Sunday with a battle against
UCLA (17-8), which took out Texas
in a first-round upset 4-2.
However, UCLA was still no
match for Stanford in the quarterfi
nal, as the Cardinal took the Bruins
down 5-0.
The energy was high as the Bryans
and Wolters and Goldstein clinched
the doubles point for the Cardinal.
Wolters and Goldstein came back
from a 5-2 deficit to win 8-5.
"1 didn't feel confident in doubles
because that's their strong point,"
Martin said. "I felt we had a chance in
singles, but we let them off the hook
in the first few sets."
Goldstein and the Bryans did
struggle to stay in their first sets, but
the Bryans each pulled out 7-5 wins.

Goldstein did not finish his match
against Bruin Jean-Noel Grinda. But
Mike Bryan won his battle against
Vince Allegre 7-5, 6-2, and Bob
Bryan defeated Matt Breen 7-5. 6-4,
clinching the match.
Wolters came back from his slow
start Saturday to get Stanford's first
victory of the day over Jason Cook 6-
3,6-3.
"Coming in. I knew 1 was going to
play No. 4. and 1 was more than com
fortable in that role and playing on
the lower courts," Wolters said.
Abrams also won his match
against Alex Decret in two sets, 6-2,
7-6 (3). Even with the Stanford's
record against UCLA, the win was
not guaranteed, Gould said.
"I was concerned about this
match," Gould said. "Winning that
first point is a big boost. If you go out
there and play not to lose, they'll beat
you. UCLA is a good team."
Goodbye gophers
Stanford took down underdog
Minnesota 4-0 in the first round of
play Saturday. Stanford started in
fine fashion against the Golden Go
phers (14-13). leaving the entire sta
dium in awe at the speed of Stan
ford's doubles victory.
The Brvans beat Tom Chicoine
and Martin Michalowski at first dou
bles 8-2, while Goldstein and Wolters
won as easily at the No. 2 spot over
Jorge Duenas and Tyson Parrv.

Abrams and Hoeveler had their
match against Martin Kristoffersen
and Adam Selkirk suspended, but
also were on the verge of winning.
In the singles competition, Stan
ford won three two-set matches to
clinch the win over the Golden Go
phers.
Abrams. playing the No. 5 spot,
finished his match first with a 6-3,6-3
victory over Duenas. Bob Bryan was
next to win at the third position, post
ing a 6-2.6-4 score over Michalowski.
Mike Bryan, playing No. 2 singles,
clinched the match by beating Selkirk
6-1,6-3.
But the singles competition was
not as easy as might be expected from
a team with only one ranked singles
player. Goldstein, Wolters and Kim
were all struggling in their matches
when play was suspended.
"Any time you haven't played a
team match in a month, it's good to
get out with a win." Goldstein said.
"We are pleased to get out of here
with a win and get some competition
under our belt."
Although Stanford topped the
Bulldogs earlier this year. Georgia
will present tough competition for
the Cardinal today. Gould said that
both teams are very different now.
"Before, it was neutral site." he
said. "Now with all the heat and hu
midity, they're more in their own en
vironment. I think it will be a great
match."

he said. "We've been improving all
season long, and hopefully, we'll im
prove tomorrow, too."
The top four seeds all advanced to
the semifinals, where Stanford's dou
bles struggled a bit against Mississip
pi State but pulled out two matches to
win the doubles point. In the other
semifinal meeting. Georgia topped
No. 2 seed LSU.
Fourth seed no match
Against Mississippi State, sopho
mores Bob and Mike Bryan won
their point against Marco Baron and
Simon Larose 8-5, while senior Paul
Goldstein and junior Ryan Wolters
took the 35th-ranked team of
Matthieu Ballay and Thomas Dupre
down 8-3. Sophomore Geoff Abrams
and senior Charles Hoeveler lost
their doubles match to Jeremy Bayon
and Michael Metz 3-8.
In singles competition, Stanford
blew by Mississippi State more quick
ly than usual for the semifinals of the
NCAA Championship.
Freshman Alex Kim was the first
to win his match, blowing by the Bull
dogs' Derek Pope 6-0, 6-2 in his first
NCAA win.
Goldstein took on Mississippi
State's Dupre, who is ranked eighth

in the country and put up a good fight
but lost 6-3,6-2.
"Paul played as smart a match as I
have ever seen in my 14 years of
coaching," said Mississippi State
coach Andy Jackson of Goldstein's
performance.
Bob Bryan closed out the match at
fourth singles with a win over Ballay
6-3,6-3.
"We didn't play poorly," Jackson
said. "We looked like we played
poorly because of how talented, well
coached and experienced Stanford
is."
UCLA subdued
Stanford was out on the courts
again Sunday with a battle against
UCLA (17-8), which took out Texas
in a first-round upset 4-2.
However, UCLA was still no
match for Stanford in the quarterfi
nal, as the Cardinal took the Bruins
down 5-0.
The energy was high as the Bryans
and Wolters and Goldstein clinched
the doubles point for the Cardinal.
Wolters and Goldstein came back
from a 5-2 deficit to win 8-5.
"1 didn't feel confident in doubles
because that's their strong point,"
Martin said. "I felt we had a chance in
singles, but we let them off the hook
in the first few sets."
Goldstein and the Bryans did
struggle to stay in their first sets, but
the Bryans each pulled out 7-5 wins.

Goldstein did not finish his match
against Bruin Jean-Noel Grinda. But
Mike Bryan won his battle against
Vince Allegre 7-5, 6-2, and Bob
Bryan defeated Matt Breen 7-5. 6-4,
clinching the match.
Wolters came back from his slow
start Saturday to get Stanford's first
victory of the day over Jason Cook 6-
3,6-3.
"Coming in. I knew 1 was going to
play No. 4. and 1 was more than com
fortable in that role and playing on
the lower courts," Wolters said.
Abrams also won his match
against Alex Decret in two sets, 6-2,
7-6 (3). Even with the Stanford's
record against UCLA, the win was
not guaranteed, Gould said.
"I was concerned about this
match," Gould said. "Winning that
first point is a big boost. If you go out
there and play not to lose, they'll beat
you. UCLA is a good team."
Goodbye gophers
Stanford took down underdog
Minnesota 4-0 in the first round of
play Saturday. Stanford started in
fine fashion against the Golden Go
phers (14-13). leaving the entire sta
dium in awe at the speed of Stan
ford's doubles victory.
The Brvans beat Tom Chicoine
and Martin Michalowski at first dou
bles 8-2, while Goldstein and Wolters
won as easily at the No. 2 spot over
Jorge Duenas and Tyson Parrv.

Abrams and Hoeveler had their
match against Martin Kristoffersen
and Adam Selkirk suspended, but
also were on the verge of winning.
In the singles competition, Stan
ford won three two-set matches to
clinch the win over the Golden Go
phers.
Abrams. playing the No. 5 spot,
finished his match first with a 6-3,6-3
victory over Duenas. Bob Bryan was
next to win at the third position, post
ing a 6-2.6-4 score over Michalowski.
Mike Bryan, playing No. 2 singles,
clinched the match by beating Selkirk
6-1,6-3.
But the singles competition was
not as easy as might be expected from
a team with only one ranked singles
player. Goldstein, Wolters and Kim
were all struggling in their matches
when play was suspended.
"Any time you haven't played a
team match in a month, it's good to
get out with a win." Goldstein said.
"We are pleased to get out of here
with a win and get some competition
under our belt."
Although Stanford topped the
Bulldogs earlier this year. Georgia
will present tough competition for
the Cardinal today. Gould said that
both teams are very different now.
"Before, it was neutral site." he
said. "Now with all the heat and hu
midity, they're more in their own en
vironment. I think it will be a great
match."
