# ASSU on the Web
## Revamped site will be more user-friendly 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Starting next fall, visitors to the
ASSU World Wide Web site will
see a newly organized, more com
prehensive informational locatfftif M ~
"The site will now contain
searchable government docu
ments, information on current pro
jects and available jobs, meeting
minutes, interactive poll questions
and updated contact information
on senators," said one of the site's
organizers, newly elected Senator
Michael Levin, a freshman.
The site will also contain the on
line version of the ASSU's month
ly newsletter. Levin foresees the
online version of ASSU News
being updated frequently to serve
as an up-to-date news source on
the ASSU.
According to Webmaster
Patrick Coffman, a sophomore, the
current site is "unorganized, unat

tractive and difficult to use.
"If we improve it, it can be one
of the best information resources
on campus," he said. "We want it to
be a one-stop shop."
Coffman, who currently runs
""the Vtrtual Directory, also plans to
add a campus calendar with infor
mation and events from faculty and
student organizations to the ASSIJ
site.
The site will contain links to
other Stanford organizations and
sites. Its organizers hope to create
a rival to the "blue pages" on the
University Web site.
Outgoing ASSU President
Emily Andrus first suggested the
reorganization, a project that in
coming President Maren Norton
has continued.
Coffman expects the project,
which has been under way for the
past two months, to be complete by
August.
"We want incoming freshmen
to be able to look at the new site
before they show up in the fall," he
said. "We'll probably have an offi
cial unveiling when school begins
in September."
Coffman and Levin will spend
the summer revamping the site

"We're starting from a clean
slate, so it'll take us a while to get
done," Levin said.
The Web site retooling is the
first step in the creation of a larger
ASSU project: information.Stan
ford.edu. The new site will include
the sites for the ASSU, Stanford
Student Enterprises, the Virtual
Directory and a new site called
community.stanford.edu.
The address of the ASSU Web
site is assu.stanford.org.
