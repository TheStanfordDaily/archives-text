Senior Katrlnka Jackson arches over the bar in the high jump. Jackson and fellow
membera of the Stanford women'a track and field team placed eecond at the Pac-10
Championship meet, the hlgheat finish ever for the Card.
The 16th-ranked Stanford
women finished second — the best
finish ever for the women's track
team — with 136 points, forging a
path of destruction past No. 7 Ari
zona and No. 4 USC and rivaling No.
1 UCLA (174 points) for first.
The Cardinal men. currently
ranked ninth, finished a disappoint
ing seventh (71 points), while UCLA
(also No. 9) took the men's champi
onship with 134.5 points.
Senior Monal Chokshi jump
started the women's team Saturday
afternoon with her phenomenal win
in the 3.000-meter run.
Chokshi ran from the middle of
the pack for much of the race and did
not begin to chase down leader
Marie Davis of Oregon until 8(X) me
ters remained.
"I knew it was going to be tough
to catch up." Chokshi said. "I had my
work cut out for me."
Though Chokshi had gained
ground on Davis, she remained 40
meters behind entering the bell lap.
Davis barely responded as Chok
shi blew by her in the backstretch and
lengthened the gap between them.
Along the final straight-away,
Chokshi left the burners on and
blazed home for the win. her time of
9 minutes, 23.92 seconds bettering
Davis' by more than 10 seconds.
"I was going in with the goal of
winning," said a beaming Chokshi
after the race. "Going out as a senior,
I had nothing to lose."
With freshmen Julia Stamps and
Courtney Adams taking fifth and
seventh, respectively, the Cardinal
amassed 16 points in the 3,(XX) alone.
Combined with vital points in the
throws and jumps, as well as points
scored in last week's heptathlon
championship, the Stanford women
led all competitors after the first day.
Freshman pole vaulter Melissa
Feinstein set the tone for the Cardi
nal Sunday, her solid jump of 12 feet
5 1/2 inches putting herself out of
reach of the competition. Sopho
more Alicia Warlick also came

through in a big way lor the Cardinal,
vaulting into third place at 12-1 1/2, a
provisional NCAA-qualifying mark.
Stamps came back strong Sunday,
as she chased defending national
champion Amy Skieresz of Arizona
for second place in the S.(XX) meters
in a time of 16:35.38.
"I couldn't be happier with the
women's performances," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "It was a phe
nomenal showing for us. We expect
ed big points all the way around. We
just wanted to put ourselves within
striking distance, which we did."
As for the men, surprises in the
distance races and a lack of all
around depth minimized the Cardi
nal's point-scoring capabilities.
With no sprinters to compete
against powerhouses UCLA and
USC and a complete lack of horizon
tal jumpers in the meet, the Cardinal
men were left to fight from the back.
Early points came from sopho
more Toby Stevenson's fourth-place
finish in the pole vault, where he one
upped his school record set only a
week ago, jumping 17-11.
A lso scoring fort he Ca rd were ju
nior Adam Connolly and senior
Justin Strand, whose hammer throws
of 225-1 and 224-0 placed them
fourth and fifth, respectively.
Stanford had a chance to score big
points in the K).(KK) meters Saturday
evening as well, but a surprise from
Arizona's Abdi Abdirahman left the
Card stunned and able to recover
only 14 points in the event.
Abdirahman tested the pack
early by surging out to a 10-second
lead and then used the same tactic
later in the race to seal the victory.
By the time senior Nathan Nutter
and sophomore Brad Hauser had in
creased their pace, the race was out
of their hands. Hauser crossed in
28:44.79 for third place, and Nutter's
28:46.63 was enough for fourth and
an NCAA automatic qualifier.
Though sophomore Brent
Hauser placed second in the S.CKX)
(14:02.35) and freshman Todd Bey
erlein was third in the high jump (6-1
3/4) Sunday, Stanford just could not
amass enough points to be a serious
contender.
