Stanford's Cobb Track and Angell Field came to life
this weekend as the nation's premiere conference for track
and field, the Pacific 10. held its championship meet on the
Farm.

TRACK AND FIELD
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford women placed second in the
Pacific 10 Conference Championship (136 points).
■ Saturday-Sunday: Stanford men placed seventh in the
Pacific 10 Conference Championship (71 points).

As expected. Stanford athletes gave the two-day sell
out crowd more than its money's worth in exciting compe
tition against the nation's best.
