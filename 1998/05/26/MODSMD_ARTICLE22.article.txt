## 
### James Buxbaum 
Philanthropist George I). Hart, Class of '31,
died at his home in Marin, Calif., last Monday.
He was 90 years old.
While at Stanford, Hart distinguished himself
academically and was elected to both Phi Beta
Kappa and Beta Gamma Sigma, honor societies
on campus at the time.
Not suprisingly. Hart never neglected his
alma mater.
"Throughout his life, my father regarded
Stanford as one of the finest educational institu
tions in the world," said his son, Bruce Hart,
Class of '73.
"He was very generous to the University,"
said Ceci Evangelista, special assistant to the
vice president of the Office of Development.
Hart also served as an overseer of the Hoover
Institution.

During World War 11, Hart rose to the rank
of colonel, receiving both the Bronze Star and
Oak Leaf Cluster for his efforts in northern
France.
Following the war, Hart married Jessica Eli
Wilbur, the granddaughter of former University
President Kay Lyman Wilbur. Hart also served
as president of the firm Farnsworth and Ruggles
in San Francisco.
After retiring from business in 1957, Hart
dedicated his energy to the redevelopment of
downtown San Francisco and the progress of
California public education.
Bruce Hart recounted that his father "want
ed to improve his native city, to bring stability to
real estate in the area of San Francisco south of
Market street."
Hart played a critical role in the redevelop
ment of the region around Moscone Center and
is regarded as a pioneer in the field of urban re-

newal.
With equal zeal. Hart strived to further pub
lic education, chairing the Board of Trustees of
the California State college system, as well as
filling other educational posts. President
Ronald Reagan recognized Hart's outstanding
dedication in this field by appointing him to the
California post-secondary education committee
and later to the National Council of the Human
ities.
Hart was also involved in numerous other or
ganizations including the Knights of Malta, a
Catholic philanthropic organization, and the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and
Boston University.
Richard Dunn, president of the Western As
sociation of the Knights of Malta said, "Mr. Hart
was indeed a very fine member."
Hart is survived by his wife Jessica, four chil
dren and 10 grandchildren.
