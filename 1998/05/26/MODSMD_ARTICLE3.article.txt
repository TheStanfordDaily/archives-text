# Flexibility key in housing
## Grad students say Housing Assignment Services not accommodating 
### Bruce Wang Staff writer 
Graduate students feel that Hous
ing Assignment Services needs to
have more flexible policies and dead
lines as well as better customer ser
vice.
Many graduate students voiced
their complaints of Housing Assign
ment Services policies in a recent
graduate housing survey conducted
by the ASSIJ and the Graduate Stu
dent Council.
One common complaint among
students was that notices of housing
changes were not given in a timely
fashion, or worse, were not sent at all.
For example, students living in sin
gle-occupancy, one-bedroom apart
ments said they were never informed
that this type of housing was being
eliminated for next year. This hap
pened even though Housing Assign

ment Services promised to send no
tices in response to the requests of the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee, according to a report of the
survey's results.
Yet the housing information
booklet given to graduate students
still included one-person apartments
as a housing option for next year.
Housing Assignment Services
also failed to post an Axess notice to
notify students of housing deadlines
this year, even though Axess has been
the primary means of publicizing the
deadline in previous years. Only after
student members of GHAC recog
nized the error did Housing Assign
ment Services attempt to inform stu
dents of the deadline through their
departments, the report says.
Another common complaint list
ed in the report was the rigidity of the
move-in and move-out dates.
Strict move-in dates cause prob

lems for new students who come
early for preliminary exams and for
students attending programs that
begin before the start of the academ
ic quarter.
"It is not reasonable to require
that students arrive at Rains during a
four-hour period on a single day,"
said one international student. "It is
difficult to arrange an international
flight in that short a window." The
student also mentioned that other
universities generally had a three-day
period for students to move in.
Returning students also face prob
lems caused by the move-in dead
lines. as evidenced by this complaint:
"I found out that I am not eligible
for autumn quarter housing unless I
am here within two weeks of the
scheduled move-in date. The reason I
won't be around is that I'm GET
TING MARRIED. So there's no
way I can get into autumn quarter

housing.''
Similar restrictions on the move
out dates also cause problems. One
student couldn't move into his Palo
Alto apartment until two weeks after
the quarter ended. "I personally went
into the EV housing office and
begged them to let us stay in our
apartment for an extra two weeks,
paying rent of course," the student
said. Denied the request, "we were
homeless for two weeks Mean
while. our EV apartment sat empty
until the end of the summer."
In response. Housing Assignment
Services Manager Kathleen Brans
field. said. "It's extremely tough to
make policies that fit the demands of
over 3.000 students, especially con
sidering the diversity of graduate stu
dents."
"The date issue is a difficult one,

and one that we continue to struggle
with each year," she said. "Each sit
uation is handled in a case-by-case
situation according to how they af
fect the whole system."
Move-in and move-out dates are
especially problematic because
Housing Assignment Services
doesn't know when students plan to
vacate rooms after summer quarter.
The fact that rooms need to be
cleaned and prepared also adds to
the problem.
Bransfield also said that the poli
cies are reviewed annually to see
how they can be improved. For ex
ample, the division has already im
plemented several changes this year
in response to student complaints.
"There are things we've tried to
do this year, such as allowing both
couples to apply for housing, extend
ing the reply deadline for housing to

two weeks and having walk-in as
signments earlier."
Students said they felt alienated
by the allegedly bureaucratic, rigid
and sometimes downright unpleas
ant behavior of the Housing Assign
ment Services staff. As one student
wrote, "Everyone's been great ex
cept for HAS. They're really bu
reaucratic and not very friendly."
Another student said, one "of the
main reasons why 1 moved off cam
pus was that I felt that the grad hous
ing office had one of the rudest and
most unprofessional people working
for them."
These comments are nothing
new to the office. "We receive hun
dreds of similar petitions each year,"
Bransfield said.
"My staff has always been told to
be extremely considerate and to be
sensitive to each situation," Brans
field said. "It is always difficult when
you are in a position to, in effect, en
force a University policy that stu
dents don't at»ree with."
