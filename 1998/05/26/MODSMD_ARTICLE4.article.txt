# Few changes under new Draw
## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
In its first year under a revamped system, the
Draw did not result in dramatic shifts in cutoff
numbers for Row houses and dormitories.
However, there were several exceptions in Cow
ell Cluster and Lagunita Court, both of which will
be renovated this summer.
This year, for the first time, the undergraduate
housing lottery gave students their numbers before
they submitted their housing preferences.
Students generally appreciated the advance no
tice ot' their Draw numbers, though some ex
pressed disappointment that better numbers were
necessary for various residences that had drawn
poorly in the past.
Chandra Christenson, a junior who drew 1,121.
was upset that she will not be able to live in Cowell
Cluster next year.
"I did like knowing my number beforehand.
However, it was surprising when things changed a
lot," she said.
"Lagunita and Cowell Cluster went much bet
ter, and it was kind of disappointing."
The new system "didn't have as much of an im
pact as I thought it might," said Housing Assign
ment Services Manager Kathleen Bransfield. "But
1 do think that it gave students better information
by which to make choices."
The number of students with guaranteed hous
ing who entered the Draw — 3,964 — and the num-


Carolyn Sleeth, Justin Mills — Daily
ber left unassigned — 234 — were
similar to last year.
The unassigned students can
enter a waiting list for assignment
during the summer to spaces left
vacant by incoming freshmen and
upperclassmen who refuse housing
assignments.
"We don't anticipate having
any problems being able to meet
the undergraduate housing guar
antee and don't expect any under
grads to be unhoused," Bransfield
said.
Perhaps the largest change on
the Row was the Grove houses,
which drew 325 for men and 383 for

women. Last year, the houses drew
in the 7(X) range for both men and
women.
Whitman and ZAP also became
more competitive, ostensibly due
to their planned renovation in the
summer as part of the University's
ongoing Capital Improvement
Plan.
Whitman's cutoff for men was
481 and 696 for women; last year,
its cutoff numbers were greater
than 1,300.
ZAP drew 607 for men and 720
for women, in comparison to about
1.900 for both last year.
Bob had the lowest cutoff Draw
number for men at 55, while the
non-ethnic portion of Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk drew the lowest for
women at 62.

Other top choices for women
were Bob, Storey, Xanadu and 557
Mayfield. The competitive houses
for men included Xanadu. Storey,
557 Mayfield and La Casa Italiana.
Singles in Adelfa, Eucalipto and
Granada also exhibited popularity,
with cutoff numbers generally
below I,(XX).
Bransfield noted that housing
priorities obtained by students re
mained important.
Even students with a Draw
number of 1 cannot get into a house
if students with priority take all the
available spaces, she said.
Priority was necessary to draw
into all cooperative houses, except
Kairos for women. Getting Draw
priority for cooperative houses
generally involves assisting with a

house cooking or cleaning task.
Bransfield said she and her staff
also observed a larger number of
students who used the choices "any
Florence Moore," "any Stern" or
"any Wilbur."
"We encouraged people ... to
use those general choices," she
said. "It gives you more of a target
than just saying 'assign me any
where.' "
For freshman Mike Milne, re
ceiving the number 4 did not alter
his Draw group's housing choice.
The group had originally decided
on Synergy and did not change
their minds after learning of the
good number.
"We pretty much knew where
we wanted to live before the num
ber assignments." he said.
