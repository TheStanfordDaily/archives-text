All season long it was Stanford's

A baseball squad as domineer

phenomenon.
A consensus No. 1 squad that

Mark Marquess to comment that
they were the best regular-season
squad he has ever coached in his 22
years at the Cardinal helm.
But like El Niflo in the end. the
No. 3 Cardinal (42-14-1) was just as
unpredictable at Sunken Diamond's
NCAA West Regional.

No. 5 seed Minnesota tallying a
season high 23 hits as three players

and freshman designated hitter Joe
Borchard — had four-hit games.
And in the blink of an eve. the

Card fell flat against No. 25 Long
Beach State 5-1 in the Cardinal's
own backyard, managing only six
hits and one solo shot by Gall.
"1 was very proud of our team. It
was a great season." Marquess said.
" We're disappointed we couldn't go
on and finish it off. but we just got
beat by a better team.
"We just kind of went into a

In a controversial play In a frustrating 5-1 loss to Long Beach State, 49er Jason Bernl was called safe as Stanford third baseman Josh
Hochgesang, a junior, clearly tags him out. The Card's season ended with the loss in this elimination game. Long Beach advanced to the
College World Series.
Series for the first time with a 5-3 win
over second-seeded Alabama.
Against the Cardinal, Gallo (6-1),
who had started only seven times this
season, gave up only a seventh-inning
home run to Gall that soared over the
right-center wall.
"Mike has had the hot hand in the
last month," said Long Beach State
head coach Dave Snow. "He's pitch
ing as well as anyone in the country
right now. When you have a guy like
Mike who dominated the counts and
had three pitches going, you always
have a chance to win."
Stanford freshmen pitchers Brad
Drew — who suffered the loss — and
Justin Wayne held Long Beach, the
nation's second-leading hitting team
with a .360 average, to six hits. But
two were solo home runs in the sec
ond and eighth innings by Madison.
Those, combined with three wild
pitches, amounted to four 49er runs.
Madison, who had never hit a sin

gle home run in more than 320 Divi
sion 1 at-bats heading into Saturday,
remained surprised by his two solo
shots after the game.

BASEBALL
■ Saturday: No. 25 Long Beach

■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 19, Min
nesota (45-15) 1, NCAA West Re
gional.

"l'm not a home run hitter or a big
power hitter," Madison said. "My ap
proach was just to hit the ball hard."
Drew was a surprise starter, hav
ing thrown only 20 1/3 innings this
season. His 3 1/3-inning stint Satur
day was his longest of the season.
Long Beach State took a 1-0 lead
in the first as center fielder Terrmel
Sledge singled, stole second, was sac
rificed to third and scored on third
baseman Paul Day's infield out.
The 49ers got their other two runs
in the fifth with the help of two walks
by Wayne, who pitched 4 2/3 innings

in relief of Drew. After throwing just
four wild pitches on the season,
Wayne's three in one inning were un
characteristic.
"Every once in a while you throw
a bad pitch, and they just seemed to
capitalize on every single one of
them," Wayne said. "You've got to
give them credit for that, and it just
seemed like a long day out there."
The Cardinal advanced to the
matchup against the 49ers with a 19-1
elimination victory over Minnesota
(45-15) Friday as Stanford temporar
ily shook its end-of-the-year slump to
put on an overwhelming hitting dis
play.
The Cardinal pounded out 19 runs
on 23 hits and scored in every inning
except the eighth. The Golden Go
phers ended their 1998 season after
having lost their first game of the
West Regional 8-2 to second-seeded
Alabama Thursday.
The Cardinal of old jumped out of
the gate by scoring six runs in the first
two innings off Minnesota starter
Dan McGrath (9-3), who only lasted
1 1/3 innings with eight hits, six runs,
no walks and two strikeouts.
The winning pitcher for Stanford
was junior starter Chad Hutchinson,
who improved his record to 10-5 by
throwing five innings with four hits,
one run, one walk and six strikeouts.
Hutchinson did not give up a run until
the fifth inning.
Minnesota head coach John An
derson, however, delved into the
bullpen as he was forced to use seven
pitchers. The Gophers were also hurt
by committing six errors.
Minnesota's run was a solo shot by
Rob Quinlan.
The Cardinal started off in impres
sive fashion with Gall hitting a two
run homer in the first inning and Bor
chard later slamming a solo homer in
the first. Gerut finished the day 4 for
6 with two RB Is, Gall was 4 for 6 with
three RBIs, and Borchard was 4 for 5
with three RBIs.
Borchard hit two homers on the
day, one from each side of the plate,
and was the sole Cardinal selection to
the all-tournament team.
Other top hitters for Stanford in
cluded sophomore left fielder Ed

mund Muth (2 for 5, three RBIs) and
junior catcher John Salter (3 for 5,
three RBIs).
"I'm not sure the New York Yan
kees could have beaten Stanford
today," Anderson said. "They had
that look in their eye."
That look vanished the next day,
however, as the Cardinal season
came to an abrupt end and College
World Series hopes ceased to exist.

Garth Patil — Daily
Freshman Joe Borchard is beat to the bag by a 49er in a double play
against Long Beach State. Stanford's season came to a crashing end
with this 5-1 loss in the NCAA West Regional.
All season long it was Stanford's
answer to El Nino.
A baseball squad as domineer
ing. powerful and virtually insur
mountable as that infamous weather
phenomenon.
A consensus No. 1 squad that
commanded the polls all season long
— with the exception of one week —
and prompted Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess to comment that
they were the best regular-season
squad he has ever coached in his 22
years at the Cardinal helm.
But like El Niflo in the end. the
No. 3 Cardinal (42-14-1) was just as
unpredictable at Sunken Diamond's
NCAA West Regional.
One minute the team decimated
No. 5 seed Minnesota tallying a
season high 23 hits as three players
— junior centcrfielder Jody Gerut.
sophomore first baseman John Gall
and freshman designated hitter Joe
Borchard — had four-hit games.
And in the blink of an eve. the

Card fell flat against No. 25 Long
Beach State 5-1 in the Cardinal's
own backyard, managing only six
hits and one solo shot by Gall.
"1 was very proud of our team. It
was a great season." Marquess said.
" We're disappointed we couldn't go
on and finish it off. but we just got
beat by a better team.
"We just kind of went into a
slump in all phases of our game. We
didn't do that all year Early in
the year when we weren't pitching
very well, we scored a ton of runs.
And then about halfway through,
we struggled with the bat and our
pitching was phenomenal."
Long Beach junior Mike Gallo.
who pitched a complete-game six
hitter. spent most of the season in
the bullpen at middle relief. The
lefty threw only 85 pitches the entire
game and did not walk a batter.
With the win. the region's third

later claiming the championship and
earning a trip to the College World

In a controversial play In a frustrating 5-1 loss to Long Beach State, 49er Jason Bernl was called safe as Stanford third baseman Josh
Hochgesang, a junior, clearly tags him out. The Card's season ended with the loss in this elimination game. Long Beach advanced to the
College World Series.
Series for the first time with a 5-3 win
over second-seeded Alabama.
Against the Cardinal, Gallo (6-1),
who had started only seven times this
season, gave up only a seventh-inning
home run to Gall that soared over the
right-center wall.
"Mike has had the hot hand in the
last month," said Long Beach State
head coach Dave Snow. "He's pitch
ing as well as anyone in the country
right now. When you have a guy like
Mike who dominated the counts and
had three pitches going, you always
have a chance to win."
Stanford freshmen pitchers Brad
Drew — who suffered the loss — and
Justin Wayne held Long Beach, the
nation's second-leading hitting team
with a .360 average, to six hits. But
two were solo home runs in the sec
ond and eighth innings by Madison.
Those, combined with three wild
pitches, amounted to four 49er runs.
Madison, who had never hit a sin

gle home run in more than 320 Divi
sion 1 at-bats heading into Saturday,
remained surprised by his two solo
shots after the game.

BASEBALL
■ Saturday: No. 25 Long Beach
State (39-21-1)5, No. 3 Stanford (42-
14-1) 1, NCAA West Regional.
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford 19, Min
nesota (45-15) 1, NCAA West Re
gional.

"l'm not a home run hitter or a big
power hitter," Madison said. "My ap
proach was just to hit the ball hard."
Drew was a surprise starter, hav
ing thrown only 20 1/3 innings this
season. His 3 1/3-inning stint Satur
day was his longest of the season.
Long Beach State took a 1-0 lead
in the first as center fielder Terrmel
Sledge singled, stole second, was sac
rificed to third and scored on third
baseman Paul Day's infield out.
The 49ers got their other two runs
in the fifth with the help of two walks
by Wayne, who pitched 4 2/3 innings

in relief of Drew. After throwing just
four wild pitches on the season,
Wayne's three in one inning were un
characteristic.
"Every once in a while you throw
a bad pitch, and they just seemed to
capitalize on every single one of
them," Wayne said. "You've got to
give them credit for that, and it just
seemed like a long day out there."
The Cardinal advanced to the
matchup against the 49ers with a 19-1
elimination victory over Minnesota
(45-15) Friday as Stanford temporar
ily shook its end-of-the-year slump to
put on an overwhelming hitting dis
play.
The Cardinal pounded out 19 runs
on 23 hits and scored in every inning
except the eighth. The Golden Go
phers ended their 1998 season after
having lost their first game of the
West Regional 8-2 to second-seeded
Alabama Thursday.
The Cardinal of old jumped out of
the gate by scoring six runs in the first
two innings off Minnesota starter
Dan McGrath (9-3), who only lasted
1 1/3 innings with eight hits, six runs,
no walks and two strikeouts.
The winning pitcher for Stanford
was junior starter Chad Hutchinson,
who improved his record to 10-5 by
throwing five innings with four hits,
one run, one walk and six strikeouts.
Hutchinson did not give up a run until
the fifth inning.
Minnesota head coach John An
derson, however, delved into the
bullpen as he was forced to use seven
pitchers. The Gophers were also hurt
by committing six errors.
Minnesota's run was a solo shot by
Rob Quinlan.
The Cardinal started off in impres
sive fashion with Gall hitting a two
run homer in the first inning and Bor
chard later slamming a solo homer in
the first. Gerut finished the day 4 for
6 with two RB Is, Gall was 4 for 6 with
three RBIs, and Borchard was 4 for 5
with three RBIs.
Borchard hit two homers on the
day, one from each side of the plate,
and was the sole Cardinal selection to
the all-tournament team.
Other top hitters for Stanford in
cluded sophomore left fielder Ed

mund Muth (2 for 5, three RBIs) and
junior catcher John Salter (3 for 5,
three RBIs).
"I'm not sure the New York Yan
kees could have beaten Stanford
today," Anderson said. "They had
that look in their eye."
That look vanished the next day,
however, as the Cardinal season
came to an abrupt end and College
World Series hopes ceased to exist.
