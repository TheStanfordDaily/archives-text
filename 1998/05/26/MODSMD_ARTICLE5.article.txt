All season long it was Stanford's
answer to El Nino.
A baseball squad as domineer
ing. powerful and virtually insur
mountable as that infamous weather
phenomenon.
A consensus No. 1 squad that
commanded the polls all season long
— with the exception of one week —
and prompted Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess to comment that
they were the best regular-season
squad he has ever coached in his 22
years at the Cardinal helm.
But like El Niflo in the end. the
No. 3 Cardinal (42-14-1) was just as
unpredictable at Sunken Diamond's
NCAA West Regional.
One minute the team decimated
No. 5 seed Minnesota tallying a
season high 23 hits as three players
— junior centcrfielder Jody Gerut.
sophomore first baseman John Gall
and freshman designated hitter Joe
Borchard — had four-hit games.
And in the blink of an eve. the

Card fell flat against No. 25 Long
Beach State 5-1 in the Cardinal's
own backyard, managing only six
hits and one solo shot by Gall.
"1 was very proud of our team. It
was a great season." Marquess said.
" We're disappointed we couldn't go
on and finish it off. but we just got
beat by a better team.
"We just kind of went into a
slump in all phases of our game. We
didn't do that all year Early in
the year when we weren't pitching
very well, we scored a ton of runs.
And then about halfway through,
we struggled with the bat and our
pitching was phenomenal."

hitter. spent most of the season in
the bullpen at middle relief. The
lefty threw only 85 pitches the entire
game and did not walk a batter.
With the win. the region's third
seeded 49ers (39-21-1) advanced,
later claiming the championship and
earning a trip to the College World
