# New houses not cheap
## High cost of living 
### Dana Mulhauser Bruce Wang Staff writers 
Graduate students, long dis
grunted by the housing situation,
are holding a rally today in the
Quad at 6 p.m.
Graduate students are calling
for housing solutions costing in the
tens of millions of dollars, an
amount that Housing and Dining
Services asserts it cannot afford to
pay-
According to the Graduate Stu
dent Task Force, the University
needs to build 1 ,(X)0 spaces to meet
demand. Housing and Dining Di
rector Keith Guy estimates that
each new spot will cost around
$81.5(H), meaning that 1,000 spaces
would cost $81.5 million.
The University has pledged to
build 4(X) spaces in the next two to
three years at the cost of about
$32.5 million. According to Uni
versity Budget Director Tim
Warner, that money is the maxi
mum amount of debt Housing and
Dining can afford to take on.
Housing and Dining is a Uni
versity auxiliary that is self-sup
porting. It raises all of its own
funding through rents and receives
no money from Stanford.
"That has been policy around
here for a long time, and I think
that it's a reasonable policy."
Warner said. He does not expect
the University to change it.
According to doctoral student
and Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee Chair Stephanie Toer
ing, graduate housing is a Univer
sity-wide problem, and the Uni-
versitv should address it by provid
ing funding.
"This problem is beyond the
scope of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, and the University as a whole
should contribute to the building
of new housing," she said.
The cost of the new housing also
depends on the configuration of
the units.
Tentative plans include con
structing at least a portion of the
400 spaces as studio apartments,
according to Guy.
This setup is more expensive be
cause it necessitates building a sep
arate kitchen and bathroom for
each student.
This plan addresses graduate
student demand for single apart
ments and bedrooms.
In response to the demand for
1,000 new spaces. Housing As
signment Services Manager Kath
leen Bransfield pointed to the fact
that when Rains Houses were
built 10 years ago to address simi

lar housing demands, many rooms
were not filled in the first few
years.
However, doctoral student Har
ris Shapiro, another committee
member, responded that off-cam
pus housing was not nearly as ex
pensive 10 years ago.
Another graduate student pro
posal to ease the housing situation
in the short term is to increase
stipends to account for the rising
cost of off-campus housing.
According to the Bursar's Of
fice, the minimum budget for a
graduate student living off campus
is $20,500. The average graduate
student income is $16,000 to
$17,000.
To cover the $4,000 gap be
tween income and cost of living,
the University would need to in
crease stipends by $28 million an
nually.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Policy Tom Wasow, the
University increased graduate
stipends for the 1997-9K year by 6.5
percent.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
the University will continue to in-

crease graduate
stipends in the
near future al
though a very
significant in
crease is unlike
ly.
While the
University
plans to have

400 additional spaces in two to
three years, many graduate stu
dents feel the situation is critical
and requires swifter action.
"We believe that this issue has
come to the breaking point and
must be dealt with immediately,"
said GHAC member Alane Mur
dock. a doctoral student.
By combining a number of the
above solutions, the graduate stu
dents feel the University should be
able to provide I.(KK) new slots by
fall 1999, Shapiro said.
Graduate Student Council's all
night sleepout rally will begin in
the Quad at 6 p.m.
In preparation, T-shirts and
buttons have been made, and mass
e-mails have been distributed to
graduate students.
