Negotiate a long-term lease
that rewards post office
for good customer service

Rather than playing
irresponsible landlord with
the post office, the University
should help improve its performance o
by enhancing the facilities and making
University funding of capital improve
ments contingent on customer satisfac
tion.
For many years, the post office has
been one of the only fully-functioning
post offices on any college campus.
Having such a facility in the middle of
White Plaza has been a blessing and a
boon to many members of the Stan
ford community. With its fluctuations
of performance over the years, stu
dents and community members alike
have a love / hate relationship with it.
Through the ASSU, the post office has
worked to improve service. But more
can and should be done.
With the expiration of the 35-year
lease between the post office and the
Stanford Land Management Compa
ny, Stanford has been given a golden
opportunity to provide an incentive
structure to motivate the office to
improve service to a level beyond
bureaucracy and governmental inertia.
Last year, the issue of relocating the
post office was raised. The Stanford
Federal Credit Union area was cited as
a possible future home for it. Rather
than forcing the office to relocate to
such an inconvenient place, the Uni
versity should negotiate a long-term
lease. This lease should include

improvements to the facility and finan
cial incentives that are directly tied to
performance.
The University should develop a
plan that will outfit the post office with
structural improvements to remove
the health hazards and improve effi
ciency, much like the 10-year Capital
Improvement Plan currently being
implemented in student housing facili
ties. The cost of the improvements can
then be charged to the post office in an
incentive program.
Customer satisfaction can be polled
on a yearly basis and the yearly cost of
the improvements can be divided
between the University and the post
office on a sliding scale. For excellent
performance, the post office would
pay only 20 percent of the cost of
improvements. For extremely poor
performance, the post office would
pay 80 percent, for example.
By developing such an incentive
structure, the University would main
tain the postal services that are desper
ately needed in White Plaza. At the
same time, the University would also
address the needs of the workers who
are placed in an uncomfortable setting
and provide motivation for improved
performance.
Rather than using the excuse of
"focusing on earthquake renovations"
for a quake that occurred nine years
ago, the Stanford Land Management
Company can take time out of its busy
schedule and focus on an important
Stanford community need. When it
was time for Measure O, the manage
ment company pulled out all the stops.
Now we have Measure SPO. This issue
deserves the same kind of attention
from the administration as well.
