## Exploring secret campus spots 
### 
This is the one
you've all been
waiting for. Final
ly, it's time to reveal the
best kept secrets of the
Stanford campus. Thus,
they will no longer be
secrets. For this reason, I

hesitated to publish this
column. But alas, as I leave Stanford
behind 1 want those who remain, my fellow
Cardinals, to not miss out on some great
Stanford experiences. Be sure to clip this
baby and keep it in your folder for a sunny
day.
OK. so some say romance is rare on the
Farm. But regardless of whether you're
hitched or not, there will come a day when
you'll want to know the best place to go
while your roommate debugs his 106
assignment. After a while you'll be seeking
some place a little more exciting than the
laundry room. Try your luck with the fol
lowing:
Traditional spots: These are the spots
that first come to your mind when you
think of that someone special. You just
can't go wrong with a hike up to the Dish /
Foothills for a nice midday picnic or, better
yet. a late night stroll. Another key location
is Lake Lagunita (when it's actually a lake).
What better way to celebrate the passing of
the winter quarter rainy season than
springtime rafting? Although you may
want to avoid taking a dip if you want your

skin color to remain the same. Last but not
least, the Rodin sculpture garden (when
there's no construction) is a solid standby.
Spots in the Quad: You can't help but
associate the Quad with romance. After all,
it is the symbol of the annual initiating cer
emony to the Stanford dating game, Full
Moon on the Quad. A pleasant saunter
through the Quad can reveal many hidden
romantic venues.
For example, there's a nice little garden
arrangement by the Braun Geology Corner
that is a bit set back and complete with a few
shaded benches. For the more adventurous,
the third-floor balcony in the Lane History
Corner sports a stellar view of the Quad by
day and a breathtaking view of the stars by
night. Just around the way is the political sci
ence department's classic Graham Stuart
Lounge. Try experimenting around the
Quad — you never know what you'll find.
Just make sure to avoid the area near that
sketchy underground men's bathroom.
High spots: Although Hoover Tower is
the obvious choice, it's just way too crowd
ed. But that doesn't mean there are not a
lot of other good places. You will want to
avoid highly trafficked locations like the
Flo Mo catwalks, but some residences, par
ticularly houses on the Row, have plush
roofs, especially Durand and Ham
marskjold. From these vantage points you
can see clear to the Bay and get a sweet
bird's eye- view of the sunset or sunrise.
Another good location for getting the

campus panarama is at the Psychology
Department building (420). Personal com
mendation goes to one of the best and cer
tainly one of the most unknown places on
campus — the roof of the Center for Edu
cational Reserach at Stanford building.
You know, the mall-shaped building next
to Sweet Hall.
Low spots: Steam tunneling can be a
really exciting way to traverse the campus,
but it's probably not a good place for a first
date. Save this one for a later date.
Libraries: Some say this is a good place
to meet people. 1 find this a little hard to
believe, but libraries certainly do provide a
good place to pretend to study and sneak
longing glances into your study partner's
eyes across the table. If you're sly, you can
even initiate a little game of footsie under
the table. Probably the best libraries for
this are Mitchell Earth Science and Stan
ford Auxiliary Library (don't have to worry
about privacy here), although you'll have
to watch out for the moving bookcases.
Finally, if you just wanna be alone with
your honey, check out the cozy outside
classrooms surrounding Meyer Library.
They are usually open at night, and guess
what — you can lock them from the inside.
