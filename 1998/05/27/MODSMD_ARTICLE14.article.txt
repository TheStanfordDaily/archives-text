Improve off-campus life
I'd like to raise two issues that have
been barely addressed in the graduate stu
dent housing crisis.
Recently hundreds of graduate stu
dents found out that they will be forced to
live off campus next year.
If they do not own cars, which can be
very stipend-stretching, they face the diffi
cult challenge of finding housing accessi
ble by public transport.
If these students have to catch buses or
trains their lives become governed by pub
lic transportation schedules.
To make off-campus life easier Stan
ford needs to increase its efforts in provid
ing public transportation and coordinating
with other Bay Area transportation
providers.
Even if students leave campus on
weekdays by N p.m. (the last Marguerite)
or 10 p.m. (the last #35 bus) the demands
of research and courses may not be over
for the day. Students often need dial-in
modem access to campus computers.
With the increasing numbers of stu
dents being turned away from campus
housing the University needs to commit

resources to the modem pool to ensure
that frequent busy signal and connection
errors are not adding to the frustrations
and difficulties of off campus life.
Finally, I'd like to raise one more point
about housing policy. Coed groups (at
least last time I looked into it) are not
allowed in graduate housing.
This policy effectively denied me hous
ing three years ago when three male
friends were looking for a fourth group
member. 1 was not allowed to join the
group that ended up in Rains.
I ended up off campus taking buses at
10 p.m., then walking a couple of blocks in
darkness or sleeping on their couch. This,
in my opinion, is an unfair and discrimina
tory policy.

Bloom's mixed success
As a success-failure, Prof. Harold
Bloom's recent visit to Stanford in the
guise of a presidential lecturer resembles
the helmet-basin problem in Don

Quixote.
A success, because in the main event,
with inspired commitment, for the sake of
future undergraduates, the famed Yale
critic meditated over the grave of literary
studies about their rebirth.
A failure, because in the secondary col
loquium, the faculty circus masters com
plicit in the murder could think of nothing
more elegant to do than keep on kicking
the corpse. "I knew him, Horatio."
