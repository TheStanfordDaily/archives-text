## Eric Thiessen It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it

Sometimes i wonder what evil
genius invented the Draw. Sure, not
everyone can have good housing;
there isn't enough of it. It doesn't matter
how much you paint Cowell Cluster. Hut
the concept of an "unpreferred'' yeai is sin
ister — it forces people It) abandon hope of
nice housing for an entire year.
Someplace, the original ruler of Hous
ing Assignment Services is sitting by a
roaring fire, cackling to himself, stroking
his black cat witli gnarled fingers and whis
pering, "Yes. my pretties. You will have no
choice but to live in Schiff, unless you work
for me. Escape your unpreferred fate.
Come to the dark side and be house staff,
(iive in to your hatred of bad housing. It
will make you strong!"
I gave in. Last year, rather than drawing
unpreferred, 1 went for the tasty single and
became Yost's kitchen manager. I thought
I'd tell you what being staff is like, so that
those of you who have chosen to do it will
know what you're up against, and those of
you who are living unpreferred won't be
bitter about not being ;i RA.

Don't get me wrong. I love my job. But
I got more than 1 bargained for.
I'he first day back from summer. I got
an inkling that kitchen managering might
not be nil fun and games. President ('linton
was picnicking in Governor's Corner, and
all (iovernor's Corner staff members were
asked to serve as security. All staff, that is
... except kitchen managers!
I was a bit miffed. My best chance to
hug the president gone. I asked my KA
why I hadn't been asked to volunteer. He
didn't really know, except to say, "Kitchen
managers are a strange lot. Not the kind of
loose cannons you want guarding C 'linton."
It's not that kitchen managers are crazy
people. They just have to deal with things
that are definitely not mentioned in the job
interview.
lake Yost Rat. Yost Rat is no mere
mortal rat. She's the sort of rat that crush
es empires, especially empires that hoard
cheese. She's a foot long, has a vertical leap
of lour feet, and can climb directly up
wiills. And she's smart.
I've spent hours of my life chasing Yost

she went straight for my jugular, and only a
handy bucket saved me. Did I mention that
she has huge, nasty teeth? She sidestepped
my awkward lunge and headed straight up
the wall and onto the roof. I had no

foiled again.
But Yost Rat isn't the peskiest thing
that kitchen managering has to offer.
About a week ago, I was reading the news
paper by the front door. I heard a loud
flapping noise from the lounge. I glanced
over the sports section just in time to see a
huge male duck flying at my head at top
duck speed.
I ducked, and the duck flew out the
front door, two inches away. Since I'm
kitchen manager, it was my moral duty to
clean the mess Yost Duck left behind. I got
a sponge and started, but this was just not
my day. I sensed a hostile presence in Yost.
Slowly, I turned around to see a female
duck glaring balcfully at me. This duck had
no intention of going anywhere. It seemed
we were at an impasse. Except that I pos-
