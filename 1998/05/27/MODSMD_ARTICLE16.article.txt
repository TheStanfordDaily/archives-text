# Men's tennis takes fourth straight title
## Gould's magic wins titles 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
For years, Stanford men's tennis
has dominated the collegiate circuit,
but this is the first year that Stanford
has been the sole owner of the
record number of championships.
The Cardinal has claimed its
crown a record 16 times. This year's
team broke Stanford out of the tie
with UCLA and USC for the most
team titles ever.
It also marks Stanford's third un
defeated season, its fourth consecu
tive NCAA championship and the
first time any men's tennis player has
won four championship rings. Se
niors Paul Goldstein and Charles
Hoeveler achieved that feat yester
day.
Stanford has not always been the
team to beat going into the champi
onship. but this year's team was cer
tainly the favorite.
"I would have to say this year's
team might compare favorably to
the 1978 team, which was the year
John McEnroe played," said head
coach Dick Gould. "But that team's
results were nowhere nearly as con
sistent as the results this team had all
year.
"John himself lost two matches
that year, and this team as a whole
only lost two singles matches and
one doubles point all year. That's
absolutely unheard of. This year's
team is without question the best
team I have ever coached."
With such a history of success in
national championships, Stanford is
nothing if not prepared.
Most players coming into Stan
ford as freshmen do not only have
high school competition as experi
ence, all.of the starters on this year's
team have competed in national ju
nior tournaments, and three of six
were U.S. National team members.
Each year, different teams have
had different qualities and have had
different ways of winning champi
onships, but it is no coincidence that
all 16 of Stanford's national champi
onships have been during Gould's
32-year stay at Stanford.
Georgia head coach Manuel
Diaz said there was no question as to
why Stanford keeps winning titles.
"It's obvious why Stanford is so
good. Just look at their lineup — it's
like a 'who's who' of American ten
nis in the last few years. They do a
tremendous job of recruiting.
"They go deeper than any team
in the country. Dick and (assistant

coach) John Whitlinger do a
tremendous job of developing team
spirit and character. They know how
to win."
Mississippi State coach Andy
Jackson also commented on the
Stanford team's experience both in
coaching and in the players' experi
ence in bigger, more important
matches.
"They're extremely talented, but
what gets lost between the cracks is
how well prepared they are and how
well coached they are," Jackson
said.
Goldstein said that in his four
years at Stanford, none of the teams
have been alike in composition.
"Each team is unique," Gold
stein said.
"But there is one thing that re
mains consistent, and I credit coach
es Gould and Whitlinger for this —
the camaraderie on all four of these
teams has been remarkable. Each of
those teams never had any problems
with the lineup. We had confidence
in the lineup and confidence in our
selves."
Gould said he and Whitlinger try
to make sure their players are confi
dent going into matches, but not
overconfident.
"I thought in yesterday's semifi
nal and today's match we played two
really great teams that at every spot
were capable of beating us," Gould
said.
Sophomore Mike Bryan agreed,
saying that the team never expected
to have the championship handed to

them on a plate.
When asked if it was a goal for the
team to be remembered as one of
the best teams ever, each Stanford
player said that although they were
happy to accept the honor, none of
them expected it during the course
of the season.
"That's definitely not our goal,"
Mike Bryan said. "If it's Monday,
coach (Gould) doesn't even let you
look ahead to Tuesday, much less
the end of the year. Everyone
stepped up this year. Everyone
worked so hard, the records just
came, and we were undefeated."
Goldstein agreed that Gould and
Whitlinger kept the team focused on
playing one match at a time.
"I think that's the reason we're so
successful, because we didn't think
ahead," Goldstein said. "We focus
on one match at a time. If you start
thinking about (making) history,
your going to be history in the tour
nament."
This team was the most dominant
of all the teams, Goldstein said,
more than just because of the talent.
"What didn't this team have?"
Goldstein said. "What's great is that
everyone improved during the
whole year. What we did this year
was remarkable.
"The four guys at the top couldn't
have any more respect for one an
other. We just came out and com
peted — there were never any down
days, especially with Mike and Bob
(Bryan) and all their enthusiasm. It's
just been a fun year."
