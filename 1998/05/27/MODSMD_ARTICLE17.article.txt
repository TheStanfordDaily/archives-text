# Spoiled students should appreciate athletic wealth

For almost any college coach trying to hook high
caliber recruits, there is no better bait than a shot at an
NCAA title.

Dick Gould can promise part of a dynasty.
The Cardinal men's tennis head coach watched his
team win its fourth straight national championship yes
terday, sweeping host Georgia and capping an unde
feated season. The victory was momentous (no team
has ever won four straight NCAA men's tennis titles),
but eerily routine. At Stanford, a men's hardcourt title
has nearly become a foregone conclusion.
For the record, Stanford won the title game 4-0
without dropping a set. Such domination proves once
again that in the men's collegiate tennis world, the Car

dinal sits on a peak high above its closest competition.
In the jaded eyes of most fans, the win provided a
much-needed lift for the Stanford Athletics Depart
ment. The men's national title was the fifth for the Uni
versity this school year, but Stanford die-hards were
reeling at the beginning of the week when two upset
losses derailed the Cardinal's bid for an unprecedent
ed seven championships.
First, baseball bowed out of the NCAA West Re
gional, a plane ride to Omaha, Neb. short of expecta
tions. Two days later, the Cardinal women's tennis
team fell to Duke in the national semifinals. Both
teams seemed destined for title shots.
But Cardinal fans seeking to feed their champi
onship cravings must have known men's tennis would
come through. That's what dynasties are for.
This is the part in the article when those same Car
dinal fans should start to feel a little bit guilty.
Stanford, it's time to admit you're spoiled.
Most Division I schools would be happy to have
three teams in national tournaments in the span of one
year. Giving those three teams shots at NCAA titles
would cause euphoria on most campuses. Giving three
teams shots at titles in one week and feeling disap
pointed when two of them come up a little short is.

well, sick.
Stanford is unique in that coaches in most sports can
dangle the national championship bait in front of re
cruits. Because of that, the school — media included —
sometimes fails to give squads the recognition they de
serve. Baseball had a great year (the upcoming Major
League draft should prove that). Women's tennis was
upset and still finished among the four best in the na
tion.
We won't even talk about the Sears Cup. except to
mention that four is a good number this year.
The hard truth about having a school of standout
teams is that it takes a lot to get noticed, which makes
Coach Gould's crew even more impressive. Even at a
school of five national titles, winning your fourth
straight demands attention.
When Mike Montgomery and the Cardinal men's
basketball team stormed to San Antonio. Texas in
March, people near and far turned their heads, be
cause Stanford hadn't been to a Final Four in more
than 50 vears. Thev stood out because thev overcame

tremendous odds and went where few Cardinal teams
had gone before.
Dick Gould won his 16th team title yesterday on a
hot May afternoon in Georgia. The championship
match wasn't televised and the fans were hostile.
There will be no rallies to meet his team when it re
turns to campus, no special sections of the Bookstore
selling commemorative apparel.
My guess is. he won't care.
You don't build dynasties by grabbing the media
spotlight or printing your team name and achieve
ments on thousands of T-shirts, though neither hurts
you. for sure.
You build them by w inning, by setting yourself atop
your sport and atop the best athletics program in the
country.
That way, you always have something to tell your
recruits.
