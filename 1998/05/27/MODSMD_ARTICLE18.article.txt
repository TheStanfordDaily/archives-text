eDear Health Forum,
I've heard that estrogen therapy for post
menopausal women can help reduce the risk
of cardiovascular disease. Is this true? What
are the latest opinions?
— Abbey L.
A Dear Abbey,
There have been several journal articles
published on the subject, and sadly, some
contradict each other. A 10-year follow-up
from a Boston study looked at 48,470 post
menopausal women between the ages of 30 and 63
who did not have a previous history of cancer or car
diovascular disease. Results suggest that estrogen
use is "associated with a reduction in the incidence
of coronary heart disease as well as in mortality
from cardiovascular disease, but is not associated
with any change in risk of stroke."
My most recent medline searches have revealed
more evidence — much of which comes from the
Channing laboratory at Brigham & Women's Hos
pital in Boston, Mass. — to support the claims that
estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women does
not augment the incidence of cardiovascular dis
ease.
However, we must keep in mind that each
patient's case is specific and any patient undergoing
estrogen therapy should follow the direct recom
mendations of her physician and dietitian.
eDear Health Forum,
Quite some time ago you wrote an arti
cle on sunscreen and sun exposure, but I
can't recall the details. What level of sun
block should I use to be safe?
— Tabitha, Class of 2000
A Dear Tabitha.
To answer your question, the American
Dermatology Association recommends us
to use a sunblock of at least SPF 15 (15
times the normal protection from the sun) and also
recommends that individuals augment that protec
tion with the use of hats, sunglasses, beach umbrel
las and appropriate clothing to cover up during pro
longed sun exposure.
