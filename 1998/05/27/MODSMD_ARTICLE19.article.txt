Using radio-frequency energy to shrink the soft
palate allows loud snorers to sleep better, according
to a recent study by Nelson Powell, a Stanford sleep
specialist.
Powell, co-director of the Stanford Sleep Disor
ders Research Center, said that the relatively pain
less outpatient procedure quickly shrank soft tis
sues in the mouth that obstruct breathing during
sleep. Obstruction of breathing is a major factor in
causing loud snoring.
The 22 men and women participating in the
study appeared to improve their snoring problems
by 77 percent on a standardized snoring scale. They
also said they slept better after the treatments. The
treatment appears to have no side effects.
According to Powell, who is also a head-and
neck surgeon and clinical associate professor of psy
chiatry and behavioral sciences, "the importance of
this study is that we showed we were able to give
the energy safely, with minimal pain. And patients
felt better. They didn't snore, which helped them
socially."
The tissue-shrinking procedure uses a small
wand containing an electrode that emits low-level
radio-frequency energy. The energy causes the
molecules of the soft palate tissue cells to vibrate,
heating the tissue up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
The heat destroys some of the cells in the tissue,
shrinking it and alleviating snoring.
This procedure has routinely been performed in
other areas to correct various medical problems
such as heart rhythm irregularities, cranial nerve
problems and enlarged prostates. Using this tech
nique, the radio-frequency energy can be targeted
very specifically.
All of the patients in the study group showed
major improvements in their snoring after the
procedure. The 18 men and four women all
snored enough to cause social problems and
chronic fatigue. On a snoring scale of 1 to 10, the
patients averaged 8.3 before the treatment,
which is so loud that other people cannot sleep
in the same room. After the treatment, the aver
age score dropped to 1.9.
