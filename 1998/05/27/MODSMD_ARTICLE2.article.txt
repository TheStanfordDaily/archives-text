It's too bad they were all yelling, "GEORGIA, GEORGIA!"
In the end, though, the crowd couldn't do a thing because the Cardi
nal rolled over the Bulldogs in their own stadium, 4-0 in the finals of the
NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship.
Stanford's men's tennis, for the fourth consecutive year and 16th
time, won the championships yesterday in Athens, Ga.
Stanford was the clear favorite going into the tournament, but the
Georgia crowd wasn't going to let the Cardinal forget whose home
courts it was playing on.
Before the match, however, players and family said they did not feel
the crowd would factor in too much in the matches.

Sophomores Mike and Bob Bryan show their enthusiasm in the process of earning a victory. The Bryans'
victories yesterday helped the Card earn its fourth straight NCAA title, setting a record for most con
secutive titles by a school.
the team would he prepared.
"Stanford's the kind of team
that thrives on the crowd whether
they're [rooting] for them or not,"
she said. "They get up for the big
moments. This is what they work
for the entire year. They're ready
to go."
Freshman Ali Ansari also felt
good about the team's prospects
before today's matchups.
"We're playing our best tennis
of the year by far," Ansari. "I think
we're going to play some great ten
nis today. The crowd is going to be
in everybody's head, but we're
going to be focused. It's nothing we
haven't seen before."
Bob Bryan even said playing in
front of so many opposing fans
helps, because he feeds off the
crowd's energy.
"If you're going to be in the fi
nals, you definitely want to play
Georgia," he said. "It was awesome
playing in front of the Georgia
fans."
Stanford beat the Bulldogs ear
lier this year in the National Team
Indoor Championships. That loss
was one of only three losses Geor
gia suffered this season.
The other two were to LSU,
whom they defeated Monday to
reach the finals against Stanford.
The Stanford-Georgia match also
marked one of only two dual
matches in which Stanford lost a
point to an opposing team.
Stanford's final dual-match
record stands at 28-0, with a 39-
match winning streak — the
longest in Stanford history.
The Cardinal claimed the dou
bles point first, jumping out to a tl
-0 lead.
At second doubles, senior cap
tain Paul Goldstein and junior
Ryan Wolters were first off the
courts, rolling over Bulldog junior
Hisham Hemeda and freshman
Sherif Zaher by a score of 8-2.
Mike and Bob Bryan, ranked t
No. 4 in the nation, took on the top
ranked doubles team in the nation,
seniors Steven Baldas and John
Roddick.
The twins struggled early in the
proset with Bob Bryan losing his
serve, putting the Georgia team
ahead to 4-2.
But at 7-6, the Bryans broke
back to even it out to 7-7.
However, that match was not
completed because sophomore
Geoff Abrams and senior Charles
Hoeveler emerged victorious in
their match at third doubles, negat
ing the necessity for them to finish

the match.
Abrams and Hoeveler defeated
Michael Lang and Joey Pitts 8-4 to
clinch the doubles point for Stan
ford.
Despite the loss of the doubles
point, the Georgia crowd was
pulling for its team before the start
of the singles competition. But the
ball kids on the sidelines didn't
seem to mind Stanford, as they
tried to copy the trademark Bryan
chest bump.
As the singles matches began,
the crowd quieted and Stanford
took command over the match.
Bob Bryan was again the first
player off the court with a win
against Baldas, 6-1,6-4, at third sin
gles.
Bryan had lost to Baldas two
times previously this year.
"He had beaten me pretty badly
before both times," Bryan said. "I
think revenge was definitely moti
vation for me."
Both Baldas and Georgia head
coach Manuel Diaz said Bryan
played an incredible match.
"It wasn't a tactical difference
(in today's match)," Diaz said. "It
was just today that Bob played a lit
tle better.
Goldstein took on Roddick at
the top spot, and the two players
traded breaks for the first four
games of the match.
Then Roddick pulled ahead to
win the set, and Goldstein could
not win any games on his serve.
In the second set, Goldstein bat
tled it out with Roddick, but the
match was suspended.
At the fifth singles position,
Abrams had an easy match over
Joey Pitts, winning 6-3,6-0.
To clinch the match, Mike
Bryan defeated Hisham Hemeda
in two sets, 7-5,6-3.
"Bob and Mike just played
tremendous matches," Diaz said.
"They both had great days."
Wolters' match with Tito Cor
rales and Kim's match with Zaher
were both suspended, but both
Cardinal players were up a set
when play was stopped.
"I think we're all at peace with
ourselves," Diaz said. "We all
know we competed with as much
heart and as much willpower as we
had."
Baldas said Stanford's play was
simply better than Georgia's and
that they deserved to win the
match.
"I think our team had the poten
tial to beat Stanford today," he
said.
"We had belief in ourselves and
we had belief in our program, but
they had great matches today.
They deserve all the credit they

have had. I don't think we could
have done anything differently to
change the outcome.
"We believed we could win the
match today, but they were just too
good," Diaz said. "We just got
beaten today."
Goldstein said he was more than
pleased with winning the champi
onship and winning four consecu
tive titles.
He managed to take home a title
each year that he competed at
Stanford.
"I didn't even hope for [winning
four in a row], never in my wildest
dreams," Goldstein said.
"More importantly, it's not only
winning four in row but being part
of the teams, especially this group.
It's been so much fun."
The squad's steady confidence
played a key role in pushing it to
the title.
"We were scared of every team,
but we were confident in each
other," Mike Bryan said. "We defi
nitely played our best tennis."
With the close of the season,
Gould finally admitted that this
year's team is the best team he has
ever coached and expressed his sat
isfaction at its performance in the
NCAA championships.
"I must say," he said, "my guys
were playing great tennis."

record stands at 28-0, with a 39-
match winning streak — the
longest in Stanford history.
The Cardinal claimed the dou
bles point first, jumping out to a tl
-0 lead.
At second doubles, senior cap
tain Paul Goldstein and junior
Ryan Wolters were first off the
courts, rolling over Bulldog junior
Hisham Hemeda and freshman
Sherif Zaher by a score of 8-2.
Mike and Bob Bryan, ranked t
No. 4 in the nation, took on the top
ranked doubles team in the nation,
seniors Steven Baldas and John
Roddick.
The twins struggled early in the
proset with Bob Bryan losing his
serve, putting the Georgia team
ahead to 4-2.
But at 7-6, the Bryans broke
back to even it out to 7-7.
However, that match was not
completed because sophomore
Geoff Abrams and senior Charles
Hoeveler emerged victorious in
their match at third doubles, negat
ing the necessity for them to finish

the match.
Abrams and Hoeveler defeated
Michael Lang and Joey Pitts 8-4 to
clinch the doubles point for Stan
ford.
Despite the loss of the doubles
point, the Georgia crowd was
pulling for its team before the start
of the singles competition. But the
ball kids on the sidelines didn't
seem to mind Stanford, as they
tried to copy the trademark Bryan
chest bump.
As the singles matches began,
the crowd quieted and Stanford
took command over the match.
Bob Bryan was again the first
player off the court with a win
against Baldas, 6-1,6-4, at third sin
gles.
Bryan had lost to Baldas two
times previously this year.
"He had beaten me pretty badly
before both times," Bryan said. "I
think revenge was definitely moti
vation for me."
Both Baldas and Georgia head
coach Manuel Diaz said Bryan
played an incredible match.
"It wasn't a tactical difference
(in today's match)," Diaz said. "It
was just today that Bob played a lit
tle better.
Goldstein took on Roddick at
the top spot, and the two players
traded breaks for the first four
games of the match.
Then Roddick pulled ahead to
win the set, and Goldstein could
not win any games on his serve.
In the second set, Goldstein bat
tled it out with Roddick, but the
match was suspended.
At the fifth singles position,
Abrams had an easy match over
Joey Pitts, winning 6-3,6-0.
To clinch the match, Mike
Bryan defeated Hisham Hemeda
in two sets, 7-5,6-3.
"Bob and Mike just played
tremendous matches," Diaz said.
"They both had great days."
Wolters' match with Tito Cor
rales and Kim's match with Zaher
were both suspended, but both
Cardinal players were up a set
when play was stopped.
"I think we're all at peace with
ourselves," Diaz said. "We all
know we competed with as much
heart and as much willpower as we
had."
Baldas said Stanford's play was
simply better than Georgia's and
that they deserved to win the
match.
"I think our team had the poten
tial to beat Stanford today," he
said.
"We had belief in ourselves and
we had belief in our program, but
they had great matches today.
They deserve all the credit they

have had. I don't think we could
have done anything differently to
change the outcome.
"We believed we could win the
match today, but they were just too
good," Diaz said. "We just got
beaten today."
Goldstein said he was more than
pleased with winning the champi
onship and winning four consecu
tive titles.
He managed to take home a title
each year that he competed at
Stanford.
"I didn't even hope for [winning
four in a row], never in my wildest
dreams," Goldstein said.
"More importantly, it's not only
winning four in row but being part
of the teams, especially this group.
It's been so much fun."
The squad's steady confidence
played a key role in pushing it to
the title.
"We were scared of every team,
but we were confident in each
other," Mike Bryan said. "We defi
nitely played our best tennis."
With the close of the season,
Gould finally admitted that this
year's team is the best team he has
ever coached and expressed his sat
isfaction at its performance in the
NCAA championships.
"I must say," he said, "my guys
were playing great tennis."
