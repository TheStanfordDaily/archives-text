# Ammonia ups nicotine addiction
## Tobacco industry intentionally freebases cigarettes, professor testifies 
### Caroline Roberts 
In a recent Minnesota lawsuit against the tobacco
industry. Chemical Engineering Prof. Channing
Robertson testified that tobacco companies add
ammonia to cigarettes to enhance the addictiveness
of tobacco.
As an expert for the prosecution, Robertson, a
pioneer in the field of drug delivery design, examined
internal tobacco industry documents for evidence
that cigarettes were intentionally designed as nicotine
delivery devices. During the trial, Robertson uncov
ered a history of conspiracy, deceit and fraud by
tobacco companies.
Robertson's most striking finding was that tobacco
companies add ammonia to their cigarettes in order
to improve nicotine absorption by the brain. Despite
industry testimony to the contrary, documents
reviewed by Robertson show that executives knew
that nicotine is addictive and that cigarettes are
essentially nicotine delivery devices.
Robertson was given access to a vault containing
"category 2" documents, ultra-secret files detailing
the precise formulas for each brand of cigarette made
by the five major tobacco companies during the past
25 years. These were "the crown jewels of some of the
largest companies in the Western, if not the entire,
world," Robertson said. "It was very, very secret."
By examining these documents he was able to
ascertain that companies were manipulating the
chemical composition of their cigarettes to enhance
nicotine absorption and increase the speed that it
reaches the brain.
Specifically, they used ammonia compounds to
raise the pH of the smoke, making it more alkaline.
This changed the chemical form of nicotine from a
salt to a free base. This process is identical to "free
basing" cocaine, where the salt form — which is nor
mally snorted — is changed to a free base and
burned.
This is the "crack" form of cocaine, which crosses
more easily across physiological membranes. Tobac
co companies use the same process to enable rapid
nicotine entry into the bloodstream. This enhances
addictiveness.
Like cocaine, nicotine is an alkaloid drug that
binds with receptors in the brain, causing the release
of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is a
component of the pleasure response system in the

brain. When a longtime smoker tries to quit, the
dopamine circuit, desensitized by nicotine overstimu
lation, requires high levels of dopamine to feel "nor
mal." This need for dopamine is manifested in the
smoker in the form of nicotine cravings and con
tributes to the difficulty of quitting.
Tobacco companies have recognized the impor
tance of addicting their consumers for decades. W.L.
Dunn of Philip Morris Inc. wrote in a 1%9 memo:
"Perhaps this is the key phrase: the reinforcing mech
anism of cigarette smoking. If we understand it. we
are potentially more able to upgrade our product."
By 1972, Dunn had pinpointed this "reinforcing
mechanism" as nicotine and redefined the tobacco
industry as a "nicotine industry," stating that "the
cigarette should be conceived not as a product but as
a package. The product is nicotine."
Nicotine is a naturally occurring insecticide pro
duced in the leaves of tobacco plants. Although toxic
in high doses, it is not the primary cause of smoking
related illness. The lung diseases commonly associat
ed with cigarette smoking, such as cancer and emphy
sema, are primarily caused by tar, the particles we see
as smoke.
Meanwhile, the government was trying to raise
awareness of the harmfulness of cigarette smoke by
requiring companies to list the tar and nicotine levels
of their cigarettes in advertisements and on cartons.

In response, tobacco
companies looked for
ways to lower tar while
keeping nicotine levels
high enough to maintain
addiction.
As early as 1963, a
British American Tobac
co Industries pic. memo
states that "we can regu
late, fairly precisely, the
nicotine and sugar levels
to almost any desired
level management might
require." The problem,
however, was lowering
tar without lowering

nicotine. As Robertson said. "Tar is the hundreds of
thousands of components of cigarette smoke; nico
tine is just one of them ... and when you lower tar
you also lower nicotine."
Where there's a will — and a profit — there's a
way. A 1976 Lorillard memo pinpoints the alterna
tives the industry faced: "... either increase the abso
lute yield of delivered nicotine, or increase the pH.
which increases the 'apparent' nicotine content with
out changing the absolute amount."
The most financially successful strategy has been
to use ammonia. Philip Morris' Marlboro was the first
major brand to capitalize on ammonia during the
19705. It rapidly gained market share from R.J
Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s Winston and left other com
panies scrambling to catch up.
"All evidence indicates that the relatively high
smoke pH (high alkalinity) shown by Marlboro ... is
deliberate and controlled." one 1973 R.J. Reynolds
memo reads.
"Higher peak concentrations of nicotine in the
blood were achieved at higher pHs ... [these] results
indicate that the higher the pH. the more rapidly
nicotine enters the bloodstream," according to a 1994
Philip Morris memo.
"Ammonia compounds were among the top 10 by
weight of ingredients added to cigarettes in the for
mulas." Robertson said. "Why were they increasing
the pH of the smoke? Because they were freebasing
the American public. So they were in the midst of
saying "we're lowering tar and nicotine.' hut chemi
cally changing the form of nicotine to make it more
biologically available."
The Minnesota trial ended with a settlement, per
petuating the no-conviction record of the tobacco
industry. From the evidence revealed by the thousands
of internal industry memos, one thing remains clear.
According to Robertson, tobacco companies
deliberately and thoughtfully addicted millions of
Americans and simultaneously orchestrated an elab
orate public relations campaign designed to foster
controversy and confusion regarding the health
effects of cigarettes.
