# University nurtures corporate spinoffs

### Lynne Mercer Contributing writer 
It is the stuff that dreams are made of.
Two young men set up shop in a garage
and end up founding a major corporation,
becoming rich beyond their wildest
dreams.
Many at Stanford are familiar with the
tale of ingenuity and good fortune that
led to the founding of the Hewlett-
Packard Corporation. It would be
remarkable enough if it happened only
once. In fact, start-up companies have
spun off from Stanford many times over.
And these companies have changed, in
fundamental ways, the very structure of
the society we live in.
It is no exaggeration to say that the
computer industry owes much of its suc
cess. perhaps its very existence, to Stan
ford. So significant have Stanford's contri
butions been that one building alone,
Margaret Jacks Hall, directly spawned
Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems and Sil
icon Graphics.
Just as Silicon Valley, the heart of
the computer industry, had its origins at
Stanford, so too did the biotechnology
industry and. more recently, the Inter
net revolution.
When Dr. Stanley Cohen of Stanford
and Dr. Herbert Hover of UC-San Fran
cisco met at a conference in Waikiki,
Hawaii, the seeds of recombinant DNA
cloning technology were sown. After just
four months of collaboration, the pair suc
ceeded in cloning their first DNA. The
results, published in 1973. launched an
entirely new industry. Although it tix>k
eight years to patent the technology, it

was eventually made available to the
biotechnology industry. Enormous public
benefit resulted from the technology,
including the development of new drugs
such as human insulin, which is used to
treat diabetes.

owners.
More recently, Stanford was again at
the forefront of new technology as the
Internet exploded. According to John
Henncssy, dean of the Schix>l of Engi

neering. key protocols for Internet tech
nology were designed at Stanford.
Later, electrical engineering graduate
students Jerry Yang and David Filo. Kith
avid Web surfers, developed Yahoo! for
their own personal use.

-i In a lecture in the Lead
ership Edge Series. Hen
nessv described how. sud
denly. Stanford's network
ing bill surged as half of the
traffic on the Stanford Web
site was from people outside
the University using
Yahoo!. "The thing that sur
prised us is how quickly the
technology was grasped by
the non-technology nerds of
the world."
According to Hennessy.
Stanford's role in the devel
opment of modern technol
ogy began with the appoint
ment of Frederick Terman
as University president.
Terman was a visionary
who fostered entrepeneur
ship and technical excel
lence. He brought David
Packard and William
Hewlett together, loaned
them $538 to produce an
audio oscillator, and encour
aged them to form their own
i company.
Frustrated with the
shortage of jobs on the West

Coast for Stanford engineering graduates.
Terman was also the driving force behind
the establishment of Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. One of the world's first

industrial parks, it was unique in the close
collaboration it fostered between aca
demie research and industry.
The impact of Stanford spinoff com
panies has been staggering. In an
attempt to quantify their scope and
economic impact on the San Francisco
Bay Area economy, Stanford's Office
of Technology Licensing commissioned
a study of technology-based companies
founded by current or previous faculty,
staff and students at Stanford.
Three hundred fifteen full-time
companies. 47 companies that have
undergone a merger or acquisition, and
51 businesses that had ceased to exist
are profiled in the report, which reads
like a "who's who" in corporate Amer
ica. Included are some of the giants ol
modern industry: Adobe. Calgene.
Cetus. DNAX. Hewlett-Packard, Intu
it. Nike. Silicon Graphics. Spectra
Physics. Sun Microsystems, Tandem
Computers. Varian Associates, and too
many others to be named.
The results, compiled in IW2. provid
ed an estimate of approximately I.(n >
small technology companies (KM) or fewer
employees) and 88 large companies
(greater than 1(X) employees), which
together contributed an aggregate of
approximately $31 billion in revenue to
the area.
"Stanford is the envy of the world in
regard to bringing people from all over
the world." Hennessv said.
"The fact that this is the information
technology center of the world is
tremendously important lor us when
recruiting students and faculty. They
want to be here."
