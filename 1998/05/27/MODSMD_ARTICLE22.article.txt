## Rethinking the up-and-down season Eule pontificates on baseball's year 
### 
1 had the chance to talk with a
mentor of mine from Los Angeles
the other night. He pulled me over
and asked me if 1 really wanted to be
a sportswriter.
"Brian," he said. "You have to be
ruthless to get ahead. 11 you're not.
vou get stepped on. That's why 1
want to get out of this business."
1 had heard it before, although
not from him. For a non-aggressive
type like myself, this was something
that could pose a problem.

If 1 were ruthless, I would be
moaning about our baseball team. I
would whine about how there was
more talent on this team than any
other team 1 have seen this year. 1
would describe the bewilderment of
seeing such an incredible team lose
six out of its last seven games after
not having lost two games in a row all
year.
But I can't.
I feel more of a passive disap
pointment. I am in a state of shock.
This was the Dream Team. There is
little doubt in my mind that several
of the names I have been writing
about all year will wind upon the ros
ters of major league teams, perhaps
even all-star teams.
' What went wrong?
Coach Mark Marquess runs a
tight ship. His 22 years of experience
and two national championships tes
tify to that fact. The players on this
team are good kids. They are polite,
professional and talented. Marquess
said they are also not as emotional as
other teams he has coached. They
don't go on roller-coaster rides of ex
citement and anger.
I guess those roller-coaster rides
are reserved for the offensive pro
duction. How can a team score 19
runs in one game in the NCAA Re
gional and then barely scrape up one
the following day? To tell the truth. I
have no idea what happened. Mar
quess said it all when he remarked

that the greatness of a team is judged
in the postseason — getting hot at
the right time. It's a shame for this
team, he added, but it's reality.
It was simply assumed that Stan
ford. ranked No.l for the entire reg
ular season, would make the trip to
the College World Series. To tell the
truth. 1 thought I would be on my
way to Omaha, Neb., right now.
I had heard of the excitement in
the town's annual event and couldn't
help but let my imagination run away
with me. 1 could see the CBS an
nouncers vividly.
"We are now joined by a Stanford
sportswriter," Jon Miller would say
before America. "Brian, what can
you tell me about this team?"
"Well, Jon," I would say, sound
ing as slick as Vince Scully. "There is
an abundance of talent and personal
ity on this team. You have football
players, academic geniuses, guys
who spend their free time working
for SURE Escort and more,"
OK, so may ie the CBS thing is a
bit out of hand, but my point is that I
was already making plans to go to
Omaha. One writer I know had al
ready bought his plane ticket. It was
practically a given that I would have
to figure out a way to reschedule my
finals and a way to enjoy spending a
week in Nebraska.
I just don't know what happened.
Arizona State is going, USC is going,
and these are two teams that
couldn't wrestle the division title
away from the Cardinal.
My grandparents sent me an e
mail (we are in an incredible age of
tech|*fltegy)i*ffftfcT -We
looked in our sports part of the paper
today to see how Stanford made
out," they wrote.
"Sorry to see they lost to Long
Beach. Hey, but they put up a good
fight all season. They are still one of
the top teams. Accept our condo
lences. As we used to say regarding
the Brooklyn Dodgers, 'Wait 'till
next year!'"
With baseball's draft around the
corner, many will be gone by next
season. This was Stanford's year, and
somehow, the Cardinal blew it. I am
incredibly disappointed, but I can't
scold this team because I just don't
know how. Maybe I would if I were
ruthless.
