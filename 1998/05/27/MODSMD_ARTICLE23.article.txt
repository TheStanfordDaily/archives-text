## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Seniors Ania Bleszynski and Julie Scott both
earned yet another All-American title yesterday,
advancing to the national quarterfinals in singles
with two wins in the second and third rounds.
The pair of seniors also teamed up to advance
to the third round in the doubles draw, beating
Virginia Commonwealth's team of Martina
Nedelkova and Andrea Ondrisova in a tight two
set match, 6-4,7-6 (6).
Bleszynski captured two upset wins over seed
ed opponents to move into the quarterfinals in
singles for the third time in her career, and Scott
pulled off an incredible comeback in the third
round to make a second straight appearance in
the final 16.
"It's nice because I was [All-American] my
first two years, and I wasn't last year," Bleszynski
said. "I kind of reasserted myself this year. That
was one thing which I thought about during the
second set, and it kept me going. It's nice, but it's
just a title."
In her first match, Bleszynski met 9-16 seed
Cristina Moros, one of Texas's top singles players
over the last four years. The Stanford senior over
whelmed Moros with her serve and outlasted the
Longhorn in a tie-break thriller, 5-7,6-2,7-6 (3).
"I served well, and that helped me a lot,"
Bleszynski said. "I knew that I had to stay in the
match even if I was losing because she is kind of an
off-and-on player."
Facing a two-game deficit late in the third set,
Bleszynski wouldn't quit.
"This was my last NCAA tournament, and I
didn't want to go down without trying," she said.
"At 3-5 in the third set, I just tried to push on. She
missed a few, and I got back into it. At the begin
ning of the tie breaker, I told myself, 'Don't be
nervous, just go for the shots,' and my forehand
winner on the first point of the tie breaker really
helped me out. I was okay from there on out."
Moros agreed that Bleszynski's serve was the
difference.
"She served unbelievably, and I couldn't do
much with her serve," Moros said. "Once I got
into the point, I tried to play aggressively, but it
was just a matter of getting that return back. In the
end, she just played a little bit better than I did.
She picked up her game a little, and there was re
ally nothing else I could do."
In the following round. Bleszynski shocked an
even higher seed. No. 7 Holly Parkinson from
Brigham Young. Riding the momentum of her
tie-break win, Bleszynski rolled over Parkinson in
straight sets, 6-2,6-1.
"I think I played well," Bleszynski said. "I
think I had the game in hand at my pace. I forced
her to go from baseline to baseline and tried to tire
her out. I served well and played a lot better than
I did this morning."
Bleszynski will face yet another high seed in to
morrow's quarterfinal match. California's Aman
da Augustus, the No. 3 seed in the draw and the
fifth-ranked player in the nation, went 1-1 against

the Cardinal in two dual matches in the No. 1 sin
gles position.
Scott, who reached the semifinals in last sea
'sorfs*angles'cTraw. opened with a blowout win in
the second round. Ohio State's Kristi Dascoli was
no match for Stanford's 9-16 seed as Scott cruised
to a 6-0,6-2 win.
Her third round match up with Tulsa's
Anoushlka Van Exel proved to be much tougher.
Van Exel got off to a great start, taking the first set
and leading 3-1 in the second. But the senior cap
tain bounced back in incredible fashion, forcing a
split and going on to win, 4-6,6-3.6-0.
"I guess it shows me that you are never out of a
match," Scott said. "You can lose the first set and
be down 1-3 in the second, but you just have to
stay focused and remain confident, and every
thing will turn out OK."
Scott credited her opponent for the strong
start.
"Van Exel was really tough." she said. "The
first set she was dictating the play and was not

missing at all. I realized what I was doing wasn't
working, so I started attacking and dictating play
a little more and forced her to make some more
errors."
In tomorrow's quarterfinal, Scott will be the
underdog as she faces the draw's No. 1 seed, fresh
man Mirela Vladulescu. A native of Leinen. Ger
many. Vladulescu is currently No. 2 in the nation
in singles.
However, it was not all roses for the Cardinal,
as sophomore Teryn Ashley's season came to a
close yesterday in a 6-3,6-3 upset loss to Wiscon
sin's Barbara Urbanska.
In the doubles draw, Bleszynski and Scott can
double up their All-American honors if they can
defeat William & Mary's top doubles squad of
Lauren Nikolaus and Michelle O in the third
round. The two teams did meet early this season
in an October tournament, with Nikolaus and O
emerging with a 7-5,6-4 win.
Last season. Bleszynski and Scott reached the
NCAA semifinals before being eliminated.
