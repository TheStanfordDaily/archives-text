Men s Golf
Junior Joel Kribel will be going
solo at the NCAA men's golf cham
pionships beginning today in New
Mexico. Kribel qualified at the
NCAA West Regionals last week
end. Accompanied by coach Wally
Goodwin, Kribel shot a 65 to earn a
berth at the Championship Golf
Course in Albuquerque, N.M.
Kribel was the leader of the golf
team all year, finishing with a team
high nine top-10 finishes. He won
the Ping Arizona Intercollegiate
Tournament, improving every day

with a career-best 13-under-par 200
(68-67-65). After a slow start, Kri
bel's victory in Arizona launched a
string of top-10 finishes, interrupted
only by the Masters.
"I didn't have a very good fall
season," Kribel said. "To come out
and win the first spring tournament
was great."
After missing the U.S. Intercol
legiate because of the Masters in
Augusta, Gaâ€ž where he missed the
cut by a stroke, Kribel took second
at the Pac-lOs with a four-round
final score of 285.
