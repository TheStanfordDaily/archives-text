## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
Cradling his coffee mug as he contemplat
ed answers. Statistics Prof. Brad Efron glad
ly engaged in an honest and lively discussion
of his plans as chair of next year's Faculty
Senate.
He said that he welcomed the opportuni
ty to serve as chair.
Efron, however, was quick to dismiss the
chair's influence over the meetings.
During the meetings, "a chaii is as impor
tant as a conductor waiving a wand — not

very important," he said.
Efron said he hopes to "give faculty a
chance to say honestly and clearly what they
feel about difficult issues" while he is in this
post.
The teaching-research balance controver
sy is one of the issues Efron and the Senate
Steering Committee will likely place on sen
ate agendas next year.
"Stanford really hires people to have in
ternationally recognized academic careers;
balancing that with teaching is a source of
constant tension." Efron said.
Efron stressed that he is pleased with the

results of this ongoing discussion, citing Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper's funding
of freshman seminars as an example of the
current administration's effort to facilitate
better teaching.
Among other issues. Efron hopes the sen
ate will discuss faculty lifestyle, housing and
affirmative action at the tenure level.
Faculty members and students are wel
come to provide input as to which issues are
addressed, Efron said.
"I hope we have more of that — it's
healthy." he added.
Efron brings a great deal of experience to

his new position, having served on the sec
ond Faculty Senate as a junior faculty mem
ber about 30 years ago.
As a senator. Efron has been active in tht
Advisory Board, which handles promotion
tenure and discipline cases.
As last year's Advisory Board chair
Efron oversaw hearings regarding Psychia
try Prof. Adolph Pfefferbaum and then-Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta.
Pfefferbaum is fighting his dismissal lrom
the University.
