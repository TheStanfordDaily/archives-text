# Moon Bean's feeds Green caffeine needs
## 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Sleep-deprived students at
Green Library no longer have to
trek across campus to refuel on
caffeine. Moon Bean's Cafe out
side Green opened yesterday after
several months of construction and
planning.
The kiosk will be open from
7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Prices range
from $1.25 for a single espresso to
around $3 for freezes. Lattes, mo
chas and cappuccinos are all about
$2.
Though the kiosk is open for
business this week, the official
grand opening will not occur until
Monday. "This week is a test week
for employees, to get everything
up to speed." co-owner Brian
Reynolds explained.
Owners plan to make further
improvements to the facility soon.
According to Reynolds, seating
should be constructed in a couple
of weeks, and the business also
plans to make a menu and obtain
coffee dispensers to improve the
cafe's appearance. The cafe is still
deciding what food items to offer
patrons.
Students and staff have lauded

the convenience of the stand as its
most attractive aspect. "1 like it so
far," said sophomore Karsten
Schoellner. "It's between the two
libraries, and if you need caffeine
you only have to walk 10 feet."
Employees of Green were also
excited about the opening of the
stand. "Its proximity to the library
will be quite nice since I work at
the library," Archives Specialist
Pat White said.
Reynolds hopes students will
not only visit the cafe because of its
convenience but also for the quali
ty of its products. "We want every
one to come try our coffee," he
said. "It's some of the best coffee
on campus."
Managers at the Coffee House,
Moon Bean's main competition on
campus, don't expect the opening
of the stand to change much since
the facilities attract customers for
different reasons.
"I think it's a good idea, but it
won't really affect things around
here too much." Asst. Manager
Rebecca Gould said. "It will not
have the kind of hangout atmos
phere here even if it's more conve
nient. They don't really have the
capacity to have events or night
time extravaganzas."
