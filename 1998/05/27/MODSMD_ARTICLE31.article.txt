# New ASSU Senate meets
## Sophomore Adam Weiss elected chair for 1998-99 year 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
It was a fresh start for the ASSU
Senate as the first meeting of the
third senate was called to order last
night at the Law School.
The meeting was the first official
gathering for the 30 senators elect
ed last month and for next year's
president and vice president,
Maren Norton and Santos Marro
quin.
The two senates — this year's
and next year's — are, at this point,
noticeably different. The most ob
vious testimony to this difference is
attendance.
All but one senator — who was
"on the other side of the country,"
according to Marroquin — were

present last night, a stark contrast
to the miserable turnouts in recent
meetings of the old senate. It has
struggled to make quorum in most
of its meetings this quarter.
Sophomore and second-year
Senator Adam Weiss was elected
senate chair for the coming year.
The chair runs the senate meetings
following parliamentary proce
dure.
"I think I know basically the ins
and outs of the ASSU Senate,"
Weiss said.
"One of the most frustrating
things for new senators is that there
are so many obstacles to imple
menting their projects," he said.
"My goal is to make sure that
doesn't happen."
Weiss ran against a new senator,

Bobby Beaver, a sophomore.
Weiss cited his perfect senate at
tendance for this year in his brief
campaign speech before the senate.
"I feel that the two most impor
tant roles of the senate chair are
one. to be fair, and two, to be effi
cient," he said.
The deputy chair will be elected
at the second meeting of the new
senate next week. The deputy chair
runs the senate during the chair's
absence and makes a report at each
meeting.
Senior Matt Garlinghouse will
replact Don Coleman as next
year's financial manager.
Norton was eager to be getting
the senate off the ground.
"I never thought the actual first
meeting would finally come," she

said, introducing the meeting.
She and Marroquin have not
wasted any time in getting down to
business. Norton spent the begin
ning of the meeting encouraging
the new senators to spread the
word about recent ASSU-related
activities: Tresidder Union's hours
have been extended to 2 a.m. as of
last night, and a graduate housing
rally is scheduled for tonight in the
Quad.
In preparation for the rally, T
shirts and buttons have been made,
and mass e-mails have been sent
out to various graduate student
lists.
The rally is intended as an all
night sleepout.
Marroquin commented, "Grad
students don't mess around."
