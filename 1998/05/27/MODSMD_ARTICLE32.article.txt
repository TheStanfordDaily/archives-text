Stanford students that are fo
cused on their futures don't have
trouble finding the means to pursue
their dreams.
The Undergraduate Research
Opportunities office awarded
$550,000 in grants this year to more
than 230 Stanford students doing
research. From this amount,
$70.000 was awarded in small
grants.
According to URO Director
Laura Selznick. "The faculty was
very pleased with the overall quali
ty of this year's applications."
The URO received a total of 323
applications, including 270 for
major grants.
Altogether. 188 students re
ceived major grants of up to $2,5(X),
and 46 received small grants of
$500.
However, several of the grants
are on hold, since some students still
have unresolved issues, Selznick

said. A portion of these students
don't have their faculty recommen
dations, "but we didn't want to pre
vent them front receiving grants, so
we put them on hold." she said.
Selznick added that Bing fellow
ships and other department-based
grants also helped some students, so
they did not receive grants through
the URO.
The money for the grants comes
from private donors and from an
endowment raised as a part of a
fund-raising campaign during Stan
ford's centennial celebration in
1991, as well as from anonymous
donors.
Receiving a grant can seem in
timidating, but it is "not meant to be
a big bureaucratic nightmare for
students," Selznick explained.
Faculty screen applications in
their departments, after which
Selznick and Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Ramon
Saldivar determine the final
awards.
To be successful, grant recipients

must plan ahead and be flexible,
Selznick explained. Students need a
good hypothesis that they can test.
"Just having an interesting topic
is not enough," Selznick added.
The difference between a major
and a small grant is fairly significant,
even though it usually does not
make a very big difference in the
amount of funding a project re
ceives.
A major grant is more academ
ically prestigious and must cover a
minimum of three quarters in pur
suit of an honor's thesis.
Although a small grant is worth
less money and is less academically
prestigious, Selznick said the URO
sometimes will provide extra fund
ing for travel.
The awards are often used to
cover living or travel expenses so
that students engaged in research
don't have to find a summer job.
Junior Laura Chyu. a human bi
ology major who received a major
grant to study the "socio-cultural
perceptions of diabetes in Aus

tralian Aborigines," hopes to go to
Australia to do field research.
"Finding contacts and planning the
project was hard since I'm obvious
ly not in Australia," she said.
Another major grant recipient,
junior biology major Peter Ham
merman, will construct a primate
genetic model for cystic fibrosis.
Hammerman plans to stay on cam
pus for his project.
"I was glad I received the
award," he said, because there were
a considerably greater number of
applications in the sciences.
A project that will be concentrat
ing more on the psychological as
pects of learning was also among
the major grant recipients. The ju
nior psychology major conducting
the research. Erik Thiessen, ex
plained that 18-month-old children
experience a great increase in vo
cabulary expansion.
"This might be caused by an at
tention deficit in younger children
or a physiological incapacity that we
are not aware of," he said.
