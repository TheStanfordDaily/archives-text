"Community@stanford" is a World Wide Web site
currently being built by two computer science students
who have taken it upon themselves to increase Stan
ford community awareness of events on campus.
The site, located at http://community.stanford.edu,
is scheduled to go up in the near future.
"I'm coding like mad on it right now," said sopho
more David Weekly, who co-produces the site along
with freshman Eric Silverburg. "This is my project. 1
was thinking around the beginning of the year it would
be great to automate things. Most dorm pages now are
pretty useless because it takes a lot of work to maintain
them."
Silverburg and Weekly began working on the site to
gether when they discovered they had a common dis
satisfaction with current services available to the stu
dents over the Web.
"1 came to Stanford with considerable background in
Web site construction and design," Silverburg said. "I
saw there was a need at Stanford for a centralized and
content-rich Web site such as 'Community@stanford. < "
All students and faculty members with valid SUNet
accounts will not only be able not only to customize the
site to meet their particular tastes and interests but will
also be able to post notices of upcoming events and
meetings.
"Basically, we felt this kind of Web site would be a
wonderful resource for Stanford because the people at
Stanford are very Web savvy," Silverburg explained.

"It would really bring about a greater sense of commu
nity on campus."
The content of the page will include information
pertaining to dormitories, classes and student groups,
while discussion forums and polls will allow students to
communicate.
"It's a centralized and integrated information
source. It's not just a place where students go to receive
information — they participate in it as well," Weekly
said. "I think it'll be a place that people will enjoy."
Weekly refutes the notion that the convenience of
the site will lead to a decrease in student interaction.
Rather, it will give students more opportunities to meet
others through events and discussion forums.
While Weekly and Silverburg are responsible for
the actual development of the site, they are currently
working with the ASSU, who will sponsor it. Next year,
information about the site will be distributed to fresh
men.
"Dave and I are currently in discussion with the
ASSU about partnering with them on the promotion of
the Web site, with the ultimate goal of having 'Commu
nity@stanford' a project of the ASSU," Silverburg said.
Silverburg affirmed that students and faculty will be
able to shape the site to fit their demands, not vice
versa.
" 'Community@stanford' is student initiated and
student run, and as such we're going to be as responsive
to the needs and suggestions of our users as possible,"
Silverburg said. "It's not just students — it's for faculty,
student groups. Basically, everyone that's a part of the
Stanford community can benefit from this site."
