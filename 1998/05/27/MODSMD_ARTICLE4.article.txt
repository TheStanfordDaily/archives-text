# Preserving academic resources
## Stanford reflects on 25 years of natural harmony at Jasper Ridge 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
While many students are un
aware of the existence of Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, re
searchers have called the preserve
one of Stanford's most important
academic resources.
Although other universities
have preserves, the academic op
portunity offered hv Jasper Ridge
is a resource unique to Stanford,
said the preserve's administrative

director. Philippe Cohen.
"There are other universities
with biological field stations, but
to my knowledge there are none
with a site as extensive and diverse
yet so accessible to the main cam
pus," he said.
Named for the red rock that
marks its premises, the ridge en
compasses more than 1,10() acres
and has been noted by the scientif
ic community for its remarkable
range of diversity.
Since being designated a pre

serve by the University in 1973,
the area has remained closed to
the general public except for visi
tors on docent-led tours.
The area has had a long history
of research, beginning in 18%.
when the first advanced degree
based on reserach at the preserve
was awarded.
Since then, the preserve has
been the basis for more than 2(H)
theses and is currently the subject
of 50 ongoing research projects
and 25 Stanford courses.

Research ranging from studies
of global change to Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich's renowned research
on the Bay checkerspot butterfly
has been conducted on the
grounds of Jasper Ridge.
"It is an unusual opportunity
for ecological research." said Deb
orah Gordon, an associate biology
professor who is conducting re
search on the invasion of Argen
tine ants on the preserve. "There

are very, very few places like
Jasper Ridge."
The preserve's proximity to
campus is one of its most unique
features, Gordon added.
"It is amazing that we can be in
a relatively urban area and still
have access to a place like Jasper
Ridge." she said.
"Any student can be there with
in minutes. It is a pocket of an
undisturbed area."
As part of the festivities mark
ing the preserve's birthday. Jasper
Ridge opened its gates on May 17,
the first opening to the general
public sinceits founding 25 years
ago.
During "Jasper Ridge Discov
ery Day," more than 3.IKX) curious
guests took the opportunity to
visit, talk with docents or visit the
24 research stations manned by
guides.
The success of the day and the

interest generated by the event
prompted some visitors to call for
more frequent openings of the
area.
But Cohen said events like Dis
covery Day are unlikely to happen
more than every five years.
"Besides the disruption to re
search and educational activities
such events create — which are
balanced by the education that oc
curs — the work load and logistics,
not to mention cost, are simply too
onerous to pull off on an annual
basis," he said.
Cohen added that openings
such as Discovery Day demand a
considerable amount of time from
the preserve's researchers and do
cents. all of whom are volunteers.
But docents stress that the de
bate over opening up the preserve
detracts from the area's greatest
value: as a research area free from
human impact.
"It is not the main purpose of
the preserve to have a free for all,"
said sophomore Emily Johnson.
"The key point is that the preserve

is not closed to the public. There
are many ways to get involved."
Currently, more than 2,000 peo
ple visit the ridge each year on do
cent-led tours. Students can he
come involved in research on the
preserve or become docents or
rangers.
Rangers patrol the preserve for
security reasons, while docents
provide tours to the public. Do
cents must take a two-quarter class
— Biology %A / B — which exam
ines the natural history and re
search of the site.
Currently, there are 90 docents,
19 of whom are Stanford students.
Student docents — from both
scientific and non-scientific back
grounds — enthusiastically praise
the job as something outside nor
mal classroom work.
"A lot of people don't know
how accessible the ridge is." said
junior Melissa Kcnn. an art history
major. "Anyone can call up and get
a tour. It has been a saving grace
for me that 1 can go and be out
doors."
