While many students are un

Ridge Biological Preserve, re
searchers have called the preserve
one of Stanford's most important
academic resources.
Although other universities
have preserves, the academic op

is a resource unique to Stanford,
said the preserve's administrative

Named for the red rock that

The area has had a long history

when the first advanced degree
based on reserach at the preserve
was awarded.
Since then, the preserve has

theses and is currently the subject
of 50 ongoing research projects
and 25 Stanford courses.

Research ranging from studies

grounds of Jasper Ridge.
"It is an unusual opportunity

professor who is conducting re
search on the invasion of Argen
