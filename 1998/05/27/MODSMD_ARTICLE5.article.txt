Toyon Eating Clubs has in
creased efforts to gather student
support, hut the future of the inde
pendent dining service remains
uncertain due to University con
cerns about the location and con
dition of the building where the
clubs are currently housed.
According to Eating Clubs
President and General Manager
Nick Peters, the student organiza
tion has collected about 3(K) letters
from alumni describing their expe
riences with the clubs. In addition,
surveys asking for student com
ment on the clubs will be handed
out at a barbecue luau this Fridav
from 5:30 to 7 p.m. in the club's
courtyard.
Peters said he hoped such ef
forts would "help the University
realize how much students want
the eating clubs."
"They certainly provide an al
ternative food option that is some
what unique," said Keith Gun. di
rector of Housing and Dining Ser
vices.
Among the services currenth
offered by the clubs are a 24-hour
kitchen and numerous social pro
grams such as a semiformal boat
dance and ski trips.
Established in 1894. the clubs
are the second oldest student orga
nization on campus. Each of the
four clubs — Los Arcos. El
Cuadro. El Toro and Breakers Co
op — has two student managers.
Their duties range from ordering

food and helping
plan menus to or
ganizing social
events and han
dling finances.
"1 think it's a
unique tradition
on campus." said
doctoral student

Alberto Makino. kitchen manager
for Breakers Co-op. He added that
the club served as a social place for
graduate students that didn't exist
elsewhere on campus.
"It would be a very big loss to
the community." he said.
Guy emphasized the Universi
ty's commitment to student-man
aged services, but the eating clubs
facility, built in the early 19505,
was a major concern of the I niver
sity. he said.
"It's not the aesthetics of it. The
building needs help." Guy said,
praising the organization's efforts
to maintain the building but calling
it "a Band-Aid approach."
"I don't think our plumbing will
last." said Peters, adding that the
clubs have looked into a new
building but would need to raise
about $2 million for the new struc
ture.
He said the group was only al
lowed to ask alumni for money
during certain time periods due to
I Diversity restrictions.
"We don't have the manpower
or the time." Peters said.
The clubs would like the Uni
versity to set aside resources to


Guy
help them raise money for the
building.
But Guy also expressed reser
vations about the current location
of the clubs.
"As 1 understand it. that land is
a prime candidate for academic ex
pansion." he said.
Both parties agree that the issue
will be decided soon, as Toyon
Hall is scheduled to be renovated
as a part of the Capital Improve
ment Plan in the summer of 2000.
An option currently being con
sidered is the consolidation of the

dining program for Branner Hall
and Toyon.
Peters said the clubs would like
ly concentrate on serving graduate
students with its Breakers club if
such a program was instituted.
"The question is not whether
we can survive, but how we survive
and if we want to survive that
way." he said.
Guv said the University was
also looking into the possibility of
merging the clubs with services at
the Govenor's Corner residences.
Guv emphasized that analysis
of the situation was not yet com
plete. but said he expected a deci
sion to be made within the next 12
to 18 months.
