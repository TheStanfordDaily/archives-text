Police protected from law suits
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court
made it far more difficult for police to be sued by peo
ple who are hurt during high-speed chases, ruling that
pursuing officers can be held liable only if their actions
would "shock the conscience." The court ruled unan
imously yesterday against the parents of a California
teen-ager killed by a deputy sheriffs car. The new
standard is even more protective of police than one
some lower courts had employed — allowing such
lawsuits if police showed a "reckless disregard for life."
Justice David H. Souter, a former New Hampshire
prosecutor, wrote for the court that police are entitled
to considerable legal protection for the "split-second
judgments" their work demands.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a decision sure to
pierce the Big Apple to its core, the Supreme Court
ruled yesterday that Ellis Island — historic gateway
for millions of immigrants — is mainly in New Jersey.
Most of the island in New York Harbor from now
on must be considered Ellis Island, N.J., the high court
ruled 6-3 in resolving a border dispute between New
Jersey and New York.
"What the Supreme Court has done is said
unequivocally that this island is shared — it was New
York and New Jersey," New Jersey Gov. Christie
Whitman said. For New York, which already lost the
Giants and Jets football teams to its neighboring state,
it was a new indignity.
