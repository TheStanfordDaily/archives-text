WASHINGTON (AP) — Step
ping up the pressure on his central
witness, Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr has requested
handwriting samples, fingerprints
and voice samples from former
White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, legal sources said yes
terday.
Emboldened by a recent string
of court victories in his investiga
tion of an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up, Starr asked
for the samples several months
after he first subpoenaed them,
according to the legal sources, who

spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
The subpoena was first issued
in January but the request was
never enforced as the two sides
first sought an agreement to secure
her cooperation and then fought in
court over whether she had a deal
for full immunity, the sources said.
Lewinsky lost that court battle,
and the decision against her was
upheld on appeal. To date, Lewin
sky has not appeared before a
grand jury although previously she
has turned over several items to
prosecutors such as address books.

computer files and clothing.
The samples would be used by
prosecutors to authenticate evi
dence they have been presenting
to grand jurors, including hand
written letters and tapes secretly
made by Linda Tripp in which
Lewinsky is said to have discussed
her relationship with the presi
dent.
Prosecutors are investigating
whether Lewinsky and Clinton
lied when they denied under oath
in the Paula Jones sexual harass
ment lawsuit that they ever had a
sexual relationship.
