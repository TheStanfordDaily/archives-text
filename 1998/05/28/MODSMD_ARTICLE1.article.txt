# 1,000 fill Quad for grad housing rally
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
More than I.(KK) graduate stu
dents, representing a wide range-of
University departments, attended a
rally in the Quad last night to raise
support for more graduate student
housing.
Many students at the rally
planned to spend the night in the
Quad, braving the light rain and cold
of this year's unusual May weather.
Students covered their tents with
signs reading. "Look Mom. no hous
ing." and "Rent plus Ramen equals
stipend." Organizers of the rally
provided free food, as well as extra
sleeping bags and pads.
•' This is an impressive show of
backbone for graduate students,
said protester Bob Lant/, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering.
Lantz said what the University had
done so far to address the housing
problem hadn't been productive
and that he felt it was typical of the
University's attitude toward gradu
ate students as a whole.
"It is really a matter of priori

tics," said Alane Murdock. a doctor
al student in ncuroscicnce and a
member of the Graduate Student
Council. "There was money to fix
the Rodin sculpture garden, but not
to keep (iraduate KAs they cost
about the same amount."
The rally was the culmination of
student anger over the current hous
ing situation.
With rising prices in the local
housing market and the excessive
demand for on-campus housing pro
vided for graduate students, many
students have found themselves
with little University assistance and
are unable to afford housing any
where in the area.
Frustration grew more heated
with last week's release of a report
on graduate student housing by the
ASSIJ. the Graduate Student C oun
cil and the (iraduate 1 lousing Advi
sory Committee. The report, based
on the recent graduate housing sur
vey conducted on the World W ide
Web. outlined the dire problems
graduate students perceive in regard
to housing, parking, quality of life
and lack of University support.

High-level administrators were
present to listen to student concerns.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said the
University is trying to help all it can.
"Everybody is frustrated; we
know people are worried." she said.
She explained that there are
short-term and long-term plans.
While the doubling up of spaces in
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memo
rial Hall may not be ideal. Rice said
the University is "trying to get as
many people on campus as possi
ble." For the long term, more than
41K) spaces are budgeted to be added
to Escondido Village.
Many students expressed frustra
tion with a seemingly wealthy uni
versity unresponsive to their con
cerns.
"The University has so much
land." said Paul Hargrove, a doctor
al student in scientific computing
and computational mathematics.
"They are already developing
Sand Hill Road. By pursuing a pro
ject like that, it proves they have the
capital and the space — but that pro
ject doesn't directly benefit the Uni
versity. Helping graduate student?
would have better afforded its mis
sion."
Akiba Lerner. a doctoral student
in religious studies, agreed.
"There is so much wealth and
land concentrated here. It is unrea
sonable that a solution to the hous
ing problem can't be found."
Lerner said he thought providing
for its graduate students was in the
University's best interest.
"Stanford can't function as a uni
versity without functional graduate
students. Students need a place to
live and feel secure to devote time to
their studies.
"We'll work, we'll be indentured
servants: We just want a reasonable
environment." Lerner added.
Murdock noted that in the past,
the Board of Trustees has increased
the amount of money drawn from
the University's endowment in

thing organizers did not foresee but welcomed.
