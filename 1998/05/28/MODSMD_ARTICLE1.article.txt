# 1,000 fill Quad for grad housing rally
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
More than I.(KK) graduate stu
dents, representing a wide range-of
University departments, attended a
rally in the Quad last night to raise
support for more graduate student
housing.
Many students at the rally
planned to spend the night in the
Quad, braving the light rain and cold
of this year's unusual May weather.
Students covered their tents with
signs reading. "Look Mom. no hous
ing." and "Rent plus Ramen equals
stipend." Organizers of the rally
provided free food, as well as extra
sleeping bags and pads.
•' This is an impressive show of
backbone for graduate students,
said protester Bob Lant/, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering.
Lantz said what the University had
done so far to address the housing
problem hadn't been productive
and that he felt it was typical of the
University's attitude toward gradu
ate students as a whole.
"It is really a matter of priori

tics," said Alane Murdock. a doctor
al student in ncuroscicnce and a
member of the Graduate Student
Council. "There was money to fix
the Rodin sculpture garden, but not
to keep (iraduate KAs they cost
about the same amount."
The rally was the culmination of
student anger over the current hous
ing situation.
With rising prices in the local
housing market and the excessive
demand for on-campus housing pro
vided for graduate students, many
students have found themselves
with little University assistance and
are unable to afford housing any
where in the area.
Frustration grew more heated
with last week's release of a report
on graduate student housing by the
ASSIJ. the Graduate Student C oun
cil and the (iraduate 1 lousing Advi
sory Committee. The report, based
on the recent graduate housing sur
vey conducted on the World W ide
Web. outlined the dire problems
graduate students perceive in regard
to housing, parking, quality of life
and lack of University support.

High-level administrators were
present to listen to student concerns.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said the
University is trying to help all it can.
"Everybody is frustrated; we
know people are worried." she said.
She explained that there are
short-term and long-term plans.
While the doubling up of spaces in
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memo
rial Hall may not be ideal. Rice said
the University is "trying to get as
many people on campus as possi
ble." For the long term, more than
41K) spaces are budgeted to be added
to Escondido Village.
Many students expressed frustra
tion with a seemingly wealthy uni
versity unresponsive to their con
cerns.
"The University has so much
land." said Paul Hargrove, a doctor
al student in scientific computing
and computational mathematics.
"They are already developing
Sand Hill Road. By pursuing a pro
ject like that, it proves they have the
capital and the space — but that pro
ject doesn't directly benefit the Uni
versity. Helping graduate student?
would have better afforded its mis
sion."
Akiba Lerner. a doctoral student
in religious studies, agreed.
"There is so much wealth and
land concentrated here. It is unrea
sonable that a solution to the hous
ing problem can't be found."
Lerner said he thought providing
for its graduate students was in the
University's best interest.
"Stanford can't function as a uni
versity without functional graduate
students. Students need a place to
live and feel secure to devote time to
their studies.
"We'll work, we'll be indentured
servants: We just want a reasonable
environment." Lerner added.
Murdock noted that in the past,
the Board of Trustees has increased
the amount of money drawn from
the University's endowment in

thing organizers did not foresee but welcomed.

times of financial crisis. She suggest
ed that this would be a way to fund
new graduate student housing or in
crease stipends.
Director of Graduate Policy Tom
Wasow said that he understood
where the graduate students were
coming from.
"I feel their pain," he said.
But Wasow added that while he
felt the graduate students did "a ter
rific job on the housing report," he

was dismayed by the onslaught of
the "adversarial tone" in the com
ments on the situation. "It is as if
they are assessing blame on the Uni
versity.
"It has really been the graduate
students themselves who have
raised the consciousness of the ad
ministrators — people are putting
more time and energy into this than
we would have" because of the grad
uate students' concerns. "A lot of
changes will happen because of
this," Wasow said.
Students felt that a rally was nec
essary "because there is no real re

course open to express concern
about issues, according to Lerner.
Doctoral student in biochemistry
Stephanie Toering, chair of GH AC,
said that she expected the tone of the
rally to be negative.
"All of the comments from the
survey were negative," she said.
"Only 3 percent of the stories on the
returned surveys had anything posi
tive to say."
According to Lerner. the rally
shows that "people are collectively
experiencing a problem. There is
strength to be gained in a group."
Rami Wernik, a doctoral student

in education, currently lives in Es
condido Village but lost housing in
this month's Draw. He said he
thought the size of the rally was
telling.
"People need to be together —
this needs to happen," he said.
Roni Kosmal, Wernik's domestic
partner, said she thought the prob
lem called for a negative response.
"Students need to unite, and the
University needs to deal with this.
Four hundred units over the next
three years is just insufficient."
Provost Rice explained that the
University is trvinu to deal with the

problem as quickly and efficiently as
possible. Housing officials are look
ing for off-campus housing to pur
chase. However, this is a difficult op
tion.
The land value — the high price
of the land — would be passed on to
the students who live in the space
through their housing costs.
She added that Santa Clara
County limits the University as to
how quickly they can develop Uni
versity land.
"Even getting permits for trailers
is difficult," she said.
Rice planned to return at about

7:30 a.m. today to address the gradu
ate students publicly.
Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, a doctor
al student in communication and a
member of the, Graduate Student
Council, said the organizers of the
rally were really pleased with the
turnout.
Toering said that the event's or
ganizers had made an effort to reach
out to graduate students in all de
partments.
"There are even families here
tonight, which is unusual at graduate
student events," she said. "This is re
ally the people's chance to vent."
