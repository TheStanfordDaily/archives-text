' The California Republicans
dueling for the U.S. Senate nomina
tion dialed down their low-visibility
campaign to near zero yesterday in
anticipation of today's debate,
While the candidates for governor
ttiok another approach and headed
for campus.
Neither car alarm magnate Dar
rell Issa nor state Treasurer Matt
Fong. running virtually neck-and
neck in the polls, had any public
events scheduled yesterday. Instead
they were huddled with aides,
rehearsing questions and answers.
I The two candidates were sup
fiosed to meet today at San Jose
State University for a debate that is
exoected to be critical to the
upcoming June 2 election.
* Democratic incumbent Sen. Bar
bara Boxer was invited to the
debate, but she declined the offer.
• The Senate campaign has drawn
far less attention this spring than the
face for governor, although the

November race is expected to be
much more hotly contested. Much
of the Senate campaign to date has
been waged on television, although
Fong has been unable to afford to
advertise until relatively recently in
the race.
Today's debate, which is spon
sored by the San Jose Mercury
News, could revolve around a
recent Los Angeles Times story
questioning Issa's business back
ground.
The Times story included allega
tions that arson was suspected in a
1982 fire that caused $8(X).(KK) dam
ages at Issa's plant, which at the
time was located in Cleveland.
The fire occurred shortly after
the insurance on the building had
been increased. However, Issa
denied any wrongdoing, and later
he settled the dispute on his own
with the insurance company.
A former business partner said
that Issa stole the company out

from under him. an allegation that
Issa vehemently denied. The Times
also said that Issa at one time
threatened an executive who he was
about to fire with a gun.
The executive — who later was
convicted in a telemarketing
scheme — said Issa placed the gun
on the table in front of him in an act
of intimidation. Issa denied that the
incident ever occurred.
Also yesterday.the Democratic
candidate for governor Al Checchi
and presumptive GOP nominee
Dan Lungren went on tours of
schools around different areas of
the state.
Checchi made stops at several
schools in San Francisco and San
Jose, while Lungren visited an ele
mentary school in Menlo Park.
The front-runner for the Demo
cratic nomination. Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, spoke yesterday at the dedi
cation of the Sacramento Veterans
Resource Center.
