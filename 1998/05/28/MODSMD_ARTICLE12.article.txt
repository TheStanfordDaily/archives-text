### 
OKLAHOMA CITY (AF)
Michael Fortier, the government's
star witness in the Oklahoma City
bombing case, was sentenced to 12
years in prison yesterday after
tearfully apologizing for not warn
ing anyone as the deadly plot took
shape.
"I am so completely ashamed
that I did not come forward with
my knowledge right away," Fortier
said haltingly, tears in his eyes. He
said he never thought Timothy
McVeigh's plot "would bear such
rotten fruit."
Fortier. 29, had pleaded guilty
to failing to tell anyone about the
plot, lying to the FBI afterward,
hiding evidence and trafficking in
guns that were stolen to help pay
for the April 19, 1995, attack on
the Oklahoma City federal build
ing that killed 168 people.
U.S. District Judge G. Thomas
Van Bebber imposed the sentence
after hearing pleas from victims'
relatives that he give Fortier the
maximum for doing nothing to

save their loved ones' lives. The
judge previously said he would
start with a sentence of 14 to 17 1 /
2 years before taking into consid
eration Fortier's cooperation with
prosecutors.
"This is a case unparalleled in
the history of the American justice
system," Van Bebber said. "This
renders the balance of cooperation
with the government and justice
extremely difficult to administer. 1
believe it is important that the vic
tims of this crime not be forgot
ten."
The judge also fined Fortier
$2(M),(XK) and ordered him to repay
$4.(M)] to an Arkansas gun dealer
whose weapons were stolen.
Fortier's lawyers had argued
that he deserved a big break for
being "the mailman who delivered
the evidence" against McVeigh
and Terry Nichols. The defense
asked for less than four years in
prison: Fortier has already served
nearly three.
Prosecutors had asked that the

judge start with a sentence of 11 to
14 years and then give Fortier a
"significant" break for his cooper
ation, but they did not say how
much.
Defense attorney Michael
McGuire said Fortier would
appeal the sentence. McGuire met
with Fortier for about 45 minutes
after the sentencing.
"He's certainly feeling the bur
den associated with it. But he
understands what the judge did.
Everything that we said we meant.
We tried to help out in furthering
prosecution of this case." he said.
"I thought it was an appropriate
sentence." U.S. Attorney Patrick
Ryan said, i think this defendant,
given the nature of the crime,
should have been sentenced at the
upper levels of the guideline, and
that's what this judge did."
"Dear people of Oklahoma. 1
offer my apology and ask that you
forgive me." a choked-up Fortier
told the courtroom before learning
his sentence.
