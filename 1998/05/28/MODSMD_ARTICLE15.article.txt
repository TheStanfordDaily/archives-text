Splitting Anthropology
Department could limit
breadth of scholarship

The recent proposal to
split the Anthropology Depart
ment into two separate depart
ments is well justified, but it serves as a
disturbing reminder of the potential
for irreconcilable antagonism and dis
junction within scholarship.
While scholars may have their rea
sons for splitting, students entering the
field should not be pushed to further
the divide. Anthropologists, whether
cultural or biological, are after all
studying the same human beings and
the same human societies.
The proposed split comes on the
heels of disputes at schools nationwide
over approaches to anthropological
research. Anthropology departments
at a number of leading universities
have semi-autonomous wings that
operate with separate graduate admis
sions and curricula.
The reasons for these divisions are
well argued, for the deep ideological
conflicts involved render the diverging
elements of anthropology difficult to
subsume under a single field of inquiry.
But that these differences have caused
internal division within the depart
ment is a point of concern, not only to
academics and administrators but also
to students in the field.
Beyond the ideological conflicts
related to scholarship, other issues
also spurred the proposal to split the
department. In particular, the issue of
faculty appointments has been a point
of contention, as evidenced by recent

controversies over tenure decisions.
An alternative proposal to the split —
that the two wings put forth faculty
appointment requests without the
other's unanimous consent — was
rejected on the grounds that it would
exacerbate tensions and hostility with
in the department.
That such potential antagonism was
foreseen and intentionally avoided
through a departmental split reveals
deep and unhealthy tensions that exist
within the department. Separate
financing and administration may
prove to be effective in easing these
tensions. But separate realms of dia
logue will only reduce the breadth of
the scholarship.
Furthermore, the apparent racial
and gender divide between the two
wings of the department points to the
need to address these differences of
perspective in a more constructive
manner. ITie cultural / social anthro
pologists are predominantly women
and minorities; the anthropological
scientists are mostly white men. If all
such divides split the dialogue in schol
arship, education stands little to enrich
or encourage understanding acro'ss
gender and ethnic boundaries.
If the split is approved, the newly
created major requirements should
ensure that students entering one of
the two fields of anthropology are
exposed to the wide range of perspec
tives in the field, not compartmental
ized by their major into one side or
another, nor encouraged, to nurture
antagonism toward differing perspec
tives.
Conflicting approaches to scholar
ship can be healthy. But hostilities aris
ing from these conflicts — and build
ing walls within them — are not.
