## A
						whole-hearted decision, at last 
### 
WHEN I WENT
to my sister's
Stanford gradu
ation six years ago, I had
no idea that the same cer
emony would be in my
future. As a high school
sophomore, college felt
like ages away, although

one year later SATs and college applica
tions would enter my life.
Among my scattered memories of that
weekend, I remember my parents exclaim
ing how dirty my sister's residence, Chi
Theta Chi, was and agreeing with them. Lit
tle did 1 know that I'd be living in a co-op
three out of my four years at Stanford.
That weekend I also got into my first
bike accident at Stanford. While my parents
went on a tour of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, I decided to ride my
sister's bike to the lake. My chin met a patch
of gravel in the parking lot behind Roble
Hall, which would later become my fresh
man dorm.
A year later, I decided that I wanted to
go to Stanford in spite of the fact that my
lasting impression of it was the hospital
emergency room (where 1 went to get my
chin stitched up that fateful afternoon).
Two years later I would inherit my sister's
bike, which would get me into another acci

dent before someone stole it.
There wasn't much of a process to my
decision-making. I was too lazy to leave
warm weather, and 1 didn't want to have to
take a long plane flight home. I also didn't
want to argue with my parents as my sister,
who'd wanted to go to an East Coast col
lege instead, had. To me Stanford felt famil
iar and safe — at least when bikes weren't
concerned. You could call my decision fate.
Or you could call it indifference.
Four years later, when people ask me if 1
feel I made the right decision in coming to
Stanford. I don't know what to say. It's a
difficult question to answer when it was a
non-decision in the first place. Maybe if it
had been a decision that involved sleepless
nights and hair-pulling, I wouldn't feel that
I would have been equally contented to
have attended our rival across the bay.
Choosing a major — one of those big
decisions in your undergraduate career —
was also a non-decision for me. When I
decided to become a human biology
dropout the summer after sophomore year,
modern thought and literature was the only
other major that the classes I'd been taking
could fit into. Again, it was all about return
ing to something that felt comfortable.
Like many of you, I had to make the all
important decision this year — go to gradu
ate school, get a job or keep myself other

wise occupied Lcouldn't think of anything I
wanted to study further or a career I wanted
to jump start, so that basically left me with
the third option. This is one reason why 1 am
going to be spending the next year in Xining.
China, a city infamous for being the supply
point for the country's gulag system.
I could also think of this decision as fate.
I'm going to be teaching at the same uni
versity my great-uncle was sent to during
the Cultural Revolution. According to my
mother, my great-uncle was the black sheep
of the family and won the hand of his bride
in a horse race. I have a very romantic
image of him racing across the grasslands
on. a Mongolian pony, although I later
found out that his bride was from Russia.
I prefer to think of it as a real decision.
Xining is definitely not the easy way out.
Among other things, it happens to get quite
cold in the winter there. I won't be able to
go home for the holidays, and my parents
were not overjoyed to find out that this is
where I am going to be spending a year in
China. But I can safely say that if you ask
me a year from now, I will be able to reply
that it was the right decision, because this
time, I whole-heartedly made it.

thought and literature, has trouble deciding
what to wear when she gets up in the morning.
