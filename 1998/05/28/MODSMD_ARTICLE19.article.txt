Live up to the reputation
Last night there was a graduate student
rally that drew attention to issues surround
ing graduate student housing on eampus.
The rally and a report titled "Graduate
Housing: Discussion and Recommenda
tions" are the result of hundreds of hours of
effort on the part of a small group of gradu
ate students. I believe that many will sup
port me in commending this group for an
outstanding effort.
I think that the report and the straight
forward. non-confrontational manner in
which it presents students' feelings stand in
stark contrast to the numerous political tac
tics used by the administration during the
past few months.
Last night, many of us joined these stu
dents who have devoted so much effort to
an important cause. Perhaps the adminis
tration will finally see that graduate stu
dents want to work with them to make
graduate school at Stanford live up to its
reputation.

VanDerveer's talk was just
one of Lyman Lecture Series
I was pleased to see the excellent sum
mary of Tara VanDerveer's May 20 talk in
The Daily. However, I would like to point
out that this lecture was one of many in
the Jing Lyman Lecture Series, sponsored
by the Institute for Research on Women
and Gender, with additional support from
the Haas Center for Public Service and
the Program in Feminist Studies.
Throughout this year's series on
"Women and Men: Public Policies and
Private Lives," we have endeavored to
expose the Stanford community to a wide
variety of perspectives on topics including
affirmative action, the impact of culture
on gender and the role of women in the
Black Panther Party.
Coach VanDerveer's lecture on the
impact of Title IX was honest, personal,
humorous and informative, and I am
delighted that so many people came to
hear it. However, I believe this lecture can
be better appreciated in the larger context
of the Jing Lyman Lecture Series, which

has served the Stanford community for
over 20 years.
