## Stanford $17 million in the black 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
The University's final budget for next year
includes a $17 million surplus, the fifth surplus
in as many years. This budget will be an
nounced to the Faculty Senate at their meeting
today and will likely be approved by the Board
ofTrustees in June.
Stanford anticipates revenues of $1.428 bil
lion and expenses of $ 1.411 billion. The surplus
will be saved for future years when the econo
my is weaker and revenues are lower.
"We want to ensure against a dip in endow
ment," said Provost Condoleezza Rice, the
budget's author. "We see this extra money as a
safeguard."
The budget does allow for some increases
in.-spending. Several schools, including the
School of Engineering and the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, plan to hire new profes
sors in the coming year. While some of these
positions are new, others arc replacements for
billets cut in the budget crisis of the early 19905.
Also included in the financial plan for next
y<?ar are additional funds for undergraduate
education, most of which will be directed to
Stanford Introductory Studies, a program that
works to enhance educational opportunities in
the first two years of college.
This additional $3.4 million will support
programs such as the Stanford Introductory
Seminars — which expects to offer 100 fresh
man and sophomore seminars next year —
arid Sophomore College, which expects to

hold 24 seminars for 288 students.
To respond to the graduate housing crisis,
the University will increase stipends by 6.5 per
cent and has budgeted $15 million toward the
building of new graduate housing over the
next two years. The University plans to make
room for 4(X) more students.
"That number may increase due to recent
developments," said Housing and Dining Ser
vices Director Keith Guy.
According to the budget, renovations on
Green Library West should be complete by
the end of next year. When finished, the build
ing will house the library's Special Collections
and the Humanities Resource Center and
stacks.
The School of Medicine's new Center for
Clinical Sciences Research and the Science
and Engineering Quad should also near com
pletion next year, and plans are in place to
build a new swimming pool complex by the
year 2000 and an alumni center by 2001.
The financial aid budget will increase 7.7
percent next year to $1(X).7 million. The Finan
cial Aids Office will limit the impact of home
value in calculating student aid eligibility. It
will also no longer include outside scholarships
in the amount of aid a student receives from
the University. The budget increase will cover
the added costs from these policy changes.
The number of students receiving grant aid
dropped from 2,705 in 1 995-96 to 2,584 in 1
97. The projected numbers for this year and


Rice
next year fall between the two pre
vious levels.
Faculty and staff salaries will in
crease 3 percent next year, but the
total expenditures for faculty will
go up 10 percent due to expected
increases in hiring.
