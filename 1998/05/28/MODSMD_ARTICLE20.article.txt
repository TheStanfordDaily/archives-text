# Bordering on slander
## Spending a splendid summer at Stanford 
### 
I J. Babbitt

THE DOG DAYS are coming.
Another year is over. Well. OK. not
quite over. There's still that messy
business of finals, take-homes and multiple
10-page papers to complete.
Everyone needs to remember to turn in
the Bookstore rebate envelope. Yet if the
Bookstore actually had a good year, it
would find a way to "donate" most of our
rebate money to the University.
Important decisions remain to be made.
Can the relationship withstand three whole
months of separation? Or should the sum
mer months be turned into a zone of "Don't
ask. don't tell?" Even if you're not in this
situation personally, you still have to advise
your friends.
Freshmen, sophomores and juniors need
to remember to register for next year or
face big fines this summer. Graduating stu
dents need to plan their wardrobe for the
Wacky Walk as well as their future lives.
Everyone is busy, busy, busy.
Now is as good a time as any to dread
whatever plans you've made for the sum
mer. Whether you've been carefully laying

the groundwork for a career-making intern
ship, planning that humanitarian trip to
Cuba, or are just going to work at the local
7-Eleven and live with your parents, your
summer could turn out to be a disaster.
And if you don't know what you're doing
yet, remember that all the good jobs are
taken by students at other colleges who've
already finished the year.
Even if you have an internship secured,
your unique abilities will probably not be
harnessed by the business you work for,
unless your special talent is photocopying,
sorting mail and waiting around for things
to happen. Most summer internships, after
all, are like jobs in a communist country:
you don't get paid very well, but at least you
don't have to work very hard.
One summer option for lazy and inertial
people who can't decide what to do is just to
stay on campus. There's plenty of grunt
work and photocopying to be done here,
and you'll get paid far more for it than you
would anywhere else.
Sure, staying on campus is a little bit
pathetic, but it can be an interesting experi

ence.
Right after finals, you get to watch and
laugh as your housemates (many of them
drunk, high, hung over or experiencing the
after-effects of sleep deprivation) as they
struggle to empty all of their personal pos
sessions from their room and restore it to
some semblance of order in the few hours
allotted to them by the University.
After most of the undergraduates have
hauled themselves away, a brief and uncan
ny silence descends on central campus.
Then everything bursts forth with proud
parents, departmental graduation parties,
free food and speeches.
After all of that goes away, the campus
becomes devastatingly silent (graduate stu
dents don't make much noise). But there
are still undergraduates lurking around. On
the moving day for summer residents, they
begin streaming out of Stern and Wilbur
halls, struggling along with their books and
clothes and coffee pots, making Escondido
Road look like the site of a medieval pil
grimage. Their goal: Mirrielees.
The summer experience at Mirrielees is

really quite wonderful because it is a pro
foundly anti-residential education experi
ence. It's as though everyone has taken a
solemn oath not to talk or sociali/e with
people they don't already know, unless they
have a g(x>d reason to.
Summer at Stanford is constructive
because it forces you to actually organize
and plan your social life, rather than lazily
sending your resident assistant off to buy
alcohol for you or opening your door and
expecting friendly people to come hang out
with you. The real world doesn't work that
way, thank God.
Without the distraction of dorm life, one
begins to take advantage of the Bay Area.
Summer is a good time to make the trek to
Stinson Beach up north or Carmel down
south.
You might make friends in the ( itv and
come to know its distinctive neighborhoods
and dangerously great bars.
Or maybe you'd stick closer to home and
drive around aimlessly up in the Foothills
(just get on Page Mill Road and don't get
off for a while). There's actually a surprising

amount of open space on the Peninsula,
when you start looking for it.
Even if you're hard at work, the summer
months seem loaded with free time to
explore. Maybe it's the longer days or the
fact that you're not wasting so much time
playing dorm broomball or sitting around
bitching with your friends about how many
midterms you have.
Whatever the reason, summer at Stan
ford is a distinctive and worthwhile experi
ence. There's more time to get to know the
people who have stayed behind, and the
mellowness is addictive.
All good things come to an end, of
course. When people start pouring back in
the fall, you lose the peace and quiet of the
summer months. People take up space,
cause traffic and make noise.
So if you're packing up and going home
for the summer, remember this: More than
one person who's staying behind is glad
you're leaving. Happv summer, evervone.
