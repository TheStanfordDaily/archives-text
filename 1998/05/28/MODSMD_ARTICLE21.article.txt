# Trilogy CEO, Stanford alum retraces path to success
## 
### Govind Dandekar Contributing writer 
While finals loom before stu
dents, Joe Liemandt, the 29-year
old CEO of Trilogy software com
pany, reminds them that grades
aren't necessarily what determines
a person's success.
"One of the reasons 1 came to
Stanford was to he in [Silicon] Val
ley and to be around software,"
Liemandt said.
"My best friend from high
school and I came out here on a re
cruiting weekend on a great March
day and we said, 'This is where we
have to go to college!' Our decision
to come to Stanford was based on
the weather."
Liemandt came to Stanford in
fall 1986 and said he was a "pretty
normal" student.
"I was just an average freshman
wondering what the hell is going on
in chemistry class and 'Why am I
getting an 18 on my physics exam?'
1 never knew how to get an 18 be
fore."
Hut while Liemandt and his fel
low freshmen were being blown
away bv physics exams, Liemandt
was formulating ideas for his own
software company. During his
three-year tenure at Stanford, Lie
mandt spent countless hours con
ducting configurations research in
the Math and Computer Science li
braries. He also tried to attend
every computer science talk or
seminar.
"You'd have people like Scott
McNeely from SUN (Microsys
tems, Inc.) come and give a talk on
campus," Liemandt said.
"I'd go up to him afterward and
ask, 'If I had this configuration
product for your front office,
would you buy it?' "
Liemandt had to juggle his soft
ware research with his academic
schedule.
As a result, he wound up major
ing in the now extinct qualitative
economics major.

"At the time, qualitative econ
was the easiest major at Stanford,"
Liemandt recalled. "1 wanted to do
all this random stuff
"Qualitative econ let me take
econ and do all the other stuff 1
wanted to do. I wasn't into eco
nomics at all. I picked it because it
was easy."

1 only passed one class
fall quarter. I forgot to goto
the rest of the classes.'
—Joe Liemandt

This economics degree allowed
Liemandt to take all the computer
science and industrial engineering
classes he wanted.
Liemandt said that he may one
day return to finish his degree.
"The [new econ] degree might be
too hard. I'd have to switch to soc
or comm."
As Liemandt's research contin
ued. he began to realize that a vac
uum existed in sales configuration
software.
He determined that if he could
assemble a team of programmers,
code throughout his senior year
and have the product ready to ship
by graduation, everyone would
want to purchase it.
As Liemandt put it, "1 was try
ing to start a company, and I was
looking for other people to jump
off the cliff with me."
By the summer of 1989, Lie
mandt had assembled a core team
consisting of John Lynch, Christina
Jones, Chris Porch and Seth Strat
ton.
"We knew each other via classes
or friends of friends or activities
like the Blythe Fund," Liemandt
said.
"I knew them all sort of ran
domly and thought, 'Well, let's
start this thing and see how this
goes.' "
In the summer before their se

nior year, these five Stanford stu
dents founded Trilogy. They all
planned on enrolling in classes and
coding simultaneously. It quickly
became evident that the time com
mitment was too large.
"I only passed one class fall
quarter," Liemandt said.
"I forgot to go to the rest of the
classes."
Liemandt determined that he
either had to drop out or abandon
the company altogether. The
founders believed that the internal
research departments at compa
nies like Xerox and Hewlett-
Packard would soon develop the
same software.
Liemandt thought he only had
nine months to perfect and ship the
software. Thus, he and Lynch
chose to leave Stanford and code
full-time.
When Liemandt chose to drop
out, no one was supportive.
"Everyone thought I was stupid.
Every piece of advice, whether it
was from parents or friends was
'Don't drop out. Finish school.'
There was nobody who said that
this was a reallv good idea. Wc had

to band together against adversi
ty."
The first three years ol Trilogy
were trying, he said.
"We blew it. Our product
sucked. We couldn't sell any of it.
The product didn't work because
we didn't know what the hell we
were doing.
"For three years we had parents
and friends telling us that we're a
bunch of morons and that we were
wasting our lives away. We sat
around and said, 'Why don't we
stop this? Maybe everyone else is
right.' "
After three difficult years. Trilo
gy's product finally worked and
everyone wanted to buy it.
"Our whole concept of the mar
ket was right," Liemandt said.
"Once we built it, everybody
bought it."
Once the company had a secure
customer base, the remaining
founders — Seth Stratton had left
the company after graduation —
decided to move the company
headquarters from Silicon Valley
to Austin, Texas. None of the Tril
ogy founders had ever lived in

Austin, but they fell in love onceV,
they visited.
"The worst part about Austin is*?
that it's in Texas, but if you get to -
Austin, it's a great city."
Trilogy has expanded from
small start-up to a company that
now employs about S(X) people. „
Liemandt described the "techie-.J
fuzzy" split at Trilogy as 50-50.
"You want to work with a team;,,''*
of totally great people and you*
want to try the impossible.
"We hire the best people whcj*.
are driven and who want to wortfVf.
on really hard problems with other;
great people. Curriculum is sec
ondary to person. We are looking
for the same attitude and drive that
we had."
Although Liemandt dropped
out of college to start Trilogy, he
didn't think it was necessary.
He could have graduated,
worked as a program manager for,
two years and then managed the
coding of the software in one year.
He would advise future Joe Lie
mandts to obtain some experience
and to evaluate their commitment
to their goal.
"If you are going to start your
own company and drop out, you
won't know what you're doing.
"What's going to get yoiC
through it is force of will and deter"
mination.
"Make sure you really want to
do it. If you really want to do it, go
for it."

coding simultaneously. It quickly
became evident that the time com
mitment was too large.
"I only passed one class fall
quarter," Liemandt said.
"I forgot to go to the rest of the
classes."
Liemandt determined that he
either had to drop out or abandon
the company altogether. The
founders believed that the internal
research departments at compa
nies like Xerox and Hewlett-
Packard would soon develop the
same software.
Liemandt thought he only had
nine months to perfect and ship the
software. Thus, he and Lynch
chose to leave Stanford and code
full-time.
When Liemandt chose to drop
out, no one was supportive.
"Everyone thought I was stupid.
Every piece of advice, whether it
was from parents or friends was
'Don't drop out. Finish school.'
There was nobody who said that
this was a reallv good idea. Wc had

to band together against adversi
ty."
The first three years ol Trilogy
were trying, he said.
"We blew it. Our product
sucked. We couldn't sell any of it.
The product didn't work because
we didn't know what the hell we
were doing.
"For three years we had parents
and friends telling us that we're a
bunch of morons and that we were
wasting our lives away. We sat
around and said, 'Why don't we
stop this? Maybe everyone else is
right.' "
After three difficult years. Trilo
gy's product finally worked and
everyone wanted to buy it.
"Our whole concept of the mar
ket was right," Liemandt said.
"Once we built it, everybody
bought it."
Once the company had a secure
customer base, the remaining
founders — Seth Stratton had left
the company after graduation —
decided to move the company
headquarters from Silicon Valley
to Austin, Texas. None of the Tril
ogy founders had ever lived in

Austin, but they fell in love onceV,
they visited.
"The worst part about Austin is*?
that it's in Texas, but if you get to -
Austin, it's a great city."
Trilogy has expanded from
small start-up to a company that
now employs about S(X) people. „
Liemandt described the "techie-.J
fuzzy" split at Trilogy as 50-50.
"You want to work with a team;,,''*
of totally great people and you*
want to try the impossible.
"We hire the best people whcj*.
are driven and who want to wortfVf.
on really hard problems with other;
great people. Curriculum is sec
ondary to person. We are looking
for the same attitude and drive that
we had."
Although Liemandt dropped
out of college to start Trilogy, he
didn't think it was necessary.
He could have graduated,
worked as a program manager for,
two years and then managed the
coding of the software in one year.
He would advise future Joe Lie
mandts to obtain some experience
and to evaluate their commitment
to their goal.
"If you are going to start your
own company and drop out, you
won't know what you're doing.
"What's going to get yoiC
through it is force of will and deter"
mination.
"Make sure you really want to
do it. If you really want to do it, go
for it."
