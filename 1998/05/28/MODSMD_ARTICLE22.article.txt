## Bleszynski, Scott advance 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
For the second-straight season,
the Stanford women's tennis team
has sent two representatives into the
NCAA semifinals in the singles
draw.
Seniors Ania Bleszynski and
Julie Scott scored huge upsets yes
terday to advance to this afternoon's
national semifinals.
Scott took out the draw's top
seed in a three-set thriller in yester
day's quarterfinal. Bleszynski beat
the No. 3 seed to record her second
straight top-10 knockout.
Bleszynski and Scott ran out of
magic in the doubles draw, however,
as the fourth-seeded duo was upset
in the third round.
Scott, the Cardinal team captain,
reached the NCAA singles semifi
nals by stunning No. 1 seed Mirela
Vladulescu from Alabama-Birm
ingham yesterday 4-6,6-2,7-5.
"It feels great." Scott said of
reaching the final four. "It was a lit
tle easier to come out here and play
my match because I had nothing to
lose going out there against the No.
1 seed in Mirela. She played a great
first set.
"I'm glad to advance over a big
seed. Hopefully, I'll close out my se
nior year a winner."
No one would be surprised to see
Scott return to the national spotlight
this season. A two-time Pacific 10
Conference singles champion and

previous semifinalist. Scott was
ranked as high as No. 4 in the nation
in singles this season.
Vladulescu was not displeased
with her performance.
"I don't think I played that had,"
she said. Scott is "a great player. I'm
a little tired from yesterday; I had a
rough day. If I think about it. I could
have easily lost in the first round. I 'm
not that disappointed to lose this
match."
Scott will have a shot at another
high seed in today's semifinal
against No. 3 seed Vanessa Webb
from Duke. It will be an opportunity
for a revenge of sorts for Scott,
whose Cardinal was eliminated by
the Blue Devils in the team semifi
nals.
Webb will be up for the chal
lenge, as she seeks to avenge a sea
son-ending loss to Scott in last year's
NCAA quarterfinals. Scott eventu
ally fell to Florida's M.C. White in
the semifinal 7-5.6-1.
Bleszynski faced a familiar foe in
yesterday's match — California's
top singles player. Amanda Augus
tus. For the second day in a row,
Bleszynski overwhelmed a top-10
opponent with a powerful and con
sistent serve.
The Stanford senior whipped on
Augustus, the No. 5 singles player in
the nation, 6-1.6-0.
"I served really well, and that
helped me especially," Bleszynski
said. "1 played really well. I've
played her before, and I know that

she is better than that on any given
day.
"I think because I was serving so
well, she didn't get a chance to get in
a groove."

by upsetting the top singles player in
the nation in the quarterfinals.
Eventual champion Jill Craybas
beat her in the semifinals 6-2,6-3.
"1 was [in the semifinals] sopho
more year and lost, so hopefully I
will get a step or two further this
time," Bleszynski said. "It'sdefinite
ly something which I thought wasn't
going to happen this year. I was
lucky to even get into the tourna
ment. I was one of the last people to
get in. so making the final four is re
ally great."
After playing in the No. 4 spot all

season long for the Cardinal,
Bleszynski has returned to the form
at which she played as the No. 1
Stanford singles player in her sopho
more campaign. She compiled a 20-
3 record in this dual-match season
and an undefeated 9-() record in Pac

NCAA history. For the second
straight year, an unseeded player
will advance to the final match.
