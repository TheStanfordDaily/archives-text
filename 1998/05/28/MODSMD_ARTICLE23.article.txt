# Golf's season swings to end, players look ahead
## Golfers reflect on season's successes, failures 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
Throughout this season. Stan
ford women's golf coach Caroline
O'Connor approached her project
as the head of an inexperienced
team like a gardener might have
cultivated a new batch of seeds.
Any good gardener will tell
you that the key to full develop
ment is plenty of water and sun
shine.
Unfortunately for O'Connor,
the tale of the 1997-98 season may
be that the Cardinal got too much
water — in the form of rain show
ers.
• Phis year's Stanford team had
plenty of talent and won two big
tournaments — the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate and the
Arizona State Invitationals
I It enjoyed all this early success
(Respite torrential rains through
out the winter.
» Freshman Hilary Homeyer led
the Cardinal in both tournaments,
capturing the individual title in
each event.
' These regular season victories
gave the Cardinal confidence
lveading into postseason play, and
Stanford emerged as the third
place finisher at the Western Re
gional.
! The Card went to the NCAA
Championships in Madison,
Wise., as the sixth-ranked team in

the nation and expected to con
tend for the title.
But a first-day 304 landed the
Card in 18th place and eliminated
all realistic hopes of a champi
onship.

'We have all the talent it
takes, and as long as we all
improve and mature, we
should be tough to beat.'
— Stephanie Keever

Stanford bounced back with a
solid weekend en route to a tie for
eighth place.
"Our finish at nationals was
not what we were hoping for,"
Homeyer said. "But it was still a
lot of fun and a great learning ex
perience for us."
Along with its respectable
team finish, the Cardinal also
placed two players on the All-
American team — Homeyer and
fellow freshman Stephanie Keev
er.
"I thought 1 played really well
at nationals." Keever said. "Al
though the team's performance at
NCAAs was a little disappoint
ing, I think we had a lot of fun."
As its consistent play through
out the season indicated — the
Card did not finish out of the top
four all year — the team clearly

had the ability to make a run at
the national title.
There are many explanations
for the Cardinal's disappointing
early play in Madison, but per
haps the most valid involves El
Nino. The young Stanford team
needed all the preparation it
eould get, and the soggy winter
around the Farm made competi
tive practicing impossible.
The lack of winter practice pre
vented the team from gaining the
last bit of confidence and fine
tuning it needed to peak as a team
in the postseason.
Luckily, the Cardinal will re
turn a stronger team next season.
"The best part about this is that
we will have exactly the same
team next year," Keever said. "All
this season we gained experience
and knowledge of the courses and
our team. I know that we are going
to be a great team in the upcoming
years."
Considering its loads of young
talent and steady maturation,
there is no reason the Cardinal
cannot win a national title some
time during the next three sea
sons.
"We will be a more experi
enced, better team next year and
every year to come," Homeyer
said. "We have all the talent it
takes, and as long as we all im
prove and mature, we should be
toui»h to beat in the future."
