A little-known fact about the Stanford
sailing team: It's a competitive varsity
sport — and the reigning national cham
pion.
.t)uring the next few weeks, balmy
Ntw Orleans will be the venue for the
Cardinal team to defend that title.
i Sailing has a distinctively recreational
connotation for many; it primarily is asso
ciated with physical education classes on
campus. But with competitive racing,
sailing becomes a serious athletic endeav
or where skill and experience are the vital
ingredients for success.

"Sailing may not be a 'water-cooler'
sport, but it's still athletically demanding
and mentally challenging," said junior

Steve Kleha.
"It's not your typical sport." added se
nior Heather Rogers. "It's one of the only
coed varsity teams that I know 0f.... But
as a member of a successful team. I wish
we received more recognition and fund
ing from the University for our accom
plishments. Hopefully, that will change."
Training and competition are intense,
as the season lasts virtually all year with
little more than a month off during the
winter. With a lot of talent and depth on
the team this year, head coach Steve
Bourdow has led the Cardinal sailors to
West Coast dominance.
At the collegiate level, sailing is made

up of several divisions. In dinghy racing,
16 boats simultaneously sail a course that
runs anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes.
Combined finishes in a series of races last
ing over a few days determine a school's
overall placing.
