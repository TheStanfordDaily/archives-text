# Sailing chasing wind for national title

A little-known fact about the Stanford
sailing team: It's a competitive varsity
sport — and the reigning national cham
pion.
.t)uring the next few weeks, balmy
Ntw Orleans will be the venue for the
Cardinal team to defend that title.
i Sailing has a distinctively recreational
connotation for many; it primarily is asso
ciated with physical education classes on
campus. But with competitive racing,
sailing becomes a serious athletic endeav
or where skill and experience are the vital
ingredients for success.

SAILING
■ Monday-yesterday: Women's dinghy
racing competition. Brown finished first;
Stanford finished out of the top five.
■ Today: Team racing competition begins
in the national championships. New Or
leans.
■ Monday: Coed dinghy racing competi
tion begins in the national championships.
New Orleans.

"Sailing may not be a 'water-cooler'
sport, but it's still athletically demanding
and mentally challenging," said junior

Steve Kleha.
"It's not your typical sport." added se
nior Heather Rogers. "It's one of the only
coed varsity teams that I know 0f.... But
as a member of a successful team. I wish
we received more recognition and fund
ing from the University for our accom
plishments. Hopefully, that will change."
Training and competition are intense,
as the season lasts virtually all year with
little more than a month off during the
winter. With a lot of talent and depth on
the team this year, head coach Steve
Bourdow has led the Cardinal sailors to
West Coast dominance.
At the collegiate level, sailing is made

up of several divisions. In dinghy racing,
16 boats simultaneously sail a course that
runs anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes.
Combined finishes in a series of races last
ing over a few days determine a school's
overall placing.
Skippers sophomore Anika Leerssen.
freshman Heather Porter and junior Tay
lor Robinson, alone with their respective
crews — sophomore Alexis Kxivkovich.
sophomore C aroline Sumpf and fresh
man Sally Madsen make upthree Stan
ford boats that qualified for the women's
National Championships in dinghy rac-
ing.
'it's such a young team this year
on the women's side, with a lot of tal
ent," Robinson said. Her fellow
qualifiers are all freshmen and
sophomores this year. "I think we're
really looking to gain experience
and learn a lot at nationals."
Ranked 11th, the Stanford
women began racing Monday and
continued through yesterday. At the
end of play Tuesday, the Card's Di
vision A boat sat in a disappointing
14th place in the 16-team field.
Brown had two solid days of racing
and held a firm grasp on first place,
followed by USC and Connecticut
College.
Stanford's Division B team fared
better and was seated tentatively in
seventh place, just two points behind
Charleston.
Stanford is also slated to make a

strong first-time showing this week
at nationals for the coed dinghy rac
ing division, which kicks off Mon
day. Qualifiers include senior Phil
Barow, senior John A. Meade and
senior Dan Zimbaldi, sailing with
sophomore Katie Gregg, junior
Adrienne Stoltz, freshman Ben
Rappoport, coterminal student
Betsy Carmichael, Kleha and
Rogers. In this field, the Stanford
team is ranked fifth.
The area in which Stanford has
utter domination, however, is in
team racing, where competition
kicks off today in New Orleans. The
Cardinal team has gunned through
the season with 11 straight wins and
is gearing up to win its second na
tional championship, with five of the
six Stanford competitors returning
from last year's winning group.
Team racing is structured so that
each school fields three boats, which
race head-to-head with only one
other school at a time. Successive
races continue in a round-robin style

competition, with varying point val
ues awarded for respective finishes
in each race. At the end of the regat
ta, the victorious team is determined
by total points and overall record.
Team racing features more
strategic cooperation among the
three boats rather than just pur»
speed. Specific plays may be execuC'
ed by both teams as they jockey tor
help their teammates run farther out
front, while blocking their oppo
nents.
All-American skippers Zimbaldi
and Meade have sailed together
since high school. Along with Kleha,
the three boats have been team rac
ing for the past three years.
"They're like a fantastic jazz
trio," Rappoport said. "Most teams
have pretty well-defined game plans
that they always stick to.
"Our team, however, is like a
group of highly trained musicians
engaged in an improv session. Thej
can be creative and work with what
ever situation comes their way."
