Omaha nostalgia for Ben and Jen
Although manv of you probably didn't know, this
time last year Hen and Jen were wining and dining in
Omaha, Neb., with the Stanford baseball team. Reunit
ed as Daily sports editors this volume, they find their
minds turned toward Omaha after the Card lost the
chance to go to the College World Series.
When we were told that we were missing the
last week of our freshman years to go to Ne
braska. you could say we had mixed emo
tions. Granted, we were both thrilled to go to the
World Series but.. . Omaha?
We always thought that there was nothing in Ne
braska but corn, beef and. apparently, baseball.
But how wrong we were. Within a few days, we dis
covered that the town also had steak houses.
Most important, however, the pride and joy of
Omaha was Rosenblatt Stadium — and Rosenblatt
won our hearts. We still don't know quite what it was
about the stadium that was so captivating.
Maybe it was the posh accommodations. On ar
rival at the stadium, we were escorted to KZSU's
radio booth above the stands, which became our sec
ond home for the week.

We were expecting a tent amid the Louisiana State
boosters and were pleasantly surprised — make that
shocked — by our skybox directly behind home plate.
Accompanied by the KZSU broadcasting team,
the Daily crew had scored the prime box in the stadi
um. On one side were the television broadcasters
from ESPN; on the other was the crew from The As
sociated Press.
From our vantage point, our crew of amateur re
porters had the best view in the stadium. We could
call balls and strikes better than the umpire behind
the plate. And. of course, we had a television with in
stant replay next to us.
Of course, it also might have been the food. Behind
our booth was the press lounge, which was always
overflowing with artery-clogging snacks completely
devoid of any nutritional value.
Between the "meatloaf" and the "enchiladas." we
soon found out why sportswriters are traditionally
chunky armchair quarterbacks instead of agile, sporty
athletes.
Aside from the quite phatty meals, we were con
stantly supplied with fresh popcorn, generic Gatorade
and stale peanuts. We befriended the woman on malt
patrol. who made sure we were fully stocked with as
many Carnation chocolate malts and splintering
wooden "spoons" as desired.
The highlight, however, was eating so many boxes
of Nerds that we didn't even need to spend time

But the most distinctive part of
baseball in Omaha was the quality
of the fans.
Unaccustomed to the garish
ness and carnival quality of the
game at most major league ball
parks, the fans in Omaha came to
see real baseball at its most natur
al level.
People cheered for the most
dynamic players on the field in
stead of yelling at the blue dot to
cross the finish line in the Oak
land Coliseum's seventh-inning
dot race.
And the fans loved their teams.
Although Stanford didn't have the
largest following, all fans were de
voted.
Many had traveled thousands
of miles across middle America's
highways in their RVs to watch

their boys duke it out with the best
teams in the country.
The RV campsite was mottled
with purple and green flags and
fans dressed head-to-toe in their
teams' garb.
There was no front-running
going on — people were incredibly
die-hard.
And how could the fans not be
thrilled — the competition was the
finest amateur baseball in the na
tion. Many of the players were
drafted into the pros while in
Omaha.
Several of those will be gracing
the All-Star teams of the Ameri
can and National Leagues in a few
years.
All amenities aside, baseball is
what brought us to Omaha, and
baseball is what we left with.
Plus, a reallv good steak.

Jen and Ben feel for Bri and Alii
son, who didn 't get to go this year
But there's always next year.
