# Court rejects indirect-cost appeal
## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
Another chapter of the Stanford indi
rect-cost scandal came to a close on Tuesday
with the U.S. Court of Appeals' decision to
uphold the dismissal of Paul Biddle's lawsuit
against the University.
Hie question in the appeal was whether
Biddle. a federal overseer, was eligible to
bring the case forward under the federal
whistle-blowing law that might have gained

him substantial monetary damages.
The case concerned incidents in which
Stanford overbilled the ()ffice of Naval Re
search for research projects. The govern
ment settled its suit against the I niversitx in
1994.
"We can hope that the irresponsible ac
cusations in this matter have, at long last,
reached an end." University President Ger
hard Casper told the San lose Mercury
News yesterday.
"This decision in no wav exonerates

Stanford." said Timothy Rostello. Biddle's
lawyer. referring to the recent decision.
"The court dismissed the case on jurisdic
tional questions."
Rostello added that his client intends to
pursue further appeals either through the
c Mh Circuit Court, which handed down
Tuesday's decision, or the U.S. Supreme
C ourt He said the recent decision by the 9th
Circuit Court was "contrary to the 4th Cir-
cuit Court's decision."
"I think that ihe U.S. Supreme
Court would find this case very in
teresting," Rostello said.
The indirect-cost scandal, which
has plagued Stanford for almost a
decade and led to the resignation of
then-University President Donald
Kennedy, began with Biddies 1991
lawsuit accusing the University of
overbilling the Office of Naval Re
search. Middle's allegations sparked
congressional hearings and exten
sive media coverage.
Congress attempted to redefine
laws determining what universities
could charge to taxpayers in terms
of research costs as a response to
the case.
Indirect costs are expenses, such
as building maintenance, that are not
directly attributable to a single pro
ject and thus often cause difficulty in
designating numerical values.
In this particular case, the original
audit by the government alleged that
Stanford had overcharged the gov
ernment by about $200 million.
Stanford disputed this figure and ac
cused the government of non-pay
ment of other funds owed. In 1994.
the Office of Naval Research settled
with Stanford for $ 1.2 million as pay
ment for a few particular errors and

a stipulation by the government that
Stanford had committed no wrong
doing. Since that time, Middle has
personally pursued the case in an at
tempt to assign more responsibility
to the University.
The court's decision to dismiss fo
cused on the stipulations of the par
ticular federal law involved. The
whistle-blowing law is intended to
allow voluntary taxpayer-originated
cases on behalf of the government.
The taxpayer is then entitled to a
share of any money recovered by the
government.
The court claimed that Middle
could not sue and receive damages
as a private citizen because he was
obliged to inform his superiors of
any improprieties, as part of his job
responsibilities in the Office of
Naval Research.
The law aims to "encourage in
dividuals to report potential fraud
ulent activities being committed
against the government, and to re
ward them for doing so," wrote
District Judge Steven Wilson in
the decision.
"Mut where a government em
ployee is paid to perform this func
tion, the employee should not re
ceive a windfall for merely doing
his job."
Should Middle decide to pursue
the case further, the U.S. Supreme
Court would decide by fall whether
thev would hear the case.
