# Health Corps continues strong
## 7 years of health education for Bay Area elementary school students 
### Joyce Koo Staff writer 
Teaching the relationship be
tween behavior and biology to grade
school children is the weekly task of
the 60 students who make up the
Stanford Health Corps.
The Health Corps celebrated the
close of its seventh year with a dinner
Tuesday night . Over Chinese cuisine,
the W) student volunteers shared
some of their experiences, took pic
tures and modeled the Health ( orps
T-shirt with the motto "Education
for Life, Empowering Students
through Health Education."
The Health Corps goes to ele
mentary schools in the area to teach
children the relationship between be
havior and biology. With the help of
a $5,000 donation in November from
the Stanford Bachelors, a single
men's alumni association, the Health
Corps has been able to purchase ed
ucational tools and make copies of
worksheets for their classes.
All of the volunteers are under
graduates. most of whom are inter
ested in medicine and education. The
student-run organization piloted two
new programs this year in addition to
continuing a semester-long compre

hensive health education course.
At the Redwtx>d City School Dis
trict's request, the students taught a
four-lecture series on substance
abuse and implemented an after
school program.
"The goal of the Health Corps is
to identify the needs of the schools,
and then try to meet them," said
Tien-wen Wiedmann. who founded
the group as a professor in the School
of Medicine. Wiedmann began the
organization in 1991 when she saw
how the University's tremendous
human and capital resources could
help alleviate the social problems in
the area.
The school district recruited stu
dents to teach a substance abuse pro
gram to fourth through eighth
graders at live different Redwood
City schools. Hv targeting this age
group, the program, which is taught
in both English and Spanish, hopes to
prevent the problem before it begins.
Caron Lee, a senior and co-leader
for the Health Corps, spent one
month last summer researching and
designing t lie tobacco, drug and alco
hol abuse curriculum. Lee said the
purpose of the curriculum is to teach
the biology behind certain behaviors
so that children can make educated

decisions about their bodies.
"We don't use scare tactics or tell
them not to smoke," added Alison
Lam. another co-leader for the orga
nization. "Rather, we show them
what happens to their body when
they smoke and then let them
choose."
In addition to the new substance
abuse course, the co-leaders of the
Health Corps update and revise the
basic comprehensive health curricu
lum each year to improve the quality
of the material.
This summer the students will re
design their courses for different lev
els in Oi dcr to expand them to differ
ent grades. Currently, the compre
hensive course is taught only to sixth
graders at Taft and Hoover elemen
tary schools, hut will expand to
fourth, eighth and 10th graders next
year.
"The goal is to have this course
taught every other year," Wiedmann
said, "because the students are at dif
ferent levels of understanding and re
peating the material solidifies what
they learn."
The program will gradually grow
horizontally to include other schools
in the district.
While the topics for the compre

hensive health education course vary
each week — including nutrition,
sleep, exercise and sex education —
each lesson is taught in terms of
human biology. For example, the stu
dents study how nutrition affects the
digestive system and how exercise af
fects the circulatory system. Further
more, the course examines how all
the systems of the body interact, so
that the students can understand the
whole person.
In addition to teaching, the
Health Corps volunteers provide stu
dents with college role models. Many
of the pre-adolescents are not ex
posed to college students. By enter
ing into their classrooms, the volun
teers bring the possibility of going to
college closer to home for them.
Lam emphasized how the volun
teers cultivate a sense of camaraderie
with the students that the teachers
often lack.
"Since we are closer to their age,
they trust us and are less inhibited to
ask questions," she said.
According to Lee, all the hours of
preparation are worth it "when we
make learning fun and I see the kids
excited about what they learn. They
may even take what they learn and
share it with their families."
