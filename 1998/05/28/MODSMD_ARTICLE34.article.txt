## Get ready to romp and roll! 'Tap Dogs' really does bring tap to the '90s 
### Chaney Rankin Contributing writer 
When you think of tap dancing, does the image of 7-year
old girls in fluffy costumes pop into your head? If so, go see
"Tap Dogs" right away.
This brainchild of choreographer Dein Perry and director / de
signer Nigel Triffit is the coolest thing to hit theaters since
"STOMP." Theater aficionados beware — this is no play. It's
performance art at its wildest.
The only sounds issuing from the performers' mouths are
grunts and yells of pure energy.

Six brawny men clad in grunge flannel and work boots
spend 90 minutes blowing you out of your seat. It's almost
impossible to connect the marionette-like flailing of legs with
the intricate sounds that burst from the stage. At first, there is
nothing but tapping, giving the audience a chance to appre
ciate the work that goes into this particular art form. But just
when we're ready to ask, "Is this it?" the tap dogs answer.
I won't give away everything they do; the surprise is what
makes the show so much fun. Suffice it to say the show in
cludes tapping on ropes, ladders, buzz saws, water troughs
and makeshift pieces of stage that have a tendency to move.
And some very talented live musicians even appear on scaf
folding while playing a variety of instruments.
The show that dngs tap into the untamed world of rock
'n' roll was created by Perry, a young working-class man who
picked up tap dancing during his years in an Australian steel
town. Through the course of his career, he garnered a couple
of Olivier Awards for choreography and formed "Tap
Brothers," an early incarnation of "Tap Dogs."
The current manifestation combines Perry's choreogra
phy with Triffit's design talents, Andrew Wilkie's original
music and David Murray's lighting.
"Tap Dogs" starts out at a leisurely pace and gains
speed and intensity as it goes. When the lights go out at
the beginning of the performance, all we hear is the sound
of a lone tapper — in the dark. The first part of the show
is devoted to tap only, showcasing in turn the considerable
talents of the six unlikely dancers.
It's positively astonishing to see a bunch of big guys doing
exactly the same tiny, complex steps, and doing it all per
fectly in unison. Physical humor is thrown in for good mea
sure, and it's what keeps the audience interested when the
amazement starts to wear off.
And then we learn what their catch phrase, "bringing tap
into the '905," really means.
Brilliant shafts of light start playing over the stage and the
backdrop disappears to reveal the live musicians, complete

with drum sets, keyboards, steel drums, electric guitars —
the works. Wilkie's score is a perfect complement to the fre
netic pace of the dancing — it provides a smooth back
ground to the thunderous sounds of 12 boots tapping.
These guys have completely reinvented the idea of tap
dancing — which has long been associated with sissiness.
There is nothing sissy about this show. The image they project
is one of power, strength and boundless energy. I got swept up
in it. The rhythms of their feet and the throbbing music catch
and hold the audience in openmouthed grins of delight. I
couldn't help but cheer when two of them hoisted a third to
the "ceiling," where he tap dances upside down, repeating ex
actly what a fourth dancer is doing right side up, onstage.
This stuff is art for the masses: those who know anything
about tap will fall over themselves in awe, and those who
don't will watch and say, "Cool!" I never thought I'd use the
word "romp" with any seriousness, but the word captures the
spirit of "Tap Dogs" pretty well. Everyone — especially the
performers — is there to have a good time.
