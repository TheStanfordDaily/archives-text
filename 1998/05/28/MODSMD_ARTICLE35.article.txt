l.ast week, the band took a week-long
respite from its nationwide tour.
Intermission had an opportunity to
speak to a tired but enthusiastic Kurt
Sodergren, liig Had Voodoo Daddy's
drummer.
Intermission: How would you
define the genre that liig Had Voodoo
Daddy is creating?
Kurt Sodergren: I just think
we're a '90s swing band. We play the
traditional swing format. We write
swing songs — and it's 1998. I hat's
what we are.
I: Some would say that simply reviv
ing an old genre lacks originality and
creativity. How do you respond to that
criticism? What keeps it interesting?
KS: Well, I have to sav that I dis
agree because we are writing original
tunes. I know that there are a lot ol
bands out there that are just playing
cover songs, I don't think there's any
thing wrong with that because there's
a huge market tor dance bands. We're
trying to take it a step further. I here
are always going to be critics th.it say
that we're not (original), but I think
there are a lot ol people who think we
are, as well.
I: There seems to be competition
between rising swing groups. How do
you feel about this competition and
about other groups like the ( berry
Poppin' Daddies and the Squirrel Nut
Zippers? ,
KS: I used to take drum lessons
from Daniel (ilass from the Royal
Crown Review. I really think they're
the masters of the genre. We've played
shows with them, and they've always
been my favorite. Squirrel Nut Zippers
— we've played a couple ol shows with
them as well, and I'm a big fan of
theirs. And the ("berry Poppin'

Daddies we've probably played with the
most. As far as I'm concerned, we're as
' thick as thieves we get along really well.
I think it's good that everyone in his own
way is paving a little road to net this music
popular. The C.herry Poppin' Daddies are
doing a phenomenal job because the
group is getting .1 lot ol airplay. We owe.
them a debt lor helping to get the musk
Heard.
I: lalk to me about how your music
evolved during your 18 months playing at
the Derby.
KS: I he Derln was rea 11 \ exciting. We.
had just come out with our first record

ami wo h.ul done .1 little bit ol .touring in
the Northwest. Hut we knew we h.ul some
really hit* shoes to till, because it was a spot
originalh held In the Royal ( row 11
Review. We really cut our teeth there. I
think when we went in there we were a
rough band. We honed our live show ami
developed our chops. When you go to I os
Angeles, vpu lay it all out 011 the line. You
have to do a good job, because people will
know the difference. I think that was a
great place for us to go. It was a trial by lire

of sorts we got very good. The talent in
the band increased tremendously. I hat's
when we realized we needed to add play
ers. It was such a testing ground for hands
and we had seen other bands —' and we
played with Red Young on piano. Once he
played with us we just knew we had to have
. that sound. We met Karl, who became our
tenor sax player. He was just a monster —
we couldn't get along without him. I hey
used to come and sit in with us. and alter a
while we realized that they just added so
much that they needed to be part of the
band. I he hand got a lot more mature and
grew. We had potential, and at the Derln

we really grew iiilu that potential.
I: In what ways did ItiHail Voodoo'
I >addv's appearances in the movie
"Swingers" and the "Party of live"
Soundtrack hoost its popularity?
KS: I hev've both been extremely effec
tive in getting our name out across the
country. Right after the "Party of l ive*"
slot, which was fust, we were getting corre
spondence from as far away as Bra/il. Sony
Studios actually had to add phone lines to
take the new volume ot calls they were get-

ting about us. When we met John
((inertner, "Swingers" screenwriter) at the
I Vrbv, he became a trieiul ot ours and told
lis ahout his film and asked us to be a part
of it. It wasn't even for money — we got
maybe $100 to do it. We just did it because
it \vas such a cool scene happening at the •
Derby, and we thought that |ohn could do
a good job ot capturing it on film. There
was a line around the block at every movie
theater in los Angeles up to a week after
the movie opened. And after the video
came out, lorget it you couldn't get into
the |)erbv on a prayer.
I; big Had Voodoo l>add\ is now

recording under the ( oulsvillc div ision ol
Capitol Records after .111 independent he
ginning. I low did th.it relationship begin?
KS: We met Brad Benedict, who was re
sponsible lor the Ultra loOnge CDs. On
that ( J) were simply-new mixes ol tunes
from the Capitol vaults that hadn't been
previously released. He was interested in
doing a contemporary compilation, so he
brought us into the studio at Capitol
Records and we recorded "lumping lack."
lie was so excited about it that he wanted
to make a whole record with us. So far we
had deflected attempts by larger labels to
find the band and put us into a little pi
geonhole. We thought that would really
spell death for |us|. We decided that we
wanted to hold onto artistic control, and
Brad was totally down with that, lie had
no problem with us calling the shots. Me
trusted what we could do, and we trusted
what he could do. He did a wonderful job
of producing the record and letting us do
whatever we wanted. We'd just come in the
studio and he'd say,"What do you want to
record today?" He brought in a great engi
neer and others lie thought could add to
the sound of the band. So the best thing
about Coolsville is we still have artistic
control over the band.
I: You've been quoted as saying, "We get
kicked out of every single club we play."
What does that mean?
KS: We're all really big fans of music,
and we go out together and see music a lot.
Many times we really want to meet the
musicians afterwards and they don't come
out to say hello. So we decided early on
that when we play, we'll always come out
after the show and meet the audience be
cause that's what we would want as fans.
The reason we're playing is for the people,
so we want to come out and thank them
for coming and supporting our music.
Usually we just talk and hang out for so
long that the bouncers have to end up
kicking us out.
I: Is this resurgence of swing just a tad,
or is it going to stick around? Where do you
see Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in five years?
KS: Wow, that's a tough one. If you
would have asked me that last year, I
would have said I wished that "Swingers"
would do as.well for us as it did, and that
we could tour-around the country, which
we've been doing. My hopes for the next
five years are to break the music in I u rope,
lapan and Australia, and play David
l.etterman and Saturday Night Live. I also
hope to share our music with as many
people as we possibly can and never get
too big that we can't come out and thank
everyone after the show. If it's not fresh
anymore, we're not going to do it. But I
don't see that happening. I don't know
how long the swing scene is going to last,
but I know there w ill be some great bands
that come out of the scene that will stav for
awhile. Otie reason I think swing will stay
is tli.it men and women love to dance with
each other, and I don't think that's going
awav. I hope it doesn't burn out there's
a risk that people will realize its popularitv
and tr\ to o\ercommercialize it.

maybe $100 to do it. We just did it because
it \vas such a cool scene happening at the •
Derby, and we thought that |ohn could do
a good job ot capturing it on film. There
was a line around the block at every movie

that ( J) were simply-new mixes ol tunes
from the Capitol vaults that hadn't been
previously released. He was interested in
doing a contemporary compilation, so he
brought us into the studio at Capitol
Records and we recorded "lumping lack."
lie was so excited about it that he wanted
to make a whole record with us. So far we
had deflected attempts by larger labels to
find the band and put us into a little pi
geonhole. We thought that would really
spell death for |us|. We decided that we
wanted to hold onto artistic control, and
Brad was totally down with that, lie had
no problem with us calling the shots. Me
trusted what we could do, and we trusted
what he could do. He did a wonderful job
of producing the record and letting us do
whatever we wanted. We'd just come in the
studio and he'd say,"What do you want to
record today?" He brought in a great engi
neer and others lie thought could add to
the sound of the band. So the best thing
about Coolsville is we still have artistic
control over the band.
I: You've been quoted as saying, "We get
kicked out of every single club we play."
What does that mean?
KS: We're all really big fans of music,
and we go out together and see music a lot.
Many times we really want to meet the
musicians afterwards and they don't come
out to say hello. So we decided early on
that when we play, we'll always come out
after the show and meet the audience be
cause that's what we would want as fans.
The reason we're playing is for the people,
so we want to come out and thank them
for coming and supporting our music.
Usually we just talk and hang out for so
long that the bouncers have to end up
kicking us out.
I: Is this resurgence of swing just a tad,
or is it going to stick around? Where do you
see Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in five years?
KS: Wow, that's a tough one. If you
would have asked me that last year, I
would have said I wished that "Swingers"
would do as.well for us as it did, and that
we could tour-around the country, which
we've been doing. My hopes for the next
five years are to break the music in I u rope,
lapan and Australia, and play David
l.etterman and Saturday Night Live. I also
hope to share our music with as many
people as we possibly can and never get
too big that we can't come out and thank
everyone after the show. If it's not fresh
anymore, we're not going to do it. But I
don't see that happening. I don't know
how long the swing scene is going to last,
but I know there w ill be some great bands
that come out of the scene that will stav for
awhile. Otie reason I think swing will stay
is tli.it men and women love to dance with
each other, and I don't think that's going
awav. I hope it doesn't burn out there's
a risk that people will realize its popularitv
and tr\ to o\ercommercialize it.

liig Had Voodoo Daddy lias been play
ing a neo-swing style since IW2. Shilling
in /995, llic group field an IH-month spat
at Hollywood's famous Derby nightclub. It
was there that the band deyeloped its
uniipie style and began to grow popular. /\
feature spot in the film "Swingers" helped
to catapult liig Had Voodoo Daddy to
fame. Since its time at the Derby, the baud
has been touring and recording its most
recent release, a sell titled album.

recent release, a seif-iiiiea aitmm.
l.ast week, the band took a week-long
respite from its nationwide tour.
Intermission had an opportunity to
speak to a tired but enthusiastic Kurt
Sodergren, liig Had Voodoo Daddy's
drummer.
Intermission: How would you
define the genre that liig Had Voodoo
Daddy is creating?
Kurt Sodergren: I just think
we're a '90s swing band. We play the
traditional swing format. We write
swing songs — and it's 1998. I hat's
what we are.
I: Some would say that simply reviv
ing an old genre lacks originality and
creativity. How do you respond to that
criticism? What keeps it interesting?
KS: Well, I have to sav that I dis
agree because we are writing original
tunes. I know that there are a lot ol
bands out there that are just playing
cover songs, I don't think there's any
thing wrong with that because there's
a huge market tor dance bands. We're
trying to take it a step further. I here
are always going to be critics th.it say
that we're not (original), but I think
there are a lot ol people who think we
are, as well.
I: There seems to be competition
between rising swing groups. How do
you feel about this competition and
about other groups like the ( berry
Poppin' Daddies and the Squirrel Nut
Zippers? ,
KS: I used to take drum lessons
from Daniel (ilass from the Royal
Crown Review. I really think they're
the masters of the genre. We've played
shows with them, and they've always
been my favorite. Squirrel Nut Zippers
— we've played a couple ol shows with
them as well, and I'm a big fan of
theirs. And the ("berry Poppin'

Daddies we've probably played with the
most. As far as I'm concerned, we're as
' thick as thieves we get along really well.
I think it's good that everyone in his own
way is paving a little road to net this music
popular. The C.herry Poppin' Daddies are
doing a phenomenal job because the
group is getting .1 lot ol airplay. We owe.
them a debt lor helping to get the musk
Heard.
I: lalk to me about how your music
evolved during your 18 months playing at
the Derby.
KS: I he Derln was rea 11 \ exciting. We.
had just come out with our first record

ami wo h.ul done .1 little bit ol .touring in
the Northwest. Hut we knew we h.ul some
really hit* shoes to till, because it was a spot
originalh held In the Royal ( row 11
Review. We really cut our teeth there. I
think when we went in there we were a
rough band. We honed our live show ami
developed our chops. When you go to I os
Angeles, vpu lay it all out 011 the line. You
have to do a good job, because people will
know the difference. I think that was a
great place for us to go. It was a trial by lire

of sorts we got very good. The talent in
the band increased tremendously. I hat's
when we realized we needed to add play
ers. It was such a testing ground for hands
and we had seen other bands —' and we
played with Red Young on piano. Once he
played with us we just knew we had to have
. that sound. We met Karl, who became our
tenor sax player. He was just a monster —
we couldn't get along without him. I hey
used to come and sit in with us. and alter a
