## 'Girlfriend in a Coma' 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
"Girlfriend in a coma I know
I know
It's serious"
— The Smiths / Morrissey
Douglas Coupland's new novel,"Girlfriend
in a Coma," (HarperCollins, $24) uses
fantastical elements to tell what is essen
tially a moral tale. It is not a particularly con
trolled book and could probably have used a few
revisions. However, the author writes with deep
conviction and high energy. These elements re
deem the less fulfilling aspects of the book.
The book sets the scene in Vancouver, Canada
during the late 1970s and then telescopes the
lives of its characters into the present day. The
main characters are six high school friends in the
heady and now faraway days of that decade.
The first scenes have the eerie atmosphere of a
movie you almost remember seeing. Clouded vi
sions become the center of the story when Karen,
a good-hearted brunette, sees the future. She
writes it down, confides in her boyfriend, has sex
for the first time, goes to a party, downs two diet
pills with some vodka and falls into a coma. Nine
months later she gives birth to Megan, the child
she and her boyfriend Richard conceived on her
last night on earth.
The empty and fruitless lives of this family and

their friends are the center of the novel. The failure of modern Americans to truly possess
their lives or characters is Coupland's main point. He writes to tell us that he knows how
we procrastinate, complain, consume, give up, give in, shoot up, sin, sleep and otherwise
use any means necessary to avoid reality. His novel teaches a convincing and inspiring les
son about what we collectively fail to face and what we should be doing instead.
Coupland is an optimist. He uses comas and premonitions to show us that people can
change if they are given a second chance. It's a wonderful life, he says, so why are you
squandering it?
