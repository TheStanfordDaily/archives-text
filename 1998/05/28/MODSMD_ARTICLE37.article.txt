# It's a wonderful life, but is it a wonderful book?

Where Coupland fails in is his creation of character. I his book is one of those en
semble pieces where each member of the group is a stereotype â€” the brainy one, the
jock, the stoner and so on. Together they look diverse and characteristic; individually

they are mysteries. Karen, the aforementioned "girlfriend in a
coma," turns out to be more clearly drawn than any of her five
comrades. Karen has specificity, both in and out of her mental
deep freeze. Her daughter Megan is confused and rebellious,
but like her mother she is a source of strength to her loved
ones. Richard, the father, is colorless and flat. The failures and
successes of most of the characters are played out on a back
drop more vivid than they are themselves.
Coupland eventually gets the authorial pleasure of sending
an apocalypse to take down the town. The disaster is the key to
the rebirth of Coupland's characters. Would George Bailey
truly have understood his situation and be able to reclaim his
life without the eradication of Bedford Falls?
The erasure of modern North America is done with great
creativity and is strong enough to have been the center of an
other book. Unfortunately, the strength of this part of the
novel makes the beginning seem even slower than it is.
This book needs more of Karen, not just as the key to an alternate
universe but as the emotional key to the characters and readers. Her
bewilderment at the world and at the lives of her friends and family
when she wakes up after 17 years is sensitive and touching.
Karen is the emotional heart of the book, but she's occasion
ally nudged out of the way by the lives of her four less interest
ing friends. Because these four are so boring, it's hard to read
their scenes without wondering what's happening with Karen,
Megan and Richard. The four might as well wear T-shirts em
blazoned, "Morally Confused Gen-Xers. Please Save Us." At least
then we wouldn't feel obliged to pay attention to their names.
"Girlfriend in a Coma" is not Coupland's best work.
"Microserfs" remains his finest novel, and the essays in

"Polaroids from the Dead" discuss many of the themes of "Girlfriend" with more clarity
and persuasiveness. "Girlfriend" is structurally flawed and the thinking is underdevel
oped, but it's essentially a risk-taking exercise that worked.
Luckily for us, Coupland brings new perspectives to previously explored themes in
each of his books; it will be interesting to see how the ideas first seen here develop.
Coupland's next book will be widely anticipated for this reason, if not for his vivid writ
ing and his clear view of what we're all about.
