I—^arrests. Over the course of 130 quick
-A- pages its narrator inexplicably trans
forms, painfully and erratically, into a pig
while the world around her collapses into
cruel totalitarianism. Strange, original and
very funny, Marie Darrieussecq's first novel
succeeds and surprises at every turn.
"Pig Tales" is set in a deviant Paris popu
lated by twisted literary inventions. Mad reli
gious zealots, dictators, werewolves and lech
erous foreign businessmen weave in and out of
the narrative. Orgies, revolutions, murders and
madness propel the story. All of this is
recorded by the narrator in cool deadpan
prose that constantly understates its cruel sub
ject matter: "The slippery parquet began to get
sticky with all that blood, which sort of helped
me regain my balance."
The narrator begins the story with her em
ployment at a sexual massage parlor. Her job
interview sets the stage for the rest of the
novel. "The director of Perfume Plus was hold
ing my right breast in one hand, the job con
tract in the other."
The interview can only progress one way,

and it does. Yet the main character doesn't concentrate on the action. Instead she thinks about the recent
changes that have started to come over her body: Her skin is becoming rubbery and she is gaining weight
in strange places.
She starts vomiting at the sight of ham, and all the men in her life — her priest, her doctor, her
boyfriend and her lecherous clientele — do little to help. They become increasingly disgusted as her
transformation progresses.
She loses her job. Her boyfriend throws her out. She moves from the sewers to the parks, barely able
to stand or speak. Her story becomes intertwined with the rise of Edgar, a lecherous fascist who drives his
country to chaos after he is elected president.
Darrieussecq's prose is pulled tightly over her horrifying tale. Hardly a word is wasted. The narrator's
metamorphosis is story enough, but Darrieussecq uses it, through incidental remarks, to describe the dis
integration of a corrupt and hypocritical society.
The prose is unsurprised by what it describes. Darrieussecq is a genius at making terror seem normal
and bland, letting grim laughter fill a space usually occupied by horror. Consider the attractions the nar
rator's health club offers: "... sharks were put in the pools for private receptions, and before the fresh
water killed them, they had five minutes in which to snap up the slowest guests. This created, it seems, a
unique ambiance at the festivities. Then everyone would swim in the red water until the wee hours."
This book's brevity makes it dense. Its symbols, crammed into such a small space, overlap, creating an
intriguing tangle of meaning. Darrieussecq explores feminism, the animal within, corruption and the
question of where conflicted personalities can find happiness. In the end her message seems simple
enough, even if it is impractical: better to be a fat pig, happy to wallow in mud, than be a woman in a so
ciety that wants to paint your face, force your breasts into the right shape and pay you with cruelty and
condescension.
What is amazing is that Darrieussecq can achieve such a powerful statement without all the familiar
techniques. She is never preachy. She feels no need to describe the real world in order to criticize it. This
is not just an allegory. Her bizarre inventions are not simply symbols relating to the real world. They are
the products of our society, drawn from its unspoken foundations. The lust, the terror, the horror that
informs "Pig Tales" is to be found all over the Western world. But in this novel they are given free reign,
unlimited by the constraints of realism.
This is the terrain of Gogol, Kafka and Beckett. This is life, pulled to pieces, drawn out to grotesque
extremes, strange but horribly familiar. The prose feels no responsibility to realism's hollow outward
flourishes: real people in recognizable places. Instead,"Pig Tales" cuts us open and spills our guts onto the
floor, with all the violence that the metaphor suggests. We are disgusted, we barely know what we are
looking at but, fascinated and curious, we unmistakably recognize ourselves. Eventually, we even manage
a small laugh.
