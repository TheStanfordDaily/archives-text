Day One — Memorial Day
11 a.m. Already armed with the questions we plan to ask, we begin brain
storming funny questions. "If you and Beck got into a fistfight, who would
win?" "Does your height have anything to do with your humor?" "We
know that we aren't supposed to ask about your ex-girlfriend, but how
about if you talk about her anyway?" We decide to keep the Beck one and
throw out the others.
11:15 a.m. Still no David. Nkomo begins to cry as she dials up his publi
cist at her home number.
"HE HASN'T CALLED?" says the publicist.
"No."
"And you were there on time?"
"Yeah, we've been here since 10 minutes before."
"Okay. I'll try calling him. Sit tight."
11:30 a.m. The phone rings. It's David's publicist.
"Has he called?"
"No."
"How much longer should we wait? I mean, is David the kind of person who
calls a little late sometimes? I know I am," Nkomo chuckles.
"No, he's not. Wait another 15."
11:45 a.m. We leave.
Day Two — The day after Memorial Day
11:30 a.m. Spade's publicist calls.
"It turns out that David didn't receive the fax saying that you would in
terview him yesterday. He was supposed to be in Arizona, but he didn't
end up going there, and that is where the fax was," she says.
"Okay!" Nkomo says, still cheery and giddy.
"David has a photo shoot all day today. He may have some time during
the afternoon. How long will you be at the office?"
"I have no more classes today," says Nkomo. "I will be here all afternoon."
5 p.m. No one calls. Nkomo laughs and laughs.
Day Three — The day after the day after Memorial Day
11:50 a.m. Nkomo runs to her office at The Daily. She senses something
has just happened.
11:51 a.m. Checks her voice mail.
"Hi, I'm trying to reach Nkomo. I'm calling from David Spade's office. I
wanted to see if I could get Mr. Spade on the phone with your folks this
afternoon for the interview regarding his show at the Frost Amphitheater
this Saturday."
The assistant leaves his number. Nkomo calls immediately and gets voice
mail. She leaves a message.
12:15 p.m. Skip, the assistant, calls back. Spade will call in 10 minutes.
12:30 p.m. Somehow, David Spade gets routed into voice mail. He leaves

a message.
"Nkomo, it's David. I'm trying to get a
hold of you before I have this meeting. I
heard you might be there. I'll try again in
a minute maybe, but if not, I will try a lit
tle later."
3 p.m. Nkomo tries to calm down.
Curses some. Smiles and smiles. Calls
David Spade's publicist. She says to talk
to Skip.
4 p.m. Nkomo leaves a voice mail for
Skip.
4:15 p.m. Nkomo goes to get a drink of
water. Misses Skip's call.
4:16 p.m. Nkomo leaves another voice
mail for Skip, this time promising
never to leave her chair.
4:17 p.m. Skip calls back. Spade will
call around 6:30 p.m.
6:35 p.m. Nkomo continues to be
cheerfal.

7:30 p.m. David Spade, who's completely cool and laid-back, speaks to
Nkomo. She laughs a nervous laugh.
8 p.m. The interview is over. The world is warm again.
