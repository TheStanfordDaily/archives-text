### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
Day One — Memorial Day
11 a.m. Already armed with the questions we plan to ask, we begin brain
storming funny questions. "If you and Beck got into a fistfight, who would
win?" "Does your height have anything to do with your humor?" "We
know that we aren't supposed to ask about your ex-girlfriend, but how
about if you talk about her anyway?" We decide to keep the Beck one and
throw out the others.
11:15 a.m. Still no David. Nkomo begins to cry as she dials up his publi
cist at her home number.
"HE HASN'T CALLED?" says the publicist.
"No."
"And you were there on time?"
"Yeah, we've been here since 10 minutes before."
"Okay. I'll try calling him. Sit tight."
11:30 a.m. The phone rings. It's David's publicist.
"Has he called?"
"No."
"How much longer should we wait? I mean, is David the kind of person who
calls a little late sometimes? I know I am," Nkomo chuckles.
"No, he's not. Wait another 15."
11:45 a.m. We leave.
Day Two — The day after Memorial Day
11:30 a.m. Spade's publicist calls.
"It turns out that David didn't receive the fax saying that you would in
terview him yesterday. He was supposed to be in Arizona, but he didn't
end up going there, and that is where the fax was," she says.
"Okay!" Nkomo says, still cheery and giddy.
"David has a photo shoot all day today. He may have some time during
the afternoon. How long will you be at the office?"
"I have no more classes today," says Nkomo. "I will be here all afternoon."
5 p.m. No one calls. Nkomo laughs and laughs.
Day Three — The day after the day after Memorial Day
11:50 a.m. Nkomo runs to her office at The Daily. She senses something
has just happened.
11:51 a.m. Checks her voice mail.
"Hi, I'm trying to reach Nkomo. I'm calling from David Spade's office. I
wanted to see if I could get Mr. Spade on the phone with your folks this
afternoon for the interview regarding his show at the Frost Amphitheater
this Saturday."
The assistant leaves his number. Nkomo calls immediately and gets voice
mail. She leaves a message.
12:15 p.m. Skip, the assistant, calls back. Spade will call in 10 minutes.
12:30 p.m. Somehow, David Spade gets routed into voice mail. He leaves

a message.
"Nkomo, it's David. I'm trying to get a
hold of you before I have this meeting. I
heard you might be there. I'll try again in
a minute maybe, but if not, I will try a lit
tle later."
3 p.m. Nkomo tries to calm down.
Curses some. Smiles and smiles. Calls
David Spade's publicist. She says to talk
to Skip.
4 p.m. Nkomo leaves a voice mail for
Skip.
4:15 p.m. Nkomo goes to get a drink of
water. Misses Skip's call.
4:16 p.m. Nkomo leaves another voice
mail for Skip, this time promising
never to leave her chair.
4:17 p.m. Skip calls back. Spade will
call around 6:30 p.m.
6:35 p.m. Nkomo continues to be
cheerfal.

7:30 p.m. David Spade, who's completely cool and laid-back, speaks to
Nkomo. She laughs a nervous laugh.
8 p.m. The interview is over. The world is warm again.

This Saturday, the Stanford Concert Network will bring actor / comedian
David Spade to Frost Amphitheater for an evening of stand-up comedy. Intermission got
a chance to speak to him between a day full of meetings and a dinner appointment.
Intermission: Why do you still do the college stand-up circuit?
David Spade: I am looking for a college student to marry, (laughs) I don't know.
I guess that stand-up started the whole thing, and it's still fun. It kinda gives me a feel

for what's funny and what's not. I get to see people, and
people watch me. 1 get to see different parts of the coun
try. I don't do it as much, because I am kind of burned
out on it, but if it's a good school or a place I want to go,
I'll do it. It usually works out pretty well.
I: What's been your worst stand-up experience?
DS: Well, I don't know. There are a million bad expe
riences from the old days. I did a very religious college
once. They didn't laugh at my first three jokes. I said,
"Guys, it's going to be a long 45 minutes, because if you
didn't like the first three, you ain't going to like the last
three. I can't switch up in the middle and change to
southpaw. I have one style. You can like it or love it." It
was a rough ride.
I: How did you get off the stage?
DS: In silence. I was like, "Look, I'm gonna throw you
guys a bone and bail, all right?" They cheered.
I: What do you think of the state of American comedy
now, as opposed to the way it was a few years ago with
Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and all of those guys?
DS: I liked Bill Murray. It's interesting that you picked
him; he's my favorite of all time. 1 don't know. You just
have to go with the flow. There's still room for comedy;
it was a little more fun back then because we could break
more ground. Nothing had been broken before then, re
ally. Things weren't so politically correct.
Now there's such pressure from every little dinky fac
tion out there who gets offended by everything. They
want a perfect world. No one can take jokes, even
though they are jokes and nothing else. All that pressure
too often makes every sitcom and every movie the same
little five-joke pool that you are allowed to say.
It starts to get to be a bore. I like to shake it up a bit.
There are a couple of people that are still true to what

they think is funny. They don't need to fake it. Whoever likes them, likes them. With
me, it's pretty safe, but if I think something's funny, I do it. I got a little shit for talk
ing about Jonßenet [Ramsey] on my HBO special, but it's like,"Hey, 1 wasn't even in
there. I wasn't even in Boulder, Colo, that night, so really you can't point to me."
I: Where do you want to be professionally?
DS* Work wise, I'm fine. I've done enough and I have enough in front of me so
that I am pretty happy. I get to do things the way I want to, so that helps. Life in gen
eral is pretty good right now. I try to keep everything sound and fun, and that's it. I
don't work too hard anymore.
I: Have you thought at all about going into a different genre, or do you want to
stick with "Tommy Boy" the whole time?
DS: I think if I inch my way around I will be all right. I have a girlfriend in my next
movie. I didn't ever have that before. It's kind of a romantic comedy. It's mostly a
comedy, though.
It Any good sex scenes in there?
DS* (laughs) Not in a PG-13 movie. But that's OK.
I: Who's your co-star?
DS* A nice girl, actually. She was in "Braveheart." She played the queen.
It Do you think comedy is the thing you are best at?
DS* I think it might be the only thing I'm good at. Honestly, it's the only thing I do.
A lot of people spread themselves so thin that they're like, "I race cars, and I'm an ac
tress, and Ido this and that..." To do something really well, you have to be obsessed.
You really can't be great at five things. You have to just pick one and run with it. I think
this is the thing that all the arrows are coming to point at. 1 am OK with that.

I: Are you worried about having so many things on your plate now? Do you ever
worry that people are going to like the kind of comedy you do less and less?
DS: That's a legitimate concern, but I've looked back over my stuff. I think it is the
same, but it's all different than it was five years ago. What I think is funny now is what
other people do at this point in time. I'm not doing jokes that were funny in 1982.
I just sorta weed that kind of joke out and use a new kind of joke. As long as I do
that, 1 should be able to stay in the loop somewhat. It's good for people to have a guy
like me with their sense of humor.
That's what I like about Bill Murray. He stays a variant of himself. I like that. I
think Eddie Murphy got in a little trouble because you find out that he's making $10
million a movie and he wears sunglasses all the time — he's so cool that he's not just

some street guy anymore. People get a whiff of that,
and they go, "Uh-oh." When Bruce Springstein mar
ries a model and starts wearing 8010 ties, he's cer
tainly not man of the people. Those are things to be
careful of, too.
I: So you want to stay a man of the people?
DSi I just like what I'm doing, and I will do what
ever I do and stand by it. Bruce Springstein has no
apologies. I'll just see what I do, and hopefully I'll be
fine. But you know what? I'm doing less and less. It
doesn't seem like it, but I am. I do a television show.
["Just Shoot Me"] is more worldwide now. The
show is in Australia, Canada and England. It's higher
stakes, so now if I screw up it's more widely noticed.
So I do the show the best I can, put all of my energy
into that, and do a movie here and there.
I: Where does your stand-up personality come
from?
DSt Yeah, it's basically an exaggeration of what I
think is funny. But I like the Al Pacinos, Robert
DeNiros and Johnny Depps, too. But that's just not
what I do. I am more of a Bill Murray, where I'm
more of a variation of who my persona is. I can get
that way. In five years I might be different.
l:Do you still think your old "Hollywood
Minute" stuff from "Saturday Night Live" is funny?
DSt I still think my "Hollywood Minute" stuff
is funny, and I think it was funny then. I just don't
think I would write that exact stuff now. It was ex
actly what I was thinking at the time. Would I
have done that had I started four or five years
later? I don't know. I'd do similar stuff, probably,
but not exactly that.

It So you're saying you're in a completely different place now?
DSt Well, I think every couple of years you're in a different spot in the world with re
lationships and with life — and that's what all comedy is based on, so I guess that's that.
It Did you ever have a teen angst stage?
DSt Oh, yeah. It was horrifying. I think every kid goes through something where
he just can't take it anymore. It was a rough ride, and then when 1 got into showbiz,
it was rough for a couple of years and 1 didn't know what was going on. But I stuck
it out, thank God, and it's paid off. Things are good.
It What made you think that the entertainment industry was the place for you to
find your niche?
DSt I just tried stand-up for fun, and I thought, "Here's something I kinda dig. For
better or for worse, I'm just going to try this shit." So I tried and tried, and I wasn't
any good, but I thought, "If I can ever pay the bills, then people won't bother me. I
won't have to borrow money, and I can just be in my little world up here. I can have
a lot of fun."
It just snowballed. I got good at one thing and then I got out and did more. Now
I'm knee-deep in the biz. If I'm smart, I should last a while.

more ground. Nothing had been broken before then, re
ally. Things weren't so politically correct.
Now there's such pressure from every little dinky fac
tion out there who gets offended by everything. They
want a perfect world. No one can take jokes, even
though they are jokes and nothing else. All that pressure
too often makes every sitcom and every movie the same
little five-joke pool that you are allowed to say.
It starts to get to be a bore. I like to shake it up a bit.
There are a couple of people that are still true to what

they think is funny. They don't need to fake it. Whoever likes them, likes them. With
me, it's pretty safe, but if I think something's funny, I do it. I got a little shit for talk
ing about Jonßenet [Ramsey] on my HBO special, but it's like,"Hey, 1 wasn't even in
there. I wasn't even in Boulder, Colo, that night, so really you can't point to me."
I: Where do you want to be professionally?
DS* Work wise, I'm fine. I've done enough and I have enough in front of me so
that I am pretty happy. I get to do things the way I want to, so that helps. Life in gen
eral is pretty good right now. I try to keep everything sound and fun, and that's it. I
don't work too hard anymore.
I: Have you thought at all about going into a different genre, or do you want to
stick with "Tommy Boy" the whole time?
DS: I think if I inch my way around I will be all right. I have a girlfriend in my next
movie. I didn't ever have that before. It's kind of a romantic comedy. It's mostly a
comedy, though.
It Any good sex scenes in there?
DS* (laughs) Not in a PG-13 movie. But that's OK.
I: Who's your co-star?
DS* A nice girl, actually. She was in "Braveheart." She played the queen.
It Do you think comedy is the thing you are best at?
DS* I think it might be the only thing I'm good at. Honestly, it's the only thing I do.
A lot of people spread themselves so thin that they're like, "I race cars, and I'm an ac
tress, and Ido this and that..." To do something really well, you have to be obsessed.
You really can't be great at five things. You have to just pick one and run with it. I think
this is the thing that all the arrows are coming to point at. 1 am OK with that.

I: Are you worried about having so many things on your plate now? Do you ever
worry that people are going to like the kind of comedy you do less and less?
DS: That's a legitimate concern, but I've looked back over my stuff. I think it is the
same, but it's all different than it was five years ago. What I think is funny now is what
other people do at this point in time. I'm not doing jokes that were funny in 1982.
I just sorta weed that kind of joke out and use a new kind of joke. As long as I do
that, 1 should be able to stay in the loop somewhat. It's good for people to have a guy
like me with their sense of humor.
That's what I like about Bill Murray. He stays a variant of himself. I like that. I
think Eddie Murphy got in a little trouble because you find out that he's making $10
million a movie and he wears sunglasses all the time — he's so cool that he's not just

some street guy anymore. People get a whiff of that,
and they go, "Uh-oh." When Bruce Springstein mar
ries a model and starts wearing 8010 ties, he's cer
tainly not man of the people. Those are things to be
careful of, too.
I: So you want to stay a man of the people?
DSi I just like what I'm doing, and I will do what
ever I do and stand by it. Bruce Springstein has no
apologies. I'll just see what I do, and hopefully I'll be
fine. But you know what? I'm doing less and less. It
doesn't seem like it, but I am. I do a television show.
["Just Shoot Me"] is more worldwide now. The
show is in Australia, Canada and England. It's higher
stakes, so now if I screw up it's more widely noticed.
So I do the show the best I can, put all of my energy
into that, and do a movie here and there.
I: Where does your stand-up personality come
from?
DSt Yeah, it's basically an exaggeration of what I
think is funny. But I like the Al Pacinos, Robert
DeNiros and Johnny Depps, too. But that's just not
what I do. I am more of a Bill Murray, where I'm
more of a variation of who my persona is. I can get
that way. In five years I might be different.
l:Do you still think your old "Hollywood
Minute" stuff from "Saturday Night Live" is funny?
DSt I still think my "Hollywood Minute" stuff
is funny, and I think it was funny then. I just don't
think I would write that exact stuff now. It was ex
actly what I was thinking at the time. Would I
have done that had I started four or five years
later? I don't know. I'd do similar stuff, probably,
but not exactly that.

It So you're saying you're in a completely different place now?
DSt Well, I think every couple of years you're in a different spot in the world with re
lationships and with life — and that's what all comedy is based on, so I guess that's that.
It Did you ever have a teen angst stage?
DSt Oh, yeah. It was horrifying. I think every kid goes through something where
he just can't take it anymore. It was a rough ride, and then when 1 got into showbiz,
it was rough for a couple of years and 1 didn't know what was going on. But I stuck
it out, thank God, and it's paid off. Things are good.
It What made you think that the entertainment industry was the place for you to
find your niche?
DSt I just tried stand-up for fun, and I thought, "Here's something I kinda dig. For
better or for worse, I'm just going to try this shit." So I tried and tried, and I wasn't
any good, but I thought, "If I can ever pay the bills, then people won't bother me. I
won't have to borrow money, and I can just be in my little world up here. I can have
a lot of fun."
It just snowballed. I got good at one thing and then I got out and did more. Now
I'm knee-deep in the biz. If I'm smart, I should last a while.


'Now there's such pressure from every little dinky

They want a perfect world. No one can take jokes,
even though they are jokes and nothing else.'
Day One — Memorial Day
11 a.m. Already armed with the questions we plan to ask, we begin brain
storming funny questions. "If you and Beck got into a fistfight, who would
win?" "Does your height have anything to do with your humor?" "We
know that we aren't supposed to ask about your ex-girlfriend, but how
about if you talk about her anyway?" We decide to keep the Beck one and
throw out the others.
11:15 a.m. Still no David. Nkomo begins to cry as she dials up his publi
cist at her home number.
"HE HASN'T CALLED?" says the publicist.
"No."
"And you were there on time?"
"Yeah, we've been here since 10 minutes before."
"Okay. I'll try calling him. Sit tight."
11:30 a.m. The phone rings. It's David's publicist.
"Has he called?"
"No."
"How much longer should we wait? I mean, is David the kind of person who
calls a little late sometimes? I know I am," Nkomo chuckles.
"No, he's not. Wait another 15."
11:45 a.m. We leave.
Day Two — The day after Memorial Day
11:30 a.m. Spade's publicist calls.
"It turns out that David didn't receive the fax saying that you would in
terview him yesterday. He was supposed to be in Arizona, but he didn't
end up going there, and that is where the fax was," she says.
"Okay!" Nkomo says, still cheery and giddy.
"David has a photo shoot all day today. He may have some time during
the afternoon. How long will you be at the office?"
"I have no more classes today," says Nkomo. "I will be here all afternoon."
5 p.m. No one calls. Nkomo laughs and laughs.
Day Three — The day after the day after Memorial Day
11:50 a.m. Nkomo runs to her office at The Daily. She senses something
has just happened.
11:51 a.m. Checks her voice mail.
"Hi, I'm trying to reach Nkomo. I'm calling from David Spade's office. I
wanted to see if I could get Mr. Spade on the phone with your folks this
afternoon for the interview regarding his show at the Frost Amphitheater
this Saturday."
The assistant leaves his number. Nkomo calls immediately and gets voice
mail. She leaves a message.
12:15 p.m. Skip, the assistant, calls back. Spade will call in 10 minutes.
12:30 p.m. Somehow, David Spade gets routed into voice mail. He leaves

a message.
"Nkomo, it's David. I'm trying to get a
hold of you before I have this meeting. I
heard you might be there. I'll try again in
a minute maybe, but if not, I will try a lit
tle later."
3 p.m. Nkomo tries to calm down.
Curses some. Smiles and smiles. Calls
David Spade's publicist. She says to talk
to Skip.
4 p.m. Nkomo leaves a voice mail for
Skip.
4:15 p.m. Nkomo goes to get a drink of
water. Misses Skip's call.
4:16 p.m. Nkomo leaves another voice
mail for Skip, this time promising
never to leave her chair.
4:17 p.m. Skip calls back. Spade will
call around 6:30 p.m.
6:35 p.m. Nkomo continues to be
cheerfal.

7:30 p.m. David Spade, who's completely cool and laid-back, speaks to
Nkomo. She laughs a nervous laugh.
8 p.m. The interview is over. The world is warm again.

This Saturday, the Stanford Concert Network will bring actor / comedian
David Spade to Frost Amphitheater for an evening of stand-up comedy. Intermission got
a chance to speak to him between a day full of meetings and a dinner appointment.
Intermission: Why do you still do the college stand-up circuit?
David Spade: I am looking for a college student to marry, (laughs) I don't know.
I guess that stand-up started the whole thing, and it's still fun. It kinda gives me a feel

for what's funny and what's not. I get to see people, and
people watch me. 1 get to see different parts of the coun
try. I don't do it as much, because I am kind of burned
out on it, but if it's a good school or a place I want to go,
I'll do it. It usually works out pretty well.
I: What's been your worst stand-up experience?
DS: Well, I don't know. There are a million bad expe
riences from the old days. I did a very religious college
once. They didn't laugh at my first three jokes. I said,
"Guys, it's going to be a long 45 minutes, because if you
didn't like the first three, you ain't going to like the last
three. I can't switch up in the middle and change to
southpaw. I have one style. You can like it or love it." It
was a rough ride.
I: How did you get off the stage?
DS: In silence. I was like, "Look, I'm gonna throw you
guys a bone and bail, all right?" They cheered.
I: What do you think of the state of American comedy
now, as opposed to the way it was a few years ago with
Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and all of those guys?
DS: I liked Bill Murray. It's interesting that you picked
him; he's my favorite of all time. 1 don't know. You just
have to go with the flow. There's still room for comedy;
it was a little more fun back then because we could break
more ground. Nothing had been broken before then, re

it was rough for a couple of years and 1 didn't know what was going on. But I stuck
it out, thank God, and it's paid off. Things are good.
It What made you think that the entertainment industry was the place for you to
find your niche?
DSt I just tried stand-up for fun, and I thought, "Here's something I kinda dig. For
better or for worse, I'm just going to try this shit." So I tried and tried, and I wasn't
any good, but I thought, "If I can ever pay the bills, then people won't bother me. I
won't have to borrow money, and I can just be in my little world up here. I can have
a lot of fun."
It just snowballed. I got good at one thing and then I got out and did more. Now
I'm knee-deep in the biz. If I'm smart, I should last a while.


'Now there's such pressure from every little dinky
faction out there who gets offended by everything.
They want a perfect world. No one can take jokes,
even though they are jokes and nothing else.'
