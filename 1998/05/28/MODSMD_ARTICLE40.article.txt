## Van Halen: 'Van Halen 3' 
### 
Van Halen's appearance in 1978 sent shockwaves through the staid landscape of gui
tar-oriented rock. Both guitarist Eddie Van Halen, and, to a lesser extent, lead singer
David Lee Roth expanded the vernacular of their respective positions. After a few al
bums and growing success, Roth departed ana Sammy Hagar was brought on board. After
a few more albums (and even greater success), Hagar was dispensed with.
Van Halen 3 is the first album of Van Halen's third incarnation. The band is now led by
former Extreme singer Gary Cherone. Listening to the album, it is apparent that Cherone
was a good fit. Both Extreme and Van Halen were heading in the same direction — longer,
more complex songs with simple but pretentious lyrics.
And that's what Van Halen 3 has to offer. On paper, this may sound bad, but Van Halen 3
is actually quite enjoyable. The music is very good, and for heavy metal, the lyrics are
thoughtful and above average.
It is not the type of album that one savors every nook and cranny of, nor is it the most
accessible Van Halen album. I'd point neophytes toward the 1978 debut. But it is a re
spectable next step — if not a new innovation — on the Van Halen odyssey.
