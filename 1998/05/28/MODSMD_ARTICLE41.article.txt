# Nick Thompson:
## 'Sometimes Splatter Paints' 
### 
Nick Thompson (Class of '97) appreciates the soulful simplicity of a poet's language. His second album,
"Sometimes Splatter Paints" (Spitbug Sounds), whose title comes from a Pablo Neruda poem, has
Thompson plucking and strumming acoustic guitar, backed by mood and not much more.
Using a single instrument, Thompson creates wondrous complexity. Songs like "Ylime" rush up and down a path,
unclear, but still comfortably familiar. I'he tone changes more obviously in the joking "lousy tunes to smoke to." Its
metronomic beat outlines the tempo for the sort of country polka melody you can get out of a Casio mini-keyboard.
But the piece still fits remarkably well with the rest of the album. "Sometimes Splatter Paints" is a single voice and a
wealth of thoughts, emotions and images produced from those six and 12 strings. Thompson even transforms his

cover of the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby"
into his own creation, making the mu
sic swirl and labor.
The dimensions of space and con
sciousness that an idea must traverse in
order to reach its destination can end
up destroying the idea and its audience.
And sometimes what it needs is the
proper language. "Sometimes Splatter
Paints" is a success in expression. Both
"Sometimes Splatter Paints" and
Thompson's earlier album, "Red
Weather," are available directly from
the artist for $10: 214 Heath Street,
Chestnut Hill, MA 02167.
