# Michael Quinn

I almost felt sorry for Michael Quinn. He tried to make an album against all odds — no record
label, no big-name producers and worst of all, not a whole lot of creativity. The one thing he
does have, a borrowed Chris Isaak guitar, is not quite enough. After one listen to the Bay Area
musician's latest self-tided release, be prepared for plenty of disappointment But if you listen
really hard, and I mean really hard, you might be a little surprised.
Quinn almost gets away with another rehashed, uninspiring blues / rock album. The sound is
a bit unique, a Stevie Ray Vaughn-ish guitar with a myriad of organs and pianos thrown into the
mix. Unfortunately for Quinn, every song has music AND lyrics, and here lies the glaring weak
ness. Quinn should have done what most blues musicians do. He should have stolen old blues
classics and simply added his touch to it. The fact that he tries to write some original stuff earns
him a nod but that's about it
Even after listening several times to this album, I am still left with a sensation of, well, noth
ing. The first nine tracks all sound remarkably similar (anybody got Pufiys number?). Not un
til the 10th and final song, "Edge of My Seat," where, coincidentaliy, Isaak's guitar makes its de
but and a healthy hit of country is infused, did 1 finally pick my head up and listen. The good
news is that I still have a somewhat warm and fuzzy feeling about the CD. I can see a shade of
promise. Maybe you can feel sorry for Michael Quinn, too.
