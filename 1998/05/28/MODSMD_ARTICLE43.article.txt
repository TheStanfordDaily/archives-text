## 'Have a Nice Decade: The '70s Pop Culture Box' 
### 
There is nothing more frustrating than trying to find good 70s music Most
compilations contain the same 15 songs by the Allman Brothers, Three Dog
Night, Lynnard Skynnard and Al Green. Every now and then you find "I'll
Take You There* by the Staples Singers, which is nice. But generally, you're lucky if
you find any songs that weren't snapped up by beer commercials or Quenfin
Tarantino, and woe unto you if you hope to find anything by nonwhite groups.
Well, it is time to stop whining. In June, Rhino Records will release "Have A Nice
Decade: The 70s Pop Culture Box," a 7-disc collection of some of the best '70s mu
sic you can expect to hear anywhere. It's all here — the songs that everyone knows
right next to the songs that you never hear — from Sammy Davis Jr. singing "The

Candy Man" to "Brand New Key" by Melanie. "Why Can't
We Be Friends" by War is included and so is the original
Billy Paul version of "Me and Mrs. Jones," "Love Will Keep
Us Together" by Captain and Tennille, David Bowie's
"Fame" and "Brick House" by the Commodores.
One of the best things about "Have a Nice Decade" is the
variety. It's not all cock-rock, soul and disco. There's also
some stuff that can't quite be categorized, like "Dueling
Banjos" from the movie "Deliverance," "Popcorn" by Hot
Butter, "Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It)" by Daddy
Dewdrop, "The Cover of' Rolling Stone'" by Dr. Hook and
The Medicine Show, "Werewolves of London" by Warren
Zevon and that annoying "Indian Reservation" song that
we all cringe to hear.
Another great thing about the compilation is that it at
tempts to contextuaiize the music. Every few songs are pref
aced by short original newscasts from that crazy era, includ
ing one about how ridiculous it is to worry about damaging
the ozone layer. "To assume that some minuscule amount,
relatively speaking, of manmade chlorine-bearing sub
stances slowly diffusing into the stratospehere is going to
upset its balance is complete nonsense," says one '70s scien
tist who is probably dead now. It's amusing. That quote pref
aces "The Air That I Breathe" by The Hollies. Get it? It's cute.
While the compilation skips over a few hits, like
"Tonight" by Kool and the Gang, "Shake Your Groove
Thing" by Peaches and Herb, some Blondie hits and any
thing vaguely Led Zeppelin, the set makes up for it by be
ing visually pleasing.
The box set comes with a 90-page book filled with his
torical essays and photos, and comes wrapped in a smiley
face rug cover. The $99.98 suggested list price is a bit
daunting, but it isn't too bad considering what else is out
there. You can either buy this set or 10 other $10 compila
tions that won't be nearly as comprehensive or fun.
