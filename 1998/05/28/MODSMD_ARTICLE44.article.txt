# Steel Pulse:
## 'Rage And Fury' 
### 
Inspired by the sound of Steel
Pulse's new album, "Pulse and
Fury" (Mesa / Bluemoon Records),
I will write in a Jamaican accent. Get
ready, mon.
The new Steel Pulse album fills
the listenah with uplifting feelings
straight from the soul. From the get
go, with "Emotional Prisoner," the
Pulse energizes the listenah from
head to toe.
Music on the album really gets go
ing on "Role Model": "In the belly of
the beast / in dis ya struggle / dem a
chopping down / OUR role models,
they sing." The album is packed with
fiercely beautiful vocals and equally
powerful drumming and delicate bass.
Strength is channeled through
the music of Steel Pulse from a mas
tery it commands with its instru
ments. Each song flows smoothly
and softly, like running water.
Perhaps the best aspect of the mu
sic is strong variety, yah, on the al
bum like a traditional but innovative
and refreshing-like type of reggae.
The rhythm, mon, it flows and flows.
"I wake up in the morning and I
flash my natty dread yaah! Give
praises to the most high JAH." It is a
highly spiritual sound; Jah is hon
ored throughout the album.
Steel Pulse also sings a cover of
"Brown Eyed Girl," originally sung
by the great Van Morrison. The orig
inal feel of the song is still here, with
a roots reggae horns and organ.
There is something for all listeners
on this one. Steel Pulse has played
since the year 1975, singing songs of
Jah, strength and unity. I'm not so fa
miliar with reggae music, but I know
what I love and Steel Pulse is one
solid, solid group, mon.
