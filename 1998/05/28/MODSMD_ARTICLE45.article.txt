# Love Nut:
## 'Baltimucho!' 
### 
Of all the new albums I've
heard this year, 1 can't
think of any that would
be more ideal for a long, arche
typal American road trip than
Love Nut's "Baltimucho!" (Big
Deal Records). "Baltimucho!"
sounds like a sampler from some
modern rock radio station, but
without all of the crap that usually
makes radio suck.
Love Nut's secret is to combine

a ton of different influences —
Elvis, Journey, AC / DC, the
Kinks, the Sex Pistols, Black
Sabbath, etc. — into a hard-rock
ing hybrid. It's not quite punk, it's
not quite classic rock, and it's not
quite heavy metal. It's just
"Baltimucho!"
The songs are generally loud
and fast, with infectious guitar
hooks such as the chunky riff that
drives "Bob Pine" or the AC / DC

esque blare of "Love Found You."
However, a few ballads — "If You
Go Away" and "Everything is
Going Your Way" — sound like
Oasis without all the whining and
pretension. Finally, there are even
few prog-rock flourishes, like
Rush-style epic "Man Or
Machine?"
The miracle of "Baltimucho!"
is that all of these different genres
come together pretty seamlessly.

Each song
flows into the

next, and in the end they all blur
together like the scenery outside a
car window. Admittedly this gets a
little tedious, but "Baltimucho!"
isn't about listening to the lyrics
or even about knowing the names
to the songs. It's about something
grander than all that — loud gui
tars, squealing tires, an endless
highway and America.
