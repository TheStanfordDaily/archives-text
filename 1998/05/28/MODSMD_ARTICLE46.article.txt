# The 						Connells:
## 'Still Life' 
### 
The Connells' seventh album, "Still Life,"
sounds like it might push this band
into mainstream popularity. This 13-
track album, released on TVT Records, offers
a catchy collection of pop-rock songs with a
faint hint of folk pop on some of the tracks.

Although there's nothing outstanding in
the skills of these musicians, they definitely
have created some ear-catching songs that
stick in your head. Some songs, like "Crown,"
are more upbeat and have the kind of refrain
that makes you want to sing along. The third
track, "Bruised," opens up with an energetic,
catchy guitar riff. This song is followed by
"Curly's Train," which drifts into a more
folksy sound. Other tracks are a little more
mellow and slow with melodic guitars and
keyboards. This mood is best captured by the
instrumental closing track, "Pedro Says."

The band consists of Mike Connell on gui
tar and vocals, his brother David Connell on
bass, Doug MacMillan on lead vocals, George
Huntley on guitar and vocals, Peele
Wimberley on drums, and Steve Potak on
keyboards. The Connells, who hail from
Raleigh, N.C., began playing together in 1984.
They've reached popularity in North
Carolina's flourishing college music scene
and look forward to reaching more listeners
with the release of "Still Life."
