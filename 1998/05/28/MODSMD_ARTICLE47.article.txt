# 'Godzilla': A roaring mistake?
## Acting and plot are more frightening than the monster 
### 
C odzilla" is finally in theatres, but it is questionable whether it was really ready to be released last week. Months of secrecy have concealed the film's storyline and the appearance
Y_Jof the monster. Maybe this was because none of the producers had been able to figure out a plot.
Like with most monster movies, the makers of "Godzilla" focused their efforts on creating a believable monster. Unfortunately, they forgot about the human characters
along the way. As a result, the people in the movie are very shallow. Genetic scientist Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) and his college sweetheart, budding reporter
Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), act like mindless idiots through most of the film.
Godzilla definitely looks better than ever before. In this American production, Kenpachiro Satsuma doesn't get to act in his rubber Godzilla suit. Unfortunately, the new
Godzilla hasn't decided whether he walks on two or four feet. As a result, he doesn't really look the same from scene to scene. At times, he looks as friendly as a pet dog, but in

other scenes he behaves like a mad T-Rex.
The military can't figure out Godzilla, and neither can the writers
of the film. Does he live underwater, underground or on land?
Apparently they decided to leave this open so that Godzilla can con
veniently pop up in random places. More amazingly, the concept of
dying is also foreign to the writers. Let's just say that Godzilla comes
back to life half an hour after he's been killed.
The actors don't have much to work with, and it definitely shows.
Good actors can make cliches sound interesting; bad ones make
films look like high school productions. The actors in "Godzilla" fall
in the latter category.
The film is saved from complete failure by a few funny characters. For
one thing, the mayor of New York is named Ebert (Michael Lerner), and
his assistant is called Gene. Just like film critics Gene Siskel and Roger
Fbert, they fight about the smallest things. By the end, Gene has had
enough of Mayor Ebert, so he gives him the thumbs down sign.
More humor comes from Philippe Roche (Jean Reno), a French un
dercover agent who makes fun of American cuisine, language and cus
toms. It was refreshing to see another country's perspective for once.
The special effects of "Godzilla" were amazing, but a sensible plot and
decent acting would have been helpful.
