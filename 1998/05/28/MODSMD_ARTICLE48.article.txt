# Not so wild about 'Wilde'
## Tragic love affair is hard to swallow 
### 
C~T A T"ilde" fails to capture the complexity and uniqueness of Oscar Wilde. Nevertheless, it is a fair, though wanting,
\/\/ treatment of his turbulent and ultimately deadly affair with another man. It is rare that a biographical film suc
» * ceeds in providing an all-encompassing portrayal of its subject's life, so this movie tries to concentrate only on
Wilde's romantic relationships. Unfortunately, the film falls short of the epic status it wants to attain.
The first half-hour of the movie is a bit slow and generic as it takes us from Wilde's (Stephen Fry) successful 1882 American
speaking tour back to England where he is establishing himself as a master wit. "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" is a success —
he marries a beautiful and caring woman, his plays are performed on the London stage, and he and his wife have two healthy
sons — picture perfect. Well, only until we notice the sad and tormented look in Wilde's eyes after he runs away from a young
man who propositions him in the street.
Wilde eventually gives in to his homosexual urges. He plunges into a gay lifestyle when he meets and is transfixed by Lord Alfred
Douglas (Jude Law) — a man also known as Bosie. Bosie is a beautiful, spoiled and troubled Oxfordite who seems to provide Wilde
with the physical and intellectual relationship for which he yearns. Wilde neglects his family, his work, his finances and the rigid
expectations of his society as he falls in love with the mercurial Bosie.
Both Fry's and Law's performances are outstanding. Fry physically resembles Wilde, and he does a superb job of integrat
ing his looming presence with a softness that accentuates the author's candor and sensitivity. Law portrays Bosie as a
wounded, enraged cub. He is luxurious, explosive, effeminate and shamelessly exploitative. Boise's outrageous petulance,
however, makes it somewhat hard to understand why Wilde falls so hard for him. This lies at the core of the movie's failure
to provide a compelling picture of Wilde's and Bosie's relationship.
Wilde's life spirals toward its tragic end after he brings forth a libel suit against the marquis of Queensbury (Tom Wilkison),
Bosie's tyrannical, homophobic father. Wilde is convinced the public attack will keep the marquis from destroying his own son.
Instead, Wilde is sentenced to two years of hard labor for acts of "gross indecency," leading to his early death at the age of 46.
Wilde loses his life, and the world kills a genius for love. But what feeds the love story? When the movie ends, it leaves this
question mostly unanswered, making it hard for the audience to swoon with the end credits and the accompanying music.
"Wilde" shows Oscar and Bosie in bed and in pursuit of each other, but not truly in love. Perhaps that is the point, but it does
not make for an epic romance.
