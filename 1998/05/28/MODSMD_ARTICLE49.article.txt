# Take a little trip with me ...
## 'Fear and Loathing' spins a drugged-out tale 
### 
The film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas" stays true to the intent of the novel — it is an unadulter
ated and relentless drug trip of a movie that starts and ends with
Johnny Depp high on marijuana, acid, coke and, of course, ether.
Director Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame transforms the drug trips
of Thompson (Depp) and his sidekick "lawyer" Dr. Gonzo (adeptly played
by Benicio Del Toro) into a cinematic experience. As the film pounds image
after psychadelic image into the audience's heads, the tripping gradually
takes over the film until it is impossible to determine where reality ends and
the drugs begin.
The entire film is seen through the lenses of Thompson and Gonzo's in
toxications. No scene is left unblurred by the pair's twisted perspectives on
1971 Las Vegas.
In one scene, Thompson, a reporter sent to cover a dusty drag race out
side of Vegas, saunters into a hotel in tacky yellow sunglasses and a vivid
Hawaiian shirt. The clerk's face twists and turns as she reprimands him. Her
face suddenly morphs into a darting lizard's head, and Thompson leaps to
the ground. Later, he finds that he is in a bar full of walking reptiles, a sort
of frightening "Star Wars" cantina scene gone awry.
The special effects are nothing less than fascinating, and the movie's im
ages are frighteningly beautiful. Las Vegas — full of bright and gaudy peo-

pie, lights and hotels — is a perfect setting for the incessant drug trips. The camera jerk
ily zooms in and out from stark and colorful flashes of scene.
Yet, the camera tricks and special effects can only take this film so far. The drugs
quickly become tiresome.
Depp, who shaved his head to match Thompson's real-life baldness, never gets below
the surface of the character. His constant abrupt and quirky movements create a car
toon-like caricature of a person who in the end is disappointingly unendearing.
Del Toro, however, is excellent The man who played the lanky, clean-cut Fenster in"The
Usual Suspects" is now Gonzo, a fat, long-haired semblance of a lawyer. Gonzo provides
one of the few connections with reality. Thompson finds him in the hotel room bathtub,

writhing and moaning his way through a painful overdose. Del Toro's depiction momen
tarily cuts the comedy and hints at the awful reality behind the unending drug abuse.
For the most part,"Fear and Loathing" refuses to come down to earth. The film comes
to a close after making few attempts at conveying a deeper meaning. Thompson's words
early in the film about his frustrations with the failure of the anti-war, free-love move
ments of the late '60s are touching, but it is the last time the film connects with reality
before the final scene. The drug trips are unquestioned and unadulterated as the film
desperately tries to keep pace with the novel.
