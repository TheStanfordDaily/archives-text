# No hope for 'Hope Floats'
## Sandra Bullock's latest flick drowns in depression 
### 
C "¥" "¥"ope Floats" has all the makings of an uplifting tearjerker. It has your popular woman-making-it-out-on-her-own plot line. It has that catchy ti-
I I tie, which conveniently includes the word "hope." It has Sandra Bullock, the perennially smiley romantic-comedy queen, in the lead. And most revealingly, it has an all-
JL A female soundtrack that remakes such classics as "Stop (In the Name of Love)" into folksy blues ballads. Now if all that doesn't promise an engaging tearjerker with a

happy ending, what does?
Unfortunately, "Hope Floats" doesn't deliver on its promises. Not once is a tear jerked, simply because
none of the characters are engaging enough to merit sympathy.
"Hope Floats"centers around Birdee Pruitt (Bullock), her daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) and her hus
band Bill (Michael Par£), all of whom are from Smithville, Texas. (Right away, the choice of names should
indicate that this movie has the potential to be pretty ridiculous.) Birdee and Bill were the Queen and King
of Smithville in their glory days. But now they live in the big city of Chicago, where Bill is just another cor
porate drone and Birdee his dutiful homemaker sidekick.
One day, Birdee agrees to go on the Ricki-Lake-esque "Toni Post Show" for a makeover, only to find that
she is really there to be told that her best friend and her husband have been having an affair and are in love.
So Birdee packs up and moves back to Smithville to start over and discover that hope floats — or so we think.
Instead, hope remains lurking far below the surface for two relentlessly depressing hours before bobbing
up for a 30-second tacked-on ending. "Hope Floats" is basically a mediocre movie that, in its efforts to pull
at the heartstrings, often resorts to clich£d and manipulative tactics. Examples of this include strained
mother-daughter relationships, Harry Connick Jr.'s only somewhat-plausible love interest for Birdee, a death
that brings everyone together and an absolutely horrible scene in which Bernice finally realizes that her fa
ther is leaving for good.
Even the better scenes in "Hope Floats" (like the potentially comedic appearance on the "Toni Post Show")
are tainted by an overarching theme of despondency. Despite all outward appearances to the contrary, "Hope
Floats" sinks.

Gee, if I'd known my next flick would suck,
I would have gone for a part in "Godzilla."
