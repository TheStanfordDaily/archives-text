## Martian ice 
### 
BOSTON (AF) — Scientists studying the latest
photographs from Mars may have spotted the first
tividence of ice outside the planet's polar ice caps.
1 Pictures released for the first time yesterday at
the American Geophysical Union's spring meeting
«>how a crater some 30 miles across with a darker
area 12 to 18 miles wide at the bottom.
The discoloration indicates a deposit of some
sort — maybe frozen mud or sand — which could
indicate ice is present or water once was, said Mike
Malin. a consultant who helped design cameras for
the Mars Global Surveyor.
"If you're going to find life anywhere, that's
where you're going to find it. Water is essential for
life," Malin said.
Malin and other scientists associated with the
Surveyor mission also said there may be other
explanations for what they've spotted in the crater,
such as volcanic activity.
; But the presence of cracks at the crater's rim —
located about 2.4(H) miles south of Mars' equator —
are consistent with something seeping into the giant
pit from its edge. Malin said.
! The cracks look like the vertical lines on chapped
lips. The photos are the latest in a series from the
Mars Global Surveyor, a spacecraft orbiting the
planet since last fall. Its orbit is closer to Mars' than
any previously attempted, about 108 miles from the
surface.
