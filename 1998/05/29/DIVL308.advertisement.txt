A sil
A
s incoming editors
k of the Arcade, our
it. vision has been
to create a journal of lit
eracy — a literacy that
means awareness, or the
ability to think richly
about the art, politics and
culture that inform us.
Ann Le examines Toni
Morrison's new novel and con
cludes she is not at her finest, but
that she still remains faithful to her
artistic project. Tanvir Rahman
somehow envisions the willful
suicide of the twentieth century
Absurdist hero in Sisyphus and Jim
Peros ruminates about music. The
Arcade itself does not prescribe to
ideologue, but we can hardly
guarantee that our writers do not.
A survey of this issue's articles
confirms that. The first article by
Dave Hendrson has been reprinted
from the Hoover Digest, and
challenges liberal notions of the
growing income gap. The next
article by John Manley fires back
with a critique of capitalism, and
alas from ideologue we have a
dialogue. Perhaps like the stares of
Katz's paintings on page six, their
statements just fly past one another
without real communication. If so,
this is what we as editors loathe
about university publications. And
that's exactly why Erik Krueger
responds to Tanvir Rahman's
polemic against cultural studies
from the last issue. Without dia
logue, we "can't go on." We must
say words.
