Morrison manages it expertly
and creates a fluidity that keeps
the reader inside the fictional
dream.
The passage also reveals quite
a bit of foreshadowing, which is
one of the less enjoyable ele
ments of Paradise. Foreshadow
ing is helpful in establishing the
narrator's authority, especially
necessary in a novel loaded with
outlandish events, similar to
those that appear in Gabriel
Garcia Marquez's works of
magical realism. However, the
forshadowing in Paradise is a
bit heavy-handed, and it makes
the novel seem too contrived
and tidy.
