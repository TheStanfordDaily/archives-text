# Critical theory, multiculturalism am literary studies: a response
## Reader responds unfavorably to literary article from winter quarter's Arcade 
### Erik Krueger 
■ In response to "Aesthetics and the modern reader:
Oscar Wilde" by Tanvir Rahman (Arcade, Winter 1998,
pages 22-23).

Ihave two preliminary criticisms of Mr.
Rahman's article: his misreading of Oscar
Wilde, and his misuse of the same. Rather
than describe at length the numerous errors of
intention attributed to the divine O. W. by Mr.
Rahman, however, I would like to merely point
out here that he (Wilde) is often ironic. When he
declares, for example, in "Phrases and Philoso
phies for the Use of the Young," that "[a]ny preoc
cupation with ideas of what is right or wrong in
conduct shows an arrested intellectual develop
ment," Mr. Rahman should take him at his word,
but not seriously.

Therefore, when Rahman presses Wilde's "Preface" of/to The Pic
iure of Dorian Gray into service as a neoconservative argument against
critical theory in literary studies, he becomes, blatantly, "corrupt with
out being charming." Wilde is used, in Rahman's article, as a mask
for purposes of reactionary "flak"; i.e. a rather ingenuous and sopho
moric salvo in the culture wars which have been raging in and out of

the academy for the past few de
cades at least.
One of the key misrepresenta
tions of Wilde promulgated is the
absurd idea that he is somehow
opposed to art criticism generally,
or at least subordinates it to artis
tic creation. Instead, Wilde de
clares clearly in his "Preface" that
criticism is, itself, an art form, a
"translation" of an aesthetic im
pression "into another manner or
a new material." For those who

are interested in Wilde's elabora
tion of this point, I highly recom
mend Wilde's dialogic essay "The
Critic as Artist."
But all of this is ultimately be
side the point. Focusing, as does
Mr. Rahman, on literary studies,
I can make out three main asser
tions in his article, here given in
order of their greater to lesser ir
relevance: 1) that literary studies
in the academy should be prima
rily concerned with "aesthetic ap
preciation"; 2) that critical theory

There is not today, or ever was, an accred
ited academic program or discipline — at
Stanford or any other institution of higher
learning in the United States — in 'art ap
preciation.' The academy, for better or
worse, is, or has become, a business ...

distorts, violates, reduces, devalues, indeed "rapes" literature; and 3)
that "multiculturalism," as employed in the critical appreciation of,
or even selection of, texts for literary study, is offensive.
First, there is not today, or ever was, an accredited academic pro
gram or discipline — at Stanford or any other institution of higher
learning in the United States — in "art appreciation." The academy,
for better or worse, is, or has become, a business, and as a result,
academic disciplines focus on art from two "specialisf'/professional
perspectives: that of art producers (creative writing, musical compo
sition, studio art, etc.), and that of art consumers (literary studies,
musicology, art history, etc.). This may be an unfortun »te situation in
some respects, but since Mr. Rahman appears not to be interested in
criticizing the contemporary university in general, neither am I.
Second, and more importantly, "critical theory" includes every as
pect of art criticism. In the literary arena, critical theory would in
clude, for example, New Criticism, basic historiography, critical bi
ography and textual criticism, as well as feminist literary criticism,
New Historicism, deconstruction and cultural studies. That many
people seem to "mean" the latter group when they praise or condemn
"literary theory" is a misconception. Academic literary study is al
ways "theoretical," and, one would hope, always "critical." Since lit-

erature is a real — though occa
sionally sublime, object, and does
not exist in a void or, necessarily,
"speak for itself' — theoretical
approaches to "it" are a part of its
study in the academy.
Therefore, I am confused by
Rahman's assertion that "contem
porary literary discourse" is
somehow "destructive to litera
ture," etc. If Mr. Rahman is truly
