# Reader criticizes misreading of Wilde

claiming that critical theory, in and of itself, is capable of "destroy
ing" anything, then he is merely — although somewhat annoyingly
— mistaken. In presenting "theory" in the most millenarian of terms,
Rahman is following in the goose-steps of a veritable horde of reac
tionary fellow travelers: the "Bloom Brothers" (Allan and Harold),

Lynne Cheney, Dinesh D'Souza,
Roger Kimball, et al., and yet he
adds nothing to their already quite
weak arguments.
The only way that literature is,
was, can be, or could be destroyed
is in the literal flames of conser
vative intellectual backlash, i.e.
involving book-burning, black
listing, and all of the other famil
iar modes of mass hysteria created
by the willful manipulation of un
informed "public opinion." (Cf.
Wilde: "Public opinion exists only

where there are no ideas.") Just for the record: Academic feminism
has never suppressed literature; Lacanian psychoanalytic reading has
never endorsed censorship; New Historicism, Marxist literary criti
cism, semiotics and "multiculturalism" (of any sort related to the aca
demic study of literature) have never encouraged any form of restric
tion on any kind of reading of any sort of text in any way.
This is perhaps part of Mr. Rahman's point. For some reason un
clear to me, he seems to want to argue — but does not — that the
critical understanding of literature in general (high and low, Anglo
traditional and "multicultural," poetic and rhetorical, fictional and non)
is a form of "wrongful conduct." Such "literature," as I see it, would
include authors writing in English (for example) as diverse as: Kathy
Acker, Henry Adams, Edward

Albee, Amiri Baraka, Dennis
Cooper, Charles Eastman, Bessie
Head, Aemilia Lanyer, Gus Lee,
Cherrie Moraga, Salman Rushdie,
Leslie Silko, John Skelton,
Gertrude Stein, John Wilmot
(Rochester) and, hopefully, many
more. I don't see what is "wrong"
with literary theorists reading and
offering to teach in an academic
setting, whatever they desire. If
some students somehow don't
want to read the material offered

in a particular syllabus, they will not be (and are not, in fact) forced to
do so, and the classes will or will not be offered according to student
demand.
Third, and here quite crucially, "multiculturalism" is not something
artificially "implanted" in the academy. When the collective student
bodies of various universities began to demand courses that were more
pertinent to their interests, starting most forcefully in the 1940s and
continuing today, the universities followed suit. Students, after all,
are the primary clients of the university, and should be. "American"
literature (including such "timeless classics" as, say, Hawthorne,

I don't see what is 'wrong' with literary theo
rists reading and offering to teach in an
academic setting, whatever they desire. If
some students somehow don't want to
read the material offered in a particular syl
labus, they will not be ... forced to do so.

Mr. Rahman's attack on multiculturalism
operates ... under the semi-covert and
thoroughly mistaken assumption that there
is an eternal, universal canon of literature
that is now being compromised by 'includ
ing' various 'other people' in it.

James, Melville, Poe) was not taught at universities in the United
States as a matter of course until students began to demand it. The
same was true of English language literature in general (not taught in
the academy until the turn of the century). Before this, Latin and Greek
GRAMMAR, not literature, composed the humanities core curricu-

lum. Literary studies is therefore
a very recent addition to the acad
emy.
Mr. Rahman's attack on
multiculturalism operates, then,
under the semi-covert and thor
oughly mistaken assumption that
there is an eternal, universal
canon of literature that is now
being compromised by "includ
ing" various "other people" in it.
This is simply ridiculous. No one
has ever suggested that "every-

one" read "everything" that is
"worth reading," and if someone does, one should call the proper
authorities.
It is somewhat sad, therefore, to see Mr. Rahman lamenting the
fact that literary studies is being seen "more and more" as a specific
branch of "cultural studies," and that, following from this, the "canon"
has been opened up to include, as he mentions — horrified — in his
article, writing by: pregnant women, American slaves, Native Ameri
cans, women in general, nonwhites, the working class, French theo
rists, "French women writers" (say, George Sand, Colette, Marguer
ite Duras), non-Europeans and others.
Rahman labels this "opening up," not inaccurately,
"multiculturalism." His "personification" of this idea, however, seems

quite ominous, as is perhaps the
intention. I would be terrified to
meet "the multiculturalists" in a
dark alley, going solely on the (in
adequate) information contained
in Mr. Rahman's article. I imag
ine a similar terror, however,
could be roused in the "rabble"
who read the Arcade by terms
such as "literaturists" or, better,
"monoculturalists," as in: "Audre
Lorde is no longer being read due
to the suspicious activities of the
monoculturalists!"

Thankfully, the idea of multiculturalism, itself, is not particularly
obscure. In her 1990 presidential address to the Modern Language
Association, Catherine Stimpson defined the term as "the necessary
recognition that we cannot think of culture unless we think of many
cultures at the same time." Personally, I'm not sure why this "recog
nition" should be regarded as anything other than common sensical,
but perhaps Mr. Rahman can explain the controversy to me, by way
of further dialogue.
