# The
						rich — and poor — are getting richer
## Hoover fellow questions notion that income gap between rich and poor grows larger 
### David R. Henderson 
gap between rich
and poor is neither as
large nor as ominous as
many would have us believe.
In 1995, according to the U.S. Department
of Commerce, the one-fifth of U.S. house
holds with the lowest incomes received only
3.7 percent of all household income, down
from 4.3 percent in 1980. The top quintile, in
contrast, received about 48.7 percent of all
income in 1995, up from 43.7 percent in 1980.
Does this mean that the rich are getting richer
and the poor, poorer? No, for three reasons.
First, the government data reflect shares of
income, not absolute income. A slightly lower
share, if it's a share of a much higher total, is
still a higher income. Between 1980 and 1995,
household income as measured by the Depart
ment of Commerce rose froms3.2l trillion to
$4.48 trillion, all in 1995 dollars. But the mea
sure that the Commerce Department uses to
adjust incomes to 1995 dollars is the consumer
price index, which overstates annual inflation
by about 1 percentage point. Adjusted cor
rectly, the average real income for households
in the lowest fifth rose by 15 percent between
1980 and 1995.
Poor Consumption Index
Because of the problems with measuring
income and adjusting for inflation, there's a
better way to measure the well-being of a
household: See what's in the house. Is there a
washing machine, a color television, a VCR?
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas used this method to estimate how
households defined as poor fared between
1984 and 1994. The answer? They're doing
much better. In 1984, 70.3 percent of poor
households had a color TV; by 1994,92.5 per

cent of poor families had one. Whereas 3.4
percent of households had a VCR in 1984,10
years later, 59.7 percent did. And 71.8 per
cent of poor families had one or more cars in
1994, up from 64.5 percent in 1984.
Second, to call someone rich or poor, you
have to know that person's wealth, not his in
come. A retiree who receives only $12,000
annually in Social Security benefits and who
owns a $300,000 house with no mortgage
would still be counted in the lowest fifth. It's
true that income and wealth are positively
correlated, but the correlation is far from per
fect.
Our Incredible Income Mobility
The third reason the line between those
getting richer and poorer becomes blurred is
the incredible income mobility that the United
States enjoys. Today, people in the lowest fifth
of the income bracket are likely to be in a
higher one in a few years. Imagine that you
could take a picture of everyone in the lowest
quintile; nine years later, you take another pic
ture of that quintile. How many people would
be in both? Surprisingly few.
A 1992 study done by the U.S. Treasury
confirmed this. After tracking before-tax in
come for 14,351 taxpayers between 1979 and
1988, the Treasury economists found that of
the taxpayers in the bottom quintile in 1979,
only 14.2 percent (or one in seven) were still
there in 1988. Meanwhile, 20.7 percent had
moved to the next higher fifth, 25 percent to
the middle fifth, 25.3 percent to the second
highest fifth, and 14.7 percent to the highest
fifth. Thus, a taxpayer in the lowest bracket
in 1979 was about as likely to be in the high
est fifth nine years later as to have stayed in
the lowest fifth.
Why is mobility so high? The most impor
tant factor is age. Heavily represented in the
bottom quintile are young people who have
just graduated from high school or college and
are living on their own. Their current earn
ings are low, but as they age and gain skills,

their earnings rise. Similarly, overrepresented
in the lowest quintile are retired people who
may be wealthier than the average family but
don't have high incomes. Other factors mat
ter, too. A worker who lost a job may have
had a low annual income one year, but then
he finds another job. Or a divorced mother
may be in the lowest quintile, but nine years
later she is remarried or working in a produc
tive job and has a much higher family income.
There is an underclass of people who are
born into poverty and live their whole lives
that way, but it's much smaller than you might
think. For most of the people classified by the
government as poor on the basis of their in
come, poverty is temporary. In the 10 years
from 1969 to 1978, for example, only 2.6 per
cent of the population was classified as poor
for eight years or more. During that same pe
riod, 24.4 percent were classified as poor for
at least one year. Of the poverty spells experi
enced by the nonelderly, 43 percent occurred
when the marriage ended in divorce, a child
was born, or someone in the family set up an
independent household.
More than 15 state governments have be
gun ending certain cash benefits for families,
and welfare experts such as Thomas Fraker,
an economist with Mathematica Policy Re
search in Washington, D.C., are realizing that
removing people from the welfare rolls hasn't
left them living in the streets. In lowa, for
example, welfare rolls have declined by 30
percent in the past three years because the gov
ernment is ending cash aid for about 180 fami
lies a month. In a study that tracked 137 of
those families, Mr. Fraker found that about
half had incomes slightly higher than or equal
to their previous cash welfare benefits; the
other half had slightly lower incomes. Mr.
Fraker and other participants in the welfare
study industry were surprised. They shouldn't
be. Set up incentives so that welfare recipi
ents lose a work dollar when they earn a work
