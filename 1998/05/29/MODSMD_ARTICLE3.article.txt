# The 						rich — and poor — are getting richer
## Hoover fellow questions notion that income gap between rich and poor grows larger 
### David R. Henderson 
gap between rich
and poor is neither as
large nor as ominous as
many would have us believe.
In 1995, according to the U.S. Department
of Commerce, the one-fifth of U.S. house
holds with the lowest incomes received only
3.7 percent of all household income, down
from 4.3 percent in 1980. The top quintile, in
contrast, received about 48.7 percent of all
income in 1995, up from 43.7 percent in 1980.
Does this mean that the rich are getting richer
and the poor, poorer? No, for three reasons.
First, the government data reflect shares of
income, not absolute income. A slightly lower
share, if it's a share of a much higher total, is
still a higher income. Between 1980 and 1995,
household income as measured by the Depart
ment of Commerce rose froms3.2l trillion to
$4.48 trillion, all in 1995 dollars. But the mea
sure that the Commerce Department uses to
adjust incomes to 1995 dollars is the consumer
price index, which overstates annual inflation
by about 1 percentage point. Adjusted cor
rectly, the average real income for households
in the lowest fifth rose by 15 percent between
1980 and 1995.
Poor Consumption Index
Because of the problems with measuring
income and adjusting for inflation, there's a
better way to measure the well-being of a
household: See what's in the house. Is there a
washing machine, a color television, a VCR?
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas used this method to estimate how
households defined as poor fared between
1984 and 1994. The answer? They're doing
much better. In 1984, 70.3 percent of poor
households had a color TV; by 1994,92.5 per

cent of poor families had one. Whereas 3.4
percent of households had a VCR in 1984,10
years later, 59.7 percent did. And 71.8 per
cent of poor families had one or more cars in
1994, up from 64.5 percent in 1984.
Second, to call someone rich or poor, you
have to know that person's wealth, not his in
come. A retiree who receives only $12,000
annually in Social Security benefits and who
owns a $300,000 house with no mortgage
would still be counted in the lowest fifth. It's
true that income and wealth are positively
correlated, but the correlation is far from per
fect.
Our Incredible Income Mobility
The third reason the line between those
getting richer and poorer becomes blurred is
the incredible income mobility that the United
States enjoys. Today, people in the lowest fifth
of the income bracket are likely to be in a
higher one in a few years. Imagine that you
could take a picture of everyone in the lowest
quintile; nine years later, you take another pic
ture of that quintile. How many people would
be in both? Surprisingly few.
A 1992 study done by the U.S. Treasury
confirmed this. After tracking before-tax in
come for 14,351 taxpayers between 1979 and
1988, the Treasury economists found that of
the taxpayers in the bottom quintile in 1979,
only 14.2 percent (or one in seven) were still
there in 1988. Meanwhile, 20.7 percent had
moved to the next higher fifth, 25 percent to
the middle fifth, 25.3 percent to the second
highest fifth, and 14.7 percent to the highest
fifth. Thus, a taxpayer in the lowest bracket
in 1979 was about as likely to be in the high
est fifth nine years later as to have stayed in
the lowest fifth.
Why is mobility so high? The most impor
tant factor is age. Heavily represented in the
bottom quintile are young people who have
just graduated from high school or college and
are living on their own. Their current earn
ings are low, but as they age and gain skills,

their earnings rise. Similarly, overrepresented
in the lowest quintile are retired people who
may be wealthier than the average family but
don't have high incomes. Other factors mat
ter, too. A worker who lost a job may have
had a low annual income one year, but then
he finds another job. Or a divorced mother
may be in the lowest quintile, but nine years
later she is remarried or working in a produc
tive job and has a much higher family income.
There is an underclass of people who are
born into poverty and live their whole lives
that way, but it's much smaller than you might
think. For most of the people classified by the
government as poor on the basis of their in
come, poverty is temporary. In the 10 years
from 1969 to 1978, for example, only 2.6 per
cent of the population was classified as poor
for eight years or more. During that same pe
riod, 24.4 percent were classified as poor for
at least one year. Of the poverty spells experi
enced by the nonelderly, 43 percent occurred
when the marriage ended in divorce, a child
was born, or someone in the family set up an
independent household.
More than 15 state governments have be
gun ending certain cash benefits for families,
and welfare experts such as Thomas Fraker,
an economist with Mathematica Policy Re
search in Washington, D.C., are realizing that
removing people from the welfare rolls hasn't
left them living in the streets. In lowa, for
example, welfare rolls have declined by 30
percent in the past three years because the gov
ernment is ending cash aid for about 180 fami
lies a month. In a study that tracked 137 of
those families, Mr. Fraker found that about
half had incomes slightly higher than or equal
to their previous cash welfare benefits; the
other half had slightly lower incomes. Mr.
Fraker and other participants in the welfare
study industry were surprised. They shouldn't
be. Set up incentives so that welfare recipi
ents lose a work dollar when they earn a work
dollar, and many of them won't bother earn
ing any income (or won't bother to report it).
But tell them credibly that their welfare will
end soon or kick them off, and they'll come
up with ways of earning a living. The govern
ment could make it easier for them by ending
the minimum wage, which prices low-skilled
workers out of the market, and by ending other
government-imposed rules that prohibit them
from owning taxicabs, dressing hair, cutting
down trees, selling food out of kiosks and
doing other productive work. The whole fo
cus on income inequality is mistaken. Ameri
cans are doing as well as they are because a
million or so of us are making a lot of money
figuring out how to create new products and
new ways to increase our productivity.
Fortunately, even with these barriers in
place, former welfare recipients are making
it.
Be Like Mike
Some people think it's unfair that income
is distributed so unequally. But in a free soci
ety, income is not distributed. We get our in
come (gifts aside) the old-fashioned way: We
earn it. Society doesn't wake up one morning
and decide that Michael Jordan deserves $10
million for playing basketball and $30 mil
lion for advertising consumer products.
Instead, Michael Jordan wakes up every
morning, as he has for more than 15 years,
with a fierce determination to stay in tremen
dous physical shape, practice for hours a day
and be the incredibly competent athlete that
he is. Then millions of basketball fans and con
sumers decide, one by one, to spend a little
more time watching Michael on television or
a few dollars more for the products he adver
tises.
Whenever you hear that 20 percent of
households receive almost half of all income,
what is really meant is that that 20 percent

produces almost 50 percent of all output.
Of course, this is not a totally free society,
and the government uses its coercive powers
to take from people at every income level to
give to others at every income level. But even
in a free society, incomes would be highly un
equal.
Bigger Staffs, Bigger Incomes
People often assume that households in the
top fifth have the same number of people
working as households in the bottom fifth.
This assumption is grossly mistaken. For ev
ery 10 families in the bottom fifth of the in
come distribution in 1989, for example, eight
people were working.
By contrast, there were 23 workers for ev
ery 10 families in the top fifth. In other words,
one main reason that families are in the top
fifth is that they often have three times as many
workers per family as has the bottom fifth.
The poorest sector includes numerous single
mothers, many of them on welfare, while the
top fifth includes a disproportionately high

Show me an economy with equal incomes,
and I'll show you an economy that's in the
toilet. Many pundits and analysts sift through
the data to find inequalities in income, which
isn't hard, then try to figure out how to shave
off some. They usually suggest some new gov
ernment program or tax that is destructive of
human freedom and prosperity.
Instead they should recognize the many
ways that governments hold people down —
in the United States and elsewhere — and fig
ure out how to end those oppressive measures.
