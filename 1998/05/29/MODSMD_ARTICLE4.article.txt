Americans become
increasingly disconnected
from each other as focus
leans toward competition
and being well-off
John F. Manley
"w tt oung Americans
know a numbing truth
about America, The
New York Times reports: Living
the good life does not bring hap
piness. Americans are so discon
nected from other people that
The Times has dubbed discon
nection the spirit of the new age.
Formerly, alienation was said to typify
youth.The change is not an improvement.
The Times cites as evidence Alex Katz's
paintings and Steven Meisel's photographs
(for Calvin Klein). Katz and Meisel frame
beautiful people staring off into space, not
looking at each other. People commingle but
are unable to reach out to each other, says
Mark Freidburg, art director of "Ice Storm,"
a movie about the inability of "successful"
people to connect. (Amy M. Spindler, "Trac
ing the Look of Alienation," The New York
Times, March 24,1998, p. A25).
This story reminded me of a story that
trashed college freshmen and women for car
ing about using their education to expand their
wallets more than their minds. A survey of
348,465 students sponsored by the American
Council on Education found that students care
more about being well-off than developing a
philosophy of life, scoff at keeping up with

public affairs and rarely discuss politics.
Students go to college to learn a skill they
can convert into dollars, laments English Prof.
Mark W. Edmundson. The usual suspects were
trotted out: Too much television, economic
pressure, etc. (Ethan Bronner, "College Fresh
man Aiming for High Marks in Income," The
New York Times, January 12, 1998).
From day one, American students have
drilled into them that one goes to college to
get a better job. How does one get into a good
college? By beating out others who want to
go. One then gets a better job by doing better
in college than others. Often this requires beat
ing out others for admission into the most
prestigious graduate schools, then beating out
the "best of the best" for jobs with the most
prestigious corporations, and so on in infinite
regress until one reaches the pinnacle, dying
happily with the most of whatever there is to
get.
Throughout, students are told that in the real
world competition yields fewer winners than
losers, and this is good. From the earliest days
of schooling, students are tested and tracked.
Cooperation is called cheating. The lesson: We
are all in this separately, not together. What
better way to teach students to disconnect?
Given the dominant social values, I'm im
pressed by how much friendship exists among
students, not its absence. In a capitalist soci

ety, conspicuously unconcerned by social is
sues, why expect students to express deep
concern about those less fortunate than them
selves? Hardly anyone does.
There is one question in America that can
not be asked: What is capitalism's responsi
bility for the antisocial attitudes and social
emptiness decried by the media? Americans
can recite capitalism's virtues, especially as
compared with other societies, but is capital
ism accountable for only the good things in
life? If the system in which college students
are raised reproduces disconnected, asocial,
amoral citizens, perhaps the system is wrong,
not the students who are reared in it.
Such questions must not be asked because
they cut too close to capitalist society's brittle
bones. As long as the focus stays on such su
perficial factors as television, capitalism has
little to fear. Americans will continue to be
perplexed by the social disintegration around
them, withdraw from it, and never ask if "mar
ket society" is compatible with human life.
The idea that capitalism is the problem is too
heretical to let free, but until conditions
change, and heresy breaks out, Americans ap
parently have a life sentence in a system
whose best does not bring happiness.
