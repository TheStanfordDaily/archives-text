# Reflections on music
## The 						influence of rap on the challenging task of defining an art form 
### Jim Peros 
Ever since the late
19705, the art form
known as rap has
forced music listeners to come to
terms with their own definition
of music. The most popular defi
nition of music is along the lines
of "Music is the expression of
the human soul and the human
spirit." People who employ this
definition willingly accept rap as
music.
But of course this definition is unsatisfac
tory, because it is too broad. Pablo Picasso's
"Guernica" is most definitely an expression
of the human spirit, but one can safely say
that the monumental collage is not music.
Another way of dealing with the demanding
question consigned by rap is not to define
music at all. "Music is to me what it is to me"
might be a good way of summing up this po
sition. I respect people who choose not to de
fine music, but this type of perspectivism
makes me uneasy because of its neutralizing
effect. All music is not the same, at least not
on aesthetic grounds. To have the tools for
judgment, or at least for analysis, one needs a
working definition of music which considers
what is common to all music.
The most apparent and most necessary el
ement of music is a pulse. All music, from a
simple Gregorian chant to the epic sympho
nies of Mahler, has a pulse. The notion of pulse
is flexible. In many interpretations of Bach's
keyboard music, the pulse is clock-like; a per
fectly metered sequence of beats in time. More
often, as in the Greek folk melodies that I of
ten play, the pulse ebbs and flows. As the
music becomes excited, the pulse parallels the
emotion by becoming brisker, almost like a

heartbeat responding to an exciting situation.
Modern composers like Aaron Copland use a
deliberately asymmetric pulse to create a sense
of instability (try tapping your foot to
Copland's "El Salon Mexico." It is particu
larly difficult to follow the pulse in this piece).
Music must have a melodic line. From a
practical standpoint, this means that music
always has a series of pitches (different fre
quencies of sound waves) organized in time
into a melody. The main melodic theme from
a piece of music is what is usually the most
memorable, identifiable. The "tune" that you
might whistle after listening to a new piece of
music is part of a melody. Melodies have a
slightly different function than the pulse.
Composers might use the pulse to convey big
emotions like excitement or sadness. A
melody conveys one complete musical idea
to an audience, analogous to the function of
sentences in a piece of literature.
The one aspect of music that separates it
from noise is that it must have a development
from musical idea to musical idea, as well as
structure within each musical idea. Each piece
of the melody is organized into phrases. Com-

Unlike prose, poetry or the
visual arts, the definition of
music is somewhat more
rigid ...

posers group phrases together and ensure that
there is a logical development from one phrase
to the next. This formal organization sounds
very rigid, but what this leads to is an ordered,
coherent piece of art.
The fact that composers can use music to
tell a very definite story hints at the utility of
orderliness in music. For example, in his 1913
ballet "The Rite of Spring," Igor Stravinsky
uses music to describe the pagan Russian rite
of sacrificing a virgin in the spring to ensure
an adequate harvest. Pure, sweet music set by
a flute playing over the rest of winds embod
ies the virgin. The music is so vivid that you
can almost see the ballet's choreography. The

music surrounding the sacrifice of the virgin
is equally descriptive. Stravinsky paints the
grim picture of the rite with edgy, screaming
string chords so vibrant they sound like rip
ping leather.
The above criteria for music (the necessity
of a pulse, melodic lines and higher order
form) provide a basis for the definition of
music. Unlike prose, poetry or the visual arts,
the definition of music is somewhat more
rigid, and it is thus possible to assess the mer
its and faults of musical works against these
criteria and not between works.
Let us return again to the example of rap
and let's specifically examine the song entitled
"Luv 2 Luv Ya" by Timbaland and Magoo.
The song clearly has a pulse. Its pulse, like
the previously mentioned Bach keyboard
music is very rigid. Now what about melody?
This is a bit trickier. Rap's hallmark is
"pitchless singing" (i.e., use of the spoken
word in time).
I can grudgingly recognize the pitchless
singing as a melody. "Luv 2 Luv Ya" fails the
definition of music on the last point, however.
The rap is about six minutes long. Yet, only
two fragments of melodic material are pre
sented (1 am assuming one by Timbaland and
one by Magoo!). The rap doesn't develop.
There is no progression of one musical idea
to the next; the two rappers simply take turns
rapping. I don't see an attempt by the artists
to feed off of one another, to pick up where
the other left off, in order to constitute a de
velopment.
The power to bring objectivity to music
carries with it a danger. Audile art that isn't
neatly categorized music can be scorned as
"amusical." Thus, those who have an interest
in delegitimating art forms like rap might use
the definition of music to further their own
agendas. Even U.S. Congressmen categori
cally disdain rap as a misogynistic, corrupt
ing influence to remove responsibility for the
problems associated with inner cities off their
shoulders. One should always keep in mind
that the danger of any definition of art is
heavily political.
