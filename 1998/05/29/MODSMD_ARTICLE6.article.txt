he obligation to pray is one that lies
heavily in the heart of a Muslim. It was
this obligation that took graduate student
Marghoub Quraishi to the foreign student adviser
in 1958. A newcomer to Stanford, he needed to
know if there was a Muslim student group on cam
pus, where they prayed and how to get in touch
with other Muslim students.
"The adviser told me that Stanford did not allow facili
ties for religious purposes," Quraishi recalls. The names
of other Muslims on campus were finally given to him
and plans were made to pray together on Friday. Not
having a room for prayer, they could be seen praying on
the lawn of the old Bechtel International Center for the
first few weeks. After a couple of weeks, these four or
five graduate students approached the adviser once more.
It was after they presented their request to the registrar
that the process of creating the Islamic Society of

When the call is pro

Friday (the Day of
Assembly), hasten
earnestly to the Re

Stanford University (ISSU) began.
Established groups on campus at the time were
required to have a core leadership of a president,
vice president and treasurer. As such, the first lead
ers of the ISSU were chosen from the small group
of international graduate students.
After an ongoing process in the next two years,
the society became officially registered, receiving
facilities for prayer and funds for programming. In
keeping with Stanford's policies of not sponsoring
religious facilities, the ISSU was encouraged to form
as a cultural organization. The students, having suc
ceeded at their primary goal, did not push the point.
"We were just happy to have a place to pray," ex
plained Quraishi. "We didn't want to upset the apple
cart."
After a fire destroyed the international center in
November 1961, the students were once again with
out a place to pray. Over the next two decades, the
SIS met and prayed in various locations around the
area, the different members' residences, and a room
on College Avenue in Palo Alto.
Then called the Stanford Islamic Society (SIS),

the group of 12 students held con
gregational prayers on Friday,
Koranic study on Friday evenings
and occasional guest lectures on
Tuesday evenings. While there
were more Muslims in the area,
most of the membership was
made up of married graduate stu
dents living at Stanford Village in
Menlo Park and were harder to get
in touch with. The number of
Muslim students on and off cam
pus grew over the next few years,
and with that the SIS grew more
organized. The heightened con
flicts between the Arabs and Is
raelis in the early 1960s was the
impetus for more students to be
come active within the organiza
tion. The Muslim community in
the United States was growing at
the same time. In 1963, interna
tional students at the University
of Illinois founded the Muslim
Students Association, then the
first continental organization of
Muslims in North America.
Activities and attendance
within the SIS increased as the
needs of the students grew and
changed. When more Muslim stu
dents moved into the area with
their families, it was determined
to create some form of Islamic
studies for the growing group of

children. According to Quraishi's wife Iffat, the effort
began with the creation of a Muslim youth camp coun
seled by SIS members. In 1969-70 the wives of many of
the graduate students began a summer school for about
25-30 children from Stanford and UC-Berkeley that lasted
about three years.
Slowly the SIS increased its visibility on campus, bring
ing books about Islam to the libraries and hosting cultural
"Muslim Evenings" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Their pro
ductions included a Muslim wedding and an enactment
of the celebration of Eid, a Muslim holiday. With food
booths at multicultural events and receptions at the inter
national center, the SIS strove to maintain a level of vis-

ibility on campus. Given the na
ture of student-run organizations,
however, the constant flux of
membership must have made this
task difficult. The fact that the
society had yet to receive any sort
of office or community space cer
tainly contributed to this fact.
The early 1980s brought yet
another new group of student
leaders. When Hussein Al-
Hussein arrived at Stanford in
1979, it seemed to him that the
Society, "was on and off all the
time." After the two years of work
to establish the SIS with the Uni
versity Registrar, it was found that
for some reason, the group was
no longer registered. Every year
the students were required to sub
mit a renewal. And, having a
room off campus, the society was

"in complete isolation from everyone else,"
Al-Hussein remembers. He and several other
old and new members approached the admin
istration in 1981 for a room in the Old Union
Clubhouse, in which other religious organi
zations had their offices. The next year they
were given Room 19, which at that point they
shared with another organization. By 1983,
Room 19 was officially the Stanford Islamic
society's room to use as a library and prayer
area.
With an on-campus office, the society was
able to be more active and visible to Stanford
students. In the early 1980s students volun
teered with the international center to host new
Muslim students. Al-Hussein joined the
ASSU Speakers Bureau in 1983, and Muslim

students began to work with RAs and dorm staff to hold
dorm presentations on Islam. The society hosted the Is
lamic Society of North America's West Zone Conference
in Memorial Auditorium and invited Muslim scholars to
give lectures in Kresge and Dinkelspiel auditoriums.
In the late 1980s, the members of the SIS were finally
able to sponsor a Muslim professor from Canada to teach
a course on Islam. After assuring the administration that
Jamal Badawi was not coming to "preach" Islam but

merely to teach it, the society and the World Muslim
League of Jeddah paid all the expenses of Badawi and his
family and brought him to teach "Islamic History: Part
One" through the History Department.
Quraishi, with children of his own, requested that Al-
Hussein and Salah Feteih establish some sort of Sunday
school in 1984. With the Quraishi children making up
half the attendees, the Islamic Sunday School of Stanford
began. Most of the members of the society participated

in some form or another, and the
school grew to more than 10
times that number in two years.
For the next 13 years, the Sun
day school was held on campus
for three hours every weekend.
In 1987, Stanford required that
all groups not University-spon
sored change the names of the or
ganizations out of the Stanford
possessive. Thus, then-president
Hussein Al-Hussein named the
SIS the Islamic Society of
Stanford University. "I changed
it to ISSU to pronounce 'issue,'
since we cared more for the is
sues than the looks," he ex
plained.
By the late 1980s and early
19905, the second generation
Muslims in the United States
were going off to college. The
increasing numbers of Muslim
undergraduates in the ISSU has
had a tremendous influence in

terms of activism, policy and visibility at Stanford and in
the surrounding community.
"[The new group] has earnestly taken the spirit ... be
hind the notion of looking beyond ourselves ... We have
seen not only an increase in our membership, but also an
increase in native-born undergraduates ... who have been
brought up in an environment where most people are not
Muslim and who are therefore more conversant with the
system," said Salim Yusufali, senior.
While the ISSU of the 1990s continues in its funda
mental mission to serve the spiritual needs of the com
munity, the focus seems to be shifting towards activism.
