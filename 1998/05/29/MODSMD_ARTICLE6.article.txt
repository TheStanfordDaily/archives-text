he obligation to pray is one that lies
heavily in the heart of a Muslim. It was
this obligation that took graduate student
Marghoub Quraishi to the foreign student adviser
in 1958. A newcomer to Stanford, he needed to
know if there was a Muslim student group on cam
pus, where they prayed and how to get in touch
with other Muslim students.
"The adviser told me that Stanford did not allow facili
ties for religious purposes," Quraishi recalls. The names
of other Muslims on campus were finally given to him
and plans were made to pray together on Friday. Not
having a room for prayer, they could be seen praying on
the lawn of the old Bechtel International Center for the
first few weeks. After a couple of weeks, these four or
five graduate students approached the adviser once more.
It was after they presented their request to the registrar
that the process of creating the Islamic Society of

Stanford University (ISSU) began.
Established groups on campus at the time were
required to have a core leadership of a president,
vice president and treasurer. As such, the first lead
ers of the ISSU were chosen from the small group
of international graduate students.
After an ongoing process in the next two years,
the society became officially registered, receiving
facilities for prayer and funds for programming. In
keeping with Stanford's policies of not sponsoring
religious facilities, the ISSU was encouraged to form
as a cultural organization. The students, having suc
ceeded at their primary goal, did not push the point.
"We were just happy to have a place to pray," ex
plained Quraishi. "We didn't want to upset the apple
cart."
After a fire destroyed the international center in
November 1961, the students were once again with
out a place to pray. Over the next two decades, the
SIS met and prayed in various locations around the
area, the different members' residences, and a room
on College Avenue in Palo Alto.
Then called the Stanford Islamic Society (SIS),

the group of 12 students held con
gregational prayers on Friday,
Koranic study on Friday evenings
and occasional guest lectures on
Tuesday evenings. While there
were more Muslims in the area,
most of the membership was
made up of married graduate stu
dents living at Stanford Village in
Menlo Park and were harder to get
in touch with. The number of
Muslim students on and off cam
pus grew over the next few years,
and with that the SIS grew more
organized. The heightened con
flicts between the Arabs and Is
raelis in the early 1960s was the
impetus for more students to be
come active within the organiza
tion. The Muslim community in
the United States was growing at
the same time. In 1963, interna
tional students at the University
of Illinois founded the Muslim
Students Association, then the
first continental organization of
Muslims in North America.
Activities and attendance
within the SIS increased as the
needs of the students grew and
changed. When more Muslim stu
dents moved into the area with
their families, it was determined
to create some form of Islamic
studies for the growing group of

children. According to Quraishi's wife Iffat, the effort
began with the creation of a Muslim youth camp coun
seled by SIS members. In 1969-70 the wives of many of
the graduate students began a summer school for about
25-30 children from Stanford and UC-Berkeley that lasted
about three years.
Slowly the SIS increased its visibility on campus, bring
ing books about Islam to the libraries and hosting cultural
"Muslim Evenings" in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Their pro
ductions included a Muslim wedding and an enactment
of the celebration of Eid, a Muslim holiday. With food
booths at multicultural events and receptions at the inter
national center, the SIS strove to maintain a level of vis-

ibility on campus. Given the na
ture of student-run organizations,
however, the constant flux of
membership must have made this
task difficult. The fact that the
society had yet to receive any sort
of office or community space cer
tainly contributed to this fact.
The early 1980s brought yet
another new group of student
leaders. When Hussein Al-
Hussein arrived at Stanford in
1979, it seemed to him that the
Society, "was on and off all the
time." After the two years of work
to establish the SIS with the Uni
versity Registrar, it was found that
for some reason, the group was
no longer registered. Every year
the students were required to sub
mit a renewal. And, having a
room off campus, the society was

"in complete isolation from everyone else,"
Al-Hussein remembers. He and several other
old and new members approached the admin
istration in 1981 for a room in the Old Union
Clubhouse, in which other religious organi
zations had their offices. The next year they
were given Room 19, which at that point they
shared with another organization. By 1983,
Room 19 was officially the Stanford Islamic
society's room to use as a library and prayer
area.
With an on-campus office, the society was
able to be more active and visible to Stanford
students. In the early 1980s students volun
teered with the international center to host new
Muslim students. Al-Hussein joined the
ASSU Speakers Bureau in 1983, and Muslim

students began to work with RAs and dorm staff to hold
dorm presentations on Islam. The society hosted the Is
lamic Society of North America's West Zone Conference
in Memorial Auditorium and invited Muslim scholars to
give lectures in Kresge and Dinkelspiel auditoriums.
In the late 1980s, the members of the SIS were finally
able to sponsor a Muslim professor from Canada to teach
a course on Islam. After assuring the administration that
Jamal Badawi was not coming to "preach" Islam but

merely to teach it, the society and the World Muslim
League of Jeddah paid all the expenses of Badawi and his
family and brought him to teach "Islamic History: Part
One" through the History Department.
Quraishi, with children of his own, requested that Al-
Hussein and Salah Feteih establish some sort of Sunday
school in 1984. With the Quraishi children making up
half the attendees, the Islamic Sunday School of Stanford
began. Most of the members of the society participated

in some form or another, and the
school grew to more than 10
times that number in two years.
For the next 13 years, the Sun
day school was held on campus
for three hours every weekend.
In 1987, Stanford required that
all groups not University-spon
sored change the names of the or
ganizations out of the Stanford
possessive. Thus, then-president
Hussein Al-Hussein named the
SIS the Islamic Society of
Stanford University. "I changed
it to ISSU to pronounce 'issue,'
since we cared more for the is
sues than the looks," he ex
plained.
By the late 1980s and early
19905, the second generation
Muslims in the United States
were going off to college. The
increasing numbers of Muslim
undergraduates in the ISSU has
had a tremendous influence in

terms of activism, policy and visibility at Stanford and in
the surrounding community.
"[The new group] has earnestly taken the spirit ... be
hind the notion of looking beyond ourselves ... We have
seen not only an increase in our membership, but also an
increase in native-born undergraduates ... who have been
brought up in an environment where most people are not
Muslim and who are therefore more conversant with the
system," said Salim Yusufali, senior.
While the ISSU of the 1990s continues in its funda
mental mission to serve the spiritual needs of the com
munity, the focus seems to be shifting towards activism.

Friday congregational prayers are held in Bechtel International Cen
ter, daily prayers are held in Room 19, a regular study group meets on
Friday evenings and students meet together every night during
Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting. Beyond their own society,
however, they are also involved in prison outreach, community ser
vice and activities to raise awareness. In 1997, the Muslims on cam
pus held the first Islam Awareness Week at Stanford. An activity sup-

ported by the Muslim Students
Association, the week featured
speakers, a calligraphy workshop,
displays and a banquet at the end
of the week. The event was so
popular that it was again held in
April 1998. While excellent for
making Muslims more visible on
campus, planning and putting to-

gether such events also builds mutual respect and friendship among
its members.
Dean of Religious Studies Robert Gregg worked with the ISSU
and it was mostly by his efforts that Ebrahim Moosa from the Univer
sity of Cape Town was able to teach two Islamic studies courses in
the fall of 1997. The need for a regularly offered Islamic studies course
remains an important goal for the society, providing all Stanford stu
dents with the opportunity to learn more about Islam and helping them
enrich their own religious education.
"As time goes by, names change, faces change, ethnic composition
of the society changes, activities evolve, but the society remains as an
active training institution. In it, we (the Muslim students) get a grasp/
taste of the heat and pressure associated with collective workings
among Muslims and interfacing with non-Muslims. As we all know,
the most precious stone, the diamond, is the result of a lot of heat and
pressure, and we will keep looking for those precious stones that gradu
ate every year out of the ISSU," said Salah Feteih, 1986-87 president.
In the 40 years since the beginning of the ISSU, the society as an
organization has seen changing groups of leaders, an increased aware
ness of Islam and greater visibility of Muslims in this country. The
issues that arise from these changes had a great deal of influence in
the direction the society took as it grew. As the first generation Ameri
can Muslims began to attend college, the perception of Islam in a
local setting began to change. Media misrepresentation of Muslims
required a shift in focus towards the issue of fighting that image.
It was time for Muslims to be citizens of their communities. It is
the nature of such an organization that it not be identified with any
one certain leader. All of the members are in some form leaders.
"When it comes to activities and ISSU planning, everybody par
ticipates in decision making as well as execution of plans, and that is
very important to give an ownership feeling to the society members,"
said Osama Shana'a, a graduate student in electrical engineering.
"It is really interesting," observed Marghoub Quraishi, "where the

It is the nature of (the Islamic Society of
Stanford University) that it not be identi
fied with any one certain leader. All of

Stanford students have gone outside the campus and helped. They've
been involved with the youth camp for 36 years now, and they are
really a resource for their community . . . The community has ben
efited from their presence."
It could be argued that the first two decades of the society were
affected by politics in the Middle East. With the majority of the group
being international students, events "back home" played a larger role
for them than for students born and raised in this country. For Ameri-

can Muslim students, while there
was still an effort to remain in
contact with fellow Muslims out
side the United States, the senti
ment was different.
Iffat Quraishi said, "We'd be at
Friday prayers and they would
talk about, 'when we go back
home,' and I would think, 'this is

my home."'
"Of course at the time most of the people who came were on student
visas and had no intention of staying," explained Iffat Quraishi. "It was
repressive in the sense that anybody who was an activist Muslim was not
safe, would end up in jail. When we came over here, there was the free
dom to openly practice, but to be able to be rather active was something
that was a central collective point... at the same time they knew that if
they went back they would end up in jail."
All of these students coming from different backgrounds into yet
another environment could have isolated themselves from each other.
Recognizing the similarity of their situations, they formed a commu
nity. The ties to their sisters and brothers remained after graduation.
"Graduates of the ISSU have maintained a fairly good relationship
with others even if they have left the country," Iffat Quraishi said.
"(The society) has at least offered a network of friendship and affili
ation It has also provided a good opportunity for the university as
a whole to be involved ... it has brought the institution closer to
universities all over the world. For example, (former member)
Abdullah Nasif became president of a university in Saudi Arabia ...
brought closeness and encouraged more students from those areas to
come from a university and professional level."
Community activism is an area in which the society will build for
the future. Having established themselves as a visible organization at
Stanford, the ISSU recognizes its responsibility to remain vocal on
campus, local and even national and international issues.
"The ISSU is a Muslim organization functioning within an Ameri
can university ... and thus what primarily motivates it are those hap
penings in its immediate, local and national community," Yusufali
said. "As Muslims we identify with the principle of justice. Wherever
injustice exists, whether it be against Muslims or against non-Mus
lims, we stand against it."
