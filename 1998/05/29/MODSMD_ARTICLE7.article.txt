# Revisiting Sisyphus, Camus and Absurdity
## The
						Absurdity inherent in Camus' Sisyphus continues to haunt us, make us uneasy 
### Tanvir Rahman 
Sisyphus is still alive.
And as long as he keeps
rolling an enormous
boulder to the top of mountain
ad nauseum, we cannot rest
easy. We are confronted with
what Albert Camus noted as the
Absurd, and it makes us uncom
fortable.
That discomfort of course leads us to be
dismissive, but the image remains, for myths
do not die. They are revived — they are made
"for the imagination to breathe life into them."
Now don't pretend you haven't met the
Absurd. As students, we are faced with it con
stantly. Writing a computer program about an
imaginary lemonade stand, or integrating a
monstrous mathematical function must have
at one time struck us as utterly ridiculous. Or
point to any of our desires, affectations or
goals, and after careful consideration the
thought of its constructedness and perhaps
even its hollowness makes us uneasy. It is the
"dread of nothingness." A conscientious
thought about virtually anything attests to the
pervasiveness of the Absurd. Some people can
attain status and wealth by forcefully jamming
a ball through a 10-foot high cylinder. That is
absurd, and innumerable instances in its like
ness are inescapable, übiquitous.
It is precisely at that time — when we are
rendered paralyzed by the thought of the Ab
surd, when we cannot dismiss it — that we
must revisit Sisyphus. That is exactly what
Camus did in 1943 with "Le Mythe de
Sisyphe." He was haunted, or informed, by
the mythico-image all his life, throughout his
creativity. About Sisyphus, Camus writes, "a

man's work is nothing
but this slow trek to redis
cover through the detours of art,
those two or three great and simple im
ages in whose presence his art first
opened." Camus believed that Sisyphus was
an emblem of the modern man's predicament

The multiple mythical associations with
Sisyphus allows us to escape that tragic im
age for a brief moment to a time when
Sisyphus was free. But it was in this freedom
that Sisyphus created his barren fate. Natu
rally we wonder what he did (and what we
have done) to be crushed by the burden of the
Absurd. By some accounts, Sisyphus was a
rogue, a rapist, a pirate. But nothing is ex-

traordinary enough in these claims to warrant
his pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity. It
is Homer's account that informs us he was
"the craftiest of mortals"; it was this crafti
ness that got him into trouble.
Sisyphus's target for foolery was Death. He
first outwits Death and ties him to the sun, so
no one can die for awhile. Death eventually
finds a way out, but is tricked once again.
Sisyphus was ingenious enough to ask his wife
not to perform the proper libations on his
corpse on Earth, and so when he is in Hades,
he persuades Persephone for a brief return to
life so he can perform his due rites. Once
remortalized, Sisyphus scorns death and the
gods by continuing to live his previous life
and forgoing his return to Hades. Sisyphus is
the mythical rebel. As usual, the gods win
when Mercury drags him back to the under
world and consigns him to his eternal fate on
the mountain.
