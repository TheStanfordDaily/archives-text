# Revisiting Sisyphus, Camus and Absurdity
## The 						Absurdity inherent in Camus' Sisyphus continues to haunt us, make us uneasy 
### Tanvir Rahman 
Sisyphus is still alive.
And as long as he keeps
rolling an enormous
boulder to the top of mountain
ad nauseum, we cannot rest
easy. We are confronted with
what Albert Camus noted as the
Absurd, and it makes us uncom
fortable.
That discomfort of course leads us to be
dismissive, but the image remains, for myths
do not die. They are revived — they are made
"for the imagination to breathe life into them."
Now don't pretend you haven't met the
Absurd. As students, we are faced with it con
stantly. Writing a computer program about an
imaginary lemonade stand, or integrating a
monstrous mathematical function must have
at one time struck us as utterly ridiculous. Or
point to any of our desires, affectations or
goals, and after careful consideration the
thought of its constructedness and perhaps
even its hollowness makes us uneasy. It is the
"dread of nothingness." A conscientious
thought about virtually anything attests to the
pervasiveness of the Absurd. Some people can
attain status and wealth by forcefully jamming
a ball through a 10-foot high cylinder. That is
absurd, and innumerable instances in its like
ness are inescapable, übiquitous.
It is precisely at that time — when we are
rendered paralyzed by the thought of the Ab
surd, when we cannot dismiss it — that we
must revisit Sisyphus. That is exactly what
Camus did in 1943 with "Le Mythe de
Sisyphe." He was haunted, or informed, by
the mythico-image all his life, throughout his
creativity. About Sisyphus, Camus writes, "a

man's work is nothing
but this slow trek to redis
cover through the detours of art,
those two or three great and simple im
ages in whose presence his art first
opened." Camus believed that Sisyphus was
an emblem of the modern man's predicament

that Sisyphus created his barren fate. Natu

have done) to be crushed by the burden of the

traordinary enough in these claims to warrant
his pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity. It
is Homer's account that informs us he was
"the craftiest of mortals"; it was this crafti
ness that got him into trouble.
Sisyphus's target for foolery was Death. He
first outwits Death and ties him to the sun, so
no one can die for awhile. Death eventually
finds a way out, but is tricked once again.
Sisyphus was ingenious enough to ask his wife
not to perform the proper libations on his
corpse on Earth, and so when he is in Hades,
he persuades Persephone for a brief return to
life so he can perform his due rites. Once
remortalized, Sisyphus scorns death and the
gods by continuing to live his previous life
and forgoing his return to Hades. Sisyphus is
the mythical rebel. As usual, the gods win
when Mercury drags him back to the under
world and consigns him to his eternal fate on
the mountain.
We are most concerned with Sisyphus at

this point in the myth — the stop
ping point, the point that intersects
with the present moment
(Sisyphus continues to roll the
rock to this very moment). We are
crippled by the myth because of
its futility and hopelessness, be
cause we can read our own fates
in the same way. Camus, however,
manages to awaken hope even

(Camus) comforts
himself by imagin
ing Sisyphus as a
master of his fate.

Sisyphus as a hero,
a rebel. But
Sisyphus is no
longer a rebel. He
is in shackles.

amid the heavy cloak of hopeless
ness. His "absurd hero" who
scorns the gods, hates death and
is passionate about life not only
copes but thrives in his fate. At
least according to Camus. He is
most interested in the moment
when Sisyphus must go back
down and retrieve the rock.
"I see that man going back
down with a heavy and yet mea
sured step toward the torment of
which he will never know the
end," Camus writes. "That hour
like a breathing-space which re
turns as surely as his suffering,
that is the hour of his conscious

ness. At each of the moments
when he leaves the heights and
gradually sinks toward the lairs of
the gods, he is superior to his fate,
He is stronger than his rock."
According to Camus, Sisyphus
is able to endure in this situation
out of rebellion. He mulishly ac
cepts his fate, and like Oedipus,
he is able to conclude that all is
well. As Camus writes, "There is
no fate that cannot be surmounted
by scorn ... crushing truths per
ish from being acknowledged."
Thus the descent that should take
place in sorrow "can also take
place in joy." In this way, Sisyphus
can master his fate and can face
the absurd.
"Sisyphus teaches the higher fi
delity that negates the gods and
raises the rocks ... This universe
henceforth without a master
seems to him neither sterile nor
futile ... The struggle itself toward
the heights is enough to fill a
man's heart. One must imagine
Sisyphus happy."
Imagine Sisyphus happy? At
this juncture we realize that
Camus's reading of the myth here
is faint-hearted. He comforts him
self by imagining Sisyphus as a
master of his fate. He imagines
Sisyphus as a hero, a rebel. But
Sisyphus is no longer a rebel. He
is in shackles. He does not under
mine his futility by acceptance;
rather, he affirms it. He creates his
meaning, and if he is as conscious
as Camus claims, he must be sus
picious of it as a construct that is
vulnerable to deconstruction. He
must be uneasy, and he must be
weary. Sisyphus, like Camus's
reading, is cowardly, and that is
why the myth is so haunting. He
had scorned the gods in the past,

but now only confirms their au
thority by his resignation.
Sisyphus is a dangerous coward
because he accepts an evil truth.
He does not reject the truth (which
by paradox is Absurdity itself) and
thus is a champion of evil knowl
edge. He accepts determinism, he
mocks choice. He is defiance de
ferred. Sisyphus (and Camus for
that matter) cannot trick himself
(like he did with Death) into be
lieving his fate is desirable, joy
ous, or that he is his own master.
That is the rationalizing lie.
For us to be liberated from
Absurdism, Sisyphus must truly
revolt. One imagines Sisyphus
pushing the rock with all his
might up the hill, straining and
struggling, only to revolt against

Sisyphus cannot
trick himself into
believing his fate is
desirable, joyous,
or that he is his
own master. This is
the rationalizing lie.

his fate by letting the enormous
rock roll over him, releasing the
pressure of Absurdity into the
"wild and limited universe of
man." Only in that way can
Sisyphus be the true Absurd hero
— an annihilation aimed against
nihilism, a selfless rebellion for
us against Absurdity.

Sisyphus is still alive.
And as long as he keeps
rolling an enormous
boulder to the top of mountain
ad nauseum, we cannot rest
easy. We are confronted with
what Albert Camus noted as the
Absurd, and it makes us uncom
fortable.
That discomfort of course leads us to be
dismissive, but the image remains, for myths
do not die. They are revived — they are made
"for the imagination to breathe life into them."
Now don't pretend you haven't met the
Absurd. As students, we are faced with it con
stantly. Writing a computer program about an
imaginary lemonade stand, or integrating a
monstrous mathematical function must have
at one time struck us as utterly ridiculous. Or
point to any of our desires, affectations or
goals, and after careful consideration the
thought of its constructedness and perhaps
even its hollowness makes us uneasy. It is the
"dread of nothingness." A conscientious
thought about virtually anything attests to the
pervasiveness of the Absurd. Some people can
attain status and wealth by forcefully jamming
a ball through a 10-foot high cylinder. That is
absurd, and innumerable instances in its like
ness are inescapable, übiquitous.
It is precisely at that time — when we are
rendered paralyzed by the thought of the Ab
surd, when we cannot dismiss it — that we
must revisit Sisyphus. That is exactly what
Camus did in 1943 with "Le Mythe de
Sisyphe." He was haunted, or informed, by
the mythico-image all his life, throughout his
creativity. About Sisyphus, Camus writes, "a

man's work is nothing
but this slow trek to redis
cover through the detours of art,
those two or three great and simple im
ages in whose presence his art first
opened." Camus believed that Sisyphus was

The multiple mythical associations with
Sisyphus allows us to escape that tragic im
age for a brief moment to a time when
Sisyphus was free. But it was in this freedom
that Sisyphus created his barren fate. Natu
rally we wonder what he did (and what we
have done) to be crushed by the burden of the
Absurd. By some accounts, Sisyphus was a
rogue, a rapist, a pirate. But nothing is ex-

traordinary enough in these claims to warrant
his pushing a boulder up a hill for eternity. It
is Homer's account that informs us he was
"the craftiest of mortals"; it was this crafti
ness that got him into trouble.
Sisyphus's target for foolery was Death. He
first outwits Death and ties him to the sun, so
no one can die for awhile. Death eventually
finds a way out, but is tricked once again.
Sisyphus was ingenious enough to ask his wife
not to perform the proper libations on his
corpse on Earth, and so when he is in Hades,
he persuades Persephone for a brief return to
life so he can perform his due rites. Once
remortalized, Sisyphus scorns death and the
gods by continuing to live his previous life
and forgoing his return to Hades. Sisyphus is
the mythical rebel. As usual, the gods win
when Mercury drags him back to the under
world and consigns him to his eternal fate on
the mountain.
We are most concerned with Sisyphus at

this point in the myth — the stop
ping point, the point that intersects
with the present moment
(Sisyphus continues to roll the
rock to this very moment). We are
crippled by the myth because of
its futility and hopelessness, be
cause we can read our own fates
in the same way. Camus, however,
manages to awaken hope even

(Camus) comforts
himself by imagin
ing Sisyphus as a
master of his fate.
He imagines
Sisyphus as a hero,
a rebel. But
Sisyphus is no
longer a rebel. He
is in shackles.

amid the heavy cloak of hopeless
ness. His "absurd hero" who
scorns the gods, hates death and
is passionate about life not only
copes but thrives in his fate. At
least according to Camus. He is
most interested in the moment
when Sisyphus must go back
down and retrieve the rock.
"I see that man going back
down with a heavy and yet mea
sured step toward the torment of
which he will never know the
end," Camus writes. "That hour
like a breathing-space which re
turns as surely as his suffering,
that is the hour of his conscious

ness. At each of the moments
when he leaves the heights and
gradually sinks toward the lairs of
the gods, he is superior to his fate,
He is stronger than his rock."
According to Camus, Sisyphus
is able to endure in this situation
out of rebellion. He mulishly ac
cepts his fate, and like Oedipus,
he is able to conclude that all is
well. As Camus writes, "There is
no fate that cannot be surmounted
by scorn ... crushing truths per
ish from being acknowledged."
Thus the descent that should take
place in sorrow "can also take
place in joy." In this way, Sisyphus
can master his fate and can face
the absurd.
"Sisyphus teaches the higher fi
delity that negates the gods and
raises the rocks ... This universe
henceforth without a master
seems to him neither sterile nor
futile ... The struggle itself toward
the heights is enough to fill a
man's heart. One must imagine
Sisyphus happy."
Imagine Sisyphus happy? At
this juncture we realize that
Camus's reading of the myth here
is faint-hearted. He comforts him
self by imagining Sisyphus as a
master of his fate. He imagines
Sisyphus as a hero, a rebel. But
Sisyphus is no longer a rebel. He
is in shackles. He does not under
mine his futility by acceptance;
rather, he affirms it. He creates his
meaning, and if he is as conscious
as Camus claims, he must be sus
picious of it as a construct that is
vulnerable to deconstruction. He
must be uneasy, and he must be
weary. Sisyphus, like Camus's
reading, is cowardly, and that is
why the myth is so haunting. He
had scorned the gods in the past,

but now only confirms their au
thority by his resignation.
Sisyphus is a dangerous coward
because he accepts an evil truth.
He does not reject the truth (which
by paradox is Absurdity itself) and
thus is a champion of evil knowl
edge. He accepts determinism, he
mocks choice. He is defiance de
ferred. Sisyphus (and Camus for
that matter) cannot trick himself
(like he did with Death) into be
lieving his fate is desirable, joy
ous, or that he is his own master.
That is the rationalizing lie.
