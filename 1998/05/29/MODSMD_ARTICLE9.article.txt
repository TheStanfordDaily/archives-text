## Paradise hits on crucial themes 
### Ann Le 
Toni Morrison's first novel
since winning the Nobel Prize
in 1993, Paradise offers fans
what has become expected of
her work from years past

Once again, Toni Morrison
| delivers another novel that
is highly convoluted, eerily
hypnotizing and deeply felt. Paradise,
Morrison's first novel since receiving the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, upholds the
enormous reputation of the Nobel Laureate as
a racially, socially, historically and spiritually
perceptive writer. But in relation to craft,
Paradise gives off the effect of being too
conciously crafted.
Morrison had started planning Paradise right after her sixth
novel, Jazz. But before her ideas could be fully formed, the
Nobel Prize and its disruptive concomitants intervened. It took
six more years for the completion and publication of the book
which immediately made the best seller's list, thanks, no
doubt, to Morrison's acclaim through acknowledgment from
the Swedish Academy, the Pulitzer Prize, Oprah Winfrey's
Book Club and the immediate widespread reviews of Para
dise.
Paradise shares themes and subjects that have long been

In Paradise, Morrison continues to address
themes and subjects that appeared in
previous works. ... For ardent readers of
Morrison, these resurfacing themes and
subjects are far from repetitive.

Paradise, by Toni Morrison

First published last year,
Paradise is Toni
Morrison's first work
since the publication of
The Dancing Mind in
1996. It is her seventh
published novel and the
first since the publication
of Jazz in 1992.

churning in its creator's mind. Morrison had started planning
her new book around the significance of a phrase she
stumbled across while reading about the historical period
shortly after the Civil War. "Come Prepared or Not at All,"
was the riveting phrase Morrison encountered in newspaper
ads of the 1870s. Those ads were targeted at the ex-slaves,
calling them Westward to new lives in the expansive country,
yet simultaneously taunting at some groups' perceived inad
equacies.
This historical background is the backdrop to Paradise.
The story takes place around Ruby, Okla., a black town
founded by nine families who had been denied residence at
another black town. The town remains isolated until the late
19605, when social movements on the outside world seep into
the town, making the youth rebellious and aggressive as they
join the black power movement, and disrupting the already
strained harmony of the town. There are also rumors of crib
deaths, abortions and debauchery — all traceable to the old
convent where five displaced women reside. The plot unfolds
through the bouncing back and forth between bits of history
throughout the course of a century. The final effect is the
display of a complicated history of a black town establish
ment whose men eventually raid the convent at the dawn of a
day in July 1976.
In Paradise, Morrison continues to address themes and
subjects that appeared in previous works. She elaborates on
the idea of blacks' prejudice against each other on the account
of the darkness or lightness of their skin (Tar Baby); baby
deaths that haunt their mothers {Beloved), men driven to
violence in their delusion (Jazz)-, and many others. For ardent
readers of Morrison, these resurfacing themes and subjects are

far from repetitive. On the
contrary, they are a satisfying
reward and contribute to the
greater level of richness in the
reading.
For the first time, Morrison
also rather overtly explores
religion. In addition to the
obvious implications of desig
nating an old convent house —
complete with the sacramental
vessels of Catholic worship —
as the central location of the

story, Paradise also uncovers
the discord between different
sects of Christian Protestant
religion and the politics of
organized religion. It even
includes the contrasting devilry
of unorganized witchcraft.
Paradise comes close to being
overly saturated with religious
imagery and allusions.
Another idea that Morrison
experiments with in Paradise is
racial obscurity. Even though
the novel opens up starkly with
"They shoot the white girl first,"
the connection of this girl to her
character description later in the
novel is not made. The reader is
left unenlightened to the colors

of the five adrift women who
are all drawn under their tragic
conditions to the convent near
Ruby, Okla. This is a rather bold
device and can be distracting,
given the knowledge that
Morrison is a black writer who
has written preeminently about
racial issues in the past. The
reader is thus inclined to expect
black issues in Paradise (their
expectations prove to be legiti
mate), and the fluency of the
plot is interrupted as readers
raise questions of the color of
the characters, which they
naturally deem important to
understanding the novel.
Morrison's point is that the
color of certain characters is not
important to the events.
Yet, at the same time, there is
little denial that race is central to
the story. After all, the erection
of Ruby is the result of exclu
sion of blacks from settlement
in white localities; and to extend
that further, the exclusion of
darker-skinned blacks from
settling with light-skinned ones.
How Morrison is able to project
the unimportance of race and at
the same time have racial
prejudice be the foundation of
the town (and thus, the book)
without appearing fundamen
tally contradictory is quite
mind-boggling.
As characterisitic of her other
work, Paradise has magical
elements, a convoluted plot, rich
imagery and beautiful, sensual
prose. For example, here
Morrison describes the first
night that Mavis, one of the
displaced women, spends at the
convent:
"Connie showed Mavis to a
large bedroom. From the four
cots in it, she chose the one
closest to the window, where
she knelt looking out. Two
milky moons, instead of the one
hanging there, would have been
just like Connie's eyes. Beneath

them swept a world.
Unjudgemental. Tidy. Ample.
Forever... . The lion cub that ate
her up that night had blue eyes
instead of brown, and he did not
have to hold her down this time.
"When he circled her shoul
ders with his left paw, she
willingly let her head fall back,
clearing the way to her throat.
Nor did she fight herself out of
the dream. The bite was juicy,
but she slept through that as
well as other things until the
singing woke her."
The passage is beautifully
magical. The voice of the
narrator zooms quickly in, until
it is extremely close to the
character. There is little transi
tion from the narration of
Mavis' external action of pick
ing the cot by the window, to
her internal (but conscious)
comparison of the moon with
Connie's eyes, and then to the
unconscious dream that the
reader understands more than
Marvis does.
And then just as quickly as
we moved into Marvis'
unconcious mind, we are thrown

ment whose men eventually raid the convent at the dawn of a
day in July 1976.
In Paradise, Morrison continues to address themes and
subjects that appeared in previous works. She elaborates on
the idea of blacks' prejudice against each other on the account
of the darkness or lightness of their skin (Tar Baby); baby
deaths that haunt their mothers {Beloved), men driven to
violence in their delusion (Jazz)-, and many others. For ardent
readers of Morrison, these resurfacing themes and subjects are

far from repetitive. On the
contrary, they are a satisfying
reward and contribute to the
greater level of richness in the
reading.
For the first time, Morrison
also rather overtly explores
religion. In addition to the
obvious implications of desig
nating an old convent house —
complete with the sacramental
vessels of Catholic worship —
as the central location of the

story, Paradise also uncovers
the discord between different
sects of Christian Protestant
religion and the politics of
organized religion. It even
includes the contrasting devilry
of unorganized witchcraft.
Paradise comes close to being
overly saturated with religious
imagery and allusions.
Another idea that Morrison
experiments with in Paradise is
racial obscurity. Even though
the novel opens up starkly with
"They shoot the white girl first,"
the connection of this girl to her
character description later in the
novel is not made. The reader is
left unenlightened to the colors

of the five adrift women who
are all drawn under their tragic
conditions to the convent near
Ruby, Okla. This is a rather bold
device and can be distracting,
given the knowledge that
Morrison is a black writer who
has written preeminently about
racial issues in the past. The
reader is thus inclined to expect
black issues in Paradise (their
expectations prove to be legiti
mate), and the fluency of the
plot is interrupted as readers
raise questions of the color of
the characters, which they
naturally deem important to
understanding the novel.
Morrison's point is that the
color of certain characters is not
important to the events.
Yet, at the same time, there is
little denial that race is central to
the story. After all, the erection
of Ruby is the result of exclu
sion of blacks from settlement
in white localities; and to extend
that further, the exclusion of
darker-skinned blacks from
settling with light-skinned ones.
How Morrison is able to project
the unimportance of race and at
the same time have racial
prejudice be the foundation of
the town (and thus, the book)
without appearing fundamen
tally contradictory is quite
mind-boggling.
As characterisitic of her other
work, Paradise has magical
elements, a convoluted plot, rich
imagery and beautiful, sensual
prose. For example, here
Morrison describes the first
night that Mavis, one of the
displaced women, spends at the
convent:
"Connie showed Mavis to a
large bedroom. From the four
cots in it, she chose the one
closest to the window, where
she knelt looking out. Two
milky moons, instead of the one
hanging there, would have been
just like Connie's eyes. Beneath

them swept a world.
Unjudgemental. Tidy. Ample.
Forever... . The lion cub that ate
her up that night had blue eyes
instead of brown, and he did not
have to hold her down this time.
"When he circled her shoul
ders with his left paw, she
willingly let her head fall back,
clearing the way to her throat.
Nor did she fight herself out of
the dream. The bite was juicy,
but she slept through that as
well as other things until the
singing woke her."
The passage is beautifully
magical. The voice of the
narrator zooms quickly in, until
it is extremely close to the
character. There is little transi
tion from the narration of
Mavis' external action of pick
ing the cot by the window, to
her internal (but conscious)
comparison of the moon with
Connie's eyes, and then to the
unconscious dream that the
reader understands more than
Marvis does.
And then just as quickly as
we moved into Marvis'
unconcious mind, we are thrown
