### Ann Le 
Toni Morrison's first novel
since winning the Nobel Prize
in 1993, Paradise offers fans
what has become expected of
her work from years past

Once again, Toni Morrison
| delivers another novel that
is highly convoluted, eerily
hypnotizing and deeply felt. Paradise,
Morrison's first novel since receiving the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, upholds the
enormous reputation of the Nobel Laureate as
a racially, socially, historically and spiritually
perceptive writer. But in relation to craft,
Paradise gives off the effect of being too
conciously crafted.
Morrison had started planning Paradise right after her sixth
novel, Jazz. But before her ideas could be fully formed, the
Nobel Prize and its disruptive concomitants intervened. It took
six more years for the completion and publication of the book
which immediately made the best seller's list, thanks, no
doubt, to Morrison's acclaim through acknowledgment from
the Swedish Academy, the Pulitzer Prize, Oprah Winfrey's
Book Club and the immediate widespread reviews of Para
dise.
Paradise shares themes and subjects that have long been

In Paradise, Morrison continues to address
themes and subjects that appeared in
previous works. ... For ardent readers of
Morrison, these resurfacing themes and
subjects are far from repetitive.

Paradise, by Toni Morrison

First published last year,
Paradise is Toni
Morrison's first work
since the publication of
The Dancing Mind in
1996. It is her seventh
published novel and the
first since the publication
of Jazz in 1992.

churning in its creator's mind. Morrison had started planning
her new book around the significance of a phrase she
stumbled across while reading about the historical period
shortly after the Civil War. "Come Prepared or Not at All,"
was the riveting phrase Morrison encountered in newspaper
ads of the 1870s. Those ads were targeted at the ex-slaves,
calling them Westward to new lives in the expansive country,
yet simultaneously taunting at some groups' perceived inad
equacies.
This historical background is the backdrop to Paradise.
The story takes place around Ruby, Okla., a black town
founded by nine families who had been denied residence at
another black town. The town remains isolated until the late
19605, when social movements on the outside world seep into
the town, making the youth rebellious and aggressive as they
join the black power movement, and disrupting the already
strained harmony of the town. There are also rumors of crib
deaths, abortions and debauchery â€” all traceable to the old
convent where five displaced women reside. The plot unfolds
through the bouncing back and forth between bits of history
throughout the course of a century. The final effect is the
display of a complicated history of a black town establish
ment whose men eventually raid the convent at the dawn of a
day in July 1976.
In Paradise, Morrison continues to address themes and
subjects that appeared in previous works. She elaborates on
the idea of blacks' prejudice against each other on the account
of the darkness or lightness of their skin (Tar Baby); baby
deaths that haunt their mothers {Beloved), men driven to
violence in their delusion (Jazz)-, and many others. For ardent
readers of Morrison, these resurfacing themes and subjects are
