1997-1998 Public Service Scholars
Theses Presentations and Discussions
"Research as a Form of Public Service"
For Public Service Scholars, service is not about choosing community involvement instead of academic
work. Rather, the direction and effort of the Public Service Scholars Program is reflected in its thematic
focus, "Research as a Form of Public Service". This means that research and scholarship are applied
to serve specific community needs or the general public interest. This year's Public Service Scholars'
theses exemplify the incredible range of community concerns, application of research to explore
solutions, and the power of uniting community service with the development of knowledge.
