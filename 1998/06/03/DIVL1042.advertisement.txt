4 crude And insulting message on Luis Maciel's answer
ing to* chine,
I have taken this ad out in order to offer toy humblest
and sincerest apologies to you, Luis, because what I
said was corcpletely uncalled for and moreover, Just
plain wrong, I have lived and been close friends with
Latinos toy whole life, frcro toy father's family growing
up in Mexico to toy growing up in Texas through toy in
volvement with Latino political involvroent in high
school, and I want you to believe toe when I say that I
ato not racist and I did not mean what 3 said to be of
fensive or hurtful in any way,
3 hope that we can put this horrible episode behind us
and, perhaps, even become friends someday, although
that is probably asking too much, A.11 3 ask for now
is your forgiveness. Please forgive roe.
