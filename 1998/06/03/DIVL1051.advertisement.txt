VERY DAY I FIND COMFORT
IN KNOWING I DID WHAT SHE WANTED.'
"My daughter, Regina, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. She was 35
years old at the time. There was nothing the doctors could do. We had
discussed organ and tissue donation together as a family and Regina told
us she wanted to become a donor. I miss Regina very much, but every
day I find comfort in knowing I did what she wanted."
