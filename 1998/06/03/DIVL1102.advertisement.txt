While University housing policy prohibits keeping pets in or about
Campus residences, some students still have them
Despite good intentions,
some of those pets will be lost or abandoned on Campus
Cats are abandoned in desperation, when students cannot take them home,
traveling, or to a new apartment/career. They reproduce and, with their
offspring, may die of starvation and disease
Critters left behind in student housing may die of dehydration and starvation,
before they are found too late in the summer
If you or someone you know is in this predicament,
please find a way to keep your pet or find a good home for it
If you cannot work it out, or you find a lost/abandoned animal.
will work with you to find a humane solution.
