Students from throughout the
world are participating in a bold
education initiative offered by
Columbia University at
Biosphere 2 Center. From hands
on research, to team-taught
cross-disciplinary classes, to
challenging field exploration,
students develop skills and
knowledge designed to help
them solve real-world problems.
All majors are welcome. Find out
more: call 1-800-992-4603
(option 1) or e-mail us at
admissions@bio2.edu.
QUALIFIED STANFORD STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED TO
NOT PAY MORE AT BIOSPHERE 2 THAN YOU PAY NOW

"Earth Semester is like taking a semester
abroad without ever leaving the country. You
immerse yourself in three unique
environments — social, geographic and
intellectual — and come out with a different
view of what environmental studies are all
about."
Michael Beman
Earth Semester '98
Sophomore
Geology and Geophysics
Yale University
"Understanding the complex rules of life
requires great vision. The potential at
Biosphere 2 for teaching and learning about
these phenomena is enormous. Earth
Semester students are learning — from a
team of physical, biological and social
scientists — how the Earth and environment
function. This approach is greatly needed in
undergraduate education."
Peter Raven, Ph.D.
Director
Missouri Botanical Garden
"In most academic settings, students are fed
pages of processed data. This approach
contrasts greatly with that utilized by the
Biosphere 2 educational programs, in which
students become a part of a process for
understanding how earth systems function.
Industry needs a workforce that has this
larger understanding."
Phillip Dougherty, Ph.D.
Forest Ecophysiologist
Westvaco
"At Biosphere 2, our students get an
extraordinary education in the link between
quantitative and qualitative thinking in an
important area. This helps them —
particularly our liberal arts majors — become
more interested in other technical fields."
Walter E. Massey, Ph.D.
» President
Morehouse College and
Past President
National Science Foundation
"Biosphere 2 is a fabulous experimental
facility. It allows students to learn about the
roles of organisms in many representative
environments — soil, forests, oceans — and
to foresee how these systems may respond
to a changing world."
Diana H. Wall, Ph.D.
Professor and Director
Natural Resource Ecology Lab
Colorado State University
'The faculty blew me away ... what a
pleasure good, enthusiastic, caring teachers
can make out of an academic experience."
