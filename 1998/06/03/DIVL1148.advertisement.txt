how to find assumptions, recognize ambiguity, evaluate arguments, and
judge the credibility of sources of expert opinion. To think critically in one s daily Ufe

assignments from a variety of disciplines. 3 units, Leslie TownseruL, lecturer.

CTL 40, Reading Faster and Smarter. Many of us feel overwhelmed by the amount of
reading material that we must wade through. Hands-on learning and practical tech
niques increase reading comprehension, concentration, and recall, and speed work with
all types of reading materials, including academic, pleasure, technical, and business.
Students spend less time re-reading material, expand their vocabulary, and develop the
skills needed to read faster and smarter. 1 unit, Leslie Townsend, lecturer.

CTL 118, Public Speaking. A practical approach to the art of public speaking, students
