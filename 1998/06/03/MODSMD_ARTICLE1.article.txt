# Montoya's first year
## Vice provost reflects on job 
### Jennie Berry Staff writer 
It's easy to like the person who signed your
college acceptance letter. But being the vice
provost for student affairs does not garner in
stant affection, especially in turbulent times.
It's been almost a year since James Mon
toya left his position as dean of undergraduate
admissions and financial aid to replace Mary
Edmonds as vice provost for student affairs,
and already he has addressed his share of
major campus issues: housing, financial aid
and student voice.
However, despite the controversies, Mon
toya remains positive about student affairs,
and he's already excited about plans for next
year.
"The position is less glamorous than the
dean but, in most ways, much more reward
ing," Montoya said. "The learning curve has
been incredibly steep."
One of the steepest inclines in that learning
curve resulted from the controversial housing
changes announced earlier this year.

Working closely with Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Ramon Saldi'var,
Montoya helped implement the recommenda
tions of the Task Force on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for Undergradu
ates. "Progress on any one issue requires an
extensive amount of teamwork," Montoya
said.

Changes included the creation of a sopho
more priority dormitory, more all-freshman
dorms and the first sorority housing on campus
since 1944. Many students were upset with the
changes, including the disabled students and
residents of the houses being converted to
sorority house.
