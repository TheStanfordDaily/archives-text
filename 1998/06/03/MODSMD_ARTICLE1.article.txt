# Montoya's first year
## Vice provost reflects on job 
### Jennie Berry Staff writer 
It's easy to like the person who signed your
college acceptance letter. But being the vice
provost for student affairs does not garner in
stant affection, especially in turbulent times.
It's been almost a year since James Mon
toya left his position as dean of undergraduate
admissions and financial aid to replace Mary
Edmonds as vice provost for student affairs,
and already he has addressed his share of
major campus issues: housing, financial aid
and student voice.
However, despite the controversies, Mon
toya remains positive about student affairs,
and he's already excited about plans for next
year.
"The position is less glamorous than the
dean but, in most ways, much more reward
ing," Montoya said. "The learning curve has
been incredibly steep."
One of the steepest inclines in that learning
curve resulted from the controversial housing
changes announced earlier this year.

Working closely with Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Ramon Saldi'var,
Montoya helped implement the recommenda
tions of the Task Force on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for Undergradu
ates. "Progress on any one issue requires an
extensive amount of teamwork," Montoya
said.

Changes included the creation of a sopho
more priority dormitory, more all-freshman
dorms and the first sorority housing on campus
since 1944. Many students were upset with the
changes, including the disabled students and
residents of the houses being converted to
sorority house.

James Montoya has a lot to smile about — he has completed his first year as vice provost
for student affairs.
"l think he had a lot of things
thrust upon him ... a lot of new
Res Ed stuff, student voice and
concerns," said Alpha Sigma ac
tivist and ASSU Vice President
Santos Marroquin.
Also, Montoya is now working
to implement a premier year in the
undergraduate housing draw. With
a premier year, as defined by the
1997 Residential Task Force, each
student would be guaranteed a
Draw number between one and
1,200.
"I want to implement a program
students support and one which
deals with the specific concerns
students have about being able to
go through Stanford and never
being able to have a desirable liv
ing situation," Montoya said.
This year saw the first of the
changes to the Draw system under
Montoya's watch, where students
were informed of their numbers
before making residence choices.
Montoya said he is using his ex
perience in the admissions office to
prevent future housing problems.
"I feel that my background as
the former dean of undergraduate
admissions and financial aid has
been particularly useful in chairing
a committee looking at enrollment
figures," Montoya said. "I wanted
to make certain that we are not
over-enrolled next fall because we
know from this year's experience
[that] over-enrollment leads to
crowded housing."
This year, the University en
rolled a slightly smaller freshman
class of 1,600, compared to 1,648
from last year, and 110 transfer stu
dents, compared to 146 from last
year.
In addition to working to better
undergraduate housing, Montoya
has dealt with a number of gradu
ate student housing issues. Mon
toya and his staff announced in a
letter in today's Daily that they in
tend to have a proposal for new on
campus graduate housing devel
oped by next fall.
Montoya also plans to create a
graduate student service center by

September and to try to locate
more graduate student housing on
and off campus.
"One of the major changes in
my professional life since last year,
when I was much more focused on
undergraduate issues, is the fact
that this year has given me an op
portunity to familiarize myself with
the concerns of graduate stu
dents," Montoya said.
Teamwork, according to Mon
toya, has been essential in address
ing graduate student housing, an
issue that involves four vice
provosts.
"I've come to appreciate the im
portance of developing partner
ships across the University," he
said.
One change Montoya plans for
next year is to increase communi
cation between himself and the
supporting deans and directors
who report to him.
"I have spent a significant
amount of time with students —
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents — at times making it difficult
for staff to meet with me," he
noted. "As I look to next year, I
hope to find a better balance or in
crease my waking day by a few
hours."
Montoya has already initiated
"Second Tuesday," a monthly pro
gram where the student affairs staff
listens to feedback from students.
"These morning programs have
been helpful in setting a tone in the
division that students are our first
concern," he said.
Keeping students as his primary
focus, Montoya has set a goal to
meet with 50 to 100 students a
week.
Obviously, he added, many of
these meetings will have to be in
large-group settings, but Montoya
hopes he can continue to be viewed
as approachable.
"The only way in which I can be
successful in this role is to have
constant contact with Stanford stu
dents," he explained.
"In general, I've used this year
to collect data directly from stu
dents on issues ranging from over
all level of satisfaction to space
use."
"He's willing to listen to stu

dents," Marroquin said. "I'm look
ing forward to working with him."
In response to the results of the
Undergraduate Experience Survey
— which said students at Stanford
are generally happy but feel they
lack input on University policy de
cisions — Montoya created the
Quality Service Task Force to im
prove service to students.
"I'm incredibly optimistic that
the Quality Service Task Force will
present meaningful recommenda
tions that will have a positive im
pact on the life of students," he
said.
Montoya expressed high hopes
for improving student activity
space next year.
Montoya is in the midst of work
ing with the ASSU administration
on this issue. "The 18-month plan
is moving right along, and I am op
timistic that we will be able to iden
tify additional space for student
use in the next academic year," he
said.
Montoya also has helped for
mulate a new financial aid policy to
give more support to students.
Under the new plan, outside schol
arships will not replace Stanford
grant money, and a new formula
tion will limit the amount of home
equity the University took into
consideration when financial aid is
assigned.
Montoya is currently looking
into replacing the Network for Stu
dent Information, a software sys
tem that is central to conducting
the admissions, financial aid, regis
tration, records and bursar busi
ness of the University.
Costing millions of dollars, a re
placement of the current system
could be implemented by Decem
ber 2000.
The new system would provide
better service and be easier to op
erate.
In all, Montoya is satisfied with
the results of his first year on the
job.
"The focus of this position has
been to strengthen the infrastruc
ture of the student affairs divi
sion," Montoya said. "Thus many
of the accomplishments of which I
am most proud are not high pro
file.".,. ..

figures," Montoya said. "I wanted
to make certain that we are not
over-enrolled next fall because we
know from this year's experience
[that] over-enrollment leads to
crowded housing."
This year, the University en
rolled a slightly smaller freshman
class of 1,600, compared to 1,648
from last year, and 110 transfer stu
dents, compared to 146 from last
year.
In addition to working to better
undergraduate housing, Montoya
has dealt with a number of gradu
ate student housing issues. Mon
toya and his staff announced in a
letter in today's Daily that they in
tend to have a proposal for new on
campus graduate housing devel
oped by next fall.
Montoya also plans to create a
graduate student service center by

September and to try to locate
more graduate student housing on
and off campus.
"One of the major changes in
my professional life since last year,
when I was much more focused on
undergraduate issues, is the fact
that this year has given me an op
portunity to familiarize myself with
the concerns of graduate stu
dents," Montoya said.
Teamwork, according to Mon
toya, has been essential in address
ing graduate student housing, an
issue that involves four vice
provosts.
"I've come to appreciate the im
portance of developing partner
ships across the University," he
said.
One change Montoya plans for
next year is to increase communi
cation between himself and the
supporting deans and directors
who report to him.
"I have spent a significant
amount of time with students —
undergraduates and graduate stu
dents — at times making it difficult
for staff to meet with me," he
noted. "As I look to next year, I
hope to find a better balance or in
crease my waking day by a few
hours."
Montoya has already initiated
"Second Tuesday," a monthly pro
gram where the student affairs staff
listens to feedback from students.
"These morning programs have
been helpful in setting a tone in the
division that students are our first
concern," he said.
Keeping students as his primary
focus, Montoya has set a goal to
meet with 50 to 100 students a
week.
Obviously, he added, many of
these meetings will have to be in
large-group settings, but Montoya
hopes he can continue to be viewed
as approachable.
"The only way in which I can be
successful in this role is to have
constant contact with Stanford stu
dents," he explained.
"In general, I've used this year
to collect data directly from stu
dents on issues ranging from over
all level of satisfaction to space
use."
"He's willing to listen to stu

dents," Marroquin said. "I'm look
ing forward to working with him."
In response to the results of the
Undergraduate Experience Survey
— which said students at Stanford
are generally happy but feel they
lack input on University policy de
cisions — Montoya created the
Quality Service Task Force to im
prove service to students.
"I'm incredibly optimistic that
the Quality Service Task Force will
present meaningful recommenda
tions that will have a positive im
pact on the life of students," he
said.
Montoya expressed high hopes
for improving student activity
space next year.
Montoya is in the midst of work
ing with the ASSU administration
on this issue. "The 18-month plan
is moving right along, and I am op
timistic that we will be able to iden
tify additional space for student
use in the next academic year," he
said.
Montoya also has helped for
mulate a new financial aid policy to
give more support to students.
Under the new plan, outside schol
arships will not replace Stanford
grant money, and a new formula
tion will limit the amount of home
equity the University took into
consideration when financial aid is
assigned.
Montoya is currently looking
into replacing the Network for Stu
dent Information, a software sys
tem that is central to conducting
the admissions, financial aid, regis
tration, records and bursar busi
ness of the University.
Costing millions of dollars, a re
placement of the current system
could be implemented by Decem
ber 2000.
The new system would provide
better service and be easier to op
erate.
In all, Montoya is satisfied with
the results of his first year on the
job.
"The focus of this position has
been to strengthen the infrastruc
ture of the student affairs divi
sion," Montoya said. "Thus many
of the accomplishments of which I
am most proud are not high pro
file.".,. ..
