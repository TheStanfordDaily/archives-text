Albanian refugees report civil war
PADESH, Albania (AP) — Shock etched on their faces, ethnic
Albanians fleeing the violence in Kosovo province gave firsthand
accounts yesterday of a major Serb offensive against separatists that is
fast turning into another all-out civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
Trekking over the mountains for up to two days, refugees joining
the growing exodus to neighboring Albania described artillery bom
bardments that forced out entire villages, and house-burnings they said
were clearly intended to drive them out.
"It's ethnic cleansing, and it's done the same way as in Bosnia," said
Ukshin Maliqi, 35, comparing the situation in Kosovo with practices in
neighboring Bosnia that appalled the world during that three-year war.
"They shell first so that we abandon our houses, then they burn
them so that we cannot return." he said.
The accounts of weeping refugees provided some of the most
detailed information yet about the stepped-up campaign launched in
late May by Serb police and army forces, who are trying to crush the
pro-independence Kosovo Liberation Army.
The militants have been gaining in popularity and numbers after
years of heavy-handed rule by Serbian authorities in the secessionist
southern province, where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
population of 2.2 million.
It doesn't matter if you win or lose ...
BOSTON (AP) — No keeping score. No awards ceremonies. No
winners. Some might call it soccer without the kick.
The Massachusetts Youth Soccer Association calls it "nonresult-ori
ented competition" and now is requiring it for all tournaments involv
ing players 10 and under. The group is considering extending the prac
tice to 12-year-olds.
With no winners in the tournaments — scores are OK in regular
season games — the association figures there will be no losers, and
none of the bad feelings that can come with defeat.
"We're trying to take away that 'You've-gotta-win-the-trophy' feel
ing," Cathy Cresta, the association's registrar, said in a telephone inter
view yesterday. "These children don't need that kind of pressure."
But some young players said soccer without victory is like peanut
butter without jelly.
"It's dumb and stupid," 10-year-old Mike Ross of Plymouth said.
"It's fun to win."
Not keeping score in sports for young children is nothing new. Sen
timent against the Vince Lombardi-like drive to win has been reflected
for years in early-stage sports like Mitey Mites football and tee-ball.
But few would have thought it likely that winnerless sports might be
played by 12-year-olds, as the Massachusetts soccer association is con
sidering.
Ronald Smith, secretary-treasurer of the North American Society
for Sport in America, said proponents of scoreless games got their start
during the social upheaval of the late Vietnam War era.
Outpatient, overnight care square up
WASHINGTON (AP) — Medicare breast cancer patients who
undergo mastectomies as outpatients face about the same risk of
complications as women who spend a night in the hospital after the
surgery, federal researchers report.
Their study, to be published today in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, supports the idea that many women will do better
following mastectomy if they remain in the hospital for at least one
night, but it also shows that an outpatient procedure is "a reason
able option" for elderly women who have no other type of health
problem.
Two bills have been proposed in Congress to block what some
legislators have called "drive-thru mastectomies." Both bills would
require insurance companies to pay for hospitalization if that is the
choice of the patient and her physician. About 11 percent of breast
cancer patients on Medicare who undergo mastectomies do so as
outpatients.
A Senate bill, pushed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would
base the hospitalization on patient need as determined by the
patient and the doctor. A House bill, authored by Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, D-Conn., and backed by President Clinton, requires that
insurance companies pay for 48-hour hospital stays for mastec
tomies if that is the choice of the patient.
Joan L.. Warren, a National Cancer Institute researcher, said the
studv results are not conclusive about which type of care is best.
"We come down pretty squarely in the middle." Warren said.
"For women who decided they want an outpatient mastectomy and
discuss it with their physician, we show it is a reasonable option."
