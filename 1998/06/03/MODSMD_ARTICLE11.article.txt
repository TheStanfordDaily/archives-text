# Prop. 227 passes

### 
LOS ANGELES (AF) — California voters elimi
nated the state's 30-year-old system of bilingual educa
tion last night, while a proposal to weaken the political
clout of labor unions was failing.
Proposition 227, the brainchild of software million
aire Ron Unz. will essentially replace the state's bilin
gual education program with an English immersion
program after one year of transition classes. Parents
can ask that their children get bilingual education but
only under limited conditions.
With 24 percent of precincts reporting. 66 percent,
or 1,099,308 voters, had approved Proposition 227.
while 34 percent, or 571.461. were against it.
Proposition 226 — dubbed "paycheck protection"
by sponsors — drew opposition from union leaders,
who saw it leading a national campaign to require
them to obtain a member's permission before spend
ing dues on politics.
With 24 percent of precincts reporting, the measure
was being rejected by 51 percent, or 816.564 voters,
while 796,314 voters, or 49 percent, were for it.
Pre-election polls indicated a majority of voters
backed the bilingual education measure, which
includes $50 million a year for 10 years to pay for tutor
ing. It will also allow parents to sue if teachers ilout the
law.
Proponents said the experiences of earlier genera
tions show children can pick up English quickly. They

argued that the current system condemns children to a
linguistic limbo where they fall behind their English
schooled peers.
Opponents admitted there are problems in bilin
gual education. But they said the sink-or-swim Unz
solution will push a vulnerable population into danger
ous waters.
More than 50 languages are spoken on California
school yards and the state offers instruction in 20 of
them. Eighty percent of limited-English children are
Spanish speakers, turning the debate into a largely His
panic issue. Polls suggested the measure had wide sup
port among Hispanic voters.
The hackers of Proposition 226. the union-dues
measure, said union members should have a say in
where their money is spent. With most union political
efforts favoring Democrats, big business and Republi
cans led the fight for Proposition 226.
The initiative triggered a hitter spending war
expected to top $20 million — the costliest of the
propositions on the primary ballot. Pre-election polls
indicated that the measure, once a lopsided favorite to
pass, had become a tossup.
The AFL-CIO ran $11 million worth of TV ads that
questioned the motives ol thi initiative's backers and
warned of dire consequences for everything from
Medicare to food safety if labor's political advocacy
was hampered.
