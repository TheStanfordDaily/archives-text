### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis, outspent by mil
lions of dollars and last in the pulls
just 2 1/2 months ago, surged past
two wealthy rivals to capture the
Democratic nomination for gover
nor and set up a general election
contest against Republican Attorney
General Dan Lungren.
With 12 percent of precincts
reporting, Davis had 406,451 votes,
or 34 percent. Millionaire business
man A 1 Checchi had 147,539, or 12
percent, and Rep. Jane Harman had
139,255, or 12 percent. Several minor
Democratic candidates had less than
1 percent. Harman conceded about
9:45 p.m., saying she had called
Davis and his wife to congratulate
them.
"They are friends and have been

for a long time and Gray ran an
excellent campaign, and 1 will join
him tomorrow at the Unity Break
fast to help beat Dan Lungren," Har
man told supporters in Manhattan
Beach.
"Winning is more fun. but losing
with honor ain't bad," a beaming
Harman said. "We ran a positive
campaign, the only kind I have ever
run."
Checchi did not immediately con
eede. Lungren had 448.758 votes, or
37 percent of the total in the state's
first "blanket primary" which pits all
candidates against each other,
regardless of party. He was trailed by
GOP medicinal marijuana advocate
Dennis Peron and several other
minor candidates
"Let's make sure that we have a

campaign that's based on issues, that
talks about what the people of Cali
fornia want to do," Lungren told
rowdy supporters at his election
night headquarters.
"Whoever the nominee the
Democrats present to us. I think will
show a contrast to what I hope to
bring to Californians. Gray Davis,
for instance, has identified himself as
a liberal Democrat. I identify myself
as a conservative Republican.
More than any other primary
contest, the gubernatorial race
offered California voters a chance to
send a message about the mix of
experience, leadership and politics
they prize as the state enters the new
millennium.
Checchi, Northwest Airlines
chief, and Harman. wife of a million

aire stereo company owner, outspent
Davis by millions. Jason Campbell.
24. said outside a polling place in
Pasadena that he felt "bombarded"
with the advertisements for political
campaigns on television, but he
didn't pay any attention. "You can't
believe everything you see on TV."
The "blanket" primary, made law
bv voters themselves through a 19%
ballot measure, also ushered in a
new style of campaign.
The candidates hunted for
"crossover" ballots from voters in
the other party. Harman called her
self "the best Republican in the
Democratic Party." and Lungren,
though facing no major opposition,
was forced to spend hard-won cam
paign cash on TV' ads to fend off the
poaching attempts.
