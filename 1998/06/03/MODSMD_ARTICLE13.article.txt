# Military intelligence fails test
## CIA had no knowledge of India's nuclear testing 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” U.S. intelligence
failed to warn of India's nuclear weapons tests
because of leadership lapses, ptx>r on-the-ground
intelligence and failure to pay attention to spy
satellite pictures that offered valuable clues, a
review panel concluded yesterday.
Hut a wide-ranging critique of the CIA and
other U.S. intelligence agencies stopped short of
recommending that anyone be fired or punished.
The reviewers noted that no one was killed
because of the lapses and concluded that U.S. pol
icy-makers. had they been warned, probably
would not have been able to dissuade India from
conducting the tests.

The panel's 26-page report found fault with top
CIA leadership, including CIA Director George
Tenet, with the compartmentalized organization
of U.S. intelligence, and with imagery specialists
who left photographic evidence of India's plans
"on the cutting room floor."
In its key finding, the report cited veteran CIA
analysts who dismissed as campaign rhetoric the
pre-election promises hv India's ruling Hindu
nationalist party to conduct tests.
"We should have been much more aggressive
in thinking how the other guy thinks." said retired
Adm. David E. Jeremiah, who headed the panel
and outlined the report's conclusions at a news

conference at CIA headquarters. The report itself
is classified and was not made public.
"There is no getting around the fact that we did
not predict these particular Indian nuclear tests."
Tenet said in a statement. "We did not get it right.
Period. We have a professional responsibility to
stand up. acknowledge that, and learn from it."
Tenet named Jeremiah to head the review on
May 12. the day after India announced it had ear
ned out three underground nuclear tests, to the
complete surprise of U.S. policy-makers. The
appointment came during intense criticism of the
CIA. and Tenet took the unusual step of ordering
the review completed in less than a month.
