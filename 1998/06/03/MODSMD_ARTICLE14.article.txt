CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (AP) â€” Space
shuttle Discovery thundered into orbit yester
day on NASA's last voyage to Mir. a flight to
bring home the seventh and final American to
stay aboard the Russian space station.
The shuttle and its crew of six took off right
on time and soared through a sweltering early
evening sky.
It was one of the hottest shuttle launches
ever. In the final minutes of the countdown,
the temperature still hovered at 95 degrees,
prompting NASA to keep close watch on the
hydraulic systems at the pad. especially the
movable walkway. The limit for launching is W
degrees.
Commander Charles Preeourt couldn't
resist shouting out in Russian seconds after the
booster rockets lit: "Poyekhali." which means
"Off we go."
About 250 miles above Earth. Mir's auto
matic thrusters were finng on cue. keeping the
station on an unswerving course. The cosnnv
nauts fixed the steering system Monday, three
days after it shut down Without automatic
steering. Mir would have been Ux> shaky for a
shuttle diking. Discovery is scheduled to
reach Mir tomorrow and bring NASA astro
naut Andrew Thomas back to Earth on June
12 after his four-month station stay.
From then on, NASA will concentrate on
the international space station; construction

will begin in orbit at the end of the year.
The Russians plan to continue flying
aboard Mir through IW, after which they will
let it burn up in the atmosphere. Then they,
too. will focus all their efforts on the new joint
space station.
Mir's three-man crew was reportedly asleep
when Discovery blasted off: the space station
was flying over Ireland 5,500 miles awav on its
70.183 rd swing around the world. Earlier in the
day. Thomas informed flight controllers he'd
like some lasagna and Oreo ice cream waiting
for him when he gets back.
"Have a smooth nde up the hill and bring
Andy back to us." a launch controller told the
shuttle crew moments before liftoff.
The countdown was tenser than usual, not
just because of the on-then-off anxiety over
Mir but because of the new lightweight fuel
tank bolted to Discovery during liftoff. The
lank, never before tested in flight, is 7.500
pounds lighter when empty than the 65.500-
pound previous models so that NASA can
haul heavier cargo once space station con
struction begins. NASA said early indications
show the tank worked well.
This will be NASA's ninth and final linkup
with Mir. As usual, the shuttle will transport a
few thousand pounds of water, food and other
supplies to the Russians, and bring back U.S.
experiments.
