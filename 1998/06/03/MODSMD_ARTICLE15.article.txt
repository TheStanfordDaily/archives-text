## Editor's Farewell Late nights, good lovin' 
### 
Last Thursday, on the
final night of my last full week
of putting out The Daily, I got
a call from the printer at 3 a.m.
"We're having trouble with the
line," Bruce said, "The FTP site is
down. It'd probably be best if you
drove down the ZIP disk."
So, at three in the morning, 1 rue
fully changed out of my pajamas and
drove down to San Jose to deliver the
files of Friday's paper.
All in a day's work.
The last four months have gone by
in a blur of hit and missed deadlines,
dinners on The Daily and more all
nighters than I care to count. And 1
wonder, as does my family, whether
there is some masochistic streak in me
that makes me enjoy working 60 hours
a week, doing schoolwork on my one
day weekends and living at the beck
and call of the paper's demands.
But as the hours wind down in the
twilight of my editor's tenure, I know
that I've loved this job. I am proud of
how responsive this paper has been to
its readership, offering comprehensive
coverage on issues ranging from
women and minority faculty tenure to
student housing changes.
My tenure as editor in chief has
afforded me a unique interaction with
all sorts of members of the Stanford
community. I have been beseeched by
student leaders and reprimanded by
angry readers. I've developed a
greater understanding, but not appre
ciation for, bureaucracy. And I have
responded to the Daily staff members,
whose problems stemmed from things
like Coffee House concussions to gen

eral fatigue.
I am less optimistic about the admin
istration making sincere efforts to meet
student needs, but I have more faith in
the pure dedication exhibited by stu
dents committed to a cause. I under
stand the difference between using
three and four dots in an ellipsis. I've
realized that I can sleep at night know
ing that someone is upset with me; per
fection should keep a person humble,
but not deflated. And I've discovered
that I can't be as hard on others as I am
on myself â€” and that I shouldn't be
that hard on myself.
But the strongest impression that I
leave this job with is the immeasur
able respect I have for the staff who 1
worked with me to put out the paper
every day.
We worked 19 hours the day class
es were flooded out, updating our
World Wide Web site regularly while
other students relished their day off.
In April, staff members stayed up
until 5 a.m. getting the results of the
ASSU elections into the next day's
paper. Die-hard members of the
sports department sacrificed count
less hours of sleep and academic
work to produce extended coverage
of March Madness and all of our
NCAA successes.
No, there's no masochistic streak
here. It's simply been a privilege to
have enjoyed these past four months
so immensely.
