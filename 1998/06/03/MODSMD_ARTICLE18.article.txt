## The 						power of positive thinking 
### 
IF YOU'VE BEEN
reading my column
over the last few
months, you might have
concluded that I am a bit
ter, depressed and whiny
Stanford student. You
IIJ
may be surprised to know
that I also have some pos-

itive things to say about my four years at the
Stanford country club.
1. Need-blind admissions: Stanford's
socioeconomic diversity is not as broad as it
could be. However, a need-blind admissions
policy encourages more applicants from
lower-class backgrounds because their abil
ity to pay does not affect their chances of
getting in. Of course, this is not the case for
international students — take note, Dean
Kinnally!
2. Affirmative action: Given the hostile
political climate in California, props to Uni
versity President Gerhart Casper for a
renewed commitment to affirmative action.
While the current system is not perfect,
increasing attention to the issue of class
could improve this necessary policy.
3. Gender integration: After visiting a
friend at the University of New Mexico, I
was grateful for Stanford's pro coed poli
cies. While Chi Theta Chi's group coed
showers are not for everyone, it's great that
we are beginning to break down gender
taboos. We should continue by making it
easier for coed Draw groups to stay united
and allowing for coed roommates. Such a

practice is already kosher in EBF and
Columbae.
4. Location, location, location: Stan
ford's position allows relatively easy access
to Tahoe, Yosemite, the ocean, the wine
country and San Francisco. Having grown
up in Canada, I appreciate the mild North
ern California weather and lush vegetation.
The campus is also beautiful. Sandstone
architecture, palm trees, foothills and wild
flowers sure beat nine months of winter!
5. Great athletics: Stanford is the only
elite school that combines first-rate aca
demics with first-rate athletics. The combi
nation emphasizes Stanford's commitment
to a holistic experience for both mind and
body. This is reflected in the numerous ath
letic facilities and the new gym in Tresidder
Union (too bad it's like exercising in a fish
bowl). Go Cardinal!
6. Housing options: Although housing is
in short supply, Stanford offers undergradu
ates a variety of options including dorms,
self-ops, co-ops, and theme dorms and
houses. This is better than a system that
assigns you to one college for your entire
undergraduate education, or one where you
choose between nasty dorms or off-campus
housing.
7. Study abroad: Stanford makes it easy
to study abroad or in Washington, D.C. We
have campuses with Stanford faculty, which
prevents the hassle of credit transfer. Stan
ford should expand this program to the
Middle East and Africa.
One of the drawbacks to these programs

is that they prevent immersion in a new cul
ture by providing too much Stanford com
fort.
8. Social integration: Random and
required on-campus housing for freshmen is
the first place we are forced to deal with
people who are different from us. One ben
efit of a residentially-based school, where
students move each year, is that they meet
people they may not have otherwise known.
After freshman year, segregation by race
and theme increases. But the degree of mix
ing at Stanford surpasses many campuses
where most students live off campus.
Where else would you see hippies at frater
nity parties and Dollies in Okada?
9. Safety: The only benefit of being in the
suburbs is that our campus is fairly safe. The
police patrol frequently, and the biggest
campus crime is bike theft. You can usually
walk home alone after midnight — or call
SURE escort for a ride.
10.Bank: The benefit of going to a school
with generous alumni and friends is the
strong economic support for financial aid,
undergraduate research, student-led classes
and athletic scholarships. Gifts also finance
first-class buildings, equipment, professors,
facilities, lecture series and pretty much
everything else on campus.

anthropology. He and Tiffany would like to
recognize this year's Top Ten: Brian, Felix,
Douglas, Pieter, Nirav, Biren, Bill, Karen,
Derrick and Amori.
