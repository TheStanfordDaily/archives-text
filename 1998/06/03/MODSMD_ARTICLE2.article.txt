### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais
announced yesterday that Gwen
dolyn Dean will fill the half-time
directorship position at the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Communi
ty Center.
"I'm very excited about the po
sition and looking forward to
working with students and the
staff," Dean said.
She is currently the graduate co
ordinator of the Office of Lesbian.
Gay and Bisexual Life at Emory
University in Atlanta, where she is
a doctoral candidate in feminist
theory and lesbian, gay and bisexu
al studies.
She holds a master's degree in
performance art, art theory and
criticism from UC-Irvine.
Dean was chosen out of a com
petitive pool of 65 applicants from
across the nation. A University
search committee consisting of stu
dents, faculty and staff reviewed

the candidates and made a recom
mendation to Wais.
Dean "was the overwhelming
unanimous choice of the selection
committee," said Wais.
He added that those who met
her raved about her vision, experi
ence and understanding of lesbian,
gay and bisexual issues.
"I think she's a great fit for the
job because she has significant ex
perience as a teacher and adminis
trator within the higher education
setting," Wais added.
Dean has spoken at numerous
academic conventions, including
the National Queer Studies Con
ference.
She also has experience facili
tating discussions about sexual ori
entation. having done so at a con
ference of university officials in the
Atlanta area.
Wais said students on the com
mittee were impressed with her
scholarly and analytical approach
to issues.
Dean said she is excited about
the feminist studies program at
Stanford and enjoyed meeting stu
dents when she visited the campus.
"Most universities are engaged
in an ongoing process of multicul
turalism and diversity," she said.
"It is possible that lesbian, gay, bi
sexual and transsexual issues are
less advanced."
Her plans for the center include
establishing regular hours and in
creasing the involvement of gradu
ate students.
She also said she hopes to work
with the Career Planning and
Placement Center to assist students
as they enter the professional
world.
"She had some good ideas about

how to serve graduate students,"
said education master's student
Hillary McKinney, who served on
the committee.
"I think we're really lucky to get
her, and I'm excited about the fu
ture of the center," she said.
The hiring of Dean marks the
culmination of student effort to
gain a director for the center, which
previously had been the only cam
pus community center without a
full-time director.
Student proposals requested
one, and the University was criti
cized by some when funds were
only allocated for a half-time direc
tor.
"I'm hopeful that the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community and
the rest of the Stanford community
can rally around Gwendolyn to
allow her to succeed," Wais said.
Dean is expected to begin her
duties Aug. 1.
