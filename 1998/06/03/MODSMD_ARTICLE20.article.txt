Serious problem will
receive serious attention
Over the summer, staff across the Uni
versity will continue to work on graduate
student housing issues with graduate stu
dent representatives. We all agree that the
housing shortage and the high cost of off
campus housing deserve our most serious
attention. By the end of the summer we
plan to have a proposal to build new on
campus housing to present to the Board of
Trustees at their October meeting; locate
additional living spaces on- and off-campus
for graduate student use; and, a graduate
student service center for the month of
September to handle housing, billing and
registration problems.
In the meantime, a number of steps are
being taken to mitigate the problem to
some extent. These include:
1) Earlier in the week the Housing
Assignment Office announced that stu
dents who applied for and did not receive
an autumn housing assignment will be
released from their summer contract
throughout the summer with no additional
fee.
2) An increase in fellowship stipends,
teaching assistant salaries, and research

assistant salaries that is substantially higher
than the increases in other areas of the Uni
versity's budget.
3) A loan fund to help students cover
security deposits and first/last month rent
requirements for off-campus housing.
4) An emergency grant fund to help doc
toral students with short-term financial
crises brought about by housing-related
problems.
Graduate students in need of an applica
tion for a short-term loan and / or emergen
cy grant should not hesitate to be in touch
with the Office of Financial Aid. Applica
tions will be available soon.
In short, the University is making a seri
ous effort to address an extremely serious
problem.
