# From the fourth dimension
## Beware of the backward glance of nostalgia 
### 
Kerry Rodgers

AS THE END approaches, the capi
talist powers that be are selling us
tokens of nostalgia like cotton
candy at a cheap carnival.
"Graduating suckers, get your Class of '98
mugs, caps, I-shirts and souvenir tassels
before it's too late! Buy your overpriced class
ring and your fancy diploma frame before
they're all gone! Two for the price of one!"
I'm certainly not immune to their wily
marketing tactics. I ordered my graduation
announcements and donated to the senior
class fund in a surge of good will. I've got my
Alumni Association membership card in my
wallet, and I scammed a free key chain. And
with the panicked thought that I may never
see so many red "S"s again, I've begun eye
ing unnecessary plastic objects emblazoned
with "Die Luft der Freiheit weht" every time
I enter the Bookstore.
I've also begun organizing the stack of
snapshots on my desk into a cohesive group.
I bought a new journal to start writing in the
day this is all over, in the hope of making the
transition complete. I'm mentally folding my
Stanford experience into an aggregate mem

ory, to be stored in some synaptic morass.
While I feel a certain internal profundity
about undergoing the metamorphosis from
student to real person, I find myself having
the same blase conversation with acquain
tances: "Can you believe it went by so fast?"
The music swells, our hearts flutter, the
credits roll.
But I can only take so much dreck. I've
read too many wistful memoirs every spring
in The Daily — nauseating nostalgia with
catchy references to Stanford lingo and
cliche messages about how what was really
important is not the classes we took but the
friends we met.
It makes me gag on my tofu. Save it for
the birth of your first child already.
Not only do I find such sentimentality
annoying, tasteless, and phony, I also think it
is somewhat dangerous. When we start look
ing back at the past with rose-colored glasses,
we skew our perspective about ourselves and
our history.
It's a pattern I've witnessed parents and
grandparents and other old relatives exhibit.
They start reminiscing about how the world

used to he — no crime, no drugs, no rock 'n'
roll, no premarital sex. Back when life was
dandy and nice and graffiti-free.
That is, if you happened to have been
horn a middle-class, Protestant, heterosexual
white male. God forbid you should have
been poor, heathen, non-white, female or
gay. If you were, life wasn't always so peachy.
Our connection to this good ol' boys club
mentality is not so remote. Simply by my
membership in the Alumni Association, I'm
affiliating myself with the ranks of very dif
ferent kinds of Stanford graduates — the
ones who were here when this institution was
effectively closed to blacks and when women
aspired to graduate with husbands rather
than careers.
Some of the alumni liked it that way.
They don't understand why we got rid of
their offensive Indian mascot, and they think
multiculturalism is part of a communist con
spiracy rampant in the administration.
I'm wary of modernist teleological views
of progress. Simply because we attend Stan
ford in the contemporary age does not mean
we are morally superior to our predecessors.

We have our problems, and future students
may respond in horror when they find out we
graduated in the '90s. They may remember
our year as a time when graduate students
were provided with inadequate housing,
when few female and minority professors
received tenure, and when our Athletics
Department was a walking (and running and
jumping) advertisement for a company with
exploitative labor practices.
We still have sexism, racism, classism and
homophobia in 1998.
But I won't hold any demonstrations on
graduation day or make a scene arguing with
the provost at the pre-Commencement party
about what is imperfect at Stanford. There is
a time to protest and a time to celebrate. No
one wants a cynic in the midst. Still, we
needn't let the fun distort the truth: we've got
a long way to go before we realize our ideals.
Perhaps someday the ills of Stanford and
other institutions will be lessened through
commitment to acceptance, tolerance and
justice. It can only happen if we're not caught
up in the past to the point that we are resis
tant to change.

ITiat is the real crime of nostalgia. In nos
talgic mentality, the locus points for the best
of times are the days of yore. Nostalgia con
strues bygone eras as the zeniths of earthly
existence. Fantasizing about the past breeds
complacency in the present and pessimism
about the future. It encourages ruminating
on the way things used to be. instead of envi
sioning the way they could be.
I've had mixed experiences over the past
few years at Stanford — mostly good, some
bad. I'm happy 1 came here. My friends are
happy I came here. My parents are really
happy I came here. And I'm ready to move on.
The hope I feel for possible futures far
exceeds the magic I've witnessed here.
And so, friends, comrades, classmates: it's
been a great ride, but it's only the beginning
of a glorious trail. Live it up.
