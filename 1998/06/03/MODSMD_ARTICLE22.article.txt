## Treated like a stranger in my West Lag 'home' 
### 
John Norwood

STANFORD WAS supposed to be my
"home away from home." When I
received my acceptance packet in May
19%, I was welcomed into a new family,
where I could express myself without inhibi
tions. This family would recognize me as a
full-fledged member regardless of how I
arrived or what I looked like.
But spring quarter of my freshman year,
I confirmed my suspicion. Even within Stan
ford's palm-studded perimeter, social injus
tice persists.
I was comfortably settled in my "home"
for the year. West Lagunita. One desolate
evening, Icoulnd't sleep. A good friend's
decision to leave Stanford as well as a loom
ing final CIV paper kept my mind racing.
At 3:56 a.m., I left my room for a walk,
searching for solace from the beams of real
ity in the hallways of my "home." I had seen
all the doors in Eucalipto, and I needed a
change of scenery. From Eucalipto, I wan
dered into Granada, right next door. After
all, Eucalipto, Granada and Adelfa are all
"home" — WEST LAG.

Looking at the pictures plastered on my
neighbors' doors, I sensed someone's pres
ence. What's old boy in the bathrobe look
ing at me for? Just take your shower — you
don't know me. He should though; we're
practically neighbors. We sat there watching
The Simpsons on the same damn couch, and
he never muttered a "hello" in response to
my greeting headnod. What the hell was he
still looking at? I didn't feel like dealing with
him so 1 decided to go down to the kitch
enette to get a snack.
On the Granada lounge couch 20 min
utes after shower boy gave me a full body
scan, my thoughts were jumbled like felled
Jenga warriors. I was ready to go back home
to Los Angeles, but instead, I had to return
to "home" — Eucalipto, Room 245.
1 went out the door and looked down the
hall, but whoa — a Stanford sheriff. Still
wanting to be alone, 1 decided to circumvent
the officer and proceeded down an alternate
path. West Lag was my "home" — I
deserved to be comfortable, immune to jus
tification. Arriving upstairs and approaching

Eucalipto, I sighted two additional officers
— three in all. Who were they after?
Me. This must have been a misunder
standing. I had to remain civil, calm and col
lected.
"Excuse me, son. Let me talk to you,"
said one of the officers, with a hand resting
on the gun in his holster. "We got a call
about a suspicious person roaming the halls,
and he fits your description. May I ask what
you are doing up. son?"
Accosted in my own home on my way to
bed. I felt my emotions wanting to get the
better of me. But rather than protest loudly,
I was trained to answer the officer with def
erence.
"I live right over there in Eucalipto, been
here all year, and I have my..." I suddenly
realized that my ID card was lying on my
desk back in my unlocked room.
"Mv ID card and driver's license are in
my room. If you want to go and get it. we
can walk right over there and pick it up. and
I can prove to you all that I belong here."
Great, now the third one was behind me.

"In your room, yes. What room number
is that, son?"
"Room 245. We can go talk to my RA
right across the bridge. Actually, his RA
knows me. too," 1 said, nodding at bathrobe
man.
"That won't be necessary. We're just try
ing to figure out what's going on and why
you're here."
I was not a sexual predator. I was not
robbing anyone. No. No. No. NO. Calm, col
lected, civil. "Like I said, my RA is right
there," I repeated, pointing 30 feet down the
hall.
"It's real late. son. and we don't want to
wake up any of the people around here. Just
wanted to verify your situation, that's all."
"I know my driver's license number and
my Stanford I.D. by heart." I said. Just for
situations just like this. " If that will help. It's
0449...."
"And the driver's license?"
"B5 "I had to wait for the check to be
run through. No problem. I was up anyhow.
How fitting — a criminal stalking the halls

of a Stanford hall in Felix the Cat boxer
shorts.
"I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. But
it's advised that you do not walk the halls of
dorms foreign to you."
Or did the officer mean foreign to my
presence? I should wake up the other two
black people in Granada so they can share
in my foreign experience with me.
"I live right there, if you want to make
sure or even just see my home. I live right
there," I repeated again, gesturing toward
Eucalipto. Thirty feet.
But the officers did not accept my invita
tion.
"The good people asleep here needn't be
disturbed now. For future purposes, just be
more aware of the situation. It's not safe to
just wander around places you don't know,
or where vou are not known."

But I was home.

Next fall, John Norwood will be living in
Lagunita for his third year, as an ethnic theme
associate in Uiamaa.
