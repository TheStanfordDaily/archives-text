Let us know our address
While we're on the topic of arbitrary,
annoying housing policies (Miguel Lobo,
"Create More Lenient Housing Policies,"
May 29), let me fan the flames a bit more.
I have never understood why Stanford
does not inform students of their apartment
addresses before the move-in day. My wife
and I are moving back on campus June 21st.
But Stanford will not tell us our new
address until that date.
This creates serious problems because
we cannot inform credit card companies,
friends, etc. of our new address. My wife
cannot mail an important application to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Most ironic of all, I do not know how I will
receive my Stanford master's diploma. 1
cannot pick it up graduation day and the
only other option is for Stanford to mail it.
However, I must tell them in advance what
my address will be after July 1! At least I'm

not an unfortunate new student unable to
ship boxes until after 1 arrive.
Such blatant lack of concern would
cause financial losses for private sector
apartment complexes. Providing such infor
mation costs nothing, so private apartments
tell incoming residents their addresses a
month in advance. Stanford's absurd policy
is yet another example of low-quality ser
vice resulting from a campus monopoly.

Link subsidy to keeping
cars off campus
While the University frets over the cost
of providing sufficient graduate student
housing, it continues to provide car parking
for graduate students to commute from

somewhere else â€” certainly nowhere with
in 10 miles of here. That location is strictly
unaffordable. However, each parking space
costs the University anywhere from $100 to
$200 per month to care for and pay proper
ty taxes on. This includes maintenance and
landscaping costs only. Also, parking struc
tures cost $5 to 7 million to build and hold
about 200 to 300 cars.
This money would be better spent not to
build new housing but to subsidize housing
for those who will not drive cars to the cam
pus. Housing can also be cheaper if it
accommodates people without cars.
At a Stanford Bicycle Coalition meeting
two years ago, the Sand Hill Road develop
ment plan was laid out. The housing in the
plan included 35 percent of the units for
below-market rent. These units would be
available to staff and graduate students.
Two of us responded that the ratio
should be increased to 65 percent. The basis
of the Menlo Park opposition to this project
was the fear that the housing would be only
affordable to Sun Microsystems employees

who would somehow have to get onto Wil
low Road to get to work and back. If the
ratio was reversed, there would not have
been such a controversy. Besides, if the
housing is below-market for staff and grad
uate students, many of them would not
need cars. As any student from Switzerland
knows, that would reduce the cost of con
struction lor each unit by one third.

Thiessen meant no harm
Who has a "heightened sense of self
importance?" Not Eric Thiessen. whose
light and even self-mocking piece in last
Wednesday's Daily on the perils of kitchen
managing was as amusing as it set out to be.
If anything, Eric Friedman's long-winded,
extraordinarily petty response (Friday, May

29) to an offhand comment that he chose to
perceive as a slight to his own house showed
that Friedman is in fact the one who might
benefit from taking himself a bit less seri
ously.
Thiessen's remark that not everyone can
have good housing "no matter how many
times you repaint Cowell Cluster" hardly
suggests that Cowell Cluster is undesirable.
It merely makes the point that the sched
uled renovations will not turn the housing
situation into Utopia. Friedman's hostility
makes me wonder why he is so defensive.
1 also wonder why Friedman felt the
need to respond to an article that was clear
ly intended for entertainment with attacks
on the insignificance of Thiessen's job,
especially considering that the article made
joking references to the same.
Perhaps Friedman's interest is in flaunt
ing his own importance. His letter is self
promoting enough to suggest that. Then
again, maybe he just can't take a joke.
