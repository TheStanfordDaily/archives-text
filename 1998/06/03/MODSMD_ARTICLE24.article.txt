eDear Health Forum,
With Dead Week upon us, I've been con
suming increasing amounts of caffeine to
keep me awake so 1 can study longer
hours. Is there really any major adverse affect(s)
of over-consumption of caffeine?

A Dear Reader,
Clinical as well as laboratory
research has extensively documented
caffeine's effects. Studies suggest that
caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and,
if used regularly, can be addictive.
In a clinical study published in 1995 in the Jour
nal of Pharmacology and Biochemistry Behavior
by Richardson et al., Richardson studied the
effects of caffeine deprivation on young adults
who were either avid caffeine users (250mg/day),
moderate users (70mg/day) and abstainers. Sub
jects participating in the study were deprived of
caffeine for time periods ranging from 90 minutes
to seven days. Researchers found that acute caf
feine intake induced jitteriness and headaches but
prevented tiredness. Caffeine deprivation pro
duced withdrawal symptoms in all groups of
young adults. Effects ranged from headaches to
sluggishness. Richardson also concluded that to
avoid withdrawal symptoms, a caffeine user would
have to precisely regulate caffeine intake.
Furthermore, Ford et al. published a study this
past January in the Archives of Disabled Children
medical journal linking maternal caffeine intake to
an increased propensity for Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome (SIDS). They concluded that mothers
consuming 400mg or more of caffeine per day
(equivalent to approximately 4 or more cups of
coffee) increased their infant's chances of mortali
ty due to SIDS.
Yet another study reported by Fenster et al,
suggests a possible link between caffeine and
spontaneous abortion in pregnant women. The
bottom line? Controlling your caffeine intake
instead of letting the caffeine control you is prob
ably going to be in your best interest. Good luck
on finals!
