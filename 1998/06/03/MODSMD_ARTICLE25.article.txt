A new surgical procedure to make kidney dona
tion less invasive has been used for the first time in
the Bay Area by Stanford surgeons.
Last month. Mario Ricardez of San Jose was able
to donate one of his kidneys to his sister using the
new laparoscopic procedure, and is expected to need
only half the recovery time typically necessary for
kidney donors.
The new high-tech procedure, called "laparo
scopic live-donor nephrectomy," requires that sur
geons insert tubes into the abdomen of the donor
through four small holes, or ports. Using tiny instru
ments. the surgeons cut the kidney away from sur
rounding tissue and clamp the blood vessels shut.
Finally, the blood vessels are severed, and the
kidney is caught in a small sack inserted through one
of the ports. The organ is then compressed and
removed through one of the ports, which is enlarged
to 1.75 inches. The removed kidney can then be
transplanted into the recipient.
Ricardez's surgeon. Howard N. Winfield, who
practices with UCSF Stanford Health Care and is an
associate professor of urology at the Stanford School
of Medicine, explained the advantages of the laparo
scopic technique. "We don't have to cut through as
many muscles and nerves as we do with convention
al surgery to reach the kidneys. Early results indicate
that it is safe, and the organs are transplanted just as
successfully. And if for any reason we need to, we
can instantly convert to the traditional procedure,"
Winfield said.
During the operation, surgeons guide their tools
by looking at an overhead television monitor, since
they do not make large incisions into the abdomen as
is the case in the traditional technique. This proce
dure. called videolaparoscopy, is used in many dif
ferent procedures, such as gallbladder surgeries.
The development of videolaparoscopy permits
more non-invasive procedures to be performed, and
results in shorter recovery times.
"The benefit is not so much that the wound is
smaller — which it is — but that the surgery is less
invasive," Winfield said. Winfield further empha
sized that given the less invasive nature of the proce
dure, the donor has "the potential to leave the hos
pital and return to work more quickly and more
comfortably."
