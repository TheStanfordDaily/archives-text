# At SSRL, old accelerators find new uses
## 
### Ian Mitchell Contributing writer 
Particle accelerators are the physicist's sledgeham
mer — they accelerate bits of matter to near-light speed
and smash them into a menagerie of bizarre subatomic
beasts. One would not think that such a powerful
machine could also determine the delicate structure of
an HIV protease or detect the trace impurities on a sili
con wafer. Since 1974, however, researchers at Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) have been
using part of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) to do just that and more.
Synchrotrons such as the one at SSRL produce high
intensity synchrotron radiation as a byproduct of accel
erating particles to high speeds. Synchrotron radiation
comes in any wavelength, but researchers primarily har
ness radiation in the X-ray part of the spectrum. They
then focus the X-rays into a strong and compact beam.

Just as it's easier to read under a bank of
searchlights than with a pen light, researchers
can make faster and more accurate measure
ments with the synchrotron than with tradi
tional X-ray sources. Due to the relatively
short wavelength of X-rays, scientists can
probe the structure of matter at a much finer
resolution than was possible with any other
light source.

In the synchrotron's early years, scientists
primarily probed the chemical and electronic
structure of compounds using X-ray crystallog
raphy and spectroscopy. SSRL still performs
many of these experiments. Biologists use X
ray crystallography to study protein folding,
the action of new anti-viral drugs and the con
traction of muscle fibers, among other things.
Physicists use spectroscopy to understand the
operation of superconductors.

In the last two decades, how
ever, applications for the syn-

chrotron's radiation have multiplied. In
one experiment called total reflection X
ray fluorescence (TRXF), researchers use
X-rays to detect low-level contamination
of the silicon wafers used in chip produc
tion.
In TRXF, the X-rays emerging from
the synchrotron are focused at a shallow
angle onto the surface of a wafer. Most X
ray photons reflect off. but some collide
with atoms on the wafer surface. Those
atoms become excited, and. to rid them
selves of their excess energy, emit new
photons in all directions. This phe
nomenon is called fluorescence.
A detector measures the fluores
cence. Since each element fluoresces dif
ferently. researchers can identify the con
taminant by its signature frequencies. The
experiment is very sensitive to contami
nants because of the strength of the syn
chrotron X-rav source.
"Up until now we've been developing
the technique; seeing if we can maintain
the necessary cleanliness and provide cal-

ibrated results," said Piero Pianetta, assistant director of
SSRL. 'With our success, we now have a lot of industri
al interest in the process."
Using similar techniques, researchers try to decipher
how artificially introduced toxins such as Selenium bind
chemically in natural substances like soil. This knowl
edge, scientists hope, will aid in efforts to decontaminate
polluted sites. The synchrotron focuses radiation emit
ted by high-energy electrons circulating in the Stanford
Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR), located
at SLAC. SPEAR is an electron accelerator that circu
lates high-energy electrons in a nng approximately 80
meters in diameter.
SSRL currently has 10 light beams exiting SPEAR.
These beams are further divided and delivered to 25 dif
ferent experimental stations. Outside groups perform
most experiments, with well over a thousand
researchers visiting each year from over 150 different
institutions, including national and international univer
sities. research labs and industry.
SSRL is not about high energy physics. "We are
always trying to cultivate new user communities."
Pianetta said. Without users from biology, chemistry,
materials science and non-particle physics. SSRL is just
a bright X-rav source — a lighthouse nobody can see.
