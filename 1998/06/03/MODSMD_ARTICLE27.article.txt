# Sea snails illustrate vesicular transport

Studying mechanisms of sea snail
reproduction may be a leap from analyz
ing the biology of human cognition. But.
a technique pioneered in sea snails by
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare promises
to illuminate new paths in the study of
neurobiology.
When neurons communicate, they
produce vesicles — membrane-bound
sacs full of signaling chemicals. Almost
every task performed by the nervous sys
tem, from creating a tingling sensation
when your foot falls asleep, to soliloquiz
ing about what to order for dinner,
depends on vesicles budding off of neu
rons and releasing chemical messengers
to neurons down the line.
Despite the vital importance of this
process to understanding the nervous
system, scientists have not been able to
isolate and examine individual vesicles
until now. However, Zare and colleagues
have developed a method, published
recently in the journal Science, to study
the contents of a single vesicle.
"We really are seeing a new era dawn

ing in which people are trying to under
stand the chemistry of the brain and of
the central nervous system, with the pos
sibilities of amazing consequences, from
treating mental disease to improving
mental powers," Zare said.
Scientists routinely examine aggre
gates of vesicles to determine the amount
and type of molecules they contain.
Information about collections of vesicles,
however, obscures individual differences
between vesicles. Just as the average
height of a group of individuals tells
nothing about the 7-foot basketball play
er in the group, analyzing large numbers
of vesicles hides variability in vesicular
contents.
"Could it be that the real signals are
being hidden and confused by looking at
only averages?" Zare wondered. "1
thought likely so. and indeed our work
shows that to be the case."
"Almost all [communication] within
our brains is the result of vesicles being
released one at a time," said Molecular
and Cellular Physiology Prof. Richard
Scheller. "Different responses are elicit
ed from the vesicles with different con
tents. So it's very important to know the

contents of the individual vesicles."
Daniel Chiu. a graduate student, and
Sheri Lillard. a postdoctoral fellow, both
from Zare's lab, created a technique
using lasers to separate a single vesicle.
Since vesicles are extremely small — bil
lions can fit into a water droplet — it is
difficult to separate individual vesicles.
Instead of using vesicles such as those
used in inter-neuronal signaling, the pair
studied vesicles that regulate egg-laying
in sea snails. These vesicles are 1.000
times larger than vesicles in the brain,
making them far easier to study. "Snails
don't have many cells, but the cells they
have are nice and juicy." Zare said.
To study individual sea snail vesicles,
Zare's group used a laser beam to isolate
and immobilize a single vesicle. When
aimed in the general vicinity of the vesi
cle. the organelle migrates to the most
intense region of the beam. Liu and Lil
lard then placed a small tube next to the
vesicle and applied an electric current to
push the vesicle into the tube.
Once in the tube, the two could spill
the vesicle's guts and observe the con
tents. By adding a dye which binds to cer
tain classes of molecules within the vesi

cle. the two could label chemicals of
interest. Liu and Lillard used techniques
that further separated the labeled
molecules by the speed at which they
moved through a matrix.
In collaboration with Owe Orwar. a
chemist at Chalmers University, and
Chemistry Prof. Evan Williams of UC-
Berkeley, Zare's group identified each of
the dve-labeled constituents of the vesic
ular milieu.
Results from the study suggest that
even among vesicles collected from with
in a single gland, contents vary. "One
vesicle would have one component, but it
would be completely absent from anoth
er vesicle." Lillard said. "We knew that
in a population, both components were
present, but when we got down to the
level of a single vesicle, there were clear
differences."
Eventually. Zare and colleagues hope
to adapt their technique to analyze small
er vesicles, such as those in the brain,
individually. "I think we are showing the
way. developing it step by step, so that
we can apply this to smaller systems and,
indeed, learn about the chemical basis of
thought." Zare said.
