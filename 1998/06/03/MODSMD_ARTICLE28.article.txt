# Solar flares touch off 'sunquakes'

Quakes great and small regularly rock our corner of
the universe, hut we don't feel the grandest of them.
That's because some of the solar system's most violent
seismic events shake the sun. A recent study suggests that
solar flares spawn solar quakes that resemble earth
quakes.
Solar flares are jets of hot gaseous material tossed
thousands of miles above the solar surface. Previous
attempts to find evidence that solar flares cause tremors
have been unsuccessful. However, in a study published in
the journal Nature. Dr. Alexander Kosovichev. a Stan
ford research scientist, and Dr. Valentina Zharkova of
Glasgow University provide the first such proof of solar
seismic activity.
Using data collected by the Michelson Doppler
Imager on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observato
ry (SOHO), the research team looked for signs of a
quake immediately following the eruption of a moder
ately-sized solar flare on July 19%.
The magnitude of the solar quake observed by Koso
vichev's team resists comparison with quakes on our
planet. Scientists estimate that a terrestrial tremor of
equal size would measure 11.3 on the Richter scale,
releasing roughly 40,1)00 tunes more energy than the infa
mous San Francisco Earthquake of l^Kv
"Although the flare was a moderate one. it still

released an immense amount of energy." said Dr. Craig
Deforest, a researcher working on the SOHO project.
"The energy released is equal to completely covering the
Earth's continents with a yard of dynamite and detonat
ing it all at once."
The quake produced ripples on the relatively fluid
surface of the sun. visible on radar as concentric nngs.
Radiating outward at speeds of up to 250.1 XX) miler per
hour, the waves traversed a distance equal to 10 Earth

diameters before they dissipated.
Kosoviehev and Zh ark ova succeeded where withers
had failed because they looked in the right place. An
exploding solar flare releases high-energy electrons that
travel down a magnetic flux tube, in the process releasing
X-rays, microwaves and a sfuK'k wave. These electrons
buffet the surface of the sun and that heat it up Koso

vichev and Zharkova developed a theory describing the
form and location of the quake such a flare would trigger.
Armed with their predictions, the two knew where and
what to look for.
The seismic waves on the sun strongly resemble earth
quake compression, or "p" waves. If solar compression
waves behave like their terrestrial counterparts, theory
predicts that a replica of the original quake should
appear directly opposite the original one. Kosovichev

said.
One of the surprising findings of
their study was the intensity of the
tremors — 10 times Kosovichev's
expectations. "They were so strong
that you can see them in the raw
data." Kosovichev says.
Researchers hope to use their new
found knowledge about solar quakes
to further investigate and understand
the sun. Just as earthquakes give clues
to geologists about the structure and
composition of the earth's crust and

interior, researchers aim to use solar quakes to probe the
features of the sun's interior.
Researchers hope solar quakes can provide informa
tion about the solar flares that generate them. That
knowledge could aid in predicting solar flare activity.
