# Saga of a playwright
## 
### James Buxbaum 
Faced with the challenge of writ
ing her first commissioned play,
Stanford Drama Lecturer Amy
Freed sat down in front of two com
puter screens and simultaneously
wrote two plays.
The play that she expected to
send to the South Coast Repertory
Theater appeared on one screen
while her "release" play was on the
other.
In the end, however, Freed sub
mitted not the "respectable" play
but the "emotional play that want
ed to be written," she said.
Because she felt that way about
her work, her response to the an
nouncement that she was one of
three finalists for the 1998 Pulitzer
Prize for drama was not what might
have been expected.
"It was really a feeling of relief
rather than exuberance that a play
so alarming to me was sanctioned
with something as prestigious as the
Pulitzer Prize nomination," she
said.
Her prize-nominated play,
"Freedomland," focuses on a tu
multuous New England family in
which three adult but not indepen
dent children blame their aging fa
ther for their problems.
The Pulitzer Prize in drama this
year went to playwright Paula
Vogel for her piece, "How I
Learned to Drive." The third final
ist was Richard Greenberg for his
"Three Days of Rain."
Surprisingly, "Freedomland"
was Freed's first commissioned
piece. She said getting a commis
sion — which means that the com
pany pays for the piece in advance
— "was a great stepping stone."
Although unexpected, the
Pulitzer nomination was greeted by
her family, her students and the
Stanford drama faculty with great
excitement.
Freed teaches several acting
classes in the Drama Department.
Prior to becoming a playwright, she

worked as an actress for 20 years in
New York and on the West Coast.
She is popular among her stu
dents for bringing this real-world
experience to her classes while si
multaneously encouraging the be
ginners in her class.

'Her course was by far my
favorite class of the year.'
— Eric Toscano

Senior Clinton Starghill said
Freed's "Fundamentals of Acting"
class "was my first acting class, and
Amy was really supportive. She
nurtured the people who had no
formal training and thereby en
couraged people to explore new
areas."
Junior Eric Toscano added.

"Amy brings professional experi
ence to amateur students and did
an outstanding job. Her course was
by far my favorite class of the year."
A two-time Freed student,
sophomore David Teng, called the
lecturer "wonderful. She embodies
the direction that the Drama De
partment should go in."
Freed began her career as a play
wright with a one-woman show
written for her graduate thesis at
the American Conservatory The
ater. Her play, "The Psychic Life of
Savages," is currently playing in
Philadelphia and will open in New
York and Washington next year.
Freed is writing another com
missioned play for the South Coast
Repertory Theater and said she
looks forward to teaching acting
courses at Stanford next year.
