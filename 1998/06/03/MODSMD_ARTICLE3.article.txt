# Eight sluggers drafted
## Austin tops teammates as first-round choice 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
At 9 a.m. yesterday, junior Jeff
Austin raced off to his Spanish class.
At 9:50, he raced back to teammate
Tony Schrager's room to an Internet
connection and a computer speaker.
At 10:30, Baseball America's Na
tional Player of the Year was drafted
in the first round, fourth overall, by
the Kansas City Royals.
Throughout the day, several
other Cardinal baseball players
would join him in the draft.
"I'm awfully excited," Austin
said. "I'm not looking to have a long
negotiation [period] at all. I'm just
looking to get my career rolling."
The contract negotiation proba
bly won't seem half as long as the
waiting period prior to Austin's se
lection. With a delay in the draft,
Stanford's ace was forced to wait
and listen to elevator music.
"I was saying, 'Come on, let's
go!"' he said of the delay, which was
due to the tardiness of the San Diego
Padres. "We were waiting a little bit,
and then they threw the elevator

music back on."
The draft finally began after a 20-
minute delay. Four picks later,
Austin was selected.
"Everybody started screaming
and yelling and jumping on me," he
said. "It was a great time."
Drafted out of high school by the
Montreal Expos in the 10th round,
Austin seemed ecstatic about the
turn of events in the last few years of
his life.
Going 12-4 this past season and
fourth on the Cardinal's all-time
strikeout list with 317 in his career,
there is not much doubt that the
right-handed pitcher made the right
decision in playing college baseball.
"It's helped me grow and allowed
me to be a kid a little bit longer," he
said. "The people I met here have
taught me so much. That's the most
invaluable experience I could have."
Fellow junior pitcher Chad
Hutchinson was selected by the St.
Louis Cardinals with the 48th pick
overall, in the second round. Draft
ed in the first round out of high
school. Hutchinson probably re
ceived the lower pick due to the

question of
whether he plans
to pursue a career

in football or baseball.
Also selected in the second
round was junior center fielder Jody
Gerut.
Gerut. taken in the second round
by the Colorado Rockies, believes
he will most likely be sent to a minor
league organization in Portland to
begin his trek to the majors.
"I'm pleased," Gerut said. "Col
orado is a great organization. They
have veterans in the outfield, which
bodes well for me."
Pitcher Brent Hoard went to the
Minnesota Twins in the third round,
while second baseman Tony
Schrager was selected by the Cubs in
the sixth.
"I'm excited to start playing,"
Schrager said. "I had a good idea
that they might draft me, [but] it's al
ways a thrill."
While former walk-on shortstop
Jay Pecci was selected by the Oak
land Athletics in the 11th round.
