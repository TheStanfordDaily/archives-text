# Solar car team chases rays in Afterburner II
## 
### Sage Cooke Contributing writer 
The sun shines brilliantly from
above, powering the 600-pound Af
terburner II with the solar cells that
coat its surface. The driver crouches
in the small space behind the wheel
as the car's progress — its voltage
and speed — are relayed back to a
computer in the chase car.
This solar-powered car can reach
a maximum speed of 76 miles per
hour, but the driver must hold back
— there is a hill approaching and
there could be cloudy weather
ahead — he must conserve the car's
energy.
Afterburner II is the latest cre
ation of the Stanford Solar Car Pro
ject, in conjunction with Calsol, the
UC-Berkeley solar car project.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley joined
projects in 1995, when they both
wanted to race in Australia in 1996.
However, each team lacked there

sources and money to accomplish
this goal alone. Their newest car was
built for racing other solar cars in
both national and international
competitions.
Team leader Joshua Newth, a
sophomore, enjoys the unique
learning experience of designing
and building a solar car.
"It is romantic to build a car that
runs off of the sun," he said.
A solar car is powered complete
ly by the energy of the sun. This en
ergy may be harnassed and stored in
batteries which become fully
charged after about five hours of
solar charging. On a sunny day, the
car can travel at 45 mph without any
battery power.
The car is constructed of, among
other things, a kevlar shell lined
with solar panels. Beneath this shell
is a chassis of carbon fiber that has
been bent to form the car's frame. It
is built like a tricycle with two
wheels in the front and one in the

hack. The small Michelin tires arc
miniature versions of Kawasaki mo
torcycle wheels, except that they
have been made especially for solar
car racing.
Like a normal car, it is equipped
with brakes. However, the car also
has an extra "electric brake," which
slows down the car and uses the
motor like a generator as it puts en
ergy back into the batteries with
high efficiency.
Bicycle shocks act as the car's
suspension.
"It feels like driving an old
Honda Accord. It is zippy but un
comfortable," said Brandon
Stafford, a doctoral student in math
ematics working on the car.
The project has several sponsors
including Boeing, a company that
constructs airplanes, and Hexcel,
another company that constructs
airplane wings. Both companies
often donate materials that are vital
to the car's construction such as

kevlar, carbon fiber and molds.
Sponsors for individual projects are
usually large companies in either
the aerospace or defense industries.
Afterburner ll's latest success
came about in Sunrayce '97, an in
tercollegiate competition of solar
cars. The team placed third, behind
Cal State Los Angeles and MIT.
Despite the success, the team
hopes to build a new and faster car.
The future car would feature a new
carbon fiber frame, which is current
ly being constructed by Hexcel in
Arizona. It would also feature an
improved suspension and a more
aerodynamic bubble to shield the
driver. The team also wants to add a
fourth wheel to the back, since new
regulations are requiring four
wheeled vehicles. With this addi
tion, the team could place a second
person in the vehicle during a race
and would be allowed to increase
their solar panels from 8 to 12
square yards.

The team hopes to race the new
car in the Sunrayce in 1999, which
will run from Washington, D.C. to
Florida. They also plan to race in the
Australia competition in the fall of
1999.
The Stanford constituency of the
project currently has only five active
members and is seeking more.
These members include Stafford,
Newth and doctoral student Dorian
West. This small number could im
pede the team's progress and suc
cess.
According to Stafford, the key to
a successful race depends on the
strategy and organization of the
team and the reliability of the car.
even if it is not technologically
supreme. The Sunburner, Stan
ford's first solar car. was not techno
logically perfect. Stafford said, but it
had a very efficient team and placed
14th in Australia's international
competition.
Since the project requires a large

personal commitment, many stu
dents are attracted to the team.
"They get something [out of the
project] that they don't get else
where," Stafford said. "These stu
dents get real life experience of en
gineering. When they make a de
signing mistake, they are not penal
ized by losing points, like on a
midterm, but the entire car may be
ruined. Thus, the consequences of a
mistake have a much larger effect
on the individual."
The project itself includes more
than just engineering knowledge.
Aerodynamics and weather predic
tion are also important aspects of
solar car racing. The car needs ad
vanced aerodynamics in order to
travel fast. Since the car derives its
energy from the sun. the team must
also consider the weather in their
racing strategy. If there is a chance
that it may become cloudy, the dri
ver must decelerate in order to pre
serve energv.
