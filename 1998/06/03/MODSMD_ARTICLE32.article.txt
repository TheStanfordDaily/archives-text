The Stanford Center for Re
search on Economic Development
and Policy Reform is up and run
ning. Provost Condoleezza Rice
and Dean of Research and Gradu
ate Policy Charles Kruger an
nounced the creation of the center
in January 1997.
Economics Prof. Anne Krueger
heads the center, which at the time
of its announcement, she said
would help support research on
how to improve the economic sys
tems of developing countries and
nations such as Russia that are in
transition from centrally planned
systems to competitive market
economies.
"We've learned quite a bit
about this issue, but there's always
more to know." Krueger said.
She added that she hopes the
center will house the finest collec
tion in the nation of scholars of
economic development in the near
future.
There are students and faculty
from the economics and political
science departments already in
volved with the center.
The center has also hosted pro
grams such as a discussion on India
and a visit by the head of the Mex
ican Central Bank.
Eight to 12 fellows will be ap
pointed to the center, although
none have been yet.
"There's nothing that's final
and definite." Krueger said.
The center is funded in part by
the endowments that were previ
ously used by the Food Research
Institute, a unit that University ad
ministrators and the Board of

Trustees decided in 1996 to close
by this summer.
In recent years. FRI has focused
its research on agriculture in devel
oping countries, an area on which
Krueger said the new center would
also focus.
The study of agriculture is nec
essary in understanding the
economies of developing countries
because many such nations bast
their economic existence on farm
ing, she said.
However, the center did not
plan nor has it assumed any profes
sors or graduate students who will
lose their positions when FRI clos
es.
Some faculty and graduate stu
dents did move to the economics
department.
According to FRI Director Jef
frey Williams, a consulting profes
sor here and a full-time faculty
member at UC-Davis, at least a
few senior faculty members from
FRI have asked to join the center.
However. Williams said, these
people have been met with refusal.
Krueger said she knew of only
one such faculty member, and dif
ferences in research interests were
the reason for the member not
joining the center.
Marcel Fafchamp. an assistant
professor who made the move
from FRI to the Economics De
partment. said he has been a facul
ty fellow at the center since last fall.
He receives invitations to partic
ipate in the activities of the center
such as seminars and conferences.
As for graduate students who
made the switch, most are too early
in their studies to yet have much in
volvement with the center.
