# New organization seeks to increase awareness of issues
## Political group forming 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Contributing writer 
An organization designed to in
crease political awareness on campus
is currently being discussed and de
veloped by a group of students,
though it is still in the early stages.
The organization is tentatively
called either the Stanford Public Ac
tion Group or the Stanford Issues
Awareness Union. It will likely be a
public forum where students can dis
cuss political issues and a variety of
other concerns, including ones of so
cial. environmental and philosophi
cal importance.
Students who are involved in its
development liken the organization
to the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, except that instead of providing
resources for community service or
ganizations, it would aid political and
issue-oriented groups on campus.
Defined by its members as an um
brella group, the organization is not
expected to have any political affilia
tions itself. Instead, it will serve as a
neutral medium through which dif
ferent groups can communicate and
plan events together.
"Right now, [organizing joint po
litical events] is difficult because most
political groups on campus do not
have any formal channels of commu
nication amongst each other," said

junior Erik Benson, one of the
group's coordinators. "Events are al
ways planned separately. Our orga
nization hopes to alleviate this prob
lem."
The need for such an organization
on campus is a pressing one, the
group insists. Students cite not only
political apathy as a reason for its ex
istence, but also the lack of a unifying,
service-providing body â€” something
that other universities have.
"Other institutions have compa
rable organizations. For example,
Harvard has the Institute of Politics."
said sophomore Matt Spence. "I
think one of the reasons for political
apathy on this campus may be that
people don't know how to get in
volved, even if they want to. Such a
group could provide guidance and in
crease political awareness."
Although most members have
been thinking about creating such an
organization they were freshmen, it
was not until early this year that in
terested students convened to discuss
the possibility of forming the organi
zation.
Benson said he hopes the organi
zation will be "able to draw in speak
ers from all over the world, [supple
menting] the typical Stanford educa
tion with exposure to ... people like
the director of the World Bank and
the Secretary of State."

"One idea is to facilitate several
issue debates and forums on a grand
scale for the purpose of better in
forming the campus and stimulating
discussion among students," said ju
nior Adam Weiss.
Members feel the organization
would add to the atmosphere on
campus and provide important ser
vices for students. "[An organization
like this one] helps to define a univer
sity, since it gives it a social and polit
ical backbone," said junior Erik
Campano.
The group's most immediate goal
is to create a booklet that would give
descriptions of the political organiza
tions on campus, something they are
asking leaders of political groups to
provide. In the future, members fore
see staging events that "a large seg
ment of the student populous would
be excited about," according to Benson.
As for obtaining a physical space
in which to meet, the coordinators
feel they may need to initially hold
meetings in dormitories or class
rooms, before an actual place can be
found for the center.
The end goal is to acquire a dedi
cated building like the Haas Center.
The students involved anticipate
using next year to sort through logis
tical, legal and funding problems.
They hope to receive funding
through ASSU special fees or a grant.
