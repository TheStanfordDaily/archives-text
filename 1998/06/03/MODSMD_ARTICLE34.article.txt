# USHC nurses may strike
## 
### Lauren Phillips Staff writer 
After nearly two months of ne
gotiation with UCSF-Stanford
Health Care, the union of nurses at
the Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Salter Paekard Children's Hospital
has announced plans to strike.
The strike is planned for June 11
at 7 a.m. if a compromise is not met
on wage negotiations for nurses af
filiated with the union.
The Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement, a local
nurses union established in 1974,
has voted to strike because its de
mands for pay increases to accom
modate the area's skyrocketing
cost of living have not been met.
The original contract offered a 1
percent salary increase for the
nurses over the next two years.
"The hospital has a monopoly in
the area on what they decide to pay
their employees," said Donalda
Dunnett, executive vice president
of CRONA. "It's not politically
correct to give us a cost-of-living
increase because then the hospital
would have to give all of their other
employees the increase they've
been denied as well."
But USHC says it is working as
hard as possible to come to an
agreement.
"We're committed to doing
everything in our power to reach a

rapid and fair resolution with our
nurses," said Felix Barthelemy, se
nior vice president of human re
sources, in a USHC press release.
"And we are hopeful that we can
reach an agreement before the
strike deadline."
Both sides are still engaged in
negotiations, and no formal pro
posals are being made at this point.
According to Barthelemy, the
groups are currently looking to see
where they can compromise so that
a strike can be avoided. A federal
mediator has been involved in the
negotiations since May 28.
The CRONA nurses union —
the only unionized group in the
Stanford Hospital — voted on
Monday to strike. The union has
1,700 members; 1,410 of whom
voted in favor of the strike, Dun
nett said.
The demands could prompt
other hospital employees to ask for
larger cost-of-living increases.
"We have to look at treating all
of our employees equitably,"
Barthelemy said. "Nurses are ex
tremely valuable to our institution,
but all of our staff is. We try to pay
all of our staff competitive salaries
that are representative of the mar
ket."
The hospital has been experi
encing a nursing shortage over the
past six months, a problem Dun
nett attributed to the expensive liv

ing costs in the Bay Area. This
shortage has placed pressure on
the nurses already employed by the
hospital.
"Nurses have been having to
work overtime," Dunnett said.
"This is putting patients in dan
ger."
Dunnett said nurses have been
forced to work back-to-back shifts
of more than 12 hours, which cre
ates hazards for the nurses' person
al health and the health of the pa
tients.
Should USHC fail to suggest an
acceptable wage increase to
CRONA before June 11, patients
will have to be moved to other fa
cilities, according to USHC
spokesman Daniel Burman.
CRONA has agreed to provide
nurses for those patients who can
not be moved but expects other
hospital staff to cover before these
nurses are brought in.
Contingency committees are
currently being formed by the hos
pital to analyze the best ways in
which to move the patients should
that become necessary. Restric
tions on new admissions are also in
effect.
"As always, our number one
priority is ensuring the safety and
care of patients," Barthelemy said.
"And we are making all necessary
preparations to minimize the im
pact on the people under our care."
