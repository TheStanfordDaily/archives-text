# Move-out deadline concerns students
## 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Stanford has turned into stress city as
Dead Week nears its end. The countdown is
on with only six more days remaining for the
school year. In addition to studying for fi
nals, students must move out soon after.
Junior Danielle Rees, a resident assistant
in Branner Hall, disapproves of the system.
"I think it sucks and adds unnecessary
stress to finals and the end of the year. It's
impossible to get closure, to say goodbye to
friends, pack up all your stuff and focus on
finals all at the same time," she said.
Students must also determine where and
with whom to store their belongings. For
those who can fit everything into four boxes,
this problem is not so complex. However,
for those who have one to three years worth
of accumulation, this could be a bit of a
problem.
Students who have couches, futons,
books and then other boxes of belongings
must figure out where it's going and how it's
getting there.
Under these circumstances, some worry
the opportunity for academic success may
be compromised.
"The e-mails warning about deadlines
are intense, as they say you'll be charged
$1(X) a night, and it's just not at the front of
my mind," said sophomore Ingrid Loreen.
Loreen refers to e-mail messages sent to
students stating that all students must move
out by noon next Thursday so the Universi
ty can clean the facilities in preparation for
summer conferences.
According to Carol Leynse, manager of
summer conferences, almost 85 percent of
Stanford housing is used by the conference
program. The other 15 percent includes Flo
rence Moore Hall and Mirrielees — which
house students — and anything that will be
renovated under the Capital Improvement
Plan.
The conference program is important to

the University because it pulls in over $6
million worth of Housing and Dining Ser
vices revenue, which goes directly into the
Housing and Dining budget.
"We rely heavily on this income to subsi
dize student rent rates," said Diana Conklin,
manager of undergraduate residence facili
ties.
"Couldn't they push up finals one more
day or push back the conferences?" Loreen
said in response to this information. "There
must be some compromise. Even just one
day would make such a difference in peo
ple's stress levels."
Junior Jon Wells agreed with Loreen. "1
think an extra day to move out would be ex
tremely helpful, especially for people who
have finals on the last day. I wouldn't have
to worry about everything at the same
time."
Conklin recognized that pushing back
the start of the conference program would
be less stressful for everyone, including fa
cilities staff, but she supports the goals of the
conference to decrease student housing
costs.
Plus, conferences pushed back one day
would amount to roughly a $77.(XX) loss in
revenue. Leynse estimated that a one-time
13 percent raise in student rent rates would
occur if the conference program was entire
ly eliminated.
Stanford must struggle to accommodate
conferences because the school year ends so
late as it is, according to Leynse.
"The official opening day of conferences
is June 21. Theoretically, we have a week to
clean and repair damages, but some confer
ences come as early as June 15."
She also pointed out that unlike other
schools that close buildings for a semester,
Stanford carries out the Capital Improve
ment Flan in nine weeks over the summer.
"This is another source of stress," she said,
"but for very important reasons. We can't
afford to do without housing [during the
school year]."
