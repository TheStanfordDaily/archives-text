# ASSU senators gear up for year
## 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
The two senates that met back-to-back
last night at the Law School shared some
Domino's pizza, beer and soda but not a
whole lot else.
The second and third senates — this
year's and next year's — are in distinctly
different places at this point in the year.
The second senate dissolved last night as
the third met for the second time.
The second, which has struggled — and
sometimes failed — to make quorum, was
ready to throw in the towel last night. The
atmosphere at its meeting was rushed and
unemotional, and ves. th - meeting was ini
tially delayed 20 minutes for lack of quo
rum.
The third senate appear? energetic and
optimistic for the new year. The new un
dergraduate senators were assigned to res
identially based districts last week, and the
senate committees met for the first time
last night.
So what happens during the time peri
od between the honest excitement of a
fresh start and the unabashed exhaustion
of dissolution?
For this year's senate the answers are
varied. Many of last year's senators feel
the year laid the groundwork for a
stronger ASSU for next year and vears to

come.
While the 1996-97 senate was known
for constant bickering and drawn-out
meetings, this year's brought more coop
eration and consensus.
"This year's senate ended the appear
ance of the senate being divided against it
self," said this year's ASSU Vice President
Ben Decker.
"Last year's senate was caught up in bu
reaucracy," sophomore senator Matt Pol
son said. "I really think people came into
the senate (this year) to get things done."
And the senate did accomplish some
things.
This year featured the publishing of the
first ASSU Course Guide and Draw
Guide, two projects that had been in the
works in the senate for many years.
The Dorm Outreach program — where
students are able to meet with prominent
administrators during dinner in their resi
dences — was implemented for the first
time this year. The program set a founda
tion for increased communication among
students and the administration.
Although the senate was more cooper
ative this year, it still did not act unified,
some senators feel.
"There were a lot of individual efforts,"
Poison said.
Adam Weiss, a sophomore senator this
vear w ho last week was elected chair of the

new senate, agreed.
"There were many individuals in the
senate who did a lot on their own." he said.
"As a senate, we lacked the unity to get
any big business through."
"I'm looking forward to more unity and
commitment across the board." he said,
previewing next year's senate.
New ASSU President and Vice Presi
dent Maren Norton and Santos Marro
quin have jump-started the new senate by
handing out copies of the ASSU Constitu
tion and the senate bylaws, as well as en
couraging senators to get involved in
events such as last week's graduate hous
ing rally.
This senate will be the first to have un
dergraduate senators representing specif
ic residences and campus groups as con
stituencies. This year's senate passed a bill
to create the new districting system.
Time will tell if the energy of the new
senate will carry over to next year. Former
senator Nlarroquin responded to the fre
quent criticism of the ASSU and its sen
ate.
"People like to say that the ASSU does
nothing. People expect things with big
names," he said.
"The behind-the-scenes stuff should be
recognized." he said. "The funding of stu
dent groups is one of the biggest accom
plishments of the ASSU."
