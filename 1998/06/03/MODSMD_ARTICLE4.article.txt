# Econ prof wins 'genius' grant

Greif is facing a serious dilemma,
but he's not at all upset about it.
His problem is figuring out what
to do with the $265,(XX) no-strings
attached grant he earned as the re
cipient of one of this year's
Mac Arthur fellowships.
Greif is an economic historian
whose research is notable for its use
of game theory. He is one of 29
achievers from all walks of life who
will receive unrestricted grants be
tween $220,000 and $375,(XX) to fur
ther their work in fields ranging from
the arts to law to cattle ranching.
The fellowships are given out by
the John D. and Catherine T.
Mac Arthur Foundation based on
the recommendations of anony
mous nominators or "talent scouts."
The purpose of the award is to rec
ognize and cultivate creative work
by exceptionally talented people in a

wide range of fields.
As he only learned about the
award last Thursday, Greif and his
family have yet to come up with def
inite plans for how to spend the
money. Greif said he was consider
ing putting the money toward travel
to meet fellow scholars and make
use of resources unavailable at Stan
ford.
Although he doesn't have defi
nite plans yet, Greif is confident that
the grant, which comes in the form of
a stipend paid out over five years,
will give a boost to his research.
"Such a vote of recognition defi
nitely boosts one's morale and en
courages one to continue in the line
of research," he said.
Greif, 42, is an Israeli citizen and
has been on the Stanford faculty
since 198V). His main concentration is
economic history, to which he ap
plies models based on game theory
that he defines as "a mathematical
theory for analyzing decision-mak
ing in strategic situations."

He said his work aims to apply
broader historical and cultural
analysis to specific economic con
texts.
"In order to understand the
workings of any economy, you have
to understand the details of the insti
tutions that underlie that exchange,"
Greif explained.
One application he cited was the
research he began as a graduate stu
dent at the University of Tel Aviv
and continued at Northwestern Uni
versity.
The work began with the
Maghrebi traders, merchants who
worked in Islamic-controlled areas
of the Mediterranean during the late
Middle Ages and left extensive
records of their trading practices.
Greif applied game theoretical mod
els first to their institutions and then
to those of the Genoese traders who
dominated the Mediterranean re
gion during a slightly later era.
