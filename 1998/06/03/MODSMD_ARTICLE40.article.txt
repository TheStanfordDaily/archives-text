## 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate approved the ASSIJ
operating budget for the 1998-99 financial
year last night in a quick, unsentimental
final meeting of the second senate.
The senate then passed the torch to the
third senate, which met for the second time
immediately after its predecessors complet
ed their agenda.
Former ASSU President Emily Andrus
told the senate she hopes "everyone is
proud of the work they've done."
Although many items on the ASSU's
budget were not changed from last year's
amounts, there were some significant addi
tions and adjustments.
"We were in the very good situation of
deciding what to do with some extra
money," former Financial Manager Don
Coleman said.
The ASSU endowment — the source of
the operating funds detailed in the budget
— increased from $139,000 to $163,000 dur
ing the 1997-98 financial year.
Coleman attributed the favorable in
crease to a fantastic stock market as well as
a successful year for Stanford Student En
terprises, the business arm of the ASSU.
The Budget and Finance Committee
made use of the increased funds to increase

certain budget items as
well as to allocate money
to new items.
The budgets for the
president, senate and
Nominations Commis
sion all increased.
The senate set aside
money for a dinner held

every quarter by the Nominations Commis
sion that brings together members of the
ASSU and various University committees
to assess their progress.
The ASSU News, first published this
year, earned funding, as the senate also allo
cated money for housing for undergraduate
senators during the week before the start of
the next school year. The extra time will be
spent preparing the senate's new agenda.
I he budget for the Publications Board
was adjusted to create a capital budget in
tended to respond to the frequent pleas for
capital improvements within the organization.
"It creates a mechanism for intelligently
buying hardware over three years," Cole
man explained.
The salaries of the ASSU president
and vice president increased to $7,100
and $4,500, respectively. The payment of
the senate deputy chair was eliminated,
and a $2,000 salary for a senate secretary
was created.

Coleman also announced the purchase
of a new Haas Center for Public Service van
for next year. The vans — the newest will be
the third — are for student transportation to
off-campus public service activities.
Andrus was pleased by the budget in
creases. "Often the president's hands are
tied because of financial limitations," she
said.
Coleman reported that there were no
substantial changes to the SSE budget.
Undergraduate special and general fees
went down slightly, he said, while graduate
fees witnessed a slight increase.
Coleman stepped down as financial
manager last night as the senate approved
senior Matt Garlinghouse as the new finan
cial manager. Garlinghouse has been serv
ing as associate financial manager for sever
al weeks.
In other senate business, the senate an
nounced Asst. English Prof. Jocelyn Marsh
won its annual teaching award.
"During the whole year, this is the pro
fessor's name who came up the most," An
drus said. "She had a sincere interest in
guiding students."
Marsh was denied tenure by the deans of
the School of Humanities and Sciences ear
lier this year and will be leaving Stanford for
a tenured position at another university,
Andrus said.
