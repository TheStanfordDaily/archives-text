■ May 31: Sophomore Bob Bryan wins the
NCAA Championships individual title, defeat
ing senior Paul Goldstein 6-3.6-2.
■ Sunday's result: Bryan / Bryan win the
NCAA Championships doubles title, defeating
Pepperdine's Kelly Gullett and Robert Liiulst
edt 6-7,6-2,6-4.

In addition to helping Stanford capture
the team tile. Bryan won the doubles cham
pionship with twin brother Mike and the sin
gles championship in Athens.
After four days of grueling team competi
tion — consisting of a doubles pro set and
singles match daily — three Stanford players
geared up for third-round individual compe
tition in 90-degree heat with 90 percent hu
midity.
The Brvans. senior Paul Goldstein and ju
nior Ryan Wolters were all seeded in singles
and doubles competition, making Stanford
the only participating school to enter four
singles players and two doubles teams — a

testament to the depth of the Cardinal line
up.
In the third round, however, it was
Wolters who hit a stumbling block against
Georgia's John Roddick, who had given
Goldstein a run lor his money in the team
competition.
"Ryan played a good match against a red
hot John Roddick," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "It was a good, competi
tive match."
Roddick took Wolters out of the running
in a two-set defeat, 6-4,6-4, while teammates
Bryan and Goldstein battled on through to
the quarterfinal, semifinal and champi
onship rounds.
And a battle it was. In the third round and
in the quarterfinals, Bryan had to go to ei
ther a tiebreak or at least seven games to win
his match.
Goldstein had an even more difficult
path. Playing such long singles matches as
well as having to play doubles matches in the
Georgia heat finally got to him.
After his quarterfinal match with Missis
sippi State's Thomas Dupre, Goldstein was
forced to make a trip to the hospital to re
ceive intravenous fluids.
"I was not feeling well after the three
hour match." Goldstein said. "I went to the
hospital and got an IV between matches. I
was winded, and the fluids certainly helped

Sophomore Bob Bryan entered an exclusive club of Stanford tennis players Sunday when he won both the singles and.
doubles titles at the NCAA tournament in Athens, Ga. He is the second player since 1977 to win the tennis "triple crown'',
for singles, doubles and team championships. •'
me.
"This week has been emotion
ally and physically exhausting," he
added. "Emotionally, you put
heart and soul into the team com
petition, which ended on Tuesday,
and it is hard to adjust to focusing
on yourself and the individual
competition."
In the final matchup, team
mates Bob Bryan and Goldstein
faced each other for the title. Their
semifinal matches had been de
layed by rain, meaning the cham
pionship match immediately fol
lowed their continuation on Sun
day.
Bryan defeated Roddick in two
sets 6-3,6-4, and Goldstein battled
it out with Virginia Common
wealth's Daniel Andersson 3-6, 6-
2,6-2.

In the end, Bryan never gave
Goldstein a lighting chance, win
ning 6-3,6-2 over his team captain.
"I was definitely on top of my
game," Bryan said. "I played 19
matches in eight days. You have to
be on top of your game to be able
to do that. I was playing at 150 per
cent. I felt like I could beat anyone
on that day."
Goldstein expressed his admi
ration for Bryan's play.
"Bob has played outstanding
tennis all week," Goldstein said.
"He kept me off balance today. 1
have to give him a lot of credit — it
is not easy to play a teammate, and
Bob's focus and positive energy
today was that of a champion."
Gould, meanwhile, couldn't
have been happier that the play re
sulted in an all-Stanford final.
"Paul did a great job to get the
finals," Gould said. "He just didn't
have that extra spark to pull him
through. Bob didn't let him. [Bob]
was just like the Rock of Gibraltar
today. It was a pretty good final
considering everything."
In the doubles competition,
Stanford fared just as well. Gold
stein and Wolters made it all the
way to the quarterfinals before
they were defeated by Pepper
dine's Kelly Gullett and Robert
Lindstedt 6-4, 6-4.
They "kind of hit the wall,"
. Gould said. "They ran into a good
team, and they just didn't have
that extra spark to carry them
over."

Bob Bryan called singles "just
♦icing on the cake" compared to
with his brother. "Really,
I- mv focus was on doubles the entire

week," he said.
Players who win NCAA indi
vidual championships have their
pictures placed on a wall in the
playing room in Stanford's Taube
Family Tennis Center, and Bob
Bryan said that was one motiva
tion for winning both the singles
and doubles.
"I wanted my picture on the
wall in the playing room," he said.
"1 know my brother wanted a pic
ture up there, too, and I was play
ing for him to get that. We were
both fired up for doubles. It's a
dream come true.
"I want to tip my hat to my
brother," he said.
"He had a tough week in sin
gles, and he really bounced back in
doubles. I think he really carried
me in doubles."
Assistant coach John
Whitlinger was out on the courts
the entire time at Georgia, reliv
ing two other Stanford triple
crown victories: by Alex O'Brien
in 1992 and by Whitlinger himself
in 1974.
"This is unbelievable," Bob
Bryan said. "The Stanford history
is amazing, and to think that my
name is up there with some of the
others is just unbelievable."
Bryan said he tried to follow
Whitlinger's lead.
"The momentum from the
team win and the first day of sin
gles really carried me through the
tournament," he said. "It was an
unbelievable cap to a record-set
ting year. It still hasn't sunken in
yet."
Gould was equally enthusiastic.
"It could not have been a better
year," the coach said. "A season
like this will never happen again.
Stanford should be very proud of
them."
