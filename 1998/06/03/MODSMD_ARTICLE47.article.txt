■ May 31: Sophomore Bob Bryan wins the
NCAA Championships individual title, defeat
ing senior Paul Goldstein 6-3.6-2.
■ Sunday's result: Bryan / Bryan win the
NCAA Championships doubles title, defeating
Pepperdine's Kelly Gullett and Robert Liiulst
edt 6-7,6-2,6-4.

In addition to helping Stanford capture
the team tile. Bryan won the doubles cham
pionship with twin brother Mike and the sin
gles championship in Athens.
After four days of grueling team competi

Georgia's John Roddick, who had given
Goldstein a run lor his money in the team
competition.
"Ryan played a good match against a red
