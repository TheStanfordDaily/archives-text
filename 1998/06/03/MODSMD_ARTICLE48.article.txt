# Tennis seniors just can't lose
## Goldstein and Hoeveler finish Stanford careers with a title a year 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
In a year of records, it could have faded
into the background as just another ac
complishment in the big lump of greatness
that is the Stanford men's tennis team.
But this record is definitely one for the
books. One other team has won four con
secutive NCAA championships, but no
individual player in collegiate tennis his
tory has ever before won four champi
onship rings.
Seniors Paul Goldstein and Charles
Hoeveler achieved that this year, winning
their fourth titles with the Cardinal last
week at the NCAA Championships in
Athens, Ga. ""* v i\»* W
Neither of the seniors was at Stanford
in the fall, each taking the quarter off to
improve his tennis on the professional cir
cuit. But both posted incredible records
upon rejoining their equally impressive
Cardinal teammates winter quarter.
Goldstein, the team captain and Pacif
ic 10 Conference Player of the Year, ro
tated in the top spots with junior Ryan
Wolters and sophomores Mike and Bob
Bryan. He teamed with Wolters for dou
bles.
Although he spent the second half of
last year in the sixth spot, Hoeveler only
competed in two singles dual matches this
year, devoting most of his time to doubles
with sophomore Geoff Abrams.
"I love playing doubles, and I think I'm
sometimes better at doubles than I am at
singles," Hoeveler said. "Coming into this
year, I knew we were going to have six in
credibly strong players. That's not to say
that I didn't want to play singles, but real
istically, 1 knew that my best shot would

be playing doubles.
"I would never trade my experience on
the tennis team for anything else."
Both Hoeveler and Goldstein attribute
much of the team's success to the coaching
style of head coach Dick Gould, the Pac
-10 Coach of the Year, and assistant coach
John Whitlinger.
"Given the year we had, I thought we
had a good chance to win, but coach
Gould wouldn't let us think of the histori
cal implications," Hoeveler said. "It was a
lot easier to focus on playing Minnesota,
then UCLA and Mississippi State and
Georgia and then worry about records
after winning the championship."

Goldstein agreed, saying Gould and
Whitlinger "don't let us get too far ahead
of ourselves."
Hoeveler said he thinks the team's
good chemistry is a result of coaching.
"We've really gotten along well," he
said. "We're all unselfish. I think that has
a lot to do with the way coaches Gould
and Whitlinger handle the team. We knew

we had the talent to win — the key was th£
chemistry this team had."
Although he calls the feeling of
ning "great" and "indescribable," Hq->
eveler admits that what has happened
during his four years on the Farm goes
yond anything he ever dreamed.
"It's not anything 1 planned," he said.*
"I just feel lucky to have such incredibly
teammates."
"It's incredible," Goldstein added.*
"There was no way coming in as a
man that I ever could have imagined thi£:
It's a great program to be a part of." !\
Hoeveler emphasized, though, that the
team experience wa s more important tharJ
the titles. '•
"It's flatly special hatj
had the same experience with the saiptj
guys, and we had only won two or three
championships instead of four, I woufd
still feel the same way," he said. "The iro*
portant thing is that I've had incrediblb
teammates, not the four rings."
Goldstein said he is thrilled his Stan
ford career ended with this season.
"To cap off my career with a season
like this is incredible," he said. "I thinly
anyone at Stanford and anyone in thi{
community can be proud of the way we
played this year. There's no better way tcj
end my senior year than to win against
Georgia in Georgia."
In trying to take the big prize, the team
supersedes the individual. Hoeveler added/
"The biggest thing about winning the
championships is that it's a total team efi
fort," he said. "Because it's an individual
sport, it's difficult to cultivate a team ef
fort in tennis. I feel incredibly lucky anij
blessed to be part of an incredible team
for the past four years."
