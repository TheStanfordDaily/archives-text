"After organic chemistry, 1 decided I
didn't want to struggle through 55 years of
medical school," he said. "I picked some
thing up [about the Peace Corps], and it
made a lot of sense. It seemed like a good
fit."
Tshionyi eventually wants to study ei

Third World countries develop primary
health facilities, and he's hoping that his ex
perience in Gabon will help him narrow his
goals.
The Peace Corps office set Tshionyi up
with Gabon based on his areas of expertise.
The senior speaks French (the country's of
ficial language), and his scientific back
ground transferred well into the public
health field.
Allowed to give input regarding his geo
graphic area of interest, Tshionyi chose
Africa because his father is from the De
mocratic Republic of Congo, which bor
ders Gabon to the east. Tshionyi still has
relatives in the area.
"Hopefully, I can hop over the Congo to
see my relatives, and I will definitely try to
find my cousin" in Gabon, Tshionyi said.

Heritage aside, Tshionyi's identity has
been shaped by his place on the Stanford
basketball team. This year, he played an in
tegral role in helping his team reach the
Final Four.
"Being part of the team has taught me to
budget my time, to stick to something." he
said. "And it has helped my interpersonal
relationships."
Tshionyi's experience at the Final Four
still brings a smile to his face.
"As a freshman, I had us winning the na
tional championship a couple of times, but
I quickly realized how hard it was even to
get into the tournament," he said. "It was a
perfect way to go out. I had no idea it was
such a big deal to everybody."
Tshionyi isn't worried about not having
his team's support and encouragement
while he lives in Africa.
"I'm hoping the Peace Corps group will
be my new basketball team." he said.
