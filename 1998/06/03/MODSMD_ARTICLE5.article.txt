# H&S still seeking dean
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Three months after the Univer
sity convened a committee to find a
new dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, the school has
yet to announce its choice.
The 15-member search commit
tee. chaired by Economics Prof.
John Taylor, gavt its list of recom
mendations to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice several weeks
ago, but the president and provost

are having a difficult time convinc
ing someone to take the job.
"It wasn't hard finding good
candidates," said Statistics Prof.
Brad Efron. a member of the
search committee.
"The hard part of the process is
convincing them to do it," Efron
said.
The committee submitted an
unranked list of five candidates, all
of whom are current Stanford pro
fessors.
"The top candidates don't want
to be deans in the first place and re

quire a lot of convincmg," said se
nior Bill Shen, a student member of
the committee. "We joke that as
soon as someone says they're inter
ested in the job. they're no longer a
candidate."
The committee finished its job
with the list of nominees: the job of
selecting the final choice falls to
Casper and Rice.
"It's out of our hands now,"
Efron said.
The new dean will replace John
Shoven, who finishes his five-year
term in August.
Shoven will remain at Stanford,
returning to his position as an eco
nomics professor.
"We do have a certain amount
of time to make this decision be
cause Shoven will be here through
the summer," Shen said. He added
that the University would like to
have a new dean in place as soon as
possible.

Five years ago, the University
announced Shoven's appointment
as dean in mid-May.
But this year, May has come and
gone with no announcement.
"It's so much to ask of a candi
date, to ask them to take five years
off their research and teaching,"
Shen said.
"These people are at the tops of
their fields.... To become a dean
is an honor, but it is also a great sac
rifice," he added.
Both the President's and
Provost's offices declined to com
ment on the state of the search.
