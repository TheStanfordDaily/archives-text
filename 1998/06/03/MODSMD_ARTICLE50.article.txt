# Long, strange trip
## New kid in sports tells of conversion 
### 
It wasn't what they expected.
Then again, I've never tried
particularly hard to do what
people "expect" of me.
Still, when 1 told my family that
in my latest incarnation of a Daily
employee I'd be covering men's
soccer — followed by a stint as
sports managing editor — more
than one jaw dropped.

See, I grew up in a house where,
although Monday Night Football
counted as acceptable television,
sports were not, shall we say, a pri
ority. I'd shown my rebellious
streak early on by joining the guys
to watch many a Super Bowl while
the women stayed far away. But at
that age, it was to prove to my dad
that I should be treated the same
as my brothers, not because I liked
sports.
We all had our soccer and gym
nastics, backyard baseball and
Lassie League as children. Those,
I think, my parents wrote off as
something necessary to drain en
ergy out of hyperactive 5-year
olds.
It was generally accepted that
once you got too busy with more
traditional intellectual pursuits,
sports fell by the wayside. My par
ents have attended every high
school football game for the past
10 years — but only because we've
all been in marching band.
I was happy without a favorite
sports team, preferring the solitary
athletic pursuits of my New Mexi

co homeland (mountain biking,
backpacking) to your everyday
game of pick-up basketball.
Then I came to Stanford,
where, as everyone knows, you
can't not be a sports fan. A few
days later, I dropped by The Daily,
an organization not traditionally
known for its athletic prowess.
Somewhere in the four years of
variations on penguin and chair
basketball teamed with iequired
readings of the sports page, I got
sucked in.
I know, my fellow Daily
staffers, you're laughing your ma
niacal laughs. I'll admit "sucked
in" is perhaps too mild of a term.
It's true, though, that I read
very little of the sports pages my
first two years at Stanford. I did
manage to watch a bit of March
Madness during spring break, a
move that shocked my parents to
no end. But these were mere
symptoms of a greater epidemic to
come.
The turning point is fairly obvi
ous: It was one fateful January
night when then-Editor in Chief
Beth Berselli decided to extend
her winter vacation by a day.
"You'll be fine, Elizabeth," she
told me. "Consider it practice for
when you take over my job in a
month."
Beth — normally a kind, good
hearted woman — neglected to
mention that my duties as substi
tute editor would include helping
the sports section put together a
two-page spread of stories and
photos highlighting the women's
volleyball team's successful quest
for the NCAA title.
So it was that we found our
selves in the office at 4 a.m. strug
gling to cram photos and headlines
into spaces that didn't fit. Two


Elizabeth
Goldman
hardcore members of The Daily's
sports department and an awkward
transplant who still hadn't grasped
why this was worth giving up her
sleep.
But Robin and Stoner taught me
a few things other than the concept
that layout rules aren't necessarily
important in the wee hours. I think it

was when we made the pact — that if
one of us got fired, we'd all quit (and
Beth couldn't fire us all) — that the
conversion set in.
And that was the end for me. 1
took up the men's soccer beat and
regretted having missed their play
for three years. I gave up my post-ed
itor in chief freedom to hang out
with Ben and Jen on Wednesdays as
a sports managing editor.
I spend as much time these days
refining my penguin hook shot as de

bating the tenure process with the
news editors. I've decided it's imper
ative to live in the Stanford area so
my children will be proper Cardinal
fans.
My parents, they still pass it off as
a phase. But as anyone in the sports
department will tell you. once you're
hooked, there's no turning back.

Elizabeth hopes none of her other
beloved Doily sections feel neglect
ed. She hasn t forgotten vou.
