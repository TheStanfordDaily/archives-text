# Soccer wraps up spring season
## 
### Brian Lee Senior staff writer 
Closing out the spring season
with a hit of a twist, the Stanford
women's soccer team faced a pair of
men's squads over the past two
weeks.
After dropping the first game 4-0
two Thursdays ago to the San Fran
cisco Seals under-16 team, the Car
dinal fell 3-0 last week to a visiting
squad from Bosnia. The losses,
however, did little to dampen the
team's spirits heading into the long
summer break.
"These last two were great learn
ing games for us," said junior goal
keeper Erin Bryla. " They showed
us a lot of what we need to do in the
fall. The whole spring went really
well, and we're really excited about
next year."
The temptation with male / fe
male direct competition has often
been to hype it as a battle of the
sexes. However, the focus for the
Cardinal was on the games and not
the gender of the opponents.
"We've played guys in the past,
so it wasn't a huge deal," Bryla said.
In the first game, the players got
all they expected and more as the
Seals youth team used a sizable
speed advantage to put up two
scores inside the first 10 minutes.
The Cardinal had no answering at
tack.
"We completely underestimated
their speed," Bryla said. "They were
very fast, and we didn't make the
adjustment right away."
From the game's opening, the
Seals employed a style of play com
mon for teams facing slower compe
tition.
The forwards looked to knock
the ball over the heads of Cardinal
defenders and then run the ball
down.
Essentially, the game was re
duced into a series of footraces,
magnifying the speed edge of the
Seals. After the second goal, howev

er, Stanford regrouped.
"We started to drop off a little on
defense to respect their speed," k
Bryla said. "We stopped letting*]
them get behind us."
Neutralizing the Seals' potent at
tack, the squad held its ground with.
solid defense the rest of the way but C
couldn't muster enough firepower
to cut into the deficit.
"After the first 10 minutes, we
were a lot more effective, but it's
hard when you put yourself in a hole i
like that," Bryla said. "They were
just really strong and physical, and
the speed was a huge factor."
If the Cardinal expected the
same out of last week's game
against the visiting Bosnians, they «
were unpleasantly surprised again. I
In fact, the style of the team was in *'
almost direct opposition to the *
American boys' squad, featuring ;
more emphasis on technical play •!
and less on sheer athleticism.
"They were a lot less athletic
than the other team hut very good at
moving the ball," Bryla said. "They
passed the ball well in tight spaces."
Infiltrating Stanford's defense
with short, accurate passes, the
Bosnian players, while not as explo
sive as the Seals, nonetheless still
managed to run an efficient attack
en route to the shutout.
For the visiting club, however,
the outcome of the game was likely
far less important than simply being
here. Sponsored by a group of
Americans, the Bosnian team is in
the middle of a six-week nationwide
tour of exhibitions.
Keeping with the tone of spring
training, Stanford head coach
Steve Swanson continued to shuf
fle his lineups, examining a number
of combinations and giving most of
the players a chance to gain experi
ence.
"We were definitely moving
people around a lot," Bryla said.
"We're down on numbers a little
with people out, but it's produced a
lot of playing time for everyone."
