# We're done! We're done! We're done!
## Ben and Jen bid farewell to Vol. 213 
### 
While the top 10 sports sto
ries of the year may have
been fairly predictable,
Hen and Jen have decided to dedicate
their farewell column to the top 10
things they have learned at The Daily.
They have learned about sports, writ
ing and editing but feel the most im
portant things they have learned have
little to do with journalism.

1. If you want something to be
turned in by 5 p.m., tell people it is
due at noon. No matter what dead
line people hear, they will almost al
ways be late. Some of the best ex
cuses we heard for late stories were,
"I fell asleep for three hours on the
way over to The Daily," "I forgot to
start it before the Bulls game, and
now I have to wait until the game is
over," and 'i had to go feed my girl
friend's advisor's cat, and it took
two hours." Thus, to avoid lame ex
cuses, tell someone an article is due
much earlier than you really need it.
2. We've honed our skills at The
Daily's national pastime: shooting a
dirty grey stuffed penguin through a
6-foot-tall hoop. If you've ever been
in the office, you've probably been
astounded and shocked by the in
credible proficiency of the sports
department at this completely
worthless, empty and repetitive ac
tivity. But at least it keeps us from
drink and heroin, pitfalls that have
befallen previous sports editors
(you know who you are).
3. Tresidder Express is open until
midnight — when you don't make it
home for dinner this is a key. Jamba
Juice closes at 10 and Polio Rey
closes at one in the morning. Mc-
Donalds closes at 11, way before the
Daily staffer's bedtime, but the Jack
in the Box drive-through (we rec
ommend the jalapeno poppers,
mint Oreo shakes and teriyaki
bowl) actually is open 24 / 7.
4. We've mastered the ability to nag
and get results, especially if our
sought goal is free food. The nights
The Daily springs for free food are
few and far between, but as the vol
ume went on, the sports depart
ment's ability to employ various
tactics to squeeze dinner out of this
rag's budget became quite astound
ing.
We don't want to brag, but we
would like to note how quickly
whining, gambling, crying and as
sault and battery — with or without

the use of broken bottles and iron
boots — became our personal
modes d'emploi.
5. Teamwork is a great skill. Being
able to find faxes on someone else's
messy desk is very important, as
well as the ability to weather the in
evitable push and pull of decision
making with a partner.

6. The Daily is a black hole. All
manner of floating debris — even
light waves — get sucked in by its in
credible force, never to see the light
of day again.
God knows we have. We don't
really know when it started, but at
some point last year our paths
through space passed too closely to
the Storke Publications Building
and we were sucked in by its amaz
ing force. We used to have tans —
no more. We used to have friends
too, but they could have died weeks
ago because we wouldn't have no
ticed. They used to notice when we
got home at 2 a.m. — not anymore.
If something were to happen, they
would never know. It's a shame.
7. Being diplomatic is probably the
No. 1 skill we have learned. We
have mastered the art of giving
"constructive criticism," and rank
ing three stories as the most impor
tant.
8. El Nino is an infinitely useful
writer's tool. Don't have a lead for
your story? No problem! If your
team won, it "harnessed the power
of El Nino." For a loss, say that the
Cardinal "was washed out as if sub
jected to the strength of El Nino."
Pulitzer Prize, here you come!
9. B-L-E-S-Z-Y-N-S-K-I, M-U-L-I-
T-A-U-A-O-P-E-L-E and H-O-C-
H-G-E-S-A-N-G. Spell em.
10. Most importantly, we've come
to respect Cardinal sports as the
best in the nation, hands down.
And it's a real pain when you
have to think of five different ways
to write "undefeated" in headlines
— on the same day — but working
at The Daily taught us to appreciate
it. We have a heck of an athletic de
partment.
It's almost as strong as El Nino.

Jen and Ben would like to thank their
gaggle of MEs and their writers —
you guys rock.
