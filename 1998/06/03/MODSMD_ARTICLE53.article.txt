WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ May 29: Senior Ania Bleszynski
loses in the finals of the NCAA
Championships individual draw to
Duke's Vanessa Webb 6-3,6-4.

Down 4-3 in the second set,
Bleszynski broke Webb's serve to
tie the set, but Webb bounced back
for a break of her own. The Duke
junior then held serve to become
the first women's singles champion
in Blue Devil history.
"Her game went right, and mine
didn't go so right," Bleszynski said.
"She played a tough match. I didn't
play badly; I just didn't finish out a
lot of the points. I had a lot of op
portunities, but I let her back into
the points. And she was really con
sistent."
Webb, with some help from the
conditions, was able to contain
Bleszynski's huge serve, which had
been the key throughout her
NCAA run to the finals.
"My serve wasn't working so
well today," Bleszynski said. "The
sun on one side and the wind on the
other kind of threw it off. She was
also returning well."
Webb did credit Bleszynski with
pushing her hardest.
"I think this is the hardest I've
fought," Webb said. "I knew 1
wasn't playing my best. The wind
was swirling, and that forced me to
adapt. Her serves were bouncing
high. I'm 5-11 and I was returing
serves over my shoulder."
That overpowering serve
proved to be Bleszynski's biggest
weapon as the Ail-American upset
the No. 3 and No. 7 seeds. She was
just the second unseeded player
ever to reach the finals.
"Right now. I'm disappointed
about losing my match." Bleszynski
said after the match. "But in a cou
ple of days, probably even later
tonight, 1 will get over it. I think I
had a good tournament, and I am
happy to even get this far. I'm glad I
have confidence in my game again."
After an incredible sophomore
season, Bleszynski was taken out of
the singles lineup last season when

the Cardinal won the NCAA team
championship at Stanford.
Now. after reaching at least the
national semifinals in two of the last
three NCAA singles draws,
Bleszynski has returned to true
form as one of the nation's elite sin
gles players.

Bleszynski wrapped up a
tremendous senior season with an
overall record of 37-8. She finishes
her Stanford career at 107-43. She
garnered All-America honors in
singles three times and in doubles
three times as well.
With the win, Webb completed

an impressive NCAA postseason.
Her squad reached the NCAA
team championship, earning an
upset over Stanford in the national
semifinals. Webb went on to reach
the semifinals in the doubles draw
and win the singles title without
dropping a set in six matches.
