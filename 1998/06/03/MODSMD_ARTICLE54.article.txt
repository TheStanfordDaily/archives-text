# The 						top 10 sports stories of 1997-98

### 
Five national championships, a handful of top-10 finishes: any other school would kill for this type of year. But
on the Farm, this is what we have come to expect. And as the year winds down, the memories that linger most
strongly are not only the great triumphs, hut also the potential that was never fully realized.

1 MEN'S BASKETBALL MAKES FIRST FINAL FOUR APPEARANG UN 56 YEARS. On the heels of the school's first appearance in the NCAA
tournament's Sweet Sixteen, the Cardinal found itself with one of the raos; highly touted frontcourts in the nation. Unfortunately, the team also had to
deal with doubts about its backcourt strength after losing All-American pa it guard Brevin Knight to graduation.
In Knight's absence, junior Arthur Lee stepped up as the Cardinal's clutch p ivc'r. almost single-handedly willing the team to many key victories.
The team opened the season with a school-record 18 consecutive victoriesai J dimbed as high as No. 4in the Associated Press poll before being slapped
with three losses over the next four games.
But the Cardinal rebounded and ran off the rest of the regular season with tvrt v one more loss, garnering the third seed in the Midwest Regional of the Big
Dance. Stanford held off upstarts College of Charleston and Western Michigcimn the subregional in Chicago to give the school its second-consecutive Sweet
Sixteen berth.
But the Cardinal wouldn't be stopped there. Spurred by the inspired play of freshman reserve Jarron Collins, the team overcame a sluggish start against
Purdue and advanced one game closer to San Antonio. Rhode Island, the regioial's No. X seed, came within 59 seconds of upsetting the Cardinal. Down by
six points, Stanford's run seemed to be over.
That's when Lee took over.
In the ensuing "Miracle Minute," Lee scored eight points and had two assists but his biggest play came on the other side of the ball. With the Cardinal trail
ing 74-73, Lee poked the ball away from the Rams' Cuttino Mobley. It bouncedto power forward Mark Madsen, who was fouled as he threw down the slam.
The dance that ensued could only be described as Mad Dog gone rabid, andthd|Cardinal went on to San Antonio with a 79-77 victory.
Up against perennial power and eventual champion Kentucky in the national semifinals, the Cardinal controlled the first 30 minutes of the game before
the Wildcats pulled ahead. The Cardinal was able to force overtime but fell when it was all over. As the Cardinal left the court, the entire coaches' seat
ing section at the Alamodome gave both teams' efforts a standing ovation.
It wasn't a national championship, but it was an effort that brought the national spotlight to the Farm.

2FOURTH-STRAIGHT NCAA TITLE FOR MEN'S TENNIS. Head coach Dick Gould called them the best team
he has ever coached, and he has won 16 NCAA titles while at Stanford. This collegiate tennis dream team made his
tory by being the first team ever to win four titles in a row, while losing only two singles matches and one doubles point
in its undefeated season. Sixteen titles is also the most won by a men's tennis program. Seniors Paul Goldstein and Charles
Hoeveler led the way, winning titles in all four years on the Farm.
The Card, No.l all season long, stormed through the postseason tournament without losing a point and beat host Geor
gia 4-0 in the final match. Goldstein and Hoeveler were formidably supported by junior Ryan Wolters, sophomores Geoff
Abrams and Bob and Mike Bryan, and freshman Alex Kim in their amazing run.

3 STANFORD WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
WINS UNPRECEDENTED FOURTH
NCAA TITLE. Entering their senior years,
Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharpley, Barbara Ifejika, Deb
bie Lambert and Paula McNamee were looking to
make history. And they did, not only by winning
the program's fourth title but also by becoming the
first class ever to win three championships.
But it wasn't easy.
In one of the best championship volleyball
matches ever, the Card avenged its only two regu
lar-season losses by defeating Penn State in five
grueling games. Stanford easily took the first two
games before the Nittany Lions roared back in
game three. What took place next will undoubted
ly go down as some of the most exciting collegiate
volleyball ever. Game four was an incredible see
saw battle with ties at 11,12 and 13.
Stanford saw two championship points thwart
ed by Penn State before the Nittany Lions forced a
decisive game five with a 17-15 win. Stanford cap
tured the lead early in game five, and after jump
ing out to a comfortable 14-9 advantage, Folkl put
the stamp on a historic match with her 1,833 rd ca
reer kill. The win gave the Cardinal its 28th con
secutive victory and 33 wins overall, both school
bests. , - ,

4 SWIMMING RETURNS TO DOMINANCE WITH A CHAMPI
ONSHIP SWEEP. For the men's and women's swimming teams, the
year was a huge success as both regained high ground with national ti
tles for the Card.
For the women, the bid to recapture the national championship was
never in doubt. Sophomore Catherine Fox — a recurring name on Stan
ford's cast of characters who helped the team to last year's title — was joined
by freshman phenom Misty Hyman, who turned in five record-setting per
formances at the NCAA Championships in Minneapolis to help the Card
run away with its eighth title.
The men's team was looking for its first title since 1994 and came through
in astounding fashion, scoring 205 more points than second-place Auburn,
the host of the meet. In the meet, all 16 Stanford swimmers who made it to
nationals scored points for the team.

5 TOP-SEEDED WOMEN'S HOOPS STUNNED
IN FIRST ROUND BY HARVARD. After a slug
gish 2-4 start to the post-Wideman / Starbird era, the
Cardinal women's basketball team ripped off 19 wins in 20
games to end the regular season. Seniors Kristin Folkl,
Olympia Scott and Vanessa Nygaard anchored an experi
enced frontline, and the rest of the Cardinal looked primed
to reach its fourth consecutive Final Four.
What followed could only be described as the cruelest
twists of fate ever bestowed on a Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
It started with the regular-season finale, when Nygaard
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. Three
days later, in the first play of practice, Folkl suffered the
exact same injury. These two devastating injuries were an
ominous prelude to the biggest upset in NCAA tourna
ment history. Ivy League champion Harvard came into
Maples Pavilion, a place where Stanford had not suffered
a loss in four years. But the 16th-seeded Crimson pulled off
the 71-67 stunner, getting 35 points from Allison Feaster
and swarming Scott down low on defense.

SSTANFORD5 STANFORD PROGRAMS HAVE BREAKTHROUGH YEARS. Several programs broke new ground this year on the Farm, including softball,
men's soccer and synchronized swimming. In its fifth year as a v&rsity sport, spftball broke into the national rankings at No. 17, and moved its way up
throughout the season, climbing as high as No. 9. The team also reached the playoffs for the first time and was awarded the top seed, before falling 4-0
to Oklahoma State in the regional championship game. Stanford finished 41 -IK its best record in history, and placed third in the perennially strong Pacific
10 Conference.
The men s soccer team also made the playoffs for the first time ever this season. Undefeated for much of the year, it achieved a No. 2 ranking after never
breaking into the top 10 previously. Although the team dropped its postseason opener in double overtime to Washington, it was the most successful season
in history, finishing at 13-5-2.
The synchronized swimming team also made history, winning its first natioital title by defeating Ohio State, which had won every title since 1985.

7 CROSS COUNTRY BARELY MISSES DOUBLE REPEAT. One of
the most exciting national championships for the Card was played out on
the trails of Greenville, S.C., where the Stanford men's cross country
team nailed its second consecutive title.
The final score — which had Stanford barely beating first-ranked
Arkansas 56-53 — was the closest in an NCAA-title cross country race in
more than 25 years.
Although Arkansas started out ahead in the final race, Stanford's top run
ners— senior Nathan Nutter, juniors Brad and Brent Hauser and senior Jason
Lunn among them — never gave up, and the team powered ahead in the last
minutes to get the win.
"Arkansas went out hard, and it could have been a nightmare at two miles
when we were back," said head coach Vin Lananna. "But we held tough and
ran with composure."
The top-ranked women's team was less than a second away from its title,
losing 100-102 to Brigham Young. The Cougars got the upper hand on two key
finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Freshman Ann Ramsey was the other key factor,
placing 51 st with an identical time to the three runners who placed ahead of her
— all by just fractions of a second. Either point swing could have meant the dif
ference for the Card and garnered the double repeat Stanford was hoping for.

BSTANDOUT8 STANDOUT PERFORMANCES ARE ALL
AROUND. Among all the team accomplishments,
many individuals achieved great feats of their own
this year.
Arguably the best two-sport athlete to attend Stan
ford, senior Kristin Folkl left her mark on the women's
volleyball and basketball teams. An Ail-American in
both sports this year, Folkl's legacy will be hard to replace
on either court. As Stanford's leading scorer and re
bounder in basketball, Folkl was named to the All-Pacif
ic 10 Conference team and was a finalist for the Naismith
Award. In volleyball, Folkl was the Honda-Broderick
Volleyball Player of the Year and Pac-10 Player of the
Year and set the Stanford record for most kills in a single
season en route to winning her third national title.
Sophomore Larissa Fontaine became the first Stan
ford woman ever to win a gymnastics title, capturing the
NCAA vault title. Sophomore Bob Bryan captured ten
nis' triple crown as he won the team, individual and dou
bles title at the NCAA Championships. Twin brother
Mike Bryan was Bob's double's partner, also earning that
individual accomplishment.
Sophomore Brad Hauser won the NCAA 5,000-meter
title at the indoor track championships. Junior Jeff Austin
was named Baseball America's Player of the Year, while
senior Heather Pease earned the individual synchronized
swimming title for the second year in a row.
Freshman swimmer Misty Hvman finished a phenom
enal year by winning five NCAA titles, all in record times,
and by being named both NC A A and Pac-10 Swimmer of
the Year. Hvman also was awarded the Honda-Broder
ick Award for women's swimming. Senior Tom Wilkens
capped a fabulous swimming career on the Farm at the
NCAA Championships, winning three individual titles
and one relay title.

9 BUT THERE WERE ALSO DISAPPOINTMENTS. It isn't just the
successes that stick out in our minds; it's also the surprising failures
from Cardinal baseball, football and men's soccer.
Despite being ranked No. 1 for a record 14 weeks, the Stanford baseball
team couldn't put it together down the stretch. After winning even series
entering the final weekend of its regular season, the team went into an un
explainable slump, losing six of its last seven games and dropping out of the
Western Regional at home after three games.
Stanford football started the season with a 4-1 record and a No. 16 rank
ing and appeared to be a contender for the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Calif.
But host Arizona knocked off the Cardinal 28-22. sending it reeling into its
first five-game losing streak since the WKB season. The team finished 5-6.
In similar fashion, men's soccer blasted through the first part of its sea
son. rising to No. 2 nationally and posting a 13-0-2 record. But after a hard
fought 2-1 loss to No. 1 Indiana, the team's strength was sapped, and it
couldn't win another game. The team eventually fell to Washington in dou
ble overtime at the NCAA tournament.

STANFORD RETAINS THE AXE WITH A 21-20 VICTORY
II 1 IN 1(K)TH BIG GAME. Sure, both teams were mediocre and
IV/ each team's seasons was in total freefall. But it was the 1 (K>th Big
Game, and it provided an exciting finish worthy of all the hype leading up
to it.
Stanford jumped out to a solid 21-10 halftime lead. But the offense never
scored again, as Gal drove down the field late in the fourth quarter for a
touchdown and two-point conversion that made it 21-IS. The Bears got the
hall back one more time and were inside Stanford's 30-yard line with I
minute, 22 seconds remaining. Golden Bear quarterback Justin \ odder
forced an errant pass as he was falling down, which senior linebacker C hris
Draft intercepted. After Stanford ran down the clock and took a safety that
made it a one-point affair, Vedder was sacked by junior defensive tackle
Andrew Currie on the last play before he could launch a desperation pass
downfield.
It ended the only way it could, the way everybody expected this Big
Game to finish.
