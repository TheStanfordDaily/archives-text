came in a distant 12th place in the 16-team field
in the first of three sailing national champi

The Brown women handily won the event —
which ran May 25-27 — by beating out second
place Dartmouth by 30 points with 112. Con
necticut College came in third with 174.
Stanford posted a three-day total of 264.
But in the second leg of the tournament — the
team championships that ran from Thursday to

garnering a fourth-place finish with an 8-3 race
record.
The third leg of the tournament, the coed
dinghy championships, began Monday and will
run until tonight. At the time of printing. Stan

table tennis team is sending three members to
major tournaments.
Freshman team captain Vineel Agarwal and
junior Eric Freedman will travel to Houston for
the U.S. Open, and freshman Greg Smith will
head to the South African National Champi
onships.
The team is coming off of a strong perfor
mance at the Collegiate National Champi
onships, where it finished fifth. Stanford was
the first West Coast team to ever compete in
the tournament.
"I can't wait to play at the U.S. Open this
year," Agarwal said. "Not only am I playing for

W omen's golf
lNtfO weeks after the disappointing finish by
the women's golf team at the NCAA tourna
ment in Madison. Wise., freshmen Stephanie
Keevei and Hillarv Homever were named All-

Americans.
Keever was named a second-team Ail-

mention.
Keever's performance was one of the lone
Cardinal bright spots at the NCAAs two weeks
ago.
After her team's regrettable opening-day
performance that put the team in 18th place in
the 19-team field, her strong play during the
next two days of the tournament helped power
the team to eighth place before tournament's
end.
Keever finished ninth individually at the
tournament and finished the season ranked
seventh in the nation.
Homeyer finished the season ranked 17th in
the nation. Along the way, she picked up two
tournament championships: the first at the
Stanford Intercollegiate in October, where she
scored a career-best 211; the second at the
Ping/Arizona State Invitational, where she
scored a 54-hole total of 215.
