WOMEN'S ULTIMATE FRISBEE
■ May 29-31: Stanford defends its national championship
by beating Carleton College 19-18 in the title game.

On the first day of competition May 29, Stanford (39-
0) dominated its six-team pool. Rice barely managed to
get on the scoreboard against the Card as it was crushed
15-2. In round two, Stanford finished off Yale 15-7.
Cardinal head coach Jennifer Donnelly used her rook
ies to carry the team through the first day while resting
most of her more experienced players for harder compe
tition later.
Day two offered more of a challenge to Stanford—but
not by much.
Stanford's toughest first-round competition came
from North Carolina-Wilmington. Due to rain, wind and
. lightning, the game was delayed as well as suspended part
' way through.
The match started out strong from both sides with
back-to-back scoring up to 2-2. Then, Stanford found the
tempo it was looking for to pull away 4-2.
Stanford gave up easy turnovers within 10 yards of the
goals, and Wilmington capitalized on these mistakes to
. pull easy scores. But in the end, ability prevailed as Stan-
I ford took the match 9-5.
In round five, Stanford cruised past Indiana 13-4. Stan

ford's Callahan winner for the most valuable player in the
nation — senior Andrea Johnson — led the Stanford de
fense to neutralize almost all of Indiana's offensive plays.
Round six would be no different, as Stanford pounded
MIT into a 13-4 defeat that marked Donnelley's l(X)th ca
reer victory.
Stanford, Oregon, Yale and Carleton College moved
on to the Final Four, where the Card met the Ducks.
Oregon had been training all year specifically to beat
Stanford, but the hard work didn't pay off.
Superfly came out on fire, bringing the score to 10-4.
Despite a valiant effort that took Oregon to seven, the
Ducks never regained the lead as Stanford finished them
off 13-7.
Stanford went on to face Carleton in the finals. After
several scores by both teams, Superfly pulled ahead with
a goal to set the score at 4-3.
In the second half, Stanford pulled away to a four-point
lead led by superb play of Johnson. Johnson embodied
the passion of Ultimate with layout plays offensively and
defensively.
Still, Carleton mustered up the momentum to pull
back to tie the score at 18, with the hard cap put at 19 —
the first team to score 19 points claims the match.
With Stanford possession, the Superfly worked the
disc up to the Carleton end zone only to turn it over.
In a last-ditch attempt to capture the title, Carleton
hucked the disc down the field only to have Cardinal se
nior captain Martina Emde completing the defense to
give Stanford possession.
Superfly then worked the Frisbee up field to recap
ture the national title with a sensational completion
from Emde to senior Chewie Chen that curved past
Chen's defender.
