meaning that another loss would send the team home.
The team, nicknamed Blood, would not let that
occur as it blew away the competition in day two with
15-8 and 15-5 victories over North Carolina State and
Harvard.

5-5. Then Stanford went on an 11-2 run.

turnovers from Brown, while converting on offensive
plays. Stanford's depth also played a huge factor, as its

bench carried the team while Brown's starting lineup
tired out on the field. '
Brown never recovered as the Bears ended their sea
son with a 19-11 loss.

actly mirroring the opening results of last year's finals.
Then the Stanford men fought back, trading points
before the Gauchos took a 10-7 lead. Both teams dis
played amazing offense, while defense was almost
nonexistent. This was disadvantageous for Stanford, as

Mike Johnson leading the offense, Stanford came back
onto the field to tie the match at 12-12.
The two teams traded points up to 17-17, with the

over in an uncompleted pass in the Santa Barbara end
zone that proved to be its last mistake.

the title with a final score of 20-17.
"We were crushed since we had wanted to win so
bad." said senior captain Alex Young. "But the 22 of us
and all the value and hard work put into our season
were experiences we wouldn't trade for anything."
