The Cardinal elite traversed the
country yesterday as Stanford's
track and field squads headed for the
NCAA Championship meet which
begins today in Buffalo, N.Y.
And considering the size of the
Stanford contingents, it is certain
that the Cardinal will be a force to be
reckoned with.

■ Today-Saturday: NCAA Champi
onships in Buffalo, N.Y.

The meet will pit 17 members of
the Cardinal squads against the na
tion's best teams and individual
competitors in the quest for individ
ual gold and improved team placing.
The Cardinal men placed 11th
last year, and though head coach Vin
Lananna thinks that rivaling teams
such as six-time defending champ
Arkansas and conference jugger
naut Arizona may be an unrealistic
goal, a top-10 finish is definitely in
sight.
"Our goal is to finish in the top
10," said Lananna, "and we want to
be a team that is consistently placing
in the top 10."
Competing for the men in the dis
tances will be freshman Clabe Jen
nings in the 1,500- and 5,000-meter
races and sophomore Michael Stem
ber in the 1,500. In the longer dis
tances, sophomores Brad and Brent
Hauser and senior Nathan Nutter
both will run the S,(KX) and 10.(XX),
and junior Jason Balkman will run
the 10.(XX).
Sophomore Tobv Stevenson will
compete in the pole vault, and senior
J ustin Strand and junior Adam Con
nolly will throw the hammer for the
Card.
The women, who sent eight ath
letes to compete, will have their
work cut out for them as they try to
improve upon last year's 12th-place

finish. Louisiana State has won the
national title for the past 11 years.
Competing for the Cardinal
women will be senior Monal Chok
shi and freshmen Sally Cilynn and
Courtney Adams in the 3,(XX)-meter
run, freshman Julia Stamps in the
S.IXX), freshman Melissa Feinstein
and sophomore Alicia Warlick in
the pole vault, sophomore Summer
Pierson in the discus, and junior'l ra
eye Lawyer in the high jump and
heptathlon.
Each event fields approximately
20 competitors who have met either
the automatic or provisional stan
dard for their event.
The meet is scored to eight
places, with 10 points for a first place
and one point for eighth. Both Stan
ford squads are capable of placing
very highly, and both are led by cur
rent national leaders.
Lawyer leads the nation and is
ranked 10th in the world in the hep
tathlon with a best of 5.889 points,
while Brad Hauser's 28:16.60 in the
10,(XX) is also the nation's collegiate
best. He is also ranked second in the
S,(XX) with a season best of 13:35.98.
Strand comes in ranked eighth in
the hammer, but his recent perfor
mances indicate that he may be back
in the form which garnered a fourth
place finish at last year's national
meet.
Successful doubles from Jennings
and the Hausers would also provide
vital points.
Aside from Lawyer, the women's
best chances for big points are Chok
shi and Cilynn, ranked fifth and
eighth, respectively, going into the
3,(XX), and Feinstein. who has been
on a vaulting tear during the past
weeks and may be ready to surpass
the 13-foot barrier. She is seeded
fifth in her event.
Preliminary heats for most events
begin today, and all finals will have
been contested by Saturday night.
"Our athletes are well prepared,"
Lananna said. "They'll do an excel
lent job."
