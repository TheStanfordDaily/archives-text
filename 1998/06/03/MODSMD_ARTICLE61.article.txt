# Stanford's Olympic history is golden
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
In the summer of 19%, Stanford athletes
set a record in Atlanta. The team of colle
giate Olympians brought home to the Farm
22 medals altogether, 18 of them gold.
Although Cardinal athletes garnered 19
overall medals at the Barcelona Games in
1992 and 17 in Seoul at the 1988 Olympics,
the 18 golds from Atlanta represent the
most Stanford had ever seen in the 19 Sum
mer Olympic Games where Cardinal ath
letes have competed. Had Stanford been its
own nation in Atlanta, it would have placed
among the top medal-winning countries.
An all-time Olympic medal count shows
the United States running clear ahead of
the international pack with a total of 1,897
medals. One hundred thirty-seven of these
tokens were won by Stanford representa
tives; a grand total of 169 medals — dou
ble-counting the medals in the team events
— belong to Stanford athletes past and
present.
The first Stanford Olympic medal was a
1912 bronze, won by George Horine, a for
mer member of the Stanford track team.
But Cardinal athletes have increased the
medal count as the school's program — and
the Olympics themselves — have devel
oped.
So far, 227 Stanford athletes have com
peted in the Summer Olympics. The figure
grows if Cardinal athletes of the Winter
Games are included.
From speed skater Eric Heiden, three
time luger Bonnie Warner and silver
medal winning figure skater Debi Thomas
to current Stanford athlete Sami Jo Small,
who represented Canada's women's hock
ey team at the Nagano Games this year,
Stanford also boasts a rich Winter
Olympics history.
"I saw so many Stanford Olympians at
the Games," said 1996 graduate A.J.
Hinch, a catcher on the bronze medal-win
ning baseball team in Atlanta. "That was
something that made the Games so special.
Not only was I proud to display my Ameri
can colors, I also was proud to share the
special moment with Stanford excellence."
While names of recent Cardinal greats

— such as sophomore swimmer Catherine
Fox, Class of '93 gymnast Jair Lynch or
basketball player Jennifer Azzi, Class of
'90 — remain fresh in the minds of Olympic
fans, Stanford athletes can be spotted
worldwide, competing in a variety of sports
at the highest caliber.
Stanford fencing coach Zoran Tulum, a
two-time Olympic coach, attributed the
overwhelming power and dominance of
Stanford athletes at the international level
to the competitive environment of the ath
letic program back on the Farm. Including
two alternates and a team manager, a total
of six Stanford members were on the U.S.'s
fencing team in Atlanta.
"For such a non-revenue sport like fenc
ing to have this many Stanford athletes is
just amazing," he said.
"I'm really proud to be here because
each of us pushes each other — you must
go for the best when you are surrounded by
the best. You don't have a choice but to fol
low in their footsteps.
"I came here from Harvard, and sure,
there were some Olympians there. But you

get here, and you're surrounded by so
many great coaches and athletes — and
suddenly, you're not satisfied with being in
the top 10 anymore. And the students feel
the same way. There are so many NCAA
titles, Olympic medals, national titles ...
you're not going to be worse than them."
A look at past Stanford participants
shows that the Olympic experience is not
just shared by the athletes.
While multiple Stanford coaches —
such as Skip Kenney and Richard Quick,
head coaches of men's and women's swim
ming, respectively — have led gold-medal
winning performances at the Games, sev
eral medalists have also returned to the
Farm to coach, such as field hockey coach
Sheryl Johnson, who won the bronze
medal in 1984.
While top-notch coaching and strong
administrative support is a huge magnet
for accomplished athletes, Stanford ath
letes say the team-oriented atmosphere of
the athletics program is an underlying fac
tor which helps create the cycle of athletic
excellence which has bred numerous Stan

ford Olympians.
According to junior Felicia Zimmer
mann, an Olympic fencer in the 1996
Games, the team spirit is part of the reason
why she chose to leave an exclusive club
environment back home in New York to
train on the Farm.
Although the East is traditionally
thought to be slightly more competitive in
her sport, Zimmermann said she is glad she
listened when current teammates such as
Monique De Bruin, an alternate on the
1996 Olympic fencing team, encouraged
her to transfer to Stanford.
"We have a very strong and talented
team with a national reputation here," she
said about her Stanford squad.
"During the Olympics, a lot of emotions
are going on, and it's hard because there's a
lot of pressure on you with two weeks of
nonstop hard work. But I saw (Stanford)
athletes like Jenny Thompson and Nancy
Reno (a Team USA Volleyball member),
and it was really neat to find out who all
these Olympians were.
"I can't wait for the next Olympics,"

Zimmermann said, adding that after she re
tires in 20(X), she would like to return to the
Farm and contribute to the team from the
coaching and administrative side.
It is clear that the Games are a token of
special memories to many in the Stanford
community: athletes, coaches and fans
alike.
Hinch, now with the Oakland A's,
called the Olympics "a once-in-a-lifetime
experience."
"My experience in Atlanta was unlike
any other baseball experience to me, be
cause of its short compact schedule with
each game meaning so much in pursuing a
common goal," he said. "I would definitely
go to another Olympics if given the oppor
tunity. To put it simply, there's no greater
experience than the Olympics."
With the continuing expansion of the
Games, opportunities for Stanford athletes
to participate in the world's biggest athlet
ic event are rising. Recent Games have
seen the addition of several new sports and
multiple events, many in programs where
Stanford excels.
At the Olympics in Atlanta, women's
softball made its debut as a full medal sport
as the counterpart to men's baseball, which
started in 1992. Women's soccer was also
added then, as were mountain biking and
beach volleyball.
Multiple new events in cycling, fencing,
rowing and swimming were introduced,
while basketball and volleyball expanded
their women's fields from eight to 12
teams.
With these current Olympic trends, cou
pled with the growing strength of Stanford
athletics, there may come an Olympic
event when the athletes of the Cardinal
sweep the country medal count altogether.
While the idea of the Tree as an
Olympic mascot is merely a novelty, the
image of the torch being passed from one
Stanford runner to another is a conceivable
occurrence. Future Olympics could see
three Stanford athletes on a single podium,
and not too many more Olympics will pass
before Stanford athletes shine more gold
than ever before.
But for now, watch out Sydney. Here
comes Stanford.

there were some Olympians there. But you

get here, and you're surrounded by so
many great coaches and athletes — and
suddenly, you're not satisfied with being in
the top 10 anymore. And the students feel
the same way. There are so many NCAA
titles, Olympic medals, national titles ...
you're not going to be worse than them."
A look at past Stanford participants
shows that the Olympic experience is not
just shared by the athletes.
While multiple Stanford coaches —
such as Skip Kenney and Richard Quick,
head coaches of men's and women's swim
ming, respectively — have led gold-medal
winning performances at the Games, sev
eral medalists have also returned to the
Farm to coach, such as field hockey coach
Sheryl Johnson, who won the bronze
medal in 1984.
While top-notch coaching and strong
administrative support is a huge magnet
for accomplished athletes, Stanford ath
letes say the team-oriented atmosphere of
the athletics program is an underlying fac
tor which helps create the cycle of athletic
excellence which has bred numerous Stan

ford Olympians.
According to junior Felicia Zimmer
mann, an Olympic fencer in the 1996
Games, the team spirit is part of the reason
why she chose to leave an exclusive club
environment back home in New York to
train on the Farm.
Although the East is traditionally
thought to be slightly more competitive in
her sport, Zimmermann said she is glad she
listened when current teammates such as
Monique De Bruin, an alternate on the
1996 Olympic fencing team, encouraged
her to transfer to Stanford.
"We have a very strong and talented
team with a national reputation here," she
said about her Stanford squad.
"During the Olympics, a lot of emotions
are going on, and it's hard because there's a
lot of pressure on you with two weeks of
nonstop hard work. But I saw (Stanford)
athletes like Jenny Thompson and Nancy
Reno (a Team USA Volleyball member),
and it was really neat to find out who all
these Olympians were.
"I can't wait for the next Olympics,"

Zimmermann said, adding that after she re
tires in 20(X), she would like to return to the
Farm and contribute to the team from the
coaching and administrative side.
It is clear that the Games are a token of
special memories to many in the Stanford
community: athletes, coaches and fans
alike.
Hinch, now with the Oakland A's,
called the Olympics "a once-in-a-lifetime
experience."
"My experience in Atlanta was unlike
any other baseball experience to me, be
cause of its short compact schedule with
each game meaning so much in pursuing a
common goal," he said. "I would definitely
go to another Olympics if given the oppor
tunity. To put it simply, there's no greater
experience than the Olympics."
With the continuing expansion of the
Games, opportunities for Stanford athletes
to participate in the world's biggest athlet
ic event are rising. Recent Games have
seen the addition of several new sports and
multiple events, many in programs where
Stanford excels.
At the Olympics in Atlanta, women's
softball made its debut as a full medal sport
as the counterpart to men's baseball, which
started in 1992. Women's soccer was also
added then, as were mountain biking and
beach volleyball.
Multiple new events in cycling, fencing,
rowing and swimming were introduced,
while basketball and volleyball expanded
their women's fields from eight to 12
teams.
With these current Olympic trends, cou
pled with the growing strength of Stanford
athletics, there may come an Olympic
event when the athletes of the Cardinal
sweep the country medal count altogether.
While the idea of the Tree as an
Olympic mascot is merely a novelty, the
image of the torch being passed from one
Stanford runner to another is a conceivable
occurrence. Future Olympics could see
three Stanford athletes on a single podium,
and not too many more Olympics will pass
before Stanford athletes shine more gold
than ever before.
But for now, watch out Sydney. Here
comes Stanford.
