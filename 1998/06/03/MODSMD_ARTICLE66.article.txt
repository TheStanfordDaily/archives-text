## Sweet Jesus! Is this book too wacky for its own good? 
### Kerry Shaw Staff writer 
Stephan Jamarillo's new novel "Chocolate Jesus" (Berkeley Press, $12) is the literary equivalent of a sum
mer action movie with great special effects but no plot. The manycharacters in "Chocolate Jesus" have in
teresting qualities, but they are strung together too capriciously. Like the players in an over-hyped action flick,
you get the feeling that the writer doesn't care about them, so you have no reason to either.
The "special effects" in "Chocolate Jesus" are gimmicks. Every character is over the top in one way or an
other. There's the Kennedy assassination scholar. There's the evil owner of the world-famous Bea's Candies.
There's Willy Domingo, the televangelist host of "Sweatin'with the Lord."
And then there's the novel's protagonist, Sydney Corbet, who returns to live with his brother Marty in the
Arizona desert after a self-imposed exile at the Koala Center, a Positive Care Facility for the Mildly Neurotic.
Sydney is obsessed with a plan to convince Bea's Candies to create the holiest of sweet snacks the choco
late Jesus.
Meanwhile, Willy, who leads the Church of the Returning Vegetarian Christ, is trying to thwart this un
healthy plan for Christ's image. He is convinced that Jesus will return to Earth as a pumped up fitness freak.
He emphatically states, "You think they're lighting up in Heaven? It's no smoking. 1 hink there s an espresso
machine or a Starbuck's? Doesn't work that way. Jesus is not going to need a cup of coffee to get going on
Judgment Morning ... He's not coming back for an angioplasty.
Characters like these keep Jamarillo's novel light and snappy, but too much so; you never fully grasp or
empathize with any of them. The chapters are rarely longer than three pages, and the sentences are snippet
sized. There are so many references to pop culture icons — from figure-skater Michelle Kwan to former
Stanford legend Tiger Woods — that the novel might be outdated by graduation.
The major problem is that the conflict at the heart of the novel — saving Bea's candy shop — is interest
ing, but hardly worth 220 pages. "Chocolate Jesus" is a story that could be much more satiating if only it were
shaved down to half its current serving size.
