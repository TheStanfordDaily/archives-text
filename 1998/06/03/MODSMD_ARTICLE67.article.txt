# Racial Cacophony caucasia
## 
### Amina Gautier Contributing writer 
£ (Riverhead Books, $24.95), by Stanford alumna
I Danzy Senna, takes a surprisingly good shot at exploring
Vracial identity and hits it on the nose. The book deals with
race, family and identity. Specifically, it focuses on the racial tension
between blacks and whites in 1970s New England. The twist in
"Caucasia" is that most of the tension occurs within one family.
The story takes place in Boston, "back when Boston still came in
black and white, yellowing around the edges." Cole and Birdie are the
daughters of Sandy and Deck Lee. Sandy is a white woman whose
family traces its history back to Cotton Mather of Salem witchcraft
fame. Deck is a black professor at Boston University.
Although Birdie and Cole are sisters, they don't look alike. Cole is
"cinnamon-skinned, curly-haired" with green eyes. There's no
doubt about her blackness. On the other hand, her younger sister
Birdie is not so easily identifiable.
When Birdie and her father go to a park one afternoon, police of
ficers stop them, thinking that Deck is a black man trying to kidnap a
little white girl. Her grandmother thinks Birdie's a tragic figure who
could go through life as an Italian or a Persian, and she prefers her
over Cole. A Pakistani man on a plane ride from Boston to Berkeley
speaks to Birdie in his native tongue because he thinks she's from his
homeland. In New Hampshire, people think she's Jewish. Nicholas, a
boy who she has a crush on, calls her "Poca," short for Pocahantas be
cause he thinks she looks Native American and slightly dirty enough
for him to "lick her clean."
Sandy wants the children to grow up shielded from racism and prej
udice. She tutors them at home before finally sending them to the
Nkrumah School at their father's behest. Their father wants them to be
an experiment, to be proof of the things he writes in his books on race.
Deck calls his daughters "canaries in the coal mine." Just as the coal
miners used canaries to gauge how poisonous the air was in the mine
shaft, "mulattos had historically been the gauge of how poisonous
American race relations were." Realizing that the canaries had to die
in order to show the shaft was poisonous, their father believed that his
daughters were "the first generation of canaries to survive, a little in
jured, perhaps, but alive."
When Birdie and Cole's parents split, they divide their daughters
between them. Deck takes Cole to Brazil, but Sandy takes Birdie to
New Hampshire where they pretend to be the widow and daughter of
a Jewish professor. Sandy gives her daughter a new identity and calls
her Jesse Goldman. Birdie finds herself exposed to people who spit
out epithets like kike, nigger and spic without thought, thinking she is
one of them. Birdie learns that identity is based on what people see
rather than what they come to know.
"Caucasia" is a fierce, elegant and challenging book. There are no
easy sides to take and no characters who can be completely loved or
hated. However, it does have its flaws. In the midst of the complexity
of "Caucasia," Birdie remains the focus and the main star. That seems
contrary to the point the author wishes to make. By having Birdie go
away with the white mother, Senna takes the easy way out. This story
seems more familiar than it should. The Brazil / New Hampshire par
allel seems slightly stereotypical.
Although the crux of the story is that Birdie loses her identity, there
are times when Senna makes her too passive. Birdie seems like a blank
slate to write on, yet she herself never picks up the chalk. But what's
the point of surviving if you have to disappear?
