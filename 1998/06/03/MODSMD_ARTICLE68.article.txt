## The
						Second Annual Intermission Fiction contest 
### 
Hello Intermission readers, and welcome to the second annual Intermission fiction contest. This year, we had almost 40 entries, varying from one to 20 pages, covering topic s like
death, sex, religion, drugs, aging, anal rape, the apocalypse, jungles and Microsoft. We had a hard time choosing among all of your entries, but after a great deal ofdtscusstng and heated
argument, we chose the winners: Dan Vekhter, Catherine New and Amino Gautier.
We chose the winning entries using two criteria:
1) Readability
2) The clarity of the writing (le., appropriate use of metaphor, expressive language without "purple prose")
The stories were read by independently by three members of the Daily editorial staff. Positive and negative scores were tabulated at the end of the reading process.
Thanks to everyone who submitted to the contest. We know that you all worked very hard to get your entries in, because quite a few of you turned in your entries exactly at mid
night Thank you for putting so much effort into your stories. It made our jobs as judges that muth easier. Please continue writing. It's been a wonderful volume.
â€” The editors
