The house stood on the corner of
Green and Maple. It was two stories
high, painted white, with a trimmed
fringing the driveway. I pulled up to it at
3:34 p.m., parked and rang the doorbell.

'3448 Green' by Dan Vekhter

I was lucky to land a job at Winston & Davis fresh out of
school. Barely three months ago 1 was still wearing the gradua
tion cap, and here I was now, in a black suit, briefcase in my
hand and business cards in my wallet, involved in the biggest
construction project in the state. I could hardly believe it myself.
1 rang the doorbell again. 3448 Green Avenue was the ad
dress. Most of the other houses on this block were already sold,
and the clearing was to begin in a few weeks. The project called
for the construction to be finished by 1999, though anyone
who'd spent time in the business world knew that such dates
were bound to be moved down several times along the way.
Just as I was about to head back to my car, the door
opened. I smiled professionally and offered my business card
to the old man who peered at me.
"Mr. Larosse? Martin J. Keller, from Winston & Davis."
He drew back when he heard the name of the company
and looked at me with an icy stare. He did not take my card.
"I'm not selling my house," he said.
"Mr. Larosse, may I come in?"
"No," he said curtly. "Tell your bosses I'm not selling
my house."
That was that. He closed the door in my face, and I stood
there looking like a fool.
Larosse really had no choice in the matter. The project was
approved by more government agencies than you could sue
in a lifetime. It was just a matter of negotiating the fee, then
helping him move out, then demolishing his house and start

ing the construction of the project.
I was very excited to be involved in the project. My boss
had been dropping hints that after the land deals were closed,
he would recommend that I be moved to the international di
vision, and I knew that then my career would really take off.

I had to go to the cemetery the next morning. I had actu
ally forgotten that it was three years since my parents' deaths,
but the date was stored in my electronic organizer. I felt a bit
guilty about wasting time when 1 should be doing work, but
I called my boss and he said he understood.
It had rained the night before and the ground was muddy,
but fortunately I had the foresight not to wear my good shoes.
I placed the flowers I bought at a nearby drugstore on the
tombstones and stood around for a bit. 1 didn't really know
what I should be doing or feeling.
After standing there for 25 minutes, I went to see Larosse.
I rang the doorbell at 2:15 p.m. and waited patiently.
Unlike me, Larosse was in no hurry. When he finally an
swered the door, he frowned when he saw my face.
"I'm not selling my house."
"Mr. Larosse," I said, smiling genially, "I'm not leaving, so
you might as well let me in."
"I'm not selling my house." He started to close the door,
so I had to push my briefcase in the crack to stop him.
"Sir, may I come in?"
He looked at the briefcase with indignation. I was still smiling,

slightly more tense than before. I had no time for his foolishness.
He motioned me in. His whole house was dark and had a
damp smell to it. It was decorated with random bric-a-brac
and furniture that did not go well together — a hideous yel
low couch in one corner of the living room, a deep blue arm
chair in another, a white coffee table in the center.
"I'm not selling my house."
His song was getting old. I explained everything to him
— about the government contract, the approvals, et cetera,
et cetera, ad nauseam. The old man didn't seem to get it.
"It's my house. I'm not selling it."
I spent 40 minutes in that room arguing with him. I was
getting seriously ticked off, though not letting it show, of
course. By that time, he was reduced to monosyllabic re
sponses, and just when I thought he would break and settle
the matter nicely, he started coughing.
"I'm sorry, but I need something to drink," he said.
"Would you like some lemonade?"
I said fine, and he led me into the kitchen.
A stubby fridge stood by the window. It must have been
made in the late '60s, and it was archaic and ugly. He opened
it, took out a jar, poured the lemonade out and handed me
the glass. It was refreshing after all the arguing I did with him.
I sat back in the chair and relaxed for a moment. I would go
back at it soon, but for now I allowed my host some rest.
"This house," he said, sipping from his own glass, "I've
owned this house for 50 years."

He looked at me, perhaps expecting sympathy.
"Nancy was so excited to buy it,"he said. "We didn't have
much money then, and I had to go into debt, but we bought it.
Our first house. I remember how I carried Nancy inside. She
was so happy. We didn't have any furniture yet, but Nancy spent
all of the first week going from room to room, planning where
the beds, the dressers and the tables would go. When we did
manage to buy some secondhand furniture, every day she made
me move it from place to place until she felt it was perfect."
He chuckled softly.
"Mr. I am here to speak to you about the sale of
the house," I reminded him.
He looked at me with disappointment, stood up, and left the
kitchen. Back in the living room, he sat down on the yellow couch
and said, "Mr. Keller, I am sorry, but I will not sell this house."
I left the house at 3:20 p.m., having made absolutely no
progress. I could see this was going to be harder than I thought.
I went to Larosse after lunch the next day, and he reluctantly
invited me in. This time, I came armed with a prepared pre
sentation to show and explain to him how the project was to
proceed and how the legalities worked. He listened passively to
me for some time and then pointed to one of the charts and
asked, "You really enjoy doing this stuff, don't you?"
I was slightly taken aback. "Yes, sir, I do," I said.
Larosse smiled approvingly. "That's good. I'm glad you're
doing something you like." He paused, coughed a few times
and cleared his throat. "I'm afraid I must interrupt your pre
sentation," he said, "but I need some lemonade."
And so we were in the kitchen again.
As Larosse poured out the lemonade, he shook his head
and smiled. "You know, I could not stand this stuff before
Gordon was born. But he absolutely loved it, and he made
me drink it too. We had races to see who would finish his
glass first." He laughed. "And gradually I came to like it. Now
it's all 1 drink. Funny how kids change your life in little ways."
I nodded politely, not quite sure what I could add to his
monologue.
"Gordon was a really active kid," Larosse said. "He loved
sports. We spent hours outside in the backyard, playing catch
or just fooling around. It was fun."
I sipped my lemonade silently.
"And then," Larosse said quietly, "he went off to war." He
paused and stared silently at the lemonade jar for a few
seconds. "He was blown up by a grenade."
I froze. I was afraid the old man would break up and start
crying, but he seemed pretty solid.
"I'm sorry," Lsaid. I had finished my lemonade, but it did
n't seem quite right to start arguing about the house again.
Mr. Larosse shook his head, staring out into space.
"It didn't kill him. The grenade. It crippled him. Gordon
came back to live here after that. Come." He stood up and left
the kitchen. I had no choice but to follow.
He took me upstairs to a small bedroom with a made bed
and a small wooden desk.
"This was his room. He sat on the chair often and read.
Read anything he had. Books, magazines, anything," Mr.
Larosse said.
"Where is he now?" 1 asked.
Mr. Larosse shrugged. "He blew his head off with a re
volver in '77 while sitting at that desk. After Nancy cleaned
up, I wouldn't allow anyone to touch anything in the room."
He opened the door and went out of the bedroom. I saw
him blink qujckly a few times.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Keller," he said, "but I have to take my
medications. You'll have to leave."
The next morning, I was determined not to leave until I
made him sign the sale documents. The deadline for closing
the land deals was fast approaching, and my boss would not
appreciate me dragging this simple thing out.
But when I started talking, larosse started coughing hard.
He pressed a handkerchief to his mouth, and when he took
it away I could see a red stain on it. His eyes followed my gaze
and he quickly put the handkerchief away.
"Lemonade?" he asked.
As we drank the lemonade, he started asking me questions
about my family and myself. I told him whatever he wanted to
know and he listened with what seemed like genuine interest.
"Do you miss your parents, Mr. Keller?" he asked.
I shrugged.
He nodded twice, contemplative, then said, "There's a
baseball game today, on TV. Do you want to see it?"
"I'm not a big fan."
"I used to watch baseball with Rick," Larosse said. "He was

my youngest. We always watched it together." He looked at
me with sadness in his eyes. "I miss him," he said.
And so we watched the game. Larosse was an avid fan, and
I started to feel some of his enthusiasm. When I finally
looked at my watch, I realized that I had spent four hours in
his house. I parted with him hurriedly, and only when I was
driving back to the office did I realize that I didn't speak with
him about the sale of the house at all.
I left my briefcase in my car the next day, because I knew
he didn't like it, and he wouldn't sign anything today anyway.
When he opened the door, he had dark circles under his eyes
and was leaning on a cane.
"My doctor told me to use this a while ago," he explained,
pointing to the cane, "but I never felt the need for it until to
day. I guess I'm truly getting old."
He let me talk for a while before he brought out lemon
ade without asking me.
"Nancy taught me to make this lemonade. It's very good,
don't you agree, Mr. Keller?"
"Marty. Call me Marty. Yes, it is."
"Nancy was a great cook," Mr. Larosse said. "She cooked the
best veal you've ever tasted. The kids loved her cooking. After
Gordon went off to war, she missed him very much. She could
n't sleep at night, worrying about her little boy. She'd bake
cookies all the time and send them to Gordon. With the way
the mail was, he was lucky if he got them barely two months
after she sent them. But he would always say that he and the
guys ate them all and loved it. He asked for more every time he
wrote home. And she'd bake them. She'd be happy then and
wouldn't worry for a while." Larosse smiled into space.
"After Gordon returned from Vietnam," he said slowly,
"she stopped cooking. She would say she'd lost the magic
touch. I had to take over as the chef of the family. And the
thing is, I couldn't cook at all." He chuckled. "You should've
seen Rick's face when he tried my meatloaf the first time I
tried to make it. But I got better over time," Larosse said. "I
can whip up a good dinner now on a good day. I would cook
something for you, but I've been feeling tired lately." He
closed his eyes for a moment. "But as soon as I get better, I'll
cook you my lamb chops. You'll like them, I'm sure, even
though they aren't as good as Nancy's."
"I would like that," I said.
He looked at the ugly yellow couch I was sitting in. "Nancy
loved the couch. She would sit here and listen to the radio all
the time, and then she'd fall asleep here, still sitting, and I'd
carry her upstairs to bed. I used to get annoyed at her for not
going to sleep like normal people, and she'd just laugh."
Larosse poured some more lemonade.
I smiled.
Larosse sighed. "And then one day she died in that couch,
and I had to carry her to rest one last time."
I didn't try to get him to sell that day. I just felt a bit tired
and knew I wouldn't have the energy. We spent the next two
hours going over his old photograph albums. He showed me
photos of Nancy, himself, Gordon and Rick. When I re
turned home, I dragged out my own photo albums from un
derneath the legal books that were piling up on my desk and
spent the evening looking at the faces of my parents.
Larosse looked very ill when he opened the door for nje
the next morning. "Are you feeling all right?" I asked.
He smiled weakly and gave me a weary thumbs-up. "I've
been a little under the weather lately, but I'm quite all right,"
he said, "and I plan to get even better tomorrow.''
I did not want to bother him by talking about the house,
but I couldn't just leave him either. We chatted a while about
the weather, politics and baseball.
"Are you happy, Marty?" he suddenly asked me out of
nowhere.
I was a bit surprised. "Yes. Yes, I am," I said.
He nodded. "That's good. That's what Rick used to say. He
was a financial lawyer. He was hired by a top Wall Street firm.
He had himself a girl. You got a girl, Marty?"
I informed him that I hadn't.
"Well, you'll find one, I'm sure. You're a nice boy. Rick got
married in 77."
"Yes. You showed me the pictures yesterday."
"She divorced him three years later. She was having an af
fair, it turns out. He was pretty broken up about it."
"I can imagine."
"Rick never recovered from heartbreak, really. He was fired
from his job and was out of work for a long time. I tried to
help him, but he said he didn't want any help. He got mad at
me for caring." Larosse sighed. "He moved south and cut off

all contact with me. 1 haven't heard from him for 10 years."
Larosse smiled sadly. "All these years I've been waiting for
him to return one day. 1 know he will, someday. I'm sure of
it. But it has been a lonely 10 years. Besides the occasional
salesman, you're the first person to set foot in this house
since he left."
He didn't seem to remember that I was a salesman.
"Marty," Larosse said, "there's a baseball game on. Would
you watch it with me?"
I did.
It took Larosse quite some time to open the door after I
rang the doorbell. He leaned on his cane heavily. "I'm sorry,
I didn't hear the doorbell," he said.
"I understand that you do not want to move," I said. "I
want to help you. But the company has a lot of power and I
don't think —"
He shook his head, and I shut up.
"Marty," he said apologetically, "this house is everything
to me. Come, let me show you."
He spent three hours showing me the house. He talked to
me about the history of every room. There was the room where
Nancy loved to sit in a rocking chair and stare out the window.
She spent more and more time there as the kids grew up and
did not need her as much anymore. She missed them dearly.
There was Rick's room, where he used to listen to his music
and construct model cars. Gordon's, which he had already
showed me, where, before Vietnam, Gordon put up posters of
mountains and cliffs. He always wanted to go rock climbing but
never got the chance. After the war, he tore all the posters down.
Back in the living room, Larosse sat in the yellow couch.
He looked at me somberly.
"Marty," he said quietly, "my life, my whole life is in this
house. Memories of my sons and my wife are here. Nancy,
Gordon and Rick are no longer with me, but I have memo
ries of them in every room of this house. Nancy and Gordon
and Rick, they all live here, in these empty rooms, in this fur
niture, in these walls. I can't sell them."
"Mr. Larosse," I started, but he interrupted me.
"I'm sorry to be so much bother to you," he said, "but the
house is mine. I will never sell it."
When Larosse didn't answer the doorbell the next day, I
tried the doorknob. The door was unlocked. I stood silently
in the doorway, peering into the dark house. I called his
name out. My stomach tightened and my throat was very dry
all of a sudden. I slowly stepped inside.
He was in the living room, lying on the yellow couch. His
eyes were closed.
The funeral was on a cloudy day. I must have stood there
for a long time after the grave was filled, because when I felt
a hand on my shoulder I realized that it had started to rain,
everyone had gone home and I was alone with a man dressed
in a business suit holding an umbrella over my head.
"You're drenched," he said.
I stared at him.
"My name is Rick Larosse," he said, glancing at his Rolex.
"I was supposed to speak to you about the house."
I could see the similarity in the facial features. I started to
speak but had to clear my throat.
"Yes. You can pick up the check at the office downtown."
He nodded. I moved away from under his umbrella.
"I was told you did not want any of your father's posses
sions," I said. "So they have been sold." It was tough to speak.
He smiled sadly. "I wonder who had actually bought all
that stuff he had. 1 don't think any of it was newer than 1970."
"I did."
"W^at?"
"I said I bought it," I told him. He heard the hostility in
my voice and looked at me in puzzlement.
"My father and I ... we were never too close," he started.
"He loved you very much," I said.
He squinted as he looked at me.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I don't quite understand the relation
ship you had with my father..."
"No," I said. The rain had stopped, and the sun showed
through the clouds, making the wet grass glitter and scintil
late as the cool wind swept over it."I don't think you do."

The house stood on the corner of
Green and Maple. It was two stories
high, painted white, with a trimmed
fringing the driveway. I pulled up to it at
3:34 p.m., parked and rang the doorbell.

Larosse sighed. "And then one day she died in that couch,
and I had to carry her to rest one last time."
I didn't try to get him to sell that day. I just felt a bit tired
and knew I wouldn't have the energy. We spent the next two
hours going over his old photograph albums. He showed me
photos of Nancy, himself, Gordon and Rick. When I re
turned home, I dragged out my own photo albums from un
derneath the legal books that were piling up on my desk and
spent the evening looking at the faces of my parents.
Larosse looked very ill when he opened the door for nje
the next morning. "Are you feeling all right?" I asked.
He smiled weakly and gave me a weary thumbs-up. "I've
been a little under the weather lately, but I'm quite all right,"
he said, "and I plan to get even better tomorrow.''
I did not want to bother him by talking about the house,
but I couldn't just leave him either. We chatted a while about
the weather, politics and baseball.
"Are you happy, Marty?" he suddenly asked me out of
nowhere.
I was a bit surprised. "Yes. Yes, I am," I said.
He nodded. "That's good. That's what Rick used to say. He
was a financial lawyer. He was hired by a top Wall Street firm.
He had himself a girl. You got a girl, Marty?"
I informed him that I hadn't.
"Well, you'll find one, I'm sure. You're a nice boy. Rick got
married in 77."
"Yes. You showed me the pictures yesterday."
"She divorced him three years later. She was having an af
fair, it turns out. He was pretty broken up about it."
"I can imagine."
"Rick never recovered from heartbreak, really. He was fired
from his job and was out of work for a long time. I tried to
help him, but he said he didn't want any help. He got mad at
me for caring." Larosse sighed. "He moved south and cut off

all contact with me. 1 haven't heard from him for 10 years."
Larosse smiled sadly. "All these years I've been waiting for
him to return one day. 1 know he will, someday. I'm sure of
it. But it has been a lonely 10 years. Besides the occasional
salesman, you're the first person to set foot in this house
since he left."
He didn't seem to remember that I was a salesman.
"Marty," Larosse said, "there's a baseball game on. Would
you watch it with me?"
I did.
It took Larosse quite some time to open the door after I
rang the doorbell. He leaned on his cane heavily. "I'm sorry,
I didn't hear the doorbell," he said.
"I understand that you do not want to move," I said. "I
want to help you. But the company has a lot of power and I
don't think —"
He shook his head, and I shut up.
"Marty," he said apologetically, "this house is everything
to me. Come, let me show you."
He spent three hours showing me the house. He talked to
me about the history of every room. There was the room where
Nancy loved to sit in a rocking chair and stare out the window.
She spent more and more time there as the kids grew up and
did not need her as much anymore. She missed them dearly.
There was Rick's room, where he used to listen to his music
and construct model cars. Gordon's, which he had already
showed me, where, before Vietnam, Gordon put up posters of
mountains and cliffs. He always wanted to go rock climbing but
never got the chance. After the war, he tore all the posters down.
Back in the living room, Larosse sat in the yellow couch.
He looked at me somberly.
"Marty," he said quietly, "my life, my whole life is in this
house. Memories of my sons and my wife are here. Nancy,
Gordon and Rick are no longer with me, but I have memo
ries of them in every room of this house. Nancy and Gordon
and Rick, they all live here, in these empty rooms, in this fur
niture, in these walls. I can't sell them."
"Mr. Larosse," I started, but he interrupted me.
"I'm sorry to be so much bother to you," he said, "but the
house is mine. I will never sell it."
When Larosse didn't answer the doorbell the next day, I
tried the doorknob. The door was unlocked. I stood silently
in the doorway, peering into the dark house. I called his
name out. My stomach tightened and my throat was very dry
all of a sudden. I slowly stepped inside.
He was in the living room, lying on the yellow couch. His
eyes were closed.
The funeral was on a cloudy day. I must have stood there
for a long time after the grave was filled, because when I felt
a hand on my shoulder I realized that it had started to rain,
everyone had gone home and I was alone with a man dressed
in a business suit holding an umbrella over my head.
"You're drenched," he said.
I stared at him.
"My name is Rick Larosse," he said, glancing at his Rolex.
"I was supposed to speak to you about the house."
I could see the similarity in the facial features. I started to
speak but had to clear my throat.
"Yes. You can pick up the check at the office downtown."
He nodded. I moved away from under his umbrella.
"I was told you did not want any of your father's posses
sions," I said. "So they have been sold." It was tough to speak.
He smiled sadly. "I wonder who had actually bought all
that stuff he had. 1 don't think any of it was newer than 1970."
"I did."
"W^at?"
"I said I bought it," I told him. He heard the hostility in
my voice and looked at me in puzzlement.
"My father and I ... we were never too close," he started.
"He loved you very much," I said.
He squinted as he looked at me.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I don't quite understand the relation
ship you had with my father..."
"No," I said. The rain had stopped, and the sun showed
through the clouds, making the wet grass glitter and scintil
late as the cool wind swept over it."I don't think you do."

The house stood on the corner of
Green and Maple. It was two stories
high, painted white, with a trimmed
fringing the driveway. I pulled up to it at
3:34 p.m., parked and rang the doorbell.

'3448 Green' by Dan Vekhter

I was lucky to land a job at Winston & Davis fresh out of
school. Barely three months ago 1 was still wearing the gradua
tion cap, and here I was now, in a black suit, briefcase in my
hand and business cards in my wallet, involved in the biggest
construction project in the state. I could hardly believe it myself.
1 rang the doorbell again. 3448 Green Avenue was the ad
dress. Most of the other houses on this block were already sold,
and the clearing was to begin in a few weeks. The project called
for the construction to be finished by 1999, though anyone
who'd spent time in the business world knew that such dates
were bound to be moved down several times along the way.
Just as I was about to head back to my car, the door
opened. I smiled professionally and offered my business card
to the old man who peered at me.
"Mr. Larosse? Martin J. Keller, from Winston & Davis."
He drew back when he heard the name of the company
and looked at me with an icy stare. He did not take my card.
"I'm not selling my house," he said.
"Mr. Larosse, may I come in?"
"No," he said curtly. "Tell your bosses I'm not selling
my house."
That was that. He closed the door in my face, and I stood
there looking like a fool.
Larosse really had no choice in the matter. The project was
approved by more government agencies than you could sue
in a lifetime. It was just a matter of negotiating the fee, then
helping him move out, then demolishing his house and start

ing the construction of the project.
I was very excited to be involved in the project. My boss
had been dropping hints that after the land deals were closed,
he would recommend that I be moved to the international di
vision, and I knew that then my career would really take off.

I had to go to the cemetery the next morning. I had actu
ally forgotten that it was three years since my parents' deaths,
but the date was stored in my electronic organizer. I felt a bit
guilty about wasting time when 1 should be doing work, but
I called my boss and he said he understood.
It had rained the night before and the ground was muddy,
but fortunately I had the foresight not to wear my good shoes.
I placed the flowers I bought at a nearby drugstore on the
tombstones and stood around for a bit. 1 didn't really know
what I should be doing or feeling.
After standing there for 25 minutes, I went to see Larosse.
I rang the doorbell at 2:15 p.m. and waited patiently.
Unlike me, Larosse was in no hurry. When he finally an
swered the door, he frowned when he saw my face.
"I'm not selling my house."
"Mr. Larosse," I said, smiling genially, "I'm not leaving, so
you might as well let me in."
"I'm not selling my house." He started to close the door,
so I had to push my briefcase in the crack to stop him.
"Sir, may I come in?"
He looked at the briefcase with indignation. I was still smiling,

slightly more tense than before. I had no time for his foolishness.
He motioned me in. His whole house was dark and had a
damp smell to it. It was decorated with random bric-a-brac
and furniture that did not go well together — a hideous yel
low couch in one corner of the living room, a deep blue arm
chair in another, a white coffee table in the center.
"I'm not selling my house."
His song was getting old. I explained everything to him
— about the government contract, the approvals, et cetera,
et cetera, ad nauseam. The old man didn't seem to get it.
"It's my house. I'm not selling it."
I spent 40 minutes in that room arguing with him. I was
getting seriously ticked off, though not letting it show, of
course. By that time, he was reduced to monosyllabic re
sponses, and just when I thought he would break and settle
the matter nicely, he started coughing.
"I'm sorry, but I need something to drink," he said.
"Would you like some lemonade?"
I said fine, and he led me into the kitchen.
A stubby fridge stood by the window. It must have been
made in the late '60s, and it was archaic and ugly. He opened
it, took out a jar, poured the lemonade out and handed me
the glass. It was refreshing after all the arguing I did with him.
I sat back in the chair and relaxed for a moment. I would go
back at it soon, but for now I allowed my host some rest.
"This house," he said, sipping from his own glass, "I've
owned this house for 50 years."

He looked at me, perhaps expecting sympathy.
"Nancy was so excited to buy it,"he said. "We didn't have
much money then, and I had to go into debt, but we bought it.
Our first house. I remember how I carried Nancy inside. She
was so happy. We didn't have any furniture yet, but Nancy spent
all of the first week going from room to room, planning where
the beds, the dressers and the tables would go. When we did
manage to buy some secondhand furniture, every day she made
me move it from place to place until she felt it was perfect."
He chuckled softly.
"Mr. I am here to speak to you about the sale of
the house," I reminded him.
He looked at me with disappointment, stood up, and left the
kitchen. Back in the living room, he sat down on the yellow couch
and said, "Mr. Keller, I am sorry, but I will not sell this house."
I left the house at 3:20 p.m., having made absolutely no
progress. I could see this was going to be harder than I thought.
I went to Larosse after lunch the next day, and he reluctantly
invited me in. This time, I came armed with a prepared pre
sentation to show and explain to him how the project was to
proceed and how the legalities worked. He listened passively to
me for some time and then pointed to one of the charts and
asked, "You really enjoy doing this stuff, don't you?"
I was slightly taken aback. "Yes, sir, I do," I said.
Larosse smiled approvingly. "That's good. I'm glad you're
doing something you like." He paused, coughed a few times
and cleared his throat. "I'm afraid I must interrupt your pre
sentation," he said, "but I need some lemonade."
And so we were in the kitchen again.
As Larosse poured out the lemonade, he shook his head
and smiled. "You know, I could not stand this stuff before
Gordon was born. But he absolutely loved it, and he made
me drink it too. We had races to see who would finish his
glass first." He laughed. "And gradually I came to like it. Now
it's all 1 drink. Funny how kids change your life in little ways."
I nodded politely, not quite sure what I could add to his
monologue.
"Gordon was a really active kid," Larosse said. "He loved
sports. We spent hours outside in the backyard, playing catch
or just fooling around. It was fun."
I sipped my lemonade silently.
"And then," Larosse said quietly, "he went off to war." He
paused and stared silently at the lemonade jar for a few
seconds. "He was blown up by a grenade."
I froze. I was afraid the old man would break up and start
crying, but he seemed pretty solid.
"I'm sorry," Lsaid. I had finished my lemonade, but it did
n't seem quite right to start arguing about the house again.
Mr. Larosse shook his head, staring out into space.
"It didn't kill him. The grenade. It crippled him. Gordon
came back to live here after that. Come." He stood up and left
the kitchen. I had no choice but to follow.
He took me upstairs to a small bedroom with a made bed
and a small wooden desk.
"This was his room. He sat on the chair often and read.
Read anything he had. Books, magazines, anything," Mr.
Larosse said.
"Where is he now?" 1 asked.
Mr. Larosse shrugged. "He blew his head off with a re
volver in '77 while sitting at that desk. After Nancy cleaned
up, I wouldn't allow anyone to touch anything in the room."
He opened the door and went out of the bedroom. I saw
him blink qujckly a few times.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Keller," he said, "but I have to take my
medications. You'll have to leave."
The next morning, I was determined not to leave until I
made him sign the sale documents. The deadline for closing
the land deals was fast approaching, and my boss would not
appreciate me dragging this simple thing out.
But when I started talking, larosse started coughing hard.
He pressed a handkerchief to his mouth, and when he took
it away I could see a red stain on it. His eyes followed my gaze
and he quickly put the handkerchief away.
"Lemonade?" he asked.
As we drank the lemonade, he started asking me questions
about my family and myself. I told him whatever he wanted to
know and he listened with what seemed like genuine interest.
"Do you miss your parents, Mr. Keller?" he asked.
I shrugged.
He nodded twice, contemplative, then said, "There's a
baseball game today, on TV. Do you want to see it?"
"I'm not a big fan."
"I used to watch baseball with Rick," Larosse said. "He was

my youngest. We always watched it together." He looked at
me with sadness in his eyes. "I miss him," he said.
And so we watched the game. Larosse was an avid fan, and
I started to feel some of his enthusiasm. When I finally
looked at my watch, I realized that I had spent four hours in
his house. I parted with him hurriedly, and only when I was
driving back to the office did I realize that I didn't speak with
him about the sale of the house at all.
I left my briefcase in my car the next day, because I knew
he didn't like it, and he wouldn't sign anything today anyway.
When he opened the door, he had dark circles under his eyes
and was leaning on a cane.
"My doctor told me to use this a while ago," he explained,
pointing to the cane, "but I never felt the need for it until to
day. I guess I'm truly getting old."
He let me talk for a while before he brought out lemon
ade without asking me.
"Nancy taught me to make this lemonade. It's very good,
don't you agree, Mr. Keller?"
"Marty. Call me Marty. Yes, it is."
"Nancy was a great cook," Mr. Larosse said. "She cooked the
best veal you've ever tasted. The kids loved her cooking. After
Gordon went off to war, she missed him very much. She could
n't sleep at night, worrying about her little boy. She'd bake
cookies all the time and send them to Gordon. With the way
the mail was, he was lucky if he got them barely two months
after she sent them. But he would always say that he and the
guys ate them all and loved it. He asked for more every time he
wrote home. And she'd bake them. She'd be happy then and
wouldn't worry for a while." Larosse smiled into space.
"After Gordon returned from Vietnam," he said slowly,
"she stopped cooking. She would say she'd lost the magic
touch. I had to take over as the chef of the family. And the
thing is, I couldn't cook at all." He chuckled. "You should've
seen Rick's face when he tried my meatloaf the first time I
tried to make it. But I got better over time," Larosse said. "I
can whip up a good dinner now on a good day. I would cook
something for you, but I've been feeling tired lately." He
closed his eyes for a moment. "But as soon as I get better, I'll
cook you my lamb chops. You'll like them, I'm sure, even
though they aren't as good as Nancy's."
"I would like that," I said.
He looked at the ugly yellow couch I was sitting in. "Nancy
loved the couch. She would sit here and listen to the radio all
the time, and then she'd fall asleep here, still sitting, and I'd
carry her upstairs to bed. I used to get annoyed at her for not
going to sleep like normal people, and she'd just laugh."
Larosse poured some more lemonade.
I smiled.
Larosse sighed. "And then one day she died in that couch,
and I had to carry her to rest one last time."
I didn't try to get him to sell that day. I just felt a bit tired
and knew I wouldn't have the energy. We spent the next two
hours going over his old photograph albums. He showed me
photos of Nancy, himself, Gordon and Rick. When I re
turned home, I dragged out my own photo albums from un
derneath the legal books that were piling up on my desk and

I was slightly taken aback. "Yes, sir, I do," I said.
Larosse smiled approvingly. "That's good. I'm glad you're
doing something you like." He paused, coughed a few times
and cleared his throat. "I'm afraid I must interrupt your pre
sentation," he said, "but I need some lemonade."
And so we were in the kitchen again.
As Larosse poured out the lemonade, he shook his head
and smiled. "You know, I could not stand this stuff before
Gordon was born. But he absolutely loved it, and he made
me drink it too. We had races to see who would finish his
glass first." He laughed. "And gradually I came to like it. Now
it's all 1 drink. Funny how kids change your life in little ways."
I nodded politely, not quite sure what I could add to his
monologue.
"Gordon was a really active kid," Larosse said. "He loved
sports. We spent hours outside in the backyard, playing catch
or just fooling around. It was fun."
I sipped my lemonade silently.
"And then," Larosse said quietly, "he went off to war." He
paused and stared silently at the lemonade jar for a few
seconds. "He was blown up by a grenade."
I froze. I was afraid the old man would break up and start
crying, but he seemed pretty solid.
"I'm sorry," Lsaid. I had finished my lemonade, but it did
n't seem quite right to start arguing about the house again.
Mr. Larosse shook his head, staring out into space.
"It didn't kill him. The grenade. It crippled him. Gordon
came back to live here after that. Come." He stood up and left
the kitchen. I had no choice but to follow.
He took me upstairs to a small bedroom with a made bed
and a small wooden desk.
"This was his room. He sat on the chair often and read.
Read anything he had. Books, magazines, anything," Mr.
Larosse said.
"Where is he now?" 1 asked.
Mr. Larosse shrugged. "He blew his head off with a re
volver in '77 while sitting at that desk. After Nancy cleaned
up, I wouldn't allow anyone to touch anything in the room."
He opened the door and went out of the bedroom. I saw
him blink qujckly a few times.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Keller," he said, "but I have to take my
medications. You'll have to leave."
The next morning, I was determined not to leave until I
made him sign the sale documents. The deadline for closing
the land deals was fast approaching, and my boss would not
appreciate me dragging this simple thing out.
But when I started talking, larosse started coughing hard.
He pressed a handkerchief to his mouth, and when he took
it away I could see a red stain on it. His eyes followed my gaze
and he quickly put the handkerchief away.
"Lemonade?" he asked.
As we drank the lemonade, he started asking me questions
about my family and myself. I told him whatever he wanted to
know and he listened with what seemed like genuine interest.
"Do you miss your parents, Mr. Keller?" he asked.
I shrugged.
He nodded twice, contemplative, then said, "There's a
baseball game today, on TV. Do you want to see it?"
"I'm not a big fan."
"I used to watch baseball with Rick," Larosse said. "He was

my youngest. We always watched it together." He looked at
me with sadness in his eyes. "I miss him," he said.
And so we watched the game. Larosse was an avid fan, and
I started to feel some of his enthusiasm. When I finally
looked at my watch, I realized that I had spent four hours in
his house. I parted with him hurriedly, and only when I was
driving back to the office did I realize that I didn't speak with
him about the sale of the house at all.
I left my briefcase in my car the next day, because I knew
he didn't like it, and he wouldn't sign anything today anyway.
When he opened the door, he had dark circles under his eyes
and was leaning on a cane.
"My doctor told me to use this a while ago," he explained,
pointing to the cane, "but I never felt the need for it until to
day. I guess I'm truly getting old."
He let me talk for a while before he brought out lemon
ade without asking me.
"Nancy taught me to make this lemonade. It's very good,
don't you agree, Mr. Keller?"
"Marty. Call me Marty. Yes, it is."
"Nancy was a great cook," Mr. Larosse said. "She cooked the
best veal you've ever tasted. The kids loved her cooking. After
Gordon went off to war, she missed him very much. She could
n't sleep at night, worrying about her little boy. She'd bake
cookies all the time and send them to Gordon. With the way
the mail was, he was lucky if he got them barely two months
after she sent them. But he would always say that he and the
guys ate them all and loved it. He asked for more every time he
wrote home. And she'd bake them. She'd be happy then and
wouldn't worry for a while." Larosse smiled into space.
"After Gordon returned from Vietnam," he said slowly,
"she stopped cooking. She would say she'd lost the magic
touch. I had to take over as the chef of the family. And the
thing is, I couldn't cook at all." He chuckled. "You should've
seen Rick's face when he tried my meatloaf the first time I
tried to make it. But I got better over time," Larosse said. "I
can whip up a good dinner now on a good day. I would cook
something for you, but I've been feeling tired lately." He
closed his eyes for a moment. "But as soon as I get better, I'll
cook you my lamb chops. You'll like them, I'm sure, even
though they aren't as good as Nancy's."
"I would like that," I said.
He looked at the ugly yellow couch I was sitting in. "Nancy
loved the couch. She would sit here and listen to the radio all
the time, and then she'd fall asleep here, still sitting, and I'd
carry her upstairs to bed. I used to get annoyed at her for not
going to sleep like normal people, and she'd just laugh."
Larosse poured some more lemonade.
I smiled.
Larosse sighed. "And then one day she died in that couch,
and I had to carry her to rest one last time."
I didn't try to get him to sell that day. I just felt a bit tired
and knew I wouldn't have the energy. We spent the next two
hours going over his old photograph albums. He showed me
photos of Nancy, himself, Gordon and Rick. When I re
turned home, I dragged out my own photo albums from un
derneath the legal books that were piling up on my desk and
spent the evening looking at the faces of my parents.
Larosse looked very ill when he opened the door for nje
the next morning. "Are you feeling all right?" I asked.
He smiled weakly and gave me a weary thumbs-up. "I've
been a little under the weather lately, but I'm quite all right,"
he said, "and I plan to get even better tomorrow.''
I did not want to bother him by talking about the house,
but I couldn't just leave him either. We chatted a while about
the weather, politics and baseball.
"Are you happy, Marty?" he suddenly asked me out of
nowhere.
I was a bit surprised. "Yes. Yes, I am," I said.
He nodded. "That's good. That's what Rick used to say. He
was a financial lawyer. He was hired by a top Wall Street firm.
He had himself a girl. You got a girl, Marty?"
I informed him that I hadn't.
"Well, you'll find one, I'm sure. You're a nice boy. Rick got
married in 77."
"Yes. You showed me the pictures yesterday."
"She divorced him three years later. She was having an af
fair, it turns out. He was pretty broken up about it."
"I can imagine."
"Rick never recovered from heartbreak, really. He was fired
from his job and was out of work for a long time. I tried to
help him, but he said he didn't want any help. He got mad at
me for caring." Larosse sighed. "He moved south and cut off

all contact with me. 1 haven't heard from him for 10 years."
Larosse smiled sadly. "All these years I've been waiting for
him to return one day. 1 know he will, someday. I'm sure of
it. But it has been a lonely 10 years. Besides the occasional
salesman, you're the first person to set foot in this house
since he left."
He didn't seem to remember that I was a salesman.
"Marty," Larosse said, "there's a baseball game on. Would
you watch it with me?"
I did.
It took Larosse quite some time to open the door after I
rang the doorbell. He leaned on his cane heavily. "I'm sorry,
I didn't hear the doorbell," he said.
"I understand that you do not want to move," I said. "I
want to help you. But the company has a lot of power and I
don't think —"
He shook his head, and I shut up.
"Marty," he said apologetically, "this house is everything
to me. Come, let me show you."
He spent three hours showing me the house. He talked to
me about the history of every room. There was the room where
Nancy loved to sit in a rocking chair and stare out the window.
She spent more and more time there as the kids grew up and
did not need her as much anymore. She missed them dearly.
There was Rick's room, where he used to listen to his music
and construct model cars. Gordon's, which he had already
showed me, where, before Vietnam, Gordon put up posters of
mountains and cliffs. He always wanted to go rock climbing but
never got the chance. After the war, he tore all the posters down.
Back in the living room, Larosse sat in the yellow couch.
He looked at me somberly.
"Marty," he said quietly, "my life, my whole life is in this
house. Memories of my sons and my wife are here. Nancy,
Gordon and Rick are no longer with me, but I have memo
ries of them in every room of this house. Nancy and Gordon
and Rick, they all live here, in these empty rooms, in this fur
niture, in these walls. I can't sell them."
"Mr. Larosse," I started, but he interrupted me.
"I'm sorry to be so much bother to you," he said, "but the
house is mine. I will never sell it."
When Larosse didn't answer the doorbell the next day, I
tried the doorknob. The door was unlocked. I stood silently
in the doorway, peering into the dark house. I called his
name out. My stomach tightened and my throat was very dry
all of a sudden. I slowly stepped inside.
He was in the living room, lying on the yellow couch. His
eyes were closed.
The funeral was on a cloudy day. I must have stood there
for a long time after the grave was filled, because when I felt
a hand on my shoulder I realized that it had started to rain,
everyone had gone home and I was alone with a man dressed
in a business suit holding an umbrella over my head.
"You're drenched," he said.
I stared at him.
"My name is Rick Larosse," he said, glancing at his Rolex.
"I was supposed to speak to you about the house."
I could see the similarity in the facial features. I started to
speak but had to clear my throat.
"Yes. You can pick up the check at the office downtown."
He nodded. I moved away from under his umbrella.
"I was told you did not want any of your father's posses
sions," I said. "So they have been sold." It was tough to speak.
He smiled sadly. "I wonder who had actually bought all
that stuff he had. 1 don't think any of it was newer than 1970."
"I did."
"W^at?"
"I said I bought it," I told him. He heard the hostility in
my voice and looked at me in puzzlement.
"My father and I ... we were never too close," he started.
"He loved you very much," I said.
He squinted as he looked at me.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I don't quite understand the relation
ship you had with my father..."
"No," I said. The rain had stopped, and the sun showed
through the clouds, making the wet grass glitter and scintil
late as the cool wind swept over it."I don't think you do."

The house stood on the corner of
Green and Maple. It was two stories
high, painted white, with a trimmed
fringing the driveway. I pulled up to it at
3:34 p.m., parked and rang the doorbell.

'3448 Green' by Dan Vekhter

I was lucky to land a job at Winston & Davis fresh out of
school. Barely three months ago 1 was still wearing the gradua
tion cap, and here I was now, in a black suit, briefcase in my
hand and business cards in my wallet, involved in the biggest
construction project in the state. I could hardly believe it myself.
1 rang the doorbell again. 3448 Green Avenue was the ad
dress. Most of the other houses on this block were already sold,
and the clearing was to begin in a few weeks. The project called
for the construction to be finished by 1999, though anyone
who'd spent time in the business world knew that such dates
were bound to be moved down several times along the way.
Just as I was about to head back to my car, the door
opened. I smiled professionally and offered my business card
to the old man who peered at me.
"Mr. Larosse? Martin J. Keller, from Winston & Davis."
He drew back when he heard the name of the company
and looked at me with an icy stare. He did not take my card.
"I'm not selling my house," he said.
"Mr. Larosse, may I come in?"
"No," he said curtly. "Tell your bosses I'm not selling
my house."
That was that. He closed the door in my face, and I stood
there looking like a fool.
Larosse really had no choice in the matter. The project was
approved by more government agencies than you could sue
in a lifetime. It was just a matter of negotiating the fee, then
helping him move out, then demolishing his house and start

ing the construction of the project.
I was very excited to be involved in the project. My boss
had been dropping hints that after the land deals were closed,
he would recommend that I be moved to the international di
vision, and I knew that then my career would really take off.

I had to go to the cemetery the next morning. I had actu
ally forgotten that it was three years since my parents' deaths,
but the date was stored in my electronic organizer. I felt a bit
guilty about wasting time when 1 should be doing work, but
I called my boss and he said he understood.
It had rained the night before and the ground was muddy,
but fortunately I had the foresight not to wear my good shoes.
I placed the flowers I bought at a nearby drugstore on the
tombstones and stood around for a bit. 1 didn't really know
what I should be doing or feeling.
After standing there for 25 minutes, I went to see Larosse.
I rang the doorbell at 2:15 p.m. and waited patiently.
Unlike me, Larosse was in no hurry. When he finally an
swered the door, he frowned when he saw my face.
"I'm not selling my house."
"Mr. Larosse," I said, smiling genially, "I'm not leaving, so
you might as well let me in."
"I'm not selling my house." He started to close the door,
so I had to push my briefcase in the crack to stop him.
"Sir, may I come in?"
He looked at the briefcase with indignation. I was still smiling,

slightly more tense than before. I had no time for his foolishness.
He motioned me in. His whole house was dark and had a
damp smell to it. It was decorated with random bric-a-brac
and furniture that did not go well together — a hideous yel
low couch in one corner of the living room, a deep blue arm
chair in another, a white coffee table in the center.
"I'm not selling my house."
His song was getting old. I explained everything to him
— about the government contract, the approvals, et cetera,
et cetera, ad nauseam. The old man didn't seem to get it.
"It's my house. I'm not selling it."
I spent 40 minutes in that room arguing with him. I was
getting seriously ticked off, though not letting it show, of
course. By that time, he was reduced to monosyllabic re
sponses, and just when I thought he would break and settle
the matter nicely, he started coughing.
"I'm sorry, but I need something to drink," he said.
"Would you like some lemonade?"
I said fine, and he led me into the kitchen.
A stubby fridge stood by the window. It must have been
made in the late '60s, and it was archaic and ugly. He opened
it, took out a jar, poured the lemonade out and handed me
the glass. It was refreshing after all the arguing I did with him.
I sat back in the chair and relaxed for a moment. I would go
back at it soon, but for now I allowed my host some rest.
"This house," he said, sipping from his own glass, "I've
owned this house for 50 years."

He looked at me, perhaps expecting sympathy.
"Nancy was so excited to buy it,"he said. "We didn't have
much money then, and I had to go into debt, but we bought it.
Our first house. I remember how I carried Nancy inside. She
was so happy. We didn't have any furniture yet, but Nancy spent
all of the first week going from room to room, planning where
the beds, the dressers and the tables would go. When we did
manage to buy some secondhand furniture, every day she made
me move it from place to place until she felt it was perfect."
He chuckled softly.
"Mr. I am here to speak to you about the sale of
the house," I reminded him.
He looked at me with disappointment, stood up, and left the
kitchen. Back in the living room, he sat down on the yellow couch
and said, "Mr. Keller, I am sorry, but I will not sell this house."
I left the house at 3:20 p.m., having made absolutely no
progress. I could see this was going to be harder than I thought.
I went to Larosse after lunch the next day, and he reluctantly
invited me in. This time, I came armed with a prepared pre
sentation to show and explain to him how the project was to
proceed and how the legalities worked. He listened passively to
me for some time and then pointed to one of the charts and
asked, "You really enjoy doing this stuff, don't you?"
I was slightly taken aback. "Yes, sir, I do," I said.
Larosse smiled approvingly. "That's good. I'm glad you're

and cleared his throat. "I'm afraid I must interrupt your pre
