The house stood on the corner of
Green and Maple. It was two stories
high, painted white, with a trimmed
fringing the driveway. I pulled up to it at
3:34 p.m., parked and rang the doorbell.

'3448 Green' by Dan Vekhter

I was lucky to land a job at Winston & Davis fresh out of
school. Barely three months ago 1 was still wearing the gradua
tion cap, and here I was now, in a black suit, briefcase in my
hand and business cards in my wallet, involved in the biggest
construction project in the state. I could hardly believe it myself.
1 rang the doorbell again. 3448 Green Avenue was the ad
dress. Most of the other houses on this block were already sold,
and the clearing was to begin in a few weeks. The project called
for the construction to be finished by 1999, though anyone
who'd spent time in the business world knew that such dates
were bound to be moved down several times along the way.
Just as I was about to head back to my car, the door
opened. I smiled professionally and offered my business card
to the old man who peered at me.
"Mr. Larosse? Martin J. Keller, from Winston & Davis."
He drew back when he heard the name of the company
and looked at me with an icy stare. He did not take my card.
"I'm not selling my house," he said.
"Mr. Larosse, may I come in?"
"No," he said curtly. "Tell your bosses I'm not selling
my house."
That was that. He closed the door in my face, and I stood
there looking like a fool.
Larosse really had no choice in the matter. The project was
approved by more government agencies than you could sue
in a lifetime. It was just a matter of negotiating the fee, then
helping him move out, then demolishing his house and start

ing the construction of the project.
I was very excited to be involved in the project. My boss
had been dropping hints that after the land deals were closed,
he would recommend that I be moved to the international di
vision, and I knew that then my career would really take off.

I had to go to the cemetery the next morning. I had actu
ally forgotten that it was three years since my parents' deaths,
but the date was stored in my electronic organizer. I felt a bit
guilty about wasting time when 1 should be doing work, but
I called my boss and he said he understood.
It had rained the night before and the ground was muddy,
but fortunately I had the foresight not to wear my good shoes.
I placed the flowers I bought at a nearby drugstore on the
tombstones and stood around for a bit. 1 didn't really know
what I should be doing or feeling.
After standing there for 25 minutes, I went to see Larosse.
I rang the doorbell at 2:15 p.m. and waited patiently.
Unlike me, Larosse was in no hurry. When he finally an
swered the door, he frowned when he saw my face.
"I'm not selling my house."
"Mr. Larosse," I said, smiling genially, "I'm not leaving, so
you might as well let me in."
"I'm not selling my house." He started to close the door,
so I had to push my briefcase in the crack to stop him.
"Sir, may I come in?"
He looked at the briefcase with indignation. I was still smiling,

slightly more tense than before. I had no time for his foolishness.
He motioned me in. His whole house was dark and had a
damp smell to it. It was decorated with random bric-a-brac
and furniture that did not go well together — a hideous yel
low couch in one corner of the living room, a deep blue arm
chair in another, a white coffee table in the center.
"I'm not selling my house."
His song was getting old. I explained everything to him
— about the government contract, the approvals, et cetera,
et cetera, ad nauseam. The old man didn't seem to get it.
"It's my house. I'm not selling it."
I spent 40 minutes in that room arguing with him. I was
getting seriously ticked off, though not letting it show, of
course. By that time, he was reduced to monosyllabic re
sponses, and just when I thought he would break and settle
the matter nicely, he started coughing.
"I'm sorry, but I need something to drink," he said.
"Would you like some lemonade?"
I said fine, and he led me into the kitchen.
A stubby fridge stood by the window. It must have been
made in the late '60s, and it was archaic and ugly. He opened
it, took out a jar, poured the lemonade out and handed me
the glass. It was refreshing after all the arguing I did with him.
I sat back in the chair and relaxed for a moment. I would go
back at it soon, but for now I allowed my host some rest.
"This house," he said, sipping from his own glass, "I've
owned this house for 50 years."
