### Horse's Tail' by Catherine New 
That morning when we woke up I made her
coffee, like I always do, and served it to her in
bed. That afternoon she cut off all her hair and
left it in a pile in the middle of the room.

She asks, "When is she coming?"
We are in my apartment. It is one room which I have divided in two with a zebra
print tapestry that hangs down the middle to separate Passion from Reason. There is
a small sofa I inherited from the landlady. It is on the Passion side of the tapestry.
I say, "In a few days."
We are sitting on the sofa. She is upright, her legs are bent, and her feet are resting
on the coffee table in front of the sofa. I am perpendicular to her, resting my neck on
the arm of the sofa and my legs straight out, smuggled under the teepee of her bent
ones. She is chain-smoking cigarettes and ashing in the coffee cup I brought her ear
lier. The ashes are sticking to the sugary residue at the bottom of the cup. This is what
I love about her. She is irreverent like that.
"God, Miles, I don't know," she says. "This is the worst. I don't know what to do
with myself."
She stub? out her cigarette in the coffee cup and swats at her eyes so I won't see her
tears. I know they are there. She had been crying in her sleep last night. Curled like a
small shrimp next to me, big unconscious tears had been rolling down her face and
dripping into the pillow. It makes me want to crawl into a hole, seeing her like this.
Crying and not crying.
"Listen, Camilla, you are so strong," I offer to her.
I want to tell her how beautiful she is to me. Her hair is long, straight and
brown. Hair-colored hair, she calls it. Sometimes she wears it in pigtails, which
just kills me; she looks so innocent and fun like

that. When I first met her, she told me that she
might be a lesbian but didn't know yet, and I
told her that even if she was she shouldn't cut it
off. It was her best feature.
My hair, it was my hair that I knew she adored.
She had told me that and counted the number of
dreadlocks. It was somewhere between 50 and 60.
She lost count after she had started kissing me on
the back of my neck.
I can hear the traffic passing outside the open
window. I live on a side street that is used as a short
cut to avoid the main traffic. The traffic is constant;
cars revving at the stop sign and then speeding
down the suburban street. The sounds from the
street come in through the window that is open over
there in Reason. I never thought that this would be
happening to me. As if life isn't hard enough.
"I hate the sound of my own heart breaking,"
she says at last. The only thing I can hear is the
traffic and the dripping from the leaky faucet.
We had met at a party thrown by four Amazon
au pair girls that Jan, my research partner, knew.
We were both there, strangers in our own town,
surrounded by these towering German 19-year
olds. Unlikely aliens we were.
Camilla had come up to me first. She had said,
"Hey rasta-man, do you have a light?" Turned out

Anyway, we ended up talking for the rest
of the night, and when the end of the
party came we went back to my place
together. She seemed like that kind of a
girl. You know, comfortable with the fact
the we had only just met. And besides,
she had told me that she was probably
a lesbian but didn't know yet. I think I
pretty much got a hard-on right away
when she said that.

she worked at the same restaurant that my girlfriend had worked at before we met, but
they didn't know each other. Anyway, we ended up talking for the rest of the night,
and when the end of the party came we went back to my place together. She seemed

And besides, she had told me that she was probably a lesbian but didn't know yet. I
think I pretty much got a hard-on right away when she said that.
So after that night, in the morning, 1 had brought her coffee in bed. Julia had told
me once that if I wanted a woman to fall in love with me, I should bring her break
fast in bed. I couldn't remember if 1 had told her about Julia, my girlfriend, who was
studying in England for the year. Camilla said I didn't, 1 thought I did, but I guess it
didn't matter because I brought her the coffee in bed anyway.
"Camilla, you are so beautiful," 1 tell her. "I'll never forget you." She stares straight
ahead. I know she doesn't want to look at me because she'll start crying again.
"Don't tell me that. Don't make me die like that," she whispers. I want to give her
something. That seems to be the right thing to do. Camilla gets up off the sofa and
walks over to the window and stares outside.
"Jesus, everybody drives a fucking car," she says.
Why did I do this to her? Or why, 1 guess I am thinking, did I do this to myself? I
don't want to let her go even though I need to. But what pisses me off is that it is my
own fault. I just sal on the pot and never took a shit. Julia, far away Julia, spending all
her money to call me every day and tell me about her junkie flatmates and how her
eye has begun to bleed, turning it a deep red around her iris. I couldn't tell her, not
over the phone, that I wasn't in love with her anymore.
And Camilla was so patient, all those mornings when the phone rang from

England with Julia on the other end. She would wait patiently for me to finish, read
ing the books on my shelf which Julia had left behind. It was funny, or maybe weird,
or both, but all the things that Julia had given me — a pepper grinder and a papier-
egg that was a rattle — Camilla had noticed. They were things that she had
picked up first in my apartment.
"I want to give you something, Camilla. What can I give you?" I ask her back. I feel
low asking her this. I know what I should give, what I want to give her, but it is im
possible. I look at my things around the room, searching for an object that sums up
me. An icon for her.
"My plant?" I suggest. My small potted plant that I am nurturing along with a small
pot of dirt that I am hoping will sprout something green eventually. Camilla had ex
plained to me very seriously the virtues of talking to plants. She had read that talking
to plants made them grow better. In fact, Prince Charles himself talked to his plants.
"I don't want anything," she says.
She turns around and comes back to the couch and lights another cigarette. "OK,
I know what I want," she says."I want your hair. Not all of it, just some of it. A dread
lock." She looks at me and reaches out to feel my hair. "This one. This is the one I
want," she says, tugging on one over my left ear.
I'm not sure at what point we began to love each other. At first, after that party
with the enormous German girls, we were so careful with each other, trying not to let
the other know that if we could, we would spend the whole day in bed, smoking cig
arettes and licking each other. She would stop by after work — on her way home, she
would insist the minute she walked in the door. But she felt too good to send back
out into the night, and I would insist that she stay.

I told her almost nothing about Julia. She asked
in the beginning if I had any pictures of her, and 1
told her no. It was true. I didn't have any pictures
of anyone, I told her. The truth, though, is that I
didn't let her in. I didn't let Julia in with us, and I
didn't give Camilla any way to make an existence
out of the shadow on the other end of those
morning phone calls. How could I explain to a
shadow about reality?
And now it was too late; I couldn't tell Julia one
week before she returned that I didn't love her
anymore. It was too scary; to cause her that kind
of pain 7,000 miles away. And when she came
back, I couldn't tell her because where would she
go? I was the reason she was moving back here.
We lingered in bed longer and longer in the
mornings, and I started to turn off the ringer on
the phone. Silence is bliss, I thought. Camilla
would kneel over me and let her hair fall on my
bare stomach and brush it back and forth. Horse's
Tail was what it was called, she told me.
"What? You can't be serious," I say. "I can't." I
have an instant vision of me walking around with
a bald patch on the side of my head. A badge say
ing, "Look, I am so in love that I have cut off some
hair for her." The thing that frightens me is that I

want to, I want to pick up the scissors and cut
them all off and hand her a basket filled with my snakes. "Are you sure you would
n't like the plant or maybe this vase?" 1 point to a pottery vase on the bookshelf. As
if it will be bad enough for Julia to be here with a man who doesn't love her, at least
he won't have to be bald as well. I can give her that at least, for the love I had once
felt but is now gone. Something like flowers on a grave.
"No, I don't want anything," she says. "Never mind. It was stupid anyway."
I want to die.
She gets up and goes into the bathroom. When she comes out she is carrying her
hair in one hand and her Swiss Army knife in the other.
"Camilla! Jesus, Camilla — what have you done?" I yell. I can feel a swelling feel
ing inside somewhere between nausea and euphoria.
"It's for her," she says.
"Camilla ..." I don't know what to say. She walks to the center of the room and lets
her hair fall to the ground. Hair-colored hair curling upon the linoleum floor. I look
at her; her new short hair is so uneven that I want to run and kiss her and all the
funny divots of baldness on her skull. But I stay on the sofa.
"Oh, Camilla, why ... "I am defeated. "You didn't have to ..." Have to what? Fall
in love with me. Even though that was exactly what I wanted, after I let you, conning
you into it with hot coffee and kisses.
I feel ashamed and small. I love her and I am throwing her away. I have to cut her
off. For what? Because I didn't want to break anyone's heart, to protect the innocent
so far away. But I have. The sound of her heart breaking is leaking out of the faucet
and driving down the street.
That morning when we woke up I made her
coffee, like I always do, and served it to her in
bed. That afternoon she cut off all her hair and
left it in a pile in the middle of the room.

you into it with hot coffee and kisses.
I feel ashamed and small. I love her and I am throwing her away. I have to cut her
off. For what? Because I didn't want to break anyone's heart, to protect the innocent
so far away. But I have. The sound of her heart breaking is leaking out of the faucet
and driving down the street.
That morning when we woke up I made her
coffee, like I always do, and served it to her in
bed. That afternoon she cut off all her hair and
left it in a pile in the middle of the room.

She asks, "When is she coming?"
We are in my apartment. It is one room which I have divided in two with a zebra
print tapestry that hangs down the middle to separate Passion from Reason. There is
a small sofa I inherited from the landlady. It is on the Passion side of the tapestry.
I say, "In a few days."
We are sitting on the sofa. She is upright, her legs are bent, and her feet are resting
on the coffee table in front of the sofa. I am perpendicular to her, resting my neck on
the arm of the sofa and my legs straight out, smuggled under the teepee of her bent
ones. She is chain-smoking cigarettes and ashing in the coffee cup I brought her ear
lier. The ashes are sticking to the sugary residue at the bottom of the cup. This is what
I love about her. She is irreverent like that.
"God, Miles, I don't know," she says. "This is the worst. I don't know what to do
with myself."
She stub? out her cigarette in the coffee cup and swats at her eyes so I won't see her
tears. I know they are there. She had been crying in her sleep last night. Curled like a
small shrimp next to me, big unconscious tears had been rolling down her face and
dripping into the pillow. It makes me want to crawl into a hole, seeing her like this.
Crying and not crying.
"Listen, Camilla, you are so strong," I offer to her.
I want to tell her how beautiful she is to me. Her hair is long, straight and
brown. Hair-colored hair, she calls it. Sometimes she wears it in pigtails, which
just kills me; she looks so innocent and fun like

that. When I first met her, she told me that she
might be a lesbian but didn't know yet, and I
told her that even if she was she shouldn't cut it
off. It was her best feature.
My hair, it was my hair that I knew she adored.
She had told me that and counted the number of
dreadlocks. It was somewhere between 50 and 60.
She lost count after she had started kissing me on
the back of my neck.
I can hear the traffic passing outside the open
window. I live on a side street that is used as a short
cut to avoid the main traffic. The traffic is constant;
cars revving at the stop sign and then speeding
down the suburban street. The sounds from the
street come in through the window that is open over
there in Reason. I never thought that this would be
happening to me. As if life isn't hard enough.
"I hate the sound of my own heart breaking,"
she says at last. The only thing I can hear is the
traffic and the dripping from the leaky faucet.
We had met at a party thrown by four Amazon
au pair girls that Jan, my research partner, knew.
We were both there, strangers in our own town,
surrounded by these towering German 19-year
olds. Unlikely aliens we were.
Camilla had come up to me first. She had said,
"Hey rasta-man, do you have a light?" Turned out

Anyway, we ended up talking for the rest
of the night, and when the end of the
party came we went back to my place
together. She seemed like that kind of a
girl. You know, comfortable with the fact
the we had only just met. And besides,
she had told me that she was probably
a lesbian but didn't know yet. I think I
pretty much got a hard-on right away
when she said that.

she worked at the same restaurant that my girlfriend had worked at before we met, but
they didn't know each other. Anyway, we ended up talking for the rest of the night,

And besides, she had told me that she was probably a lesbian but didn't know yet. I
think I pretty much got a hard-on right away when she said that.
So after that night, in the morning, 1 had brought her coffee in bed. Julia had told
me once that if I wanted a woman to fall in love with me, I should bring her break
fast in bed. I couldn't remember if 1 had told her about Julia, my girlfriend, who was
studying in England for the year. Camilla said I didn't, 1 thought I did, but I guess it
didn't matter because I brought her the coffee in bed anyway.
"Camilla, you are so beautiful," 1 tell her. "I'll never forget you." She stares straight
ahead. I know she doesn't want to look at me because she'll start crying again.
"Don't tell me that. Don't make me die like that," she whispers. I want to give her
something. That seems to be the right thing to do. Camilla gets up off the sofa and
walks over to the window and stares outside.
"Jesus, everybody drives a fucking car," she says.
Why did I do this to her? Or why, 1 guess I am thinking, did I do this to myself? I
don't want to let her go even though I need to. But what pisses me off is that it is my
own fault. I just sal on the pot and never took a shit. Julia, far away Julia, spending all
her money to call me every day and tell me about her junkie flatmates and how her
eye has begun to bleed, turning it a deep red around her iris. I couldn't tell her, not
over the phone, that I wasn't in love with her anymore.
And Camilla was so patient, all those mornings when the phone rang from

England with Julia on the other end. She would wait patiently for me to finish, read
ing the books on my shelf which Julia had left behind. It was funny, or maybe weird,
or both, but all the things that Julia had given me — a pepper grinder and a papier-
egg that was a rattle — Camilla had noticed. They were things that she had
picked up first in my apartment.
"I want to give you something, Camilla. What can I give you?" I ask her back. I feel
low asking her this. I know what I should give, what I want to give her, but it is im
possible. I look at my things around the room, searching for an object that sums up
me. An icon for her.
"My plant?" I suggest. My small potted plant that I am nurturing along with a small
pot of dirt that I am hoping will sprout something green eventually. Camilla had ex
plained to me very seriously the virtues of talking to plants. She had read that talking
to plants made them grow better. In fact, Prince Charles himself talked to his plants.
"I don't want anything," she says.
She turns around and comes back to the couch and lights another cigarette. "OK,
I know what I want," she says."I want your hair. Not all of it, just some of it. A dread
lock." She looks at me and reaches out to feel my hair. "This one. This is the one I
want," she says, tugging on one over my left ear.
I'm not sure at what point we began to love each other. At first, after that party
with the enormous German girls, we were so careful with each other, trying not to let
the other know that if we could, we would spend the whole day in bed, smoking cig
arettes and licking each other. She would stop by after work — on her way home, she
would insist the minute she walked in the door. But she felt too good to send back
out into the night, and I would insist that she stay.

I told her almost nothing about Julia. She asked
in the beginning if I had any pictures of her, and 1
told her no. It was true. I didn't have any pictures
of anyone, I told her. The truth, though, is that I
didn't let her in. I didn't let Julia in with us, and I
didn't give Camilla any way to make an existence
out of the shadow on the other end of those
morning phone calls. How could I explain to a
shadow about reality?
And now it was too late; I couldn't tell Julia one
week before she returned that I didn't love her
anymore. It was too scary; to cause her that kind
of pain 7,000 miles away. And when she came
back, I couldn't tell her because where would she
go? I was the reason she was moving back here.
We lingered in bed longer and longer in the
mornings, and I started to turn off the ringer on
the phone. Silence is bliss, I thought. Camilla
would kneel over me and let her hair fall on my
bare stomach and brush it back and forth. Horse's
Tail was what it was called, she told me.
"What? You can't be serious," I say. "I can't." I
have an instant vision of me walking around with
a bald patch on the side of my head. A badge say
ing, "Look, I am so in love that I have cut off some
hair for her." The thing that frightens me is that I

want to, I want to pick up the scissors and cut
them all off and hand her a basket filled with my snakes. "Are you sure you would
n't like the plant or maybe this vase?" 1 point to a pottery vase on the bookshelf. As
if it will be bad enough for Julia to be here with a man who doesn't love her, at least
he won't have to be bald as well. I can give her that at least, for the love I had once
felt but is now gone. Something like flowers on a grave.
"No, I don't want anything," she says. "Never mind. It was stupid anyway."
I want to die.
She gets up and goes into the bathroom. When she comes out she is carrying her
hair in one hand and her Swiss Army knife in the other.
"Camilla! Jesus, Camilla — what have you done?" I yell. I can feel a swelling feel
ing inside somewhere between nausea and euphoria.
"It's for her," she says.
"Camilla ..." I don't know what to say. She walks to the center of the room and lets
her hair fall to the ground. Hair-colored hair curling upon the linoleum floor. I look
at her; her new short hair is so uneven that I want to run and kiss her and all the
funny divots of baldness on her skull. But I stay on the sofa.
"Oh, Camilla, why ... "I am defeated. "You didn't have to ..." Have to what? Fall
in love with me. Even though that was exactly what I wanted, after I let you, conning
you into it with hot coffee and kisses.
