### Kiss' by Amina Gautier 
The funny thing about rain is that it's nothing
special unless you haven't had any in a
while. Palo Alto is drier than a witch's tear.
Usually we only get a few trickles at a time.
They drop from the sky like God's spittle.

Tonight it's raining. Real rain. It streaks down my window in rivulets that run into each
other and mate. I go outside so it can streak down my body, closer to my skin than the best
lover and making the cuffs of my pajamas grow heavy and limp.
I would rather be making love, but Adam is already asleep. He comes in, goes straight to
bed, and sleeps for exactly eight hours. His smooth cinnamon-skinned face is sunk deep into
his pillow, and he is sleeping on his stomach to keep from wasting extra energy, snoring. He's
practical like that, even in his sleep. He thinks he's only been given a dropper full of life, and
the thought that he might have let some of it squeeze out unnecessarily is enough to send
him under the covers.
1 already woke him earlier, on the pretense of getting comfortable, rubbing my cold body
against his sleep-warmed one, looking for friendly openings to wedge my toes or knees into.
He grumbled, turned to me, kissed me on my head and scooted over magnanimously to make
more room for me. Great.
So now it's me and the rain, in our own private little love affair. Pre-dawn light conceals us
as I lean against golden brick and feel ridiculously adulterous because no one sees that the
warm drops are the hands, eyes and mouth of my lover. The rain is falling on me like wet
kisses, litde kisses that drop on my skin and slowly roll down like lazy, teasing lips, achingly
familiar like my very first kiss.
In honor of my 13th birthday, my best friend Tawanna was going to get Kenneth to kiss

me."Dag, you spoil all the fun, Nicky. I'm a get Kenneth to give you a kiss. Right on the lips!"
At this revelation, 1 could only say dumbly, "A kiss?" as if I didn't know what one was. But 1
really didn't.
What was a kiss, besides something we saw on sick days home, watching soap operas with
women like Erica from "All My Children" kissing a different man each week? Now, of course
I was old enough to be kissed — or would be tomorrow at any rate, turning from a baby into
a teenager — but I still had not been kissed.
A boy in our class, Johnny, called himself Mister Kisser. He ran around the halls, grabbed
the girls with bathroom passes and kissed them. He pressed them into the water fountain
and stuck his tongue in their mouths. Tawanna and 1 didn't think this could really be true.
Kissing was lips only and even the kids in Special Ed knew that. Kissing was like what you
did with your relatives, but instead of putting your lips to the boy's cheek, you put them to
his mouth. And he put his to yours, and that was it. Kissing. Only it was supposed to be es
pecially good with the somebody you loved. Kenneth was the somebody I loved.
Kenny was able to make anyone feel comfortable around him. It was his smile that did it.
It took a while to spread and widen and once there, it lingered long afterwards as if he was
part of a good joke no one else could get in on.
He was really the only 10th grader to notice me. Our school started in seventh grade and
went up to the 12th because none of our parents wanted to spend their tax dollars on a sep
arate middle school. So we owned our own brand of invisibility. Even though we went to
school with the high school kids, they didn't notice us. Entering the ninth grade was the be
ginning of our existence and since I was not yet there, I was surprised that Kenneth noticed
me. Of course, since 1 helped him with his Latin, he didn't really have a choice.
There are not that many schools in Brooklyn that still teach Latin. It was just my luck to
be in one of the survivors. Latin was as required as Language Arts and Social Studies.
Everyone had to take it, but because many students first came to our school in the ninth
grade, there were different levels. For the last two years, 1 had been in a summer program that
forced Latin, among other things, down my throat until I began to like the taste of it. So 1
was placed in Latin 11. Kenneth was in my class.
