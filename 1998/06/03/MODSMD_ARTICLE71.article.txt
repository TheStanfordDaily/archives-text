### Kiss' by Amina Gautier 
The funny thing about rain is that it's nothing
special unless you haven't had any in a
while. Palo Alto is drier than a witch's tear.
Usually we only get a few trickles at a time.
They drop from the sky like God's spittle.

Tonight it's raining. Real rain. It streaks down my window in rivulets that run into each
other and mate. I go outside so it can streak down my body, closer to my skin than the best
lover and making the cuffs of my pajamas grow heavy and limp.
I would rather be making love, but Adam is already asleep. He comes in, goes straight to
bed, and sleeps for exactly eight hours. His smooth cinnamon-skinned face is sunk deep into
his pillow, and he is sleeping on his stomach to keep from wasting extra energy, snoring. He's
practical like that, even in his sleep. He thinks he's only been given a dropper full of life, and
the thought that he might have let some of it squeeze out unnecessarily is enough to send
him under the covers.
1 already woke him earlier, on the pretense of getting comfortable, rubbing my cold body
against his sleep-warmed one, looking for friendly openings to wedge my toes or knees into.
He grumbled, turned to me, kissed me on my head and scooted over magnanimously to make
more room for me. Great.
So now it's me and the rain, in our own private little love affair. Pre-dawn light conceals us
as I lean against golden brick and feel ridiculously adulterous because no one sees that the
warm drops are the hands, eyes and mouth of my lover. The rain is falling on me like wet
kisses, litde kisses that drop on my skin and slowly roll down like lazy, teasing lips, achingly
familiar like my very first kiss.
In honor of my 13th birthday, my best friend Tawanna was going to get Kenneth to kiss

me."Dag, you spoil all the fun, Nicky. I'm a get Kenneth to give you a kiss. Right on the lips!"
At this revelation, 1 could only say dumbly, "A kiss?" as if I didn't know what one was. But 1
really didn't.
What was a kiss, besides something we saw on sick days home, watching soap operas with
women like Erica from "All My Children" kissing a different man each week? Now, of course
I was old enough to be kissed — or would be tomorrow at any rate, turning from a baby into
a teenager — but I still had not been kissed.
A boy in our class, Johnny, called himself Mister Kisser. He ran around the halls, grabbed
the girls with bathroom passes and kissed them. He pressed them into the water fountain
and stuck his tongue in their mouths. Tawanna and 1 didn't think this could really be true.
Kissing was lips only and even the kids in Special Ed knew that. Kissing was like what you
did with your relatives, but instead of putting your lips to the boy's cheek, you put them to
his mouth. And he put his to yours, and that was it. Kissing. Only it was supposed to be es
pecially good with the somebody you loved. Kenneth was the somebody I loved.
Kenny was able to make anyone feel comfortable around him. It was his smile that did it.
It took a while to spread and widen and once there, it lingered long afterwards as if he was
part of a good joke no one else could get in on.
He was really the only 10th grader to notice me. Our school started in seventh grade and
went up to the 12th because none of our parents wanted to spend their tax dollars on a sep
arate middle school. So we owned our own brand of invisibility. Even though we went to
school with the high school kids, they didn't notice us. Entering the ninth grade was the be
ginning of our existence and since I was not yet there, I was surprised that Kenneth noticed
me. Of course, since 1 helped him with his Latin, he didn't really have a choice.
There are not that many schools in Brooklyn that still teach Latin. It was just my luck to
be in one of the survivors. Latin was as required as Language Arts and Social Studies.
Everyone had to take it, but because many students first came to our school in the ninth
grade, there were different levels. For the last two years, 1 had been in a summer program that
forced Latin, among other things, down my throat until I began to like the taste of it. So 1
was placed in Latin 11. Kenneth was in my class.

The day he asked me for help, I was coming out of Algebra. He bumped into me and
knocked my calculator out of my hand so that the two small batteries spun around on the
ground like crazy.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that," he said, getting down on the ground with me to pick
them up.
"That's all right."
"No really, and I was just getting ready to ask you a favor, too."
A favor. Kenneth wanted something from me. For this boy I would do anything. I would
even give him all my Now and Laters — from Cherry to Bubble Gum to Sour Apple — that
I kept in my bookbag in case of just such an emergency. For Kenneth, nothing was too good.
"What is it?"
'You're Nicole Stephensen, right? Mr. Franklin said I should get you to help me."
"Huh?" I couldn't believe Kenneth would need my help for anything.
"With Latin."
"Oh!"
"Well?"
"Huh?"
"So, will you help me?" He leaned one foot against the wall, looking handsome as he filled
his jacket out, his lips breaking into a full smile that showed off the peach fuzz above his up
per lip and made his dimple peek out at me. "It would really mean a lot."
"Um, yeah. Sure," I said with all the loquacity I could muster under the circumstances. He
was not known to use this smile a lot and I could only wonder that I was lucky enough to be
its full recipient. Tawanna and I talked about that for days.
For six weeks straight, Kenneth and I studied Latin every day at his house. It wasn't that
he was dumb; he just couldn't get his grammar straight. He had everything all mixed up. He
couldn't tell his ablatives from his accusatives, messed up his verb conjugations and didn't
know one declension from another. We made little charts so he could remember the first de
clension singular and plural endings: a, ae, ae, am, a, ae, arum, is, as, is and the imperfect
form of the first conjugation verbs: bam, bas, bat, bamus, batis, bant. I drilled him in these
simple things as I thought of jokes in Latin to make him like it more.
"Semper übi sub übi," I said to him one day, sitting in his kitchen.
"Wha?" His mouth was hanging open so I could get the full view of his half-chewed
Hydrox cookies.
"I said 'Semper übi sub übi.' "
"I know, but what does it mean?"
"What do you think it means?"
"Well sub is the preposition for under, like in subway."
"Right."
"Semper means always."
"Mmhmm. I know you know what übi means."
"It means where. Always where under where?"
"I usually try to."
"Now what are you talking about?" He was thoughtfully chewing.
"I do 'always wear underwear,' " I said. He got it. He laughed so hard I thought the cook
ies were going to come flying out.
"Okay, I get it. Stupid, but funny. Nicky, I think we've been hanging out too much, 'cause
you're starting to get as corny as me."
He put on a serious face when he said this, but his eyes were laughing. Something akin to
admiration glowed in them, admiration for me. 1 shrugged it off as lightly as I could, even
though it was making my toes tingle.
Kenneth and I studied and got to be good friends. Or at least while studying we did. Then,
I was the teacher, and I could say anything I wanted to him. I could tell him he was wrong
and correct him and he would never say a mean word or get upset. He looked to me for the
final answer, he asked me questions and he respected what I had to say. Here, I was not a bony
12-year-old girl well on her way to becoming a nerd. If I was not his superior, I was very close
to his equal.
But in the hallways, I was nothing. I shrank down to the size of a little girl. I was tongue
tied and goo-goo eyed, though this was more my fault than his. He always spoke when he saw
me, but I knew that he was not really seeing me and maybe he never would. He looked at me
and saw his Latin friend. 1 wanted him to look at me and see me as a woman. Maybe I was not
yet as well endowed as many of the other girls, but I was on my way. I knew my body was grow
ing. When fully dressed, I looked into the mirror and noticed how much tighter my tops were
becoming. Unclothed, at night, I felt in the dark to make sure the mirror wasn't lying. No
longer could I stuff all my hair under a baseball cap and be mistaken for a boy. My jeans were
tight because they were filled with hips. Why couldn't he see me like that? That's when
Tawanna came up with the idea of a kiss.
"How are you going to get him to kiss me?" I asked.
"Maybe I won't have to at all. Did you ever think that maybe he hasn't kissed you because
you were too young?"
No, I thought maybe he hadn't kissed me because he hadn't wanted to, but Tawanna's the
ory sounded much better than mine. I latched onto it immediately.
"Maybe he's waiting for your birthday," she suggested. This idea had merit. I was already
of the opinion that my 13th birthday was just short of a national holiday and it made per
fect sense to me that everyone else might think so, too.

Tawanna kept talking and I warmed to her idea. "All I probably have to do is whisper to
him it's your birthday in case he forgot or something, and then that will take care of that!"
She said this and closed her hands together in a big snap. Before me, I could see my life open
ing up toward the sun.
I couldn't wait to get to school that day. I knew that Tawanna wouldn't let me down; I only
wondered if Kenneth would do his part. If there is one thing that 1 learned, it is that girls can
plan and plan, but boys always mess it up. Please, 1 prayed silently all day long, don't let him
mess it up.
All day long in class, I was too nervous to pay attention to anything, and finaJly, after see
ing quadratic functions swimming before my eyes one too many times, I begged to go see
the nurse. Of course, I wasn't really sick. The only thing our nurse would do was check my
forehead. If I didn't have a fever, she'd send me outside to get some fresh air, and if I did have
a fever, I'd get the therapeutic treatment of lying on the sick couch. As I walked down the
empty hall, I let my head hang down low because I knew no one could see me. I was wear
ing a new jean skirt today. My mother had curled my hair last night. This was as good as it
got and Kenneth hadn't even said hello, let alone "Happy Birthday" to me. I had seen him
twice in passing and he'd only nodded and kept going. Even my special lunch of double
chocolate birthday cake couldn't lift my spirits. My head was down so low into my books that
I didn't even see Kenneth's feet until 1 had stepped on them.
He was lounging by a water fountain. This was his free period. Why wasn't he playing
basketball?
"Hey, Nicky."
"Hi, Kenneth. I didn't mean to step on your foot."
"Don't worry about it. I guess that makes us even now."
"Huh?"
"The calculator."
"Oh, yeah," I said, wondering how 1 could manage to swallow all of my intelligence when
ever I was near him at school. Neither he nor I said anything. He was leaning against the wall
with his head cocked to the side. One leg was against the wall and his hands were shoved into
his jacket pockets. His basketball jacket hung on him just right. He looked sophisticated and
important. He had never been more handsome. He was looking at me and I was looking
back, content to be doing just that.
"So anything new today?" he asked. I shook my head. 1 wasn't going to tell him if he did
n't already know.
"You know, all day long I had the feeling that today was gonna be special." At the sound
of that, 1 took a step closer to him.
"1 got up and said, 'Kenneth, today is gonna be a good day.' You know Nicky, I could just
feel it."
He looked at me expectantly and so 1 fed him his line with what felt like a big silly grin
on my face. "Well, did you figure out what was so special about today?"
"Yeah."
"What?" I asked with baited breath.
"1 got an A minus on my Latin exam."
"Oh. That's good, Kenneth. I'm really happy for you," I said, even as I deflated and began
to back up from him. His eyes were laughing at me and I didn't like that at all. i almost told
him his grade was no big deal since I had gotten an A plus. But he pulled me back toward
him by my arms so that my books were crushed up between our chests.
"I couldn't have done it without you, Nicky," he said. I tried to shrug it off because he'd
never touched me before and my breathing was getting labored. "Thank you," he said. He
leaned down and pressed his lips against my forehead very gently. "You're welcome," I man
aged to say, though my voice trembled.
When I finally opened my eyes, he was smiling at me. A real smile. A full smile, his dimple
peeking out on the left side, his lips near enough for me to touch. "That was for the Latin
help," he said and I nodded, thinking he was telling me that was the only reason he kissed me.
"This," he said, running his fingertip alongside my cheek and tilting my chin up in his
hand, "is for your birthday." I opened my mouth in an O of surprise and his lips settled
warmly on mine. They pressed and teased and moved back and forth slowly and opened so
that I breathed his breath, sucking it into me in little puffs and tasting the heat of his mouth.
His tongue slowly rubbed against mine and I captured his taste, tasted him tasting me in a
mixture of sweetness and heat, touching and mingling with silky roughness. I was surprised
about the tongue part, but realized that it could hardly be a kiss without it. His kiss was like
rain, cleansing. I was being bathed in it and I would never be the same again. When he re
leased me to pick up the books that I'd let drop, I was no longer the same. I had been a taste
in his mouth, a flavor on his Hps. 1 was no longer a girl.
There have been many kisses since that one, a good many from Kenneth and many more
from Adam, close-mouthed kisses, open kisses, dry ones, wet ones, stolen ones, forced ones,
begging ones, lying ones, cajoling ones, kisses that tease, selfish kisses, kisses that share, hat
ing kisses, kisses that love, tasting kisses.
Our hearts speak through kisses when we can't find the right words. Adam's skin is sleepy
smooth beneath my closed lips. The tiniest bit of moisture remains on his cheek when I pull
away, evidence that the rain and 1 have kissed him.
The funny thing about rain is that it's nothing
special unless you haven't had any in a
while. Palo Alto is drier than a witch's tear.
Usually we only get a few trickles at a time.
They drop from the sky like God's spittle.

In honor of my 13th birthday, my best friend Tawanna was going to get Kenneth to kiss

me."Dag, you spoil all the fun, Nicky. I'm a get Kenneth to give you a kiss. Right on the lips!"
At this revelation, 1 could only say dumbly, "A kiss?" as if I didn't know what one was. But 1
really didn't.
What was a kiss, besides something we saw on sick days home, watching soap operas with
women like Erica from "All My Children" kissing a different man each week? Now, of course
I was old enough to be kissed — or would be tomorrow at any rate, turning from a baby into
a teenager — but I still had not been kissed.
A boy in our class, Johnny, called himself Mister Kisser. He ran around the halls, grabbed
the girls with bathroom passes and kissed them. He pressed them into the water fountain
and stuck his tongue in their mouths. Tawanna and 1 didn't think this could really be true.
Kissing was lips only and even the kids in Special Ed knew that. Kissing was like what you
did with your relatives, but instead of putting your lips to the boy's cheek, you put them to
his mouth. And he put his to yours, and that was it. Kissing. Only it was supposed to be es
pecially good with the somebody you loved. Kenneth was the somebody I loved.
Kenny was able to make anyone feel comfortable around him. It was his smile that did it.
It took a while to spread and widen and once there, it lingered long afterwards as if he was
part of a good joke no one else could get in on.
He was really the only 10th grader to notice me. Our school started in seventh grade and
went up to the 12th because none of our parents wanted to spend their tax dollars on a sep
arate middle school. So we owned our own brand of invisibility. Even though we went to
school with the high school kids, they didn't notice us. Entering the ninth grade was the be
ginning of our existence and since I was not yet there, I was surprised that Kenneth noticed
me. Of course, since 1 helped him with his Latin, he didn't really have a choice.
There are not that many schools in Brooklyn that still teach Latin. It was just my luck to
be in one of the survivors. Latin was as required as Language Arts and Social Studies.
Everyone had to take it, but because many students first came to our school in the ninth
grade, there were different levels. For the last two years, 1 had been in a summer program that
forced Latin, among other things, down my throat until I began to like the taste of it. So 1
was placed in Latin 11. Kenneth was in my class.

The day he asked me for help, I was coming out of Algebra. He bumped into me and
knocked my calculator out of my hand so that the two small batteries spun around on the
ground like crazy.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that," he said, getting down on the ground with me to pick
them up.
"That's all right."
"No really, and I was just getting ready to ask you a favor, too."
A favor. Kenneth wanted something from me. For this boy I would do anything. I would
even give him all my Now and Laters — from Cherry to Bubble Gum to Sour Apple — that
I kept in my bookbag in case of just such an emergency. For Kenneth, nothing was too good.
"What is it?"
'You're Nicole Stephensen, right? Mr. Franklin said I should get you to help me."
"Huh?" I couldn't believe Kenneth would need my help for anything.
"With Latin."
"Oh!"
"Well?"
"Huh?"
"So, will you help me?" He leaned one foot against the wall, looking handsome as he filled
his jacket out, his lips breaking into a full smile that showed off the peach fuzz above his up
per lip and made his dimple peek out at me. "It would really mean a lot."
"Um, yeah. Sure," I said with all the loquacity I could muster under the circumstances. He
was not known to use this smile a lot and I could only wonder that I was lucky enough to be
its full recipient. Tawanna and I talked about that for days.
For six weeks straight, Kenneth and I studied Latin every day at his house. It wasn't that
he was dumb; he just couldn't get his grammar straight. He had everything all mixed up. He
couldn't tell his ablatives from his accusatives, messed up his verb conjugations and didn't
know one declension from another. We made little charts so he could remember the first de
clension singular and plural endings: a, ae, ae, am, a, ae, arum, is, as, is and the imperfect
form of the first conjugation verbs: bam, bas, bat, bamus, batis, bant. I drilled him in these
simple things as I thought of jokes in Latin to make him like it more.
"Semper übi sub übi," I said to him one day, sitting in his kitchen.
"Wha?" His mouth was hanging open so I could get the full view of his half-chewed
Hydrox cookies.
"I said 'Semper übi sub übi.' "
"I know, but what does it mean?"
"What do you think it means?"
"Well sub is the preposition for under, like in subway."
"Right."
"Semper means always."
"Mmhmm. I know you know what übi means."
"It means where. Always where under where?"
"I usually try to."
"Now what are you talking about?" He was thoughtfully chewing.
"I do 'always wear underwear,' " I said. He got it. He laughed so hard I thought the cook
ies were going to come flying out.
"Okay, I get it. Stupid, but funny. Nicky, I think we've been hanging out too much, 'cause
you're starting to get as corny as me."
He put on a serious face when he said this, but his eyes were laughing. Something akin to
admiration glowed in them, admiration for me. 1 shrugged it off as lightly as I could, even
though it was making my toes tingle.
Kenneth and I studied and got to be good friends. Or at least while studying we did. Then,
I was the teacher, and I could say anything I wanted to him. I could tell him he was wrong
and correct him and he would never say a mean word or get upset. He looked to me for the
final answer, he asked me questions and he respected what I had to say. Here, I was not a bony
12-year-old girl well on her way to becoming a nerd. If I was not his superior, I was very close
to his equal.
But in the hallways, I was nothing. I shrank down to the size of a little girl. I was tongue
tied and goo-goo eyed, though this was more my fault than his. He always spoke when he saw
me, but I knew that he was not really seeing me and maybe he never would. He looked at me
and saw his Latin friend. 1 wanted him to look at me and see me as a woman. Maybe I was not
yet as well endowed as many of the other girls, but I was on my way. I knew my body was grow
ing. When fully dressed, I looked into the mirror and noticed how much tighter my tops were
becoming. Unclothed, at night, I felt in the dark to make sure the mirror wasn't lying. No
longer could I stuff all my hair under a baseball cap and be mistaken for a boy. My jeans were
tight because they were filled with hips. Why couldn't he see me like that? That's when
Tawanna came up with the idea of a kiss.
"How are you going to get him to kiss me?" I asked.
"Maybe I won't have to at all. Did you ever think that maybe he hasn't kissed you because
you were too young?"
No, I thought maybe he hadn't kissed me because he hadn't wanted to, but Tawanna's the
ory sounded much better than mine. I latched onto it immediately.
"Maybe he's waiting for your birthday," she suggested. This idea had merit. I was already
of the opinion that my 13th birthday was just short of a national holiday and it made per
fect sense to me that everyone else might think so, too.

Tawanna kept talking and I warmed to her idea. "All I probably have to do is whisper to
him it's your birthday in case he forgot or something, and then that will take care of that!"
She said this and closed her hands together in a big snap. Before me, I could see my life open
ing up toward the sun.
I couldn't wait to get to school that day. I knew that Tawanna wouldn't let me down; I only
wondered if Kenneth would do his part. If there is one thing that 1 learned, it is that girls can
plan and plan, but boys always mess it up. Please, 1 prayed silently all day long, don't let him
mess it up.
All day long in class, I was too nervous to pay attention to anything, and finaJly, after see
ing quadratic functions swimming before my eyes one too many times, I begged to go see
the nurse. Of course, I wasn't really sick. The only thing our nurse would do was check my
forehead. If I didn't have a fever, she'd send me outside to get some fresh air, and if I did have
a fever, I'd get the therapeutic treatment of lying on the sick couch. As I walked down the
empty hall, I let my head hang down low because I knew no one could see me. I was wear
ing a new jean skirt today. My mother had curled my hair last night. This was as good as it
got and Kenneth hadn't even said hello, let alone "Happy Birthday" to me. I had seen him
twice in passing and he'd only nodded and kept going. Even my special lunch of double
chocolate birthday cake couldn't lift my spirits. My head was down so low into my books that
I didn't even see Kenneth's feet until 1 had stepped on them.
He was lounging by a water fountain. This was his free period. Why wasn't he playing
basketball?
"Hey, Nicky."
"Hi, Kenneth. I didn't mean to step on your foot."
"Don't worry about it. I guess that makes us even now."
"Huh?"
"The calculator."
"Oh, yeah," I said, wondering how 1 could manage to swallow all of my intelligence when
ever I was near him at school. Neither he nor I said anything. He was leaning against the wall
with his head cocked to the side. One leg was against the wall and his hands were shoved into
his jacket pockets. His basketball jacket hung on him just right. He looked sophisticated and
important. He had never been more handsome. He was looking at me and I was looking
back, content to be doing just that.
"So anything new today?" he asked. I shook my head. 1 wasn't going to tell him if he did
n't already know.
"You know, all day long I had the feeling that today was gonna be special." At the sound
of that, 1 took a step closer to him.
"1 got up and said, 'Kenneth, today is gonna be a good day.' You know Nicky, I could just
feel it."
He looked at me expectantly and so 1 fed him his line with what felt like a big silly grin
on my face. "Well, did you figure out what was so special about today?"
"Yeah."
"What?" I asked with baited breath.
"1 got an A minus on my Latin exam."
"Oh. That's good, Kenneth. I'm really happy for you," I said, even as I deflated and began
to back up from him. His eyes were laughing at me and I didn't like that at all. i almost told
him his grade was no big deal since I had gotten an A plus. But he pulled me back toward
him by my arms so that my books were crushed up between our chests.
"I couldn't have done it without you, Nicky," he said. I tried to shrug it off because he'd
never touched me before and my breathing was getting labored. "Thank you," he said. He
leaned down and pressed his lips against my forehead very gently. "You're welcome," I man
aged to say, though my voice trembled.
When I finally opened my eyes, he was smiling at me. A real smile. A full smile, his dimple
peeking out on the left side, his lips near enough for me to touch. "That was for the Latin
help," he said and I nodded, thinking he was telling me that was the only reason he kissed me.
"This," he said, running his fingertip alongside my cheek and tilting my chin up in his
hand, "is for your birthday." I opened my mouth in an O of surprise and his lips settled
warmly on mine. They pressed and teased and moved back and forth slowly and opened so
that I breathed his breath, sucking it into me in little puffs and tasting the heat of his mouth.
His tongue slowly rubbed against mine and I captured his taste, tasted him tasting me in a
mixture of sweetness and heat, touching and mingling with silky roughness. I was surprised
about the tongue part, but realized that it could hardly be a kiss without it. His kiss was like
rain, cleansing. I was being bathed in it and I would never be the same again. When he re
leased me to pick up the books that I'd let drop, I was no longer the same. I had been a taste
in his mouth, a flavor on his Hps. 1 was no longer a girl.
There have been many kisses since that one, a good many from Kenneth and many more
from Adam, close-mouthed kisses, open kisses, dry ones, wet ones, stolen ones, forced ones,
begging ones, lying ones, cajoling ones, kisses that tease, selfish kisses, kisses that share, hat
ing kisses, kisses that love, tasting kisses.
Our hearts speak through kisses when we can't find the right words. Adam's skin is sleepy
smooth beneath my closed lips. The tiniest bit of moisture remains on his cheek when I pull
away, evidence that the rain and 1 have kissed him.
The funny thing about rain is that it's nothing
special unless you haven't had any in a
while. Palo Alto is drier than a witch's tear.
Usually we only get a few trickles at a time.
They drop from the sky like God's spittle.

Tonight it's raining. Real rain. It streaks down my window in rivulets that run into each
other and mate. I go outside so it can streak down my body, closer to my skin than the best
lover and making the cuffs of my pajamas grow heavy and limp.
I would rather be making love, but Adam is already asleep. He comes in, goes straight to
bed, and sleeps for exactly eight hours. His smooth cinnamon-skinned face is sunk deep into
his pillow, and he is sleeping on his stomach to keep from wasting extra energy, snoring. He's
practical like that, even in his sleep. He thinks he's only been given a dropper full of life, and
the thought that he might have let some of it squeeze out unnecessarily is enough to send
him under the covers.
1 already woke him earlier, on the pretense of getting comfortable, rubbing my cold body
against his sleep-warmed one, looking for friendly openings to wedge my toes or knees into.
He grumbled, turned to me, kissed me on my head and scooted over magnanimously to make
more room for me. Great.
So now it's me and the rain, in our own private little love affair. Pre-dawn light conceals us
as I lean against golden brick and feel ridiculously adulterous because no one sees that the
warm drops are the hands, eyes and mouth of my lover. The rain is falling on me like wet
kisses, litde kisses that drop on my skin and slowly roll down like lazy, teasing lips, achingly
familiar like my very first kiss.
In honor of my 13th birthday, my best friend Tawanna was going to get Kenneth to kiss

went up to the 12th because none of our parents wanted to spend their tax dollars on a sep
arate middle school. So we owned our own brand of invisibility. Even though we went to
school with the high school kids, they didn't notice us. Entering the ninth grade was the be
ginning of our existence and since I was not yet there, I was surprised that Kenneth noticed
me. Of course, since 1 helped him with his Latin, he didn't really have a choice.
There are not that many schools in Brooklyn that still teach Latin. It was just my luck to
be in one of the survivors. Latin was as required as Language Arts and Social Studies.
Everyone had to take it, but because many students first came to our school in the ninth
grade, there were different levels. For the last two years, 1 had been in a summer program that
forced Latin, among other things, down my throat until I began to like the taste of it. So 1
was placed in Latin 11. Kenneth was in my class.

The day he asked me for help, I was coming out of Algebra. He bumped into me and
knocked my calculator out of my hand so that the two small batteries spun around on the
ground like crazy.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that," he said, getting down on the ground with me to pick
them up.
"That's all right."
"No really, and I was just getting ready to ask you a favor, too."
A favor. Kenneth wanted something from me. For this boy I would do anything. I would
even give him all my Now and Laters — from Cherry to Bubble Gum to Sour Apple — that
I kept in my bookbag in case of just such an emergency. For Kenneth, nothing was too good.
"What is it?"
'You're Nicole Stephensen, right? Mr. Franklin said I should get you to help me."
"Huh?" I couldn't believe Kenneth would need my help for anything.
"With Latin."
"Oh!"
"Well?"
"Huh?"
"So, will you help me?" He leaned one foot against the wall, looking handsome as he filled
his jacket out, his lips breaking into a full smile that showed off the peach fuzz above his up
per lip and made his dimple peek out at me. "It would really mean a lot."
"Um, yeah. Sure," I said with all the loquacity I could muster under the circumstances. He
was not known to use this smile a lot and I could only wonder that I was lucky enough to be
its full recipient. Tawanna and I talked about that for days.
For six weeks straight, Kenneth and I studied Latin every day at his house. It wasn't that
he was dumb; he just couldn't get his grammar straight. He had everything all mixed up. He
couldn't tell his ablatives from his accusatives, messed up his verb conjugations and didn't
know one declension from another. We made little charts so he could remember the first de
clension singular and plural endings: a, ae, ae, am, a, ae, arum, is, as, is and the imperfect
form of the first conjugation verbs: bam, bas, bat, bamus, batis, bant. I drilled him in these
simple things as I thought of jokes in Latin to make him like it more.
"Semper übi sub übi," I said to him one day, sitting in his kitchen.
"Wha?" His mouth was hanging open so I could get the full view of his half-chewed
Hydrox cookies.
"I said 'Semper übi sub übi.' "
"I know, but what does it mean?"
"What do you think it means?"
"Well sub is the preposition for under, like in subway."
"Right."
"Semper means always."
"Mmhmm. I know you know what übi means."
"It means where. Always where under where?"
"I usually try to."
"Now what are you talking about?" He was thoughtfully chewing.
"I do 'always wear underwear,' " I said. He got it. He laughed so hard I thought the cook
ies were going to come flying out.
"Okay, I get it. Stupid, but funny. Nicky, I think we've been hanging out too much, 'cause
you're starting to get as corny as me."
He put on a serious face when he said this, but his eyes were laughing. Something akin to
admiration glowed in them, admiration for me. 1 shrugged it off as lightly as I could, even
though it was making my toes tingle.
Kenneth and I studied and got to be good friends. Or at least while studying we did. Then,
I was the teacher, and I could say anything I wanted to him. I could tell him he was wrong
and correct him and he would never say a mean word or get upset. He looked to me for the
final answer, he asked me questions and he respected what I had to say. Here, I was not a bony
12-year-old girl well on her way to becoming a nerd. If I was not his superior, I was very close
to his equal.
But in the hallways, I was nothing. I shrank down to the size of a little girl. I was tongue
tied and goo-goo eyed, though this was more my fault than his. He always spoke when he saw
me, but I knew that he was not really seeing me and maybe he never would. He looked at me
and saw his Latin friend. 1 wanted him to look at me and see me as a woman. Maybe I was not
yet as well endowed as many of the other girls, but I was on my way. I knew my body was grow
ing. When fully dressed, I looked into the mirror and noticed how much tighter my tops were
becoming. Unclothed, at night, I felt in the dark to make sure the mirror wasn't lying. No
longer could I stuff all my hair under a baseball cap and be mistaken for a boy. My jeans were
tight because they were filled with hips. Why couldn't he see me like that? That's when
Tawanna came up with the idea of a kiss.
"How are you going to get him to kiss me?" I asked.
"Maybe I won't have to at all. Did you ever think that maybe he hasn't kissed you because
you were too young?"
No, I thought maybe he hadn't kissed me because he hadn't wanted to, but Tawanna's the
ory sounded much better than mine. I latched onto it immediately.
"Maybe he's waiting for your birthday," she suggested. This idea had merit. I was already
of the opinion that my 13th birthday was just short of a national holiday and it made per
fect sense to me that everyone else might think so, too.

Tawanna kept talking and I warmed to her idea. "All I probably have to do is whisper to
him it's your birthday in case he forgot or something, and then that will take care of that!"
She said this and closed her hands together in a big snap. Before me, I could see my life open
ing up toward the sun.
I couldn't wait to get to school that day. I knew that Tawanna wouldn't let me down; I only
wondered if Kenneth would do his part. If there is one thing that 1 learned, it is that girls can
plan and plan, but boys always mess it up. Please, 1 prayed silently all day long, don't let him
mess it up.
All day long in class, I was too nervous to pay attention to anything, and finaJly, after see
ing quadratic functions swimming before my eyes one too many times, I begged to go see
the nurse. Of course, I wasn't really sick. The only thing our nurse would do was check my
forehead. If I didn't have a fever, she'd send me outside to get some fresh air, and if I did have
a fever, I'd get the therapeutic treatment of lying on the sick couch. As I walked down the
empty hall, I let my head hang down low because I knew no one could see me. I was wear
ing a new jean skirt today. My mother had curled my hair last night. This was as good as it
got and Kenneth hadn't even said hello, let alone "Happy Birthday" to me. I had seen him
twice in passing and he'd only nodded and kept going. Even my special lunch of double
chocolate birthday cake couldn't lift my spirits. My head was down so low into my books that
I didn't even see Kenneth's feet until 1 had stepped on them.
He was lounging by a water fountain. This was his free period. Why wasn't he playing
basketball?
"Hey, Nicky."
"Hi, Kenneth. I didn't mean to step on your foot."
"Don't worry about it. I guess that makes us even now."
"Huh?"
"The calculator."
"Oh, yeah," I said, wondering how 1 could manage to swallow all of my intelligence when
ever I was near him at school. Neither he nor I said anything. He was leaning against the wall
with his head cocked to the side. One leg was against the wall and his hands were shoved into
his jacket pockets. His basketball jacket hung on him just right. He looked sophisticated and
important. He had never been more handsome. He was looking at me and I was looking
back, content to be doing just that.
"So anything new today?" he asked. I shook my head. 1 wasn't going to tell him if he did
n't already know.
"You know, all day long I had the feeling that today was gonna be special." At the sound
of that, 1 took a step closer to him.
"1 got up and said, 'Kenneth, today is gonna be a good day.' You know Nicky, I could just
feel it."
He looked at me expectantly and so 1 fed him his line with what felt like a big silly grin
on my face. "Well, did you figure out what was so special about today?"
"Yeah."
"What?" I asked with baited breath.
"1 got an A minus on my Latin exam."
"Oh. That's good, Kenneth. I'm really happy for you," I said, even as I deflated and began
to back up from him. His eyes were laughing at me and I didn't like that at all. i almost told
him his grade was no big deal since I had gotten an A plus. But he pulled me back toward
him by my arms so that my books were crushed up between our chests.
"I couldn't have done it without you, Nicky," he said. I tried to shrug it off because he'd
never touched me before and my breathing was getting labored. "Thank you," he said. He
leaned down and pressed his lips against my forehead very gently. "You're welcome," I man
aged to say, though my voice trembled.
When I finally opened my eyes, he was smiling at me. A real smile. A full smile, his dimple
peeking out on the left side, his lips near enough for me to touch. "That was for the Latin
help," he said and I nodded, thinking he was telling me that was the only reason he kissed me.
"This," he said, running his fingertip alongside my cheek and tilting my chin up in his
hand, "is for your birthday." I opened my mouth in an O of surprise and his lips settled
warmly on mine. They pressed and teased and moved back and forth slowly and opened so
that I breathed his breath, sucking it into me in little puffs and tasting the heat of his mouth.
His tongue slowly rubbed against mine and I captured his taste, tasted him tasting me in a
mixture of sweetness and heat, touching and mingling with silky roughness. I was surprised
about the tongue part, but realized that it could hardly be a kiss without it. His kiss was like
rain, cleansing. I was being bathed in it and I would never be the same again. When he re
leased me to pick up the books that I'd let drop, I was no longer the same. I had been a taste
in his mouth, a flavor on his Hps. 1 was no longer a girl.
There have been many kisses since that one, a good many from Kenneth and many more
from Adam, close-mouthed kisses, open kisses, dry ones, wet ones, stolen ones, forced ones,
begging ones, lying ones, cajoling ones, kisses that tease, selfish kisses, kisses that share, hat
ing kisses, kisses that love, tasting kisses.
Our hearts speak through kisses when we can't find the right words. Adam's skin is sleepy
smooth beneath my closed lips. The tiniest bit of moisture remains on his cheek when I pull
away, evidence that the rain and 1 have kissed him.
