## Mark Farina: 'United DJs of America 9' 
### 
Mark Farina's newest release, "United DJs of America 9" (Moonshine Music), is just about the best introduction to house
music that 1 can think of. The collection is a stellar continuous mix of house. Farina chose his selection of melodic house
well, leaving his 68 minutes almost completely free of slow spots.
Peter Funk's "Dreams of You" and Tim Deluxe's "I Know" highlight the beginning of the CD while tracks 5 through 10 are re
ally the best of the mix. DJ Sneak's "Feel Your Body Talkin" and Mateo & Matos' "Home" tie for my favorite song on the album.
What really makes this compilation work, though, is Farina's touch. Armed with a small collection of samples, he smoothly erases any seams
between songs. Before realizing that one song is over, the next is already into its chonis, making you tap your foot and hum along.
One of Farina's samples declares that they're "taking the disco, mixing with some Crisco, and bringing it back." Not a bad description
of Farina's subterranean style. If that sounds appealing to you, go buy the CD. Hell, even if it doesn't sound appealing, buy the CD any
way.
