# Massive Attack:
## 'Mezzanine' 
### 
This album is split — half sublime, the rest forgettable. Five of
the 11 tracks are classic Massive Attack — innovative trip
hop, piercing voices and real surprises.
"Angel" and "Teardrop" in particular, left me breathless. "Angel"
slowly builds into a tight knot of claustrophobia filled with stubborn
drums and an aching voice. "Teardrop" provides a lilting backdrop to
Elizabeth Fraser's voice, which effortlessly glides through a tune full
of jewels.
Then there's the rest. For some reason, Massive Attack has decided
to emulate the sort of dark dirge exemplified by Nine Inch Nails.
Massive Attack has forgotten how to rap, and it makes a token ges
ture of speaking slowly in couplets. Singer Horace Andy, who has
helped create some of Massive Attack's midas-touch moments, barely
knows what to do with the dull growl of "Man Next Door."
It is difficult to say whether it's worth paying the full price for half
of an exquisite album. Some of these songs could potentially be all
time favorites, but a lot of mediocre baggage comes with them.
