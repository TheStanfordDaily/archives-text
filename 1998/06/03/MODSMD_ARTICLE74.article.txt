# various Artists:
## ‘Lilith Fair: A 						Celebration of Women in Music' 
### 
Lut year's immensely popular Lilith Fair,
organized and headlined by Sarah MacLachlan,
J was designed to be a musical festival that pro
moted not only popular female musicians, but also
lesaer-known female acts.
The compilation CD from that concert tour, "Lilith
Fair: A Celebration of Women in Music," (Arista
Records) continues in that vein. The two-disc set fea
tures live performances by such increasingly popular
performers as MacLachlan, Jewel and Paula Cole. It also
spotlights artists like Dayna Manning and Wild
Colonials, and gives audiences another chance to dis
cover their talent. In terms of musical diversity, the
"Lilith Fair" CD pretty much covers the spectrum.
As for the performances themselves, the quality varies.
Shawn Colvin'i "Trouble" is particularly striking, as is the
Indigo Girls-Jewel-MacLachlan performance of''Water is
Wide." Another surprising standout is Susanna HoflV
Bangle-less version of "Eternal Flame," which sounds re
markably ur-cheesy when performed acoustically.

But then there's Meredith Brooks. Hello? How did
she end up on a concert tour showcasing the talent of
women in music? And even if she fell through the
cracks in that case, how did she get a second chance by
being included on the compilation CD? When her ver
sion of "Wash My Hands" came on, I felt like someone
should be singing the Sesame Street song, "One of
These Kids Does Not Belong Here" in the background.
In terms of the overall success of the CD, MacLachlan
and company fare pretty well. The "Lilith Fair" compila
tion comes off like a big mix of women in music, praise
worthy with only a few exceptions.
The only complaint that the "Lilith Fair" effort war
rants is that a lot of the artists' performances left me
feeling as though they would have sounded a lot bet
ter had I actually been there. But if you couldn't make
it to the actual festival, this compilation CD is defi
nitely the next best thing.
