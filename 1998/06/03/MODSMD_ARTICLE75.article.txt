# The 						Thompson Brothers:
## 'Blame it on the Dog' 
### 
The Thompson
Brothers Band
comes from a
very particular place in
American culture. It's a
place where you drive a
Ford, your girlfriend's

name is Jenny, and your life is red, white and oh-so-blue.
The Heartland, abstraction that it is, has inspired
some of the best American music. Yet, the Thompson
brothers are just so guilelessly upbeat about everything
from break-ups to infidelity, that it is hard to believe
that they are inspired by the same material as were
Springsteen and Neil Young.
The music of the Thompson Brothers Band is best
classified as country, even though these guys are as far
from the gothic intensity of Johnny Cash as they are
from the commercial polish of Garth Brooks. In a word,
they sing with a twang but play jangly Top 40 pop.
Very often this formula works. Songs like "Broken for
Good" and "Caroline" are irresistible with their simple
hooks and goofy charm. Even when they rip off other
people's songs — for example Mellencamp's "Small
Town" on "Don't Mind If I Do" — they do it with such
nonchalance that you can't stay mad.
On the down side, when the guys try to slow it down
("Cry," "8 Million Miles Away"), they sound strained
and out of their element. Emotional depth is as alien to
the Thompson Brothers as it is to the Spice Girls. The
shortcomings of their fresh-faced, GAP-outfitted style
are most glaring when they team up with the grizzled,
whiskey-soaked veteran Steve Earle on "Pick Up the
Tempo."
The problem is not that the Thompson Brothers
Band is bad — they are not — but rather that they
don't really want to be good. This trio is perfectly
happy churning out radio-happy pop and sticky valen
tines. Even though the Thompson Brothers Band at its
best can only approach Hootie and the Blowfish at its
worst, "Blame It on the Dog" (TVT Records) is perfectly
serviceable pop-country, unassuming and sincere.
