# The 						Mavericks: 'Trampoline'
## 
### 
£ The Night Away" starts off The Maverick's sixth album "Trampoline" (MCA Records
■ Nashville) with trumpets and a Latin melody. Lead singer and co-producer Raul Malo even sings
1 S the word "sefiorita" in the chorus. What a deal!

Then "Tell Me Why" slows down the mood. There's a bluesy feel to the music and vocals and a few tortured "aiees" and "na
na nas" thrown in. The mariachi sound returns in"I Should lCnow." The album continues as a mix of elements including the
gospel-tinged "Save A Prayer," and ends with "Dream River," a soft finale complete with ... whistling. Despite the combina
tion of styles, it's all done with a distinctive country twang.
But who's asking for characterization? The entire album sounds like the soundtrack of some Chris Isaak and David Lynch
collaboration of "Elvis Does Hawaii." The opening song indicates that the rest of the album will have a lightness in tone, a
musical sarcasm and playfulness. However, the album's mood shifts immediately after the first song.
Even though "Fool #1" is far from light, it fails to sound intensely passionate or even sincere. However, the flippant songs
"Melbourne Mambo" and "Dolores" shine. Their goofy piano arrangements and cheesy barbershop quartet vocals prove to
be interesting both musically and lyrically. Perhaps The Maverick's brand of tongue-in-cheek artistry is straightforward and
lost to the listener in some songs. Perhaps there is just nothing to interpret.
If The Mavericks wanted to produce an amusing, strangely varied, at times confusing and generally unimpressive album
with a few points of solemn consideration and fewer moments of graceful simplicity, I extend mild congratulations.
