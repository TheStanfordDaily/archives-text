# Far From Home:
## 'Like A Whisper' 
### 
Far From Home, a duo from San Jose, is not concerned with
making any grand artistic or political statements. Made upof
vocalist Kellie Bishop and guitarist Kevin O'Loughlin, Far
From Home is remarkably down-to-earth. "Like A Whisper"
(KNK Music) is a quiet, understated affair, lacking in production
values and perhaps originality. But it makes up for that with
earnestness and wistful melancholy.
Sounding like a sadder and wiser Natalie Merchant, Kelly
Bishop sings about things that are thoroughly ordinary, yet pe
culiarly touching. Whether she reflects on broken dreams in the
lovely opener "Esperanza's Liberation" or messy break-ups in
"He's Gone," Bishop manages to make trite themes sound rele
vant and poignant.
Occasionally, Far From Home's lyrics tend to lapse into inane
self-help jargon (i.e., "Don't you know I feel your pain? / We just
keep placing the blame.") Such slips, however, are thankfully rare.
Overall, the album suffers from the much too sparse
arrangements. Bishop's voice, despite its warmth and intimacy,
is not strong enough to carry off her material all by itself. With
fuller, more lush arrangements, however, Far From Home could
be the new 10,000 Maniacs.
