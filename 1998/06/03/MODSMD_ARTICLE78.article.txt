# The
						B-52’s:
## ‘Time Capsule' 
### 
The B-52's newest release, "Time Capsule" (Reprise Records), is perhaps the most successful greatest
hits album I have ever encountered. The CD, which successfully documents 20 years of hits and
shoulda-beens, leaves absolutely nothing out.
The familiar twanging harmonic voices of Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson have yet to become old hat or
lose their peculiar charm, and Fred Schneider's annoying voice continues to be an essential element in all of
the B-52's pieces. If you enjoyed the B-52's before because of their hilarious lyrics, take some time out to lis
ten to the music one more time. They rock just as hard as fellow new wave bands Blondie and Talking Heads.
B-52's aficionados who've been on hiatus due to lost albums or tapes can rest assured that this set has all
the B-52's songs you need. "Rock Lobster," "Strobe Light," "Private Idaho," "Mesopotamia" plus "Is that you
Mo-Dean?" are all on here. And to all B-52's newbies who've lost their copy of "Cosmic Thing," all the songs
you need are also on here, in addition to all the old songs you've been missing out on. All B-52's fans will be
happy to learn that the CD also has two new songs, "Debbie," — dedicated to Blondie lead singer Debbie
Harry — and "Hallucinating Pluto."
The music of the B-52's will never get old. Let's just hope that this greatest hits album doesn't mean the
end of a great and innovative band.
