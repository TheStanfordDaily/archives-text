# ‘The Last Days of Disco'

### 
While the title of Whit Stillman's latest film may im
ply a "Boogie Nights"-styled bell-bottom fiesta, "The
Last Days of Disco" is actually a dialogue-driven char
acter study that uses dancing and tube tops merely for

scenery. The disco crowd of highly literate, angst-filled and talkative college graduates
is more likely to spend its nights dissecting pop culture and each other than dancing.
This can be slow, but the dry wit and acerbic punchlines of Stillman's script keep the
movie from getting bogged down in dialogue. However, the historical Studio 54-esque
plotlines seem forced.
The protagonists are two recent Hampshire College graduates, Charlotte (Kate
Beckinsale) and Alice (Chloe Sevigny), who are searching for a viable "group social life"
to combat the "ferocious pairing off" that otherwise occurs. This group social life is
found at "tne Club,"the elite and glittering discotheque where the talkfest takes place.
The two women are surrounded by a constantly growing gang of Harvard men,
prompting a good deal of East Coast in-joking and creating the impression that every
single male living in the greater New York area is a Harvard graduate.
Beckinsale is perfect as the bitchy, controlling Charlotte, though her frequent refer
ences to popularity and the like make her seem closer to a high school stereotype than
a fully fleshed-out adult.
But the emotional center of the film is ostensibly found in sweet-natured Alice, who
is often confounded by the confident verbal sparring of the other characters and be
comes the victim of Charlotte's manipulative behavior. However, Sevigny is not given
very much to do except look innocent and forlorn while Beckinsale delivers all the
snappy dialogue, and the multitudinous male characters jostle to get in their two cents.
This leaves a sort of emotional hole in the film, but since plot isn't really the point,
Stillman's script patches it up.
While Alice and Charlotte are the perfectly coiffed visual focus point, Stillman-reg
ular and whining scene stealer Chris Eigeman is the real star of the movie. As Club un
derling Des, Eigeman is a riot, delivering Stillman's carefully honed dialogue with the
perfect rhythm and comic timing. Mackenzie Astin is also fine as Des' beleaguered pal
limmy, who can't gain access to the Club ("Is working for an ad agency a crime?").
But Stillman's decision to close the film with a federal crackdown on the Club is a dis
tracting and unnecessary last-ditch attempt to have a plotline. "Disco" is a gab-fest, a mi
lieu for the super-articulate to kvetch on the psychosexual messages of "Lady and the
Tram.," It shouldn't pretend to be more. Thankfully, for the most part it doesn't even try
— it's just talk.
