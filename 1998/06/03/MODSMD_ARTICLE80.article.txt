## The 						King of Talk Cinema Writer/director/producer Whit Stillman 
### Cat Loerke Contributing writer 
In person, Whit Stiilman is as articulate and garrulous as the characters whose di
alogue he has created in his films — "Metropolitan" (1990), "Barcelona" (1994) and
most recently, "The Last Days of Disco." Though he doesn't admit to any overzealous
autobiographical tendencies, Stiilman is himself a Harvard graduate who worked at
a publishing house in New York and spent time in Barcelona — all of which are char
acteristics that also describe the characters in his latest film. Though not a regular at
Studio 54 during the late '70s, Stiilman has loosely incorporated some of his experi
ences during the time period into "Disco."
"Disco" is perhaps Stillman's most widely publicized and promoted film to date.
When questioned about his feelings regarding the surge in finance and publicity fun
nelled into independent moviemaking, Stiilman said that most of the changes were
positive but that increased studio control could be harmful to independents. Stiilman
seemed unfazed by the publicity, crediting "the building of the last two films" in the
minds of the public and the industry as well as "the disco subject matter."
The disco setting of the film seems oddly trendy for a Stiilman project, but it be
comes less so when one considers the length of time the writer / director / producer
spent preparing it. Stiilman began work on "Disco" some time before the 70s craze
hit Hollywood, and he hopes that audiences don't have expectations for a "Saturday
Night Fever"-esque film focusing on dancing or winning contests. He referred to the
era as "a backdrop," saying, "The film is really about the characters." In talking to him
it was clear that he is passionate about the film as a character study.
For example, Stiilman envisioned the character of Charlotte in "Disco" to be par
ticularly complex. He instructed Kate Beckinsale — an actress Stiilman described as
"brilliant" — to portray the often mean-spirited Charlotte as having a "big personal
ity." Alice's naivete creates a "character whose whose innocence makes her more ac
cessible to the audience."
It is impossible not to notice that Stiilman has focused on a particular subgroup
in all three of his films — the college-educated, literate, analytical and angst-filled.
When asked if he would continue this focus, Stiilman replied firmly in the negative.
He views "Disco" as a "promise to the audience that this is the final exploration of
these characters." The films together act as a "trilogy," with "Disco" falling chrono
logically between the first two films. Several characters from the previous movies
have cameo appearances in "Disco."
For his next project, Stiilman is tackling something altogether new — a historical
period piece, set in the time preceding the American Revolution. "It's time for a good
Whig hero," Stiilman joked, though the film itself is a long way off. Currently writing
the script, Stiilman considered conducting some background research in Palo Alto
but was convinced by his wife to go to Paris instead.
Stiilman considered making screen adaptations of several books before deciding to
work on an original script. He said that he came close to adapting Arthur Golden's
"Memoirs of a Geisha," but the project ended up with Steven Spielberg. "I couldn't re
ally feel bad," Stiilman said. "After all, if you're going to lose a project, you might as well

lose u 10 me King.
The director's rise in
Hollywood can be cred
ited to his own brand of
moviemaking. He was
nominated for a Best
Original Screenplay
Academy Award for
"Metropolitan," an honor

he said he "didn't stand a chance" of winning. And this on a film where he didn't even have an assistant director. He
said, "I was doing all that myself."
Besides the three infamous films films, Stillman's only other directing venture has been an episode of the televi
sion series "Homicide." "I hadn't seen [the show] before I did it,"he said. What inspired such a venture? Practice.
Stillman said that his thinking ran along the lines of, "I've heard [the show is] good; I haven't shot anything in a long
time." Since he spends such a protracted time writing his scripts, there is quite a bit of time between his final take and
his next opening shot.
Stillman's films bring to life worlds of talk where everyone is witty, biting and beyond articulate. In talking about
his own interviews and discussions, he seems to divide the world into people who "get it"and those who do not. For
a filmmaker who is as witty and talkative as his multitudinous ensembles, Whit Stillman clearly gets it Determining
exactly what "it" is requires an entirely separate discussion — maybe in the next screenplay.
