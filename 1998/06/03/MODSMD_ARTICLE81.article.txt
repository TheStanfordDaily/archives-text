# All in the family
## 'The Hanging Garden' makes dysfunction a household term 
### 
C f"T"lhe Hanging Garden" is not a dark comedy, though it is funnier than
many big-name comedies that deal with subjects that are quite grave.
Although it is sad and disturbing at times, it is also uplifting; you will not
leave the theater depressed.
The movie is about a highly dysfunctional family and the people in it — how they evolve
(or do not) and how they cope. At the helm of the family is a physically abusive alcoholic fa
ther, Whiskey Mac (Peter MacNeill), who puts more care into his garden than his children.
Whiskey Mac's 350-pound, 16-year-old son Sweet William (Troy Veinotte) is
caught during his first homosexual experience near his rural Nova Scotian home.
Willie's mother, Iris (Seana McKenna), tries to "set him straight" while the boy he
is caught with abandons him. Despondent, Willie attempts to kill himself in his fa
ther's prized garden. Then he runs away.
He returns 10 years later when his sister, Rosemary (Kerry Fox), is to be wed in
the garden. The family is shocked to see that William is now a thin, healthy and
openly gay man (Chris Leavins). Back at home, he relives his past in visions and
dreams and tries to come to terms with it.
His family has aged — his grandmother is happily senile yet still religious, and
the dog is old and blind yet still faithful. His sister is still a free-spirited foul-mouth,
and his parents are still, well, his parents. Now they have a new child, the tomboy
Violet, who they've raised in the same home William grew up in. Oh, and his high
school "friend" still seems interested, though not just in William.
They have all lived in the same environment they've always known while Willie
transformed himself in the city. The past, however, has ghosts that William must deal
with, and the present has surprises that rock foundations of the entire family.
The film's imagery — floral and religious — is beautiful, haunting and symbolic. The
film was written, directed and produced by Thom Fitzgerald, who said, "In my heart I cre
ated 'The Hanging Garden' to put out the message to unhappy people that no matter how
much you hate your life and yourself in the current moment, it is possible to become the
person you want to be, so hang in there." The film and message are both inspiring.
