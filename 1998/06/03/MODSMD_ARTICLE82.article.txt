# Jim Carrey, seriously
## 'The Truman Show' gets high ratings 
### 
Imagine your life is a sitcom, and all the people you know are actors playing
along. Even your idyllic suburban "Seahaven" is not really an island hometown.
It is in fact the largest movie set in the world. The "sunrise" can be summoned
by a special effects crew. When you talk to your best friend, he's speaking lines de
livered to him by a director. Every element of your life has been scripted.
But you have no idea about any of this.
That's the reality for Truman Bur bank (Jim Carrey) in the new movie "The
Truman Show." Truman has been adopted by a television show and filmed by
thousands of hidden cameras since his days in the womb. His life is the world's
most-watched television show; it has been so successful that it has been broadcast
live all over the world, uninterrupted for 30 years.
Truman's troubles occur when he wants to leave Seahaven in search of Fiji and
the woman he loves. Unfortunately, his life is constantly monitored by a television
crew that controls the bus lines, radio, television and newspapers that enter the
town. They make it virtually impossible for Truman to leave. And they have no mo
tivation to let him leave, since his new disillusionment is causing a surge in ratings.
"The Truman Show" has moments that are incredibly funny, and it's interest
ing to see the creation of this pseudo-world. In spite of its glib nature, "The
Truman Show" is a not another excuse for Carrey to dazzle audiences with his talk
ing butt or his bizarre human sound effects. It's the story of Truman's fight against
the corporate intent to abuse him as his ratings skyrocket.
Carrey reportedly took home $12 million for this picture — low by his stan
dards. Perhaps he was desperate to prove that he could star in a serious piece as
well as a comedic one. He demonstrates here that he can deliver a range of emo
tions and carry a picture well enough to exist without the comic antics showcased
in "Ace Ventura" and "Dumb and Dumber."
