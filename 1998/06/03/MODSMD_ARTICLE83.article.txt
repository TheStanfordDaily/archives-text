# Chris Farley's last stand-up
## 'Almost Heroes' almost falls flat 
### 
At times raucously original and infectious, "Almost Heroes" ends up being a
mixed bag that serves primarily as a swan song to Chris Farley. While several
of the film's comedic attempts are memorable, others only fall flat as insipidly
inane and gross. But we are once again reminded that Farley, the star of "Tommy
Boy" and "Saturday Night Live," will no longer grace the big screen with his super
sized persona.
"Almost Heroes" is a bit of revisionist history that our textbooks have seemingly
overlooked. You see, and Clark were not the first to reach the Pacific Ocean —
it was Bartholomew Hunt (Farley) and Leslie Edwards (Matthew Perry).
Edwards and Hunt are the classic Laurel and Hardy combination. Edwards is a se
rious, cultured, foppish socialite looking for success; Hunt is a rugged, wizened,
lighthearted alcoholic who knows his way around the back country. Throughout the
film, one of them comes to the rescue of the other. In one instance, Hunt attempts
to retrieve an egg from the nest of a psychotic eagle to save Edwards' life. Even
though these heroic acts do not always go smoothly, Edwards and Hunt ultimately
realize that they make a great team.
Along the Missouri River, Edwards and Hunt pick up a rag-tag bunch of recruits
to help them in their quest to overtake Lewis and Clark's entourage. Among them is
Guy Fontenot (Eugene Levy), a Frenchman with a penchant for biting people's ears
off, and Bidwell (David Packer), a hard-luck loser who loses a leg to a savage bear and
an ear to Fontenot's razor-sharp teeth.
As crazy as this seems, "Almost Heroes" actually manages to push the limits of
comedy even further. Some of the gags are laden with bathroom and sexual humor
that isn't appropriate in this particular movie. For example, one of the adventurers
tells a story about how he had eaten two pieces of sheep dung in his stew.
Postcolonial America may not strike the history student as very comical and en
tertaining, but "Almost Heroes" almost pulls off this feat, especially for the benefit of
Chris Farley fans.
