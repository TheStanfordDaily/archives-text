# Going postal the Nordic way
## Sneak a peek in 'Junk Mail' 
### 
A small, low-budget film will often be overlooked
in the midst of summer blockbusters like
"Godzilla" and "Armageddon." Mass audiences

are not likely to meet the nosy and unkempt mailman from "Junk Mail," the latest ex
port from the Norwegian movie industry. While this latest bit of entertainment fal
ters with an ambiguous and nonsensical final 20 minutes, it still provides an irrever
ently humorous view on voyeurism, love and criminality.
Roy, played admirably by newcomer Robert Skjaerstad, is the Peeping Tom in
question. He falls squarely into the heart of a tangle of deceit — and a whole lot of
money. On one of his sprees into others' lives, he sneaks into a woman's apartment
and eventually prevents her from committing suicide. Apparently the lady, named
Line (Andrine Saether), and her partner in crime Georg (Per Egil Aske) had planned
to steal a fortune in Norwegian krones. Roy becomes too involved in the crime and
belatedly realizes that curiosity indeed kills the cat
"Junk Mail" makes it a point to showcase just how disgusting Roy can be. He
showers by using a faucet and old soap, he eats other people's morning cereal, and he
wears unwashed clothing — quite the charming man. In actuality, the portrayal of
the life of a postal worker living in poverty works well with the audience, as we al
ternate between cheering him on and cringing at his mannerisms.
Geverly enough, "Junk Mail" finds a way to bring action sequences and comedy
bits into what boils down to a simple story. The attempts at karaoke in a sleazy bar
are handled comically, while Roy's feeble attempts to flee an angry Georg are shot in
a wonderfully un-Hollywood manner.
But in trying to be unique, "Junk Mail" may have gone overboard by ending too
abruptly. After the concluding minutes of the movie passed, my first thought was,
"Huh?" It left a bad impression, especially since I had only been mildly pleased with
what I had already seen on the big screen. Still, junk it is not, and should an urgent
need to see an art house film arise, "Junk Mail" may just do the trick.
