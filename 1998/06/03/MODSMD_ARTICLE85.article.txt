# 27-word fiction
## 27-word fiction winners! 
### 
Well. This is the end. It has been a wonderful time, everyone. Thanks to every
one who submitted, whether you were published or not. Thanks to everyone for
reading, thanks to everyone for your comments.
The Stanford community has managed to turn a silly idea into a true art form.
Particular congratulations go to Ilias Chrissochoidis, purplebunny, Patrick Smith
and Brad Bartanen 79 for pushing 27-word boundaries to the limit.

These are the best of the best. Some were previously published and some are
new. Some of the entries are confusing, some of them are politically misinformed,
but they are all fun reads. Get offended if it turns you on, but it really isn't worth
the trouble. Thanks for reading and laughing with us.
â€” The editors
