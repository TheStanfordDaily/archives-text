CARRYING
THE FLAME:
Local resident

1984 Olympic
torch as it

Highway.
Palisadian-Poat
To be the best, that is our goal today,
To strive for victory and nothing less,
With anxious hearts out on the court we go,
To fight courageously, we ask each one
Of ourselves to dig down deep inside,
And find that extra something hidden,
Within the sinews of our pride, and hope
That it will be enough, God knows we have
Tried to prepare ourselves in body, Mind
This moment, ours to cherish and to rise
To challenge our opponent and our own
Determination. Why? To win the prize
We all have dreamed of in our minds but now
It's time to grasp what we've been seeking, Now
It's time to take that final step towards greatness,
Or die like soldiers trying to become
Men from boys who still remember the first
Time they held that ball within their immature
Hands, or felt the ecstasy of winning
A game they played because it was fun.
On one another we depend, we trust
As teammates do, unequivocally, may
We be cigar smoking champions on
May third, the last men standing solid and
Unbreakable in spirit and desire.
Separate but one we are invincible,
The strength of the chain is found in the link,
And the strength of the link is found in the
Chain.
