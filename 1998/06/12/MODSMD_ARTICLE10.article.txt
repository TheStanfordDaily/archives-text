•SEPTEMBER
Two hundred fifty members of the media
barraged the University as the presidential
family brought its only daughter to campus. It
was President Clinton's first appearance at
Stanford.
The Class of 2001 had an experience like
no other, having to pass through metal detec
tors and wear special badges to see I 'niversi
ty President Gerhard Casper's Convocation.
•OCTOBER
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak filed
her first grievance protesting her tenure de
nial at the deans' level in the School of Hu

Sawislak, a specialist in American labor histo
ry-
Business Prof. Emeritus Myron Scholes
was awarded the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize
in Economic Sciences for his role in the devel
opment of a widely applied pricing formula
for options.
Physics and Applied Physics Prof. Steve
Chu raised the number of this year's winners
to two when he won the Nobel Prize in
Physics. This is Stanford's third physics Nobel
Prize in three years. Chu won it for devising a
method for trapping and cooling atoms that
allows them to be studied more closely.
"I'm really not a great physicist," Chu said.
"I'm the same guy I was yesterday."
In his annual State of the University ad
dress, Casper introduced his new Presidential
Lectures and Symposia in the Humanities
and Arts, which brought artists Christo and
Jeanne-Claude and critic Harold Bloom to
campus, among others. He also announced a
$12-million initiative to add four new profes
sorships in the humanities and arts.
•NOVEMBER
Stanford emerged victorious in the Sand Hill
Road battle when voters on November 4 ap
proved its Measure O, giving it permission to
expand Sand Hill and Ouarrv Roads to four
lanes within Palo Alto city limits and extend
them both to El Camino Real.
ITie University will now spend $342 mil
lion over five years to implement its plan,
which includes building 1,100 units of housing
for senior citizens, faculty and staff along Sand
Hill. It also has plans for expanding the Stan
ford Shopping Center by 80.000 square feet.
A hallmark of the Big Game since its in

ception in the early 19(X)s. the Lake Lagunita
bonfire was given the ax this fall for the fifth
straight year. The cancellation came on the
heels of a recent study that concluded there
was no way to continue the tradition without
harming the tiger salamander, an endangered
species that lives in the lake bed.
The 100 th Big Game had to settle for a 4-
cubic foot version in Arrillaga Amphitheater.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal football team de
feated UC-Berkeley by a narrow margin of 21 -
20, snapping a five-game losing streak before a
sellout crowd of 85,(XX) at Stanford Stadium.
•DECEMBER
Housing applications were made available
to all unhoused Greek organizations, includ
ing sororities, who have not been housed
since 1944.
•JANUARY
Provost Condoleezza Rice announced
that Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven would be stepping down from his po
sition in the spring. Shoven said he will return
to teaching and research upon completion of

•FEBRUARY
El Nino left the campus reeling, flooding
streets and University buildings. The Row be
came a water park as students rafted down
Campus Drive on mattresses and rolled down
slippery slopes in garbage cans.
Classes and midterms were canceled as
students, faculty and administrators fought to
recover from the water damage. Green Li
brary, Jonsson Library of Government Docu
ments, Cubberley Auditorium and Braun
Music Center were submerged in up to 2 feet
of water.
Hundreds of student volunteers showed
up in the middle of the night to help in the
Green Library rescue efforts. By 11:30 a.m., a
total of 3.(XX) boxes of materials had been
moved to higher ground.
"It was very gratifying to see; the Universi
ty was in a time of need ... and students ral
lied to help," said Dean of Student Affairs
Marc Wais.
However, the Hooding still damaged
120.(XX) books from Green — most of which
have been saved using a freeze-dryingprocess
— and 10,000 recordings at the Braun
Archive of Recorded Sound.
•MARCH
Residential Education Director Jane Ca

marillo announced that the Delta Delta
Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta sororities
would be housed in ATO and Alpha
Sigma, respectively.
This was a marked victory for those who
had fought for the return of sorority hous
ing after 56 years. However, it was a signif
icant loss for those in the Alpha Sig com
munity, and a huge uproar immediately fol
lowed. Protests and petitions were filed,
charging that the administration had not
done enough to solicit student input in de
ciding which houses would go to sororities.
•APRIL
After both Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven and Provost Rice declined
to reverse the decision on Sawislak's appeals,
she filed another one to President Casper and
the Advisory Board of the Academic Council
for a final review of her case in April.
"1 have no doubt that she should have got
ten tenure," said History Prof. George

Fredrickson. "She has a very strong case."
Her tenure denials and rejected appeals
spurred student mobilization across campus,
and more than 1(X) protesters marched in
White Plaza to protest the lack of faculty di
versity on campus.
A bittersweet farewell was bid to Alpha
Sig's last Exotic Erotic Ball, where hundreds
of scantily clad party goers went to experience
the debauchery honored in Rolling Stone
maga/ine as one of the top college parties in
the nation.
•MAY
The Anthropology Department's appli
cation to the Provost's Office to split into
two departments was approved. The issue
of dividing into cultural and social anthro
pology and anthropological sciences was
scheduled to go before the Board of
Trustees in June.
The Stanford Alumni Association
Board of Directors voted unanimouslv to

become part of the University. The merger
will be put to a final vote by the associa
tion's 72.CKX) members this summer.
More than 8(X) graduate students were left
unhoused after the spring housing lottery.
More than I.(XX) attended a rally for housing
less than a week later, calling for several Uni
versity policy changes, including more flexible
move-in and move-out dates and buying
more off-campus propertv.
•JUNE
Gwendolyn Dean was chosen to fill the
half-time directorship position at the Lesbian,
(lav and Bisexual Community Center.

Physics and. by courtesy, a professor of
electrical engineering. Psychology Prof
Ellen Markman will become the new asso
ciate dean for the social sciences.
