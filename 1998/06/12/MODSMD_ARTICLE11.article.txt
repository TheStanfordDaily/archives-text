## Learning to like oversized opportunities 
### 
My time at Stanford is over — and
what truly striking years they
were.
It seems nearly impossible that three full
years have passed since I first arrived on the
Farm as a timid, wide —eyed international
transfer student. Distinct in my memory is
how 1 had forever waved my parents good
bye, down the long steel escalator at the
Tokyo International Airport, the two large
suitcases at my sides creating a pain in my
arms that somehow helped ease the small
ache I was feeling elsewhere.
How my mind had danced with opti
mistic anxiety and bursting hope of the
completely new life starting across the Pa
cific. These emotions are all too clear in my
mind — too fresh, it seems, for my under
graduate years to be over.
But when I reflect on everything that has
happened tome here — all that I've done or
tried to do, all the friends I've made and the
accomplishments and downfalls we thrived
through together — I see that the years
have passed, and the time has indeed come
to graduate.

-1 had been so lost when I first arrived at
Stanford. Having just ended my career as a
competitive athlete of 15 years, I could not
see — for the first time in my life — where 1
was going. The dream to someday become
the best in a sport I loved so much — this
goal had always held and guided me
through the complex decision —making
processes of life. I was clueless and scared
without the single goal I knew I had to be
working for every waking hour.
While starting up in a new place is often
tough, starting one without direction is par
ticularly difficult.
Hut I could not possibly have chosen a
better place to start the many wonderful
days of soul-searching experiences to come.
My vulnerable and insecure stage in life al
lowed me to soak up every little detail,
every word uttered and each idea discussed,
the diversity of cultures, backgrounds and
interests circulating in my new environ
ment. The gorgeous Stanford campus —
burgeoning with its energetic students and
challenging faculty from all over the world
— was indeed the golden place to start

afresh.
One of my first memorable Stanford
moments came when I met a top-level var
sity swimmer who earnestly spoke of his
plans to become a physician in his parent's
native land, where medicine is not at the
level it should be and where there is always
a shortage of doctors.
While 1 admired him for his beliefs and
long-term vision. 1 was also ashamed at how
narrow-minded I had been. 1 couldn't re
member thinking seriously about — or
worse yet — having really cared about any
thing else but training during my time as an
athlete.
Without my blinkers, everything and
everybody was shockingly interesting and
tugged at my growing curiosity. For the first
time, I found myself being influenced — not
just stimulated — by the people around me.
Through the tens of thousands of new faces,
ideas and values, I was able to start redis
covering the world — as well as myself — in
a completely different way, seeing life in a
wholly different view.
I no longer miss life as a Japanese na

tional figure skater. No longer am I scared
to be standing alone outside the competi
tive but small and protected world of figure
skating, nor the fairly uniform Japanese so
ciety.
Life on and off the Farm has taught me
to wander aimlessly in search of goals, and
to love every minute of the way. It's OK if
you aren't always able to take confident
strides, as long as you make little steps ven
turing in all directions. Knowing exactly
where to go or where you're headed is not
always possible, and being lost is fun if you
have the right mindset to search.
Stanford has helped me contemplate
what truly makes me happy by putting forth
unlimited opportunities. The numerous
paths that lay before me on the Farm has
taught me to have multiple interests and to
strive for the many ambitions close to the
heart. Only Stanford, with its flexible and
nurturing — yet multi-dimensionally chal
lenging— atmosphere could have done this
for me.
After three years of looking, I now know
once again what 1 want to be working for.

But should I be lost again — and 1 am sure
it will happen many times throughout life
— I know that I'll be OK. I leave Stanford
with the knowledge that I am no longer
afraid to be lost. Stanford has armed me
with the confidence that whatever I do,
wherever I go, I can strive to be happy.
Some of my greatest joys of life so lar have
taken place here, and I know they will serve
as guides to even more and greater joys I've
yet to experience.
I think about who, what and where I was
and where I stand today, in my cap and
gown. I am still the same wide-eyed kid who
will soon embark on a new journey with
nothing but two oversized suitcases. But ac
companying the pile of books, clothes and
memories this time is the knowledge that
life is a continuous race of fun challenges to
ward new aspirations. And Stanford has
given me a starting push — confidence and
friends with which to run with.
