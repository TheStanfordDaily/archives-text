## Exploring the various shades of farewells 
### 
My friend Sam came over last week
to show me the rainbow that hov
ered, one end dangling over the
Escondido Village high-rises and the other
over my wing of Mirrielees. The sun splin
tered in that 8 p.m. way, sinking, not yellow
anymore, its fire light changing the color of
everything it landed on.
Gray rain clouds permeated parts of the
rainbow, making it musky, skunk-like, dark
ening the tone of the colors. The arch ROY-
G-BlVed its glory onto the misting air,
checkered sun lighting the earth.
We stood watching it, chatting. "How
many finals do you have? Which day do you
finish?" We became absorbed in our conver
sation, thinking about papers and work and
graduating.
The sun dropped behind the buildings,
and we watched the rainbow fade into the
pewter-bowl sky.
At the beginning of this year, I decided
that with everything I had set out to accom
plish, both academically and extracurricular

ly, including going abroad, editing The Daily
and being an RA, I wouldn't be able to finish
in four years. I planned to stay a fifth year at
Stanford and get a coterminal master's de
gree.
So now, while most of my friends are start
ing real-world jobs in the fall or heading off to
graduate school, I am spending another year
on the Farm.
This minimizes the bittersweet feeling
that surrounds graduation: I'm not saying
goodbye to campus, nor to my favorite pro
fessors, and not seeing the flowers around
Campus Drive for the last time.
I haven't taken my last exam, or hiked 10
minutes late to class for the last time. I'll still
work at The Daily, still get onto the Stairmas
ter at the Tresidder Fitness Center and still
burn my tongue on coffee from the CoHo.
I'm pretending to graduate, of course,
planning to act silly with my Draw group in
the Wacky Walk, attending the end of the
year senior events and walking through my
department's ceremony. But really. I'm not

leaving.
Saying goodbye to my friends is the only
hard part. And I'm pretending about that,
too.
The thought of never seeing someone
again, or even worse, not actually caring
enough about the person to make an effort to
see them later in life, is just way too sad for
me.
At my high school graduation, instead of
saying goodbye, I found myself saying,
"Well, I'll see you soon." or ' I'm sure I'll see
you around." Goodbye is too permanent. So
I tricked myself into believing that nothing
was changing. If I'm not leaving, maybe no
one else is either.
This is kind of true. Many of my friends
have found jobs near Palo Alto or in San
Francisco. If I make an effort to visit them, or
they miss Stanford. I will see them. Friends
that are going far away I'll see too. We'll
come back for reunions, and I have odd
karma with bumping into familiar people in
strange cities.

The "I'll see you again" trick isn't bad.
Graduation is supposed to be a celebration of
achievements, not a time to be sad.
What I am actually saying g(x>dbye to is a
period of my life with a certain group of peo
ple. The times I have shared with these
friends and in this place are ending.
In the past four years. I have written SLE
papers in a single night, kissed more people
than I can remember at Full Moon on the
Quad, knocked potted plants off my second
story windowsill and bought dorm-rtH>m
goldfish that have died within days.
I have hopped spontaneously through a
succession of fountains after my finals, al
most crashed into a barn owl while jogging
the Dish at night, eaten Moons Over My
Hammy at Denny's at 3 a.m., skinnv-dipped
in the viscous river that flows through the city
of Moscow. Russia and smoked shisha from a
hooka in Cairo with my roommate. 1 have
played Trivial Pursuit at late-night cabals,
driven the hard copy of the next days Daily
to the San Jose printer in my pajamas, and

fallen madly in love with a campus newspa
per when 1 didn't know I was interested in
journalism.
1 watched a rainbow with my friend Sam.
My life will be different after graduation. 1
am staying the same for a while, but the peo
ple I made memories with will be gone, or
changed. Some will still be around, and we'll
learn to be friends in new places.
But saying goodbye relegates the memo
ries to somewhere distant, too far away. I am
not ready to forget the triends I love, and the
school where we grew close.
Even though this rainbow, muted and
gray in some areas, bright and variegated in
others, has faded, the sky's palette is still
there, potent from the drizzle. More rain
bows to watch, more memories to make.

celebrating the infinite jest.
