## Taking a piece of Stanford with no regrets 
### 
It was Halloween, and 1 was dressed up as
a sailor. Gautam Prabhu was an Indian,
Josh Koons a construction worker. Dale
Yu a policeman, and Benton Fong was a
leather-clad hiker. We were the Village Peo
ple, and we were headed to the Mausoleum
Party. Thousands of people were swarming
in a sea of lights emitted by the 20-foot video
screens amid loud music. Their energy elec
trified me. All of a sudden. 1 felt an unex
plainable sense of belonging, of connection
to these people who have put aside their
midterm studies to join in the celebration.
"Come on, ask them to play YMCA.' "
Benton apparently was also getting into the
spirit of things. So we squeezed our way
through to the DJ and I made the request.
Looking at our outfits, he agreed on the con
dition that we get up and dance on the stage.
So we did. Lined up facing the cheering

crowd, my friends and I jumped, yelled and
spelled out the letters. It did not matter that
we did not know when to turn or even keep
pace with each other. We were freshmen.
When 1 was making the decision to come
to school here. I read in a brochure that the
experience of going to Stanford is like taking
a drink from a fire hydrant. To an outside ob
server, that analogy holds true.
After all, Stanford does offer an incredi
ble variety of opportunities. In the past four
years. I have taken classes in disciplines rang
ing from philosophy to economics to opera
tions research. I have interacted with Nobel
Prize laureates and national political leaders.
I've skipped lectures by world-renowned
scholars to finish an after-dinner conversa
tion with a friend. Of course, I have also worn
shorts to class in February. But when I remi
nisce about my four years here, I think of the
Mausoleum Party. I fondly recall monopoliz

ing the space on the numerous sheets of
butcher paper dubbed "The Burbank
Quotables." 1 can still feel the excitement of
returning from class to engage in philosophi
cal discussions over lunch. When 1 think of
Stanford. I think of the naivete of the fresh
man year — when I reveled in being a part of
a community of explorers, seekers and ideal
ists.
As time went on. the illusion of the "Stan
ford bubble" began to wear off. I started
worrying about grades, majors, summer in
ternships and post-graduation plans. I
stopped going to house meetings and made
regular pilgrimages to Green Library in
stead. Stanford became a springboard to big
ger and better things.
Now a graduating senior. I have come full
circle. My academic efforts have paid off: I
have received an excellent education and
look forward to starting an exciting job in

August. However. I have also come to ap
preciate the virtues of the freshman naivete.
For during that brief period of idealism. 1.
along with other members of my class, was
given the opportunity to find myself. It was
during that time that I have established an
enduring bond with Stanford and formed
life-long friendships. It was then that I be
came a permanent member of the Stanford
community.
Yes. a permanent member. For wherever
I go. I will always be carrying with me a sense
of connection to the Stanford community.
This connection extends beyond the one the
Stanford Fund hopes to instill in us as future
donors.
Here I speak of more than a sense of duty
to fund capital renovation projects. The con
nection I am talking about is one that we
share as the Class of 1998 and one that will
remain with us throughout our lives.

We share a common group memory and
we will be each other's Stanford community
in the years to come. As we go through life. I
hope that we will nurture the friendships we
started here, form new ones with people
whom we have perhaps onl\ seen while pass
ing through White Plaza and continue to
learn from each other.
Four years after 1 entered Stanford. I am
leaving more mature, sophisticated and per
haps a bit jaded. As I prepare to enter the
next stage of my life journey, however, 1
leave behind all regrets and instead takt
along with me a piece of Stanford. I urge vol
to do the same.
