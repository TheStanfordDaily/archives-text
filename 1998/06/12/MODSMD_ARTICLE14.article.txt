## Looking back on the years, facing forward 
### 
Last Monday evening I took a rare
walk around campus with a close
friend. What began as a moonlit
backyard stroll around Lake Lagunita
ended as a two-hour hike past the driving
range, the Medical School and the disman
tled Rodin Sculpture Garden.
By the time we reached the Quad, my
heart was racing. Not from the exercise, as
we were going pretty slow. Not from my
looming deadlines. But from the passion
that had once again sparked between us.
Used to each other's daily presence for the
last three and a half years, we were com
fortable with our relationship as well as the
other's personal habits, for better or for
worse. But that night, a walk that started
silently turned into a much-needed spilling
of the souls.
I had yet to start a 20-page paper due the
next morning, but at the moment. I was en
gaged in something more pressing — inti

mate conversation. Having chosen to write
about that topic for my Stanford applica
tion essay four years ago. 1 wanted my par
ents' $120,000 investment to buy me more
than a reputable academic education.
We have had the luxury of attending a
four-year university. Sure, academics were
an important part of our education. But 1
would have been shortchanging myself if
that were all I had spent my time working
toward. Sequestered from the outside
world, campus life offers the precious op
portunity to live with friends, make mis
takes and grow spiritually. Social plans,
academic lessons and extracurricular activ
ities have been conveniently built into our
lives, set on a beautiful campus dotted with
palm trees, sandstone buildings and red
tiled roofs.
Having spent two years as a University
tour guide, walks around campus for me
are normally accomplished backwards and

in large groups. While 1 appreciate the pic
ture-perfect scenery during the day, noth
ing is more striking than the Quad at night.
Other than the shadowed movements of
the occasional raccoon family, we stood
alone in the center, where I officially be
came a Stanford woman freshman year on
the first lull moon of fall quarter.
Universities bring together people with
one thing in common — a passion for
learning. Although some may see Stanford
as a collection of young aspiring profes
sionals from a privileged upbringing, most
of the people I have encountered and
formed close relationships with have had
differing family backgrounds, life experi
ences and future goals. Some are not even
all that young, relatively speaking. It has
been important to me during my brief stay
in this 8,800-acre campus to work with and
have lengthy conversations with people
whom I otherwise would not have had the

opportunity to meet.
Now, as those I've grown to love pack
up for the summer and for life beyond
Stanford, 1 realize that we have been
brought together by this university for a
purpose far more important than engaging
in esoteric academic debates. Through the
years, you have joined me in a process of
self-discovery — in throwing off that light
blue uniform skirl that defined a monastic
high school existence, in riding the Euro
pean trains through Italy, France and
Spain, in commiseration and celebration
during my year as a West Lag RA and
Daily editor, and in being available as a
friend in all the right moments.
To those of you who will no longer be
dodging camera-wielding tourists, teary
eyed mothers-of-the-bride and zooming
bicycles in the Quad, it has been a pleasure
to take this walk with you. You kept the
passion alive after four years, and I am

thankful for every experience we have
shared.
Dominated by the church's illuminated
mosaic, the Quad by moonlight is how I
will remember our time together. Touted
as the best four years of our lives, college
for me was a rite of passage. I refuse to
compare the rest of my years to those spent
at Stanford, which functions as only the
foundation. My memory of CIV lectures
and the great works will no doubt fade, but
the experiences and conversations I have
had with you will be cherished. And for
that, I am grateful.

Tracy Jan, a communication major, would
like to thank Mami and Babi for their sup
port in her delayed entry into the real world.
She will return as the Phi Sig RAin the fall
and complete her coterminal degree in soci
ology.
