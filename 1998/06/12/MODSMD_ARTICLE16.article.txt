# Stanford leads NCAAs, finishes second to Arkansas
## Women ninth as Stevenson, Chokshi highlight individual performances for Card 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
For three days, the Stanford
men's track and field team was tee
tering on the verge of a national
championship.
Predicted to place somewhere
between l()th and 20th entering the
NCAA Championship meet. Stan
ford's men bolted into a convincing
lead in the team competition after
only two days of the four-day meet
and held on for dear life.
Powered by the nation's
strongest distance corps and a few
outstanding field men, the Cardinal
thinclads fought to hold off six-time
defending champion Arkansas for
the national title.
In the end, the Razorbacks 1 58
1/2 points were just enough to cap
size the hopes of the second-place
Cardinal, who amassed 51.
The Cardinal men have not
placed that high since 1963, when
the team placed second at the meet.
The Stanford men last won NCAAs
in 1934.
"We were predicted to finish
15th or 16th in the meet, but I felt
that we were one of the top teams,"
said head coach Vin Lananna.
"Arkansas is a great team, we had
them on the run, but they found a
way to win."
The Cardinal showed signs of
contention early when sophomore
Toby Stevenson captured 10 points
by winning the pole vault with a
leap of 18 feet, 2 1/2 inches on
Wednesday.

Stevenson, who placed fourth at
the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onships and was ranked 15th before
nationals, took advantage of strong
tailwinds to post the win.
"With the wind at my back. I just
got on the biggest, longest pole 1
could," said Stevenson, who bet
tered his own school record by 3
inches.
The tide continued to favor the
Cardinal Thursday as sophomores
Brad and Brent Hauser and junior
Nathan Nutter swept the top three
spots in the 10,000-meter run.
Nutter grabbed the lead with 550
meters to go and dragged the
Hausers along with him.
Breaking away from the pack,
the trio blazed to the finish, with
Brad Hauser grabbing the win in 28
minutes and 31.30 seconds, fol
lowed closely by brother Brent
(28:32.39) and Nutter (28:32.62).
"A win is great," Brad Hauser
said, "but I'd take 1-2-3 over a win
any day."
After two days of competition,
the men's score of 34 points more
than doubled that of Arkansas, and
victory was within sight.
The Razorbacks played catch
up on Friday, as Stanford scored a
scant five points on the day, all in
the hammer throw.
Junior Adam Connolly placed
fifth in the event with a throw of 227
feet and 1 inch, while senior Justin
Strand completed his Stanford ca
reer with an eighth-place toss of
218-9.
Saturday gave the Cardinal an

opportunity to seize the win with
big points expected in the 1,5(K)-
and 5,000-meter runs.
Freshman Gabe Jennings
charged out of the gate in the 1,500
to challenge the likes of Arkansas'
Seneca Lassiter and favorite Kevin
Sullivan of Michigan.
Sullivan stumbled and fell to the
track after 900 meters, and Lassiter
leapt over his body to take the lead
with Jennings in hot pursuit.
Jennings stayed on Lassiter's
shoulder awaiting a finishing duel,
but Lassiter pushed the pace all the
way to the finish and just held Jen
nings off, 3:42.34 to 3:42.39.
By the time the 5.000 meters
started, Arkansas had clawed its
way into a 52.5-47 lead with wins in
the 1,500 and horizontal jumps. All
the Razorbacks needed for the
team victory was a Cardinal mishap
and a bit of luck.
With Jennings joining the fray
along with the Hausers and Nutter,
however, Stanford appeared to
have the point-scoring capability to
seize the win.
But as the Cardinal harriers bat
tled through the race, tired legs and
strained bodies took their toll, and
only Brad Hauser was able to score
points with his fifth-place finish
(13:45.93).
Arkansas' Michael Powers
placed third, scoring six points to
clinch the team victory.
Lananna was quite pleased with
the team's performance.
"I'm proud of our team. We
changed the whole complexion of
the meet with [Stevenson's] victory
in the pole vault, and a 1-2-3 finish
in the 1 (),()()() meters," Lananna
said.
The Cardinal women, who
scored 22 1/2 points, placed ninth
overall, marking the first time that
both Cardinal squads placed in the
top 10 at the national meet.
The women were led by senior
Monal Chokshi's victory in the
3.000 meters and junior Tracye
Lawyer's second-place showing in
the heptathlon.
Chokshi used an early slow pace
to her advantage and destroyed the
field with her trademark kick over
the last 4(X) meters. Racing mid
pack with a lap to go. ("hokshi over
took and put 20 meters on the pack
in the span of 150 meters.
Electrified by the cheers of the
crowd, Chokshi powered home in a
time of 9:20.18. winning by a margin
of nearly three seconds.
Lawyer gathered team points by
placing second in the heptathlon
with 5.789 points and sixth in the
high jump with a leap of 5-11 1/4.
Freshman Melissa Feinstein tied
for fourth place in the pole vault at
12-1 1/2.
A total of 13 Stanford athletes
garnered All-America honors, set
ting a new school record. Athletes
who finished in the top eight re
ceived the honor. Of all national
point scorers for the Cardinal, only
Chokshi and Strand will not return
to battle next vear.
