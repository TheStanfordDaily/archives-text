# A 						roller-coaster tennis career
## Bleszynski finishes back on the winning path 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
It's been a roller coaster ride of sorts for
Ania Bleszynski in her Stanford women's
tennis career, but the senior is doing her best
to make sure that it ends up on top.
A year after playing in the No. 1 singles
position all season for the (Cardinal as a
sophomore and advancing to the semifinals
in both the NCAA singles and doubles
draws. Bleszynski was taken out of the sin
gles lineup in front of last season's home
crowd as the Cardinal blew past the field on
their way to a national title.
Now, Bleszynski is back to playing true to
her three-time All-American form. Flaying
at the No. 4 singles spot. Bleszynski posted
the only undefeated conference record on
the team and is currently on a nine-match
winning streak. After rolling off 12 wins in
her last 13 matches, she finished with a dual
match record of 20-3 and an overall record
of 27-7.
"She had to come back for us, and she
did." Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
said of Bleszynski, whom he called the X fac
tor in the beginning of the season. "The jury
is in.and it was a complete and total success
for her. She just had a great year."
Bleszynski's sophomore season was even
more successful. She compiled a respectable
17-9 record in the No. 1 singles spot, reached
the semifinals at NCAAs in both singles and
doubles, upset defending national champi
on and heavy favorite Keri Phebus in the
quarterfinals and finished the year ranked
No. 4 in the nation.
But her career hasn't alwavs been rosv.

On returning to Stanford for her junior
season, Bleszynski was only part of a stacked
Cardinal lineup that included an eventual
NCAA champion in freshman I.ilia Oster
loh, another freshman with college's highest
professional ranking in Anne Kremer, a
three-time Ail-American in Katie Schluke
bir, a rapidly improving senior in Sandra De
Silva and a defending Pac-10 singles champ
in Scott.
After challenge matches, Bleszynski
earned the No. 5 singles position behind Os
terloh. Schlukebir, Kremer and De Silva.
coming in front of Scott. The move to the
fifth spot was not easy for Bleszynski.
"I was caught up in the fact that I was
playing lower," Bleszynski said. "I was
caught up in that instead of focusing on my
game."
Bleszynski did put together a 21 -4 record
for the dual-match season. 31-9 overall. But
when Brennan realized that Bleszynski per
haps didn't have her heart in it.the multiple
NCAA champion coach pulled Bleszynski
out of the singles lineup in favor of then
freshman Tervn Ashley.
"It was a coach's decision." Brennan
said. "We had to decide at that point what
would help us most. Tervn was really on a
roll, and Ania was thinking Ux) much."
The Cardinal ran through opponents on
its way to a ninth NCAA title in front of a
huge home crowd in the new and improved
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. In fact, the
Card was never taken to doubles in four
matches, leaving Bleszynski off the court
completely.
"That was the worst, especially because
NCAAs were at home." Bleszvnsk said.

"Not playing was tough, but it was probably
better for the team."
Hut ihis season, Bleszynski figures to be a
crucial player in Stanford's defense of its na
tional title at Notre Dame beginning May
21. Brennan considers Bleszynski to be a
huge factor in the Cardinal linkup.
"She has been playing better and better
every week." Brennan said. "She is looking
really gtx>d. People at [the Pac-1() champi
onships] were remarking at her being back
to playing her game, her style, at that level."
Bleszynski's attitude is different this sea
son as well. She has looked downright com
fortable in her position this season, and her
play has benefited.
"C'ompared to last year. 1 was a lot better
this season." Bleszynski said. "Mostly my at
titude is different. I'm a lot happier, and 1
have more fun with it instead of being so
caught up in everything. I decided I wasn't
going to worry about [the lineup], and it's
been a much more rewarding season be
cause of that."
Brennan agreed that Ania's attitude has
changed for the better.
"It was obvious last year that she wasn't
having fun," the coach said. " This year she is
smiling — she's enjoying her hours on the
court. She was intelligent to make that her
only goal. It was.i to play No. 1 or win the
NCAAs. It was to have fun. and that was
smart. The rest of the stuff comes along with
that."
The Cardinal has certainly benefited
from Bleszynski's attitude. She earned cru
cial victories in each of five extrcmelv nar-

ford.
row 5-4 conference wins this season.
"Now I am just motivated to play
well wherever coach puts me,"
Bleszynski said, i would love to be
up there in the lineup but my team

mates ahead of me are awesome. I
am happy where I am. and that has
helped me play better."
Her play to close out the regular
season and at the Pac-1() Conference
Championships perhaps earned her a
spot in the NCAA singles draw and
ensured her of a top seed in the dou
bles draw with Scott.

"Pac-lOs were especially satisfy
ing because I got to play against some
of the girls I used to play at No. 1,"
Bleszynski said, referring specifically
to a first-round win over former Pac
-10 Player of the Year Vicky Maes.
"Even when I was a sophomore I
couldn't beat her, so it was exciting to
be back playing at that level."

Bleszynski definitely has her eyes
set on national titles.
"For the team, this year is much
more of a challenge than last year be
cause we are not as strong and being
a senior, I am definitely more moti
vated for this one than any other
one," Bleszynski said. "Hopefully. I
will get into the singles draw, and it

would be awesome to win doubles
with Julie. 1 love playing with her. We
have beaten all of the other favorites
at some point. It would be a nice way
to cap it off for two seniors."
Bleszynski and Scott have already
captured two major doubles champi
onships this season, their second
straight Rolex National Indoor title

and the Pac-10 doubles crown. They
advanced to the NCAA semifinals
last season before being eliminated.
"They have played some great
doubles." Brennan said. "They have
wins over the defending national
champions, so I like their chances if
they play them again. They are defi
nitely one of the top couple teams."
