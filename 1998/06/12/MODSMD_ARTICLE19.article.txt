# Goldstein leaves an NCAA Championship legacy behind
## Four-time winner strikes a balance between Cardinal tennis and Stanford 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
When Paul Goldstein arrived at
Stanford his freshman year, there
was never any douht he would be a
success.
With three national age-group
championships in hand before his
Stanford career, he was going places.
Goldstein was courted by top
schools both academically and with
in the tennis realm, such as Harvard
and Duke, but he said he knew
where he fit in from the start.
"It was a relatively easy decision.
For me, Stanford was just the right
combination as far as the reputation
for academics and athletics," he said.
"1 tried to go in with an open mind,
but I knew 1 wanted to go to Stan
ford. 1 didn't seriously consider any
other school."
Once on the Farm. Goldstein
acted like any other freshman — ex
cited to do everything and wanting to
"get the entire Stanford experience."
Although he did not come in with
any expectations of college, Gold
stein said he still had expectations for
himself.
"I wanted to thrive academically,
socially and athletically. To me, these
are the three most important things.
It's incredibly difficult to balance all
three."

Goldstein said he had a difficult
time adjusting to his overloaded life
at Stanford after accomplishing and
being involved in so much in high
school. At Stanford, he was surprised
to find achieving in the three areas
that were most important to him
were more difficult than they had
been in high school.
Goldstein said he found the entire
balancing act a vicious cycle. The
more effort he put into one area, the
more he suffered in another.
"The most difficult thing for me
was accepting the fact that I wouldn't
thrive as much as I could have acade
mically. socially and athletically,"
Goldstein said. "1 beat myself up a
lot in my mind and made it a lot more
difficult than 1 had to. But I think in
the last year and a half. I have had a
much better perspective."
Although pressed for time at
Stanford, Goldstein said he feels he
has struck a balance among all the as
pects of his Stanford career.
"The trick is balance, not putting
one aspect too much ahead of anoth
er," he said. "I think that's the great
est challenge for any athlete at Stan
ford."
Goldstein said he has found time
for all three of the aspects of his life
he values most. He has also been in
volved with volunteer organizations
such as the East Palo Alto Tennis

and Tutoring program and Realizing
Intellect through Self-Empower
ment, a mentor-tutor program for
African-American students at
Menlo Atherton High School.
Considering all he has been in
volved in and all the time commit
ments he has had. there is only one
thing Goldstein regrets.
"Well, I've never been to
Yosemite," he laughed. "I've had a
great time. Now I feel like I'm part of
the tennis program forever. Stanford
tennis will always be with me."
At 21. Goldstein has accom
plished more than anyone could
have imagined. With three junior na
tional titles under his belt and the top
ranks in his age divisions, he has re
ceived countless sportsmanship
awards, including the prestigious
Rafael Osuna Award given to the
"collegiate player best exemplifying
competitive excellence, sportsman
ship and contributions to the game."
At Stanford, Goldstein is a three
time All-American and two-time
All-Pacific 10 Conference. He has
been a part of an undefeated team,
has had a perfect singles record so far
this year and just captured the Pac-10
singles championship last weekend.
"Success is so fun." Goldstein
said. "But I don't take that for grant
ed. I know how much hard work it
takes to achieve that success."

Head coach Dick Gould said
Goldstein has been invaluable to
Stanford tennis for both his tennis
talent and his influence on the team.
Gould credits Goldstein as one of the
main reasons the team is in excellent
position to win a fourth consecutive
NCAA championship.
"Paul is the kind of guy who
breeds winning." Gould said. "His
presence has always led to that. He
has been a tremendous example
through his personal values, work
ethic, selflessness, commitment to
athletics and academics and by the
realization that what we do is just
part of the big picture."
Goldstein agrees that tennis skills
are only just a small part of what he
will take away from Stanford. He
said the more important lessons he
has learned are from the organiza
tional and operational perspective.
"I've had priceless experiences
with the team. As for Coach Gould, I
can't imagine anyone running a bet
ter program. The lessons I've learned
from Gould are invaluable. He's
taught me more than anyone could
teach me on the court."
Gould said the respect Goldstein
has for him is reciprocal.
"Respect always works two
wavs," Gould said. "We've been

very lucky to have Paul in every re
spect. He epitomizes the Stanford
student-athlete. What he has done
for Stanford and our program's rep
utation has been priceless."
Alter graduating this spring with
a degree in human biology, the first
order of business for Goldstein will
be as co-best man at his brother's
wedding. After that, there's more
tennis in store for Goldstein.
"I'm going to go pro and see if I
can't win a match or two," he said.
Goldstein will compete profes
sionally in both singles and doubles.
He said he plans to compete as long
as he can before he retires from pro
fessional play and begins to "make
use of my Stanford education."
Gould predicted that before it's
over, Goldstein will fare well in pro
fessional competition.
"Paul is one of the best doubles
players we've ever had. His ability to

focus, his footspeed and his ability to
play an all-around game will com
pensate for his not having one dev
astating shot, like a big forehand or a
big serve," Gould said.
"If he stays with tennis, I think he
will be one of the world's top-10 dou
bles players."
Overall, Goldstein has been ec
static with his tennis career and said
he is happy just with what he has
done so far.
"If someone told me that I would
have the chance to win seven con
secutive national championships be
fore I started, I would have said.
Forget about it, there's no way.' I
didn't expect this in the least," he
said. "I've learned that you don't
focus on the outcomes. Just focus on
the process, and the outcomes will
follow.
For now, Goldstein said he feels
he has accomplished what he had set
out to do.
"I've had an enormous amount of
help," he said. "And it's been a
great, great ride."
