# Two-sport star rediscovers happiness in volleyball
## Folkl takes home three volleyball titles, WNBA career to come 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
To the casual observer, Kristin
Folkl has had an amazing athletic ca
reer.
In five varsity seasons of volley
ball and basketball. Folkl has ad
vanced to five Final Fours, winning
the national championship twice in
volleyball.
She's equally accomplished on
the individual level. Folkl earned
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors for volleyball in 1994 and is a
three-time All-American in that
sport. In basketball, Folkl's time has
been limited to just 34 games over
two seasons, but she's been impres
sive enough to be named a presea
son candidate for the Naismith Play
er of the Year award.
With all the success Folkl has
achieved, you would expect the se
nior outside hitter for the third
ranked women's volleyball team to
have nothing but happy, upbeat ex
periences to share about the sport
that took her to the 1996 Olympic
Games as a first alternate.
But that's not necessarily the
case.
Sure, Folkl is happy with her
teams' achievements and even
proud of her personal accomplish
ments. But there's an individual
standard by which the great ones
measure their success, and for Folkl,
it's a standard she hadn't been com
peting at in recent years.
"Personally, this has nothing to
do with not loving the sport or not
loving my team." Folkl said. "But
not including this season, the last
two years of the sport have not been
good for me. I haven't been happy
with how I played and where I got,
and that's pretty well-known."

After a stellar freshman cam
paign that earned her first-team All-
America honors as well as national
and Pacific 10 Conference Fresh
man of the Year, Folkl spent her
summer touring with the U.S. Na
tional Team. She joined the Cardi
nal 10 matches into her sophomore
season and finished a second-team
All-American.
Then Folkl left the Farm and
spent the winter and spring quarters
of 1996 training with the national
team in hopes of earning a berth on
the Olympic squad. The decision
came down to the very last spot, and
Folkl ended up as the first alternate.
Folkl's return last season saw her
put up the best numbers of her ca
reer, but in the end, politics and the
performances of some of her team
mates played a role in Folkl again
being relegated to second-team All-
American.
"That was a joke last year," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There's a
mentality to let everybody play and
give everybody a chance. With [Lisa
Sharpley and Kerri Walsh], we had
two players on the first team, so they
moved Folkl down."
After a year of the most intense
volleyball of her life, Folkl needed a
break. She opted not to play basket
ball. but joined the team in midsea
son when an injury plague thinned
out coach Tara VanDerveer's
squad.
Folkl enjoyed tremendous suc
cess in her 10 games, and after
spending spring with the volleyball
team, she took the summer off.
"1 think having this past summer
off helped me a lot because I felt to
tally refreshed, and essentially I was
ready to come in and give volleyball
my all," Folkl said. "I was very excit
ed to play. I didn't feel burned out.

I'd attribute a lot of what I'm doing
now to the fact that I didn't do any
thing in the summer."
If Folkl's performance this sea
son is any indication, Shaw may
begin prescribing a few hoops games
in the winter and summers off for his
players. Folkl is having a career year,
even by a three-time All-Ameri
can's standards.
She's currently in the top 20 na
tionally in hitting percentage (.380)
and the top 10 in kills with 456 (5.56
per game). And while her hitting
percentage is the lower-ranking sta
tistic, it is easily the most impressive.
Most players in the top 20 are
middle blockers, a position that
leads to fewer attacks and higher hit
ting percentages. Secondly, a large
portion of the nation's statistical
leaders are from weaker confer
ences than the Pac-10, racking up big
numbers against lesser competition.
And finally there's the injury to
Walsh. Folkl has been called on to
carry a large portion of the offensive
load this season, and with Walsh not
swinging at full speed, defenses have
been able to key on Folkl. Logic
would dictate that her percentage
would decrease, but so far she's
managed to put up the best numbers
of her Stanford career.
"Her hitting percentage is espe
cially impressive," Shaw said. "For
an outside hitter to hit that high a
percentage is pretty amazing. When
I knew that Kerri wasn't at full
strength, I can remember saying,
'Folkl's going to have to put up big
numbers.' And she has."
In fact, she's putting up the kind
of numbers that get people talking
about Player of the Year honors.
After posting 22 kills against UCLA
Oct. 31 and following up w ;, .h a ca
reer-high 33 against USC Nov. 2,

Folkl was named AVCA National
Player of the Week.
But that's just one weekend.
Folkl has been big all year, leading
an injury-stricken squad to a perfect
conference record in the toughest
conference in collegiate women's
volleyball.
"I think she's a legitimate candi
date," Shaw said. "But who knows
how those things go. I think she's
had a tremendous year, and she's on
a great team. Sometimes that takes
away from a player."
But Folkl will quickly tell you
she'd rather be on a great team than
the only good player in a mediocre
program.
"If you don't have a great team,
you won't get great digs or get great
sets to get easy kills," Folkl said. "It's
also being in an environment with
other great athletes that push you,
that keep you on top and keep your
ego in check. You keep working
hard, and you keep improving."
So Folkl is working hard and im
proving. She's having fun with vol
leyball again, and it shows. But tak
ing a page from her own history,
Folkl is quite content to enjoy her
last season on the Farm and leave all
that talk about national honors to
somebody else.
"I've gotten my hopes up too
high for too many things in this sport
and fallen short, so I'm not expecting
anything," Folkl said. "You're sup
posed to do it because you enjoy it. I
don't have a good answer for why
I've been having fun this year or why
it's been a good year.
"This season is a lot more exciting
just because it's my last year, and
you go out and play with a desire
that you can only get when you
know it's your last time to be out
there."

Then Folkl left the Farm and
spent the winter and spring quarters
of 1996 training with the national
team in hopes of earning a berth on
the Olympic squad. The decision
came down to the very last spot, and
Folkl ended up as the first alternate.
Folkl's return last season saw her
put up the best numbers of her ca
reer, but in the end, politics and the
performances of some of her team
mates played a role in Folkl again
being relegated to second-team All-
American.
"That was a joke last year," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There's a
mentality to let everybody play and
give everybody a chance. With [Lisa
Sharpley and Kerri Walsh], we had
two players on the first team, so they
moved Folkl down."
After a year of the most intense
volleyball of her life, Folkl needed a
break. She opted not to play basket
ball. but joined the team in midsea
son when an injury plague thinned
out coach Tara VanDerveer's
squad.
Folkl enjoyed tremendous suc
cess in her 10 games, and after
spending spring with the volleyball
team, she took the summer off.
"1 think having this past summer
off helped me a lot because I felt to
tally refreshed, and essentially I was
ready to come in and give volleyball
my all," Folkl said. "I was very excit
ed to play. I didn't feel burned out.

I'd attribute a lot of what I'm doing
now to the fact that I didn't do any
thing in the summer."
If Folkl's performance this sea
son is any indication, Shaw may
begin prescribing a few hoops games
in the winter and summers off for his
players. Folkl is having a career year,
even by a three-time All-Ameri
can's standards.
She's currently in the top 20 na
tionally in hitting percentage (.380)
and the top 10 in kills with 456 (5.56
per game). And while her hitting
percentage is the lower-ranking sta
tistic, it is easily the most impressive.
Most players in the top 20 are
middle blockers, a position that
leads to fewer attacks and higher hit
ting percentages. Secondly, a large
portion of the nation's statistical
leaders are from weaker confer
ences than the Pac-10, racking up big
numbers against lesser competition.
And finally there's the injury to
Walsh. Folkl has been called on to
carry a large portion of the offensive
load this season, and with Walsh not
swinging at full speed, defenses have
been able to key on Folkl. Logic
would dictate that her percentage
would decrease, but so far she's
managed to put up the best numbers
of her Stanford career.
"Her hitting percentage is espe
cially impressive," Shaw said. "For
an outside hitter to hit that high a
percentage is pretty amazing. When
I knew that Kerri wasn't at full
strength, I can remember saying,
'Folkl's going to have to put up big
numbers.' And she has."
In fact, she's putting up the kind
of numbers that get people talking
about Player of the Year honors.
After posting 22 kills against UCLA
Oct. 31 and following up w ;, .h a ca
reer-high 33 against USC Nov. 2,

Folkl was named AVCA National
Player of the Week.
But that's just one weekend.
Folkl has been big all year, leading
an injury-stricken squad to a perfect
conference record in the toughest
conference in collegiate women's
volleyball.
"I think she's a legitimate candi
date," Shaw said. "But who knows
how those things go. I think she's
had a tremendous year, and she's on
a great team. Sometimes that takes
away from a player."
But Folkl will quickly tell you
she'd rather be on a great team than
the only good player in a mediocre
program.
"If you don't have a great team,
you won't get great digs or get great
sets to get easy kills," Folkl said. "It's
also being in an environment with
other great athletes that push you,
that keep you on top and keep your
ego in check. You keep working
hard, and you keep improving."
So Folkl is working hard and im
proving. She's having fun with vol
leyball again, and it shows. But tak
ing a page from her own history,
Folkl is quite content to enjoy her
last season on the Farm and leave all
that talk about national honors to
somebody else.
"I've gotten my hopes up too
high for too many things in this sport
and fallen short, so I'm not expecting
anything," Folkl said. "You're sup
posed to do it because you enjoy it. I
don't have a good answer for why
I've been having fun this year or why
it's been a good year.
"This season is a lot more exciting
just because it's my last year, and
you go out and play with a desire
that you can only get when you
know it's your last time to be out
there."
