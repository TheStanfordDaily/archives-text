# Sharpley concludes career in style
## Senior co-captain quietly ends four-year run with a bang 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Senior Lisa Sharpley looks com
pletely comfortable sitting in the
hallway of the team's hotel just one
night before the start of the Final
Four in Spokane, Wash, she talks
quietly and confidently about her
team's prospects in the champi
onship, and you can tell this whole
experience is nothing new for the
Ail-American setter.
That's because in Sharpley's
four years on the Farm, the co-cap
tain's team has never missed a Final
Four. And Sharpley has been there
for every one, calling plays and
guiding the power-fueled Cardinal
offense to four Pacific 10 Confer
ence titles and three national
crowns.
"It's amazing," Sharpley said. "I
couldn't have asked for more than
to get to go to the Final Four every
year."
So she's been here before, and
you can tell she's comfortable with
her position as the leader of one of
volleyball's top collegiate pro
grams. But one thing you probably
didn't notice this year was the pain
Sharpley endured in her left knee.
Sure, we all remember how
Sharpley hobbled around the court
in the Aug. 22 loss to Penn State,
but that was early in the year. She
kept playing, and the team was very
successful. Sharpley kept racking
up assists, and everything looked
completely normal in the matches.
We're all certain our three-time
AU-American setter recovered

from that knee thing completely.
However, what we didn't know
about were the hours of therapy
and the numerous pain medica
tions Sharpley endured all year. Or
perhaps we didn't see the bulky
knee brace she wore everywhere
but in matches.
None of us sat in on practices to
witness Sharpley riding a stationary
bike rather than participating in
blocking drills, and none of us no
ticed the times during matches
when Sharpley would favor that
knee ever so slightly.
"It's an extra thing to think
about, and it's been really frustrat
ing to miss so much practice,"
Sharpley said. "To have something
affect your whole season is very dif
ficult. I had to just hope that by
game time it would feel OK. It was
frustrating, and 1 think maybe it af
fected my game. But once I got on
the court I just hoped that I would
be able to think about the game and
do what I could."
What else would we expect from
a three-year captain who's provid
ed nothing but exceptional play
and solid leadership from the first
day she stepped on campus? We
definitely wouldn't consider the
possibility that Sharpley was cut
from the first team she ever tried
out for.
But back in the sixth grade
Sharpley and her best friend decid
ed they wanted to play for the Bay
Club volleyball team, and Sharp
ley's mom, Cheryl, took the two to
the tryout.
"We showed up in sweats and

didn't even have knee pads," Lisa
Sharpley said. "Everyone else did,
and my mom told us to learn how to
serve while she went and bought us
knee pads. So we tried to improve
our skills during warmups."
Sharpley was crushed when her
friend made the team and she did
not, but fortunately her volleyball
career didn't end there. Sharpley's
parents saw how important volley
ball was to her and looked into
some of the other teams in the area.
Seven years later Sharpley was a
highly touted freshman for Stan
ford. She was dubbed the second
highest recruit in the nation behind
teammate Kristin Folkl, and the
setter did not disappoint in her
rookie campaign. Sharpley was one
of three starting freshmen that year
and helped guide Stanford to a 32-1
season that concluded with a na
tional title.
And things just got better after
that. The sophomore jinx didn't
exist for Sharpley, as the setter was
named one of three captains on the
team and earned first-team All-
America honors that year.
Sharpley hit .311 and posted 860
assists in the Cardinal's 6-2 offense,
but the team's ultimate goal of a re
peat championship was stopped
short with a loss to Texas in the
semifinal.
"Looking back, that's one of the
best things that could've hap
pened." Sharpley said of the loss.
"It made us want it so much more
the next year, and it made it worth
so much more. Now we all fully un
derstand how hard it is to win. Even

if you have all the talent, it doesn't
matter if you don't put the work
in."
The Cardinal worked extra hard
that spring and returned to the 1
season with a vengeance. Sharpley
had made a name for herself as one
of the top setters in the nation and
was beginning her first year as
Stanford's lone setter.
The result was an astounding
success as the Cardinal won its
third national title and Sharpley
posted the third-highest single sea
son total for assists (1.433) in Stan
ford history.
But try to compliment her and
an unassuming Sharpley will just
tell you that assists are a misleading
statistic. She tries her hardest to he
the typical, unheralded setter, hut
her numbers are just too impressive
for that. With 1,278 assists this sea
son. Sharpley moved her career
total to 4,288 making her only the
third Stanford player to record
more than 4,(M) assists.
"It's an honor to be recognized
along with some of the idols from
my childhood like Wendy Rush,
Carrie Feldman and Lara Asper,"
Sharpley said.
"But it's a misleading statistic. I
think it's more a result of the play
ing time that 1 got. It's not a ranking
of how good of a setter you are. I
was lucky to get to play for four
years."
But even if Sharpley sits quietly
back and takes as little credit for
her numbers as possible, Stanford
fans won't let her off the hook that
easily. When you've been around

as long as Sharpley has and you've
made such an impact on your
team's ncredible success, people
don't forget you.
So even though Sharpley won't

be out there calling the plays next
year, the setter who got cut from
the club team as a 12-vear-old has
found a permanent place in Stan
ford voilevball immortality.

short with a loss to Texas in the
semifinal.
"Looking back, that's one of the
best things that could've hap
pened." Sharpley said of the loss.
"It made us want it so much more
the next year, and it made it worth
so much more. Now we all fully un
derstand how hard it is to win. Even

if you have all the talent, it doesn't
matter if you don't put the work
in."
The Cardinal worked extra hard
that spring and returned to the 1
season with a vengeance. Sharpley
had made a name for herself as one
of the top setters in the nation and
was beginning her first year as
Stanford's lone setter.
The result was an astounding
success as the Cardinal won its
third national title and Sharpley
posted the third-highest single sea
son total for assists (1.433) in Stan
ford history.
But try to compliment her and
an unassuming Sharpley will just
tell you that assists are a misleading
statistic. She tries her hardest to he
the typical, unheralded setter, hut
her numbers are just too impressive
for that. With 1,278 assists this sea
son. Sharpley moved her career
total to 4,288 making her only the
third Stanford player to record
more than 4,(M) assists.
"It's an honor to be recognized
along with some of the idols from
my childhood like Wendy Rush,
Carrie Feldman and Lara Asper,"
Sharpley said.
"But it's a misleading statistic. I
think it's more a result of the play
ing time that 1 got. It's not a ranking
of how good of a setter you are. I
was lucky to get to play for four
years."
But even if Sharpley sits quietly
back and takes as little credit for
her numbers as possible, Stanford
fans won't let her off the hook that
easily. When you've been around

as long as Sharpley has and you've
made such an impact on your
team's ncredible success, people
don't forget you.
So even though Sharpley won't

be out there calling the plays next
year, the setter who got cut from
the club team as a 12-vear-old has
found a permanent place in Stan
ford voilevball immortality.
