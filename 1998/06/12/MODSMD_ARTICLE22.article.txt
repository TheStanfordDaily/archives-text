# FOUR YEARS IN STANFORD SPORTS
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of
