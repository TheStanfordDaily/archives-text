# FOUR YEARS IN STANFORD SPORTS
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of

the most exciting regionals in recent
memory. Alabama was on the plate
for the Card in the regional semifinal,
and the Crimson Tide was a mouth
ful.
Alabama was able to force over
time, and with Starbird on the bench
with five fouls, the Tide had to like its
chances. But Alabama didn't count
on the heroics of then-sophomore
Naomi Mulitauaopele. In front of her
hometown crowd in Seattle, Muli
tauaopele scored Stanford's only
four points in overtime. But it wasn't
over until Alabama All-American
Shalonda Enis took a length-of-the
floor pass and missed the six-footer
that would have tied the game.
Auburn proved to be not much
more than a stepping block in the re
gional final, and the Card was off to a
second consecutive Final Four.
Georgia was the opponent there, and
Naismith Player of the Year Saudia
Roundtree was unstoppable as the
Lady Dawgs jumped out to a ridicu
lous lead. Stanford wouldn't quit,
though and fought back to within
five. The Card had opportunities to
cut into the lead but in the end fell to
Georgia 86-76.
Perhaps the biggest shock of the
winter came when the women's
swimming team lost a meet to USC.
Stanford's win streak in dual meets
dated back to 1988. and by this point
hadn't we come to expect them to win
all the time?
Swimming never loses, and it
didn't the rest of the year. The
women struck back with a
vengeance, claiming a Pac-10 title be
fore crushing the competition for a
fifth straight national championship.
Sunken Diamond got lights, and
baseball won its first night game 5-0
over Cal State-Fullerton. After a 10-
11 start in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion. the team finished up with 18
straight wins, earning the right to host
a regional. But losses to Florida State
and Cal State-Northridge stopped
baseball's season just short of the
World Series.
NCAA action came to the Farm in
the form of men's gymnastics, as
Maples Pavilion was the site of the
championships. The men were hop
ing to repeat as national champs, but
came in third. But Stanford's lan
Bachrach and Jamie Ellis won indi
vidual titles in the floor exercise and
parallel bars, respectively.
Women's tennis was undefeated
in the Pac-10, winning a ninth consec
utive conference title. But top
ranked Florida got in the way at
NCAAs. and the women settled for
national runner-up.
The men. on the other hand, had
fallen victim to UCLA every time the
schools faced during the season. The
Bruins were the favorite, but Stan
ford pulled off the repeat by beating

UCLA in the final for the first time all
year.
Men's golf claimed its first-ever
West Regional title in the last year
with Woods, who won the individual
title. The team headed to NCAAs
hoping to regain the national crown it
lost the year before. WotxJs ran away
with the individual title, but as a team
the Card placed fourth.
The underdog women came even
closer than the men. By the third
round, the Card was in a two-way tie
for first heading into the final round.
But Stanford faltered in the final
round and ended up fifth, eight
strokes behind champion Arizona.
IW6-97
At the beginning of the year, you
could pick out at least 10 Stanford
teams that had a legitimate shot of
winning the national title. The only
way to describe most of Stanford's
athletic teams was loaded, and if ever
there was a year in which the Card
could break the record of five NC A A
titles, it was 19%-97.
By the end of winter break we
were half way there. Women's and
men's cross country got things going
first by sweeping the Pac-10 titles and
then by taking both NCAA titles.
The men crushed favored Arkansas
46-74, and the women pulled out a
closer win over Villanova 101-106.
Women's volleyball garnered the
other national title at the break, the
program's third in five years. Early
losses proved the Card wasn't invinci
ble, and in the absence of then-junior
Lisa Sharpley, Stanford was
stretched to five games against a
weak Cal team.
But a win over then-No. 1 Hawaii
in Honolulu just before season's end
showed that the Card was more than
capable of climbing back to the top.
When the NCAA tournament began,
Stanford got the top seed in the West
and were clearly on a mission.
The previous season's Final Four
loss was quite the motivator, and the
women stormed back to the national
semifinal. This time the Card took
down defending national champion
Nebraska in four games and set up a
rematch with Hawaii.
The Rainbows didn't stand a
chance. In the most lopsided champi
onship match in history, the Card ran
away with a 15-7.15-3,15-5 win. Stan
ford freshman Kerri Walsh garnered
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors. and the Card had four All-Amer
icans.
Both soccer teams got new coach
es for the start of the 1996-97 season,
and although the men's team strug
gled. the women jumped out to a
good start. That was quickly halted by
a mid-season slump, and the Card
turned it on at the end with a four
game win streak to claim the Pac-10
crown and an automatic NCAA

berth.
For the second year in a row Stan
lord drew Santa Clara in the first
round of the tournament, and this
year the Broncos jumped out to a 3-0
halftime lead in cold, windy condi
tions. But the Card gave a valiant ef
fort in the second, fighting back for
two goals and falling just short 3-2.
Football, meanwhile, got off to a
horrible start. With a 2-5 record,
things looked bleak as they headed to
Los Angeles to take on the Bruins.
But a late fourth quarter drive that
spanned 80 yards and ended with a
Brian Manning reception in the end
zone was the turnaround to the
Card's season. Stanford left the Rose
Bowl with a 21-20 victory over
UCLA and followed that by sweep
ing the California schools on its way
to a Sun Bowl berth.
Michigan State was the Card's op
ponent. and the team put on a clinic
for the Spartans. Quarterback Chad
Hutchinson earned MVP honors as
Stanford cruised 38-0 in the Card's
first shutout in 22 years.

While the football team was cele
brating its postseason bliss, the water
polo team was perhaps cursing the
NCAA selection committee. Despite
being the No. 2 team in the nation
most of the season and finishing the
MPSF tournament second behind
No. 1 USC, Stanford was overlooked
for one of two MFSF berths to the
tourney. Instead the NCAA took
sixth-place UCLA, which edged the
Card in the season series.
Field hockey set new standards in
the fall of ILW6.1 L W6. An early 10-game win
streak was a sign of the ( animal's
dominance over West Coast teams,
and Stanford went on to claim the
Northern Pacific title in a triple over
time win over Cal.
When hoops got underway, it was
with the knowledge that preseason
All-American pick Kristin Folkl
would not plav. The two-sport star
announced in the fall that she would
take the year off from basketball.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal was the
preseason No. 1 and a hands down fa
vorite to claim a national title.

The Card started the season by
handling No. 2 Alabama and then a
few weeks later stormed into the
Thompson-Boling Arena to take on
defending-national champion Ten
nessee. Stanford performance's was
enough to prompt Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt's remark that this
was the best team Tara VanDerveer
had ever coached at Stanford.
The juniors and seniors on the
squad clearly remembered the em
barrassing loss from two seasons be
fore and were quite content to be the
first Cardinal team to defeat the Lady
Volunteers on their home court. But
the celebration didn't last long as Old
Dominion upset the Card two days
later.
Stanford rebounded from the loss
to remain undefeated for the rest of
the season. Senior Kate Starbird was
dominant in the Pac-10 and secured
both conference and national player
of the year honors en route to be
coming the school's all-time leading
scorer on an emotional Senior Night.
An injurv bug in the post prompt-

Ed Folkl's return with five games left
in the regular season, and the Card
possessed what was likely the deep
est. most talented team in the tourna
ment. A No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional sent Stanford to Missoula,
Mont., where senior point guard
Jamila Wideman put on a show.
Wideman garnered Regional
MVP honors as Stanford first ousted
Virginia and then exacted revenge
from the previous year on Georgia
with a crushing 82-47 win to advance
to the Final Four.
Old Dominion was waiting in
Cincinnati, and no one thought the
Card would lose to the Lady Mon
archs twice, especially not with
Kristin Folkl. Stanford jumped out to
a 15-point lead in the first half hut saw
Old Dominion surge hack and go up
late in the game.
Senior guard Charmin Smith iced
two free throws to send the game into
overtime. But none of Stanford's
three shots in the closing 12 seconds
of the extra frame would drop, and
the Card fell 83-82.
The "Maples Massacre" took
place when UCLA came to Maples
to take on the men's basketball team.
The Bruins suffered the worst loss in
their program's history at the hands
of the Card MW-61. Eventual national
champion Arizona also went down in
Maples, this one on a buzzer-heater
from Sauer for the 81 -80 win.
When the tournament began,
Stanford was set up for a subregional
contest with Wake Forest and nation
al player of the year Tim Duncan.
The Card pushed, fouled and leaned
on Duncan for 40 minutes, and when
the game was over Stanford found it
self headed for the program's first
ever Sweet Sixteen appearance.
The sensational Brevm Knight hit
an incredible shot to send Stanford's
Sweet Sixteen debut against Utah
into overtime but couldn't pull out
the win. I tah advanced with an 82-77
victory, but men's hoops had com
pleted a total transformation during
the Brevin Knight years.
With three national titles already
in the bag and women's hoops, men's
and women's swimming and foiling
all capable of w inning national titles,
the record five NCAA titles was in
jeopardy over spring break. But the
Card w as surprisingly zero for spring
break.
Auburn was dominating in the
men's swimming competition, and
the Card settled for second. USC
pulled off the upset win over the
women's team, edging Stanford by
just 11 points. Fencing finished a best
ever third at nationals over spring
break, but even that finish was below
the team's aspirations.
The synchronized swimming team
came closer than any other program
to claiming a national title over spring
break. But in the end Stanford fell 13
hundredths of a point short to Ohio
State.
Meanwhile, men's volleyball was
tearing its wa\ through the competi
tion. Ranked No. I for part of the sea
son. they took out nval UCLA in the
MPSF tournament final to automati
cally advance to the Final Four. Ball
State went down in a quick three
game match in the semifinal to set up
a rematch with the Bruins for the na
tional title.
Stanford looked poised to claim
the program's first national champi
onship by taking the first two games
from the Bruins. But UCLA fought

back to win games three and four with
relative ease and sent the game into a
rally-scored, determining fifth game.
Stanford went up early, but the
Bruins fought back to take the lead.
With the game tied at 13, UCLA
served into the net to set up champi
onship point. Stanford got a block for
the point and the year's fourth
NCAA title.
Men's and women's tennis did the
rest.
The women were undefeated
through the Pac-10, and then-junior
Julie Scott claimed her second
straight Pac-10 singles title. Florida
was still the favorite when the
NCAAs began, but this time the
Gators would have to come through
the Farm. The Taube Family Tennis
Stadium was the site of the NCAA
championships, and the Cardinal
once again tied its record five NCAA
titles here at home.
Florida fell to Stanford this time in
a rematch of the previous year's na
tional championship match. Fresh
man Lilia Osterloh went on to claim
the NCAA singles title, and all that
was left for Stanford sports fans was
to watch the men's team in Los An
geles.
UCLA was the clear favorite, but
the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal wouldn't be
turned away that easily. Senior Grant
Elliot pulled out the win in a three-set
match to clench the third consecutive
national title for men's tennis and the
sixth of the year for Stanford sports.
But the year was far from over.
Women's golf placed second at Pac
10s and had an outside shot at the na
tional title, finishing fourth at
NCAAs. Track won Big Meet, and
for the men it was the first time in 25
years. But if any team had a shot at
giving Stanford its seventh national
title, it was baseball.
Stanford once again got the pre
season No 1. ranking. The Card went
on to sweep USC for the first time in
six years, but didn't clinch the Six-Pac

title until the final game of its season
ending series against UCLA. Peter
son broke Jack McDowell's strikeout
record and as a team, the Card set a
new record for homeruns in a season.
The Card got to host a regional in
the NCAA tournament. This year,
the Card swept through the West Re
gional on its way to Omaha, Neb., for
the World Series. There Stanford
took care of Auburn but lost to
Louisiana State. The Card won one
more over Auburn to stave off elimi
nation, but Louisiana State was too
much. The Tigers beat the Card again
en route to their second-straight
NCAA title.
1997-98
With the kickoff of the 1997 foot
ball season, predictions of a "rosy fu
ture" had students making plans for
New Year's in Pasadena. The Cardi
nal even jumped out strong with a 3-1
record heading into a matchup with
then-unranked Notre Dame.
The Card's only loss was a re
spectable 28-17 loss to then-No. 6
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Mean
while, the Fighting Irish entered the
contest on a three-game losing streak.
Stanford won the contest 33-15 in
front of more than 75,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
That was the high point. From that
point on, it just got worse. Five
straight losses to Pac-10 opponents
gave Stanford a 4-6 record heading
into the 100 th Big Game.
With no shot at a bowl game on
the line for either squad, Stanford's
one-point win in the contest didn't
mean a whole lot. The finish was ex
citing, and postgame jeers to the Cal
student section prompted Bears fans
to tear down the goal posts. We may
have won the game, but their fans
made our students look like the Wee
nies.
Meanwhile the men's and
women's cross country teams were
doing their best to make a repeat run
at the national title. Both squads won
the Pac-10 titles for a second year in a
row, but entering NCAAs, the
women were expected to win rather
than the men.

While the women's team were the
top-ranked team in the nation, the
men were second to Arkansas, and a
loss to the Razorbacks would not
have been considered a great upset.
However, the men would not be
turned away and garnered a second
consecutive NCAA title with a 53-56
win over Arkansas.
The women were not as fortunate,
and the Card just missed a double re
peat. Brigham Young edged Stanford
by a score of 100-102 in a race that in
cluded two very close finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second
runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Fresh
man Ann Ramsey was the other key
factor, placing 51st with an identical
time to the three runners who placed
ahead of her — all by just fractions of
a second. Either point swing could
have garnered the double repeat
Stanford was hoping for.
The men's and women's soccer
teams seemingly had a reversal of for
tunes last fall. The women's team got
off to an uncharacteristically poor
start, losing four straight early in the
season and dropping its first two Pac
-10 games to drop to 4-7.
But Stanford turned things
around and finished the year without
another loss. That wasn't enough for
the NCAA selection committee,
however, and conference champ
UCLA was the Pac-10's lone repre
sentative in the tournament.
The men's team had a banner
year. The wins kept piling up, and the
squad continually climbed up the
rankings. The Card claimed its first
division title and reached the No. 2
ranking. Stanford than faced off
against top-ranked Indiana. But
that's where things started heading
south.
The Card's 2-1 loss to Indiana
would not have been detrimental
alone, but the five-game skid it
sparked brought a quick end to Stan
ford's season. After losses to San
Francisco and Santa Clara, the Card
faced off against UCLA for the
MPSF title and lost 1-0. Stanford still
got a bid to the NCAA tourney but
fell in a tough overtime battle to

Washington 2-1.
Field hockey also put up the best
numbers in the program's history.
The squad was ranked in the top 20,
and a successful road trip to the East
was promising early on. Stanford
even cruised to a second straight Nor-
Pac title and a 16-6 record (the most
wins in school history), but the per
formance was not enough for the
team to receive an at-large bid into
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Water polo was surprisingly over
looked by the NCAA selection com
mittee for the second year in a row.
Again the Cardinal was ranked
among the nation's top three or four
all year long, only to get snubbed by
the selection committee after not
winning the MFSF tournament.
Again Stanford placed second in the
conference tourney, and again the
second MFSF bid to the NCAA tour
nament went to another team, leav
ing the No. 3 squad in the nation out
of the national tournament.
The women's volleyball team
started its quest for history on shaky
ground. Two of the Card's three re
turning Ail-Americans were side
lined with injuries, and Stanford's 50-
match home win streak came to a halt
when Penn State came to town.
But Stanford began its romp
through the Pac-10, and slowly the
team began to improve. Kristin Folkl
was having a career-year even by her
standards and walked away with Pac
-10 Player of the Year honors as Stan
ford won yet another conference title.
When the tournament started,
Penn State was the overwhelming fa
vorite. But the Nittany Lions didn't
have the kind of experience the Card
carried in its five seniors, and Stan
ford's quest for a historic fourth
NCAA title and a third for the seniors
was inevitable.
Stanford went through UC-Santa
Barbara and Long Beach State, who
boasted National Player of the Year
Misty May, en route to a national
championship rematch with the Nit
tany Lions. The match lived up to its
billing in the form of a five-game bat
tle that the Card pulled out on a Folkl
kill.

Hut while Folkl was earning the
third national title and fourth All-
America honors of her career in vol
leyball. the women's basketball team
was beginning what most people con
sidered a rebuilding year. Inexperi
ence at the guaru position showed it
self early, and the ( ard quickly fell to
a 2-4 record over winter break.
But Folkl came back, the guards
matured, and things began to click.
Stanford went on to win 19 of its last
20 games of the regular season to
claim its ninth Pac-l()title in lOyears.
Hut disaster struck a week prior to the
tournament.
First senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard blew out her knee in the season
finale against Oregon State. Just
three days later Folkl suffered the
same fate on the first play of practice,
and the Card found itself without two
of its top three scorers and rebound
ers for the tournament.
But Stanford still had the No. 1
seed and homecourt advantage for
the first two rounds. That, however,
was not enough as 16th-seeded Har
vard pulled off the biggest upset in
tournament history and became the
first team to defeat Stanford at
Maples in four years.
Meanwhile, men's hoops got its
first year in the post-Brevin era under
way by embarking on the best start in
the school's history. An 18-0 record
and a No. 4 ranking were on the line
when defending national champ Ari
zona came to town. But this year the
Card wasn't ready, and the Wildcats
dismantled Stanford.
The Card went on to drop three of
its next four games but rebounded in
time for the tournament, set to top
last season's Sweet Sixteen run this
year.
Stanford's exciting two-point win
over Rhode Island propelled the
Card into the Final Four for the first
time in 56 years, and moved point
guard Arthur Lee past the questions
of living up to predecessor Brevin
Knight. Stanford gave a valiant effort
against Kentucky in the national
semifinal but fell 86-85 in overtime to
the eventual national champion.
Not to be outdone over spring

break, the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams pulled < >ff a na
tional championship sweep to give
Stanford its third and fourth N( A A
titles.
For the women's team, a national
championship meant the return of
the NCAA title to its proper home
after a one-year hiatus. NC A A swim
mer of the year Misty I Ivman, a fresh
man, used five record-setting perfor
mances to help guide the ( ard to a
422-378 win over second-place Ari
zona.
If the men wanted to complete the
sweep and regain the national cham
pionship for the first time since 1994.
they had to dethrone defending na
tional champ Auburn in the ligers'
own pool.
It was expected to be a close meet,
but all 16 Stanford swimmers scored
points for the Card en route to the
second-highest point total in NCAA
history. Stanford ran away with the
crown and left Auburn at a distant
second.
The synchronized swimming team
also garnered a national champi
onship over spring break, although
not an NCAA title. Synchro is not an
NCAA sanctioned sport, but that
didn't stop the Card from claiming its
first national title over the 13-time de
fending champion Ohio State.
As spring got under way. the base
ball team was still sitting on top of the
polls. The preseason No. 1. Stanford
dominated the competition all the
way through the season, winning
every series. But somehow it all went
wrong.
The Card dropped its final series
of the year to USC at home, then
went on the road to lose the Pac-10
crown to Washington. Stanford
dropped from the top spot the last
week of the regular season but still
got a top seed and were set to host the
West Regional.
Loyola Marymount was the first
round oppc>nent. and the ( ardinalof
fense was anemic. Stanford dropped
the game 6-2. Ihe Card seemingly
bounced back bv trouncing Minneso
ta 1 9-1 the next day. but Long Beach
State spelled the end of Stanford's
season. The 49ers pulled off the upset
victory that ended the Card's season
en route to a College World Series
appearance of their own.
In a small consolation prize,
Stanford hurler Jeff Austin was
named National Player of the Year
and was picked fourth overall in the
draft as eight Stanford players were
drafted.
While baseball was disappointed
with its regional showing, the Stan
ford softball team was making the
first regional appearance in the histo
ry of the program. By far the most
successful year of the softball pro
gram, the Cardinal broke into the na

tional rankings for the first time and
climbed as high as No. 9.
A third-place finish in the perenni
ally tough Pac-10 and sweeps over
UCLA, Washington and other tough
schools garnered Stanford a No. 1
seed in the No. 8 Regional.
The Card traveled Stillwater,
Okla., and prepared itself for the pro
gram's first postseason. A loss to
Southwest Missouri State in its first
game relegated the Card to the
loser's bracket where it fought
through to the regional champi
onship game.
Unfortunately, host Oklahoma
State — an eventual semifinalist at
the Softball College World Series —
was too much in the regional champi
onship. and the Card's season ended
two victories short of the World Se
ries.
The tennis teams were dominant

as always this spring. Head coach
Dick Gould described his men's
squad as the best team he had ever
coached — high praise from a man
with 16 national championships. But
the Card lived up to its coach's asser
tion.
Stanford cruised through the sea
son with a perfect record and were
more frustrated over things like los
ing the doubles point than any com
petitor it faced.
Athens, Ga., was the site of the
NCAA Championships, and Stan
ford stormed all the way through the
tournament, without dropping a
match, to give seniors Paul Goldstein
and Charles Hoeveler the fourth na
tional title of their careers.
Sophomore Mike Bryan pulled
off the triple crown of men's colle
giate tennis, winning the singles
crown and the doubles title with part

ner Bob Bryan to go along with Stan
ford's team title.
The women were once again sec
ond in the nation behind Florida and
even beat the Gators to claim the
NCAA Indoor title. Stanford domi
nated in the conference, claiming yet
another Pac-10 title, and senior Julie
Scott claimed her third consecutive
Pac-10 singles crown.
But Stanford's quest for a repeat
national title was ended by No. 3
Duke in the national semifinal. Scott
and fellow senior Ania Bleszvnski
were highly successful in the individ
ual draws. Scott was upended in the
semifinal, just missing an all-Stanford
final as Bleszynski advanced all the
way to the championship game be
fore falling in straight sets.
With baseball done early, most
sports fans had completed the
NCAA title count at five, but the

men's track and field team almost
had something to say about that. The
men's team was leading the meet
heading into the final race, hut
Arkansas made a great comeback to
overtake the Card and win the title by
71/2 points.
The women placed ninth in the
meet, marking the first time ever that
both the men's and women's teams
finished in the top 10. Senior Monal
Chockshi captured the NCAA title in
the 3,(XX) meters for the women,
while the men garnered two individ
ual titles — Toby Stevenson in the
pole vault and Brad Hauser in the
H).(XK) meters.
One last look buck
When you win the Sear's Cup every
year, there's a lot to talk about. With
so much success and triumph over the
last four vears, it's amazing that anv

athlete or team can stand out for
more than just a few minutes.
From men's tennis' four NCAA
titles to all the club teams. Stanford is
the most dominant sports machine
ever created. I've read comparisons
of the Farm to ancient Greece, and
even though I laugh, there's some
truth to it.
Over the past four years, r.o schtxil
has come close to matching Stan
ford's excellence on the playing
fields. When teams finish second or
drop out in the national semifinal and
we express our disappointment with
their finish, something's wrong.
But then again, sports have been
s<.) good for so long here, and that's
what we expect. And looking back at
the accomplishments of the last four
years in Stanford sports. I would have
to say the athletes here definitely did
not disappoint.
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of

the most exciting regionals in recent
memory. Alabama was on the plate
for the Card in the regional semifinal,
and the Crimson Tide was a mouth
ful.
Alabama was able to force over
time, and with Starbird on the bench
with five fouls, the Tide had to like its
chances. But Alabama didn't count
on the heroics of then-sophomore
Naomi Mulitauaopele. In front of her
hometown crowd in Seattle, Muli
tauaopele scored Stanford's only
four points in overtime. But it wasn't
over until Alabama All-American
Shalonda Enis took a length-of-the
floor pass and missed the six-footer
that would have tied the game.
Auburn proved to be not much
more than a stepping block in the re
gional final, and the Card was off to a
second consecutive Final Four.
Georgia was the opponent there, and
Naismith Player of the Year Saudia
Roundtree was unstoppable as the
Lady Dawgs jumped out to a ridicu
lous lead. Stanford wouldn't quit,
though and fought back to within
five. The Card had opportunities to
cut into the lead but in the end fell to
Georgia 86-76.
Perhaps the biggest shock of the
winter came when the women's
swimming team lost a meet to USC.
Stanford's win streak in dual meets
dated back to 1988. and by this point
hadn't we come to expect them to win
all the time?
Swimming never loses, and it
didn't the rest of the year. The
women struck back with a
vengeance, claiming a Pac-10 title be
fore crushing the competition for a
fifth straight national championship.
Sunken Diamond got lights, and
baseball won its first night game 5-0
over Cal State-Fullerton. After a 10-
11 start in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion. the team finished up with 18
straight wins, earning the right to host
a regional. But losses to Florida State
and Cal State-Northridge stopped
baseball's season just short of the
World Series.
NCAA action came to the Farm in
the form of men's gymnastics, as
Maples Pavilion was the site of the
championships. The men were hop
ing to repeat as national champs, but
came in third. But Stanford's lan
Bachrach and Jamie Ellis won indi
vidual titles in the floor exercise and
parallel bars, respectively.
Women's tennis was undefeated
in the Pac-10, winning a ninth consec
utive conference title. But top
ranked Florida got in the way at
NCAAs. and the women settled for
national runner-up.
The men. on the other hand, had
fallen victim to UCLA every time the
schools faced during the season. The
Bruins were the favorite, but Stan
ford pulled off the repeat by beating

UCLA in the final for the first time all
year.
Men's golf claimed its first-ever
West Regional title in the last year
with Woods, who won the individual
title. The team headed to NCAAs
hoping to regain the national crown it
lost the year before. WotxJs ran away
with the individual title, but as a team
the Card placed fourth.
The underdog women came even
closer than the men. By the third
round, the Card was in a two-way tie
for first heading into the final round.
But Stanford faltered in the final
round and ended up fifth, eight
strokes behind champion Arizona.
IW6-97
At the beginning of the year, you
could pick out at least 10 Stanford
teams that had a legitimate shot of
winning the national title. The only
way to describe most of Stanford's
athletic teams was loaded, and if ever
there was a year in which the Card
could break the record of five NC A A
titles, it was 19%-97.
By the end of winter break we
were half way there. Women's and
men's cross country got things going
first by sweeping the Pac-10 titles and
then by taking both NCAA titles.
The men crushed favored Arkansas
46-74, and the women pulled out a
closer win over Villanova 101-106.
Women's volleyball garnered the
other national title at the break, the
program's third in five years. Early
losses proved the Card wasn't invinci
ble, and in the absence of then-junior
Lisa Sharpley, Stanford was
stretched to five games against a
weak Cal team.
But a win over then-No. 1 Hawaii
in Honolulu just before season's end
showed that the Card was more than
capable of climbing back to the top.
When the NCAA tournament began,
Stanford got the top seed in the West
and were clearly on a mission.
The previous season's Final Four
loss was quite the motivator, and the
women stormed back to the national
semifinal. This time the Card took
down defending national champion
Nebraska in four games and set up a
rematch with Hawaii.
The Rainbows didn't stand a
chance. In the most lopsided champi
onship match in history, the Card ran
away with a 15-7.15-3,15-5 win. Stan
ford freshman Kerri Walsh garnered
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors. and the Card had four All-Amer
icans.
Both soccer teams got new coach
es for the start of the 1996-97 season,
and although the men's team strug
gled. the women jumped out to a
good start. That was quickly halted by
a mid-season slump, and the Card
turned it on at the end with a four
game win streak to claim the Pac-10
crown and an automatic NCAA

berth.
For the second year in a row Stan
lord drew Santa Clara in the first
round of the tournament, and this
year the Broncos jumped out to a 3-0
halftime lead in cold, windy condi
tions. But the Card gave a valiant ef
fort in the second, fighting back for
two goals and falling just short 3-2.
Football, meanwhile, got off to a
horrible start. With a 2-5 record,
things looked bleak as they headed to
Los Angeles to take on the Bruins.
But a late fourth quarter drive that
spanned 80 yards and ended with a
Brian Manning reception in the end
zone was the turnaround to the
Card's season. Stanford left the Rose
Bowl with a 21-20 victory over
UCLA and followed that by sweep
ing the California schools on its way
to a Sun Bowl berth.
Michigan State was the Card's op
ponent. and the team put on a clinic
for the Spartans. Quarterback Chad
Hutchinson earned MVP honors as
Stanford cruised 38-0 in the Card's
first shutout in 22 years.

While the football team was cele
brating its postseason bliss, the water
polo team was perhaps cursing the
NCAA selection committee. Despite
being the No. 2 team in the nation
most of the season and finishing the
MPSF tournament second behind
No. 1 USC, Stanford was overlooked
for one of two MFSF berths to the
tourney. Instead the NCAA took
sixth-place UCLA, which edged the
Card in the season series.
Field hockey set new standards in
the fall of ILW6.1 L W6. An early 10-game win
streak was a sign of the ( animal's
dominance over West Coast teams,
and Stanford went on to claim the
Northern Pacific title in a triple over
time win over Cal.
When hoops got underway, it was
with the knowledge that preseason
All-American pick Kristin Folkl
would not plav. The two-sport star
announced in the fall that she would
take the year off from basketball.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal was the
preseason No. 1 and a hands down fa
vorite to claim a national title.

The Card started the season by
handling No. 2 Alabama and then a
few weeks later stormed into the
Thompson-Boling Arena to take on
defending-national champion Ten
nessee. Stanford performance's was
enough to prompt Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt's remark that this
was the best team Tara VanDerveer
had ever coached at Stanford.
The juniors and seniors on the
squad clearly remembered the em
barrassing loss from two seasons be
fore and were quite content to be the
first Cardinal team to defeat the Lady
Volunteers on their home court. But
the celebration didn't last long as Old
Dominion upset the Card two days
later.
Stanford rebounded from the loss
to remain undefeated for the rest of
the season. Senior Kate Starbird was
dominant in the Pac-10 and secured
both conference and national player
of the year honors en route to be
coming the school's all-time leading
scorer on an emotional Senior Night.
An injurv bug in the post prompt-

Ed Folkl's return with five games left
in the regular season, and the Card
possessed what was likely the deep
est. most talented team in the tourna
ment. A No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional sent Stanford to Missoula,
Mont., where senior point guard
Jamila Wideman put on a show.
Wideman garnered Regional
MVP honors as Stanford first ousted
Virginia and then exacted revenge
from the previous year on Georgia
with a crushing 82-47 win to advance
to the Final Four.
Old Dominion was waiting in
Cincinnati, and no one thought the
Card would lose to the Lady Mon
archs twice, especially not with
Kristin Folkl. Stanford jumped out to
a 15-point lead in the first half hut saw
Old Dominion surge hack and go up
late in the game.
Senior guard Charmin Smith iced
two free throws to send the game into
overtime. But none of Stanford's
three shots in the closing 12 seconds
of the extra frame would drop, and
the Card fell 83-82.
The "Maples Massacre" took
place when UCLA came to Maples
to take on the men's basketball team.
The Bruins suffered the worst loss in
their program's history at the hands
of the Card MW-61. Eventual national
champion Arizona also went down in
Maples, this one on a buzzer-heater
from Sauer for the 81 -80 win.
When the tournament began,
Stanford was set up for a subregional
contest with Wake Forest and nation
al player of the year Tim Duncan.
The Card pushed, fouled and leaned
on Duncan for 40 minutes, and when
the game was over Stanford found it
self headed for the program's first
ever Sweet Sixteen appearance.
The sensational Brevm Knight hit
an incredible shot to send Stanford's
Sweet Sixteen debut against Utah
into overtime but couldn't pull out
the win. I tah advanced with an 82-77
victory, but men's hoops had com
pleted a total transformation during
the Brevin Knight years.
With three national titles already
in the bag and women's hoops, men's
and women's swimming and foiling
all capable of w inning national titles,
the record five NCAA titles was in
jeopardy over spring break. But the
Card w as surprisingly zero for spring
break.
Auburn was dominating in the
men's swimming competition, and
the Card settled for second. USC
pulled off the upset win over the
women's team, edging Stanford by
just 11 points. Fencing finished a best
ever third at nationals over spring
break, but even that finish was below
the team's aspirations.
The synchronized swimming team
came closer than any other program
to claiming a national title over spring
break. But in the end Stanford fell 13
hundredths of a point short to Ohio
State.
Meanwhile, men's volleyball was
tearing its wa\ through the competi
tion. Ranked No. I for part of the sea
son. they took out nval UCLA in the
MPSF tournament final to automati
cally advance to the Final Four. Ball
State went down in a quick three
game match in the semifinal to set up
a rematch with the Bruins for the na
tional title.
Stanford looked poised to claim
the program's first national champi
onship by taking the first two games
from the Bruins. But UCLA fought

mates.
back to win games three and four with
relative ease and sent the game into a
rally-scored, determining fifth game.
Stanford went up early, but the
Bruins fought back to take the lead.
With the game tied at 13, UCLA
served into the net to set up champi
onship point. Stanford got a block for
the point and the year's fourth
NCAA title.
Men's and women's tennis did the
rest.
The women were undefeated
through the Pac-10, and then-junior
Julie Scott claimed her second
straight Pac-10 singles title. Florida
was still the favorite when the
NCAAs began, but this time the
Gators would have to come through
the Farm. The Taube Family Tennis
Stadium was the site of the NCAA
championships, and the Cardinal
once again tied its record five NCAA
titles here at home.
Florida fell to Stanford this time in
a rematch of the previous year's na
tional championship match. Fresh
man Lilia Osterloh went on to claim
the NCAA singles title, and all that
was left for Stanford sports fans was
to watch the men's team in Los An
geles.
UCLA was the clear favorite, but
the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal wouldn't be
turned away that easily. Senior Grant
Elliot pulled out the win in a three-set
match to clench the third consecutive
national title for men's tennis and the
sixth of the year for Stanford sports.
But the year was far from over.
Women's golf placed second at Pac
10s and had an outside shot at the na
tional title, finishing fourth at
NCAAs. Track won Big Meet, and
for the men it was the first time in 25
years. But if any team had a shot at
giving Stanford its seventh national
title, it was baseball.
Stanford once again got the pre
season No 1. ranking. The Card went
on to sweep USC for the first time in
six years, but didn't clinch the Six-Pac

title until the final game of its season
ending series against UCLA. Peter
son broke Jack McDowell's strikeout
record and as a team, the Card set a
new record for homeruns in a season.
The Card got to host a regional in
the NCAA tournament. This year,
the Card swept through the West Re
gional on its way to Omaha, Neb., for
the World Series. There Stanford
took care of Auburn but lost to
Louisiana State. The Card won one
more over Auburn to stave off elimi
nation, but Louisiana State was too
much. The Tigers beat the Card again
en route to their second-straight
NCAA title.
1997-98
With the kickoff of the 1997 foot
ball season, predictions of a "rosy fu
ture" had students making plans for
New Year's in Pasadena. The Cardi
nal even jumped out strong with a 3-1
record heading into a matchup with
then-unranked Notre Dame.
The Card's only loss was a re
spectable 28-17 loss to then-No. 6
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Mean
while, the Fighting Irish entered the
contest on a three-game losing streak.
Stanford won the contest 33-15 in
front of more than 75,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
That was the high point. From that
point on, it just got worse. Five
straight losses to Pac-10 opponents
gave Stanford a 4-6 record heading
into the 100 th Big Game.
With no shot at a bowl game on
the line for either squad, Stanford's
one-point win in the contest didn't
mean a whole lot. The finish was ex
citing, and postgame jeers to the Cal
student section prompted Bears fans
to tear down the goal posts. We may
have won the game, but their fans
made our students look like the Wee
nies.
Meanwhile the men's and
women's cross country teams were
doing their best to make a repeat run
at the national title. Both squads won
the Pac-10 titles for a second year in a
row, but entering NCAAs, the
women were expected to win rather
than the men.

While the women's team were the
top-ranked team in the nation, the
men were second to Arkansas, and a
loss to the Razorbacks would not
have been considered a great upset.
However, the men would not be
turned away and garnered a second
consecutive NCAA title with a 53-56
win over Arkansas.
The women were not as fortunate,
and the Card just missed a double re
peat. Brigham Young edged Stanford
by a score of 100-102 in a race that in
cluded two very close finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second
runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Fresh
man Ann Ramsey was the other key
factor, placing 51st with an identical
time to the three runners who placed
ahead of her — all by just fractions of
a second. Either point swing could
have garnered the double repeat
Stanford was hoping for.
The men's and women's soccer
teams seemingly had a reversal of for
tunes last fall. The women's team got
off to an uncharacteristically poor
start, losing four straight early in the
season and dropping its first two Pac
-10 games to drop to 4-7.
But Stanford turned things
around and finished the year without
another loss. That wasn't enough for
the NCAA selection committee,
however, and conference champ
UCLA was the Pac-10's lone repre
sentative in the tournament.
The men's team had a banner
year. The wins kept piling up, and the
squad continually climbed up the
rankings. The Card claimed its first
division title and reached the No. 2
ranking. Stanford than faced off
against top-ranked Indiana. But
that's where things started heading
south.
The Card's 2-1 loss to Indiana
would not have been detrimental
alone, but the five-game skid it
sparked brought a quick end to Stan
ford's season. After losses to San
Francisco and Santa Clara, the Card
faced off against UCLA for the
MPSF title and lost 1-0. Stanford still
got a bid to the NCAA tourney but
fell in a tough overtime battle to

Washington 2-1.
Field hockey also put up the best
numbers in the program's history.
The squad was ranked in the top 20,
and a successful road trip to the East
was promising early on. Stanford
even cruised to a second straight Nor-
Pac title and a 16-6 record (the most
wins in school history), but the per
formance was not enough for the
team to receive an at-large bid into
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Water polo was surprisingly over
looked by the NCAA selection com
mittee for the second year in a row.
Again the Cardinal was ranked
among the nation's top three or four
all year long, only to get snubbed by
the selection committee after not
winning the MFSF tournament.
Again Stanford placed second in the
conference tourney, and again the
second MFSF bid to the NCAA tour
nament went to another team, leav
ing the No. 3 squad in the nation out
of the national tournament.
The women's volleyball team
started its quest for history on shaky
ground. Two of the Card's three re
turning Ail-Americans were side
lined with injuries, and Stanford's 50-
match home win streak came to a halt
when Penn State came to town.
But Stanford began its romp
through the Pac-10, and slowly the
team began to improve. Kristin Folkl
was having a career-year even by her
standards and walked away with Pac
-10 Player of the Year honors as Stan
ford won yet another conference title.
When the tournament started,
Penn State was the overwhelming fa
vorite. But the Nittany Lions didn't
have the kind of experience the Card
carried in its five seniors, and Stan
ford's quest for a historic fourth
NCAA title and a third for the seniors
was inevitable.
Stanford went through UC-Santa
Barbara and Long Beach State, who
boasted National Player of the Year
Misty May, en route to a national
championship rematch with the Nit
tany Lions. The match lived up to its
billing in the form of a five-game bat
tle that the Card pulled out on a Folkl
kill.

Hut while Folkl was earning the
third national title and fourth All-
America honors of her career in vol
leyball. the women's basketball team
was beginning what most people con
sidered a rebuilding year. Inexperi
ence at the guaru position showed it
self early, and the ( ard quickly fell to
a 2-4 record over winter break.
But Folkl came back, the guards
matured, and things began to click.
Stanford went on to win 19 of its last
20 games of the regular season to
claim its ninth Pac-l()title in lOyears.
Hut disaster struck a week prior to the
tournament.
First senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard blew out her knee in the season
finale against Oregon State. Just
three days later Folkl suffered the
same fate on the first play of practice,
and the Card found itself without two
of its top three scorers and rebound
ers for the tournament.
But Stanford still had the No. 1
seed and homecourt advantage for
the first two rounds. That, however,
was not enough as 16th-seeded Har
vard pulled off the biggest upset in
tournament history and became the
first team to defeat Stanford at
Maples in four years.
Meanwhile, men's hoops got its
first year in the post-Brevin era under
way by embarking on the best start in
the school's history. An 18-0 record
and a No. 4 ranking were on the line
when defending national champ Ari
zona came to town. But this year the
Card wasn't ready, and the Wildcats
dismantled Stanford.
The Card went on to drop three of
its next four games but rebounded in
time for the tournament, set to top
last season's Sweet Sixteen run this
year.
Stanford's exciting two-point win
over Rhode Island propelled the
Card into the Final Four for the first
time in 56 years, and moved point
guard Arthur Lee past the questions
of living up to predecessor Brevin
Knight. Stanford gave a valiant effort
against Kentucky in the national
semifinal but fell 86-85 in overtime to
the eventual national champion.
Not to be outdone over spring

break, the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams pulled < >ff a na
tional championship sweep to give
Stanford its third and fourth N( A A
titles.
For the women's team, a national
championship meant the return of
the NCAA title to its proper home
after a one-year hiatus. NC A A swim
mer of the year Misty I Ivman, a fresh
man, used five record-setting perfor
mances to help guide the ( ard to a
422-378 win over second-place Ari
zona.
If the men wanted to complete the
sweep and regain the national cham
pionship for the first time since 1994.
they had to dethrone defending na
tional champ Auburn in the ligers'
own pool.
It was expected to be a close meet,
but all 16 Stanford swimmers scored
points for the Card en route to the
second-highest point total in NCAA
history. Stanford ran away with the
crown and left Auburn at a distant
second.
The synchronized swimming team
also garnered a national champi
onship over spring break, although
not an NCAA title. Synchro is not an
NCAA sanctioned sport, but that
didn't stop the Card from claiming its
first national title over the 13-time de
fending champion Ohio State.
As spring got under way. the base
ball team was still sitting on top of the
polls. The preseason No. 1. Stanford
dominated the competition all the
way through the season, winning
every series. But somehow it all went
wrong.
The Card dropped its final series
of the year to USC at home, then
went on the road to lose the Pac-10
crown to Washington. Stanford
dropped from the top spot the last
week of the regular season but still
got a top seed and were set to host the
West Regional.
Loyola Marymount was the first
round oppc>nent. and the ( ardinalof
fense was anemic. Stanford dropped
the game 6-2. Ihe Card seemingly
bounced back bv trouncing Minneso
ta 1 9-1 the next day. but Long Beach
State spelled the end of Stanford's
season. The 49ers pulled off the upset
victory that ended the Card's season
en route to a College World Series
appearance of their own.
In a small consolation prize,
Stanford hurler Jeff Austin was
named National Player of the Year
and was picked fourth overall in the
draft as eight Stanford players were
drafted.
While baseball was disappointed
with its regional showing, the Stan
ford softball team was making the
first regional appearance in the histo
ry of the program. By far the most
successful year of the softball pro
gram, the Cardinal broke into the na

tional rankings for the first time and
climbed as high as No. 9.
A third-place finish in the perenni
ally tough Pac-10 and sweeps over
UCLA, Washington and other tough
schools garnered Stanford a No. 1
seed in the No. 8 Regional.
The Card traveled Stillwater,
Okla., and prepared itself for the pro
gram's first postseason. A loss to
Southwest Missouri State in its first
game relegated the Card to the
loser's bracket where it fought
through to the regional champi
onship game.
Unfortunately, host Oklahoma
State — an eventual semifinalist at
the Softball College World Series —
was too much in the regional champi
onship. and the Card's season ended
two victories short of the World Se
ries.
The tennis teams were dominant

as always this spring. Head coach
Dick Gould described his men's
squad as the best team he had ever
coached — high praise from a man
with 16 national championships. But
the Card lived up to its coach's asser
tion.
Stanford cruised through the sea
son with a perfect record and were
more frustrated over things like los
ing the doubles point than any com
petitor it faced.
Athens, Ga., was the site of the
NCAA Championships, and Stan
ford stormed all the way through the
tournament, without dropping a
match, to give seniors Paul Goldstein
and Charles Hoeveler the fourth na
tional title of their careers.
Sophomore Mike Bryan pulled
off the triple crown of men's colle
giate tennis, winning the singles
crown and the doubles title with part

ner Bob Bryan to go along with Stan
ford's team title.
The women were once again sec
ond in the nation behind Florida and
even beat the Gators to claim the
NCAA Indoor title. Stanford domi
nated in the conference, claiming yet
another Pac-10 title, and senior Julie
Scott claimed her third consecutive
Pac-10 singles crown.
But Stanford's quest for a repeat
national title was ended by No. 3
Duke in the national semifinal. Scott
and fellow senior Ania Bleszvnski
were highly successful in the individ
ual draws. Scott was upended in the
semifinal, just missing an all-Stanford
final as Bleszynski advanced all the
way to the championship game be
fore falling in straight sets.
With baseball done early, most
sports fans had completed the
NCAA title count at five, but the

men's track and field team almost
had something to say about that. The
men's team was leading the meet
heading into the final race, hut
Arkansas made a great comeback to
overtake the Card and win the title by
71/2 points.
The women placed ninth in the
meet, marking the first time ever that
both the men's and women's teams
finished in the top 10. Senior Monal
Chockshi captured the NCAA title in
the 3,(XX) meters for the women,
while the men garnered two individ
ual titles — Toby Stevenson in the
pole vault and Brad Hauser in the
H).(XK) meters.
One last look buck
When you win the Sear's Cup every
year, there's a lot to talk about. With
so much success and triumph over the
last four vears, it's amazing that anv

athlete or team can stand out for
more than just a few minutes.
From men's tennis' four NCAA
titles to all the club teams. Stanford is
the most dominant sports machine
ever created. I've read comparisons
of the Farm to ancient Greece, and
even though I laugh, there's some
truth to it.
Over the past four years, r.o schtxil
has come close to matching Stan
ford's excellence on the playing
fields. When teams finish second or
drop out in the national semifinal and
we express our disappointment with
their finish, something's wrong.
But then again, sports have been
s<.) good for so long here, and that's
what we expect. And looking back at
the accomplishments of the last four
years in Stanford sports. I would have
to say the athletes here definitely did
not disappoint.
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of

the most exciting regionals in recent
memory. Alabama was on the plate
for the Card in the regional semifinal,
and the Crimson Tide was a mouth
ful.
Alabama was able to force over
time, and with Starbird on the bench
with five fouls, the Tide had to like its
chances. But Alabama didn't count
on the heroics of then-sophomore
Naomi Mulitauaopele. In front of her
hometown crowd in Seattle, Muli
tauaopele scored Stanford's only
four points in overtime. But it wasn't
over until Alabama All-American
Shalonda Enis took a length-of-the
floor pass and missed the six-footer
that would have tied the game.
Auburn proved to be not much
more than a stepping block in the re
gional final, and the Card was off to a
second consecutive Final Four.
Georgia was the opponent there, and
Naismith Player of the Year Saudia
Roundtree was unstoppable as the
Lady Dawgs jumped out to a ridicu
lous lead. Stanford wouldn't quit,
though and fought back to within
five. The Card had opportunities to
cut into the lead but in the end fell to
Georgia 86-76.
Perhaps the biggest shock of the
winter came when the women's
swimming team lost a meet to USC.
Stanford's win streak in dual meets
dated back to 1988. and by this point
hadn't we come to expect them to win
all the time?
Swimming never loses, and it
didn't the rest of the year. The
women struck back with a
vengeance, claiming a Pac-10 title be
fore crushing the competition for a
fifth straight national championship.
Sunken Diamond got lights, and
baseball won its first night game 5-0
over Cal State-Fullerton. After a 10-
11 start in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion. the team finished up with 18
straight wins, earning the right to host
a regional. But losses to Florida State
and Cal State-Northridge stopped
baseball's season just short of the
World Series.
NCAA action came to the Farm in
the form of men's gymnastics, as
Maples Pavilion was the site of the
championships. The men were hop
ing to repeat as national champs, but
came in third. But Stanford's lan
Bachrach and Jamie Ellis won indi
vidual titles in the floor exercise and
parallel bars, respectively.
Women's tennis was undefeated
in the Pac-10, winning a ninth consec
utive conference title. But top
ranked Florida got in the way at
NCAAs. and the women settled for
national runner-up.
The men. on the other hand, had
fallen victim to UCLA every time the
schools faced during the season. The
Bruins were the favorite, but Stan
ford pulled off the repeat by beating

UCLA in the final for the first time all
year.
Men's golf claimed its first-ever
West Regional title in the last year
with Woods, who won the individual
title. The team headed to NCAAs
hoping to regain the national crown it
lost the year before. WotxJs ran away
with the individual title, but as a team
the Card placed fourth.
The underdog women came even
closer than the men. By the third
round, the Card was in a two-way tie
for first heading into the final round.
But Stanford faltered in the final
round and ended up fifth, eight
strokes behind champion Arizona.
IW6-97
At the beginning of the year, you
could pick out at least 10 Stanford
teams that had a legitimate shot of
winning the national title. The only
way to describe most of Stanford's
athletic teams was loaded, and if ever
there was a year in which the Card
could break the record of five NC A A
titles, it was 19%-97.
By the end of winter break we
were half way there. Women's and
men's cross country got things going
first by sweeping the Pac-10 titles and
then by taking both NCAA titles.
The men crushed favored Arkansas
46-74, and the women pulled out a
closer win over Villanova 101-106.
Women's volleyball garnered the
other national title at the break, the
program's third in five years. Early
losses proved the Card wasn't invinci
ble, and in the absence of then-junior
Lisa Sharpley, Stanford was
stretched to five games against a
weak Cal team.
But a win over then-No. 1 Hawaii
in Honolulu just before season's end
showed that the Card was more than
capable of climbing back to the top.
When the NCAA tournament began,
Stanford got the top seed in the West
and were clearly on a mission.
The previous season's Final Four
loss was quite the motivator, and the
women stormed back to the national
semifinal. This time the Card took
down defending national champion
Nebraska in four games and set up a
rematch with Hawaii.
The Rainbows didn't stand a
chance. In the most lopsided champi
onship match in history, the Card ran
away with a 15-7.15-3,15-5 win. Stan
ford freshman Kerri Walsh garnered
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors. and the Card had four All-Amer
icans.
Both soccer teams got new coach
es for the start of the 1996-97 season,
and although the men's team strug
gled. the women jumped out to a
good start. That was quickly halted by
a mid-season slump, and the Card
turned it on at the end with a four
game win streak to claim the Pac-10
crown and an automatic NCAA

berth.
For the second year in a row Stan
lord drew Santa Clara in the first
round of the tournament, and this
year the Broncos jumped out to a 3-0
halftime lead in cold, windy condi
tions. But the Card gave a valiant ef
fort in the second, fighting back for
two goals and falling just short 3-2.
Football, meanwhile, got off to a
horrible start. With a 2-5 record,
things looked bleak as they headed to
Los Angeles to take on the Bruins.
But a late fourth quarter drive that
spanned 80 yards and ended with a
Brian Manning reception in the end
zone was the turnaround to the
Card's season. Stanford left the Rose
Bowl with a 21-20 victory over
UCLA and followed that by sweep
ing the California schools on its way
to a Sun Bowl berth.
Michigan State was the Card's op
ponent. and the team put on a clinic
for the Spartans. Quarterback Chad
Hutchinson earned MVP honors as
Stanford cruised 38-0 in the Card's
first shutout in 22 years.

While the football team was cele
brating its postseason bliss, the water
polo team was perhaps cursing the
NCAA selection committee. Despite
being the No. 2 team in the nation
most of the season and finishing the
MPSF tournament second behind
No. 1 USC, Stanford was overlooked
for one of two MFSF berths to the
tourney. Instead the NCAA took
sixth-place UCLA, which edged the
Card in the season series.
Field hockey set new standards in
the fall of ILW6.1 L W6. An early 10-game win
streak was a sign of the ( animal's
dominance over West Coast teams,
and Stanford went on to claim the
Northern Pacific title in a triple over
time win over Cal.
When hoops got underway, it was
with the knowledge that preseason
All-American pick Kristin Folkl
would not plav. The two-sport star
announced in the fall that she would
take the year off from basketball.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal was the
preseason No. 1 and a hands down fa
vorite to claim a national title.

The Card started the season by
handling No. 2 Alabama and then a
few weeks later stormed into the
Thompson-Boling Arena to take on
defending-national champion Ten
nessee. Stanford performance's was
enough to prompt Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt's remark that this
was the best team Tara VanDerveer
had ever coached at Stanford.
The juniors and seniors on the
squad clearly remembered the em
barrassing loss from two seasons be
fore and were quite content to be the
first Cardinal team to defeat the Lady
Volunteers on their home court. But
the celebration didn't last long as Old
Dominion upset the Card two days
later.
Stanford rebounded from the loss
to remain undefeated for the rest of
the season. Senior Kate Starbird was
dominant in the Pac-10 and secured
both conference and national player
of the year honors en route to be
coming the school's all-time leading
scorer on an emotional Senior Night.
An injurv bug in the post prompt-

Ed Folkl's return with five games left
in the regular season, and the Card
possessed what was likely the deep
est. most talented team in the tourna
ment. A No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional sent Stanford to Missoula,
Mont., where senior point guard
Jamila Wideman put on a show.
Wideman garnered Regional
MVP honors as Stanford first ousted
Virginia and then exacted revenge
from the previous year on Georgia
with a crushing 82-47 win to advance
to the Final Four.
Old Dominion was waiting in
Cincinnati, and no one thought the
Card would lose to the Lady Mon
archs twice, especially not with
Kristin Folkl. Stanford jumped out to
a 15-point lead in the first half hut saw
Old Dominion surge hack and go up
late in the game.
Senior guard Charmin Smith iced
two free throws to send the game into
overtime. But none of Stanford's
three shots in the closing 12 seconds
of the extra frame would drop, and
the Card fell 83-82.
The "Maples Massacre" took
place when UCLA came to Maples
to take on the men's basketball team.
The Bruins suffered the worst loss in
their program's history at the hands
of the Card MW-61. Eventual national
champion Arizona also went down in
Maples, this one on a buzzer-heater
from Sauer for the 81 -80 win.
When the tournament began,
Stanford was set up for a subregional
contest with Wake Forest and nation
al player of the year Tim Duncan.
The Card pushed, fouled and leaned
on Duncan for 40 minutes, and when
the game was over Stanford found it
self headed for the program's first
ever Sweet Sixteen appearance.
The sensational Brevm Knight hit
an incredible shot to send Stanford's
Sweet Sixteen debut against Utah
into overtime but couldn't pull out
the win. I tah advanced with an 82-77
victory, but men's hoops had com
pleted a total transformation during
the Brevin Knight years.
With three national titles already
in the bag and women's hoops, men's
and women's swimming and foiling
all capable of w inning national titles,
the record five NCAA titles was in
jeopardy over spring break. But the
Card w as surprisingly zero for spring
break.
Auburn was dominating in the
men's swimming competition, and
the Card settled for second. USC
pulled off the upset win over the
women's team, edging Stanford by
just 11 points. Fencing finished a best
ever third at nationals over spring
break, but even that finish was below
the team's aspirations.
The synchronized swimming team
came closer than any other program
to claiming a national title over spring
break. But in the end Stanford fell 13
hundredths of a point short to Ohio
State.
Meanwhile, men's volleyball was
tearing its wa\ through the competi
tion. Ranked No. I for part of the sea
son. they took out nval UCLA in the
MPSF tournament final to automati
cally advance to the Final Four. Ball
State went down in a quick three
game match in the semifinal to set up
a rematch with the Bruins for the na
tional title.
Stanford looked poised to claim
the program's first national champi
onship by taking the first two games
from the Bruins. But UCLA fought

mates.
back to win games three and four with
relative ease and sent the game into a
rally-scored, determining fifth game.
Stanford went up early, but the
Bruins fought back to take the lead.
With the game tied at 13, UCLA
served into the net to set up champi
onship point. Stanford got a block for
the point and the year's fourth
NCAA title.
Men's and women's tennis did the
rest.
The women were undefeated
through the Pac-10, and then-junior
Julie Scott claimed her second
straight Pac-10 singles title. Florida
was still the favorite when the
NCAAs began, but this time the
Gators would have to come through
the Farm. The Taube Family Tennis
Stadium was the site of the NCAA
championships, and the Cardinal
once again tied its record five NCAA
titles here at home.
Florida fell to Stanford this time in
a rematch of the previous year's na
tional championship match. Fresh
man Lilia Osterloh went on to claim
the NCAA singles title, and all that
was left for Stanford sports fans was
to watch the men's team in Los An
geles.
UCLA was the clear favorite, but
the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal wouldn't be
turned away that easily. Senior Grant
Elliot pulled out the win in a three-set
match to clench the third consecutive
national title for men's tennis and the
sixth of the year for Stanford sports.
But the year was far from over.
Women's golf placed second at Pac
10s and had an outside shot at the na
tional title, finishing fourth at
NCAAs. Track won Big Meet, and
for the men it was the first time in 25
years. But if any team had a shot at
giving Stanford its seventh national
title, it was baseball.
Stanford once again got the pre
season No 1. ranking. The Card went
on to sweep USC for the first time in
six years, but didn't clinch the Six-Pac

title until the final game of its season
ending series against UCLA. Peter
son broke Jack McDowell's strikeout
record and as a team, the Card set a
new record for homeruns in a season.
The Card got to host a regional in
the NCAA tournament. This year,
the Card swept through the West Re
gional on its way to Omaha, Neb., for
the World Series. There Stanford
took care of Auburn but lost to
Louisiana State. The Card won one
more over Auburn to stave off elimi
nation, but Louisiana State was too
much. The Tigers beat the Card again
en route to their second-straight
NCAA title.
1997-98
With the kickoff of the 1997 foot
ball season, predictions of a "rosy fu
ture" had students making plans for
New Year's in Pasadena. The Cardi
nal even jumped out strong with a 3-1
record heading into a matchup with
then-unranked Notre Dame.
The Card's only loss was a re
spectable 28-17 loss to then-No. 6
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Mean
while, the Fighting Irish entered the
contest on a three-game losing streak.
Stanford won the contest 33-15 in
front of more than 75,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
That was the high point. From that
point on, it just got worse. Five
straight losses to Pac-10 opponents
gave Stanford a 4-6 record heading
into the 100 th Big Game.
With no shot at a bowl game on
the line for either squad, Stanford's
one-point win in the contest didn't
mean a whole lot. The finish was ex
citing, and postgame jeers to the Cal
student section prompted Bears fans
to tear down the goal posts. We may
have won the game, but their fans
made our students look like the Wee
nies.
Meanwhile the men's and
women's cross country teams were
doing their best to make a repeat run
at the national title. Both squads won
the Pac-10 titles for a second year in a
row, but entering NCAAs, the
women were expected to win rather
than the men.

While the women's team were the
top-ranked team in the nation, the
men were second to Arkansas, and a
loss to the Razorbacks would not
have been considered a great upset.
However, the men would not be
turned away and garnered a second
consecutive NCAA title with a 53-56
win over Arkansas.
The women were not as fortunate,
and the Card just missed a double re
peat. Brigham Young edged Stanford
by a score of 100-102 in a race that in
cluded two very close finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second
runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Fresh
man Ann Ramsey was the other key
factor, placing 51st with an identical
time to the three runners who placed
ahead of her — all by just fractions of
a second. Either point swing could
have garnered the double repeat
Stanford was hoping for.
The men's and women's soccer
teams seemingly had a reversal of for
tunes last fall. The women's team got
off to an uncharacteristically poor
start, losing four straight early in the
season and dropping its first two Pac
-10 games to drop to 4-7.
But Stanford turned things
around and finished the year without
another loss. That wasn't enough for
the NCAA selection committee,
however, and conference champ
UCLA was the Pac-10's lone repre
sentative in the tournament.
The men's team had a banner
year. The wins kept piling up, and the
squad continually climbed up the
rankings. The Card claimed its first
division title and reached the No. 2
ranking. Stanford than faced off
against top-ranked Indiana. But
that's where things started heading
south.
The Card's 2-1 loss to Indiana
would not have been detrimental
alone, but the five-game skid it
sparked brought a quick end to Stan
ford's season. After losses to San
Francisco and Santa Clara, the Card
faced off against UCLA for the
MPSF title and lost 1-0. Stanford still
got a bid to the NCAA tourney but
fell in a tough overtime battle to

Washington 2-1.
Field hockey also put up the best
numbers in the program's history.
The squad was ranked in the top 20,
and a successful road trip to the East
was promising early on. Stanford
even cruised to a second straight Nor-
Pac title and a 16-6 record (the most
wins in school history), but the per
formance was not enough for the
team to receive an at-large bid into
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Water polo was surprisingly over
looked by the NCAA selection com
mittee for the second year in a row.
Again the Cardinal was ranked
among the nation's top three or four
all year long, only to get snubbed by
the selection committee after not
winning the MFSF tournament.
Again Stanford placed second in the
conference tourney, and again the
second MFSF bid to the NCAA tour
nament went to another team, leav
ing the No. 3 squad in the nation out
of the national tournament.
The women's volleyball team
started its quest for history on shaky
ground. Two of the Card's three re
turning Ail-Americans were side
lined with injuries, and Stanford's 50-
match home win streak came to a halt
when Penn State came to town.
But Stanford began its romp
through the Pac-10, and slowly the
team began to improve. Kristin Folkl
was having a career-year even by her
standards and walked away with Pac
-10 Player of the Year honors as Stan
ford won yet another conference title.
When the tournament started,
Penn State was the overwhelming fa
vorite. But the Nittany Lions didn't
have the kind of experience the Card
carried in its five seniors, and Stan
ford's quest for a historic fourth
NCAA title and a third for the seniors
was inevitable.
Stanford went through UC-Santa
Barbara and Long Beach State, who
boasted National Player of the Year
Misty May, en route to a national
championship rematch with the Nit
tany Lions. The match lived up to its
billing in the form of a five-game bat
tle that the Card pulled out on a Folkl
kill.

Hut while Folkl was earning the
third national title and fourth All-
America honors of her career in vol
leyball. the women's basketball team
was beginning what most people con
sidered a rebuilding year. Inexperi
ence at the guaru position showed it
self early, and the ( ard quickly fell to
a 2-4 record over winter break.
But Folkl came back, the guards
matured, and things began to click.
Stanford went on to win 19 of its last
20 games of the regular season to
claim its ninth Pac-l()title in lOyears.
Hut disaster struck a week prior to the
tournament.
First senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard blew out her knee in the season
finale against Oregon State. Just
three days later Folkl suffered the
same fate on the first play of practice,
and the Card found itself without two
of its top three scorers and rebound
ers for the tournament.
But Stanford still had the No. 1
seed and homecourt advantage for
the first two rounds. That, however,
was not enough as 16th-seeded Har
vard pulled off the biggest upset in
tournament history and became the
first team to defeat Stanford at
Maples in four years.
Meanwhile, men's hoops got its
first year in the post-Brevin era under
way by embarking on the best start in
the school's history. An 18-0 record
and a No. 4 ranking were on the line
when defending national champ Ari
zona came to town. But this year the
Card wasn't ready, and the Wildcats
dismantled Stanford.
The Card went on to drop three of
its next four games but rebounded in
time for the tournament, set to top
last season's Sweet Sixteen run this
year.
Stanford's exciting two-point win
over Rhode Island propelled the
Card into the Final Four for the first
time in 56 years, and moved point
guard Arthur Lee past the questions
of living up to predecessor Brevin
Knight. Stanford gave a valiant effort
against Kentucky in the national
semifinal but fell 86-85 in overtime to
the eventual national champion.
Not to be outdone over spring

break, the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams pulled < >ff a na
tional championship sweep to give
Stanford its third and fourth N( A A
titles.
For the women's team, a national
championship meant the return of
the NCAA title to its proper home
after a one-year hiatus. NC A A swim
mer of the year Misty I Ivman, a fresh
man, used five record-setting perfor
mances to help guide the ( ard to a
422-378 win over second-place Ari
zona.
If the men wanted to complete the
sweep and regain the national cham
pionship for the first time since 1994.
they had to dethrone defending na
tional champ Auburn in the ligers'
own pool.
It was expected to be a close meet,
but all 16 Stanford swimmers scored
points for the Card en route to the
second-highest point total in NCAA
history. Stanford ran away with the
crown and left Auburn at a distant
second.
The synchronized swimming team
also garnered a national champi
onship over spring break, although
not an NCAA title. Synchro is not an
NCAA sanctioned sport, but that
didn't stop the Card from claiming its
first national title over the 13-time de
fending champion Ohio State.
As spring got under way. the base
ball team was still sitting on top of the
polls. The preseason No. 1. Stanford
dominated the competition all the
way through the season, winning
every series. But somehow it all went
wrong.
The Card dropped its final series
of the year to USC at home, then
went on the road to lose the Pac-10
crown to Washington. Stanford
dropped from the top spot the last
week of the regular season but still
got a top seed and were set to host the
West Regional.
Loyola Marymount was the first
round oppc>nent. and the ( ardinalof
fense was anemic. Stanford dropped
the game 6-2. Ihe Card seemingly
bounced back bv trouncing Minneso
ta 1 9-1 the next day. but Long Beach
State spelled the end of Stanford's
season. The 49ers pulled off the upset
victory that ended the Card's season
en route to a College World Series
appearance of their own.
In a small consolation prize,
Stanford hurler Jeff Austin was
named National Player of the Year
and was picked fourth overall in the
draft as eight Stanford players were
drafted.
While baseball was disappointed
with its regional showing, the Stan
ford softball team was making the
first regional appearance in the histo
ry of the program. By far the most
successful year of the softball pro
gram, the Cardinal broke into the na

tional rankings for the first time and
climbed as high as No. 9.
A third-place finish in the perenni
ally tough Pac-10 and sweeps over
UCLA, Washington and other tough
schools garnered Stanford a No. 1
seed in the No. 8 Regional.
The Card traveled Stillwater,
Okla., and prepared itself for the pro
gram's first postseason. A loss to
Southwest Missouri State in its first
game relegated the Card to the
loser's bracket where it fought
through to the regional champi
onship game.
Unfortunately, host Oklahoma
State — an eventual semifinalist at
the Softball College World Series —
was too much in the regional champi
onship. and the Card's season ended
two victories short of the World Se
ries.
The tennis teams were dominant

as always this spring. Head coach
Dick Gould described his men's
squad as the best team he had ever
coached — high praise from a man
with 16 national championships. But
the Card lived up to its coach's asser
tion.
Stanford cruised through the sea
son with a perfect record and were
more frustrated over things like los
ing the doubles point than any com
petitor it faced.
Athens, Ga., was the site of the
NCAA Championships, and Stan
ford stormed all the way through the
tournament, without dropping a
match, to give seniors Paul Goldstein
and Charles Hoeveler the fourth na
tional title of their careers.
Sophomore Mike Bryan pulled
off the triple crown of men's colle
giate tennis, winning the singles
crown and the doubles title with part

ner Bob Bryan to go along with Stan
ford's team title.
The women were once again sec
ond in the nation behind Florida and
even beat the Gators to claim the
NCAA Indoor title. Stanford domi
nated in the conference, claiming yet
another Pac-10 title, and senior Julie
Scott claimed her third consecutive
Pac-10 singles crown.
But Stanford's quest for a repeat
national title was ended by No. 3
Duke in the national semifinal. Scott
and fellow senior Ania Bleszvnski
were highly successful in the individ
ual draws. Scott was upended in the
semifinal, just missing an all-Stanford
final as Bleszynski advanced all the
way to the championship game be
fore falling in straight sets.
With baseball done early, most
sports fans had completed the
NCAA title count at five, but the

men's track and field team almost
had something to say about that. The
men's team was leading the meet
heading into the final race, hut
Arkansas made a great comeback to
overtake the Card and win the title by
71/2 points.
The women placed ninth in the
meet, marking the first time ever that
both the men's and women's teams
finished in the top 10. Senior Monal
Chockshi captured the NCAA title in
the 3,(XX) meters for the women,
while the men garnered two individ
ual titles — Toby Stevenson in the
pole vault and Brad Hauser in the
H).(XK) meters.
One last look buck
When you win the Sear's Cup every
year, there's a lot to talk about. With
so much success and triumph over the
last four vears, it's amazing that anv

athlete or team can stand out for
more than just a few minutes.
From men's tennis' four NCAA
titles to all the club teams. Stanford is
the most dominant sports machine
ever created. I've read comparisons
of the Farm to ancient Greece, and
even though I laugh, there's some
truth to it.
Over the past four years, r.o schtxil
has come close to matching Stan
ford's excellence on the playing
fields. When teams finish second or
drop out in the national semifinal and
we express our disappointment with
their finish, something's wrong.
But then again, sports have been
s<.) good for so long here, and that's
what we expect. And looking back at
the accomplishments of the last four
years in Stanford sports. I would have
to say the athletes here definitely did
not disappoint.
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of

the most exciting regionals in recent
memory. Alabama was on the plate
for the Card in the regional semifinal,
and the Crimson Tide was a mouth
ful.
Alabama was able to force over
time, and with Starbird on the bench
with five fouls, the Tide had to like its
chances. But Alabama didn't count
on the heroics of then-sophomore
Naomi Mulitauaopele. In front of her
hometown crowd in Seattle, Muli
tauaopele scored Stanford's only
four points in overtime. But it wasn't
over until Alabama All-American
Shalonda Enis took a length-of-the
floor pass and missed the six-footer
that would have tied the game.
Auburn proved to be not much
more than a stepping block in the re
gional final, and the Card was off to a
second consecutive Final Four.
Georgia was the opponent there, and
Naismith Player of the Year Saudia
Roundtree was unstoppable as the
Lady Dawgs jumped out to a ridicu
lous lead. Stanford wouldn't quit,
though and fought back to within
five. The Card had opportunities to
cut into the lead but in the end fell to
Georgia 86-76.
Perhaps the biggest shock of the
winter came when the women's
swimming team lost a meet to USC.
Stanford's win streak in dual meets
dated back to 1988. and by this point
hadn't we come to expect them to win
all the time?
Swimming never loses, and it
didn't the rest of the year. The
women struck back with a
vengeance, claiming a Pac-10 title be
fore crushing the competition for a
fifth straight national championship.
Sunken Diamond got lights, and
baseball won its first night game 5-0
over Cal State-Fullerton. After a 10-
11 start in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion. the team finished up with 18
straight wins, earning the right to host
a regional. But losses to Florida State
and Cal State-Northridge stopped
baseball's season just short of the
World Series.
NCAA action came to the Farm in
the form of men's gymnastics, as
Maples Pavilion was the site of the
championships. The men were hop
ing to repeat as national champs, but
came in third. But Stanford's lan
Bachrach and Jamie Ellis won indi
vidual titles in the floor exercise and
parallel bars, respectively.
Women's tennis was undefeated
in the Pac-10, winning a ninth consec
utive conference title. But top
ranked Florida got in the way at
NCAAs. and the women settled for
national runner-up.
The men. on the other hand, had
fallen victim to UCLA every time the
schools faced during the season. The
Bruins were the favorite, but Stan
ford pulled off the repeat by beating

UCLA in the final for the first time all
year.
Men's golf claimed its first-ever
West Regional title in the last year
with Woods, who won the individual
title. The team headed to NCAAs
hoping to regain the national crown it
lost the year before. WotxJs ran away
with the individual title, but as a team
the Card placed fourth.
The underdog women came even
closer than the men. By the third
round, the Card was in a two-way tie
for first heading into the final round.
But Stanford faltered in the final
round and ended up fifth, eight
strokes behind champion Arizona.
IW6-97
At the beginning of the year, you
could pick out at least 10 Stanford
teams that had a legitimate shot of
winning the national title. The only
way to describe most of Stanford's
athletic teams was loaded, and if ever
there was a year in which the Card
could break the record of five NC A A
titles, it was 19%-97.
By the end of winter break we
were half way there. Women's and
men's cross country got things going
first by sweeping the Pac-10 titles and
then by taking both NCAA titles.
The men crushed favored Arkansas
46-74, and the women pulled out a
closer win over Villanova 101-106.
Women's volleyball garnered the
other national title at the break, the
program's third in five years. Early
losses proved the Card wasn't invinci
ble, and in the absence of then-junior
Lisa Sharpley, Stanford was
stretched to five games against a
weak Cal team.
But a win over then-No. 1 Hawaii
in Honolulu just before season's end
showed that the Card was more than
capable of climbing back to the top.
When the NCAA tournament began,
Stanford got the top seed in the West
and were clearly on a mission.
The previous season's Final Four
loss was quite the motivator, and the
women stormed back to the national
semifinal. This time the Card took
down defending national champion
Nebraska in four games and set up a
rematch with Hawaii.
The Rainbows didn't stand a
chance. In the most lopsided champi
onship match in history, the Card ran
away with a 15-7.15-3,15-5 win. Stan
ford freshman Kerri Walsh garnered
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors. and the Card had four All-Amer
icans.
Both soccer teams got new coach
es for the start of the 1996-97 season,
and although the men's team strug
gled. the women jumped out to a
good start. That was quickly halted by
a mid-season slump, and the Card
turned it on at the end with a four
game win streak to claim the Pac-10
crown and an automatic NCAA

berth.
For the second year in a row Stan
lord drew Santa Clara in the first
round of the tournament, and this
year the Broncos jumped out to a 3-0
halftime lead in cold, windy condi
tions. But the Card gave a valiant ef
fort in the second, fighting back for
two goals and falling just short 3-2.
Football, meanwhile, got off to a
horrible start. With a 2-5 record,
things looked bleak as they headed to
Los Angeles to take on the Bruins.
But a late fourth quarter drive that
spanned 80 yards and ended with a
Brian Manning reception in the end
zone was the turnaround to the
Card's season. Stanford left the Rose
Bowl with a 21-20 victory over
UCLA and followed that by sweep
ing the California schools on its way
to a Sun Bowl berth.
Michigan State was the Card's op
ponent. and the team put on a clinic
for the Spartans. Quarterback Chad
Hutchinson earned MVP honors as
Stanford cruised 38-0 in the Card's
first shutout in 22 years.

While the football team was cele
brating its postseason bliss, the water
polo team was perhaps cursing the
NCAA selection committee. Despite
being the No. 2 team in the nation
most of the season and finishing the
MPSF tournament second behind
No. 1 USC, Stanford was overlooked
for one of two MFSF berths to the
tourney. Instead the NCAA took
sixth-place UCLA, which edged the
Card in the season series.
Field hockey set new standards in
the fall of ILW6.1 L W6. An early 10-game win
streak was a sign of the ( animal's
dominance over West Coast teams,
and Stanford went on to claim the
Northern Pacific title in a triple over
time win over Cal.
When hoops got underway, it was
with the knowledge that preseason
All-American pick Kristin Folkl
would not plav. The two-sport star
announced in the fall that she would
take the year off from basketball.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal was the
preseason No. 1 and a hands down fa
vorite to claim a national title.

The Card started the season by
handling No. 2 Alabama and then a
few weeks later stormed into the
Thompson-Boling Arena to take on
defending-national champion Ten
nessee. Stanford performance's was
enough to prompt Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt's remark that this
was the best team Tara VanDerveer
had ever coached at Stanford.
The juniors and seniors on the
squad clearly remembered the em
barrassing loss from two seasons be
fore and were quite content to be the
first Cardinal team to defeat the Lady
Volunteers on their home court. But
the celebration didn't last long as Old
Dominion upset the Card two days
later.
Stanford rebounded from the loss
to remain undefeated for the rest of
the season. Senior Kate Starbird was
dominant in the Pac-10 and secured
both conference and national player
of the year honors en route to be
coming the school's all-time leading
scorer on an emotional Senior Night.
An injurv bug in the post prompt-

Ed Folkl's return with five games left
in the regular season, and the Card
possessed what was likely the deep
est. most talented team in the tourna
ment. A No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional sent Stanford to Missoula,
Mont., where senior point guard
Jamila Wideman put on a show.
Wideman garnered Regional
MVP honors as Stanford first ousted
Virginia and then exacted revenge
from the previous year on Georgia
with a crushing 82-47 win to advance
to the Final Four.
Old Dominion was waiting in
Cincinnati, and no one thought the
Card would lose to the Lady Mon
archs twice, especially not with
Kristin Folkl. Stanford jumped out to
a 15-point lead in the first half hut saw
Old Dominion surge hack and go up
late in the game.
Senior guard Charmin Smith iced
two free throws to send the game into
overtime. But none of Stanford's
three shots in the closing 12 seconds
of the extra frame would drop, and
the Card fell 83-82.
The "Maples Massacre" took
place when UCLA came to Maples
to take on the men's basketball team.
The Bruins suffered the worst loss in
their program's history at the hands
of the Card MW-61. Eventual national
champion Arizona also went down in
Maples, this one on a buzzer-heater
from Sauer for the 81 -80 win.
When the tournament began,
Stanford was set up for a subregional
contest with Wake Forest and nation
al player of the year Tim Duncan.
The Card pushed, fouled and leaned
on Duncan for 40 minutes, and when
the game was over Stanford found it
self headed for the program's first
ever Sweet Sixteen appearance.
The sensational Brevm Knight hit
an incredible shot to send Stanford's
Sweet Sixteen debut against Utah
into overtime but couldn't pull out
the win. I tah advanced with an 82-77
victory, but men's hoops had com
pleted a total transformation during
the Brevin Knight years.
With three national titles already
in the bag and women's hoops, men's
and women's swimming and foiling
all capable of w inning national titles,
the record five NCAA titles was in
jeopardy over spring break. But the
Card w as surprisingly zero for spring
break.
Auburn was dominating in the
men's swimming competition, and
the Card settled for second. USC
pulled off the upset win over the
women's team, edging Stanford by
just 11 points. Fencing finished a best
ever third at nationals over spring
break, but even that finish was below
the team's aspirations.
The synchronized swimming team
came closer than any other program
to claiming a national title over spring
break. But in the end Stanford fell 13
hundredths of a point short to Ohio
State.
Meanwhile, men's volleyball was
tearing its wa\ through the competi
tion. Ranked No. I for part of the sea
son. they took out nval UCLA in the
MPSF tournament final to automati
cally advance to the Final Four. Ball
State went down in a quick three
game match in the semifinal to set up
a rematch with the Bruins for the na
tional title.
Stanford looked poised to claim
the program's first national champi
onship by taking the first two games
from the Bruins. But UCLA fought

finale a memorable one. going the distance for the victory and promptly getting dogpiled by his team
mates.
back to win games three and four with
relative ease and sent the game into a
rally-scored, determining fifth game.
Stanford went up early, but the
Bruins fought back to take the lead.
With the game tied at 13, UCLA
served into the net to set up champi
onship point. Stanford got a block for
the point and the year's fourth
NCAA title.
Men's and women's tennis did the
rest.
The women were undefeated
through the Pac-10, and then-junior
Julie Scott claimed her second
straight Pac-10 singles title. Florida
was still the favorite when the
NCAAs began, but this time the
Gators would have to come through
the Farm. The Taube Family Tennis
Stadium was the site of the NCAA
championships, and the Cardinal
once again tied its record five NCAA
titles here at home.
Florida fell to Stanford this time in
a rematch of the previous year's na
tional championship match. Fresh
man Lilia Osterloh went on to claim
the NCAA singles title, and all that
was left for Stanford sports fans was
to watch the men's team in Los An
geles.
UCLA was the clear favorite, but
the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal wouldn't be
turned away that easily. Senior Grant
Elliot pulled out the win in a three-set
match to clench the third consecutive
national title for men's tennis and the
sixth of the year for Stanford sports.
But the year was far from over.
Women's golf placed second at Pac
10s and had an outside shot at the na
tional title, finishing fourth at
NCAAs. Track won Big Meet, and
for the men it was the first time in 25
years. But if any team had a shot at
giving Stanford its seventh national
title, it was baseball.
Stanford once again got the pre
season No 1. ranking. The Card went
on to sweep USC for the first time in
six years, but didn't clinch the Six-Pac

title until the final game of its season
ending series against UCLA. Peter
son broke Jack McDowell's strikeout
record and as a team, the Card set a
new record for homeruns in a season.
The Card got to host a regional in
the NCAA tournament. This year,
the Card swept through the West Re
gional on its way to Omaha, Neb., for
the World Series. There Stanford
took care of Auburn but lost to
Louisiana State. The Card won one
more over Auburn to stave off elimi
nation, but Louisiana State was too
much. The Tigers beat the Card again
en route to their second-straight
NCAA title.
1997-98
With the kickoff of the 1997 foot
ball season, predictions of a "rosy fu
ture" had students making plans for
New Year's in Pasadena. The Cardi
nal even jumped out strong with a 3-1
record heading into a matchup with
then-unranked Notre Dame.
The Card's only loss was a re
spectable 28-17 loss to then-No. 6
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Mean
while, the Fighting Irish entered the
contest on a three-game losing streak.
Stanford won the contest 33-15 in
front of more than 75,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
That was the high point. From that
point on, it just got worse. Five
straight losses to Pac-10 opponents
gave Stanford a 4-6 record heading
into the 100 th Big Game.
With no shot at a bowl game on
the line for either squad, Stanford's
one-point win in the contest didn't
mean a whole lot. The finish was ex
citing, and postgame jeers to the Cal
student section prompted Bears fans
to tear down the goal posts. We may
have won the game, but their fans
made our students look like the Wee
nies.
Meanwhile the men's and
women's cross country teams were
doing their best to make a repeat run
at the national title. Both squads won
the Pac-10 titles for a second year in a
row, but entering NCAAs, the
women were expected to win rather
than the men.

While the women's team were the
top-ranked team in the nation, the
men were second to Arkansas, and a
loss to the Razorbacks would not
have been considered a great upset.
However, the men would not be
turned away and garnered a second
consecutive NCAA title with a 53-56
win over Arkansas.
The women were not as fortunate,
and the Card just missed a double re
peat. Brigham Young edged Stanford
by a score of 100-102 in a race that in
cluded two very close finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second
runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Fresh
man Ann Ramsey was the other key
factor, placing 51st with an identical
time to the three runners who placed
ahead of her — all by just fractions of
a second. Either point swing could
have garnered the double repeat
Stanford was hoping for.
The men's and women's soccer
teams seemingly had a reversal of for
tunes last fall. The women's team got
off to an uncharacteristically poor
start, losing four straight early in the
season and dropping its first two Pac
-10 games to drop to 4-7.
But Stanford turned things
around and finished the year without
another loss. That wasn't enough for
the NCAA selection committee,
however, and conference champ
UCLA was the Pac-10's lone repre
sentative in the tournament.
The men's team had a banner
year. The wins kept piling up, and the
squad continually climbed up the
rankings. The Card claimed its first
division title and reached the No. 2
ranking. Stanford than faced off
against top-ranked Indiana. But
that's where things started heading
south.
The Card's 2-1 loss to Indiana
would not have been detrimental
alone, but the five-game skid it
sparked brought a quick end to Stan
ford's season. After losses to San
Francisco and Santa Clara, the Card
faced off against UCLA for the
MPSF title and lost 1-0. Stanford still
got a bid to the NCAA tourney but
fell in a tough overtime battle to

Washington 2-1.
Field hockey also put up the best
numbers in the program's history.
The squad was ranked in the top 20,
and a successful road trip to the East
was promising early on. Stanford
even cruised to a second straight Nor-
Pac title and a 16-6 record (the most
wins in school history), but the per
formance was not enough for the
team to receive an at-large bid into
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Water polo was surprisingly over
looked by the NCAA selection com
mittee for the second year in a row.
Again the Cardinal was ranked
among the nation's top three or four
all year long, only to get snubbed by
the selection committee after not
winning the MFSF tournament.
Again Stanford placed second in the
conference tourney, and again the
second MFSF bid to the NCAA tour
nament went to another team, leav
ing the No. 3 squad in the nation out
of the national tournament.
The women's volleyball team
started its quest for history on shaky
ground. Two of the Card's three re
turning Ail-Americans were side
lined with injuries, and Stanford's 50-
match home win streak came to a halt
when Penn State came to town.
But Stanford began its romp
through the Pac-10, and slowly the
team began to improve. Kristin Folkl
was having a career-year even by her
standards and walked away with Pac
-10 Player of the Year honors as Stan
ford won yet another conference title.
When the tournament started,
Penn State was the overwhelming fa
vorite. But the Nittany Lions didn't
have the kind of experience the Card
carried in its five seniors, and Stan
ford's quest for a historic fourth
NCAA title and a third for the seniors
was inevitable.
Stanford went through UC-Santa
Barbara and Long Beach State, who
boasted National Player of the Year
Misty May, en route to a national
championship rematch with the Nit
tany Lions. The match lived up to its
billing in the form of a five-game bat
tle that the Card pulled out on a Folkl
kill.

Hut while Folkl was earning the
third national title and fourth All-
America honors of her career in vol
leyball. the women's basketball team
was beginning what most people con
sidered a rebuilding year. Inexperi
ence at the guaru position showed it
self early, and the ( ard quickly fell to
a 2-4 record over winter break.
But Folkl came back, the guards
matured, and things began to click.
Stanford went on to win 19 of its last
20 games of the regular season to
claim its ninth Pac-l()title in lOyears.
Hut disaster struck a week prior to the
tournament.
First senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard blew out her knee in the season
finale against Oregon State. Just
three days later Folkl suffered the
same fate on the first play of practice,
and the Card found itself without two
of its top three scorers and rebound
ers for the tournament.
But Stanford still had the No. 1
seed and homecourt advantage for
the first two rounds. That, however,
was not enough as 16th-seeded Har
vard pulled off the biggest upset in
tournament history and became the
first team to defeat Stanford at
Maples in four years.
Meanwhile, men's hoops got its
first year in the post-Brevin era under
way by embarking on the best start in
the school's history. An 18-0 record
and a No. 4 ranking were on the line
when defending national champ Ari
zona came to town. But this year the
Card wasn't ready, and the Wildcats
dismantled Stanford.
The Card went on to drop three of
its next four games but rebounded in
time for the tournament, set to top
last season's Sweet Sixteen run this
year.
Stanford's exciting two-point win
over Rhode Island propelled the
Card into the Final Four for the first
time in 56 years, and moved point
guard Arthur Lee past the questions
of living up to predecessor Brevin
Knight. Stanford gave a valiant effort
against Kentucky in the national
semifinal but fell 86-85 in overtime to
the eventual national champion.
Not to be outdone over spring

break, the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams pulled < >ff a na
tional championship sweep to give
Stanford its third and fourth N( A A
titles.
For the women's team, a national
championship meant the return of
the NCAA title to its proper home
after a one-year hiatus. NC A A swim
mer of the year Misty I Ivman, a fresh
man, used five record-setting perfor
mances to help guide the ( ard to a
422-378 win over second-place Ari
zona.
If the men wanted to complete the
sweep and regain the national cham
pionship for the first time since 1994.
they had to dethrone defending na
tional champ Auburn in the ligers'
own pool.
It was expected to be a close meet,
but all 16 Stanford swimmers scored
points for the Card en route to the
second-highest point total in NCAA
history. Stanford ran away with the
crown and left Auburn at a distant
second.
The synchronized swimming team
also garnered a national champi
onship over spring break, although
not an NCAA title. Synchro is not an
NCAA sanctioned sport, but that
didn't stop the Card from claiming its
first national title over the 13-time de
fending champion Ohio State.
As spring got under way. the base
ball team was still sitting on top of the
polls. The preseason No. 1. Stanford
dominated the competition all the
way through the season, winning
every series. But somehow it all went
wrong.
The Card dropped its final series
of the year to USC at home, then
went on the road to lose the Pac-10
crown to Washington. Stanford
dropped from the top spot the last
week of the regular season but still
got a top seed and were set to host the
West Regional.
Loyola Marymount was the first
round oppc>nent. and the ( ardinalof
fense was anemic. Stanford dropped
the game 6-2. Ihe Card seemingly
bounced back bv trouncing Minneso
ta 1 9-1 the next day. but Long Beach
State spelled the end of Stanford's
season. The 49ers pulled off the upset
victory that ended the Card's season
en route to a College World Series
appearance of their own.
In a small consolation prize,
Stanford hurler Jeff Austin was
named National Player of the Year
and was picked fourth overall in the
draft as eight Stanford players were
drafted.
While baseball was disappointed
with its regional showing, the Stan
ford softball team was making the
first regional appearance in the histo
ry of the program. By far the most
successful year of the softball pro
gram, the Cardinal broke into the na

tional rankings for the first time and
climbed as high as No. 9.
A third-place finish in the perenni
ally tough Pac-10 and sweeps over
UCLA, Washington and other tough
schools garnered Stanford a No. 1
seed in the No. 8 Regional.
The Card traveled Stillwater,
Okla., and prepared itself for the pro
gram's first postseason. A loss to
Southwest Missouri State in its first
game relegated the Card to the
loser's bracket where it fought
through to the regional champi
onship game.
Unfortunately, host Oklahoma
State — an eventual semifinalist at
the Softball College World Series —
was too much in the regional champi
onship. and the Card's season ended
two victories short of the World Se
ries.
The tennis teams were dominant

as always this spring. Head coach
Dick Gould described his men's
squad as the best team he had ever
coached — high praise from a man
with 16 national championships. But
the Card lived up to its coach's asser
tion.
Stanford cruised through the sea
son with a perfect record and were
more frustrated over things like los
ing the doubles point than any com
petitor it faced.
Athens, Ga., was the site of the
NCAA Championships, and Stan
ford stormed all the way through the
tournament, without dropping a
match, to give seniors Paul Goldstein
and Charles Hoeveler the fourth na
tional title of their careers.
Sophomore Mike Bryan pulled
off the triple crown of men's colle
giate tennis, winning the singles
crown and the doubles title with part

ner Bob Bryan to go along with Stan
ford's team title.
The women were once again sec
ond in the nation behind Florida and
even beat the Gators to claim the
NCAA Indoor title. Stanford domi
nated in the conference, claiming yet
another Pac-10 title, and senior Julie
Scott claimed her third consecutive
Pac-10 singles crown.
But Stanford's quest for a repeat
national title was ended by No. 3
Duke in the national semifinal. Scott
and fellow senior Ania Bleszvnski
were highly successful in the individ
ual draws. Scott was upended in the
semifinal, just missing an all-Stanford
final as Bleszynski advanced all the
way to the championship game be
fore falling in straight sets.
With baseball done early, most
sports fans had completed the
NCAA title count at five, but the

men's track and field team almost
had something to say about that. The
men's team was leading the meet
heading into the final race, hut
Arkansas made a great comeback to
overtake the Card and win the title by
71/2 points.
The women placed ninth in the
meet, marking the first time ever that
both the men's and women's teams
finished in the top 10. Senior Monal
Chockshi captured the NCAA title in
the 3,(XX) meters for the women,
while the men garnered two individ
ual titles — Toby Stevenson in the
pole vault and Brad Hauser in the
H).(XK) meters.
One last look buck
When you win the Sear's Cup every
year, there's a lot to talk about. With
so much success and triumph over the
last four vears, it's amazing that anv

athlete or team can stand out for
more than just a few minutes.
From men's tennis' four NCAA
titles to all the club teams. Stanford is
the most dominant sports machine
ever created. I've read comparisons
of the Farm to ancient Greece, and
even though I laugh, there's some
truth to it.
Over the past four years, r.o schtxil
has come close to matching Stan
ford's excellence on the playing
fields. When teams finish second or
drop out in the national semifinal and
we express our disappointment with
their finish, something's wrong.
But then again, sports have been
s<.) good for so long here, and that's
what we expect. And looking back at
the accomplishments of the last four
years in Stanford sports. I would have
to say the athletes here definitely did
not disappoint.
With the end of another year and
a fourth straight Sears Cup all but in
the bag, it's time once again to reflect
upon the previous four years of Stan
ford sports.
No university has been as domi
nant as Stanford in the past four
years. Period.
Not only that, but no school has
come anywhere close to the Cardi
nal's sustained excellence on the ath
letic fields over the last four years.
When this year's Sears Cup is award
ed, it will be the fourth consecutive to
come to the Farm.
And all those jokes about renam
ing the Sears Cup, Stanford being a
country at the Olympic Games, etc.
— they're only half funny because
they're not so far from the truth.
Over the last four years, 10 differ
ent athletic programs have brought
home NCAA championships to the
Farm, and four of those have won
multiple times. Men's tennis is a per
fect four for four in that time span,
and women's volleyball and women's
swimming and diving have each gar
nered three titles.
The 1995-% season was consid
ered a down year because the Card
only won two national titles. Stanford
won the Sears Cup. and people con
sidered it a down year. Does that
sound ridiculous to anyone besides
me?
That year saw teams such as
women's volleyball and women's
basketball go back to the Final Four
for the second time in a row. Baseball
won a school-record 18 straight
games; men's hoops almost upset
Massachusetts in the tourney. Foot
ball went to a bowl game; women's
soccer was ranked in the top 10.
Women's tennis was the national
runner-up. Tiger Woods won the in
dividual title in men's golf, and the
women's golf team almost pulled off
an upset at NCAAs. And that was all
in a down year.
The level of expectation at Stan
ford has risen to unbelievable
heights. But what's even scarier is
that, for the most part, the athletic
teams are living up to those expecta
tions. As a lifelong sports junkie, I
couldn't have picked a better school
for exposing myself to the all-around
best that sports has to offer.
I've missed more than my fair
share of classes for the sake of catch
ing a game on a sunny afternoon, and
last year I was even late for a final be
cause the men's basketball team
forced Utah into overtime at the
Sweet Sixteen.
I don't know what I'll do next year
when I'm not living within walking
distance of the home courts, fields,
pools, etc. of the finest athletic teams
in the nation. But for now I'll content
myself with a look back at the past
four years of Stanford sports.
1994-95
This was the year that saw the Car
dinal tie the record for NCAA cham
pionships in one year with five.
Women's volleyball and men's water
polo got things started in the fall as
both tore their way through the regu
lar season and into the NCAA tour
nament with near-perfect records.
Water polo went wire to wire with
the No. 1 ranking and finished the
season 27-1. In the NCAA tourna
ment Stanford needed three wins, in
cluding victories over then-No. 5

UCLA and then-No. 2 USC in the
championship game, to pull off a re
peat as national champions.
The 1994 season for women's vol
leyball could almost be described as
the beginning of an era — the one
that included three national titles and
the likes of Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharp
ley and Barbara Ifejika. The trio were
starters on the squad as freshmen in
1994 and helped guide the Card
through the regular season with just
one loss coming at the hands of
UCLA.
The tourney got under way, and
the stage was set for one last rematch
in the Stanford-UCLA rivalry. Folkl
was named National Freshman of the
Year, and Stanford took the exciting
four-game win over the Bruins to
bring home the Card's second nation
al championship in its last three years.
Women's soccer got off to its best
start in recent years, winning its first
nine games and climbing to the No. 3
ranking with a 13-1 record. The squad
received a top seed in the tourney and
beat Washington 6-5 on penalty kicks
in the first round. But that set up a
game with host Portland, and the
Card fell 2-1 to end the season 16-2-2.
But while the fall was a success for
several Cardinal sports, football was
in a tailspin. Last-second field goals
(either made by an opponent or
missed by the Card) seemed to be a
curse as Stanford suffered early-sea
son one-point losses to Arizona State
and UCLA.
The Card did get its first win over
Washington in 10 years, a 46-28 victo
ry led by backup quarterback Scott
Frost in the second half. The Huskies
were ranked 12th at the time, but just
a few weeks later a failed two-point
conversion meant a 24-23 loss to Cal
and a 3-7-1 finish on the season for
Stanford.
The football program quickly got
a facelift as head coach Bill Walsh an
nounced his resignation. Frost made
his departure for Nebraska, and Ty
rone Willingham was hired to take
over the reins.
Those weren't the only big
changes that year. Women's basket
ball head coach Tara VanDerveer
announced her plans to take a leave
of absence and coach the U.S.
Olympic team, but not before coach
ing her team to its first Final Four ap
pearance since winning the national
championship in 1992.
The Card was ranked No. 2 in the
nation when it visited Knoxville,
Tenn., early that season to take on the
top-ranked Lady Volunteers. Ten
nessee was too much for the Card,
and an embarrassing 105-69 loss set
up a comeback run for Stanford.
The Card only dropped one game
after that and was poised for a top
seed in the NCAA tournament after
winning its sixth Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in seven years. But a Van
derbilt squad with six losses got the
top seed in the West, and Stanford
had to settle for the No. 2 seed.
Nonetheless, the Card beat Pur
due and defending champ North Car
olina on its way to the Final Four,
where it met top-ranked and unde
feated Connecticut. But Stanford's
shooting didn't show up for the game,
and the Huskies polished off the Card
87-60 en route to an undefeated sea
son and a national championship.
Meanwhile, the men's team was
celebrating its first NCAA tourna
ment win in 53 years — a 70-68 win
over seventh-seeded North Carolina-
Charlotte. But before all that, the

Card had seen the hopes of beating
Arizona at home slip away when a
Bart Lammersen putback clanked off
the iron at the end of regulation. In
stead. Arizona outscored the Card in
overtime for the 89-83 win. thanks
mostly to Damon Stoudamire's 45
points.
When the Card visited Los Ange
les to take on then-fourth ranked and
eventual national champion UCLA,
it almost pulled off the win. The Bru
ins slipped away with a 77-74 win.
But all that was forgotten when
the tournament started, and even
though the second-round loss to
Massachusetts and big man Marcus
Camby was expected, it was clear that
Brevin Knight and the rest of the
team had brought the Madness back
to March for most Stanford fans.
While hoops fans were celebrating
March Madness, the swimming
teams were destroying their respec
tive competition. The men's squad
won its 14th consecutive Pac-1() title
with a record point total but fell just
short at NCA As, coming in second to
Michigan.
During the course of the season,
the women's swimming and diving
team pushed its dual-meet win streak
over 50 and entered NCA As favored
to win its fourth consecutive title. The
Wolverines were able to make it
close, but the Card overcame a 20-
point deficit in the final two events to
edge Michigan 497.5-478.5.
Baseball got under way as the na
tion's preseason No. 1. Then-fresh
man Kyle Peterson made a huge im
pact in his rookie year on the Farm.

and despite a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA regionals, the Card advanced
to its first College World Series since
1990.
Men's golf was looking for a re
peat as national champs, and with
freshman phenom Tiger Woods on
the squad, Stanford was everybody's
favorite. But in the end Oklahoma
State got a one-stroke edge on a play
off hole to upset Stanford's repeat
bid.
Tennis and gymnastics also saw
successful seasons. The women's
gymnastics team fought through in
juries all year, but managed to post
the program's best score ever at the
regional. The score was not enough to
advance to the NC A As, but the men
would pick up from there. Ranked
14th heading into the NCAAs. the
men's squad put it together at the
right time and came out with the pro
gram's third national title in four
years.
Both tennis programs cruised
through the Pac-10 with undefeated
records. The women, unfortunately,
suffered a 5-1 loss to Texas in the na
tional semifinal, but the men capped
off a perfect season to win the first of
four consecutive national titles.
1995-%
Football entered the first year of
the Willingham era. women's volley
ball looked to repeat as national
champs, and Stanford sports fans
were still celebrating the record-tying
year it had just completed.
Under Willingham, football got
off to its best start since 19K6. and an

upset win over then-No. 12 Oregon
helped the Card break intothe top 25.
Home losses to Washington and
UCLA cooled oil Stanford's 4-0-1
start, but Stanford was unstoppable
on the road.
The Card also brought the Axe
back to the Farm for the first time
since 11>92l l >92 with a 29-24 win over Cal.
Stanford carried a 7-3-1 record into
the Liberty Bowl but fell short of a
win on New Year's Eve, losing 19-13
to East Carolina.
Women's soccer jumped out to a
great start and was ranked as high as
eighth in the national polls. But top
ranked North Carolina came to town
and halted the ("aid's 22 game home
win streak with a 3-0 win. Stanford
went undefeated in the Pac-10 but
was unlucky in the postseason.
Stanford and seventh ranked
Santa Clara were the only top-10
schools overlooked for first-round
byes, and the two teams squared off
in the first round of the tourney.
After 2 1/2 hours of plav. Santa
Clara stole a 2-1 victory in the fourth
overtime period to end the Cardinal's
season.
The women's volleyball team,
meanwhile, was tearing through the
competition and looking good to re
peat. After dropping two games early
in the season, Stanford cruised
through the Pac-10 without a loss and
entered the tournament on a 25-
match win streak.
After receiving a top seed in the
West, the ('ardinal romped its way to
the Final Four without dropping a
game. But on the dav of Stanford's

semifinal match with then-No. 5
Texas, Debbie Lambert (a sopho
more at the time) tore her anteriour
cruciate ligament. The injury was a
sign of things to come, and the Long
horns dropped the Cardinal in an ex
citing five-game match, 15-13, 0-15,
15-17,15-6.15-12.
Men's water polo slumped late in
the season and pinned its NC'AA
tournament hopes on the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment. but losses to UC-Irvine and
Pepperdine ended Stanford's quest
for a third straight national crown.
When hoops season got under
way. the men were hoping to build on
the success of the previous year's
postseason appearance. The women
were wondering exactly what things
would be like under the helm of co-in
terim head coaches Amy Tucker and
Marianne Stanley.
The men's team rang in the new
year by defeating then-No. 9 Arizona
XO-71 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford's
homecourt advantage was beginning
to grow into the tide of Sixth Man
('lub participants it is today, and the
"Miracle at Maples" came in the form
of a 67-66 win over defending nation
al champ UCLA.
When tournament berths were
handed out. the Cardinal found itself
once again shipped back East and en
route for a second-round matchup
against Massachusetts. This time
Stanford did not go quietly, and an
off-balance Peter Sauer three-point
er would have tied the game at 77-77
with just seconds left. The shot
missed, and two more IJMass free
throws made the final 79-74.
With the loss of its head coach and
then-sophomore Kristin Folkl to the
Olympic Games, as well as the gradu
ation of three seniors, no one really
knew what to expect from the 1995-
96 women's basketball team.
After dropping its first game of the
year to Massachusetts, the Card re
bounded and came home to beat
then-No, 2 Tennessee at Maples.
After a loss at Texas Tech in Decem
ber. Stanford didn't drop another
regular-season game, closing out the
season with a 19-gamc win streak.
An 18-0 Pac-10 mark gave Stan
ford yet another Pac-10 title, and per
formances like her record-breaking
44 against USC gave Kate Starbird
co-player of the year honors in the
conference. For their part. Tucker
and Stanley earned coach of the year
honors.
When the tournament began, the
Card landed a top seed in the West
and began what proved to be one of

the most exciting regionals in recent
memory. Alabama was on the plate
for the Card in the regional semifinal,
and the Crimson Tide was a mouth
ful.
Alabama was able to force over
time, and with Starbird on the bench
with five fouls, the Tide had to like its
chances. But Alabama didn't count
on the heroics of then-sophomore
Naomi Mulitauaopele. In front of her
hometown crowd in Seattle, Muli
tauaopele scored Stanford's only
four points in overtime. But it wasn't
over until Alabama All-American
Shalonda Enis took a length-of-the
floor pass and missed the six-footer
that would have tied the game.
Auburn proved to be not much
more than a stepping block in the re
gional final, and the Card was off to a
second consecutive Final Four.
Georgia was the opponent there, and
Naismith Player of the Year Saudia
Roundtree was unstoppable as the
Lady Dawgs jumped out to a ridicu
lous lead. Stanford wouldn't quit,
though and fought back to within
five. The Card had opportunities to
cut into the lead but in the end fell to
Georgia 86-76.
Perhaps the biggest shock of the
winter came when the women's
swimming team lost a meet to USC.
Stanford's win streak in dual meets
dated back to 1988. and by this point
hadn't we come to expect them to win
all the time?
Swimming never loses, and it
didn't the rest of the year. The
women struck back with a
vengeance, claiming a Pac-10 title be
fore crushing the competition for a
fifth straight national championship.
Sunken Diamond got lights, and
baseball won its first night game 5-0
over Cal State-Fullerton. After a 10-
11 start in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion. the team finished up with 18
straight wins, earning the right to host
a regional. But losses to Florida State
and Cal State-Northridge stopped
baseball's season just short of the
World Series.
NCAA action came to the Farm in
the form of men's gymnastics, as
Maples Pavilion was the site of the
championships. The men were hop
ing to repeat as national champs, but
came in third. But Stanford's lan
Bachrach and Jamie Ellis won indi
vidual titles in the floor exercise and
parallel bars, respectively.
Women's tennis was undefeated
in the Pac-10, winning a ninth consec
utive conference title. But top
ranked Florida got in the way at
NCAAs. and the women settled for
national runner-up.
The men. on the other hand, had
fallen victim to UCLA every time the
schools faced during the season. The
Bruins were the favorite, but Stan
ford pulled off the repeat by beating

UCLA in the final for the first time all
year.
Men's golf claimed its first-ever
West Regional title in the last year
with Woods, who won the individual
title. The team headed to NCAAs
hoping to regain the national crown it
lost the year before. WotxJs ran away
with the individual title, but as a team
the Card placed fourth.
The underdog women came even
closer than the men. By the third
round, the Card was in a two-way tie
for first heading into the final round.
But Stanford faltered in the final
round and ended up fifth, eight
strokes behind champion Arizona.
IW6-97
At the beginning of the year, you
could pick out at least 10 Stanford
teams that had a legitimate shot of
winning the national title. The only
way to describe most of Stanford's
athletic teams was loaded, and if ever
there was a year in which the Card
could break the record of five NC A A
titles, it was 19%-97.
By the end of winter break we
were half way there. Women's and
men's cross country got things going
first by sweeping the Pac-10 titles and
then by taking both NCAA titles.
The men crushed favored Arkansas
46-74, and the women pulled out a
closer win over Villanova 101-106.
Women's volleyball garnered the
other national title at the break, the
program's third in five years. Early
losses proved the Card wasn't invinci
ble, and in the absence of then-junior
Lisa Sharpley, Stanford was
stretched to five games against a
weak Cal team.
But a win over then-No. 1 Hawaii
in Honolulu just before season's end
showed that the Card was more than
capable of climbing back to the top.
When the NCAA tournament began,
Stanford got the top seed in the West
and were clearly on a mission.
The previous season's Final Four
loss was quite the motivator, and the
women stormed back to the national
semifinal. This time the Card took
down defending national champion
Nebraska in four games and set up a
rematch with Hawaii.
The Rainbows didn't stand a
chance. In the most lopsided champi
onship match in history, the Card ran
away with a 15-7.15-3,15-5 win. Stan
ford freshman Kerri Walsh garnered
National Freshman of the Year hon
ors. and the Card had four All-Amer
icans.
Both soccer teams got new coach
es for the start of the 1996-97 season,
and although the men's team strug
gled. the women jumped out to a
good start. That was quickly halted by
a mid-season slump, and the Card
turned it on at the end with a four
game win streak to claim the Pac-10
crown and an automatic NCAA

berth.
For the second year in a row Stan
lord drew Santa Clara in the first
round of the tournament, and this
year the Broncos jumped out to a 3-0
halftime lead in cold, windy condi
tions. But the Card gave a valiant ef
fort in the second, fighting back for
two goals and falling just short 3-2.
Football, meanwhile, got off to a
horrible start. With a 2-5 record,
things looked bleak as they headed to
Los Angeles to take on the Bruins.
But a late fourth quarter drive that
spanned 80 yards and ended with a
Brian Manning reception in the end
zone was the turnaround to the
Card's season. Stanford left the Rose
Bowl with a 21-20 victory over
UCLA and followed that by sweep
ing the California schools on its way
to a Sun Bowl berth.
Michigan State was the Card's op
ponent. and the team put on a clinic
for the Spartans. Quarterback Chad
Hutchinson earned MVP honors as
Stanford cruised 38-0 in the Card's
first shutout in 22 years.

While the football team was cele
brating its postseason bliss, the water
polo team was perhaps cursing the
NCAA selection committee. Despite
being the No. 2 team in the nation
most of the season and finishing the
MPSF tournament second behind
No. 1 USC, Stanford was overlooked
for one of two MFSF berths to the
tourney. Instead the NCAA took
sixth-place UCLA, which edged the
Card in the season series.
Field hockey set new standards in
the fall of ILW6.1 L W6. An early 10-game win
streak was a sign of the ( animal's
dominance over West Coast teams,
and Stanford went on to claim the
Northern Pacific title in a triple over
time win over Cal.
When hoops got underway, it was
with the knowledge that preseason
All-American pick Kristin Folkl
would not plav. The two-sport star
announced in the fall that she would
take the year off from basketball.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal was the
preseason No. 1 and a hands down fa
vorite to claim a national title.

The Card started the season by
handling No. 2 Alabama and then a
few weeks later stormed into the
Thompson-Boling Arena to take on
defending-national champion Ten
nessee. Stanford performance's was
enough to prompt Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt's remark that this
was the best team Tara VanDerveer
had ever coached at Stanford.
The juniors and seniors on the
squad clearly remembered the em
barrassing loss from two seasons be
fore and were quite content to be the
first Cardinal team to defeat the Lady
Volunteers on their home court. But
the celebration didn't last long as Old
Dominion upset the Card two days
later.
Stanford rebounded from the loss
to remain undefeated for the rest of
the season. Senior Kate Starbird was
dominant in the Pac-10 and secured
both conference and national player
of the year honors en route to be
coming the school's all-time leading
scorer on an emotional Senior Night.
An injurv bug in the post prompt-

Ed Folkl's return with five games left
in the regular season, and the Card
possessed what was likely the deep
est. most talented team in the tourna
ment. A No. 1 seed in the West Re
gional sent Stanford to Missoula,
Mont., where senior point guard
Jamila Wideman put on a show.
Wideman garnered Regional
MVP honors as Stanford first ousted
Virginia and then exacted revenge
from the previous year on Georgia
with a crushing 82-47 win to advance
to the Final Four.
Old Dominion was waiting in
Cincinnati, and no one thought the
Card would lose to the Lady Mon
archs twice, especially not with
Kristin Folkl. Stanford jumped out to
a 15-point lead in the first half hut saw
Old Dominion surge hack and go up
late in the game.
Senior guard Charmin Smith iced
two free throws to send the game into
overtime. But none of Stanford's
three shots in the closing 12 seconds
of the extra frame would drop, and
the Card fell 83-82.
The "Maples Massacre" took
place when UCLA came to Maples
to take on the men's basketball team.
The Bruins suffered the worst loss in
their program's history at the hands
of the Card MW-61. Eventual national
champion Arizona also went down in
Maples, this one on a buzzer-heater
from Sauer for the 81 -80 win.
When the tournament began,
Stanford was set up for a subregional
contest with Wake Forest and nation
al player of the year Tim Duncan.
The Card pushed, fouled and leaned
on Duncan for 40 minutes, and when
the game was over Stanford found it
self headed for the program's first
ever Sweet Sixteen appearance.
The sensational Brevm Knight hit
an incredible shot to send Stanford's
Sweet Sixteen debut against Utah
into overtime but couldn't pull out
the win. I tah advanced with an 82-77
victory, but men's hoops had com
pleted a total transformation during
the Brevin Knight years.
With three national titles already
in the bag and women's hoops, men's
and women's swimming and foiling
all capable of w inning national titles,
the record five NCAA titles was in
jeopardy over spring break. But the
Card w as surprisingly zero for spring
break.
Auburn was dominating in the
men's swimming competition, and
the Card settled for second. USC
pulled off the upset win over the
women's team, edging Stanford by
just 11 points. Fencing finished a best
ever third at nationals over spring
break, but even that finish was below
the team's aspirations.
The synchronized swimming team
came closer than any other program
to claiming a national title over spring
break. But in the end Stanford fell 13
hundredths of a point short to Ohio
State.
Meanwhile, men's volleyball was
tearing its wa\ through the competi
tion. Ranked No. I for part of the sea
son. they took out nval UCLA in the
MPSF tournament final to automati
cally advance to the Final Four. Ball
State went down in a quick three
game match in the semifinal to set up
a rematch with the Bruins for the na
tional title.
Stanford looked poised to claim
the program's first national champi
onship by taking the first two games
from the Bruins. But UCLA fought

mates.
back to win games three and four with
relative ease and sent the game into a
rally-scored, determining fifth game.
Stanford went up early, but the
Bruins fought back to take the lead.
With the game tied at 13, UCLA
served into the net to set up champi
onship point. Stanford got a block for
the point and the year's fourth
NCAA title.
Men's and women's tennis did the
rest.
The women were undefeated
through the Pac-10, and then-junior
Julie Scott claimed her second
straight Pac-10 singles title. Florida
was still the favorite when the
NCAAs began, but this time the
Gators would have to come through
the Farm. The Taube Family Tennis
Stadium was the site of the NCAA
championships, and the Cardinal
once again tied its record five NCAA
titles here at home.
Florida fell to Stanford this time in
a rematch of the previous year's na
tional championship match. Fresh
man Lilia Osterloh went on to claim
the NCAA singles title, and all that
was left for Stanford sports fans was
to watch the men's team in Los An
geles.
UCLA was the clear favorite, but
the two-time defending national
champion Cardinal wouldn't be
turned away that easily. Senior Grant
Elliot pulled out the win in a three-set
match to clench the third consecutive
national title for men's tennis and the
sixth of the year for Stanford sports.
But the year was far from over.
Women's golf placed second at Pac
10s and had an outside shot at the na
tional title, finishing fourth at
NCAAs. Track won Big Meet, and
for the men it was the first time in 25
years. But if any team had a shot at
giving Stanford its seventh national
title, it was baseball.
Stanford once again got the pre
season No 1. ranking. The Card went
on to sweep USC for the first time in
six years, but didn't clinch the Six-Pac

title until the final game of its season
ending series against UCLA. Peter
son broke Jack McDowell's strikeout
record and as a team, the Card set a
new record for homeruns in a season.
The Card got to host a regional in
the NCAA tournament. This year,
the Card swept through the West Re
gional on its way to Omaha, Neb., for
the World Series. There Stanford
took care of Auburn but lost to
Louisiana State. The Card won one
more over Auburn to stave off elimi
nation, but Louisiana State was too
much. The Tigers beat the Card again
en route to their second-straight
NCAA title.
1997-98
With the kickoff of the 1997 foot
ball season, predictions of a "rosy fu
ture" had students making plans for
New Year's in Pasadena. The Cardi
nal even jumped out strong with a 3-1
record heading into a matchup with
then-unranked Notre Dame.
The Card's only loss was a re
spectable 28-17 loss to then-No. 6
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Mean
while, the Fighting Irish entered the
contest on a three-game losing streak.
Stanford won the contest 33-15 in
front of more than 75,000 fans at
Stanford Stadium.
That was the high point. From that
point on, it just got worse. Five
straight losses to Pac-10 opponents
gave Stanford a 4-6 record heading
into the 100 th Big Game.
With no shot at a bowl game on
the line for either squad, Stanford's
one-point win in the contest didn't
mean a whole lot. The finish was ex
citing, and postgame jeers to the Cal
student section prompted Bears fans
to tear down the goal posts. We may
have won the game, but their fans
made our students look like the Wee
nies.
Meanwhile the men's and
women's cross country teams were
doing their best to make a repeat run
at the national title. Both squads won
the Pac-10 titles for a second year in a
row, but entering NCAAs, the
women were expected to win rather
than the men.

While the women's team were the
top-ranked team in the nation, the
men were second to Arkansas, and a
loss to the Razorbacks would not
have been considered a great upset.
However, the men would not be
turned away and garnered a second
consecutive NCAA title with a 53-56
win over Arkansas.
The women were not as fortunate,
and the Card just missed a double re
peat. Brigham Young edged Stanford
by a score of 100-102 in a race that in
cluded two very close finishes.
Brigham Young placed its second
runner 13th, just ahead of Stanford's
Sally Glynn and Mary Cobb. Fresh
man Ann Ramsey was the other key
factor, placing 51st with an identical
time to the three runners who placed
ahead of her — all by just fractions of
a second. Either point swing could
have garnered the double repeat
Stanford was hoping for.
The men's and women's soccer
teams seemingly had a reversal of for
tunes last fall. The women's team got
off to an uncharacteristically poor
start, losing four straight early in the
season and dropping its first two Pac
-10 games to drop to 4-7.
But Stanford turned things
around and finished the year without
another loss. That wasn't enough for
the NCAA selection committee,
however, and conference champ
UCLA was the Pac-10's lone repre
sentative in the tournament.
The men's team had a banner
year. The wins kept piling up, and the
squad continually climbed up the
rankings. The Card claimed its first
division title and reached the No. 2
ranking. Stanford than faced off
against top-ranked Indiana. But
that's where things started heading
south.
The Card's 2-1 loss to Indiana
would not have been detrimental
alone, but the five-game skid it
sparked brought a quick end to Stan
ford's season. After losses to San
Francisco and Santa Clara, the Card
faced off against UCLA for the
MPSF title and lost 1-0. Stanford still
got a bid to the NCAA tourney but
fell in a tough overtime battle to

Washington 2-1.
Field hockey also put up the best
numbers in the program's history.
The squad was ranked in the top 20,
and a successful road trip to the East
was promising early on. Stanford
even cruised to a second straight Nor-
Pac title and a 16-6 record (the most
wins in school history), but the per
formance was not enough for the
team to receive an at-large bid into
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Water polo was surprisingly over
looked by the NCAA selection com
mittee for the second year in a row.
Again the Cardinal was ranked
among the nation's top three or four
all year long, only to get snubbed by
the selection committee after not
winning the MFSF tournament.
Again Stanford placed second in the
conference tourney, and again the
second MFSF bid to the NCAA tour
nament went to another team, leav
ing the No. 3 squad in the nation out
of the national tournament.
The women's volleyball team
started its quest for history on shaky
ground. Two of the Card's three re
turning Ail-Americans were side
lined with injuries, and Stanford's 50-
match home win streak came to a halt
when Penn State came to town.
But Stanford began its romp
through the Pac-10, and slowly the
team began to improve. Kristin Folkl
was having a career-year even by her
standards and walked away with Pac
-10 Player of the Year honors as Stan
ford won yet another conference title.
When the tournament started,
Penn State was the overwhelming fa
vorite. But the Nittany Lions didn't
have the kind of experience the Card
carried in its five seniors, and Stan
ford's quest for a historic fourth
NCAA title and a third for the seniors
was inevitable.
Stanford went through UC-Santa
Barbara and Long Beach State, who
boasted National Player of the Year
Misty May, en route to a national
championship rematch with the Nit
tany Lions. The match lived up to its
billing in the form of a five-game bat
tle that the Card pulled out on a Folkl
kill.

Hut while Folkl was earning the
third national title and fourth All-
America honors of her career in vol
leyball. the women's basketball team
was beginning what most people con
sidered a rebuilding year. Inexperi
ence at the guaru position showed it
self early, and the ( ard quickly fell to
a 2-4 record over winter break.
But Folkl came back, the guards
matured, and things began to click.
Stanford went on to win 19 of its last
20 games of the regular season to
claim its ninth Pac-l()title in lOyears.
Hut disaster struck a week prior to the
tournament.
First senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard blew out her knee in the season
finale against Oregon State. Just
three days later Folkl suffered the
same fate on the first play of practice,
and the Card found itself without two
of its top three scorers and rebound
ers for the tournament.
But Stanford still had the No. 1
seed and homecourt advantage for
the first two rounds. That, however,
was not enough as 16th-seeded Har
vard pulled off the biggest upset in
tournament history and became the
first team to defeat Stanford at
Maples in four years.
Meanwhile, men's hoops got its
first year in the post-Brevin era under
way by embarking on the best start in
the school's history. An 18-0 record
and a No. 4 ranking were on the line
when defending national champ Ari
zona came to town. But this year the
Card wasn't ready, and the Wildcats
dismantled Stanford.
The Card went on to drop three of
its next four games but rebounded in
time for the tournament, set to top
last season's Sweet Sixteen run this
year.
Stanford's exciting two-point win
over Rhode Island propelled the
Card into the Final Four for the first
time in 56 years, and moved point
guard Arthur Lee past the questions
of living up to predecessor Brevin
Knight. Stanford gave a valiant effort
against Kentucky in the national
semifinal but fell 86-85 in overtime to
the eventual national champion.
Not to be outdone over spring

break, the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams pulled < >ff a na
tional championship sweep to give
Stanford its third and fourth N( A A
titles.
For the women's team, a national
championship meant the return of
the NCAA title to its proper home
after a one-year hiatus. NC A A swim
mer of the year Misty I Ivman, a fresh
man, used five record-setting perfor
mances to help guide the ( ard to a
422-378 win over second-place Ari
zona.
If the men wanted to complete the
sweep and regain the national cham
pionship for the first time since 1994.
they had to dethrone defending na
tional champ Auburn in the ligers'
own pool.
It was expected to be a close meet,
but all 16 Stanford swimmers scored
points for the Card en route to the
second-highest point total in NCAA
history. Stanford ran away with the
crown and left Auburn at a distant
second.
The synchronized swimming team
also garnered a national champi
onship over spring break, although
not an NCAA title. Synchro is not an
NCAA sanctioned sport, but that
didn't stop the Card from claiming its
first national title over the 13-time de
fending champion Ohio State.
As spring got under way. the base
ball team was still sitting on top of the
polls. The preseason No. 1. Stanford
dominated the competition all the
way through the season, winning
every series. But somehow it all went
wrong.
The Card dropped its final series
of the year to USC at home, then
went on the road to lose the Pac-10
crown to Washington. Stanford
dropped from the top spot the last
week of the regular season but still
got a top seed and were set to host the
West Regional.
Loyola Marymount was the first
round oppc>nent. and the ( ardinalof
fense was anemic. Stanford dropped
the game 6-2. Ihe Card seemingly
bounced back bv trouncing Minneso
ta 1 9-1 the next day. but Long Beach
State spelled the end of Stanford's
season. The 49ers pulled off the upset
victory that ended the Card's season
en route to a College World Series
appearance of their own.
In a small consolation prize,
Stanford hurler Jeff Austin was
named National Player of the Year
and was picked fourth overall in the
draft as eight Stanford players were
drafted.
While baseball was disappointed
with its regional showing, the Stan
ford softball team was making the
first regional appearance in the histo
ry of the program. By far the most
successful year of the softball pro
gram, the Cardinal broke into the na

tional rankings for the first time and
climbed as high as No. 9.
A third-place finish in the perenni
ally tough Pac-10 and sweeps over
UCLA, Washington and other tough
schools garnered Stanford a No. 1
seed in the No. 8 Regional.
The Card traveled Stillwater,
Okla., and prepared itself for the pro
gram's first postseason. A loss to
Southwest Missouri State in its first
game relegated the Card to the
loser's bracket where it fought
through to the regional champi
onship game.
Unfortunately, host Oklahoma
State — an eventual semifinalist at
the Softball College World Series —
was too much in the regional champi
onship. and the Card's season ended
two victories short of the World Se
ries.
The tennis teams were dominant

as always this spring. Head coach
Dick Gould described his men's
squad as the best team he had ever
coached — high praise from a man
with 16 national championships. But
the Card lived up to its coach's asser
tion.
Stanford cruised through the sea
son with a perfect record and were
more frustrated over things like los
ing the doubles point than any com
petitor it faced.
Athens, Ga., was the site of the
NCAA Championships, and Stan
ford stormed all the way through the
tournament, without dropping a
match, to give seniors Paul Goldstein
and Charles Hoeveler the fourth na
tional title of their careers.
Sophomore Mike Bryan pulled
off the triple crown of men's colle
giate tennis, winning the singles
crown and the doubles title with part

ner Bob Bryan to go along with Stan
ford's team title.
The women were once again sec
ond in the nation behind Florida and
even beat the Gators to claim the
NCAA Indoor title. Stanford domi
nated in the conference, claiming yet
another Pac-10 title, and senior Julie
Scott claimed her third consecutive
Pac-10 singles crown.
But Stanford's quest for a repeat
national title was ended by No. 3
Duke in the national semifinal. Scott
and fellow senior Ania Bleszvnski
were highly successful in the individ
ual draws. Scott was upended in the
semifinal, just missing an all-Stanford
final as Bleszynski advanced all the
way to the championship game be
fore falling in straight sets.
With baseball done early, most
sports fans had completed the
NCAA title count at five, but the

men's track and field team almost
had something to say about that. The
men's team was leading the meet
heading into the final race, hut
Arkansas made a great comeback to
overtake the Card and win the title by
71/2 points.
The women placed ninth in the
meet, marking the first time ever that
both the men's and women's teams
finished in the top 10. Senior Monal
Chockshi captured the NCAA title in
the 3,(XX) meters for the women,
while the men garnered two individ
ual titles — Toby Stevenson in the
pole vault and Brad Hauser in the
H).(XK) meters.
One last look buck
When you win the Sear's Cup every
year, there's a lot to talk about. With
so much success and triumph over the
last four vears, it's amazing that anv

athlete or team can stand out for
more than just a few minutes.
From men's tennis' four NCAA
titles to all the club teams. Stanford is
the most dominant sports machine
ever created. I've read comparisons
of the Farm to ancient Greece, and
even though I laugh, there's some
truth to it.
Over the past four years, r.o schtxil
has come close to matching Stan
ford's excellence on the playing
fields. When teams finish second or
drop out in the national semifinal and
we express our disappointment with
their finish, something's wrong.
But then again, sports have been
s<.) good for so long here, and that's
what we expect. And looking back at
the accomplishments of the last four
years in Stanford sports. I would have
to say the athletes here definitely did
not disappoint.
