# Draft rides Big Game heroics and solid year into NFL
## Once a man without a position, senior linebacker anchored Cardinal defense 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
If you've seen the way senior ('hris
Draft plays inside linebacker, you
probably think he's played there his
whole life.
Draft has recorded more tackles
than any other Cardinal player over

the past two seasons. He earned sec
ond-team All-Pacific 10 Conference
honors last year and entered the sea
son regarded as one of the top inside
linebackers in the nation.
Hut there was a time when Draft
did not fit into Stanford's defense as
neatly he does now.
As a running back at Valencia

High School in Anaheim, Calif.,
Draft rushed for 1,367 yards and
scored Itouchdowns his senior year.
On defense, he racked up 65 tackles
and 10 sacks while being named a
consensus high school All-American
and California Interscholastic Feder
ation Player of the Year.
"Every major school was after

him, but I thought that getting the ed
ucation that Stanford kids get would
be so valuable," said Valencia High
School coach Mike Marrujo. "I
thought that it would be best for
him."
Growing up in Southern Califor
nia, Draft hadn't heard much about
Stanford. It wasn't until the Cardinal
started recruiting him that Marrujo
told Draft about another Valencia
running back who had decided to
play football on the Farm — Darrin
Nelson.
Nelson went on to gain over 4,000
yards for the Cardinal from 1977-81
and still ranks as Stanford's all-time
leading rusher.
"Physically, they were different.
Darrin was a small, quick guy," Mar
rujo said. "But their work ethic and
their desire were similar. Both were
also so much better than anyone else
on their team that it wasn't even
funny."
Draft also had high hopes for his
collegiate career. Recruited as as an
offensive player, he was in for a sur
prise when he arrived at Stanford in
the fall of 1994.
"I was told all through the recruit
ing process that I was going to play
fullback," Draft said. "Just about the
first day I was here, [the coaches] said,
'We need a little bit more help on de
fense.' They switched me to strong
safety."
From there Draft went on a
strange and difficult journey through
the entire defense.
After starting one game at strong

safety, Draft was moved to outside
linebacker. Later in the season, he
found himself at defensive end, while
also sporadically playing inside line
backer. Very few players ever move
from the secondary to the defensive
line, much less during their freshman
year.
"I wasn't disappointed moving
[positions]," Draft said. "I was just
disappointed by the fact that I moved
so much. I was never able to get a
total grasp of a particular position."
To make matters more difficult,
the coaches were not just tinkering
with Draft, but they were making ad
justments to the entire defense.
"It was very frustrating. It was five
positions in name, but at that time we
were changing up the defensive
schemes almost every week, so it was
more like eight positions," Draft said.
The following year, Draft found
himself penciled in at outside line
backer. But in the Cardinal's second
game against pass-happy Utah, Stan
ford decided to add a defensive back,
so Draft moved to inside linebacker.
Utah ended up trying ta run for much
of the game, and Draft made his
mark, totaling 11 tackles and block
ing a punt.
From that game on. Draft made
inside linebacker his home. He fin
ished the year with 103 tackles and
was voted Most Outstanding Sopho
more by his teammates. In last sea
son's Sun Bowl, Draft forced a fum
ble late in the game that preserved
Stanford's 38-0 shutout over Michi
gan State.

Despite suffering a hamstring in
jury earlier this season. Draft has
continued to help a talented defense
stifle opposing rushers while also
guiding the unit through its rough
times.
"He's a guy that's a big leader for
us. He's our play-caller and makes
our adjustments," said senior Kailee
Wong. "Not only that, he makes big
plays."
The frustrations he went through
playing positions all over the field
may have actually given Draft an im
proved perspective on the game. As
the signal-caller for the defense,
Draft not only sees what his team
mates are supposed to do, but he has
also been in their shoes.
"I always felt like the strength of
my game was being able to under
stand my position totally and under
stand the other positions on the field,
to have a clear picture of what's going
on," Draft said.
Although it took time for Draft
to find his niche in Stanford's de
fense, his intense work ethic has re
mained with him. Wherever he's
played, he has carried with him a
mentality that may be the secret to
his success.
"I just want to get better," Draft
said. "I feel like if I'm ever sitting
around, like right now. someone's
getting better than me — putting
extra time in watching film, in the
weight room, or studying more than
me.
"Once you stop striving to get bet
ter, you're going to get worse."

Chris Draft recorded more tackles than any other Cardinal player over the past two seasons — quite a
feat for someone who was converted to defense only after gaining Ail-American honors as a running
back in high school.
