# Trials and tribulations of a Stanford sports junkie
## Robin recounts her top 10 Cardinal sports memories of the past four years 
### 
For the past four years I've lived the
life of a total sports junkie. I skipped
classes to watch games, set my alarm
for early-morning contests during March
Madness and spent way too many hours
watching my favorite Stanford sports
teams.
I've had roommates and friends who
were Stanford athletes, and my work with
The Daily has sent me traveling all over the
country to cover national championships
and postseasons.
When The Daily wouldn't send me. I've
occasionally packed up the car and driven
down to Los Angeles or up to Tennessee
from my home in Georgia just to catch a
game. Basically, I've seen a lot of Stanford
sports in my four years.
So I decided to come up with my own lit
tle top 10. I picked out the 10 most exciting
Stanford sporting events that I had seen
here and reveled in the memories as I
looked over the list.
Then I was struck by the fact that my top
10 was composed of just a few sports and
most were from the last two years. I credit
ed the latter with my faltering memory of
those first two years and with the first, 1 de
termined that I hadn't seen as many (and
sadly in some cases hadn't seen any) games
of other sports.
But something else also came to mind.
To fully enjoy the excitement and under
stand just how big a game or match is, you
have to know the drama behind the game.
Without the sense of history, without
knowing what has transpired to bring teams
and individuals into a game, you don't get
the same experience. Sure, you can walk
away from a game and say how great and
exciting you thought it was, but if you don't
have a sense of how important it is to the
people who played it.it won't stick with you
for the rest of your life.
So first let me apologize to all the sports
whose great moments I have likely missed.
If it weren't for the actual academic part of
college, perhaps I could've seen more
sporting events in my time here, or maybe I
should have tried to design my own major
in spectatorship.
Either way, I'll continue on with the list

of memorable moments I've racked up in
my four years here.
10. My firs! volleyball match: I don't even
remember who Stanford was playing or
what the final score was. I had never even
been to a volleyball match before and only
went to this one because two people from
my freshman dorm were on the team.
I figured that if they were freshmen they
might not play that much. But it was Orien
tation week, and 1 didn't have anything bet
ter to do. Turns out Kristin Folkl and Lisa
Sharpley were pretty good volleyball play
ers, and Stanford had a pretty good team. I
was hooked and rarely missed a home con
test over the next four years.
9. Men's basketball beats UCLA 67-66: I
didn't pick UCLA to win the national
championship in my freshman year pool. I
lost. But the Bruins didn't, and the follow
ing season we all wanted to beat them when
they came to Maples.
Although not a member, I had maneu
vered my way into the Sixth Man Club sec
tion and was standing at center court. The
Bruins cut a seven-point lead to just one
over the final two minutes, but with the shot
clock winding down Brevin Knight had the
ball and fired a shot with about 15 seconds
left in ine game.
The rebound was long, and Brevin
tracked it down and called the quick time
out with 12 seconds on the clock. For some
reason UCLA didn't foul on the inbounds,
and Brevin dribbled the clock out for the
67-66 win.
1 hadn't planned on charging the court,
but the surge of human bodies rushing me
forward let me know I had to keep my feet
moving. The entire student section poured
out onto the court, proudly slapping Stan
ford players on the back and dancing with
the Tree. It was dubbed the "Miracle at
Maples," and the following year the UCLA
matchup was properly labeled the "Mas
sacre at Maples," as the Card hasn't lost to
the Bruins at home since.
8. Women's basketball tourney run in 1997:
Covering the women's basketball team for
The Daily, I had the opportunity to experi
ence this one firsthand. Winter quarter fi
nals took a back seat to first and second

round games at Maples Pavilion, and easy
wins over Howard and Texas lech sent me
to Missoula, Mont., for the West Regional.
Senior Jamila Wideman was dominating
against Virginia, and fellow Daily staffer
Ed Guzman had to pull me back into my
chair when she swatted the shot of Virginia
All-American Tora Suber for the first block
of her illustrious Stanford career. Wideman
went on the claim West Regional MVP
honors, and a Cardinal win over Virginia
set up a Stanford-Georgia regional final.

A Georgia native and lifelong Bulldog
fan, I could barely control my nerves. I put
a death grip on the table in front of me and
proceeded to play every play for all 10 play
ers and coach both teams.
1 was exhausted at the half, and Ed com
mented that I was missing a good game. At
some point in the second half, 1 looked up at
the clock and was surprised to see that we
were up 30. From that point on I relaxed
and enjoyed the fact that 1 was headed to
the Final Four in Cincinnati.
A rematch with Old Dominion was on
the table for the national semifinal, and I
was confident. We jumped out to a lead,
and my former roommate was unstoppable.
After Folkl went up to catch a long pass
from Wideman and quickly touched it over
to Olympia Scott for the lavup. 1 suddenly
forgot 1 was in press row. Ed reminded me
where we were, and I toned it down for the
rest of the game.
I could barely watch as Charmin Smith
iced two free throws to send the game into
overtime, and the last 12 seconds of the con
test were agonizing as we got off three shots
but couldn't get the winning basket.
The best team in the country didn't win
the national title, but 1 couldn't help but be

proud of the way the players handled them
selves. After watching players from all the
teams we had beaten in press conferences
throughout the tournament, I was amazed
by how courteous and gracious the Stan
ford players were. I've never been more
proud to be represented by a group of peo
ple, and I've never been around a tourna
ment that was incredibly exciting yet com
pletely heartbreaking all at once.
7. Women's soccer Calls to Santa Clara in
the playoffs: For women's soccer no rival
comes as big as Santa Clara. My sophomore
year the Broncos ended Stanford's season
in the first round of the tournament so it
was a chance for payback when the two
teams met in the first round again last year.
I ventured to the game even though it
was cold, windy and raining. At the half we
were trailing 3-0, and I'm not ashamed to
admit that the thought of going home
crossed my mind more than once.
Instead I sucked it up and settled in for
one of the most exciting halves of soccer
I've ever seen. Senior Stacy Cook played in
spirationally, as she put in a rebounded shot
from Rita Hermiz for Stanford's first goal
early in the half.
A few minutes later Cook struck again,
this time giving the ball up to Emily Burt for
the Card's second goal, and with under 30
minutes of play remaining Stanford looked
poised to take over the game.
But Santa Clara shut down the Cardinal
offense, and Stanford only got one more
scoring opportunity when Hermiz booted
one toward the upper right side of the goal.
The shot sailed just over the goal and took
with it Stanford's comeback hopes.
6. Women's volleyball national champi
onship versus Hawaii: I won't lie and say I
knew they had it all along. I was nervous for
Stanford entering the NCAA tournament
last year. This team had lost to Pacific and
Washington State earlier in the season, and
even though I don't expect them to be per
fect all the time, I thought that this year they
certainly hadn't looked invincible.
Maybe I was still reeling from the Final
Four loss from a year before, or maybe it
was the way everyone talked about Hawaii
as the best team around. Forget about the

fact that Stanford had beaten the Rainbows
in Hawaii that year, this team was good.
Hut it didn't take the Card long to silence
any critics and put my fears to rest. I
couldn't see the game live so I popped in a
brand new tape and set my VCR to record
for several hours so that I was certain to get
the entire match.
Turns out, 1 really didn't need much
more than an hour of tape. Stanford made
quick work of the Rainbows, winning 15-7,
15-3, 15-5 in the most lopsided national
championship match ever. Kerri Walsh was
the National Freshman of the Year, and my
tape even got all the post-game interviews,
including my former roommate Folkl, who
was one of Stanford's four All-Americans
that year.
"Yep," I thought to myself, "those two
players from my freshman dorm are pretty
good."
5. Football beats UCLA with fourth-quar
ter drive: This was one of those occasions
where we all piled into the car and drove
down to L os Angeles, for last year's game
against UCLA. We walked to the Rose
Bowl from my friend Anthony's house, and
our seats were right in the middle of the
UCLA student section.
Somehow we all got separated at half
time. and late in the game I found myself
sitting alone in our original seats. 1 was po
sitioned off the corner of the end zone more
than 1(K) yards away from where Brian
Manning would eventually haul in the win
ning touchdown pass, and as quarterback
Chad Hutchinson started the drive deep in
Stanford territory 1 quietly listened to all
the talk about another UCLA victory.
Slowly we began to march down the
field. The crowd comments were still confi
dent. We wouldn't score: they'd still win. At
this point 1 had not made it clear that I was
a Stanford student, so I wasn't taking any
direct abuse. Hutch and the offensive line
marched down the field, with Hutch passing
to just about every receiver on the roster.
We were all on our feet when Manning
caught the pass along the back of the end
zone to tie the eame. Among the grumbles
