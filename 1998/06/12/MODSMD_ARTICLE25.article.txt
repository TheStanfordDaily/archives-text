# Looking forward to the best times
## 
### 
It was a scorching afternoon filled
with unmemorable speeches,
bleachers full of faces, green
grass, thin gowns and nervous
glances. For months prior, people
asked the typical questions: "What
are you doing next year?" "How
does it feel to be graduating?" "Are
you excited?"
The preceding days were filled
with partying, goodbyes, tears and
expectation. People went their dif
ferent ways, took pictures, said their
goodbyes and promised to write.
"Oh The Places You'll Go," by Dr.
Seuss was mentioned a million times,
and people told you that those years
would be the best times of your life.
That was four years ago, and
again our lives have come full circle.
The bewilderment of learning the
ropes again, making new friends and
surviving on institutional food gave
way to overslept classes, all-nighters
and leeching off friends on the Row.
Through the years, memories
were etched in our minds. 1 remem
ber the late nights. Not the late nights
that 1 spent studying, though those

certainly took their toll, hut the
nights that I spent working on the
next day's newspaper and the nights
that 1 saw the sunrise after a night of
laughing, gossiping, movies and
music with friends in the dorm.

People told me that "College
would be a great, new experience."
Though the grades were no longer as
easy to come by, the opportunities
expanded by leaps and bounds.
There is something to be said about
being taught by Nobel laureates in a
class with Olympic athletes, famous
performers and the progeny of world
leaders, but the opportunity to meet
people from every walk of life with a
plethora of experiences affected me

the most.
I met people that had every luxu
ry and opportunity in the world
handed to them, and I met people
that have had to struggle much more
than I ever had to. I talked to men
tally unbalanced men at the CoHo,
interviewed future professional
bailers, shared sink space, and ate
meals with biological researchers.
I just had a great time with good
people — people whose most win
ning characteristic wasn't the num
ber of research articles they've pub
lished but their cool laugh and crude
jokes. Because ultimately we make
friends with those that keep us
laughing, make us think and aren't
embarrassing to be seen with.
Yes, I will fondly remember the
Quad, the dorms and houses that
I've lived in, and Daily sports, but
those will always be there. What
changes are the people. Those peo
ple I care most about I will take with
me.
In a few days, the graduation
scene will play again. The speakers
will be more important, the bleach

ers will he more abundant, and the
gowns better accessorized. The usual
questions will be interspersed with
" How does it feel to be going into the
real world?"
All of these questions have no
real answer. Half the time, people
don't know what they are doing next
year, have no idea what this mythical
"real world" is and feel mixed about
graduating. I think the best senior
conversation filler is simply, "Con
gratulations on graduating."
People say now that the college
years are "the best times of your
life." New places, new people. Ad
just. grow, learn. It happens over and
over again. And I expect it to happen
for the rest of my life. There will be
highs and lows. I'll go new places,
meet new people. Who knows? I
may even graduate again.
And I expect to have many, many
more best times of my life before it's
all said and done. We all will.
