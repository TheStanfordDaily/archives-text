## Remembering to sing and dance a little 
### 
I wrote my Stanford application essay
about my friend Jim, who one day in
high school reminded me not to forget
that people are responsible for their own joy
in life.
The note stemmed from a discussion
we d had at the office. He was the photog
rapher for my small-town newspaper, 1 the
intern; both of us tended to work late at
night, when confidences are more easily
shared.
One night when 1 felt close to a nervous
breakdown, 1 (as I was prone to do at times
of extreme stress) recited my never-ending
list of responsibilities and deadlines to Jim.
He offered a few words of comfort, finished
up his work and left.
Two hours later, I stepped out into a bril
liant New Mexico thunderstorm and found
a piece of paper slipped under the wind
shield wiper of my car. Curious. I unfolded
the slightly soggy page torn from a re
porter's notebook and squinted to read the
bleeding ink. "Alwavs remember," it in

structed me, "to sing and dance a little bit
every day."
I started to waltz right then and there.
And my problems, like the ink on the
paper, melted away.
Since then, that's become somewhat of
my personal motto. I've had more than one
night during my four years at Stanford
when 1 developed that dreadful sinking
feeling in my stomach, like I was just keep
ing my head above water in the rapids of
trying to juggle my load.
But I've learned something in those four
years, too: that it doesn't have to be that
way. I don't have to impress my parents or
the next "Stanford" on my list, be it gradu
ate school or an employer. I don't even
have to impress myself.
Because although we've all worked hard
at Stanford, pulled all-nighters and filled
our minds with technical terms and formu
las. that's not what we'll remember.
To me, Stanford will be about one week
end at Lassen National Park, another at Sea

Ranch and one midnight hike sans flash
lights at Jasper Ridge. Fourth of July fire
works in the City and Draw group beach
trips on too-cold days. Comet sightings and
wishes placed on falling stars.
It will be about late-night trips to the
Oasis and Denny's. "Pop-Up Video,"
"Hercules" and "South Park." "Summer
Lovin' " and"I Will Survive," the Counting
Crows and the Beatles. The opera, the bal
let and "Beach Blanket Babylon."
It will be about learning that I love learn
ing, just not the tests. That I'll spend the rest
of my life studying history on my own terms
but that I'm not cut out for a Ph.D. That the
depth my schoolwork has provided me with
has given me the invaluable skills to analyze
the news I cover as a journalist and to un
derstand my personal life.
It will be about crushes of the week and
some that lasted a little longer. Finding
something that may have been love. Realiz
ing that flirtation can be more fun than re
lationships and making the most of that.

It will be about learning that what makes
me happiest is teaching other people to sing
and dance. Watching the excitement of
someone who has caught the journalism
bug. Hoping I've allowed someone to make
a better decision or understand a situation
more thoroughly through my work.
It will be about discovering who I am and
finding contentment with that. Being se
cure in the knowledge of how essential my
heritage is to my self. Knowing I'll never try
to hide any part of who I am to impress
someone.
It will be about breaking stereotypes
that I never knew 1 had. Realizing fraterni
ty membership doesn't necessarily corre
late to a person's intelligence. Discovering
that not everyone from the East Coast is
competitive and loud and not everyone
from the West Coast is laid-back and fond
of the term "dude."
It will be about breaking stereotypes 1
had of myself. Finding people who help me
relax and laugh at the world. Uncovering

the key to what's important and what's not.
Learning how to sing and dance a little hit
every day out of joy and not desperation.
A kind word, an argument, a philosoph
ical debate. A smile, a wink, a gaze. An un
derstanding.
Stanford, as we hopefully have figured
out by now, is all about higher education —
so long as you understand the term in a
broader sense. Our four years here, no mat
ter how sheltered, have prepared us for
going out into the great, wide world to seek
our fortunes and so much more.
It's comforting to know that now, having
loved, learned and lived. I'm ready to move
on.
Look for me — I'll be the one singing
and dancing a little bit every day.
