## Humbly facing a world full of surprise 
### 
I'm dreaming, and there's a wolf after
me. My friends and I are huddled in this
dark little room, and I'm crouching next
to a window with a gun in my hand. Some
thing big and hairy slinks before the win
dow. I stare straight ahead, and wait. Si
lence. The wolf pokes a hole in the window
and grins in at me. The idiot, he doesn't even
know I've got a gun. Then I grin and slowly
lift the gun up to the hole. Wie geht's, fool?
1 pull the trigger. But there's no shattering
boom.
And then I realize — it's a toy gun.
<I>Shoot.<l>
I woke up from the dream in a cold sweat,
relieved that I was snug in my bed and not
crouched next to a window with a hole in it,
having just gleefully popped a toy gun in a
salivating wolf's face.
I didn't like the dream. It left a bad after
taste with me, and a good day passed before
I could laugh about it. Not just because it
had interrupted my REM-eycle and wors
ened my sleep debt two nights before a
paper was due, but because in that dream I
was a grinning fool, certain that I knew what

I was doing when in fact I had no idea what
I had in my hand.
It's not a pleasant feeling to be proven
wrong. But it's in those humiliating mo
ments, when we are humbled by our igno
rance, that we often learn the most.
I had never known that palm trees were
so expensive. That I could gain weight on
bagels. That coffee at 2 a.m. would make me
drowsy. That Abe Lincoln never led a moral
crusade against slavery. That "Western
CIV" was only an American cultural con
struct, created during world war to champi
on the cause of the West against the forces
of barbarism. That the reason only images
of bloodless victory in Operation Desert
Storm appeared on the evening news was
because America still remembered: "No
more Vietnams."
1 had never thought much of social hier
archies, of inescapable poverty, of the fami
ly living out of a rickety car because there
was no place to call home. I simply felt sorry,
sometimes repelled, and moved along. I
never questioned my generous patronage of
Guess, Nike, and other brand names that

abuse human workers. I never wondered
why socialism had not swept the United
States as it had other nations. I never under
stood the significance of the debate over af
firmative action, and what it said about the
nature of "America."
Fresh out of my high school success and
heading toward a university education. I
thought I had it made, and that the next four
years would just be the yellow brick road to
ward my college degree and subsequent suc
cess.
Of course, the sun would not shine 24
hours a day, nor would life be a basket of
strawberries. But my paved road lay ahead
of me, and I was headed for the Emerald
City.
I never knew that in four short years. I
would see so much more than that yellow
brick road.
It wasn't the sleepless nights of typing
papers or the anxiety of exams that troubled
me, although those did certainly take their
toll on my digestion. What shook me was the
growing realization of my ignorance. Not
just an ignorance in equations memorized.

theories understood and events interpreted,
but an ignorance that had conveniently shut
out the realities of this dismal world and rev
eled in the sunny country clubs I lived in. It
was a realization that my life had long been
running on tunnel vision.
I've learned a lot. Not to say that I now
understand this world and where I fit into it
— I don't expect to get there for a long time
yet. But I do know that I won't be in some
fragrant lily patch on the island of Lilliput.
That my yellow brick road is much wider
and will sometimes be much dirtier and
steeper than I had expected. And that I
didn't spend a fortune buying books and an
other heap of hours reading (well, skim
ming) them, just to get a fancy piece of
paper with my name on it. I entered the
Farm with my major, expected degrees, ca
reer and aspirations mapped out. I leave
with a different major, different degrees,
hopes in a career I had once loathed and an
entirely changed view of the world.
So I've learned that my toy gun wasn't
what I thought it was.and I was a fool to
have thought I knew. But I'm not embar

rassed. I'm grateful, not only to have been
places I never expected to be. but to have
gained so much after having my pride bro
ken, and to have shared a thrilling four years
with people who have inspired me in im
measurable ways.
I guess many would expect a graduating
senior to leave with thoughts of achieve
ment. But college has not made me more
proud, thank goodness. No. it has humbled
me, because I've realized how often I am
shamefully wrong, and how much further 1
have to go.
I'm humbled but I'm not ashamed. Be
cause although I now realize how much 1
have yet to travel. I know I've come a long
way. And 1 can grin all 1 want, not because
I'm certain of the future but because I've
learned from my past.
And there's no wolf after me — only a
world full of surprise.
