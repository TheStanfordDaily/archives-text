## Savoring the privileges of leaving happy 
### 
A caveat for the newly arrived fresh
man dropping off his hags at his col
lege dorm — a column titled "Psy
chic Friend Visits Sam on First Day of
School." The writer explains, "All right,
you'll spend four years here. You won't
come out any smarter, prettier or funnier. In
fact, you'll seem almost the same, but with a
different haircut, an ability to refer to
Austen and not mean the Olsen twins, and
the sense of humor of a kangaroo crossbred
with a suicidal novelist.
"Things will not be as you expect them.
"After you graduate, you won't have a
job. In fact, the very thing that carried you
through high school —journalism — you'll
eventually drop and replace with something
else. The closest you'll come to mass media

will be a really overweight weatherman.
"During your four years here, you will not
have a love life. But you will declare an Eng
lish major your freshman year and eventual
ly write 7K-plus essays, including an KO-page
senior thesis. You will have two very time
consuming jobs, as a Daily section editor
your junior year, and as an RA your senior
year. You will spend many a Sunday after
noon falling asleep over a book.
"You will get nothing you came here ex
pecting to get. No high-paying job, no love of
your life, no dazzling new set of white teeth.
And yet. and yet! And yet you will get every
thing you could possibly need from a college
education, plus some, and above all. you will
be happy, very very happv."
I'd have packed my bags right then and

turned back around, heading home to the
local JC or taking correspondence courses.
But thank God 1 didn't. In retrospect. I real
ize Stanford begrudged me things I didn't re
ally need but instead gave me what was es
sential for my happiness.
My four years here have given me an en
tire philosophy of life, which for the rest of
my days will guide my life choices, my intel
lectual pursuits and my relationships to peo
ple and the world.
Stanford has given me many a gift dis
guised as something else. Stanford hasn't fed
me a set of facts, but instead taught me how
to learn on my own. It hasn't sold me on a
particular way of life, but encouraged me to
find out what was personally important to
me and what would make me happy. It

hasn't given me a quantifiable set of skills,
but showed me that I could do or be anything
I wanted. Stanford has empowered, ener
gized and excited me.
Stanford is not so much an institution as
an experience. The day-to-day routine of
classes, meetings with people, listening to
speakers, jogging around Lake Lag. watch
ing the sunset at the Dish, reading for sec
tion. talking to dormmates. writing and per
forming. working, goofing off. talking, walk
ing. arguing, agreeing, laughing, wondering,
and not just listening and thinking but feel
ing those sunrays penetrating your body —
Stanford is a country club's version of shock
therapy.
It works on you in a full frontal assault,
but for your own good.

Now that it's over. I feel like I leave Stan
ford very rich — rich in knowledge and rich
in confidence. Stanford has given me a lot
over the past four years and now makes me
feel like 1 need to take that abundance of
gifts and share it with other people.
Whether or not we're happy here, we
need to remember that Stanford is a privi
lege. in terms of time, resources and offer
ings. We're lucky we got to have that privi
lege and now after we graduate, we can go tc
different corners of wherever and share a lit
tle bit of Stanford with other people.
And so. "Graduate Leaves School
Happy." What a shocker.

Samuel Park is graduating with a bachelor 's
degree in English.
