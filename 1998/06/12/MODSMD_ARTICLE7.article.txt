# FOUR YEARS IN THE LIFE OF STANFORD SENIORS

• OCTOBER
Stanford alumni and Silicon Valley pioneers David
Packard and William Hewlett jointly donated $77.4 mil
lion toward the construction of a new science and engi
neering quad. The quad - with a total cost of $110 million
will sit west of the main Quad. Five existing buildings,
including the Physics Tank, were slated for demolition as
part ot the project, while four new buildings are to be
erected. The gift was the single largest donation in the his
tory of Stanford.
Alter a year-long study, the Commission on Under
graduate Education unveiled a 64-page report detailing its

recommendations for the future of Stanford's undergrad
uate program. Changes include the development of a
three-quarter science core and strengthened writing and
foreign language requirements, as well as a call for longer
term looks at such facets of undergraduate life as teaching,
advising, grading and the academic calendar. The Faculty
Senate has spent the year reviewing, debating, and voting
on the report's proposals.
After more than four years of highly publicized investi
gation and debate, the government ended its indirect-cost
dispute with Stanford, dropping all claims that the Univer
sity overbilled it by $ 185 million in research costs over a 12-
year period in exchange for a $ 1.2 million fee. ITie contro
versy made Stanford the focus of much negative press at
tention and led to the 1992 resignation of then-University
President Donald Kennedy. The attention on billing prac
tices at Stanford and other schools also led the government
to create a new system of indirect-cost regulation.
Sophomore Jessica Williams was killed and seven
other students were injured in a car crash in Hayward. The
students' van crashed into a guard rail and overturned
near the San Mateo bridge after they were cut off by an
other car. In memorial services, friends remembered
Williams, a native of Carson, Calif., as similar to the sun
flowers she loved.
Students protested against California Proposition 187
with a walkout of classes and a noontime rally in White
Plaza. The proposition — which passed in the November
election — makes illegal immigrants ineligible for social
services such as public education and health care.
•NOVEMBER
While Republicans swept Congress in many other
areas of the country, the trend was less obvious in the Bay
Area. U.S. Senator (and Stanford alumna) Dianne Fein
stein (D) and U.S. Representative Anno Eshoo (D) both
won re-election. Incumbent Governor Pete Wilson was
re-elected as well, beating Democratic contender Kath
leen Brown, a Stanford alumna.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson and his wife, Assoc.
Dan of Memorial Church Diana Akiyama, announced
their resignations from the University. Jackson left in
March to accept the position of vice president for student
affairs at the University of Southern California, while
Akivama planned to pursue a doctorate and serve as a lec
turer at USC.

•JANUARY
Palo Alto police arrested two men in connection with
the Nov. 13 murder of Stanford graduate student David
Liu at a Palo Alto apartment. At the time of the murder—
which police said was motivated by robbery — the 23-
year-old Liu was on academic leave of absence while com
pleting the work requirement for a master's degree in
product design.
•FEBRUARY
In response to the Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation's report. Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven announced that departments in his school will be
required to come up with minor programs before the
1996-97 academic year. Though still under discussion, mi
nors would probably require students to complete 25 to 30
units of work, Shoven said. Faculty Senate members were
by and large enthusiastic about the idea.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, an internationally renowned
scholar responsible for obtaining most of Stanford's out
door art collection, died of an apparent heart attack. Elsen
was also a highly regarded teacher whose classes drew
large numbers of students.
The Board of Trustees approved 5.5 percent tuition,
slightly higher than the previous year's 5 percent jump.
The increase — which comes from a 2-percent increase
plus the inflation rate — brings tuition for the 1995-%
school year to $19,695.
Stanford announced plans to create a new interdisci
plinary program in Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity. The program will allow students to choose a major
or minor in Chicano Studies, Asian-American Studies or
African and Afro-American Studies. Much of the work
behind the proposal was done by two committees formed
to examine possible programs in Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies in the wake of the May 1994
hunger strike.
•MARCH
In a precedent-setting decision, Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone struck down Stanford's
speech code. Stone ordered an injunction against the Grey
Interpretation to the Fundamental Standard after nine
Stanford students and alumni brought a suit against the
University in May 1994. The group argued that the code
violated California's Leonard Law, which extends First
Amendment protections to students at private universi

ties.
•APRIL
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office
charged former Bookstore general manager Eldon Speed,
former assistant general manager Philip Chiaramonte and
former controller Patrick McDonald with grand theft and
tax evasion, the first criminal charges to he brought in a
case sparked when a Feb. 5, 1992 story in The Daily re
vealed that senior managers at the Bookstore were re
ceiving perks unheard of at other university bookstores.
Speed and Chiaramonte could both face up to eight years
in prison and McDonald live years for such alleged crimes
as using Bookstore money to purchase a house in 1 wain
Harte, Calif, and to make personal loans.
University President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice announced that Stanford would nei
ther support a University-wide boycott ol grapes nor
allow administrative units — considered to be representa
tives of the University — to boycott. The decision, in re
sponse to a report released by a committee formed after
the May 1994 hunger strike, effectively continued the cur
rent policy but gave more University support to student
education on the issues.
University officials canceled the traditional Com
mencement procession in an effort it) shorten ceremonies
and move the event stage closer to the audience. Using nu
dity and beer to express their displeasure, seniors staged
protests over the demise of the "Wacky Walk" until the
University agreed to let students hold the procession if
they so chose.
•MAY
After failing to get enough pledges to fill 9() percent of
their houses with members, Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta
Pi lost their houses to the Draw. Since the University is re
viewing its policy on (ireek housing, the change could pos
sibly lead to some unhoused fraternities or sororities re
ceiving houses in the future.
•JUNE
Provost Condoleezza Rice outlined $4.6 million in bud
get cuts for the 1995-96 academic year, much of which was
to be achieved through holding allocations to the Univer
sity's academic divisions constant, without increasing for
inflation. Schools will also be charged a "space charge"
based on the square footage they occupy as well as a 6-per
cent levy on expenditures from restricted funds.

required to come up with minor programs before the
1996-97 academic year. Though still under discussion, mi
nors would probably require students to complete 25 to 30
units of work, Shoven said. Faculty Senate members were
by and large enthusiastic about the idea.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, an internationally renowned
scholar responsible for obtaining most of Stanford's out
door art collection, died of an apparent heart attack. Elsen
was also a highly regarded teacher whose classes drew
large numbers of students.
The Board of Trustees approved 5.5 percent tuition,
slightly higher than the previous year's 5 percent jump.
The increase — which comes from a 2-percent increase
plus the inflation rate — brings tuition for the 1995-%
school year to $19,695.
Stanford announced plans to create a new interdisci
plinary program in Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity. The program will allow students to choose a major
or minor in Chicano Studies, Asian-American Studies or
African and Afro-American Studies. Much of the work
behind the proposal was done by two committees formed
to examine possible programs in Chicano Studies and
Asian-American Studies in the wake of the May 1994
hunger strike.
•MARCH
In a precedent-setting decision, Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone struck down Stanford's
speech code. Stone ordered an injunction against the Grey
Interpretation to the Fundamental Standard after nine
Stanford students and alumni brought a suit against the
University in May 1994. The group argued that the code
violated California's Leonard Law, which extends First
Amendment protections to students at private universi

ties.
•APRIL
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office
charged former Bookstore general manager Eldon Speed,
former assistant general manager Philip Chiaramonte and
former controller Patrick McDonald with grand theft and
tax evasion, the first criminal charges to he brought in a
case sparked when a Feb. 5, 1992 story in The Daily re
vealed that senior managers at the Bookstore were re
ceiving perks unheard of at other university bookstores.
Speed and Chiaramonte could both face up to eight years
in prison and McDonald live years for such alleged crimes
as using Bookstore money to purchase a house in 1 wain
Harte, Calif, and to make personal loans.
University President Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice announced that Stanford would nei
ther support a University-wide boycott ol grapes nor
allow administrative units — considered to be representa
tives of the University — to boycott. The decision, in re
sponse to a report released by a committee formed after
the May 1994 hunger strike, effectively continued the cur
rent policy but gave more University support to student
education on the issues.
University officials canceled the traditional Com
mencement procession in an effort it) shorten ceremonies
and move the event stage closer to the audience. Using nu
dity and beer to express their displeasure, seniors staged
protests over the demise of the "Wacky Walk" until the
University agreed to let students hold the procession if
they so chose.
•MAY
After failing to get enough pledges to fill 9() percent of
their houses with members, Kappa Alpha and Beta Theta
Pi lost their houses to the Draw. Since the University is re
viewing its policy on (ireek housing, the change could pos
sibly lead to some unhoused fraternities or sororities re
ceiving houses in the future.
•JUNE
Provost Condoleezza Rice outlined $4.6 million in bud
get cuts for the 1995-96 academic year, much of which was
to be achieved through holding allocations to the Univer
sity's academic divisions constant, without increasing for
inflation. Schools will also be charged a "space charge"
based on the square footage they occupy as well as a 6-per
cent levy on expenditures from restricted funds.
