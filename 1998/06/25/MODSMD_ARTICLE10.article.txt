## A 						foursome of Cardinal golfers return to the Bay Area for the U.S. Open Despite big attention from fans and the press, Stanford contingent falls victim to Olympic Club 
### Pat Bernhardt Staff writer 
None among a quartet of Cardi
nal golfers could best the unforgiv
ing greens at San Francisco's
Olympic Club during last week's
U.S. Open.
Four golfers with Stanford con
nections participated in America's
national championship, but only two,
Tiger Woods and Casey Martin,
made the cut and played all four
rounds. The others, Tom Watson
and senior Joel Kribel, were eliminat
ed after the second round on Friday.
Lee Janzen, the 1993 Open
champion, defeated the 156-man
field, firing an even-par 280 to claim
the $535,000 winner's purse. Janzen
edged out 1991 Open winner Payne
Stewart by a stroke. Stewart had led
the field for three and a half days,
faltering on the final nine holes of
the tournament.
On a surprisingly calm weekend
in San Francisco, no golfer broke

par in the tournament, causing
Stewart to dub the Olympic Club
the true Open winner.
Woods, who left the Farm two
years ago to pursue a career in pro
fessional golf, turned in the Stanford

Joel Kribel Missed cut by 11 Amatuer

contingent's best score, 10 strokes
behind Janzen at 10-over-par. The
PGA Tour's leading money winner
struggled with his putter all week,
turning in an uncharacteristic num
ber of two- and three-putts.
"I didn't play all that well," he
said after finishing the weekend with
a bogey on the 18th hole. "I didn't
quite make putts from 15 and 20 feet.

I hit a lot of lips that didn't go in."
Casey Martin, Class of '95, fin
ished one stroke behind Woods at
11-over-par. Martin, who sued in
federal court for the right to use a
motorized cart in the Open, labored

under constant media attention.
The 1994 second-team All-
American suffers from a birth de
fect in his right leg know as Klippel-
Trenauney-Webber Syndrome. Al
though he can walk, each step he
takes brings him closer to an immi
nent amputation. He claimed that
the Americans With Disabilities
Act exempted him from the PGA

rule prohibiting carts. Although
many professional golfers including
Woods and Watson opposed such
an exemption on the grounds that it
provided an unfair advantage, an
Oregon court disagreed and or
dered he be allowed to use a cart.
Martin, however, said he had ex
perienced nothing but goodwill
from fellow players and fans during
the week.
"It's been great all week," he
said "People have cheering me on
so much, it's been a blast ... The
players were tremendous and the
USGA was tremendous. Everyone
rooted me on, that's what I'll take
away from this week."
Watson, Class of '71, missed the
cut by one stroke, turning in an eight
over-par 148 after two rounds. After
a strong first round in which he led
playing partner Woods by a stroke,
the victor at the 1982 Open faltered
on Friday's back nine, making four
bogeys without a hole under par.
Having played in every U.S.
Open since 1971, Watson is no
stranger to disappointment at The
Olympic Club. In 1987, the last time
the San Francisco course hosted the
tournament, Watson saw a final
round lead evaporate in a one
stroke loss to Scott Simpson.
But the most disappointing Stan
ford performance came from Kri
bel. At last year's Open, the two
time All-American missed the cut
by a single stroke after a heart
breaking bogey-bogey-triple bogey
finish on the final three holes of the
second round. He improved, how
ever, to make the cut at this year's
Masters. With those experiences
and the benefit of a hometown
crowd, Kribel hoped to better his
Open performance this year.
For almost an hour on Thursday,
it looked as if he would. After a birdie
on the par-5 first hole, Kribel's name
appeared on the electronic leader
board in the U.S. Open Press Center.
After two pars on the succeeding
holes he retained his position in a 12-
way tie for third. That ended, howev
er, on the par-4 fourth hole.
His first shot found the deep, five
inch rough on the left side of the fair
way. From there, he made the first of
what would become a two-day series
of magnificent, explosive recoveries
from the long grass.
Following the shot, his ball came

to rest in the narrow neck of fair
way, 10 yards from the green. His
third shot, a short chip, got caught
in the soft, spongy fringe and never
made it to the putting surface. After
two putts missed the cup by only an
inch — the first a long, uphill 50
footer, the second a short 7 feet
downhill — a tap-in secured a dou
ble-bogey 6. Kribel's name fell off
the leaderboard, never to return.
The Pleasanton, Calif., native

enjoyed a loyal gallery of friends
and family, but they could not de
liver him from the lightning fast
greens and challenging pin place
ment. He three-putted four times in
the first 18 holes. That, a number of
drives into the rough and an un
playable-lie penalty led to five dou
ble bogeys on Thursday.
The 21-year-old finished the day
13-over-par, 17 shots behind leader
Stewart and ahead of only four
players.
Friday morning saw a better per
formance. A smaller gallery, again
including his mother, watched as
Kribel three-putted only twice. He
was only 5 over par for the day. But
he could not overcome his first
round 83, finishing with a two
round score better than only 11 oth
ers.
Kribel managed to shrug it off
with good humor. Walking up the
17th fairway, he pointed to his cad
die and laughed, "It's all his fault."
"I thought I played pretty good
yesterday. He just gave me bad ad
vice," he joked, evoking a laugh
from the man toting his Stanford
Cardinal golf bag. "'Hit in the left
rough,"' he imitated, "'that's a
great spot.'"

rooted me on, that's what I'll take
away from this week."
Watson, Class of '71, missed the
cut by one stroke, turning in an eight
over-par 148 after two rounds. After
a strong first round in which he led
playing partner Woods by a stroke,
the victor at the 1982 Open faltered
on Friday's back nine, making four
bogeys without a hole under par.
Having played in every U.S.
Open since 1971, Watson is no
stranger to disappointment at The
Olympic Club. In 1987, the last time
the San Francisco course hosted the
tournament, Watson saw a final
round lead evaporate in a one
stroke loss to Scott Simpson.
But the most disappointing Stan
ford performance came from Kri
bel. At last year's Open, the two
time All-American missed the cut
by a single stroke after a heart
breaking bogey-bogey-triple bogey
finish on the final three holes of the
second round. He improved, how
ever, to make the cut at this year's
Masters. With those experiences
and the benefit of a hometown
crowd, Kribel hoped to better his
Open performance this year.
For almost an hour on Thursday,
it looked as if he would. After a birdie
on the par-5 first hole, Kribel's name
appeared on the electronic leader
board in the U.S. Open Press Center.
After two pars on the succeeding
holes he retained his position in a 12-
way tie for third. That ended, howev
er, on the par-4 fourth hole.
His first shot found the deep, five
inch rough on the left side of the fair
way. From there, he made the first of
what would become a two-day series
of magnificent, explosive recoveries
from the long grass.
Following the shot, his ball came

to rest in the narrow neck of fair
way, 10 yards from the green. His
third shot, a short chip, got caught
in the soft, spongy fringe and never
made it to the putting surface. After
two putts missed the cup by only an
inch — the first a long, uphill 50
footer, the second a short 7 feet
downhill — a tap-in secured a dou
ble-bogey 6. Kribel's name fell off
the leaderboard, never to return.
The Pleasanton, Calif., native

enjoyed a loyal gallery of friends
and family, but they could not de
liver him from the lightning fast
greens and challenging pin place
ment. He three-putted four times in
the first 18 holes. That, a number of
drives into the rough and an un
playable-lie penalty led to five dou
ble bogeys on Thursday.
The 21-year-old finished the day
13-over-par, 17 shots behind leader
Stewart and ahead of only four
players.
Friday morning saw a better per
formance. A smaller gallery, again
including his mother, watched as
Kribel three-putted only twice. He
was only 5 over par for the day. But
he could not overcome his first
round 83, finishing with a two
round score better than only 11 oth
ers.
Kribel managed to shrug it off
with good humor. Walking up the
17th fairway, he pointed to his cad
die and laughed, "It's all his fault."
"I thought I played pretty good
yesterday. He just gave me bad ad
vice," he joked, evoking a laugh
from the man toting his Stanford
Cardinal golf bag. "'Hit in the left
rough,"' he imitated, "'that's a
great spot.'"
