# Four strokes of madness on the 16th
## Daily reporter Pat Bernhardt weathers the Tiger Woods frenzy for a hole 
### Pat Bernhardt Staff writer 
I got swept up in Tiger's tide Sunday
afternoon on the 16th hole.
I'd been hanging around the 609-
yard par 5 watching the middle-tier
groups pass. From the elbow of the
dogleg-left, I could watch each hit three
shots — one from the tee, a second
from the fairway, and a third, short
iron shot to the green. No one, not even
the power-driving John Daly, had
reached in two strokes.
As I watched Chris Perry hand a
fairway wood back to his caddie, a loud
cheer erupted from the 15th green,
some 250 yards to the north. Heads
around me turned. Others checked the
pairing sheet. But the answer came
from a teenage boy, shouting to some
one as he charged southward over a
berm: "Tiger Woods just parred 15."

The news stirred the crowd around
me. Those who had been sitting in the
grass or leaning against trees stood and
moved forward to secure a place
against the rope line that contained the
gallery. They anchored themselves in
place and prepared for the tide to come.
Over the rise came a surge of bod
ies, wave upon wave of people rushing
to find viewpoints. Most of them ran as
if they were late for church, trying to
balance their need for speed and golfs
demanding etiquette.
It was a crowd uncommon in profes
sional golf. Many were still in elemen
tary or middle school, many were
women and many were minorities.
Most wore T-shirts instead of collared
golf shirts. Some sported old Stanford
paraphernalia, while others dressed in
clothes emblazoned with the former
Cardinal's likeness.
Ten-over-par and 12 strokes behind

with three holes to play, no one in the
gallery harbored delusions of a heroic
Woods victory. Most, like Lewis Tay
lor, just came to watch him play.
Taylor has been following golfing
greats for more than 40 years, since his
first trip to The Olympic Club in 1955.
That year he and his father made a
three-day train trip from their home in
Dubuque, lowa, to watch Dubuque
native Jack Fleck play in the Open.
Fleck, in one of the most stunning up
sets in Open history, defeated golf leg
end Ben Hogan in an 18-hole playoff.
"Fleck was our club pro in lowa,"
Taylor recalled. "He gave me lessons
twice a week when I was 12 years old."
As he spoke, Woods hit his drive
300 yards down the fairway, landing
only 15 yards from our feet.
The return to San Francisco marked
Taylor's ninth U.S. Open. On each oc
casion he travels by train, spends a day
exploring the host city, and buys a Sun
day gallery pass. He picks one group
and follows it all day.
"Fleck was the only person I ever
followed to end up with the trophy," he
said, indicating his indifference to how
Tiger finished this year.
"I don't care if he wins today. I fol
lowed him today because he'll go down
as one of the greatest in the game,"
Taylor said. "I've seen all the other
greats play — Ben Hogan, Arnold
Palmer, Jack Nicklaus. I want to add
Tiger Woods to that list."
Taylor was explaining to me that
this would probably be his last Open
when Woods finally addressed his sec
ond shot.
The older man froze, ending his
thought mid-syllable. His eyes, having
never strayed from the young golfer
throughout our conversation, narrowed.
Woods took a pair of half-strength
practice swings with his 3-wood,
stepped behind his ball and gauged the
distance. As he again positioned him
self, the red light atop one of the NBC
cameras a hundred yards down the
fairway came on. Millions of people
across the country would see the next
swing.
But behind me, a small boy whis
pered urgently to his father, "Daddy, I
can't see." Without prompting, Taylor
reached his hand back and guided the
unknown boy to the rope line. "Thanks
Mister," the child whispered in reply.
Taylor smiled at that, but didn't relax
his furrowed brow or shift his gaze: the

man he'd come 2,5(X) miles to watch
had drawn back his club.
For half a second, a silence broken
only by the whining engines of the
Met Life blimp restrained 2,000 people.
The impact of metal club and ball
threw open the floodgates. Thousands
cheered; one young man across the
fairway snapped off a Black Power
salute and shouted "You da MAN!"
Only Taylor seemed to reserve
judgment until the shot came to rest.
Tracing its arc, I lost the ball against the
low clouds, but his more practiced eyes
did not. "It's short," he announced, as
the ball continued its descent. "He'll be
in the front bunker."
A moment later, I saw the ball fall
into the sand trap just 4 feet from the
green. The gallery there sighed collec
tively. The 16th hole had not been bro
ken; not even Tiger Woods could reach
its green in two.
Immediately after the ball came to
rest, the tide began to swell again. Peo
ple rushed to find new spots close to the
action. I turned to Taylor, but the wave
of bodies had already pushed him 5
yards away. He raised his hand to say
goodbye and turned, surrendering
himself to the current. I hung back
against a tree and waited for the most
anxious fans to pass.
By the time I reached the green.
Tiger had already pitched from the
sand to within 3 feet of the cup. I drew
back to a spot along the narrow rope
corridor connecting the 16th green and
the 17th tee. There, two San Francisco
police officers were telling a group of
pre-adolescent boys that Tiger
wouldn't stop to sign autographs.
In the background. Tiger sank his 3-
foot putt for a birdie, his first in 15
holes. The cheer was three times loud
er and twice as long as the one I'd heard
from the 15th green. And then, just as
before, the tide swelled and hurried to
its next vantage point.
A poker-faced Woods, his caddie
and several official scores paraded
through the corridor en route to the
next hole. As the group passed, one of
the boys, by far the youngest, spoke out
in a loose-tooth lisp; "Tiger, can I have
your ball?"
Tiger paused for half a stride, a wry
smile creeping across his face for the
first time in four days. "Not now kid,"
he replied, "I'm still using it."
And with that, he set off again, rid
ing his tide to the next tee.

his furrowed brow or shift his gaze: the

man he'd come 2,5(X) miles to watch
had drawn back his club.
For half a second, a silence broken
only by the whining engines of the
Met Life blimp restrained 2,000 people.
The impact of metal club and ball
threw open the floodgates. Thousands
cheered; one young man across the
fairway snapped off a Black Power
salute and shouted "You da MAN!"
Only Taylor seemed to reserve
judgment until the shot came to rest.
Tracing its arc, I lost the ball against the
low clouds, but his more practiced eyes
did not. "It's short," he announced, as
the ball continued its descent. "He'll be
in the front bunker."
A moment later, I saw the ball fall
into the sand trap just 4 feet from the
green. The gallery there sighed collec
tively. The 16th hole had not been bro
ken; not even Tiger Woods could reach
its green in two.
Immediately after the ball came to
rest, the tide began to swell again. Peo
ple rushed to find new spots close to the
action. I turned to Taylor, but the wave
of bodies had already pushed him 5
yards away. He raised his hand to say
goodbye and turned, surrendering
himself to the current. I hung back
against a tree and waited for the most
anxious fans to pass.
By the time I reached the green.
Tiger had already pitched from the
sand to within 3 feet of the cup. I drew
back to a spot along the narrow rope
corridor connecting the 16th green and
the 17th tee. There, two San Francisco
police officers were telling a group of
pre-adolescent boys that Tiger
wouldn't stop to sign autographs.
In the background. Tiger sank his 3-
foot putt for a birdie, his first in 15
holes. The cheer was three times loud
er and twice as long as the one I'd heard
from the 15th green. And then, just as
before, the tide swelled and hurried to
its next vantage point.
A poker-faced Woods, his caddie
and several official scores paraded
through the corridor en route to the
next hole. As the group passed, one of
the boys, by far the youngest, spoke out
in a loose-tooth lisp; "Tiger, can I have
your ball?"
Tiger paused for half a stride, a wry
smile creeping across his face for the
first time in four days. "Not now kid,"
he replied, "I'm still using it."
And with that, he set off again, rid
ing his tide to the next tee.
