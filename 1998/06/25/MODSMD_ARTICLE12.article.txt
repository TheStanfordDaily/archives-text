## Stanford – Korea ties deepen 
### Juno Nakamura Contributing writer 
During a public address at
Memorial Auditorium on
June 12, South Korean Presi
dent Kim Dae Jung called for
closer ties among South
Korea, Stanford and the Sili
con Valley.
"If we are to put the Kore
an economy back on the right
track, we must develop
democracy and a free market
economy in parallel as West
ern countries have done," Kim
said. "Democracy and a free
market economy must devel
op simultaneously for Korea
to emerge as a contender in the
free competition of the 21st
century."
Kim's visit to Stanford, part
of a nine-day tour of the Unit
ed States earlier this month,
does not solely reflect his inter
est in using the Stanford / Sili
con Valley relationship as a
model for forging a similar
academia-business network in
his own country. He said he
hopes that it will also mark the
development of increasingly
strong ties between the Uni
versity and South Korea.
Defining a
relationship
The Asia / Pacific Re
search Center, a division of the
Institute for International
Studies that is devoted to the
study of economic, political
and social change in Asia, is
beginning to form these ties.
The center sponsors din
ners and conferences with
Asian prime ministers and
cabinet ministers to spark dis
cussions about the Pacific
Rim. These discussions are
something that the center's Di
rector of Research James

Raphael feels are significant
for three reasons.
"They provide the Stanford
community with information
about countries such as South
Korea, they help form person
al connections with influential
Korean officials and business
people, and they enhance
Stanford's name in South
Korea," he said.
Stanford and the Silicion
Valley have gained greater
recognition among the Kore
an public because of the visit.
According to Korean Studies
Lecturer Sungdai Cho, Korea
had ignored the Silicon Valley
until the recent Asian eco
nomic crisis.
"It's not usual that the pres
ident [of Korea] comes to San
Francisco. Usually he goes to
New York and L.A.," he said.
"[Kim] came to ignite the Ko
rean economy and to make the
Silicon Valley people have an
interest in investing in Korea
and boosting the economy."
In his speech, Kim attempt
ed to encourage such invest
ment. "If foreigners make sub
stantial investments in Korea,
we will be able to repay our
foreign debts, acquire foreign
managerial techniques and in
crease our competitive
strength, greatly improve
managerial transparency, in
crease exports and create
jobs."
Kim also expressed interest
in emulating Silicon Valley
businesses as well as soliciting
investments. The Asia / Pacif
ic Research Center has al
ready began to facilitate this
interest. As part of its corpo
rate affiliate program this year,
the center invited two visiting
fellows from South Korea —
Woong Soon Song, who is a
corporate lawyer at Sam Sung
Co., and Dong Soo Kim, who
is a member of the Ministry of

Trade and Industry.
Dong, who is here on a
three-year fellowship, ex
pressed great interest in the
venture industries of the Sili
con Valley, which he said are
"unique for [South Koreans]."
He added that he has gained
much insight into developing
entrepreneurial enterprises of
the private sector, which he
said "should be worked on
more" in South Korea.
Kim agreed with this notion
in his speech. "Along with the
practice of founding venture
enterprises," he said, "a valu
able network has been formed
between Silicon Valley busi
nesses and Stanford Universi
ty professors and students. I
believe Korea can learn a great
deal from this and use it."
Already, there are venture
companies sponsored by the
Korean government whose
sole purpose is to provide a
link between Korean compa
nies and Silicon Valley indus
tries.
"The Pacific Rim is defi
nitely an area in which high
tech industry plays a large
role," said Dean of the School
of Engineering John Hen
nessy, "The growth of the sec
tor is stimulating alliances such
as the one between South
Korea and Stanford."
Genesis of a
program
Not only is the South Kore
an government eager to use
the Silicon Valley's influence
to bolster its economy, but it
also has "a keen interest" in
expanding the Korean Studies
program at Stanford, said Cho.
Establishments on campus
such as the Hoover Institution
are key in the program's devel
opment and should receive the

University's attention, accord
ing to Cho.
"The Hoover Institution
has good relations with the
Korean government, but there
is not much connection be
tween Hoover and the Univer
sity in terms of humanities,
since Hoover focuses on polit
ical science and international
relations," Cho said. "There's
not much connection with the
Korean government and the
University itself."
Although Stanford had
been an early leader in Asian
studies at the turn of the centu
ry, emphasis was placed pri
marily on China and Japan. In
fact, Korean Studies has been
a relative latecomer at Stan
ford, which lagged behind
Harvard and UC-Berkeley in
the field for a number of years.
According to Political Sci
ence Prof. Daniel Okimoto,
Korean Studies began to de
velop rapidly seven years ago
when Stanford received a grant
from the Korea Foundation.
This grant allowed the In
stitute for International Stud
ies and the School of Humani
ties and Sciences to invite one
or two professors from Korea
for a one-year term to give lec
tures about Korean related is
sues.
Okimoto attributed the de
velopment of Korean Studies
to the emerging status of South
Korea as an advanced, indus
trialized nation-state and to an
increasing number of Korean-
American students at Stan
ford. Many of these students
are second-generation Kore
an-Americans, children of the
large wave of Koreans who im
migrated to the United States
in the 19705.
In addition to the large
number of Korean-American
students, there are currently
220 Korean students enrolled

at Stanford, the second largest
group from an Asian country.
In recognition of the dy
namic rate of change in Korea
since World War 11, the Uni
versity allocated $3 million in
September 1996 to endow a
full-time professorship in Ko
rean Studies. This money will
allow Stanford to recruit a
leading Korean Studies schol
ar by the year 2000.
However, increased em
phasis on Korean Studies has
been somewhat limited in its
progress lately, due to current
Asian economic problems.
"In the last three to four
years, the relationship be
tween Stanford and South
Korea has been growing, but
recently there has been some

what of a tapering off of stu
dents because of the economic
turmoil in South Korea," said
Senior Hoover Fellow
Thomas Henriksen.
Despite the current situa
tion, Cho said he is optimistic
for the future of the Korean
Studies program.
"The University recog
nized this imbalance [and]
they are trying to accommo
date Korean programs," he
said. "There are many gradu
ate students who are doing po
litical science and internation
al studies on China and Japan.
They need to know the situa
tion in Korea as well."
