After 10 hours of negotiations
with a federal mediator, Stanford
Hospital nurses canceled a sched
uled strike in favor of a new con
tract that was drawn up on June 7.
The agreement was formulated
by hospital officials and the Com
mittee for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement (CRONA), a union
that represents 1,700 nurses at Stan
ford and Lucile Salter Packard Chil

dren's Hospital. Nurses ratified the
two-year contract with a majority
vote on June 11.
"The negotiations teams were
resolved to negotiate the contract
without going to the wire," said
Felix Barthlemy, head of human re
sources at UCSF-Stanford. "We be
lieve we have reached a fair and eq
uitable agreement for our nurses
which will allow us to continue to
deliver outstanding care to our pa
tients."
Initial reasons surrounding the

proposed strike included hospital's
pending cuts in nurses' vacation
days, health benefits for retirees
and salary. The nurses asked for an
11 percent salary increase over the
next two years, while the hospital
offered six percent over the same
time span.
The two groups finally settled on
an eight percent raise. The hospital
also wanted to equalize sick time for
all its employees.
"I know the biggest issue for the
nurses was not just pay, but sick

time," said Donalda Dunnett,
CRON A's executive vice president.
"Nurses do a lot of physical work,
and are obviously in very close con
tact with patients, which we believe
warrants extra sick time."
Under the pending cuts, nurses
would have been forced to either ac
cept the new accrual rate, that would
decrease their five sick days per
year, or lose the corporate benefit
program, which includes aid for re
tirement and special needs care such
as a vision plan.

The new contract has settled
these issues in a manner that is ac
ceptable for both sides.
"Now, those five days will accrue
in a different bank, and we have an
other accrual rate that is the same as
for other hospital workers," said
Dunnett.
According to Dunnett, most of
the nurses are pleased with the re
sults of the negotiations and result
ing contract, and they are hoping
the details of the agreement will de
velop well in the coming year.
