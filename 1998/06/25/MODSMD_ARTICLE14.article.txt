## Hutchinson, Bryans jump ship to pros 
### Molly Brizgys Jim Tankersley Staff writers 
Stanford sports lost three top ath
letes this month as two-sport stand
out Chad Hutchinson and tennis
stars Bob and Mike Bryan joined the
professional ranks.

Hutchinson ended months of spec
ulation Tuesday when he signed a re
ported $2.5 million contract to play
baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals.
The right-handed pitcher will report
immediately to the Cardinals' Class A
affiliate in Augusta. N.J., and will not
return next fall as the starting quarter
back for the Stanford football team.

"Chad is a tremendous athlete,"
said St. Louis Vice President / Gen
eral Manager Walt Jocketty. "His
talents could very well have led him
to a career in professional football."
The Cardinals picked Hutchinson
in the second round (48th overall) of
baseball's Amateur Draft earlier this
month. He went 10-5 on the year for
the Stanford baseball team, compil
ing a 4.89 ERA in 17 games. The At
lanta Braves selected him in the first
round of the 1995 draft, but he chose
to play two sports at Stanford instead.
In two seasons on the football
field, Hutchinson passed for 4,235
yards and 20 touchdowns. He was
named the 19% Sun Bowl MVP
after leading the Cardinal to a 38-0
victory over Michigan State.
Stanford baseball manager Mark
Marquess and football head coach Ty
rone Willingham will miss Hutchinson
on their teams next year, but both men
praised him after the decision.
"I am extremely excited for
Chad," Marquess said. "This is a great
opportunity for him to show what he
can do at the professional level."
"I am ecstatic in the manner that
Chad is entering professional sports,
but saddened with the fact that we
are losing an outstanding young man
and athlete," Willingham said.
Bryans headed for ATP
Sophomore tennis sensations
Bob and Mike Bryan announced
June 15 they would leave Stanford to
join the professional circuit.

The identical twin brothers have
signed with ProServ to manage their
professional careers and will com
pete in their first ATP Tour event
July 18-26 at the Legg Mason Tennis
Classic in Washington.
Bob Bryan will receive a wild
card berth to the U.S Open in Au
gust and both brothers will receive a
wild card bid in doubles.
"We're eager to face the competi
tion of the pro circuit," the Bryans
said in a statement. "We know it's
going to be tough, and we will learn a
lot in the first few months. But we
feel we're ready for the challenge."
Throughout the collegiate season,
the Bryans dominated the NCAA
circuit. As a doubles team, they fin

ished with a 19-0 record and had a
collective singles record of 42-1.
In May, the Stanford men's tennis
team blew away the collegiate com
petition at nationals, handily win
ning its fourth straight team title 4-0.
Bob Bryan won the triple crown,
taking the singles title over Stanford
teammate Paul Goldstein and then
teamed up with his brother to win
the doubles title.
"I feel so fortunate to have Bob
and Mike here for the past two years.
I am very proud of their accomplish
ments," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "I know they will con
tinue to carry the Stanford banner
high as they join the other great Car
dinal players out on the pro tour."
