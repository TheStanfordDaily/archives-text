## Live 105's BFD 5 — a big deal indeed 
### Jonathan Lischke 
Spending a Friday at Live
105's "BFD 5" concert at
Shoreline Amphitheatre was
the perfect way to welcome
the first weekend of summer.
The venue was set up for a big
party and was complete with
two stages, a beer garden and
scores of community service
booths. You could give money
to save the whales at one booth
and spend $25 on a Green Day
T-shirt at another.
The BFD crowd ranged
from the rebellious high school
students inhaling cigarettes to
the efficient Silicon Valley
workers plugging away on lap
tops while the bands raged on.
During the 15 minute break
between bands, the crowd en
tertained itself by playing
catch with blown-up condoms,
rolling down the grass hill as
human logs and dog piling.
The concert started
promptly at 3 p.m. and the ac
tion was on the main stage.
The second stage was a plat
form stage and was situated
adjacent to the beer garden

(which I don't think was coin
cidence). The first group, Save
Ferris, started on time to the
satisfaction of a couple hun
dred people relaxing in the sun
on the grass. Save Ferris
seemed to appreciate the
young and enthusiastic crowd
as lead vocalist Monique Pow
ell thanked the crowd again
and again for coming early to
support the group.
Fastball, a trio from Texas,
took the stage after Save Fer
ris. The group saved its most
popular song, "The Way," (in
cidentally number one on Live
105's play list) for last.
After Fastball, Marcy
Playground took the stage. It
played such favorites as
"Poppy Seeds" and"St. Joe
on the School Bus." Marcy
Playground concluded with
"Sex and Candy." As the
band struck the first chord of
the overplayed song, the au
dience nontheless erupted
into applause.
Next the audience was
greeted by a familiar radio
voice — that of Adam Carolla,
Dr. Drew's "Love Line" side

kick. Carolla introduced the
next group, the Deftones, and
mentioned that they had been
guests on "Love Line" the
night before.
Hopefully the Deftones are
better at giving advice to
teenage girls deciding whether
or not to dump their
boyfriends than they are at
performing live. I've heard
better music coming out of the
mouth of a screaming baby
than from the four-member
band. Most of the crowd
seemed to be in pain except for
a handful of their fans who
moshed and beat each other
up until security intervened.
The next group. Blink 182,
revived the energy in the am
phitheatre with its hit
"Dammit." Immediately after
Blink played, the entire crowd
rushed to Stage 2 where Green
Day was to play. While waiting
for Green Day, the crowd was
entertained by bikers who per
formed on the half-pipe. Some
of their stunts were sloppy
enough to make one think that
the bikers had made one too
many trips to the beer garden.

When Green Day finally
took the stage, lead vocalist
Billy Joe explained that the
band was performing on the
secondary stage because there
was no way that he would
"ever play on that shitty REM
amphitheater stage where
people sit down and listen to
music." Green Day played fa
vorites from "Nimrod," "In
somniac" and "Dookie."
Halfway through the perfor
mance, Billy Joe played a
heavy metal gig which includ
ed song clips from Metallica,
Black Sabbath, Survivor and
Marilyn Manson.
Toward the end of Green
Day's performance, Billy Joe
ripped off his velcro-attached
pants to reveal a leopard skin
bikini brief. He pranced
across the stage in his new
outfit, lit the drums on fire and
played the Star Spangled
Banner. These vintage BFD
antics inspired some men to
mosh and some women to
bare their breasts.
After Green Day, the mob
of concert-goers returned to
the main stage to hear Prodi

gy. When lead vocalist Keith
Flint decided to jump into
the stands, his fans wouldn't
let him get back on stage
until security intervened and
rescued him.
By the time Crystal
Method played, most of the
crowd had left and people

were huddling together for
warmth. An entertaining light
show accompanied the band's
melodic and electronic sound,
and concluded the event.
All in all, BFD 5 was an
amazing concert and a perfect
beginning to a summer of
music.
