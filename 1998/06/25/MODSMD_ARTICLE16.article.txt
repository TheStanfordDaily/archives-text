# Disney's Mulan
## 
### 
Even in a movie as enthralling as "Mulan,"
it's hard to not notice how similar it is to
other Disney films. It has the same attention to
detail, catchy music and mix of humor and
drama. But "Mulan" updates the Disney ani
mation formula — it's got a strong female
heroine and no significant romantic subplot.
The story, set in ancient China, concerns a
young woman Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen).
While her family worries about who she will
marry, the emperor issues a decree that every
family must send at least one male to war. To
prevent her ill but honorable father from leav
ing, Mulan runs off in the middle of the night
and poses as his non-existent "son." What she
lacks in physical skill, she makes up for in
brains, making a difference in the fight and
winning the respect of her "fellow" men.
Their enemies don't give up easily, though.

There is a lot of action and stunning animation
amid Mulan's soul-searching and witty repar
tee with her guardian dragon.
Did I neglect to mention the dragon? That's
Eddie Murphy as the puny, wise-cracking
wanna-be hero / guardian of Mulan's family.
Make sure your little siblings don't miss some
of the movie's great comic characters, even if
they fall asleep through the serious discussions
of honor and "one's proper place"
Though grave, these discussions are essen
tial to the film, which is about a woman's jour
ney to find herself despite circumstances that
demand she act as someone else.
As with other Disney movies, you never ex
pect the heroine to lose her struggle, action se
quences are contrived, and the drama and
humor don't always seamlessly mix.
Suspend these critical thoughts, and
"Mulan" is an entertaining and inspiring film,
both for its animation and for its content.
