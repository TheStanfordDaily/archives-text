# Six Days, Seven Nights
## 
### 
6 Oix Days, Seven Nights" is the latest film by
Olvan Reitman, the director whose credits
include "Indiana Jones," "Ghostbusters" and
last summer's "Air Force One." Unlike his earli
er adventure movies, this is a romantic comedy.
The story begins when New Yorker Frank
Martin (David Schwimmer) takes his girl
friend, fashion magazine editor Robin Monroe
(Anne Heche), to an island in the South Pacific
for a relaxing holiday. They've only been there
one day when Robin is unexpectedly called to
lead a photo shoot for her magazine in nearby
Tahiti. She must then convince Quinn Harris
(Harrison Ford) to fly her there because he is
the only pilot at the resort.
The two castaways have entirely incompati
ble personalities, yet they are forced together
when their two-seater crashes before they
reach Tahiti. Instead of trauma or terror, it's ro
mance and comedy that blooms between them.
The sexual tension between Ford and
Henche is played so well that it completely
masks Heche's real-life status as a lesbian. Her
character changes from a prissy, complaining
New Yorker to a fearless, no-nonsense woman.
While the plot is generally coherent, a few at
tention-grabbing scenes are too far-fetched. The

characters are also inconsistent. Ford and Heche
are believable, but Schwimmer and Quinn's girl
friend Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) are too
cartoonish. When Quinn and Robin are pre
sumed dead, Frank and Angelica immediately
hop into bed together. Angelica blames their af
fair on the stress of losing Quinn, and Frank says
he was too weak to resist Angelica's charms. Nei
ther rationale seems believable.
"Six Days, Seven Nights" is not top-notch,
but is definitely a good romantic adventure
film. The amusing plot and the acting of Ford
and Heche make this film well worth seeing.
