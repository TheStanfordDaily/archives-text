## Editor's welcome A 						time to reflect School, paper take stock in summer 
### 
AT THE RECENT Com
mencement exercises. Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper once again recounted one of
my favorite Stanford stories. It is of a
student whom he had once observed
staring contemplatively at the "You
are here" label on a campus map.
The student muttered, "Yes, but
why?"
As I sat listening to Casper in a
sunbaked Stanford Stadium, I per
ceived that this question is not solely
applicable to us as individuals. It is a
question that Stanford and The Daily
as institutions must continually ex
amine.
In the case of the University, the
events of the past three weeks sug
gest the endless task of defining an in
stitution's purpose. A new dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences was appointed after hours of
reflection on the part of administra
tors, faculty and students as to the
school's direction.
Yet, new roles for the University
continue to emerge. In his recent
visit. South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung cited the University as a
model for a successful partnership
between academia and business, a
model that he hopes to emulate in his
homeland.
And five NCAA championships
in the past year suggest other images
— Stanford as a "jock school" or con
versely as a model for the cultivation
of stellar "scholar athletes." Defining
Stanford and its mission is more com
plex than it initially seems.
As we begin the summer volume
and transition from daily to weekly
publication, it is also useful for us at
The Daily to consider why we are
here. And as is true with individuals
and with the University as an institu
tion, some of the answers to why
there is a summer paper are easily ar
ticulated and others are less tangible.
We are here because we are com
mitted to bringing you up-to-date
news, commentary, photography,

sports and entertainment as you
would expect from a summer incar
nation of The Daily. We are also here
because The Weekly offers us an op
portunity to experiment and to hone
a different set of skills.
The magazine-like format en
ables us to do more feature pieces.
The expanded timetable allows us to
do more extensive reporting and
challenges us to find creative ways to
keep news relevant and interesting.
Additionally, we can reach out to and
be enriched by a broader audience
that includes high school students,
students from other universities and
international students.
This process of questioning why
we are here may be particularly acute
at the start of a summer volume —
many familiar faces are absent from
the office, as is the routine of consec
utive late nights. But beyond the sur
face differences, our mission as both
a news and teaching organization re
mains central.
Yet, even with that mission in
mind, it would be shortsighted if we
didn't acknowledge that this process
is ever-evolving, and that it is pro
foundly shaped by what is happening
on campus, in the Bay Area and
around the world.
During the next nine weeks, I
hope that all of us come closer to un
derstanding the less tangible reasons
why we are here. And I ask you, our
readers, to keep us reflecting on this
question by making the paper a part
of your week, by sharing your com
ments and criticisms — or by joining
our staff and helping produce the
paper.
For now, best wishes for a summer
of enrichment, exploration and re
laxation. You are here. Live it up!
