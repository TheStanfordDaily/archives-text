# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Lessons from an old punslinger 
### 
I FINALLY GET through to my
dad at 10:37 p.m. Sunday, after
12 hours of phoning, pacing and
worrying that, for the first time in my
life, I won't hear his voice on Fa
ther's Day. When he answers (on the
first ring), I abruptly forget all the
glowing, poetic, World's Greatest
Dad speeches that I spent the after
noon rehearsing. "Happy Father's
Day," I stammer. "I miss you."
He says he misses me, too. His
tone says he is as relieved as I am that
we have finally connected.
He tells me about his weekend,
about the two weddings in three days
he's attended. The second was
today, four hours away in Seattle,
and he just got home.
The funny thing, I think as we
talk, is that I miss him more at this
moment than I ever have. Why now?
Why miss him more than fall of
my freshman year, away from home
for the first time? Why more than
last summer, my first Real World ex
perience, living, working and "build
ing character" (Dad code for "being
miserable") alone in Boise?
Why now, at the start of a promis
ing summer, when 1 am enjoying my
job, my apartment, my own cook
ing? I'm relaxed, happy and com
fortably independent.
So why am I homesick, and why
do I miss a tall, brown-eyed balding
guy, pushing 50, who rides a Honda
motorcycle and is neanng the Guin

ness world record for bad puns in a
lifetime?
It takes a while to figure it out.
Looking around in the apartment,
talking about summer activities, it
dawns on me.
I'm turning into my father.
This is not the early-life crisis of a
20-year-old afraid to fall into the
"boring" life of his dad. I'm not lec
turing my friends on learning from
each situation. I'm not resigning my
self to the grind of the working
world. I'm barely adopting his eccen
tricities, though puns are slowly in
fecting my sense of humor.
It's not even a bad thing. I grew
up with two simple life goals: to play
major league baseball and to be a
good dad. I'm still holding on to one
of them, though you never know
when the Dodgers might come call
ing. Dad encouraged me early on to
have a back-up plan.
Five years ago, my mother's fa
ther, the only Grandpa I ever knew,
passed away. I miss him, too. He was
a journalist, a jazz lover and one of
the kindest men I've ever met. I used
to spend summer weeks attending
basketball camps in Portland, and I
would stay in his apartment, which
looked and smelled and felt a little
like my room in Mirrielees.
I'd like to think I'm turning into
him, too.
I won't be ready to be a dad (and
certainly not a grandpa) anytime

soon. But the traits I admire in my fa
ther and grandfather — patience,
maturity, compassion and selfless
ness, to name a few — are those 1
want to develop as I enter adult
hood. Father's Day is a great re
minder of that.
That's why I nearly went crazy
waiting for my dad to get home. I
needed that reminder.
We talk for a long time, my dad
and I. We talk about the rest of the
family, our jobs, California and Ore
gon weather. With every silence, I
fear he will remind me of the late
hour and excuse himself off to bed.
But I don't want him to go, so I just
keep talking. And he keeps listening
and asking questions. If he's taking
notes, he probably could write a
short novel on my month of June. He
eventually breaks the conversation,
but not to tell me he needs sleep.
"I'm really happy for you," he
says."It sounds like you're going to
have just a fantastic summer."
I smile and thank him. The funny
thought returns. Isn't it nice to know,
I ask him, that I miss you even when
I'm happy?
He laughs for a long time.
I didn't even make a pun.

Jim Tankersley, a junior majoring in
political science, is spending his
summer safely on campus as the
