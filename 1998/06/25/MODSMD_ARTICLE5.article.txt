## Sending off the Class of 1998 
### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
A flurry of black robes and other
assorted outfits flooded the field at
Stanford Stadium for the 107 th
Commencement, that began with
the traditional Wacky Walk.
As this year's notorious yell lead
ers circled the stadium track one last
time with enormous flags sailing
above, the Class of 1998 celebrated
in full force the end of its undergrad
uate years.
Amid jazzy tunes from the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop Commence

ment Ensemble, the usual whizzing
Frisbees and baseballs were accom
panied by Pac Man evading three
ghosts, a full-fledged heavyweight
prize fight and a clan of giant bal
loon-headed graduates. Some
played Twister, while others parad
ed proudly with signs saying
"Thanks Mom and Dad" in various
languages. A Chinese dragon
weaved through the crowd, being
careful not to trounce on those who
felt compelled to simply sit in the
grass and enjoy the sun.
As he approached the rostrum,
University President Gerhard

Casper garnered cheers from the
class, which he dubbed "Los ninos
de El Nino" ("the children of El
Nino"). Quoting 16th century hu
manist Francois Rabelais, Casper
called the Class of '98 "lively, jovial,
handsome, brisk ... witty, frolic,
cheerful ... frisk," and he received
an impromptu "wave" in apprecia
tion.
Casper reminded the graduates
that "the search to know is unceas
ing, an ultimately inexhaustible
task."
"I trust that you have been here
because it was the place where you

could fully experience the pleasures
that come from studies blossoming
and minds moving," Casper said. "I
wish that those pleasures will contin
ue to enrich and ennoble your lives."
Graduates cheered again as
Casper introduced ABC's Nightline
Anchor and Managing Editor Ted
Koppel, the Commencement speak
er. Koppel, prompted by a letter
from Casper, spoke on the Ameri
can public's standards of public and
private morality, specifically refer
ring to "that mess in Washington."
"What we have done in America
today is turn ethics into a commodi-

ty," Koppel said. "Virtue may still he
its own reward, but we lose touch
with its meaning when we allow it to
be denied by the standards of the
marketplace or the political arena."
Koppel drew on examples of dis
continuities in the public's interpre
tations of public and private rights.
"We live in a society that not only
tolerates but rewards Jerry Springer
and Larry Flynt," Koppel said,
"while simultaneously removing
Huckleberry Finn and Shakespeare
from the curricula of some of our
schools and universities, lest they of
fend."
