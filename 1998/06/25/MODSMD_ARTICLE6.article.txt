# Beasley brings diverse experiences to new position
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Malcom Beasley is as close to a
Stanford native as it gets. The incom
ing dean of Humanities and Sciences
and current Theodore and Sydney
Rosenberg Professor of Applied
Physics was born in Stanford Hospital.
Yet Beasley's journey to the helm
of Stanford's largest school has been
a circuitous one. He spent over three
decades away from Stanford, having
lived in Hawaii during World War II
and later on the East Coast. Educat
ed at Cornell, Beasley left a teaching
position at Harvard to return to Stan
ford in 1974.
According to Beasley, Stanford
offered an environment that comple
mented his interests, which he de
scribes as ranging from "basic science
to the science basic to technology."
Self-described as disliking the center
stage, Beasley has been a quiet, yet
active participant in the University
since then.
A University citizen
Beasley is no stranger to the work
ings of the administration. During the
past two decades he has served as
chair of the Applied Physics Depart
ment, a faculty senator, a two-time
member of the Appointments and
Promotions Committee, and for the
past six years has served as the direc
tor of the Center for Materials Re
search. These experiences have given
Beasley a deep appreciation for the
quality of the faculty and for the chal
lenges of affecting change.
"Change is hard and it takes a
long time, but I've learned that if you
stick with it people will do the right
thing," he explained.
According to many of his col
leagues, Beasley has been a valuable
asset to the University, most notably
for his work in constructing intellec
tual communities and conceptualiz
ing issues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice com
mented that Beasley, who is also by
courtesy a professor in the School of
Engineering, was instrumental in
bringing faculty together to build the
McCullough Annex, the lab building
for the Center for Materials Re
search that is part of the new Science
and Engineering Quad.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
recounted his experiences working
with Beasley when Thomas was an
associate dean and Beasley was the
chair of the Applied Physics Depart
ment. "Beasley taught me what it
meant to be an institutional agent,"
Thomas said.
"Beasley's very much a long range
thinker, a skill that is very important

at this time," added Associate Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Hans
Andersen.
A teacher and researcher
Although Beasley has gained in
ternational prominence for his re
search on superconductors as part of
the so-called KGB group, which also
includes applied physics colleagues
Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik and Prof.
Emeritus Theodore Geballe, he
takes great pride in his teaching.
He cites the experience of develop
ing and teaching a physics course for
non-scientists as one of his most fulfill
ing experiences at Stanford. For this
course he won the Dean's Award for
Distinguished Teaching in the School
of Humanities and Sciences in 1983.
"That award means a great deal to
me because it didn't start off so per
fectly. But once I figured out how to do
it, it went very well. In terms of a cur
ricular thing, while I've done my share
of undergraduate teaching, that was
special and different," Beasley said.
Most recently, Beasley has been
working to develop an undergraduate
minor in the program. Until now, Ap
plied Sciences has only granted gradu-

ate degrees.
Beasley is also
an active support
er of the Intro
ductory Studies
Program and
other recent ini
tiatives that have
attempted to per
sonalize the early
undergraduate yean

"The value added that you can
give the undergraduate experience
by contact with scholars is enormous.
You can make a course better by
using more technology, but a dia
logue / seminar enriches the experi
ence of everyone involved. It is that
kind of mentoring experience that
uses rather than fights the resources
of the University," Beasley said.
Beasley's teaching extends to his
colleagues as well. "Beasley was and
still is a colleague in science, a friend
and a 'wise man' who has a fantastic
feeling for relations among people,"
said Kapitulnik. "In my early days at
Stanford, Beasley in a very artful way
guided me through adviser-student
relations."
On Stanford and
becoming dean
During the two-plus decades that
he has been at Stanford, Beasley has
observed the University mature as an
institution.
"It has more traditions than when
I came, but it is still in some sense

defining what kind of institution it is
and this is something that I find very
exciting," he said.
However, he also noted the chal
lenges inherent in an era in which
academia is not experiencing enor
mous growth. "This factor raises is
sues of how we should run our busi
ness to be as strong as it can in the fi
nancial climate and cultural milieu in
which live."
Yet Beasley remains optimistic
about the University's future. "Stan
ford is still getting better in terms of
how it operates as a University and it
is also getting better in terms of the
quality of its faculty. The search com
mittee asked me whether it is harder
to get tenure here now than it used to
be, and I think it is. The place is bet
ter and it is recruiting from a wider
range of places, including overseas,"
Beasley said.
On his plans for his tenure as
dean, Beasley explained that this is
not a time for "automatic pilot."
"I'd like to use my tour of duty to
strengthen the place with the best ap
pointments and to handle its diversi
ty to make sure that ideas get ex
pressed. Deans make principal deci
sions on appointments and those de
cisions impact the institution for 20
years or more," Beasley said.
On the issue of tenure for minori
ty and women faculty, Beasley em
phasized that he sincerely believes
that the recent discussion in the Fac
ulty Senate was a useful expression of
concerns and feelings on the part of
faculty. "A re-commitment to diver
sity as it is thoughtfully expressed is a
good thing," Beasley said, "though I
do support the provost's position that
at the level of tenure no distinctions
should be made. This is a real quality
issue, and this is good for both the in
stitution and the people involved."
When asked why he took on this
position at this point in his career,
Beasley lightheartedly remarked
that it's "one hell of a way of dealing
with your late middle age crisis."
A diverse school with
diverse needs
With faculty interests ranging
from literature to anthropology to
chemistry. Humanities and Sciences
is Stanford's most diverse school.
Thomas, who served as the school's
dean from 1988-1993, emphasized
that the key to success is learning to
manage the school rather than being
beaten down by the diversity of its
needs.
"It's complexity could look daunt
ing, but you can get your hands
around it. Indeed its great advantage
is its diversity," said Thomas.
Beasley echoed Thomas in em

phasizing the importance of the
school as a single unit. "1 don't think
anybody who has thought hard about
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences doesn't recognize that it is hard
to make it work because of all of its
diversity. But it needs to be a single
school principally because of the
teaching role it plays. So you have to
keep trying to find the best way to do
it — some of it is administrative,
some of it is leadership and some of it
is bully pulpiting."
Although he recognizes that
meeting the school's vast variety of
needs isn't an easy task, Beasley said
he is not aware of any serious contro
versies that have arisen among the
three elements of the school.
"Even in budget cutting days, I
think that everybody understood
that this is a school and that we would
rise and fall together," Beasley said.
The personal side
Beasley praises the University for
its outward look, a characteristic that
many of his colleagues have noted he
also possesses.

"Several years ago, I was working
with a group of people on a project
and among the group was a Chinese-
American," Beasley said. The pro
ject was in a state of crisis, and this
particular individual had asked
Beasley how he felt about it."I said
that I couldn't tell yet whether this
was a good thing or a problem,"
Beasley said. Six months later the
man sent a work of calligraphy which
portrayed the word for 'crisis' in Chi
nese. "It consists of the characters
'danger' and 'opportunity.' He had
captured my emotions at that mo
ment, and I was really very touched."
When not teaching, researching
or participating in University com
mittees, Beasley enjoys hiking and
relaxing in the mountains.
Beasley and his wife, Jo Anne, re
cently purchased land in the Trinity
Alps, a region west of Shasta, where
they have been vacationing for over
20 years. They plan on building a
cabin there that will be designed by
their daughter Claire, a San
Francisco architect.
