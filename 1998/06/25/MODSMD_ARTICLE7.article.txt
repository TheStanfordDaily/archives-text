### Juno Nakamura Contributing writer 
This month, Stanford graduate
Kristine Penner was awarded the
Howard R. Swearer Student Hu
manitarian Award for outstanding
public service. .
The award is named in honor of
the late Howard R. Swearer, the 15th
president of Brown University. She
was selected as one of five college
students to receive the award out of
an unprecedented 80 applications.
Penner, a 1998 human biology
graduate, gained interest in com
munity service in 1997 while intern
ing under the assistant secretary of
Planning and Evaluation at the
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Resources as part of the
Stanford in Washington program.
While working to reform the immi
grant health and human services
policy, Penner became concerned
about the access Latino immigrants
have to health care.
After this experience, Penner
began volunteering at the
May View Community Health Cen
ter in Santa Clara County, which
has two clinics that cater primarily
to low income Latinos.
According to Penner, the clinics
face reductions in federal and state
funding because many of their
clients are undocumented immi
grants. When Penner expressed a
desire to increase volunteers to
lessen the staffs burden, the direc
tor asked her to become the Cen
ter's volunteer coordinator.
Subsequently, Penner enlisted
and trained 28 Stanford students, flu
ent in Spanish and interested in med
icine, to become patient advocates.
Penner said that once she began
working at the clinic, "work and re
sponsibilities seemed to grow on
their own, based on both the clin
ic's needs and my experiences and
interest."

The award recipients each re
ceive $1,500 to support a service pro
gram chosen by the student. Penner
plans to use her money to establish a
service learning program and im
prove the training program and ma
terials at the May View Community
Health Center.
Penner's academic adviser Don
ald Barr, a physician and a lecturer in
human biology, nominated her for
the award.
According to Barr, Penner has a
"clear sense that it is both possible
and crucially important for an indi
vidual to make a difference in better
ing the lives of others."
Currently, Penner is creating an
informational class for patients to
gain access to resources available
at clinics.
In the fall Penner will be work
ing as the head course assistant for
the B side of the Human Biology
Core. Penner said she is very excit
ed about encouraging students to
get involved in student learning
services.
Her aspiration is to become a
practicing physician and an "advo
cate for change through encourag
ing others to join me in working to
improve the delivery of health ser
vices to all individuals, but particu
larly the Latino population."
