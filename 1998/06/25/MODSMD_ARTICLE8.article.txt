# Terra will keep murals
## Art to maintain residence's unique spirit 
### Juno Nakamura Contributing writer 
After two months of negotiations
between Terra House residents and
Housing and Dining Services over
how the Capital Improvement Plan
will impact their house, Housing and
Dining Services has decided that
Terra residents will be able to keep
existing murals.
According to Diana Conklin,
manager for undergraduate resi
dent facilities in Housing and Din
ing Services, this decision was made
in response to undergraduate needs
for a sense of community, which stu
dents contend the murals help to
uphold.
"The murals convey a sense of
residential history," said Daniel
Rochberg, the resident assistant at
Terra, that fosters "a community
like atmosphere."
However, the decision prevents
residents from painting new murals.
Existing murals may also be removed
if an individual makes a request.
According to the CIP, the original
plan was to paint over all Terra murals
to simplify the decor for adults staying
at Stanford for summer conferences.
In protest. Terra residents Eric Cam
pano, Thomas Willeke and others
drafted a petition in defense of the
murals and residential education in
undergraduate cooperative houses.
"Two summers ago Kairos un
derwent a complete overhaul of
their murals under CIP and the at
mosphere became kind of sterile.
We did not want the same thing to
happen to Terra," said ASSU Vice
President Santos Marroquin.
In a survey of Kairos residents,
Campano found that the majority of
residents felt more negative about the

living environment after the overhaul
of the murals. According to Cam
pano, this controversy reflects the on
going struggle between University ef
forts to cut the Housing budget and
undergraduate needs for an environ
ment that fosters independence and
communal living habits.
Conklin said that Housing Ser
vices is trying its best to balance the
communal needs of the undergradu
ate community and ensure that resi
dents feel comfortable, while maxi
mizing gains achieved in the ongoing
, 15-year, $200 million CIP project.
While Kairos residents may have
felt slighted in the process,
Rochberg said Conklin has been
very open to student voice through
out the petitioning process.
Rochberg also points to efforts
made by Associate Director of Res
idential Education Ann Porteus in
organizing the Stanford Unified
Co-op Council this year.
"We take pride in offering a
strong and responsive student hous
ing program that is the envy of other

colleges and universities nation
wide," said Associate Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney.
Despite the rules regarding new
murals, residents are generally satis
fied with the decision and feel that
the University was responsive to
students' concerns.
Marroquin said the decision is
crucial in not turning Terra into a
"cookie-cutter dorm." Willeke and
others said they hope that the same
standards will apply to Enchanted
Broccoli Forest and Columbae
House, both of which have murals
that may be threatened by CIP ren
ovations during the summers of
1999 and 2003 respectively.
Willeke applauded co-ops as
"one of the best learning environ
ments Res Ed offers," and hopes
that the University will continue sup
porting undergraduate student
needs.
Rochberg said that student ini
tiative such as the Terra movement
is key to sustaining any kind of resi
dential tradition.


Carissa Zenortni â€” Daily
Seascape, painted by 1995-96 resident Sulggi Lee in room 200 of
Terra House, is one of the many murals which will be preserved
due to the efforts of Terra residents in petitioning Housing and Din
ing Services.
