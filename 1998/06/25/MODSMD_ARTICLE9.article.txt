Chris Hooyman was a climber in
all respects.
Whether powering up the hilly
course at Fort Ord with the cycling
team or conquering the northern
Sierras and Mount Rainier, Hooy
man kept his sights on the top.
Tragically, it was his love of the
outdoors that led to his death almost
a month after his 21st birthday.
On his last mountain climb, Hooy
man disappeared on June 6 into the
thick snows of Mount McKinley in
Alaska's Denali National Park.
His body was found June 14 by

park rangers at 15,200 feet on the
mountain.
Two years ago, Hooyman had
scaled this mountain, becoming at 19
the youngest person to reach its top.
Hooyman was helping guide four
hikers back down the mountain when
one of the climbers was knocked over
by a strong wind.
Hooyman undipped himself from
the ropes to help the climber, but slid
2,000 feet to his death.
It was in Hooyman's nature to
continually aid others and to share his
knowledge of mountaineering.
During his sophomore year, he be
came an instructor for Stanford's
Outdoor Education Program, a

group that makes educational wilder
ness trips.
"I will live differently having known
him," said senior Amy Dickie, a
friend of Hooyman's who also
worked at the program. "I've learned
a lot about how to live in the moment
and seize every opportunity."
This enthusiasm that his friends
remember is something that Hooy
man brought not only to the Outdoor
Education Program, but also to his
cycling.
"Chris would always show up to
practice in this golden jersey that said
'team leader' on it," said Art Walker,
Hooyman's cycling coach for two sea
sons.

"He didn't care about its appear
ance, so maybe he didn't look like a
conventional racer, but he acted like a
racer," Walker said.
Teammate junior Will Parks cited
an example from one race when
Hooyman dropped back from the
front of the pack to encourage him
forward.
"He was always there trying to be
a good teammate to the rest of us, in
stead of just thinking of himself,"
Parks said.
Affectionately termed "Race
Leader Chris" by his cycling team
mates, Hooyman participated in gru
eling and time-consuming winter
practices, despite a heavy academic

load as an engineering student.
The hard practice paid off when
Hooyman won his first race at a com
petition in Davis in the spring.
Hooyman took a break from the
cycling team when he stopped out last
year to mountain climb in the United
States and Europe.
He had dedicated a great deal of
time to climbing, having spent past
summers as a mountain guide in Seat
tle.
Services for Hooyman were held
at his old high school. Lakeside
School, in Seattle; he is survived by his
parents, Eugene and Nancy Hooy
man, his sister Mani and his brother
Kevin.
