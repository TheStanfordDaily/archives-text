Look what The Center for Teaching
and Learning has to offer this summer!
CTL 116 - Critical Thinking. Critical thinking encompasses knowing how to find
assumptions, recognize ambiguity, evaluate arguments, and judge the credibility
of sources of expert opinion. To tnink critically in one's daily life and studies
requires being comfortable with questions instead of answers, complexity instead
of simplicity, uncertainty instead of certainty. These abilities are developed
through practical exercises based on contemporary issues and through practice
with assignments from a variety of disciplines. 3 units, Leslie Townsend, lecturer.
Meets MW 1:15 - 2:30 pm in Skilling Auditorium.
CTL 40, Reading Faster and Smarter. Many of us feel overwhelmed by the
amount of reading material that we must wade through. Hands-on learning and
practical techniques increase reading comprehension, concentration, and recall,
and speed work with all types of reading materials, including academic, pleasure,
technical, and business. Students spend less time re-reading material, expand their
vocabulary, and develop the skills needed to read faster and smarter. 1 unit, Leslie
Townsend, lecturer. TTh 1:15 - 2:05 pm in Skilling 191.
CTL 118, Public Speaking. A practical approach to the art of public speaking,
students examine speech at the informal level, and look at impromptu and anec
dotal communication. Students sharpen their skills with the aid of videotape, texts
of famous speeches and participation in a final dinner program of speeches.
3 units, James Wagstaffe, lecturer. T 7:00 -10:00 pm in Meyer 124.
