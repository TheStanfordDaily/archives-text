## Slicing up Sears: the secret of Stanford's four-year (and counting) athletic dynasty 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Five years ago, nobody envi
sioned one school's dominance.
The Sears Cup was created in
1993 to reward the country's top
overall athletic program, and North
Carolina edged Stanford to take the
inaugural trophy. The following four
competitions, however, have estab
lished the Cardinal as the clear front
runner in college athletics.
None of the four most recent
races has been as hotly contested as
the first, and even changes to the
scoring system have not slowed
down Stanford.
How has a school more famous
for academics seized control of the
top spot in athletics?
Certainly enrollment can be
counted out, as Stanford has the
smallest student body of any school
in its primary league, the Pacific 10
Conference.
A firm commitment to women's
athletics often is cited as a top reason
for Cardinal dominance, but had
there been separate awards for men
and women the past two years, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
have had to think of an acceptance
speech for two additional crystal tro

phies. Last year, either Stanford sex
would have placed fifth against any
other schools' combined total.
The scoring system has never re
warded the so-called glamour sports;
football and field hockey are given
the same number of points.
Stanford benefits from counting
all sports equally, but the Cardinal's
emergence in men's basketball and
sustained excellence in baseball and
women's basketball proves that even
a weighted scoring system might not
be sufficient to topple Stanford.
Stanford has resources. Stanford
has loyal coaches. Stanford has moti

vated athletes who graduate. If suc
cess perpetuates success, as count
less dynasties in the NCAA through
the years have shown, then dethron
ing Stanford's Sears Cup reign could
prove to be an insurmountable task.
Five years, two coaching changes
When Rick Pitino took Kentucky
to the height of college men's bas
ketball, he vowed not to leave. The
Boston Celtics and their money
changed his mind.
When Mike Montgomery earned
universal praise for taking Stanford's
men's hoops team to the Final Four,
he stayed put. He even hired the
head coach of an occasional NCAA
tournament team, Montana, to come
to Stanford as his assistant.
Clearly, people want to coach at
Stanford.
Tennis coaches Dick Gould and
Frank Brennan and swimming
coaches Skip Kenney and Richard
Quick have enjoyed unparalleled
success at Stanford. Kenney and
Quick have coached the Olympic
team, as has women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer.
They have all chosen to stay put
rather than rebuild another pro
gram, or in VanDerveer's case, jump
to the pros.
Stanford has 16 varsity sports that
include men; not all of them are
counted in the Sears Cup standings.
Since the first Sears Cup season half
a decade ago, 14 of the original 16
teams have kept their leaders. Only
men's soccer coach Colin Lindores
and football coach Bill Walsh are
gone from the group, replaced by
Bobby Clark and Tyrone Willing
ham, respectively.
The women's picture is less re
markable, in part because Stanford
women's athletics have shown more
growth in the last five years. Softball
jumped to varsity status, received
funding, built its own field and found

a coach, John Rittman, who had en
joyed success on a Pac-10 level.
Women's water polo and lacrosse
also have become varsity sports and
have undergone coaching changes in
their early years. Nonetheless, they
all have made their mark on the na
tional scene even in their infancy.
Longevity and success can help
ease recruiting. The best high school
athletes in the country want to win in
college as well, and they want to play
at the highest level. They want to add
their names to the history books and
the lore that Stanford has accumulat
ed. Mark Marquess has a better
chance of obtaining top baseball play
ers than California's Bob Milano, and
Don Shaw has a better chance to at-

tract the women's prep volleyball
elite than any other program.
When recruits come to Stanford,
they can be fairly sure that they will
be led by the same people who re
cruited them. Plus, they realize that
Stanford is committed to both win
ning and helping athletes graduate.
The recruiting question
Stanford people love to say that
the Cardinal recruits well despite the
tough academic standards of the
University. Most of the mainstays in
the top five of the Sears Cup stand
ings, however, also can claim acade
mic supremacy.
North Carolina, Michigan and
UCLA all feature highly respected

academics; along with Stanford,
these schools have earned 16 of the
25 top-five spots in Sears Cup histo
ry. The elite schools may have a
smaller talent pool from which to se
lect recruits, but they seem to have a
far better chance to land the athletes
they want.
Because of its lofty academic
standards, Stanford can land moti
vated students who take success seri
ously. The Ivy League schools have
no athletic scholarships, leaving
Stanford as possibly the premier aca
demic institution to which an athlete
can earn a scholarship.
Finally, Stanford takes its so
called non-revenue sports seriously.

Synchronized swimming will never
get the funding per athlete that foot
ball does, but its national champi
onship was celebrated in a rally for
Spring Break athletic success just
like men's basketball. Non-revenue
does not equal non-prestige, and
Stanford cherishes its tennis national
titles like others trumpet their foot
ball crowns.
At Stanford, the Athletics De
partment's success is not measured
solely by the football team's record,
and that is clearly not the case at
many other schools.
Fortunately, Stanford boosters
have not displayed a "win-at-all
costs" mentality that benefits rev
enue sports at the expense of the rest
of the squads.

Non-football recruits definitely
take notice of a department that cares
about their success, and what athlete
in any sport (even in one that enjoys
limited success at Stanford) would
not want to be part of the "nation's
most successful athletic program?"
Supportive alumni
Endowed scholarships are the
heart of the Athletics Department.
While Stanford has a smaller alumni
base than other schools, Stanford
graduates have money. Further, they
do not want to put all their money
into football and men's basketball.
With well-rounded funding, Stan
ford has a huge edge over many
schools in sports that Stanford tradi-

tionally dominates.
Tara VanDerveer commands a
much larger salary than other
women's basketball coaches in the
Pac-10, and Dick Gould and Frank
Brennan can boast of a beautiful new
tennis facility that other schools
could never match.
Without alumni support, a 33-
sport varsity program would clearly
be impossible to maintain. Stanford
has gradually been able to bolster its
younger programs such as softball.
Success in traditionally strong sports
has helped realize success in devel
oping sports as well.
The right location to succeed
Stanford could not be in a better
location for athletic success. Water

sports and traditionally outdoor
sports thrive in the good weather of
the Pacific Coast, and Stanford's
dominance in water polo, swimming,
volleyball and tennis benefits from
the sunny locale. And baseball does
not have to wait until March to begin
play because of snow.
However, competition, not
weather, helps ensure athletic suc
cess. Six of the top 12 teams in the
most recent Sears Cup race hailed
from the Pac-10.
Stanford needs to excel through
out its regular seasons to even quali
fy for the national champi
onships.When the Cardinal and
other Pac-10 teams reach the nation
al stage, they are more tested and
used to pressure than most other
squads. Year in and year out, the Pac
-10 produces more national champi
ons than any other conference.
How can Stanford be dethroned?
Stanford has become a school
where one program's temporary
demise (for example, men's gymnas
tics, which won three recent national
championships before struggling the
past couple of years) can be over
shadowed by two programs' emer
gence (for example, men's and
women's cross country, which won
its first three national titles the last
two years).
While Stanford won just two na
tional titles in 1994-95, it cruised to
its first win in the Sears Cup because
most of its programs finished strong
anyway.
Under the old Sears Cup scoring
system, two 32nd-place finishes
could be worth more than one first
place finish. Now, final-four finishes
are given much more weight. Two
fifth-place finishes are not even
worth one top finish now.
Because Stanford almost never
fails to reach the national semifinals
in men's and women's tennis, men's

and women's swimming, or women's
volleyball, the Cardinal can amass
guaranteed points that other schools
cannot. The new scoring system ben
efits Stanford more than the compe
tition it was supposed to help.
Stanford won the 1997-98 Sears
Cup by 350 points â€” the equivalent
of 3 1/2 national titles. The women's
basketball team lost in the first round
of the NCAA tournament, and the
baseball team failed to finish in the
top 20 with a late-season slide, costing
points that Stanford took for granted.
The men's volleyball team would
have scored 100 points more had it
duplicated its national championship
year of 1996-97; instead, it was shut
out. Stanford still totaled 50 percent
more points than North Carolina or
Florida, its nearest competitors.
Unless sports become ranked by

supposed prestige (giving football
five times more points than swim
ming and swimming twice as many
points as fencing), Stanford should
continue its dominance of the Sears
Cup.
Even in that scenario, men's bas
ketball has emerged, baseball and
women's basketball are perennial
contenders and football has made a
bowl game two of the last three
years.
Ted Leland should be able to rest
comfortably for the foreseeable fu
ture, as long as he keeps thinking of
new acceptance speeches.

there been separate awards for men
and women the past two years, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
have had to think of an acceptance
speech for two additional crystal tro

phies. Last year, either Stanford sex
would have placed fifth against any
other schools' combined total.
The scoring system has never re
warded the so-called glamour sports;
football and field hockey are given
the same number of points.
Stanford benefits from counting
all sports equally, but the Cardinal's
emergence in men's basketball and
sustained excellence in baseball and
women's basketball proves that even
a weighted scoring system might not
be sufficient to topple Stanford.
Stanford has resources. Stanford
has loyal coaches. Stanford has moti

vated athletes who graduate. If suc
cess perpetuates success, as count
less dynasties in the NCAA through
the years have shown, then dethron
ing Stanford's Sears Cup reign could
prove to be an insurmountable task.
Five years, two coaching changes
When Rick Pitino took Kentucky
to the height of college men's bas
ketball, he vowed not to leave. The
Boston Celtics and their money
changed his mind.
When Mike Montgomery earned
universal praise for taking Stanford's
men's hoops team to the Final Four,
he stayed put. He even hired the
head coach of an occasional NCAA
tournament team, Montana, to come
to Stanford as his assistant.
Clearly, people want to coach at
Stanford.
Tennis coaches Dick Gould and
Frank Brennan and swimming
coaches Skip Kenney and Richard
Quick have enjoyed unparalleled
success at Stanford. Kenney and
Quick have coached the Olympic
team, as has women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer.
They have all chosen to stay put
rather than rebuild another pro
gram, or in VanDerveer's case, jump
to the pros.
Stanford has 16 varsity sports that
include men; not all of them are
counted in the Sears Cup standings.
Since the first Sears Cup season half
a decade ago, 14 of the original 16
teams have kept their leaders. Only
men's soccer coach Colin Lindores
and football coach Bill Walsh are
gone from the group, replaced by
Bobby Clark and Tyrone Willing
ham, respectively.
The women's picture is less re
markable, in part because Stanford
women's athletics have shown more
growth in the last five years. Softball
jumped to varsity status, received
funding, built its own field and found

a coach, John Rittman, who had en
joyed success on a Pac-10 level.
Women's water polo and lacrosse
also have become varsity sports and
have undergone coaching changes in
their early years. Nonetheless, they
all have made their mark on the na
tional scene even in their infancy.
Longevity and success can help
ease recruiting. The best high school
athletes in the country want to win in
college as well, and they want to play
at the highest level. They want to add
their names to the history books and
the lore that Stanford has accumulat
ed. Mark Marquess has a better
chance of obtaining top baseball play
ers than California's Bob Milano, and
Don Shaw has a better chance to at-

tract the women's prep volleyball
elite than any other program.
When recruits come to Stanford,
they can be fairly sure that they will
be led by the same people who re
cruited them. Plus, they realize that
Stanford is committed to both win
ning and helping athletes graduate.
The recruiting question
Stanford people love to say that
the Cardinal recruits well despite the
tough academic standards of the
University. Most of the mainstays in
the top five of the Sears Cup stand
ings, however, also can claim acade
mic supremacy.
North Carolina, Michigan and
UCLA all feature highly respected

academics; along with Stanford,
these schools have earned 16 of the
25 top-five spots in Sears Cup histo
ry. The elite schools may have a
smaller talent pool from which to se
lect recruits, but they seem to have a
far better chance to land the athletes
they want.
Because of its lofty academic
standards, Stanford can land moti
vated students who take success seri
ously. The Ivy League schools have
no athletic scholarships, leaving
Stanford as possibly the premier aca
demic institution to which an athlete
can earn a scholarship.
Finally, Stanford takes its so
called non-revenue sports seriously.

Synchronized swimming will never
get the funding per athlete that foot
ball does, but its national champi
onship was celebrated in a rally for
Spring Break athletic success just
like men's basketball. Non-revenue
does not equal non-prestige, and
Stanford cherishes its tennis national
titles like others trumpet their foot
ball crowns.
At Stanford, the Athletics De
partment's success is not measured
solely by the football team's record,
and that is clearly not the case at
many other schools.
Fortunately, Stanford boosters
have not displayed a "win-at-all
costs" mentality that benefits rev
enue sports at the expense of the rest
of the squads.

Non-football recruits definitely
take notice of a department that cares
about their success, and what athlete
in any sport (even in one that enjoys
limited success at Stanford) would
not want to be part of the "nation's
most successful athletic program?"
Supportive alumni
Endowed scholarships are the
heart of the Athletics Department.
While Stanford has a smaller alumni
base than other schools, Stanford
graduates have money. Further, they
do not want to put all their money
into football and men's basketball.
With well-rounded funding, Stan
ford has a huge edge over many
schools in sports that Stanford tradi-

tionally dominates.
Tara VanDerveer commands a
much larger salary than other
women's basketball coaches in the
Pac-10, and Dick Gould and Frank
Brennan can boast of a beautiful new
tennis facility that other schools
could never match.
Without alumni support, a 33-
sport varsity program would clearly
be impossible to maintain. Stanford
has gradually been able to bolster its
younger programs such as softball.
Success in traditionally strong sports
has helped realize success in devel
oping sports as well.
The right location to succeed
Stanford could not be in a better
location for athletic success. Water

sports and traditionally outdoor
sports thrive in the good weather of
the Pacific Coast, and Stanford's
dominance in water polo, swimming,
volleyball and tennis benefits from
the sunny locale. And baseball does
not have to wait until March to begin
play because of snow.
However, competition, not
weather, helps ensure athletic suc
cess. Six of the top 12 teams in the
most recent Sears Cup race hailed
from the Pac-10.
Stanford needs to excel through
out its regular seasons to even quali
fy for the national champi
onships.When the Cardinal and
other Pac-10 teams reach the nation
al stage, they are more tested and
used to pressure than most other
squads. Year in and year out, the Pac
-10 produces more national champi
ons than any other conference.
How can Stanford be dethroned?
Stanford has become a school
where one program's temporary
demise (for example, men's gymnas
tics, which won three recent national
championships before struggling the
past couple of years) can be over
shadowed by two programs' emer
gence (for example, men's and
women's cross country, which won
its first three national titles the last
two years).
While Stanford won just two na
tional titles in 1994-95, it cruised to
its first win in the Sears Cup because
most of its programs finished strong
anyway.
Under the old Sears Cup scoring
system, two 32nd-place finishes
could be worth more than one first
place finish. Now, final-four finishes
are given much more weight. Two
fifth-place finishes are not even
worth one top finish now.
Because Stanford almost never
fails to reach the national semifinals
in men's and women's tennis, men's

and women's swimming, or women's
volleyball, the Cardinal can amass
guaranteed points that other schools
cannot. The new scoring system ben
efits Stanford more than the compe
tition it was supposed to help.
Stanford won the 1997-98 Sears
Cup by 350 points â€” the equivalent
of 3 1/2 national titles. The women's
basketball team lost in the first round
of the NCAA tournament, and the
baseball team failed to finish in the
top 20 with a late-season slide, costing
points that Stanford took for granted.
The men's volleyball team would
have scored 100 points more had it
duplicated its national championship
year of 1996-97; instead, it was shut
out. Stanford still totaled 50 percent
more points than North Carolina or
Florida, its nearest competitors.
Unless sports become ranked by

supposed prestige (giving football
five times more points than swim
ming and swimming twice as many
points as fencing), Stanford should
continue its dominance of the Sears
Cup.
Even in that scenario, men's bas
ketball has emerged, baseball and
women's basketball are perennial
contenders and football has made a
bowl game two of the last three
years.
Ted Leland should be able to rest
comfortably for the foreseeable fu
ture, as long as he keeps thinking of
new acceptance speeches.

Former managing editor Jeremy
Stone, '9S, will forever be the godfa
ther of Daily sports.






Five years ago, nobody envi
sioned one school's dominance.
The Sears Cup was created in
1993 to reward the country's top
overall athletic program, and North
Carolina edged Stanford to take the
inaugural trophy. The following four
competitions, however, have estab
lished the Cardinal as the clear front
runner in college athletics.
None of the four most recent
races has been as hotly contested as
the first, and even changes to the
scoring system have not slowed
down Stanford.
How has a school more famous
for academics seized control of the
top spot in athletics?
Certainly enrollment can be
counted out, as Stanford has the
smallest student body of any school
in its primary league, the Pacific 10
Conference.
A firm commitment to women's
athletics often is cited as a top reason
for Cardinal dominance, but had
there been separate awards for men
and women the past two years, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland would
have had to think of an acceptance
speech for two additional crystal tro

phies. Last year, either Stanford sex
