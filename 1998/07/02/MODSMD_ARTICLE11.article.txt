## Top recruits bring title dreams to fencers 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
When head coach Zoran Tulum
first came to the Stanford fencing
program in 1987, he recruited more
than 80 percent of his athletes from
physical education classes. The Card
had to fight for every win.
Today, Stanford fencing is a com
pletely different program. Tulum's
fencers are renowned throughout the
nation not only as top NCAA con
tenders, but also as some of the best
American fencers of their generation.
Now, with the added talent of the
year's two top-recruited fencers,
Stanford fencing may finally have
what it takes to win the national title
that has eluded the team through
out its history.
Last year, after blowing through
the West Region and qualifying nine
out of a possible 10 athletes for the
NCAA Championships, Stanford
finished third in the nation.
Senior Felicia Zimmermann won
the individual title for women's foil.
Seven of the nine Stanford con
tenders were named Ail-Americans.
But the lack of a 10th NCAA qualifi
er in the saber division put the na
tional title just out of reach.
Yet 1998 has been Tulum's best
recruiting season since he came to
Stanford. He has brought in the top
recruited saberman in the nation,
David LaValle. and German world

champion foilist Felix Reichling.
LaValle is more than capable of
beating any saberman in the nation.
He has bested every top saber con
tender in the NCAA at some point in
his fencing career. He is also a fa
vorite for the NCAA individual title
in men's saber.
But LaValle's value is much
greater than his potential individual
success. Before LaValle, Stanford
has never had a strong saber squad.
Last year, only one Stanford saber
man, then-senior Sasha Zucker,
qualified for NCAAs.
That means Stanford gave away
24 points to its competitors at the
championships. Stanford lost the na
tional title by 21 points.
LaValle should be able to pick up
that slack and help his saber team
mates improve. Fencers must face
high-caliber competition to sharpen
their edge.
"I am looking forward to helping
build Stanford's saber program,"
LaValle said. "Competition is great
and it is the only way to focus skills."
Reichling is ranked higher inter
nationally than any college fencer.
He is confident that he can win the
NCAA individual title in men's foil.
Reichling, along with nationally
top-ranked fencers senior Tim
Chang and junior Alex Wood,
should make Stanford a dominating
presence in NCAA men's foil.

Impressive credentials
An international fencing sensation,
Reichling comes to Stanford from
Bonn, Germany, where fencing, ac
cording to him, is a learned tradition.
The 21-year-old attends the Bonn
Fencing Boarding School, where he
breathes the sport day in and day out.
His parents started both Reich
ling and his brother fencing in 1989
when looking for a sport in which
the brothers could both excel. To
say that Reichling has merely ex
celled is an understatement.
His fencing success goes back to
1995, when he finished third at the
Junior World Cup. In 1997, he was
on the victorious team at the Junior
World Team Championships.
That year, he became the Junior
World Cup Champion and the indi
vidual Junior World Champion in
foil. Hs success continued in 1997
when he won the German Interna
tional Championship, senior division.
LaValle was trained at the
New York Athletic Club in New
York City, one of the havens for
saber in the United States. He
studied under a fencing legend,
1983 Bulgarian world champion
Bavassil Etropolski.
LaValle attended his first Junior
Olympics at the young age of 10. In
1995, he became the first 14-year-old
to win three medals in the USFA Ju
nior Olympics. In 1997, he was

named to the under-20 and under-17
national teams. Both teams only
take the top three fencers in that age
and weapons category.
He was named to the cadet national
team in both 1995 and 19%. In 1997, he
was the national under-17 champion.
Despite such athletic success,
both fencers are about more than
just their sport.
LaValle is a graduate of Xavier
Jesuit School, one of New York
City's elite private schools. Under
the influence of his father, a re
tired lieutenant colonel in the U.S.
Army, LaValle has been highly ac
tive in JROTC and will continue
in the ROTC program at Stanford.
"I chose Stanford because it has
the best academics, a diverse campus,
amazing opportunities, as well as a
great fencing program," LaValle said.
"I want to be exposed to new ideas
and a culture beyond New York City
which is its own distinct culture."
Reichling shares many similar
ities with LaValle. Reichling
served in the German military for
10 months. He also chose Stan
ford for its combination of acade
mics and athletics.
"When I go back to Germany, I
will need to have an education from
a school with a strong reputation,"
Reichling said. "The Stanford repu
tation will help me."

Beyond German and English,
Reichling's linguistic skills also in
clude French.
Both athletes are interested in
majoring in economics. Look for
them in Prof. John Taylor's Eco
nomics 1 lecture in the fall.
Recruiting prowess
Tulum has not only improved
Stanford fencing, he has given it a
completely new image. Cardinal fenc
ing is about to get a whole lot stronger.
The coach would have had the
nation's top four fencing recruits,
including a saberman who ended
up at rival Notre Dame and a fe
male epee fencer who headed for
defending national champion
Penn State, if not for the admis
sion obstacles.
What makes Tulum such a suc
cessful recruiter in light of Stanford's
high academic requirements?
Perhaps LaValle has the answer.
"I trust my relationship with Zoran.
He is always there. He is not too
overbearing, and he is very personal.
After meeting him, I was sold."
This could be the breakthrough
year for Stanford fencing. Tulum, as
well as many of the Stanford fencers,
believe that this is the year when the
Cardinal will win its first NCAA ring.
"Silver sucks," T ulum said. "Gold
is the only thing that counts."

10 months. He also chose Stan
ford for its combination of acade
mics and athletics.
"When I go back to Germany, I
will need to have an education from
a school with a strong reputation,"
Reichling said. "The Stanford repu
tation will help me."

Beyond German and English,
Reichling's linguistic skills also in
clude French.
Both athletes are interested in
majoring in economics. Look for
them in Prof. John Taylor's Eco
nomics 1 lecture in the fall.
Recruiting prowess
Tulum has not only improved
Stanford fencing, he has given it a
completely new image. Cardinal fenc
ing is about to get a whole lot stronger.
The coach would have had the
nation's top four fencing recruits,
including a saberman who ended
up at rival Notre Dame and a fe
male epee fencer who headed for
defending national champion
Penn State, if not for the admis
sion obstacles.
What makes Tulum such a suc
cessful recruiter in light of Stanford's
high academic requirements?
Perhaps LaValle has the answer.
"I trust my relationship with Zoran.
He is always there. He is not too
overbearing, and he is very personal.
After meeting him, I was sold."
This could be the breakthrough
year for Stanford fencing. Tulum, as
well as many of the Stanford fencers,
believe that this is the year when the
Cardinal will win its first NCAA ring.
"Silver sucks," T ulum said. "Gold
is the only thing that counts."
