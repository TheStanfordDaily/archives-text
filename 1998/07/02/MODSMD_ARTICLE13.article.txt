## 'Armageddon' in time for Independence Day 
### 
Try to recall two summers ago. There was a movie that made
you remember how proud you felt to be an American. You
cheered when Will Smith, a.k.a. "Dumbo," kicked an alien in
the desert. A tear welled in your eyes when Bill Pullman fdeliv
ered his heart wrenching speech. Well, get ready for "Indepen
dence Day" all over again in this summer's "Armageddon."
NASA Director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) dis
covers an asteroid the "size of Texas" headed for Earth. He
employs the help of expert oil driller Harry S. Stamper (Bruce
Willis) who insists on bringing his crew (Ben Affleck, Steve
Buscemi and Owen Wilson) to stop the asteroid. In less than
two weeks, they have to become astronauts, fly to the asteroid,

drill a hole 800 feet deep and detonate a nuclear warhead in
side of it. In the meantime, Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler) is in the
NASA control center cheering and crying for her dad, Harry
and her new fiancee, A.J. Frost (Affleck).
Does this seem a little too much like "Deep Impact?" Good
point. Granted, these movies do follow the same story line. How
ever, the plot of "Armageddon" is much deeper, with more char
acter development and better special effects. The asteroid scenes
and city destruction sequences will be copied for years to come.
And the cast is nothing short of excellent. There are a few
slow points toward the beginning. But trust me, you will be
clenching the arm rests shortly thereafter and screaming at

your bladder halfway through. Bruce Willis, always a gamble
these days, pulls off the lead, while Thornton and Affleck are
also solid. Steve Buscemi provides the humor and Liv Tyler
(you were wondering why Aerosmith is plastered all over this
soundtrack) adds the beauty.
So make your plans now. Skip that barbecue where you will
be bored with Uncle Leroy's fishing stories and sickened by
Grandma Virginia's pork and beans. Instead, celebrate the 4th
with "Armageddon." Then go set off those Roman candles.
