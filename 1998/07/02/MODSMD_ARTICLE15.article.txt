Hardly Wait?"

Are we doomed to remember high school in the '90s
through a movie starring another Noxzema-skin beauty
whose acting experience to date is a couple of cheesy
horror flicks and a television show that seems to domi
nate our lives every Wednesday night?
As a matter of fact, we are. And trust me, it's a good thing.
"Can't Hardly Wait" from writers and first-time di
rectors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont is a refresh
ing, witty take on high school. It follows the Class of '98

at the fictional Huntington Hills High School. They gath
er together the night after graduation at the most talked
about party of the year. It's a night to never forget, or for
some, to never remember.

The story centers around Preston Meyers (Ethan
Embry) who has had a crush on Amanda Beckett (Jen
nifer Love Hewitt) for years. Preston has never gotten a
chance to profess his love because Amanda has been dat
ing football stud and jerk Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli)
for the past four years.
Lucky for Preston, on this particular night, the stars
have aligned just right and the moon is eclipsing Venus
and Pluto. The unthinkable has occurred — the high

school sweethearts have broken up!
Tonight offers an opportunity for
Preston and everybody else. The class
nerd William Lichter (Charlie Ko
rsmo) vows to take sweet revenge on
Dexter. Sporting a love-machine
backpack and dreads, Kenny Fisher
(Seth Green) pledges to have sex.
Overall, the cast does a great job.
To the dismay of the 1(X) guys in the
audience who screamed when Jen
nifer Love Hewitt's name rolled
across the screen, she shares much
screen time with Lauren Ambrose,
Seth Green and Ethan Embry, who all
play their roles to perfection.
Prepare yourself for a lot of laughs
and a lot of memories of high school
that you probably would liked to have
forgotten by now.
