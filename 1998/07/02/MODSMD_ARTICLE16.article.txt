# A.C.T.'s 'Old Times'

### Elizabeth Khuri-Yakub 
"Old Times" at the American
Conservatory Theater in San Fran
cisco is a delicious theatrical cocktail
with a light dose of witty conversa
tion and undercurrents of deep
philosophical meaning.
Both of the play's two acts take
place in the living room of Deely and
Kate, a married couple living in the
English countryside. Their life is dis
rupted when Anna, a mysterious and
alluring woman suddenly appears.
Is she the wife's former lover, the
husband's, or both? Or is she a fig
ment of their imagination?
Throughout the play the menage
a trois reminisce about the postwar
days in London, and the play flows
from memory to reality.
Deely, with his unruly hair, re
sembles the bumbling Hugh Grant.
But unlike Grant, he exudes a fierce
sexuality and deep emotion that sur
passes Grant's quirky confusion.
Deely moves from being a caustic
husband at the start of the play to
being a sobbing confused man.
The effusive and loony Anna
took a bit getting used to. Anna
slowly changes Deely and Kate's
world with her breathy voice and
subtle digs at Kate. But she is capti

vating, and the energy of the theater
is immediately drawn to her volatile
personality. Her short hair and
inviting body language add depth to
the subplots that eddy beneath the
surface dialogue.
Kate (Michelle Morain) is also a
master of body language. She skims
across the stage almost lighter than
air. She creates the perception of a
woman whose mind is not only in the
clouds but whose whole being seems
to be on the verge of flight.
The part is less prominent than
that of Deely and Anna because she
is only supposed to be half-real, but
she fleshes out this quality in every
aspect of her being.
"Old Times" is the rare play that
approaches real issues with light and
witty means, but achieves profound
and poignant results.
