# Pure Sugar
## 
### 
With the return of bell-bottoms and
comeback performances from groups
like the Bee Gees and Fleetwood Mac, it
seems like the '70s are dancing their way back
into the music scene. But groups like Pure
Sugar aren't just copying the old styles;
they're taking those funky disco jives and
modifying them for the times.
On its self-titled album. Pure Sugar reach
es into disco, funk, techno, and a bit of soul, to
bring out a hip, creative sound from the
trenches.
Setting its tunes to a driving techno beat,
this upbeat band powers through the music in

club-hopping style. Lead vocalist Jen
nifer Starr steps up with strong vocals
hinting of a warped Bette Midler-Tina
Turner love child. The rest of the band
backs with speedy backbeats and elec
tronic effects.
"I'm artistically fueled by sexual
energy," Starr has claimed. "I want
people to hear Pure Sugar and walk
away with a sexual sensation."
People should definitely walk
away from this music with some sort
of sensation.
The album opens with "Deli
cious," a playful but repetitive tune
which, like most dance music, lacks a
bit in lyrics but compensates in
danceability.

In other songs, like "Hands to Heaven" and
"Slave To My Feelings," the group continues
its dance-pop ramblings, but mixes the fast
paced rhythms with slower, jazzy sections.
The group slows things down even more
on "Sunshine" and "No More Words" for a
set of soulful tunes amid the crazed dance
mixes.
The creative talents of Pure Sugar, com
bined with its raw energy and power, make
for a surprisingly well-rounded and enjoyable
album. For the dance-techno enthusiast, this
is a don't-miss.
