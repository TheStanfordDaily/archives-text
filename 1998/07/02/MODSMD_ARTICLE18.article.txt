# 'Temmes Fatales' finale tonight
## The
						SF Opera summer repertory concludes with "Carmen" 
### Benjamin N. Lawrance 
Carmen is the archetypal manipulator â€” a temptress,
a siren, a femme fatale. This summer, she joins Poppea
and Lulu in an extraordinary lineup of feisty feminine op
eras at the San Francisco Opera House.
Under the artistic direction of Lofti Mansouri, the
San Francisco Opera has crafted a melodramatic and
compelling ensemble of femme fatale operas in its
summer offering.

Monteverdi's "L'lncoronazione di Poppea," Bizet's
"Carmen," and Berg's "Lulu" span the breadth of the op
eratic genre, from its inception in Renaissance Italy,
through the triumphalism of 19th century nationalist Eu
rope. to the traumatic horrors of the mid-2()th century.
For the novice, each piece offers a unique entrance
into the spectacular theatrics of opera. For the more sea
soned opera-goer, the new production of "Poppea" com
bines the superb directing team of Alden and Perdziola
with charismatic acting. Denyce Graves added new life to
the revival of "Carmen." Lappalainen and von Stade
were a convincing and lusty couple in "Lulu."
"Carmen" plays one final time this evening. Howev
er, if you have had the poor fortune to miss most of the
summer season, the femmes fatales merely foreshadow
a very exciting 1998/99 repertoire in the War Memorial
Opera House.
Puccini's "Turandot" and Strauss' "Arabella" open
the season in September. And with Isolde. Manon.
Norma and Madame Butterfly in the wings, the season
is shaping up to be a sensitive and intuitive exploration
of feminine power within opera.
