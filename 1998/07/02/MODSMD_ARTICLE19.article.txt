# Corey Glover's debut
## On his own after Living Colour 
### 
The band Living Colour was a trail blazer
in the late '80s, mixing soul and metal,
funk and rock, all before the alternative
movement made such things fashionable.
However, most people still saw the group as
"that black rock band." This is a shame since
it put out three great (though overlooked)
albums before it disbanded in 1995.
Lead singer Corey Glover was a large
part of Living Colour's appeal, and now he
makes his solo debut with the album,

"Hymns." The album is quite a change
from Living Colour; only the opening song
and single, "Do You First, Then Do My
self," has the metal crunch of Living Colour.
Additionally, the album is not nearly as po
litically charged as those of his former band.
Most of the songs are soulful love ballads.
That's not to say that the album isn't var
ied. As in the past, Glover goes through a
few genres in the album. The problem is that
most people will be able to tell just where

each song came from. Echoes of
Prince and A 1 Green pervade the
record, along with Jimi Hendrix.
Little Richard and George Michael.
Talented company, to be sure, but
one would expect more originality
from the former frontman.
The good news is that there's not a
dud on the album. Corey Glover
has not lost his touch â€” let's just
hope that by his next album he finds
his direction.
