## Matt Spence: Washington, D.C. A 						dark alliance Finding the CIA-pasta connection 
### 
THE CIA AND macaroni and
cheese don't have much in
common, unless you're an in
tern in Washington, D.C.
A summer in Washington, D.C.
marks a rite of passage for the aspir
rig Stanford politico. It usually goes
something like this — come to the
nation's capital, experience city life
beyond Palo Alto and add the name
of the senator or congressman of
your choice to your resume.
But so far my time in Washington
has been an entirely different story. I
have learned some very important
lessons about life outside of Stanford
— from two unlikely sources.
The CIA
Last Wednesday, I donned an ill
fitting pinstripe suit and got ready
for my intership at the National Se
curity Council. But when I called the
office, I found that I was all dressed
up with no place to go. The CIA
would not let me report to work.
The Security Council, the formal
foreign policy arm of the White
House, requires full background in
vestigations of all employees to de
termine if they pose a threat to the
U.S. government.
In its four month extensive check,
the U.S. government had encoun
tered difficulties with me. After hav
sent FBI agents from four cities
to question my roommate, girlfriend
and high school guidance counselor,
the matter had been referred to the
Central Intelligence Agency. And
the CIA needed more time.
It's difficult to imagine what
caused the trouble. Most of my
friends were happy to tell them that
I'm a bland person who doesn't
cause trouble (which, especially
coming from my girlfriend, hurt just
a little bit). Perhaps, the CIA was
afraid I wouldn't keep my job if I
didn't keep my promises.
It was a slightly humiliating expe
rience to explain to my parents that I
was unemployed for a week, even
though I was working for free. For
five days, I called the office in vain to
see if I could come to work.
Last Wednesday, I got in. My Top
Secret security clearance now allows
me to answer phones, make copies
and get soda for our nation's leaders
without "seriously damaging the na
tional security interests of the Unit
ed States." I could tell you more . but
then I'd have to kill you.
The moral of the story — the in
ternship experience is secondary to
the D.C. experience. Whether

you're at the White House or Pub
lisher's Clearing House, you are still
an undergraduate working a two
month temp job. Compared to the
paid employees who have been
there for years, you're not going any
where on the corporate ladder.
The biggest lesson of the week,
however, was unrelated to work.
Macaroni and cheese
Four guys in a Georgetown town
house promised big things, at least in
culinary terms. None of us really
knew how to cook, but I figured that
without too much work we'd at least
eat better than at Stern Dining.
The first shopping trip brought
trouble, when one of my roommates
became insane. To protect his
anonymity, let's call him "Ariel."
It is difficult to describe the trans
formation that occurs when your av
erage Stanford guy encounters Safe
way double coupons and a new
found desire to become domestic.
Ariel felt a special kind of power
rolling around Safeway with control
of the shopping cart. He barked at us
to get skim milk, low-fat turkey and,
of course, Tupperware for leftovers.
"Did you get the beans?" he
pleaded with great distress. "I told
you to get the beans. Would you
please not get junk food? How are we
going to make tacos without beans?"
Before long, we began attracting
an audience. Ariel had found maca
roni and cheese on sale. When
"Stephen" and"I" attempted to per
suade Ariel that we did not want 15
boxes of cheap pasta, even if they
were on Safeway Club special, Ariel
became militant. It was difficult to
resist his motherly charm, so we gave
in — macaroni it would be.
Honestly, I enjoy macaroni and
cheese. After a week of it, I've be
come quite a connoisseur. But I
think I'm ready to move on to TV
dinners and sandwiches.
Yet another important lesson —
you cannot avoid becoming domes
tic when you're truly on your own,
even if you're living with three other
guys. As much as I like having a hot
dinner waiting for me when I come
home, it's disturbing how quickly we
became domesticated. It's a sad day
when we feel compelled to buy the
Sunday paper ... for the coupons.

Despite flunking the Weekly back
ground check, Matt Spence, a junior
majoring in political science and
economics, will earn more for this
column than his entire internship.
