# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Star-spangled questioning 
### 
IN McMINNVILLE, ORE., and
most small towns in the United
States that have high school
football teams, Friday nights in the
fall officially begin with the Star
Spangled Banner.
"You can screw up any other
song tonight," the pep band director
would tell us as we prepared to
Honor America, "but not this one.
Everyone out there knows exactly
how it goes."
We know it because we sing it,
play it, hear it, at every sporting
event and important government
function of our American lives.
We should be tired of the nation
al anthem by now.
For some reason, I'm not. I still
stand before every ball game, place
my hat over my heart and mouth the
words (out of respect to both the
song and the people around me). It's
a routine I've followed since Little
League, when my team — a group of
kids who sometimes forgot to drop
the bat running to first base — al
ways remembered to line up before
the game, hats off, facing the flag.
I followed that routine at the Gi
ants' game Sunday. From my $6 seat
I was surprised to see more than a
dozen caps left in place while two
young music students added a tacky
harmony to "Oh say, can you see?" I
wanted to say something, but felt it

wasn't my place.
Charlie Scott never had that
reservation. A World War II veter
an, Charlie was an editor at the
McMinnville News-Register when I
was a high school intern. He proudly
tells the story of a long-ago baseball
game when a man standing next to
him wore his hat during the anthem.
Charlie asked him to remove it, and
the man refused.
Charlie then explained that he
had spent part of his life sleeping
under that flag in European trench
es, never knowing if he would live to
see the next night. "Take the hat
off," he said, "or I'll knock it off."
I thought about Charlie through
much of the game. I understood his
reverence for the national anthem,
but I was confused about mine. Hav
ing never fought in a war or even
lived through a major one, I can't
claim "rally around the flag" patrio
tism. Is my nationalism simple tradi
tion, passed down in the family like
grandma's beef stroganoff recipe?
Why do I remove my hat before
games, I wondered. Am I honoring
my country or following a pattern of
learned behavior?
Soccer gave me the answer.
For the past tlwee weeks, I have
been consumed by the World Cup.
Watch the early match at breakfast.
Break away from the office for the

afternoon game. Highlights in the
evening. Not usually a soccer fan, I
find myself deeply engrossed in
matches between one-named men.
The game is beautiful, but I watch
for the fans. 1 listen for fans chanting
and revel in post-goal crowd celebra
tion shots. I admire the national spir
it that drives the entire Dutch section
to paint itself orange for games.
The World Cup typifies my kind
of patriotism, a love of country that is
not grounded in violence (English
fans excluded). It makes me realize
that I am patriotic by choice and not
by upbringing. I know this because I
am patriotic in a way that differs
from the"America is best" national
ism that pervades the country.
Nationalism for me is pride in the
people and places of the country I
call home. In that sense, I appreciate
pride in all countries, not just the
United States. Events like the World
Cup have the unique power of
pulling together all the political and
social factions in one nation in pur
suit of a common, peaceful goal.
That's a resolution that should
make people worldwide hold their
hats.

Junior Jim Tankersley is pleased to
have passed both Strategy, War and
Politics and Intermediate Soccer last
quarter.
