## Leases acquired for grad students 
### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
In an effort to ease
the graduate housing
crunch, the University

has implemented its first large-scale
plan io alleviate the problem.
Under recommendation of the
Graduate Student Council, the
ASSU Task Force on Graduate
Housing and the Graduate Housing
Advising Committee, the University
will provide subsidized off-campus
housing to approximately 150 con
tinuing graduate students who ap
plied for, but did not receive, hous
ing in the May housing Draw.
Using funds authorized by the
Provost's Office, the University has
secured off-campus leases at Oak
Creek Apartments in Palo Alto and
Sharon Green Apartments in Menlo
Park. Applicants for the subsidized
off-campus housing will be assigned
based on their first round Draw
numbers.
"I think this is a very good step for
them to take," said physics graduate
student Harris Shapiro, who is a
member of the Graduate Student
Council and chair of the ASSU Task
Force on Graduate Housing. "I
think it's a very promising start."
This year 736 graduate students
were denied housing in the Draw.
Last year, 704 graduate students
were left unhoused, whereas in 19%,
only 242 students were turned away
from the housing Draw.
"What we're finding is that more
people are applying [for on-campus
housing] because rents off-campus
are going up," said Housing Assign
ment Services Manager Kathleen
Bransfield.
Although many students will still
not have University-sponsored hous
ing come September, the new plan is
being greeted with a positive response.

"I'm thrilled," said biochemistry
doctoral student and Graduate
Housing Advising Committee Chair
Stephanie Toering. "We suggested
this in November and at the time
they said it would cost too much. It's
great to see that they've decided to
implement it."
Students and administrators have
been working throughout the year to
develop feasible solutions to the
housing situation.
"During fall and winter quarters,
we focused on finding solutions
using existing resources," said Vice
Provost of Student Affairs James
Montoya. "The results of this
spring's housing Draw reinforced
the severity of the housing issue and
led to funds being allocated by the
provost."
Funds for the program are not
part of the University's formal bud
get, but instead are coming from a set
of discretionary funds allocated for
new programs, according to Associ
ate Provost Ann Fletcher.
The University only has a two-year
deal with the apartment complexes.
Students assigned to off-campus
housing will sign a one-year lease with
an option to renew for another year.
According to Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy, after
two years, the Provost's Office may
decide to continue the program with
subsidies, or students wishing to stay
may have to enter into direct con
tracts with the apartment complexes
and revert to unsubsidized prices.
Costs for the subsidized unfur
nished apartments range from $400
to $600 a month per person plus cost
of utilities. There is an option to de
crease the cost slightly by adding an
additional person.
So far 77 graduate students have
been assigned to the 47 apartments
in the Oak Creek and Sharon Green
complexes for which the University

currently holds leases. The Universi
ty will be obtaining more leases as
they open up throughout the sum
mer. It has also been looking to
make similar arrangements with
other apartment complexes.
"The students who have been tak
ing places [in the apartments] have
been extremely appreciative," Brans
field said. "They've been really happy
that this has been an option for them."
"Our hope is that the subsidized
off-campus housing we are making
available will lessen the competition
for other more affordable apart
ments in the area," Montoya said.
The plan is part of the Universi
ty's efforts to address the growing
concern over the lack of on-campus
graduate housing.
Students have said that off-cam
pus housing rates are too high, and
that all students who want on-cam
pus housing should have it. Other
concerns involve the University's
"stuffing" of graduate housing,
which has created 260 new spaces by
converting one-room singles in
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memor
ial Hall into doubles and two-room
double apartments in Escondido
Village into triples.
Following the May midnight
housing rally in the Main Quad,
where over 1,000 graduate students
and their families gathered to voice
their concern about these issues, the
University has stepped up its efforts
to facilitate housing options for grad
uate students.
In addition to providing the 150
off-campus apartment spaces, the
University plans to build 475 new on
campus spaces by fall of 2000. The
new units will most likely take ad
vantage of existing areas between
buildings in Escondido Village. The
proposal is to be presented to the
Board of Trustees in October.
"Typically it takes three years for

this kind of thing," Bransfield said.
"For this to be up and running by fall
of 2(X)0 is fast."
"It's been a lot of hard work in a
short period of time," said Guy.
In addition to providing housing,
the University is also trying to help
students obtain their own housing.
Graduate stipends will be in
creased by 8 percent this fall to help
with rising costs, and Community
Housing Services will allow all inter
ested parties regardless of Stanford
affiliation to advertise housing for
free on its Web site. A loan fund is in
place to help students cover the cost
of security deposits and first and last
month rent requirements for off
campus housing. The University is
also encouraging faculty and com
munity members to rent rooms in
their houses to graduate students.
"I'm impressed with what they've
done so far," Shapiro said "but I

hope that they recognize that it is
only a partial solution and will keep
working towards the full solution."
According to Shapiro, the current
plan for building on-campus housing
as well as the off-campus situation
still "underestimates the demand for
housing by a factor of two. more like
three or four."
"[The off-campus program] is cer
tainly not going to solve the problem
entirely," Bransfield said, "and we
know that. We're very aware of that."
"They're really working on a
long-term solution." said Toering.
She said that in addition to the hous
ing to be constructed by fall of 2000,
the University has "intention to
build another 500 units
"There is no formal plan to go fur
ther than the first phase," Guy said.
"The question there is how much can
we afford."
