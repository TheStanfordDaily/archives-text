### Alex Tung Ritu Bhatanagar Editorial staff 
When the graduate housing crisis
erupted this spring, the University
was already in the process of im
proving graduate student services.
A Graduate Student Program
Board that plans social actvities is
already in place. The Graduate Stu
dent Welcoming and Accommoda
tions Team has been coordinating
the new off-campus housing pro
gram and an associate dean of stu
dents is being hired to assist with
graduate student issues

A new associate dean
Graduate student issues will fig
ure prominetly among the job de
scription of the new associate dean
of students who will be announced
within the next week.
The position will also involve
overseeing New Student Orienta
tion, the Office of Student Activities,
the Women's Center, the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, and Tresidder Meeting Services,
areas which were formerly handled
by Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Wais feels that the new post will
allow for greater attention to the
aforementioned areas while enabling

him to devote more time to the re
maining groups in his department.
"In restructuring areas in the
Dean of Student's office, we will
provide some relief in terms of span
of control," said Wais.
The search committee for the
new dean includes Chair Sally Dick
son, director of multicultural devel
opment, three graduate students,
three undergraduate students and
various staff members from the
graduate schools.
GSWAT
The Graduate Student Welcom
ing and Accommodations Team
met for the first time this spring, and

has been focusing its efforts on help
ing students obtain off-campus
housing.
Once the off-campus program in
Sharon Green and Oak Creek
Apartments is under control, the
group will focus its attention on cre
ating a Graduate Student Services
Center, according to Housing As
signment Services Manager Kath
leen Bransfield.
The Center will provide re
sources to assist new and continuing
graduate students with finding hous
ing, obtaining loans and looking for
outside funding.

Efforts already in place
Gathering students from every
graduate school. Student Activities
formed the Program Board e to help
create a more cohesive graduate
community through social events.
"Through social programming
we're hoping to engage the students
as a Stanford University communi
ty, instead of as their own separate
schools," Wais said.
The program board, under direc
tion of English doctoral student
Meta Jones, has been planning grad
uate student events including "Grad
night at the CoHo*' and last Friday's
"Summer in the Lvman Islands."
