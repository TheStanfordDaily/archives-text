Doctors from UCSF-Stanford Health Care and the Xian
Medical University in southern China held the first ever tele
conference between American and Chinese doctors on June
26 in which live interactive video via the Internet was used.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright referred to the new
technology as an "impressive achievement."
In this case, it allowed geographically distant physicians to
pool their experience and knowledge in order to improve the
quality of care their patients received.
The teleconference, facilitated by Sun Microsystems, coin
cided with President Bill Clinton's visit to China and estab
lished a new connection between the two countries in the field
of medicine. The physicians involved from UCSF-Stanford
Health Care were David Stevenson, Daniel Bernstein,
Joseph Kitterman and David Teitel.
The doctors discussed the condition of two seriously ill
Chinese children, a 12-year-old girl suffering from viral my
ocarditis, and a 1 1/2-week-old infant with brain damage re
sulting from complications at birth.
According to Bill Merz, web project editor with the Stan
ford School of Medicine, "It's almost as if you're putting Stan

ford and UCSF physicians in the same examination room with
doctors in Xian, China."
"I'm delighted to see how recent breakthroughs in Inter
net technologies can be harnessed to address basic human
needs. This is a clear example of how technology can be used
to improve the human condition," Merz said.
Stevenson, chief of neonatal and developmental medicine
at the School of Medicine added. "[The technology] extends
[doctors']... ability to communicate with their colleagues in
distant places."
It allows physicians to talk "literally face to face to our col
leagues" without the time and expense involved in travel,
Stevenson said.
The continuing development of the Internet makes video
teleconferencing increasingly practical. Sun's Healthcare In
dustry Manager Bruce Elder noted that there have been pre
vious video-conferencing telemedicine links and projects to
China using the Internet, but that "this is the first [teleconfer
ence] to combine the low cost Internet channel with the inter
active real-time video."
Possibly one of the most exciting aspects of this new tech
nology is that it "extends medical expertise to just about any
place where you can plug in a computer." Stevenson remarked.
