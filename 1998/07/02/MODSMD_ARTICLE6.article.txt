Halsted Holman, a professor at Stanford's Med
ical Immunology and Rheumatology Department, was recently
named a "Hero Overcoming Arthritis" by the National Arthritis
Foundation in a ceremony in Atlanta.
"I didn't know anything about [my nomination for the award]," said
Holman. "I certainly appreciate this recognition."
Holman was one of 50 individuals nationwide who were selected by
the Foundation to commemorate its 50th anniversary. The award was
given not only to those who have displayed courage in living with
arthritis, but also to those who have made significant contributions to
research on the disease.
Holman, who falls in the latter category, headed research on anti
nuclear autoantibodies. This allowed for the development of a basic di
agnostic test for rheumatic disease. Prior to Holman's work, autoim
munity was not recognized as a normal component of life, making
arthritis difficult to classify.
"This award is in recognition of his tremendous work and how he
has used his research to aid patients with arthritis," said Gretchen
Cavin, a representative of the Arthritis Foundation's Northern Cali
fornia chapter. "He has really contributed to the fight."
Currently, Holman and his colleagues are investigating methods to
better aid patients with arthritis, such as self-management care and
medical care practices. Holman believes that present health care sys
tems are designed to treat acute diseases, and that they prove to be in
adequate in the face of chronic diseases such as arthritis. He hopes to
provide reform by creating health service programs that are geared to
ward helping patients with chronic diseases.
"Our biggest task is to provide care and a better quality of life for pa
tients that already have rheumatic disease," said Holman. "The health
care system has not recognized the crucial role patients have in their own
self-management."
As a part of their ongoing efforts to improve health care for arthri
tis patients, Holman and his colleagues formed the Arthritis Founda
tion's Self-Help Course.
"People who learn how to deal with issues like pain and limited mobil
ity can manage their own problems, with appropriate medical help, much
more easily than when they depend only on the doctor," Holman said.
In addition to his present position in Stanford's Medical Depart
ment, Holman was also the program director of the Stanford Multi
purpose Arthritis Center at the Medical School from 1970 to 1996.
