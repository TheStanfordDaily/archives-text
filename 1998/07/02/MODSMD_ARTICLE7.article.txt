# Alums named White House fellows
## 
### James Buxbaum Contributing writer 
When told by a presidential assis
tant that "President Johnson is disap
pointed to find that most young peo
ple are not interested in how their na
tion is run," John Gardner, currently
a consulting professor at the School
of Education and a former Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare,
knew precisely how to respond.
He envisioned a White House
Fellowship program to give young
people the opportunity to experi
ence "first-hand how the govern
ment operated at the highest level."
"Professor Gardner is not only
the founder but a guiding light for
the program," said Jacqueline Jor
dan, the current White House Fel
lows program director.
Gardner's vision has today
evolved into America's most presti
gious public service fellowship. This
year, Stanford alumni Clara Shin,
Law School '98, Bruce McNamer,
JD / MBA '96 and Leela de Souza,
MBA '96 were among the group of
17 individuals recently selected as
White House fellows.
Shin, 27, is among the youngest of
the chosen White House fellows.
Prior to coming to Stanford, Shin
served as the nation's youngest
AmeriCorps officer and managed its
$25 million grant portfolio. Addi
tionally, she is the founder of Koso
mose, a journal for Asian-American
women, and is a leader in the Earth
Train program that educates young
community activists.
"I am excited to be named a fel
low because being a special assistant

to a cabinet member will give me a
good sense of what is going on in the
White House," Shin said.
Former White House Fellow and
Law Prof. Michael Klausner, whom
Shin consulted about the application
process, said of the program, "It was
a great way to get a relatively broad
and fairly deep view of how the ex
ecutive branch works in a short
amount of time."
Shin found Stanford professors
to be "extremely supportive."
Klausner said, "Each time she got
through one hurdle, I just congratu
lated her and told her what the next
one would be like."
In the long term Shin hopes to use
her Stanford law education and her
fellowship experience to "affect soci
etal change" and to spend her life
working in the public arena.
Like Shin, Bruce McNamer's pub
lic service accomplishments are ex
tensive. Before coming to Stanford
for his MBA and law degree, Mc-
Namer was a Peace Corps volunteer
in Paraguay. As a graduate student he
started MBAID, an organization that
arranges for American MBA tu
dents to travel abroad to advise busi
ness people in developing countries.
While at Stanford, McNamer also
founded "Start Up," a microlending
organization in East Palo Alto. He
continues to focus on community
public service by working as a leader
in the McKinsey and Co. community
outreach program.
De Souza is also a consultant for
McKinsey and Co., but she was orig
inally a professional ballet dancer.
Prior to attending Stanford, de
Souza danced for the Hubbard

Street Dance Company and taught
at the American School of Madrid.
"Because of my long running in
terest in ballet, I want to make an im
pact on the arts at the national level,"
de Souza said.
She is enthusiastic about the
White House Fellowship program.
"It provides a unique opportunity
for people to see decision making by
the federal government at a level
that would take 20 years of experi
ence to otherwise reach," de Souza
said. "White House fellows have the
opportunity to see the highest lead
ers make decisions, to learn how the
government operates, and can then
take their skills anywhere and make
a difference, whether in the arts or in
anything else."
De Souza's conception of the
program as teaching young people
how the government works paral
lels Gardner's original vision. He
noted that in modern America,
young people do not have the op
portunity to directly experience
government operations.
"As a young man, Thomas Jeffer
son could walk across the green to
the House of Burgesses and John
Adams could go to the Braintree
town meetings," Gardner said. "I
wanted to see a program that would
give young leaders the opportunity
to see how the nation was gov
erned."
Shin, McNamer and de Souza fol
low in the prominent footsteps of
former White House fellows such as
Colin Powell, CNN Chief Executive
Officer Tom Johnson and former
NBC Chairman Jane Cahill Pfeiffer.
