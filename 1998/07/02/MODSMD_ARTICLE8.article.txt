# Rodin Sculpture Garden receives facelift
## Summer reopening anticipates debut of the Cantor Center for the Visual Arts 
### Juno Nakamura Contributing writer 
Stanford's Rodin sculptures are part of this
summer's changing campus landscape.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden, which has
been closed to the public since September 1997
due to construction, will reopen in August.
"The configuration [of the Rodin Sculpture
Garden] is basically going to be the same," said
Barnard Barryte, curator and associate direc
tor of the Art Gallery and Stanford Art Muse
um. "But we will be installing the 'Three
Shades' above 'The Gates of Hell,' resurfacing
the Garden with decomposed granite on all ex
isting locations, replacing sculpture lighting
with modernized and technologically im
proved fixtures, replacing stone benches with
teak benches and installing new signage and
maps," Barryte said.
"There will also be an additional garden
area adjacent to the new 42,000-square-foot
wing [of the museum]," said Mona Duggan, as
sociate director of External Relations of the
Art Gallery and Stanford Art Museum.
The Willem de Kooning sculpture "Standing
Figure One," previously located in front of the
Medical Center, will be added to the new gar
den. The statue was lent on a long-term basis by
the Willem de Kooning Devocable Trust
through alumnus John Eastman. A work by the
San Francisco-born artist Richard Serra, on loan
from Doris and Donald Fisher, will also be in
stalled in this adjacent garden on Aug. 1.
Tours of the Rodin Sculpture Garden will
resume in September. "We are expecting thou
sands of visitors like always," said Jill Osaka,
publicity coordinator of the Art Gallery and
Stanford Art Museum.
Another Rodin masterpiece, "The Thinker"
has been absent from the front of Meyer Li
brary since May 28. The Rockefeller Center

borrowed it from Stanford to celebrate the es
tablishment's 70th anniversary. The statue is ex
pected to return to campus in mid-September.
Additionally, the six sculptures of "The
Burghers of Calais" that had been scattered
around campus were collected together in the
Memorial Court in time for Commencement.
Rodin had originally intended that the stat
ues be placed together as a tribute to the six cit
izens who promised to give up their lives for
their fellow townsmen during the Hundred
Years War. The museum recently received the
requisite funds to unite the sculptural ensemble.
Currently, close to 200 Rodin works are at
Stanford, the largest collection of the artist's
work outside the Mus6e Rodin in Paris.
The Rodin Sculpture Garden itself was cre

ated in 1985 at the initiative of the late Albert
Elsen, professor of art history. The 20 sculp
tures inside the Rodin Sculpture Garden were
donated by patrons Iris and B. Gerald Cantor.
B. Gerald Cantor first saw a Rodin upon vis
iting the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York in 1945. Eighteen months later he began
his collection by purchasing a version of "The
Hand of God." In the next 50 years, Cantor as
sembled the world's largest private collection of
works of Rodin, including approximately 750
sculptures. Of these, the Cantors donated more
than 450 works to institutions all over the world.
The Cantors have contributed a total of 185
Rodins to Stanford and have supported Rodin
studies since 1969. B. Gerald Cantor also es
tablished the Rodin Research Fund in the De

partment of Art. This fund allows doctoral stu
dents engaged in Rodin studies to conduct
studies and research abroad.
In 1994, the Cantors contrihuted $10 million
toward rebuilding and expanding the Stanford
Art Museum, which was severely damaged in
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
Of the approximately $37 million budget
for museum restoration, over S2OO.CXK) was de
voted to enhancing the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den. "This is being made possible by the gen
erosity of a number of donors and the work of
the Palo Alto University Rotary Club," Dug
gan said.
Citing the importance of the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden and the new Cantor Center for
the Visual Arts to the communities surround
ing Stanford, the Rotary Club has pledged to
undertake a special "family campaign" to in
volve at least 100 families in its fundraising ef
forts.
"We are now in the process of extending
Rodin's heritage into the 21st century," said
Barryte.
