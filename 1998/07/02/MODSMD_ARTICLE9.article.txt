# SLAC suffers security breach at hands of hackers

Computer hackers broke into the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
computer system last month in what
is believed to be the facility's worst
computer security breach ever.
Alarmed SLAC officials shut
down access to their computers to
the outside world after discovering
the breach of security. This action
left nearly 3,000 researchers without
Internet services for a week.
According to SLAC officials, the
hackers began to create new breach
es in the computer system even as
old ones were being fixed. "My im
pression is that the hackers were try
ing to put more holes in as quickly as
[security personnel] were trying to

take them out." said Computer Se
curity Officer Stephen Hansen.
The hackers broke into the comput
er system by intercepting a password
sent to the facility over the Internet.
A password that is not encrypted
travels through the Internet as clear
text that can be detected and
tracked by password capturing pro
grams called "sniffers." The hackers
used the password they obtained to
access more than 30 of SLAC's
Unix servers.
By gaining unauthorized access
to highly privileged "root" accounts
on these computers, the hackers ac
cessed data in numerous accounts.
Additionally, they created "back
doors" to conceal their presence and
allow them to later re-enter the sys
tem undetected.

Even though the hackers looked
at about 50 files and left an empty file
on one of the servers, no files nor
software were damaged.
However, the computer shut
down isolated scientists from their
collaborators, delayed experiments
and put some people behind in their
work by several weeks.
SLAC spokeswoman P.A.
Moore called the lost time an "incal
culable" setback.
According to Computer Security
Officer Bob Cowles, SLAC's sys
tems were isolated after the break in
to protect the facility's computing in
frastructure.
Potentially the hackers could
have used the SLAC servers as a
staging ground to infiltrate more
computer systems at other govern

ment and research facilities.
Increasingly, hackers armed with
"sniffers" are causing problems for
research facilities and universities.
Even the use of telnet to check e
mail or File Transfer Protocol pro
grams such as Fetch poses a security
risk because these programs send
sensitive password information over
the Internet non-encrypted.
"Although SLAC did not have
files damaged this time, the potential
for damage is high, hence the need to
improve security," said Moore.
Such measures would include im
proving detection and monitoring of
security breaches, and increasing
firewalls â€” "gateways" that restrict
access and the exchange of informa
tion between computers inside and
outside of the computer system.

Many Stanford computers al
ready have some measure of protec
tion against hackers. Sweet Hall
workstations, for instance, use a
computer security system that
guards the transmission of informa
tion by encrypting it. Rather than
sending a password, which can be in
tercepted the system sends a scram
bled key to the password.
Now, SLACofficials are debating
whether they should increase securi
ty on the computer system. However
increasing security would involve
limiting freedom.
"We now have to assess the trade
offs of an open community versus a
more Internet-secure community,"
said Moore. "It's a debate that's tak
ing place heatedly among different
scientists."
