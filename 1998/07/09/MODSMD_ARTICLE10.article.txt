# Gall shines for Team USA
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
July temperatures hover around
100 degrees at Hi Corbett Field, the
Tucson, Ariz., home of USA Base
ball. John Gall's batting average
hovers around .400. It's been a hot
summer.
Gall, a junior who started at des
ignated hitter for Stanford last sea
son, is leading the national team in
several offensive categories as it
heads to the world championship
tournament later this month. From
the third spot in the lineup, Gall is
batting .409, second on the team of
all-star collegians. He leads the
team in hits (36), RBIs (25) and
doubles (11).
The numbers represent Gall's
successful transition from collegiate
to international play. A .376 hitter
for the Cardinal last season, the 1997
Freshman Ail-American has adjust
ed to the crafty pitching of veteran
foreign players.
"In international baseball, most
of the (opposing) players are older
and more experienced," but have
weaker arms, Gall said in an inter
view yesterday."The pitchers are
smarter. I have to be a little more pa
tient."

His success has helped Team
USA to a 19-9 record and a berth in
the International Baseball Associa
tion World Championships, July 21
through Aug. 2 in Italy. It's also
helped erase bad memories of the
Cardinal's early exit from the
NCAA West Regional in May.
Stanford, ranked No. 1 most of the
season, lost twice at home in the re
gional and failed to make the Col
lege World Series.

"The nicest thing about summer
ball," Gall said, is that "you can for
get about what happened. It's a
great way to realize that it's a game
and it keeps on going."
Baseball has been both a lifestyle
and a passport for Gall this summer.
When it concludes a four-game se
ries with Mexico Saturday, the na
tional team will have played 32
games in 35 days, including the world

championship qualifying tourna
ment in Managua, Nicaragua.
Between team meals, workouts
and games, Gall spends about 10
hours a day with the team. But the
experience is relaxing, he said, and
rich with benefits. "It's not often you
get an all-expense paid trip to
Nicaragua," he said.
The other players help ease his 2
p.m. to midnight ballpark routine.
Gall calls the team — which includes
sophomore Cardinal pitcher Justin
Wayne and five other players from
the Pacific 10 Conference — "all
good guys." But in some cases, the
shift from adversary to teammate
has been strange.
"It's a little bit different," Gall
said, "sitting in the on-deck circle
rooting for (Arizona State star)
Willie Bloomquist to get a hit."
When the world championships
end in August, Gall will take a
month off from baseball before re
turning to Stanford in the fall. For
now, he is enjoying the team and the
somewhat new sense of patriotism it
has given him.
"Once you start playing with
guys who don't speak your language
and come from different countries,"
he said, "you do get a certain pride
that you didn't have before."
