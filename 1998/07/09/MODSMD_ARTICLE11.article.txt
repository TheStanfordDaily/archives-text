## 'Dolittle' does little 
### 
Take a pint of "Nutty Professor,"
a pound of "Babe," a cup of Disney
and a pinch of "Saturday Night
Live," and you've got "Dr. Dolit
tle," the newest comedy staring
Eddie Murphy. If imitation is the
sincerest source of flattery, this film
will no doubt stroke many egos.
Murphy plays Dr. Dolittle, a
man whose childhood gift of talking
to animals is stifled early in life by
his father. Now he is a doctor living
in San Francisco with a beautiful
wife and two daughters. He's about
to sign the biggest financial deal of
his life when he accidentally nicks a
dog with his car. All of a sudden, Dr.
Dolittle's gift of understanding the
call of the wild is unleashed.
Animals begin to flock to his
home and office for healing. He
fights it for most of the film. How
ever, when he doesn't, he enjoys his
rapport with nature more than his
job as a real doctor.
The not-so-original lesson that
you're supposed to come away with
is to be yourself and to do what you
love, even if it gets you hauled off to
the loony bin for a while. It's a trite
theme, but it doesn't spoil the pic
ture, thanks to the comedic talents
of the cast.

Starring in this picture is perhaps
the funniest comedian of the '80s —
Eddie Murphy, and one of the fun
niest of the '90s, Chris Rock, who
plays the voice of a wise-ass guinea
pig named Rodney. Their humor is
often corny or crude, and some
jokes fall flat, but you'll be laughing,
which is what you came for in the
first place.
Rounding off the general cast is
"Lucky," a dog played by Norm
Mac Donald, a comedian who
seems to appeal more to other co
medians than to the viewing public.
Guest voices include Julie Kavner
(from"The Simpsons") and Ellen
DeGeneres as well as voice cameos
by Gilbert Gottfried and Pee Wee
Herman.
The movie tries to teach the au
diences about happiness, but what it
really teaches them is that good co
medians can elevate mediocre ma
terial. If you don't mind the latter,
you'll certainly laugh at the former.
Unfortunately for its actors,
"Mulan" was a far better forum for
Murphy's talents, and "Lethal
Weapon 4" might be a better one
for Rock's.
