# Hollister's 'Weekend'
## a 						recycled version of Blackstreet 
### 
Another artist has entered the al
ready overcrowded R&B market
and failed to corne up with anything
original; this time it's Dave Holiister
in his debut album, "the weekend."
Formerly a member of the band
Blackstreet, Holiister starts off his
title track with a good beat and
rhythm, but these disappear by the
end. The themes have been heard be
fore — making a lot of money, riding
in really nice cars and having one's
way with women.
The problem is that no one cares
what he and his friends do on the
weekend if the tune isn't catchy or
unique. Despite the inclusion of
noted East Coast artist Redman, this
album sounds like a feeble attempt to
recycle his success with Blackstreet.
One of the first things that strikes you
when you hear the title track is how

close it sounds to
Blackstreet's "No
diggity." This is fur
ther developed when

the words, "no-diggity" are used in
the song. In another song, "Ballad,"
Hollister follows the sickeningly
overplayed R&B love song format
that is currently so common. This is
not Jodeci, but rather the millionth
singer who has followed its format.
Although this album doesn't put
Hollister off to a great start, he does
show potential in some of his songs.
He's clearly a talented singer who
should be focusing his energies and
strong voice on innovative material
rather than rehashing what's been
done too often.
