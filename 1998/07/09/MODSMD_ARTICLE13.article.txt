# The 						fourth 'Lethal Weapon'
## Gibson and Glover still going after 11 years 
### 
Sequel. This one word is the
most feared (and rightfully so)
word in all of Hollywood. Think
about the injustices to film making

that you have personally sat through: "Speed 2,"
"Naked Gun 33 1/3." The worst of all, "Highlander 2:
The Quickening." The list goes on but there is a good
rule of thumb — avoid any movie with a number at the
end of the title. This rule almost holds true for the fourth
installment of the Mel Gibson and Danny Glover pair,
"Lethal Weapon 4." The key word is "almost."
"Trouble seems to know where I am." This is an easy
way to describe the often unbelievable lives of Los An
geles police officers Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and
Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). They have fought the
tide of crime in LA successfully for the past 11 years on
the big screen.
The two are a perfect team. The problem is that their
troubles are downright unbelievable. The script writers
were fighting a losing battle in this one and the plot
seems to chug along, choking on its own implausibility.
The film's saving grace is the addition of new police
officer Lee Butters, played by actor / comedian Chris
Rock. He keeps the audience laughing and allows their
minds to wander from the horrible story line.
The main villain, Wah Sing Ku, played by Jet Li
(Asia's biggest movie star since the hallowed Jackie
Chen) dazzles us with his martial arts ability. These two,
along with old hands Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) and Leo
Getz (Joe Pesci) allow this movie to barely beat Holly
wood's "Sequel Law."
In the end, a few things stand out. The action is fast
paced and furious, the one-liners are witty and catchy,
and Eric Clapton and David Sanborn put together an
other fine soundtrack.
The drawbacks are the aforementioned plot and the

forced, sappy romance between Gibson and Russo. Go
see the movie for the pure entertainment value and bite
your tongue through the ending.
