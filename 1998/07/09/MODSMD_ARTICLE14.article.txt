# Clooney and Lopez get frisky
## 
### 
In the season of spe
cial effects and action films,
"Out of Sight" is easily one
of the best movies this sum
mer — possibly one of the

best this year. If you liked the smart dialogue of "Get
Shorty," the surrealism of "Pulp Fiction" and the old-time
sexual tension of the "Moonlighting" series of yesteryear,
then this movie is for you.
"Out of Sight" begins when career bank robber Jack
Foley (George Clooney) is enraged to no end and throws
his tie to the ground with disgust. He decides right then
and there to unleash his frustrations. How does he do it?
By strolling into the local Sun Trust Bank, checking out
the scene and holding up a teller without the help of a gun
or mask and armed with only the most charming of per
sonalities.
Based on Elmore Leonard's crime novel of the same
name, "Out of Sight" follows Foley through flashbacks
and present time in his quest to pull off one final scam.
Gooney is matched with Jennifer Lopez as Federal Mar
shal Karen Sisco, a street-smart federal agent who is as
comfortable with being "Daddy's Little Girl" (Daddy
played by Denis Farina) as she is with unwrapping auto
matic handguns from him on her birthday.
The chance encounter of Sisco and Foley is fantastic;
she is brandishing a shotgun while Foley and his partner
Buddy (Ving Rhames) disarm and kidnap her.
Eventually Sisco finds her priorities torn as she gets to

know Foley. During the getaway, the pair finds itself in a
"tight situation" which only leads to more tension and en
joyment.
The action and affection between the two characters
develops throughout the movie as their paths continue to
cross. The remaining cast of characters — Don Cheadle as
a crooked boxer and Albert Brooks as a Michael Millken
type — enliven an already colorful backdrop for Foley
and Sisco. And be on the lookout for a number of unac
credited cameos from other "Leonard" movies.
This movie is definitely one to check out. It's even
worth full price.
