## Bell Freda: Washington, D.C. Stanford can learn from D.C. diversity 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C.,
might be best known for
bitter poverty and fiscal
mismanagement — the city had to
abandon its paltry recycling pro
gram a year ago because of lack of
funds — but it sure knows how to
throw a party.
One of 700,000 people attending
the Fourth of July celebration at the
National Mall, I had a first-hand
look at Washington's Indepen
dence Day mayhem. The scene in
front of the Capitol, where our
group had fought to clear a space to
sit and watch the fireworks, became
more and more raucous as the show
approached.
By the time Tony Danza took
the stage — why they chose a sec
ondhand star of a long-past sitcom
of questionable quality to serve as
master of ceremonies is still beyond
me — most of the college students
were drunk and the rest of the
crowd was right behind.
The crowd at the Capitol was a
diverse one, economically and
racially. Indeed, the city's diversity
was one of the first things to really
strike me about Washington.
A friend from work helped ex
plain it to me. Good old San Fran
cisco is also ethnically and racially
diverse, he said, but in a different
way. While the town itself is diverse,
neighborhoods are by and large di
vided by race and class. You will
find few of Chinese descent in
North Beach, and few Italians in
Chinatown. The Mission district is
almost exclusively African Ameri
can and Latino; Pacific Heights is
almost entirely white.
But while Washington's neigh
borhoods lack the distinctiveness of
San Francisco, they have a different
quality — internal diversity. Like
any large city, Washington neigh
borhoods are segregated by class.
And, as usual, minorities are more
prevalent in the poorer areas than
in the richer ones.
But everywhere, rich or poor,
people of different types, sizes,
races and backgrounds take the
same Metros, eat at the same delis
and lounge on the lawns of the same
monuments.
We might have diversity at Stan
ford, but it is very different. We
have the statistics to support lofty
claims about multiculturalism and
racial integration. Additionally, af
firmative action is alive and well

even in our most conservative ad
ministration.
But a university shouldn't pursue
diversity in order to have a colorful
graduation photo. Diversity is about
points of view, and about being able
to see multiple perspectives. With
all of Stanford's high-and-mighty
language about the free-flowing of
ideas at a modern university, it
seems like we understand that defi
nition.
But one week in Washington has
proven to me that we don't really
understand the meaning of diversi
ty. Our worlds as Stanford students
are, frankly, markedly similar. We
may be racially diverse, but we have
largely homogeneous backgrounds.
Most of us grew up mainly in sub
urbs with both parents working and
a spare car for the kids to use. We
attended good high schools with
strong Advanced Placement pro
grams.
Washington is a world entirely
apart from ours. Voters here elect
ed a mayor who'd been sent to
prison for smoking crack with pros
titutes in a downtown hotel room.
And he won in a landslide. Talk
about having a different perspec
tive.
But the reality for most folks in
this city is that racism is connected
to another vicious beast, econom
ics. The predicament of race and
class has been devastating for the
Washington, D.C. community.
And so the press calls Marion
Barry "Mayor-for-life," because
he'll win easily every time he wants
to run. Most observers think this is
due to his civil rights record. His
message is popular with the urban
underclass of D.C., a populist
tinged brand of liberalism inter
twined with pride for African
Americans.
I've never heard anything like it
— and therein lies the shame.
I think it might help if we pur
sued diversity at Stanford in a way
that's more realistic. Poor kids, by
and large, don't go to Stanford. Nei
ther do many students from the
inner city. While they might exist,
their voices are rarely heard. And
theirs is a perspective that needs to
be voiced.

searching for a D. C. apartment.
