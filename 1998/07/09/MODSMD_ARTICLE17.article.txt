# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Lies, damned lies and journalism 
### 
YOU PROBABLY DONT
trust this column. You don't
trust it because it's in a news
paper. A newspaper that counts itself
among the National Media. You cer
tainly don't trust the National Media.
Why should you? Time and CNN
are big shots in the National Media,
and they've done a lot in the last few
weeks to convince you not to trust
them. They co-produced a story al
leging the United States military
(speaking of organizations you don't
trust), on the orders of President
Richard Nixon (ditto), used nerve gas
at the end of the Vietnam War. Not a
light charge. Then, a month later,
they took it all back.
Oops. Turns out we're not so sure
of ourselves. The facts aren't quite
sustainable. We shouldn't have run
the story (not that it wasn't true, nec
essarily, just not sustainable). Didn't
mean to get you all worked up about
that. Sorry.
You understand Time, maybe.
They did darken OJ.'s picture a few
years back, made him look menacing.
Like a killer. But CNN? You had a
hard time with CNN. They're the
world's night watchman, always
awake and ready to bring you the
news. Twenty-four hours of truth,
that was CNN for you. You can't be
lieve CNN wouldn't check its facts.
You trusted CNN like you trusted
... The Boston Globe. There was a
paper that wouldn't let you down, an
old journalistic standby. You trusted

Patricia Smith, too, because she told
you about Boston, about its people.
As a columnist, she connected with
you on a human level, and her words
often went straight to your heart.
It hurt when you found out your
heart had been digesting lies. The
tear-jerker about the cancer victim?
Fake, just like all or part of 40 other
columns she penned in her two years
at The Globe.
You know she wrote twice a week
for those two years, you factor out a
few weeks vacation, you do the math
and you come to the conclusion that
Patricia Smith lied to you at least once
every five times she wrote. You won
der how she, or Steven Glass, who
fabricated 27 stories before the New
Republic fired him, could sleep at
night.
You're not alone. Editors and pro
ducers across the country are asking
the same questions you are, dealing
with the same issues. News organiza
tions are only as strong as the bonds
between their reporters and editors.
Those bonds are built on trust, and
when they break down — when edi
tors lose confidence in the validity of
their writers' reporting — so does the
newsroom.
At most daily newspapers, few
stories are fact-checked before publi
cation. Does that surprise you? Prob
ably not. Editors simply don't have
the time to question every quote or
look up every figure.
But you should blame them, like

you blame their reporters, because
they are ultimately responsible for
what goes in the paper or on the air.
You wonder what can be done
about all this. Who, if anyone, can re
store hope for the National Media?
You can.
Start a personal strike against false
reporting. Write to Time. Call CNN.
Let the National Media know that
you are mad as hell, and you're not
going to take it anymore.
Exercise your consumer power by
only patronizing news organizations
that place a premium on factual re
porting. Pick up a copy of The New
York Times and tell the rest of the
National Media that you will bring
back your business when they stop
sacrificing accuracy for scoops.
If you all act together, you will
make a difference. Circulation will
decline, ratings will plummet. You
will hold publishers across the coun
try hostage in the name of journalistic
ethics. Journalists will realize that, re
gardless of how good a paper looks or
how hip an anchorperson acts, the
public is interested first and foremost
in truth.
They'll get the picture. If they
don't, they'll lose out. Someday, you
will have faith in the National Media
again.
Trust me.
