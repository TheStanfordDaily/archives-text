## Year One: Kinnally takes a look back 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
In the past year, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid Robert Kinnally has not only
adapted to a new position and con
fronted an unprecedented 19,000 ap
plications. He's even had his bike
stolen. But despite these varied chal
lenges, he has finished the year look
ing "optimistically" toward the next.
As his one-year anniversary as ad
missions dean nears, Kinnally thinks
back to his first few days and says that
his "initial expectations" were almost
immediately confirmed upon step
ping foot on the Stanford campus.
"People asked me what first sur
prised me about Stanford. Basically, I
was told what an exceptional place
Stanford was, but I realized just how
wonderful it was once I got here," he
said. "Every corner I turned, I
seemed to find something amazing,
especially in terms of the students,
whom I was able to meet through
dorm dinners and other activities.
From the students, I got to know the
heart of the enterprise."
Coming from Sarah Lawrence, a
small liberal arts college in
Bronxville, N.Y., Kinnally admitted
that the adjustment was considerable,
especially because his former school
had a total of 1000 undergraduates.
He used to write personal notes of
congratulation to students upon their
acceptance.
But Kinnally does not particularly
miss that aspect of Sarah Lawrence
admissions; since he feels that Stan
ford officials make an effort to con
nect with students individually, de
spite the complexity of the institution.
"We try to make this as personal
of a process as is possible," said Kin

nally. "We give out cards and e-mail
addresses; we don't have to do that,
but we want to make sure we answer
questions and represent Stanford ac
curately. And we enjoy this — meet
ing with prospective students and
being in touch with the culture of 17-
year-olds."
Dealing with numbers
The main challenge that Kinnally
and his staff have faced concerning
these 17-year-olds has been the sheer
number of them. The nine percent
rise in applications this year has
caused the admissions staff to not
only put in longer hours, but also to
come to terms with rejecting a signifi
cantly larger number of students.
With an admit rate of 13 percent,
an all-time low, and an all-time high
in the number of applicants, Stanford
has had the largest increase in appli
cations nationwide. Admissions offi
cials found that the decisions were
particularly hard to make this year.
"It's hard to explain to a student
who is number one in his or her class
why they didn't get into a place like
Stanford when they have a spotless
record, and the person's a good
writer," said Kinnally. "It's just that
we're in a position now where we get
so many stellar applications that we
have very difficult choices to make.
We want to explain to the students
that it isn't anything that they did or
didn't do. It's just the numbers; there
are so many applications that we have
to make very fine distinctions."
Even with the dramatic increase in
applications, Kinnally believes that
he and his staff still give each appli
cant the "holistic approach" that
Stanford has always been able to give.
He said that the decisions are made
"thoughtfully," and that several con

siderations are given to teacher rec
ommendations, essays and any road
blocks that the student might have
faced.
"The good news is that people
make these decisions, and therefore
we can take an individual and consid
er him or her in his or her own world
and see what the person has been
able to do with the resources avail
able."
Kinnally feels that in doing this, he
has carried on former dean of admis
sions James Montoya's ideas about
"who the University is looking for."
He says that in reviewing applica
tions, he looks for not simply excel
lence, but a distinguishing trait that
promises to bring something "spec
tacular to the university community."
"Does the student have an origi
nal idea, something that will trans
form?" said Kinnally. "It's not just
that the person may be a good
writer; it's what they say in those es
says. It's about what a teacher no
tices in a student."
Diversifying the pool
Kinnally also feels that remaining
committed to affirmative action has
been an important part of his job, es
pecially due to the elimination of af
firmative action at UC-Berkeley. He
continues to pay attention to targeted
minority groups and to be passionate
about the policy.
"In the light of Prop. 209, it's going
to change the way students are edu
cated at the University of California,"
he said. "And that's the worse thing
that I think could happen. They will
survive; things will be fine. But it's
going to be a different experience,
and I want to ensure that students
here get the benefit of diversity."
Standards for athletes have also

risen in the past year with the larger
applicant pool. He feels that Stan
ford's commitment to high quality
students is resulting in everyone
being subjected to "higher stan
dards."
In looking at preliminary num
bers, Kinnally expects that there may
be an additional increase of 2,000 ap
plications this coming fall. He and his
staff have prepared for this likelihood
by ordering more materials, hiring
more part-time readers and another
full-time staff member.
"Does this mean we'll have a ten
percent admit rate next year? We will
have a lot more disappointments, be
cause the number we admit has to
stay constant," said Kinnally.
This issue of constancy, Kinnally
believes, is an important one, since
the University itself is not growing in
area. He feels that the current stu
dent-to-faculty ratio is an admirable
one, since it allows a number of pro
grams to exist, namely undergradu
ate seminars, sophomoie college and
undergraduate research. These are
opportunities that he sees as rare at
other colleges.
Revamping financial aid
Kinnally terms his first year as a
"busy" one, not only due to the in
crease in applications, but also as a re
sult of changes he and his staff have
implemented, particularly in finan
cial aid. The home equity portion has
been reformed so that there is a
"cap," limiting what home equity
contributes to the eventual sum.
"We did this because families
were saying that they were stretching
to pay, and also because the housing
market is so out of control right now,"
said Kinnally. "Home equity has
been a big factor in the past, and
putting this cap gives us a more realis
tic view of what the family can con
tribute."
The admissions staff has also al
tered the outside awards policy, al
lowing students to eliminate the self
help portion of their package instead
of drawing from Stanford scholar
ship. This applies not only to incom
ing students, but also to present stu
dents who are currently bringing in
outside monies. However, the policy
is not retroactive.
"This is exciting, since we're one of
the first universities to be able to do
this," Kinnally said. "Now what's
going to happen next year is every
one's going to be doing this."
Kinnally is also "thrilled" that he
and his staff were able to formulate
these changes, implement them and
send out notice within a year.
"It means a lot to me to be able to
do this," he said. "It's great that we
were able to bring up these concerns

early in the year and put them in place
for next year. We got a tremendous
amount of support from the provost
and the president. They were 100 per
cent behind it."
Other changes in next year's ad
missions process include the elimina
tion of Early Decision 11, which offi
cials felt was unnecessary, and using
more technology, such as having stu
dents enter in personal information
and essays electronically.
Strengthening ties
A goal that Kinnally is working on
for the coming year is forming a
strong connection between faculty
and admissions. Kinnally believes
that Stanford professors can share
important knowledge about students
from working with them in a class
room setting.
"We want the faculty to be a part
of our process and to educate us," he
said. "Also we want to help them un
derstand, especially in terms of fresh
men and sophomores, the challenges
that they faced in high school. We
want to keep them in touch with
what's going on in the high schools
these days."
The faculty is one of the reasons
Kinnally feels that Stanford is a "pre
mier institution" and is therefore able
to attract so many applicants.
"We have excellent people here
who are bringing in fresh thinking,
and our students benefit from that."
He also feels that the wider na
tional audience that Stanford has
been receiving through the press in
the past few years is contributing to
the increase in applications. Despite
the University being well-known
throughout the country, Stanford ad
missions officials plan on traveling
even more next year to reach East
Coast and international students.
"We want to be able to have per
sonal contact with those students
whom we otherwise might not be
able to meet," Kinnally said.
Even with all his plans for the fu
ture, Kinnally cannot help looking at
this past year and reflecting on all that
has happened to him.
"I broke my arm, my car died, my
new car got hit, my T.V. blew up and
my bike got stolen," he quipped.
But Kinnally remembers the good
as well. "This was a very welcoming
campus," he said. "I had a great time
meeting Stanford people, especially
faculty, students and alumni. I had a
great year in terms of meeting Stan
ford people. For me, that was the
most meaningful experience, because
Stanford made that much more sense
when I got to hear the stories of stu
dents and alumni, and it confirmed
my beliefs that Stanford is an amazing
place."


Sam Mankiewicz — Daily
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robert Kinnally looks back at a year of new experiences and chal
lenges. One of the foremost issues the dean has dealt with is this year's nine percent increase in under
graduate applications, which has resulted in the admissions staff having to make very "difficult deci
sions" and "fine distinctions" among members of the applicant pool.
