## Sand Hill case awaits hearing Menlo Park, Palo Alto attorneys accept Paik's appointment 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
After months of delay and a
change of jurisdiction, the Menlo
Park lawsuit over the environmental
impact report on the Sand Hill Road
Corridor Projects is set for hearing. In
the suit against Palo Alto, the Stan
ford Management Co. and the Uni
versity have been named the real par
ties of interest.
Both parties have agreed to allow
Retired Monterey Superior Court
Judge Harkjoon Paik hear the case.
Initially, both parties had sought
to move the case out of Santa Clara
County, which is home to both Stan
ford and Palo Alto. After the case sat
awaiting hearing in Sonoma County

for six months, it was sent back to
Santa Clara County due to a backlog
of cases in Sonoma. A neutral judge
was then assigned by the Judicial
Conference of California,
Although there has been some
media hype over the fact that Paik is a
Stanford alumnus, having earned un
dergraduate degrees in history and
political science in 1958 and a law
school degree in 1961, all parties have
agreed to accept his appointment.
"Judge Paik is smart, fair and im
partial," said Trent Orr, attorney for
the City of Menlo Park. "We're con
tent to have him hear the case."
Larry Horton, Stanford's director
of government and community rela
tions, added that Paik's Stanford affil
iation is "irrelevant to the case."

The lawsuit
In the suit, Menlo Park charges
that the environmental impact of the
Sand Hill Road Corridor Projects
was not adequately studied in the re
port and thus violates the California
Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), a state law that governs de
velopment projects.
TTie Sand Hill Road Corridor Pro
jects involve developing much of the
northwest corner of Leland and Jane
Stanford's former farm. The projects
include extending Sand Hill Road to
El Camino Real and widening Sand
Hill to four lanes for most of its
length. Additionally, the University
will build the Stanford West Apart
ments, a 628-unit faculty and staff
housing complex, the Stanford West

Senior Housing, a 454-unit senior cit
izen housing and health center pro
ject, and expand the Stanford Shop
ping Center by 80,000 square feet.
Palo Alto voters approved the
projects in November, when Mea
sure O passed with 55 percent of the
vote.
On Aug. 14, 1997, Menlo Park
filed suit against Palo Alto, which has
backed Stanford's plans for the Sand
Hill Road Corridor.
Menlo Park's lawsuit, which pre
ceded the November Palo Alto refer
endum, contends that the ramifica
tions of development beyond those
ultimately approved by Measure O
were not adequately considered in

the environmental impact report.
Stanford's application in Decem
ber to expand the Stanford Medical
Center has lent fuel to Menlo Park of
ficials who claim the widening of
Sand Hill Road and related roadway
improvements were intentionally de
signed to accommodate and even en
courage further development.
However, the notion of expanding
the Medical Center was not new
when the application was filed last
winter. University President Gerhard
Casper has been discussing expan
sion of the Medical Center since his
first meeting with the Palo Alto City
Council in 1992.
"(The Sand Hill Road expansion]
was sold as a panacea for traffic prob

lems in the area, but the big missing
piece of information is how much will
be eaten up by Stanford expansion in
the near and far term," Orr said.
He emphasized that the single
largest concern for Menlo Park resi
dents is increased traffic flow.
"The Sand Hill project will expand
the capacity for road traffic by 50 per
cent," Orr stated.
However, there are also concerns
about how the noise from the con
struction of the Stanford West Apart
ments and Stanford West Senior
Housing will affect adjacent Menlo
Park neighborhoods.
In its opening brief, Menlo Park
claims that it was marginalized in the
CEQA and planning processes.
On the other hand, Palo Alto's
opening brief characterizes the
Menlo Park suit as a case of "sour
grapes in the form of a CEQA law
suit," noting that the planning process

consisted of "no less than 35 open
meetings, workshops and public
hearings before the City Planning
Commission, Architectural Review
Board and City Council."
The Palo Alto brief also empha
sized that environmental impact re
ports are supposed to survey the pro
ject under consideration and not po
tential future projects that may or
may not be brought to the city coun
cil's consideration.
According to Orr, if Menlo Park
wins the case, "the court would be
compelled to set aside the develop
ment agreement Palo Alto approved
and commence a new public
process."
However, Horton expressed con
fidence in the strength of Palo Alto's
case.
"The report is without a doubt the
most thorough environmental impact
report done in Palo Alto," Horton

said.
Senior Asst. City Attorney of Palo
Alto Sue Case agreed. "We spent five
years getting [the environmental im
pact report] together and it's very
thorough, but the question is whether
it misses something," she said. "We
certainly can't imagine that it does."
Further complications
Even if Menlo Park loses its suit
over the environmental impact re
port, expanding the road to four lanes
when it crosses both municipal and
county lines into Menlo Park is far
from certain.
Although Measure O approved
widening the road in Palo Alto, ap
proval by the Menlo Park City Coun
cil is necessary to widen the road after
it crosses the San Francisquito Creek,
which marks the border between the
communities.
If Palo Alto wins the suit, Stanford

will commence with all proposed im
provements in Palo Alto. The Uni
versity will also offer to pay for reno
vations of the Menlo Park portion of
Sand Hill Road and improvements
on the Sand Hill Road-Santa Cruz
Avenue and Alpine Road-Junipero
Serra Boulevard intersections. If
Menlo Park refuses to accept funds, a
two-lane portion of Sand Hill Road
will remain sandwiched between the
four-lane section to be constructed in
Palo Alto and the existing four-lane
section in Menlo Park.
Three members of the Menlo Park
City Council strongly oppose Sand
Hill Road expansion.
Attorneys on both sides are cur
rently negotiating a hearing date, to
be set most likely for the end of this
month or the next.
Case said that both sides are "will
ing to get it over with. I've found their
attorneys to be very forthright."
