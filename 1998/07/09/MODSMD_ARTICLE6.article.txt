## Sand Hill case awaits hearing Menlo Park, Palo Alto attorneys accept Paik's appointment 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
After months of delay and a
change of jurisdiction, the Menlo
Park lawsuit over the environmental
impact report on the Sand Hill Road
Corridor Projects is set for hearing. In
the suit against Palo Alto, the Stan
ford Management Co. and the Uni
versity have been named the real par
ties of interest.
Both parties have agreed to allow
Retired Monterey Superior Court
Judge Harkjoon Paik hear the case.
Initially, both parties had sought
to move the case out of Santa Clara
County, which is home to both Stan
ford and Palo Alto. After the case sat
awaiting hearing in Sonoma County

for six months, it was sent back to
Santa Clara County due to a backlog
of cases in Sonoma. A neutral judge
was then assigned by the Judicial
Conference of California,
Although there has been some
media hype over the fact that Paik is a
Stanford alumnus, having earned un
dergraduate degrees in history and
political science in 1958 and a law
school degree in 1961, all parties have
agreed to accept his appointment.
"Judge Paik is smart, fair and im
partial," said Trent Orr, attorney for
the City of Menlo Park. "We're con
tent to have him hear the case."
Larry Horton, Stanford's director
of government and community rela
tions, added that Paik's Stanford affil
iation is "irrelevant to the case."

The lawsuit
In the suit, Menlo Park charges
that the environmental impact of the
Sand Hill Road Corridor Projects
was not adequately studied in the re
port and thus violates the California
Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), a state law that governs de
velopment projects.
TTie Sand Hill Road Corridor Pro
jects involve developing much of the
northwest corner of Leland and Jane
Stanford's former farm. The projects
include extending Sand Hill Road to
El Camino Real and widening Sand
Hill to four lanes for most of its
length. Additionally, the University
will build the Stanford West Apart
ments, a 628-unit faculty and staff
housing complex, the Stanford West

Senior Housing, a 454-unit senior cit
izen housing and health center pro
ject, and expand the Stanford Shop
ping Center by 80,000 square feet.
Palo Alto voters approved the
projects in November, when Mea
sure O passed with 55 percent of the
vote.
On Aug. 14, 1997, Menlo Park
filed suit against Palo Alto, which has
backed Stanford's plans for the Sand
Hill Road Corridor.
Menlo Park's lawsuit, which pre
ceded the November Palo Alto refer
endum, contends that the ramifica
tions of development beyond those
ultimately approved by Measure O
were not adequately considered in
