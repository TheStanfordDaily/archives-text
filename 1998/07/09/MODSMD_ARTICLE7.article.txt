# Scientists urge UFO research
## Despite media skepticism, committee recommends a closer look 
### Suzanne Bohan 
Prof, of Applied Physics Peter Sturrock has become the subject
of keen media interest following the June 29 release of a report
recommending increased institutional support for studying UFO
sightings.
The report calls for institutions to provide support for scientif
ic research of unusual phenomena associated with UFO sightings,
such as inexplicable light sources. Analyzing actual physical evi
dence would be the primary research goal. The scientists believe

the data may help demystify rare but naturally occur-

ring phenomena that some observers mistaken-

ly perceive as otherworldly events.
"Dealing with purely witness testi-

mony has been inconclusive," Stur-

rock said.
For example, scientists have

explained some purported UFO

sightings as actually being

sprites â€” large, brief flashes of
light caused by electrical activ
ity above thunderstorms. And
when the planet Venus is on
the horizon, refracted light
can give it a flattened look,

causing some people to mistak
enly perceive it as a UFO.

Although some scientists are

wary about supporting UFO re-

search, public interest in the topic re-

mains unabated. A poll by ABC News

after the report's release found that 91

percent of Americans believe scientists
should be encouraged to study UFO reports.

The report's authors agree that the public needs bet-

ter information. They deplore the "very unsatisfactory state of ig
norance and confusion" over what the report terms the "UFO
problem," and believe it will "be resolved only by extensive and
open professional scientific investigation."
Helping the public view eyewitness accounts of UFOs through
a scientist's perspective is one means of alleviating the public's
confusion on the issue, the report indicates. In that scenario, news
reports would first approach the sightings as either problems of
perception on the part of the observer or unknown natural phe-

nomena.
"That's a sound way of approaching it," said
Charles Petit, science writer with U.S. News &
World Report. But it's "naive" to think re
porters will follow that approach, he added.

"Most of these stories are going to be written by general as
signment reporters," who treat them as "something light to write
about," he said.
"[News reports] have always been tongue-in-cheek," says
Sturrock. That deters scientists from seriously addressing the

issue, he said.

And the media's focus on the sensationalism of

UFO accounts doesn't help matters. "The

press fans the flames of UFO hysteria,"

said Keay Davidson, science reporter

for the San Francisco Examiner.

"Institutional imperatives

[for profits] cause the media to

ballyhoo these stories," David
, son added.

Davidson said lack of fol
low-up coverage on UFO sto
ries exacerbates the problem.
"There's no interest in dis
proving a sensational claim,"

he said.
Media coverage of unusual

phenomena has improved,

Davidson said, since the Commit-

tee for the Scientific Investigation of

Claims of the Paranormal formed in

1976. The committee claims to provide

"critical examination and investigation of

claims of the paranormal and fringe science." It

also provides a skeptical perspective for journalists.

Petit, however, doesn't think the subject as a whole warrants
much coverage. There's nothing about UFO reports that "seem to
cry out for journalists to take it seriously," he said. "There are too
many mysteries and wonders in nature that are clearly based on
fact to waste much time with these stories that go nowhere."
Sturrock disagreed. "Obviously, 91 percent of the public would
like some answers," which only "serious research" can provide, he
said. "And serious research requires a focus on physical evi
dence."
