### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Tech
nologies will endow a professorship at the University and cre
ate a division of Bell Laboratories at Stanford Research Park.
Both the professorship and the Bell Labs wing will be fo
cused on the general area of communications networking, a
growing field that enables an average telephone to transmit
data.
The endowment of $2.6 million will be provided by Lu
cent's nonprofit portion, the Lucent Technologies Founda
tion. The donation will fund two graduate student grants as
well as the professorship.
"From Stanford's perspective, an endowment is the key to
recruiting or keeping very talented professors because the
money supports salary and research needs." said Prof. John
Hennessy, dean of the School of Engineering.
The scholar to occupy the endowed chair will likely be a
current faculty member in either the electrical engineering or
computer science departments. The professor will be chosen
by Hennessy and the electrical engineering and computer sci
ence department heads. The endowed professorship may ei
ther rotate every few years or remain permanent.
Lucent representative Gary Bonham hopes that the pro
fessorship will not only expand the telecommunications field
but that it will also generate interest in the company among
Stanford students, whom he calls "some of the top in the na
tion."
"We're hoping the endowment will attract interest from
Stanford students," Bonham said. "Stanford is a premier ed
ucational foundation, and it is well-positioned for company
to-company networking since many well-placed individuals
in the industry have graduated from Stanford."
The new Bell Labs at Stanford Research Park will be com
pleted by the middle of next year. Until then. Bell Labs will
operate out of an office on Sand Hill Road as it continues to
develop data networking and Internet software.
Although the Bell Labs wing has no direct connection
with the University, Bonham believes that its establishment
"conveys a notion that we are interested in the Silicon Valley
and recruiting top talent from Stanford"
