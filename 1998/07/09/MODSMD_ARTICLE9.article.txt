## Morning heartbreak in North Beach Soccer, Italian style 
### 
On Friday, I finally got caught up in World Cup mania.
Prior to last week's quarterfinal match between
France and Italy, I hadn't seen a soccer game since the
United States' memorable loss to Brazil in the second
round of the 1994 World Cup.
At that time I was in England and remember the thrill
of quietly celebrating July 4, complete with hot dogs and
hamburgeis, in the basement of an Oxford college while
watching the United States challenge Brazil on American

soil. Somehow, celebrating America's accomplishments in a sport in which
we don't usually excel, on the nation's birthday, in Mother England, really
appealed to me.
Friday morning topped that.
The Steps of Rome cafe in San Francisco's North Beach was packed
when my group of four arrived at 6:45 a.m., 45 minutes before the game. The
aroma of espresso wafted through the cafe where loyal patrons dressed in
Italia T-shirts and wrapped in Italian flags had apparently camped out for
much of the night to ensure a front row seat.
A few minutes after we arrived, those who had dragged themselves out
of bed a little later were being turned away.
As we ate our Italian pastries, Italian music began to fill the cafe and the
din increased. I couldn't help but notice that among the pastries was an "Ital
ian croissant." Although it bore a remarkable resemblance to its more well
known French cousin, no one dared utter such an observation. The cafe was
100 percent behind team Italy.
As game time approached, we all experienced a mini-version of the push
ing and crowd surges that are endemic at European soccer matches.
When the crowd sorted itself out, undoubtedly in a manner that would
have given the fire marshals much displeasure, I was catty-cornered be
tween a stairwell and the women's restroom.
I accepted this position figuring that I would be tossed out of the cafe if I
irritated the large Italian man acting as the bouncer, whom my fellow Gavi
lanites had nicknamed Mussolini. He seemed to be testing people's Italian
and using that as a sorting medhanism for relieving the crowd crunch.
Knowing that I'd be out if he heard my pitiful "bonjourno" or that I might
accidentally blurt out a phrase in French, I decided to keep a low profile. The
space in front of the restroom would do. Anything for the atmosphere.
The first half of the game was rather bland. The French maintained pos
session of the ball, but the Italian goalie managed to thwart their attempts to
score.
The frustration in the cafe was palpable. When the fans were mildly an
noyed, swears and instructions were shouted in English. As things looked
bleaker and bleaker, angry shouts in Italian filled the room.
Halftime lightened the atmosphere as Italian music was once again blast
ed through the cafe.
The second half of the game was much like the first and the crowd re
mained impatient as the score stayed tied.
A half-hour of scoreless overtime sent the game to penalty kicks. The at
mosphere became somber; history has not been kind to Italy when it comes
to penalty kicks.
A hush came over the cafe. Evei, the chefs had emerged from the kitchen.
All eyes were transfixed on the French shooter.
The ball went in. A waitress cupped her hands over her mouth. A chef
lowered his head and put his hand on the counter in despair. Then it was
Team Italy's turn. The kick went in. It was 1-1,
On the next attempt, the French missed and the elation increased. But
then Italy missed, too, and all were solemn once again.
It came down to the final penalty kick. The Frenchman made it. All pres
sure rode on the Italian shooter. His kick hit the top crossbar. The game was
over.
For the first time in more than three hours, the crowd shifted positions.
Many of us had been standing the entire time, but we were too transfixed to
notice that our legs were aching.
The fans started for the door. Walking would alleviate the leg cramps, but
the heartache would remain.
