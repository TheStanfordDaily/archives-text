## Men's hoops camp swells with success 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
There are easier ways to lure
1,6(X) kids to the Stanford campus
than by reaching the Final Four.
Like giving away truckloads of free
ice cream, or hosting a Spice Girls

concert. But the Cardinal men's
basketball team takes what it can
get.
Thanks in large part to its dra
matic March Madness run last sea
son, the Stanford men's basketball
team is enjoying the largest crowd
ever at its summer hoops camp.

Four one-week sessions have
drawn a total of 1,600 youth this
summer, a 30 percent increase from
last year.
The numbers could be larger. By
May 1, the camp had registered
1,250 kids — last year's total atten
dance. Space was full by the end of

the month. "We filled up fast," said
Jamie Zaninovich, director of mar
keting and operations for Stanford
men's basketball, "Right now,
we're at the maximum numbers our
facilities can take."
Both Zaninovich and Cardinal
Asst. Coach Eric Reveno credit the
team's postseason success with
much of the increase. Wins bring
exposure, especially in the nation
ally televised NCAA Tournament.
This year's Midwest Region cham
pion and a Sweet 16 participant in
1997, Stanford has played its way
into the spotlight and the hearts of
young fans.
"The kids remember the Final
Four," Reveno said. "The players
are asked for a lot more autographs,
and recognized more quickly than
they have been in past seasons."
Other factors — like the rising
popularity of basketball nationwide
— have contributed to the upswing.
But the boom can be largely traced
to one game: Stanford's 79-77 come
from-behind win over Rhode Island
in the Midwest Region final. That
victory sent the team to its first Final
Four in 56 years.
"The kids in camp are really
taken by (Cardinal senior point
guard) Art Lee, just from his per
formance against Rhode Island,"
Reveno said. "We have kids
around doing their (Mark "Mad

Dog") Madsen impressions," wav
ing their arms and screaming, imi
tating the junior forward's famous
post-dunk dance at the end of that
game.
The fourth and final group of
would-be Mad Dogs hits the camp
Tuesday. They will be met by near
ly 50 college players and high
school and junior college coaches,
who will serve as camp instructors
for the week.
Finding enough instructors is
challenging, Zaninovich said, but
again, success helps. Reveno said
the camp has attracted "better
staff" this year, including several
Division I assistant coaches.
Stanford's coaches have extra
reason to smile at the 350 addition
al campers this summer. Camp
profits go straight to the coaches,
who rely on the revenue to supple
ment their salaries.
Team benefits are more indirect,
Zaninovich said, because Stanford
camps don't usually bring in top re
cruits. Instead, they help kids devel
op basketball skills — and often an
attachment to the Stanford team.
"We feel like we send 99.999
percent of kids home from here
with a positive experience," Zani
novich said. "Every kid that goes
away and tells his parents that he
had a good time gets us more fans
for the program."
