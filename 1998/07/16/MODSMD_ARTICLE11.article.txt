# It's Woods vs. wind at Open
## British place Tiger among favorites in breezy Birkdale 
### 
SOUTHPORT, England — Unlike
a U.S. Open course. Royal Birkdale
doesn't need a lawn mower to bring
the world's best golfers to their
knees.
Just let that wind blow in from the
Irish Sea, the way it has for the first
few practice rounds of the British
Open, and the toughest test of golf
takes on a whole new meaning.
"It was hard just to walk for
ward," U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen said.
Janzen was the only player to
match par last month at The
Olympic Club in San Francisco,
where the fairways were mowed so
tightly they rolled like linoleum
floors, sending seemingly safe tee
shots scurrying into unforgiving
rough.
If the gusts stay the same when
the 127 th Open championship be
gins today, par might be enough to
win the Claret Jug.
"It's the toughest par 70 I've ever
played," Ernie Els said. "I would say

it's even tougher than Olympic Club
if it blows like this."
The wind can be measured either
by speed — gusts up to 40 mph that
whip over the sand dunes framing
just about every hole at Royal Birk
dale — or by club selection.
During a practice round Monday,
former Stanford golfer Tiger Woods
hit a 3-iron all of 152 yards on No. 7,
the 177-yard par 3.
"Somebody said it's a two-club
wind," said Masters champion Mark
O'Meara, shaking his head. "I know
that Tiger can hit a 9-iron 157 yards
pretty easily with no wind, and he hit
a 3-iron."
Do the math.
Royal Birkdale measures 7,018
yards, plenty long for a par 70, with
plenty of trouble lurking in pot
bunkers down the side of the fair
ways and the foot-high meadow rye
in the rough.
Add the wind, and Birkdale be
comes the ultimate test of patience.
That's the challenge facing Justin

Leonard, trying to become the first
back-to-back British Open champi
on since Tom Watson, '72, in 1983,
young guns like Woods, Els, David
Duval and England's Lee West
wood, and the veterans like
O'Meara, Watson, Tom Lehman
and Nick Price.
Heavy spring rains in England
have left the fairways green and lush,
unlike the yellowish, dry conditions
of 1991 when lan Baker-Finch tied
the Open record with a 130 on the
weekend for an 8-under 272, the
lowest score ever at Birkdale,
Whether anyone can get close to
that score depends on the wind.
And the wind could very well de
termine which players will be in con
tention Sunday.
"I'm not sure this suits anybody's
game," Lehman said. "If you do not
hit it solid, you have no chance what
soever of winning."
British odds makers list Woods
and Westwood the favorites. At this
rate, the safe bet is on Birkdale.
