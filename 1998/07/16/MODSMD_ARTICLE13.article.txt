## Meet Jane Harvard 
### Kerry Shaw Editorial Staff 
both law and business school de
grees from Stanford, to discuss
publishing, Stanford, group novel
writing and"The Student Body."

Jane Harvard's real name, or at
least one of them, is Michael Melch •
er.
Melcher was a student at the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness in 1992 when one of his class
mates from Harvard College be
came the Princess of Japan.
Trailing his sth Year College Re
union, the news made Melcher feel
"way behind." He'd been in the Real
World for six years and he felt that
time was ticking for him to make his
mark.
Skip to 1998.
Today, Melcher is one of the au
thors of this summer's sexiest mul
ticultural thrillers "The Student
Body."
Published by Random House
under the pseudonym "Jane Har
vard," it's the story of Toni Isaacs, a
sassy reporter for The Harvard
Crimson who receives a tip that class
mates — both men and women —
are working the world's oldest pro
fession. In hot pursuit of the story,
the young black journalist uncovers
strippers and hookers intertwined in
a racial, financial and sexual scandal
at the country's oldest university.
Toni's creator, "Jane Harvard"
is really the name of four class
mates from Harvard '86 — Michael
Melcher, Faith Adiele, Bennett
Singer and Julia Sullivan.
The quartet will be at Border's
Bookstore in downtown Palo Alto
this Saturday at 2:30 to read from
their book. The Stanford Weekly
caught up with Melcher, who holds

At 17, Melcher was the first stu
dent in 50 years from his high
school to be accepted by Harvard.
There, his interest in writing went
no further than a rejection from the
school's only Creative Writing
class.
"I took [the rejection] as a sign
to not do that," he said of his earli
er writing career. "I assumed that
meant I didn't have a calling."
But he and his friend Adiele
joked that someday they would re
pay their student loans by writing
"the hot Harvard novel."
Melcher had never seriously
considered writing a book until he
arrived at Stanford. It was here, en
rolled in the joint JD / MBA pro
gram, where Melcher rediscovered
his creative side.
While taking a course at the
Business School called Organiza
tional Behavior (which he dubs
"mind control") he began to won
der if a group of people could write
a novel.
Perhaps his lessons in organiza
tional behavior taught him some
thing.
In 1992, Melcher revived the idea
of writing a novel with Adiele, who
then contacted two of their class
mates from Harvard — Singer and
Sullivan — and they devised a story
line for their "hot Harvard novel."
They were inspired by the
Brown University scandal of 1986,
in which several female undergrad
uates were arrested for participat
ing in prostitution rings.
The group chose Spring Break
1992 as the test date for their new
project.

The group originally hoped to
write the entire novel in one week
at Bennett's parents' house, a week
that they now describe as an "orgy
scene."
Within seven days, they had a
complete chapter-by-chapter out
line and 100 pages of their first
draft. They were ready to send the
book to agents.

Although collaboration in writ
ing books is unusual, Melcher said
that it was a surprisingly easy part
of their project.
"Screenplays are written by

groups of people all the time," he
said "why should people think it's
strange for a group of people to
write a novel?"
Perhaps because it is almost
never done.
At the time, the authors were
using the pseudonym "Morgan
Diaz Lee" to keep the authorship
as gender and culturally neutral as
possible.
Morgan Diaz Lee was rejected
28 times by publishers.
While they waited to hear from
agents, the group communicated
via e-mail and telephone as they
constantly revised the book. Their
only inspiration was the fact that
"the rejection letters kept getting
nicer."

After their 29th submission.
Fate intervened in the form of Jon
Karp, an agent at Random House
and a member of the Brown class of
'86.
Barely 30, Karp was one the
youngest editors to read the book,
and Melcher suspects that this
worked to their advantage.
"The older editors didn't know
what to make of the different eth
nic, class and religious backgrounds
interacting together," Melcher
said.
"They thought it was nice that
we were trying to be PC," he said,
but they assumed that the multicul
tural nature of the book was too
"improbable for a novel. They
didn't buy the interracial dating."
Karp, however, realized that this
is a reality in college today. "Ulti
mately, the book is about college,"
Melcher said.
Karp had been looking for a
novel like "The Student Body," but
none had come his way. He liked
the multicultural elements and the
idea of sex and scandal within an
elite group. It was a combination
with a history of high sales.
However, the original "Student
Body" was a saga and Karp wanted
a thriller. He sent the foursome a
20-page, single space memorandum

detailing the changes they needed
to make. "A lot of people think that
editors go through and change your
writing line by line, but [Karp] gave
us more general comments."
Essentially, he wanted a new
book.
Melcher and his group set about
writing what would be the first of
nine revisions for Karp.
After nine drafts, the agent gave
his final suggestion: to change the
pseudonym from "Morgan Diaz
Lee" to a catchier name.
Melcher explained the business
motivation behind the switch:
"When an author has two names,
people aren't sure where to look for
the book," he said.
Also, he added, "books in the
last half of the alphabet tend to get
shelved in the back of the store."
About a hundred pseudonyms

betically near another famous
thriller-writer: John Grisham.
12 months after connecting with
Karp, their book was ready to be
sold in bookstores.
It had taken six years.

The book hit the stands at the
start of summer, and the group is
still working at the same jobs they
held before their venture into
novel-writing.
The four spend their spare time
trying to promote their book, or
preparing its sequel.
"All my life I had been encour
aged to be creative enough to be in
teresting, but that was [the extent)
it."
"1 spent a lot of time thinking
about my resume," Melcher said.
"With this, we all just kind of did

were sounded out before they set
tled on "Jane Harvard," the top
choice for several reasons.
First of all, the name is a pun on
the college's founder, John Har
vard. Secondly, people looking for
books on the university would be
likely to accidentally discover the
thriller.
Finally, with the last initial "H,"
their book would be shelved alpha

what we found interesting and fol
lowed our passion."
"After going through the list of
the 2,000 people who we know, we
just hope there are some people left
out there who will go into the store
and buy the book." Melcher said
jokingly.
But as he probably read before
he set foot in Harvard Yard, the
truth is often said in jest.
