## Rob Rakove: Budapest, Hungary McLanguage lessons

£"J"") ESZEL ANGOLUL?"
I-C The Hungarian phrase
M -9 for the question, "Do you
speak English?" is one of my few lin
guistic lifelines in Hungary. Usually
the question is answered with a
shrug, or a "nem," a no. If the con
versation is important, I will attempt
to communicate through my few
Hungarian phrases, written numbers
or symbols or that great universal
language, gestures.
Even gestures have their limits in
a foreign country. This morning,
while waiting for my tram to work. I
thought to catch a quick breakfast in
a Hungarian "cukraszada" — a bak
ery. Pointing and saying, very crude
ly, "one, please," is my usual formu
la for this situation, but this morning
the routine went awry. The girl be
hind the counter couldn't tell what I
was pointing at, and not knowing the
words for cherry strudel in Hungari
an, I was at a loss.
She seemed to gesture out the
door, and, thinking she wanted me to
point it out in the window display, I
turned to walk out of the shop. She
uttered a quick burst in Hungarian,
evidently thinking I was storming
out in disgust. Unable to explain
what I thought she had meant, all I
could do was repeat "sajnalom" —
sorry — and wonder if I had just con
tributed to some stereotype of
Americans as impatient or rude.
Here in Budapest, I am some
where in between a tourist and a res
ident. I have an eight-week intern
ship with the Hungarian Foreign
Ministry, where almost all of the em
ployees speak English rather fluent
ly. Outside of the Ministry is a differ
ent world for me, where my ability to
communicate is directly proportion
al to the patience of the other per
son. While I cannot converse with
anyone here who does not speak
English, 1 can pronounce Hungarian
words with some degree of accuracy.
My feelings of orientation here
are fickle, fleeting and easy prey for
the slightest accident. The other day,
I sat down in the cafeteria, in the
mood for some local cuisine (that
inood has passed: one can only eat so
much meat and potatoes). "Csirke
paprikas, kerem," I said, thinking I
was ordering chicken paprika. My
self-congratulatory mood lasted
around a minute; when chewing on a
piece of "chicken," I realized that
the flavor and texture seemed very
wrong. My stomach groaned as I re
alized that I was eating liver. Hence
forth, when in doubt, I say "nem
maj," and my server must then em
phatically convince me that there

isn't a trace of liver in the dish. Thus
far, my vigilance has paid off, though
it amuses the servers in the cafeteria.
While living in Hungary, I have
come to embrace activities and situ
ations involving the English lan
guage. When I'm not at work (read
ing American newspapers), I'm ei
ther reading or going to American
movies. More recently, when argu
ing with the staff at my dormitory, I
find myself responding to their com
plex Hungarian sentences with dec
larations in English. It doesn't help
the situation, but it makes me feel
more like an equal, even though they
have the power to evict mE at will.
What am I reading right now?
Not Kafka or Mann or any of the
other great Central European au
thors, but good old Stanford alum
John Steinbeck. Just as in Oxford,
where I treasured having the Stan
ford House as a retreat from the chill
and gloom of an English winter, I use
English here to help block out the
often incomprehensible world.
In a lot of ways, Budapest is mov
ing toward the West and toward a
more American-influenced identity.
Among Hungarian students, Eng
lish is the language of choice. English
captions are in place in major muse
ums. Most movies shown here have
Hungarian subtitles. Perhaps most
symbolically, McDonald's and Burg
er King restaurants are all over the
city.
Just yesterday, my boss decided
to take me out to lunch, not to a
Hungarian restaurant, but a local
Mickey-D's, where we discussed the
merits of the new Tropical Shake (in
a subsequent conversation, Mr.
Fodor happily told me he considers
Monica Lewinsky unattractive).
In another 20 or 30 years, I can
see this city becoming another Ams
terdam: a city where just about any
one you stop on the street will be
able to reply in English. The mis
communications and confusion that
are a part of my life here may be
come as rare in the new Hungary as
Communist flags.
Still, I doubt if Hungary will ever
become fully Americanized. The
powerful forces which have kept this
nation together for centuries, includ
ing the formidable Hungarian lan
guage, should guarantee that Hun
garian culture stays afloat in the ris
ing tide of globalization. If in the end
there are fewer "nem's" to my ques
tions, well so much the better for
everyone.
