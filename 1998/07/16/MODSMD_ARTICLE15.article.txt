## Courting a Stanford education 
### 
I'VE BEEN WINNING a lot at
basketball lately. Of course, this
greatly concerns me.
I am not a great basketball player.
I can pass OK and run the court a bit.
I hustle on defense and occasionally
get in a shooting zone and sink two
straight. But I stink one-on-one. On
the court, I have fewer moves than a
junior high kid from Oregon groov
ing to Vanilla Ice (here I am thinking
of everyone I knew in middle school).
At the hoop, I finish like the U.S. soc
cer team. Knowing this, I usually
avoid playing one-on-one, except
with a good friend of mine whom I'll
call "Matt." He has the basketball
knowledge of the Daily fax machine
and the athletic ability of my desk
lamp. Even against him, it often takes
me hours to score the 15 points I need
to win.
Imagine my surprise when I won
two games with strangers in the span
of a week.
First, I beat a pair of fifth-grade
~an nis campers. A few days later, I
knocked off a Hong Kong high school
student wearing long pants. Both
games were close, of course, but I was
proud to win nonetheless.
The wins bothered me, though,
and not just because I talked trash to
some elementary school kids. I knew
there was no natural way I could have
won both games. This led me to sus
pect 1) God patting me on the back
for spending last summer in Idaho or
2) foul play. I disregarded the first one

because I think I whined too much
about Boise to merit divine compen
sation. And thinking back on the
games, the second reason made a lot
of sense.
All three of my opponents, I now
know, had more on their minds than
basketball. They were searching for
some inside information, a high
placed contact who could pull some
strings. They all wanted to be Stan
ford students. And for some crazy
reason, they thought I could help.
The games all begin casually. "Do
you want to shoot around?" "Mind if
I play a little?" Innocent basketball
fun. The questions come slowly at
first. Are you a student here? What
do you study? (Campers: "What is
political science, anyway?" Me:
"Well, it's like government class, only
with more papers and lots of theories
that never really explain everything."
Them: "Oh. So tell us about the pre
med program.") Gradually, they gel
more personal. What are your grades
like? What were they in high school?
How did you do on the SATs? All
three of them, of course, have already
taken the test. How do their scores
match up?
With each question comes a little
"lapse" on defense. You got A's in
high school? Open lane for a lay-up.
Your admissions essay was about
baseball? Unguarded at the foul line.
The better the answers, the better the
scoring chances. Finally, game point
rolls around. My ball. One last ques

tion.
"What do I need to do to get into
Stanford?"
Luckily, it is too late. I'm already
so far ahead that 1 luckily sink a bas
ket within the next 10 possessions. I
win the game, and I never have to tell
them the secret. Actually, I do tell
them. They just don't believe me.
I have no idea how these kids are
going to get into Stanford. I don't
even know how 1 got into Stanford.
The hard truth. I tell the two 10-
year-olds who have already been ac
cepted to elite Los Angeles and
Miami private schools, is that there is
no magic Stanford formula. Sorry, I
tell the would-be mechanical engi
neer from Hong Kong, not even a
perfect SAT score assures you a spot.
I'm not sure anything, save perhaps il
licit pictures of Admissions Dean
Robert Kinnallv, will ensure your
place in a future Stanford class. All I
can say is, do your best. Challenge
yourself. Be a standout. Then get a lit
tie lucky, like me on that last shot.
Thanks, they all say. It was fun
playing and talking with you. And
they head off, looking for someone
else who might hold the key to Stan
ford.
I hope they run into "Matt."
There's no way they could ever let
him win.

thinks ht could beat Dean Kinnally in
a game to 11.
