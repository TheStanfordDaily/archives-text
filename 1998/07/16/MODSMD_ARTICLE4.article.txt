Holding your partner's hand lightly in your own, you
sail as the music confidently guides your steps across the
floor. Or at least that's how you wish it could be. Well,
Stanford has just the thing for you.
Last Friday marked the beginning of Stanford Dance
Week, a program in its tenth year. Titled Traditions and
Transitions, this year's workshop features vernacular
dance forms.
Over the last couple of years, the program has fo
cused on its popular Tango Week. According to Richard
Powers, director of Stanford Dance Week, the decision
to focus on one week that incorporates various dances
was made in an effort to avoid over- specialization.
By giving priority to the vernacular dance forms —
grass roots and street dances that come from all over the
world — the program offers something for every dance
taste. Powers said.
People have come from across the country to study
swing, waltz, Argentine tango and other tango tradi
tions, vintage ballroom, contemporary ballroom and
salsa style dancing.
Just as diverse as the program, the nine instructors
bring to their classes international backgrounds and
styles. On the more traditional end, students learn the
Contemporary American Waltz from Gail Barton. If
that's not quite fast enough, Powers and Angela Amar
illas will quicken the pace with the Bug and the Hustle.
Or for the more hip crowd, Jonathan Bixby can spice it
up with the Savoy Style Lindy Hop, 60s rock, surf danc
ing and early disco.
Every night after the eight-hour sessions have ended,
the social dance begins — accompanied by live music.

Wednesday is the exception, when the dancers get to
rest and be entertained by the Stanford Vintage Dance
Ensemble and Danse Libre. The week wraps up Friday
with the closing Black Tie Ball led by the Royal Society
Jazz Orchestra.
Although the program had to limit its enrollment,
Powers attempts to include everyone. "I don't think any
one should be turned away from a dance class."
The "love of dance and generosity of people" is what
makes Stanford Dance Week so wonderful, he said.
