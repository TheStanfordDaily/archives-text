# Stanford Symphony Orchestra
## 
### 
There are approximately 60 play
ers in the orchestra during summer
quarter, in comparison to the 70-75
who usually participate during the
school year. According to Giancarlo
Aquilanti, the conductor of the sum
mer orchestra, about 60 percent of
the Stanford Symphony Orchestra
members who play during the school
year also play during the summer.
Aquilanti has written a composi
tion specifically for the group's con
cert. He has named it "Jesi in Festa"
in tribute to joyful memories of the
tunes he grew up with as a child.
The composition he wrote is
based on the "light and happiness"
that was brought to his home-town
by an annual music festival. "Differ
ent bands came and played, choirs
sang and people enjoyed all differ

ent types of music," he said.
Because the orchestra's upcom
ing program revolves around the
theme of the joy of music, it will also
feature Copland's "El Salon Mexi
co."
The concert also celebrates
American tunes by incorporating
Dvorak's Symphony No. 9, titled
"From the New World," which Dvo
rak composed during a stay in the
United States in 1893.
Mozart's "Don Giovanni" will be
played as an introductory piece and
will feature Jeremy Henrickson.
Class of '98, as a guest conductor.
