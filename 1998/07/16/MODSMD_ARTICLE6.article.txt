# Stanford Summer Chorus
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer Chorus, a
continuation of the Stanford Sym
phonic Chorus that performs during
the year, will hold a concert at the
end of this month.
About 100 members comprise
the summer chorus, and about half
of them are members of the Sym
phonic Chorus during the year. The
rest of the summer group draws from
students, faculty and staff, as well as
high school students participating in
Stanford summer programs.
Director Akiko Fujimoto, Class
of '97, was invited to lead the chorus
by her former teacher, Choral Direc
tor Steve Sano.
According to Sano, Fujimoto is a
"gifted " music student and "will
make an excellent conductor."
After completing her first year at
Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, where she is working on
her masters in conducting, Fujimoto
is excited to be conducting the Stan
ford Summer Chorus.
"I've really enjoyed the interest

ing mixture of people. There is a dif
ferent crowd during the summer,"
she said. "A lot of people who don't
have time during the year come in
for the summer."
Fujimoto said that the summer
group is comprised of a broad range
of talents and backgrounds.
"The hardest thing about con
ducting a community group is that
you have to look for the common de
nominator," she said. "I try to make
sure that I don't leave people behind
and don't bore people either."
The chorus will perform Handel's
coronation anthem, entitled "Zado
ka the Priest," and Mozart's "Coro
nation Mass." The group will be ac
companied by an orchestra that will
perform Beethoven's "First Sym
phony."
