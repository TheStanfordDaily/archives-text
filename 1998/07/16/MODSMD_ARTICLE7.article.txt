## Band serenades China Members play at beer fest, rally on Great Wall 
### Anand Venkatesan 
Although popular perceptions of
the Chinese government and the
free-spirited Stanford Band could not
seem more divergent, the Band re
cently traveled to China upon invita
tion from the Chinese government.
The improbable partnership that
culminated in a nine day tour of
China earlier this month was initiated
by an invitation to appear at the
eighth annual Qingdao International
Beer Festival. Along with the Band,
several Chinese bands and the Dan
ish band "Greve Pigegarde" were
present at the festivities held at the
Qingdao Tourist Resort in Shandong
Province.
The Band ended up going to
China after the Chinese government
viewed the Band's Web site and con
tacted Band Manager Claire Bacher.
"They were looking for a West
Coast marching band that would be
enjoyable at a beer festival," Bacher
said. After receiving videotape
footage of previous Band perfor
mances and a copy of its compact disc.

the Chinese government decided that
the Stanford Band would be fitting.
While the primary purpose of the
trip was to participate in the Qingdao
International Beer Festival, the
group's experiences in mainland
China were hardly limited to that.
When not performing, band mem
bers toured China, giving the group a
chance to interact with citizens and
partake in Chinese culture. Band
members visited Tiananmen Square,
Ming's Tomb, the Emperor's Sum
mer Palace, the Forbidden City, the
Temple of Heaven and the Under
ground Palace.
The group even held one of its fa
mous rallies on the Great Wall of
China. This experience proved to be
the highlight of the trip for many of
the 40 members who went.
The band members' personal in
teractions with Chinese citizens also
provided cultural lessons.
"I am not Michael Jordan," chuck
led Will Taylor, a junior and alto sax
ophone player, on his role in what was
the first exposure for many of the Chi
nese to African Americans.

Taylor, whose shaved head and
dark complexion made him the fre
quent subject of mistaken identity,
was struck by the reaction of the Chi
nese toward him, the Dollies and
other members of the Band.
"People would come up to us all
the time and ask to get their pictures
taken with us," Taylor said.
Other band members noticed
some irony in their celebrity. "It was
funny knowing that we were repre
senting America, even though we are
totally a misrepresentation of Ameri
ca," said Lani Ludwick, a junior and
Dollie.
The vast majority of the trip went
smoothly, with the exception of an ac
cident during the second day of per
formances at the Qingdao Brewery.
While the Band was on stage, a
fireworks display set up beneath
them was inadvertently set off, spray
ing fireworks into the Band. A few
band members suffered minor in
juries, ranging from burns to shock,
and they were treated on the scene.
Damage was also done to uniforms
and instruments. Due to safety con

cerns, the Band canceled its third and
final appearance.
As for the Band's conduct in a
Communist country, a packet given
to members before departure humor
ously summed up the situation with
the trademark light-hearted tone and
easygoing humor that has brought
the Band so much attention in the
past. Listed under the category titled

"What not to do" was the following
advice — "Anything that comes nat
urally to you as a band member."
Bacher said the Chinese excursion
may lead to more trips in the future.
"It's our first trip overseas in 10
years or so, and everyone seems to
have really enjoyed themselves," she
said. "We'll probably try to do some
thing like this again."
