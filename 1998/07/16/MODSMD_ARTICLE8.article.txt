American Express leaves Tresidder
Stanford and American Express have reached a new agreement which
will result in closing the office currently located on the second floor of Tresid
der Memorial Union.
Students, faculty and staff may now use the American Express office on
University Avenue to arrange personal travel. The University Avenue office
will have a desk to serve members of the Stanford community.
The agreement will also move American Express staff who currently
have offices in Encina Hall to the company's location in Los Altos. These
employees, who handle business travel for faculty and administrators, as well
as specialized services for athletic teams, will continue to do so from the Los
Altos office.
The agreement now frees space for new tenants in Tresidder and Encina
Hall. The Tresidder Advisory Board, which consists of students and admin
istrators, will be working with Dean of Students Marc Wais to decide how
the newly freed space will be filled.
Blood Center runs low
The Stanford Medical Blood Center has recovered from a shortage of A
negative and O negative type blood, following a stint of high usage.
"We've had fabulous support from the community," said Blood Center
spokeswoman Caryn Huberman. "We are well above minimum inventory
in all our blood types."
The crisis at the Stanford center was due to high usage, but was also af
fected by shortages across the country. "We had been running below mini
mum of all blood types for three weeks because of high usage," Huberman
said. "Supplies were reasonable, but low."
After July 4, the center completely ran out of type A negative and O neg
ative blood. According to Huberman, the center occasionally runs low on
blood, but it is usually able to obtain auxiliary supplies from other centers
across the country. The center received some blood from Rhode Island, but
other locations were not able to help out.
"All the people who gave are to be thoroughly thanked for helping these
local patients, for literally saving their lives," she said.
