# ASSU in gear for summer

### Kenny Shei 
For the first time in recent memory, the ASSU Senate
conducted a summer meeting last Thursday. Several sen
ators and ASSU Vice President Santos Marroquin were
present to discuss upcoming ASSU projects.
Marroquin and ASSU President Maren Norton felt
that there were enough senators in the Stanford area to
make a summer meeting worthwhile. "There's a lot of
stuff for us to do this summer," Marroquin said.
In an effort to include every senator, ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Mike Levin has been talking with off-cam
pus senators who could not attend the meeting to see what
projects and issues interest them.
As discussed at the meeting, a major focus of this
ASSU Senate will be helping students to effectively voice
their opinions. Controversial university decisions affect
ing students, such as those made to undergraduate hous
ing this past spring, have caused the student voice issue to
move to the forefront of students' concerns.
According to Marroquin, "The administration is not
against the students. Students have opinions about differ
ent university decisions [concerning them], but the mech
anisms currently aren't there for the university to effec
tively receive their input."
Presently, the ASSU is working on a Web site where
students can post comments about issues going on in the
university. Levin, who is working on the ASSU Web site,
said the student voice Web site will be one of the top links
on the ASSU Web site.
The ASSU is also revamping its current Web site.
Levin has recently updated some outdated information
and plans on having a page with links for online banking
and the time schedule. Additionally, the site will include
links to other ASSU projects such as the ASSU Course

Guide and the Student Voice Website.
The site would also announce major upcoming issues
so that students would have a chance to comment, and the
administration would subsequently be able to respond to
student input. "We're hoping to finish this project in the
summer so that once the school year comes, the ASSU
can focus on dealing with actual student issues," Levin
said.
The ASSU is also continuing work on the ASSU
Course Guide. Norton is coordinating the project with in
dividual academic departments, and the ASSU has hired
one full-time student and one part-time student to work
on the course guide.
Marroquin emphasized that on the guide's Web-based
version, students can make suggestions for improve
ments. "This is not a totally internal project — we want
student input," Marroquin said.
In addition, the ASSU is continuing to work on the
graduate housing crisis.
Already, the University has filled slots for the leases it
acquired in the Sharon Green units in Menlo Park and
Oak Creek units in Palo Alto. The ASSU is continuing to
work on finding more graduate housing by assisting Hous
ing and Dining Services in the search for other subsidized
off-campus sites.
"We need to emphasize [to landlords] the notion that
graduate students are good tenants. Typically they will be
in the area for a while, and they are pretty responsible peo
ple," Marroquin said.
Senators at last Thursday's meeting also considered re
forming ASSU elections, specifically ways of limiting
fliers without violating free speech.
Regarding the Senate's ongoing projects, Levin said,
"We've got our act in gear. Students will be surprised to
learn what [the ASSU has] done over the summer."
