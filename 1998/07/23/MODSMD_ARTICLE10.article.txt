UCSF and Stanford Hospitals receive accolades
For the ninth time, Stanford University Hospital and UC-San Francis
co Medical Center were recently listed in the top 10 of U.S. News & World
Report's annual rankings of the nation's hospitals.
"It's very competitive, and so 1 think it's significant that both were
ranked in the top 10," said Daniel Berman, news director for UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care.
Of the 1,985 eligible hospitals in the country, 132 made the final rank
ings. Hospitals were judged based on reputation in each of 16 specialties,
mortality rates and general data, such as the number of nurses and the kind
of technology available to patients.
Stanford was ranked in the top 10 for cancer, cardiology and urology
treatment and in the top 20 in 10 other categories. UCSF claimed top-10
spots in cancer, endocrinology and gastroenterology and top 20 spots in
seven other specialties.
Stanford ranked No. 7 overall, moving up one spot from last year, while
UCSF dropped three spots to No. 10. Berman said one of the reasons
UCSF fell in the rankings may have been that U.S. News decided not to in
clude AIDS as one of the specialties considered this year. UCSF was listed
as one of the top five hospitals in that specialty last year.
U.S. News reported that the reason AIDS treatment was not included
this year was because most patients now go to clinics or other non-hospital
sources for treatment.
Berman noted that the reason Stanford and UCSF are so successful is
because "they are affiliated with academic institutions, and they are able
to translate medical research into clinical practice."
