# Dissecting virtual frogs
## 
### Suzanne Bohan 
When a group of Stanford re
searchers recently announced the
availability of a "virtual frog" for
teaching students about vertebrate
biology, many reports heralded the
computerized creature as a welcome
alternative to traditional dissection.
But Ramani Pichumani, manager
of the Virtual Creatures Project at
Stanford, said that enlivening biology
education, not replacing dissection, is
primarily what researchers have in
mind. "If you really want to learn how
an animal lives, you have to go be
yond dissection," Pichumani said.
The virtual frog is the first of many
"virtual vertebrates" planned for de
velopment by the Stanford Universi
ty Medical Media and Information
Technologies Group, part of Stan
ford's School of Medicine. This first
project was funded by a $125,(XX)

grant from the National Science
Foundation.
The Stanford group initiated the
Virtual Creatures project in 19% with
the aim of improving high school bi
ology education. The group was con
cerned about the decline in number
of students pursuing careers in the sci
ences and also noted the financial
struggle many high schools had in
providing resources for teaching sci
ence. Frogs for dissection, for exam
ple, cost approximately $6 and a pre
served cat more than $25.
As the project evolved, the group
expanded its initial focus beyond a
computerized view of the inner work
ings of a frog. The researchers real
ized that students need not only to
memorize organs and tissues but also
to understand how a frog interacts
with its environment. This led to the
creation of "Frog Island," which pro
vides a three-dimensional world for

students to explore.
"What we're really trying to do is
motivate kids by creating an engaging
interactive learning environment that
captures their imagination," Pichu
mani said.
Pichumani said biology in the past
has emphasized "rote learning."
While "it's important to know vocab
ulary," he said, having a "conceptual
framework and then overlaying the
facts is a much better way to learn.
"We're visual creatures, so if we
can visualize connections between an
animal and its environment, that
strengthens our understanding,"
Pichumani said.
Dr. W. Le√üoy Heinrichs, medical
consultant on the project and profes
sor emeritus at Stanford's School of
Medicine, said the virtual world can
never replace some aspects of hands
on work. He recalls students describ
ing the "awesome experience" of

opening up a preserved animal.
Unfortunately, tissue from these
animals is easily torn during dissec
tion, Heinrichs noted. Thus students
can "lose a sense of structure and de
sign."

When students work first on a vir
tual creature, he added, that becomes
a "wonderful preparation for actual
dissection."
Pichumani agreed. "It is a way to
build up their confidence."
