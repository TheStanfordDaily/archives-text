# SYESP encourages students to study environment

For a group of 22 California high school
students, the impact of a six-week summer
program held on the Stanford campus will be
felt well into the future. The high schoolers are
participants in the Stanford Youth Environ
mental Science Program (SYESP), the brain
child of co-founders Michael McCullough, a
Rhodes Scholar and member of the Class of
'89, and Ana Mallari, a Stanford Law School
student.
Now in its fifth year, the program provides
leadership and education for gifted, low-in
come, predominantly minority students con
cerned with the environment. All past partici
pants have gone on to enroll and remain in col
lege.
Over the past two years, more than 75 per
cent of the program's participants have later
matriculated at Stanford.
Modeled after the Stanford Medical Youth
Science Program, co-founded by McCullough

and Stanford alumnus Marc Lawrence, the
aims of the program are wide in scope and de
cidedly fixed on the future.
"We are able to expose the students to a lot
of different professional ways of thinking
[and) paradigms that professors bring, and the
environment underlies it all," Mallari said.
The interests of the students vary, and ac
cordingly, presentations by lecturers and pro
fessors encompass an array of topics. "We
have environmental law [and] environmental
biology," Mallari said. "We talk to [Stan
ford's] Economics Department, and they do
things on environmental economics."
Students' experiences range from public
speaking and SAT instruction to aikido and
reflection time. Each student is part of a spe
cific track — health, law or engineering — and
is exposed to a series of speakers and experi
ences pertaining to the track.
Santiago Rizzo, a high school senior from
Berkeley, chose the law track, through which
he had the opportunity to visit the California

Supreme Court. Justice Joyce L. Kennard be
came an inspirational figure for him.
"She went through a lot when she was a
child and still managed to climb to the top of
the top," Rizzo said.
Apart from personal enrichment and lec
tures from speakers, including former Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy and Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid Robert Kinnal
ly, the students are expected to devise and un
dertake an outreach project in which they im
prove their own communities.
Thea Carlson, a student from Santa Cruz,
sees room for improvement in her city's recy
cling program, and plans to use the outreach
project to address the issue. "I'm trying to use
the example of Berkeley and San Francisco's
recycling programs to persuade Santa Cruz to
place recycle bins by the trash receptacles in
town," Carlson said.
All expenses for students are financed
through fundraising by McCullough and Mal
lari. Lecturers and the University donate time

and classroom facilities.
The intimate family atmosphere is a key
component of the program. "What I want
would be that they take the trust and love they
feel here and apply it in college and to their
dreams," said Liz Schwartz, associate director
and third-year staff member.
The program s relationship with the stu
dents continues through college. Having
helped raise more than $2 million dollars in fi
nancial aid last year for its students, the pro
gram has made college a reality for its capable,
financially underserved students.
The admissions process is rigorous. This
year, intensive interviewing was employed to
whittle the list of 450 applicants down to the
final 22 students. "We choose students not
only for need and intellect, but for hunger, al
truism, empathy and drive." said McCul
lough.
The program is in its final week of this
year's session with graduation ceremonies
slated for Sunday.
