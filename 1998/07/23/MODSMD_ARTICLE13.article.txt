With Chad Hutchinson lost to baseball,
three talented but inexperienced quarterbacks
shoot for the starting job

Stanford entered the 1997 football season with Rose Bowl
hopes and a hot young quarterback. One year and a 5-6 record
later, the quarterback is throwing baseballs in New Jersey and
the team is predicted to finish near the bottom of the Pacific 10
Conference.
Chad Hutchinson is gone. But for the three men vying to re
place him, hope remains.
"With guys leaving, you have to see that as an opportunity,"
said redshirt sophomore Todd Husak, who is seeking the start
ing quarterback job along with redshirt freshmen Randy Fasani
and Joe Borchard.
Each of the three men believes he will be on the field when
the Cardinal kicks off its season Sept. 5 against San Jose State.
Husak emerged from spring drills as the designated starter, but
that won't mean much when training camp opens in August.
"It's still a dogfight," said first-year Offensive Coordinator
Bill Diedrick. "It's Todd's position, but Randy is still there chas
ing on his heals."
Diedrick took over the Cardinal attack from Dana Bible,
now the offensive coordinator of the NFL's Philadelphia Ea
gles, in February. He inherited an offense that lost six starters
and 11 lettermen from 1997, including its quarterback and all
four main running backs. Junior flanker Troy Walters is the
only player left on the team who touched the ball significantly
last year.
"There are a lot of diapers in that backfield," Diedrick said.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Diedrick is an expert in quar
terback potty training. In 27 years of coaching, he has helped de
velop such big-name signal callers as Drew Bledsoe, John Friesz

and Damon Huard. The big question at Stanford may not be if
he'll produce a star, but who it will be.
In Husak, Fasani and Borchard, Diedrick has three
prospccts long on talent hut short on experience. Husak is the
only one to have played in a college football game, completing
37 of 78 passes for 582 yards last year at the end of games and in
relief for the injured Hutchinson.
The presence of Hutchinson, who ranks seventh on the Stan
ford career passing yards list with 4,235, confined Husak to a
strictly backup role in 1997. But when the two-sport star signed
a $3.25 million contract to pitch for the St. Louis Cardinals in
June, Husak finally had his chance.
The oldest and most experienced of the trio, Diedrick said
Husak stands out for his intelligence and maturity on the field.
The starter's job is his to lose.
Husak know this. He also knows that another season carry
ing the backup's clipboard would be difficult. He is confident
that won't be the case.
"I've proven to myself that I'm a great player and I can over
come anything," he said. "My intelligence and leadership ex
tend far enough that I can take this team where it needs to go."
In contrast, Fasani is a superb athlete whose greatest liabili
ty is his relative unfamiliarity with the Cardinal offense. Fasani
is a creative player who makes things happen, Diedrick said.
"He's much more athletic, more physical."
Fasani believes his comfort with the offense grows every day.
At the start of spring drills" I was really confused," he said. ""By
the end, I felt confident that 1 could show my talent without wor
rying about the play."
Both men improved greatly in spring practice, Diedrick said,
and he hopes for a similar gain over the summer. For their part,
the players are working out three or four hours a day.

"Todd's a great player," Fasani said, "but right now, my
dreams have a chance to become reality."
Borchard is the X-factor and the quarterback who bears the
most resemblence to Hutchinson. He, too, balances baseball
and football. Like his good friend and sometimes-mentor, Bor
chard missed spring drills to play with the Cardinal nine. As a
result, he is well behind Fasani and Husak in terms of experi
ence.
That's about all he's missing. Teammates are in awe of his
athletic ability. "Joe has got the best arm I've ever seen in my
life," Husak said. "Physically, he's ready."
After a disappointing end to his baseball season — the Car
dinal was eliminated in the West regional and missed the Col
lege World Series — Borchard turned almost immediately to
football.
"I think I'm coming up to speed," Borchard said. "It's been
a quick transition."
The ties that bind the three men are many. Husak mentored
Fasani on the bench last season. Borchard identifies with
Fasani's athleticism and lack of experience. Most importantly,
all three are friends. There is no bitter rivalry here, just three
competitors out for the same job.
"We get along really well," Borchard said. "We spend so
much time together that we have to get along."
"There's no ill will among us," Husak said. "I think we all un
derstand we're here to help the team."
The team doesn't seem to have a preference, at least pub
licly.
"There's nothing bad about any of them," said redshirt
sophomore Russell Stewart, the starting tight end who figures
to catch a lot of passes this fall. "I don't think anyone is worried
about the quarterback position."
