## Synchro coach goes out on top 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Vickey Weir's team finally won a
national title in 1998. Now, Stan
ford's head synchronized swimming
coach knows just what she wants: to
spend more time with her family and
have "dry, warm feet."
Weir, who has been with the team
since it was founded in 1979, an
nounced her retirement from coach
ing Monday. Stanford's synchro pio
neer, she has been instrumental in
seeing the sport develop from an in
formal gathering of a few students, to
a club sport and, ultimately, to a na
tionally-ranked varsity team.
Last year, Weir led the team to a
national title in which the Cardinal
defeated long-time champion Ohio
State, Weir's alma mater.
Also to her credit are IS top-five
national finishes and 12 Western Re
gional championships.
"She and her husband, [Asst.
Coach Andy Maisel], have been a
terrific team. We're leally sad to see
them go," said Athletic Director Ted
Leland.
"Without them there wouldn't be
a synchro program at the level there
is now," Leland added.
Diving coach and long-time col
league Richard Schavone echoed
Leland.
"Her dedication made synchro
into a varsity sport," he said. "She did
it out of love for it. For many years
she was worked as hard as any coach
of a fully funded varsity team."
Weir has built a winning team
while simultaneously holding a vari

ety of nursing positions at the UCSF-
Stanford Medical Center, where she
has been employed since 1976. Cur
rently a nursing educator, she trains
nurses and works on specific pro
jects.
Schavone stressed that Weir's
work schedule, coupled with the
busy pool schedule, often meant that
the team practiced at "odd hours" in
the mornings and on Sundays.
"She made tremendous sacrifices
to make that team good" Schavone
said. "Ninety-nine percent of the suc
cess of the team was because of the
energy she put into it."
Weir explained her decision to re
tire from coaching saying that "the
coaching position is a full-time job."
"I'm going to spend more time at
the hospital, spend some time with
family and even have time to read a
book instead of working eight days a
week," Weir said.
Weir called the national title the
highlight of her career.
"Winning the national champi
onship was an absolutely incredible
experience. My husband and I —our
goal was to win a national champi
onship and with the help of the Ath
letics Department and the athletes
we achieved it," Weir said.
As she prepares for life after
coaching, Weir emphasized that she
will miss working closely with the
athletes.
"The support that synchronized
swimming, the support for women's
athletics and the support that I as a
female coach have received has just
been excellent. 1 feel very lucky," she
said.
