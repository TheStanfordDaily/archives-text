## EVE6 exudes suburbia Sounds like Sublime and the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
### 
If you're into the "disaffected youth,"
grunge or punk music, then EVE 6 just
might be the band you're looking for.
Although these guys are at times too heavy
on the electric guitar, they manage to pro
duce a grooving sound.
They sound a bit like Sublime, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers and a thousand other bands
whose music I've heard but whose names I
can't remember.
The downside of EVE 6 is that most of the
lyrics do appear meaningless at first glance.
The same goes for the drawing of a human
heart with arrows slicing through, which is
plastered on the the album's back cover. But,
aesthetics aside, they've got a good sound.
And yes, much of the band's music does
exude that "bored teenagers living in the sub
urbs flavor," (this is best demonstrated in
what should be the group's signature song,
"Small town trap").
The bond's hit song, "Inside Out" is defi
nitely worth listening to. Though this may be
the one that radio stations love to overplay,
"Showerhead" is probably the track that car
ries the album.
If I listened to only the first minute of this
song, I, too, would think it was not that great.
However, give it some time, and "Shower
head" will only start to sound better. It brings
in the guitar on several songs and manages to

use it well rather than to
abuse it.
"Showerhead" is the
song that reminds me the

most of the Chili Peppers.
However, if you're looking for something a
little slower and more relaxed check out
"Jesus Nitelite."
A final word of caution: don't try to under
stand this band or what it sings about; if you
do that you'll probably miss what is more im
portant: its music.
