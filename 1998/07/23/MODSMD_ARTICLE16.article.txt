Even if you are only considering
applying to graduate schools, you
should check out "The Grad School
Handbook" by Richard and Margot

Jerrard (SI4.(X), Perigree Books).
The Jerrards have both had long careers in graduate
studies. They have not only "made the crucial admissions
decisions," but they have also "helped many students
through all stages from beginning the search to receiving
the degree." They "have the insider's point of view and can
tell you what really happens and how decisions are made in
side the universities."
" The Grad School Handbook" includes tips on writing
a winning essay and getting good references, finding re
sources for financial aid, preparing for the GRE, MCAT,
LS AT and GM AT exams and how to succeed once you are
in graduate schcx)l.
This b(H)k is certain to be an asset to prospective gradu
ate students because it is user-friendly.
This book is filled with advice and quotes from directors
of graduate admissions and faculty in all fields. Success and
failure stories are featured as well as anecdotes from ma
triculated graduate students in all areas and concentrations.
"The Grad School Handbook" is divided into three
parts: "First things," "Applying" and "You are in." The
first two sections help the student locate information on dif
ferent programs, applyingand financial aid. The last section
is geared toward advising the newly admitted student and
exposing some of the pitfalls and traps during the first few
years of graduate school.
For the student's convenience, there are helpful lists of
postal mailing,e-mail and Internet addresses of references,
testing centers, financial aid sources and guidebooks at the
end of the book.
