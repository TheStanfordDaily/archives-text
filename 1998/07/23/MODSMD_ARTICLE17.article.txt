# Barenaked Ladies
## 
### 
Most bands with a widely-acclaimed
album pray to the music gods that their
next album will at least be comparable to the
previous one. If not, they will disappoint mil
lions of fans. Sadly, the new Barenaked
Ladies album "Stunt" doesn't make the cut.
Following the band's live album of great
est hits entitled "Rock Spectacle," the album
"Stunt" leaves much to be desired. "Stunt"
still sports the band's cleverly absurd lyrics
coupled with genuine musical ability, but the
creative juices aren't flowing in full force.
"One Week," the first track on the album,
is the only song reminiscent of trademark

Barenaked Ladies. Its
fast-paced vocal babblings
hint of the playfulness and
fun of the group's first
album, "Gordon." How-

ever, the rest of the new album takes a differ
ent turn.
Many songs are mellower than previous
efforts, and most are not as catchy as those on
the first album. Ballads and slow retrospec
tives result in a more mature but simultane
ously limited set of tunes.
The group has both narrowed its range of
musicality and thinned its library of subject
material, settling into the trap of themes of
love and loss. Still, it manages to approach
each song from a slightly skewed angle, show
ing traces of a still-active creativity.
"Alcohol" is a darkly comedic tune tout
ing the benefits of the ill-gotten drink ingredi
ent, while "In the Car" reviews a night of al
most-sex in the back seat of the narrator's car.
With the exception of a few hit singles, the
Canadian band has enjoyed a largely under
ground following in the United States thus
far. Perhaps this audience will, by default,
continue to support the band's efforts, but the
group will have to wait until its next album if
it wants to break into the American main
stream.
