# Brandy's new sound
## 
### 
Brandy has
grown up since
her 1994 debut
album, "Brandy."

Her first album's hits "I Wanna Be
Down" and "Baby" painted the pic
ture of an inexperienced young girl
with surprisingly strong vocal skills.
Her songs were full of hopeful illu
sions about first love and relation
ships. Her sophomore album "Never
Say Never," reflects many of the
changes in this singer's life, musically
and romantically.
In the four years since her debut,
19-year-old Brandy has graced the
covers of magazines because of her
hit songs and her recently ended rela
tionship with Wanya Morris of the
R&B group Boyz II Men.
Many of the songs in her new
album focus on the pain of a failed re
lationship and a few seem quite bit
ter. In one song, Brandy sings "Al
most made you love me / almost
made you cry I almost touched your
heart / didn't I didn't I" and then re
minds us that 'almost doesn't count'.
In "Learn the hard way" she sings
about dumping someone — "It's a
shame you had to learn the hard way
/ now I have to take my love away/
you could have made it easy / for you
to become a part of me."

A whole new production staff
worked on this album and for the first
time Brandy penned and co-pro
duced most of her songs. Known for
bubble gum sweet songs. Brandy
changes pace in "Top of the World"
where she sings a duet with rapper
Mase. The songs on "Never Say
Never" are much less tentative than
on her debut album; her assured atti
tude can be heard in her duet with
Monica "The Boy Is Mine."
Gone are the twangy guitar solos.
The music on this album is more ex
otic and full of bass and drumbeats.
Brandy's voice is more mellow and
relaxed as she opts for breathy solos
and a more mature approach to her
art.
