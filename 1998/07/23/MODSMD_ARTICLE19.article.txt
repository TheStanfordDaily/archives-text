# Saving Private Ryan
## 
### 
You might say that Steven Spielberg is the
king of World War II movies.
It's not just because he directed and pro
duced the Oscar-winning "Schindler's List" and

the famous "Indiana Jones" series. In his latest film, "Saving Private
Ryan," Spielberg brings his grittiest realism ever to his portrayal of World
War 11.
"Saving Private Ryan" is the story of Americans experiencing war torn
Europe. The film begins with a horrifying, half-hour-long depiction of D-
Day. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is one of the officers who must
watch his men be slaughtered while carrying out orders to take Omaha
Beach. The scene sets the dark mood of the rest of the film — prepare to
clench your teeth every time a soldier takes off his helmet.
Miller is placed in command of a small unit whose mission is to find a
soldier named James Ryan (Matt Damon) and get him safely out of
France. Ryan's three brothers have died in combat, and the generals want
his life spared for the sake of his mother.
Thanks to a terrific supporting cast, we quickly become attached to the
eight men, from the hard-edged Private Reiben (Edward Burns) to the
cowardly Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). As they head deeper inland
and risk their lives, they question the reasoning behind the mission to save
one man. And once they find Ryan, they learn that their troubles have only
begun.
The imagery is fantastic from the green pastures to the smoking ruins of
the Norman villages. The battle scenes were shot with 90-degree shutters,
and part of the color was removed during post-production, giving the film
a gritty appearance that Spielberg likened to newsreel footage.
Spielberg's dedication to realism also makes the movie extremely vio
lent; there's enough blood and gore to put some Vietnam movies to shame.
"Saving Private Ryan" is a step away from both the melancholy of Oscar
Schindler and the heroics of Indiana Jones, but for a few precious mo
ments, I could have sworn that I was actually there.
