# 'Oz' plays at the Orpheum
## Eartha Kitt and Mickey Rooney dazzle audiences 
### 
"The Wizard of Oz" has arrived
again, this time on stage at the Or
pheum Theater in San Francisco.
The 90-minute musical, starring
Mickey Rooney and Eartha Kitt, is
quite pleasant, but its short length is
both a blessing and a curse. Some peo
ple may be happy to escape the overly
moralizing life lessons after just an
hour-and-a-half, while others may re
gret the fact that there is not much
substance to the plot.
The story is a straight adaptation
from the 1939 MGM movie of the
same title. There are, however, a few
nice twists to the original story. For ex
ample, the apple trees surrounding the
Tin Man and the crows pestering the
Scarecrow all have a '90s attitude.
The special effects are particularly
good. One of the most engaging
scenes comes early in the show when
Dorothy and Toto are swept up in the
twister. The entire audience is en
gulfed in the storm with its lightning,
smoke and flying houses.
Another great scene is when
Dorothy's house lands on top of the
Wicked Witch in the Land of Oz. This
colorful number filled with
munchkins is easily one of the best of
the production. The costumes are
great and the musical number in
volves almost the entire cast. From
that point on, the production loses its
pace and everything turns a little
more grim as Dorothy follows the yel
low brick road on her way to see the
Wizard of Oz.
Kitt, who has been twice nominat
ed for a Tony Award, delivers an ex
cellent performance as the Wicked
Witch of the West. Rooney, who plays
the Wizard of Oz, is likewise no
stranger to acting, having starred in
more than 50 feature films. Both Kitt
and Rooney are endearing in their
performances but they can't compen

sate for the lackluster pace of the rest
of the story. Dorothy is played by Ift
year-old Jessica Grove who has a
great singing voice. Of course, I could
not forget to mention the dog. whose
performance was also impeccable.
This production of "The Wizard of

Oz" made its debut in New York in
May of 1997. Because of the tremen
dous success of the show, it is now
touring the United States and Canada.
It will remain in San Francisco
through August 2.
