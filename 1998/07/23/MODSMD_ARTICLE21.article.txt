# 'Zorro' returns to Old California
## 
### 
tnPhe Mask Of Zorro," the latest
A epic-adventure film from direc
tor Martin Campbell, stars Anthony
Hopkins and Antonio Banderas and is
rife with romance and action.

Rather than using computer-generated action, "Zorro" re
lies on real whips, swords and only a few stunt-doubles. The
masked avenger swings from balcony to balcony, and duels his
enemies with a sword —providing action far more exciting than
:x>mputer-generated asteroids slamming into a graphic land
>cape.
The action begins when the original Zorro (Hopkins) drives
the tyrannical governor, don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson
II) out of 19th century California. That same evening, Zorro
iuffers a tragic capture and winds up in prison where he spends
the next 20 years of his life.
By the time he escapes, he is too old to continue in his role as

a folk hero. He decides to recruit a thief (Banderas) who has a
personal grudge against don Rafael and the newer enemy. Cap
tain Harrison Love (Matthew Letscher), to take over the job of
Zorro.
When don Rafael returns to California with a scheme to take
over Mexico and enslave its people, both Zorros have their
work cut out. To complicate things a little more, Don Rafael's
daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta Jones), is an amorous interest
of the younger Zorro.
The actors in this film performed their own sword-fights, and
Hopkins did his own tricks with the whip. He picked up this skill
while working on the set of "The Edge" and as a student at the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the United Kingdom. Zeta
Jones, also a British native, is a relative newcomer to American
cinema. However, she suffers no culture shock. Wilson's por
trayal of don Rafael is also excellent. While his character is self
ish and brutal, he manages to make the audience pity him.

The sets and scenery in this film are all magnificent. The
gold-mine set was so realistic that few people were allowed on
it while filming because it was deemed Ux> dangerous.
"The Mask Of Zorro" is a great film about one of the world's
best-known fictional heroes, proving that even classic tales can
use a little fine-tuning.
