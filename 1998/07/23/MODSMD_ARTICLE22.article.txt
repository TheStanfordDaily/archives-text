## Evan Nordby: Globetrotter Kung Pao Muzak 
### 
I'M SITTING ON a stool in The
Sussex Arms pub, just down the
street from Paddington Station
in London. I'm surrounded by well
worn oak walls and furnishings with
a pint of Tetley's bitter ale on the
coaster in front of me. Queen's "Bo
hemian Rhapsody" just came on the
jukebox. I'm thinking, "And now for
something completely different...
My trumpet and I recently sur
vived the Stanford Band's 10-day
jaunt to the People's Republic of
China. Now, to the outside observer,
dropping the Stanford Band into the
land of the Cultural Revolution
might appear to be a crude Western
imperialist plot. The sort likely to
create the charter members of the
Stanford Alumni Rock-Breaking
Association, Gobi Desert chapter.
fm here to say rock-breaking
isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. OK,
so no one went to be re-educated.
The ( hinese people who gathered to
watch our first rally, under hazy su
shine atop The Great Wall, seemed
entertained, if a bit bemused. They
politely applauded. We had a blast
also We just played on THE
GREAT WALL OF CHINA! The
crowd even included a couple of po
lice officers. At least I think they
were police officers. It takes going to
a countr\ where you can't read any
thing but "Coca-Cola" to notice that
everyone from skycaps to generalis
simos wears the same uniform.
Our appearance on Chinese tele
vision s "A ioyiul Gathering" was
also entertaining... for us, seated in
the studio audience. I suppose our
two-song set on the tie-dyed stage
pleased the crowd also, but picture
this: You're in the CoHo with a
group of friends, drinking heartily.
You, Mr Hot Stuff, stand up to
pound a glass of Bud, when sudden
ly, at the nex table, Barbara Bush in
vinyl hot pants and a red halter leaps
up ano quaffs a pitcher of Guinness
in one gulp, while the entire crowd
waves green Glo-Sticks in time.
Chinese television was kind of
like that, including the Glo-Sticks.
At this point, you must under
stand. apparently about six months
ago, an enterprising record execu
tive sold China a CD anthology of
"America's Greatest Easy Listening
Hits.' The only American songs in
the country are "My Heart Will Go
On." "Memories," a glockenspiel
cover of "Yesterday,"the theme
from "Love Story" and a couple of
Kenny C tunes. In any case, whenev
er we boarded the bus, one of these
songs was on Restaurants' and gro

cery stores' troubles were so far
away. Walking past a clothing store,
its heart would be goooooooing
onrinnnnn.
Back to hot pants. With this musi
cal indoctrination, when a man in a
red tuxedo and two ballet dancers
appeared amid wisps of smoke on
stage, we expected a passionate
power ballad.
We got it all right. "Love Story."
Whistled.
Yes sireeee, belted out like a
bluebird. Suddenly, we weren't the
weirdest people around anymore.
Whistling Man was followed in
quick succession by a man playingon
his soprano sax, you guessed it,
Kenny G, while the entire crowd
waved Glo-Sticks without a hint of
irony. Ten on the Surreal-O-Meter.
The show was also notable for an
other reason: At rehearsal, the Stan
ford Band first encountered our
partners in travel, a Copenhagen all
city girls marching band and drum
corps. They were nice, they drank a
lot, and they smoked more. In other
words, the bands got along famously
for the duration of our trip.
However, I make our trip to
China sound like a lark. The Great
Wall, the Forbidden City, and the
Summer Palace are spectaculars.
The last night of the trip, I spent an
amazing two hours in a street market
in Qingdao, seeing a glimpse of the
China of the people, not Mao's Peo
ple. Busing from the airport to our
first hotel, we passed two children,
each not more than four years old,
alone on the sidewalk, one riding a
tricycle while the other stood on the
back. And on our beer runs, we
passed Chinese people relaxing in
cafes and bars, having a drink, like in
any city. Throughout the trip, I
would forget, then remember, that
they live under a totalitarian regime.
But they aren't raising a Tsingtao
to Mao; the only Little Red Books I
saw were being sold by souvenir ven
dors for the highest price they could
get. China is a nation of these contra
dictions â€” I will remember the
mountains' natural beauty shrouded
in pollution, the grand old church
buildings in an officially atheist na
tion, the beer cheaper than the bot
tled water, and the ballet dancers
leaping about the stage one minute
and grinding with the Tree the next.
But please, let me forget Celine Dion.
