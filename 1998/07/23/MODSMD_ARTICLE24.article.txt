# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Shades of hope for mom's failure 
### 
IT STARTS WITH a T-shirt or ?
pair of socks shed in transit,
draped over a chair and left to
tumble with the breeze of the desk
fan. Soon, there are pants fresh
from the office and peeled off in the
90-degree late-afternoon heat —
then running shoes, then a pile of
sheets.
Then one morning, the floor dis
appears.
College students, especially
males, are traditionally messy. At
least they are in "Animal House."
And while I don't usually identify
with the Belushi stereotype (having
never consumed more than one beei
in 24 hours), this one applies. Mv
Daily office appears to have survived
a cluster bomb of fax paper. Finding
my bed takes a map and, occasional
ly, intricate archeological equipment.
And I once spent 35 minutes search
ing my backpack for;* physics book.
Unlike some mess-freaks ' know,
cleanliness doesn't bother me. I take
care of my personal hygiene and
enjoy spending time in the rooms of
my more fastidious friends. But for
some reason — I have many theories,
none of which satisfy me — I can't
bring myself to pick up my personal
space more than once a month.
This drives the two most impor
tant women in my life — my mother
and my girlfriend—absolutely crazy.
In high school. Mom would walk in to
my bedroom, stare at the two-foot
coating of junk on the carpet and beg

me to clean. Then she'd retreat to the
living room and complain loudly to
my father. "I've failed as a mother,"
she always said. "I've raised two boys
who don't know how to pick up after
themselves."
For the first year we dated, my
girlfriend made only occasional
mess-related comments. But now,
after 18 months together, she has
come to believe that I won't grow out
of this on my own. "I know you can
be clean.'' she told me after we swept
out the tent on a recent camping trip.
1 felt like Darth Vader. There is good
ii .ne;sht can feel it.
1 doni resent their comments. I
appreciate their concern. And most
of the time, I ignore them.
But maybe, just maybe, I'm about
to change.
Two weeks ago, I lost my cher
ished pair of Oakley Frogskins.
As sunglasses go, they were fairly
plain. Black rims, violet tinted lenses
(reflective), the cheapest style that
Oakley makes. They were more than
just shades, though. I bought them on
my first drive out of town unaccom
panied by a parent, a few months
after I had turned 16. It was cloudy
the day I bought them for $50 at a
Portland mall, but the late-afternoon
sun broke through just as I left the de
partment store, and I wore them
proudly all the way home.
Those Oakleys have been all over
Oregon, to France and to Mexico.
Every road trip, every beach day,

every time it was sunny or I just want
ed to feel like I looked cool for <»
while, I wore iheni. A good friend
called them "a Tankersley institu
tion."
I lost them somewhere in th<
mess.
They vanished two weeks ago
from my room or office or car
wasn't worried. Mom, of course, al
ways told me that I would iose im
portani things if» wasn't organized
know where everything is I alwavs
told her: on the floor. A week went
by. I sifted through the office. A few
days more Ransack the ear Finally
after two weeks, I broke down and
completely cleaned mv room lot
late.
The mess had already swallowed
them.
There is nothing I can do now. ex
cept hope they turn up in some for
gotten corner. Oakley changed the
Frogskin design a couple years agi
the man at the glasses store told mi
It'sjust as well. No shades will ever be
those shades.
Maybe this time, things will be dif
ferent. Maybe I will learn from this
and change my ways. Maybe I'll post
a picture of my sunglasses in my
room as a reminder.
Most likely, it will get lost in the
pile of clothes.

Junior Jim Tankersley wants to reas
sure his mother that its not her fault
he loves "Animal House."
