## Band Shak, Galvez House to be torn down 
### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Look quickly, because one of Stanford's
more eclectic and historic buildings will soon
disappear. The Band Shak, which serves as
practice headquarters and a meeting place for
the Stanford Band, is slated to be demolished
this fall.
"By the end of the month, we'll have the
dates pinpointed. We're probably looking at
sometime in the fall," said Dan Rogers, owner's
representative for Capital Planning and Man
agement and member of the group that is over
seeing this project.
"I think it's a good step," said Athletic Di
rector Ted Leland. "The Shak doesn't meet
Santa Clara County earthquake regulations. It
would have to come down by the year 2000 any
way," he added.
In contrast to Leland's enthusiasm, mem
bers of the Band and Band alumni were sad
dened to hear that their home on Galvez Street
is to be leveled. "I think it's going to be a great
tragedy accompanied by a real loss of life —
Shak baby, the Silverfish, and even the Swaks
maybe lost forever," said former Tree and
alumnus Ari Mervis, Class of 1997.
Current Tree, junior Chris Henderson,
echoed this sentiment. "We've known this was
coming for some time; it's really too bad that it's
happening right now," he said.
The Shak, along with the adjoining Galvez
House, home to the Help Center and Center for
International Security and Arms (CISAC). will
be torn down in order to clear space for a new,
state-of-the-art alumni center and home for the
Office of Development.
The site was chosen because of its central lo
cation on campus and because it can support a
large number of visitors. The fact that utilities
were already in place would also keep installa
tion costs low, according to University Archi

tect David Neuman.
"They [the Alumni Association] are appro
priately concerned with ease of access for re
turning alumni; therefore, a site near a major
entry to the campus like Galvez has been a very
important criteria," Neuman said.
Communication problems
Despite assertions by Rogers that the project
is "going to move full speed ahead," the Band
feels the University has not been entirely forth
coming.
According to Band Manager Claire Bacher,
Band management heard shortly after gradua
tion that the building was slated to be leveled in
the fall. It attempted to substantiate the rumors
through extensive inquiries. Finally, while on
tour in China two weeks ago, the band manage
ment discovered that the rumors were in fact
true; and claims it was never independently in
formed by anyone within the University. No
one in the administration was available for com
ment on this matter.
"The Band, like the Galvez House and the
Medical Library, was taken by surprise. We are
currently working with the University and the
Athletic Department to find a solution accept
able to the Band, but currently it's impossible to
predict the outcome," Bacher said. "It is unfor
tunate that the Band was not informed sooner,
and there may be complications because of this.
"Both the Band and Band alumni have a
very strong attachment to the Shak and it will be
difficult to find an acceptable interim space on
such short notice," she added.
According to Bill Stone, president of the
Alumni Association, the association operated
on the assumption that the Band was fully
aware of the events taking place. "What I un
derstand is that the Band had been told that that
building is seismically unsafe ... and that they
have a new location," he added.

The Band's future
At the moment, Encina Gym, located across
the street from the Band Shak, is being targeted
as the new home for the Band, Rogers said.
"We'll do our best to make our new facility
as unique and as welcoming as the current one,"
Henderson said.
However, because that space won't be ready
for about a year, it remains to be seen where the
Band will be housed until then.
For the next few weeks, Bacher said the
Band will be negotiating to find a new home and
will try to delay demolition of the Shak until
after the football season and the Band's alumni
reunion. Rogers said this would not be possible
because the demolition must be completed this
fall for construction to begin in the spring.

"There's contaminated soil near the building
because of a diesel tank, and as a result the
building has to be demolished before the rainy
season; otherwise our whole schedule gets
thrown off," Rogers said.
The construction of the new alumni center
coincides with the anticipated merger of the as
sociation with the University.
Pending approval of the merger by its mem
bers, the Alumni Association will cease to be an
independent organization and will become a
university division.
In the meantime, members of the Band anx
iously await their fate. "I'd just like to know that
the administration is doing its best to keep
everyone fully informed of the situation.. .while
I have no reason to think otherwise, I wouldn't
mind some reassurance," Henderson said.

The Band Shak will be torn down this fall to make way for the new Alumni Association
center, which comes in conjunction with the prospective merger of the association with
the University.
