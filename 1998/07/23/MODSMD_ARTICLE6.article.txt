# Alumni Association awaits merger with University
## 
### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
The Alumni Association's merg
er with the University has come one
step closer to completion.
The merger received approval
from the University trustees earlier
this year, and the association's
board of directors approved the in
tegration in May. The merger is
contingent on the results of a vote of
its members on the issue.
Alumni Association President
Bill Stone, who said that the associ
ation had already polled over 6(X)
members in a phone survey, was op
timistic about the outcome of the
vote. "People indicated general en
thusiasm about [the merger]," he
said.
Approval from members of the
association will be the last hurdle to
completing the merger. Already the
required quorum of 10 percent of

the 66,0(X) eligible members has
been surpassed, and there is strong
support for the merger in the cur
rent tally, said Marie Earl, director
of services and systems at the asso
ciation. Remaining members have
until Aug. 14 to cast their votes.
Reach, serve and engage
The merger will provide "a bet
ter ability to match alumni skills
with real University needs," ac
cording to Stone.
In an effort to "reach, serve and
engage" alumni. Stone said the as
sociation will work to find nonmon
etary ways in which alumni may
contribute to the University.
These include setting up
stronger networks of alumni in dif
ferent areas of the country who
could help students find summer
jobs or postgraduate employment,
as well as helping to fund housing.

There would also be more work by
alumni to persuade prospective
students to come to Stanford, Stone
said.
"It isn't wildly different from
what we do now, just sort of more
evangelical," Stone said.
The association will also in
crease initiatives to promote class
unity. One such initiative, the se
niors' farewell dinner in the Main
Quad, has already had success, with
1,150 of 1,300 students attending
this year.
"The bottom line is what can we
offer alums," said Nora Sweeney,
associate director of alumni pro
grams at the association. "If we
don't have resources, we don't have
anything to offer."
Sweeney cited Princeton Uni
versity's alumni council, which is
part of the university, as a model of
success. "They have the most satis
fied alumni body," she said.

Addressing merger woes
Although the majority of re
sponses to the merger have been
positive, employees, alumni and
board members are not without con
cerns. The association has received
numerous calls regarding the issue,
and the results of the phone survey
indicated three major concerns. Earl
said.
First, alumni are worried about
the issue of independence, and
whether the association will still pro
vide a forum for people to be critical
of the University. They are also con
cerned that the new merger will
cause the University to divert funds
from academics to alumni relations.
In addition, board and staff mem
bers of the association are bothered
by the idea that their programs could
become bogged down in the Univer
sity's bureacracy, and that opera
tions might not proceed as smoothly

because of it.
Although all of these are real
concerns. Earl is confident that the
association would be able to mitigate
them for the most part.
The association will continue to
have full editorial control over the
Stanford Magazine and provide that
as a forum for independent opinions
of alumni.
Although the University has allo
cated $1 million a year for the next
three years for expansion of alumni
relations. Earl said the result of this
spending will be to create more
funding from alumni in the future.
In terms of the University's bu
reacracy, one of the provisions of the
merger is that the association will he
come an auxiliary division of the Uni
versity. instead of a full department.
This will give the association more in
dependence in its programming.
