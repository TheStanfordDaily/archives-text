# Alumni Association awaits merger with University
## 
### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
The Alumni Association's merg
er with the University has come one
step closer to completion.
The merger received approval
from the University trustees earlier
this year, and the association's
board of directors approved the in
tegration in May. The merger is
contingent on the results of a vote of
its members on the issue.
Alumni Association President
Bill Stone, who said that the associ
ation had already polled over 6(X)
members in a phone survey, was op
timistic about the outcome of the
vote. "People indicated general en
thusiasm about [the merger]," he
said.
Approval from members of the
association will be the last hurdle to
completing the merger. Already the
required quorum of 10 percent of

the 66,0(X) eligible members has
been surpassed, and there is strong
support for the merger in the cur
rent tally, said Marie Earl, director
of services and systems at the asso
ciation. Remaining members have
until Aug. 14 to cast their votes.
Reach, serve and engage
The merger will provide "a bet
ter ability to match alumni skills
with real University needs," ac
cording to Stone.
In an effort to "reach, serve and
engage" alumni. Stone said the as
sociation will work to find nonmon
etary ways in which alumni may
contribute to the University.
These include setting up
stronger networks of alumni in dif
ferent areas of the country who
could help students find summer
jobs or postgraduate employment,
as well as helping to fund housing.

There would also be more work by
alumni to persuade prospective
students to come to Stanford, Stone
said.
"It isn't wildly different from
what we do now, just sort of more
evangelical," Stone said.
The association will also in
crease initiatives to promote class
unity. One such initiative, the se
niors' farewell dinner in the Main
Quad, has already had success, with
1,150 of 1,300 students attending
this year.
"The bottom line is what can we
offer alums," said Nora Sweeney,
associate director of alumni pro
grams at the association. "If we
don't have resources, we don't have
anything to offer."
Sweeney cited Princeton Uni
versity's alumni council, which is
part of the university, as a model of
success. "They have the most satis
fied alumni body," she said.

Addressing merger woes
Although the majority of re
sponses to the merger have been
positive, employees, alumni and
board members are not without con
cerns. The association has received
numerous calls regarding the issue,
and the results of the phone survey
indicated three major concerns. Earl
said.
First, alumni are worried about
the issue of independence, and
whether the association will still pro
vide a forum for people to be critical
of the University. They are also con
cerned that the new merger will
cause the University to divert funds
from academics to alumni relations.
In addition, board and staff mem
bers of the association are bothered
by the idea that their programs could
become bogged down in the Univer
sity's bureacracy, and that opera
tions might not proceed as smoothly

because of it.
Although all of these are real
concerns. Earl is confident that the
association would be able to mitigate
them for the most part.
The association will continue to
have full editorial control over the
Stanford Magazine and provide that
as a forum for independent opinions
of alumni.
Although the University has allo
cated $1 million a year for the next
three years for expansion of alumni
relations. Earl said the result of this
spending will be to create more
funding from alumni in the future.
In terms of the University's bu
reacracy, one of the provisions of the
merger is that the association will he
come an auxiliary division of the Uni
versity. instead of a full department.
This will give the association more in
dependence in its programming.
For employees of the association,
the merger should not change much
in terms of day-to-day workings.
"For the most part the merger will
appear seamless," said Bess
Kennedy, program coordinator for
alumni programs.
Some employees are concerned
about changes in benefits resulting
from the merger. They will lose some
health care benefits and the associa
tion's sabbatical program, while
gaining University benefits like a
subsidized Stanford tuition for chil
dren of University employees.

In addition, employees will have
to establish new relationships with
faculty and work more closely with
the University on projects.
"It's going to be a big change,"
Earl said. "There will be a transition
period of about one or two years
while we work out all the new rela
tionships. [Employees] will have to
get over that initial learning curve."
Terms of integration
Under the merger, the alumni as
sociation will officially become a di
vision of the University, and Stone,
who will remain president of the as
sociation, will sit as the equivalent of
a University vice president.

All land currently owned by the
association, including the Sierra
Camp land at Fallen Leaf Lake, will
be transferred to the University, but
the association will continue to man
age and maintain it.
"Our intent is that we will operate
with the authority of the University,"
Stone said.
The association is also planning to
build a new three-building Alumni
Center at the corner of Galvez Street
and Campus Drive. The new $3() mil
lion center will replace the current
Bowman Alumni House as head
quarters for the association and will
serve as a welcoming center for visit
ing alumni.
The center, whose construction

will begin this year and will be com
pleted by 2(XX), will stand on the cur
rent location of the Band Shak,
which has been condemned for seis
mic reasons, and the Galvez House.
The association deemed the Bow
man house insufficient for meeting
alumni needs because of its inconve
nient location and lack of parking
and meeting space.
The new center will provide
meeting and conference space, a hall
for big events, a library and a small
gym with lockers. It will also provide
online access to alumni wishing to
use the Internet.
"We want [the new center) to
speak volumes to the effect that
alumni are welcome," Stone said.

Plans for the merger came about
as a result of the association's five
year strategic planning efforts in
1995. These efforts were led by con
sultants from the McKinsey consult
ing firm.
The McKinsey consultants rec
ommended a self-study by the alum
ni association to determine options
for more cohesive relations between
the University and alumni and more
options for alumni involvement.
This eventually led to University
President Gerhard Casper and
Alumni Association Board Chair
Warren Lyons signing a letter of in
tent on October 28. 1997, which
opened the way for formal discus
sion of a merger.

health care benefits and the associa
tion's sabbatical program, while
gaining University benefits like a
subsidized Stanford tuition for chil
dren of University employees.

In addition, employees will have
to establish new relationships with
faculty and work more closely with
the University on projects.
"It's going to be a big change,"
Earl said. "There will be a transition
period of about one or two years
while we work out all the new rela
tionships. [Employees] will have to
get over that initial learning curve."
Terms of integration
Under the merger, the alumni as
sociation will officially become a di
vision of the University, and Stone,
who will remain president of the as
sociation, will sit as the equivalent of
a University vice president.

All land currently owned by the
association, including the Sierra
Camp land at Fallen Leaf Lake, will
be transferred to the University, but
the association will continue to man
age and maintain it.
"Our intent is that we will operate
with the authority of the University,"
Stone said.
The association is also planning to
build a new three-building Alumni
Center at the corner of Galvez Street
and Campus Drive. The new $3() mil
lion center will replace the current
Bowman Alumni House as head
quarters for the association and will
serve as a welcoming center for visit
ing alumni.
The center, whose construction

will begin this year and will be com
pleted by 2(XX), will stand on the cur
rent location of the Band Shak,
which has been condemned for seis
mic reasons, and the Galvez House.
The association deemed the Bow
man house insufficient for meeting
alumni needs because of its inconve
nient location and lack of parking
and meeting space.
The new center will provide
meeting and conference space, a hall
for big events, a library and a small
gym with lockers. It will also provide
online access to alumni wishing to
use the Internet.
"We want [the new center) to
speak volumes to the effect that
alumni are welcome," Stone said.

Plans for the merger came about
as a result of the association's five
year strategic planning efforts in
1995. These efforts were led by con
sultants from the McKinsey consult
ing firm.
The McKinsey consultants rec
ommended a self-study by the alum
ni association to determine options
for more cohesive relations between
the University and alumni and more
options for alumni involvement.
This eventually led to University
President Gerhard Casper and
Alumni Association Board Chair
Warren Lyons signing a letter of in
tent on October 28. 1997, which
opened the way for formal discus
sion of a merger.
