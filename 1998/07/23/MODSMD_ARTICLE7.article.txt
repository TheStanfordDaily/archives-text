# Team researches quakes
## Stanford professors head three-year study on Bay Area 
### Robin Lee 
A consortium of representatives from West Coast
research universities met at Stanford's Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center on July 10 and 11 to devel
op better tools and models for emergency response
and the rebuilding of infrastructure in the event of an
earthquake.
The workshop was a "kickoff to future research and
gathering of information concerning this matter," said
Engineering-Economics Systems and Operations
Prof. Samuel Chiu. Chiu heads the joint Stanford-USC
project with Civil Engineering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian
and University of Southern California Prof. James
Moore.
The San Francisco Bay Area was selected as the
focus of the study "because of the complexities of the
network system itself," said Kiremidjian. According to
her, the area is prone to extensive damage if a severe
earthquake hits.
"The problems [in the Bay Area] are certainly more
challenging," she added.
The conference, co-sponsored by the Pacific Earth

quake Engineering Research Center, was attended by
approximately 40 people, including representatives
from Bay Area transportation systems, businesses,
universities and disaster mitigation centers. They pri
marily discussed prospective measures to create safer
transportation systems and buildings in urban areas.
According to participants in the two-day workshop,
current tools and models are flawed and inadequate in
some respects.
What sets this project apart from previous studies is
that it attempts to incorporate considerations such as
the public's altered mindset following an earthquake.
"What we are hoping to do is to expand [previous
research]," Kiremidjian said, "to consider some of the
dynamic components of the system such as the change
in economic demand and traffic demand."
In addition, the project will focus on the indirect
costs and long-term economic effects of an earthquake
rather than its short-term and direct aspects.
"We're looking at economic impacts, particularly in
relation to the Silicon Valley," Chiu said. "Earthquake
damage to this area would result in serious economic
problems for everyone."
