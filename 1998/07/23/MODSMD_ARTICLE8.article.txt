# Shelves are not quake-safe
## 
### Sally Williamson 
Several weeks ago. Asst. Prof, of
Geophysics Greg Beroza observed
that his metal bookshelf was mount
ed only in the drywall. "I noticed
fthe bookcase] had missed the
earthquake supports," he said.
Norman Sleep, Professor of
Geophysics and Beroza's neighbor
in Mitchell Earth Sciences Building,
had a similar experience in 1989. Al
though he was out of town at the
time of the Loma Prieta Earth
quake, his bookshelf came down
and sent all of his books crashing
into the crevice below his desk â€”
the exact place he would have hid

den had he been there, he said.
Because the earthquake was
such a disaster, aid was difficult to
find, leaving the responsibility of of
fice repairs to Prof. Sleep. The
shelves were remounted properly
only on his insistence.
Damage from the 1989 earth
quake is still being mended by ongo
ing construction. However, what
isn't seen is the nonstructural dam
age that occurred within campus
buildings, houses and rooms as ob
jects and furniture inside toppled
and crashed.
Sleep, who is also a seismologist,
said that plaster has almost no
strength, and in an earthquake,

bookshelves mounted only in dry
wall will surely fall. He said that
Beroza's shelf could be pulled out of
the drywall by hand. Had there been
an earthquake, this problem could
have caused major damage or in
jury; all of which easily could have
been averted.
"It was very incompetent [of the
contractors to mount the shelves in
securely], especially in a seismolo
gist's office," Sleep said. He is con
cerned that this type of problem
could exist all over campus.
Sleep noted that another profes
sor in the same building was trapped
in his office under similar circum
stances in the 1989 earthquake. For
tunately, he was on the phone when
it occurred, so he was rescued.
"It's a real problem that can do
real damage," Sleep said.
Felicia Morales-Martin of the
Facilities and Human Resources
Office at the School of Earth Sci
ences said that two months ago she
sent a mass e-mail requesting notifi
cation of any facility problem in fac
ulty offices, but she only received
three responses.
"Whenever I see things [that
need to be fixed] I'll try," she said.
Sleep and the other professors'
bookshelves have since been re
paired. However, Morales-Martin
said that finding potential problems
is hard because so much of the work
is done by outside contractors. She
explained that problems such as this
one can only be remedied if some
one points them out to Facilities.
"It's just a phone call," she said.

Geophysics Prof. Norman Sleep's office was damaged by the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake, and his bookshelves came crashing
down onto his desk. Fortunately, Sleep was out of town at the time.
