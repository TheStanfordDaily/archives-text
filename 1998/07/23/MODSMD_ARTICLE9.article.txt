# Health Care increases ads
## 
### Erin Bryla Staff writer 
UCSF-Stanford Health Care is
well into its television and newspa
per campaign to clear up consumer
misperceptions about the recent
merger and to generate more busi
ness.
The advertisements depict the
personal success stories of a number
of patients of UCSF-Stanford
Health Care. These cases typify the
kinds of specialty care that UCSF-
Stanford Health Care provides and
is hoping to expand as a result of the
merger.
"The ads show real situations
where patients have been helped
with specialty care that people can't
get somewhere else," said Mike Las
siter, vice president of communica
tions for UCSF-Stanford Health
Care.
The theme of the advertising
campaign is "Great things happen
here." The campaign is aimed at cre
ating an identity for UCSF-Stanford
Health Care. Campaign organizers
want to produce a general awareness
of UCSF-Stanford Health Care as an
entity.
UCSF-Stanford Health Care con
ducted focus groups and found that
few consumers had a clear picture of
the merger and what it meant. Some
thought the merger created a health

maintenance organization. Others
said they felt that the merger would
cause more impersonal treatment.
In November 1997. UCSF and
Stanford merged four acute care
hospitals: the UCSF Medical Center,
UCSF / Mount Zion Medical Cen
ter, Stanford Hospital and Clinics
and Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital.
The new private, nonprofit orga
nization hopes to support both the
UCSF and Stanford Schools of Med
icine with its $1.4 billion operating
budget. In addition, UCSF-Stanford
Health Care plans to improve its
highly specialized care, like cancer
treatment, cardiac care and pedi
atrics.
The organization hopes that the
advertising campaign developed by
Zuckerman, Fernandes & Partners
will boast interest for a fall "open en
rollment" program.
The first round of advertisements
has run on Bay Area television sta
tions and in newspapers like the San
Francisco Chronicle and the San
Jose Mercury News.
The advertisements include a toll
free phone number where con
sumers can obtain information about
UCSF-Stanford Health Care. The
organization will judge the success of
its campaign through the response to
this phone number and also through
consumer surveys.
