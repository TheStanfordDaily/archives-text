### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The top professionals in women's tennis converged on
Stanford's Tauhe Tennis Stadium this week for the Bank
of the West Classic. California natives No. 3 Lindsay Dav
enport and No. 5 Venus Williams headline a field that also
includes No. 6 Monica Seles and Steffi Graf.
In Wednesday's second round action, Monica Seles
battled jet lag and dehydration in topping unseeded chal
lenger Fang Li, 2-6,6-2,6-1 . Coming off a clay court tour
nament in Spain last week, Seles clearly looked fatigued
and reported feeling sick after the match.
"In the last four games at 3-1,1 couldn't feel my legs and
I was cold," said Seles. "It was probably the altitude
change and also the time change. It's still 6:(X) in the morn
ing for me.
"I was just happy to play the ball and worried about
hanging in there."
Li charged out strong, hitting a few amazing shots
against the second-seeded Seles. Seles managed to pull to
gether, however, and took the next two sets.
"She's a good all-court player," Seles said. "I came out
a little sleepy in the first set.
"I think it was pure luck in the second set. I hung in
there and a few points went my way."
On the other court, fourth-seeded Graf upped her
record against Mary Joe Fernandez to 15-0 by winning 6-
4, 6-(). The match continued Grafs comeback from an
eight-month layoff due to knee surgery.
"Every match I play puts me a step further to where I
want to be," she said.
Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport tixik just over an hour
to breeze past Kimberly Po 6-1, 6-3 Wednesday. Po
topped Australia's Nicole Pratt in the first round on Tues
day.
"She's a dangerous opponent," Davenport said. "I've
lost to her before. I was trying to mix it up a little and
thought to do some stuff different. That seemed to work."

In other action, fifth-seeded Natasha Zvereva of Be
larus defeated Tara Snyder 6-3, 6-4 in their first round
match while France's Anne-Ciaelle Sidot upset sixth-seed
ed Joannette kruger 6-3, 7-6 (8-6). Sidot will face Seles in
the quarterfinals.
Former Stanford player Lilia Osterloh, a wild-card
entry in the tournament, took Kruger to three sets in the
first round before falling 1 -6.6-2,6-4.1n doubles play. Os
terloh's ex-teammates Julie Scott and Ania Bleszynski,
both Class of '98, lost 6-1, 6-4 to the top-seeded pair of
Davenport and Zvereva. Third-seeded Debbie Ciraham
and Caroline Vis as well as fourth-seeded Larisa Neiland
and Elena Tatarkova also advanced.
Other notables in in the tournament included Jennifer
Capriati, whose comeback efforts were sidetracked by a
heartbreaking 6-4.3-6,6-4 first-round loss to fellow Amer
ican Corina Morariu. Moranu will face Williams in the
second round. Williams had a bye in the first round.
