## Biology core revamped 
### Daniel Wan Contributing writer 
Students planning to take the biol
ogy core next year will see some sig
nificant changes in the series. Among
them is a shift in the order of subjects
taught within the core, thus impacting
the way biology has traditionally
been taught at Stanford.
"We wanted to pace the course
more evenly and make it easier for
students to link together the different
fields of biology," said Asst. Prof, of
Biology Deborah Gordon, who
chaired the Biology Department
committee that proposed the
changes. "We felt we should provide
more context about why each topic is
important."
The biology core, which biology
and premedical students usually take
during sophomore year, is intended
to give students a comprehensive sur
vey of the basic principles of modern
biology.
In the old series, subjects in the
core gradually progressed from a
micro to macro perspective through
out the year. Students were first ex
posed to biochemistry, genetics and

molecular biology before studying
broader subjects such as cell and de
velopmental biology, evolution and
ecology.
The new series, however, will do
just the opposite and start with evolu
tion and ecology. Instead of first de
scribing biological processes and later
explaining how they have evolved,
the core will now emphasize biologi
cal principles in the context of evolu
tion from the start of the series, ac
cording to Gordon.
Students will be exposed to the
fundamental underpinnings and the
ories of modern biology before learn
ing about the technical intricacies of
topics such as enzyme kinetics and
metabolism.
The new series will also combine
plant and animal physiology into one
course. In the past, plant physiology
has been taught along side evolution
and ecology. The altered sequence
promises to provide more continuity
and the opportunity to present richer
comparisons of the development and
physiology of different organisms.
The new core will consist of three
five-unit classes. Biology 51, 52 and
53, which will replace the current 30

series. Many students are enthusiastic
about the changes.
"Putting genetics and evolution
classes first will make the first quar
ter of biology core a lot less trauma
tizing and definitely more accessible
for the average entering sopho
more," said junior Kavita Sarin, who
took two quarters of the biology core
last year.
"The changes are a good idea,"
said junior Parveen Parmar, who is a
premedical student majoring in biolo
gy. "It's somewhat unfair to introduce
students to biology using biochem
istry and molecular biology, possibly
two of the most abstract topics cov
ered in the core. Ecology and evolu
tion, on the other hand, are relatively
easy to grasp."
However, not all students are ex
cited about the modifications.
"The bio core seemed to flow
more logically in the old format," said
junior Leslie Simmons, who complet
ed the old core. "Many of the con
cepts that will be covered in the first
quarter are enhanced by topics such
as genetics that will now be covered
later in the year."
Other aspects of the core will re

main the same. Each course will still
be taught by a series of three to five
lecturers, who will focus on conceptu
al understanding and experimental
design.
Students who still need to com
plete parts of the biology core se
quence will be allowed to take the
equivalent course in the new series,
even if it causes them to repeat topics
that they have already studied in
their previous classes.
It is unclear, however, just how the
new biology core will impact premed
ical students. Currently, they are not

required to take the third course in
the old sequence, which covers plant
physiology, evolution and ecology. A
decision will be made soon about
whether premedical students will
have to take all three classes in the
new sequence.
If the new courses are successful,
other modifications might be in
store.
"This year, we will be discussing
more changes, including the possibil
ity of a four-quarter sequence, begin
ning in the freshmen year," Gordon
said.
