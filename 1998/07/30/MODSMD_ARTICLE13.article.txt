### 
Biology 51: Evolution, Genetics and Ecology
Topics: Diversity and history of life; physical and chemical basis of life;
structural genetics; evolutionary genetics; origin of species and natural
selection; population, community and ecosystem ecology.
Biology 52: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology
Topics: Biochemical, structural basis of cell function, emphasizing
macromolecules (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids),
how their structure relates to function and to higher order assembly; en
zyme structure, activity and kinetics; metabolism, hormone control.
Biology 53: Development and Physiology of the Organism
Topics: Plant and animal development and physiology; basic concepts
in determination, differentiation, and morphogenesis; neurobiology
and endocrinology; the principles underlying the exchanges of mass
and energy between organisms and their environments; organ system
specializations which utilize these principles in adapting organisms to
different environments, and the mechanisms by which the functions of
each system are controlled and regulated.
