# EPASSA helps students prepare for high school

"Boom chakalaka boom chakalaka boom,"
Paul Fitzgerald, a doctoral student in educa
tional psychology, says loudly to his language
arts class in hopes of getting their attention and
quieting them down so they will listen. Some of
the 25 middle schoolers quiet down while others
continue to talk to the three or four students and
the counselor at their tables. Fitzgerald repeats
the words and by that time, most of the students
have stopped.
These youngsters in Fitzgerald's class are a
part of the 31 seventh and eighth graders who
comprise the East Palo Alto / Stanford Summer
Academy (EPASSA). The program is run by
six counselors, two teachers and a director.

According to the program's director, senior
Aisha Lowe, the program's director, the main
focus of the Summer Academy is to educate
the students on challenges they will face when
they get to high school. "The mission of EPAS
SA," Lowe said, "is to equip our students with
the skills that they will need to excel, academi
cally and socially, both now and in their fu
tures."
The students primarily come from the
Ravenswood and Redwood City School Dis
tricts and live in East Palo Alto, the Belle Haven
area of Menlo Park and the Fair Oaks commu
nity of Redwood City. These low-income com
munities are predominately populated by
African Americans, Chicanos / Latinos and Pa
cific Islanders.

Summer Academy students offer positive
feedback about the program. "They give you
work that makes you think and challenges you,"
said participant Anabel Segura. "They teach
you things that you will need for high school."
Because there is not a high school located in
the students' home districts, they must com
mute to the Sequoia Union High School District
once they reach ninth grade. The Sequoia Dis
trict also consists of students from the nearby
towns of Atherton, Menlo Park and Palo Alto.
These students have graduated from some of
the highest ranked elementary schools in the
state, and the students from the Ravenswood
and Redwood City districts mast compete with
them once they enter the high schools.
"Education is about leveling playing fields
and providing [the students] the opportunities
to succeed in high school and beyond," said
Jason Stephens, a doctoral student in educa
tional psychology at Stanford and math teacher
for the program.
The Sequoia District reports that 28 percent
of its students do not graduate from high school.
A survey done by the Community Develop
ment Institute in East Palo Alto showed that 60
to 70 percent of students who enter the Sequoia
District from the Ravenswood District never
graduate.
"One of our goals is that EPASSA students
will not be a part of the 70 percent of East Palo
Alto students who drop out of high school,"
Lowe said.
The EPASSA students travel to Stanford by
bus Monday through Friday for six weeks dur
ing the summer. The program begins each day
at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 4:30 p.m. During this

time, students take math and language arts
classes, electives and workshops designed to
prepare them for high school.
The program also incorporates recreation,
including a weekly swim and daily basketball
breaks. Fridays are dedicated to field trips.
The Summer Academy was founded in 1986
by Lome Needle, then a Stanford senior, and
the Luke B. Hancock Foundation. According to
Lowe, Needle looked at statistics such as drop
out rates, and he wanted to see a program es
tablished at Stanford that would better prepare
students for entering high school.
Each year, the program's staff visits area
middle schools, making presentations and
handing out applications. Seventy-five seventh
graders applied, but the program could only
admit 25.
Grades are not a huge consideration in the
admissions process. "The students vary. We
have students who have straight A's and some
who are failing. We accept people based on mo
tivation; it is easy to tell who is motivated and
who is not through their applications," Lowe
said.
The program's six counselors are all Stan
ford students from diverse backgrounds. Each
counselor mentors a group of about four or five
participants.
"My favorite part of the EPASSA pro
gram," said junior counselor Meleah Hall, "is
seeing where [the students] will be four years
from now; seeing the small changes that are
going on inside them now."
The Summer Academy is funded through
private donations and fundraising in coopera
tion with the Haas Center for Public Service.
