## Pixie Black is back 
### 
Frank Black
has returned
to the music scene
with the group

Frank Black and the Catholics and
with the group's new self-titled
album.
Black launched his career as the
lead of The Pixies, a group which is
often cited as the primary influence
for the band Nirvana.
Bizarre topics, guitar distortion, un
usual tunings and timings, and a soft
verse / loud-chorus approach to
songwriting were hallmarks of the
Pixies before they broke up in 1993.
These elements were typical of
Black's early solo work and com
prise a substantial part of alternative
music today.
Frank Black and the Catholics do
not sound this way, however. The
band is closer to the Rolling Stones
than Nirvana. Like the Stones' clas
sic, "Exile on Main Street," this
album is weary yet fun, an informal,
straight-ahead rocker to put on
when you just want to hear some
thing good.
None of the songs sounds like a
chart-topper, but from the Beck-like

"six sixty-six" to the R.E.M.-like "i
gotta move," they would not be out
of place on the average alternative
radio station or on the average col
lege student's stereo.
Some critics and fans may dislike
Black's change of direction. An
early review called it "A retreat
from his entire body of work."
Black seems to have anticipated
such criticism with the tongue-in
cheek "The Man Who was Too
Loud," saying he was worried about
the "little children's ears."
In reality, he was probably wor
ried about slavishly following the
bizarre trajectory that everyone ex
pected from him. This album proves
that he doesn't need to be weird to
be good.
