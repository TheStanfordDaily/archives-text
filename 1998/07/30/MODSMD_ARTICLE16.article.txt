# The 						queen in concert

### 
C)ncert recordings rarely sound as crisp as the singer's
>riginal studio-recorded album. After all, what's allur
ing about carelessly made-up lyrics, out-of-kilter singing and
the sound of audience participation? Worst of all, concert

albums usually contain sloppy guitar sequences that drag on endlessly.
As you may have guessed, remixes aren't exactly my thing. Mary J. Blige,
the self-styled "queen of hip-hop and R&B," almost disproves these general
izations in her newest album, "The Tour."
"The Tour" is an example of an artist who's got some awesome music but
then disappoints everyone by making an album from a show. I really like Mary
J. Blige's music — she's got a great voice, good lyrics and excellent beat, but 1
don't always like the "freer style" that she uses in her concerts.
The upside of this album is that the songs 1 like from the studio recording
remain largely intact. In true R&B fashion, Blige begins her concert at the
Universal Amphitheater in Los Angles with an overly flattering intro and then
proceeds to sing "Real Love," my favorite song. Here, she hangs on to the stu
dio version's rhythm and tune. Some of her other famous hits such as "I Can
Love You," "Mary Jane," "Not Gon' Cry and Everything" sound good as well
If you can stand the incessant cheering of the crowd, then go ahead and get
this album. Even if this is a concert recording, the queen of hip-hop still has
something to offer her fans.
