# Disney outdoes itself
## 
### 
On the heels
of "The
Nutty Profes
sor," "Flubber"

and "Dr Dolittle" comes Disney's
remake of its own 1%1 film "The
Parent Trap."
The updated version manages to
keep the simple charm that gave the
original film its appeal — the idea
that good kids can have some sort of
influence over the relationship be
tween their parents.
The story, for those of you who
have never seen the Hayley Mills
original, revolves around identical
twin sisters who have been separat
ed since birth and have no knowl
edge of the other's existence.
By coincidence, they are both
sent to the same summer camp.
There, they meet and realize that
their uncanny similarities must
mean they are twins. Since both
girls yearn for a complete family
with a mom and dad, they plot to
switch places and then force their
parents to meet again for the first
time since their divorce.
Both parents (played by Dennis
Quaid and Natasha Richardson)
have spoken fondly of each other in

the past, so the twins hope that the
reunion will become permanent.
The biggest gimmick about the
original "The Parent Trap" was that
one actress (then 14-year-old Hay
ley Mills) played the part of both
twins, with the help of split screens
and stand-ins. The remake repeats
the feat with newcomer Lindsay
Lohan, an 11-year-old whose previ
ous works include Jell-O and Pizza
Hut television spots.
To her credit, Lohan plays the
dual role with spunk and finesse.
Her performances are aided by a vi
sual effects team supervised by cin
ematographer Dean Cundey, who
also worked on the visuals for

"Jurassic Park" and "Who Framed
Roger Rabbit." Digitized or not,
Lohan manages to add her own
charisma to the role many can't
imagine for anyone other than
Mills.
The central ideas in"The Parent
Trap" story are as appealing now as
ever — the opportunity to meet a
long-lost sibling and the desire to re
unite a broken home.
The childhood-empowerment
fantasy is familiar from many Dis
ney productions and is especially ef
fective here in a predictable but ulti
mately enjoyable fashion.
