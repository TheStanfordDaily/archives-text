## Shepard takes place among stars 
### 
AS A CHILD, I used to lay
on our trampoline at night
to gaze up at the heavens.
Tears would well up and trickle
down my cheeks and onto the black
tarpaulin. I never knew why. The
dark Nebraska sky dusted with stars
was just so beautiful and so vast. I
wanted to reach out and touch the
stars, but I was confined to life on
the ground.
My heroes, however, were not.
I've always idolized astronauts,
both in triumph and tragedy. A
photo of the Challenger 51-L crew
has hung in my room since the sev
enth grade. These seven individuals
were part of one of the most impor
tant events of my childhood. Many
twenty-somethings would probably
echo that sentiment.
Even during my brief stint in
Moscow, Dick, Mike, El, Ron,
Judy, Greg and Christa kept me
company and kept me sane. This
photo has spent more time on my
wall than any single family photo
graph. In eighth grade shop class, I
even designed and tried to build a
picture frame for my heroes.
Though I never saw them fly, I
can't forget the very first seven â€”
the ones our parents followed wide
eyed, the ones who were welcomed
with ticker-tape parades. Mercury 7
led America into the Space Race,
and Alan B. Shepard blazed the
trail.
A week after his death, it's hard

to find Shepard's name in any major
newspaper, but his is a story and a
dream that supersedes timeliness.
Without his successful mission, we
may never have made it to the
moon. We might still be looking up
and wondering, "What if?"
I was too young to witness Shep
ard's voyages aboard the Freedom
7 capsule and on the Apollo 14 mis
sion. I never met him face to face.
And I will probably never go to the
places that he has gone, but I can
still feel the magic. Fortunately, I
have been able to share that with
others.
I worked as a Space Camp coun
selor last summer. In addition to
wiping the sniffly noses of homesick
middle school children, I taught
them some of the history of the U.S.
space program.
They heard me go on about
Shepard quite a bit: how his flight
was only suborbital, how he only
saw a black-and-white view of the
earth because they forgot to change
his filter, how President Kennedy
challenged NASA to send a man to
the moon by the end of the decade,
how Shepard himself was grounded
for a long period afterward because
of an inner ear infection, and how
he played golf when he finally land
ed on the moon. The children al
ways laughed at that part.
We showed them Shepard's
backup Freedom 7 capsule on dis
play at the NASA Ames Research

Center. They stood on their tiptoes
to peak in the window and in
evitably asked, "How did he fit in
there?"
Although a lot of the kids just
came to camp to have fun, they
sometimes surprised me with what
they learned. Occasionally, I would
even see a twinkle in their eyes, one
that I had personally experienced at
that age.
It's the twinkle of someone who
wants something so badly that he or
she would give up his or her most
prized possession. It's the twinkle
that inspires tears to bounce off a
trampoline during a meteor shower.
It's the twinkle that I've seen in
the eyes of the Mercury 7 as they re
counted their glory days in the
space program. Only four of those
original seven are still with us. One
is even returning to the same fron
tier that made "John Glenn" a
household name.
Alan Shepard left us last week,
but the twinkle in his eye has al
ready been passed on to millions
who will carry out his legacy.
Mr. Shepard, your photo is going
up next to the unframed photo of
the Challenger 7, where it should
have been a long time ago. May you
rest in peace.
