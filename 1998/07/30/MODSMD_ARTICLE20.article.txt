## 'Great Books" for 100 
### 
TWELVE DOLLARS came
between me and the century's
greatest book. The Stanford
Bookstore sells two editions of James
Joyce's "Ulysses," a hardcover for
$21 and a paperback for $19. Kurt
Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse Five,"
paper-bound and pocket-sized, goes
for $6.99. Yesterday, 1 bought Von
negut. Goodbye, literary distinction.
Hello, economics.
"Ulysses" is No. 1 on the Modern
Library's list of the top 100 English
language novels of this century.
"Slaughterhouse Five" is 18th. Both
are classics; neither was required
reading at my high school. They're
the kind of books that always made
the "optional" list—stuff you should
read, but probably never will.
That changed last week, when 10
members of an advisory board at
Random House made the optional
list trendy. Take 98 years of novels,
summarily rank them with no appar
ent criteria and suddenly, books are
HOT again. Orwell at the water cool
er. Fitzgerald over coffee. Lunchtime
debates over whether "Catcher in
the Rye" deserved better than 64th.
Guilt followed interest. Why had
I, a student hoping to make his living
as a writer, read only five of the top
20? Better late than never, I rea
soned, heading across White Plaza
with plans to start at the top and work
my way down, at least to "Henderson
the Rain King" at No. 21. Thwarted
by my thin wallet and the daunting
size of "Ulysses," I chose Vonnegut,
both affordable and accessible. With
out knowing it, I was developing my
own criteria.
Price is a stupid way to pick a
book, I thought on the way back to
the office. Or is it? Literature is no
stranger to market forces. The Mod
ern Library list, after all, was more or
less a publicity stunt by Random
House to get people interested in
many of the books it publishes. I
don't know how the panel quantified
a century of novels. I disagree with
many of its choices. Why not estab
lish my own criteria, and why not
start with the books I can afford?
Perhaps that's the idea. Bliss
Carnochan, a professor emeritus in
English and one of my favorite teach
ers at Stanford, recently told me that
the greatest function of making liter
ary lists — he calls it "Great Book
ing" — is to get people thinking
about books. And though he dis
agrees in principle with numerical
rankings, he acknowledges their im
portance. "I think it is slightly in
sane," he said, "but certainly un
avoidable and good fun."

I agree. The Modern Library has
succeeded in reminding the nation
that we still care about books. Yet it
has left out the novel that etched the
importance of literature into my
mind. I first read Ray Bradbury's
"Fahrenheit 451" as a high school
sophomore; I picked it up the night
before the first chapter was due and
couldn't put it down. I forget how
many times I read it, but I remember
that no story before or after has ap
pealed to me in the same way as
Bradbury's tale of the firemen who
burn books and the people who fight
to keep literature alive.
For the record, I put "Fahrenheit"
second, right behind "The Great
Gatsby." Rounding out my Top Five
are "Catch-22," "One Flew Over the
Cookoo's Nest" and Raymond
Chandler's "The Big Sleep." Prof.
Carnochan, forgetting his rankings
objection for a moment, would add
"Gravity's Rainbow" by Thomas
Pynchon to the Modern Library list.
Both our views, one amateur and
one expert, are heavily influenced by
our ages and experience. Prof.
Carnochan laughed when I admitted
to loathing Joyce's "A Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man," which came
in at No. 3. Read it again in a few
years, he said, and you'll love it.
Who knows — maybe in time I'll
agree more with the committee's
picks. I guess reading more of them
would help (starting with Vonnegut),
though I was heartened that not even
a retired Humanities guru has picked
up all or even most of the Top 100. It
may be a slow process, but someday I
may have the age and experience to
enjoy James Joyce.
Most importantly, I might even
have the $21 to buy "Ulysses" in
hardcover.

Junior Jim Tankersley grew up listen
ing to the literary genius of Dr. Seuss
and Stan and Jan Berenstein, as read
by his librarian mother.
