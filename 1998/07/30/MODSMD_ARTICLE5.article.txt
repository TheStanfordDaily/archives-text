## EE master's goes online 
### Jasmine Wilson 
The first-ever online degree pro
gram at Stanford will be offered this
fall. Accepted students will be able
to earn a master's in electrical engi
neering without ever setting foot on
campus.
"The program is really targeted
to working professionals — engi
neers, computer scientists and tech
nology managers. The focus of the
degree will be in telecommunica
tions because there's a great de
mand in the industry for people
skilled in this area," said Andy Di-
Paulo, director of the Stanford Cen
ter for Professional Development.
Although this is not the first
time Stanford will be offering
courses via the Internet, this is the
first time an advanced degree may
be earned solely from participation
in online classes. For almost three
decades, "distance learners" have
been enrolling in Stanford engi
neering classes through the use of
satellite, television and other tech
nology.

"This program is a natural evolu
tion [of that]," said DiPaulo.
In 1994, after researching the de
mand for Internet courses among
busy professionals, the Stanford
Center for Professional Develop
ment began offering Stanford credit
for online classes through the Hon
ors Co-op program
According to DiPaulo, students
in this program will be "the best in
dustry professionals scattered
worldwide who cannot be in resi
dency on the Stanford campus."
Starting fall quarter, the new pro
gram will be offering 30 electrical
engineering courses online. The Al
fred P. Sloan Foundation is helping
defray starting costs with a $450,000
grant. The program is expected to
pay for itself within three years, as
the online courses will cost 140 per
cent of regular tuition. Distance
learning is nearly always more cost
ly than on-site education.
Stanford's School of Engineering
has consulted both Microsoft and
Compaq in setting up the communi
cations technology for the program.

Professors will be able to distribute
class handouts, notes and exams
electronically as well as interact with
students over the computer.
"We are going to give people in
industry the same courses they'd re
ceive as if they were here on cam
pus," said Dean of the School of En
gineering John Hennessy. "They
will experience the same intellectual
rigor, the same up-to-date treat
ment of material."
Many are excited about the
breakthrough. "In the industrial age
we went to school. In the communi
cation age the school comes to us,"
DiPaulo said.
Although Stanford studies com
paring test scores of distance learn
ers and on-campus students show
that online students perform slightly
better, there may be some disadvan
tages to not being on campus.
"Distance learners don't have
the opportunity to interact with
other students or faculty," said Dale
Harris, executive director of the
Center for Telecommunications.
Despite these challenges, those

involved with the Stanford program
emphasize the quality of the educa
tion available online. According to
DiPaulo, "It'sabsolutely essential to
maintain the same Stanford quality
and intellectual rigor [that on-cam
pus students enjoy.]"
As to whether or not this pro
gram will be expanded to other de

partments. Harris said there is no
concrete plan for its growth. "Cur
rently there are no plans to expand
the online degree program to other
subject areas. However, if the cur
rent effort is as successful as we
think it will be. we would expect
some other departments to follow
suit."
