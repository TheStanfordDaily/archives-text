### Sally Williamson 
William P. Gould IV, the Charles A.
Beardsley Professor of Law at Stanford Law
School, submitted his resignation as Chair
man of the National Labor Relations Board in
a letter to President Clinton on July 7.
Gould, who was assistant general counsel
to the United Auto Workers in 1%1 and a
staff attorney for the NLRB from 1963 to
1965, has been a Stanford faculty member
since 1972. He will teach a labor law course
this spring.
In 1984 he received an endowed chair, and
except for two visiting professorships in 1989
and 1994, he had remained at Stanford until
his appointment as Chairman of the NLRB in
1994.
In his letter to President Clinton, he stated

that the NLRB has "made considerable
strides toward the substitution of cooperation
for conflict and the goal of bringing our people
together as one Nation." He added that he
made considerable ground decreasing waste
ful litigation and reducing case backlog.
The function of the NLRB, which was cre
ated by Congress in 1935, is to determine
whether the opportunity exists for employees
to choose union representation in dealing
with their employers, and if so, which union. It
also prevents and remedies unfair labor prac
tices by either employers or unions.
Gould remains positive about success
achieved during his tenure. "Never before in
its 63-year history has the Board acted with
such frequent conviction and commitment â€”
and I am particularly proud of this accom
plishment," he said.
