### Jasmine Wilson 
For his support of entrepreneurship at
Stanford, Assoc. Prof, of Engineering Tom
Byers has been named the 1998 Ernst &
Young Entrepreneur of the Year.
The Entrepreneur of the Year program
honors the drive and creativity of individuals
and companies forging new paths in business.
Byers' pioneering work in developing the
Stanford Technology Ventures Program led
to this recognition last month. In just three
years, Byers created the program from
scratch; it is currently the only large-scale in
struction and research effort aimed at teach
ing entrepreneurship to engineers in the Unit
ed States.
Byers has taught classes in entrepreneur
ship at Stanford and led the development of
textbooks.
The five-year goals of the Technology Ven
tures Program include training at least 500
Stanford engineering students for leadership
positions and encouraging research in high
tech entrepreneurship.
Byers specifically won the award for initiat
ing the Technology Ventures Co-op Program,
which exists under the umbrella of the Stan
ford Technology Ventures Program. The co
op program seeks to expose outstanding engi
neering students to entrepreneurship, which is
"a highly refined way of doing business." ac
cording to Byers.
The co-op program joins top Stanford engi
neering students, referred to as Mavfield Fel

lows, with summer work in high-tech start-up
firms for the purpose of imparting valuable
experience. Each fellow is assigned three
mentors with whom he or she works closely: a
senior level member of a start-up company,
such as the CEO or founder, an established
venture capitalist and an alumnus of the pro
gram. The fellows are paid at a competitive
rate, not at traditionally low internship rates.
Each fellow takes the Engineering 140 se
ries called "Management of Technology Ven
tures," which focuses on engineering manage
ment and entrepreneurship. Classes in the se
ries include seminars which bring prominent
business leaders from Silicon Valley and else
where into the classroom to share their expe
riences.
The Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram has garnered much press coverage and
received the McGraw-Hill "Innovation in En
trepreneurship Pedagogy" award, which is
given for outstanding teaching at the national
level. Former winners of the annual Entrepre
neur of the Year award include Jerry Vang
from Yahoo!.
According to Byers, the project owes its
success to the many other people who have
contributed to it. including CC Gichane-Bell,
the program administrator.
"Tom is an incredible teacher and his ener
gy is contagious. It gives me great pleasure to
work with the students and get a chance to
meet some of the top venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley," Gichane-
Bell said.
