## Bank of the West Classic brings women's tennis pros to Stanford Top duo ousts Card pair 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
The first doubles match at the Bank of the West
Classic had a decidedly hometown flavor Tuesday
night.
As the announcer made player introductions, a
warm and enthusiastic cheer arose for 1998 Stanford
graduates Julie Scott and Ania Bleszynski. The top
ranked collegiate doubles team in the nation last sea
son, the pair left the Stanford faithful eager, even qui
etly optimistic, about the upcoming match.
Never mind that on the other side of the net awaited
top-seeded Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva.
Forget that the opposition had already won six doubles
titles this year and been finalists at both the French and
Australian Opens. The decidedly-partisan Stanford
crowd, weaned on success, dared to believe that its
longshot had a chance.
Davenport and Zvereva immediately jolted the
crowd back to reality. From the First point, Scott and
Bleszynski looked tentative while their opponents ap
peared unstoppable. Already down a break and trailing
40-0 in the second game, the home team managed to
barely return a Davenport slam only to be put away by
a wicked drop shot that elicited a quiet "Good Lord!"
from the woman sitting behind me.

The crowd's reaction in the first set was all one need
ed to figure out what was going on. While occasional
supportive cheers followed the few highlights for Scott
and Bleszynski, more numerous were the murmurs of
disbelief and admiration from the stands as Davenport
and Zvereva put on a tennis clinic. At one point, Scott
and Bleszynski both called "You!" and watched a per
fectly placed Davenport forehand split them down the
middle. The favorites sailed through the first set, win
ning 6-1 and looking thoroughly untouchable.
In the break after the first set, a good portion of the
crowd furtively made its way to the exits. The mass ex
odus added to the cloud of gloom which seemed to de
scend on the remaining fans.
At the start of the second set, Scott and Bleszynski
tried to shake things up, employing an unusual both
back setup as they prepared to receive serve. Our
hopes momentarily rose and were dashed again as
Davenport and Zvereva cruised through the first game
without dropping a point.
The pair easily won the next two games and had all
but subdued both their opponents and the crowd when
Scott and Bleszynski came to life in a furious exchange
of volleys to open the fourth. Scott evened the score at
15-15 with a sweet drop and Stanford looked strong in
two showcase rallies highlighted by fantastic net play.
Although they lost the game, for the first time, Scott
and Bleszynski looked confident.
The pair gave the crowd new hope by running off
four wins in succession. Their volleys were crisper and
their ground strokes hit with greater authority. Down
4-1, Bleszynski broke deuce in the sixth game with a
picture perfect lob that fell just inches inside the base
line. Scott closed the game out by slamming a winner
off a weak Zvereva return.
Suddenly, it was Goliath who looked vulnerable as
Stanford broke Zvereva's serve to make the score 4-3.
In the next game, Zvereva missed four straight first
serves and argued loudly with the head judge on a fault
call. Scott won serve to even the score at 4-4 and the
crowd broke out into loud cheers of "Go Stanford!" If
there were any doubters in the stands, Scott and
Bleszynski silenced them completely.
Davenport and Zvereva regained control in the
final two games, closing out the set 6-4 to take the
match, and perhaps for the first time, Scott and
Bleszynski were courted with applause after a loss.
Their days of college domination may be over, but
there's no question that they belong with the pros.
