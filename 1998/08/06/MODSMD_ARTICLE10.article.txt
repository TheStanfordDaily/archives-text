## Of Monterey and magic: saving Steinbeck's Eden 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
It is summer in the Salinas Valley.
Once again, the sunlight spills out
without warning and then beats
against the earth, harsh and rhyth
mic. But the land is not dry because
of it. The Salinas River snakes
through the heart of the valley, nour
ishing it to a brilliant green, and for
miles, there is nothing except the
stretch of a road and the sight of the
fields. For years it has been this way.
Whether it will always be this way
is questionable, but the Salinas Val
ley has the good fortune of being im
mortalized in fiction. Although Sali

"The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale be
tween two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the
center until it falls at last in Monterey Bay. I remember my childhood names
for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time
the birds awaken in the summer — and what trees and seasons smelled like —
how people walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich."
— East of Eden, 1952

nas native John Steinbeck once said,
"Not everyone has the good fortune
to be born in Salinas," it is perhaps
the valley that has benefited more
from its native son. It has been more
than four decades since Steinbeck
told us where a toad may live or what
time the birds awaken or what trees
and seasons smelled like. But the
memory of the words remains
strong.
It is Steinbeck's ability to evoke
this clear and piercing memory that
draws scores of tourists each year to
the Monterey Peninsula. And it is
this evident appeal that has brought

him to the heart of controversies de
veloping in Salinas and Monterey, as
well as inspired a recent proposal to
develop a graduate writing fellow
ship at Stanford.
Indeed, interest in Steinbeck still
thrives. The Nobel laureate has been
deceased 30 years now, yet his books
are still widely read and deeply de
bated. His Pulitzer-prize winning
"The Grapes of Wrath," which was
recently ranked number 10 on the
Modern Library's list of the top 100
English-language novels of the 20th
century, has become a staple of
American literature and a model for
aspiring writers. If he desired such
recognition, he never gave any indi

cation of it, except when he wrote as
a 20-year-old student at Stanford, "I
want to be the best writer in the
world."
Later, after winning the Nobel
Prize, he would amend this state
ment to read, "I want to try to be the
best writer in the world." There are
some who firmly believe he achieved
it. Others still scorn the writer for
what they feel to be a betrayal. Stein
beck's adaptations of real people
and actual situations in his novels
were sometimes offensive and un
complimentary to the characters and
events that inspired him. But Stein-

beck was never one to care too much
about the public eye, as he once dis
paraged criticism as an "ill-tempered
parlor game in which nobody gets
kissed."
At the moment, however, criti
cism of Steinbeck's work is largely
overshadowed by various individu
als' efforts in the past month to bring
Steinbeck's writing and life into the
limelight.
The Stanford days
At the time of his graduation
from Salinas High School in 1919,
Steinbeck sought higher education
— at a place that he spelled as Stand
ford.
Steinbeck's course of study was
undecided when he first entered
Stanford, and he wrote down on his
orientation card journalism, English
and law as possible careers. But by
the end of his freshman year, he had
decided on being a writer and took
classes purely for interest, not for
credit or toward his major in English.
He was consistently on academic
probation.
"He never finished college, prob
ably because he focused on what he
wanted to do," said Jennifer Smith,
curator at San Jose State's Steinbeck
Research Center. "He was very
headstrong and would get out of col
lege what he wanted, not what the
University dictated."
Steinbeck opened up to only a
few professors at Stanford, among
them, the "intense" English profes
sor Margery Bailey and creative
writing instructor Edith Mirrielees.
Mirrielees critiqued Steinbeck's
early short stories, while maintaining
that he had the capability to become
a writer. Steinbeck valued her ad
vice, as was evident in a preface he

wrote to Mirrielees' 1962 book,
"Story Writing." He writes, "You
were right about one thing, Edith. It
took a long time — a very long time.
And it is still going on, and it has
never got[ten] easier. You told me it
wouldn't."
"Mirrielees really encouraged
him," said Smith. "She gave him con
structive criticism, but ultimately she
inspired him to do what he set out to
do."
A fellowship in Steinbeck's name
The Pacific Grove-based John
Steinbeck Memorial Museum Pro

ject is hoping to establish a graduate
creative writing fellowship at Stan
ford in Steinbeck's name.
According to Richard Andolsen,
president of the foundation, Stein
beck, who was an on-again, off-again
student at Stanford between 1919
and 1925, "deserves this type of aca
demic accreditation from his univer
sity."
To establish the fellowship, An
dolsen's organization will either
need to provide or raise the neces
sary funds — approximately $30,000
per year.
Associate Dean of Development
Rob Franklin welcomes graduate
study donations. "As costs go up for
graduate studies, we would like to be
able to offer more fellowships for
students," said Franklin. "Funding
from private trusts or corporations
help a great deal."
However, Franklin does play a
discretionary role as well — by dis
cussing the potential fellowship with
members of the appropriate depart
ment, he determines how useful it
would be to Stanford students, and
accepts or denies the funds on that
basis.
"It's not difficult to establish a fel
lowship, once you have the funds,"
said Howie Pearson, director of
planned giving in the Office of De
velopment. "What might be a hin
drance is to determine [the value of
the fellowship]. Is a fellowship on
Steinbeck too limiting or too wide?
That is important for [Franklin] to
ascertain."
Andolsen is presently soliciting
corporations in the private sector to
support the fellowship, which he
calls "a dream of his for years."
Andolsen owns and lives in Stein
beck's grandmother's house, where
a young Steinbeck and his family

spent a few summers. On the prop
erty is also an adjoining workroom
that Steinbeck built in 1936 and
where he later did some writing. An
dolsen operates the house and work
room like a museum, having deco
rated the house with Steinbeck
memorabilia and having preserved
the workroom with Steinbeck's desk
and typewriter intact. Only the
bookshelves have been altered. An
dolsen removed the Steinbeck fami
ly books to put them away for safe
keeping and has replaced them with
his own books, such as "Made in
America"and "Ike." They are

strong contrasts to the wood-pan
eled room encased in ivy. hidden
away from politics and other reali
ties of the world.
Summer at Hopkins
Socially, Steinbeck was reclusive
and only associated with a small
group of friends. While at Stanford,
he lived in the then five-story men's
dormitory, Encina Hall, where his
dormmates knew him as a quiet and
stubborn type who drank quite a bit.
He was said to have disliked the so
cial class division at Stanford and the
fraternity-sorority scene.
But he enjoyed sports and attend
ed football games frequently. As he
wrote to a Stanford friend, Kate
Beswick, in 1929, "Yesterday, Carol
and I went to the Stanford-USC
game and saw Stanford pretty much
outclassed, but the stadium and the
crowds and the green playing field
were so beautiful that we shed no
tears."
However, friends say they never
saw Steinbeck as content as he was
during summer quarter in 1923,

which he spent at Stanford's Hop
kins Marine Station in Monterey.
Steinbeck's quarter at Hopkins
led to a lifetime interest in marine
biology and the development of a
friendship with Ed "Doc" Ricketts,
a researcher at Hopkins in the
19305. Ricketts appears as a charac
ter in many of Steinbeck's novels,
most notably "Cannery Row."
Preserving Cannery Row
While for some Cannery Row
was the "Sardine Capital of the
World," for Steinbeck, Cannery
Row was an inspiration. In the inter
war period, its canneries churned
out massive amounts of fishing
products — something that made
the one-mile coastal strip smell con
stantly of burned fish — and money.
The 1945 publication of "Can
nery Row" coincided with the last
profitable year for the fishing indus
try. The atmosphere that Steinbeck
described in his novel has changed
significantly in the past 50 years. Ar
tisans and restaurants have moved
into the old canneries and tourism

has now become the Row's most
profitable industry.
"Steinbeck had transformed a
heavily industrial and otherwise un
interesting area into a mythical land
where Doc, the boys and Dora and
her prostitutes were all living the
good life," said Kent Seavey, a Mon
terey historic consultant. "The con
text of that world is no longer pre
sent."
How to preserve the historical
"context" of Steinbeck's literature
has been the subject of much debate
in Monterey, especially in the past

"Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise,
a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream."

two months. In June, Cannery Row
was named one of "America's 11
most endangered historic places" by
the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, a nonprofit organiza
tion that seeks to identify historical
ly "endangered" areas and to work
toward saving them.
A plan to curb what preserva
tionists feel has been the "commer
cialization of Cannery Row" was
drafted and released by the city on
July 27. The plan will shortly be
made open to input from businesses.
"We're concerned about the
long-time preservation of the Can
nery buildings, and we've named it a
historical site in both ways — in as
sociation to Steinbeck, as well as the
whole historical sense of the area,"
said Elizabeth Goldstein, a repre
sentative of the National Trust's
Western Regional Office.
"It's a dubious honor and can be
perceived as a negative thing, but it's
to bring about positive change," said
Carol Cunningham, a representa
tive of the National Trust's Wash
ington, DC, headquarters.
Steinbeck's Cannery Row
The change that the Row has
been undergoing sharply contrasts
with Steinbeck's view of its seeming
suspended animation.
The National Trust recognizes
the city's efforts to preserve Rick
etts' lab. Pacific Biological, and
three workmen's shacks. However,
Goldstein said that her organization

"Early morning is a time of magic in Cannery Row. In the gray time after
the light has come out and before the sun has risen, the Row seems to hang
suspended out of time in silvery light.... It is a time of great peace, a de
serted time, a little era of rest."
— Cannery Row, 1945

feels the city "could do more."
Bruce Kibby, a Monterey city
planner, maintains that the city has
been"in continuance with preserva
tion." Frank Donangelo, vice presi
dent of planning and development
at Monterey Canning Co., which
owns 70 percent of the buildings on
the Row, agrees.
Donangelo says that the original
structure of the buildings has not
been altered, except to add rein
forcements. He does not concur
with preservationists' claims that
the Row has become too commer

cialized.
"It's really frustrating when you
really try and then get a slap in the
face," he said. "If someone comes in
and puts a historical label on some
thing, and you can't touch it after
that, it ends up being vacant. We use
the buildings in an economically
beneficial way. while also preserv
ing their historical sense."
While Seavey feels that preserva
tionists and businesses are "fighting
over scraps now," he insists that
there is still enough preserved Stein
beck Cannery Row "literary core."
"Zealots insist on saving every
pebble. I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about maintaining a
sense of time and place," he said.
"There is an area of Cannery Row, it
is the Cannery Row of the mind,
that needs to be saved."
While what Steinbeck's feelings
would be concerning today's Can
nery Row will remain unknown, he
did write in 1960 about the then
rapidly growing tourist industry on
the Row.
"It is a beautiful place, clean, well
run and progressive The can
neries which once put up a sickening
stench are gone, their places filled
with restaurants, antique shops, and
the like. They fish for tourists now,
not pilchards, and that species they
are not likely to wipe out."
Commemorating Salinas' native
son
Although Salinas has grown ex-

tensively since Steinbeck's time, its
agricultural aura is ever-present.
Never-ending rows of greenery run
parallel to the two-lane road that
leads into town. The air in Salinas is
dusty and warm, but the people
don't seem to notice. There is an un

5,000 people. Then you could walk down Main Street and speak to

While Salinas seems to have re
tained some of that charm that
Steinbeck wrote of so passionately
of, there has been one noteworthy
change in the past month. On June
27, residents of Salinas witnessed
the opening of the $10.6 million Na
tional Steinbeck Center Museum

and Archive, which features de
tailed exhibits pertaining to Stein
beck's life and writing.
The establishment of the muse
um, which was funded by both pri
vate and city funds, was met by
some skepticism, since it is centered
in a town that was not eager to em
brace Steinbeck when he was alive.
However, museum staff
maintain that Salinas residents are
pleased with the building of the mu
seum. despite whatever ill-will may
still exist.
"We've received really positive
comments from Salinas natives,"
said Amanda Holder, director of
marketing at the museum.
"Frankly, the residents who felt an
imosity toward Steinbeck are no
longer living, and a lot of their de
scendants have funded the muse
um. I think it's a matter of time for a
town to heal."

Steinbeck's son. Thorn, who was
there for the opening of the muse
um, felt that the senior Steinbeck
would not have minded the center's
placement in Salinas, since he always
remembered his hometown fondly.
His desire to be buried in Salinas was

conveyed to his wife, Elaine, a cou
ple days before his death in New
York at the age of 66: "No man
should be buried in alien soil."
Steinbeck's ashes are interred at
the Salinas Garden of Memories
near Pt. Lobos, a cliff that overlooks
the watery depths of the bay below.
'This is what you write for'
It's worth speculating what Stein

beck himself would have thought of
this current revitalization of interest
in his work and life. It may be safe to
say that he would not have wel
comed the attention being given to
his life story, as he shunned public
appearances and interviews while
he was alive.
But one thing that he valued was
appreciation for his writing, as evi
dent by an anecdote he remem
bered just before winning the
Nobel Prize: "I had a letter a few
weeks ago from a bookseller in
Denmark who said. 4 A woman
rowed in an open boat over eight
miles to bring two chickens to my
store to exchange for one of your
paperback books.' Just think! Row
ing eight miles there and eight miles
back — sixteen miles — to trade for
one of your books! This is what you
write for. This is as good a prize as
you can get."
