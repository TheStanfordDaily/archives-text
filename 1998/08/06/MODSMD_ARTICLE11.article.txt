## Renaissance faire returns to the 'Bay Area Hear ye, hear ye: 'tis a merry journey to 16th century England 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
A staple of summer, the Renaissance Plea
sure Faire has just begun its last season in the
Bay Area.
And what a show it is. If you've never been
to a Renaissance Faire, you would be served by
dropping this article, gathering a friend or two,
and heading north for 75 miles until you reach it.
The Faire mimics a Renaissance-period fes
tival as closely as possible. It includes a show
case of falconry and jousting as well as jesters,
plays, singing and dancing from 16th Century
England.
The crafts and cuisine may consume the ma
jority of your time at the Faire, where leather,
jewelry, candles, glass, pottery and charms are
all offered. A blacksmith melds hot metal under
the sun while street urchins try to peddle their
wares.
Although some consider British cuisine to
consist mainly of fried food and beer, the Faire
offers food for more particular palates. England
may not be known as the land of falafel, but this
and other "exotic delights" are available. The
problem will not be finding something to eat
and drink as much as deciding what to eat.
There are also the "players," literally hun
dreds of people dressed in Renaissance cos

tume, speaking Middle English. The Faire is the
stage for these knights, drunkards, minstrels
and lepers and nothing separates you from them
except perhaps your own inhibitions.
There's also the Queen herself, who offers a
dignified counterpoint to the often raunchy
players and actors. She presides over a joust,
while Old World cheerleaders (for lack of a bet
ter word) rouse the audience. The crowd is di
vided into sections to root for a representative
knight.
Almost every player will be willing to con
verse with you. Just keep in mind that they take
their roles seriously. If you ask where they're
from, you'll likely get "just up the road," and if
they ask where you're from, they'll likely re
mark on the journey you took to get there.
Queries about their craft and their life in the
town are welcomed. One fair maiden taught me
a simple love ballad.
After yearly Faires since 1 %7, it appears that
this may be the last stand for the Faire in Black
Point. After it closes Sept. 7, bulldozers, not of
the merriment of 16th century England, may be
the next sound to disturb the idyllic patch of
woodland at Black Point by Novato.
So come join the players and craftsmen, the
Queen and knights at the Faire, held Saturdays
and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. now through
Labor Day.
