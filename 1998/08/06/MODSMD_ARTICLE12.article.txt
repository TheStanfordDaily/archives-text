# An interview with first-time novelist Larry Baker
## The lowa writer reflects candidly on his craft and his route to Random House
### Kerry Shaw Editorial staff 
Larry Baker is gradually becom
ing one of this summer's hottest
new writers with his first novel,
"The Flamingo Rising" ($12.95/
Ballantine).
It's the tender coming-of-age
story of Abraham Isaac Lee, who
lives with his unforgettable family
in the '60s on the coast of Florida.
Abe's father is the eccentric Hu
bert Lee, who owns and operates
the largest drive-in movie theater in
the country. He enjoys nothing
more than sparring with his arch
rival and next-door neighbor Turn
er West.
The story follows Abe from his
childhood through his love affair
with a the daughter of a family rival.
The author's debut has earned
him comparisons with bestselling
author John Irving and a steady rise
in popularity. The Weekly met with
Baker recently to learn the story be
hind the story.
The History of the Flamingo
"The Flamingo Rising" is as no
table for what it includes — a zany

cast of characters and their witty ex
periences — as well as for what it
omits — profanity. There is not a
single cuss word in the book.
That's becuase the narrator,
Abraham Isaac Lee, is an earnest,
religious man who does not believe
in swearing.
Baker originally imagined that
his book would be embraced by
Christian audiences. However, now
that the book has been published in
14 different languages, he is finding
a much more diverse fan base.
The book, according to Baker, is
"about how you destory those
around you through glut."
Baker began the book 10 years
ago, writing from the perspective of
Abraham's father, but he never fin
ished the work because he felt there
was something wrong with the
novel's tone.
He delayed working on it until he
realized that the story needed to be
told by Abraham. Ten months later
his book was finished.
The Call
After he finished the first draft,
Baker sent the book to an agent
who sent the manuscript to 28 dif

ferent publishers. At the end of two
years. Baker had amassed rejection
letters from everyone who had con
sidered his work.
On a whim, Baker sent the book
to a different agent who had con
nections with Random House, one
of the many publishing firms that
had already rejected his book. It
was the middle of the summer and
Baker was working as a cashier at
the local Waldenbooks and taking a
respite from teaching history at the
University of lowa.
Three weeks later, Baker was be
hind the cash register when he
heard that there was a phone call for
him.
"Are you sitting down?" the
voice on the line asked. "Because
I'm going to make you a very happy
man." It was the new agent.
"But first go get your wife — I
am going to make her very happy
too," he added.
When Baker heard the figure, he
quickly added up his income from
the previous 10 years and realized
that this new sum was far greater. His
wife realized that their children's col
lege tuitions were now paid.
But for Baker (whose previous

publication experience consisted of
a few stories in The Georgia Re
view), the real excitement came
when the agent told him that his
book had been bought by Random
House. "That's when I knew that
people were going to read it,"he
said.
In the span of a vacation to the
Bahamas, renowned editor Sonny
Mehta (who brought the world
"American Psycho") received the
faxes of Baker's draft, the deal was
done and Baker's literary career
was born. This book. Baker swears,
"is Sonny's penance for publishing
American Psycho."
After Publication
Meanwhile, Baker is at work on
another novel, one which he
promises will make up for "Flamin
go's" lack of profanity in in the First
few pages.
He still teaches at the University
of lowa, and he admits that since his
publication, the university seems
happier to have him on staff.
His advice to aspiring writers is
to throw out the First book and to
deal with rejection. "Some of the
best letters I've received have been

rejection letters."
After that, it's all about persever
ence and dumb luck.
"You just have to keep writing,"
he says earnestly. "And hopefully
have something to say," he adds on
second thought.
