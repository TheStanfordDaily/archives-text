# A '90s Cinderella story
## Not even Drew saves 'Ever After' 
### 
Anot-so-evil stepsister with an eating dis
order? Prince Charming starting a uni
versity? Cinderella reading Sir Thomas
More? And the fairy godmother replaced by
Leonardo da Vinci?
It's not quite the Cinderella story from the
Brothers' Grimm.
"Ever After" is 2()th Century Fox's at
tempt at a more hip version of the classic fairy
tale. It stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, a
woman born into a noble family in 16th cen
tury France.
When her parents die, she is left in the
hands of her stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica
Huston). As the story goes. Rodmilla reduces
Danielle to a servant while tending to her own
daughters. Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and
Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey).
The traditional plot changes when
Danielle meets Prince Henry (Dougray
Scott). Assuming her birth mother's high
class title, she dazzles him with her indepen
dent mind and boyish spirit.
Henry tosses aside his plans for an
arranged marriage and pursues Danielle, but
what will happen when he discovers her cur-

rent status as a chambermaid?
Luckily for the couple, a forefa
ther of free thought — Leonardo
da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) — is

in town, and he's got more than pumpkin
stagecoaches up his sleeve.
If this movie actually kept the fairy tale's
supernatural element, the whole thing would
be cheesy. But much of the fantasy charm of
the Cindarella tale is lost because the film in
cludes historical figures and modern issues.
The glass slippers, for example, aren't
nearly as symbolic when Prince Henry al
ready knows where his future bride lives. The
romance .of the story becomes buried under
the movie's political and literary agendas.
Barrymore, in spite of her forced English
accent, plays her part well: she's especially
good at evoking emotion when Danielle is
sad.
The film is set in the French countryside
which results in some picturesque scenes. I In
fortunately, the movie leaves very little worth
remembering.
