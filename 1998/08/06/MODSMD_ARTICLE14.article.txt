I T") radley Nowell, lead singer of the Southern Califor-
I JDnia hand Sublime. is back from the dead ....
I Again.
He is the rock industry's Tupac, who we seem to have
I heard a whole lot more of in death than in life.
"Sublime Live: Stand By Your Van" is the third Sub
[ lime release since Nowell's death from a heroin over-
I dose in 19%. Nowell died just before the release of the
112 band's self-titled third disc which sent the hand into the
national limelight with pop-radio hits such as "What I
! Got" and "Santeria."
Last year's "Second-hand Smoke," riding on the in
credible success of "Sublime," was a dull compilation of
old B-sides and remixes of old tunes.
However, in "Stand By Your Van" Nowell, demon
strates through his punchy voice what a talent we lost in
his death. The material on "Stand By Your Van" is def
initely unpolished, but it is filled with such energy that it
is absolutely exciting to listen to.
Halfway through the track, Nowell breaks into a
silly, child-like description of his daily activities at home
"in that secret-old-tweaker-place-pad-where-we-hide"
(one breath) and then leaps back into the gravely cho
rus, changing the original lyrics, "I'm even learning how
to cook," into "I'm e-ven lear-ning how to COOK
SPEED!!!"
He's equally amusing in the only track from 19%'s
"Sublime," a very-early version of "Caress Me Down."
Nowell prefaces the song with a disclaimer that he
doesn't know the lyrics and will thus fake it. And he
does, in a silly mess of lyrics that you may or may not
recognize.
Surprisingly enough, he pulls off this collection with
such light-hearted verve that it actually works. Sublime
refuses to stay dead with this live collection.

Sublime:lt's amazing how many albums a group can produce after the lead singer's
death.
