# Front 242 back with 'Reboot'
## 
### 
Although it hasn't made a
studio album in five years.
Front 242 is still around and has
just come out with a new live
album. "Reboot: Live."
In the early '90s. with alter
native music coming into the
mainstream and industrial acts
such as Nine Inch Nails and
Ministry selling millions. Front
242 looked poised to follow in
their footsteps.
However, with a more im
pressionistic and less song-ori
ented approach than the other
bands. Front 242's appeal (and
success) has remained limited.
The band brings little new
material to its live album
Because much of the
group's music is computer gen
erated. it is difficult for the
band to sound much different
in concert than it would in a
studio. The band has fewer op
portunities for instrumental
jam sessions.
Front 242 is not great at live
recording, but it is not awful at
it either. The album works bet
ter as a career summary than as
a live document.
The group is most engaging
when it is the least abstract,
such as in the how-to "Head
hunter" or the anti-evangelical
"Welcome to Paradise."
The album has its exciting
points, but. as an at-home expe
rience. it's not nearly what it
should be.
Despite the band's decade of
success, this album makes it
seem as though many of these
years have been devoid of inspi-

ration.

That's "242" in case you're
having trouble reading the
cover. Front 242 manages to
sound pretty much the same
after 10 years.
