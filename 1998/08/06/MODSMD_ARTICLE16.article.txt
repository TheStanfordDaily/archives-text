## Davenport wins Bank of the West Classic Top seed downs Venus Williams in all-American final at Taube 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Under a withering afternoon
sun that baked both fans and play
ers alike, top-seeded Lindsay Dav
enport overcame a late run by
Venus Williams Sunday to win the
Bank of the West Classic, 6-4, 7-5,
6-4.
The match was the first ail-
American final of the year on the
Women's Tennis Association tour
and raised the third-ranked Daven
port's record to 4-1 against No. 5
Williams.
"I let things slip in the second
set," Davenport said. "Down 3-0 in
the third, I got my game back. I'm
happy to win my second title this
year against a great field."
Williams, battling an injury to
her left leg in the second set, was
both brilliant and erratic during the
match.
While the 18-year-old third seed
fired 14 aces, two more than she
had recorded in her semifinal
match against Monica Seles,
Williams was hampered by a 48
percent first serve percentage and
several key unforced errors.
"There were no problems with
my first serve," she said, "but it
wasn't as good as [Saturday)."
Midway through the first set,
Davenport took control, fending
off a pair of aces to break Williams.
Davenport saved serve through the
rest of the set to win 6-4.
She broke Williams again early
in the second, and with Williams
taking an injury timeout after the
third game, Davenport appeared

poised for victory.
"It looked like I was on a roll
and had the match in hand," Dav
enport said. "Things really turned
around."
After the pair traded serves
twice more, the score stood at 4-3
and Williams took another injury
timeout for her leg. Her calf al
ready wrapped, Williams took the
court this time with both her calf
and lower thigh bandaged.
The short stop in play clearly
rattled Davenport, who lost serve
and promptly dropped eight of the
next nine games.
"It was frustrating," she said. "1
think you should only be able to
take a timeout before you serve.
Maybe it's not that fair to take it be
fore the other person serves."
Facing a 2-0 hole in the third set,
Davenport had a break point in the
third game, but a Williams ace and
an unforced error by Davenport
squashed that opportunity. Seem
ingly defeated, Davenport's game
came back to life as she cruised
through the next three games and
the match was tied again.
"1 was up 3-0, but it was just one
break," Williams said.
Williams reasserted control by
blanking Davenport in the fourth
game, but the top seed countered
with a strong service game of her
own to even the match again at 4-4.
Down 30-40 in the ninth game,

Williams
made a cru
cial unforced
error, hitting
into the net,
and was bro
ken for the
fourth time
in the match.
Serving

'[Davenport is] a tough op
ponent. She keeps the ball
deep with pace.'
— Venus Williams

for the match at 5-4, Davenport
squandered two match points. At
40-15, she double-faulted and after
a long rally on the next point, Dav
enport let a deep Williams back
hand go, thinking it long.
After letting out a small scream,
Davenport looked at the umpire in
credulously when the shot was
ruled in.
"I thought it was going out, but I
think it stayed in," Davenport said.
"Sometimes you just want it to go
out."
On the third match point, Dav
enport hit a baseline backhand into
the net to end another long rally.
Finally, after crushing her deuce
serve to bring up the fourth match

point, Davenport won as Williams
hit into the net. The exhausted win
ner clutched her racket in relief.
"I just kept trying to win points
on every point," Williams said.
"She's a tough opponent, though.

rr ' o
She keeps the ball
deep with pace."
Both
Davenport and
Williams faced
tough matches in
the semifinals. On
Saturday after
noon, Davenport
survived another

three-set marathon against fourth
seeded Steffi Graf, winning 6-4,6-7
(4), 6-3.
"People say she has been out for
a year and a half and she's not
ranked that high anymore, but it's
still a good win," Davenport said.
Graf, who is recovering from
knee surgery, beat Mary Joe Fer
nandez and fifth-seeded Natasha
Zvereva to advance to the semis.
"I haven't had a lot of matches or
three setters in the past one-and-a
half years, so it's definitely some
thing that makes me realize what I
have to work on," said Graf. "There
are a few things that I have to work
on — definitely return of serve."
On the other side of the bracket,

Williams faced the third-seeded
Seles Saturday evening and rode
her powerful serve to a straight sets
victory, 6-3,6-4.
"Obviously, I've never played
anyone as tall as Venus. She mixed
it up very well," Seles said. "She
does a very good variety on her
serve. I really love that part of her
game. I wish 1 had that serve and
that athletic ability."
Despite their billing as the next
generation of greats in women's
tennis, neither Davenport nor
Williams is ready to concede the
start of a rivalry.
"It's not like we've met in the fi
nals of a Grand Slam," Davenport
said. "We haven't had any huge
matches."
In doubles play, Davenport
capped the tournament by winning
that title as well on Sunday. She
teamed with Zvereva to beat Nei
land and Tatarkova in straight sets,
6-4,6-4.
On the Cardinal front, former
Stanford player Lilia Osterloh lost
her first-round match to Jeannette
Kruger, 1-6,6-2,6-4. Recent gradu
ates Julie Scott and Ania Bleszyns
ki were the first victims on Daven
port and Zvereva's title run, falling
6-1, 6-4 in their first round doubles
match.

"I haven't had a lot of matches or
three setters in the past one-and-a
half years, so it's definitely some
thing that makes me realize what I
have to work on," said Graf. "There
are a few things that I have to work
on — definitely return of serve."
On the other side of the bracket,

Williams faced the third-seeded
Seles Saturday evening and rode
her powerful serve to a straight sets
victory, 6-3,6-4.
"Obviously, I've never played
anyone as tall as Venus. She mixed
it up very well," Seles said. "She
does a very good variety on her
serve. I really love that part of her
game. I wish 1 had that serve and
that athletic ability."
Despite their billing as the next
generation of greats in women's
tennis, neither Davenport nor
Williams is ready to concede the
start of a rivalry.
"It's not like we've met in the fi
nals of a Grand Slam," Davenport
said. "We haven't had any huge
matches."
In doubles play, Davenport
capped the tournament by winning
that title as well on Sunday. She
teamed with Zvereva to beat Nei
land and Tatarkova in straight sets,
6-4,6-4.
On the Cardinal front, former
Stanford player Lilia Osterloh lost
her first-round match to Jeannette
Kruger, 1-6,6-2,6-4. Recent gradu
ates Julie Scott and Ania Bleszyns
ki were the first victims on Daven
port and Zvereva's title run, falling
6-1, 6-4 in their first round doubles
match.
