# Comebacks come up short

Neither Steffi Graf nor Monica
Seles looks old. Not a hint of gray in
their hair or a telltale wrinkle on ei
ther face betrays their age. Both
have playing professional tennis for
what seems like ages, but neither ap
pears to be far out of her twenties.
Well, neither one is.
Graf celebrated her 29th birth
day just over a month ago and Seles,
amazingly, is still just 24. But the ar
rival of such youngsters as Martina
Hingis, Anna Kournikova and
Venus Williams — all still teen
agers — have pushed the two older
players into unlikely roles as tennis'
grande dames.
The injuries the two women have
suffered are enough to make anyone
feel old. Last year, Graf had recon
structive knee surgery and Seles
broke her right ring finger. The two
women's comeback trails led
through Stanford last week at the
Bank of the West Classic.
Graf boasts 103 career Women's
Tennis Association titles and has
won 21 Grand Slams. She is the only
woman ever to have won each
Grand Slam four times and is closing

in on Margaret Court's record of 24
career titles.
While Seles has been around for
a shorter time, her credentials are
impressive nonetheless. Holding 41
WTA crowns, Seles wrote herself
into the record books by winning
seven Grand Slam titles in her first
13 attempts.
Coming into last week's Bank of
the West Classic, Seles was ranked
No. 6 while Grafs eight-month lay
off left her at No. 57. The WTA has
extended a special co-ranking of No.
7 to Graf, which allows her to com
pete as a seeded player until this
year's U.S. Open.
For Graf, the journey back has
been so frustrating that she report
edly considered retirement. Howev
er, last week Graf drove many of
those thoughts away by cruising to
straight set wins over both Mary Joe
Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva. In
the semifinal, Graf took Lindsay
Davenport, ranked third in the
world, to three sets.
'There are a few things that I
have to work on — definitely return
of serve," Graf said.
While her ground strokes and
backhand in particular were incon
sistent, Grafs serve was clearly still a

powerful weapon. Graf held serve
until the eighth game of the third set,
when Davenport took a 5-3 lead, but
the break may have been due more
to fatigue than anything else.
"I wish I would have had some
thing left in the third set," she said.
"In the third set, from 3-3 on I didn't
know how to move anymore."
Similarly, Seles has seemed to hit
her old form this year since she
missed defending her Australian
Open crown last season. Not only
has she been running opponents into
the court with her ground strokes,
but her overall conditioning has
seemed much improved.
Coming directly from a clay court
tournament in Spain to California,
Seles clearly suffered from the ef
fects of jet lag and fatigue. However,
she survived a three-set war against
Fang Li before beating rising star
Anne-Gaelle Sidot in straight sets
and advancing to the semis.
While Venus Williams topped
Seles 6-3.6-4, the victory was more a
result of William's unbelievable ser
vice than any Seles shortcoming.
"I knew that [fatigue] would hap
pen after playing on clay in Spain,"
Seles said. "I should have picked one
or the other, but not both."
