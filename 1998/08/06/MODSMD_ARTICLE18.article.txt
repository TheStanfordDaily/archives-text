## Ed Guzman: New York City The
						luckiest men... 
### 
IN LATE JANUARY. I dis
coverd I'd spend my summer
covering AII The News That's Fit
To Print. At the time, I had no idea
what to expect. New York Times
sports editor Neil Amdur summed it
up during our first conversation:
"Edward, our interns don't do win
dows," he said. "We're looking for
ward to having you, and trust me
when I say you won't be bored."
I wasn't. I started at The Times
June 29, and on my first night as the
sports intern, I covered the
W.N.B.A. (excuse me, the Women's
National Basketball Association on
first reference) at Madison Square
Garden. I was informed on Friday
that I would be heading to Yankee
Stadium to cover a Yankees-Orioles
game the next day.
Yankee Stadium on July 4. To
paraphrase Yankee legend Lou
Gehrig, I considered myself the luck
iest intern on the face of the Earth.
The next morning, I took the sub
way to the 161st Street station, which
left me just beyond right field of the
fabled Bronx ballpark. It was more
than three hours before game time
when I arrived at the stadium, but
fans were already buzzing. The Yan
kees entered Independence Day
with an unheard-of 59-20 record. I
made my way through the press en
trance which is also shared by the
players.
The entrance was lined with fans
seeking autographs and photos with
their favorite players. Somehow, I
didn't think they were waiting for
their favorite sportswriter.
After briefly stepping onto the
field to pay my respects to the regal
ballpark. I nervously walked into the
Yankee clubhouse and started look
ing for Times beat writer Buster
Olney. 1 looked to my right and spot
ted him. furiously scribbling down
the words of David Wells, he of per
fect game lore.
I waited for Buster to finish. I had
heard stories of sportswriters burn
ing out over a 162-game season, but
not the enthusiastic Buster.
"I have heard so many of my col
leagues complaining that if the Yan
kees break the record for wins in a
season, it would mean extra work,"
Buster said. "It's a great story! And
there are great human stories every
day in this clubhouse."
ITiat day Orlando "El Duque"
Hernandez turned out to be a perfect
example. Hernandez, who left Cuba
the previous December, was the
Yankees' starting pitcher. A Cuban
defector pitching in Yankee Stadium
on Independence Day; it could not
have been scripted better.

The script almost got ruined. Her
nandez was having trouble mastering
the top of the Orioles lineup, giving
up two runs in the first inning. But
eventually he settled down and gave
up one unearned run in the next
seven innings. The Yankees rallied
for a 4-3 victory.
After the game, the charismatic
Hernandez was all smiles about his
performance. Standing at his locker
and using a clubhouse attendant as
an interpreter, he whimsically dis
cussed the use of his fastball and slid
er to baffle Baltimore while crediting
his teammates for the run support.
As I am fluent in Spanish. I did not
have to wait for the clubhouse kid to
paraphrase what Hernandez had
said. I eventually asked the in
evitable: What did he think of pitch
ing on Independence Day?
He paused for a second, readjust
ed the ice pack on his right shoulder,
and said, "Well, it's a great honor.
But you see, my independence day
came on December 26 when 1 es
caped from Cuba. Since then, every
day has been an independence day
for me."
There was a long silence from the
group of reporters. The scribes from
the most cutthroat and vicious media
market in America were suddenly
rendered speechless by what Buster
would surely define as a great human
story. I made eye contact with
Buster, and he gave me a knowing
nod. He was absolutely right.
I ended up writing a sidebar on
Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter while
Buster quickly typed his game story
with the Hernandez angle. It was
close to 7 p.m. by the time we filed
our stories.
Yankee Stadium was an empty
relic by then and clouds loomed omi
nously overhead. As Buster and I ex
ited the Stadium on what had now
become a drizzly early evening, I re
alized that today's Times lesson was
about more than getting quotes and
writing on deadline.
It was also a reminder of whv my
parents came to the United States
from Mexico nearly 30 years ago and
why people like Hernandez, even
under adverse circumstances, at
tempt to come to this country today.
It's still the sorcalled Land of Oppor
tunity. in all its troubled and dysunc
tional glory.
Orlando "El Duque" Hernan
dez never met Lou Gehrig, but I'm
sure Hernandez also considers
himself the luckiest man on the
face of the Earth.
