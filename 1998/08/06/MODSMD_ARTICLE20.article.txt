# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Shooting to live like Andy 
### 
IT WAS LATE that summer af
ternoon, and the air in the gym
was so stuffy that it was a wonder
any of the players could breathe, let
alone run or yell. The heat wasn't
bothering Andy Naas, though.
On the court, he was a man pos
sessed. His play was angry, border
ing on violent, and he frequently
shoved opponents aside as he
slapped for the ball and went up for
rebounds.
His shot was on, and so was his
mouth. Everything he put up
seemed to find the basket, and every
soft swish of the net was followed by
a short editorial comment. He was
having a career day and he knew it,
and he was making sure that every
one else in the McMinnville Com
munity Center that afternoon knew
it, too.
The game was close, but he knew
he would win. On the last play, he
pulled his muscular, 5-foot-9-inch
frame around a screen, ignored the
defender who clung to his side and
took what must have been a 40-foot
shot, which he hit. He broke his red
face and his semi-crooked teeth into
a smile, wiped his hands on his fa
vorite Isaiah Thomas jersey, and ex
tended his still-sweaty palm to the
other players.
At that moment in the summer of
19%. I didn't really like Andy Naas.
He had abused me with his talk and

his shot for an entire game.
Once my adrenaline subsided
and the sting of the game wore off, I
realized how much I respected him.
Even on his more human days —
when he wasn't making all his shots
— he put his heart and soul into
every minute he played. I decided
that I could learn a lot from Andy
Naas and how he approached bas
ketball.
He died in a car accident Feb. 19,
1997.
Eighteen months have passed
since I pulled a hometown newspa
per out of my Stanford mailbox and
opened to Andy's picture on the
obituary page. He was 19 years old,
a high school dropout who liked to
lift weights and once worked at a
grocery store. His best times were
spent with his friends and his drums.
thought of him last week when
my mom called to tell me three more
local kids had been killed on the
highway south of town. They were
on their way to work, she said, and
merged too soon after passing a car.
Fender bumped fender; their pickup
spun across the line and smashed
into an oncoming semi truck. Res
cuers spent hours freeing bodies
from twisted metal.
They were young, like Andy. In a
flash of the eye. my mom said, they
were gone. Just like Andy.
I hung up the phone and tried to

grieve for those three kids I never
knew. Instead. I found myself
mourning Andy. His death shocked
me then. A year and a half later, I
still haven't come to terms with it.
The obituary, I remember, said
he "greatly enjoyed basketball." I
remember disagreeing with that.
Andy didn't simply enjoy the game
— in many ways, I think, he lived for
it. Basketball was one of the chief
ways that he was able to express
himself.
And so when I think of Andy's
life, I think of that hot summer day
in the stuffy gym. 1 hear his trash
talk ringing in my ears, and I see the
high arc of his shot descending on
the basket.
Most of all, I remember his deter
mination. He proclaimed it in his
cocky smile and proved it through
his hustle. Andy always wanted the
ball, because regardless of how
many he'd missed that day, he was
confident the next one would go in.
We were not so different, Andy
and I, though the paths of our lives
do not reflect that. We were linked
by basketball and. more than any
thing, hope.
I've missed my share of shots in
my 20 years. Andy Naas taught me
that was OK.
