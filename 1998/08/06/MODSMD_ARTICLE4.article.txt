### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
From teaching five classes per se
mester at Texas Southern University
to developing and directing the
Urban Experiences Program at the
University of Houston to bridging
community centers at Stanford, in
coming Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves has been instrumental
in joining people together into cohe
sive groups.
"One of the things that I have
been very successful at is putting to
gether good teams, and helping peo
ple develop their personal strengths,"
said Graves, currently the assistant
dean of students / director of the
Black Community Services Center.
"Everybody comes in with God
given talents, and it's a matter of help
ing people identify those talents and
helping them develop them to their
fullest abilities. That's a gift I've been
given, and I try to exploit it," said
Graves, who is also acting director of
the Department of African and Afro-
American Studies.
The new associate dean position,
which Graves will assume Sept. 1, was
created after auditors suggested re
ducing the number of departments

that reported directly to the dean of
students. In the new position. Graves
will deal with graduate student pro
grams and services, as well as oversee
operation of Student Activities, New
Student Orientation, the Women's
Center, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center and Tresid
der Meeting Services.
"[Gravesj has immense promise
in his vision and his thorough under
standing of Stanford's structure and
system," said senior Mike Martinez,
former junior class president and
member of the associate dean search
committee. "Students admire and re
spect him for his past endeavors; fac
ulty support his strong ideals and abil
ity to handle many public and impor
tant matters of student-concern."
Molding a new position
Graves cites graduate student is
sues, particularly the housing short
age and the call for increased
stipends, as his main priorities in the
coming year. "Those [issues] are
things that we may not have a hands
on ability to change, but we can serve
as facilitators and advocates for grad
uate students," he said.
To help alleviate the problems.
Graves said he will spend his first year

familiarizing himself with graduate
organizations, meeting with students
to obtain a "representative sample of
student opinion" and will then form
working committees to deal with the
issues.
Graves hopes to involve many stu
dents. faculty and staff in these com
mittees. "I know it takes longer to
build consensus when you bring a di
verse group of people together." he
said, "but when you come to a con
sensus, it's usually more meaningful
and has a greater chance of succeed
ing."
Although he will address graduate
issues foremost in the coming year.
Graves said he is looking forward to
strengthening the other departments
which will report to him.
"My job is not to dictate those or
ganizations but to work with them to
help them create their visions, and
make sure that we're all in sync and
moving in the same direction." he
said.
