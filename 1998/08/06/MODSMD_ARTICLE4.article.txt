### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
From teaching five classes per se
mester at Texas Southern University
to developing and directing the
Urban Experiences Program at the
University of Houston to bridging
community centers at Stanford, in
coming Assoc. Dean of Students
Morris Graves has been instrumental
in joining people together into cohe
sive groups.
"One of the things that I have
been very successful at is putting to
gether good teams, and helping peo
ple develop their personal strengths,"
said Graves, currently the assistant
dean of students / director of the
Black Community Services Center.
"Everybody comes in with God
given talents, and it's a matter of help
ing people identify those talents and
helping them develop them to their
fullest abilities. That's a gift I've been
given, and I try to exploit it," said
Graves, who is also acting director of
the Department of African and Afro-
American Studies.
The new associate dean position,
which Graves will assume Sept. 1, was
created after auditors suggested re
ducing the number of departments

that reported directly to the dean of
students. In the new position. Graves
will deal with graduate student pro
grams and services, as well as oversee
operation of Student Activities, New
Student Orientation, the Women's
Center, the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center and Tresid
der Meeting Services.
"[Gravesj has immense promise
in his vision and his thorough under
standing of Stanford's structure and
system," said senior Mike Martinez,
former junior class president and
member of the associate dean search
committee. "Students admire and re
spect him for his past endeavors; fac
ulty support his strong ideals and abil
ity to handle many public and impor
tant matters of student-concern."
Molding a new position
Graves cites graduate student is
sues, particularly the housing short
age and the call for increased
stipends, as his main priorities in the
coming year. "Those [issues] are
things that we may not have a hands
on ability to change, but we can serve
as facilitators and advocates for grad
uate students," he said.
To help alleviate the problems.
Graves said he will spend his first year

familiarizing himself with graduate
organizations, meeting with students
to obtain a "representative sample of
student opinion" and will then form
working committees to deal with the
issues.
Graves hopes to involve many stu
dents. faculty and staff in these com
mittees. "I know it takes longer to
build consensus when you bring a di
verse group of people together." he
said, "but when you come to a con
sensus, it's usually more meaningful
and has a greater chance of succeed
ing."
Although he will address graduate
issues foremost in the coming year.
Graves said he is looking forward to
strengthening the other departments
which will report to him.
"My job is not to dictate those or
ganizations but to work with them to
help them create their visions, and
make sure that we're all in sync and
moving in the same direction." he
said.

partment heads and deans to estab
lish bonds from the very start.
"Everyday I would meet with two or
three people," he said. "I believe that
personal contact — face-to-face con
tact — is always appropriate."
During his three years at Stanford,
Graves has used these personal con
tacts to change the image of commu
nity centers.
"When I arrived, I was somewhat
taken aback in terms of how the eth
nic community centers were primari
ly perceived as social organizations,"
he said.
As director, he has helped trans
form the center from a purely social
and cultural organization to a bal
anced department that also includes a
host of academic programming. He
has created links between the center
and other community centers such as
El Centro Chicano and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter.
Graves' work to establish connec
tions with academic departments has
allowed the center to stretch its actu
al programming budget of $3,000 to
more than $100,000 in departmental
ly sponsored programs every year.
"He has definitely taken the
BCSC to new heights and added a
level of professionalism to the BCSC

staff," said Michelle Fowles, program
associate for the center and a mem
ber of the search committee that
chose Graves for the center's direc
torship three years ago.
As acting director of Afro-Ameri
can Studies for the past two years,
Graves has overseen development of
the Afro-American Studies minor,
expanded the program's course list
and supervised the program's inte
gration into the Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity program.
Graves also co-taught Introduc
tion to African and Afro-American
Studies with Assoc. Director of the
program Diann McCants and orga
nized two African-American lecture
series.
McCants said Graves brought "a
lot more stability to the program"
and has attracted more students.
"He's served an excellent transi
tional role," said John Rickford, pro
fessor of linguistics and incoming di
rector of the program. "He has the
combination of good judgment and
people skills that you would find in a
good administrator."
Outside of the office
In addition to his administrative
skills, Graves draws strength from his
extensive teaching and research
background. Graves has taught class
es at Cal State-Fullerton and Texas
Southern University, and has been

the associate director of the African
American Studies program at the
University of Houston.
Having earned an undergraduate
degree in political science from Pitzer
College in Claremont, Calif., and a
master's degree in comparative gov
ernment from Claremont Graduate
School, Graves continues to pursue
his interests in those fields, whether it
be through reading, writing books or
helping students with term papers.
"Working with students and ad
ministrators and faculty for me is my
life blood, and I enjoy the challenge,"
he said. "I enjoy the challenge of try
ing to find solutions to problems."
Graves was chosen for the new po
sition from a nationwide applicant
pool of 112 people. The search com
mittee, made up of three undergrad
uate students, three graduate stu
dents, faculty and staff, narrowed the
pool to a list of four, which was sub
mitted to Dean of Students Marc
Wais for selection.
"I am extremely confident that he
will do exceedingly well in all aspects
of this very challenging position,"
Wais said.
The center will be without a direc
tor once Graves steps down, but Jan
Barker Alexander, associate director
of undergraduate admissions, will be
come the assistant director of the cen
ter this fall. She will replace Tristina
Gridiron, who stepped down to pur
sue a doctoral degree.
