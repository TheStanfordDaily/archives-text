# Trans-Pacific Exchange broadens perspectives

Bullets, shotgun shells and pepper spray lay
on the floor of Mirlo lounge in Florence Moore
Hall. Two officers from the San Jose Police
Department are on the scene as 67 mesmer
ized university students from Asia look on.
"This is pepper spray," Officer Kamviz
Kamfirouzi says. "It's made from cayenne pep
per, and police use it to stop bad guys from
doing whatever it is that they are doing."
"Or sometimes Officer Kamfirouzi takes it
toTaco Bell," Officer Robert Reinhardt says.
"Just in case his burritos aren't hot enough.
Sprays it right on." Laughter fills the room.
The discussion with the police officers was
one of many events that Asian students in the
American Language and Culture "program will
experience in the coming three weeks. The lan
guage and culture program, currently in its sec
ond session, is one of several programs coordi
nated by Trans-Pacific Exchange (TPE), one
facet of the non-profit organization Volun
teers in Asia (VIA).
VIA has sent college graduates to teach in
Asia for 35 years. For the past 21 years, TPE
has been bringing students from Asia to the
United States, where they attend classes and /
or participate in out-of-class activities that help
them get acquainted with the United States

and American culture.
"It has only been since 1977 that VIA has
been hosting students from Japan, Taiwan,
Singapore and Thailand here at Stanford,"
said Dwight Clark, VlA's founder and presi
dent. "The program began when we received a
request from some universities in Japan."
"Our purpose is to promote cultural ex
changes and friendships among young people
from Asia and the United States," said Brian
Murphy, one of TPE's three program direc
tors. "[We want] to put students in an academ
ically provocative situation where they are
able to discuss contemporary American issues
and get to know one another as friends."
The 67 Japanese and Taiwanese students
arrived at Stanford on July 26. The Taiwanese
students are from National Taiwan University
and the Japanese students are from Keio Uni
versity; both groups will be in the United States
until August 25.
Aside from visiting the supermarket, rent
ing bikes and exploring San Francisco, they
have participated in lectures and discussion
panels such as "Conformity or Uniqueness?
Cultural Preference" and "Gender Roles."
And for three hours each morning, they attend
an English language class.
"It's not so much that the homework is
hard," said Shinpei Kuramochi, a 21-year-old

Japanese student. "It'sjust that it takes up a lot
of time. We have to go out and talk to a lot of
people, to practice speaking our English."
Most students agree. "Our teacher gave us
an assignment this week and for it, we have to
ask people what they think of the black iron
statues posing in various positions in front of
the church," said Amanda Tsung, a 19-year
old Taiwanese student. "Why should they look
so sad? We asked a lot of people and got back
some funny responses. Someone said that the
statues were having financial troubles while
another said that they had too much home
work â€” like we do!"
The displacement from Asia to the United
States is difficult for some students. Five stu
dent hosts and two faculty advisers help to ease
that transition.
"If the students want to talk to us about
their social life or any problems that they are
having, we can try to help them with that," said
Prof. Hsiou Wei Lin, one of the faculty advis
ers participating in the program for a second
summer. "Some students are here in America
for the first time and some have never been
away from home for [a month] before. We
want to help them to adjust to life in America."
For the hosts, being a part of the program is
a rewarding experience. "This summer, I was
supposed to work in a business office and I

knew that I didn't want to do that," said junior
host Rachelle Aberin. "After submitting an
application and going through an interview, I
found that I really was excited about this pro
gram. I haven't declared my major yet but I am
interested in East Asian Studies. In my junior
year, 1 would really like to go abroad."
Junior Jon Hsy, also a host, said, "This pro
gram was interesting to me because I was real
ly excited that the hosts get to plan the activi
ties and organize the content of the discussion
panels. You learn a lot by talking to different
people. It's interesting to see what students are
thinking about the different things they saw."
The program hosts emphasized that what
made VIA unique was the opportunity for a
true cross-cultural exchange.
"Last summer, I participated in a program
organized by the National Hispanic Institute
and it mostly taught the kids about their own
culture," said sophomore host Mary Ann
Wiesinger. "VIA is an exchange program that
allows the Asian students to learn about our
culture and at the same time we can learn
about theirs."
The ongoing economic crisis in East and
Southeast Asia that has led to the devaluation
of manv Asian currencies and the failure of
many Japanese banks has left VIA
relatively unaffected.
"We're lucky the financial crisis
hasn't hit us that badly," said Clark.
"But we always worry that the drop
in the Asian currency will affect our
program costs."
Nor has the economic crisis se
verely affected the students.
Howard Chi Chung, a 19-year-old
Taiwanese student said, "My moth
er and I made a lot of preparations
before I came here. For example,
we bought American dollars before
1 arrived in the United States so the
currency rate did not bother me as
much."
Already the program has started
to challenge the students' percep
tions on a host of social issues.
"Even though we know that
AIDS should not be solely correlat
ed with gays, people in my country
still think that it is," Chung said,
commenting on a recent panel
called "Relationships and Sexuali
ty." In this panel, students explored
how their cultures approached the
issue of homosexuality.
"I think that we should broaden
our perspectives of the world and its
people and not rely on stereotypes
This program has already done just
that for me." Chung said.
