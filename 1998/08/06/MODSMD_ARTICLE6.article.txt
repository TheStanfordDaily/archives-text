# Collider smashes at SLAC

Last week, physicists at Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center achieved
a successful collision of electrons
and their antimatter opposites,
called positrons, using a new collid
er called the Asymmetric B Factory.
This $177 million project was
funded by the U.S. Department of
Energy and was jointly developed
by SLAC, Lawrence Berkeley Na
tional Laboratory and Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. It
was initiated in 1994 and finished
early last month.
The predominance of matter
over antimatter has been an unre
solved mystery for modern-day
physicists. "The physicist's equa
tions say that matter and antimatter
should be equal," said SLAC Asst.
to the Director Michael Riordan.
"They should have killed off one an
other eons ago, and left us with only
light on this world. Instead we have
solid ground to stand on."
The collider itself will not be
available for physics research until it
undergoes a long tuning process,
which is to last until Spring 1999.
The aim of the project is to pro
duce an abundance of fairly rare,
subatomic particles known as B
mesons. Riordan asserted that "we
know they exist because we have
produced them before." However,
millions of these particles must be
made in order to determine the dif
ferences between matter and anti
matter.
Meanwhile, a particle detector
known as Baßar is simultaneously
being constructed to complement
the collider in future experiments.
This detector is designed to search
for the B mesons among the debris
of the collisions. The purpose of the
collider is to induce an electron and
positron to collide, annihilate each
other and "spew out one B meson
and one anti-B meson," according
to Riordan.
The development of the Baßar
detector has brought together over
500 physicists and engineers from
over 70 different institutions in
countries including France, Italy,
Germany, Britain, China and Nor
way. According to Riordan, Baßar
is roughly 90 percent completed and
will add about an additional $80 mil
lion to the entire project cost. This
detector is expected to be ready by
January 1999.
