# SLAC honors Drell
## Symposium praises retiree's achievements 
### Sally Williamson 
Sidney Drell, prominent physicist, author
and arms control visionary, retired from his
post as deputy director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center on Friday. A symposium
was held in his honor the same day, an event
that featured Nobel laureates, officials from
the U.S. Department of Energy and figures
from the international physics community.
The symposium was aptly placed on the
17th anniversary of Start One, the first major
treaty to reduce nuclear arms. The morning
sessions addressed Drell's influence on theo
ries of particle physics that have been instru
mental in exploring proton and neutron struc
tures. Among the speakers were Nobel laure
ate T. D. Lee of Columbia University and
Christopher Llewellyn Smith of Oxford Uni
versity, outgoing director general of CERN,
the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.
"The physics community here understands
the role that Sid has played in the physics
world." SLAC Prof. Stanley Brodsky said.
Drell's expertise and passion goes far be
yond the technical theories of particle physics.

The afternoon session of the symposium
praised Drell's dedication to public service in
his fight for arms control and nuclear non-pro
liferation. The words "integrity, value, faith,
and vision." were used repeatedly to describe
Drell and his work. He sat modestly in the au
dience, uncomfortably listening to his friends'
words of adulation.
Pief Panofsky, SLAC professor and direc
tor emeritus, poked fun when he described
Drell as a man with two heads â€” splitting time
between his devotion to physics theory and his
commitment to public service as a govern
ment advisor on programs on national securi
ty. He helped establish Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms Control, and
in the 1980s he used this organization as a ve
hicle to oppose President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars.
"One of the difficulties [with Star Wars]
was that it became a political issue before the
science issues were established," he said. "The
issues of Star Wars became heated before the
technical underpinnings were understood

Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center for 28 years, was honored in an
all-day retirement symposium on July 31.
His drive for arms control contin
ues with his support of the Compre
hensive Test Ban Treaty that would
end all nuclear testing, Joan Rohlf
ing of the U.S. Department of Ener
gy said. The treaty, currently await
ing international ratification, has not
yet been signed by the United States.
The symposium speakers were
never short on earnest praise or
comical anecdotes about Drell. "Sid
provided more advice than the
White House was willing to accept,
but he also took it to the people,"
joked IBM researcher Richard Ciar
win.
Educated at Princeton and the
University of Illinois, Drell came to
Stanford as a physics professor in
1956. After aiding in the creation of
SLAC in 1%3, he served as head of
theoretical physics from 1%9 to
1986 and as deputy director for 28
years.
Drell's career will not end with
his retirement. Accomplished in
many areas, he is still committed to
his teaching. "In science, when
you're teaching, [teachers and stu
dents] are jointly trying to under
stand something better so you can
make progress. The more you un
derstand the better you proceed," he
said.
