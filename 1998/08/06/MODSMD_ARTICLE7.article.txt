# SLAC honors Drell
## Symposium praises retiree's achievements 
### Sally Williamson 
Sidney Drell, prominent physicist, author
and arms control visionary, retired from his
post as deputy director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center on Friday. A symposium
was held in his honor the same day, an event
that featured Nobel laureates, officials from
the U.S. Department of Energy and figures
from the international physics community.
The symposium was aptly placed on the
17th anniversary of Start One, the first major
treaty to reduce nuclear arms. The morning
sessions addressed Drell's influence on theo
ries of particle physics that have been instru
mental in exploring proton and neutron struc
tures. Among the speakers were Nobel laure
ate T. D. Lee of Columbia University and
Christopher Llewellyn Smith of Oxford Uni
versity, outgoing director general of CERN,
the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.
"The physics community here understands
the role that Sid has played in the physics
world." SLAC Prof. Stanley Brodsky said.
Drell's expertise and passion goes far be
yond the technical theories of particle physics.

The afternoon session of the symposium
praised Drell's dedication to public service in
his fight for arms control and nuclear non-pro
liferation. The words "integrity, value, faith,
and vision." were used repeatedly to describe
Drell and his work. He sat modestly in the au
dience, uncomfortably listening to his friends'
words of adulation.
Pief Panofsky, SLAC professor and direc
tor emeritus, poked fun when he described
Drell as a man with two heads â€” splitting time
between his devotion to physics theory and his
commitment to public service as a govern
ment advisor on programs on national securi
ty. He helped establish Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms Control, and
in the 1980s he used this organization as a ve
hicle to oppose President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars.
"One of the difficulties [with Star Wars]
was that it became a political issue before the
science issues were established," he said. "The
issues of Star Wars became heated before the
technical underpinnings were understood
