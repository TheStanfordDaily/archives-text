# Credit union to use new banking system
## 
### Lindsey Leibenhaut 
Stanford Federal Credit Union
hopes to improve customer service
and efficiency with a new computer
based banking system, which will en
able tellers to view more of the cus
tomer's information in one transac

tion.
According to President Warren
Marshall, the new software — Pro
logic Corporation's Ovation — will
be serving the credit union's five
branches and 39,(XX) members by
Memorial Day.
For almost a year, the credit union

had been looking for new software to
replace its current 16-year-old pro
gram. Under consideration since Oc
tober, Ovation eventually won out
over competing programs because it
best met two goals, Marshall said .
"We first wanted to get the newest
technology, open-faced technology.

which gives us the ability to use the
best programs. Secondly, we wanted
to be able to view a member relation
ship in one or two screens," Marshall
said.
The program, already in use in
more than 200 other banks around
the world, will cost about $750,000.
