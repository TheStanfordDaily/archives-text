## Left Bank imports cuisine of Provence 
### Kerry Shaw Editorial staff 
(chefs hats), the cooks are visible
while they work.
The entire operation is illuminat
ed by hanging lights that look like
melted crepes and blend well with
the burgundy-colored booths and
oak-toned floors.
Open the menu and you are
whisked to the heart of Provence,
where fresh produce and seafood are
more rights than privileges.
We began with escargots ($7.75)
and pain bagnat ($6.75). The snails
arrived in polenta served atop a deli
cious parmesan sauce, while the pain
bagnat, a Provencial version of br
uschetta, was served with a mild goat
cheese spread and marinated mush
rooms so succulent we wanted to
savor each one.
Next we tried the spinach salad
($7.75), which seems to be the local
requisite salad offering. True to for
mula, the greens were served with
pears, blue cheese and pecans.
However, Left Bank left its signa
ture with sliced grapes, crisper-than-

Anyone who has discovered the
cuisine of Southern France will de
light in the Peninsula's newest
restaurant, Left Bank.
Co-owners Edward Levine
(Stanford M.B.A. '81) and chef
Roland Passot decided to introduce
Left Bank to Menlo Park palates
after the success of its sister restau
rant in Larkspur.
The brasserie offers "grandmoth
er's style cooking," an apt compari
son only if your grandmother sprays
water on her pain levain as it bakes in
the oven.
For those of us whose grand
mothers breathed a sigh of relief
when SPAM was released, it's sim
ply acute gimmick.
Rather than walls, Left Bank has
windows; any area that you can't see
through is decorated with lively Art-
Deco advertisements.
Wearing traditional toques

usual pears and a dressing so light it
didn't overwhelm the taste of the
spinach.
For our main course, we sampled
the saumon roti and the poulet
grandmere (grandmother's roasted
chicken).
The salmon was tender except for
the perfectly crispy top layer, barely
a millimeter thick.
The rotisserie chicken was the
only disappointment, and a mild one
at that. We found it to be rather
bland — perhaps they took it too lit
erally when they said it was "grand
mother's style chicken."
Dessert was a cornmeal cake
($5.50) that came with berries and
vanilla ice cream. It was a perfect
blend of grainy, chewy and soft tex
tures to create a satisfying and light
treat.
If you're looking for a new
gourmet restaurant, or if you're sim
ply bored by the plethora of those al
ready in the area. Left Bank awaits
you.
