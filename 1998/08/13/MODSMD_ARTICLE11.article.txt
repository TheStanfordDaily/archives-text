The Lemonheads have com
piled its best work from the
past 7 years in its new album "The
Lemonheads: The Atlantic
Years." Many of these songs have
never experienced the glory of
radio play, and so the collection is
full of delightful surprises.
Of course, the album also in
cludes familiar favorites, such as
there - working of Simon and
Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson,"
which launched the group into in
ternational stardom in the early
'90s.
Lead singer and sex symbol
Evan Dando sings of life, love and

everything in
between.
With myriad
drummers,

Nic Dalton
on bass and Juliana Hatfield con
tributing some vocals, the group is
dynamic, versatile and full of en
ergy.
Together, The Lemonheads
manage to make great songs using
just three or four musical chords,
with no fills and no samples —
music that is a rare commodity
these days.
This is a record rife with great
songs that happen to be as-yet

undiscovered.
This is a refresh
ing fact consid
ering that every
one and his
grandmother is
releasing a 'Best
Of compilation
these days.
To borrow from
an earlier album
title, I invite you
to "Come on
and feel The
Lemonheads."
You really can't
help but do any
thing else.
