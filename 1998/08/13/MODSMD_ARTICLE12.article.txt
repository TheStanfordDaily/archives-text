# This summer is cruel for Ace of Base fans
## The 						Swedish quartet sounds the same after five years of fame 
### 
Many bands change over the
years, letting their experi
ences and maturity shape their
music. Some just stay the same.
For the past five years, Ace of
Base has managed to retain its for
mulaic style to the point of bore
dom.
After a three-year hiatus from
the recording scene, Swedish pop
quartet Ace of Base has returned
with its third album "Cruel Sum
mer."
The band basically sticks to its
old recipe of sugar-coated techno
and generic pop that made its 1993
debut album a hit.
The group again relies on the
vocal harmonies of sisters Jenny
and Linn Berggren and the upbeat
and danceable sound of their
brother Jonas "Joker" Berggren
and friend Ulf "Buddha" Ekberg.
Not surprisingly, it continues to
follow in the musical footsteps of
its Scandinavian predecessors,
Abba — both groups have very
chirpy tunes.
Although their new songs do
not sound awful, they all start to
sound the same. The title track,
originally sung by '80's vocal
group Bananarama, is terribly
mainstream and instantly forget
table.
Twoothersongs,"Donnie" and
"Always Have, Always Will,"
sound out of place in their current

Motown-style arrangements.
Another song, "Tokyo Girl,"
sounds so generic that it could be
mistaken for a number of dance
tracks by myriad artists.
Unlike its" debut album which
contained memorable disco songs
like "All that she wants," this
album offers little in terms of hits

or memorable songs.
Unfortunately for fans of Ace
of Base, this summer is indeed a
cruel one.

Ace of Base has remained untouched by its celebrity. The group
has maintained the formula that launched it to fame in 1993.
