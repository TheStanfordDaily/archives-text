# Plummer stars as Sir Barrymore

No matter his theatrical presence, an
actor can only capture one's interest for a
limited amount of time when on stage
alone.
This is Christopher Plummer's chal
lenge in the play "Barrymore," now play
ing in the "Best of Broadway" series at the
Herbst Theatre in San Francisco.
Plummer stars as British actor Sir John
Sidney Barrymore, who became famous
for his portrayals of Hamlet and Richard
111 in the 19205.
The play is set on the stage New York's
Plymouth Theater, one month before Bar
rymore's death in 1942.
Despite Barrymore's successful acting
career that spawned three decades, his
personal life remained chaotic. After (and
during) his four failed marriages, he be

came depressed, alcoholic and unable to
remember lines during rehearsal.
Plummer's recreation of this caustic
character is a series of drunken rumina
tions to himself and his offstage line-coach
Frank, as he attempts to recreate his pin
nacle performance as Richard 111.
As the play progresses, Barrymore re
calls his four marriages, his relationship to
his siblings and many of his famous col
leagues.
The flaws in the show cannot be attrib
uted to Plummer, who not surprisingly
won a Tony in 1997 for his Broadway per
formance in the same role. Plummer
(whose film credits include "The Sound of
Music") cavorts through the highs and
lows of life as a Barrymore with appropri
ate pathos and delivery.
However, the foundation of the play is
precarious from the start. First, it assumes
that a two-hour monologue can sustain an

audience's attention. Secondly, it assumes
that audiences will have enough familiari
ty with Barrymore family history to catch
the jokes that are tossed throughout the
performance.
"Barrymore" is interesting as a charac
ter sketch for the first half hour. After that,
any interest in the character fades as you
wish he might just fall down drunk and end
his rambling for good.
