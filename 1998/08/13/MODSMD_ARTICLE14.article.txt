# H2O: a horror of a movie
## 
### 
It has been 20 years since Jamie Lee
Curtis launched her movie career
as the screaming Laurie Strode in
John Carpenter's horror flick "Hal
loween."
Curtis is resurrected on the screen
as Strode in "Halloween H20," 20
years after her brutal escape from the
faceless monster Michael Myers.
Now, she is the dean of a Northern
California private school living under
an assumed name and traumatized
by her ongoing fear of Myers.
She is tense, frazzled, and overly
protective of her son (Josh Harnett),
who resents her seemingly crazy
fears. Throw in four stylish private
school kids who are alone on campus
Halloween night, and we've got a
horror film on our hands (again).
In the first scene, the camera pans
over images from the original film, as
well as newspaper clippings and pho
tos of Michael Myers. In case you
missed the first version, the dark
voice of Myers' original psychiatrist
tells the story of the villain's haunting
beginnings.
Most of the first hour consists of
Strode's haunting visions of Myers as
Halloween night approaches. While

it is refreshing to I 4 4
see the filmmak-
ers curtail the
gore, the cheap XXI.
scare tactics that they use to build
tension only become tiresome. A
sudden haunting chord of music can
sustain interest for about 10 seconds,
but unfortunately these sounds seem
to be the movie's theme song.
With the exception of the first
scene, you see no death until after the
first hour. Once the killing does start,
it is relentless — a horrifying fact,
when you consider that the movie is
only 85 minutes long. You have prob
ably never seen such nasty things
done with garbage disposals and
dumbwaiters.
By the time Strode really starts to
understand her fears, the movie is al
ready rushing to its violent and slight
ly psychotic ending. The audience
isn't allowed to spend as much time
cheering for Myers' bloody demise as
it might like to.
If you take a date to this film, he or
she will be gripping your arm tightly
by the first 10 minutes, guaranteed.
