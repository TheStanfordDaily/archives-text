## Dana Mulhauser: Washington, D.C. Join in, everybody: girl power for sale 
### 
After two hours in
the car, I had heard just
about all the Indigo Girls I
wanted to hear. Stuck in traffic
along the highway exit ramp, "Clos
er to Fine" had come through my car
stereo five times in the past 90 min
utes.
" Have you bought the new CD?"
1 asked my friend Megan.
"No, but I'm sure they'll be sell
ing it at the concert."
I opened the window for some
air, and heard similar sounds blast
ing from surrounding cars. The new
Natalie Merchant CD wafted from
the Jeep in front of me. The girls in
the Miata were playing Sarah
McLachlan. It was girl power pour
ing out en masse. It was the Lilith
Fair.
Who said that feminism is dead?
Time magazine must be seeing
something I'm not, I thought, as I
pulled into the parking lot — $2.75
per person parking fee — and pulled
the $40 ticket for lawn seats out of
my pocket.

No, I
mused, these
20,000 peo
ple are the
true feminist
spirit of
today.
Women sup-

porting women's music, that's what
it's all about.
Inspired, I ran past the Lilith Fair
Starbucks booth (iced latte: $3) and
the Lilith Fair Levi's tent. I scanned
for my friends among the Lilith Fair
art galleries (posters designed by
Sarah McLachlan!) and the Lilith
Fair Volkswagen Beetle displays. 1
finally found them near the Lilith
Fair merchandising booth (tank top:
$25).
"Isn't this great?" I asked as we
scanned for a patch of grass to sit on.
"Sure," Megan said, "as long as
you are willing to buy into it."
"Buy into it?" I questioned. But,
surrounded by a sea of Lilith Fair
paraphernalia (new Indigo Girls
CD: $20), I began to see what she
meant. Buying into it, I began to re
alize, was what Lilith Fair was all
about.
This show is less about women's
music or women's empowerment,
and more about women's buying
power. Sure it's feminism — femi
nism gone corporate. Feminism
slickly packaged and overpriced.
Feminism as a convenient hook to

'I was told to come to Lilith Fair to
support the female rock movement.
I ended up supporting
America.'

get people to spend money. Girl
power, once a counterculture phe
nomenon, has gone mainstream.
Feminism is no longer a movement:
it's a scene.
Don't get me wrong: I under
stand that the purpose of a concert is
to make money. But this wasn't sold
as simply a concert; it was sold as a
cultural movement. I was told to
come to Lilith Fair to support the fe
male rock movement. I ended up
supporting corporate America. Glo
ria Steinem said that feminism "is a
revolution and not a public relations
movement," but now I'm not so
sure.
I went home from the concert im
pressed by the music, but dejected
by the scene. I hadn't given up hope,
though. Next on my calendar was a
WNBA game.
An event to celebrate women's
athletics, I marveled. What an in
spiring thought. And on some levels,
it was. Instead of Sarah McLachlan
popping out of a slinky dress, I saw
Nikki McCray in a jersey. Instead of

caressing a
microphone,
women were
charging the
ball.
Finally,
positive role
models and

true female empowerment, I
thought, as I handed over $4 for a
bottle of Coke.
Join in, the league slogan said,
and join they had. Hop on the band
wagon, join in the fun. Join a sub
sidiary of the NBA, a multi-billion
dollar corporation. Join Spalding,
join Lifetime, join ESPN. Join the
corporate marketers that promote
the game on every billboard and
every TV station.
Here it was again: feminism as
mass culture appeal. The concept of
defying convention sanitized for
mass consumption.
Maybe all of this is silly; maybe
I'm naive. Perhaps the concept of
feminism I got from my mother, that
feminism is about being who you
are, regardless of your sex, is out
moded and outdated. Maybe the
new feminism — join-in, cash-in
feminism — is the way to go.
I'll think about it over my $3 latte.
