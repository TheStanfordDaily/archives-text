# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Snoozing his way to freedom A 						college freshman-to-be prepares for the ride of his life 
### 
DAN TANKERSLEY'S In
dependence will begin at
7:30 a.m. Saturday, when
his father drags him out of his queen
sized waterbed and into the gray
minivan in the driveway.
He will most likely fall back
asleep immediately, so he won't be
able to wave good-bye to the houses
and offices and fast food restaurants
(that never did stay open late
enough) of his small hometown. He
will miss the familiar country roads,
the state capital and the first hour or
two of the interstate. By the time he
wakes up, somewhere near the Cali
fornia border, his mother will proba
bly have stopped crying.
Dan, 18 years old and a Pomona
College freshman-to-be, will be tired
for several reasons. He won't have
finished packing the dozen boxes
that load down the car until late Fri
day night. He will be drained emo
tionally — the worrying and partying
of his last week at home finally hav
ing taken their toll. Most of all, he
will be the same champion sleeper
who only gets up before noon for
church (sometimes), school (most of
the time) and bacon (all the time,
provided the smell finds its way up
stairs to his room).
He will have plenty of time to
sleep on the 12-hour trip to San

Francisco, the first day of a week
long odyssey that will try to emulate
the California van trips of his child
hood. And in the week between his
last day at home and his first day of
orientation, he will have plenty of
time to think about his new life in
Southern California.
The van will stop Saturday night
at Stanford, so the family can rest
and add its fourth member. I thought
about writing my younger brother an
advice letter, full of everything I've
learned in two years of college, to
give him something to think about
on the trip. I eventually realized that
was a bad idea. He doesn't need me
to tell him how the world works out
side of McMinnville, Ore. He'll find
out soon enough.
We will spend a week with our
parents in Los Angeles, retracing the
steps of so many beloved family va
cations. We will visit relatives, play
at the beach, maybe even go to Dis
neyland for old times' sake. We will
leave him Friday at his new home, a
small liberal arts school in the hills
west of L. A. where he hopes to study
film. Before he goes, I'll have plenty
of conversations with my brother.
But I look forward to one in particu
lar.
I want to take Dan to Dodger Sta
dium, sit high in the bleachers, buy

him a Super Dodger Dog and talk
about our times together. Spending
days in our rooms, playing with
Legos, action figures and Nintendo
games. Running through the sprin
klers on hot summer days. Clutching
each other and crying when our
Grandpa Jim died. Making
lunchtime Big Mac runs in high
school and working off the calories
at night, playing basketball on our
poorly lit driveway court.
1 won't tell him that college is
going to be more difficult — and
more fun — than he ever imagined,
both in and out of the classroom. 1
won't implore him to work hard or
play hard, to never pass up a chance
to talk to a professor or take off on a
late night food run (yes, there's al
ways something open late in Califor
nia).
What I will tell him is this: Don't
let go of those childhood memories.
Some people live in the past, others
forget it. My advice to my brother
will be to cherish it and hold its
lessons dear.
Oh yeah, and call Mom and Dad
as much as you can. They like that
sort of thing.

Junior Jim Tankersley is two and a
half years older and five inches
shorter than his "little" brother.
