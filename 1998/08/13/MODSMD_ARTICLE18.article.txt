# Ann Kim: Washington, D.C.
## Roommates and real world in Washington 
### 
An aspiring President of the
United States and White
House intern; a former in
tern who now waits tables at an in
famous cafe; a stowaway skilled at
crossword puzzles, baking and dis
cussing politics.
In a land of drama and scandal
that I have dubbed "the Hollywood
of the East," they are my summer
roommates.
"The Real World, Washington,
D.C.?" you may wonder (or as we
often joke).
Well, it is the real world, but I
like to think of it sans quotes be
cause it's the real real world, not a
contrived television show with pre
screened cast members and artifi
cial decor.
There's tension. Mostly over
whether to buy Diet Coke with or
without caffeine.
There's drama. Mostly over who
will win the nightly Nintendo 64
MarioKart tournament.
There's debate. Usually regard
ing whether or not the cheese is
moldy; usually resolved with the

sniff test.
There are illicit activities involv
ing fake IDs. But nobody is allowed
to know, lest a future opponent
uses it against Danny in a smear
campaign.
There are warm fuzzy feelings.
Based on what we have learned
from Res Ed, we hold weekly house
meetings where we all air our con
cerns about dirty dishes piling up in
the sink and lights that have been
left on for weeks.
We have celebrity sightings and
gossip.
Among us, we've seen President
Clinton, George Stephanopoulos,
Newt Gingrich, Sam Donaldson
(yes, the hair is just as bad in person
as it looks on television), Ted
Kennedy, Trent Lott, Dick
Gephardt and countless other
politicos.
We even have third-hand infor
mation from one of those übiqui
tous anonymous sources that
George Stephanopoulos said Presi
dent Clinton is going to lie in front
of the grand jury, as he has to the

public all along.
We've had brushes with danger.
Danny entered the U.S. Capitol
Building several hours before the
tragic shootings, through the same
door used by the alleged killer. If
the time of his Capitol visit hadn't
been changed at the last minute,
Danny would have been in the
building when the shootings took
place.
There have been one-night
stands.
But that would be strictly in
Steven's domain. (Note the plural,
one-night stands.)
There have been speculations
on Danny's chances of actually be
coming president.
Elizabeth thinks it is unlikely be
cause he's on the short side, and
presidents are generally tall — or at
least seem tall. Steven thinks it is
unlikely because Danny is Jewish
— or "too Jewish," as he says.
I have been impressed, however,
by Danny's genuine friendliness to
strangers. He seems to have al
ready started his presidential cam

paign, saying "hi" to people he
passes on the street and in the
Metro station.
We've made a field trip to the
trendy cafe where Steven waits ta
bles.
This would be the cafe that is
one half of the infamous Kramer
books and Afterwords. The book
store half recently had its sales
records for a customer by the name
of Monica Lewinsky subpoenaed.
The store's employees now wear
shirts that say "subpoenaed for sell
ing books."
We have mildly embarrassed
ourselves by walking to and from
the market with a shopping cart
since nobody in the house has a car.
We have turned the name of the
market we shop at, Super Fresh,
into an adjective. As in, "These
shoes are superfresh" or "That was
a superfresh song." (Just wouldn't
work with Safeway or
Andronico's.)
We have philosophized, deter
mining that food and the Draw are
the great dividers of humanity.

Food because there's no good
way to share groceries without
someone feeling as if all of the food
he paid for has been eaten by oth
ers. The Draw is self-explanatory.
But there has been maturity,
too. We calmly determined that
food that is not to be touched by
others in the house should be clear
ly labeled with the owner's name.
We also officially instituted "Sun
day cleaning," when rancid food is
cleared out of the fridge and dishes
are washed.
Of course, there were attempts
to subvert our orderly governing
processes. Steven wanted our
weekly house meetings to include a
shot for each time anyone spoke
out of turn. And, of course, the
Steven we know and love would
have purposely spoken out of turn
so he could have an excuse to drink.
Real World, eat vour heart out.

Ann Kim, a senior majoring in
American Studies, owns the honor
of being the first summer columnist
to mention Monica Lewinsky.
