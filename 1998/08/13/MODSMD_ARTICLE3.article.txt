## Housing costs high among other schools 
### Penny Kallas Alex Tung 
Rising undergraduate room and
board costs have created a dull roar of
discontent among Stanford students.
Given Stanford's location in Palo
Alto's pricey real estate market, un
dergraduate students have few op
tions for affordable housing off cam
pus, but students at other schools are
feeling similar economic pressures.
Stanford houses 92 percent of its
undergraduate population on cam
pus, a number comparable to Ivy
League schools like Harvard and
Yale, but much higher than other
West Coast schools like UC-Berke
ley and UCLA. Each houses only 33
percent and 18 percent of its under
graduates on campus, respectively.
This can be partly attributed to the
fact that public schools are generally
larger, and private institutions tend to
be able to accomodate larger percent
ages of their smaller student bodies.
Costs or on-campus housing
Although tuition at private univer
sities is generally more expensive
than at public universities, housing
costs at public and private universities
are comparable.
Housing rates at Stanford range
between $3,739 and $4,224 per stu
dent per year, but meal plans can add
up to $4,030, making the total room
and board bill around $8,000. Room
and board at UCLA is more costly at
$7,448, but Columbia and UC-Berke
ley push the upper end of the spec
trum, averaging $8,250 and $8,267, re
spectively. At smaller schools like

Dartmouth, Princeton and Williams,
the totals are considerably less, rang
ing from $6,000 to $6,500 for room
and board for the year.
Prices vary with different meal
plans and living arrangements, but
Stanford is situated at the higher end
of the price bracket.
Although Stanford's on-campus
housing rates have increased 2.8 per
cent this year, Jacqueline Wilson, ad
ministration services manager for
Housing and Dining Services, em
phasized that prices are not influ
enced by off-campus real estate.
"New rates are approved by the
Board of Trustees each year," Wilson
said, noting that decisions are based
on the cost of providing housing and
not the prevailing market rate.
Wilson also added that the 2.8 per
cent increase is minimal when com
pared to price increases in surround
ing communities. Rents in some Mid
peninsula areas have risen almost 20
percent in recent years.
The off-campus market
Although many private schools
guarantee housing for undergradu
ates, state schools are hard-pressed to
make that promise to their much larg
er student bodies.
Stanford has guaranteed housing
for undergraduates for four years.
"Not coming up with housing is
not an option," said Kathleen Brans
field, manager of Housing Assign
ment Services.
Although Stanford does not have
enough on-campus space to house all
of its undergraduates, it has been suc

cessful in housing all undergraduates
who have sought on-campus housing,
Bransfield said.
Every year there is a percentage of
students who refuse housing and
choose to live off campus, as well as a
number who cancel their acceptances
of housing. Housing Assignment Ser
vices "depends on late cancellations
and no-shows to meet the guaran
tee," Bransfield said.
She said that last year was the first
year that a lack of undergraduate
housing became a major problem

here. The University solved the prob
lem by converting some non-residen
tial spaces, such as study rooms, to
student rooms. Most of those spaces
will be returned to their intended uses
in autumn quarter, when a smaller
freshman class reduces the demand
for on-campus housing.
However, at schools like UC-
Berkeley and UCLA, off-campus
housing becomes the norm as early as
sophomore year, after which students
are not guaranteed housing.
UC-Berkeley's on-campus hous

ing runs on a first-come, first-serve
basis after freshman year.
UCLA guarantees the first two
years of housing, forcing most of its
juniors and seniors to live off campus.
Although upperclassmen may enter a
draw for campus housing, sopho
mores and freshmen have priority.
Even sophomores at these schools
tend to move off campus, said UCLA
junior Sangita Menon, who did so
herself last year because of the high
