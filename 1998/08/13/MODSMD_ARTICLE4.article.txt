# Finnish students study American technologies

After months of planning and organiza
tion, the Mountain View based Interconnect
Technologies Corporation sponsored 16
Finnish students to participate in a science
and technology program at Stanford.
With the cooperation of Stanford profes
sors, the company was able to design the pro
gram specifically for these students.
This small group, which arrived on cam
pus Aug. 1, is from the Olari School, a spe
cialized secondary school for science and
technology in Helsinki, Finland. The stu
dents, who were selected for the program
based on their math, science and English
grades, have been staying at Columbae
House for two weeks and will depart for Fin
land Aug. 15.
The program incorporates lectures from
numerous professors and scientists at Stan
ford. The students, ranging in age from 17 to
19, received an introductory talk from Prof.
Emeritus of Philosophy Patrick Suppes on

"The Role of Computers in Scientific Re
search."
During the week, students also visited the
Wilcox Solar Observatory and the Dish an
tenna, receiving lectures from research scien
tists on various projects, such as the Solar Os
cillations Investigations Project and the
NASA-supported Stanford Gravity Probe B
Project.
"This is a carefully organized, well
planned event," said Michael Raugh, vice
president of Interconnect Technologies and
the principal organizer of this summer pro
gram.
Raugh holds a doctoral degree in mathe
matics from Stanford and was invited to
teach at a math camp in Helsinki four years
ago. According to Raugh, Finland has a
"highly educated population" and is finally
emerging from financial depression resulting
from the collapse of the Soviet Union, its
major trading partner.
In recent years, Finnish educators have
emphasized that "high technology is key to

the country's integration into the global
economy," Raugh said. A crucial step for the
country is "to see bright youngsters get an in
ternational perspective," he added.
When Raugh returned to Finland last Oc
tober with others from Interconnect Tech
nologies for a conference, he met with
Finnish educators and prominent scientists.
During their stay, Raugh and his colleagues
were taken to Olari School, where discussion
emerged regarding the possibility of a sum
mer camp at Stanford.
With funding from the Finland Ministry of
Education and Nokia Cellular Phone Corpo
ration, Interconnect Technologies launched
this "pilot project" to bring a small group of
Finnish students to the United States, the first
program of its kind to receive such funding.
"As this was the first year, only 16 stu
dents were selected to go, although there
were many enthusiastic parents and students
interested," Raugh said.
According the Raugh. the program's suc
cess is due in large part to the additional ef

forts of both Suppes and Anni Toivala, a
first-year physics student from the Universi
ty of Jyvaskyla in Finland.
So far, the students have been very enthu
siastic about the program and their first visit
to America. "We have been having lectures
almost everyday and have been presented
with many interesting ideas," said Tommi
Ryyppo, one of the participants. "We get to
ask questions, and it's really nice to have
someone to be able to answer these ques
tions."
"We get to see what these scientists really
do for their jobs. I think I would like to be a
scientist or researcher someday," added
Karolina Munter, another student.
Accompanied by two of their teachers, the
students have also toured companies around
Silicon Valley and visited tourist sights in the
Bay Area.
As the program nears its close, Ryyppo
sums up the experience as a great one, or ac
cording to him, "neat, as you would say in this
countrv."
