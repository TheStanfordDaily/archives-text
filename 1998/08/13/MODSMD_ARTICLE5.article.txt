## Archiving a university Kimball is preserving history in library form 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
Hidden in an out-of-the-way,
third-floor corner of Green Library is
a room of Stanford secrets. Guarded
by an outmoded card catalog and at
tended by long, oak tables and green
hooded, brass lamps, the room is
home to artifacts of Stanford history.
It is here that Stanford Archivist
Maggie Kimball pieces together the
University's past.
"I know too much," she said.
After graduating from Stanford
with a degree in history, Kimball
completed a masters in both history
and library science at Case Western
University. In 1983 she returned to
Stanford as part of the library staff
and became Stanford Archivist in
1990.
According to Kimball, her job is to

document the history and operations
of the University. She also researches
the Stanford family and its history be
fore the school was established in
1892. "I am the principle reference
person on Stanford," she said.
Kimball spends much of her time
in the Special Collection Department
of Green Library â€” a place rarely
frequented by the average under
graduate. But she is pleased to be sur
rounded by Stanford's past. Photos,
diaries, portraits, paintings, old Stan
ford T-shirts, hats and key chains are
among the pieces of Stanford history
locked away in the archive storage
rooms.
For example, at the time the
Dunn-Bacon house on the corner of
Campus Drive and Mayfield was ac
quired by Stanford at the end of last
month, much of its 1920s interior re
mained in tact.

When the University acquires a
property like the Dunn-Bacon house,
Kimball works with the owners to
preserve the history of the buildings
and to ensure that their artifacts are
not lost in transition.
Kimball has a personal stake in
Stanford history, not only as an alum
na. but because she is president of t he-
Stanford Historical Society, a group
established in 1976 to collect and pre
serve Stanford history.
The historical society likes to be
aware of the what's happening on
campus, and also wishes to heighten
awareness and raise questions about
historical values, Kimball said.
"[Stanford] is a dynamic institu
tion. Hopefully future alums will
know more of its history," she said.
"A whole group of people are very
interested in making sure Stanford
history is preserved."
