# Wester inspires battle against disease
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Cystic fibrosis could never slow her down
much. Despite a lifelong battle with the dis
ease, Hayley Wester, who would have been
a junior this fall, participated in extensive lab
research of the very disease that had plagued
her since she was 6 years old.
Wester, 22, died on July 28 at Stanford
Hospital due to complications from a lung
transplant performed in early July. Her
memorial service, which was held on Aug. 4
at Memorial Church, included tributes by
Stanford faculty members and students who
knew her during her years here.
"She was a terrific young lady who was al
ways upbeat under the most trying circum
stances," said Jeffery Wine, professor of psy
chology. "It was particularly hard for me to
watch her, since my own daughter has cystic
fibrosis; but it was inspiring as well, to watch
her deal with the disease."
Wester worked with Wine in his lab,
where Wine and his colleagues were per
forming studies on cystic fibrosis. She volun

teered there since her freshman year.
"There were risks involved with both
having the lung transplant and not having
it," said Wine. "It was not the kind of deci
sion a young woman of her age should have
had to make, but she did, with a great deal of
courage."
In addition to volunteering for Wine,
Wester worked on cystic fibrosis in a Stan
ford Hospital molecular pharmacology lab
in 1997, under supervision of principle re
searcher Phyllis Gardner. She is a senior
dean educator at the School of Medicine,
"It was a very heart-wrenching thing,"
Gardner said. "It served to really bring home
the desire to come up with more therapies
for cystic fibrosis."
Wester's colleagues in the lab remember
her affectionately.
"She came to hang out with me in the lab
last spring," said staff physician Carol Con
rad, who worked with Wester in Gardner's
lab. "As a student, she was a really hard
worker and wanted to help people. And as a
person, she was someone who had so many
personal gifts. She brightened up people's

lives."
According to John Wagner, a post-doc
toral fellow in Gardner's lab and Wester's
doctor for almost two years. Wester under
went hospitalizations and bouts with pneu
monia that precluded her from taking a full
load of classes each quarter.
"There were times when the disease pre
vented her from doing everything that she
wanted to at Stanford," said Wagner. "But
she would go AWOL from the hospital to
her classes at Stanford because she wanted
to attend class and not miss anything."
A native of Dallas, TX, Wester was vale
dictorian of her high school and an accom
plished ice skater. In her Stanford admis
sions essay, Wester wrote about a fictional
snake named Scooter, who helped her un
derstand that college was a "period of transi
tion from several worlds to others, from
youth to adulthood, from dependence to in
dependence and from disease to health." In
her years here, she faced this newfound "au
tonomy" with a sense of "exalted joy."
Wester is survived by her parents, Alan
and Judith.
