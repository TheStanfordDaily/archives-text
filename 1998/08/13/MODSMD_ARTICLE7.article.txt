Sawislak case continues
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak expressed her
grievances over the University's denial of her tenure to
a faculty advisory committee Aug. 6, employing the last
step of the University's grievance process.
The advisory committee is currently discussing the
issue and will give its recommendation to University
President Gerhard Casper within the next few weeks,
according to Kathy Gillam, senior associate provost for
Faculty Affairs. Casper will make the final decision on
the matter this fall.
Sawislak, a labor historian who was denied tenure in
Spring 1997, appealed the initial decision to John
Shoven, the dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. After Shoven's refusal to reverse his decision to
deny Sawislak tenure and Provost Condoleeza Rice's
rejection of the appeal last spring, Sawislak brought her
case to this next and last level in the University's griev
ance process.
Band shak demolition postponed
After negotiations with university officials, Stan
ford band members will retain use of the Band Shak
until Oct. 10. This reversal of the original mandate,
which would have required the band to vacate the
Shak early this September, came at the request of
members to hold their annual alumni reunion in the
present shak.
"People at the University are trying to help us and
1 applaud and thank them, but I think that the lack of
communication between the departments of this leg
endary establishment is preposterous," said senior
Mike Waldo, drum major.
The Shak, along with neighboring Galvez House,
will be demolished either in late October or early No
vember to make room for a new Alumni Association
building. Construction workers will remove a diesel
tank, cut off utilities and remove hazardous material
before demolition can begin, according to Dan Rogers,
administrative manager for university facilities.
