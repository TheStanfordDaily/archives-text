Fox mulls future
Olympic gold medalist and Stan
ford swimming star Catherine Fox is

considering taking time away from
her sport.
"Maybe I'll take this next year
off," Fox told the Kansas City Star
Tuesday. "I could then come back
and train for the Olympics, have a
year to do that."
Fox's father announced Monday
that his daughter, a Stanford junior,
will skip the National Swimming
Championships this weekend in
Fresno while she ponders whether or
not to give up professional swim
ming.
A double gold medal winner at
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Fox was
an All-America in seven events in
1998 and helped the Cardinal
women's team to a national title. She
won two individual NCAA champi
onships in 1997, in the 50 freestyle
and 1(X) backstroke.
Scholarship winners
Four former Stanford athletes
have each been awarded $S,(XX) post
graduate scholarships, the NCAA
announced last week. Recent gradu
ates Jed Crowe, Barbara Ifejika,
Sarna Renfro and Julie Scott will be
able to use the scholarships for study
at a university or professional school
of their choice.
Crowe, a nine-time swimming
All-American in butterfly and sprint
freestyle events, ranks fourth in
school history in the 1(X) butterfly. He
was a Pacific 10 Conference champi
on in the 100 freestyle and part of the

conference-winning 400 freestyle
relay squad in 1997. Crowe graduat
ed with a degree in mechanical engi
neering.
Ifejika helped lead the 1997 Cardi
nal women's volleyball team to its
second straight NCAA title and third
in four years. One of the most under
rated players in the country, middle
blocker Ifejika was the cornerstone
of Stanford's defense. She holds a
dual degree in political science and
African American Studies.
Renfro led the women's cross
country team to a district title and
second place at the NCAA champi
onships in 1997. She contributed to
the team's 19% NCAA title and
achieved All-America and All-Acad
emic status with the track and field
team. Renfro is an honors graduate in
human biology.
Scott, a two-time Pac-10 singles
champion, finished her Stanford ca
reer ranked sixth collegiately in both
singles and doubles. The three-year
captain was a singles All-American
twice and a three-time doubles All-
American. She earned a degree in
psychology.
Hutchinson debuts
Former Cardinal pitcher and
quarterback Chad Hutchinson is 0-1
in three outings for the New Jersey
Cardinals, the class-A affiliate of the
St. Louis Cardinals. Hutchinson has a
3.52 ERA in 15.1 innings pitched. He
has allowed 15 hits and struck out 20.
