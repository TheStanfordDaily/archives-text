## Books recover thanks to flood of support 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Six months ago, the largest storm
in 30 flooded central campus
leaving in its wake 74,919 water
logged books and documents and
substantial damage to campus build
ings. Today, most of the books are
back on the shelves, structural re
pairs made and the nearest water
rides are at Paramount's Great
America.
But the El Nino storm that swept
through campus on the night of Feb.
2 has not been forgotten.
"It was a once in a hundred year
experience," said John Gallagher,
manager of construction services for
Facilities Operations. "Considering
the amount and volume of water in
the center of campus. I don't think
anything could have stopped it."
For some, the early hours of Feb.
3 were spent sloshing in the muddy,
wet basements of Green Library,
Braun Music Building and Cubber
ley Education Building in a frantic at
tempt to save books, pamphlets,
recordings and papers from the rising
waters. Others frolicked in the rains
floating down Mayfield Ave. on their
mattresses or in kayaks. Still others
rode out the night without heat, hot
water or electricity.
A half year after a storm, which
resulted in the cancellation of classes
for the first time since the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, the causes of the
flooding are better understood. As
the pressures of the immediate re
covery effort recede, the University
is studying long-term ways to prevent

the reoccurrence of an evening that
proved to be a night to remember for
Stanford.
Anatomy of a flood
In a 24-hour period, 3.7 inches of
rain fell on ground saturated by suc
cessive storms that had hit the area
starting in December. No longer able
to be soaked into the ground, run-off
water overwhelmed sump pumps
and clogged drain openings with de
bris.
Much of the run-off water from
faculty housing areas followed the
campus' natural gradations to its cen
ter. The water collected at the low
points by Braun, Green and Cubber
ley, all of which are positioned to
serve as natural dams for water. Pres
sure from the accumulating water ul
timately led it to bend in steel doors
and burst through walls.
"The flooding was compounded
by open areas from the construction
[on Green Library]," said Gallagher.
"There was a lot of water on the con
struction side and it is the nature of
the construction business not to seal
up buildings under construction."
The water initially gathered in the
West Wing of Green, which remains
under construction from the 1989
earthquake. As pressure built, water
broke through partitions separating
Green West and Green East, flowing
into the sorting room in the basement
of Green's East Wing.
The worst damage in Green was
sustained in the lower level sorting
room. There, the water reached as
high as 4 feet, soaking several layers

of shelves.
In other parts of the library base
ment, 7 to 8 inches of water gathered,
drenching the bottom 3 or 4 inches of
material on the lower shelves.
Damage to Cubberley occurred in
a similar manner as water gathered
on the sloping ramp behind the build
ing. "The steel doors were bent in
ward by the enormous force of the
water," said Ona Andre, administra
tive associate at the School of Educa
tion. In Cubberley up to 2 feet of
water gathered in some of the stu
dent offices, waterlogging materials
on the floor and in the lower file
drawers.
Bailing out the books
In the early morning hours of Feb.
3, librarians, staff, faculty and stu
dents formed a human assembly line
in the basement of Green, feverishly
removing wet materials from the
shelves and packing them into carts
for shipment to Union City Cold
Storage.
"The nature of paper is that it isn't
always flat. Once it gets wet, it will
tend to expand and swell. You there
fore have to do some sort of mechan
ical straightening," explained Eric
Ellis, who managed the Stanford pro
ject for Document Reprocessors, the
Burlingame company employed to
save the damaged materials.
Because book bindings absorb
water rapidly, there is a narrow time
period in which books can be recov
ered.
"After about 72 hours, mold be
gins to grow and it grows rapidly. The
combination of the water and the an
imal products in the glues and bind
ings enable mold to take over a li
brary in a matter of days," Ellis
added.
In books with glossy pages such as
magazines and art books, fast action
is particularly critical.
"Glossies don't typically get as
good a recovery because when clay
coated pages get wet, the coating
turns to mud. Additionally, the fac
ing pages will be glued together when
the clay dries," said Ellis.
Many of these glossy materials are
oversized and are thus stored on their
sides, resulting in their being com
pletely soaked.
However, fast action enabled the
librarians to get the 74,919 items to
the cold-storage facilities within the
critical 36-hour period following ini
tial water exposure.
Included in the 74,919 total were
300 cartons of material from the Jon
sson Library of Government Docu
ments and several cartons from the

Braun Music Library.
"The affected materials included
unbound journals, books in the stack,
which include pamphlet-like things,
microfilm and microfiche," said Asst.
University Librarian for Technical
Services Catherine Tierney. "By and
large, (the Green materials] crossed
all topics of the literature and bibli
ography collections and different
languages."
The science of saving books
In Union City the wet materials
were frozen at temperatures of 30 de
grees below zero Fahrenheit.
"Freezing ensures no further
degradation due to water," Ellis said.
Within 24-hours the books are stabi
lized, and once they are at freezing
temperature, they can remain in cold
storage for an indefinite amount of
time.
Ellis emphasized that frozen
books come out of the freezer look
ing the same as when they were wet,
except that the water encasing them
now is solid rather than liquid.
The second part of the process in
volves Thermaline drying, in which
25-30 books, secured by bungee
cords, are tightly grouped together
between aluminum plates and then
mechanically compressed.
"The drying process takes about
seven days. As water vapor leaves
the book, it gets compressed," Ellis
said.
Once the book is dry and rehu
midified — the drying process actual
ly removes more moisture than is
normal for a book, making it brittle
— it can be cleaned using brushes
and sponges.
Throughout the spring, approxi
mately 8,000 books were being re
turned to campus on a weekly basis,
after having undergone the freeze
drying and cleaning processes. More
than 90 percent of the books were re
turned directly to the shelves, thanks
to the effectiveness of the freeze-dry
ing technique.
"Different materials, inks and
paints fair differently with exposure
to water," Tierney said. "A large per
centage of the books look fine, but a
few look stained."
Ellis concurred noting that,
"There will be water marks, or what
we would call a tide line on the books.
It is in the paper. But all of the sedi
ment and topical dust have been re
moved."
Affected materials that have been
returned and reshelved are labeled
with the notation "DR 1998" — indi
cating the books were salvaged by
Document Reprocessors. Tierney

explained the books arc labeled with
this code so the library staff is aware
the book was caught in the flood.
"We don't want [librarians] to
think that students dropped the
books in the bathtub," Tierney said.
The last cartons, which included
the most damaged books, are expect
ed to be arriving within the next few
weeks.
"We wanted to get through the
more straightforward, lesser dam
aged stuff first to get as much back on
the shelf as soon as possible," Tier
ney said.
Recovery and replacement
Final statistics have been an
nounced regarding the impact of the
flood on the libraries' collections. Of
the 74,919 books sent to the freeze
drying operation, less than 5 percent
have required rebinding, repair or re
placement.
Tierney explained that 2,432
books required rebinding because
"the book was either dampened by
water or because the binding was
separated from the text block."
Another 1,188 books are under
going repairs.
"Repairs are done on books that
can't be rebound — for instance, be
cause there is not enough room to

make the requisite cuts, or because
the book is too brittle," Tierney said.
Among the types of repairs that
will be performed are re-housing,
(putting a book in a box), photocopy
ing a missing page and inserting it,
and fixing torn pages.
About 600 books were too dam
aged or dirty to be recovered. Tier
ney emphasized that the book's loca
tion in the library was the largest fac
tor in determining the amount of
damage it sustained.
"Some of the books that got the
worst damage were in the sort room,
which means that they had been cir
culating. Some were older, while oth

ers were current imprints," Tierney
said.
The library staff will go to out-of
print markets, businesses that deal in
old books, to try to replace many of
the items.
Tierney noted that searching for
out-of-print books has been eased
with the advent of the World Wide
Web.
"We can replace things so much
more effectively," Tierney said. "If
we know we want something, we can
go out on the Web and search for it,
whereas in the old days, we had to go
out and send a letter to each out-of
print book dealer saying, 'Do you

happen to have this book in your
stock?'"
"In some cases if a book is very
difficult to get, and if it is out of copy
right, we can make a photocopy of it.
clean it and save it." Tierney said.
The library has also replaced 700
microfilm reels that were soaked in
the flood and 120 inches of micro
fiche.
According to Charles Eckman, di
rector of the Jonsson Library, the
documents in need of replacement
are in the United States and Califor
nia document collections.
"We've received some donations
from Occidental College, Millsaps
College and the University of Min
nesota and some replacements of
non-copyrighted material from the
California State Library." Eckman
explained.
Braun Music Library sustained
very little damage to its collections.
"Anything important is never on
the floor," explained Barbara Swaka,
director of the Music Library and
Archive of Recorded Sound. "The
duplicate LPs were sitting directly on
the floor because we had the intent of
discarding them."
Fixing facilities
Storm damage to the buildings
has now been repaired.
Green was fitted with new sheet
rock, molding, paint, shelves and car
pet during February, March and
April. Furniture was either repaired
or entirely replaced.
Damaged telecommunications
systems and connections were fixed
during this time period as well, and
the thin-wire network that had previ
ously existed was replaced by a
lObase network. SUNet connections
in the Green basement were lifted
approximately four feet above their
original level to prevent a reoccur
rence of this year's damage.
"There has been a reconfigura
tion of our water intake (after the
storm)," said Gallagher. "We've
added waterproofing (to new facili
ties)."
Damage to the facilities in the
basement of Cubberley was exten
sive, but loss of individual research
materials was relatively minimal.
"Students had to get everything
out for construction last summer,"
said Andre. "They hadn't the oppor
tunity to settle in, so there was not as
much damage to [people's belong
ings] as there might have been."
Cubberley was closed for a total of
two days after the storm. According
to Andre, in the following months,
mold was removed from building fix

tures, the basement received exten
sive cleaning, its floor was re-sealed
and everything was repainted.
The Education School's cafe,
which had been relocated to the Cub
berley basement shortly before the
storm, was refurbished as well.
Near Cubberley and Green addi
tional sump pumps were added.
Comparing disasters
The 1998 flood soaked 24,(XX)
more books than the Meyer Library
flood of 1978. which resulted from a
broken pipe. The impact the Febru
ary deluge had on access to materials
in Green East was also greater than
that resulting from the 1989 Loma

Prieta Earthquake.
"After the earthquake we just had
the nightmare of reshelving the
books. The damage to the physical
plant of Green East was minimal."
Tierney said.
"The large-tiered stack where a
million volumes sat wasn't damaged
because two years prior to it we had a
big project to reinforce it with struc
tural steel." she said.
However both Tierney and Ellis
emphasized the amount of salvaged
material from this winter's flood was
noteworthy.
"This project was extremely suc
cessful." said Ellis, crediting the ex
perience of the library staff, who
knew "exactly what to do and how to
take care of the books."
Tierney echoed this sentiment,
stating, "We've invested over the
long term in a good preservation de
partment. We have people on our
staff who know exactly what to do in
an emergency."
Tierney also acknowledged the

support University officials have
given the recovery efforts.
"It was clear from the beginning
that the University was very interest
ed in doing the right thing with the
collections. There was instant sup
port for doing whatever it would take
to recover them." Tiernev added.
Financing flood recovery
However, recovery has come at a
hefty price. Although final totals are
not yet in.it is estimated to have cost
between $3 and $5 million less the $1
million deduction on Stanford's in
surance, explained Jeffrey Seilbach.
Stanford's director of Risk Manage
ment.

This covers the costs of 112 reeve
drying, repairing and replacing
books, as well as fixing facilities.
It costs approximately %b to dry
and clean one book.
The University has been assigned a
Federal Emergency Management
Agency acceptance claim, but it may
be years before FEM A money is seen.
Future Planning
Facilities Operations is currently
studying the drainage systems on the
east side of campus.
According to Stephen Mischissin,
utilities manager for Facility Opera
tions. the goal of the study is to "iden
tify improvements that will prevent
storm water from entering the build
ings."
The results of the study will be an
nounced in September.
"We are already looking at poten
tial modifications that could be in
place by the time winter comes." he
added.

On Feb. 3, University President Gerhard Casper stopped to lend a
helping hand to then junior Meg Pearson and then sophomore
Taylor Robinson.

Students filed out of Green pushing book carts as a part of the University -wide effort to save the
library's holdings.

Volunteers attempted to save books on lower shelves at Green. The
books suffered damage mainly due to their positioning on the
shelves rather than their age or paper quality.

Then freshman Jeff Skopek and other students looked through
records in front of Braun Music Library on the day of the floods. Li
brary officials say that they did not lose valuable recordings, which
were stored away safely at the time of the flooding.
