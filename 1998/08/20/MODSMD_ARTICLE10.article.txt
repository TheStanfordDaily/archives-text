## 
### Sarah Rapawy 
Edward L. Ginzton, professor of
Applied Physics, died Aug. 13 at age
82 due to complications of Parkin
son's disease. Ginzton was well
known in the Silicon Valley for his
work with the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and for his involve
ment with the Silicon Valley-based
corporation Varian Associates.
When Ginzton immigrated in

1929, he was 13
and spoke little
English. Al
though he was
dropped from
sixth to first grade
because of his lan
guage skills, by
1936, he had grad-

uated from UC-
Berkeley and was pursuing his doc
torate in electrical engineering at
Stanford.
Ginzton was best known for co
founding Varian Associates, a bil
lion-dollar technology company
that sells health care equipment, in
strumentation and semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. A few
weeks ago, at Varian's 50th an
niversary celebration, Ginzton re
ceived a standing ovation and was
named by a company pamphlet as
"the key man among the founders."
Ginzton was one of the first peo

ple to apply energy electron accel
erator technology toward the treat
ment of cancer. Although the treat
ment earned no money for 16 years,
Ginzton's vision is now yielding
yearly profits of hundreds of mil
lions of dollars.
Ginzton lobbied for congres
sional support of the first large,
two-mile-long linear accelerator,
now known as the Stanford Linear
Accelerator, and headed its con
struction at Stanford after the accel
erator's original designer passed
away.
Additionally, to his scientific
and business achievements, Ginz
ton had a wide range of hobbies
and interests. When not garden
ing, viewing art exhibitions or re
building Model T Fords, Ginzton
co-chaired with Stanford alumnus
David Packard the Stanford Mid-
Peninsula Urban Coalition, an or
ganization which promotes low
income housing and small, minori
ty-owned businesses. His friends
remember him as "having a sense
of justice and appreciating the
needs of others." His 40 patented
inventions are now treating more
than a million cancer patients per
year.
Ginzton is survived by his wife
Artemas, four children, seven
grandchildren and one great-grand
child.
