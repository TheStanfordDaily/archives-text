# IIS names new directors

### Ritu Bhatnagar Editorial staff 
Profs. David Holloway and Coit
Blacker will face the challenge of co
ordinating staff from several depart
ments when they become director and

deputy director respectively of the Institute for Inter
national Studies (IIS) on Sept. 1.
The Institute, which is not affiliated with any Stan
ford departments, is funded by both the University and
private gifts. It includes component centers such as the
Asia / Pacific Research Center and the Global Envi
ronmental Forum. Holloway sees the institute's mis
sion as "[ensuring] that work on international issues is
done at Stanford."
Holloway, who has a background in international se
curity and the collapse of the Soviet Union, believes that
the institute is important in the post-Cold War period.
"We had a set of categories that countries fell into
during the Cold War," Holloway said. "That's [now]
fallen apart. One of the reasons for having internation
al studies is that countries don't fit into specific areas
anymore. Everything is interrelated, and lIS brings
people together from different areas."
Holloway, who succeeds International Agricultural
Policy Prof. Walter Falcon, has worked at the institute
as the co-director of the Center for International Secu
rity and Arms Control, a division of the institute. Hol
loway will continue his responsibilities as associate
dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences until
Dec. 31; during that time Blacker will assist Holloway
in his duties.
Falcon, who will now chair the Global Environmen
tal Forum with former University President Donald
Kennedy, noted that in his seven years as director he
has been most proud of his work in "helping establish
the development of strong interdisciplinary groups of
scholars at Stanford, who are working on environmen
tal issues."
"In a University that organizes by schools, depart

ments and disciplines, any organization that tries to go
across departments and across schools has its work cut
out for it," Falcon said.
Holloway welcomes the challenge, saying that Stan
ford's international studies and related departments
are particularly conducive to affecting work done in
this area.
Blacker will continue teaching in the Political Sci
ence Department and remain a member of the Coun
cil on Foreign Relations, the International Institute
for Strategic Studies and the Center for International
Security and Arms Control.
"David and I are inheriting a strong and vibrant in
stitution," Blacker said. "Our principal task, it seems to
me, will be to take lIS to the next level, both intellectu
ally and programmatically."
The appointments came after a search committee,
chaired by Engineering-Economic Systems / Opera
tions Prof. William Perry and Vice Provost and Dean
of Research Charles Kruger, spent approximately four
months developing a list of about 10 potential candi
dates for the positions. The committee then inter
viewed candidates and consulted with University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice
on its final decisions.
"We were looking for a leader — someone with a vi
sion and who is aware of the diverse interests of various
departments and schools," Kruger said. "We needed
someone who could reach out to the external environ
ment and who could raise money important to our
scholarship."
Departments of the institute have worked out of
both Encina Hall and Galvez House in the past years.
Falcon raised money during his term to have Encina
Hall renovated so that the institute and all of its pro
grams can be completely housed in Encina. This will
occur this fall.
This consolidation of the institute, Falcon said, was
one of the proudest achievements of his seven years as
director. "Being able to bring all of lIS under one roof
has been both challenging and exciting," he said.
