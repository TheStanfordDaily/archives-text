# Endowment is fourth in nation

Not only does Stanford rank
among the top universities in the na
tion, but it was also recognized in a
May 1998 article published in the
Chicago Tribune as having one of the
largest endowments in the country.
Stanford's endowment, which cur
rently rests at $4.5 billion, ranks be
hind Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
Yet the annual interest made on Stan
ford's endowment could pay the tu
ition costs for all of its undergradu
ates for a year.
Typically, endowment constitutes
the money donated to a university in
the form of a nonexpendable gift.
Universities invest these funds and
use the interest to support specific
projects and programs — ranging
from scholarships to research and
professorships to the building of new
facilities.
"Endowment is a source of funds
to support programs in perpetuity,"
said Dana Shelley, director of Budget
Planning. "The idea is that the contin
uing source of income is important to
the functioning of a university."
Stanford's endowment
Stanford's endowment was origi
nally founded with money from Jane
and Lcland Stanford. Today, alum
ni, friends and sometimes corpora
tions give funds toward Stanford's
endowment throughout the year.
Gifts are accepted by the Board of
Trustees without a review process or
screening.

"Gifts generally do not come with
restrictions," said John Ford, Stan
ford's vice president of development.
"There have only been a few cases
where we have had to negotiate with
the donors as to what their gift would
be used for."
If the donor wants the money to go
to the University as a whole, it is in
vested in general funds and goes
through a budgeting process to deter
mine the facilities that would benefit
most from the donation. The final de
cision is reported to the provost, who
must grant approval before the funds
can be allocated.
"Once the Development Office
has raised the funds, it's up to the Uni
versity to decide what it wants to
focus on and what its priorities are,"
said Shelley. "A couple of years ago,
a lot of endowment funds went to
graduate fellowships, because that
was what the University decided
needed aid."
Stanford Management Company
makes decisions on where to invest
the funds to ensure a growth rate of
the endowment. "The key is that you
want the endowment to grow," said
Brian Sandquist, Director of Finan
cial Analysis and Planning in the Of
fice of Business and Finance. "What
ever surplus that the endowment may
generate is re-invested to make it
grow. The understanding is that the
endowment can be here 100 years
from now and will still be able to fi
nancially support the university."
Most of Stanford's endowment
money, as is the case with Harvard,
Yale and Princeton, comes from its
alumni. Less than 5 percent of these

alumni, Ford states, are in a position
to "donate considerable funds," and
these individuals are solicited accord
ingly by the Office of Development.
Development officials often ask
alumni to provide aid for a graduate
school they may have attended or a
specific area of research that they
were involved in while they were stu
dents here.
"Out of the larger pot of alumni
we have, we focus on the smaller
group which has the capability to do
nate $100,000 or more," Ford said.
Stanford also receives some en
dowment funds from non-alumni,
such as parents of currently enrolled
students or individuals who have an
interest in the University.
The Office of Development raised
endowment funds of $148.5 million
last year, a sharp increase from the
$67.6 million that came in 1997. While
Ford attributes this increase mostly to
the improvement in the stock market,
he also credits a rise in alumni dona
tions.
In comparison to other universi
ties nationwide, only Harvard is rais
ing more money annually. Harvard
has approximately a $5 billion or $6
billion margin over its followers,
something that Sandquist believes is
because it is an older institution than

its competitors.
"Harvard's been around longer,
so they've had a greater amount of
time to invest funds," said Sandquist.
"I don't think it's necessarily smarter
investing than what Stanford's
doing."
Ford added that Harvard, Prince
ton and Yale have established alumni
connections with families that have,
for generations, had a "strong, phil
anthropic tradition."
Government funding
Approximately 30 percent of
Stanford's funding comes from the
state government in the form of direct
contracts and government grants.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
for example, is a contract with the fed
eral government.
Indirect costs constitute another
5.5 percent, which can be found in
government-sponsored research and
institutions like the National Institute
of Health, which is supported by gov
ernment money.
State funding, which has dwindled
since the 19605, has caused state insti
tutions to actively seek money from
alumni and the private sector as well.
All the University of California
schools had a sum total endowment

last noted at $3 billion.
Because endowment funds now
come almost exclusively from indi
vidual donors to state schools, there is
a close relationship developed be
tween the university and the donor.
"We work closely with our donors to
shape what kind of endowment pro
gram they help to establish," said
John Cash, executive director of de
velopment at UC-Berkelev.
"Today schools like Berkeley.
UCLA, and the University of Michi
gan receive less than 50 percent of
their income from state governments
and now aggressively raise money
from private sources as well as re
search monies from the federal gov
ernment," Ford said. "Many alumni
of public institutions have come to
understand that their tax monies
fund only a portion of public higher
education, and that gifts make a dif
ference in the quality of places like
Berkeley."
Just recently, UCLA launched a
campaign to raise $1.2 billion by 2002.
Its goal, like that of Harvard, is to
broaden the school's donor base and
to generate funds that support stu
dent and faculty programs at the uni
versity. Recent statistics show that a
mere 23 percent of UCLA's financial
support comes from the state.
