# Committee advises Pfefferbaum punishment

### Alex Tung Editorial staff 
The University advisory board reviewing the
case of Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum has rec
ommended to University President Gerhard
Casper that Pfefferbaum be suspended for three
years and fined $20,000.
If approved by Casper, the recommendation
will come as the second-most severe punishment
the University has brought on a professor.
When Pfefferbaum retired from his position at
the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Hospital in 19%,
the University considered the action to constitute a
retirement from his Stanford professorship as well.
Pfefferbaum then sued the University. A Santa
Clara County judge subsequently ruled in favor of
the professor, prompting Casper to begin formal
dismissal hearings against Pfefferbaum.
Pfefferbaum had been head of the Mental
Health Clinical Research Center, which was inves

tigating the causes of schizophrenia using brain
imaging techniques and won a national award for
its research last year.
The Faculty Advisory Board issued its recom
mendation at the end of June, but Casper asked for
more information regarding reasons for the
board's decision before he would deliberate on the
issue. Nearly a month later, the board had given
Casper the information he requested and he should
be ready to make his decision soon, according to
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron, chair of the Faculty
Advisory Board.
"This kind of case is unusual in that the presi
dent can't easily overturn the advisory board's de
cision," Efron said.
Efron said Casper may either approve the de
cision or ask the board to again review the case
and modify its decision, as per the guidelines set
forth in the faculty handbook.
Efron said members of the board felt it was
"not fair to release information on the report"

until both parties had seen the issue resolved.
He did say that the "decision and report make
it clear that this was not a wise thing for Pfeffer
baum to do," and that Pfefferbaum's actions
"were not protected by academic freedom."
Although Efron would not comment on the rea
sons for the severity of the board's recommenda
tion, he noted the case has already caused financial
loss for both Pfefferbaum and the University.
The decision not to dismiss Pfefferbaum is an
important one in the realm of faculty rights. "I felt
the faculty's essential rights were protected here,"
Efron said. "The decision not to seek dismissal was
an important step.
The University has dismissed only one tenured
professor, Bruce Franklin, who allegedly encour
aged students to burn campus buildings during the
1970s anti-war movement.
Pfefferbaum is now a researcher at SRI Con
sulting in Menlo Park and will "hopefully return in
three years," Efron said.
