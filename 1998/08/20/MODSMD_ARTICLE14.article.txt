## One Shak, Two Shaks, Old Shak, New Shak 
### Kenny Shei 
For a little over 25 years, a "Shak"
on Galvez Street has housed some of
Stanford's most notorious musicians.
But with the Band Shak's upcoming
demolition in October, Stanford
Band members are preparing to va
cate a building replete with stories
and experiences as eccentric as the
Band itself.
The Shak, which has been con
demned for a number of years, will be
demolished, along with Galvez
House, to make room for a new
Alumni Association building. Anoth
er Shak location, which will be tem
porary until the Band receives its new
permanent home, has not yet been
decided upon.
In the beginning
In the late 1910s, the University
Inn, a dining facility for men living in
Encina Hall, was moved (literally
picked up and placed) adjacent to the
sand volleyball courts and converted
into the Band Shak.
This first Band Shak was about 60
percent smaller than the current one.

There were many similarities, howev
er, like a vast collection of signs from
the hand's rustic journeys around and
out of the country. According to Uni
versity Bursar and former Band
member Jon Erickson, Class of '65,
many of these were appropriated ille
gally or otherwise found by Band
members.
Some of the signs from the original
building include one from the state
prison in San Quentin and another
one that says,"It is illegal to steal road
signs."
Today, the current Shak's main
room houses these old signs as well as

a variety of new ones. Among them
are signs that read, "Beaver Creek,"
"Nursing Home Crossing" and "Car
Wash: The Best Hand Job in
Burlingame."
In addition to road signs, the origi
nal Shak's walls were lined with egg
crates acquired from University Din
ing Services to improve the acoustics
of the small and rather make-shift
Shak.
The original Shak's location near
the tennis courts also brought oppor
tunities for mischief. Crafty band
members often terrorized players on
the tennis team through a hatch that
could be opened in the sloping roof of
the Shak.
"Occasionally, a couple of people
would take surgical tubing and use it
as a slingshot while another person
would fire water balloons through the
hatch," Erickson said. "There was a
grid on the floor of the Shak which
was accurate enough to allow the bal
loon to be launched onto the tennis
court within 2 feet of the intended tar
get."
The tennis players were not happy
with this, Erickson said.

Destruction Party
In 1973, the University concluded
that the original Band Shak was unfit
for habitation. "Inadequate exits,
lack of sprinklers, plus an abundance
of flammable material made the Shak
a fire trap." Erickson said.
On April 16, 1973, the University
planned to bulldoze the Shak. Not to
be outdone, the Band sent out invita
tions for the Band Shak destruction
party, held on Saturday, April 14,
with the footnote BYOSH — Brinp
Your Own Sledgehammer.
Some of the people who attended

included University President
Richard Lyman and his wife, Jing. At
2:47 p.m., Jing Lyman tossed a full
bottle of champagne through the last
remaining pane of glass in the Shak,
and the Band responded by playing
"All Right Now."

After this, the ceremoni
al cannonball was fired
through the Shak, signaling
to the 350 sledgehammer
wielding students that the
Shak was fair game.
After students worked
on destroying the Band
Shak for two hours, the
Band moved in, armed with
chain saws, giant ropes,
chains and a jeep. The band
wrapped ropes around the
post and pulled at it with the
jeep. When the center post
was pulled out, the 20-foot
high Shak stood as 6-foot
tall rubble.
Later the same night, at
about 10:30 p.m., the Shak
was engulfed in flames. The
fire, fueled by the dry red
wood, tar paper and egg
crates that comprised the
Shak burned very hot, prov
ing that it was, indeed, a fire
hazard.
Then-Fire Chief Frank
Jurian ordered the firefight
ers to let the fire burn and
had them douse the nearby
eucalyptus trees to prevent
them from igniting. Jurian
said, "the fire was definitely
set (on purpose)," and that

he was "fairly certain" that a Band
member had started it. Doug Peter
son, the Band Manager at the time,
responded, "I have no idea who did
it."
According to junior alto saxo
phone player Dan Kramer, the ashes
of the original Shak are now kept in a
stolen garbage can.
The current Shak
After the destruction party, the
Band moved into its current home on
Galvez Street. The current Shak was
formerly a steam plant and the head
quarters of the ROTC on campus.
Current Band Manager Claire
Bacher, a fifth-year student, cites a
variety of aspects of the Shak that
make it a unique place on campus.
"People always say the first thing
they notice when they come into the
shak is that it smells," she said with a
laugh, "but after four years of being
here, I don't notice it anymore."

Senior Kim Myers, the Band's
alumni relations coordinator, re
members the smells she encountered
while working in props her freshman
year.
"Yes, the smells were always inter
esting," she said. "In props, I gradual-

ly began to have no problem cleaning
up mold, ants or empty containers
filled with unknown liquids. My guess
is the smell was a combination of
those."
Other than the Shak's distinctive
smell, Bacher, who has been involved
in the Band since spring quarter of
1995, said band members hold an at
tachment to certain elements of the
Shak, as well as the building itself.
"It's the only place on campus
where you can leave a mark of your
self and come back years later and it'll
still be there," she said. "Alumni can
come back and see a sign and say,
'Hey, I remember that road trip'," she
said.
Asst. Band Manager John Stemm
le agreed. "It has more character than
most buildings on campus," he said.
Some recall off-the-wall activities
they were involved in at the present
Shak. Patrick Neschleba, a former
drum major, "fondly remembers

chasing squirrels around the Shak."
He also recalls his first "introduction"
of sorts to the Band and its Shak.
"1 remember walking into the fall
Shak party as a freshman," he said.
"There was this sense of walking into
this mystical, shady place with signs

and smells and people pushing
through to get velvet hammers. It was
pretty interesting to walk into this ec
clectic place when you've only been
at Stanford for a few days and to see
things that you hadn't seen anywhere
else on campus."
"Coming into the Shak for the first
time was pretty frightening," Bacher
said. "The first few rehearsals were
just a daze."
On any given day in the Band
Shak during football season, one
might find band members preparing
for a rally in full cross-dressed attire,
instrument sections rehearsing or the
drum major preparing his costume
for the next toe-stomping field show.
"It's such a compact area to put
150 people into," said Neschleba.
"Because of the size of it, there were
times in the Shak when everyone was
grooving together, blasting music. It
was those times — when the Band
was just being the Band — that might

be hard to recreate in a larger area, as
the new place will probably be. You
won't get that tight, intense feeling
you get in this Shak."
Inside the Shak
The present Shak has some no
table rituals associated with it, as well

as a few historical secrets.
The room across from the re
hearsal hall is called Michelob Ter
race because of the Michelob sign
that hangs above it. The favorite
room of Chris Henderson, the cur
rent Tree, the "Mich" Terrace is
where the Band conducts "swacs."
"[Swacs] are what every tree must
go through at the beginning of tree
dom," he said. He described the initi
ation rites as "deeply frightening and
disconcerting, but at the same time
exciting and strangely arousing."
Many smaller rooms in the Shak
hold various items of historical value.
A library houses much of the music
the band has played in previous years.
The drum major has his or her own
room, called the Friendship Room.
"It has a water bed in it," said
Neschleba, laughing. "I'll limit my
comments to that. But seriously, you
can't beat the water bed. Where else
on campus are you going to find a

water bed?"
The props room in the Shak holds
all the costumes for Band members.
"The props room is really cool," said
Myers. "You can go in there and see
all the costumes. It was usually fairly
quiet there, and I would do my home-

work there. Sometimes when
I was too lazy to go home, I'd
take naps in there."
Neschleba also devel
oped a "home-away-from
dorm" mentality toward the
Shak. "When you're heavily
involved in an activity and
spend all your time there, it
becomes a place where you
can just hang out and play
your instruments."
Other memorabilia in the
Band Shak includes a check
for $50 made out to Arthur
Barnes, director of the Band
from 1963 to 19%. He had
won a bet to march in the
Rose Bowl Parade while car
rying a tuba.
There are even some me
mentos from the previous
Shak. The green front wall
and door of the original Band
Shak is inside of the current
one. Stemmle said the Band
would most likely take the
wall into the Band's new
home.
Also in the Shak are old
Tree costumes, a table with a
model of a football field on
its top and magnetic pegs,
which the staff uses to
arrange field shows, and the

toilet used to make a drink called the
"Velvet Hammer."
According to Kramer, who has
been in charge of making Velvet
Hammers at the last few Band Shak
parties, "Someone about 10 years
ago actually stole the toilet. Now, we
bolt it onto a desk and mix the ingre
dients in the water supply tank [of the
toilet].
Bund Shak part 111
Although items stored in the Shak
have a mystique of their own,
Stemmle said much of the Shak's
presence as "a fixture of the band"
has to do with the building itself.
"All the signs we can take with
us," he said. "More people are sad to
see the building go as a whole."
Although the new location has
not been officially announced, some
Band members are optimistic about
the change. "Of course we are sad to

see the Shak go," said junior Hilary
Bienstock, a trumpet player. "But we
all knew that the Shak would have to
go at some point, and I think that a
new Shak will be a very positive
change for the Band, the beginning
of a new era."
Others are waiting for the Univer
sity's decision on the Band's new lo
cation. "It remains to be seen whether
the University will provide reason
able facilities," Neschleba said.
Although signs and other equip
ment can be moved to another loca
tion, written messages on the walls
cannot be easily moved. In the Dollie
Room, where Dollies practice and
sectional meetings are often held.
Dollies have written their names on
the walls or left their "signatures" in
an interesting fashion.
"In the '80s, one group of Dollies
put paint on their breasts and left
breast prints on the wall," Kramer
said.
The Shak's beer bottle target is
also something that may be lost in the
move. "There was something really
cool about coming back after a game
that we lost and chucking an empty
beer bottle at the target," said
Neschleba. "When the bottle hits the
target, it smashes into little pieces
that fall into a pit below. There aren't
many places on campus where you
can do something like that."
Because not everything in the cur
rent Band Shak can be moved, the
Band hopes to preserve as much of
the Shak as possible.
"We are planning on taking digi
tal photographs of the Band Shak
and perhaps in a few years, someone
can take a virtual 3-D tour of the
Shak on CD-ROM," Kramer said.

Although there are no known
plans for the Band to participate in
the demolition of the Shak as it did in
1973, Neschleba said that plans, if
they exist, are likely "top secret," and
probably won't be known until they
are implemented

"Who knows what the Band has
in store," he speculated.
Although Band members will
miss the Shak, Stemmle said the ap
peal of the Shak is as much a product
of the Band as it is the building itself.
Stemmle described going to the
Shak alone at different times of the
day.
"At 3 in the morning, it can be a
little freaky," he said. "Sometimes
there are squirrels around in the
Shak. and there's and old heater that
makes a bit of noise. In the after
noons it just seems really empty.
There's really no other way to de
scribe it.... It's coolest when every
one's there and everyone's dome
stuff."
Stemmle awaits the fall demoli
tion of the Shak with anticipation.
"I'm worried we won't get a great
building to move into," he said. "I
don't want the Band to lose any of its
character."

grid on the floor of the Shak which
was accurate enough to allow the bal
loon to be launched onto the tennis
court within 2 feet of the intended tar
get."
The tennis players were not happy
with this, Erickson said.

Destruction Party
In 1973, the University concluded
that the original Band Shak was unfit
for habitation. "Inadequate exits,
lack of sprinklers, plus an abundance
of flammable material made the Shak
a fire trap." Erickson said.
On April 16, 1973, the University
planned to bulldoze the Shak. Not to
be outdone, the Band sent out invita
tions for the Band Shak destruction
party, held on Saturday, April 14,
with the footnote BYOSH — Brinp
Your Own Sledgehammer.
Some of the people who attended

included University President
Richard Lyman and his wife, Jing. At
2:47 p.m., Jing Lyman tossed a full
bottle of champagne through the last
remaining pane of glass in the Shak,
and the Band responded by playing
"All Right Now."

After this, the ceremoni
al cannonball was fired
through the Shak, signaling
to the 350 sledgehammer
wielding students that the
Shak was fair game.
After students worked
on destroying the Band
Shak for two hours, the
Band moved in, armed with
chain saws, giant ropes,
chains and a jeep. The band
wrapped ropes around the
post and pulled at it with the
jeep. When the center post
was pulled out, the 20-foot
high Shak stood as 6-foot
tall rubble.
Later the same night, at
about 10:30 p.m., the Shak
was engulfed in flames. The
fire, fueled by the dry red
wood, tar paper and egg
crates that comprised the
Shak burned very hot, prov
ing that it was, indeed, a fire
hazard.
Then-Fire Chief Frank
Jurian ordered the firefight
ers to let the fire burn and
had them douse the nearby
eucalyptus trees to prevent
them from igniting. Jurian
said, "the fire was definitely
set (on purpose)," and that

he was "fairly certain" that a Band
member had started it. Doug Peter
son, the Band Manager at the time,
responded, "I have no idea who did
it."
According to junior alto saxo
phone player Dan Kramer, the ashes
of the original Shak are now kept in a
stolen garbage can.
The current Shak
After the destruction party, the
Band moved into its current home on
Galvez Street. The current Shak was
formerly a steam plant and the head
quarters of the ROTC on campus.
Current Band Manager Claire
Bacher, a fifth-year student, cites a
variety of aspects of the Shak that
make it a unique place on campus.
"People always say the first thing
they notice when they come into the
shak is that it smells," she said with a
laugh, "but after four years of being
here, I don't notice it anymore."

Senior Kim Myers, the Band's
alumni relations coordinator, re
members the smells she encountered
while working in props her freshman
year.
"Yes, the smells were always inter
esting," she said. "In props, I gradual-

ly began to have no problem cleaning
up mold, ants or empty containers
filled with unknown liquids. My guess
is the smell was a combination of
those."
Other than the Shak's distinctive
smell, Bacher, who has been involved
in the Band since spring quarter of
1995, said band members hold an at
tachment to certain elements of the
Shak, as well as the building itself.
"It's the only place on campus
where you can leave a mark of your
self and come back years later and it'll
still be there," she said. "Alumni can
come back and see a sign and say,
'Hey, I remember that road trip'," she
said.
Asst. Band Manager John Stemm
le agreed. "It has more character than
most buildings on campus," he said.
Some recall off-the-wall activities
they were involved in at the present
Shak. Patrick Neschleba, a former
drum major, "fondly remembers

chasing squirrels around the Shak."
He also recalls his first "introduction"
of sorts to the Band and its Shak.
"1 remember walking into the fall
Shak party as a freshman," he said.
"There was this sense of walking into
this mystical, shady place with signs

and smells and people pushing
through to get velvet hammers. It was
pretty interesting to walk into this ec
clectic place when you've only been
at Stanford for a few days and to see
things that you hadn't seen anywhere
else on campus."
"Coming into the Shak for the first
time was pretty frightening," Bacher
said. "The first few rehearsals were
just a daze."
On any given day in the Band
Shak during football season, one
might find band members preparing
for a rally in full cross-dressed attire,
instrument sections rehearsing or the
drum major preparing his costume
for the next toe-stomping field show.
"It's such a compact area to put
150 people into," said Neschleba.
"Because of the size of it, there were
times in the Shak when everyone was
grooving together, blasting music. It
was those times — when the Band
was just being the Band — that might

be hard to recreate in a larger area, as
the new place will probably be. You
won't get that tight, intense feeling
you get in this Shak."
Inside the Shak
The present Shak has some no
table rituals associated with it, as well

as a few historical secrets.
The room across from the re
hearsal hall is called Michelob Ter
race because of the Michelob sign
that hangs above it. The favorite
room of Chris Henderson, the cur
rent Tree, the "Mich" Terrace is
where the Band conducts "swacs."
"[Swacs] are what every tree must
go through at the beginning of tree
dom," he said. He described the initi
ation rites as "deeply frightening and
disconcerting, but at the same time
exciting and strangely arousing."
Many smaller rooms in the Shak
hold various items of historical value.
A library houses much of the music
the band has played in previous years.
The drum major has his or her own
room, called the Friendship Room.
"It has a water bed in it," said
Neschleba, laughing. "I'll limit my
comments to that. But seriously, you
can't beat the water bed. Where else
on campus are you going to find a

water bed?"
The props room in the Shak holds
all the costumes for Band members.
"The props room is really cool," said
Myers. "You can go in there and see
all the costumes. It was usually fairly
quiet there, and I would do my home-

work there. Sometimes when
I was too lazy to go home, I'd
take naps in there."
Neschleba also devel
oped a "home-away-from
dorm" mentality toward the
Shak. "When you're heavily
involved in an activity and
spend all your time there, it
becomes a place where you
can just hang out and play
your instruments."
Other memorabilia in the
Band Shak includes a check
for $50 made out to Arthur
Barnes, director of the Band
from 1963 to 19%. He had
won a bet to march in the
Rose Bowl Parade while car
rying a tuba.
There are even some me
mentos from the previous
Shak. The green front wall
and door of the original Band
Shak is inside of the current
one. Stemmle said the Band
would most likely take the
wall into the Band's new
home.
Also in the Shak are old
Tree costumes, a table with a
model of a football field on
its top and magnetic pegs,
which the staff uses to
arrange field shows, and the

toilet used to make a drink called the
"Velvet Hammer."
According to Kramer, who has
been in charge of making Velvet
Hammers at the last few Band Shak
parties, "Someone about 10 years
ago actually stole the toilet. Now, we
bolt it onto a desk and mix the ingre
dients in the water supply tank [of the
toilet].
Bund Shak part 111
Although items stored in the Shak
have a mystique of their own,
Stemmle said much of the Shak's
presence as "a fixture of the band"
has to do with the building itself.
"All the signs we can take with
us," he said. "More people are sad to
see the building go as a whole."
Although the new location has
not been officially announced, some
Band members are optimistic about
the change. "Of course we are sad to

see the Shak go," said junior Hilary
Bienstock, a trumpet player. "But we
all knew that the Shak would have to
go at some point, and I think that a
new Shak will be a very positive
change for the Band, the beginning
of a new era."
Others are waiting for the Univer
sity's decision on the Band's new lo
cation. "It remains to be seen whether
the University will provide reason
able facilities," Neschleba said.
Although signs and other equip
ment can be moved to another loca
tion, written messages on the walls
cannot be easily moved. In the Dollie
Room, where Dollies practice and
sectional meetings are often held.
Dollies have written their names on
the walls or left their "signatures" in
an interesting fashion.
"In the '80s, one group of Dollies
put paint on their breasts and left
breast prints on the wall," Kramer
said.
The Shak's beer bottle target is
also something that may be lost in the
move. "There was something really
cool about coming back after a game
that we lost and chucking an empty
beer bottle at the target," said
Neschleba. "When the bottle hits the
target, it smashes into little pieces
that fall into a pit below. There aren't
many places on campus where you
can do something like that."
Because not everything in the cur
rent Band Shak can be moved, the
Band hopes to preserve as much of
the Shak as possible.
"We are planning on taking digi
tal photographs of the Band Shak
and perhaps in a few years, someone
can take a virtual 3-D tour of the
Shak on CD-ROM," Kramer said.

Although there are no known
plans for the Band to participate in
the demolition of the Shak as it did in
1973, Neschleba said that plans, if
they exist, are likely "top secret," and
probably won't be known until they
are implemented

"Who knows what the Band has
in store," he speculated.
Although Band members will
miss the Shak, Stemmle said the ap
peal of the Shak is as much a product
of the Band as it is the building itself.
Stemmle described going to the
Shak alone at different times of the
day.
"At 3 in the morning, it can be a
little freaky," he said. "Sometimes
there are squirrels around in the
Shak. and there's and old heater that
makes a bit of noise. In the after
noons it just seems really empty.
There's really no other way to de
scribe it.... It's coolest when every
one's there and everyone's dome
stuff."
Stemmle awaits the fall demoli
tion of the Shak with anticipation.
"I'm worried we won't get a great
building to move into," he said. "I
don't want the Band to lose any of its
character."

home to use after the demolition of the Shak, which is slated for mid-October.

Sam Mankiewicz — Daily
The trombone section, or "bonz," distinguishes itself from other sec
tions with the crest of skull and cross-trombones on the instrument
lockers.
For a little over 25 years, a "Shak"
on Galvez Street has housed some of
Stanford's most notorious musicians.
But with the Band Shak's upcoming
demolition in October, Stanford
Band members are preparing to va
cate a building replete with stories
and experiences as eccentric as the
Band itself.
The Shak, which has been con
demned for a number of years, will be
demolished, along with Galvez
House, to make room for a new
Alumni Association building. Anoth
er Shak location, which will be tem
porary until the Band receives its new
permanent home, has not yet been
decided upon.
In the beginning
In the late 1910s, the University
Inn, a dining facility for men living in
Encina Hall, was moved (literally
picked up and placed) adjacent to the
sand volleyball courts and converted
into the Band Shak.
This first Band Shak was about 60
percent smaller than the current one.

There were many similarities, howev
er, like a vast collection of signs from
the hand's rustic journeys around and
out of the country. According to Uni
versity Bursar and former Band
member Jon Erickson, Class of '65,
many of these were appropriated ille
gally or otherwise found by Band
members.
Some of the signs from the original
building include one from the state
prison in San Quentin and another
one that says,"It is illegal to steal road
signs."
Today, the current Shak's main
room houses these old signs as well as

a variety of new ones. Among them
are signs that read, "Beaver Creek,"
"Nursing Home Crossing" and "Car
Wash: The Best Hand Job in
Burlingame."
In addition to road signs, the origi
nal Shak's walls were lined with egg
crates acquired from University Din
ing Services to improve the acoustics
of the small and rather make-shift
Shak.
The original Shak's location near
the tennis courts also brought oppor
tunities for mischief. Crafty band
members often terrorized players on
the tennis team through a hatch that
could be opened in the sloping roof of
the Shak.
"Occasionally, a couple of people
would take surgical tubing and use it
as a slingshot while another person
would fire water balloons through the
hatch," Erickson said. "There was a
grid on the floor of the Shak which
was accurate enough to allow the bal
loon to be launched onto the tennis
court within 2 feet of the intended tar
get."
The tennis players were not happy

According to junior alto saxo
phone player Dan Kramer, the ashes
of the original Shak are now kept in a
stolen garbage can.
The current Shak
After the destruction party, the
Band moved into its current home on
Galvez Street. The current Shak was
formerly a steam plant and the head
quarters of the ROTC on campus.
Current Band Manager Claire
Bacher, a fifth-year student, cites a
variety of aspects of the Shak that
make it a unique place on campus.
"People always say the first thing
they notice when they come into the
shak is that it smells," she said with a
laugh, "but after four years of being
here, I don't notice it anymore."

Senior Kim Myers, the Band's
alumni relations coordinator, re
members the smells she encountered
while working in props her freshman
year.
"Yes, the smells were always inter
esting," she said. "In props, I gradual-

ly began to have no problem cleaning
up mold, ants or empty containers
filled with unknown liquids. My guess
is the smell was a combination of
those."
Other than the Shak's distinctive
smell, Bacher, who has been involved
in the Band since spring quarter of
1995, said band members hold an at
tachment to certain elements of the
Shak, as well as the building itself.
"It's the only place on campus
where you can leave a mark of your
self and come back years later and it'll
still be there," she said. "Alumni can
come back and see a sign and say,
'Hey, I remember that road trip'," she
said.
Asst. Band Manager John Stemm
le agreed. "It has more character than
most buildings on campus," he said.
Some recall off-the-wall activities
they were involved in at the present
Shak. Patrick Neschleba, a former
drum major, "fondly remembers

chasing squirrels around the Shak."
He also recalls his first "introduction"
of sorts to the Band and its Shak.
"1 remember walking into the fall
Shak party as a freshman," he said.
"There was this sense of walking into
this mystical, shady place with signs

and smells and people pushing
through to get velvet hammers. It was
pretty interesting to walk into this ec
clectic place when you've only been
at Stanford for a few days and to see
things that you hadn't seen anywhere
else on campus."
"Coming into the Shak for the first
time was pretty frightening," Bacher
said. "The first few rehearsals were
just a daze."
On any given day in the Band
Shak during football season, one
might find band members preparing
for a rally in full cross-dressed attire,
instrument sections rehearsing or the
drum major preparing his costume
for the next toe-stomping field show.
"It's such a compact area to put
150 people into," said Neschleba.
"Because of the size of it, there were
times in the Shak when everyone was
grooving together, blasting music. It
was those times — when the Band
was just being the Band — that might

be hard to recreate in a larger area, as
the new place will probably be. You
won't get that tight, intense feeling
you get in this Shak."
Inside the Shak
The present Shak has some no
table rituals associated with it, as well

as a few historical secrets.
The room across from the re
hearsal hall is called Michelob Ter
race because of the Michelob sign
that hangs above it. The favorite
room of Chris Henderson, the cur
rent Tree, the "Mich" Terrace is
where the Band conducts "swacs."
"[Swacs] are what every tree must
go through at the beginning of tree
dom," he said. He described the initi
ation rites as "deeply frightening and
disconcerting, but at the same time
exciting and strangely arousing."
Many smaller rooms in the Shak
hold various items of historical value.
A library houses much of the music
the band has played in previous years.
The drum major has his or her own
room, called the Friendship Room.
"It has a water bed in it," said
Neschleba, laughing. "I'll limit my
comments to that. But seriously, you
can't beat the water bed. Where else
on campus are you going to find a

water bed?"
The props room in the Shak holds
all the costumes for Band members.
"The props room is really cool," said
Myers. "You can go in there and see
all the costumes. It was usually fairly
quiet there, and I would do my home-

work there. Sometimes when
I was too lazy to go home, I'd
take naps in there."
Neschleba also devel
oped a "home-away-from
dorm" mentality toward the
Shak. "When you're heavily
involved in an activity and
spend all your time there, it
becomes a place where you
can just hang out and play
your instruments."
Other memorabilia in the
Band Shak includes a check
for $50 made out to Arthur
Barnes, director of the Band
from 1963 to 19%. He had
won a bet to march in the
Rose Bowl Parade while car
rying a tuba.
There are even some me
mentos from the previous
Shak. The green front wall
and door of the original Band
Shak is inside of the current
one. Stemmle said the Band
would most likely take the
wall into the Band's new
home.
Also in the Shak are old
Tree costumes, a table with a
model of a football field on
its top and magnetic pegs,
which the staff uses to
arrange field shows, and the

toilet used to make a drink called the
"Velvet Hammer."
According to Kramer, who has
been in charge of making Velvet
Hammers at the last few Band Shak
parties, "Someone about 10 years
ago actually stole the toilet. Now, we
bolt it onto a desk and mix the ingre
dients in the water supply tank [of the
toilet].
Bund Shak part 111
Although items stored in the Shak
have a mystique of their own,
Stemmle said much of the Shak's
presence as "a fixture of the band"
has to do with the building itself.
"All the signs we can take with
us," he said. "More people are sad to
see the building go as a whole."
Although the new location has
not been officially announced, some
Band members are optimistic about
the change. "Of course we are sad to

see the Shak go," said junior Hilary
Bienstock, a trumpet player. "But we
all knew that the Shak would have to
go at some point, and I think that a
new Shak will be a very positive
change for the Band, the beginning
of a new era."
Others are waiting for the Univer
sity's decision on the Band's new lo
cation. "It remains to be seen whether
the University will provide reason
able facilities," Neschleba said.
Although signs and other equip
ment can be moved to another loca
tion, written messages on the walls
cannot be easily moved. In the Dollie
Room, where Dollies practice and
sectional meetings are often held.
Dollies have written their names on
the walls or left their "signatures" in
an interesting fashion.
"In the '80s, one group of Dollies
put paint on their breasts and left
breast prints on the wall," Kramer
said.
The Shak's beer bottle target is
also something that may be lost in the
move. "There was something really
cool about coming back after a game
that we lost and chucking an empty
beer bottle at the target," said
Neschleba. "When the bottle hits the
target, it smashes into little pieces
that fall into a pit below. There aren't
many places on campus where you
can do something like that."
Because not everything in the cur
rent Band Shak can be moved, the
Band hopes to preserve as much of
the Shak as possible.
"We are planning on taking digi
tal photographs of the Band Shak
and perhaps in a few years, someone
can take a virtual 3-D tour of the
Shak on CD-ROM," Kramer said.

Although there are no known
plans for the Band to participate in
the demolition of the Shak as it did in
1973, Neschleba said that plans, if
they exist, are likely "top secret," and
probably won't be known until they
are implemented

"Who knows what the Band has
in store," he speculated.
Although Band members will
miss the Shak, Stemmle said the ap
peal of the Shak is as much a product
of the Band as it is the building itself.
Stemmle described going to the
Shak alone at different times of the
day.
"At 3 in the morning, it can be a
little freaky," he said. "Sometimes
there are squirrels around in the
Shak. and there's and old heater that
makes a bit of noise. In the after
noons it just seems really empty.
There's really no other way to de
scribe it.... It's coolest when every
one's there and everyone's dome
stuff."
Stemmle awaits the fall demoli
tion of the Shak with anticipation.
"I'm worried we won't get a great
building to move into," he said. "I
don't want the Band to lose any of its
character."
