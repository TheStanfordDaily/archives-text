New fields and new faces will get some
seasoning before students arrive in mid-
September.
Stanford football's 14 new starters will
get three home games under their belt be
fore many students return. Cardinal
women's volleyball opens its season second
in the Pacific 10 Conference predictions
after losing All-Americans Kristin Folkl
and Lisa Sharpley. And field hockey brings
back most of its roster and calls the new
Varsity Hockey Turf Field home.
Maybe the most exciting development
in the next few weeks will be the addition of
lights to New Maloney Field. Stanford's
soccer teams will open their home regular
season slate under the lights — assuming
they are installed in time. Delays in light in
stallation forced a change in the starting
time of the men's exhibition Wednesday
against Sao Paulo University of Brazil.
In addition to the lights, concrete
bleachers have been added to 2,(XX)-scat
New Maloney Field. But lights are the key.
"It's really hard to market the game
when you're playing at 2 p.m. on a Friday
afternoon," said men's head coach Bobby
Clark. "New Maloney now becomes a place
where every Friday night you can see Stan
ford soccer."
While the men's soccer and field hockey
teams will rely on veterans to build on last
year's success, the women's soccer squad
hopes eight returning starters can improve
upon last year's third-place Pac-10 finish.
Football and volleyball face the most
questions of all. Football coach Tyrone
Willingham hopes to avoid consecutive los
ing seasons, and volleyball coach Don Shaw
would like to garner a fifth consecutive Pac
-10 title, if not a third straight NCAA crown.

Football greets Pac-10 season early
For the first time since 1993, Stanford
opens its conference slate prior to the third
week of the season. No. 24 Arizona comes
to Stanford Stadium on Sept. 12 on the
heels of a nationally televised Thursday
night matchup against Hawaii on Sept. 3.
The Wildcats have their sights set on a
second consecutive bowl win, and with the
Pac-10 now allied with a fifth bowl, the new
Mele Kalikimaka Bowl, Dick Tomey's
team has an even better chance.
Stanford hopes to have notched a win
under its belt before facing Arizona. The
Cardinal will look to defeat San Jose State
for the seventh consecutive time when they
square off in both teams' opener Sept. 5.
The Cardinal depth chart will likely see
plenty of activity before then. Junior Todd
Husak and redshirt freshman Randy Fasani
are still battling to start at quarterback.
But quarterback is not the only position
where a first-time starter will take the field
in two weeks. Eight other projected starters
— junior wide receiver Deßonnie Pitts, ju
nior running back Juan-Carlos Lacey, se
nior fullback Maxwell Stevenson, junior
defensive end Sam Benner, senior nose
tackle Andrew Currie, junior defensive end
Riall Johnson, redshirt freshman corner
back Ruben Carter and redshirt freshman
free safety Jamien McCullum — have
never started a game.
Volleyball takes to the road
No. 3 USC hopes to overtake No. 4 Stan
ford in the race for Pac-10 supremacy.
While Stanford returns All-Amencan ju
nior outside hitter Kerri Walsh, its middle
blockers have never started a match.
Sophomore Jennifer Detmer should
lead the way in the middle, while freshmen
Sara Sandrik and Tara Conrad fight over
the other spot. Juniors Sarah Clark and

Jaimi Gregory expect to nail down full-time
starting spots at outside hitter, and sopho
mores Lindsay Kagawa and Robyn Lewis
will vie for the setter position.
With two road tournaments early next
month, volleyball will not open its home
season until the first day of Orientation,
Sept. 18 — against the Women of Troy.
Soccer, field hockey usher in new eras
Men's soccer surprised the nation last
year by jumping to a No. 2 national ranking.
After that, the squad staggered to the finish
line. With nine starters back, the 1998 team
holds down the No. 21 spot in the polls and
battles three local teams to open the season.
The Cardinal hopes to avenge a disappoint
ing loss from the year before in its home
opener Sept. 4 against Santa Clara.
The women's soccer team suffered a
midseason slump en route to its poorest
record in 10 years. But the squad closed the
season on a 7-0-1 run. Co-captain Kelly
Adamson shined as a freshman midfielder
in 1995, and she returns after two years on
the sidelines with knee injuries.
With a school-record 16 wins in 1997,
Cardinal field hockey has lofty goals. Al
though last year's goalkeeper, Kelly Nay
lor, has graduated, the squad returns its top
seven scorers. Its new Astro Turf field is lo
cated between the Stanford Softball Com
plex and practice football fields.
Cross country, water polo open elsewhere
Men's cross country vies for a third con
secutive national title in 1998, and the
women hope to avenge a tough two-point
loss at last year's NCAA Championship.
Both return much of their depth from 1997.
The men's water polo team has not
cracked the 20-win barrier since 1994.
However, the eight-time national champs
return their top three scorers and Ail-
American goalkeeper Chris Aguilera.
