# Bryan leads Stanford's five wild cards at Open
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
The wild-card list into tennis' U.S. Open
has a distinct cardinal look.
Five former Stanford players were among
the 16 men and women granted wild-card en
tries into the draw for the final Grand Slam
event of the year, which begins Aug. 31 in
Flushing, N.Y. Brackets will be announced
Tuesday.
7 wo members of last year's national cham
pion men's team will play in their first U.S.
Open. NCAA singles champion Bob Bryan,
who left Stanford after two years to turn pro
this summer, joins Paul Goldstein, who grad
uated in June and is ranked 264 th in the
world.
Yesterday, the 476th-ranked Bryan lost 6-

4, 6-4 to the world's top-ranked player,
Marcelo Rios of Chile, in the second round of
the RCA Championships in Indianapolis.
Patrick McEnroe, Class of '88, earned a
nod despite playing in just one tournament
this year. The one-time U.S. Open quarterfi
nalist ranks 653 rd in the world, 527 spots be
hind Alex O'Brien, Class of '92. O'Brien is
trying to return to the top-30 spot he occupied
last year.
Only 60th-ranked Jeff Tarango, a three
time All-American from 1987-89, ranks high
er among former Stanford players than
O'Brien.
Stanford's highest-ranked woman also
earned a return trip to the Open. Lilia Oster
loh, who debuted as a pro in last year's Open,
will try to crack the top 10() with a strong per
formance in New York.
