## Draeger's teaches barbecue basics 
### Elise Lipkowitz Editorial staff 
Move over TV dinner and that
casserole you cooked on Sunday to
last you through the week. At
Draeger's Culinary Center, nestled
in a corner on the second floor of
Draeger's market in Menlo Park,
some of the region's and nation's
best chefs share their secrets for de
lectable delights you can prepare at
home.
Spending an evening at Draeger's
offers not only a great way to expand
your culinary repertoire, but it is also
a terrific alternative to dinner and a
movie for friends and couples.

The center's classes range from
cooking basics — such as preparing
soups, sauces and breads — for those
just donning aprons, to more ad
vanced courses for the seasoned
cook. Some are hands-on, providing
a chance to get your hands dirty with
the chef; others are demonstration
courses where the chef prepares the
food, provides cooking tips and a his
tory of the food or cooking technique
and fields audience questions. Class
es are single session meetings lasting
approximately two to three hours.
All classes include a meal and a glass
of wine or a beverage of your choice.
"Julia Child launched gastrono
my for Americans and it has become
more and more popular," explained
Pamela Keith, director of Draeger's
Culinary Center. "Cooking schools
are just blossoming."
Keith, who coordinates the pro
gram and invites chefs to teach there,
has noted that since the culinary cen
ter's inception six years ago,
Draeger's is drawing more high pro
file chefs and more young people in
terested in expanding the variety of
foods they feature. Additionally she
noted that Draeger's culinary school
is drawing "more and more men,
couples, children and teenagers" to
its programs
"People are interested in practical
classes such as dinner in 30 minutes
and pasta workshops," Keith said.
She also explained that she takes
cooking trends into account when
she plans programming.

"Right now Mediterranean and
Italian cuisine are hot, hot, hot as is
fusion or global cooking — a combi
nation of Pacific, Asian and Califor
nia cuisine," said Keith.
Several weeks ago, I attended one
of the demonstration classes, Rick
Rodgers' "Down Home Barbecue,"
to get a taste of the Draeger's Culi
nary School experience.
Rodgers, like many of the chefs
who teach at Draeger's, has authored
numerous cookbooks. He was re
cently honored by Bon Appetit mag
azine as one of America's favorite
cooking teachers.
Rodgers began the class dispelling
preconceived notions about barbe
cue. "What you do most of the time
at home and call barbecue is actually
grilling," Rodgers said. "Barbecue
involves cooking slowly over low
heat."
Rodgers then provided the class
with background about the history of
barbecue and its regional variations.
He noted that in different parts of the
country different types of wood chips
are used and different ingredients are
put into barbecue sauce.
"I've even heard of Coca Cola
being put into barbecue sauces in
Georgia," Rodgers said lightheart
edly.
As he walked the class through
preparation of specific dishes such as
Tex-Mex Black Bean Dip, Summer
Vegetable Pasta Salad with Creamy
Ranch Dressing, Spicy Cabbage and
Tomato Slaw and Mango Shortcakes

with Caramel Sauce, Rodgers pro
vided general guidance ranging from
tips on the preparation of pasta to
how to choose the right pepper and
the appropriate flour for a dessert
recipe. The last hour of the class was
spent outdoors watching Rodgers
fire up the All-American Spare Ribs
and the Shrimp Kebabs with
chipolte-Pineapple Glaze on the bar
becue.
Draeger's offers classes at both its
Menlo Park and San Mateo loca
tions. Upcoming classes at Menlo
Park include: "Vegetable Heaven"
with Mollie Katzen, "Quick & Easy
Vegetable Sushi — hands-on" with
Seiichi Miyayame and "Thanksgiv
ing Desserts" with Rick Rodgers.
Draeger's also offers joint classes for
parents and children and classes for
children ages 7 to 12.
