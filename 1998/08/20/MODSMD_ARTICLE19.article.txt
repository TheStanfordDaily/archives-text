# Reviving Ophelia: a conversation with Mary Pipher
## 
### Kerry Shaw Editorial Staff 
Why are today's teenage girls more prone to
eating disorders, depression, drug abuse and
suicide attempts than ever before?
According to Mary Fipher, Ph.D., it's be
caase we live in a "girl-poisoning" culture that
encourages girls to become obsessed with their
looks and sexuality. Pipher, a commentator for
Nebraska Public Radio and a clinical psycholo
gist, examines the cultural challenges to adoles
cent girls in her national bestseller "Reviving
Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent
Girls."
Dr. Pipher will speak this Saturday in
Memorial Hall at a workshop entitled "Ophelia
and her Family: Challenges Facing the Adoles
cent Girl in Contemporary Society." Earlier this

week she spoke to The Weekly about media in
fluences on adolescent girls.
WEEKLY: How did you become inspired to re
search and write "Reviving Ophelia?"
MARY PIPHER: I had been doing a lot of
therapy with teenage girls and I was struck by
the fact that many of the textbook theories
didn't always fit my patients, particularly the
"Dysfunctional family" theory. The theory is
that if there's a problem with a child, it can be
traced to dysfunction in his or her family. The
kids I saw were having troubles that didn't have
anything to do with their parents, lin fact, many
of them [would readily admit] that they loved
their parents. Also, my own daughter was an
adolescent at the time, and 1 had seen her and
her friends change in the direction of being
more self-conscious and less outgoing. I wanted
to look at our culture and see what was going on.
W: In "Reviving Ophelia" you mention pres
sures on adolescent girls, such as sexual pres
sure, eating disorders and drug abuse. What do
you think is the greatest cultural challenge to
girls today?
MP: I think that there are a lot of problems, and
1 am hesitant to name just one. I think that in our
culture we make money selling stuff to
teenagers like designer jeans and nicotine. We
send them a lot of messages about what will
make them happy and what they should dream
about. Some people who are influencing
teenagers are interested in them for business
reasons, and not necessarily in their well-being
or their health.
Another problem 1 see is that teenagers are
segregated too much from their grandparents.
Teenagers used to spend much more time with
their elders; families used to live together or
much closer together than they do now. Differ
ent ages can give each other the wisdom of their
particular stage. Think how a two-year old can
teach you to look at the world. But the problem
for teenagers is that they are rarely in contact

with people outside their age group. So how can
they learn?
W: Given the electronic age that we live in, how
can we isolate teenagers so that they are ex
posed to only the best media messages?
MP: I 'm not totally against the media. You are
the media, and I am the media at times. The bot
tom line is that decisions are made based on
what the media [shows to teenagers]. What are
the best stories that the media can present? In
terms of parents, families and teenagers them
selves, we all have to choose our media careful
ly. Ask yourself "What shows and what maga
zines promote my values." For example, there
are wonderful magazines for teenage girls such
as Blue Jeans and New Moon, which encourage
girls to do more than look pretty for boys.
W: Who do you think are the best role models
for teenage girls?
MP: That's a complicated issue. I don't like to
make judgments for myself and for others. The
question is who do you want to protect your
family from? Who do you want to connect your
family to? I know a family that is liberal and veg
etarian and they are going to posess a different
set of values than another family I know, in
which the parents are Christian and hunters. I
can only tell you who I really respect and ad
mire.
W: Who do you respect?
MP: I respect actresses and Filmmakers who are
trying to tell stories that are real. One movie I re
ally liked was"The Spitfire Grill," because it

was a real story. 1
also liked Kate
Winslet in "Titan
ic." 1 read that [di
rector] James
Cameron read
"Reviving Ophe
lia" before he
wrote the screen-

play and he tried to create a character who
would be a good role model for young girls. The
movie is almost literally a "Reviving Ophelia"
story. She's saved from drowning by Leonardo
DiCaprio to become her own true self. At the
end of the movie, she is a feisty, independent
young woman.
W: On the subject of Hollywood, what do you
think of recent pairings between 50-year old ac
tors and female co-stars who are young enough
to be their daughters?
MP: I think they are ridiculous. They under
score the message that women are only valuable
when they're young and beautiful. There have
been several gixKJ movies, like "As Good as it
Gets" [starring Jack Nicholson and Helen
Hunt] and"The Horse Whisperer" [starring
Robert Redford and Kxisten Scott-Thomas)
where I thought the men should have been dat
ing the actresses' mothers!
W: Just out of curiosity, what do you think of the
singers the Spice Girls?
MP: I ve never heard of them. But I think as far
as music goes, everyone respects and admires
Tracy Chapman and Sarah McLaughlin.
Pipher's workshop this Saturday at Stanford
will examine the themes in all three of her
books, "Hunger Pains," "Reviving Ophelia"
and"The Shelter of Each Other." The course
fee is $105 for seven hours continuation credit.
