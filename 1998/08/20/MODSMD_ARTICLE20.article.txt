tT Tow Stella
±±Got Her
Groove Back,"
based on Terry

McMillan's novel by the same
name, takes a serious look at the less
common and almost taboo older
woman / younger man relationship.
Stella (Angela Bassett) is the
classic overworked, under ro
manced career woman and mother.
She's lonely and her life is stuck in
a rut.
A television advertisement for a
Jamaican vacation prompts her to
drop everything and take a friend
(Whoopi Goldberg) to Jamaica.
There, Stella is pursued by a young
man (Taye Diggs) whom she often
reminds, "I'm old enough to be
your mother!" Soon, barriers are
broken, and Stella becomes intima
tively involved with this "boy."
That's where most movies might

end. However, this one delves into
the problems resulting from an in
tergenerational romance, and
there are many.
McMillan, who also wrote the
screenplay, assures that the movie
gets to the heart of the matter — en
joying life — without ignoring the
other complications that life can
bring.
The film's humor is often gratu
itously below the belt. Perhaps the
producers thought that husbands
and boyfriends dragged to the
movie would need this to endure
the movie. Whatever the reasoning
behind the jokes, they don't hurt
too much (unless you happen to be
sitting with a Flicks-mentality audi
ence and miss much of the actual
movie content). The imagery is also
evocative — Jamaica and the stun
ning cast photograph beautifully.
I don't want to spoil the ending,

except to say that the last line men
tions something that will hit close
to home for many. Flicks crowds
will have a field day. Just make sure
you see the film in a quieter theater
first so you can actually enjoy the
movie itself.
