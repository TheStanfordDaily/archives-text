## Editor's farewell One last dance 
### 
£ "W"UST GRASP MY hand
I firmly and feel the move
ment of my wrist," my dance
partner said as we moved in circles
practicing our Lindy swingout. "I
promise that if you do that, you'll
know exactly what to do."
Soon we were swivelingand turn
ing, keeping pace with the lively big
band music. I relaxed as he led me
through our class repertoire — the
swingout, the Lindy circle and some
basic Charleston steps. I was finally
comfortable on the dance floor.
As I think back to that moment
last week when our Lindy hop first
began to click, I realized it did so be
cause we were following the advice
of our instructors — that in dance
you can't have two leaders. And
during the past few weeks. Thai has
shown me that following can be as
exhilarating as leading.
The lesson could not have come
at a more appropriate time.
With this farewell, 1 trade in my
red editor's pen for a new reporter's
notebook and an honors thesis.
I have mixed emotions about the
transition. I've "lived" a year at the
Daily — as an opinions editor in the
fall, managing editor in the spring
and the summer editor in chief of the
Weekly.
I have become very attached to
the paper's day to day operations.
I've grown accustomed to reading
much of the paper the evening be
fore publication and I'm as familiar
with the Associated Press Stylebook
as I am with many of my textbooks.
I will miss the teamwork aspects of
editing — working closely with writ
ers on improving stories and with
other editors on developing visions
for their sections. I will miss fiddling
with Quark, trying to get the right
headline size or to squeeze in the last
block of text.
Above all, I will miss sharing
each evening with a diverse and tal
ented team of writers, editors, pho
tographers and graphic artists at
Stanford's very own "Cheers." I

owe much of what I know about
newspapers to my colleagues who
have showed me how to develop a
story angle, how to tweak a layout
and how to read a paper with a dis
cerning eye.
More importantly, they've
taught me valuable life lessons. I've
learned that crises provide the best
learning opportunities, that we can
make mistakes and still move on,
and that listening is often more im
portant than responding. I've be
come more skillful working with dif
ferent personalities and better able
to predict how others will respond to
my actions. And through working
with photo, graphics, sports and en
tertainment, I have come to appreci
ate the abundance of art in everyday
life.
But in the coming weeks, I plan
to keep in mind what I've learned in
Lindy hop — that there is a time to
lead and a time to take a step back
and follow.
I return to reporting with a
greater understanding of what con
stitutes a good news story, with a
greater awareness of campus orga
nizations and the University chain
of command, and with knowledge of
the cooperation necessary to pro
duce the paper. Additionally, edit
ing has enabled me to think more
critically about issues of importance
on campus.
But as I follow the leads given by
the editors next fall, I'll keep in mind
the skills I've learned when I was in
their shoes. I'll be a better follower
because I'll have a sense of where
they are going. If only that were as
true for my dancing. If I had half
Thai's sense of where my feet should
be, I wouldn't step on his toes quite
so often.
