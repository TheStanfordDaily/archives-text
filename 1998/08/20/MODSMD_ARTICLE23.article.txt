# Jim Tankersley: Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
## Making peace with Boise 
### 
CEDAR RAPIDS, lOWA, is
no place for a California boy
in (he summer. You're 1,500
miles from family, friends and the
beach (and whatever else you picture
as "home" in your mind), and by Au
gust, you've got to be sick of corn.
Your job gets you out of lowa,
sometimes. It puts you on a bus and
sends you to Rockford, 111., or Lans
ing, Mich., or Fort Wayne, Ind. You
go to little stadiums in little towns
strung through the Midwest like a
$2.39 strand of Wal-Mart Christmas
lights. The rides are cramped, your
salary is small and you miss home.
Sometimes, you even miss Boise.
Northern California is a hell of a
place for an Oregon boy in the sum
mer. You get sunburned, camp in the
Siskiyou and Santa Cruz Mountains,
bask in the bleachers at the ballpark
real fans still call Candlestick and see
countless movies at the multiplex
south on 101. It hasn't rained since
you last saw Portland in June. It isn't
a Beach Boys' song or "American
Graffiti," but it's a lot of fun.
You live on campus and have four
jobs, all of which you enjoy. You like
editing columns, researching civil
rights in Green Library and assisting
your favorite journalism professor in
teaching a news writing class. You
work for a magazine, and you love it.
The staff treats you well and has
taught you so much about writing that
you often wonder if you knew any
thing at all, before this summer. Most
of the time, you don't even think
about Boise.
The ballplayer and the writer met

in Idaho's capital last summer. I
wrote a column in last summer's
Weekly about Jeb Dougherty, the
first player on the team to take an in
terest in me as a person and not just as
the guy who put his name in the paper
and occasionally spelled it right. A
nice guy with short legs and long side
burns, Jeb gave me the idea for my fa
vorite story of the summer. It was a
feature on players adjusting to the
wooden bats that many of them were
swinging for the first time.
Soon after I wrote the column —
and right about the time I decided Jeb
was one of the three people in Idaho
who liked me — the Anaheim Angels
promoted him. A year later, I
checked online and found him bat
ting lead-off for the Class A Cedar
Rapids Kernels.
After some calls to the Kernels'
public relations staff, I got Jeb on the
phone. He sort of remembered me
after I explained who I was. "Oh
yeah," he said, "the wood bats guy.
How are you doing?" I smiled and
said fine, thanks, and asked if we
could talk about his life for a while.
He told me about his off-season at
home in San Diego, when he worked
part time as a purchaser for an aero
space company and trained in the af
ternoons. He told me about his sea
son, how he started strong at the
plate, endured several bad slumps
and was now back to leading the team
in hitting. We talked about speed —
if he has a ticket to the majors, he
thinks that's it — and how his Kernels
coach has him stealing a truckload of
bases this year. He even said he's fall

en in love with wood: "It's like a sin
for me to pick up an aluminum hat
now."
Eventually, we got around to talk
ing ahout last summer. "Oh man,
Jim," he said, "Boise is the best." For
a baseball player, it's tough to argue
with him. The fans and management
in Boise treat their players like coun
try-western stars.
My memories of the city are not as
kind. I'm still trying to make peace
with Boise, a year after the loneliest
summer of my life. The last three
months at Stanford, working in sup
portive environments, surrounded by
friends and the young woman I love,
have soothed a lot of the pain. Yet, I
have a long way to go before the scars
fade and I fully accept my time in
Idaho as the "character builder" my
father likes to talk about.
When I get stuck and need inspira
tion, I only have to look at Jcb
Dougherty, a man who admits he has
little chance at the big leagues but
who is spending three years playing
baseball, just because he loves it.
"I have a great time out there," he
told me. "It's a lot harder when you're
not doing your best. This is a game
and you're basically running around
like a kid. Sometimes you lose track
of that."
It has been a great summer for
both the ballplayer and the writer.
And at least for now, two sets of
Major League dreams are intact.

Jim Tankersley, a junior majoring in
political science, will write a Daily col
lunn from Paris in the fall.
