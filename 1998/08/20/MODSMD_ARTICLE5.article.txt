### Ritu Bhatnagar Alex Tung Editorial staff 
From living on a
road named after
her grandfather to
working at a uni
versity where her
uncle is a professor

of political science, Jan Barker
Alexander is used to working among
family.
Barker Alexander, who will leave
her post as associate director of un
dergraduate admissions on Sept. 1,
comes to the position of Asst. Dean of
Students / Director of the Black
Community Services Center with the
experience of a community work en
vironment.
"She brought with her to our of
fice a wonderful spirit of the South,"
said Joan Lippman, senior associate
director of admissions, who described
days when Barker Alexander would
bring doughnuts into the office for
her co-workers. "She's the kind of co
worker who would always add that
spark of warmth and caring."
Other colleagues commented on
Barker Alexander's qualities, which

they feel will help her greatly in her
new position.
"In the relatively short time that
Jan Barker Alexander has been a
member of the Stanford community,
she's had a dramatic impact," said
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
James Montoya, who hired Barker
Alexander when he was dean of ad
missions.
"Because of her recruitment and
admissions experience, she brings an
understanding of the Stanford stu
dent profile" to this position, said
Morris Graves, current assistant dean
of students / director of the Black
Community Services Center.
Barker Alexander has extensive
experiences dealing with racial ten
sion and division. Although she loves
her hometown with fond regard, she
described Franklinton as "a very di
vided little town with roughly seven
stoplights. I graduated (from high
school)in 1984, and they had separate
proms for blacks and whites," she
said. "Even today they have a black
homecoming queen and a white
homecoming queen."
Since arriving at Stanford from the
admissions department at Louisiana
State University three years ago, she

has been very active with the Black
Community Services Center, partici
pating in race dialogues and Black
Graduation Celebration.
Barker Alexander said she is look
ing forward to strengthening ties be
tween the admissions department
and the center, as well as connecting
students with alumni and other re
sources.
"We want to expose students to all
that is out there, by exposing students

to (Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities) and getting more alumni in
volved," she said.
Barker Alexander had been ini
tially offered the position of assistant
director. After former director
Graves accepted the position of As
sociate Dean of Students last month,
he and a panel of faculty, staff and
alumni recommended Barker
Alexander for the directorship. It was
finally approved by Dean of Students

Marc Wais.
"It's a big loss for our office," said
Dean of Admissions Robert Kinnally.
James Jordan, administrative as
sistant in Residential Education, will
take over as assistant director of the
center.
The admissions office is current
ly conducting a nationwide search
for a new associate director and
should select one next week, Kin
nally said.
