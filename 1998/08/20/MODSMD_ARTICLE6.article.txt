Surfing the World Wide Web and sending e-mails
from a dorm room have just become more costly for
Stanford students. This fall, Residential Computing
plans to raise the cost of an in-room connection to $80,
nearly twice as much as the former $45 fee.
According to Residential Computing officials, the
primary reason for the increase is budgetary.
"Our funding is limited," said Ethan Rikleen, assis
tant director of network support for Res Comp. "Much
of it goes to providing cluster computers, and our costs
are increasing."
Res Comp is responsible for managing Stanford's res
idential computer networks and clusters. It also pays for
residential computer coordinators.
In previous years, revenue from the fee accounted for
approximately 10 percent of the total operating budget
and was used primarily to supplement the costs of resi
dent computer coordinator compensation. With the fee
increase, the additional revenue generated will be used
to upgrade active network equipment such as hubs,
routers and gateways.
"For the first time, we can fully [fund] actual active
network equipment purchase, replacement, mainte
nance and staffing support," said Res Comp Director
Jeff Merriman. "These are costs that have not been fund
ed in the past."
The additional revenue will not be used to pay for ad
ministrative costs, upgrading residential computer clus
ters or rewiring residences with faster Internet connec

tions. Other funding is being sought for those purposes.
"Keep in mind that Internet service providers charge
$20 per month for 1 /20th the speed of our network,"
Merriman said. "To subscribe at home to comparable
network speeds would cost around $400 per month."
Another change is that the fee will now be assessed as
an annual fee rather than as an activation fee. Therefore,
students will not have to repay if they move during the
same school year.
It still has not been decided whether the fee will be
prorated or if it will be charged as a one-time fee when
students register or quarterly.
This summer, Res Comp has also upgraded resi
dential computer clusters across campus with Power-
Mac G3/266s to replace the older PowerMac 7100 ma
chines. They are also providing updated versions of
software on all cluster computers, including some new
titles such as Adobe Illustrator, Mathematica and Vir
tual PC.
The Internet connections at several residences, in
cluding Lagunita Court and Stern Hall, will be upgrad
ed to the faster 100Base-TX cable. Res Comp is also
planning to replace older 13- and 14-inch monitors with
new 17-inch Apple monitors and to possibly provide a
PC in each large dorm cluster by the middle of the
school year.
