# Dunn-Bacon sale final
## 
### James Buxbaum Contributing writer 
For many Stanford students the
Dunn-Bacon mansion at 565 May
field and its former resident, Rosa
mond Bacon, who served lemonade
to students jogging up the Row, were
as much a part of Stanford lore as the
Axe and Full Moon on the Quad. On
July 31 this era of Stanford history
officially ended when the Dunn fam
ily sold the house to the University.
Echoing the sentiments of the
students. University Archivist Mag
gie Kimball fondly remembers
working with Bacon when she inhab
ited the building. She noted that
"Ros" opened her house regularly to
various groups and "to students who
just wanted to say hello."
Kimball, who has played an active
role in documenting the furnishings
and history of the house, remarked
that the Dunn-Bacon family resi
dence is "an important piece of Stan

ford history."
She explained that the house is
legendary because it is one of the
oldest houses on campus, has been
inhabited by the same family
throughout its history and was de
signed by architect Charles Hodges.
Hodges, who also helped design
the Main Quadrangle and the Stan
ford Art Museum, drew the plans for
the residence in the late 1890s. His
blueprint included a secret passage
way, a pump organ and a horse hitch.
Since its completion in 1899, the
house has been owned by the Dunn
family. In the 19305, one of the
Dunn's cousins, mathematics Pro
fessor Harold Bacon, moved into the
house, and since then, it has been
known as the Dunn-Bacon house.
The last family member, Rosa
mond, moved last year. Her repre
sentatives, including her son
Charles, sold the house to Stanford.
When asked why Stanford pur
chased the house. Director of Facul

ty/Stafi Housing Carolyn Sargent
said, "Stanford over time looks to ac
quire anything inside of the belt of
Campus Drive because of its prox
imity to University buildings."
Nevertheless, the sale of the resi
dence has led many to speculate who
the new occupants of the Dunn-
Bacon House will be and what phys
ical alterations might be made to this
historic structure. Sargent comment
ed, "to my knowledge no transaction
[of the house to any group or organi
zation] has occurred."
However, it is widely believed but
not substantiated that Hillel, a Jew
ish student organization, will be the
next occupant of the Dunn-Bacon
House. In reference to the house's
future, Margaret Ann Fidler, direc
tor of administration for the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs said, "I
do not know the status, but to my
knowledge, it is under the purview of
the religious life area." Hillel repre
sentatives refused to comment on

this matter.
There is also concern about phys
ical changes that might be made to
the house in order to accommodate
new occupants. According to Kim
ball, "prior to the process of Univer
sity acquisition and the emptying of

the house, the Dunn-Bacon house
was a period piece containing much of
the furniture that had been there since
the very early period of the house's
history." Recently, the Bacon family
removed these furnishings and sold
many of them at an estate sale.
