MORE ABOUT TEACHING!
In California, a Single Subject Teaching Credential authorizes you to teach a
specific subject in a departmentalized class. To earn one, you are legally
required to verify your subject matter competence. The way for Stanford
students to do this is to pass the Commission-adopted examinations, which
are the appropriate Single Subject Assessments for Teaching (SSAT) test(s),
and the PRAXIS test(s) for the subject area you wish to teach.
The 1998-99 test registration bulletins are available at the Stanford Teacher
Education Program in CERAS 310 and at the Undergraduate Advising
Center. See below for general registration deadlines.
