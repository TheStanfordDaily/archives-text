While University housing policy prohibits keeping pets in or about
Campus residences, some students still adopt them
Each year, some of those pets will be lost or abandoned on Campus
They reproduce and, with their offspring, may die of starvation/disease
Critters left behind in student housing
may die of dehydration/starvation, before they are found
Pet adoption is a lifetime commitment to care:
health care-sterilization/vaccination,
proper nutrition, shelter, protection, lots of attention
Are you prepared at this time in your life to make that commitment?
What about your studies, the expense, housing?
What you are going to do at quarter breaks and school year end?
If you miss your family and pets and want to help animals, help us
If you have a pet you cannot keep, we 'll help you
