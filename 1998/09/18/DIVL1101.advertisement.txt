A Message from Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford Chapter
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their undergraduate scholarly
accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is open to undergraduates of all majors. To be
elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve academic distinction in the major as well as in courses across a
broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about one
fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines (revised July, 1997) define "breadth" of study as excellence beyond the major field. To
lie considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring Quarter, at least three
courses in each of the following three major domains of knowledge: 1 lumanities, Science, Engineering and Math, and Social
Sciences. To be considered for election, transfer students must have taken at least two courses at Stanford in two of these major
domains.
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the BULLETIN for the
undergraduate C *>neral Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Courses taken for GER Area 1 will not be considered as
satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
A grade of"+" or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" condition is not considered a
sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students wishing to be
considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of students' names from their academic
records before consideration. Students who desire that their records not be made available for consideration by the Stanford
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old Union.
