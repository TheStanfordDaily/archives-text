DELOITTE CONSULTING:
Got a life
Work/life balance. The buzz of the moment. Everyone in corporate America is aware of the research showing
people's desire to get ahead in their company while getting more out of life away from the job.
Deloitte Consulting has long been committed to helping people achieve this important balance — well before
it was"the thing" to do. Here, you'll work hard. And, yes, travel is often involved. But we also have programs
in place that ensure your other responsibilities can be met.
We just happen to think that an employee who is relaxed, fulfilled, involved, content - ultimately does a better
job. So, is it any wonder that Deloitte & Touche was named in Fortune's list of "The 100 Best Companies To
Work For In America"? If you're intent upon building your career with a firm that understands your need to
balance your personal and professional goals, stop by. What we have to say could change your life.
