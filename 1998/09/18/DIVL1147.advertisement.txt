PHYSICS REVOLUTION?
Has a basic concept of physics,
applicable to macro and molecular
phenomena, been overlooked at the
subatomic level?
Vibrational Inertia is the inertia of a
vibrating system to a change in its fre
quency of vibration. It is directly propor
tional to the frequency.
The Vibrational Inertia of a system
consisting of a perfectly elastic ball
rebounding between two walls is equal to
the product of the ball's mass and its
frequency of rebound.
The Vibrational Inertia of a gas
enclosed in a container is equal to the
pressure of the gas on the walls of the
container.
The Mass of a subatomic particle is equal
to its Vibrational Inertia.
