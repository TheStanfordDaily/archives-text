'Disturbing Behavior'
Soundtrack
If you were intrigued by the movie trailer for Disturbing
Behavior" because it featured Harvey Danger's "Flagpole Sitta,"
you might be in for a shock. Listeners looking for this catchy sin
gle, or even anything like it, on the "Disturbing Behavior" sound
track will find themselves disappointed.The soundtrack is an
chored by "Got You (Where I Want You)," a ballad by The Flys.
This romantic tune, featuring sweet dual vocals of Adam and
loshua Paskowitz backed by dreamy, simple instrumentals has
been in heavy rotation on alternative radio stations everywhere.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, F.O.S.'s "Blown" is a de
lightful adrenaline-pumping, speed metal rant. Perched between
soft ballads and blitzkrieg rock is Once Upon a Time's "Hello."
This Suzanne Vega-esque track fuses Elisa Bel's slinky, sensuous
voice with soft, distant guitars in the background. The result is a
sedate, trance-inducing song.
While there are a few gems interspersed throughout the album,
as a whole, this CD is a palatable but tepid soundtrack. Most of
the songs are neither innovative nor memorable. In addition, the
lack of a major band or two really hurts the appeal of the album.
All of these shortcomings add up to an album that you can expect
to find sitting in the used CD bin.
