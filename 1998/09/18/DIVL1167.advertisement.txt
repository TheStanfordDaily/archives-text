LET MING'S DIM SUM CARTS
ROLL THE GOOD TIMES TO YOU!
Everyday during lunch time, more than 40 kinds of dim sum, the
savory bite-size morsels, are rolled around Ming's dining rooms on carts
for you to pick and choose from. So, you can skip those trips to crowded
buffet tables, and instead, let the buffet tables come to you.
A large number of dim sum are steamed. Ming's also offers many
vegetarian choices, such as vegetarian egg roll, posticker, steamed buns
and rice crepe. So, if you are health conscious and watch what you eat,
Ming's dim sum is definitely worth checking out.
Ming's has the best Oim Sum in the Bay Area. " — Russ Rk.-ra (KGO)
"Ming's is the top Chinese restaurant in the South Bay. " — San Francisco Focus
Regular menu also served during lunch.
Selected dim sum items are available during dinner.
MING'S NEW VEGETARIAN MENU
Many vegetarian menus will provide the protein usually found in
meat and poultry by offering tofu. However, tofu is high in water content
and may not fill the appetite. To add substance to a meal, vegetarian
menus ofen are overridden with pasta and rice entrees that are high in
calories.
Soy gluten, a popular Chinese vegetarian ingredient, provides
protein without the calories. Soy gluten is solid and contains the fiber and
protein of soybean but is starch-free and cholesterol-free. At Ming's, we
prepare soy gluten dishes the same way we prepare some of our most
popular meat and poultry dishes. For instance, in the vegetarian versions
of our famous Chicken Salad and Cashew Chicken, we substitute
shredded, cubed, and diced soy gluten for the meat items. These
delicious and healthy dishes satiate your appetite...and leave you hungry
no more.
More of Ming's that is. Stop by to see our new vegetarian
menu...or try our traditional meat and poultry favorites.
