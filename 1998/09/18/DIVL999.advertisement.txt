Introducing the ViaTV" Videophone.
See us at the Stanford
Bookstore, Sat-Wed # Sept. 19-23
With the new ViaTV Videophone,
you can keep in touch with what's
happening with your family and
friends. While a regular telephone
lets you talk to each other, you don't
get to "see" what's really going on.
The ViaTV Videophone lets you see
what (or who) you're missing —all
using a regular telephone line. And
because the ViaTV Videophone
doesn't need a computer, it's very i
easy to keep your long-distance
relationships from crashing.To find
out what you're missing, come see
us at the Stanford Bookstore or call
BxB toll-free at 1-888-VIEW-BxB.
