## University to build 480 new units 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
In response to the overwhelming
demand for more on-campus gradu
ate student housing, the University
intends to build 480 new apartments
in Escondido Village by the year
2000.
The new graduate housing is part
of a three-pronged plan to build near
ly 1,000 new apartments on campus
for faculty, students and Stanford
Hospital resident physicians. In addi
tion to the 480 graduate units, up to
250 family-sized units will be built at
the corner of Campus Drive East and
Electioneer Road. These will be sold
to faculty and staff.
Another 200 rental apartments
for resident doctors at the medical
center will be built at a seven-acre site
at the corner of Quarry and Arbore
tum Roads.
Of the three plans, the graduate
housing is getting "emergency priori
ty." The other two projects could
take several years to develop.
In addition to the planned new
housing units, the University has also
secured 150 off-campus leases at Oak
Creek Apartments in Palo Alto and
Sharon Green Apartments in Menlo

Park to sublet to graduate students at
below cost.
Skyrocketing housing costs fueled
by Silicon Valley's economic boom
have made it increasingly difficult for
graduate students to find affordable
rentals in Palo Alto and neighboring
communities.

As a result, the
University is feel
ing a severe hous
ing crunch as
more and more
graduate students
are applying for
on-campus hous
ing. This past
vear, a total of 736

graduate students were denied hous
ing in the Draw, compared to 242 just
two years ago.
The housing shortage has become
a recruitment issue, as many prospec
tive graduate students and faculty are
going elsewhere because of the
Peninsula's housing crunch. These
problems culminated in an extensive
report on graduate housing by the
ASSU Task Force on Graduate
Housing this spring and a May mid
night housing rally in the Main Quad.
