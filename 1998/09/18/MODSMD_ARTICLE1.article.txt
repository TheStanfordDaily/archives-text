## University to build 480 new units 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
In response to the overwhelming
demand for more on-campus gradu
ate student housing, the University
intends to build 480 new apartments
in Escondido Village by the year
2000.
The new graduate housing is part
of a three-pronged plan to build near
ly 1,000 new apartments on campus
for faculty, students and Stanford
Hospital resident physicians. In addi
tion to the 480 graduate units, up to
250 family-sized units will be built at
the corner of Campus Drive East and
Electioneer Road. These will be sold
to faculty and staff.
Another 200 rental apartments
for resident doctors at the medical
center will be built at a seven-acre site
at the corner of Quarry and Arbore
tum Roads.
Of the three plans, the graduate
housing is getting "emergency priori
ty." The other two projects could
take several years to develop.
In addition to the planned new
housing units, the University has also
secured 150 off-campus leases at Oak
Creek Apartments in Palo Alto and
Sharon Green Apartments in Menlo

Park to sublet to graduate students at
below cost.
Skyrocketing housing costs fueled
by Silicon Valley's economic boom
have made it increasingly difficult for
graduate students to find affordable
rentals in Palo Alto and neighboring
communities.

As a result, the
University is feel
ing a severe hous
ing crunch as
more and more
graduate students
are applying for
on-campus hous
ing. This past
vear, a total of 736

graduate students were denied hous
ing in the Draw, compared to 242 just
two years ago.
The housing shortage has become
a recruitment issue, as many prospec
tive graduate students and faculty are
going elsewhere because of the
Peninsula's housing crunch. These
problems culminated in an extensive
report on graduate housing by the
ASSU Task Force on Graduate
Housing this spring and a May mid
night housing rally in the Main Quad.

•; "We believe the housing shortage
is; a long-term problem, and we de
cided that if we are going to do some
thing for our students and faculty, we
should do it now," said Larry Norton,
director of government relations.
The 480 new graduate apartments
will be studio apartments for single
graduate students. Some of the four
story apartment complexes will re
place some existing one- and two
story units. Others will be built on va
cant land in Escondido Village, said
Horton.
* "We're very pleased about the
new projects," said Stephanie Toer
ing, a doctoral student and co-author
of the graduate student housing re
[>ort. "We feel these plans are a direct
result of our survey."
* The new housing projects are
being criticized by various environ
mental groups and the city of Palo
Alto for possible violations of the

general land use permit. The current
general use permit is an agreement
among Stanford, the county and the
city of Palo Alto that defines and lim
its the extent of development at Stan
ford. The current permit dates back
to 1988 and does not address the new
development plans.
Gary Fazzino, a Palo Alto city
councilman, said the current permit,
which covers through the year 2(KX).
does not provide for the new projects.
However, because the proposed
units are on unincorporated campus
land, approval rests with Santa Clara
County officials, not the Palo Alto
City Council.
Two environmental groups, the
Committee for Green Foothills and
Action for Tomorrow, have also
voiced concerns about the Universi
ty's development plans. They are
asking for a county hearing on
whether the developments comply
with the general use permit.
According to Horton. Stanford is
in full compliance with the terms of
the general use permit. The Universi

ty is submitting an application for
building the 480 units in Escondido
Village this month.
The subsidized apartment rentals
in Oak Creek and Sharon Green
apartments are another way in which
the I Jniversity is addressing the hous
ing shortage.
These units will be rented to grad
uate student at rates ranging from
$4(K) to $600 a month per person. This
rate is significantly lower than the
standard $ I XX) to $1,200 per month
rate for comparable off-campus
housing cited in the graduate student
housing report.
Stanford has a two-year deal with
the apartment complexes. Students
must apply to live in these units.
Those assigned will have a one-year
lease and an option to renew for the
second year.
The funds for obtaining these
apartments were authorized by the
Provost's Office and are coming from
a set of discretionary funds allocated
for new programs, according to Asso
ciate Provost Ann Fletcher.
