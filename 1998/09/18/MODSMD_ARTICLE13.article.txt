# Fewer teens having sex
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) â€” For the first time this
decade, more than half of America's high
school students are saying no to sex.
And high schoolers who are sexually active
are using condoms at the highest rate on
record in the 19905, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said yesterday.
Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, director of the CDC's
Division of Adolescent and School Health,
said that the findings give further evidence
that teaching teenagers about safe sex hasn't
resulted in more promiscuity.
"It's an important milestone because stu
dents who have not engaged in intercourse
can say that they're in the majority," he said.
The 1997 survey of 16,262 students nation
wide showed that a lower proportion of high
schoolers are engaging in risky sexual behav
ior than in 1991, when the CDC began giving

teen-agers anonymous questionnaires every
two years about their sex lives.
Asked if they had ever had sexual inter
course, 52 percent of those surveyed in 1997
said no, compared with 46 percent in 1991.
Asked if they used a condom the last time
they had sex, 57 percent of students said yes,
compared with 46 percent in 1991.
The trend toward abstinence in the 1990s
is in sharp contrast to the 1970s and '80s,
Kolbe said. Sexual activity among girls 15 to
19, for example, jumped from 29 percent in
1970 to 57 percent in 1988, according to pre
vious studies.
Kolbe attributed the recent declines to vig
ilant efforts by parents, schools and health
officials to educate young people about safe
sex and about the risks of teen pregnancy and
sexually transmitted diseases.
