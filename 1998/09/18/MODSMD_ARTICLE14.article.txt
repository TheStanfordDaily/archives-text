# House debates tapes

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The House Judiciary
Committee unexpectedly delayed a decision yesterday
on the release of President Clinton's videotaped grand
jury testimony. Republicans demanded an FBI inquiry
into an alleged "systematic attempt to intimidate" the
panel's chairman and others.
There was no immediate explanation for the delay,
which was announced by a committee spokesman at
the end of several hours of closed-door discussions.
"No final decisions have been made as far as what
materials to release," said the spokesman, Paul McNul
ty. He added it is unlikely any material would be
released until sometime after Friday.
Democrats on the panel had favored a delay in the
release of the tape, which many Republicans had hoped
to make available to the public on Friday. But after a
closed-door session that stretched into the dinner hour,
McNulty announced the committee was finished for the
day and would reconvene Friday.
"It was a productive debate," the panel's chairman,
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., told reporters. "It's not a
frivolous debate. We are accomplishing a lot." He
added that the discussion became "passionate at

times.
It was not clear to what extent the tape was dis
cussed in the daylong session. Officials said lawmakers
had spent hours discussing how to edit sexually explicit
material in the records that Independent Counsel Ken
neth Starr submitted to Congress, in part to avoid
embarrassing any innocent people.
Senior Republican aides had confidently been mak
ing preparations for release of the tape as early as Fri
day.
And even before the committee began meeting,
television outlets were making plans for airing a four
hour tape said to contain images of a president who was
defiant, angry and evasive by turns as he fielded explic
it questions from Starr's prosecutors last month.
The committee met as the political fallout continued
in the House over publication of an article detailing an
extramarital affair by Hyde, the committee chairman,
more than 30 years ago.
White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles has dis
patched a letter to Hyde in which he pledged to fire
anyone involved in prying into the personal lives of law
makers.
