Judge outlaws slot machines
SACRAMENTO (AP) — In a victo
ry for Gov. Pete Wilson, a federal judge
ruled that slot machines in use on about
40 Indian casinos are illegal under state
law, raising questions about the legality
of Proposition 5.
U.S. District Judge Garland E. Bur
rell ruled that the California Lottery
Act did not allow the casinos to offer
the type of slot machines in wide use
that earn millions for the tribes.
The tribes have argued that the 1984
constitutional amendment did not specif
ically outlaw the devices and the
machines were, in effect, the equivalent
of the state's own lottery games.
Gov. Pete Wilson, who has long con

tended the machines are illegal, told the
Los Angeles Times that the ruling
"strikes a hearty blow against those
tribes engaged in a cynical breach of the
law."
Lawyers said the ruling released
Wednesday raises questions about the
legality of Proposition 5, a Nov. 3 ballot
initiative that would allow for the expan
sion on reservations of the machines
that Wilson contends are illegal.
Senate allows ATM fees
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Sen
ate rejected legislation Thursday that
would have banned double-charging for
A TM transactions, frustrating a major
election-year campaign by Sen. Alfonse

D'Amato.
The move came as the Senate started
to slog through legislation to overhaul
personal bankruptcy laws after weeks of
stalled efforts and closed-door negotia
tions.
Seeking to protect responsible con
sumers while making it harder for peo
ple to erase their debts in bankruptcy,
the Senate adopted a proposal to bar
credit card companies from terminating
accounts of cardholders who pay on
time.
Sen. Jack Reed. D-R.1., said he wrote
the proposal because some companies'
policy is "if you're too good a risk, we
don't give you any credit,... and that is
illogical."
