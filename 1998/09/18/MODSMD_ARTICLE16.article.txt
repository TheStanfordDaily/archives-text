# SUMMER ROUNDUP

University acquires
Dunn-Bacon House
This summer, Stanford pur
chased the Dunn-Bacon house, lo
cated at 565 Mayfield.
The University has not dis
closed what its future plans are for
what was until last year a private
residence.
Margaret Ann Fidler, director
of administration for the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs said, "I
do not know the status, but to my
knowledge, it is under the purview
of the religious life area."
Hillel, a Jewish student organi
zation, is thought to be the planned
future tenant.
According to University
Archivist Maggie Kimball, the
house is legendary because it is one
of the oldest houses on campus,
has been inhabited by the same
family throughout its history and
was designed by architect Charles
Hodges, who also helped design
the Main Quad and the Stanford

Art Museum.
Since its completion in 1899, the
house has been owned by the
Dunn family. The last family mem
ber, Rosamond, moved out of the
house last year. Her representa
tives, including her son Charles,
sold the house to Stanford.
Flood damage assessed
Six months ago, the largest
storm in 30 years flooded central
campus leaving in its wake 74,919
waterlogged books and documents
and substantial damage to campus
buildings. Today, most of the
books are back on the shelves,
structural repairs made and the
nearest water rides are at Para
mount's Great America.
Fast action enabled the librari
ans to get the books and papers to
the cold-storage facilities within
the critical 36-hour period follow
ing initial water exposure.
Throughout the spring, about
8,000 books were being returned to

campus on a weekly basis, after
having undergone the freeze-dry
ing and cleaning processes neces
sary for restoration. More than 90
percent of the books were returned
directly to the shelves, thanks to
the effectiveness of the freeze-dry
ing technique.
Of the books sent to the freeze
drying operation, fewer than 5 per
cent have required rebinding, re
pair or replacement.
Although final totals are not yet
in, it is estimated to have cost be
tween $3 and $5 million less the $1
million deductible on Stanford's
insurance, explained Jeffrey Seil
bach, Stanford's director of Risk
Management.
Stanford to offer online
degree
The first-ever online degree
program at Stanford will begin this
quarter. Accepted students will be
able to earn a master's in electrical

engineering without ever setting
foot on campus.
"The program is really targeted
to working professionals â€” engi
neers, computer scientists and
technology managers. The focus of
the degree will be in telecommuni
cations because there's a great de
mand in the industry for people
skilled in this area," said Andy Di-
Faulo, director of the Stanford
Center for Professional Develop
ment.
Although this will not be the
first time Stanford has offered
courses on the Internet, the new
program represents the first time
that the University has offered an
advanced degree that candidates
can earn solely from participation
in online classes.
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
is helping defray starting costs with
a $450,(XX) grant.
The program is expected to pay
for itself within three years, as the
online courses will cost 140 percent
of regular tuition.

Band Shak to come
down
The Band Shak, located on
Galvez Street and serving as prac
tice headquarters and a meeting
place for the Stanford Band, is slat
ed to be demolished either this Oc
tober or November.
"I think it's a good step," said
Athletic Director Ted Leland. "The
Shak doesn't meet Santa Clara
County earthquake regulations. It
would have to come down by the
year 2000 anyway," he added.
The Shak, along with the adjoin
ing Galvez House, home to the
Help Center and Center for In
ternational Security and Arms, will
be torn down in order to clear space
for a new state-of-the-art Alumni
Center and home for the Office of
Development.
Encina Gym is slated to replace
the Shak as the band's practice
headquarters.
The site of the Shak was chosen
as the future location of the Alumni

Center because of its central loca
tion on campus and its ability to
support a large number of visitors.
The fact that utilities were already
in place would also keep installa
tion costs low, according to Univer
sity Architect David Neuman.
"They [the Alumni Association]
are appropriately concerned with
ease of access for returning alumni,
as well as the many day-today func
tions that they both sponsor; there
fore, a site near a major entry to the
campus like Galvez has been a very
important criteria," Neuman said.
Although rumors had been cir
culated before of the demolition,
the Band was only able to substanti
ate them in mid-July while on tour
in China. According to to Claire
Bacher, the Band's manager, they
were never independently in
formed by anyone within the Uni
versity.
"The Band, like the Galvez
House and the Medical Library,
was taken by surprise," Bacher
said.
