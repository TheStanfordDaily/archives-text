## Physics and chemistry: giving it the old college try A 						senior recalls the perils of freshman science 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
Welcome to Stanford, class of
2002.
So you're ready to take control
of your education? Revel in aca
demic bliss? Find a cure for can
cer? Build a bridge across the
Pacific? Are you going to be an
engineer? A pre-med?
Before you realize those
dreams, you must scale some
formidable obstacles.
This article is not intended to
scare, discourage, or encourage,
but to inform the incoming class
about two experiences many stu
dents must eventually undergo:
the physics series and the chem
istry series.
The series are sometimes
painful, sometimes grueling, and
never a whole lot of fun, but they
are rites of passage that all engi
neers, premedical students and
many, many others must suffer
through before they graduate from
Stanford.
Physics
The physics series is a whirl
wind tour through mechanics,
electricity and magnetism, with a
bit of relativity thrown in lor those
still standing at the end of the third
quarter.
You are given two options for
when to take the class: 9 a.m. or 10
a.m. Either way, it will be earlier
than you want it to be. The prob
lem sets are incessant after the first
week of classes, and the problems
are not exactly smooth sailing.
The series is blessed with not
one, but two, midterms during the
10-week quarter. So basically you

should start studying for the first
one as soon as you get back from
MuFuUnSun.
The exams usually consist of
live or six complicated problems
that you have to struggle through
in what is never enough time. But
not to worry; you will feel right at
home with everyone else pulling
their hair out all around you.
Did I mention each class counts
for three units? There is a lesson to
be learned here: Not every credit
requires the same amount of work.
Read every word of every one of
your CIV books — twice — and
you will still be left wondering why
CIV counts for five credits when
physics only counts for three.
But at least you will be conserv
ing momentum and drawing elec
tric fields in style. Last spring, the
first physics class met in the Teach
ing Center at the Science and
Engineering Quad for the first
time.
The center is by far the nicest
lecture hall where 1 have attended
a class at Stanford. Let me just say
that the floor where the teacher
stands rotates to reveal a totally
new classroom. Pretty cool.
Back in my day, there was a
building called the Physics Tank, a
cold and formidable building that
housed every class in the physics
series. The building was demol
ished during the summer of 1997
to make room for the Science and
Engineering Quad.
One word of wisdom for all you
future engineers: There is a place
in the bottom floor of the Varian
building affectionately called the
"Reference Frame." Physics
teaching assistants staff the Refer
ence Frame almost every hour of
the day.

If you are persistent enough,
the teaching assistants will help
you figure out your entire problem
set. Now, I know that after breez
ing through high school, you are
ready to tackle all your classes
without any help. But make an
exception for the Reference
Frame. You'll get the problem sets
done faster and you'll understand
them better. Not a bad deal.
Chemistry
The chemistry series is to the
premedical student as the physics
series is to the engineer. Of course,
premeds have to take physics too,
but that usually comes later.
Like physics students, all you
eager doctors-to-be have a chem
istry class to take every quarter of
freshman year. You will begin with
inorganic chemistry in Chem 31
and advance to organic chemistry
in Chem 33 and 35.
There are some startling statis
tics about how many freshmen
start out premed and how many
are still premed by the end of their
first year. By the end of the first
quarter or two, many former sur
geon-hopefuls are running kicking
and screaming toward English,
political science, linguistics — as
far away as possible from moles
and alcohols and acids and bases.
But never give up your hopes
and dreams for fear of failure. It is
a lesson that all must learn for
themselves, so dive right in and
give it a try.
The exams can be equally as
brutal as those in the physics
series, and the means can be unbe
lievably high. But you do get a
whole four units a quarter for each
chemistry class, so things are look

ing up.
Again, there are two midterms
per quarter, so if you start studying
for the first midterm after Full
Moon On the Quad, it's going to
be too late. Don't be surprised if
the lecture hall looks a little bit
less crowded after each test; stu
dents will drop like flies after each
midterm.
We refer to these classes as
"weed-out" classes. This means
that the harder the exams, the
fewer premedical students there
will be, and for the powers that be,
1 guess that is a good thing.
Here's a couple tokens of
advice.
In the chemistry series, you will
be sure to hear the phrase "off
track" during your first year. It
may sound like a negative term
that implies being off-the-mark or
misdirected.
Cast these false impressions
aside. Taking the chemistry series
off track signifies taking each class
a quarter after all the hardcore
premeds do. Take Cheni 31 in the
winter, Chem 33 in the spring and
so on. The material is the same,
but you'll find the means are much
nicer and the classes are much
smaller. Do not pass up this oppor
tunity. Of course, this may come
back to haunt you when you take
Chem 35 in the fall of your sopho
more year with all the students
who failed it the previous spring.
The second piece of advice may
not come in handy until the third
quarter of the series: flashcards. In
Chemistry 35, you will have to
memorize more reactions than
names of people you meet during
Orientation week. (That's a lot.)
Flashcards will be an incredible
help — cherish them.

The Bottom Line
So, give it the old college try.
Physics and chemistry lay the foun
dation for the classes you want to
take — they're par for the course.
But if its not working out for
you, don't hesitate to take a
breather, or even a permanent
vacation. There is no harm in tak
ing a quarter full of some subjects

that you are really curious about.
Especially if you weren't all that
psyched about the science stuff in
the first place.
There will always be time to
come back to it, and there is a
whole lot more out there. This is
coming from a guy who finally put
the Physics 40 series behind him in
the last quarter of his junior year.
It wasn't so bad after all.

ready to tackle all your classes
without any help. But make an
exception for the Reference
Frame. You'll get the problem sets
done faster and you'll understand
them better. Not a bad deal.
Chemistry
The chemistry series is to the
premedical student as the physics
series is to the engineer. Of course,
premeds have to take physics too,
but that usually comes later.
Like physics students, all you
eager doctors-to-be have a chem
istry class to take every quarter of
freshman year. You will begin with
inorganic chemistry in Chem 31
and advance to organic chemistry
in Chem 33 and 35.
There are some startling statis
tics about how many freshmen
start out premed and how many
are still premed by the end of their
first year. By the end of the first
quarter or two, many former sur
geon-hopefuls are running kicking
and screaming toward English,
political science, linguistics — as
far away as possible from moles
and alcohols and acids and bases.
But never give up your hopes
and dreams for fear of failure. It is
a lesson that all must learn for
themselves, so dive right in and
give it a try.
The exams can be equally as
brutal as those in the physics
series, and the means can be unbe
lievably high. But you do get a
whole four units a quarter for each
chemistry class, so things are look

ing up.
Again, there are two midterms
per quarter, so if you start studying
for the first midterm after Full
Moon On the Quad, it's going to
be too late. Don't be surprised if
the lecture hall looks a little bit
less crowded after each test; stu
dents will drop like flies after each
midterm.
We refer to these classes as
"weed-out" classes. This means
that the harder the exams, the
fewer premedical students there
will be, and for the powers that be,
1 guess that is a good thing.
Here's a couple tokens of
advice.
In the chemistry series, you will
be sure to hear the phrase "off
track" during your first year. It
may sound like a negative term
that implies being off-the-mark or
misdirected.
Cast these false impressions
aside. Taking the chemistry series
off track signifies taking each class
a quarter after all the hardcore
premeds do. Take Cheni 31 in the
winter, Chem 33 in the spring and
so on. The material is the same,
but you'll find the means are much
nicer and the classes are much
smaller. Do not pass up this oppor
tunity. Of course, this may come
back to haunt you when you take
Chem 35 in the fall of your sopho
more year with all the students
who failed it the previous spring.
The second piece of advice may
not come in handy until the third
quarter of the series: flashcards. In
Chemistry 35, you will have to
memorize more reactions than
names of people you meet during
Orientation week. (That's a lot.)
Flashcards will be an incredible
help — cherish them.

The Bottom Line
So, give it the old college try.
Physics and chemistry lay the foun
dation for the classes you want to
take — they're par for the course.
But if its not working out for
you, don't hesitate to take a
breather, or even a permanent
vacation. There is no harm in tak
ing a quarter full of some subjects

that you are really curious about.
Especially if you weren't all that
psyched about the science stuff in
the first place.
There will always be time to
come back to it, and there is a
whole lot more out there. This is
coming from a guy who finally put
the Physics 40 series behind him in
the last quarter of his junior year.
It wasn't so bad after all.
