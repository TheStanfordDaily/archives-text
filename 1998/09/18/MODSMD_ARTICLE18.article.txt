## Measuring light 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
Imagine a whole new way of measuring light
energy â€” a method so accurate that it can detect
the energy of a single photon.
This is precisely the method that a Stanford
team has created. The team, which includes
Physics Profs. Bias Cabrera and Roger Romani,
invented a powerful new sensor that directly
measures the location, arrival time and energy of
individual photons.
The sensor, called a Superconducting Transi
tion Edge Sensor (TESS), was unveiled early last
month and could revolutionize the field of opti
cal astronomy, according to the sensor's inven
tors.
However, they explain, the sensor's design is
simple, 'it's really just a thermometer," said Dr.
Romani, who is interested in neutron stars and
black holes. "It records the change in energy of a
single particle of light."
For Romani, who also studies cosmology, the
device could mean big things. Neutron stars,
black holes and events that occurred at the
beginning of the universe emit energy in low
amounts and in pulses. The TESS would be able
to record emissions from these faraway objects,
as well as document the faint pulses and flares
they create.
"[The TESS] could provide important infor
mation about some of the key questions in
astronomy," Romani said.
Cabrera's lab constructed most of the hard
ware, while Romani worked on applications in
astronomy.
However, scientists will have to wait to use
the sensor for astronomy research. Romani pre
dicts that the device won't be available for three
to 10 years.
In the future, Romani and his team hope to
create a powerful optical instrument with an
array of thousands of sensors.
'Even a few detectors could greatly enhance
current optical telescopes," Romani said.
