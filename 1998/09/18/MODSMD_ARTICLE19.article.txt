# Rat brains and polymer chains
## Students spend their summers working in the lab 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
For many Stanford seniors-to-be, the end of junior
year marks the beginning of some real hands-on learn
ing.
Summer before senior year is a time for research
across a spectrum of academic fields. While other stu
dents strive for the big bucks, work in summer camps or
just hang out playing Nintendo, a dedicated bunch of
students are slicing up rat brains, studying the way tod
dlers think and playing with polymers.
Lab experience is almost a prerequisite for accep
tance to medical school. A typical premedical student
spends the summer before his or her senior year work
ing on a lab project and studying frantically for the
MCA T. the required entrance exam for medical school.
Mariah Ruth is a premedical senior majoring in
English. She worked at a lab in the School of Medicine
this summer.
Ruth worked with slices of rat brains to study the
effects of oxygen depletion, or ischemia, in brain cells.
Ruth focused on what happens when neurons in the
hippocampal region of the brain don't receive enough
oxygen and nutrients. The hippocampus helps the brain
convert short-term recollections to long-term memo
ries.
The experiments are medically relevant because they
might help doctors develop better surgical procedures.
During surgery, the brain is put under stressful con
ditions, Ruth said. Ruth's lab was trying to simulate
these conditions in the rat brain tissue.
Ruth said her work was interesting. "It is gratifying
to actually do something hands-on," she added. She
also explained that it was good to use her knowledge
outside of classes. "I felt a great sense of satisfaction,"
Ruth said. "In classes, everything is very textbook."
However, real-world work is never predictable.
"With actual research, there are too many variables,"
she said. "You're never going to get perfect science."
Erik Theissen, a senior majoring in psychology, also
worked with brains. But Theissen's brains were human,
and his specimens were living, breathing and speaking.
Thiessen was working with 28-month old kids at the
Center for Infant Studies at Stanford. He studied how
children perceive stressed and unstressed words when
they are learning to talk.
Past studies had shown that children learn to pro
duce stressed speech prior to being able to understand
it. Thiessen said.
In his research, Theissen showed the children two
pictures — for instance, a baby and a donkey. The chil
dren listened to a recording of a voice naming the
objects in the pictures with varied vocal stresses.

"It was probably the most important academic expe
rience I have had," Thiessen said.
Of course, research doesn't have to be biological.
Martin Colaco, a senior majoring in chemical engineer
ing, worked for an energy company.
The work was useful for power plants that use steam
to generate energy. Unfortunately, this steam often cor
rodes the equipment in the plant.
"The study was to find out how varying concentra
tions, types of polymer and temperatures affect the cor
rosion," Colaco said.
Colaco's primary research instrument was called a
pulsating bubble surfactometer. He used the surfac
tometer to add a very dilute polymer solution to the
steam environment. Polymers are giant chemical chains
made up of small molecules.
However, the actual day-to-day work was not as
intellectually provocative as the job description implies.
"It was actually very underwhelming," Colaco said.
"It was a lot of data gathering."
Lab work may involve drudgery, but science stu
dents can't graduate without it. So how do they find
research opportunities?
There is no sure-fire way to land a summer lab job.

Students make phone calls, visit professors and rely on
a little bit of luck.
"I wanted to stay around campus, and my advisor
needed some help." Colaco said.
Dave DeConde, a senior majoring in biology, used a
more direct approach. DeConde studied permeable
barriers that allow substances to pass in and out of cell
nuclei.
"1 actually got interested in nuclear transport during
a class." DeConde said of his field of interest. "When
the professor recommended that I talk with Stanford's
resident nuclear transport specialist, I did."
Eventually, DeConde's contacts paid off. and he was
offered a research position for the summer.
Thiessen also followed up an interesting class by
applying for a position at the Center for Infant Studies.
Good luck may have helped him out, though. When he
called to ask about the position, one of his former
teaching assistants from that class answered the phone.
At the end of the summer, these students have
acquired a new repertoire of skills — and a vocabulary
to match. They toss around words like "hippocampus,"
"surfactometer" and "eukaryotic."
And they know what thev are talking about, too.
