# Course changes
## I-Hum, Econ, Bio core revamped 
### Fei Wu 
While the new school year
means moving into new residences
and adjusting to a new schedule for
students, it also marks several cur
riculum changes. Students can ex
pect changes in the Cultures, Ideas,
and Values program, the Biology
core and requirements for econom
ics major.
From CIV to I-Flum
As the Introduction to the Hu
manities program expands from
three to six tracks this year, CIV,
created in 1988 as the Area One re
quirement for incoming freshmen,
enters its last year of existence. The
new program began its phase-in last
year after its approval by the Facul
ty Senate in 1997.
Instead of ClV's three-quarter
sequence, the new program consists
of one fall quarter course and a win
ter-spring quarter course tandem..
Whereas the CIV program re

quired students to commit to the se
quence the summer before their
freshman year. Introduction to the
Humanities allows students to ex
plore their interests before choos
ing their courses for winter and
spring.
"Before, some students thought
they were making premature deci
sions without lots of info and with
out advising," said Cheryl Ross, As
sociate Director of Area One Pro
gram.
Under the new system, fresh
men will choose their two-quarter
winter-spring course in late fall.
Ross said, "It will be a follow-up to
the interest they've cultivated in the
fall."
This year, two-thirds of the in
coming freshmen will enroll in the
Introduction to the Humanities se
quence.
In addition to the structural dif
ferences, the new courses have
three to five assigned readings each
quarter in contrast to the 10 to 12
books assigned in CIV courses.
Ross said that the large number
of readings required did not allow
students to study the texts in depth.
"They felt it was like taking drinks
from the firehose. They would say
they were not doing all the read
ing."
The Introduction to the Hu
manities courses feature section
sizes of 15 or less, making them
somewhat smaller than CIV sec
tions. The sections will meet three
hours each week, more than many
CIV sections. "The sections will be
led by postdoctoral scholars that
we recruit nationally," Ross said.
A feature of the new program
will be the use of Web technology.
Many classes will use Web sites as
discussion forums for both students
and faculty and as educational re
sources for students.
For example, "Freedom and
Eros in Philosophy and Art," a new
fall-quarter course, plans to give
students the opportunity to look at
artwork on the Internet.
Structured Liberal Education,
an intensive three-quarter se
quence that fulfills the Area One,
Area 3A, and writing require
ments, will remain the same under
the new program.
Economics major toughened
The frenzy to declare the eco
nomics major officially ended Sept.
1. Starting this fall, students plan
ning to major in economics must
complete 75 units of coursework in
the discipline.
For much of the past decade,
only 60 units in the field were re
quired for graduation.
"We decided to improve the
quality of the major," said John
Pencavel, chair of Economics De
partment "We want to enhance the
students' job prospects and

prospects for professional and
graduate school."
Students declaring economics
after Sept. 1 are required to fulfill
35 units of basic economics cours
es, 20 units of field courses, or
upper-division courses in areas
such as international trade, public
finance and game theory, and 20
units of electives.
Economics 102, or Introduction
to Econometrics, has moved from
the department's recommended
list to its required one. Instead of
the two field courses normally re
quired, students will now complete
four.
To graduate with a minor in eco
nomics now requires 35 units, an
increase of 5 units in upper-division
courses.
"Some people regarded it as a
cushy and easy major," said Pen
cavel. Ronald McKinnon, the de
partment's Director of Undergrad
uate Studies during the 1997-98
academic year, echoed Pencavel's
sentiment, stating that in recent
years many students have double
majored in economics and another
field.
McKinnon hopes that the more
rigorous requirements will encour
age students to declare economics
as their sole major.
"People double major because
the major is not strong enough,"
said McKinnon.
Larry Goulder, the depart
ment's Director of the Undergrad
uate Studies, said that the re
vamped requirements will increase
the breadth of student skills.
"The department felt that the
major should give students a
stronger background in core eco
nomic analysis and should do more
to develop their quantitative
skills."
In the months prior to the policy
change, the number of economics
majors dramatically increased.
Currently, the economics depart
ment has 551 declared undergradu
ates, a more than 40 percent in
crease from the beginning of 1997-

98 school year.
"There are many people who
rushed to declare in the old
regime," said McKinnon. "I didn't
think it was a substantial raise."
Calling it a "speeding-up
process," McKinnon said that
whereas students normally declare
their majors in their junior year, a
large number of freshmen and
sophomores declared the econom
ics major last spring.
Biology core revamped
For sophomores who plan to
major in biological or premedical
fields, the curriculum will differ sig
nificantly from past years, chang
ing the traditional perspective on
biology at Stanford.
The Biology Core course, which
introduces biology majors to basic
biological principles, will be pre
sented in a new fashion. The Biolo- [
gy 50 series will replace the 30 se- •
ries. ;
Biology 33: "Evolution, Genet- •
ics and Ecology," traditionally •
taught in spring quarter as the last •
segment of the Core, will now be •
introduced in autumn quarter. The '•
class will be followed by Biology
52: "Biochemistry, Molecular and
Cellular Biology" in winter quar- I
ter, and Biology 53 "Development '
and Physiology of the Organism"
in spring quarter.
"The order makes more sense," \
said Asst. Biology Prof. Deborah \
Gordon, lead instructor for Biolo
gy 51. "Students would get a better \
sense of the big picture and study
all the important concepts in the \
context of evolution."
Laura Mcintosh, Biology Core \
Coordinator, cited students' com- \
fort level with the subject as anoth- J
er reason why the core was reorga- J
nized. According to Mcintosh, stu- \
dents would not be immediately \
discouraged from continuing to \
study biology with the new se- '
quence. "It's a better transition to ;
the more difficult materials," said j
Mcintosh. •
