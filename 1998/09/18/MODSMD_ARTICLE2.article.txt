From CIV to I-Flum
As the Introduction to the Hu
manities program expands from
three to six tracks this year, CIV,
created in 1988 as the Area One re
quirement for incoming freshmen,
enters its last year of existence. The
new program began its phase-in last
year after its approval by the Facul
ty Senate in 1997.
Instead of ClV's three-quarter
sequence, the new program consists
of one fall quarter course and a win
ter-spring quarter course tandem..
Whereas the CIV program re

quired students to commit to the se
quence the summer before their
freshman year. Introduction to the
Humanities allows students to ex
plore their interests before choos
ing their courses for winter and
spring.
"Before, some students thought
they were making premature deci
sions without lots of info and with
out advising," said Cheryl Ross, As
sociate Director of Area One Pro
gram.
Under the new system, fresh
men will choose their two-quarter
winter-spring course in late fall.
Ross said, "It will be a follow-up to
the interest they've cultivated in the
fall."
This year, two-thirds of the in
coming freshmen will enroll in the
Introduction to the Humanities se
quence.
In addition to the structural dif
ferences, the new courses have
three to five assigned readings each
