# New dean of H&S takes over
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Senior staff writer 
Malcom Beasley is as close to a
Stanford native as it gets. The new
dean of Humanities and Sciences
was born in Stanford Hospital.
Yet Beasley's journey to the helm
of Stanford's largest school has been
a circuitous one. He spent over three
decades away from Stanford, having
lived in Hawaii during World War 11
and later on the East Coast. Educat
ed at Cornell, Beasley left a teaching
position at Harvard to return to
Stanford in 1974.
According to Beasley, the
Theodore and Sydney Rosenberg
Professor of Applied Physics, Stan
ford offered an environment that
complemented his interests, which
he characterizes as ranging from
"basic science to the science basic to
technology." Self-described as dis
liking the center stage, Beasley has
been a quiet but active participant in
the University since then.
A University citizen
Beasley is no stranger to the work
ings of the administration. During
the past two decades he has served
as chair of the Applied Physics De
partment, a faculty senator, a two
time member of the Appointments
and Promotions Committee and for
the past six years has served as the
director of the Center for Materials
Research. These experiences have
given Beasley a deep appreciation
for the quality of the faculty and for
the challenges of affecting change.
"Change is hard and it takes a
long time, but I've learned that if you
stick with it people will do the right
thing," he explained.
According to many of his col
leagues, Beasley has been a valuable
asset to the University, most notably
for his work in constructing intellec
tual communities and conceptualiz
ing issues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice com
mented that Beasley, who is also a
professor by courtesy in the School
of Engineering, was instrumental in
bringing faculty together to build the
McCullough Annex, the lab building
for the Center for Materials Re
search that is part of the new Science
and Engineering Quad.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
recounted his experiences working
with Beasley when Thomas was an
associate dean and Beasley was the
chair of the Applied Physics Depart
ment. "Beasley taught me what it
meant to be an institutional agent,"
Thomas said.
"Beasley's very much a long
range thinker, a skill that is very im
portant at this time," added Associ

ate Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Hans Andersen.
A teacher and researcher
Although Beasley has gained in
ternational prominence for his re
search on superconductors as part of
the so-called KGB group, which in
cludes applied physics colleagues
Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik and Prof.
Emeritus Theodore Geballe, he
takes great pride in his teaching.
He cites the experience of devel
oping and teaching a physics course
for non-scientists as one of his most
fulfilling experiences at Stanford.
For this course he won the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences in 1983.
"That award means a great deal
to me because it didn't start off so
perfectly. But once 1 figured out how
to do it, it went very well. In terms of
a curricular thing, while I've done
my share of undergraduate teaching,
that was special and different,"
Beasley said.
Most recently, Beasley helped
develop an undergraduate minor in

Applied Physics. Until now, Ap
plied Physics has only granted grad
uate degrees.
Beasley is also an active support
er of the Stanford Introductory
Studies program and other recent
initiatives that have attempted to
personalize the early undergraduate
years.
"The value added that you can
give the undergraduate experience
by contact with scholars is enor
mous. You can make a course better
by using more technology, but a dia
logue / seminar enriches the experi
ence of everyone involved. It is that
kind of mentoring experience that
uses rather than fights the resources
of the University," Beasley said.
Over the years, Beasley has also
offered guidance to other profes
sors. "Beasley was and still is a col
league in science, a friend and a 'wise
man' who has a fantastic feeling for
relations among people," said Ka
pitulnik. "In my early days at Stan
ford, Beasley in a very artful way
guided me through advisor-student
relations."
