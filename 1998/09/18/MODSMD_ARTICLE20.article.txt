# New dean of H&S takes over
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Senior staff writer 
Malcom Beasley is as close to a
Stanford native as it gets. The new
dean of Humanities and Sciences
was born in Stanford Hospital.
Yet Beasley's journey to the helm
of Stanford's largest school has been
a circuitous one. He spent over three
decades away from Stanford, having
lived in Hawaii during World War 11
and later on the East Coast. Educat
ed at Cornell, Beasley left a teaching
position at Harvard to return to
Stanford in 1974.
According to Beasley, the
Theodore and Sydney Rosenberg
Professor of Applied Physics, Stan
ford offered an environment that
complemented his interests, which
he characterizes as ranging from
"basic science to the science basic to
technology." Self-described as dis
liking the center stage, Beasley has
been a quiet but active participant in
the University since then.
A University citizen
Beasley is no stranger to the work
ings of the administration. During
the past two decades he has served
as chair of the Applied Physics De
partment, a faculty senator, a two
time member of the Appointments
and Promotions Committee and for
the past six years has served as the
director of the Center for Materials
Research. These experiences have
given Beasley a deep appreciation
for the quality of the faculty and for
the challenges of affecting change.
"Change is hard and it takes a
long time, but I've learned that if you
stick with it people will do the right
thing," he explained.
According to many of his col
leagues, Beasley has been a valuable
asset to the University, most notably
for his work in constructing intellec
tual communities and conceptualiz
ing issues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice com
mented that Beasley, who is also a
professor by courtesy in the School
of Engineering, was instrumental in
bringing faculty together to build the
McCullough Annex, the lab building
for the Center for Materials Re
search that is part of the new Science
and Engineering Quad.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
recounted his experiences working
with Beasley when Thomas was an
associate dean and Beasley was the
chair of the Applied Physics Depart
ment. "Beasley taught me what it
meant to be an institutional agent,"
Thomas said.
"Beasley's very much a long
range thinker, a skill that is very im
portant at this time," added Associ

ate Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Hans Andersen.
A teacher and researcher
Although Beasley has gained in
ternational prominence for his re
search on superconductors as part of
the so-called KGB group, which in
cludes applied physics colleagues
Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik and Prof.
Emeritus Theodore Geballe, he
takes great pride in his teaching.
He cites the experience of devel
oping and teaching a physics course
for non-scientists as one of his most
fulfilling experiences at Stanford.
For this course he won the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences in 1983.
"That award means a great deal
to me because it didn't start off so
perfectly. But once 1 figured out how
to do it, it went very well. In terms of
a curricular thing, while I've done
my share of undergraduate teaching,
that was special and different,"
Beasley said.
Most recently, Beasley helped
develop an undergraduate minor in

Applied Physics. Until now, Ap
plied Physics has only granted grad
uate degrees.
Beasley is also an active support
er of the Stanford Introductory
Studies program and other recent
initiatives that have attempted to
personalize the early undergraduate
years.
"The value added that you can
give the undergraduate experience
by contact with scholars is enor
mous. You can make a course better
by using more technology, but a dia
logue / seminar enriches the experi
ence of everyone involved. It is that
kind of mentoring experience that
uses rather than fights the resources
of the University," Beasley said.
Over the years, Beasley has also
offered guidance to other profes
sors. "Beasley was and still is a col
league in science, a friend and a 'wise
man' who has a fantastic feeling for
relations among people," said Ka
pitulnik. "In my early days at Stan
ford, Beasley in a very artful way
guided me through advisor-student
relations."

On Stanford and becoming dean
During the two-plus decades that he
has been at Stanford, Beasley has
observed the University mature as
an institution.
"It has more traditions than
when I came, but it is still in some
sense defining what kind of institu
tion it is, and this is something that I
find very exciting," he said.
However, he also noted the chal
lenges inherent in an era in which
acadcmia is not experiencing enor
mous growth.
" This factor raises issues of how
we should run our business to be as
strong as it can in the financial cli
mate and cultural milieu in which we
live."
Vet Beasley remains optimistic
about the University's future. "Stan
lord is still getting better in terms of
how it operates as a I Jniversity and it
is also getting better in terms of the
quality of its faculty. The search
committee asked me whether it is
harder to get tenure here now than it
used to he.and I think it is. The place
is better and it is recruiting from a
wider range of places, including
overseas." Beasley said.
()n his plans for his term as dean.
Beasley explained that this is not a
time for "automatic pilot."
"I'd like to use my tour of duty to
strengthen the place with the best
appointments and to handle its di
versity to make sure that ideas get
expressed. Deans make principal
decisions on appointments, and
those decisions impact the institu
tion for 20 years or more." Beaslev
said.
()n the issue of tenure for minor

ity and women faculty, Beasley em
phasized that he sincerely believes
that the recent discussion in the Fac
ulty Senate was a useful expression
of concerns by faculty.
"A re-commitment to diversity
as it is thoughtfully expressed is a
good thing." Beasley said, "though I
do support the provost's position
that at the level of tenure no distinc
tions should be made. This is a real
quality issue, and this is good for
both the institution and the people
involved."
When asked why he took on this
position at this point in his career,
Beasley lightheartedly remarked
that it's "one hell of a way of dealing
with your late- middle-age crisis."
Meetinng diverse needs
With faculty interests ranging from
literature to anthropology to
chemistry. Humanities and Sci
ences is Stanford's most diverse
school. Thomas, who served as the
school's dean from 19KK to 1993,
emphasized that the key to success
is learning to manage the school
rather than being beaten by the di
versity of its needs.
"It's complexity could look
daunting, but you can get your hands
around it. Indeed its great advantage
is its diversity." said Thomas.
Beasley echoed Thomas in em
phasizing the importance of the
school as a single unit. "I don't
think anybody who has thought
hard about the School of Humani
ties and Sciences doesn't recognize
that it is hard to make it work be
cause of all of its diversity. But it
needs to be a single school princi
pally because of the teaching role it
plays. So you have to keep trying to
find the best way to do it — some of
it is administrative, some of it is
leadership and some of it is bully

pulpiting."
Although he recognizes that
meeting the school's vast variety of
needs isn't an easy task, Beasley
said he is not aware of any serious
controversies that have arisen
among the three elements of the
school.
"Even in budget cutting days, I
think that everybody understood
that this is a school and that we
would rise and fall together,"
Beasley said.
The personal side
Beasley praises the University for
its outward look, a characteristic
that many of his colleagues have
noted he also possesses.
"Several years ago, I was work
ing with a group of people on a pro
ject and among the group was a
Chinese American," Beasley said.
The project was in a state of crisis,
and this particular individual had
asked Beasley how he felt about it.
"I said that I couldn't tell yet
whether this was a good thing or a
problem," Beasley said. Six
months later, Beasley received a
work of calligraphy from the man
which portrayed the word for 'cri
sis' in Chinese. "It consists of the
characters 'danger' and 'opportu
nity.' He had captured my emo
tions at that moment, and I was re
ally very touched."
When not teaching, researching
or serving on University commit
tees Beasley enjoys hiking and re
laxing in the mountains.
Beasley and his wife, Jo Anne,
recently purchased land in the
Trinity Alps, a region west of Shas
ta. where they have been vacation
ing for over 20 years. They plan on
building a cabin there that will be
designed by their daughter Claire,
a San Francisco architect.

guided me through advisor-student
relations."

On Stanford and becoming dean
During the two-plus decades that he
has been at Stanford, Beasley has
observed the University mature as
an institution.
"It has more traditions than
when I came, but it is still in some
sense defining what kind of institu
tion it is, and this is something that I
find very exciting," he said.
However, he also noted the chal
lenges inherent in an era in which
acadcmia is not experiencing enor
mous growth.
" This factor raises issues of how
we should run our business to be as
strong as it can in the financial cli
mate and cultural milieu in which we
live."
Vet Beasley remains optimistic
about the University's future. "Stan
lord is still getting better in terms of
how it operates as a I Jniversity and it
is also getting better in terms of the
quality of its faculty. The search
committee asked me whether it is
harder to get tenure here now than it
used to he.and I think it is. The place
is better and it is recruiting from a
wider range of places, including
overseas." Beasley said.
()n his plans for his term as dean.
Beasley explained that this is not a
time for "automatic pilot."
"I'd like to use my tour of duty to
strengthen the place with the best
appointments and to handle its di
versity to make sure that ideas get
expressed. Deans make principal
decisions on appointments, and
those decisions impact the institu
tion for 20 years or more." Beaslev
said.
()n the issue of tenure for minor

ity and women faculty, Beasley em
phasized that he sincerely believes
that the recent discussion in the Fac
ulty Senate was a useful expression
of concerns by faculty.
"A re-commitment to diversity
as it is thoughtfully expressed is a
good thing." Beasley said, "though I
do support the provost's position
that at the level of tenure no distinc
tions should be made. This is a real
quality issue, and this is good for
both the institution and the people
involved."
When asked why he took on this
position at this point in his career,
Beasley lightheartedly remarked
that it's "one hell of a way of dealing
with your late- middle-age crisis."
Meetinng diverse needs
With faculty interests ranging from
literature to anthropology to
chemistry. Humanities and Sci
ences is Stanford's most diverse
school. Thomas, who served as the
school's dean from 19KK to 1993,
emphasized that the key to success
is learning to manage the school
rather than being beaten by the di
versity of its needs.
"It's complexity could look
daunting, but you can get your hands
around it. Indeed its great advantage
is its diversity." said Thomas.
Beasley echoed Thomas in em
phasizing the importance of the
school as a single unit. "I don't
think anybody who has thought
hard about the School of Humani
ties and Sciences doesn't recognize
that it is hard to make it work be
cause of all of its diversity. But it
needs to be a single school princi
pally because of the teaching role it
plays. So you have to keep trying to
find the best way to do it — some of
it is administrative, some of it is
leadership and some of it is bully

pulpiting."
Although he recognizes that
meeting the school's vast variety of
needs isn't an easy task, Beasley
said he is not aware of any serious
controversies that have arisen
among the three elements of the
school.
"Even in budget cutting days, I
think that everybody understood
that this is a school and that we
would rise and fall together,"
Beasley said.
The personal side
Beasley praises the University for
its outward look, a characteristic
that many of his colleagues have
noted he also possesses.
"Several years ago, I was work
ing with a group of people on a pro
ject and among the group was a
Chinese American," Beasley said.
The project was in a state of crisis,
and this particular individual had
asked Beasley how he felt about it.
"I said that I couldn't tell yet
whether this was a good thing or a
problem," Beasley said. Six
months later, Beasley received a
work of calligraphy from the man
which portrayed the word for 'cri
sis' in Chinese. "It consists of the
characters 'danger' and 'opportu
nity.' He had captured my emo
tions at that moment, and I was re
ally very touched."
When not teaching, researching
or serving on University commit
tees Beasley enjoys hiking and re
laxing in the mountains.
Beasley and his wife, Jo Anne,
recently purchased land in the
Trinity Alps, a region west of Shas
ta. where they have been vacation
ing for over 20 years. They plan on
building a cabin there that will be
designed by their daughter Claire,
a San Francisco architect.
Malcom Beasley is as close to a
Stanford native as it gets. The new
dean of Humanities and Sciences
was born in Stanford Hospital.
Yet Beasley's journey to the helm
of Stanford's largest school has been
a circuitous one. He spent over three
decades away from Stanford, having
lived in Hawaii during World War 11
and later on the East Coast. Educat
ed at Cornell, Beasley left a teaching
position at Harvard to return to
Stanford in 1974.
According to Beasley, the
Theodore and Sydney Rosenberg
Professor of Applied Physics, Stan
ford offered an environment that
complemented his interests, which
he characterizes as ranging from
"basic science to the science basic to
technology." Self-described as dis
liking the center stage, Beasley has
been a quiet but active participant in
the University since then.
A University citizen
Beasley is no stranger to the work
ings of the administration. During
the past two decades he has served
as chair of the Applied Physics De
partment, a faculty senator, a two
time member of the Appointments
and Promotions Committee and for
the past six years has served as the
director of the Center for Materials
Research. These experiences have
given Beasley a deep appreciation
for the quality of the faculty and for
the challenges of affecting change.
"Change is hard and it takes a
long time, but I've learned that if you
stick with it people will do the right
thing," he explained.
According to many of his col
leagues, Beasley has been a valuable
asset to the University, most notably
for his work in constructing intellec
tual communities and conceptualiz
ing issues.
Provost Condoleezza Rice com
mented that Beasley, who is also a
professor by courtesy in the School
of Engineering, was instrumental in
bringing faculty together to build the
McCullough Annex, the lab building
for the Center for Materials Re
search that is part of the new Science
and Engineering Quad.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas
recounted his experiences working
with Beasley when Thomas was an
associate dean and Beasley was the
chair of the Applied Physics Depart
ment. "Beasley taught me what it
meant to be an institutional agent,"
Thomas said.
"Beasley's very much a long
range thinker, a skill that is very im
portant at this time," added Associ

ate Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Hans Andersen.
A teacher and researcher
Although Beasley has gained in
ternational prominence for his re
search on superconductors as part of
the so-called KGB group, which in
cludes applied physics colleagues
Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik and Prof.
Emeritus Theodore Geballe, he
takes great pride in his teaching.
He cites the experience of devel
oping and teaching a physics course
for non-scientists as one of his most
fulfilling experiences at Stanford.
For this course he won the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences in 1983.
"That award means a great deal
to me because it didn't start off so
perfectly. But once 1 figured out how
to do it, it went very well. In terms of
a curricular thing, while I've done
my share of undergraduate teaching,
that was special and different,"
Beasley said.
Most recently, Beasley helped
develop an undergraduate minor in

Applied Physics. Until now, Ap
plied Physics has only granted grad
uate degrees.
Beasley is also an active support
er of the Stanford Introductory
Studies program and other recent
initiatives that have attempted to
personalize the early undergraduate
years.
"The value added that you can
give the undergraduate experience
by contact with scholars is enor
mous. You can make a course better
by using more technology, but a dia
logue / seminar enriches the experi
ence of everyone involved. It is that
kind of mentoring experience that
uses rather than fights the resources
of the University," Beasley said.
Over the years, Beasley has also
offered guidance to other profes
sors. "Beasley was and still is a col
league in science, a friend and a 'wise
man' who has a fantastic feeling for
relations among people," said Ka
pitulnik. "In my early days at Stan
ford, Beasley in a very artful way
guided me through advisor-student
relations."
