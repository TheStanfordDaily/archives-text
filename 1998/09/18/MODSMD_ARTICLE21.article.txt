# Pfefferbaum suspended three years, fined

### Saurabh Prakash Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper has fired the latest salvo in
the University's contentious two
year dispute with Psychiatry Prof.
Adolf Pfefferbaum. Following the
suggestions of a faculty advisory
board, Casper suspended the re
spected neurological researcher for
three years without pay and fined
him $20.(MX) — the second most se
vere penalty in University history.
Casper's move follows the
board's conclusion in June that Pfef
ferbaum neglected his academic
duty by retiring in 19% from a post
at the Palo Alto Veterans Adminis
tration Medical Center after a rift
with the hospital leadership. The
University contended that Pffefer
baum's action amounted to a resig
nation from his Stanford appoint
ment as well.
Pfefferbaum has until Oct. 1 to
pay the fine and agree to several
conditions set by Casper. He could
also send the dispute back to the
courts.

Casper initially sought Pfeffer
baum's dismissal, but has reluctant
ly gone along with the board's rec
ommendation of a fine and suspen
sion. The board's decisions are not
binding on the President.
The only tenured professor in
Stanford's 107-year history to be
fired was English Prof. Bruce
Franklin, a Maoist who urged stu
dents protesting the Vietnam War
to burn campus buildings.
Under Casper's interpretation of
the punishment. Pfefferbaum's sus
pension began Sept. I and will con
tinue until 2001, when he will re
ceive a faculty position commensu
rate with his experience.
Before retirement from the VA.
Pfefferbaum earned $148,500, most
ly from VA funds and research
grants in his name. During his sus
pension Stanford will pay him
$22,795; upon reinstatement the
University will restore Pfeffer
baum's salary to its previous levels.
Pfefferbaum is currently a re
searcher at SRI Consulting in
Menlo Park.
I.ike many other Medical School

faculty, Pfefferbaum was also an
employee of the VA hospital, where
he had carried out his research and
clinical duties for 22 years. He had
also headed the Mental Health Clin
ical Research Center.
Pfefferbaum disagreed with
Stanford's position regarding his
resignation from the VA hospital
and pressed his claims in Santa
Clara County Superior Court. Fol
lowing a ruling in favor of the pro
fessor, the University initiated dis
missal proceedings, appointing a
hearings officer to resolve disputed
facts.
Pfefferbaum had contended that
the VA administration had inter
fered with his academic duties and
prompted his resignation. An inves
tigation by the Advisory Board re
vealed insufficient evidence to sup
port those charges.
"There were no concrete in
stances of discriminatory treatment
of Prof. Pfefferbaum in the conduct
of his academic duties as a Stanford
faculty member that resulted from
his dispute with the [VA Hospital)
administration," they wrote.

Despite severely eensuring Pfef
ferbaum for leaving his VA position,
the Advisory Board ultimately chose
not to recommend dismissal because
of several mitigating factors.
"Most important," the board
concluded in its report, "was his
long career as a successful re
searcher and teacher... the fact that
... his motives were not base or ma
licious [and] because the former
leadership of the Medical School
had been insufficiently responsive
to Prof. PfefferbaunVs original com
plaints.
"There might well have been ...
missed opportunities to avoid this
long and traumatic process."
Though the Advisory Board was
more lenient towards Pfefferbaum
than the President had wanted,
Casper did warn that "henceforth
no faculty member will be able to
claim such similar good faith."
Casper added that "it is a viola
tion of Stanford University policy
for a faculty member to abandon his
or her existing academic assignment
and demand that the University lo
cate a new assignment."
