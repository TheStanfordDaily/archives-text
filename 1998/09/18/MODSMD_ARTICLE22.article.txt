# Respected biologist honored by peers
## Prof. Paul Green dies 
### Chaney Rankin Contributing writer 
Paul Green, a renowned plant
biologist and Biological Sciences
professor at Stanford, died of pan
creatic cancer on Aug. 18. He was
67.
Although some of his theories
were considered unconventional.
Green was a widely respected ex
pert in the field of plant physiology
and development. He is best
known for discovering that the
basic patterns found among plant
structures are not solely genetic,
but are also due to the mechanical
properties of the tissues involved.
While Green may have at times
felt alone in his hypotheses, he was
gratified to discover the positive
impact he had on many scientists,
according to Biology Prof. Peter
Ray.
A symposium was held in his
honor about two weeks prior to his
death. Over 80 scientists from
around the country attended to
share what they had learned from
Green.
Green's contributions were for
mally recognized the week follow
ing the symposium by the Botani
cal Society of America. He was
given two prestigious awards for
"his innovative, technically bril
liant and analytically fundamental
work on plant morphogenesis."
Green is equally well remem
bered for his warm personality and
character. The symposium's orga

nizers, Green's colleagues Ray and
Virginia Walbot, spoke very highly
of him.
"Paul was a highly focused sci
entist exploring the biophysics of
plant growth, but also a person who
treasured the events of every day
life: a rewarding family life, close
friends, the beauty of nature and
the sheer fun of existence," wrote
Walbot in her Memorial Resolu
tion for Green.
In addition to teaching, over the
years Green served on the Faculty
Senate, the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid, the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement
and various departmental commit
tees.
Paul Green was bom on Feb. 15,
1931 in Philadelphia. He attended
the University of Pennsylvania,
and he received his doctorate from
Princeton. He joined the Stanford
faculty in 1971. Green was
loved by staff, students and col
leagues alike. "Dr. Green was just
terrific, a wonderful person and
very easygoing." says Betty Price,
the administrator of the Biology
Department. "The staff always en
joyed working with him."
Undergraduate Research Co
ordinator Ellen Mac Donald re
members that he always made her
job easier: "I often feel like 1 have
to harass the faculty to get them to
speak to undergraduate seminars,
but Dr. Green always said yes. with
a smile."
