In effort to increase emergency preparedness
and respond to student input, Housing and Dining
Services implemented several changes this sum
mer.

Foremost among them was the installation of
several emergency preparatory silos on campus.
These silos will be filled with supplies that would
be used on the event of a major disaster.
"We have five sites in strategic spots. These are
places we could get to quickly, even though they
are not in the middle of everyday student activity,"
said Rodger Whitney, associate director of Stu
dent Housing. Each of the sites covers a general
area of the campus, such as West Campus, the
Row or graduate housing.
In order to improve safety and convenience, 40
new courtesy visitor phones have been installed
outside student residences.
"They will make it easier for a student to con
tact a friend in the residence if the door is locked.
Additionally, these phones will mean that outside
doors of residences will not have to be propped
open, which was a problem last year," Whitney
said.

As for improvements within the dorms them
selves, plans are being developed to provide some
limited custodial services on the weekends. "Stu
dents pointed out to us that the dorms would often
get really messy over the weekend, so on Sunday
mornings, we'll be doing some light cleanup," said
Whitney. Additionally, students can also make
fix-it requests online.
Wheelchair accessibility is also being im
proved. Muwekma-Tah-Ruk was made accessible
and construction will soon begin for an elevator in
Kimball Hall. According to Whitney, the target
date for completion of the construction in Kimball
is early winter quarter.
Though the housing crunch was a major issue
last fall. Housing and Dining Services has worked
to alleviate the shortages. During the 1997-98 aca
demic year, many study rooms were used as tem
porary dorm rooms for undergraduate students.
This year, Housing and Dining has restored be
tween 30 and 40 of these rooms to their original
study or gaming purposes.
"All guaranteed undergrads have been
housed, or will be by this weekend," explained
Whitney.
In addition to these small-scale efforts, the Uni

versity's ongoing 15-year Capital Improvement
Plan moved forward this summer with the refur
bishing of Lagunita Court and Cowell Cluster.
Cowell Cluster residents have certainly noticed
the difference. "The Cowell Cluster was pretty
dark. [Before the renovation,] people definitely
did not draw into these dorms for the cleanliness,"
said Santos Marroquin, a senior who has lived in
Alpha Sigma and Terra House.
Andrew Leeds, a junior living in newly reno
vated Terra, was enthusiastic about the new look.
"It's really clean, the carpet is clean, the kitchen
looks brand new, and the best touch: when you
walk into the bathroom, the lights go on automat
ically"
Next on the agenda for Housing and Dining
Services is the renovation of the "lake houses" in
summer 1999. The four "lake houses" are: Narnia,
Lambda Nu, Kappa Alpha, and Enchanted Broc
coli Forest. Already, plans are being made for the
Summer 2(XH) renovation ofToyon Hall. Escondi
do Village is gradually being renovated over the
next two years.
"Though many students who are not around
may not realize it, summer is the busiest time of
the year for us," said Whitney.
