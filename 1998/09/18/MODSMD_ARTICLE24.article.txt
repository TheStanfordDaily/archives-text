# BEHIND THE SCENES
## 
### 
So you recognize Casper, and probably Condi too.
You might even know what jobs they hold, but do
you know what they actually do?
University President Gerhard Casper is the leader
of Stanford University, but under his guidance, re
sponsibilities are divided among many administrators,
including the 12 who make up the University Cabinet.

Hie 11 individuals who advise the president — the
provost, the academic deans, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center director and the Hoover Institu
tion's director — all guide their respective Universi
ty divisions, reporting to the president and imple
menting his directives while also carrying out their
own initiatives.

(■crhurd Casper
('hid among ( asper's achieve
ments since taking the helm of the
University in 1992 has been the
overhaul of undergraduate educa
tion and an increased effort to so
licit donations from alumni. On the
curriculum front, he has helped
create new programs, including
Sophomore College and the new
freshman and sophomore seminar
program, Stanford Introductory
Studies. He has also overseen the
merger of Stanford's medical cen
ter with UC-San Francisco's.
Before coming to Stanford,
Casper taught political science at
UC-Berkley and the University of
Chicago. At Chicago, he later
served as the dean of the law school
and university provost.
An expert on constitutional
law, Casper published a book titled
"Separating Power: Essays on the
Founding Period" in 1997.

Malcolm Beasley
I'hc newest member of the
President's cabinet, Beasley
took over as dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences on
Sept. 1. He now oversees the
largest and broadest school on
the Stanford campus.
Beasley was instrumental in
the establishment of the Labora
tory for Advanced Materials,
bringing together 24 faculty
from five science departments.
A member of the Stanford
faculty since P)74. Beasley was
formerly a research associate
and then faculty member at I lar
vard University. Beasley has
served Stanford as the chair of
the Department of Applied
Physics and as director of the
( enter for Materials Research at
Stanford, a multidisciplinary re
search center.

Charles kruger
When kruger, a professor of
mechanical engineering, was
named dean of research and
graduate policy in 1992, he in
herited the complicated and
touchy issues of an indirect-cost
controversy and graduate stu
dent dissatisfaction. Since then,
Stanford has settled questions of
its impropriety in reporting indi
rect costs with the federal gov
ernment and many graduate is
sues. such as housing, are being
worked on.
A member of the Stanford
faculty for 35 years, Kruger has
chaired the Faculty Senate.

Michael Spence
Spence came to Stanford from
its eternal rival in all matters acad
emic, but, nevertheless, the for
mer Dean of the Harvard Faculty

cessful in his move to the position
of dean at the (iraduate School of
Business. In his eight-year tenure,
the school has seen its applica
tions to the highest level ever:
7 .(MM) for 360 spaces. Under his
watch, the University built the
$31-million Schwab Residential
Center to house graduate stu
dents and executive program par
ticipants.
Spence, who will be leaving

ministrated Stanford's $1.4 billion
budget in addition to overseeing
1.4(H) faculty members and over
I4.(HH) students.
The early portion of Rice's

versity's $18-million budget cuts,
but she has since become more in
volved in issues such as curricular
reform.

sor. has served on the Stanford fac
ulty since 1981. She took a leave to
serve as a top aide on President
Bush's National Security Council.

lic Interest Law and is now the
Richard L. Lang Professor ol Law
and Dean.

Iranklin Orr

dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences since IWS. Orr has over
seen several expansions in the
school's curriculum m recent
years, including new major
tracks, new seminars, and the de
velopment of the Science. Math
and Engineering C ore.
Before coming to Stanford m
l l )N5. Orr taught at the New
Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology, did research at the
Shell Development Company
and acted as assistant to the di
rector of the Office ol 112 ederal
Activities of the U.S. Environ
mental Protection Agency.

Burton Richtcr
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Director Richter came to
Stanford as a postdoctoral fellow
in 1956 and has been here ever
since, becoming director in IW4.
Recently. Richter has facedbudget
cuts and layoffs, but has also
presided overdevelopment of new
x-ray and gamma-ray technology.
The winner of the Nobel
Prize in physics. Richter directs the
administration of SI.At . a center
dedicated to basic research in ele
mentary particle physics.
Richter specializes in experi
mental particle physics with high
energy electrons and has been a
member of advisory committees to
the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory, the Max Planck Insti
tute and the U.S. Department of
Energy, which awarded him the
E.O. Lawrence Medal.

Kugcnc Bauer
Entering his third year as
dean of the School of Medicine,
Bauer has had to address the
changing character of the health
care industry. Bauer has faced
one of these changes head-on,
the growth and merging of
health care providers, in his posi
tion on the board of directors of
the newly merged UCSF-Stan
ford Health Care.
Before being named dean,
Bauer was head of the Depart
ment of Dermatology for seven
years. During his tenure in the
department, he focused on
strengthening both its clinical
and research aspects. He had
previously served on the faculty
of Washington University and
completed his residency and a
research fellowship at the
Barnes Hospital in St. Louis.

John Hennessy
Hennessy, formerly chair of
the Computer Science Depart
ment, became dean of the School
of Engineering in June 1997. A
major priority for Hennessy has
been the full integration of com
puters and information technolo
gy into both research and teach
ing. He has helped develop a
work study program that match
es engineering students with
startup companies.
Hennessy brings to the posi
tion not only teaching experi
ence. but familiarity with Silicon
Valley entrepreneurship. In
1984 he founded MIPS Comput
er Systems, a company based on
a new method of computer ar
chitecture called reduced in
struction set computers that he
and a colleague developed at
Stanford.

Richard Shavelson
Shavelson returned to his
alma mater five years ago to take
over the position of dean of the
School of Education, and, during
his years as dean, the education
program has been consistently
ranked as one of the best in the
country.
However, Shavelson is far
from coasting in his success. He
is actively working to increase
funds for graduate education.
Shavelson is also changing the
classroom environment and in
struction to better integrate
technology into the school's edu
cational program.
Before returning to Stanford,
Shavelson worked at UCLA and
IJC-Santa Barbara. Much of his
current research has focused on
the development of perfor
mance assessments.

John Raisian
The often rocky relationship
between the Hoover Institution
and Stanford has improved since
Raisian took over as Hoover di
rector in 1988, replacing W.
Glenn Campbell, the institu
tion's head for 35 years.
The Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship hit a low point during
the mid-1980s when faculty suc
cessful Iv stopped the Reagan
Presidential Library from being
housed on campus and support
ed a movement to bring the insti
tution under "normal academic
governance."
Over the past 25 years,
Raisian has worked as a profes
sor. an economist for the U.S.
Department of Labor and exec
utive director of the President's
Task Force on Food Assistance.
