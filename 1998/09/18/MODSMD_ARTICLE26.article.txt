# Alumni Association merges with University
## 
### Evan Moffic Editorial staff 
In a move designed to make the
Stanford Alumni Association more
efficient and involved in student and
University affairs, the association be
came a official division of the Uni
versity Sept. 1.
Members of the alumni associa
tion voted by a margin of 92 percent
to 8 percent over the summer to
merge the association into the Uni
versity.
The most visible symbol of the
new relationship will be the con
struction of an alumni facility on the
north side of campus, adjacent to
Frost Amphitheater.
Envisioned as a "welcome home"
center for alumni, the building will
have meeting space, a great hall, a
history room, a business center and a
cafe.
As a division of the University,
the new association will be better
equipped to make a bigger impact on
students.
According to Marie Earl, director
of systems and services at the associ
ation, the merger will involve alumni
in University projects such as recruit
ing and mentoring students, as well
as sponsoring events such as the se
nior farewell dinner on the Quad.
The merger makes new alumni
initiatives more feasible by combin
ing the resources of the University
with the contacts and projects of the
Alumni Association.
"The alliance gives us more fund
ing, event space and access to faculty
and University resources that will
help strengthen all that we are
doing," said Bill Stone, director of
the association.
Improving students' class spirit to
develop more committed alumni is a
major goal of the new association.
Administrators, students and
alumni are already combining their
efforts to promote more class spirit.
New all-freshman housing, more
consistent communication about
alumni-related opportunities for stu
dents and more class-specific events
will help to build stronger ties to the

University.
James Montoya, vice provost for
student affairs, said a committee of
students, faculty and staff will meet
this fall to identify activities that
would serve this goal.
"One activity already planned by
the New Student Orientation Corn-

'It is important for
pedestrians to be able to
signal for help at any
time.'

mittee is a frosh formal in Novem
ber. In addition, I know the Toyon
staff will be sponsoring activities
open to the entire sophomore class,"
Montoya added.
In addition to strengthening the
commitment of current students to
the University, the new association

hopes to reach out to current alumni
and better harness their talents and
resources for the benefit of the Uni
versity.
Plans for new alumni programs
are already underway. These plans
include a clearinghouse to increase
opportunities for alumni to volun
teer their time and talent, enhanced
alumni education and more services
on the Stanford Alumni World Wide
Website.
"Alumni support comes in other
colors than green," joked Stone.
"For example, if Stanford decid
ed to set up an overseas center in
Norway, the assistance of a Ameri
can diplomat in Norway who is a
Stanford graduate could help facili
tate the process," he said.
Stone believes that new alumni
projects like the volunteer clearing
house will benefit the University and
lead to more satisfied alumni.
"If alumni feel a sense of useful
ness to the University, they are apt to

become more involved with Univer
sity affairs and participate in the on
going improvement of the Universi
ty," Stone noted.
"Most other universities have in
tegrated alumni associations, and we
are advancing to a more effective
and traditional model."
A small hut vocal group of alum
ni opposed to the merger feared that
as part of the university, the new
alumni association would lose its in
dependent voice and flexibility.
Stone expressed hope that inte
gration will lead to more alumni in
volvement with the university and
"more opportunities to express con
cerns and be part of the decision
making process."
The staff of the association is ex
cited about the possibilities. "The
merger turns up the heat on our re
sponsibility to help students get
more out of the alumni and commu
nicate our programs more effective
ly," said Earl.
