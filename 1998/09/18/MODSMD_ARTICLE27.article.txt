# Campus Life
## Farm traditions: weird, wacky and wonderful 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, you got in, you pieked out some semi-at
tractive yet reasonably prieed bedding, and you're get
ting the hang of Stanford. Congratulations, you made it.
But now is not the time to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on campus, it's im
perative that you learn a few fundamental traditions.
These will soon become second nature, like clapping too
fast and jumping at just the right time when the Stanford
Band plays "All Right Now."
First things first: the Orientation square dance. Yes,
it's cheesy. Yes, you'll look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little heart out. It will be one
of those Hallmark memories of years to come, unforget
table if only for the fact that you actually put aside your
embarrassment and kept your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on the Quad, your one
chance for guilt-free tongue jousting with a total
stranger. You submit because you're supposed to. In
order to become a Stanford man or woman, according to
legend, a freshman must kiss a senior in the Quad under
the light of the full moon. It's a little sleazier and not
quite as poetic as it sounds, but be a good sport. Hope
fully the moon won't provide enough light for anyone to
recognize you later and incriminate you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be seen at Stanford's one
regular weekly social outing. Flicks. These almost-up-to
date movie offerings staged in Memorial Auditorium
are a great opportunity to check out male pattern bald
ness trends among those in the orchestra seats, as well as
your one shot to nail that prep school kid in your CIV
class during the pre-show paper fight. Word has it that to
achieve the nirvana of true senior status one must suc
cessfully float a paper airplane from the balcony and hit

Stanford students celebrate their oldest tradition: Cal bashing at Big Game.
the movie screen.
Halloween sets the scene for a
less wholesome, frenzied rite as the
student body heads on down to the
resting place of our beloved
founders. Mom. Dad and little Ice
land. and dances on their graves. A
little morbid and ungrateful, per
haps, hut the Mausoleum provides a
perfectly eerie backdrop for the
wickedness of the holiday.
()nce November rolls around, all
the cosmic energy on campus focus
es on one deliciously malicious goal:
to beat Cal. Out comes the name
calling (they're a bunch of Wee
nies), the Axe wielding and the
most high schoolesque display ol
Stanford spirit you will get out of a
group of semi-apathetic smart peo
ple.
Three years ago, Stanford re
claimed the Axe — a hallowed arti
cle awarded to the winner of each
Big (iame — for the first time since
1993.
Rig (lame week includes many
can't-miss-or-you're-lame events
such as Gaieties, a student-written
comedy revue that takes the oppor
tunity to playfully go for the C'al
jugular. Gaieties also sends more
visible Stanford icons up in flames in
a joking, pseudo-plot filled musical.
And when they say "Branner
sucks," they're only teasing. Don't
take it personally.
You also learn the Axe Cheer
(highlighted by such tricky and com
plex lines as "(live 'em the Axe" and
"Right in the neck"). Although Big
(iame week has never been the
same without the towering Bonfire
(canceled four years ago because of
the tiger salamander population in
the Lake Lagunita bed), plans are al
ways in the works to find a "healthy"
alternative.
Big Game itself is the one time
you can do the "We Got In" cheer
without feeling like your ego's the
si/e of Montana. The Cal band
dodges frozen oranges thrown from
the stands and the Axe Committee
prepares to take back their baby. ()n
that electric niuht. no matter what

the score, the campus erupts in
snot v.ing,
boredom-ridden silence as the all
day tailgates take a toll and campus
turns lame, lame, lame.
I rom there, Stanford takes a turn
for the worse as everybody and any
body tries to reverse the dateless
trend that has crushed the campus
under its weight. As fun as the whole
blind date concept is in theory, in re
ality it proves even more painful as
dormitories throw Screw Your
Roommate parties. Although you
may not meet your potential soul
mate, it is a good way to get back at
your roommate for her snooze but
ton addiction.

And when romantic frustration
doesn't outweigh academic frustra
tion — usually for the two weeks
each quarter during Dead and Fi
nals Weeks — another tradition
rears its ugly head. At midnight,
every night of Dead Week, students
cough their tonsils out in the Primal
Scream, yelling out CIV reading
frustrations and writer's-block
woes.
These are just a few of the tradi
tions which give Stanford a kicked
back yet amusingly off-heat atmos
phere. No one takes them very seri
ously now. but you'll miss them all
too soon when vou undergo that last
tradition — graduation.
