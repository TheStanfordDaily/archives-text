## Farm traditions: weird, wacky and wonderful 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
You're here, you got in, you pieked out some semi-at
tractive yet reasonably prieed bedding, and you're get
ting the hang of Stanford. Congratulations, you made it.
But now is not the time to rest on your laurels.
As you're learning the ropes here on campus, it's im
perative that you learn a few fundamental traditions.
These will soon become second nature, like clapping too
fast and jumping at just the right time when the Stanford
Band plays "All Right Now."
First things first: the Orientation square dance. Yes,
it's cheesy. Yes, you'll look like a redneck. But get out
there and do-si-do your tiny little heart out. It will be one
of those Hallmark memories of years to come, unforget
table if only for the fact that you actually put aside your
embarrassment and kept your laughing at the caller to a
minimum.
Soon after comes Full Moon on the Quad, your one
chance for guilt-free tongue jousting with a total
stranger. You submit because you're supposed to. In
order to become a Stanford man or woman, according to
legend, a freshman must kiss a senior in the Quad under
the light of the full moon. It's a little sleazier and not
quite as poetic as it sounds, but be a good sport. Hope
fully the moon won't provide enough light for anyone to
recognize you later and incriminate you in any way.
All the while, you'll see and be seen at Stanford's one
regular weekly social outing. Flicks. These almost-up-to
date movie offerings staged in Memorial Auditorium
are a great opportunity to check out male pattern bald
ness trends among those in the orchestra seats, as well as
your one shot to nail that prep school kid in your CIV
class during the pre-show paper fight. Word has it that to
achieve the nirvana of true senior status one must suc
cessfully float a paper airplane from the balcony and hit
