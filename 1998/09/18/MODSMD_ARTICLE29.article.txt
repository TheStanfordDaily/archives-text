# Dazed and confused
## The 						freshman's guide for the perplexed 
### 
As helpful as your resident assis
tant may he, your first few weeks at
Stanford can he a little disorient
ing. To make your first weeks at
Stanford as worry-free as possible,
we compiled this list of answers to
some of the most frequently asked
Orientation week questions:
Q: How do I pay my University bill
and ensure my financial aid?
A: To pay your bill, go to the Oak
West lounge on the second floor of
Tresidder Union. If you already
have a check for the amount due.
just look for the big box in which to
deposit your yellow envelope. If
you suspect an error in your bill or
need to get loan disbursements or
pick up scholarship money, there
are several specific counters to as
sist you. But if you have questions,
come early — lines can get long.
For those who have no clue
where to begin, there is even a "No
Clue" line to stand in.
Q: What happens if I miss an Ori
entation activity?

A: Relax. Orientation programs
are recommended but not manda
tory. Every opportunity to get to
know Stanford and the people
around you will pay off in the long
run. but things may come up that
prevent you from attending every
activity. Pick the activities that you
think are important or sound inter
esting and attend those.
O: Do 1 need to take a math, chem
istry or foreign language place
ment test?
A: Math: If you do not have AP
credit or college transfer credit and
wish to take a math class, you need
to take the math placement test.
Ihose who have AP credit arc en
couraged to take the test as well for
placement purposes. Math place
ment tests last an hour. Take them
on computers in dorm clusters.
Plan to take the test before you
meet with your adviser. Your
score, which you will get as soon as
you finish the test, is personal in
formation that you use strictly to
decide which math class you will
enroll in at Stanford. Check your
()rientation calendar tor times and
locations.

C hemistry: II you want to take
chemistry at Stanford and do not
have Al' eredit or transfer credit,
you should take the online place

ment exam, which also takes about
one hour. Your score is confiden
tial and will be used to place you in
a chemistry course on campus.
Check your Orientation calendar
for times and locations.
Foreign languages: 1 he University
requires all students to achieve
competency in a foreign language
equal to a third quarter, first-year
course. If you have studied a for
eign language and plan to take the
same language at Stanford, you
need to take the placement test to
determine which class to take.
Some students have completed
the written section of the test on
line over the summer. The oral
exam is still required, and times for
these tests are listed in the Orienta
tion guide.
Students that have not taken the
online section should contact the
department of that language.
(): How do I find mv vvav around

campus/
A: An excellent question, since
navigating around an S,ISO-acre
campus where every building looks
vaguely like Taeo Bell can trip up
even those who are handy with a
compass.
First, some words of warning:
Hoover Tower serves as a poor
landmark because it looks the same
from all four sides. Our best advice:
Carry a map with you. and don't be
afraid to ask for directions. We all
did when we were frosh.
O: If I'm having trouble with a
class, can 1 get a tutor?
A: The answer is probably yes. The
Center for Teaching and Learning
gets about 2.000 requests for help
each year and is usually able to ac
commodate them. In addition, the
CTL offers math and chemistry tu
toring. Writing tutors are also
available, but students are encour
aged to try to make appointments
for these.

In addition, many dorms have
tutors, and some departments offer
tutoring for their classes. For tutor
ing information, call the CTL at
723-1326.
Another option is to check the
Community Information Board
near the BASS ticket agency booth
in Tresidder Union. There you can
find people who are willing to tutor
in various subjects, particularly for
eign languages.
Q: How do I add my e-mail ad
dress, phone number and room
number to the directory?
A: You can add information to up
date your file on the online Whois
system by signing into your Axess
account on the World Wide Web.
Once you have logged onto
Axess, go to the "Demographics"
prompt. After editing the appro
priate information, make sure to
update the database. The new in
formation should appear within 24
hours in the directory.
