# The 						many hats of Dean Marc Wais

### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
Marc Wais may have a nine-to
five job ;is clean of. students, but he
says his work as a Junipero resident
fellow keeps him busy twenty-four
hours, seven days a week.
"We live, eat and breathe Stan
ford," he said,
Wais and his wife. Sue, who
works in student affairs, begin their
third year as RFs today at one of
Wilbur's most notorious all-fresh
men dorms.
"We asked specifically to be in an
all-frosh dorm." Wais said, "to see
the students' growth over the years
and to learn from them."
The Wais family includes two
daughters. Ashleigh, 6, and Jen

nifer, 4, who are known as Ju
nipero's "junior RFs." All four
Waises work toward making fresh
man year a memorable one for their
students.
"It's neat to be a part of the fresh
man experience every year," Sue
Wais said. "We get to be involved in
a part of their lives that they will
hold on to forever."
Marc Wais feels that as RFs. he
and Sue have a responsibility to set
an intellectual tone and to be a sup
port system for the students as well
as the staff.
"Everyone here has such an
amazing talent," he said. "We like to
remind students of the reason that
they are here and to explore their
academic and extracurricular aspi
rations. while maintaining personal

health and well-being. They need to
try to create a balance with what
they're doing their freshman year."
Marc and Sue Wais said they are
impressed every year by how driven
Stanford freshmen are.
"It'll be two weeks after school
has started, and students would
be talking to us about law or medical
school." said Marc Wais. "So we
brought in individuals from these
schools to talk to the students at
dorm programs. This benefits the
students, and it allows us to connect
more with faculty members as well.
"I always advise faculty to be
RFs, because it allows you to feel
connected to other faculty and the
students too."
Wilbur promises to be a loud and
boisterous place next year, with the

conversion of two
former four-class
dormitories into
all-freshman
houses this year.
The Waises feel
that including
more freshmen at
Wilbur will only
serve to unify the

individual dormitories even more.
"The [resident assistants] were
commenting that there was a real
sense of Wilbur unity this year, as
opposed to the traditional dorm
separation," Marc Wais said.
"There will still be that dorm pride,
but the Wilbur unity is something
new."


Wais
The Waises enjoy participating
in dorm programming, such as
house meetings and Junipero
events. They hold ice cream socials
lor groups of 15 students at a time,
something that Sue Wais calls "Sun
daes on Mondays."
The brave Waises often set off
for the dining hall to eat with the
students. They also visit students in
the dormitory, an opportunity that
their daughters enjoy.
'They're always asking il they
can go to the dorms." Sue Wais said.
"It's like they have older brothers
and sisters which is something
that the students like too, especially

if they miss younger siblings at
home."
Ashleigh was well-known among
last year's Junipero residents. She
sang a song called "Each of Us Is a
Flower" during "Secret Snowflake"
week.
Ashleigh doesn't mind living
near students more than twice her
age.
"I like to be with the students
and run around and play," she said.
"I like the big space and the cottage,
and there are little kids here that I
can play with too."
Mare Wais notes that the pres
ence of an Rl family can create a
feeling of closeness in a dormitory.
Students often come to borrow
Ashleigh and Jennifer's Disney
videos, he said, and the two i>irls like

to spend time "talking with the big
kids."
"I think it's important to develop
a strong community your freshman
year," Marc Wais said. "It's reas
suring for the students and parents,
I think, to walk in that first day and
see a family. It gives a different fla
vor to a dorm that is something you
might not get at other schools,
where there is not that light net
work between resident fellows and
students, if it is there at all."
"I like to tell students at the be
ginning of the year that this is going
to be their home for the next nine
months," Sue Wais said. "In the be
ginning. of course, they don't be
lieve me, but then ai the end. they're
crying about leaving, and ii really
has become their home."
