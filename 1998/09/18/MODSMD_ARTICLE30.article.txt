Marc Wais may have a nine-to
five job ;is clean of. students, but he
says his work as a Junipero resident
fellow keeps him busy twenty-four
hours, seven days a week.
"We live, eat and breathe Stan
ford," he said,
Wais and his wife. Sue, who
works in student affairs, begin their
third year as RFs today at one of
Wilbur's most notorious all-fresh
men dorms.
"We asked specifically to be in an
all-frosh dorm." Wais said, "to see
the students' growth over the years
and to learn from them."
The Wais family includes two
daughters. Ashleigh, 6, and Jen

nifer, 4, who are known as Ju
nipero's "junior RFs." All four
Waises work toward making fresh
man year a memorable one for their
students.
"It's neat to be a part of the fresh
man experience every year," Sue
Wais said. "We get to be involved in
a part of their lives that they will
hold on to forever."
Marc Wais feels that as RFs. he
and Sue have a responsibility to set
an intellectual tone and to be a sup
port system for the students as well
as the staff.
"Everyone here has such an
amazing talent," he said. "We like to
remind students of the reason that
they are here and to explore their
academic and extracurricular aspi
rations. while maintaining personal

health and well-being. They need to
try to create a balance with what
they're doing their freshman year."
Marc and Sue Wais said they are
impressed every year by how driven
Stanford freshmen are.
"It'll be two weeks after school
has started, and students would
be talking to us about law or medical
school." said Marc Wais. "So we
brought in individuals from these
schools to talk to the students at
dorm programs. This benefits the
students, and it allows us to connect
more with faculty members as well.
"I always advise faculty to be
RFs, because it allows you to feel
connected to other faculty and the
students too."
Wilbur promises to be a loud and
boisterous place next year, with the

conversion of two
former four-class
dormitories into
all-freshman
houses this year.
The Waises feel
that including
more freshmen at
Wilbur will only
serve to unify the

individual dormitories even more.
"The [resident assistants] were
commenting that there was a real
sense of Wilbur unity this year, as
opposed to the traditional dorm
separation," Marc Wais said.
"There will still be that dorm pride,
but the Wilbur unity is something
new."
