# Dateline 1980: Footloose and fancy free
## Life on the Stanford campus in the year the freshmen were born 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
In 1980, your biggest accomplish
ments probably included things like
burping, sitting up and getting your
first tooth. Who could have guessed
that in IS years, you'd be starting a
four-year journey at Stanford?
But a new decade was dawning all
around you. It was a decade best
known for punk rock, leg warmers,
trickle-down economics and the last
gasps of Cold War antagonism. So we
thought wc should give you a little
perspective on what life was like for
Stanford students back then. Sit back
and enjoy the ride through the begin
ning of the decade that produced pop
culture icons galore and glorified
neon hair.
Students in the early '80s were
very aware of the world outside Stan
ford. There was an on-campus group
called "Stanford Against Soviet Ag
gression" and students were vocal
about Afghanistan, the Iranian
hostage crisis and world hunger.
The student body was politically
liberal. Close to 46 percent of stu
dents voted for Jimmy Carter in the
1980 presidential election. But even
more striking was the strong support
for Independent Party candidate
John Anderson, who ran for presi
dent against Carter and Reagan.
Campus life, fashion and musical
trends were also changing in I WO.
That year. Donald Kennedy, now a
professor of biology, became I Iniver

sitv president.
In his soon to-be-publislieil book,
"The Last of Your Springs,"
Kennedy writes. "The academic year
itself was fascinating, intense, and
anything hut peaceful... . There was
double-digit inflation, and budgeting
was even more confusing than usual;
a new administration in Washington
was in place, leading to doubts about
the firmness of federal research sup

port."
()ther changes on campus related
to finances and expansion. The com
bined cost of tuition and room and
board climbed over $I0.(XX) for the
first time and bike theft was a rising
problem. Construction began on a
new housing area called Governor's
Corner. Stanford also revamped its
technology by introducing computer
catologues in libraries.

You can thank the 1980 adminis
tration for the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program. They initiated a
Western Culture requirement that
year that was the precursor of CIV.
And all those long nights of CIV
reading were probably completed in
the newly dedicated east wing of
Green Library.
