# Are Stanford couples extinct?
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
class of 2(M)2 will spend hundreds of
hours preparing for the challenges
that lie ahead over the next four
years. But after all the pomp and
circumstance, the take-home mes
sage is simple:
"Freshmen, welcome to the
Farm, where the winds of freedom
blow, everyone hates the Weenies,
and no one ever dates."
No one disputes the first two
parts of that message. Some — a
minority — try to refute the third
with anecdotes, or by parading
about with their significant others.
The problem, however, is not
imagined. It is sufficiently serious
to merit concern from even the
highest Stanford officials. Address
ing Sophomore College, Stanford's
summer seminars for second-year
students, University President
Gerhard Casper once offered hope
to the romantically disenfran
chised.
"You can make a choice,"
Casper proclaimed. "You can go
out on a date."
Statistics indicate the solution
might be that simple. Herant
Katchadourian, a professor of psy
chiatry, behavioral sciences and
human biology, conducted an in
depth. decade-long study on the
Stanford class of 1981.
Ten percent of his sample set
married another Stanford student.
An additional 10 percent married
someone they met in graduate
school — presumably, for some
portion of the group, also at Stan
ford.
However, statistics offer little
help to those caught on the losing
end — like my freshman room
mate.
Soon after arriving on campus,
my roommate noticed an incredi
bly attractive woman in his Chem
31 class. She was, he relayed, a Pre-

Med Goddess — a PMG.
He could not, however, muster
the chutzpah to ask her out. He
plotted and planned for weeks for
the perfect opportunity to dazzle
her with his witty banter and hope
fully become her lifelong soul
mate. His chance finally came with
our dormitory's annual Screw
Your Roommate dance.
The SYR is the most important
social event for anyone seeking
love. Its name comes from the an
cient fraternity parties where mem
bers set up their friends with the
ugliest women they could find. Al
most every dormitory will hold one
at some point during the year.
Standard SYR procedure goes
something like this: you convince
your roommate to ask out the date
of your choosing, and everyone
pretends it's a blind date, ignoring
the fact you didn't have the
courage to make the date yourself.
I recruited a mutual female
friend to ask the PMG out for my
roommate. While 1 sat in the room,
my friend placed the call on my
speakerphone. The question was
posed. The obligatory pause was
allowed while the PMG and who
ever else happened to be in her
room traded glances and quickly
dove for the freshman face book.
Out of courtesy, my accomplice re
peated my roommate's name and,
in deference to its complexity,
spelled it.
The pause seemed to last forev
er. Finally the PMG drew in an au
dible breath on the other end.
Quickly, but clearly so as not to
confuse the message, she replied:
" I 'msorrybut I havetogooutoftown
thatweekendbye." Silence — and
eventually a dial tone — followed.
"Well," I said after hanging up
the phone, "maybe it's her grand
mother's 9()th birthday."
"Yeah," my accomplice replied,
with a look that did not convincing
ly convey her agreement.
My roommate took the rejec

tion well when I told him, shrug
ging off'the defeat and turning back
to his calculus. But. as I discovered
later, it weighed heavy on his mind.
Later that night, after we had
both gone to bed. he laid staring at
the ceiling. The pressures of class
es, the SYR and other things that I

was never fully aware of pushed
him over a line. Like many other
Stanford students, he admitted his
desperation in a single sentence re
peated every night for the next six
months. Bv his own admission, this

was the most pathetic time of his
life.
"Pat," he whined. "I need a
woman."
I have witnessed too many good
men and women reach this point,
l or my roommate, there were
other PMC is. but none induced the
same enthusiasm.
I )eflated, many victims of Stan
ford's so ;ial environment, such as
my roommate, never seem to re
cover. I'hey drift hopelessly
through lour years of half-hearted
hopes of happiness.
Hut the problem isn't irre
versible. 1 ife, unlike an honors the
sis. goes best without extensive
planning.
My roommate spent his entire
freshman year pining over women
he knew only from afar, but Fate

eventually smiled on him.
Eight days before the end of the
year, he met a woman in the most
informal of settings: our dorm
lobby. Within an hour of their
meeting, this woman appeared at
our door. Before 1 could even po
litely excuse myself, phone num
bers were exchanged and a date
was made.
Despite finals, the two of them
saw each other often and success
fully carried their budding ro
mance into the next year.
It seems that President Casper's
words might well hold the solution
to the dating problem at this uni
versity: let go of your insecurities
and Fate might, just might, smile
upon you.
If it doesn't, you can console
yourself as the rest of us unlucky
souls do. Remember: if you don't
find love in this environment, 1.600
new freshmen arrive one year from
today.
