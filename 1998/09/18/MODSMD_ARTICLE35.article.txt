# Orienting Stanford RAs
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
While most Stanford students de
parted on adventures for Labor Day,
resident assistants returned to Stan
ford for two weeks of intense training
to prepare for the upcoming year.
Residence staff have spent most
of the past week attending informa
tional seminars and preparing their
houses for the onslaught of first-year
students. In frosh and four-class
dorms, staffers memorize the names
of all the students, decorate the
dorms, prepare for initial book dis
cussions and coordinate dorm events
for the first few weeks.
During the weeks before school.
RAs go through a series of training
sessions on a wide array of topics.
These topics include community
building, diversity, conflict resolution
and sexual assualt. Training consists
of a mix of small group sessions with
RAs from similar houses, as well as
lectures, panels and meetings with
residence staff.
Most of the sessions lasted from
8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.
"It's bewildering", said Govind
Dandekar.an RA inJunipero. anall
frosh dorm. "I've never had to soak
up so much information."
This, of course, was the intention.
Ann Porteus, associate director of
Residential Education, worked with
residence deans and other Res Ed
staff over Labor Dav to coordinate

and facilitate RA training.
Although time-consuming and
occasionally tedious, training was a
good experience.
"You get to meet other people
who will be dealing with the same
things as you." said Rachel Wong, a
RAin ZAP. "It brings together peo
ple from communities that don't nor
mally interact: sororities, co-ops, fra
ternities."
According to senior Dijana Elez,
RAin Slavianskii Dom, training was
useful for "organizing the skill sys
tem that you already have and
putting it together."
"RA training shows that Residen
tial Education cares about students,"
said returning R A in Synergy, Barbie
Wong.
Preparation for the arrival of stu
dents was somewhat frustrated bv
Capital Improvement Program con
struction in Lagunita Court and
Cowell Cluster. RAs in those resi
dences will only have a few days to
open their houses.
"It will give us three days to move
in." said Rachel Wong. "It will only
make things more chaotic."
Wong and all other Cowell Clus
ter RAs and house staff will tem
porarily reside in Cedro, awaiting the
completion of the construction.
Ellie Meertz, an RAin the new
Kappa Alpha Theta house, is still ex
cited about moving in, despite the
construction delays. Meertz de
scribed RA training as useful, espe

daily the small group sessions, which
focused on community building and
group dynamics.
The Row RAs trained and lived
together in Xanadu and went on a re
treat to Pajero Dunes. Other houses
also went on retreats to places such as
Calistoga in Napa Valley or the
Santa C rux. Mountains.
RAs were joined by resident com
puter coordinators, head advising as
sociates and ethnic theme associates.
Their training also began early last
week.
Dominic Yu. RC'C in Okada
House in Wilbur, said the training
was going well. But he added that the
training was technical. It consists of
overview lectures by staff from the
Center for leaching and Learning,
returning RCCs and people from
Residential Computing. Topics
range from troubleshooting to deal
ing with irate students who have lost
their room keys.
Yu. a junior majoring in lin
guisities and computer science, says
the training is essentially an exten
sion of C omputer Science 1%, a con
sulting class that all RCCs take.
"There is a big disparity in the
knowledge of RCCs. It's neceesary
to have [training]," said Andy 1 Little,
the RCC in Burbank.
Despite the challenges of setting
up dorms and preparing for students,
most residence staff can't wait for the
day their residents arrive.
"I'm excited!" exclaimed Meertz.
