# Double (or triple) trouble

### Lauren Phillips Elise Lipkowitz Editorial Staff 
Freshman year is the first time
that many students will be living in
almost cell-like quarters with a
roommate. Sharing your space can
be difficult when you're stressed
out. Here's some hints to avoid
coming to blows with your room
mate, especially if you're lucky
enough to be living in a Lag double.
The big picture
• Don't expect your roommate to
be your closest friend. It may turn
out that you love each other, hut be
prepared to have a tun, but not nec
essarily close relationship.
• Talk, talk, talk. Don't let little
tilings build up to a boiling point.

One late night when your printer is
jammed and you have a big paper
due, you're likely to yell at your
roommate for something as silly as
leaving her sweater on your chair.
• Choose your battles wisely. IT it's
really the tapping on the computer
keyboard that bothers you at 3 a.m.,
don't complain about your room
mate's bad taste in music.
• Use common courtesy. Don't
leave leftover dinner on a tray in
your room. Wear headphones if
your roommate is studying, and al
ways write down phone messages.
• C iive each other some personal
space. It's exhausting to be together
all the time, and your room is one of
your only havens on campus.
• Living with someone involves

give and take. Ik* willing to compro
mise.
The small stud
• Settle financial matters early.
Figure how the monthly charges on
your phone hill and the refrigerator
rental and grocery costs will be split.
• Talk about having guests, friends
and study groups over.
• Talk honestly about the hours
that you keep and your living habits.
There's nothing worse than discov
ering you have completely different
concepts of what a "neat" room is.
• If you haven't purchased com
puters and telephones yet. think
about laptops and cordless phones.
They give you freedom and help
with respecting privacy.
