classman confess to their worst
freshman nightmares....
"One night during freshman
year, I was in my boyfriend's room
when someone knocked on the
door.
Since we weren't in the most ap
propriate situation, my boyfriend
decided that if it hail been his room
mate, he would have let himself in
and il il was someone else, we could
I list pretend we weren't in there.
A lew seconds later, the door
opened and my RA walked in. lie
observed the situation, said'()h,you
are in here," turned around and left.
1 could never look the RAin the eye
imam."

While I was running with
the Stanford Band the first
night, a bollard jumped up
and hit me.'

"The Arroyo pool table had a

throw il I'roin the third story bal

honor code to throw a 'two ton* ob

"My freshman year I lived in
I ai kin. < >ne morning, the first week
ol school, the showers were all lull in
I arkin North, so rather than wait
1111'. I dccided to l>.o shower in Larkin
West.
\lter the shower. I went across
the catwalk back to Larkin North
and realized I hadn't brought niv

keys with me. I was wet, wrapped in
my towel with my arms full, knock
ing 011 the door. Ten minutes and
many amused bikers later, someone
finally opened the door for me."
"I went to the Jello party at the
Dckc house, drank a bit too much,
walked home and decided to go
check my post office box.
I barely got my bike unlocked
and managed to get on it, only to go
20 feet down the sidewalk before
swerving into the hedge. I made it
about KM) feet before a cop picked
me up off the ground, got my bike,
scared the |living daylights] out ol
me about the danger of ('alifornia's
Mill (biking under the influence)
laws and then walked me home all
scratched up.
1 found pine needles in my
clothes the next day and everyone in
my dorm ragged on me for weeks."
"While 1 was running with the
Stanford Band the first night, a bol
lard jumped up and hit me."
"We decided to raid .lunipero
one evening, so about 30 freshmen
and some upperclass men from Ar
royo dressed up in black with ban
danas and water pistols and hoses,
and ran over to .lunipero.
I Jpon entering .lunipero, we shot
whoever happened to be in the hall
at the time, including some poor
frosh girl and Marc Wais. ()l course
we were freshman and this was week
two of school, so we didn't know he
was the Dean ol Students. I hat was
a bad move. Wais was pretty pissed,
especially since we ruined the art
mural on the windows."
"A girl got her head locked in a
U-Lock and the police, fire trucks
and ambulances had to come help
her. It was a big scene and we found
out that the jaws of life could not be
used because it might injure by
standers, so a diamond tip saw was
used. It made the Palo Alto paper as
a story reminiscent of 'I l.ove

Lucy.'"
"One word ... DORMCEST!
'Nuff said."
"Spring my frosh year. I pot ex
tremely drunk at the Band's spring
all campus rally. When I came back
to my room. I tossed a bleach bottle
that was in my way across our room,
onto my roommate's futon. 1 lie cap
was loose, so the bleach leaked all
night and burned a 6-inch hole
through his comforter cover."
"I went to Meyer I ibrary for the
first time, ami didn't know that you
had to swipe your card and then go
through the turnstile. I just waltzed
through the 'out' side and all of the
library people yelled at me like I was
trying to sneak in or something."
"At a party in an all-freshman
dorm my frosh year. I was among a
number of underage people in
posession of alcohol. However. I
was the only one swift enough to
greet the cop who busted the party
with a "Hello, officer.' My parents
were most thrilled with the Mil'
(minor in possesion) charge."
"()n the first day of orientation, I
tripped walking up the stairs of my
dorm. Seeing me lying there on the
staircase, another girl stopped to see
il I was okay.
"To my horror, when I entered
my room 20 minutes later. I found
out that she was my roommate, l alk
about t iist impressions!"
"I was at a party my freshman
year and I had had a little too much
to drink. I told my friends I was
going to the bathroom, and when I
had been missing for a half-hour,
they came to find me.
In my drunken stupor. I had
stumbled into the women's re
stroom. instead of the men's. My
friends found me on the floor, asleep
in one of the stalls, hugging the toi
let."
