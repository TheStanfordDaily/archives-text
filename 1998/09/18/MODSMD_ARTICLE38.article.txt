# Who's been sleeping in my bed? Dorm history
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Staff writer 
Welcome to Stanford, and wel
come to your new dormitory — your
home for the next nine months. As
you become acquainted with the
campus, you will discover that there
is a lot of history here. Your dormi
tory has a history of its own.
Here is a brief history of each dor
mitory or house that will be home to
freshmen during this 1998-99 school
year.
Branner Hall
Branner sucks. Period. That's
how everybody feels, unless you ac
tually live there; it is an unofficial
Stanford rule. Branner is the largest
all-frosh dorm on campus, and every
year, the Brannerites are generally
known to be the most boisterous, ob
noxious group of frosh on campus.
Their annoying chants at football
games and their annual disruption of
Gaieties, the Big Game week musi
cal, have annoyed other students for
decades.
However, Branner was not al
ways known for its obnoxiousness.
The dormitory opened in 1924,
named alter John Casper Branner,
Stanford's president from 1913-15.
Originally an all-women's dormito
ry, it changed between all-male and
all-female several times before even
tually becoming one of the first coed
dorms on campus.
When only women lived there,
the urinals in the bathrooms were re
portedly made into flower pots of a
sort.
Recently, Branner has been
home to its "Branner Presents"
speaker series, which brings people
from the campus and beyond to dis
cuss issues and events. The house
also puts out a semi-yearly literary
magazine. Though Branner features
two-room triples today, only two
people originally were to be assigned
to each set of rooms.
Florence Moore llall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall of 1956.
The structure includes seven differ
ent divisions — Alondra, Cardenal,
Faisan, Gavilan, Loro, Mirlo and

Paloma — and cost over $2.65 mil
lion to build. Of that, over $ 1 million
was donated by Florence Moore.
Her husband, Robert Moore, joins
her in having a residence named
after him, a row house called Robert
S. Moore South or, more commonly,
Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it cur
rently is coed. It has been renovated
several times. An improvements
project was completed in 1975 at a
cost of $1.3 million. Housing for
about 100 students was also added in
the 1975 renovation.
Flo Mo may best be known for
two things. First, it houses the only
residential Cultures, Ideas, and Val
ues (CIV) track: Structured Liberal
Education or SLE. Second, ice
cream is served daily in the dining
hall. The often recounted story is
that Florence Moore gave the
money to build the residence on the
condition the dessert be served
every day.
Lagunita Court
This set of dormitories, which
also shares its name with Stanford's
occasionally full artificial lake, was
constructed in 1933. Today it is
home to five different four-class sec
tions: Adelfa, Eucalipto, Granada,
Naranja and Ujamaa.
Occasionally referred to affec
tionately as "the fire trap," Lagunita
has seen at least one major fire in its
history. The resident fellows' apart
ment in West Lagunita burnt down
in November 1974. The fire, which
caused $12,000 in damage, was ruled
to be accidental.
In March of 1976, the Olivo Mag
nolia house, as it was called then,
changed its name to Ujamaa, a
Swahili word meaning "family
hood." Ujamaa is the African-
American ethnic theme dorm.
Koble llall
The oldest active dormitory on
campus, Roble Hall arguably has the
most interesting history of any dorm
on campus.
Roble — which means "oak" in
Spanish — opened in its current lo
cation in 1918 as a women's resi

dence. When it was constructed,
records showed it was built entirely
with reinforced concrete. However,
it was discovered in a 1987 review of
dormitories for earthquake safety
that the records were incorrect.
Alter discovering that the exteri
or walls were made of a hollow clay
tile with a reinforced concrete floor
and frame, Roble was determined to
be the least safe building on campus
in the case of an earthquake.
It was so unsafe, in fact, the Uni
versity decided to close the dormito
ry. On Dec. 19, 1987, it closed its
doors and its residents were relocat
ed when they came back from winter
break. Many of the 294 displaced
students tried to convince the uni
versity to let them stay through the
year, saying they would take their
chances. However, their pleas were
to no avail.

After some discussion Stanford
decided to renovate Roble at a cost
of $7.6 million.
Roble reopened in September
19.59— just weeks before the Loma
Prieta earthquake. Roble survived
the 7.0 earthquake with no serious
damage. Roble remained a popular
residence following the renovation;
it was the most difficult dorm to
draw into in the 1990 housing draw.
However, with the recent renova
tions to other dormitories such as
Florence Moore and Wilbur Hall, its
popularity has decreased sharply in
recent years.
Stern Hall
Lucie Stern Hall, the concrete
block of dormitories located on the
eastern portion of campus, opened
in 1949. The $1.2 million dormitory
was partially built on money given

by "Aunt" Lucie Stern, a Palo Alto
socialite known for her weekly din
ner parties for Stanford students.
A long-time Stanford benefactor
who was made an honorary member
of the student body in 1941 by the
ASSIJ, Stern died away in 1946.
Stern Hall's architectural style
has been much-maligned. Renovat
ed in 1995, Stern now is the color of a
slightly pale pumpkin.
Six different houses are in Stern:
Burbank. Donner, Larkin, Serra,
Twain and Casa Zapata, the C'hi
cano / Latino theme dorm. Stern is
also home to Lucie's Late Night
Pizza, a popular after-hours Stan
ford hangout run by Housing and
Dining Services.
Wilbur Hull
Wilbur Hall, built in 1956, was
named after Rav Lvrnan Wilbur.

Wilbur became Stanford's president
in 1916. He retired as president in
1941. but he actually stayed on until
1943 while a replacement was found.
He also served as the Secretary of
the Interior under U.S. President
Herbert Hoover, a Stanford alum
nus, from 1929 to 1933.
Wilbur has been known as a
perennially unpopular residence.
However, it gained a new life after
renovation in 1993 under the Capital
Improvement Plan, rising in draw
popularity as a result. It consists of
eight houses: Arroyo. Cedro, Ju
nipero. Otero. Rinconada. Soto and
Francos and Okada. the Asian-
American theme house.
A statue of Soto, Leland Stanford
.lr."s dog that used to play in the field
where Wilbur now stands, has been
stolen from the Wilbur house of the
same name numerous times.

However, Branner was not al
ways known for its obnoxiousness.
The dormitory opened in 1924,
named alter John Casper Branner,
Stanford's president from 1913-15.
Originally an all-women's dormito
ry, it changed between all-male and
all-female several times before even
tually becoming one of the first coed
dorms on campus.
When only women lived there,
the urinals in the bathrooms were re
portedly made into flower pots of a
sort.
Recently, Branner has been
home to its "Branner Presents"
speaker series, which brings people
from the campus and beyond to dis
cuss issues and events. The house
also puts out a semi-yearly literary
magazine. Though Branner features
two-room triples today, only two
people originally were to be assigned
to each set of rooms.
Florence Moore llall
Otherwise known as Flo Mo, this
dormitory opened in the fall of 1956.
The structure includes seven differ
ent divisions — Alondra, Cardenal,
Faisan, Gavilan, Loro, Mirlo and

Paloma — and cost over $2.65 mil
lion to build. Of that, over $ 1 million
was donated by Florence Moore.
Her husband, Robert Moore, joins
her in having a residence named
after him, a row house called Robert
S. Moore South or, more commonly,
Bob.
Over the years, Flo Mo has flip
flopped between being an all-male
and an all-female residence; it cur
rently is coed. It has been renovated
several times. An improvements
project was completed in 1975 at a
cost of $1.3 million. Housing for
about 100 students was also added in
the 1975 renovation.
Flo Mo may best be known for
two things. First, it houses the only
residential Cultures, Ideas, and Val
ues (CIV) track: Structured Liberal
Education or SLE. Second, ice
cream is served daily in the dining
hall. The often recounted story is
that Florence Moore gave the
money to build the residence on the
condition the dessert be served
every day.
Lagunita Court
This set of dormitories, which
also shares its name with Stanford's
occasionally full artificial lake, was
constructed in 1933. Today it is
home to five different four-class sec
tions: Adelfa, Eucalipto, Granada,
Naranja and Ujamaa.
Occasionally referred to affec
tionately as "the fire trap," Lagunita
has seen at least one major fire in its
history. The resident fellows' apart
ment in West Lagunita burnt down
in November 1974. The fire, which
caused $12,000 in damage, was ruled
to be accidental.
In March of 1976, the Olivo Mag
nolia house, as it was called then,
changed its name to Ujamaa, a
Swahili word meaning "family
hood." Ujamaa is the African-
American ethnic theme dorm.
Koble llall
The oldest active dormitory on
campus, Roble Hall arguably has the
most interesting history of any dorm
on campus.
Roble — which means "oak" in
Spanish — opened in its current lo
cation in 1918 as a women's resi

dence. When it was constructed,
records showed it was built entirely
with reinforced concrete. However,
it was discovered in a 1987 review of
dormitories for earthquake safety
that the records were incorrect.
Alter discovering that the exteri
or walls were made of a hollow clay
tile with a reinforced concrete floor
and frame, Roble was determined to
be the least safe building on campus
in the case of an earthquake.
It was so unsafe, in fact, the Uni
versity decided to close the dormito
ry. On Dec. 19, 1987, it closed its
doors and its residents were relocat
ed when they came back from winter
break. Many of the 294 displaced
students tried to convince the uni
versity to let them stay through the
year, saying they would take their
chances. However, their pleas were
to no avail.

After some discussion Stanford
decided to renovate Roble at a cost
of $7.6 million.
Roble reopened in September
19.59— just weeks before the Loma
Prieta earthquake. Roble survived
the 7.0 earthquake with no serious
damage. Roble remained a popular
residence following the renovation;
it was the most difficult dorm to
draw into in the 1990 housing draw.
However, with the recent renova
tions to other dormitories such as
Florence Moore and Wilbur Hall, its
popularity has decreased sharply in
recent years.
Stern Hall
Lucie Stern Hall, the concrete
block of dormitories located on the
eastern portion of campus, opened
in 1949. The $1.2 million dormitory
was partially built on money given

by "Aunt" Lucie Stern, a Palo Alto
socialite known for her weekly din
ner parties for Stanford students.
A long-time Stanford benefactor
who was made an honorary member
of the student body in 1941 by the
ASSIJ, Stern died away in 1946.
Stern Hall's architectural style
has been much-maligned. Renovat
ed in 1995, Stern now is the color of a
slightly pale pumpkin.
Six different houses are in Stern:
Burbank. Donner, Larkin, Serra,
Twain and Casa Zapata, the C'hi
cano / Latino theme dorm. Stern is
also home to Lucie's Late Night
Pizza, a popular after-hours Stan
ford hangout run by Housing and
Dining Services.
Wilbur Hull
Wilbur Hall, built in 1956, was
named after Rav Lvrnan Wilbur.

Wilbur became Stanford's president
in 1916. He retired as president in
1941. but he actually stayed on until
1943 while a replacement was found.
He also served as the Secretary of
the Interior under U.S. President
Herbert Hoover, a Stanford alum
nus, from 1929 to 1933.
Wilbur has been known as a
perennially unpopular residence.
However, it gained a new life after
renovation in 1993 under the Capital
Improvement Plan, rising in draw
popularity as a result. It consists of
eight houses: Arroyo. Cedro, Ju
nipero. Otero. Rinconada. Soto and
Francos and Okada. the Asian-
American theme house.
A statue of Soto, Leland Stanford
.lr."s dog that used to play in the field
where Wilbur now stands, has been
stolen from the Wilbur house of the
same name numerous times.
