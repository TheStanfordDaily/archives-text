# Transfers taste it again for the first time

You know the drill: late-night
cramming, too much pizza, office
hours and balancing extra eurricu
lars and classwork. But you still
don't know your way around cam
pus, exactly what RCC refers to or
when to jump when the Band plays
"All Right Now."
Relax, you've already mastered
the toughest part. In the coming
weeks you'll be taking a crash course
in life on the Farm, but you'll soon
realize that what you've learned at
another college is applicable here.

You came here for a reason; you
knew that there was something
about your last institution that
wasn't quite right. And Stanford will
welcome youbeeause you're here to
add something valuable to the com
munity.
As you go through the transition,
Stanford has resources to assist the
fundamentally different needs of
transfers. Although you may have to
seek them out, the Undergraduate
Advising Center, departmental ad
visors and your fellow upperclass
men can provide helpful academic
guidance. And consider yourself
lucky; after having done another
round of college applications, you've

thought critically about what you
want out of your education and
about how Stanford can help you
achieve your goals.
lake your knowledge of your ca
pabilities and talents and apply them
here. You have less time on campus
than your classmates, and you don't
have to hang back, (let involved as
soon as possible; it's remarkable
how much our transfer classmates
have accomplished here in such a
short period of lime.
Try to use the upcoming transfer
orientation activities as a chance to
get to know the other members of
the transfer class of 1998. They're
coming from all over the world and

from all kinds of educational institu
tions. Some have even spent some
time out in the real world. The vari
ety of their experiences make them
an interesting bunch to get to know.
Plus, it's fun to sit around and bash
your former alma mater.
As a transfer, you may be re
minded of the centrality of the fresh
man experience to Stanford life.
People talk about their freshman
dorms with a cultish passion and can
still tell von the middle names of
every person in their CIV section.
But although you've missed this, get
ting involved is a great way to feel
that you have a stake in the school
and to make this campus your own.

You may discover that you ap
preciate this place more than other
students you meet. Spending years
at another school gives you a more
critical perspective on Stanford's
strengths and weaknesses. Every
Stanford experience is different, and
even if you had been here for all four
years, your experience wouldn't be
identical to the that of the person
next to you at Stanford Stadium on
graduation day.
Next year, when you return to
campus, hopefully you'll feel that
Stanford is yours. And maybe some
day you too will have to pause and
think when someone asks you what
freshman dorm you lived in.
