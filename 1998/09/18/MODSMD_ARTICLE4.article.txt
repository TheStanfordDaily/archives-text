The Stanford in Moscow program was suspended
last Friday in the wake of the August ruble crisis and
accompanying political turmoil in Russia.
The decision stems from concerns over the avail
ability of cash and the highly unstable exchange rate,
said Director of the Overseas Studies

Program Professor Russell Berman.
"Anyone who has read the papers
knows about the instability of the
ruble. In that context, it becomes dif
ficult for us to do business. We're
going to wait and see how conditions
unfold," said Berman.
"In running an overseas campus,
we have bills to pay. When the value

of the currency is unclear and access to cash not guar
anteed, we face difficulties. It is wise to be cautious."
he said.
Recent political stabilization has not assuaged the
cautious tone of Overseas Studies. Although a govt
ernment under new Prime Minister Yevgeny Pri
makov was recently formed, concerns persist over tH
security of financial transactions, Berman said.
According to an article in the Sept. 11 Chronicle of
Higher Education, no other school has suspended its
program in Russia. According to the article, universif
ties instead have warned students to exercise extnj
caution and to carry more hard currency.
"I'm very hopeful that the situation in Moscow pro
ceeds smoothly. However, having students carrying a
lot of cash puts them in jeopardy," Berman said.
