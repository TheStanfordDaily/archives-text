# Moscow program on hold

The Stanford in Moscow program was suspended
last Friday in the wake of the August ruble crisis and
accompanying political turmoil in Russia.
The decision stems from concerns over the avail
ability of cash and the highly unstable exchange rate,
said Director of the Overseas Studies

Program Professor Russell Berman.
"Anyone who has read the papers
knows about the instability of the
ruble. In that context, it becomes dif
ficult for us to do business. We're
going to wait and see how conditions
unfold," said Berman.
"In running an overseas campus,
we have bills to pay. When the value

of the currency is unclear and access to cash not guar
anteed, we face difficulties. It is wise to be cautious."
he said.
Recent political stabilization has not assuaged the
cautious tone of Overseas Studies. Although a govt
ernment under new Prime Minister Yevgeny Pri
makov was recently formed, concerns persist over tH
security of financial transactions, Berman said.
According to an article in the Sept. 11 Chronicle of
Higher Education, no other school has suspended its
program in Russia. According to the article, universif
ties instead have warned students to exercise extnj
caution and to carry more hard currency.
"I'm very hopeful that the situation in Moscow pro
ceeds smoothly. However, having students carrying a
lot of cash puts them in jeopardy," Berman said.

Junior Woo-jin Park, who stud
ied intensive Russian in Moscow
this summer and would have re
mained there in the fall, said he
was surprised to hear of the deci
sion to suspend the program.
"When we first heard the news,
we were all shocked. We couldn't
believe what was going on ... be
cause everything seemed to be sta
bilizing, and to be quite honest, the
problems don't really affect us as
students," he said.
"We don't have to worry about
food, we don't have to worry about
money, and I don't know how
much the political crisis was affect
ing us. It was sad for all of us be
cause it felt like we were just be
ginning to feel comfortable here
[in Moscow)," Park said.
"Within three weeks, we had
learned some Russian, learned to
ride the metro without a problem,
and felt we could live the Moscow
life more easily, so it was frustrat
ing to hear the news [of cancella
tion]."
Junior Miles Townes, who was
planning on studying in Moscow
this fall, said he "half-expected"
the suspension of the program.
"I had been watching the news
since the ruble crisis began, and I
was waiting to hear what the Stan
ford program would say," Townes
said.
"My understanding is that the
decision to suspend the program
was related to financing. 1 think it
was a good decision. If they —
they being those who run the pro
gram — think it's necessary, then
it's fine with me," he said.
Berman said that the nine stu
dents planning on studying in
Moscow this fall, in addition to the
seven students already there
studying intensive Russian over
the summer, have been offered the

opportunity to study at other over
seas campuses or to return to the
home campus.
"We've had numerous requests
to go to other overseas campuses.
We're trying to ensure Russian in
struction. We're sending the Direc
tor of the Moscow Program
(Maxim Braterski] to Berlin to
allow him to teach Russian there, to
ensure some continuity [for those
studying Russian]." Berman said.
Park opted to study in Berlin
for the fall, despite not having
taken any German. "I picked
Berlin since they offered it to us
and... we didn't need to know Ger
man," he said. "I personally want
to learn a new language, [which
was) one of the main reasons for
going overseas."
Instead of opting to study at a
different overseas campus,
Townes said he plans on fulfilling
the overseas study requirement for
the International Relations major
by eventually studying in Russia.
"I hope I'm able to go [in the fu
ture]. But it's a feat of prognostica
tion that I am unable to perform to
say whether or not I'll get to go,"
Townes said.
" The program is supposed to
start back up in autumn of '99. I've
been taking Russian for one and a
half years, and I'm kind of juicing
up for this trip. But I'll be back on
Stanford's campus this fall," he
said.
"The program in Moscow has
been enormously successful. I look
forward to it's reopening in the
near future," Berman said.
Faced with what seems to be an
endemic housing crunch at Stan
ford. some worry that finding
housing for the students who
choose to return to the home cam
pus may be problematic.
Berman, however, said that
Overseas Studies has received "ex
tensive cooperation from both
Housing Services and Financial
Aid."
