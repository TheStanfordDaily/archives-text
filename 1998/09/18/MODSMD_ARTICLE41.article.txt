# Lock your bike: Stanford safety
## 
### Frank Guinan Staff writer 
Greetings from cheery resident
assistants, helping hands from smil
ing Orientation volunteers and intro
ductions to hundreds of new, light
hearted faces. Stanford seems like a
pretty secure place to many new stu
dents.
In making the transition to cam
pus life, however, freshmen and
transfer students often become over
ly trusting and rather careless during
their first few days on the Farm.
And why shouldn't they? In a re
cent study of 58 schools called
"Crime at College: the Student
Guide to Public Safety," Stanford
was ranked one of the 15 safest cam
puses in the nation.
But don't be fooled. Crime does
occur here on the Farm â€” and the at
mosphere of Orientation can be the
ideal time for crooks to make their
mark.
In most cases, however, simple
precautionary measures can help
deter theft from ruining a good first
year.
Lock up that bike
For the past decade and a half, the
number one reported crime on cam
pus has been bicycle theft. In 1997
319 bikes were reported stolen, and
in the first seven months of 1998,203
bikes have been reported stolen.
But Stanford Police speculate the
actual number of thefts is twice that
number, because many do not both
er to report their stolen bikes.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said his office is trying to
decrease bike thefts on campus. Bike
thieves "just come out of the wood
work," he said.
To avoid becoming one of the
many unfortunate victims, Niemeyer
advises students to lock up their bicy
cles. Although U-locks are the most

effective locking devices, he also rec
ommends getting "Bad Bones,"
which span the length of the lock and
can make it five times stronger.
Thieves "tend to stay away from
bikes with that device on it,"he said.
Niemeyer also added that there is
little value in locking a bike to itself,
since thieves can just "toss the bike
onto a truck and go." He recom
mends locking bikes to an immov
able object, such as a bicycle rack or
post.
Most of the bikes recovered are
high-quality mountain bikes, accord
ing to Niemeyer. Obviously, he said,
the better the quality of the bike, the
higher the likelihood that it will get
stolen.
In recent years the Stanford Po
lice have worked to be more visible
and catch more bike thieves,
Niemeyer said. He also urges every
one to register his or her bike with
the police because "without a victim,
we can't prosecute [a thief]."
Daniel Smith, special services
manager at the Department of Pub
lic Safety, echoed Niemeyer's urge to
register bikes.
"It's not unusual for the police to
catch a thief but have no victim," he
said.
Smith added that bike registra
tion will continue to be easy this year:
This week only, for a fee of $3.50, stu
dents can register their bikes with the
Transportation Programs office in
front of Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
In addition, California state law
mandates that anyone under 1S wear
a helmet when riding a bike. The law
also "strongly encourages" those IX
years and older to wear a helmet, and
bike lights are required for those rid
ing at night.
Dorm room safety
Dorm residents are supposed to
lock their dormitories after mid
night. This does not always happen.

however, since students come and go
all night long. Many students prop
the door open as they make their
late-night and early-morning rounds.
Fortunately, burglars do not usu
ally try their luck in the dormitories
after midnight. Instead, many know
when students won't be in and hit the
dorms while most students are at
lunch, dinner or in the shower.
"All it takes is for [burglars] to
walk down the hall and try one of the
doors," Niemeyer said.
In 1997, there were 202 reported
cases of structural burglary, and 90
cases have been reported in the first
half of this year. In 1997, there was
only 1 case of robbery, but already in
199K, 4 cases have been reported.
Niemeyer said there is a simple
solution to keep from becoming a

statistic: Keep doors locked whenev
er rooms are empty, even if it will be
for a short period of time.
In addition, 35 cases of vehicle
burglary were reported in 1997.
According to Stanford Police, this
time of year is notorious for vehicle
burglary since there are so many stu
dents moving things into their new
residences.
Concerns about assault
Compared to property crime,
"body crime," such as aggravated
and sexual assault, is relatively rare
on 'he Stanford campus.
During 1997, 2 cases of aggravat
ed assault and 14 cases of forcible sex
offenses were reported to police and
counselors. Sexual assaults, also
known as acquaintance or date rape.

often involve alcohol, Niemeyer
said.
The Department of Public Safety
strongly recommends using routes
highlighted on the Suggested Travel
Routes Map (see page 17B). Al
though they may not be the shortest
distance between two points, the
routes are well traveled, adequately
lighted and located in open-space
areas.
SURE Escort Service is also
available and will accompany stu
dents by motorized cart anywhere
on campus. Students can contact
the free service by calling 725-
SURE.
Perhaps the most important
crime-busting tip is personal aware
ness and responsibility. If a situa
tion feels suspicious or threatening.

change directions, go to a populat
ed area, call a friend to meet you or
call 9-911 from a campus phone or
911 from an off-campus phone.
If you are the victim of a crime,
call the police immediately; when a
crime goes unreported, a criminal
may attack again. Also make sure
to report any suspicious persons,
vehicles or activities to the police.
To help those who have been
sexually assaulted, the Sexual As
sault Resource Center located in
Cowell Student Health Center is
open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Friday for information and
counseling. In addition the Campus
Sexual Assault and Recovery Team
is available 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (also
in Cowell) and operates 24-hour
crisis services.

Bicycle theft is the most frequent campus crime. U-Locks greatly reduce the chance of theft.
