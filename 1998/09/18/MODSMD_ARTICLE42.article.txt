# Farm talk: Stanfordese
## The
						definitive guide to campus communication 
### Jimmy Boegle Staff writer 
Unbeknownst to everybody
from the outside world. Stanford
students ;ill speak a different lan
guage. Soon, you will be speaking
this language, too.
The language is called Stan
fordese. Basically, it consists of tak
ing two or more words and making
them into catchy little rhythmic
smaller words.
You may ask. "Why is this?"
The answer: We don't know. We
just do it. All of us.
Here is a short Stanfordese-
English dictionary to get you
through the next few days. You
may want to carry it around with
you.
Co Ho: The Coffee House. A
traditional Stanford hangout in
Tresidder Union that serves food
and drinks such ;is coffee and san
wiches.
Co I'o: The Corner Pocket. An
other traditional Stanford hang out
in Tresidder that serves pizza,
smoothies and fro yo (see below).
I lowever. they do not sell pockets.

Dink: Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
I he auditorium located across
from the Co Ho.
Flo Mo: Florence Moore Hall.
A big dormitory located just off of
t he Row. named after a woman
named Florence Moore. She gave
Stanford lots of money.
Fro Yo: Frozen Yogurt. Served
at the Co Po. A substitute for ice
cream. Many Californians are
scared of ice cream because it has
fat in it: thus, they eat fro yo.
Mem Aud: Memorial Auditori
um. An auditorium located across
from Hoover Power. They show
Flicks there every Sunday night.
Flicks are cheap movies with paper
lights included.
Mem Chu: Memorial Church. A
non-denominational church locat
ed in the Quad.
MuFulJnSun: Music and Fun
I Jnder the Sun. An event that hap
pens during the first week back to
campus involving music and fun.
Pro Fro: Prospective Freshman.
You were one of these once. The
official term is now "admits." This
term is disliked by most students,
as there is no potential Stanfordese

word for it. If you host a pro fro,
you are a pro fro ho. If you coordi
nate the dorm's pro fro ho group,
you are a pro fro hi) do co. Whoa.
Res Comp: Residential Com
puting. The people who put the
computers in your dorms and take
care of them. Usually.
Res Ed: Residential Education.
The people who put on many pro
grams in your dormitories all year.
No relation to the horse. Mr. Ed.
I res Ex: Tresidder Express. The
on-campus store, located in Tresid
der. They sell Cheetos, deodorant
and other tasty things.
That should be enough to get
you through the first few weeks. To
test your knowledge, look at the
following paragraph:
My pro fro ho stopped at the Co
Po to get a fro yo on her way back
from MuFulJnSun. She ran into a
friend that worked for Res Comp
in a building between the Co Ho
and Dink.
If this made sense, congratula
tions! And if you realized that
there is no building between the Co
Ho and Dink, you're way ahead of
the game.
