# Escaping Stanford: life just off campus
## 
### Kelly Young Senior staff writer 
When you've eaten enough Polio's bar
beque burritos to make you yak or when
the Bookstore doesn't have tie-dyed trash
cans in stock, it's time to journey into the
forbidden land: off campus.
A variety of shopping and dining op
tions awaits you in the yuppie villages of
the South Peninsula, including reasonably
and not-so-reasonably priced restauraunts
and even (gasp) discount department
stores.
Luckily for most freshmen, you don't
have to be stranded if you don't have a car.
This guide will tell you where to be seen off
campus, where to get that Super Soaker
for those vicious games of Assassin, and
where to eat with your parents when they
come to visit.
For those back-to-school essentials
that got lost in shipping. Target in Red
wood City is probably your best bet. 1 112 you
head left down El Camino, you eventually
hit it right after the adult bookstore. Un
fortunately, it's too far away for biking.
If you take a right onto El Camino,

however, you'll come across a couple of
discount department stores near the inter
section at San Antonio Road. Several
buses run down El Camino that might be
worth checking out.
You'll also find Fry's Electronics close
to campus. Turn right on El Camino and
make a left when you see their enormous
sign. This discount electronics store is
huge, so don't go there in a mad dash be
fore finals.
Safeway grocery store is a bike ride
across the Palo Alto border into Menlo
Park on El Camino for staples like coffee,
ramen and more coffee. There's also the
"Secret Safeway," but if we told you where
it was. then it wouldn't be so secret, would
it?
When you're ready for a break from
shopping, take a trip to downtown Palo
Alto's Peninsula Creamery Fountain.
Those in the know just call it"the Cream
ery." It's a 50's-style diner complete with a
jukebox and extra-thick milkshakes.
When you no linger look forward to
Wilbur weekend brunches, you still have
plenty of choices. Hobee's, located on El
Camino. is a great California chain. Their

butter-topped blueberry coffee cake is a
meal in itself. You can bike there, but you
might need to towel off before you eat.
California Avenue is one of Palo Alto
s hidden gems. It's not as chic as Universi
ty Avenue, but it is less crowded. Among
the cute establishments lining this street is
Joanie's Cafe. This cozy restaurant serves
superb weekend brunches. If you're in a
bagel mood, schlep down to Izzv's or
Noah's Kagels. also on California. (Noah's
has a location on University Avenue too).
While you're there, you should pop
into Printer's Inc.. a bookstore/cafe
swarming with Stanford students and pro
fessors. It's open until 11 p.m. on week
days and midnight on weekends, late for
Palo Alto standards. While you're sipping
your macchiato at one of their outdoor ta
bles, you're likely to see many teeny-bop
pers walking past. They're trekking to The
Edge, Palo Alto's 18-and-over nightclub
down the street. The Marguerite will take
you to California Avenue, but only on
weekdays.
For late-night munchies, Stanford stu
dents go further south on El Camino to

Lyon's, Denny's or Happy Donuts. The
coffee's not great, but does anything taste
good at 4 a.m.? Keep your eyes peeled —
you'll probably see those elusive Daily ed
itors and ASSU politicos sampling the cui
sine of these grease havens.
When your chocolate craving must be
satisfied. Max's Opera Cafe in the Stan
ford Shopping Center and Just Desserts in
downtown Palo Alto are lifesavers.
Stanford's surroundings also offer nu
merous choices for world cuisine. Ming's
on Embarcadero serves up good Chinese
food. It's a bit pricey, but worth the drive
for special occasions. II Fornaio is another
place that's good for parentally funded
dinners. It's just off University on Cowper
in Palo Alto.
For cheaper options, try Mexican at
Chili' s or Chevy's. Both are north on El
Camino.
Feel free to heed our advice, but don't
rely on our words of wisdom. Dare to ven
ture out on your own — car or no car. Ask
about Castro Street. See what the City has
to offer. Above all. for the sake of your
sanity, get off campus!
