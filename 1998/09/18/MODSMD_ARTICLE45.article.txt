# Help your kids from miles away
## Parents' seminar 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
During Orientation, parents
may feel like they exist solely to
chauffeur freshmen to and from
Wal-Mart. But rest assured. Even if
we don't seem to appreciate you for
carrying our futons up three flights
of stairs in 90-degree heat, we do.
It's just that the first days of school
are so overwhelming and exciting
that no matter our intentions, we
downplay our gratitude.
Orientation is a frantic time
when we to get to know our class
mates and become acquainted with
life on the Farm. It's important.
After all, these people will be our
surrogate family for the next four
vears and campus will soon feel like
our home away from home.
We know that sooner or later,
you'll be leaving us here, and we'll
have to manage on our own. We'll
have to do our own laundry, secure
our own food and struggle through
linals without you here. We'll have
no parents to complain to. We'll
have to share our successes with
you over the phone or e-mail.
lo reassure ourselves that we're
capable of this sort of indepen
dence, we pretend we don't really
need you even now, when you're
here only to help us out.
Hut we still care about you. So
here are some ways that you can
stay involved in your son's or
daughter's Stanford life. Numerous
organizations exist to help parents
keep in touch, even from 3.000
miles away.
