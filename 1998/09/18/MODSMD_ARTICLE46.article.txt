# Miller time? Stanford and alcohol
## 
### Tracy Jan Hussein Kanji Editorial staff 
Students arriving on campus this
week will find that Stanford offers
nearly limitless opportunities — in
cluding the chance to get drunk.
While the University prohibits
the illegal use, possession and distri
bution of alcohol on campus, it has
traditionally shied away from strict
enforcement of this policy.
Controversy in recent history re
sulted in the formation of an alcohol
task force last year composed of stu
dents, faculty and administrators.
"In my mind, the policy really
hasn't changed much." said Dean of
Students Marc Wais. "We empha
size the educational aspect along
with the clear notice that Stanford is
not the sanctuary from the law."
The policy states, " The Universi
ty, as an educational institution, ap
proaches student conduct issues
from a perspective that places em
phasis i)n individual responsibility
and development. Education about
and prevention of alcohol and other
drug-related problems will continue
to be the primary emphasis and
goal."
In addition, student groups are
not required to inform the Office of
Student Activities before hosting a
party. I lowever, prior notification is
strongly recommended to ensure
public safety, depending on the scale
of the party.
Rather than opting for a "police
state" college atmosphere — where
residence staff enforce campus poli
cy — the University has typically re
lied on a "safety net" approach, with
resident assistants and resident fel
lows providing counseling and infor

mation to students.
The University's alcohol policy is
explicit in its prohibition of alcohol
consumption by minors. Although
the residence staff is not directly re
sponsible for enforcing the alcohol
policy, it is expected to build a
healthy community and reduce the
risk of problems by offering party
planning advice and educational
programming.
Similarly, residence staff is ex
pected to comply with the Universi
ty's Alcohol and Other Drugs policy
themselves. Serving alcohol to mi
nors or using dorm funds to purchase
alcohol for minors are violations of
the policy.
Other violations of the policy in
clude residence staff purchasing al
cohol for underage students and or
ganizing keg parties in all-frosh dor
mitories.
Although party planners can be
held liable for underage drinking
under California law, parties on cam
pus have been known to serve to mi
nors.
I Jnder party-planning guidelines,
planners must comply with all Uni
versity policies, attend a party-plan
ning workshop and turn in all off
campus advertising to the OSA for
review prior to its use.
Although educational and reha
bilitative measures are the preferred
response to infractions, students who
violate the policy risk losing Univer
sity housing, being barred from stu
dent organizations and are subject to
the Student Judicial Process.
Residence staff provides support
for problems with alcohol abuse to
all students, referring them to coun
seling programs on campus and in
the community.
