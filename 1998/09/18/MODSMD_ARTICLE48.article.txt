## Shaky start has Cardinal on its Heels 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Things can't be easy for Tyrone Willing
ham. An upset loss to San Jose State and a
fundamentally poor showing against Ari
zona has the team off to an 0-2 start and some
fans grumbling that Stanford may not house
the Axe much longer.
But Stanford's head football coach and
his team are far from throwing in the towel.
The team has been stressing its improve
ments thus far and can turn things around —
at least partially — when North Carolina vis
its Stanford Stadium tomorrow.
The Tar Heels (0-1) have problems of
their own. They plummeted out of the top 25
from the No. 13 spot after being upset by
Miami (Ohio) two weeks ago. Last week's
bve has allowed UNC coach Carl Torbush to

regroup his team and prepare for the Cardi
nal tomorrow.
"We've had a chance to correct a lot of the
mistakes that we made last week," Torbush
said. "We have a lot of ways to go and a lot of
corrections to make. There's a chance that
[backup quarterback Oscar Davenport] will
play this week if we need him.
Starting quarterback Ronald Curry "is an
outstanding athlete and an outstanding quar
terback. He's got great athletic skills and
great composure," Torbush said.
North Carolina has consensus All-Amer
ican cornerback Dre' Bly, which doesn't
bode well for a Cardinal team still missing its
top receiver. Redshirt junior flanker Troy
Walters went out of last week's game with a
badly sprained right ankle and won't play to
morrow.
With Walters out. Bly will be free to cover

Dave Davis, who impressed many last week
and has three of the Cardinal's five touch
down receptions. This means redshirt junior
Deßonnie Pitts and redshirt sophomore
Tafiti Uso can expect to get a lot of looks.
"You have to have some regulation or
limit as to what you throw at" Bly, Willing
ham said. "They bring so much one-on-one
ability that allows a young man like Mr. Bly
to do what he does."
The Tar Heels will be giving freshman
Curry his first start at quarterback after he
came in two weeks ago for injured senior
Davenport.
Curry, a blue-chip recruit in both football
and basketball, completed 11 of 22 passes
with a touchdown against the Red Hawks.
Though Curry has won the starting job for

now. Torbush expects to have Dav
enport ready to come in at any time.
"We think (Curry's) an excellent
athlete," Willingham said. "In some
regards he's like Davenport. He's got
a great arm and the ability to hurt you
with his speed."
Stanford on the other hand re
turns only eight starters from last
year's 5-6 squad, and experience is
becoming a valuable commodity.
With former quarterback Chad
Hutchinson now playing for the St.
Louis Cardinal organization, the
biggest decision that needed to be
made was who would take the helm

of the Stanford offense.
Redshirt junior Todd Husak has
won the starting job. with redshirt
freshmen Joe Borchard and Randy
Fasani vying for the backup spot.
Husak has thrown for 572 yards
and five touchdowns in his first two
games, but has also been picked off
three times. He has won Willing
ham's confidence as the No. 1 quar
terback and has shown improvement
between his first two outings.
The main offensive problem the
Cardinal has is on the ground. Juan-
Carlos Lacey is the only back with
any college-game experience before
this season. 1 le and redshirt freshman
Coy Wire are the main contenders
for the starting spot, but Wire will
most likely take the spot tomorrow if

he remains healthy.
The offensive line is strong with
four returning starters and they've
kept Husak relatively safe this sea
son. But they haven't been able to
open many holes for the backs.
The Cardinal's biggest star should
be Walters, who holds the school's
single-season reception record.
Davis will have to pick up the slack
until Walters returns, and Pitts and
Uso have also stepped up.
"In general terms, anytime you
lose a player of that caliber, it really
takes away from your offense and
productivity," Willingham said.
"We're pleased with the perfor
mance of Deßonnie and the play of
Davis. It's wonderful to see Deßon
nie step up and also see Davis make

the plays that he made."
On defense, where only three
starters return, the Cardinal has some
bigger problems. The inexperience in
game situations is readily seen in the
tackling problems the Cardinal has
had over the first two games.
Missing first tackle opportunities
has allowed opposing quarterbacks
extra time to get off passes, and run
ning backs have been able to pick up
critical extra yardage.
With redshirt sophomore Tim
Smith healthy this year and redshirt
juniors Chris Johnson and Frank
Primus back in the corners, the Car
dinal should be able to prevent too
much damage through the air — if
the line can pressure the quarterback
a little.
