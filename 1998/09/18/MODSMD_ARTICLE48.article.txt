## Shaky start has Cardinal on its Heels 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Things can't be easy for Tyrone Willing
ham. An upset loss to San Jose State and a
fundamentally poor showing against Ari
zona has the team off to an 0-2 start and some
fans grumbling that Stanford may not house
the Axe much longer.
But Stanford's head football coach and
his team are far from throwing in the towel.
The team has been stressing its improve
ments thus far and can turn things around —
at least partially — when North Carolina vis
its Stanford Stadium tomorrow.
The Tar Heels (0-1) have problems of
their own. They plummeted out of the top 25
from the No. 13 spot after being upset by
Miami (Ohio) two weeks ago. Last week's
bve has allowed UNC coach Carl Torbush to

regroup his team and prepare for the Cardi
nal tomorrow.
"We've had a chance to correct a lot of the
mistakes that we made last week," Torbush
said. "We have a lot of ways to go and a lot of
corrections to make. There's a chance that
[backup quarterback Oscar Davenport] will
play this week if we need him.
Starting quarterback Ronald Curry "is an
outstanding athlete and an outstanding quar
terback. He's got great athletic skills and
great composure," Torbush said.
North Carolina has consensus All-Amer
ican cornerback Dre' Bly, which doesn't
bode well for a Cardinal team still missing its
top receiver. Redshirt junior flanker Troy
Walters went out of last week's game with a
badly sprained right ankle and won't play to
morrow.
With Walters out. Bly will be free to cover

Dave Davis, who impressed many last week
and has three of the Cardinal's five touch
down receptions. This means redshirt junior
Deßonnie Pitts and redshirt sophomore
Tafiti Uso can expect to get a lot of looks.
"You have to have some regulation or
limit as to what you throw at" Bly, Willing
ham said. "They bring so much one-on-one
ability that allows a young man like Mr. Bly
to do what he does."
The Tar Heels will be giving freshman
Curry his first start at quarterback after he
came in two weeks ago for injured senior
Davenport.
Curry, a blue-chip recruit in both football
and basketball, completed 11 of 22 passes
with a touchdown against the Red Hawks.

Redshirt junior quarterback Todd Husak barely gets the pass off in last Saturday's
31-14 loss to Arizona. Husak has retained his starting position, and redshirt fresh
man Joe Borchard and Randy Fasani will share backup duties.
