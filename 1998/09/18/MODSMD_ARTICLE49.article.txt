# Wildcats drop Stanford to 0-2

### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
The youth movement has been having its
problems.
The Cardinal football team (0-2, 0-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference), which returns only eight
starters on either side of the ball, again
showed it has some things to work on in a 31-
14 loss to Arizona last Saturday.
Missed tackles and blocks, mental errors
leading to penalties and the failure to capi
talize on Arizona's (2-0,1-0) missed oppor
tunities left Stanford at a loss in a confer
ence opener played in front of the smallest
Stanford Stadium crowd since 1991.
"There were two very common threads"
between last week's loss to Arizona and the
Sept. 5 loss to San Jose State, said Cardinal
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "One was a
lack of tackling. We were not successful in
doing that, stopping them early or stopping a
play completely. And the other was penal
ties."
The main benefactor from the Cardinal's
tackling problems was Wildcat running back
Trung Canidate. The redshirt junior spent his
season debut bouncing off of Cardinal de
fenders as he racked up tons of extra yardage
and finished the day with 110 yards on 21 car
ries.
"1 was a little bit rustv out there, but the

offensive line made it easy for me," Canidate
said. "All I wanted to do was run the ball and
do what the team wanted me to do. We knew
it would be a physical game, but the offen
sive line gave me some big holes to run
through."
Arizona's quarterback platoon of redshirt
junior Keith Smith and redshirt sophomore
Ortege Jenkins combined for 16-of-28 pass
ing for 288 yards and two touchdowns. Junior
wide receiver Dennis Northcutt worked past
the Stanford secondary for 160 yards on five
catches.
To make matters worse, redshirt junior
Troy Walters — the Cardinal's single-season
reception record holder — went out of the
game after only one catch. The flanker
hooked up with quarterback Todd Husak for
a 67-yard completion, but was forced to leave
the game immediately with a badly sprained
right ankle and did not return. His condition
remains day-to-day.
But there were some bright spots for Stan
ford during the loss.
With Walters out, Husak's primary re
ceiver became redshirt freshman Dave
Davis. Davis stepped up big and pulled in
eight receptions for 127 yards and both Car
dinal touchdowns.
"Whenever one of your good players goes
down everyone else has to step up," Davis
said. "We're really confident in our receivers.

But it would have been better if we won."
Husak finished the day 18-of-41 with 274
yards, one interception, and the two scoring
throws to Davis.
And despite the team suffering its first 0-2
start since 1991, Willingham was able to see
some improvement and hardly considers the
loss devastating.
"When something is devastating you can't
possibly move forward." he said. "I think this
is very much a team that can go forward. 1
would like to believe that Arizona is a better
team than San Jose. I think we did some
things very well."
The team opened its season on Sept. 5
with an upset loss to San Jose State, 35-23,
marking the first time in six years that the
Spartans have beaten Stanford.
In his debut as the Cardinal's starting
quarterback, Husak had an impressive three
touchdown, 29-of-54 passing performance,
but was intercepted twice.
Spartan running back Carlos Meeks
burned the Cardinal for a touchdown and
133 yards on 22 carries.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 14-7 half
time lead behind Husak, who completed 13
of 20 passes and connected for two scores.
But San Jose State came back with two
touchdowns in each of the last two quarters
for their third straight victory dating back to
last season.
