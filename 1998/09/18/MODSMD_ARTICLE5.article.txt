# Stanford Web site rivals US News
## 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Last month, just one day before the release of U.S.
News & World Report's 1999 "America's Best Colleges"
issue, Stanford launched a World Wide Web site to provide
a rival set of data for prospective students.
"We are clearly taking an important step," said Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
In the U.S. News rankings, Stanford moved up one spot
to No. 4 this year and claimed first in the best value catego
ry. Improved scores, however, did not end the I Iniversitv's
long-standing criticism of the magazine's ranking system.
Terry Shepard, director of University communications, de
clared the No. 4 ranking to be "as meaningless as any other
ranking on the list."
"I was, and remain mystified by the fact that some of our


Miler Lee — Dally
top competitors are not even in the
top 50 [of the best value category],
Casper said.
"The main difficulty in all of this
is to agree on definitions," Casper
explained. "U.S. News & World Re
port categories are very arbitrary
and often not well defined."
Casper cited the faculty-to-stu
dent ratio as an example. Many
schools use very different systems to
quantify the number of faculty mem
bers, so seemingly concrete data is
left up to colleges' interpretation.
Rice University President Mal
colm Ciillis echoed the criticism
voiced by Casper. "We think that
there are a lot of ways to better con
vey information than this beauty
contest approach," Gillis explained.
A self-declared skeptic of the
U.S. News rankings, C i ill is said that

Rice University plans to launch a
Web site similar to Stanford's in
mid-October.
'"We share with President Casper
the belief that universities have not
provided sufficient, easily accessible
information on academics and costs
to prospective students, and, in addi
tion, the accuracy of what has been
provided has been of an uneven
quality," Gillissaid.
To ensure a high-quality Web
site, Stanford spent $30,000 and
hired the accounting firm Price Wa
terhouse Coopers to oversee the
project. The firm "carefully exam
ined our processes, helped us refine
the definitions and certified the ac
curacy of the data," said Shepard.
The firm "helped identify what
statistics we cannot offer," Shepard
added. "()ne of many problems with
U.S. News is that its questionnaire
often asks for numbers that we sim
ply cannot count in the way they
want."

Shepard said that the University
believes the $30,(XX) expenditure "is
worthwhile because the public
needs to have confidence that we are
providing accurate, and only accu
rate, data. As you may recall, some
schools in the past have been ac
cused of giving false data to U.S.
News."
The Web site is a combined effort
of University Communications, the
Registrar's Office, the Admissions
Office and the Budget Office. It crit
icizes "commercial guides that pur
port to 'rank' colleges," saying that
such rankings are "inherently mis
leading and inaccurate."
Although initially the data on
Rice's Web site will go up unaudited,
(iillis said Rice also plans to have an
accounting firm, review its data as
soon as possible.
(iillis declared that an audited
Web site would be preferable to the
U.S. News list that "resembles foot
ball rankings."

The magazine has criticized Stan
ford's Web site for lacking objectivi
ty-
" I hat's an amusing reaction from
a magazine that has never submitted
its own data or questionable formu
las to an outside audit," commented
Shepard.
U.S. News has never had an out
side tirm do an analysis of its data
collection and processing methods.
When asked about reliability,
Amy Graham, Director of Data Re
search at U.S. News, said the maga
zine does its own data analysis with
"a number of protection balances.
The question is not to have [a firm
such as] Price Waterhouse Cooper
look at what we do, but to look at
what the schools do and what the
schools give us."
Two categories appear in the US
News rankings that do not appear on
Stanford's Web site.
Stanford, unlike the magazine,
does not supply statistics on alumni

giving or percentage of students who
graduate. Shepard said it is difficult
to keep track of alumni.
Regarding graduation rate, Shep
ard cited a strong correlation be
tween a negative rating and engi
neering schools. He remarked that it
was not realistic to think that KX)
percent of students should graduate
from such rigorous and prescriptive
curricula.
Now that a Web site exists, the
University is considering the option
of not submitting the surveys circu
lated annually by U.S. News and
other guidebook companies. In
stead, the University may direct all
inquiries to the Web site.
Gillis said Rice University will
not even answer the U.S. News ques
tionnaire unless radical changes are
made; Casper said he is yet to make
a decision about Stanford's partic
ipation in the coming year's rankings.
Among the several dozen ques
tionnaires the University receives

from guidebook companies, U.S.
News' surveys are mailed in March
and are due in April.
Both Casper and Gillis said they
would like to ignore the final rank
ings. In fact, Gillis said he does ..,
until an alumnus calls.
Casper, though, has become re
signed to his fate. He reads the rank
ings, even though he does not sup
port them.
"I do so before the alumnus
calls," Casper said. "I would love to
ignore the U.S. News rankings, but.
the fact of the matter is, wherever I
go someone brings them to my at
tention."
This is not the first time the U.S.
News college rankings have been
brought to Casper's attention.
In 19%, Casper wrote a letter to
James Fallows, then the new editor
in chief of the magazine. Casper
commented that "rankings lead
readers to believe either that univer
sity quality pops up and down like
politicians in polls or that last year's
rankings were wrong, but this year's
are right."
Casper also noted in the letter
that "knowing that universities —
and in most eases, the statistics they
submit — change little from one
year to the next, I can only conclude
that what are changing are the for
mulas the magazine's number mas
sagers employ "
At the time, Casper found limit
ed support. "When 1 first raised the
issue, other university presidents

more or less gave me the cold shoul
der," remarked Casper.
Later that year, according to
Shepard, Columbia University pres
ident George Rupp and former Uni
versity of Michigan president James
Duderstadt joined Casper at a meet
ing with Fallows regarding these
concerns, but there has been no fur
ther contact.
However, despite his champi
oning against the U.S. News rank
ings, Casper does not want anyone
to identify opposition to U.S. News
rankings as his sole cause. "I certain
ly do not want to go down in history
as the man who battled U.S. News &
World Report year after year, par
ticularly if no one else is interested,"
Casper said.

often asks for numbers that we sim
ply cannot count in the way they
want."

Shepard said that the University
believes the $30,(XX) expenditure "is
worthwhile because the public
needs to have confidence that we are
providing accurate, and only accu
rate, data. As you may recall, some
schools in the past have been ac
cused of giving false data to U.S.
News."
The Web site is a combined effort
of University Communications, the
Registrar's Office, the Admissions
Office and the Budget Office. It crit
icizes "commercial guides that pur
port to 'rank' colleges," saying that
such rankings are "inherently mis
leading and inaccurate."
Although initially the data on
Rice's Web site will go up unaudited,
(iillis said Rice also plans to have an
accounting firm, review its data as
soon as possible.
(iillis declared that an audited
Web site would be preferable to the
U.S. News list that "resembles foot
ball rankings."

The magazine has criticized Stan
ford's Web site for lacking objectivi
ty-
" I hat's an amusing reaction from
a magazine that has never submitted
its own data or questionable formu
las to an outside audit," commented
Shepard.
U.S. News has never had an out
side tirm do an analysis of its data
collection and processing methods.
When asked about reliability,
Amy Graham, Director of Data Re
search at U.S. News, said the maga
zine does its own data analysis with
"a number of protection balances.
The question is not to have [a firm
such as] Price Waterhouse Cooper
look at what we do, but to look at
what the schools do and what the
schools give us."
Two categories appear in the US
News rankings that do not appear on
Stanford's Web site.
Stanford, unlike the magazine,
does not supply statistics on alumni

giving or percentage of students who
graduate. Shepard said it is difficult
to keep track of alumni.
Regarding graduation rate, Shep
ard cited a strong correlation be
tween a negative rating and engi
neering schools. He remarked that it
was not realistic to think that KX)
percent of students should graduate
from such rigorous and prescriptive
curricula.
Now that a Web site exists, the
University is considering the option
of not submitting the surveys circu
lated annually by U.S. News and
other guidebook companies. In
stead, the University may direct all
inquiries to the Web site.
Gillis said Rice University will
not even answer the U.S. News ques
tionnaire unless radical changes are
made; Casper said he is yet to make
a decision about Stanford's partic
ipation in the coming year's rankings.
Among the several dozen ques
tionnaires the University receives

from guidebook companies, U.S.
News' surveys are mailed in March
and are due in April.
Both Casper and Gillis said they
would like to ignore the final rank
ings. In fact, Gillis said he does ..,
until an alumnus calls.
Casper, though, has become re
signed to his fate. He reads the rank
ings, even though he does not sup
port them.
"I do so before the alumnus
calls," Casper said. "I would love to
ignore the U.S. News rankings, but.
the fact of the matter is, wherever I
go someone brings them to my at
tention."
This is not the first time the U.S.
News college rankings have been
brought to Casper's attention.
In 19%, Casper wrote a letter to
James Fallows, then the new editor
in chief of the magazine. Casper
commented that "rankings lead
readers to believe either that univer
sity quality pops up and down like
politicians in polls or that last year's
rankings were wrong, but this year's
are right."
Casper also noted in the letter
that "knowing that universities —
and in most eases, the statistics they
submit — change little from one
year to the next, I can only conclude
that what are changing are the for
mulas the magazine's number mas
sagers employ "
At the time, Casper found limit
ed support. "When 1 first raised the
issue, other university presidents

more or less gave me the cold shoul
der," remarked Casper.
Later that year, according to
Shepard, Columbia University pres
ident George Rupp and former Uni
versity of Michigan president James
Duderstadt joined Casper at a meet
ing with Fallows regarding these
concerns, but there has been no fur
ther contact.
However, despite his champi
oning against the U.S. News rank
ings, Casper does not want anyone
to identify opposition to U.S. News
rankings as his sole cause. "I certain
ly do not want to go down in history
as the man who battled U.S. News &
World Report year after year, par
ticularly if no one else is interested,"
Casper said.
