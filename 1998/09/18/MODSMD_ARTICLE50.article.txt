# Walters sidelined with bad ankle
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
With one turn of an ankle, tomor
row's Stanford-North Carolina
game became that much more diffi
cult for the Cardinal. Troy Walters, a
preseason All-American Hanker and
Stanford's all-time single-season re
ceptions leader, will sit out the game
with a badly sprained ankle.
The redshirt junior snatched a 67-
yard pass from quarterback Todd
Husak in the first quarter of Satur
day's game against Arizona, but left
the game after turning his ankle on
the play.
I lobbling on crutches on the side
lines. Walters was not an uplifting
sight.
"Anytime you lose one of your
very good players, you've got to feel
like that's a very huge absence." said
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"You want to have Troy any chance
you have."
The absence of Walters, one of
Stanford's five returning offensive
starters, hurts an already inexperi
enced offense.
"We had to adjust and put a fresh
man in there," Husak said of Satur

day's game. "Anytime you put your
best player on the bench, it hurts."
Wide receivers Deßonnie Pitts, a
redshirt sophomore, and Dave
Davis, a redshirt freshman, will again
be forced to step up their play, as
they did on Saturday.
" The play of Davis was very
pleasing," Willingham said of the
wide receiver's two touchdown game
last week. "He has great instincts,
natural skills and the ability to play
very well."
But without Walters, Husak will
be missing a receiver that both he
and Hutchinson relied on last year.
Walters, who stands at 5 feet 8
inches, was coming off the best sea
son ever for a Stanford receiver.
With 1,206 receiving yards and 11
touchdowns last year, expectations
are high for Walters to be in con
tention to break every Cardinal re
ceiving record after his two remain
ing seasons.
Coming on to the scene in 19%
after redshirting his freshman year,
Walters surprised all during the final
four games of the season, making 21
receptions for 291 yards and two
touchdowns, in addition to a third
touchdown off a 75-yard punt return.
