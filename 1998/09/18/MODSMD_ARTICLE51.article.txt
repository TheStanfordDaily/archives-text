# Husak in at starter, freshmen QBs wait
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
After the Cardinal's second
straight loss of the season, Stan
ford's inexperienced football play
ers slumped in the metal folding
chairs sitting in their locker room.
Perhaps this did not meet junior
Todd Husak's expectations for his
inaugural season as a starting quar
terback.
"Anytime you are the starting
quarterback there is pressure to
win." Husak said. "I feel confident
enough, if I play my game."
While he has already thrown for
five touchdowns this season, the
Cardinal is 0-2 for the first time
since 1991 and the pressure is
mounting. Husak, however, says
that this is not affecting him.
Named the starting quarterback
only four days prior to this year's
season opener against San Jose
State. Husak has spent the last two
years as a reserve for Chad H utchin
son. When Hutchinson, who ranks
seventh among Stanford's career
passing leaders with 4,235 yards,
gave up his remaining two years of
football eligibility to sign a baseball
contract. Husak was forced to com
pete with redshirt freshmen Joe
Borchard and Randy Fasani for the
job.
"They're both so good and so
competitive." Husak said. "We're
all friends and we realize we're here
to help the team. 1 want to see them
do well and I want to see the team
do well."
The fact that all three quarter
backs are incredible athletes hasn't
made head coach Tyrone Willing
ham's job any easier. Fasani. who
was perhaps the best high school
quarterback in the nation two years

ago, was put in at tight end for one
play during last week's game.
"We do have an outstanding ath
lete in Randy and we can't afford to
have good athletes sitting on the
sidelines," Willingham said.
Husak seemed pleased to have
Fasani in the game with him despite
the fact that they could not connect
on the one pass play run.
"Randy's a great athlete and we
figured we have to get him in the
game somehow." Husak said. "We
worked Randy a bit at receiver last
week. I'm not sure what we're going
to do this week."
However, with the Cardinal
down 17 late in the game. Borchard
was chosen over Fasani to take over
for Husak. The coaching stall felt
Borchard was better suited for this
"mayday situation," but said it did
not mean that Borchard had won
the primary backup spot.
Willingham said that the choice
over who will come in as the prima
ry backup will probably be decided
with regards to what advantages
each athlete has to contribute to
current game situation.
Borchard didn't have much time
to make an impact in a game which
was already decided, but he did
complete 2 of 6 passes and had an
11-yard rush.
Both he and Fasani are still listed
as Husak's No. 2 on the Cardinal
depth chart.
"We look at both of those guys as
having good things to offer." Will
ingham said.
Borchard seemed supportive of
Husak and didn't speculate much
on who was second string.
"1 think Todd is playing very
well." Borchard said. "I'm just
going out and playing when I 'm told
to."
