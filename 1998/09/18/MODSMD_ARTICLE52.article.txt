# CROSS COUNTRY
## Lananna running a finely-tuned 'Machine' 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
They refer to themselves as The
Machine. Each part is integral and
the absence of any one would affect
the whole system. Farts are changed
and replaced throughout the years,
but the final result is the same.
They're the members of the Stan
ford cross country teams, and lately.
The Machine has been running in
peak condition.

"We want to build a consistent
team," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"We want a team that always com
petes, not necessarily a dynasty, but a
permanent fixture at the NCAAs."
A year ago, the men were on the
podium as NCAA champions, a spot
which the women missed by only two
points, a fraction of a second. The
season before that, both teams
shared the spotlight of triumph at Na
tionals, bringing in the program's
first-ever national titles.

Gone from those teams are veter
an leaders like Monal Chokshi and
Sarna Renfro for the women and
Greg Jimmerson and Nathan Nutter
for the men. Things are different; the
people are different.
But the legacy remains.
It's a program built from hard
work and support. It's a tradition of
winning. But that legacy isn't set in
stone. Each year's team wants to
leave its mark, and this team is no dif
ferent.
"What has happened with our
program is that those who have pre
ceded set the stage," Lananna said. "I
think [the current members' mission]
is to see them build their own tradi
tion."
Leading the men's squad this year
will be senior twins Brad and Brent
Hauser, as well as senior Jason Balk
man. Nutter was the Cardinal's top
finisher at last year's NCAAs, but
these three were Nos. 2 to 4 and fin
ished with All-America honors.
Along with redshirt senior Jonathon
Weldon, the trio will be the core of
the Stanford men's leadership.
But there is youth right behind
them. Sophomore Jonathan Riley
had a breakthrough freshman sea
son and was the team's fifth runner
at last year's championship. His
23rd-place finish overall was key in
securing the Cardinal's second con
secutive title.
Redshirt freshman Gabe Jennings
will also be expected to make an im
pact. Jennings won the Junior Na
tional Cross Country Championship
last year and was named to his third
straight U.S. national team. Senior
Chris Lundstrom, redshirt junior
Jake Maas and redshirt sophomore
Thomas Murley will also add depth.
Lananna also expects to see three
new freshmen get quality time on the

course tor the Cardinal. Among
these is Jamey Gifford, who took first
at the Reno Invitational on Sept. 5.
Maas and Lundstrom were right be
hind him, finishing second and third,
respectively.
"We're very excited about what
took place at the Reno meet," said
men's coordinator Mike Reilly. "It
was a good way for our athletes to
start the season off very well."
Despite losing Renfro, Kortney
Dunscombe and Sara Moore to grad
uation. the women return a solid core
of veterans and have brought in a
strong recruiting class to make up for
those losses.
Though sophomore Julia Stamps
was undoubtedly the team's best run
ner last year — she finished fourth at
the NCAAs — senior captain Mary
Cobb will most likely be the team's
vocal and emotional leader.
Cobb missed last year's indoor
and outdoor track seasons due to in
juries, but returned to action in the
Sept. 5 Reno Invitational, garnering a
third-place finish. Redshirt freshman
Elena Villareal also had a strong
showing, finishing fifth as the Cardi
nal captured first place overall.
Returning with Cobb and Stamps
from the squad that ran at last year's
nationals will be junior Sally Glynn
and sophomore Ann Ramsey. Senior
Jessica Fry, the women's top runner
for much of the l l )% championship
season, also returns after redshirting
last season.
Veteran runners Kerry Dugan,
Shaluinn Fullove and Mary Huang
will bolster a lineup that features a
handful of strong freshmen.
"We have a class of women fresh
men that are very good." Lananna
said. "We have five or six of those
women that are in some capacity
going to help the team."

Senior captain Mary Cobb will try to lead the women's team back to
the NCAA championship podium. After capturing the Cardinal's first
title in 1996, the women fell two points short of a title last year.
