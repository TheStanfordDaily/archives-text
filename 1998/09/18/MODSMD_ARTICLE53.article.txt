# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford on top once again Card returns strong squad 
### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
A recent coaches' poll ranked the
Stanford men's water polo team first
in the nation and this year's squad
has the talent and experience to
prove that it deserves that honor.
The Cardinal, under head coach
Dante Dettamanti, competes in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,
which includes the top teams in the
nation. However, only two teams
from the MPSF will compete in the
NCAA Final Four in order to pro
vide equal representation from the
rest of the country.
Last season, Stanford narrowly
missed gaining a berth in the nation
al tournament when it lost to IJSC
by one goal in the MPSF champi
onship game. In 19%, the NCAA
committee selected UCLA over
Stanford to fill the spot at the Final
Four. After two years of disappoint
ment, the Cardinal is ready to take
back the mantle.
"We have a lot of experience [this
year]," Dettamanti said. "Our top
nine guys are juniors and seniors and
10,11, and 12 are sophomores so we
have a lot of good depth."
The Cardinal will be led by red
shirt junior Brian Heifferon who
was a first-team All-American last
season. Heifferon is the only current
Stanford player training with the
United States national team. He led
the Cardinal in scoring last season
with 36 points and looks to be a team
leader again this year.
Along with Heifferon, all five se
niors on this year's team are candi

dates for All-America honors. Top
ping the group is senior goalie Chris
Aguilera, who is widely considered
the best goalkeeper in the nation
and earned All-America status in
1996 and 1997, tallying a total of 421
saves during those two seasons.
"We have a dominating defense
with (Aguilera] in the goal," Detta
manti said.
Rounding out the senior class are
David Hay, Arturo Rodelo, Layne
Beaubien and Jeremiah Robison.
Hay is the primary hole man for the
Cardinal and was an honorable
mention All-American in 1997.

Rodelo, a notably strong passer,
has had extensive international ex
perience while playing with the
Mexican Junior and Senior national
teams. Beaubien was an All-Ameri
can last season and will be the start
ing two-meter defender. Robison is
a fifth-year senior who recorded 20
points in the last two seasons.
In addition to Heifferon, juniors
Jonathan Skaalen, Sean Joy, Andy
Walburger and Michael Lipinski
should be seeing a lot of pool time.
Skaalen has moved into the start
ing lineup and is a strong outside
shooter; Joy has a strong, quick

counterattack; Walburger is an in
tense player and led the team in
scoring during its 1998 summer tour
of Hungary, Italy and Hawaii; Lipin
ski is a strong center-forward with a
special knack for drawing kick-outs.
Redshirt freshmen Pasi Dutton,
Arik Goodman, Todd Snider, Mark
Amott and Kendall Benson will also
add depth and experience to the
team.
The new recruits are a talented
group of freshmen that includes
Nathan Alldredge, Brian Darrow,
