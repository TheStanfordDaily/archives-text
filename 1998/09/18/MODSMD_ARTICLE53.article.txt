# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford on top once again Card returns strong squad 
### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
A recent coaches' poll ranked the
Stanford men's water polo team first
in the nation and this year's squad
has the talent and experience to
prove that it deserves that honor.
The Cardinal, under head coach
Dante Dettamanti, competes in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,
which includes the top teams in the
nation. However, only two teams
from the MPSF will compete in the
NCAA Final Four in order to pro
vide equal representation from the
rest of the country.
Last season, Stanford narrowly
missed gaining a berth in the nation
al tournament when it lost to IJSC
by one goal in the MPSF champi
onship game. In 19%, the NCAA
committee selected UCLA over
Stanford to fill the spot at the Final
Four. After two years of disappoint
ment, the Cardinal is ready to take
back the mantle.
"We have a lot of experience [this
year]," Dettamanti said. "Our top
nine guys are juniors and seniors and
10,11, and 12 are sophomores so we
have a lot of good depth."
The Cardinal will be led by red
shirt junior Brian Heifferon who
was a first-team All-American last
season. Heifferon is the only current
Stanford player training with the
United States national team. He led
the Cardinal in scoring last season
with 36 points and looks to be a team
leader again this year.
Along with Heifferon, all five se
niors on this year's team are candi

dates for All-America honors. Top
ping the group is senior goalie Chris
Aguilera, who is widely considered
the best goalkeeper in the nation
and earned All-America status in
1996 and 1997, tallying a total of 421
saves during those two seasons.
"We have a dominating defense
with (Aguilera] in the goal," Detta
manti said.
Rounding out the senior class are
David Hay, Arturo Rodelo, Layne
Beaubien and Jeremiah Robison.
Hay is the primary hole man for the
Cardinal and was an honorable
mention All-American in 1997.

Rodelo, a notably strong passer,
has had extensive international ex
perience while playing with the
Mexican Junior and Senior national
teams. Beaubien was an All-Ameri
can last season and will be the start
ing two-meter defender. Robison is
a fifth-year senior who recorded 20
points in the last two seasons.
In addition to Heifferon, juniors
Jonathan Skaalen, Sean Joy, Andy
Walburger and Michael Lipinski
should be seeing a lot of pool time.
Skaalen has moved into the start
ing lineup and is a strong outside
shooter; Joy has a strong, quick

counterattack; Walburger is an in
tense player and led the team in
scoring during its 1998 summer tour
of Hungary, Italy and Hawaii; Lipin
ski is a strong center-forward with a
special knack for drawing kick-outs.
Redshirt freshmen Pasi Dutton,
Arik Goodman, Todd Snider, Mark
Amott and Kendall Benson will also
add depth and experience to the
team.
The new recruits are a talented
group of freshmen that includes
Nathan Alldredge, Brian Darrow,

Senior goalie Chris Aguilera will lead the top-ranked Cardinal from between the posts as it vies for its
first national title since 1994.
Nick 111 is and Onno Koelman. Ellis
\v;is the nation's top high school
goalie and has competed interna
tionally. Koelman hails from Beau
mont, Australia, where he played
on the Australian Under-2() and
Under-17 teams.
Even with such a strong group of
returnees and bright new prospects,
the competition is brutal in the
MPSF.
"We play against the top nine
teams in the nation an average of
three times per team," Dettamanti
said. "Every game is critical."
Stanford is off to a good start.
The Cardinal defeated IK'-Davis
12-4 on Saturday and went on to an
8-2 win against Pacific on Sunday.
"Sunday's game was the first of
the season's really critical games,"
Dettamanti said.
Stanford's defense held HOP
scoreless until the last three minutes
of the game. Aguilera notched 14
saves in the goal.
"We're fronting the hole on de
fense and that shut UOP down,"
Dettamanti said.
The ( ardinal also demonstrated
its powerful offensive attack this
weekend. The team scored a two
point goal from outside the seven
meter mark in each of the games.
"We have a lot of outstanding
outside shooters," Dettamanti said.
"We also have a lot of guys playing
center-forward so we can rotate
that position a lot."
Stanford continues its preseason
play this weekend, beginning with a
game at UC-San Diego today at
3:30 p.m. Then the team travels to
Newport Beach for the So Cal
Tournament. Because the tourna
ment was scheduled before the
coaches' poll was released, Stanford
was seeded sixth for this weekend.
The Cardinal faces Air Force
and USC in its first two games on
Saturday.
"There are a lot of positive
things [on this team]," Dettamanti
said. "We're strong in all phases of
the game and we have a lot of good
experience."
