# Strong redshirt class supports polo squad
## 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
They've been called almost
everything: The Powerhouse-in
the-Making, That Recruit Class,
The Freshmen Fraternity.
Most often, though, they were
simply called The Freshmen.
All nine members of the redshirt
freshman group sat out last season,
awaiting their debut in 1998.
Now is their chance.
Due to the prestige of Stanford
and its water polo tradition, all nine
wanted to come to the Farm despite
the lack of athletic scholarships.
"It's kind of funny because I
didn't have any scholarships, " said
Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti as he shook his head in won
derment. "I had already [set aside]
all the scholarships. They are all con
sidered walk-ons because they
didn't receive any scholarships."
But for a group of walk-ons, the
group definitely presents a formida
ble squad.
Consider goalie Arik Goodman,
a 6-foot-4-inch 180-pounder out of
San Jose's Bellarmine Prep. As a
high school senior, Goodman was
selected as the Central Coast Player
of the Year and garnered All-Amer
ican honors.
In addition, he was chosen as a
member of the United States Junior
National Team, a virtual "who's
who" squad of the water polo world.
Then there are the five drivers:
Sean McEachern, Colin Shaugh
nessy,Todd Snider, Pasi Dutton and
Blake Mobley.
As team captain for the Long
Beach Wilson team, McEachern
twice led his squad to a California
Interscholastic Federation champi

onship title. For his efforts, McEach
ern was selected as a first-team CIF
and all-league performer.
At 6 feet 2 inches and 185
pounds; Shaugnessy was a three
time Junior Olympic All-American,
a member of the U.S. national youth
team, a first team all-CIF and a two
time all-league selection.
Shaugnessy also hurls a blistering
right-handed shot.
If Shaugnessy is one of the best
shooters, Snider is definitely one of
the fastest swimmers.
A speed demon out of Lodi,
Calif.'s Tokay High School, Snider
earned a spot on the U.S. junior na
tional team and was a first team all-
CIF and all-league selection.
Snider "is very fast," Dettamanti
said. "Whenever we do sprints, he's
probably the fastest guy on the team
in short sprints."
Originally a goalie, Dutton now
plays the field. At Porterville High
School, he gained first team all
league honors for two seasons and
first-team all-CIF.
Mobley, meanwhile, hails from a
water polo legacy. His older brother,
Bret Mobley, Class of '98, once
played for the Cardinal squad. The
younger Mobley was a first team
North Coast section all-CIF player.
Kendall Benson was the Empire
League MVP in 1996, while Glenn
Giokaris was a first team and all
league selection.
Finally, Mark Amott dominates
the hole. At 6 feet 5 inches and 205
pounds, his teammates simply refer
to him as "Monster."
As well as playing as a member of
the U.S. junior national and U.S. na
tional youth teams, Amott was a
first team All-American and first
team all-CIF for two years.
