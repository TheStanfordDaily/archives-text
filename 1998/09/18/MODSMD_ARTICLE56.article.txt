## Losses leave hole for defending champs No.5 Women of Troy come to Maples tonight; UCLA Bruins to visit Cardinal on Sunday 
### Molly Brizgys Michaela Crouch Editorial Staff 
Time is not on the Stanford
women's volleyball team's side.
Having only played six matches,
the young and inexperienced ninth
ranked Cardinal (4-2) opens confer
ence play with a bang as it faces No.
5 USC tonight at Maples Pavilion in
the season's home opener.
The Cardinal has spent all of its
season thus far on the road, gaining
valuable playing experience against
teams like the third-ranked Nebras
ka Cornhuskers and the No. 4 UC-
Santa Barbara Gauchos. Tonight,
Stanford finally gets to test its skills
on its home court.
It won't be easy.
The Women of Troy return five
starters from last year's team and are
favored to win the Pacific-10 Con
ference this season. They are led by
sophomore Janice Mounts, the Pac
10's top returning setter, senior Jen
nifer Kessy, who led the Pac-10 in
kills with 4.50 kills per game in 1997
and 1997 American Volleyball
Coaches Association All-American
senior Jasmine Marinkovic.
"USC is quick, athletic and expe
rienced," said head coach Don
Shaw, Volleyball Magazine's 1997
Coach of the Year. "We usually
don't open against such a strong
team but that's the way the schedule
was this year."
Last year, the Trojans finished

second in the conference behind
Stanford and made it to the Pacific
Regional Semifinals before losing to
Nebraska, 3-2. Stanford, meanwhile,
went on to win the national champi
onship.
The tides have turned and this
season the Trojans are singing a dif
ferent tune.
With USC slated to finish first in
the Pac-10 for the first time in 5
years, Stanford goes into the season
a conference underdog.
"It's early but it's a very impor
tant match," Shaw said. "The winner
will have a leg up. but still, it's an 18-
match schedule. That's a lot of vol
leyball. But it would be great to get
off on a good start."
Shaw will be looking to junior
Kerri Walsh (see feature, back page)
to step it up against the Trojans and
lead the offense.
Last weekend at the Powerßar
Invitational, Walsh led the team to a
first-place finish with her 29 kills, 22
digs and 18 blocks. Her effort was
good enough for her to garner Pac
-10 Player of the Week and tourna
ment MVP honors.
" Kerri is coming off a great week
end and I think she will have a
tremendous year," Shaw said.
Shaw is also looking to junior
outside hitter Sarah Clark to lead
the young but spry team.
"We really need Sarah to get into
her groove. She needs to take over
more responsibility," Shaw said.
With five of last year's core play

ers lost to graduation, the current
squad is still getting used to one an
other's playing styles and Shaw's
system.
Having only one senior on the
squad, defensive specialist Sarah
Neal, Shaw expects all of the fresh
man to get ample playing time and
hopes they will all contribute
tonight.
"Kerri is the only player back that
had a major load to carry last year,"
Shaw said. "I expect all four fresh
men to contribute quite a bit."
Due to the lack of experience,
Shaw has been unable to concen
trate on USC or individual players.
For now, the focus is on Stanford —
on becoming comfortable with one
another and on getting the basics
down.
"We don't even have a style yet,"
Shaw said. "Right now the focus is
on our side of the net."
Stanford worked to replace its
five players lost due to graduation —
Kristin Folkl, Barbara Ifejika, Deb
bie Lambert, Paula McNamee and
Lisa Sharpley. These players won an
unprecedented three national titles
in their four years at Stanford. Folkl
was named an All-American all four
years and Sharpley won the honor
three times.
These five players produced 68
percent of the Cardinal's kills, 58
percent of its service aces and 50 per
cent of its digs from last year's totals,
so other's will have to step up and fill
the hole.

At the San Diego State Universi
ty tournament from Sept. 3 to 5, the
Cardinal took second place to the
Cornhuskers.
In their final-round match, the
Cardinal defeated San Diego, 15-8,
15-6, 15-4. Stanford dominated the
match defensively, outblocking the
Toreros 5-1.
Freshman middle blocker Sara
Sandrick, the 1997 High School
Player of the Year, stepped up for
the Cardinal, recording nine blocks,
eight assisted and one solo.
More impressively, the Cardinal
held USD to .0(X) hitting percentage
in the final game of the match.
Two-sport star Lindsay Kagawa,
who is also a blue-chip basketball re
cruit, also came up big for Shaw's
squad. The freshman posted 54 as
sists.
Walsh and sophomore Jennifer
Detmer garnered All-Tournament
honors for their strong play. Detmer
finished with 44 kills overall, includ
ing a career-high 18 in the loss to
Nebraska.
The Cardinal opened the season
with a loss to fourth-ranked UC-
Santa Barbara, 9-15,2-15,15-5,8-15.
Sandrick had a double-double
with 13 digs and 12 kills, but new
comer Tara Conrad exploded for a
team-high 15 kills in her collegiate
debut.
However, the Gauchos con
trolled most of the match and were
able to avenge their NCAA-tourna
ment loss to the Cardinal last season.
