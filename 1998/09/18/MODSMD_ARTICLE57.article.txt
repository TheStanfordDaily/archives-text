### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
After suffering its first loss of
the season last week, the Stanford
men's soccer team traveled to
New England with the hopes of re
focusing on soccer while picking
up a few victories on the road.
The trip is off to a successful
start, as the Cardinal (3-1) defeat
ed the Harvard Crimson (0-1) with
a goal by senior captain A.J. Sauer
in the 101st minute of the game.
Though unable to score in the
first 100 minutes, the Cardinal
dominated the game from the
kick-off.
"It was close, yet we controlled
the game," said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. "Our pa
tience was good. We knew the win
would come."
The Harvard match was the
first after a disappointing loss to
San Jose State on September 7.
The victory over the Crimson,
however, put the Cardinal back on
the right track.
"We started worrying and lost
focus against San Jose State,"
Clark said. "We went back lo the
basics against Harvard. We didn't
get frustrated."
Sauer's game-winning goal
came off a beautiful pass from se
nior Simon Elliot, who had been
singled out by the Crimson as the
player to rough.
I le "has a habit of scoring vital
goals," Clark said of Sauer. "He
has done it many times."
The Crimson managed to get
off only six shots versus Stanford's

10. Redshirt sophomore goalie
Adam Zapala needed to make
only one save the entire game due
to the Cardinal's solid defense.
Stanford was forced to face Har
vard without senior starters Shan
Gaw and Aaron Jones. Gaw was
red-carded against San Jose State
and forced to sit out the game, and
Jones suffered a dislocated shoul
der against the Spartans.
The 2-1 loss against No. 9 San
Jose State was the first of the year
for the Cardinal. Though the Car
dinal dominated the game, the
team's one goal was not enough.
"Even though we controlled
the game, we looked frustrated at
times," Clark said. "They were a
strong side and were up for the
game."
Stanford's only goal came in
the second half by freshman Lee
Morrison, who shot a misplayed
ball through a crowd of defenders.
The Spartans scored the game
winninggoal in theSlst minute,off
a header by Todd Duncan.
In its home opener, the Cardi
nal defeated Santa Clara 2-0 with
goals by Siegman and Sauer. Elliot
recorded both assists.
()n Sept. I.the team opened its
season with a 5-0 victory over Hay
Area rival St. Mary's.
Completing its east coast tour.
Stanford will play in the Men's
Soccer Classic at Dartmouth Col
lege this weekend. This tourna
ment marks a homecoming for
Bobby Clark, who coached Dart
mouth from 1985-94.
Stanford will open tomorrow
against No. 12 Boston University.
