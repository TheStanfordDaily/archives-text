# Clark optimistic with veterans

New lights, new attention, new
pressure.
The Stanford men's soccer team
is a new national power.
After a breakthrough season in
1997, the Cardinal has a lot to be ex
cited about this coming season.
Ranked No. 6 in the preseason polls.

this year's veteran squad is returning
nine of last year's 11 starters and
boasts one of the top recruiting
classes in the program's history.
Under the guidance of head
coach Bobby Clark and the experi
ence of playing in the national spot
light. a promising season awaits.
With a high preseason ranking
and a realistic opportunity to vie for
the national title, many teams would

be looking toward the playoffs from
day one.
Clark, however, places the focus
for his team on the journey rather
than the final destination.
"Don't look to the end result. En
joying the journey is the most impor
tant part." Clark said. "We need to
enjoy every single game. There are
only 20 in the season and they will go
quickly."
Clark believes that this healthy
attitude and outlook is the key to
success.
Undefeated in its first 15 games
last year and ranked as high as No. 2,
Stanford's season came to an early
end as the Cardinal lost its first
NCAA tournament game in a crush
ing double-overtime loss to Wash
ington. But the experience the team
gained last year is sure to benefit this
year's squad.
The backfield is anchored by se
nior Ail-American Jamie Clark.
Clark, the son of Bobby Clark, was
named to the National Soccer
Coaches Association of America's
second team, the highest honor ever
received by a Stanford player.
He is Hanked on the left by red
shirt senior Eric Vandevelde, and
joined by junior Gerard Davis on
the right. Both Vandevelde and
Davis are coming off very solid sea
sons and are expected to make
strong contributions.
"Vandevelde and Davis have
come in with more poise than in the
previous years." Bobby Clark said.
"Both are fullbacks, but can get for
ward and add a lot to the offense.
The whole back line has the poten
tial to be very good."
The back line is rounded out by
highly touted freshman Lee Morri
son. A member of the U.S. National
Under-20 squad, Morrison has

stepped into a starting role with
ease.
"Morrison is a fairly exceptional
player, tops in the country," Bobby
Clark said. "He and Jamie are excel
lent passers and are comfortable on
the ball."
The Cardinal's offensive fire
power comes from a talented Iront
line. Time at the forward position is
split between senior captain A.J.
Sauer, senior Adam Siegman and
sophomore Corey Woolfolk.
Sauer "is an excellent leader."
Hobby Clark said. "He has the con
fidence of the team and of the coach
ing staff. Everyone has a lot of faith
in him. He is also a nice player on the
field with the ability to score goals."
Sauer led the squad last year with
nine goals. Woolfolk was behind
him with five goals and five assists.
Tying together the back and the
front lines are this year's midfield
ers, anchored by seniors Simon El
liott and Shan Gaw.
"Gaw and Elliott are great in
midfield," Clark said. "Both are very
strong technically and physically."
Stanford is fortunate to have two
talented goalies in redshirt sopho
mores Adam Zapala and Bobby
Randolph. Zapala has earned the
starting role for the second year in a
row. but the competition with Ran
dolph keeps both at the top of their
game. Last year, Zapala posted a
0.66 goals-against average, made 56
saves and was named to the Soccer
America All-Freshman Team.
With all the new and returning
talent, the Cardinal will be hard to
beat. But Bobby Clark stresses the
importance of patience among his
players, especially the seven seniors.
"The seniors have to be patient,
but they know it is their last chance,
so it is hard," Bobby Clark said.
