Delays, delays, delays.
Because of a few last project ap
provals needed from contractors and
county fire marshals on the renova
tions to Lagunita Court and Cowell
Cluster, RAs and other early arrivals
could not move into their residences
until Wednesday.
Construction of a new kitchen
and servcry for Roble Hall and La
gunita is also still incomplete.
" Hie renovated kitchen at Lagu
nita will not be finished until mid-Oc
tober," said Assoc. Director of Stu
dent Housing Rodger Whitney.
"Until then, meals will be catered in
from Roble and other dining halls."
A new dining room for Roble res
idents adjacent to Lagunita's dining
hall should also be ready to open in
mid-October. Until then. Roble resi

dents will eat in the old Ruble dining

Eucalipto and half of Ujamaa re
ceived fire marshal approval yester
day afternoon. Residents were able
to move into Cowell Cluster by 1 p.m.
Wednesday.
While waiting for the residences
to open, early student arrivals lived in
Xanadu, Roble and Cedro.
"The construction schedule was
extremely tight, and there are always
the last-minute details and occupan
cy approvals," said Whitney. "But
when everything comes together,
and students see the amazing amount
of work that has gone into renova
tion, it should be a photo finish."
Many students were frustrated
with their lack of housing.
"I came to campus early from
Chicago, expecting to move into the
Theta house early," said sophomore
Rachel Turow. "Instead, I've been

staying with a friend and using Cedro
as a place to store my suitcases until
the house opens.
"Had I known about the delay, I
might have made other arrange
ments to stay off campus," continued
Turow, who arrived early to train as
an Advising Associate. "Still, I'm
very excited to move into a freshly re
modeled house."
Both newly housed sororities.
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha
Theta, were affected by the delays.
Moving into Cowell and Lagunita
late, as Ellie Mertz, the 111 eta R A ex
plained, "makes the beginning of the
quarter seem a bit rushed, especially
for newly housed organizations like
sororities. But really, I can't com
plain. The dorms look a lot nicer and
most students should still be able to
move in on time."
The construction began the mo
ment students moved out for sum
mer vacation.
" The Lagunita renovation was es
pecially ambitious. We've renovated
the dorm rooms, added a new

kitchen and redone the dining hall,"
said Whitney.
The refurbishing of Lagunita in
cluded the installation of fire sprin
klers, handicapped-accessible stu
dent rooms, a seismic upgrade and
improved computer wiring to stu
dent rooms.
After visiting the new Lagunita,
former Ujamaa resident Anthea
Kelsick, remarked, "Lag has defi
nitely improved. The halls used to be
dark and the walls were a funny
shade of green, which tended to be
rather depressing. Now the place
looks so much more livable."
Both dorms were redone as part
of the Capital Improvement Project,
a 15-year plan begun in 1993 to reno
vate all dorms.
"The major two improvements
for the Cowell Cluster involved the
installation of new fire alarms and
sprinklers, along with the addition of
ramps and automatic doors to make
four of the five houses handicap ac
cessible," noted Project Engineer
Tim Heilmann.
