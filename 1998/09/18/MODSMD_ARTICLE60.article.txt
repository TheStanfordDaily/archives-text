# FIELD HOCKEY
## Dominating the NorPac 
### Nathan Christensen 
The Stanford women's field hockey team is out to
prove that an old Hollywood proverb about baseball can
also apply to field hockey.
Eight years ago Ray Kinsella of "Field of Dreams"
fame was told that if he built it, they would come.
Well this summer they built it, and this fall they came.
The Cardinal returns to the Farm after finishing the
1997 season with a .727 winning percentage, capturing
its seventh Northern Pacific Conference Championship.
By year's end, Stanford had earned seven All-Nor-
Pac honors, including Justina Williams' Co-Player of the
Year and Coach Sheryl Johnson's third consecutive, and
seventh overall. Coach of the Year award.
The Cardinal also returns to Astroturf.
Conducive to Stanford's quick play, the new varsity
hockey Astroturf field will speed up the Cardinal's dri
ves and finally give it a home equal to that of many other
field hockey powerhouses.
"I've always thought this team in particular is a great
turf team," Johnson said. Now, it's time to prove it.
Williams, a national All-American, is joined by se
niors and Regional All-Americans Monique Leroux
and Carey Cloud.
"We're playing really well together with just that
extra year of experience," Johnson said, claiming to
have excellent leaders on the team. "They lead by ex
ample, always give their all [and] inspire others to get
things done."
Leroux, one of those leaders, has faith.
"I think we have the ability to be the best team since
I've been here," she said. "I think this year we have ex
perience and depth as well."
But as Stanford faces the new season it is confronted
with a difficult schedule. Johnson, however, hopes to use
this challenge to boost Stanford's credibility.
"We have a really strong schedule [that] will help us
in the national rankings," Johnson said. "Each game is
important in its own way."
The expansion of the NorPac from three teams to six
will add to the difficult schedule as well.
Stanford (3-2 as of Sept. 16) entered play last week
end at Michigan with three games under its belt, and
only one loss.
On Friday, the Cardinal extended its winning streak
to two games by soundly defeating Southwest Missouri,
2-0.
Sophomore starting goalie Meg Crowley earned her
second shutout of the season, protecting goals by Ler
oux and junior forward Mallorv Chambers.

The Cardinal, however, couldn't escape its midwest
road trip without being handed a defeat by Michigan, 4-
0. Even so. Coach Johnson saw promising signs.
"Everybody started coming together on that trip,"
she said.
The Cardinal returned home for a game against
Northwestern yesterday. Results of that game were not
available at press time.
The Cardinal now turns its sights to the upcoming
NorPac home conference games against California and
Davis & Elkins, Sept. 26 and 27, respectively.
Johnson hopes the crucial homestand, including the
annual grudge match with the rival Bears, will help
move Stanford closer to its postseason goals.
