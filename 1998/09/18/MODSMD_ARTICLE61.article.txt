# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Healthy Cardinal team showing some good signs 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
As the bulk of the season ap
proaches, the Stanford women's soc
cer team appears ready to make a le
gitimate run at a conference title, re
turning several key players from in
juries and years of experience.
Already 3-1-1, the Cardinal faces
some of the top teams in the nation
in the coming weeks in what should
be a test of how far it has come.
"We're off to a good start. I think
the preseason went very well," said
third-year head coach Steve Swan
son. "The nice thing is we've done
well early on and that's a good sign."
With powerhouses Santa Clara
and Texas A&M both traveling to
Stanford, Swanson is eagerly look
ing to the games as an opportunity to
gauge how strong his team is.
"We've got a lot of top teams
coming in here," he said. "I think

you always have to find out where
you are. That's tremendous for us."
Seniors Kelly Adamson and Tra
cye Lawyer should be able to give
Stanford some needed goals during
those games in their position as
starting forwards. Last season.
Lawyer was a top scorer in the con
ference and earned First-Team All-
Pacific 10 Conference honors.
Adamson, on the other hand, re
turns as one of the team's captains
after earning First-Team All-Pac 10
honors in 1995, only to suffer
through injuries the last two seasons.
"We've got a lot of players com
ing back from injuries," Swanson
said. " This is as healthy as we've
been at this point [in the season]."
Senior captain Christy Stoffel
and junior Ronnie fair will be pow
ers in the midfield. Also looking to
make an impact are freshmen mid
fielders Amy Sauer and Martha
West, both Hiiih School All-Ameri

cans and top national recruits.
"Amy and Martha have tremen
dous skills and vision," Swanson
said. "They should both make an im
pact this year but, more importantly,
will figure heavily in the future of
Stanford soccer."
The Cardinal boasts an especially
strong trio of goalies. Both senior
Erin Bryla and sophomore Carly
Smolak are respected as two of the
nation's top goalkeepers. With 36
saves and a 1.53 goals-against aver
age last year, Bryla brings a wealth
of experience and a strong work
ethic to the Cardinal squad.
Smolak is an equally crucial com
ponent of the women's team. Last
season, she managed 11 saves and
posted an impressive 1.06 goals
against. fourth in the conference.
"Carly gives us a real physical
presence in the goal and is capable of
shutting down teams in the air,"
Swanson said.
The Stanford women powered
through their first three games, over
whelming San Francisco, San Diego
and Northern Illinois.
Last weekend the team headed to
the Nebraska Invitational where its
eleven-match winning streak was fi
nally snapped. After a grueling
game with Dartmouth that ended in
a 1-1 tie, the 20th-ranked Cardinal
was upset by No. 24 Nebraska, 3-0.
"There was a lot of emotion
tonight," Swanson said. "It was an ex
citing game but not a real pretty
game."
Although they failed to emerge
with a victory during the weekend,
both the women and coach Swanson
remain optimistic about this season.
