# On her dream team
## Walsh puts whole heart into the Cardinal 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
Two shoulder surgeries, and
she's still smiling.
In fact, Kerri Walsh can't stop
smiling. She has played volleyball
for the Stanford Cardinal for the
past two years. Two years with pain,
two years with tendinitis and two
years with All-America awards.
And she's right where she wants to
he.
"I always had my sights set on
Stanford," said Walsh, a junior who
grew up 20 minutes from campus
(12 if she's driving). "My parents al
ways said 'if you work hard, you can
get into Stanford.' I was totally will
ing to do that."
It's little surprise that Walsh,
now a junior, applied only to Stan
ford, turning down all other recruit
ing trips. After all. when she is de
termined. there is little stopping this
athlete.
By the fifth grade, Walsh was
playing for her school's volleyball
team as well as the club team,
thrilled with road trips to Stockton
and Sacramento. Her life was limit
ed to volleyball and schoolwork and
she loved it.
"I got to go out on rare occa
sions," she said. "That's all part of it.
I wanted to be good and it's paid off.
It's definitely worth it."
Claiming it paid off might be an
understatement for Walsh. Tying a
school record with 30 digs in last
year's NCAA championship victo
ry as a sophomore, Walsh was also
the National Freshman of the Year
in 1996 along with being named the
season's Final Four MVP.
While she missed friends' par
ties, and didn't go out as much as
her peers, Walsh was still smiling.
"I'd miss parties and that was
sad, but [volleyball| was so much
fun for me, it didn't matter," she
said. "My friends on the volleyball
team were my best friends."
Social skills don't seem to be a
problem for Walsh, who has quite a
following at Stanford's matches.

With Northern California full of a
supportive family and a ton of little
cousins running around, Walsh
couldn't imagine being anywhere
else.
"Everyone lives in the Bay
Area," she said. "It's so fun. We
have these balls we throw out at the
start of our matches and my cousins
swarm to them. They start crying if
they don't get to it."
Nothing new. It's always been
fun for Walsh. Her father, a former
minor league baseball player, told
her at an early age to stop playing if
it ever stopped being fun. Walsh is
still going strong.
While some might question the
fun in playing with tremendous pain
in the right shoulder, she didn't.
"I'm just kind of built loosely,"
Walsh chuckled. "So, I just needed
to get tightened up."

'If I have to be a left-handed
player to play the sport, I'll
do that'
— Kerri Walsh

Last year, perhaps, was the
greatest challenge for her. A right
handed hitter, she was forced to
serve with her left hand to avoid
pain and further injury.
"If 1 have to be a left-handed
player to play the sport, I'll do
that," Walsh said. "I didn't know
how I was going into each game
[last season]. I couldn't even pass. It
was kind of bad, but I got through
it."
She tried to figure out what other
aspects of the game she could work
on while she rested her shoulder.
"I just tried to focus on my de
fense and my blocking," Walsh said.
"That made me a smarter player. I
think last year was pretty beneficial.
If I could save my shoulder that
way, that's good. I need to pick and
choose my battles."
Having her second surgery this
past summer, Walsh believes she is

well on her way to being full force
once again. After having her rotator
cuff fixed, she hopes to be able to
continue playing for an extended
period of time.
"It's going to wear down my
body, but every sport does," Walsh
said. "The good times far outweigh
the bad times. 1 want to play for a
long time. I've never been sick of
[volleyball]. 1 still love it."
A serious contender to represent
the United States at the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, Aus
tralia, Walsh can't imagine a greater
thrill.
"It just seems like it will be the
most amazing experience," she
said. "It would be such a great thing
for my family too. They're telling
me they are buying tickets next year
— but no pressure."
If any thing's related to volley
ball, Walsh loves it. Her future be
yond the Olympics remains un
clear, but if beach volleyball is an
option, Walsh might soon be sport
ing the Ray-Bans.
"I want to milk this thing as
much as I can. If I can make money
playing volleyball, I'll have a great
time."
This is not to say that Walsh is
looking past her junior year and the
team's season. With the loss of five
seniors, including two All-Ameri
cans, the Cardinal will turn to
Walsh for both leadership and dom
inant attacks from her outside hitter
position.
"I'm going to take on a bigger
load, but I'm ready for that," she
said. "I'll have to be more vocal but
that is good for me. I think every
one's picking up the slack. Every
one knows we have to do the job."
Winning the NCAA champi
onship during both her freshman
and sophomore years, Walsh is aim
ing for nothing less this season.
And as the Cardinal's opponents
take to the court this season, per
haps the most intimidating sight will
be the six-foot-two-inch Walsh on
the opposite side of the net — smil
ing.
