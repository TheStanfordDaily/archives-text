## Catatonia 'International Velvet' 
### 
From the land that bore Manic Street Preachers, Super Furry
Animals and a million sheep jokes, comes Catatonia, origi
nally a sort of indie punk band, now quite officially Britpop.
Although the album is characterized by its first few tracks
as (fab) Britpop, Catatonia is far from indistinguishable from
the slew of groups that litters the popular British pop music
scene and usually sound like Sleeper or Cast. Cerys Matthews'
distinct vocal style lends a rough edge to the typically girlie
sound of pop female vocalists. And the band offers us a vari
ety of sounds outside the realm of modern pop such as reggae,
trip hop, and metal.
Catatonia's latest effort starts off with "Mulder and Scully,"
an upbeat pop song about the strange phenomena of contra
diction and desire. After "Game On" come "Road Rage" and
"I Am The Mob," both also energetic, solid tracks. At the same
time, songs like "Johnny Come Lately" and "Strange Glue" are
soft and lilting, a style reminiscent of the Sundays.
Despite the range and flexibility of the band,
"International Velvet" is a prime example of what earns
pop music its reputation. Catatonia writes universally ap
pealing and memorable melodies. Its clever but not gim
micky lyrics speak of the common undercurrents of life.
This is pop music at its best.
Unique, intelligent, and invigorating, "International Velvet" is
a fantastic album. Go buy it, and tear away from the regrettable
American default for Britpop that is Oasis and the Spice Girls.
