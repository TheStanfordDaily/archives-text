## Music for Your Ears 
### Michael Baer Contributing Writer 
In spite of what everyone tells you (and what you tell
everybody), you're going to have spare time here. So why not
use it to make your working hours more enjoyable?
Music soothes the savage beast. It also makes work more
fun. While doing differential equations to Cake may not be
the wisest way to study, most work does not suffer from a bit
of background music.

Let's suppose that you want to buy a CI) to soothe your
ravaged nerves come finals time. Where to get it?
Fortunately, the Bay Area has plenty of places to go.
Tower Records started in Northern California thirty
years ago and grew into an international chain. The
Mountain View store, by the corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road (630 San Antonio), is a huge bonanza for
a fan of any genre, with books and video rentals to boot.
Closer still is the Wherehouse, west of campus at 700 El
Camino. It has decent selection in CD and video, but is relatively
modest in size compared to Tower. Both stores have outlets for

BASS, the Bay Area ticket sellers. All Wherehouse
stores (and there are at least a dozen in the Bay
Area) also feature used CDs every so often you
might stumble across something unexpected.
The closest store to campus is Hear Music in
the Stanford Shopping Center, which has a few
niche genres and good overall selection. Hear
Music also lets you listen to anything before you
purchase it.
Unfortunately, aside from the usually main
stream selection the Wherehouse offers, to find
used CDs, you'll have to venture out a bit.
Downtown Palo Alto (477 University) has
Compact Disc Land, but for the widest selection,
you'll have to go out to a Bay Area urban center.
Nearby cities offer restaurants, museums, stores,
and tourist attractions, so you'll have plenty of
good excuses to go to a real music store.
In the South Bay, on El Camino Real in

Sunnyvale and near the Dumbarton Bridge in Newark, is
Compact Disc Land. Every used CD there is less than $10,
and you can also sample CDs before you buy.
Along Bascom Avenue in Campbell you will find Rasputin
Records and Streetlight. Although Rasputin has a great hip
hop section and Streetlight emphasizes rock, you can find all
kinds of new and used music at each. Their wide selection
and size mean that one can spend hours looking through
used CD and record bins. Rasputin also has locations in
Berkeley, Pleasant Hill, and San Lorenzo (all in the East Bay),
while Streetlight has stores in Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
San Francisco is also home to the the newest location for
Amoeba. Amoeba, with its mother store in Berkeley and its
San Francisco branch in the Haight, has the largest selection of
music 1 have ever seen. The sheer size of both stores is amaz
ing, and I've found many a rare disc at each. Even the store's ex
terior, complete with a 60s-style mural, is impressive. It's not an
experience to be missed if you're looking for the hard-to-find.
In Berkeley you can also find the collector's store Mod
Lang, specializing in imports. Vinyl Solution—which also
has a decent CD selection —is the nearest used music su
perstore, in San Mateo.
There are also plenty of specialty music stores dotting the
Bay Area. Check out http://yp.yahoo.com/. While you're on
line, you might want to visit Internet music stores such as
CDnow.com.
So stock up now before the real work begins. And while
you're out, look around and take in all that the Bay Area has
to offer. You're going to be here a while, so you might as well
enjoy it.
