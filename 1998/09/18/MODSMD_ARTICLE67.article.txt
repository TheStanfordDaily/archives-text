### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
More often than not, dorm dining just doesn't cut it. The fine cuisine that committed
hashers dish up morning, noon and night gets old really fast. While there are popular on
campus alternatives like the iloffee House and Jamba Juice, sometimes an off-campus food
excursion is well worth the trip, local restaurants serve some of the best food around,
though some oj them are priced to prove it. Hut ij you have a little extra time and money
on your hands, these places can provide those much-needed breaks from the dining hall.

(.enter is the place to go. This cozy restaurant offers a wide variety of appetizers ranging

in tact, Max's plates have the words "share me" on them.
Remember to leave room for dessert - even if you don't
have a sweet tooth, their yummy delectables are sure to
convert you.

with nan, three samplings of entrees, as well as yogurt, rice and mango ice cream, that is
priced at around ten dollars.
So, if on-campus dining ever wears you down, and it will, remember that there are some great al
ternatives just a Marguerite ride away. These restaurants come in very handy, when it becomes hard to
swallow down "casserole delight" or another bowl of cereal for dinner.
