Three quarters lie ahead, but
just think of all the weekends
that means. You've mastered the
Stanford lingo, adjusted to black
squirrels, and have even man
aged to get in a bike accident.
While mastering the twelve
Herculean tasks that could be
popping up anytime soon, why
not stock up on twelve
Herculean pleasures?
Some consider being under 21
an obstacle of Herculean propor
tions. However, many Stanford
students of all ages have turned to
the Stanford dance division for
their kicks. Indeed Stanford's so
cial dance classes are so popular
that your first piece of dance gear
may actually be a sleeping bag,

due to the pre-enrollment camp-out. While social dance classes are a blast, if you don't man
age to get into one at first, there are plenty of other on campus dance opportunities. Every
month there are regularly scheduled Jammix dances in Roble gym, where you can practice
everything from East Coast swing to line dancing. Dance enthusiasts can also attend special
events such as the the elegant Viennese Ball, the swinging Ragtime Ball and Jitterbug Jam, and
the sleep-defying all-nighter, Big Dance, where you can watch Stanford's Vintage Dance
Ensemble in action. For $20, the Stanford Ballroom Dance Club offers a wide range of classes
at beginning through advanced levels on Sunday afternoons, and provides opportunities to
explore the Bay Area dance scene. Class sign-ups start cm Sunday, Oct. 4.
Another challenge for orientation week may involve figuring out which A cappella group
to audition for (and getting up the gumption to give it a shot). Picking out which groups to
audition for may prove just as difficult as picking a favorite group to listen to, and the fresh
man orientation A Cappella Fest makes the decision even harder. The eight groups on cam-

pus are Counterpoint, Everyday People, Fleet Street, the Harmonics, the Mendicants, Mixed
Company, Talisman and Testimony, each with their own distinct style. A cappella groups
will lie in White Flaza during the upcoming week, giving demonstrations and information
and taking sign-ups for auditions during the week of September 21st.
For more audience-oriented a cappella fans, the groups can be heard regularly perform
ing at dorms and campus events, including their own seasonal mccrts. On October 23, the
Mendicants will be performing their 35th anniversary concert, u will be featuring the vo
cal stylings of their fellow a cappella groups as well.
"Finding your passion," is another enormous task, so get prq ired for four years of pas
sion-searching and inspirational encouragement. However, if your calling seems indefin
able, why not try looking for it in an art, drama, or music class on campus?
The Art Department offers both classroom and studio art courses in painting, sculpture,
design, printmaking and photography, as well as courses through the Stanford University
Digital Art Center (SUDAC). For the dramatically-inspired, the Drama Department offers in
troductory classes, as well as productions open to student auditions. The Stanford Improvisors
also provide an outlet for entertainers and viewers alike, while Big Game Gaieties, a student
written musical to raise spirit before Big Game, focuses on eternal themes and existential ques
tions such as, "Why does Cal suck?" Gaieties auditions are open to all students.
While it might feel like a huge task to find a ride to the City (San Francisco for all of you
newbies), we're only a Caltrain trip away. San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art is cur
rently hosting an incredible exhibit on Alexander Calder's work, with over 250 of his pieces,
including his famous mobiles, stabiles and portraits made of wire, along with his paintings
and jewelry creations. For those who would prefer an open-air art experience, the San
Francisco's Mission District is a walk-in gallery. Precita Eyes Mural Arts Center offers walk
ing tours every Saturday at 1:30, with professional muralists as guides. Call (415) 285-2287
for more information.
Without question, seeing a professional production in San Francisco is always a major
treat. "Miss Saigon" will be playing at the Orpheum Theater through Nov. 29, and "Stomp",
a percussion-based dance troupe that turns matchboxes into musical instruments, will also
be showing through Sept. 27 at the Golden Gate Theater. For tickets to either show, call the
BASS ticket office at (415) 776-1999.
So, while managing school work can certainly be trying, perhaps the greatest task of all
will be choosing from the plethora of pleasures at Stanford and in the Bay Area.
