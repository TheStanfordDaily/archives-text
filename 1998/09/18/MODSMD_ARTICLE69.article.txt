When you're seized by the urge to get off
campus and soak in a couple of hours of vi
olence, action, or improbable romance, what
could be better than a movie?
A movie is just the right thing to get your
mind off the rigors of Stanford life and
whisk you away from the confines of cam
pus. Just your luck, there are a number of
theaters in the Stanford vicinity.
Just a few blocks from campus on the cor
ner of El Camino and Page Mill, the Palo
Alto Square Theater is nestled within a for
est of office buildings. And just down the
road in Menlo Park are the Guild and Park
Theaters. They generally show popular inde
pendent films in their theaters. Recent
showings included "The Governess" and
"Next Stop, Wonderland." They can be a bit
pricey ($7.50 for general admission), but the
Square has cool reclining plush seats and
they all show great films.

The Stanford Theater is an old-fashioned the
ater from the golden days of movies, complete
with an overhanging balcony and an organ
that plays during intermission. Showing only
films from before 1960, this is a great place to
catch Gone with the Wind or a Humphrey
Bogart festival.
Stanford Theater

The Aquarius shows an eclectic mix of films
in small but cozy theaters. Showings include
current independent features and older cult
classics. Look out for their midnight show
ings of films from our youth.

When you want the mainstream
megaplex movie experience, Mercado
20 is within 20 minutes driving distance of
campus. Built just a couple of years ago, the
Mercado boasts comfy stadium seating. Less
appealing are the consistently packed park
ing lots and lengthy lines. Beat the rush by
ordering your tickets in advance over the
phone or opting for the matinees. Or arrive
early, purchase your tickets and hang out at
any of the nearby trendy eateries, including
World Wrapps, Noah's Bagels, Starbucks,
Tomatina and a sushi bar.

A closer theater that's just as mainstream,
but a little older and lacking the student dis
count, is the Century Cinema 16, better
known as simply "Shoreline," in Mountain
View off the 101. Here are the details:

A handy Internet resource for Bay Area
movies and theaters, is http://www.justgo.
com/bayarea. This comprehensive web site

lists reviews of recently released movies, when
and where they're playing, theater addresses,
phone numbers, maps, and so on. But always
call ahead for movie timesâ€”sometimes the
theater listings are not current.
