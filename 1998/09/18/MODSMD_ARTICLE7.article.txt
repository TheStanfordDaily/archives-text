# Parking for free?
## New Far East permit on Bowdoin 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
In an effort to alleviate over
crowding problems in campus
parking lots. Transportation Ser
vices will issue free parking permits
along Bowdoin St.and Searsville
Rd. for certain East and West cam
pus residents.
The permit targets East Cam
pus residents living in Wilbur Hall,
Stern Hall, Branner Hall, Toyon
Hall and Manzanita Park, and
West residents in Lyman Graduate
Residence and Governor's Cor
ner. Normally, a nine-month per
mit would cost $70.
Officials at Transportation Ser
vices hope that the prospect of free
parking will lure residents away

from the crowded parking lots that
run adjacent to these residences
and toward the under-used lots on
East campus's Bowdoin and West
campus's Searsville.
"This is essentially for people
who don't use their cars very
often," said Susan Law, parking
and transit operations coordinator.
"If they're not using their cars
every day. they can afford to park
farther away, which frees up spaces
for students who are using their
cars every day." V
If residents in the specific jiftet
and West residences do not s"how
interest in the new permit. Trans
portation Services will then offer jt
to other residences, such as
mta Court and Roble Hall in WeSt
campus and Cowell Cluster in feast
campus.
However, Transportation Ser
vices officials do not feel that this
situation will arise. "We're antici
pating that the Bowdoin and
Searsville permits are going to go
fast," Law said. "I don't think it will
he necessary to extend the offer to
other residences. Plus, Cowell al
ready has a fairly big parking lot,
and Lagunita and Roble residents
would have a long way to go for the
Searsville lot."
The new lots are currently being
renovated to make them safer.
"Right now, more lights and pay
phones are being put in." said
Terry Fitzpatrick, who works in
customer service with Transporta
tion Services.
In addition to increased parking
on these two streets, an under-uti
lized volleyball court between
Stern and Wilbur Halls will be con
verted into a temporary parking
lot. Toyon's parking lot has been
re-striped to provide 30 more park
ing slots, and Transportation Ser
vices is putting up new decals on
roads and parking lots to make it
clear what type of permit is allowed
in each area.
The need for additional parking
became evident by the end of last
spring. Law said. With the notifica
tion that Crothers Memorial would
be housing twice as many students,
Transportation Services officials
felt that more parking would be
come necessary. Also, complaints
from students, as well as observa
tions made by transportation offi
cials, pointed to a severe lack of
parking. Transportation Services
began formulating the new permit
scheme this summer.
"I think that these new parking
spots will really help with the over
crowding," Law said.
Transportation Services does
not have plans to increase parking
spots for south residences, simply
because there are no under-used
lots in that area of campus to use.
"[Bowdoin and Searsville] were
two areas that were open, and no
one was parking there," Law said.
"We don't have lots like that in
South Campus, so the present situ
ation will have to remain."
Law believes that the increase in
the number of buildings and stu

dents in the past few years has
caused the lack of parking on cam
pus.
"Six to seven years ago, parking
was easy to find." she said. "But
we've seen in the past couple of
years that buildings go up, often on
parking lots, which not only re
duces parking but also increases
people. People get pushed to fur
ther and further parking lots, and
both commuters and residents suf
fer as a result."
Despite the current problems
with parking. Law says that the sit

uation is "really great" in compari
son to other schools' parking. In a
recent survey of universities na
tionwide conducted by Transporta
tion Services, officials found that
when measuring a ratio of parking
places to number of people, Stan
ford was in the top one-third, with a
ratio of 0.6.
Schools such as UC-Berkeley
and Harvard had ratios of 0.2 and
0.17, respectively, whereas UC-
Irvine had a ratio of 1.08, which
Law attributes to the fact that it is a
commuter school.
