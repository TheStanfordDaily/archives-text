## New Far East permit on Bowdoin 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
In an effort to alleviate over
crowding problems in campus
parking lots. Transportation Ser
vices will issue free parking permits
along Bowdoin St.and Searsville
Rd. for certain East and West cam
pus residents.
The permit targets East Cam
pus residents living in Wilbur Hall,
Stern Hall, Branner Hall, Toyon
Hall and Manzanita Park, and
West residents in Lyman Graduate
Residence and Governor's Cor
ner. Normally, a nine-month per
mit would cost $70.
Officials at Transportation Ser
vices hope that the prospect of free
parking will lure residents away

from the crowded parking lots that
run adjacent to these residences
and toward the under-used lots on
East campus's Bowdoin and West
campus's Searsville.
"This is essentially for people
who don't use their cars very
often," said Susan Law, parking
and transit operations coordinator.
"If they're not using their cars
every day. they can afford to park
farther away, which frees up spaces
for students who are using their
cars every day." V
If residents in the specific jiftet
and West residences do not s"how
interest in the new permit. Trans
portation Services will then offer jt
to other residences, such as
mta Court and Roble Hall in WeSt
campus and Cowell Cluster in feast
