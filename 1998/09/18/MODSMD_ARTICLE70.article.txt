Parties and football games might be fun, but
every cardinal-wearing, philosophy-spouting
Palo Altan knows coffeehouses are the crux of a
university town's culture. Whether you're scout
ing for a place to take the good-looking guy in
your CIV section or just seeking solace from
campus life, it is tough to survive without
knowing where to seek your next caffeine fix.
Luckily for you, Palo Alto has a plethora of java
elixir breweries all over the map.
Caffe Verona
236 Hamilton Av«.
Less-known than its counterparts on
University Avenue, Caffc Verona is a bakery,
Italian restaurant and coffee shop all under
the same roof. Clientele tends to be older and
louder than average, especially toward dinner
time. Though a bit pricey, Caffe Verona serves
a fabulous mocha and has the best customer
service in the caffeine files. It also offers some
interesting house specialties. Steamed cran
berry juice, anyone?
Moonbean's
In Front of Groon Library
It's 8 p.m. the night before a midterm. You
promised yourself you'd stay at the library
until at least 10 p.m., but your eyelids have
been drooping since 6:30. If only you had
some caffeine to coerce a second wind from
your fading brain .... Moonbean's has been
making pre-meds' study dreams come true
since last spring, despite the mediocre quality
of its offerings. Beware the Creen librarians,
though; they've become increasingly hostile
to students' smuggling efforts.
Printer's Inc.
320 S. California Avt.
If you've been trying to decide whether it's
worth the trouble to have a car at Stanford,
Printer's Inc. should tip the scale. Too far
from campus for walking or biking, this
bookstore/coffee shop hybrid boasts the best
latt£ and third-best mocha in the caffeine
files. It's quiet without austerity, welcoming
without hubbub, and has an extensive menu.
The only drawback? Avoid Printer's Inc. if
you need to be in and out in a hurry; sometimes
they take a while to make espresso drinks and
the bookstore can definitely be a distraction.
Starbucks
276 University Avt.
When it comes to coffee, people don't want
change or innovation. They just want what
they know. And despite your personal or po
litical sentiments about corporations, it's hard
to dispute that from Seattle to Boston,
Starbucks usually offers consistently high
quality. This place offers the darkest,
strongest, most flavorful brew around.
But the Starbucks on University is not a
"usual" Starbucks. They have a knack for cut
ting corners, which can mean anything from

large ice chunks in a frappuccino to a bitter
latt£ because a shot has been left out too long.
But out of habit, most people still go there far
more than any other shop around.
Our advice: Get fresh beans ground in the
store and invest in a trusty coffee maker. Then
go home and make yourself a pot of steaming
hot heaven.
Torrefazione Italia
419 Univtrsity Av«.
As its name suggests, Torrefazione Italia is
not a shop for casual coffee drinkers. The
shots are strong, the mochas are unsweetened,
and you're more likely to hear Italian opera
than soft jazz or mild alternative. The interior
is small, so seating more than two is awkward
unless you snag one of the second-story ta
bles. Best to sharpen your teeth on
Moonbean's or the Co Ho a few times first.
University Coffee Cafe
271 Unhrtrsify Ave.
Brimming with cheery twenty- and thir
tysomethings, University Coffee Cafe is a great
place to go with a group, especially at night.
This airy cafe has the best atmosphere a coffee
house could offer—high cathedral ceilings,
huge windows and jazz in the background.
While the black coffee isn't anything to
write home about, the mochas, and
other espresso drinks are the richest and
creamiest in Palo Alto (even the non-fat
ones). The apple cider is unquestionably the
best in town. When the place closes, they have
to turn on a bright overhead light, shoo peo
ple out and hum "Closing Time." And you'd
think being across the street from Starbucks
would hurt business.
The Stanford Coffee House
Tresidder Union
If you haven't already ventured to the Co
Ho, you soon will. Stanford's very own coffee
house has a great location — a happy little
bike ride from all corners of the Stanford
globe. Good for them, and for us. The Co Ho
serves strong coffee for the purist, affordable
latt£s for trendies, and yummy frosty mints

(hot chocolate and mint syrup over ice) for
everyone's sweet tooth. You can't go wrong.
Also, it is open super late — a plus for those
nights when the library and the dorm are less
than inviting.
Cafe Borrone
1010 El Camino Red
A favorite among local high school stu
dents and execs alike, Borrone's (as it's more
commonly known), next to Kepler's book
store in Menlo Park, is packed morning,
noon, and night. Patio tables always go first,
but Borrone's just finished expanding, so you
never have to wait long.
Borrone's makes the best espresso drink
imaginable—the frosted mocha. It's a mix of
espresso, ice cream and other good things,
and it comes with super-fattening whipped
cream. Share it with a friend if you must, but
definitely try one. If that doesn't fill you up,
go for a sandwich or salad—everything on
the menu is good, if a bit expensive.
Palo Alto Coffee Roasting Company
Stanford Shopping Conttr
Deep in the heart of the Stanford Shopping
Center is the Palo Alto Coffee Roasting
Company. It's across from Tiffany's—a con
venient location for all you big spenders. This
is less a coffeehouse than a coffee stop: Pass in
one door uncaffeinated and leave through the
other with a good, strong drink.
While flavored at most coffee places
are overly sweet, these are just right. The
PACRC also offers such interesting combina
tions as banana mochas and Frangelico latt£s.
Take a breather from window shopping and
sit at one of the courtyard tables, where you
can watch overdressed shoppers max out
their credit cards.
