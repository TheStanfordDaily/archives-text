My freshman year at the Farm,
I heard that ray favorite band, Bad
Religion, was coming to The Edge
the night before the first day of
classes. My parents urged me not
to go, thinking that the experience
would leave me fatigued on that
critical morning of lectures. Eager
to assert my upcoming indepen
dence, I purchased my ticket
months in advance, declaring that
I would be there no matter what
After that show, and many
others, I have concluded that The
Edge is the best place a Stanford
student can go to see a punk
show, especially for a taste of al
ternative culture for an evening.
The club features excellent
acoustics, while the lights en
hance performances without
turning them into laser shows.
Crowd surfing and moshing is
tolerated and frequent Every so
often the mosh-pit often takes on
a life of its own, churning punks
around like a washing machine.
Most of the bouncers at The
Edge tend to be pretty cool, just
as long as the audience does not
get out of hand. National acts
and local favorites are brought in
regularly and fans vary widely.
The atmosphere at the Reverend
Horton Heat and Descendents
shows, for example, was laid
back and good-spirited, while the
Deftones Cans were mostly hos
tile, run-of-the-mill pricks. At
most shows there is a wide vari
ety of people ranging from wide
eyed Palo Alto High freshmen to
21-year-old bar lizards to grey
haired punk diehards.
A word to the wise: Try not to
bring any valuables. Even watches
can disappear if you're in the mid
dle of a crowd. Dollar bills and ID
cards should be tucked into your
socks. Don't even bother showing
up if you have a problem with
sweat, tight spaces or cigarettes.
But none of this mattered after
that first Bad Religion show.
Holding my new Bad Religion
poster gently in my left hand and
the handlebars of my bike with
my right, I slowly peddled back to
Flo Mo. My legs were absolutely
dead from the long night of
moshing and slamming, and it
didn't help that I forgot how to
get back to my dorm. Even a few
hours of relaxation and a good
shower failed to rid my body of
the stench of cigarettes or the
ringing in my ears.
The year was off to a great start.
