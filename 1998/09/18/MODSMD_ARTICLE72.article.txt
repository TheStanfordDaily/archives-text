CC t-\ ounders," starring Matt
XvDamon, Edward Norton,
and ostensibly Gretchen Mol,

opened in theaters on Friday. When the
closing credits rolled, most of the audience was kicking
itself—after all, how can you blame a movie about ly
ing, cheating, stealing and gambling for having a mis
leading trailer?
"Rounders" is not, as the trailers imply, a story
about a good young man whose past catches up with
him. Nor is it a story about him being forced to choose
between poker and the woman he loves. The movie ex
ploits that pitch to get Damon's character into the
game, but from that point on it is a formula gambling
movie, with just about every cliche in the book.
Damon plays Mike, a young man putting himself
through law school with his gambling winnings. His
girlfriend, played by Gretchen Mol, makes him leave
the gambling world after he loses his life savings to a
Russian mobster, played with bizarre flair by John
Malkovich. All is well and good, until his friend Worm
(Edward Norton) gets out of prison, ru n s into trouble,
loses first his own money and then Mike's, and forces
Mike back into the game in order to save both of them.
And then, basically, there's a whole lot of people eyeing
each other across the table.
Mike is the only fully developed character.
Malkovich is cartoonish, sometimes hilarious but al

ways odd. Mol, for all her screen time in the trailers, is
little more than a facet of the life Mike leaves to return
to poker. Norton as Worm, the shady friend, is disap
pointing and one-dimensional. Some scenes that may
have fleshed him out looked to have been cut for more
card-playing time.
For all that, though, Damon is worth watching.
His voice-overs throughout the film are a mix of the
insightful and the distracting, but always reveal
where his character is headed—back to the table, the
only life he really loves.
Director John Dahl does some interesting work
with color and light. The glitzy yellow of a streetlight
is effectively contrasted with the somber gold of power
and wealth. Dahl illuminates characters' faces at
poignant times, revealing those subtleties that the
script can't. The gambling scenes are fast-paced and
well-done. No over-the-top cinematography, no crazy
card tricks. Just good solid poker and all the psycho
logical warfare that goes along with it.
This is not a particularly deep or original movie.
The final moral seems to be that if you're really good at
gambling and taking the money of less experienced
players, go right ahead. If you can get past that, then
"Rounders" is a good character gambling story that
doesn't pull any punches.
