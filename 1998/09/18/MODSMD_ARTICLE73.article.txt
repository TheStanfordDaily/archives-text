Do you like heartwarming, tear-jerking stories
about courage, heroism, and friendship?
Didn't think so. It's too bad, then, that "Simon
Birch" has the mission to climb out of that particu
lar stereotype, but doesn't quite manage it.
The movie flip-flops disconcertingly between
schmaltzy and smart, and you can tell which im
pression director Mark Steven Johnson is aiming
for. His adaptation of John Irving's" A Prayer for
Owen Meany" is so loose that the author requested a
name change for the title character.
Our hero, played by newcomer lan Michael Smith,
is a Lilliputian twelve-year-old whose very survival is
considered a medical miracle. We see Simon every
where with his best friend Joe (Joseph Mazzello).
Adding a carefully calculated ray of sunshine into the
film is Joe's beautiful, compassionate and scandalously
young mother Rebecca (Ashley Judd), who has refused
to reveal the name of Joe's father thus beginning Joe's
problems. And the kindly father figure is provided by
Ben (Oliver Piatt), one of Rebecca's beaux.
The plot of the movie is meandering and not
nearly as interesting as simply watching the charac
ters interact. Johnson is obviously pushing for a
tear-jerker, but luckily for us, his talented cast keeps
the movie from getting too melodramatic.
Sprinkling the best zingers throughout "Simon
Birch" is Smith himself. He is the film's most delight
ful surprise as a wisecracking, smart-mouthed kid
who holds nothing sacred (especially himself) —and
at the same time, is deeply religious. As Simon, Smith
manages to handle the paradox almost effortlessly,
mixing adolescent impudence with a quiet conviction
that God has a plan for him.

Unfortunately, Smith is the only character given an interesting part to play. The rest
of the cast works valiantly with the conventional roles they're given: Mazzello as the
devoted friend whose life is forever changed by Simon; Judd as the perfect woman and
tragic figure; Piatt as the Really Nice Guy.

When we get to the Big Sentimental Ending the schmaltz takes over completely
and the formula is revealed. The clever comic touch that prevailed in the beginning is
abandoned, and you can almost feel the director's hand pushing the film into teary
melodrama. The sappiness can be forgiven, though, in light of the excellent work by
the cast. Smith alone is reason enough to go see "Simon Birch."
