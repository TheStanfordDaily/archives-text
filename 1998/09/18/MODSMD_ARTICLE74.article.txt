# A 						poor choice of 'Friends'

It tried to be shocking. It tried to be witty. It tried to be "In the Company of Men," director Neil Laßute's scathing film
about chauvinists in the business world and the havoc they can wreak. But Laßute's follow-up film, "Your Friends and
Neighbors," is not in a league as lofty as that of his directorial debut. Laßute is a visionary with great promise, which shows
through momentarily throughout his latest effort. However, his characters ring horribly untrue and are ultimately un
pleasant to watch.
Laßute starts the film with a confession from one of the characters: his best lover is himself, and he is the only one who
can truly gratify his sexual needs. The risqu6 aspect of this movie is magnified as friends and neighbors develop relation
ships with one another. Sometimes, Laßute hits it right on the mark—as in a testosterone-bonding sequence with the
three male leads in a shower room—and you really understand that each character lives a selfish and limited existence.

But Laßute tries too hard to make us feel aghast and astonished. There is too big a gap between what may have been a great screenplay and what became a flat film.
Something may be scathing on paper, but it can elicit a totally different reaction on the big screen. I sat there squirming uneasily—not in a good way, as I had during
in"In the Company of Men."
Another problem 1 had with "Your Friends and Neighbors" was its deliberate attempt at humor. Jokes about sex, masturbation and adultery may be funny and mean
ingful to some people—including several top critics. But I had serious problems with these subjects being portrayed in a nonchalant manner.

It just wasn't humorous or involving to watch people stab each
other in the back with affairs and vicious comments. The biting
tone of "In the Company of Men" was well-merited and under
standable in the context of the characters in the movie. But here,
the eagerness to hurt does not ring true.
Aaron Eckhart, who stunned audiences as the evil businessman
in LaBute's first film, is the most sympathetic character. His wife
begins a sexual relationship with another character, and he is left
out in the cold about her actions. Other gifted actors, most no
tably Ben Stiller and Nastassja Kinski, share screen time with
Eckhart in this ensemble comedy. But I didn't feel the magic of "In
the Company of Men" at work here; instead, I watched a movie
with a bigger budget and bigger names, with nothing valuable for
them to say or do.
