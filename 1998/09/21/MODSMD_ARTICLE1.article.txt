## Football: Cash back? 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
This fall, new season ticket hold
ers are being offered a money-back
guarantee. And Saturday's perfor
mance against North Carolina may
go some way toward preventing

fans from taking advantage of it.
In a new effort to attract more
season ticket holders, the Stanford
Athletics Department and its mar
keting division have created the
"Gridiron Guarantee." If the new
ticket holders are in any way dissat
isfied at the end of the vear, thev

can receive their money back.
"It's an effort to expand outside
of the nucleus of the 22,(XX) ticket
holders we already have," said
Robert Carruesco, assistant athlet
ic director in charge of marketing

and ticket sales.
According to Carruesco, who
came up with the idea of the guaran
tee, this is a "no-strings-attached"
offer that hopes to attract a larger fan
base to Stanford games from the Bay
Area, where there is a plethora of
athletic events to attend.
The promotional fliers given to
first-time season ticket buyers claim
that "If at the end of the season you
do not feel that you received your
value for the ticket, Stanford Athlet
ics will refund the price paid for the
season ticket."
The focus of the offer is to give
new fans a sample of the entertain
ment value a Stanford football game
has. Carruesco hopes that the flavor
of games, including pre-game tailgat
ing and half-time entertainment, will
sell themselves to happy customers.
Although the numbers of season
ticket holders have been high in the
past couple of years, Carruesco
pointed out that that strength is in
part a result of the home game sched
ule. And this year, with Big Game
being played at UC-Berkeley and the
lack of a home game against Notre
©aflle, keeping up scason-ticket
sales would have been harder.

To increase the entertainment at
games, the half-time shows offered
this year are promised to he more
professional and enjoyable. Already,
games have featured dogs who catch
Frisbees, renowned high school
bands and a troupe of Polynesian
dancers, in addition to the always en
tertaining Stanford Band.
In coming games, fans will see
"Band Day," which will feature over
1 (XK) members of high school bands
from all over the Bay Area on the
field with the Stanford Band. They
will also receive a Beanie Baby of our
beloved mascot, the Tree.
In a similar vein, Cal is making an
offer to its season ticket holders that
includes a cellular phone valued at
around $150. Carruesco said that the
(i rid iron Guarantee was not moti
vated by Cal's offer.
()f course, there is always the pos
sibilitv that an unsuccessful season
could lead to a rush of refund de
mands, but Carruesco wasn't wor
ried.
"The spirit of the offer is the
entertainment value.. .'lTiegoalisto
give the ticket holders a good all
around time and not to ensure the
final score," Ik- said.

contain one small disclaimer: since
