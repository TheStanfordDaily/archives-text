## Football: Cash back? 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
This fall, new season ticket hold
ers are being offered a money-back
guarantee. And Saturday's perfor
mance against North Carolina may
go some way toward preventing

fans from taking advantage of it.
In a new effort to attract more
season ticket holders, the Stanford
Athletics Department and its mar
keting division have created the
"Gridiron Guarantee." If the new
ticket holders are in any way dissat
isfied at the end of the vear, thev

can receive their money back.
"It's an effort to expand outside
of the nucleus of the 22,(XX) ticket
holders we already have," said
Robert Carruesco, assistant athlet
ic director in charge of marketing
