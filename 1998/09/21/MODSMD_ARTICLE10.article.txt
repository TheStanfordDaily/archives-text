Malaysian leader arrested
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) â€” Malaysia's
sacked deputy prime minister was arrested late Sun
day after thousands of his supporters marched to the
prime minister's house and demanded the ouster of
Asia's longest-serving leader.
Hundreds of Anwar Ibrahim's allies shouted angri
ly, "God is great!" and "Long live Anwar!" shaking
their fists as police led him away from the house where
he had conducted almost two weeks of protest rallies
against the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
The violence sullied a state visit by Queen Eliza
beth 11, who worshipped at a church not far from a
mass opposition rally Sunday and was to meet with
Mahathir on Monday.

Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is
now his principal foe. His arrest appeared to be an
attempt to thwart the kind of large-scale protests ear
lier this year that led to the ouster of Indonesia's Pres
ident Suharto, 77.
Mahathir, 72, became Asia's longest-serving leader
after Suharto was forced out in May after 32 years by
violent protests against alleged government corrup
tion and a severe economic crisis.
Anwar was led away Sunday from his home and
pushed into a van by police carrying assault rifles and
firing tear gas to break up the crowd.
Helmeted special reserve police, armed with
assault rifles, parked jeeps in front of Anwar's house
and blocked off roads in the well-heeled neighbor
hood to prevent his supporters from marching after
the van.
