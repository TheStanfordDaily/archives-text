# U.S., Japan to study defense
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Con
cerned about North Korea's ballistic
missile development, the United
States and Japan agreed Sunday to
conduct joint research on a missile
defense system that could protect
the island nation from attack.
"No one should doubt our com
mitment to defend our interests and
to work together for peace and sta
bility in Asia," Defense Secretary
William Cohen said at a joint news
conference with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and their
Japanese counterparts. "And this is
the best way to protect both the
United States and Japan."

The United States has 100,000
troops in the region, about one-third
of them guarding the always tense
demilitarized zone between North
and South Korea.
Sunday's agreement comes after
North Korea launched a rocket over
Japan on Aug. 31 in a failed attempt
to send a satellite into orbit. It was
the latest example of Pyongyang's
aggressive program to develop long
range missiles that could one day hit
American shores, U.S. officials said.
Japan has conducted preliminary
studies, some with the United
States, on ways to defend against
missiles. The United States is devel

oping several theater missile
defense systems as well, although «
American scientists haven't been
able to overcome technological hur
dies to knock a fast-moving target J
out of the sky.
Now, the United States and
Japan will work together on £
research and development, which >
could lead to a missile defense sys- >
tem in the future. No target date was >
set.
"Our two countries will spare no s
efforts" to improve defense and I
security in the region, said Japanese •$
Foreign Affairs Minister Masahiko ']
Komura.
