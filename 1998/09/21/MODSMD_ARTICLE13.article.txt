## Editor's Welcome Improving the Daily 
### 
I MUST LOVE this job. This is the third
year in a row that I've come hack from
the summer and immediately absorbed
myself in the rhythm and the atmosphere of
this office, the work I do, and the people I
do it with.
In the time I've been here, I've become
extremely attuned to our ways of doing
things and our procedures, and there are a
lot of jobs here I could do in my sleep.
As long as I'm here, I'm in my element.
And just as 1 start to pat myself on the back
for fitting so abruptly
realize that such a comfortable state of
affairs isn't the solution, it's the problem.
We're too comfortable.
I'll admit, it's a strange kind of comfort
able. It's a kind of comfortable that consists
of extremely late nights, a constant atmo
sphere of near-crisis and a good deal of
physical exhaustion.
This may sound nerve-racking and not at
all comfortable, but after a while it becomes
routine, and routine is by nature comfort
able. The problems may be annoying, but
we've seen them before and we know how
to deal with them. Even headaches can be
comfortable if they're familiar. In this crazy
but comfortable routine, we get caught up
in the minutiae of daily production and lose
our sense of the big picture.
Losing the big picture is a big problem.
A lot of the time, we content ourselves with
being fed information and perspectives on
the issue by the parties involved, be it the
administration or a student group or any
one else.
! We know what everyone else thinks
about the issue, but we don't have a clear
idea of what's going on. so we can't give the
Reader either meaningful presentations of
facts or informed opinions.
This means the majority of our commu
nity often remains basically uninformed,
and the eventual solution only caters to the
needs of the people who have the most
power or make the most noise.
Over the past few years, there have been

a lot of profound changes in what kind of a
university Stanford is. I think the result
would have been different in most of those
cases if the bulk of the community had been
given a coherent presentation of the facts.
That was our job, and there have been
many times when we didn't do it.
Often, we are content with this kind of
less-than-inlormative reporting because it's
easy and it gives us time to get on with solv
ing the everyday little crises, which we
\cnow how to do and wKidh generally seems
like quite enough work, thank you very
much.
But giving people the facts shouldn't be
a comfortable, easy affair. The world being
the kind of place it is, if people know all the
facts about a situation, chances are they're
going to be mad about it.
Running a newspaper means agitating
people, but how are we supposed to agitate
people if we're too comfortably absorbed in
our own daily routine?
Most of the job of getting us out of this
comfort zone is up to my staff and me. We
have to run a smooth, efficient operation so
that we aren't constantly answering alarm
bells in the office and ending up too tired to
take a fresh look at an issue.
Hut there's a part you can do as well.
Expect more of us: If we write about an
issue and you think we've missed the point,
tell us what you think the point is.
And, of course, I encourage you to come
and work for the Daily, whether you do lit
tle or a lot. But if that's not what does it for
you, then at least take the opportunity to
agitate us a bit when we need it, and we'll
do the same for you. If that's the way it ends
up working, then I'll know I've done my
job.
