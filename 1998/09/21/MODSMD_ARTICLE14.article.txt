## Maren Norton Making the most of Stanford 
### 
AS 1 WAS un
packing the other
day, I suddenly
realized that the mound
of T-shirts in my middle
drawer could adequately
sum up my Stanford
experience: Class of 1999,

Frosh Thank-a-Thon, Orientation Volun
teer, Soto, Slavianskii Dom, Okada, Stan
ford Women's Basketball, Men's Final
Four, 98th Big Game, 99th Big Game,
l()0th Big Game, Stanford In Washington,
ASSU, Stanford Athletics Department,
Stanford Special Olympics, T for Tree,
Frisbee Golf, Axe Committee, Flicks, and
the countless free T-shirts you get when
you fill out those credit card applications
in the front of the Bookstore.
Those T-shirts are constant reminders
of all this school means to me: friends,
good times, academic opportunities and
the chance to serve others. Your stack of
shirts won't look the same as mine, but the
memories they represent will mean similar
things to you.
I hope you all soon realize that Stan
ord isn't about packing a resume, it's

about experiencing life. Do what makes
you happy.
If student government isn't your style,
give a community service group a try. So
you're not a premedical student. Try polit
ical science. If you don't like sports, then
maybe you'll dig KZSU. And if you're
really daring, you can even try cracking a
book now and then.
I'm not so naive that I think that Stan
ford is perfect. I get frustrated with this
place sometimes. There are things 1 would
like to see change. Things that I'm com
mitted to changing.
Already this change has begun. That's
what the ASSU is here to make happen.
But we can't do it without you. We rely on
your input and welcome your feedback.
To make fall quarter run a bit more
smoothly for you, we've been busy this
summer working on a number of projects.
Take, for instance, those Scantron class
evaluation sheets you fill out at the end of
every quarter. They've finally been put to
use. The new Course Guide not only com
bines the Time Schedule and Bulletin but
also contains student comments and
graphs for over 2,000 undergraduate class

es. Check out the site at http://assu.stan
ford.edu/guide/.
Speaking of new web sites, you should
also check out http://start.stanford.edu/.
It's a fully customizable start page and cal
endar for you, your group or your dormi
tory, where the information you get is the
information you want.
Also watch for upcoming changes to
Tresidder to be announced next week.
We are working hard on concrete
changes to serve Stanford students better.
My father once told me, "In all you do and
with everyone you meet, give it 110 per
cent." That's what I'm trying to do. I'm
giving everything I have to this school and
having the most incredible time.
I encourage you to do likewise. Give it
everything you have. Create your own
diverse and exciting experiences.
Creating change requires navigating
through the University and tailoring the
ASSU to capture each of our talents. We
cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust
our sails.

Maren Norton, a senior majoring in political
science, currently serves as ASSU president.
