## It's Miller's Time Card pulls off first win 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
One kick, and everything was
good again.
Sure, there are still some prob
lems that the football team needs to
address. Tackling is still giving head
coach Tyrone Willingham fits, and
while the offensive line did a better
job of opening gaps for the running
game, there is still some work to be
done.
But when senior Kevin Miller's
game-winning 20-yard field goal
sailed through the uprights as time
ran out, the Cardinal (1-2,0-1 Pacific
10 Conference) had a 37-34 victory
— its first of the year — against
North Carolina (0-2), and a chance to
start fresh again.
Miller had hit two field goals ear
lier in the game, and the pressure
mounted as the Tar Heels used all
three of their timeouts with two sec

onds left in order to give him more
time to think about the situation.
But Miller could think only one
thing: "Just make the kick and go
home."
And he did.
"By the time they called three
[timeouts], it was bordering on
ridiculous," Miller said. "I just did my
best to keep my mind clear.
"I guess I should have looked up
and realized they had three timeouts
left."
With All-American flanker Troy
Walters sidelined with an ankle in
jury, Willingham needed key players
to step up, and they did.

Todd Husak came out with a scorch
ing performance in the first half,
completing 16 of 24 passes for 227
yards and one touchdown en route to
a 20-13 halftime lead.
"I think we came out with a great
game plan," Husak said. "[Offensive

coordinator Bill] Diedrick did a great
job of laying things out for us.
"Execution-wise this was the best
thing all year. The line stepped up
and the receivers got open."
Senior Jeff Allen, who had only
two career receptions before Satur
day's game, pulled in five passes for
111 yards and a touchdown.
"Jeff Allen stepped up really huge
for our team," Willingham said. "I
don't think I could be happier for a
young man than 1 was to see Jeff step
up."
But the biggest plays came when
Stanford needed them the most.
The Tar Heels had the ball with 59
seconds left and the game tied at 34
when freshman quarterback Ronald
Curry ran down the left sideline.

Placekicker Kevin Miller watches as his game-winning field goal sails through the uprights, delivering a
37-34 Cardinal victory against North Carolina. The kick gave Stanford its first win of the season.
Howard recovered the fumble.
Husak was knocked out of the
game on the next play after passing to
running back Coy Wire for a four
yard loss, and Willingham went to
backup Joe Borchard.
The redshirt freshman ended up
delivering big on his first play from
scrimmage as he ran 41 yards to the
UNC four-yard line to set up Miller's
decisive kick.
"I was supposed to fake and roll
out to the right," Borchard said.
"They contained me on the right side,
I saw a big hole [up the middle] and
the next thing I knew there was 40
yards of green grass in front of me."
Husak was simply dazed and did
not suffer any serious injury. He ex
pects to be starting for Stanford again
next week.
The Cardinal capitalized on
North Carolina's mistakes through
out the game, converting four Tar
Heel turnovers into three touch
downs and the final field goal.
"I'm not happy and it starts with
me," said UNC head coach Carl Tor
bush. "We made some mistakes that
need to be corrected.
"We have to play more consistent.
I saw a lot of great things on the field
today. But we're athletic enough on
defense that we have to make the
plays. And the time to do that is now."
The Cardinal stretched its half
time lead to 27-13 on a halfback op
tion pass from redshirt freshman Coy
Wire to a wide-open Deßonnie Pitts
in the end zone.
The Tar Heels came back to tie
the score at 27, but freshman Kory
Bailey fumbled on a punt return and
Cardinal cornerback Frank Primus
recovered the ball at the Tar Heel 33-
yard line.
Three plays later, Wire ran the
ball in from the one-yard line to give
Stanford a 34-27 lead.
Bailey made amends for his mis
take when he caught a 19-yard pass
from Curry in the end zone to even
the score.

But the Cardinal came out with its
first team and the young team finally
has reason to celebrate.
"I think with every game a young

team's going to get better," Husak said.
"Once the young guys see what college
football's all about, I'm sure they'll
come in and make the big plays."

Cardinal to its first victory of the season. Husak finished with 313
yards and one touchdown on the day.
