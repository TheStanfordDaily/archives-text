## It's Miller's Time Card pulls off first win 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
One kick, and everything was
good again.
Sure, there are still some prob
lems that the football team needs to
address. Tackling is still giving head
coach Tyrone Willingham fits, and
while the offensive line did a better
job of opening gaps for the running
game, there is still some work to be
done.
But when senior Kevin Miller's
game-winning 20-yard field goal
sailed through the uprights as time
ran out, the Cardinal (1-2,0-1 Pacific
10 Conference) had a 37-34 victory
— its first of the year — against
North Carolina (0-2), and a chance to
start fresh again.
Miller had hit two field goals ear
lier in the game, and the pressure
mounted as the Tar Heels used all
three of their timeouts with two sec

onds left in order to give him more
time to think about the situation.
But Miller could think only one
thing: "Just make the kick and go
home."
And he did.
"By the time they called three
[timeouts], it was bordering on
ridiculous," Miller said. "I just did my
best to keep my mind clear.
"I guess I should have looked up
and realized they had three timeouts
left."
With All-American flanker Troy
Walters sidelined with an ankle in
jury, Willingham needed key players
to step up, and they did.

Todd Husak came out with a scorch
ing performance in the first half,
completing 16 of 24 passes for 227
yards and one touchdown en route to
a 20-13 halftime lead.
"I think we came out with a great
game plan," Husak said. "[Offensive

coordinator Bill] Diedrick did a great
job of laying things out for us.
"Execution-wise this was the best
thing all year. The line stepped up
and the receivers got open."
Senior Jeff Allen, who had only
two career receptions before Satur
day's game, pulled in five passes for
111 yards and a touchdown.
"Jeff Allen stepped up really huge
for our team," Willingham said. "I
don't think I could be happier for a
young man than 1 was to see Jeff step
up."
But the biggest plays came when
Stanford needed them the most.
The Tar Heels had the ball with 59
seconds left and the game tied at 34
when freshman quarterback Ronald
Curry ran down the left sideline.
