# Senior Allen emerges against UNC

### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
When preseason All-American
flanker Troy Walters went down
with an ankle injury last week, head
coach Tyrone Willingham said a few
of the Cardinal receivers would need
to step up and fill the hole he left be
hind. Jeff Allen was listening.
A fifth-year senior, Allen had
only two career receptions going into
Saturday's game against North Car
olina. He had come to Stanford as a
defensive back and only made it to
the receiver position during his ju
nior year. The last two and a half
weeks, he was plagued by back prob

But something clicked for Allen on
Saturday.

"l'm going to do whatever I can to
help," Allen said. In the Cardinal's

sophomore Deßonnie Pitts, who
had 75 yards and a touchdown on
seven receptions, the Cardinal re
ceivers seemed to be stepping up for
the injured Walters. Willingham

"I don't think I could have been hap
pier."
His first, and only, career touch
down came midway through the sec
ond quarter on a seven-yard pass
from quarterback Todd Husak, to
put the Cardinal up, 20-13.
Having to play a key role on short
notice was not a problem for Allen.
In fact, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound re
ceiver has always come through
whenever necessary. A crucial spe
cial teams player in the past, he
recorded nine unassisted tackles in
1995 and blocked a punt that was re
covered for a Stanford touchdown in
the 1996 Northwest Sun Bowl
against Michigan State.
"I played both receiver and de
