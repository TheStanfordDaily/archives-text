# Senior Allen emerges against UNC
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
When preseason All-American
flanker Troy Walters went down
with an ankle injury last week, head
coach Tyrone Willingham said a few
of the Cardinal receivers would need
to step up and fill the hole he left be
hind. Jeff Allen was listening.
A fifth-year senior, Allen had
only two career receptions going into
Saturday's game against North Car
olina. He had come to Stanford as a
defensive back and only made it to
the receiver position during his ju
nior year. The last two and a half
weeks, he was plagued by back prob
lems and didn't suit up for practice.
But something clicked for Allen on
Saturday.

"l'm going to do whatever I can to
help," Allen said. In the Cardinal's
first win of the season, he lived up to
his word, catching 5 passes for 111
yards and a touchdown.
"I haven't practiced in two and a
half weeks, so it was really exciting to
get hack," he said. "We've got a great
core of receivers that rotate [and] all
of us are contributing."
Along with redshirt freshman
Dave Davis, who had eight recep
tions for 108 yards, and redshirt
sophomore Deßonnie Pitts, who
had 75 yards and a touchdown on
seven receptions, the Cardinal re
ceivers seemed to be stepping up for
the injured Walters. Willingham
seemed especially pleased for Allen.
"Jeff Allen really stepped up for
our football team," Willingham said.

"I don't think I could have been hap
pier."
His first, and only, career touch
down came midway through the sec
ond quarter on a seven-yard pass
from quarterback Todd Husak, to
put the Cardinal up, 20-13.
Having to play a key role on short
notice was not a problem for Allen.
In fact, the 6-foot-4, 210-pound re
ceiver has always come through
whenever necessary. A crucial spe
cial teams player in the past, he
recorded nine unassisted tackles in
1995 and blocked a punt that was re
covered for a Stanford touchdown in
the 1996 Northwest Sun Bowl
against Michigan State.
"I played both receiver and de
fensive back in high school, so I was
familiar with both positions," Allen
said. "The last three years, I've been
playing receiver."
The last four years, he has also
been an active member of Stanford's
track and field team and placed sec
ond in the 400-meter hurdles last sea

son at the Pacific-10 Championships.
Now in his last season of eligibili
ty for both sports, and with but a few
more classes to take before he will be
eligible for graduation, Allen is gain
ing some notoriety for his clutch per
formance against UNC. After hav
ing a career day, the flanker didn't
have to think much about what he
wanted from next week's game with
the Oregon Ducks.
"Another win."
