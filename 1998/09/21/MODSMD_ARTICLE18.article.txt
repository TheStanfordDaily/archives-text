# Stanford beats Bruins, upsets USC
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (6-2,2-0 Pacific Ten Con
ference) extended its home win
ning streak to 38 this weekend with
wins over unranked UCLA (1-7,1 -
1) on Sunday and No. 5 USC (4-3,
0-1) on Friday.
Freshman Michelle Chambers
had a huge game against UCLA
with 22 kills, 15 digs and 5 blocks.
Junior Kerri Walsh came up big
against USC with 24 kills, 18 digs
and 3 blocks. However, Walsh's in
jured shoulder kept her out of prac
tice on Saturday and was only at
partial strength on Sunday.
Sophomore Jennifer Detmer
also helped power the wins with 23
kills against USC and 11 against
UCLA.
Despite UCLA's poor record,
they came out fighting and caught
the Cardinal on its heels. Stanford
lost the first game 15-13, then
geared up to barely win the next
three 15-10, 18-16,15-11.
Friday night was a better show
ing. Although they lost the first
game 15-10, they rebounded quick
ly to take the next three 15-3,15-9,
15-12.
"It wasn't easy and after such a
big win on Friday night, it's natural
to let down," said head coach Don
Shaw. "It's a good sign that we can
battle with the best without our
best player at full strength."
With a 1-6 record, UCLA
wasn't expected to come out so
strong. They surprised a relaxed
Stanford team to take the first
game.
Stanford found its rhythm in the
second game but UCLA kept gun
ning it from the back row. Kristee
Porter was on fire and finished with
29 kills. With Walsh only tipping it
over the net, UCLA stopped
guarding her so heavily and dou
ble-teamed the Cardinal's other
hitters, making it hard for the of

fense.
"The momentum was up and
down but we hung in there,"
Chambers said. "We kept focusing
and the games will come to the
team that stays focused the
longest."
The Cardinal needed focus in
the third game as the Bruins
matched every move Stanford
made with one of its own. After a
back-and-forth match, the Cardi
nal finally pulled away with the set
with a kill by Chambers.
In the final set Stanford looked
frustrated but finally edged out the
win with the help of blocking duo
Sarah Sandrik and Sarah Clarke
and a few bursts of brilliance by
Walsh.
Against USC the Cardinal start
ed off slow as the Women of Troy
came out aggressive and scored six
straight points in the first game.
Stanford got its act together quick
ly and scored the next six points to
tie the set. The strong arm of USC's
Jasmina Marinkovic was too much
for the Card to handle, however,
and Stanford lost the game 15-10.
"USC is a good team, they are
athletic and quick," Shaw said.
"Marinkovic is as good of a player
as you'll see anywhere in college
volleyball. I didn't know how we
would play against such a good
team so early in the season."
Marinkovic or not, two-time de
fending national champion Stan
ford was not going to let the
Women of Troy beat it on its home
court. The Cardinal came up huge
in the second game, scoring the
first 10 points to eventually rout
USC, 15-3.
"The first game wasn't that
bad," said Detmer. "But in the sec
ond game we had an attitude of no
mistakes, no excuses and we came
out and crushed them."
They carried the momentum to
the third game. Unfortunately,
