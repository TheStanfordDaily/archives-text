As freshmen packed their bags
and ran last-minute errands, and
upperclassmen began their final
40-hour weeks of the summer,
Stanford's women's field hockey
team rolled into San Francisco air
port early Tuesday morning, fight
ing through tired eyes to get fo
cused on its upcoming homestand.
Keeping a close eye on both the
race for the Northern Pacific Con
ference Championship and the
NCAA national rankings. Coach
Sheryl Johnson knew that the com
ing games against 1 Nth-ranked
Northwestern and NorPac rivals
California and Davis & Elkins
would be crucial.
But the Cardinal knocked off
the Wildcats in a 4-2 decision at the
new Varsity Hockey Astroturf
Field.
"It was a big game for us," John
son said. "We had to snap out of
our [road trip] and get ready for
it."
For most teams that is easier
said than done.
For Stanford it has become the
routine. Opening play against the
ISth-ranked Wildcats, Stanford
seemed only to have gained
strength since its return from its
10-day road trip to Michigan,
quickly jumping out to a 2-0 lead
with goals by seniors Jordyn
Kramer and Monique Leroux.
Although the Wildcats were
able to strike back with two goals
in the final minute of the first half,
Stanford's Mallorv Chambers cap
italized on assists by Leroux and
Michelle Scott to regain the lead
early in the second half.
Lissy Goralnik then scored a
fourth Stanford goal on Leroux's
second assist of the game. Despite
one final goal from Northwestern,
the Cardinal recorded its fourth

win of the season, stretching its
record to 4-2.
Ignoring the deceiving close
ness of the score, Coach Johnson
felt Stanford defeated Northwest
ern decisively.
"I really felt like we dominated
the majority of that game," John
son said. "We played well on the
Michigan trip and so 1 had high ex
pectations for the game. 1 thought
the team was ready ... and they
obviously were."
Although Leroux and Cham
bers scored their third goals of the
season and Kramer and Goralnik
their first. Coach Johnson cited
Stanford's passing game as the
strength that powered it past
Northwestern.
"Our passing game is the best
I've ever seen it," Johnson said. "If
we keep possession of the ball and
know where we are on the field
that keeps us a step ahead of the
opponent."
Leroux echoed her coach's en
thusiasm, mentioning Stanford's
combination of talent and experi
ence as the keys to the effective
ness of its passing game.
"Our passing has been unbe
lievable ... it's really easy to have
a good game when the passing is
on," Leroux said. "Teammates are
feeding you the ball and it's just a
matter of capitalizing on it."
Capitalizing doesn't seem to be
a problem for Leroux. who already
has nine points on the season.
When asked about her success,
though. Leroux points back to the
team.
"I'm really happy that I'm
doing well, but basically as long as
the team wins that makes me the
happiest," she said. "I'd like the
team to go to NCAA this year and
if that means that I need to give
