# In-room Internet connection fee raised
## 
### Daniel Wan Contributing writer 
Surfing the World Wide Web
and sending e-mails from a dorm
room have just become more costly
for Stanford students. This fall.
Residential Computing has raised
the cost of an in-room connection
to $80, nearly twice as much as the
former $45 fee.
"It's ridiculous that the Univer
sity practically doubled the cost,"
said Alexis Kaminsky, a sopho
more.
According to Residential Com
puting officials, the primary reason
for the increase is budgetary.
"Our funding is limited,'" said
Ethan Rikleen, assistant director of
network support for Res Comp.
"Much of it goes to providing clus
ter computers, and our costs are in
creasing,"

~,Res Comp is responsible for
managing Stanford's residential
networks and clusters. It
also pays for residential computer
coordinators.
In previous years, revenue from
the fee accounted for approximate
ly 10 percent of the total operating
budget and was used primarily to
supplement the costs of resident
computer coordinator compensa
tion.
With the fee increase, the addi
tional revenue generated will be
used to upgrade active network
equipment such as hubs, routers
and gateways.
"For the first time, we can fully
[fund] actual active network equip
ment purchase, replacement, main
tenance and staffing support," said
Res Comp Director Jeff Merriman.
"These are costs that have not been
funded in the past."

The additional revenue will not
be used to pay for administrative
costs, upgrading residential com
puter clusters or rewiring resi
dences with faster Internet connec
tions. Other funding is being
sought for those purposes.
"Keep in mind that Internet ser
vice providers charge $20 per
month for one-twentieth the speed
of our network," Merriman said.
"To subscribe at home to compara
ble network speeds would cost
around $400 per month."
But other students complained
that subscribing at a home is differ
ent from subscribing at college.
"Having an in-room connection is
becoming a necessity here because
a lot of classes are requiring that
you access e-mail or the Web," said
Tony Dorie, a sophomore.
Another change is that the fee
will now be assessed as an annual

fee rather than as an activation fee.
Therefore, students will not have to
repay if they move during the same
school year.
Over the summer. Res Comp
also upgraded residential comput
er clusters across campus with
PowerMac G3/266s to replace the
older PowerMac 71(X) machines.
They are also providing updated
versions of software on all cluster
computers, including some new ti
tles such as Adobe Illustrator,
Mathematica and Virtual PC.
The Internet connections at sev
eral residences, including Lagunita
Court and Stern Hall, will be up
graded to the faster 100Base-TX
cable. Res Comp is also planning to
replace older 13- and 14-inch mon
itors with new 17-inch Apple mon
itors and to possibly provide a PC
in each large dorm cluster by the
middle of the school year.
