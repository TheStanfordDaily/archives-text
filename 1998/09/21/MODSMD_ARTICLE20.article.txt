### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
Alter much anticipation, former
Stanford volleyball and basketball
star Kristin Folkl was assigned to the
WNBA's Minnesota expansion
franchise on Sept. 15.
"I'm excited to have been as
signed to the Twin Cities," said Folkl
during a teleconference. "I've been
here a couple of times and every
time I've been here I've felt ex
tremely welcomed. It's a lot like
where I grew up in St. Louis. It al
most feels like a home away from
home of sorts."
Folkl chose to forgo her remain
ing year of basketball eligibility at
Stanford and sign with the WNBA.
Her contract, which begins in the
1999 season, lasts for three years.
Folkl made quite a mark in both
of her sports during her time on the
farm. She was an integral part of the
women's volleyball team, leading it
to two consecutive national champi
onships in 1996 and 1997. A 1997-98
Kodak All-American in basketball,
she led Stanford in scoring (18.9

ppg) and rebounding (9.2 rpg). Un
fortunately, her career was cut short
after she tore her anterior crucial lig
ament last season.
Because her injury came at such a
crucial time. Folkl was unsure about
her future.
"It's great because now I have
something tangible to hold onto,"
said a relieved Folkl. "At first I had
a fear of "Will they pick me up?' and
it was frustrating to see my friends
play while 1 couldn't. But I had to let
things happen and now 1 am so ex
cited to be here."
Folkl is five and a half months
into rehabilitation and is completing
her regimen at Stanford. She ex
pects to be 1 (K) percent by the time
the league starts.
"Right now 1 am doing a lot of
distance running and am on the bike
to build up my leg muscles which
had atrophied from surgery." Folkl
said. "I'm 80 percent right now. 1 an
ticipate the real road to recovery,
when I can start working on compe
tition. to come in about a month."
Even though Folkl has signed a
three-year contract, she has not

ruled out the possibility of playing
Olympic volleyball in the year 2(XX).
"1 don't know where things stand
but it's a possibility," Folkl said. "1
definitely haven't ruled volleyball
out. Right now I'm putting most of
my time into basketball and I will re
evaluate where I'm at at the end of
next season. A lot of it has to do with
where the national team is at and the
chemistry they will have after having
spent a year playing together."
Despite being assigned to an ex
pansion team, many of which are no
torious for having losing records,
Folkl remains positive.
"I never go into a season antici
pating losing," Folkl said. "If we set
goals and work hard and give it our
all, that's all we can do, no one can
argue with that. If it does happen, it's
all in how you deal with it. You have
to look at it positively, learn from
the mistakes and motivate. I don't
think we'll do terrible but if we did
it'll make me a stronger person."
The WNBA also announced that
former Connecticut star Nykesha
Sales will be assigned to its Orlando
franchise.
