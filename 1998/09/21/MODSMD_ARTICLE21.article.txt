# On the road again
## Charity soapbox derby raises over $100,000

Red accordions, orange road
sters, yellow pith helmets, green
grass, blue sky and hundreds of
purple balloons.
No, it's not a circus, but it's
about as close as you can get on the
Stanford campus: the Second An
nual Sand Hill Challenge soapbox
derby.
On Sunday, spectators watched
gravity-propelled vehicles of all
shapes and sizes jet down the four
tenths of a mile long course to raise
money for charity.
"It's a great thing for the com
munity," said race founder Jamis
MacNiven, dressed in a tiger
striped top and a yellow pith hel
met.
From spaceships to sand castles,
a parade of peculiarly shaped mo
torless cars took to the races to
benefit the Peninsula Community
Fund. The Fund disperses the
money raised by the event, which
last year topped $75,(XX), to a vari
ety of charities, including Safe
Rides, a drunk driving prevention
program for teenagers, and
Friends for Youth, a mentoring
program for at-risk young people.
This year the event raised over
$100,000.
"Peninsula Community Fund is
a resource point on how to best
channel money to needy organiza
tions," said the fund's communica
tions consultant, Howard Kalt.
For most, however, the race was
simply a chance to have fun and let
their imaginations run wild.
The whimsy division, with en
trants competing for style, not
speed, had vehicles shaped like
credit cards, beds and telephones.
"We started planning this car a
month and a half ago, and have

been working on it solidly for the
past two weeks," said Jason Robin
son, one of the designers of Ideo
Development's spaceship-shaped
car.
Like a number of participants,
the competitors from Ideo didn't
have to build their machine in their
garage. Many Silicon Valley engi
neering companies that competed,
including Ideo, were able to build

I want to have a car that's
both fast and funny.'

their crafts at the office.
Competition in the speed divi
sion was more fierce, with competi
tors making use of all their techni
cal know-how. From fiberglass
chassis to independent suspen
sions, the cars were the state of the
art.
A minor controversy erupted
over the use of a launching device
by the team from Draper Fisher Ju
rvetson. While most cars are simply
pushed from the top of the hill,
bobsled style, the team from Drap
er used a steeply inclined wooden
ramp to give their car a faster send
off.
"We're completely within the
rules," said team driver Warren
Packard.
"They say that the launch has to
be done by natural gravity, and
that's all that we're using," added
Barry Hutchison, another Draper
employee.
The team from Ziatech had per
haps a better launching mecha
nism: Its two pushers were Olympic
bobsledders Garrett Hines and
Brian Richardson.
"I've been pushing for five
years, but this is really one of the

greatest experiences I've had," said
Hines, whose sled tied for fourth in
the 1998 Winter Olympics.
Former San Francisco 49er run
ning back Roger Craig was there to
root for the bobsledders.
"1 helped in the push to raise
money for this last year, and I'm
here to support it again this year,"
said Craig.
The participants, each of whom
paid a $2,500 entrance fee, win
nothing but trophies and accolades
from their peers.
The day's festivities began with
several hundred accordion players
joining for a rendition of George
and Ira Gershwin's "Lady of
Spain."
"A bunch of us accordion play
ers heard about this and thought it
sounded like fun," said accordion
player Eric Biland. "Besides, how
often do you get a chance to play
with this many other people, and in
front of this many other people?"
Besides speed and whimsy,
other prizes included "Most
Bizarre," "Worst Drivers," and
"Most Confused."
Before the adults took to the
track, the high school division
raced their own vehicles.
Reaching speeds of up to 30
miles per hour, these junior vehi
cles scared parents and delighted
children.
"I want to race in it when I get
older," said Alex Leanse, who was
celebrating his ninth birthday at the
race. "I want to have a car that's
both fast and funny."
It wasn't only the children who
wanted in on the action.
"I wouldn't mind racing my
self," said Steve Purdue, who came
at 8:15 a.m. to stake out good seats
with his wife and kids.
When all was said and done, a
colorful time was had by all.
