# Stanford interns spend a summer in the White House
## 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Although everyone in the coun
try now knows what one White
House intern has done in the Oval
Office, little is known about the in
tended role of college students who
spend their summers volunteering
in the White House.
Jokes aside, White House interns
work hard, and are an integral part
of the functioning of the administra
tion. This summer, several Stanford
students got an insider's view of the
work that goes on at 16(X) Pennsyl
vania Ave.. And their experiences,
which in no way included anything
worthy of the Starr Report, were
varied and fascinating.
Junior Stephen Kane and
sophomores Danny Jacobs and
Aron Ketchel spent their summers
assisting with state campaigns, re
searching health care policy, and
writing about events for profes
sionals working in the White

House. They all said that the in
ternship had been a positive experi
ence.
Why they applied
Like many Washington intern
ships undergraduates take for the
summer. White House interns are
unpaid and sometimes work long
hours on less than substantive work.
But every year, college students
from all over the country apply and
only about 2(X) are accepted.
"There is no better way to learn
how public policy is formed by the
administration then to spend a cou
ple of months in the White House,"
said Ketchel.
He was motivated to apply in
order to find out more about the
functioning of the executive branch.
"The Lewinsky situation was
unimportant to me," said Jacobs.
"What I was interested in was hav
ing the American government expe
rience. And the best way to do that
was to be in the center; the White

House."
Kane added, "You gain insight.
When you're inside you realize that
the administration is very pragmat
ic. The White House is a machine
with a very planned-out process."
And despite the negative associ
ations that the job now holds for
some, the three believe that the ben
efits they gained from the experi
ence and the future possibilities the
internship will create were worth it.
What they did '
In the White House intern pro
gram, the jobs that students are as
signed to are very different. Stu
dents select four offices that they
have the most interest in when they
apply and, when accepted, are as
signed to an office through a semi
random process.
"We thought that we would be
running the place ... making policy
or something," Kane and Jacobs
joked.
But although they didn't design

any foreign policy or brief any legis
lators, all three were satisfied with
the work they got to do.
Ketchel, a public policy major,
was assigned to work in the division
of domestic policy on health care.
"1 didn't originally have any spe

cific interest in health care," Ketchel
said, "But it turned out to be one of
the busiest offices in the White
House this summer because lots of
issues were being debated and the

public cares a lot about health care
right now."
His office was small. Aside from
the two summer interns, only three
people work within the office to co
ordinate all of the health care policy
from the executive departments.
Ketchel said this made him realize
how hard people in the White
House work, and also that White
House interns fulfill an important
role.
"The White House depends on
interns to function," he said.
Kane, who is a double major in
political science and economics,
worked in the Political Affairs Of
fice. The office is the link between
state political affairs and the White
House.
Kane organized briefings for
staff members when they went on
trips to states, and worked specifi
cally on monitoring political events
and campaigns in Indiana, lowa and
Louisiana.
"The Political Affairs Office is
like the Democratic National Com
mittee inside the White House. I
never realized before how much at
tention the president pays to the
DNC," Kane said.
Kane also was partially responsi
ble for making sure that pictures
and letters from the president going
to various states were signed.
"Every time the president sends
out a signature there's an auto-pen
that signs it," Kane said. "The first
day they showed us the auto-pen,
and it took away all the magic. I
thought that the president was
much more powerful than he is. It
turns out that the White House is a
well-run organization."
Kane however didn't find this
disheartening.
"I thought it was kind of empow
ering because it means that every
day citizens can take part in govern
ment."
Jacobs was assigned to one of the
less known White House offices, the

White House Fellows Office. The
program brings about 15 talented
professionals from all over the
country into the White House for a
year. It is designed to make the fel
lows' expertise available to the ad
ministration and increase participa
tion in government.
"The goal of the program is to
get good people into government
and to keep them there," Jacobs
said.
He commented that the office
was less involved in domestic poli
tics than he originally wanted to be.
"I wasn't happy the first two
weeks, so I tried to switch offices,"
he said. "But it turned out to be
great. It was an amazing experience
because I got to see all of the things
that I was researching."
Jacobs had the chance to meet
Mayor Marion Barry of Washing
ton D.C., Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore and Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author Taylor Branch. He also
accompanied the White House Fel
lows on tours through a public hous
ing project in Washington, Air
Force One and Oriole Park at Cam
den Yards.
While on Air Force One, Jacobs
had the chance to look around the
plane.
"I looked through the presi
dent's CD collection. There was a
Barbara Streisand album, three
Michael Bolton CDs, Sax for Sax
Lovers and a lot of Elvis Presley
CDs," Jacobs said. "It was pretty
cool."
The president
"Except for immediately after
the president testified on Aug. 17,
the issue of the scandal was not
brought up in the office that I
worked in," Ketchel said.
"Right after the testimony, there
was a lot of anger, a lot of distress
and a general disillusionment with
the situation," Jacobs said.
But all three agreed that "the sit
uation" did not change the way their
offices were run. No special men
tion was made during orientation
about the scandal, and no specific

sexual harassment policy was stat T |
ed.
And they said that people withia'
the office still had a lot of respect for
the president.
"You don't work six days a week
and 12 hours a day if you don't like
your boss," Jacobs said. "People
have a lot of respect for him."

The 207 White House interns
had the chance to meet the presi
dent twice during the summer. He
gave a speech in appreciation of the
interns, in which he urged the stu
dents to return to their schools and
get involved in their communities
and in government.
And their impressions?
"He had a really limp hand
shake," Jacobs said.
The three said that they felt ap
preciated, and that all of the speak
ers that spoke to the interns empha
sized their gratitude. And although
Jacobs, Kane and Ketchel said that
they will not apply to be unpaid in
terns again next year, they are glad
for the chance to work in the White
House.
"It was refreshing to see how in
credibly hard people within the
White House work," Ketchel said.
And for several months this sum
mer, they were part of that hard
work.

Although everyone in the coun
try now knows what one White
House intern has done in the Oval
Office, little is known about the in
tended role of college students who
spend their summers volunteering
in the White House.
Jokes aside, White House interns
work hard, and are an integral part
of the functioning of the administra
tion. This summer, several Stanford
students got an insider's view of the
work that goes on at 16(X) Pennsyl
vania Ave.. And their experiences,
which in no way included anything
worthy of the Starr Report, were
varied and fascinating.
Junior Stephen Kane and
sophomores Danny Jacobs and
Aron Ketchel spent their summers
assisting with state campaigns, re
searching health care policy, and
writing about events for profes
sionals working in the White

House. They all said that the in
ternship had been a positive experi
ence.
Why they applied
Like many Washington intern
ships undergraduates take for the
summer. White House interns are
unpaid and sometimes work long
hours on less than substantive work.
But every year, college students
from all over the country apply and
only about 2(X) are accepted.
"There is no better way to learn
how public policy is formed by the
administration then to spend a cou
ple of months in the White House,"
said Ketchel.
He was motivated to apply in
order to find out more about the
functioning of the executive branch.
"The Lewinsky situation was
unimportant to me," said Jacobs.
"What I was interested in was hav
ing the American government expe
rience. And the best way to do that
was to be in the center; the White

House."
Kane added, "You gain insight.
When you're inside you realize that
the administration is very pragmat
ic. The White House is a machine
with a very planned-out process."
And despite the negative associ
ations that the job now holds for
some, the three believe that the ben
efits they gained from the experi
ence and the future possibilities the
internship will create were worth it.
What they did '
In the White House intern pro
gram, the jobs that students are as
signed to are very different. Stu
dents select four offices that they
have the most interest in when they
apply and, when accepted, are as
signed to an office through a semi
random process.
"We thought that we would be
running the place ... making policy
or something," Kane and Jacobs
joked.
But although they didn't design

any foreign policy or brief any legis
lators, all three were satisfied with
the work they got to do.
Ketchel, a public policy major,
was assigned to work in the division
of domestic policy on health care.
"1 didn't originally have any spe

cific interest in health care," Ketchel
said, "But it turned out to be one of
the busiest offices in the White
House this summer because lots of
issues were being debated and the

public cares a lot about health care
right now."
His office was small. Aside from
the two summer interns, only three
people work within the office to co
ordinate all of the health care policy
from the executive departments.
Ketchel said this made him realize
how hard people in the White
House work, and also that White
House interns fulfill an important
role.
"The White House depends on
interns to function," he said.
Kane, who is a double major in
political science and economics,
worked in the Political Affairs Of
fice. The office is the link between
state political affairs and the White
House.
Kane organized briefings for
staff members when they went on
trips to states, and worked specifi
cally on monitoring political events
and campaigns in Indiana, lowa and
Louisiana.
"The Political Affairs Office is
like the Democratic National Com
mittee inside the White House. I
never realized before how much at
tention the president pays to the
DNC," Kane said.
Kane also was partially responsi
ble for making sure that pictures
and letters from the president going
to various states were signed.
"Every time the president sends
out a signature there's an auto-pen
that signs it," Kane said. "The first
day they showed us the auto-pen,
and it took away all the magic. I
thought that the president was
much more powerful than he is. It
turns out that the White House is a
well-run organization."
Kane however didn't find this
disheartening.
"I thought it was kind of empow
ering because it means that every
day citizens can take part in govern
ment."
Jacobs was assigned to one of the
less known White House offices, the

White House Fellows Office. The
program brings about 15 talented
professionals from all over the
country into the White House for a
year. It is designed to make the fel
lows' expertise available to the ad
ministration and increase participa
tion in government.
"The goal of the program is to
get good people into government
and to keep them there," Jacobs
said.
He commented that the office
was less involved in domestic poli
tics than he originally wanted to be.
"I wasn't happy the first two
weeks, so I tried to switch offices,"
he said. "But it turned out to be
great. It was an amazing experience
because I got to see all of the things
that I was researching."
Jacobs had the chance to meet
Mayor Marion Barry of Washing
ton D.C., Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore and Pulitzer Prize-win
ning author Taylor Branch. He also
accompanied the White House Fel
lows on tours through a public hous
ing project in Washington, Air
Force One and Oriole Park at Cam
den Yards.
While on Air Force One, Jacobs
had the chance to look around the
plane.
"I looked through the presi
dent's CD collection. There was a
Barbara Streisand album, three
Michael Bolton CDs, Sax for Sax
Lovers and a lot of Elvis Presley
CDs," Jacobs said. "It was pretty
cool."
The president
"Except for immediately after
the president testified on Aug. 17,
the issue of the scandal was not
brought up in the office that I
worked in," Ketchel said.
"Right after the testimony, there
was a lot of anger, a lot of distress
and a general disillusionment with
the situation," Jacobs said.
But all three agreed that "the sit
uation" did not change the way their
offices were run. No special men
tion was made during orientation
about the scandal, and no specific

sexual harassment policy was stat T |
ed.
And they said that people withia'
the office still had a lot of respect for
the president.
"You don't work six days a week
and 12 hours a day if you don't like
your boss," Jacobs said. "People
have a lot of respect for him."

The 207 White House interns
had the chance to meet the presi
dent twice during the summer. He
gave a speech in appreciation of the
interns, in which he urged the stu
dents to return to their schools and
get involved in their communities
and in government.
And their impressions?
"He had a really limp hand
shake," Jacobs said.
The three said that they felt ap
preciated, and that all of the speak
ers that spoke to the interns empha
sized their gratitude. And although
Jacobs, Kane and Ketchel said that
they will not apply to be unpaid in
terns again next year, they are glad
for the chance to work in the White
House.
"It was refreshing to see how in
credibly hard people within the
White House work," Ketchel said.
And for several months this sum
mer, they were part of that hard
work.
