# Stanford interns spend a summer in the White House
## 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Although everyone in the coun
try now knows what one White
House intern has done in the Oval
Office, little is known about the in
tended role of college students who
spend their summers volunteering
in the White House.
Jokes aside, White House interns
work hard, and are an integral part
of the functioning of the administra
tion. This summer, several Stanford
students got an insider's view of the
work that goes on at 16(X) Pennsyl
vania Ave.. And their experiences,
which in no way included anything
worthy of the Starr Report, were
varied and fascinating.
Junior Stephen Kane and
sophomores Danny Jacobs and
Aron Ketchel spent their summers
assisting with state campaigns, re
searching health care policy, and
writing about events for profes
sionals working in the White

House. They all said that the in
ternship had been a positive experi
ence.
Why they applied
Like many Washington intern
ships undergraduates take for the
summer. White House interns are
unpaid and sometimes work long
hours on less than substantive work.
But every year, college students
from all over the country apply and
only about 2(X) are accepted.
"There is no better way to learn
how public policy is formed by the
administration then to spend a cou
ple of months in the White House,"
said Ketchel.
He was motivated to apply in
order to find out more about the
functioning of the executive branch.
"The Lewinsky situation was
unimportant to me," said Jacobs.
"What I was interested in was hav
ing the American government expe
rience. And the best way to do that
was to be in the center; the White

House."
Kane added, "You gain insight.
When you're inside you realize that
the administration is very pragmat
ic. The White House is a machine
with a very planned-out process."
And despite the negative associ
ations that the job now holds for
some, the three believe that the ben
efits they gained from the experi
ence and the future possibilities the
internship will create were worth it.
What they did '
In the White House intern pro
gram, the jobs that students are as
signed to are very different. Stu
dents select four offices that they
have the most interest in when they
apply and, when accepted, are as
signed to an office through a semi
random process.
"We thought that we would be
running the place ... making policy
or something," Kane and Jacobs
joked.
But although they didn't design

any foreign policy or brief any legis
lators, all three were satisfied with
the work they got to do.
Ketchel, a public policy major,
was assigned to work in the division
of domestic policy on health care.
"1 didn't originally have any spe

cific interest in health care," Ketchel
said, "But it turned out to be one of
the busiest offices in the White
House this summer because lots of
issues were being debated and the
