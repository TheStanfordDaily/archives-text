# Rebate rules revamped
## Bookstore gives "instant" 7-percent discount 
### Ryan Kalember 
The Stanford Bookstore has re
vised its rebate program to give stu
dents and faculty an immediate dis
count on textbook purchases.
The new policy establishes an
instant 7 percent rebate for any
new or used textbook, including
course readers. However, books
that are not required by a class will
not receive a discount as they did
under the old program.
This procedure replaces the
prior rebate program, in which stu
dents collected their receipts for
the year, submitted them in an en
velope in the spring and received a
rebate in the fall of the following
year.
The Bookstore's new Student
Advisory Committee, created last
year, suggested the policy revision.
Students on the committee com

plained of losing receipts, forget
ting to turn in envelopes at the ap
pointed time, and having to wait
several months for their refunds.
Rebates had been as high as 11
percent in the past few years. How
ever, only 6,000 eligible students
turned in rebate envelopes, where
as all 14,000 students will save
money under the new program.
The Bookstore used last year's
sales numbers to arrive at the 7 per
cent rate because they anticipate
similar sales figures this year.
The Bookstore, a non-profit or
ganization, is one of less than a
dozen of the 4,000 college book
stores in the country to divide part
of its year-end profit among stu
dents and faculty through a rebate.
"The majority of campus book
stores are run by the university,"
according to Peggy Mendelson,
Bookstore CEO. "They often have

different goals. Ours is to offer the
lowest possible prices on text
books."
The Bookstore has attempted to
share its year-end surplus with stu
dents since before 1930. At the end
of each fiscal year, the Board of Di
rectors decides what capital invest
ments need to be made as well as
what amount of money can be re
turned to students, faculty, and
staff. Last year, the board voted to
return $450,000.
"I like the new program," said
Tony Dorie, a sophomore. "I never
got around to turning in my enve
lope last year and this will definite
ly save me some time."
Students and faculty who would'
have otherwise turned in their re
ceipt envelopes are the financial
losers under the new plan, howev
