# No animal houses here
## Sororities balancing national rules with University's 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
The housing of two sororities
does not mean an increase in the
number of raging, all-night parties
in Cowell Cluster. On the contrary,
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa

Alpha Theta, the two recently
housed sororities, say they will play
a very different role in campus so
cial life than fraternities.
Senior Jenny Pippin, vice-presi
dent of Tri-Delt, said that Stanford
sororities have historically been in
volved in community service, each

with a different charity group.
Sororities are also responsible
for upholding strict national regula
tions, including no alcohol on house
premises and no men in the house
overnight.
