## Sororities balancing national rules with University's 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
The housing of two sororities
does not mean an increase in the
number of raging, all-night parties
in Cowell Cluster. On the contrary,
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa

Alpha Theta, the two recently
housed sororities, say they will play
a very different role in campus so
cial life than fraternities.
Senior Jenny Pippin, vice-presi
dent of Tri-Delt, said that Stanford
sororities have historically been in
volved in community service, each

with a different charity group.
Sororities are also responsible
for upholding strict national regula
tions, including no alcohol on house
premises and no men in the house
overnight.
"There won't be a keg in the
hallway," said Pippin.
Tri-Delt has already outlined
specific house guidelines, namely
that men cannot be in the house for
a set six-hour period at night, and
while all bathrooms are co-ed, men
cannot shower in them. Tri-Delt
does plan to allow male eating asso
ciates, however. Theta has not yet
outlined its specific house policies.
Neither newly housed sorority
has plans for all-campus parties
soon. "We are excited to have a
house at all," said Pippin. "We feel
really privileged, and we don't want
to do anything to sacrifice it."
They are planning other events,
including an open house for alum
nae and a barbecue yesterday with
ZAP residents on the Cowell lawn.
"The house is an opportunity for
us to get things done more efficient
ly within the chapter," said Theta
President Sarah McDonald, a se
nior.
McDonald also stressed the im
portance of being a welcoming en
vironment. "We want to have func
tions here with other Greek organi
zations; we don't want to be exclu
sive."
Working under both University
guidelines and national sorority
guidelines will be a balancing act,
said McDonald. University alcohol
policy emphasizes education over
enforcement, while national sorori
ty policy does not allow any alcohol
at sorority functions at all.
"It is important for us to abide
by national rules," said Pippin.
"Our house is going to be really
careful. We want the University to
be proud."
At the same time, McDonald

recognized the need to balance the
national rules with Stanford's less
restrictive policies.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "Stanford is unique — we
place the national organizations in
a secondary role — sororities and
fraternities have to comply with

University expectations."
"Fraternities and sororities can
implement practices above and be
yond [ours] to comply with nation
als. That's fine by us, as long as it
doesn't conflict with University
policies. We won't stand in their
way."
