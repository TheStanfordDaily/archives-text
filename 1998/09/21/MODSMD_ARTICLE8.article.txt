Margaret Jewell Mullen, founder
of the Stanford Modern Dance Pro
gram and prominent local educator
and literary figure, died of cancer
Aug. 28 at her Menlo Park home.
She was 89 years old.
Mullen created the dance major
and, against the wishes of Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, en
couraged both women and men to
participate in the department's
course offerings.
"She made sure her students real
ly became excited about dance,"
said Maureen Eppstein, an analyst
at Information Technology Systems
and Services and friend of Mullen.
"The focus [of Stanford dance] was
previously very much in recreational
movement."
Mullen accomplished these
transformations in a relatively short
time. She was affiliated with Stan
ford from only 1937 to 1941.
Even though her time at Stanford
was brief, Mullen's legacy continues
even today. Today, hundreds of
Stanford students take dance classes
each year.
"I love to dance because you can
express with your body things that
you cannot express with words," ex
plained Sandy Chi, a sophomore
who took several dance courses last
year.
Mullen left Stanford after her
marriage to James McLean Mullen,
and in 1967 she begin her next career
as a respected and accomplished ed
ucator.
Her work in the early 1970s on
the California State Manual for Ca

reer Education, based on a proto
type she developed for Menlo-
Atherton High School, earned her
accolades in the educational field to
parallel her merits in the arts.
After her retirement from educa
tion in 1979, the tireless Mullen pur
sued her literary interests through
both poetry and prose. She pub
lished several books, including "An
Arkansas Childhood: Growing Up
in the Athens of the Ozarks," a poet
ry anthology entitled "Safe For
Now," and "One Woman's Journey:
From 8 to 88."
At a recent concert in her honor
shortly before her death, Mullen
read a prose passage reflecting the
trance-like quality of dance. "It was
one of the more beautiful readings
I've ever heard in my life," said
Richard Powers, a lecturer in the
dance division.
A native of Emporia, Kan.,
Mullen's unique talents were evi
dent at an early age. She was the
youngest college student in the na
tion at the time when she enrolled at
the University of Arkansas at age 14.
Mullen also possessed an exten
sive background in modern dance.
She was a member of the Hanya
Holm Dance Company, an im
mensely influential group of the
19305, prior to coming to Stanford.
To celebrate Mullen's legacy, the
Dance Division plans to dedicate its
annual alumni concert to the memo
ry of Margaret Mullen. The concert
will be held on Oct. 24 at 8 p.m. in
Roble Gym, and will include a picto
rial tribute and the designation of a
modern dance fellowship in her
name.
