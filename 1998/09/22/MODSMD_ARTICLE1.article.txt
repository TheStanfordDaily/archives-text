# Attack of the psyllids
## Insects eating eucalyptus 
### Betsy Carroll 
That sticky stuff you may have recently noticed
tracked into your dormitory may be more than left
over chewing gum or frat-party beer.
The culprit is Glycaspis brimblecombei. a defoliat
ing insect known as a psyllid that is indigenous to Aus
tralia. The psyllid causes eucalyptus trees to lose their
leaves by sucking the fluids from the leaves, eventual
ly leading to complete loss of leaves and to death. The
noticeable residue is a by-product of the psyllid's nu
trient-rich fecal matter.
Officials in the Grounds Department are currently
working with leading entomologists in the University
of California system to halt the infestation of Stan
ford's eucalyptus trees by the psyllids, which were dis
covered this June.
As a spokesman for trees everywhere, Stanford
Tree Chris Henderson, a junior, said. "I think it's a
horrible tragedy."
According to Herb Fong, Stanford's manager of
Facilities Operations, "We haven't lost any trees yet,
but they are getting weakened." Fong estimated that
the affected trees have lost between SO and 100 per
cent of their leaves.
Although the Grounds Department has found a
few potential options for solving the problem, no
method other than basic support — providing the
trees with adequate water and care — has been
adopted yet.
"It's all kind of a new thing. There are no known
controls of the problem and no known insecticidal
treatments," said Karen Stidd, a horticultural techni
cal specialist in the Grounds Department.
One possibility is that the Northern California cli
mate may be inhospitable for the psyllids in the com
ing months.
"We're hoping that if the weather is colder this
winter, it may cause the population to decrease."
Stidd said.

Though this tree appears alive and well, a defoliat
ing insect native to Australia has infested a num
ber of Stanford's eucalyptus trees.
The Grounds Department is
currently working with Don
Dahlsten, a UC-Berkeley entomol
ogist, and with Larry Costello, an
environmental horticulture adviser

specializing in urban forestry and
landscape horticulture. Costello is
a liaison from the UC extension
program, and both are working on
the possibility of finding a predator
species to eliminate the insects.
Dahlsten was unavailable for
comment, but Stidd did mention
that the Grounds Department had

noticed the appearance of ladybugs
and another black species on the
trees, which may or may not be eat
ing the psyllids.
While most of the community
agrees that the non-native psyllids
pose a serious threat to the Univer
sity's landscape, a handful of Palo
Alto residents have argued that the

eucalyptus trees are also not native
to the area and therefore should be
allowed to die.
This is not the opinion of the
Grounds Department.
"The eucalyptuses are such a
significant portion of our land
scape; they have been naturalized
in this area," Fong said.
