# Clinton video released

WASHINGTON (AF) — Congress
laid before a wary nation today the raw
lootage of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony and 3,183 pages of evidence
chronicling his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky in explicit detail, 'it's an embar
rassing and personally painful thing," Clin
ton told the grand jurors.
I lie videotape of Clinton's testimony
began playing unedited on television sets
across America shortly before 9:30 a.m.
ED I . White House press secretary Mike
McCurry blamed its release on "rank par
tisanship" and dismissed most of the new
material as irrelevant.
The tape portrayed Clinton as some
times angry at prosecutors' questions and
other times expressing bitterness at how
the Paula Jones lawsuit precipitated Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starr's criminal
investigation of the Lewinsky matter.
"I deplored what they were doing,"
Clinton said of the Jones lawsuit. Jabbing
his hand at prosecutors for emphasis, he
insisted that in his January testimony in
the Jones case, he was "determined to
walk through the minefield of this deposi
tion without violating the law. and I
believe I did."

"1 deplored the innocent people they
were tormenting and traumatizing. I
deplored their illegal leaking," Clinton
said.
The two-volume set of evidence made
public today includes Ms. Lewinsky's own
account to prosecutors and the grand jury,
in which she calls the president her "sexu
al soulmate" and testifies about her frus
tration that the president hadn't taken
their sexual activity further.
"Maybe that was his way of being able
to feel OK about it, his way of being able
to justify it or rationalize it," she testified.
Away from the spectacle, the president
was at the United Nations in New York.
His speech on combating terrorism got a
standing ovation — "the warmest and
most enthusiastic reception" he has
received in six U.N. speeches, said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He said
Clinton didn't watch the video.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, appearing at
a New York University forum, made no
mention of the Lewinsky matter in her
opening remarks.
McCurry said the videotape shows
"repeated efforts by Mr. Starr and his
prosecutors to browbeat and badger"

Clinton into discussing intimate details of
his relationship.
The materials released today provide
one side of the story: the evidence that
Starr said supports his case for 11 possible
impeachable offenses against the presi
dent. McCurry's response: "That the pres
ident's conduct does not rise to the level of
an impeachable offense should now be
clear to everyone."
With the House not in session, few law
makers were on hand at the Capitol. Sen
ate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-
S.D., said it was "unfortunate" that
Republicans insisted on releasing the tape
over Democrats' objections.
Rep. John Conyers Jr., ranking Demo
crat on the House Judiciary Committee,
decried the release of "irrelevant, unnec
essary disclosure of salacious and lurid
details" meant to embarrass the president.
But Republican members of the com
mittee said the videotape revealed Clin
ton's legal maneuvering. Committing per
jury before the grand jury would be
grounds for impeachment, said Rep.
Charles Canady, R-Fla. The president
"understands the obligation to tell the
truth and the whole truth," Canady said.
