New Far East permit will
encourage students to park
away from campus center

ROLLERBLADERS AND bikers

Stern and Wilbur residents fear
leaving their dormitories during the day
because they might not find parking spaces
when they return. Cars are increasingly
prominent on the Stanford campus, and
sometimes there just aren't enough spaces
to accomodate all of them. Transportation
Services' new Far East parking permit is a
welcome attempt to alleviate parking stress
on campus.
The new permit will let students park on
Bowdoin Street or Searsville Road if they
opt out of paying $70 for a full-year permit
in their dorm parking lots. This arrange
ment is attractive because it's free; students
who choose the Far East permit will pay
nothing to park at Stanford this year.
But the best part of the Far East permit
is that it's voluntary. Instead of forcing stu
dents to park their cars far away, which
would no doubt cause a student uproar.
Transportation Services has wisely decided
to let us make the choice.
Most students don't need a car every
day. Once in a while, we need to drive to
Safeway or San Francisco or the drugstore.
Some do need a car close by for daily off
campus jaunts; they can pay for a dorm per-

Mit and keep the convenience of a close
spot. Either way, Transportation Services is
allowing students to decide how important
it is to keep their cars close.
The real benefit of the new permit
might he that it encourages students to
rely less on cars and more on non-motor
ized transportation. That may sound
ridiculous, but unnecessary car use is ram
pant here. Students regularly drive from
their dormitories to Tresidder Fitness
Center to work out after dark, or to drive
across campus to meet their friends in
other residences.
Stanford is spread out over more than
1,000 acres. That's huge. But it doesn't have
to feel that way. Campus is decentralized.
There's no 24-hour student union; dining
options are pretty limited in the wee hours
of the night. Of course students want to
leave Stanford when they get the munchies
after midnight.
The Far East permit could be part of a
new campus design that encourages stu
dents to stay near the heart of campus. This
initiative would be most effective if students
had a reason to stay here. Opening Tresid
der later was a good first step towards cam
pus centralization; the Far East permit
could contribute to that effort.
Cars make cross-campus travel easier.
But people don't need to drive when biking
would only take ten minutes. Even walking
isn't so taxing. Disagree? Try it sometime.
It may take more energy than driving, but it
beats circling the Toyon lot waiting for a
parking space to free up.
