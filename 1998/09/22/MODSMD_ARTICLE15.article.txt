## Steven Aronowitz My favorite Stanford tradition 
### 
BIG GAME IS my
favorite Stanford
tradition. I like
Full Moon on the Quad. I
like Screw Your Room
mate dances. I like jump
ing in the pool with the
hand at MuFuUnSun, but

I love Big Game.
Big Game is the ultimate escape from
the cerebral, civilized, academic ivory
tower that students here at Stanford and
those across the bay at Cal inhabit.
Remember your first party, when you
let it all hang out, got totally smashed and
spent the night dancing with your dorm
mates? Remember the Band rally during
Orientation when you had no idea what
was going on but it felt so right? Big Game
is that for the entire campus. It's a week of
insanity that helps everyone keep the rest
of the year sane. It's the break before finals
that is everyone's chance to be a freshman.
There is the excitement of watching
your team go into battle. Like some sort of
ancient gladiators, the football team takes
the field to represent all of us, proving our
ability and superiority. It is not the vio

lence of this battle that is intoxicating, but
the drama. The riveting suspense of who
will win the right to brag in bars and at pic
nics for the next year, of who will take
home the legendary Axe.
There is the camaraderie of being part
of the Stanford tribe, complete with face
paint, costumes and symbols. Big Game is
a chance to define what it means to be a
Stanford student by showing that we are
not like those "hippie weenies." Identity
and pride are at all-time highs during the
game and the week preceding it.
Stanford tribal identity is not the only
sense of belonging that is boosted by the
Big Game. There is also the feeling of
being a part of something with Cal stu
dents. Even if they are the objects of our
ridicule, we give them the grudging respect
that one grants to a worthy opponent. Big
Game is a huge inside joke that only stu
dents from Stanford and Cal can ever real
ly get, and that feels good.
My favorite aspect of Big Game is how
totally out of control and completely
unpredictable the whole thing can be. Dur
ing the week building up to the actual
game the Band has the "Bearial" and sur

prise rallies anywhere from the top of
Hoover Tower to the Steam Tunnels.
Stanford's largest student production,
Big Game Gaieties, explodes onto the
Memorial Auditorium stage with a full
serving of Cal-bashing. It also includes
more than a few laughs aimed at all of
Stanford's own idiosyncrasies, plus super
cool cameos and a dab of random nudity to
boot.
And then there's the legend of the Big
Game Bonfire, which used to give the Axe
Committee a chance to play with fire while
imparting the mythology of the Axe to
another class of Stanford students.
You never know what might go down
during Saturday's game. Last-ditch touch
downs, Tree assaults, flying fruit, vanishing
banners and toppled goalposts are a few of
the "you had to be there to believe it"
moments of past years that make Big
Game more like a huge experiment in
mob mentality than a football match.
See you at Cal this November.
