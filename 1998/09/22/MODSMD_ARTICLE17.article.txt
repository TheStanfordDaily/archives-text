## Just a bit outside Brian Eule Not your average athletes

Sitting in an airport midway through my
first year at Stanford, I glanced around at the
top-ranked Cardinal baseball team as we
waited for a flight to Los Angeles. The team
was to play the UCLA Bruins this particular
weekend and I was along for the ride.

Music blaring from my CD player, I began
feeling a bit self-conscious upon realizing
that I was the only one whose head was not
buried in a book. I quickly threw off my
headphones and glanced at the nearest play
er's reading material, which appeared to be
the size of the Stanford Directory.
"What class is that for?" I interrupted.
"Oh, this?" he replied. "This isn't for any
class."
I began studying for my midterms.
It didn't take me long to learn that things
are a little bit different here. Stanford fits
under the "what's right with sports" catego
ry and magical moments are often created
here.
On Saturday, I saw one.
The football team gave the freshmen a
nice welcome to Stanford by defeating
North Carolina on a last-minute field goal
during the second day of Orientation, but
something even more special occurred im
mediately after the game.
While the band continued to play and the
students continued to cheer, the team
brought its celebration from the field to the
front of the student section.
The line between the red football jerseys
and the brass-colored instruments vanished.
Wide receiver De√üonnie Pitts and corner
back Frank Primus started dancing right
there, and the crowd was exuberant.
I felt that Pitts and Primus were giving a
fitting introduction to, as one friend de

scribed it,"the happiest place on earth."
There is little doubt that this is a special
place. Athletes are not isolated from their
peers, but rather live in the same dorms and
eat in the same dinning halls as non-athletes.
Superiority complexes are not welcome.
Everybody got here thanks to hard work,
and there is obvious mutual respect. Diversi
ty is a necessity.
The ironic thing is, Stanford athletes are
some of the best in the nation. They are the
athletes who actually do have something to
brag about, even though they may downplay
accomplishments.
The University's teams are competing
with some of the best in the nation, in some
of the hardest conferences in the country
and in front of national audiences at times. It
would be easy to get an inflated ego, but it
would be wrong to bring it back to the Farm.
Reporters are required to be objective,
but there is a rare day when something
catches their eye, hits home, and emotion
becomes invested. A columnist for a San
Diego newspaper told me that at last year's
NCAA men's basketball Final Four, the
Cardinal tugged at his heart. He was pulling
for Stanford to win it all. What a nice group
of guys, he said. How refreshing to see with
today's lack of role models, someone added.
Of course, it would be wrong to classify
each and every athlete at Stanford as a role
model. However, the image is certainly
much more prevalent here than at many of
the nation's other major universities. The
combinations of athletics and academics,
achievements and modesty, are interesting
ones and make Stanford a pleasant place.
The Athletic Department has dubbed
Stanford the "Home of Champions." While
the past few years have included an enor
mous amount of success, it is the start of a
new year and the Cardinal must prove itself
once again if it wants to keep this reputation.
This means not only performing well, but
also providing some magical moments as
well.
