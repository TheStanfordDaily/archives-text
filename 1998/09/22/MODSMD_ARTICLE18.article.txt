# Card beaten by Green in Dartmouth tourney
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Entering Sunday's game against
the Dartmouth Big Green (3-0), the
Stanford men's soccer team was
looking for a tournament champi
onship, a three-game road winning
streak and more confidence heading
into the bulk of the season.
The Big Green, however, had
plans of its own that put a halt to the
Cardinal's.
In Sunday's championship game
of the Men's Soccer Classic at Dart
mouth, the No. 19 Cardinal (4-2) fell
to Dartmouth, 2-0. Stanford finished
second in the tournament, having
convincingly recorded a 3-0 defeat
over No. 13 Boston University (4-1)
on Saturday.
The match-up between Stanford
and Dartmouth was touted during
the preseason by Soccer America as
one of the top five games of the sea
son. This hype brought a crowd of
2,200 people to Dartmouth's Chase
Field to witness this color war. Dart
mouth treated its crowd to a defen
sive show and the tournament title.
The crushing defeat to Dart
mouth was not the finale to the east
coast trip that Stanford had hoped
for.
"It was definitely a bittersweet
weekend," said head coach Bobby
Clark. "We played well in both
games, but it wasn't to be."
In Clark's first return to Dart
mouth, where he coached from 1985-
1994, many mixed emotions flowed
after the Cardinal's defeat in the
final. The teams fought to a 0-0 tie
last year on the Farm, but this year's
game was dominated by the Green.
"Today was a tough one," Clark
said. "We did some things very well,
but we lost two goals at vital times."
The Big Green's first goal put
Stanford behind early in the match
and the Cardinal was never able to
catch up.

Only four minutes into the game,
Dartmouth senior Chris Pedrick set
tled a throw-in at the 12-yard line.
Stanford was unable to clear the ball
and Pedrick got off a clean shot, fir
ing the ball into the upper right cor
ner of the net. The shot was out of the
reach of redshirt sophomore goalie
Adam Zapala and resulted in the Big
Green's early 1-0 lead.
Dartmouth added an insurance
goal early in the second half. Again, it
was the mistake on a set play that
hurt the Cardinal. On a corner kick in
the 52nd minute, Dartmouth senior
Chris Dedicik found himself in the
right place at the right time.
The corner kick was initially
headed towards the goal, but Zapala
made the save. Zapala deflected the
ball back into play directly to Dedi
cik, who put it back into the net.
Unable to create much offense
against Dartmouth's solid defense,
the Cardinal managed only 11 shots
and forced the Big Green's keeper
Matt Nyman to make only one save.
"This was a terrific result for us
against a fine Stanford side," said
Dartmouth head coach Fran
O'Leary. "Stanford is an excellent
club, and on another day they could
easily have gotten the result."
Stanford had advanced to the
championship game with an impres
sive 3-0 victory over BU.
The match against BU was "defi
nitely one of the best performances
I've seen from a Stanford team in my
three years here," Clark said.
Much of the match was played at
the midfield, but Stanford went on
top just before the half with a goal by
senior Jamie Clark. The trip to New
Hampshire was a homecoming for
Jamie Clark who went to high school
in Hanover, down the street from
Dartmouth.
The defender converted a corner
kick from senior captain AJ. Sauer
