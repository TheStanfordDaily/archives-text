# Water polo upset by No. 3 USC
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
The Stanford men's water polo team may have fin
ished fifth in the Southern California Water Polo Tour
nament last weekend, but the Cardinal can still consid
er itself one of the best teams in the nation.
Stanford was ranked No. 1 in the nation before the
tournament, but the results of the poll did not come out
until after the tournament seedings had been deter
mined.
Because seeds for the tournament were determined
by draw, Stanford joined the group of teams vying for
fifth through eighth places and had to face eventual
tournament champion USC in its second game of the
tournament.
The Cardinal dominated UC-Irvine in Sunday's
fifth-place game, beating the Anteaters 13-7.
Junior Jonathan Skaalen and senior Layne Beaubien
each scored three goals to lead the Cardinal offense. Ju
nior Sean Joy and senior Arturo Rodelo contributed
two points each and junior Brian Heifferon and senior
David Hay rounded out the scoring with one goal
apiece.
All-American goalie Chris Aguilera notched 11
saves during the match.
"We really dominated [at the tournament]," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "The results were really
a result of the seeding," Dettamanti said. "We were the
No. 1-ranked team, but we drew numbers out of a hat.
So we had to play USC in the first round."
In Sunday's first game, the Cardinal took down Long
Beach State, 10-6. Heifferon led the team in scoring with
four goals, including one two-pointer. Beaubien scored
twice (one two-pointer), and senior David Hay and
Rodelo both scored once.
The team's first loss of the season came in its second
game on Saturday, when they fell 7-6 to USC.
The Cardinal led the Trojans 4-2 at halftime, but
Heifferon, who had already scored twice, was pulled out
of the game after being called for his third personal foul.
With hole-set Hay already sidelined with an infected
elbow, Stanford was missing two of its top players. USC
evened the score with two points in the third quarter,
then outscored the Cardinal 3-2 in the last period of
play.
"It was unfortunate and the timing wasn't right,"
Dettamanti said. "We had to play Air Force first and
USC got to scout us, but we didn't have the chance to see
them play, so they had an advantage. We were their first
game [of the tournament].
