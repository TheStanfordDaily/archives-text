# Water polo upset by No. 3 USC
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
The Stanford men's water polo team may have fin
ished fifth in the Southern California Water Polo Tour
nament last weekend, but the Cardinal can still consid
er itself one of the best teams in the nation.
Stanford was ranked No. 1 in the nation before the
tournament, but the results of the poll did not come out
until after the tournament seedings had been deter
mined.
Because seeds for the tournament were determined
by draw, Stanford joined the group of teams vying for
fifth through eighth places and had to face eventual
tournament champion USC in its second game of the
tournament.
The Cardinal dominated UC-Irvine in Sunday's
fifth-place game, beating the Anteaters 13-7.
Junior Jonathan Skaalen and senior Layne Beaubien
each scored three goals to lead the Cardinal offense. Ju
nior Sean Joy and senior Arturo Rodelo contributed
two points each and junior Brian Heifferon and senior
David Hay rounded out the scoring with one goal
apiece.
All-American goalie Chris Aguilera notched 11
saves during the match.
"We really dominated [at the tournament]," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "The results were really
a result of the seeding," Dettamanti said. "We were the
No. 1-ranked team, but we drew numbers out of a hat.
So we had to play USC in the first round."
In Sunday's first game, the Cardinal took down Long
Beach State, 10-6. Heifferon led the team in scoring with
four goals, including one two-pointer. Beaubien scored
twice (one two-pointer), and senior David Hay and
Rodelo both scored once.
The team's first loss of the season came in its second
game on Saturday, when they fell 7-6 to USC.
The Cardinal led the Trojans 4-2 at halftime, but
Heifferon, who had already scored twice, was pulled out
of the game after being called for his third personal foul.
With hole-set Hay already sidelined with an infected
elbow, Stanford was missing two of its top players. USC
evened the score with two points in the third quarter,
then outscored the Cardinal 3-2 in the last period of
play.
"It was unfortunate and the timing wasn't right,"
Dettamanti said. "We had to play Air Force first and
USC got to scout us, but we didn't have the chance to see
them play, so they had an advantage. We were their first
game [of the tournament].

Despite strong offensive performances such as that of senior hole
man Layne Beaubien, the men's water polo team was forced to set
tle for fifth place at the Southern California Tournament in Newport
because of its loss to eventual champion USC.
"We didn't have Hay and Heif
feron for the whole second half and
we still only lost by one." Dettaman
ti said. "We really came on strong at
the end of the tournament. Irvine
beat us in a tournament this sum
mer. But this team has a history of
playing better the second time
around.".
Dettamanti also cited the in
ternational depth of LISC as one of
the factors in the loss. "USC has four
really strong foreign players," he
said. "[They] scored every goal. Hut
we know them now and well play
them better the second time around.
I really feel confident we can beat
them next time"
The Cardinal opened the tourna
ment with a 10-3 victory against Air
Force on Saturday. Senior Jeremiah
Robison, Heifferon and Rodelo led
the scoring with two points apiece.
Aguilera had another solid day in
the goal and tallied 10 saves in the
match.
The Cardinal men did accom

plish a lot over the weekend.
The team totaled 55 points and 12
of the 13 players who traveled
scored at least once. Aguilera ended
up with over 40 saves.
"Our defense was excellent and
our offense really came together, es
pecially in the game against Irvine,"
said Dettamanti. "Skaalen really
picked it up. He scored four points in
the game against Irvine and Beaubi
en played really steady.
"Everybody really came through
and started putting it together."
Because Stanford's finish in the
tournament was due in part to the
way the tournament was seeded, the
team won't know where it stands in
the national rankings until the next
coaches poll comes out later this
week. But Dettamanti remained op
timistic.
"We're going to have a lot of
tough games, but its going to be a
good year." Dettamanti said. "Now
we have films of all the teams, we've
scouted all the teams, we've played
five of the teams This is a team
that is always better the second time
around. I'm really confident in our
ability to beat all of these teams."
