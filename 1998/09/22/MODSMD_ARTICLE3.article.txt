# Dunn leaving student affairs
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
A palm-reading college friend
once told Heather Dunn that she
enjoyed working behind the
scenes.
Dunn's work at Stanford has
shown just that. Dunn will leave
her post as assistant director of
Student Activities and director of
New Student Orientation Friday,
following seven years of work at
the University.
Dunn, who is leaving Stanford
to live with her new husband in
Sacramento, has had a hand in
everything from the Greek pledge
symposiums to Orientation to the
holiday craft fair at Tresidder
Union
As part of her job as assistant di
rector of Student Activities, Dunn
has filled the role of advisor to fra
ternities.
Dunn has spent much of her
time here pushing for women's
equality in the Greek system. In
her first year at Stanford, she en
countered some resentment from
fraternity members at having a
woman as their adviser. Regard
less, Dunn said. "I'd like to think
I've done a good job advising the
men."
Working with Director of Stu
dent Affairs Nanci Howe and the
Greek Task Force, Dunn realized
the University's goal of housing
sororities on campus. This year two
sororities, Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Alpha Theta, obtained
housing in Gowell Cluster.
"[The I JniversityJ awards multi
million dollar houses to men,"
Dunn said. "I think women have
equally important reasons to have
that."
"Heather has boundless energy,
lots of creativity, and is the ulti
mate organizer," Howe said. "That
kind of energy, creativity and com
mitment will certainly be missed."
Dunn has also been involved in
her share of controversy in dealing
with fraternities, but she has taken
those incidents in stride. "If I'm not
from time to time a little bit con
troversial. I'm probably not oing

a good job," she said.
She proelaimed with a smile
that despite her reputation as a
"party-buster." she has only ever
walked into one Stanford party.
Dunn has had a hand in regulat
ing parties, however, including
calling Stanford Police to break
them up. She worked with the
Dean of Students Office to devel
op campus-wide party planning
guidelines. Confusion over these
guidelines were one major source
of friction between Dunn and
members of the fraternity system.
She also helped start the Greek
pledge symposiums, which bring
fraternity and sorority pledges into
small group discussions about col
lective responsibilities, hazing, al
cohol abuse and sexual assault.
"Heather has balanced the ob
jectives of [Greek] chapters with
the overall University mission,"
said senior Mike Martinez, a mem
ber of Sigma Nu and Interfraterni
ty Council president.
Although advising the Greek
community has been a large part of
Dunn's job at Stanford, she has
also spent the past four years di
recting Orientation with four stu
dent coordinators.
"I think she's brought Orienta
tion to a much higher level," said
junior Melora Krebs Carter, head
Orientation coordinator. "She has
a lot of great ideas and has been re
ally good ;it implementing them."
Dunn worked on formalizing
the parents' lunch, other parent
Orientation programming, and
helped make I iostcd 112 licks a big
part of Orientation.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
called Dunn's work with Orienta
tion "a tribute to her organization
aland management skills and a tes
tament to the quality of the student
coordinators .... She's been able
to do a remarkable job with limited
resources," he said.
In addition, Dunn has worked
as advisor to various student
groups, including The Bridge peer
counseling center, class presidents
and the Blythe Fund.
As program coordinator for
the Stanford Community Partner
ship in Cowell Health Promotions
Services, she oversaw 10 interns
who worked to analyze alcohol
and drug use in different commu
nities on campus and formulate
community-specific interventions
to prevent substance abuse.
Dunn said her favorite experi
ence at Stanford has been "to see
students at the end of four years,
or five or six, to see their growth
and maturation ... to know I've
had a little part in that.'"
Dunn will be advising student
activities and fraternities at Sacra
mento State University. Although
she received the offer for her new
job this summer, Dunn has stayed
to see this year's Orientation to its
completion.
"It was important to me to fin
ish things here," she said.
The Dean of Students Office
will meet soon to discuss how to
fill Dunn's place in her absence.
Dunn will be honored in a
farewell reception this Wednes
day.
