# All guaranteed students housed in Draw
## 
### Ryan kalember 
Almost all undergraduates who were unassigned after
the Draw last May reeeived housing in the walk-in Draw
Sunday and Monday.
In past years, walk-ins waited until the middle of the
first week of the quarter before they were able to draw for
housing. Complaints from students who spent nights on
friends' floors and in eais before the Draw prompted
Housing Assignment Services to move up the date.
"Students were telling us that they just wanted any
room they could uet." said I lousing Assignment Services

manager Kathleen Bransfield. "I
think it was really a good move."
In the midst of a visible housing
crisis at Stanford, 105 students re
mained unhoused after the July
Draw for unassigned students. Sev
enty-two of those undergraduates
had a guaranteed year of housing
and had chosen to accept any avail
able room, giving them the highest
priority.
Eight students who had a guaran
teed year but made restrictive choic
es were a slightly lower priority. All
of these students were offered
rooms. However, seven spaces re
main available.
The remainder of the unassigned
students have no guaranteed year
and remain unhoused. They await
openings that may occur if any as
signed students did not show up by
yesterday's check-in deadline.
In all, walk-ins filled 85 vacancies
in undergraduate residences. While
the bulk of spaces were in Stern and
other dormitories that typically
draw badly, several lucky walk-ins
were able to get into Row houses
such as Xanadu and Storey. Most of
the assignments to sought-after
houses, however, went to students
who sought reassignment in the July

Draw.
The undergraduate housing
shortage, which is not as severe as
the graduate problem, was a sur
mountable obstacle for Housing As
signment Services.
"I think we solved the problem,
but I don't think we oversolved it,"
said Bransfield. "Winter quarter is
peak occupancy at Stanford with
students often returning from over
seas, but we're exactly where I
would want us to be."
Housing Assignment Services
was able to accommodate several
unique developments this quarter.
Students who had planned to go to
Moscow before political and finan
cial instabilities led to the cancella
tion of the program this fall were ac
commodated by the walk-in Draw
without any significant problems.
In addition, Housing Assignment
Services was able to convert some of
the student rooms in Florence
Moore Hall back to study rooms.
Room 305 in each Flo Mo dormitory
will again be a study room, while
room 205 will continue to be a stu
dent room.
In general, students reacted well
to being unassigned, a potentially
harrowing experience. Allison Bell,
an unassigned sophomore who
ended up in Cardenal, exclaimed,
"I'm psyched about where I was as
signed. Being unassigned made last

year kind of anti-climactic, and I
worried about having a random
roommate, but everything turned
out great."
"I couldn't have asked for a bet
ter unassigned experience. I was
nervous, but the people at Housing
Assignment Services held an orien
tation and made themselves avail
able to answer any questions I had,"
said Dana Hoggat, a senior who also
landed in Cardenal.
At a campus where about 93 per
cent of undergraduates live on cam
pus, small shifts in student demand
for housing can result in shortages.
"If half of 1 percent more of under
grads decide that they want housing,
we have to find 30 beds," said Brans
field. "Thankfully, it looks like we'll
have enough this year."
