# All guaranteed students housed in Draw

Almost all undergraduates who were unassigned after
the Draw last May reeeived housing in the walk-in Draw
Sunday and Monday.
In past years, walk-ins waited until the middle of the
first week of the quarter before they were able to draw for
housing. Complaints from students who spent nights on
friends' floors and in eais before the Draw prompted
Housing Assignment Services to move up the date.
"Students were telling us that they just wanted any
room they could uet." said I lousing Assignment Services
