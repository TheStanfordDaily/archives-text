# Multimedia language lab near to completion
## 
### Erica Platt Contributing writer 
As p;irt of a project to introduce m Itime
dia technology to foreign language instruc
tion, the language lab on the second floor of
Meyer library has been redesigned.
The Digital Language Learning Project in
cludes a new hands-on classroom where stu
dents can take advantage of computer-based
learning activities. Outside of class time, stu
dents will take online exams, complete study

sets, and practice language skills in the new
multimedia lab.
"We want students to be able to communi
cate at a more advanced level of eonversa
tion," said Elizabeth Bernhardt. Director ol
the Language ( enter. "The question at the
( enter was how to reach this level without ae
tually increasing the amount of time spent in
class."
The language program enrolls 1500 siu-
dents, roughly an entire Stanford
graduating class, each quarter. To
ensure that each student receives
maximum input and interaction
from the 47 full-time language pro
fessors, the Language Center, in
partnership with Research and In
structional Technologies Support,
have created a Weh-hased data
base for testing students outside of
class time.
"By removing downtime activi
ties, like quizzes and paperwork,
where an instructor is not critical,
and turning to technology," said
Bernhardt, "we have increased the
amount of in-class time devoted to
language instruction and immer
sion." The center estimates that re
moving testing time from class
hours will free up about 15 percent
of instructional time.
"Only one other university,
Brigham Young, uses a network
for oral language assessment," said
Bernhardt. "Furthermore, no
other school has a full program in
place in which the entire campus
benefits.
"From the beginning, we have

moved in a consistent direction in
collaboration with University Li
braries and Academic Information
Resources to create a prototype
for more multimedia initiatives
throughout the University."
Language professors have also
been looking forward to the
changes.
"Many of us have been trying to
incorporate technology in the class
room," said Hisayo Lipton, a lec
turer in the Asian Languages de
partment. "We've started with class
Web sites and online listening exer
cises, but are very excited to use the
new language lab to make a tighter
connection between language and
multimedia technology."
With the new Web interface, in
structors will be able to log in and
listen to students oral assignments
and to create exams and study sets
with multimedia clips. Such feed
back provides faculty members
with an easy way of evaluating
class performance and class needs.
Students, meanwhile, will have
electronic access to these tests and
can also complete assignments on
line, using materials stored in the
multimedia database.
The new facility is set to open in
early October.
