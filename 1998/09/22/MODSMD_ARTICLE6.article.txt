# Smoothin' the Stanford site
## Student life Web link redesigned 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
I he days of muddling through a per
plexing Stanford World Wide Web site are
numbered.
I lie (Mficeof the Vice-Provost gave the
"student life" site, a link off the main Stan
lord Web site, a face-lift this summer. The
site will be launched later this week.
These changes are the first of many, as
the Office of I University Communications
prepares to revamp the top levels ol the
Stanford Web site.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya conducted focus groups with stu
dents last year and found that students felt
the student life site was difficult to
manuever through. To better meet the
needs of students. Montoya and his staff
decided to redo the site.
"We found that students wanted to
know about University resources without
having to look through several different
departments, as you had to do with the old
site." said Troy Gilbert, assistant to the
vice provost.
Montoya's office appointed junior Ben

Longoria to work on the site this summer
and to have it organized in a manner that
was easier for students to use. The student
life link now takes a user to four main sec
tions â€” academic resources, student ser
vices. student clubs and organizations and
job resources.
"The beauty of this is that [the materi
al] is all laid out in order," said Gilbert.
"It's accessible, and you don't have to go
through several other links to get to what
you want."
