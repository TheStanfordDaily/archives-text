# Smoothin' the Stanford site
## Student life Web link redesigned 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
I he days of muddling through a per
plexing Stanford World Wide Web site are
numbered.
I lie (Mficeof the Vice-Provost gave the
"student life" site, a link off the main Stan
lord Web site, a face-lift this summer. The
site will be launched later this week.
These changes are the first of many, as
the Office of I University Communications
prepares to revamp the top levels ol the
Stanford Web site.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya conducted focus groups with stu
dents last year and found that students felt
the student life site was difficult to
manuever through. To better meet the
needs of students. Montoya and his staff
decided to redo the site.
"We found that students wanted to
know about University resources without
having to look through several different
departments, as you had to do with the old
site." said Troy Gilbert, assistant to the
vice provost.
Montoya's office appointed junior Ben

Longoria to work on the site this summer
and to have it organized in a manner that
was easier for students to use. The student
life link now takes a user to four main sec
tions — academic resources, student ser
vices. student clubs and organizations and
job resources.
"The beauty of this is that [the materi
al] is all laid out in order," said Gilbert.
"It's accessible, and you don't have to go
through several other links to get to what
you want."
Each link under the main sections
goes directly to a "commonly asked
questions" page. "If a student were
to click on Housing and Dining Ser
vices under student services, it
would take them directly to a 'ques
tions page,' which would list ques
tions like, 'What do I do if I lose my
[SUID] card?'" said Gilbert.
The "commonly asked ques
tions" page for each organization

will also include information such as
hours of operation, important phone
numbers and any online services
that may exist.
Some new additions to the stu
dent life link include a Bursar s Of
fice link, where students can check
the status of their bills and a link to
Judicial Affairs, which covers issues
such as the Honor Code.
The process to change the main
pages of the Stanford site has been
underway for the past eight weeks.
News Service, part of University
Communications, is overseeing the
content of the new pages, while In

formation Technology Systems and
Services handles technical aspects.
The Stanford home page previ
ously fell under only ITSS, but juris
diction over its editorial content was
shifted to News Service in April.
News Service is revamping the
Web site not only because of this
new responsibility, but also because
it has been two years since the home
page has been altered.
Alan Acosta, director of News
Service, along with Andy Krackov,
Web managing editor for News Ser
vice and other News Service staff
members are currently communicat

ing with other offices to develop
pages according to their needs.
"Because Stanford is an inter
connected community, we feel that
it is our role to communicate with
people on how they want certain
pages to be," said Acosta.
"We've been through several
edits of our prototype Web site to
make sure that the new design is user
friendly," said Krackov. "The stu
dent life site is basically a sneak pre
view of what's to come."
The new address is
http://www.stanford.edu/home/
