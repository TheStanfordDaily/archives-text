# New grapes effort
## Teaching, voting to be centralized 
### 
By Jennie Berry

The newly
formed Grapes
Education Com
mittee is making
programs and vot
ing on the United

Farm Workers' grape boycott
more uniform this year than ever
before.
All residences will have an Oc
tober educational program, possi
bly using a new 30-minute grapes
debate video. Then, in November,
they will all vote on the grapes issue
within a one-week time span.
"This committee is going to cre
ate greater awareness about the
grapes issue, enhance the educa
tional resources, and improve the
promotion and organization of the
voting process," Dean of Students
Marc Wais promised.
The University President and
Provost in 1995 had charged both
the Dean of Students Office and
Office of Residential Education
"to collect and make available bal
anced informational materials that
can be used by the residences."
But, up until this point. Res Ed
headed up both grape programs
and voting.
"Based on the charge and
staffing patterns, it seemed natural
for the majority of the program
ming to be developed by the Res
Ed staff," explained Wais.
Now the Dean of Students office
and Res Ed are working together to
centralize the grapes education
process. Even the chairman of the


Woon
Ed into the grapes debate, could be
another cause of student protest
about the committee standardiza
tion.
"We also realize the educational
value of this initiative may take on
greater importance in all-frosh
houses where many students will be
exposed to this important issue for
the first time," Wais admitted.
Fraga, though, said such annual
updates are necessary. "The evi
dence on the issue can change over
time," Fraga said. It is important
that we have the most updated in
formation possible. We would ex
pect nothing less of Stanford."
Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo formed
the committee earlier this year in a
response to complaints that grapes
education was inconsistent and

Concerns among resident assis
tants were raised about the amount
of grapes information provided for
them in their one-hour grapes de
bate orientation session. But Woon
contended that the committee ex
pects resident assistants to be dis
cussion leaders, not experts on the
issue.
"I can understand how some
people can feel that our orientation
to the RAs didn't prepare the RAs
adequately to facilitate the discus
sion," Woon said. "But we want
them to have the skills to facilitate
the discussion and rely on the mate
rials provided."
Woon also said more informa
tion will be provided for residence
staff through residence fellow corre
spondence and e-mail to RAs that
will both remind them of education

standardized week as a key tenet of
the new education program. He ex
plained that the proposal for a stan
dardized week would enable better
publicity of voting results.
He noted that the committee was
not convinced that having the vote a
few weeks later would lessen divi
sion within a house.
Moreover, Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga, now-disband
ed Grape Policy Committee, argued
that a University is an ideal location
for a debate.
"It's a complex issue about which
there are differences of opinion, but
what better place than a university
to consider a complex issue?" he
said.
Having education and voting be
for all houses, including those with
only upperclassmen already initiat

al program plans and encourage
staff to have discussions on how to
approach the issue.
Some Res Ed staff, according to
Wais, have voiced another concern
over the years: "the issue potential
ly could be perceived as divisive in
their efforts to establish community
within their house during fall quar
ter."
But Wais did continue, "We're
sensitive to this concern and view
our charge from the President and
Provost within the educational mis
sion of the University."
This concern is augmented by the
fact that now all residences must
conduct a vote during a one-week
set interval, thereby limiting resi
dence staff flexibility to respond to
tensions that might exist in a house.
However, Woon stood by the

often fell to members of the Chi
cano community.
"Historically, we've had varying
levels of success in terms of both the
quality and quantity of our educa
tional outreach programs," Wais
said.
Woon hopes this year's efforts
will improve both education quality
and quantity, but he is certainly
open to change in future years.
"If it turns out that lots of people
on this campus are really uninterest
ed in this issue regardless of how
much programming we have, then
we need to reexamine our assump
tions about grapes education and
voting," Woon said.
At the conclusion of voting, the
Grapes Education Committee will
evaluate the 1998 grapes effort and
may make changes accordingly.

However, as the charge also dic
tated, the education and voting will
remain residence-based.
"With the advent of the grapes
committee, the Dean's office is play
ing a more central role, but the pri
mary education and programs will
still be with the folks in Res Ed,"
Waissaid.
