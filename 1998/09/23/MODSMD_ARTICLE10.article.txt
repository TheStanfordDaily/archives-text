# Teen abortion measure dies in Senate

### 
WASHING TON (AP) â€” A bill making it a crime
to avoid parental involvement laws by taking a minor to
another state for an abortion stalled Tuesday in the
Senate and its Republican sponsor conceded that tlie
issue is probably dead for the year.
Given the crush of business pending before the Sen
ate's Oct. 9 adjournment target, "the likelihood that we
will be able to continue with respect to this legislation
during this Senate session seems very unlikely." said
Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., the sponsor.
The 54-45 procedural vote handed abortion oppo
nents their second defeat in less than a week. Sixty
votes were needed to cut off debate and proceed to the
bill. On Friday, the Senate fell three votes short ol over

riding President ( linton's veto of a ban on certain late
term abortions.
Abortion rights advocates, who said such a law
would endanger teen-agers facing unintended pregnan
cies, applauded the vote Tuesday.
Roger Rathman, spokesman for the Planned Par
enthood Federation of America, said the bill would do
"nothing to protect the health of teen-agers or promote
family communication."
The I louse voted 276-150 in July for a similar bill. It
would make it a crime for anyone other than a parent
or legal guardian to take a minor to a state without
parental consent and notification laws for an abortion.
More than 30 states have such laws.
