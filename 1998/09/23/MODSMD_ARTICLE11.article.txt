# GOP plans impeachment inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans intend to
bring a formal inquiry of impeachment to the House
floor within the next two weeks, GOP sources said
Tuesday. Democrats renewed talk of a lesser sanction
for President Clinton, perhaps a censure along with a
financial penalty.
The maneuvering in Congress unfolded as the
White House, after digesting nearly 3,200 newly
released pages of Kenneth Starr's evidence, lashed
out at the independent counsel for ignoring "all rea
sonable standards of fairness in preparing and draft
ing" his highly publicized report to lawmakers citing
evidence of impeachable offenses.
In particular, Clinton's lawyers wrote the Judicia
ry Committee contending that Starr's report included
150 pages of "gratuitous and graphic sexual details,"
At the same time, attorneys David Kendall and
Charles Ruff wrote, Starr excluded this statement
that Monica Lewinsky made before the grand jury:
"No one ever asked me to lie and I was never
promised a job for my silence."
Several Republican sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said work had begun on drafting the
terms of an impeachment inquiry, legislation likely to
empower the panel to conduct its own investigation
of the facts in the case.
It was not clear whether the Judiciary Committee
would be limited to investigating matters contained in
Starr s report, or would be authorized to range more
broadly, perhaps into other areas Starr is probing, or
perhaps into alleged campaign fund-raising viola
tions.
It is likely that some action will be taken before
Congress adjourns, said one Republican aide. Other
officials said the likeliest time for a vote on the House
floor was the week after next. Congress has set Oct. 9
as its target adjournment date.
The disclosure came as Republicans on the Judi
ciary Committee met to review the panel's work thus
far, and plan its next steps.
Among the decisions to be made: the terms under
which more than a dozen boxes of Starr's still-secret
evidence would be released. These include grand jury
testimony by several key figures, including presiden
tial secretary Betty Currie, Clinton's friend Vernon
Jordan and Linda Tripp.
Even as committee Republicans were meeting,
officials were preparing for a session on Wednesday

in which Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican leader
Dick Armey, Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and
'he leaders of the Judiciary Committee would sit
down to discuss the impeachment review.
A similar meeting two weeks ago produced
pledges ot bipartisanship from both parties, but that
glow that faded quickly.
Democrats complained that Republicans toiceu
the release of more sexually explicit material than
was necessary, and they were unhappy that Rep
Henry Hyde, R-111., the chairman of tne Judiciary
Committee, made a unilateral request to a trial judge
in Arkansas for a videotape of Clinton s deposition in
the Paula Jones lawsuit.
For their part, Republicans complained thai
Democrats on the Judiciary ( ommittee were trying
to slow the release of documents that the entire
House — including a solid majority of Democrats —
had already voted to release.
In a sign of the ill feeling that exists. Democrats
were balking at requests from Republicans that
reporters and television cameras be permitted into
the meeting room on Wednesday for a few moments.
Privately, Democrats said they were having fresh
discussion about the political equivalent of a plea bar
gain in which Clinton would agree to a censure, a fine
and possibly an appearance before the Judiciary
Committee, and Republicans would shield the presi
dent from impeachment and possibly shelter the pres
ident from legal action by Starr.
In political terms, according to two Democratic
sources, merely floating such a proposal would give
Democrats additional ammunition in the ongoing
public relations war. Democrats would be seen as
offering a way to end the controversy, and at the
same time they could back punishment for the presi
dent, two approaches that Americans tell pollsters
they favor.
The suggestion that Clinton make an appearance
before the Judiciary Committee surfaced on Sunday,
in comments that Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., made in
a televised interview.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said at a news
conference with reporters the idea would "probably
be a positive development," and Kerry telephoned
Gingrich to review the idea, although an aide to the
speaker said the two men did not get into a substan
tive discussion.
