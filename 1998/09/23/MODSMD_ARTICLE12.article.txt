Orientation committees work made
new students excited about Stanford and
gave players the psychological support ol

The department would be wise, for
example, to schedule "class spirit" events,
where members of particular classes got
Irec or. at least, significantly discounted
tickets.

commit to treating next yeai's incoming
students to a free home game

praise for its efforts to maki Stanford a
welcome home lor newcomers to the
Farm. The Athletics Marketing Division
should continue the trend of generosits
inspired by Orientation's leadership, and
consider alternative means of boosting
attendance.
Lower immediate profits could ulti
mately mean happier-— and more abun
