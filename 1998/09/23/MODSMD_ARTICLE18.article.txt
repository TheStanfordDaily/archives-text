## Cycling team's star shines at nationals Troxell takes first place 
### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
While many of Stanford's club sports teams are just
getting organized for the new school year, the Stanford
cycling team has gotten off to a quick start. Stanford
placed third in the overall team standings at the Nation
al Collegiate Cycling Association's 1998 Track Cycling
Nationals, helped a great deal by the outstanding per
formance of MI) / Ph.D. student Megan Troxell.
Having a great performance over the three-day com
petition, held September 17-19, Troxell won the
women's omnium, which is the overall individual title for
the national competition. Not only did she win the indi
vidual title in the meet held in Indianapolis, but Troxell
was a major factor in Stanford's combined men's and
women's overall third place finish as well.
I lie omnium title is determined by a combined point
tally of several events over the course of the weekend
meet. Racers have their choice of four events, three of
which they must count towards their point total.
Troxell is a specialist in the three kilometer race. In
the three-kilometer race, riders are alone on the track,
racing only against the clock. Troxell won the event by a
margin of more than 12 seconds, with a total time of 3:55.
"I rode 10 seconds faster than at track nationals last
year, which is a lot in a four-minute event," Troxell said.
"Last year, a very famous world record holder showed
up.. .[and] I loaned her a wheel so she could enter the
pursuit and she beat me by 13 seconds."
This year, however, was a different story.
Also helping her overall performance was a fourth

place finish in the 500-meter time trial. Many considered
that this event was too short for Troxell to excel, but
Troxell surpassed her previous personal record in the
event by 1.4 seconds. Her total time for the event was
39.8 seconds.
Even with these two outstanding performances the
omnium title was not yet secured for Troxell. The indi
vidual title came down to the final sprint of the points
race. In the final moments of the 60-lap race, the omni
um hung in the balance of one sprint. Troxell was not
only able to keep up with host Marian College's top
rider, but beat the competition to the finish as well. In
beating the Marian rider, Troxell also secured the points
competition win for Stanford teammate Cynthia Fergu
son.
"It was the last event of the weekend and I knew it
would make a big difference in who won the overall om
nium," Troxell said. "I like point races a lot but I have
trouble scoring points if I can't break away from the
field."
Troxell seemed pretty pleased with the way things
turned out, however.
"It couldn't have worked out better for Stanford,"
she added. "It was a very, very close race."
A student in cellular biology, Troxell has been an in
fluential member of the Stanford cycling team since
1994, and it appears as if she has begun another great
year.
Having just finished the track season, cycling will
now start the mountain biking portion of the year to be
followed by the road racing season later in the school
year.
