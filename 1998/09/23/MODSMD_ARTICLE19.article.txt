# Diedrick joins Cardinal
## 
### Michaela Crouch Editorial staff 
He coached the nation's top
rated quarterback in passing effi
ciency. a No. I NFI. draft pick, three
bowl teams in the past three ears,
and won an NCAA Division 1 A A
championship along with a Canadi
an Football League divisional
championship.
After the departure of Dana
Bible, the Cardinal's offensive coor
dinator who left the Farm for a
coaching position with the Philadel
phia Eagles, Stanford hired the dis
tinguished veteran offensive coordi
nator and quarterbacks coach who
made all of these accomplish

ments — Bill Diedrick.
Diedrick's previous position was
with Pacific 10 Conference rival
Washington as an offensive coordi
nator and quarterbacks coach in
1994-95 and as a quarterbacks coach
from 1996-97.
The 1995 Huskies' offense
ranked among the school's all-time
top five in total offense and total
yards per game and set a new school
record in total yards per play. These
accomplishments came against op
ponents comprising the nation's
seventh most difficult schedule. The
team was also the first Washington
offense to score at least 20 points in


Bill Diedrick
every regular-season game.
In that remarkable season,
Diedrick also coached the quarter
back who became the Huskies' all
time leader in passing and total
yards, Damon Huard.
Something that may have made
Diedrick's move a little easier, how
ever, is the lack of a Cardinal-
Huskies game on this season's
schedule.
"It is always hard to leave,"
Diedrick said. "But I'm fortunate
that for one year we won't play each
other,"
Diedrick has had experience
coaching other great quarterbacks
as well. In his stint at Idaho, he
coached future NFL starter John
Friesz.
While on the coaching staff at
Washington State, Diedrick
coached the nation's most efficient

passer and a No. 1 draft pick. Drew
Bledsoe. The Cougars' offense,
under the direction of Diedrick, led
the Pac-10 and ranked in the top 10
nationally.
So, after all of these successes,
why did Diedrick decide to take a
position at Stanford?
"There are three main reasons
why I decided to come to Stanford,"
Diedrick said. "One, the school itself
and its offensive tradition. Two, the
history and tradition of great quar
terbacks. Three, Coach Willingham.
Overall, these things made Stanford
a very attractive opportunity."
With such a young Cardinal team
this season, Diedrick has had some
difficulty with Stanford's lack of "an
established go-to guy." He also
hopes to let the Cardinal "grow up"
a little before making any major
changes in Stanford's offensive look.
But even with the Cardinal's
youth, the team has been making
forward strides.
"I'm pleased with our young kids'

progress," Diedrick said. "All our
young kids have come along much
quicker than projected. To ask
younger players to play at a school of
this quality level as freshmen is a
lot."
Diedrick also recognizes the
added difficulty his freshmen will
face now that Stanford's academic
year is beginning.
Although the Cardinal's under
classmen have been progressing at a
surprising rate, there is one area in
which Diedrick had hoped Stanford
might have advanced a little fur
ther.
"I wish we were executing bet
ter," Diedrick said. "Especially with
penalties and other things that af
fected us more in the Arizona game.
We really destroyed ourselves." 1
The Cardinal's newest coach
does, though, seem to truly appreci
ate his new life here in California.
"I enjoy it here very much,"
Diedrick said. "It is a wonderful area
and 1 am really getting spoiled."
