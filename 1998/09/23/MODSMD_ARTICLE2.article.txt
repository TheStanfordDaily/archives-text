# Labor board chair Gould comes back to Law School
## 
### Matt Spence Staff Writer 
After completing a four-year stint
as director of the National Labor Re
lations Board, Law Prof. William
Gould is looking forward to returning
to his teaching post at the Law
School.
The pictures in Gould's office tell
his story best. President Clinton's
1994 order designating him Director
of the NLRB is sandwiched between
photos of him shaking hands with
baseball great Ted Williams and
meeting Clinton.
It was in his role as director that
Gould's two loves — politics and
baseball — collided in 1995, when he
was charged with ending the Major
League Baseball strike. It was an un
canny blend of his professional and

personal passions.
"There are many things that hap
pened which seemed like serendipi
ty," said Gould.
Gould successfully helped save
the 1995 baseball season, but his
greatest challenges in Washington lay
ahead.
Sitting behind a cluttered desk of
law journals and political memorabil
ia from his four year tenure at the
NLRB, Gould reflected on the bridge
between Washington politics and
Stanford academics.
" The NLRB is extremely relevant
to the Stanford community ... It is re
ally a referee of labor disputes in the
private sector," excluding airlines and
railroads, Gould explained.
The NLRB, an independent fed
eral agency created by New Deal leg
islation. investigates and remedies

labor and employee disputes in ad
ministering the National Labor Rela
tions Act.
Gould entered the post at what he
described as a time of crisis for Amer
ican labor. Twelve years of neglect by
the Reagan and Bush administrations
had severely weakened the organiza
tion. Gould said.
"My job was to try to lead the
board back to the center, lead the
board back to its role as impartial ar
biter between labor and employees,"
he said.
Gould considers his tenure a suc
cess. Under his helm, Gould said, the
NLRB boasted a better success rate
in the courts than the agency has had
in previous years.
However, Gould said that a Re

Museum. The museum, renamed the Cantor Center for the Visual Arts, will reopen in January.
publican Congress that he believes
"opposed the basic tenets of the Na
tional Labor Relations Act" created
a difficult and tumultuous time.
"I tried to keep my eye on the ball
...on the importance of enforcing and
interpreting the law." he said.
Gould said he realized early on
that heavy partisanship would domi
nate his stint in Washington.
Pointing to the original tally sheet
of the Senate vote for his confirma
tion as director, which hangs on his
office wall, Gould noted that he had
the most "no" votes of any successful
appointment in the Clinton adminis
tration to date.
"I had a very stormy and difficult
confirmation process." Gould said
with some regret.
Through the difficult times,
Gould drew strength from the mem
ory of his great-grandfather, a former

slave who later fought in the Civil
War. Gould's grandfather kept a de
tailed diary of his three years in the
Union Navy, which Gould read dur
ing difficult times in Washington.
"His commitment to public ser
vice and his belief in U.S. govern
ment ... has been a source of strength
and sustenance for me," tiould said.
Gould returns to a large cast of
Law School faculty who are Wash
ington alumni. He joins a \former
commissioner of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, a former as
sistant Attorney General, and other
executive branch officials.
Michael Wald, professor of law,
said working for the Department of
Health and Human Services in
Washington gave him a new perspec
tive in the classroom.
"Much of government functions
on the selling part of things, rather
than the thinking aspects. In that
sense, it's refreshing to return to
academia," said Wald.
Law professor Janet Halley

stressed the law school's good for
tune to have Gould back.
"Labor was pronounced dead
some time ago, but it has risen from
the grave," she said.
Though Gould is happy to be back
to this "tranquil environment — a
luxury you didn't have in a joh like
mine in Washington,"he will miss the
challenges of political life.
"I will miss that feeling every day,
going into my office to face a new on
slaught," he said.
In the spring, Gould will teach a
class on law and sports. He looks for
ward to exploring the "relationship
between what goes on off the field
and what goes on the field," he said.
More importantly, Gould is re
turning to his close ties with the Stan
ford community. Before leaving for
Washington in 1994, the professor
could be found hitting fly balls with
his students in the baseball stadium.
Alter a stint in the big leagues for
a while, Gould is looking forward to
playing hall at home.
