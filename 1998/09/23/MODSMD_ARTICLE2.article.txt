# Labor board chair Gould comes back to Law School

### Matt Spence Staff Writer 
After completing a four-year stint
as director of the National Labor Re
lations Board, Law Prof. William
Gould is looking forward to returning
to his teaching post at the Law
School.
The pictures in Gould's office tell
his story best. President Clinton's
1994 order designating him Director
of the NLRB is sandwiched between
photos of him shaking hands with
baseball great Ted Williams and
meeting Clinton.
It was in his role as director that
Gould's two loves — politics and
baseball — collided in 1995, when he
was charged with ending the Major
League Baseball strike. It was an un

personal passions.
"There are many things that hap

private sector," excluding airlines and
railroads, Gould explained.

labor and employee disputes in ad
ministering the National Labor Rela
tions Act.
Gould entered the post at what he
described as a time of crisis for Amer
ican labor. Twelve years of neglect by
the Reagan and Bush administrations
had severely weakened the organiza
tion. Gould said.
"My job was to try to lead the
board back to the center, lead the
board back to its role as impartial ar
biter between labor and employees,"
he said.
Gould considers his tenure a suc
cess. Under his helm, Gould said, the
NLRB boasted a better success rate
in the courts than the agency has had
in previous years.
