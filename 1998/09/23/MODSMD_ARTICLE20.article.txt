Walters Listed as Day-to-Day
Troy Walters is listed as day-to
day for Saturday's game at Ore
gon after injuring his ankle in the
first quarter of Stanford's 31-14
loss to Arizona and sitting out last
week's victory.
"As of today, no |he won't
play]. But don't hold nic to it."
said head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "It could change."
Oregon's artificial turf, the
only turf field the Cardinal will en
counter this season, may play a
role in the decision.
The Battle to Replace Walters
Troy's absence has resulted in a
baptism by fire for some of the
younger Stanford receivers. Hut
while sophomores Tafiti Uso and
Dave Davis have been rushed into
action, fifth-year senior Jeff Allen
is finally getting his chance to
shine.
Against North Carolina, Allen
caught 5 passes for 111 yards and
his first touchdown, a nine-yard
strike from quarterback Todd
Husak in the second quarter.
"It's exciting getting to play
now." Allen said. "I played mostly
special teams, because there were
so many talented receivers. It was
tough. Obviously I wanted to play,
but just contributing to the team in
any way is great."
Not a Bunch of Sitting Ducks
One of the primary problems
Oregon poses is its overwhelming
speed, a problem compounded H\
the artificial turf .it Autzen Stadi
um
"They've alwavs been fast."

Willingham said. "It showed in
last year's game. You also see it on
their defense. They force a lot of |
turnovers and I think that's due |
primarily to their team speed."
That speed has led to some im
pressive offensive displays, in
cluding an average of over 30
points per game.
In the first quarter against San '
Jose State last week, the Ducks
held the ball for just over a minute,
but still managed to score 21
points on a punt return and a kick
off return in addtion to a tight end
fly pattern.
The week before, Oregon
squeaked past UTFT after upset
ting Michigan State in a blow-out
victory.
"When people look at the con
ference. they don't usually put
Oregon at the top Hut when you
play them, you see they're a very
quick team." Willingham said.
firing In 'l)a Noise
Stanford will also have to deal
with Autzen's loud, frenzied at
mosphere.
"It will probably be the loudest
place we play this year," Willing
ham said, an impressive compli
ment considering that his ( 'ardinal
will also visit South Bend and
use.
When asked if he would consid
er piping in sound to duplicate the j
noise at Autzen. Willingham was j
non-committal. "Maybe. Thanks
for the idea."
Placekicker and punter Kevin
Miller was less concerned
. "1 think it may help energize
the puvs "
Miller kicked thrve li
