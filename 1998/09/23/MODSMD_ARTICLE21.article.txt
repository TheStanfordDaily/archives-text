### Michaela Crouch Editorial Staff 
While Stanford's sailing team's
regular season runs throughout the
academic year, stretching from
I ah 11 I )a\ to Memorial l)a\. il is the
<la\s alter Memorial Da\ that the
team tiaditionallv strives for. With
the national championships late 111
sp ins" mat 1 -r, the team has plents of
tin l' re| Hi and sea 1 >1 its \oiine
sailors.
For the first time in many years,
s two varsitv sailing smiads

have fallen from the top 10 rankings.
With the graduation of many top rac
ers. including Ail-American Honor
able Mentions John Meade and Dan
Zimhaldi, both the coed and the
women's teams will struggle to return
to their previous forms.
Auot her new development for the
team is better competition 011 the
West ( oast. I he Cardinal has usually
been dominant in the west and been
forced to travel to the East ('oast for
more competitive races.
'We've definitely been the best in
llu- West." said Stanford head coach

Steve Bourdow. "IJSC might move
on top of us this year, but it is good to
have competition in the West to help
us achieve our goals."
With two powerful transfers to
USC from the Naval Academy, the
Trojans look to be the favorites in the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association, a change from
the norm.
The West Coast has not been
known as a sailing powerhouse, with
usually only four teams ranking in the
top 20. Traditionally, Stanford's best
competition comes from schools in

New England and the Mid-Atlantic.
Most of the 2(X) schools that sponsor
teams are located on the East Coast.
For the past three weekends, the
Cardinal has raced in some signifi
cant regattas against this difficult
competition from the East Coast.
Last weekend, at King's Point for
the Nevins Trophy, the Cardinal
raced three boats and finished 14th.
A bright spot was the dinghy of
sophomore skipper Heather Porter
and crew Sally Madsen, who finished
ninth in their division.
Two weekends ago, at the Hurst
Bowl at Dartmouth, Stanford fin
ished 17th.
In Stanford's first race of the sea
son. the Harry Anderson Regatta at
Yale, the Cardinal raced two boats
and finished 16th out of 20 teams.
"We're not doing that great in
overall standings," Bourdow said,
"but we are doing well for ourselves."
Stanford has lost some great
sailors in the past few years and is
now faced with a team filled with
younger and less experienced racers.
"We've been at the top for quite a
while, but now we are going to drop,"
Bourdow said. "We want to [give
our] people experience and focus on
practical skills."
The Cardinal will be most inter
ested in improvement. It will not be
as concerned with the overall nation
al standings.
"Right now. we'll be learning
skills instead of learning how to use
those skills," Bourdow said. "We're
really focused on development and
seeing the positive in our results."
The Cardinal hosts a small regatta
CXt. 3-4 before hosting a major inter
sectional regatta Oct. 24-25 in Red
wood City.
