Quack Medicine?
While alternative medical therapies were once considered unsci
entific by the medical establishment, a new study shows that the
majority of Americans now use such therapies regularly. Comple
mentary and Alternative Medicine, which encompasses a wide range
of practices such as acupuncture, meditation, yoga and massage, was
shown to be important to most Americans in a survey released at
Stanford last week.
The results from the telephone survey of 1,000 Americans showed
that 69 percent had used some form of alternative therapy in the past
year. During that period, survey participants also saw traditional
physicians an average of four times. Researchers from the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Prevention have concluded from this
data that nontraditional medicine has become an integral part of
American health care, and that lines no longer need to be drawn
between traditional and alternative medicine.
Cardiovascular medicine professor William Haskell was the prin
cipal investigator in the Stanford section of a National Institutes of
Health study on the effectiveness of alternative therapies. "Based on
this [survey] and other details, we are getting a clearer picture of how
CAM and traditional medicine are becoming interwoven," he said.
Furthermore, Americans appear to want more control over their
health care options. When asked whether their health plans should
cover alternative medicine, more than 56 percent said yes. Respon
dents said they would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 on aver
age per month for health insurance that covers alternative therapy.
Health educator Wes Alles, director of the SCRDP's Health
Improvement Program, agreed. "The public doesn't choose between
alternative and traditional medicine. Rather, they see the options in a
single toolbox and want to choose what works best for them instead
of being restricted by arbitrary definitions."
However, Alles offered the caveat that some challenges and obli
gations have yet to be met before complementary medicine can truly
become accepted. "Whether we are talking about vitamins, yoga,
acupuncture, massage, chiropractic or a variety of other practices,
physicians should be candid with their patients about which tech
niques they feel are most appropriate for each patient" he said.
