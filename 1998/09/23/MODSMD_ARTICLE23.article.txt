# Mentoring women in science
## 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
An online mentoring program
designed to help female students in
the fields of science and engineering
will kick off its first year at Stanford
this fall.
Stanford is one of over 15 univer
sities that are currently enrolled in
Mentor Net, a new program housed
in the College of Engineering at San
Jose State University.
"Given the extreme underrepre
sentation [of women] in engineering
and other related sciences, there is
good justification for targeting
women specifically," said Carol
Muller, the executive director of
Mentor Net. Muller received a doc
torate in education from Stanford.
Although women make up 46
percent of the U.S. workforce, only
9 percent of U.S. engineers are
female.
Mentor Net seeks to establish
relationships between college stu
dents and corporate mentors

through e-mail and Internet
resources.
The mentors and students build
their own relationship, communicat
ing by e-mail at least once a week.
The mentor shares guidance and
experience to help the student learn
about or establish a career in science
and engineering.
For Susan Clement, Stanford
representative for the Mentor Net
program, the program has practical
ly run itself. Clement is the assistant
dean of graduate student affairs in
the School of Engineering .
"My role was very simple,"
Clement said. "I just put the infor
mation out there, and the students
ran with it."
The program kickoff is riding on
the momentum of a successful pilot
organization, which involved over
200 students from 15 universities
across the nation.
Stanford was one of the most
active universities in the pilot pro
gram, with 29 women assigned to
mentors.

"Stanford was one of the largest
participants, mostly because we
have two active women's groups at
Stanford," she said.
Clement was referring to the
Society for Women in Engineering
and the Graduate Womens' Net
work, who did a lot of the legwork in
spreading the word about the men
toring opportunities.
Universities also participating in
the pilot program included UC-
Berkeley, Dartmouth. Cornell and
San Jose State. Many others are
now interested in instituting a pro
gram at their universities.
Students have been assigned to
mentors from a variety of high-tech
corporations including AT&T,
Intel, DuPont, IBM. Merck,
Motorola, Oracle and Microsoft.
However, the program is still con
strained by the number of mentors
that are available.
Mentor Net searches for corpo
rate mentors by contacting compa
nies and working to designate com
pany representatives who can refer

ideal mentor candidates.
The application process is really
quite simple.
"Students go on the Web and fill
out the form," Clement said. "Then
[Mentor Net] does the matches."
Mentor Net uses software that
sorts the database of potential men
tors and students and identifies pos
sible matches.
A mentoring specialist then
makes the final match.
About 50 universities now want
to join, Muller said. Mentor Net is
scheduling its growth carefully to
ensure that the program does not
expand faster than its resources do.
As well as having a limited num
ber of available mentors, Mentor-
Net is currently limited by funding.
The service currently survives on
grants from AT&T, Intel and the
U.S. Department of Education.
Muller and her staff are searching
for more sponsors.
Mentor Net is primarily Muller's
brainchild; she first tested the con
cept of electronic mentoring at
Dartmouth in 1995. It is a project of
the Women in Engineering Pro
grams and Advocates Network.
"Right away, people saw the
opportunities to link up [universities
and businesses]," Muller said of the
rapid increase in email use during
the mid-1990'5.
Students can apply for the pro
gram over the Internet at

Although the program is
intended for women, men can also
participate.
