# Research seeks to reduce nitrogen pollution
## 
### Ryan Chuang Staff writer 
As an integral part of our atmosphere, nitrogen is
essential for life on Earth. But nitrogen pollution is a
growing environmental problem
Stanford researchers Pamela Matson, an earth sci
ences professor, and Rosamond Naylor, an economist
with the Institute for International Studies, have
teamed up to study to study the connection between
agricultural methods and nitrogen pollution.
Matson and Naylor worked with Ivan Ortiz-Monas
terio, an agronomist at the International Maize and
Wheat Research Institution, in the Yaqui Valley in
Sonora, Mexico. Agronomy is the the study of the sci
ence and economics of crops.
Matson and Naylor, with Ortiz-Monasterio, com
bined their skills to form a multi-disciplinary approach
to reducing nitrogen pollution in farming.
The researchers experimented with different fertiliz
ing methods on wheat crops in the Yaqui Valley. They
tried to find a scheme that would reduce nitrogen gas
emissions without hurting the quality and yield of the
wheat crops and the farmer's overall profits.
Though most organisms do not use nitrogen gas
directly, some bacteria and algae can convert the nitro
gen into compounds indispensable to plants and ani
mals.
These natural processes add between 90 to 140 mil
lion tons of nitrogen to the land every year. Additional
ly, people use roughly another 80 million tons of nitro
gen fertilizer a year. Some estimates expect that amount
to double over the next 50 years.

However, this extra nitrogen does not come without
cost. Excess nitrogen, coming primarily from farm fer
tilizer, wreaks havoc on the environment.
Nitrogen pollution contributes to global warming,
ozone depletion, water pollution and the degradation of
ecosystems. As food demands increase globally, scien

tists predict that there will be an increase a *

in fertilization use in devel
oping countries due to
increased food demands. As
a result, nitrogen pollution
will become a more signifi
cant problem.
As an agricultural

area in a develop
ing country, the
Yaqui Valley was
an ideal place for
the study. Twen
ty-five years of

government subsidies

have resulted in high fertiliza

tion rates there. However, due to

NAFTA and agricultural reforms in

Mexico, these subsidies have recently
ended.

Generally, a wheat farmer in the
Yaqui Valley adds most of the fertilizer
before any planting begins and applies the remaining
amount six weeks after planting.
Initially, Matson, Naylor and Ortiz-Monasterio
mimicked the farmers' methods. From this, they found
that the farmers' usual fertilization methods lead to

large emissions of nitrogen gases — in the form of
nitrous oxide and nitric oxide — from the soil.
They then-experimented with alternative- fertiliza
tion practices. The study found that fertilizers could be
greatly reduced by adding more fertilizer later in the
crop season, when the plants are growing most rapidly.
Using 28 percent less fertilizer than the farmers, the
research team was able to reduce nitrogen gas emis
sions by 95 percent.
Their new process also diminished total nitrogen
losses to the air, soil and water by almost a third.

Fertilizer applied
too early is often lost before
plants have a chance to use
it. Applying it later mini
mizes the risk of such losses
and feeds the plants
when they need it the

most.
Although
this improved fer
tilization method
requires more
labor than the
farmers' conven
tional practices,
there are still defi
nite economic ben
efits.

Nitrogen losses correspond to wasted fertilizer, and
fertilizer is the highest variable cost in farming. To
determine whether the new procedure saves money,
Naylor compared its costs and benefits to those of the

old methods. She found Ihe new process was 17 percent
eheaper than the standard due to the reduced fertilizer
purchnses and decreased nitrogen los* rates
Some farmers in the Yaqui Valley have started to
follow the researchers' best fertilization scheme. Next
season, more farmers in the Yaqui Valley will he using
this new method, Matson said.
However, Matson and Naylor say that the farmers
are cautious and choose first to test the new method on
a smaller scale. So far, these on-farm trials have been
successful.
Work has also continued in developing a nitrogen
index that the farmers can use to measure the amount
of nitrogen in the soil. This enables them to know how
much fertilizer they need to add, Matson said.
Matson, Naylor and Ortiz-Monasterio hope that
their findings from the Yaqui Valley study will lead to
further studies of the links between the environment,
economics and society. The Yaqui Valley study was
revolutionary in bringing together individuals from dif
ferent fields in approaching the same problem.
Currently, Professor Matson, along with other Stan
ford researchers from a variety of different depart
ments, is in the proposal stage for another nitrogen
related project in Mexico which will study the interac
tions between terrestrial and marine systems in the Sea
of Cortes.
Though funding such projects is difficult. Professor
Matson finds such integrated research exciting and
potentially very rewarding
Indeed, as the success of the Yaqui Valley study
shows, the results of such collaborations can be very
fruitful.
