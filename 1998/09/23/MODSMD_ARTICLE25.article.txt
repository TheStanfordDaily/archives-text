# Going nuts over carbon nanotubes
## 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
While some Stanford science
students struggle over understand
ing the time schedule, a few chem
istry doctoral students are exploring
the fabrication of oxide nanostruc
tures using carbon nanotube tips.
The recent discovery of the nan
otubes, which are cylindrical, car
bon-based microscopic structures,
has sparked a flurry of research in a
variety of fields and applications.
Chemistry Prof. Hongjie Dai,
with the help of chemistry doctoral
student Nathan Franklin, is begin
ning his second year of work with
the carbon nanotubes in his labora
tory. Their recent work focuses on
the use of nanotubes in microscopes
such as the Atomic Force
Microsope (AFM) and the Scan
ning Tunneling Microscope (STM).
So, what are these nanotubes?
Basically, the nanotubes are a
variation on Buckyballs. The Buck
yball is a near-spherical carbon
microstructure that was discovered
by Richard Smalley, who won the
Nobel Prize for his work.

Visualize the Buckyball as a soc
cer ball. If this soccer ball was
stretched along one axis until it was
nearly cylindrical, it would take the
form of a carbon nanotube.
These nanotubes are remarkably
strong. In fact, they are the
strongest known structures on
Earth.
"They are stronger than steel
and lighter than steel," said
Franklin.
Their durability as well as their
high conductivity has resulted in
multiple research opportunities.
"Nanotubes were discovered in
1991," Franklin said. "Now people
are working like mad (on them]."
Dai's lab work has implications
for microscopes as well as the semi
conductor industry.
Using the name "microscope" is
somewhat deceiving to a non
microchemist. Their microscopes,
such as the AFM and the STM, are
not all light-based.
The nanotube is used as a small
tip, like a needle on a record player,
which scans the microsurface of
objects. Because the tip is so small,
it allows excellent visualization.

The nanotube tips can also etch
microstructures as small as 10
nanometers on silicon surfaces.
These tips are ideal because they
last longer than the silicon tubes
commonly used. The silicon tips can
wear down and become unuseable.
Nanotubes are more durable
than silicon tips. When bent, they
bounce back like straws.
For circuit production, the possi
bilities that the durability and
microscopic size of carbon nan
otubes imply are quite provocative.
Lithography is one of the most
important steps in circuit produc
tion. This involves placing a layer of
a substance called "resist" on a base
of silicon. The resist is then
removed in certain places by expos
ing those areas to light. These
etched-out areas are a foundation
for the design of the circuit.
Carbon nanotubes, which do not
use light, allow for much smaller
versions of these structures by alter
ing this lithography step. The size of
the etchings in the lithography step
are, in essence, constrained by the
wavelength of visible light. The
width of these lines are on the order

of MX) nanometers
In contrast, the carbon nan
otubes produce lines that are 10 to
15 nanometers wide. The tiny nan
otubes are attached to the tradition
al silicon tips and dragged like a
pencil over the surface of the sili
con. If the nanotubcs are at the
proper voltage, the silicon is oxi
dized upon contact with the nan
otubcs.
With a much smaller scale than
previous lithography methods, if
used, the nanotubes will result in
much more detail on circuits.
"You'll have the same chip, but
with more on it," Franklin said. Of
course, this could catch on like wild
fire.
Most applications for these nan
otubes are still in the research stage.
The Dai lab uses a machine which
controls just one of these nanotube
tips. The machine costs $1(X),(XX).
Such costs are not feasible for the
semiconductor industry.
Nevertheless, Dai and Franklin,
are continuing their work on these
tiny and fascinating structures,
while the rest of us live life comfort
ably on the macro level.
