# Museum on schedule to open Jan. 23
## 
### Jennifer Stewart 
After nine years, the Stanford
University Museum of Art will re
open Jan. 23 with a new name and
a new look. To honor two major
donors, the museum will reopen
under the name the Iris & B. Ger
ald Cantor Center for Visual Arts.
The center is named in honor of
the Cantors, who have donated
over 180 Rodin sculptures and
510.6 million to the museum. The
money has allowed the museum to
repair damages which closed the
museum after the 1989 Loma Pri
eta Earthquake.
The newly named center will in
clude not only the old art museum
but also the newly expanded Le
iand Stanford Junior Museum
building, the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den and several other new garden
areas. When the Center reopens,
more of its collection will be on
view than at any other time in the
museum's century-long history.
Several events are planned to
celebrate the opening of the cen
ter. Jan. 23 will be Stanford Day,
with the museum open to students,
faculty, staff and alumni. The cen
ter will be open to the general pub
lic the following day. Admission is
free.
The Cantors have no formal af
filiation with Stanford. Gerald
Cantor was a financier who died in
1996 at the age of 79. His widow.
Iris Cantor, currently splits her
time between New York and Los
Angeles and is actively involved in
philanthropic work.
Both Rodin aficionados, the
Cantors had one of the largest pri
vate collections of Rodins, which
they donated to Stanford over the

course of 20 years.
In addition to a new name, the
center also has new outdoor art
work. Currently on view in the
South Sculpture Garden is "Ish
mael," by Richard Serra. The
piece, inspired by the narrator
from "Moby Dick," is on loan from
Gap magnate Donald Fisher.
Another new sculpture is Claes
Oldenburg's "Soft Inverted Q," a
three-and-a-half ton pink inverted
letter Q. Oldenburg's sculpture is a
gift and will be on permanent dis
play. Both pieces will be part of
regularly scheduled docent tours
of the outside art collection when
the center reopens.
Students will soon be seeing
more new artwork at the museum.
The museum received a $40,000
grant from the Museum Loan Net
work that will allow the museum to
exhibit 32 pieces of loaned art
work. As a result of the grant, art
work from the Metropolitan Mu
seum of Art, the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archeol
ogy and Anthropology, the Wal
ters Art Gallery and the Norton
Simon Museum will be displayed
on loan.
Regardless of what name the
museum reopens under, staff at the
center feel that it can contribute
greatly to campus life. Mona Dug
gan, associate director and director
of external relations, says that
what most excites her about the re
opening of the museum is that,
"the center has the potential to en
rich campus life greatly, and to be
come an important resource for
the teaching program."
