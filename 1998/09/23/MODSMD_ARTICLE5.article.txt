# You're in the ocean now
## Students hit the waves in kayaks

Editor's note: hi an attempt to get the
Daily staff up and out of the office, we've
decided to send writers out on local adven
tures. Wrenn Levenberg recently went surf
kayaking.
Killing the waves atop a light-weight
nine foot kayak, paddle in hand, wet suit
clinging, white caps splashing, wind blow
ing, sun shining: surf-kayaking—what a
fabulous way to spend a Sunday.
The Stinson Beach Health Club sits on
Highway I south of Stinson Beach. We
enter, looking to rent kayaks.
While locals work out at the weight lift
ing machines, we meet Donny, a lookalike
for Jeff Spicoli, Sean Perm's character
from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."
This sandy blond man in his forties, with
hair to his shoulders and a long moustache,
sports a worn, but loved T-shirt, surfer
shorts, flip-flops, sunglasses hanging on his
neck, and a San Francisco 49ers sun
bleached visor—the perfect uniform for
the perfect job.
He greets our group of prospective
surfers with a wide grin. The only thing we
notice, though, is the sign posted behind
him alerting everyone of a shark sighting
and attack about four weeks ago.
Donnie helps us load the kayaks on top

of our car. find wet suits, life jackets, pad
dles, and the Crazy Creek chairs. He tells
us to have a good time and he'll see us later.
The car heads towards Bolinas. a quaint
hippie town of fewer than 4(H) people and a
northern destination for city dwelling
surfers. Driving away from Stinson Beach,
Bolinas is located just around the other

side of the Bolinas Lagoon.
The beach in Bolinas is not manned by
life guards or rangers. There are no
garbage cans and no pretentious beach
goers. As we eager kayakers schlep the
equipment down to the beach from the

road, we pass couples relaxing in the
sun and little boys just learning to
surf, playing at the shore on their
boogie boards.
After chowing down on some de
licious gourmet salsa and home
made tortilla chips, we. the surf
kayaking initiates, are ready to hit
the water.
Ha. This is not such an easy task
when you don't know what you are
doing. Just to get out to the surf line,
you must fight against the incoming
waves. The experienced kayaker of
the group, UC-Berkeley graduate
student Josh Kriesel, advises us to
face the waves head on, paddle hard,
try not to close our eyes or turn side
ways because that makes it harder
and we might fall out. He empha
sizes that we keep paddling, though,
whatever ends up happening.
From Minnesota, the land of
10.000 lakes, Kriesel came out to
California an experienced paddler.
He had extensive experience in sea
kayaking and white water canoeing,
but he had never surfed before.
"Surf kayaking is a unique
sport," he tells us. "You can master
it in a day. but you can perfect your
technique over time. When you're
riding the waves, you understand
why surfers are so crazy about the
sport and the ocean [and] spend the
entire day in the water waiting for
good waves."
Armed with bright purple and
blue paddles, we step into the water
with the kayaks.
The questions: How do you get
in. or ON the kayak? Do you gentlv

sit, do you jump, do you first wait for
the waves to pass?
The answer? Trial and error.
One kayaker gets in, jams her
feet against the foot slots and begins
to paddle. The waves come in with
such force, though, that she is imme
diately knocked over side ways and
falls off the kayak.
My turn. Paddling furiously to
get out of the breaking waves and
behind the surf line, the water
splashes over the boat, into my face
and down my wetsuit. As each wave
comes in, all I can do is brace myself
and hope that I don't get knocked
out of the boat. Finally, I make it out
past the breaking waves.
Now, the fun part. One of the
kayakers faces the waves, waiting
for a good one. When it finally
comes, he quickly turns around and
paddles hard to ride it in. Of course,
the surf kayaker must keep paddling
and try to stay upright, too.
He briefly rides on top of the
water but, alas, falls out of the
kayak, bumps his head, and gets
water up his nose and in his ears.
Hanging out just before the surf
line, I wait with the rest of the surfers
for a good wave, all the while bask
ing in the sun and chatting it up with
the other kayakers in our group.
Finally, the wave arrives. I quick
ly turn around and begin paddling.
The sensation of the wave hits the
back of the kayak first and then lifts
me up. The front of the kayak sticks
out in the air as I ride the water.
Aside from seeing my paddles mov
ing, the members of the group who
are left behind can only see the
mountain of water behind me.
The adrenaline is pumping, my
stomach is tight, I scream and catch

my breath. What an amazing crazy
ride. I feel completely out of control,
hut it's an awesome out of control.
The wave must have carried me 50
to 75 yards all the way into shore.
"As a beginner, you get that scary
feeling in your stomach when you
see a wave approaching," explained
Julie Levenberg, a senior. "But,
when you don't chicken out and you
ride the wave and you paddle hard
enough so you don't tip over, it's so
fun and exhilarating."
We spend the rest of the after
noon floating with the surfers in the
mouth of the lagoon. The current in
that part of the Bay causes a move
ment of water in and out of the
mouth. According to Donny, the
north storms that come in hit the
west facing beaches. These storms
miss Bolinas, a south facing beach.
Instead, Bolinas gets west and south
swells that cause soft, slow breaking
waves, ideal for surfing. Back on the
beach, the sand is whipping as we
rest in the sun and snack on purple
grapes.
Soon it is time to go and while the
car gets reloaded with the equip
ment, a local surfer overhears one of
our kayakers declare her longing to
purchase a wet suit. He approaches
the group and offers her a wet suit
for free, noting that he had recently
bought five used wet suits for one
dollar each at a garage sale.
She thanks him and says, "Next
time you are here, come over to
where we are and we'll give you a
beer." The surfer replies, "Actually,
if you know any 17-year-old girls,
that would be great!" We laugh and
turn to get in the car, sighing with re
lief that none of us are still in high
school.
