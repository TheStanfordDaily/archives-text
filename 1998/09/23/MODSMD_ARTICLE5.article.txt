Editor's note: hi an attempt to get the
Daily staff up and out of the office, we've
decided to send writers out on local adven
tures. Wrenn Levenberg recently went surf

nine foot kayak, paddle in hand, wet suit

Bolinas is located just around the other

side of the Bolinas Lagoon.
The beach in Bolinas is not manned by
life guards or rangers. There are no
