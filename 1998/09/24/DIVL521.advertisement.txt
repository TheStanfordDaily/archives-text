A MESSAGE FROM PHI BETA KAPPA, STANFORD CHAPTER
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their
undergraduate scholarly accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is
open to undergraduates of all majors. To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve
academic distinction in the major as well as in courses across a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number,
about one fifth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines (revised July, 1997) define "breadth" of study as excellence beyond the
major field. To be considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in
the Spring Quarter, at least three courses iin each of the following three major domains of knowledge:
Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math; and Social Sciences. To be considered for election, transfer
students must have taken at least two courses at Stanford in two of these major domains.
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the
BULLETIN for the undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Courses taken for
GER Area 1 will not be considered as satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
A grade of"+" or "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" criterion
is not considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students
wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of
students' names from their academic records before consideration. Students who desire that their records
not be made available for consideration by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the
Registrar, room 133, Old Union.
