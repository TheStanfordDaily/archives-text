Marroquin's main goals are t<.» make their orga
nization responsive to the student body.
"It's heen a goal since day one to make it a
different ASSI . a more user-friendly place,"
said Norton.
She and Marroquin know, however, that if
they want to change the ASSU. they have a
tough road ahead.
"You almost have to combat the images of
your predecessors," Norton added. "You get
asked, "are you like so-and-so' and you have to
prove that you're not.
"We know that there has been overspending
in the past, but we're not planning on it. We still

have plenty of boxes of post-its."
Norton. Marroquin and the ASSU senators
began working on several projects over the
summer. Chief among them were the course
guide and the community calendar. On the
agenda for the forthcoming year is a student
group survey and an online forum for student
input.
This summer, the senators decided to release
the course guide only in an online version.
"It's a huge expense to print it, and we didn't
wartt to do it until we'd worked out the bugs."
said Norton.
"We want 7,(XM) undergraduates to really
look at it and pick though it, and last year that
didn't happen," added Santos.
