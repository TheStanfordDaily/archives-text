## Norton, Marroquin set goals 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Pledging to run a "hands-on" / SSI J, Presi
dent Maren Norton and Vice President Santos
Marroquin's main goals are t<.» make their orga
nization responsive to the student body.
"It's heen a goal since day one to make it a
different ASSI . a more user-friendly place,"
said Norton.
She and Marroquin know, however, that if
they want to change the ASSU. they have a
tough road ahead.
"You almost have to combat the images of
your predecessors," Norton added. "You get
asked, "are you like so-and-so' and you have to
prove that you're not.
"We know that there has been overspending
in the past, but we're not planning on it. We still

have plenty of boxes of post-its."
Norton. Marroquin and the ASSU senators
began working on several projects over the
summer. Chief among them were the course
guide and the community calendar. On the
agenda for the forthcoming year is a student
group survey and an online forum for student
input.
This summer, the senators decided to release
the course guide only in an online version.
"It's a huge expense to print it, and we didn't
wartt to do it until we'd worked out the bugs."
said Norton.
"We want 7,(XM) undergraduates to really
look at it and pick though it, and last year that
didn't happen," added Santos.

ASSU Executive Branch
1998-1999 Goals
• Improved ASSU Course Guide
• Community Calendar
• Streamlined financial dealings with student
groups
• Online forum for student comment
• Greater student representation through
Senators' being assigned constituencies
http://assu.stanford.edu, contains in
formation, comments and demo
graphic information on over 2,(XX)
classes.
Another ASSU summer project
was the creation of a community cal
endar.
"The calendar is a way to consoli
date information from various stu
dent groups," said Norton. "If you
belong to a group, you can find out
when meetings or practices are, or
you can look at dorm sites or other
student-oriented sites."
For the coming year. Norton and
Marroquin's most important plans
involve closer student-ASSU inter
action, namely, the "constituency
idea."
"Every senator was assigned a
number of student groups and resi
dences to be responsible for," ex
plained Norton. "We tried to match
senators up with the areas they live in
and the activities they participate in."
By having each senator responsi
ble directly for given groups and dor
mitories, the ASSU hopes to in
crease interaction and accountability
between the two sides.
In a related project, the ASSU
will be conducting a student group
survey to discover and eventually

solve the groups' major organiza
tional hurdles.
"I was the head of the ChapaiTal,
and I know how hard it can be to
work with the ASSU bank and with
Event Services to book a space," said
Marroquin.
Additionally, Norton is "hoping
to implement a student voice forum
as a link to the new ASSU Web site
as a way for students to discuss vvjhat
is important to them."
Students will be able to post mes
sages on the forum, which will; be
read and catalogued.
For Marroquin, the drive U> in
clude more student input into Uni
versity affairs came from his interac
tions with Residential Education last
year.
Many students, including Marro
quin, felt that Res Ed did not make
adequate efforts to consult the stu
dent body before converting Alpha
Sigma into the Kappa Alpha Theta
house.
"[Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James] Montoya said to me
'Santos, lets make sure that that
doesn't happen again,' and I want to
make sure as well."
For the first time, senators this
year attended a two-day retreat be
fore the beginning of school.
"It gave them a lot of information
that I wish I had when I was a sena
tor," said Marroquin.
