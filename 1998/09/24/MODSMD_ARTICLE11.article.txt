• UNITED NATIONS (AP)
Pakistan's prime minister said
Wednesday his country would uni-
Jaterally adhere to the nuclear test
ban treaty, but warned that compli
ance would depend on whether rival
India resumed its tests.
Nawaz Sharif s;iid Pakistan was
ready to adhere to the pact if eco
nomic sanctions imposed after it con
ducted nuclear tests in May were lift
ed.
"Pakistan is . . . prepared to
adhere to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty," Sharif told world lead
ers at the United Nations General
Assembly session.
"in this regard, we expect that the
arbitrary restrictions imposed on
Pakistan by multilateral institutions
will be speedily removed." Sharif
.said.
After India and Pakistan carried

out nuclear tests, the United States
and other nations imposed economic
sanctions, cutting off all loans.
That measure has been especially
tough on Pakistan, which has been
struggling with severe economic
woes.
Sharif warned that Pakistan
would comply with a ban on nuclear
tests only so long as India did not
carry out any more tests.
"II India were to resume nuclear
testing. Pakistan will review its posi
tion." Sharif said.
Pakistan and India have been
locked in simmering territorial dis
pute over Kashmir, which became
ominous after the tests.
Shelling across the Kashmir divid
ing line, which is monitored bv the
United Nations, routinely breaks out
between the hostile neighbors. The
last maior exchanee was in late Julv

and early August, when shelling
killed more than 1 (X) civilians on
both sides of the border.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said he welcomed Pakistan's
decision.
"I welcome warmly the statement
made by the prime minister of Pak
istan today declaring his country's
intention of signing the CTBT,"
Annan said in a statement.
"The government of Pakistan is
to be commended for heeding the
concern of the international commu
nity," he said.
The Pakistani announcement is
likely to increase pressure on India
to sign on to the treaty as well.
Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said after a meeting
with Sharif earlier Wednesday that
his country's nuclear policy did not
depend on Pakistan.
