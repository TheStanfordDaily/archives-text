# Time limit on inquiry denied

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Speaker Newt Gingrich
rejected a call from the House's top Democrat
Wednesday to impose a time limit on a looming
impeachment inquiry and suggested President Clinton
speed the process by having reluctant aides answer
grand jury questions.
In a swift rebuttal, presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry said Gingrich, the leader of House Republi
cans, will bear the blame for a process that could "drag
on and on and on endlessly" in defiance of the public's
wishes.
The volleys from opposite ends of Pennsylvania
Avenue underscored the hardening of partisan lines a
few weeks before national elections, even as both sides
professed to favor a cooperative approach to the
nation's first impeachment inquiry since Watergate.
Republican officials said the Judiciary Committee
would probably meet next week to hear senior lawyers
lay out the evidence that Independent Counsel Ken
neth Starr has submitted, much of which has been made
public. The full House would vote for a formal
impeachment inquiry before adjourning in early Octo
ber. and hearings would begin after the Nov. 3 election.
One Republican familiar with the deliberations said
GOP officials were considering a plan to allow the Judi
ciary Committee to enlarge its inquiry to include addi
tional facts that might be considered impeachable
offenses. That would permit the committee to range far
beyond Clinton and his relationship with Monica

Lewinsky, and into areas such as alleged fund-raising
violations in the president's re-election campaign.
Democrats served notice they would vigorously con
test any expansion of the case beyond Starr's evidence
relating to Lewinsky.
"This does not need to take eight or nine months, as
it did during the Watergate period," he said at a news
conference after a closed-door meeting with Gingrich
and other leading lawmakers.
For his part, Gingrich also scoffed at Democratic
suggestions for the equivalent of a plea bargain under
which Clinton would be spared impeachment, but cen
sured, possibly fined and otherwise punished.
"For anybody to talk about doing anything before
we finish the investigative process simply puts the cart
before the horse," the House speaker told reporters.
In comments to reporters later, Gingrich said the
timing of the impeachment inquiry "depends, for
example, on whether or not the president instructs his
staff to testify. It depends on whether the attitude is
obstruction or the attitude is cooperation."
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House
Democratic leader, and the White House seemed
resigned to the virtual certainty that the House will
launch a formal impeachment inquiry. The Missouri
Democrat, for example, called on Republicans to
adhere to precedents established during Watergate,
and the leadership is expected to meet again on Friday
to hash out those issues.
