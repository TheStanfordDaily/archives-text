## Editorial The 						rankings paradox 
### 
University acts thoughtfully
in addresssing difficult
problem with human nature

WE APPLAUD THE University's
decision to post independently
audited statistics on the World
Wide Web for prospective students to read.
When it comes to choosing a college or grad
uate school, there's no such thing as being
too well informed.
The University is also on the right side of
its dispute with U.S. News & World Report
over that magazine's misguided system of
ranking colleges according to a formula. But
while the University is doing the right thing
and on the right side, U.S. News' rankings
represent a problem and a way of thinking
that will take more than a Web site to over
come.
U.S. News has responded to attacks from
universities across the country by suggesting
that academia resents outside scrutiny and
that the magazine is providing an important
service as an independent observer.
While one might easily reply that inde
pendence isn't the same as accuracy, it does
put the University in the awkward position
of fighting the highest-profile outside publi
cation to evaluate the college choice process.
If universities want people to get their
information from university sources rather
than outside reports, they have to be scrupu
lous in presenting the information. They
have to convince parents and students that
they are not advertising their university, but
aiding parents and students in making an
informed choice. There is a real and tangible
line at which people stop believing informa
tion because they think it's a sales pitch.

Stanford's current Web site is clearly on
the right side of that line, but what would
make the most impact would be a greater
degree of cooperation between universities
on publishing this information. If universi
tied would join in a national effort, then it
would be much less tempting to think that
the information was a self-interested piece of
advertising by any one institution.
Stanford's previous attempts to gather
nationwide support proved lukewarm. It is
hard to imagine how any university could
honestly say it thought the U.S. News rank
ings system to be a meaningful aid to college
selection, and we can only conclude that
many of them are unwilling to get into a fight
with the powerful magazine.
This reticence makes Stanford's current
stand somewhat remarkable, but it is easy to
see the source of the hesitancy. People don't
only read U.S. News rankings because they
are an independent source of quantitative
information. A lot of people also like to have
the easy answer that a sequential rankings
system purports to provide.
Choosing a college is a very complex
decision for students and their parents to
make. The U.S. News rankings are evidently
terribly oversimplified, and move up and
down from one year to the next in a way that
suggests that they are fairly far from describ
ing reality.
For all that, there are always going to be
people who think that everything in this
world can be ranked on a nice easy list. U.S.
News caters to such people in a fairly abject
fashion, but it's the mentality of those who
take it seriously that's the thorniest problem.
We're glad that problem isn't one we
have to deal with every day. University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper does, and we can only
commend the way he has gone about dealing
with it.
