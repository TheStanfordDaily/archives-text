THE SAD realiza
tion came to me
last spring break. I
arrived at Boston College
to see my friend Tommy
early on a Wednesday
evening. After dinner I
asked him, "It's Wednes-

day night, is there going to be anything
going on around campus?" His normally
pink face turned a darker shade of red,
and suddenly a high school football coach
had crawled inside him. He grabbed both
sides of my shoulders, shook me twice,
and shouted loudly, "It's WEDNESDAY
NIGHT."
I knew then I was a Stanford student.
Wednesday night to me meant CIV sec
tion 'til 8:30 p.m., checking mail on the
way back to my dormitory, and reading
Kant, or maybe Nietzche for fun. And my
Sundays though Thursdays sounded a lot
like that too. Of course, there were also
those frequent Saturdays when I was "too
tired to go out" after a week of Kant and a
night of being the 1,432 nd lucky under
grad that a given fraternity house elected
to offer free beer.
Stanford's an enlightening, intellectual
ly exciting place, but certainly nothing to

shout about. A recent ranking placed
Stanford in the bottom 10 among this
nation's universities in partying, putting us
in the same ranks (perhaps literally) with
those fun-loving lads at The Citadel.
What to do about nothing?
Gone are the days of 24 housed frater
nities on campus. I don't think those days
are coming back any time before skyrock
eting insurance premiums plummet, which
will probably happen around the same
weekend every housed fraternity agrees to
go so dry that borrowing someone's
mouthwash warrants probation.
And I wouldn't be surprised if the few
fraternities left on campus begin to take a
slightly more cynical look at the parties
they throw, which involve them letting me
into their homes, offering me free bever
ages and a free place to meet my friends,
and cleaning up after me.
If parties are becoming obsolete, what
can Stanford do to lift itself from the Fri
day night blues?
The answer is simple: bars on campus.
The benefits of bars
Bars, for starters, prepare students for
the complex world that lies ahead. When

grownups socialize, you rarely hear one
say, "Hey, Tracy, I'll see you after work at
the Sigma Delt house." The world is a
public place, and in order to get ahead in
it, one needs to know how to act in a social
setting.
Pubs, as evinced by the etymology of
the word, teach one these skills. If Roger,
after sharing a pony keg with two pals at a
fraternity house, decides to do his best
Neil Diamond impersonation, his embar
rassment can only be shared by the few
people around him. But if Roger is to act
this way in a bar, then he has just shown
the world how "talented" he is.
Bars foster conversation, something
that is hard to come by at a party with con
stantly blaring Madonna and Backstreet
Boys. Conversation fosters community.
Bars, lastly, tolerate diversity. Stanford
prides itself on listening to the concerns of
each individual student. Walk into a bar,
and you can always find one person willing
to listen to anyone's problems. He's called
the bartender, and he's a lot cheaper than
old Uncle Leland.
