Res Comp misinforms,
overcharges students
For two years, I lived quite happily
with my free localtalk connection in Rains
Houses, and I extolled the virtues of Stan
ford networking to current and prospec
tive students. I even bragged about it to
my friends at other schools.
I could surf the Internet at will, without
cost, and without tying up a phone line.
Maybe I came to take it for granted, but at
an institution where round-the-clock net
work access is virtually a necessity, 1 think
1 should be able to take it for granted.
Then suddenly, about a month ago, a
sign appeared on my mailroom door:
"Localtalk will be discontinued through
out Rains this week. Contact your RCC to
activate ethernet connections."
No reasons were given, much less any
advance notice. I had to buy $100 of new
equipment in less than a day. Even though
my computer has an ethernet card, the
Rains network is so outdated that I had to
buy a different card.
I was angry, but I went along with it.
What choice did 1 have? Modem access
isn't allowed from most residences. So to

activate my jack, I signed an online form
stating that I would receive network
access in exchange for a one-time $45 con
nection fee. A few days later the connec
tion was up.
Imagine my surprise when I received
an e-mail message today stating that Res
idential Computing had made a "mistake"
and the information on that web page was
"wrong." I will actually be billed $80
annually.
Not only is this a clear violation of the
online contract I signed, but the complete
lack of advance notification is absolutely
unforgivable. I am told that Res Comp
asked the provost for this money last year
and was denied. Why weren't we
informed then?
More importantly, why the increase in
the first place? Has the financial need for
"infrastructure support" really more than
doubled in the past year? Even if it has,
why not bury the cost in that absurdly high
rent increase? At least Res Comp would
look less incompetent then. Chances are,
no one would even notice, and we would
go on praising Stanford's network facili
ties.
