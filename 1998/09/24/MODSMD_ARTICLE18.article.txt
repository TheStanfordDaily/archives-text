stifled opposing offenses, limiting them to just six goals
and 19 points.

Steve Swanson's tenure. During his first year on the Farm,
the team went 3-3 and it improved last year to 4-2 after six
games.

A&M and has two scores on the season.
In addition to Adamson. the team has relied a great
deal on Smolak. Keeping her goals-against average to .94.

Jose State's four goals on the season, Schindler is assisted
by Megan Nelson, who leads the Spartans with only two
