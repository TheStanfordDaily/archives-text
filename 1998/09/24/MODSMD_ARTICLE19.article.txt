## Gil Lopez Witnessing the tackle of a lifetime 
### 
It was just a routine tackle.
North Carolina's Rufus Brown
was brought down at the Tar Heel
33-yard line after returning a kickoff
15 yards. Not exactly a highlight-reel
clip for a game that featured a touch
down on a kick return and a game
winning field goal as time expired.
But it was a moment that Charley
Dean can treasure forever.
The redshirt sophomore walk-on
was making his collegiate debut, and
he made the play.

"You come out here every day
and you finally have them give you
the nod, it's unbelievable," Dean
said. "Even before high school you
get up every Saturday and you see
college football on TV, and to finally
be in it is a dream come true."
Dean didn't have to do it this way.
His father Rich was on scholarship as
a safety at Northwestern. Charley
could have had a full ride at schools
such as Purdue and Wisconsin.
He could have had the great foot
ball program somewhere else. A free
top-notch education was also at his
fingertips.
But Dean's love of the game
made him decide to follow a different
path. His uncle Randy also played for
the Wildcats, but he was only a walk
on quarterback.
Randy Dean went on to a four
year career in the NFL with the New
York Giants and Green Bay Packers.
"I figured if things went even 10
percent as well for me, I'd be OK,"
Charley Dean said.
It also serves as strong motivation
for all those days when he had no
choice but to watch from the side
lines.
"When you look at football, every
career has its ups and downs, its
peaks and valleys," Dean said. His
college career is a perfect example.
The Mequon. Wis., native was re
cruited by the Cardinal as a running
back and was switched to the defen
sive secondary before last season.
This year he's a wide receiver.
But Dean doesn't let the cir
cuitous route he has taken faze him.
"Having my dad play in college
constantly reinforces that in me," he
said "When you're at the lowest
point in your career, nothing can get
worse, you can only go up from
there."

Of course, it wasn't a completely
blind decision on his part. I'he Cardi
nal coaching staff did everything it
could to convince him to pass up a
scholarship somewhere else and join
Stanford.
[Head coach Tyrone Willingham]
"sat me down in his office and told
me everything straightforward." he
said. "And having someone like him,
someone who also walked on. it's
everything you could want in a coach.
It just shows you that when you pay
the price you can make it in the end."
And things have been paying off
in many ways. At most other schools,
walk-on athletes are the second-class
citizens of the field. They're relegat
ed to different locker rooms. Team
meetings don't always include them.
Most are happy just to have a coach
remember their names.
Not at Stanford.
"Here you definitely feel includ
ed," Dean said. "You're not treated
differently. You're in the same lock
er room, you get your own number,
you get to eat at the training room
table. You're not divided by scholar
ship versus walk-on, and that's the
way it should be."
His teammates "have been be
hind me from day one. with the nick
names and the jokes." he said. "I
could hear them on the sidelines with
the 'Go two-eight' and the 'Chuck
Bones.'"
And he came through. He admits
to being rusty on his first play, but he
wasn't about to let this chance pass
him up.
On the kickoff. his second play of
the game, he was knocked down by a
blocker, but got back up and stopped
Brown.
"I was jumping off the field, giving
teammates high-fives." he said. "It
was nice to finally be able to con
tribute to the team after everything
they've given me, a trip to the Sun
Bowl, two straight wins over Cal."
He could have had things easier.
He could have had the full ride at an
other school. But the easy road
doesn't seem to fit Dean. 1 le's more
than comfortable having to prove
himself.
With the taste of playing time
fresh on his lips, he'll walk into Arril
laga tonight after practice and check
the travel roster for tomorrow's trip
to Oregon. Whether or not his name
is on it.he won't give up. He'll still go
out to practice and work his hardest.
He'll cheer his teammates on and
he'll know they'll always do the same
for him.
He had a couple of plays in one
game. That's not enough to make
him complacent. He's proven that
much after two years on the side
line.
