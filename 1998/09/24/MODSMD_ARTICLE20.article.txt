# Sweet and Sauer
## Senior captain unites team 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
One minute A.J. Sauer was on
his way to Sail Francisco with his
friends lor a night out. The next
minute he was thrown out the hack
window of a Ford Explorer, land
ing in the middle of U.S. Highway
101.
It wasn't the physical pain of the
muscle strains. It wasn't the pain
in-the-neck of being bed ridden for
a week, nor was it the inability to
run for two and a half months that
bothered Sauer the most.
The hardest part for Sauer was
the prospect of not being ready for
this season — his senior year and
last hurrah as a collegiate soccer
player.
"I knew I'd be OK eventually,
but it could have been halfway
through the season," he said. "I

didn't know and that was the scari
est part."
With head coach Bobby Clark
constantly stressing the impor
tance of fitness and conditioning,
missing the first month of the sum
mer preseason training could have
been a disaster for Sauer.
And not having Sauer might
have been a disaster for the team.
His recovery has been success
ful. however, and the captain has
already scored a team-leading
three goals and eight points this
season. ()ne of the three goals was
the game-winner against Harvard
in overtime. In fact, Sauer has a
knack for scoring goals when they
count most. I le has had at least
three game-winning goals every
season at Stanford.
"A.J. would have been a good
gunfighter at the O.K. Corral. He
is so good with the pressure on,"

Clark stated about his forward.
Scoring goals, however, has
only been Sauer's specialty while
playing at Stanford. Throughout
his pre-college life in Houston,
Texas, Sauer was actually trained
as a defensive-minded center mid
fielder.
Sauer began playing soccer
when he was five and loved the
sport from day one. He views the
defining moment in his soccer ca
reer as when he made the U.S. Na
tional Under-17 team as a fresh
man in high school.
Making the national team "is
what I set my goals on. I did every
thing possible even though I was
only on the team for a short bit of
time," he said.
Sauer remained on the team for
about six months and took a trip to
France with the team. Though he
came off the bench and had a lim
ited role, he describes the interna
tional exposure as eye-opening.
After his stint with the national
team, Sauer competed on the na
tional champion South Puma club
team in Texas as a midfielder.
At Stanford, he was converted
to a forward and has adapted to
this role magnificently — he was
the team's leading scorer last sea
son.
Along with this change of posi
tions, the entire Cardinal soccer
program has changed in front of
Sauer's eyes. The year he was re
cruited, the team went 5-12-2. It
was obviously not the strength of
the program that drew him to Stan
ford.
"I knew that through soccer I
would have access to going to a
place like Stanford," he said. "My
first priority was academics and
that is what my final decision was
based on. not the strength of the
soccer program."
But Sauer is happy with the
choice, especially after the im
provement of the program.
"It is a 180-degree turn from my
freshman year," Sauer said. "Soc
cer was a priority, but it wasn't a

soccer focused team. It was more
socially oriented. No one wanted
to give up the commitments to
make the team good. The sad part
was that we were a collection of
good players, but we had no team
dynamics or leadership."'
Things have changed drastically
since then.
Sauer now provides the leader
ship that was once missing with this
team.
"He has the trust and confi
dence of the players and the staff,"
Clark said. "He is a good leader.
He is tactful but not afraid to state
his opinions. Everyone has a lot of
faith in him."
As opposed to the Cardinal
team of the past, the squad that
Sauer leads has incredible chem
istry.
"Not only is this team the best
athletically, but it is also the best
group of guys," Sauer said.
This group includes eight se
niors. all of whom play a leader
ship role both on and off the field.
With such a large senior class,
Sauer feels the hardest part of the
season will be staying patient as
many of the players know this will
be their last chance as soccer play
ers. This emotion is much harder
to deal with off the field, but Sauer
knows the consequence of letting it
effect the play of the team.
"There is almost a sense of ur
gency," Sauer said. "On the field
we play with patience, but it comes
out off the field. Our Achilles heel
will be ourselves. We can not let
the urgency overcome us."
This urgency is felt because the
team has high hopes and goals for
the postseason. Hut it is also felt
because Sauer doesn't want his ex
perience as a Stanford soccer play
er to end.
"The camaraderie is the best
part. We have gotten closer and
closer every year. This is the best
group of guys and I'd like to end
[my soccer career] this way.
"I am doing everything I can to
make this the best year."
