Although a day of classes has already come and
gone, some ( ardinal I'ans may feel as if the year h;is
to officially begin. The fierce rivalry that possesses
students to paint their bodies, color their hair and
tear down an occasional goalpost is not yet upon us.

FIELD HOCKEY

■ Saturday: Stanford vs. C alifornia. New Astroturf
Field. I p.m.

Until now.
In the academic year's first head-to-head match
between Stanford and arch-rival school California,
Stanford's women's field hockey team will make its
bid to get this year's series with the Bears off to a
good start on Saturday..
After upsetting No. 18 Northwestern last week,
Stanford was able to enjoy the annual Alumni
(lame on Saturday. Leading the team in points,
Monique Lcroux was relieved to have an after
noon to relax.
"Alter having such a long road trip [including]

six huge games in less than two weeks ... it's phys
icallv and mentally very tough," she said.
Leroux was glad to share the afternoon with for
mer Cardinal players rather than conference oppo
nents.
"We have a pretty strong alumni connection."
Leroux said. "A lot of them come to our games and
cheer us on."
Now as classes begin and papers, problem sets
and midterms loom frighteningly near, the Cardi-
nal must maintain its focus to meet
the challenge of the rest of the home
stand.
The start of classes "alters daily
routine," said head coach Sheryl
Johnson.
"Instead of just going to practice
and just going to meals they have to
start concentrating on their classes."
The beginning of academic work,
however, doesn't just mean a busier
schedule for the field hockey team.
With this weekend's game against
Cal rapidly approaching, Leroux is
glad that Stanford's students will re
turn to campus just in time to attend
field hockey's own Big Game on as
tro! urf.
The Hears, who also defeated
Northwestern last week, will be trav
eling across the Bay tomorrow to
meet the ('ardinal.
"I'm looking forward to it," Ler
oux said. " This is the game that we
usually get the biggest crowd. It's just
such a great game because there's so
much energy."
II tradition is any indication, the

crowd that assembles at the new Var
sity Hockey Astroturf Field at Ipm
on Saturday will not be disappointed.
Last year, Cal and Stanford were
lixked in a season-long duel that in
cluded several tight games and one
last minute finish.
In regular season play, the Cardi
nal and Bears split the two games.
Stanford shut out Cal. 2-0, in the first
match and then lost a month later at
home, 1-0.
The two teams then faced each
other again in the Northern Pacific
Conference championship at the
conlcusion of the season.
With less than seven minutes re
maining. Stanford's Mallory Cham
bers broke a scoreless tie with the
eventual winning goal, ending anoth
er close match between Cal and Stan
ford.
This year the game holds even
greater importance as the NorPac
( onferenee hasexpanded its number
of teams, increasing the challenge for
Stanford to retain its conference
crown.
If the proverb "past is prologue"
holds true, the game on Saturday is
bound to be a hard-fought match
with a down-to-the-wire finish.
