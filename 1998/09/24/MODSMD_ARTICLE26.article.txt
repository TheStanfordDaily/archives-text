A Stanford tradition

Unless you're still hung over from running with the Band, you've
heard about a cappella here on the Farm. A lot.
And rightly so: Stanford's a cappella nation consists of eight groups
who have been singing their hearts out for you this past week, entreat
ing you to become the newest members of a Stanford tradition. But this
isn't your high school choir — this is a tradition with attitude.
It all started back in 1963, when a group of manly men decided to
woo their sweethearts with the human voice. The resulting all-male
sound was that of the Mendicants, whose arrival not only signified the
beginning of the a cappella tradition on the Farm, but also declared in
harmonious defiance that there is indeed dating at Stanford.
Counterpoint, Stanford's all-female group, followed the Mendicants by
forming in 1979. Sue other groups followed suit in the next 20 years.
But why all the fuss about a cappella? What does it mean to you?
Why should you get involved?
"A cappella is a really strong part of the Stanford community," said
Mendicant director Tom Chi, a junior majoring in human biology.
Other group members strongly agree. Mixed Company's director
Christine Chang, a senior in Mechanical Engineering, feels that a cap
pella "is a way of life ... it's more than just a cool extra-curricular
thing, because you are made to feel very important." For guys at Fleet
Street, being in an a cappella group is like belonging to a fraternity.
And Enoch Chen, a member of Testimony, Stanford's Christian a
cappella group, believes that "there is a lot of group fellowship out
side of singing."
The appeal of a cappella for these singers varies, but there are com
mon themes of togetherness, fun and accomplishment. And rest
assured, there have been some major accomplishments.
This past summer the world famous Irish folk music ensemble, The
Chieftains, asked Talisman to sing backup for their tour. Recently,
world champion figure skater Rudy Galindo heard Fleet Street's
album "What You Want" and decided to use their version of "Ave
Maria" for his short program.
From touring with groups from other schools to performing at the
White House, Stanford a cappella has a very strong presence in
national a cappella circles. All goups have achievments to be proud of,
thanks to institutions like Contemporary A Cappella Society of
America and Best of Collegiate Cappella.

Those of us who can't hold a tune enjoy listening to the sounds that
flood our dormitories, dining halls and the outside air. But for the
ones with a little talent and some gumption, tryouts are September 23
and 24, with callbacks this Friday.
But despite the allure of wonderful music and group camaraderie,
hearing these groups sing around campus is enough to intimidate any
prospective star.
The truth of the matter, however, is that a cappella can be learned.
Most singers have had varied exposures to music in high school, from
accomplished musicians and singers to the secretive, car-and-shower
variety.
And auditions? Even the musically challenged need not fear. Yaov
Schlesinger, an undeclared sohpomore with Talisman, says that although
his tryout experiences with four groups were "nerve-wracking, they
weren't hard. I wanted to do well and so 1 was obviously nervous, but the
groups made it totally cool — they were clapping and yelling like crazy
when you came into the room. They were all really supportive."
Support for a cappella at Stanford transcends group boundaries.
Admittedly, they are all vying for the same thing — an audience.
However, with so many different styles and attitudes — from Everday
People's R&B funk to Fleet Street's comedy and stylistic diversity to
Counterpoint's '80s and '90s pop — Andy Lee, the Mendicants' finan
cial manager, believes that every group has its own niche.
While many a cappella friendships cut across group lines, tension
may exist between ensembles. This tension has been alleviated some
what by holding joint concerts. It's music for music's sake.
Of course, the world of a cappella is not embraced equally by every
one on campus. Last year's Gaieties featured an "A Cappella Box" that
imprisoned students, suggesting the boredom and tediousness of inter
minable a cappella. Stanford is also the birthplace of the term "a cap
pella'ed out" from students who have been told just one too many times
to audition, or who have heard too many dorm performances. But with
eight groups on campus striving for attention, it's not hard to see why
one can feel overwhelmed by announcements and singing.
If you've decided that a cappella is for you, then the best thing to do
is to try out. It won't hurt you, and heck, it might build character.
Deep down we're all singers. As "The Little Mermaid" proved, your
voice is powerful and special.
As for myself, my voice is weak and needs tuning — but I've been a
closet singer for most of my life, and today I've decided to sign up for
tryouts. See you there.
