It's that time again. Not only is this the season to stand in long lines to pay
your exorbitant University bill, connect your phone and turn on the cable, it is
also time to be introduced to or reacquainted with Stanford's a cappella
groups. Orientation weekend is a chance tor everyone from Testimony to
Talisman to showcase their material, promote their music and recruit new
members.
As I walked through the melee ol new and old student bodies and bicycles
in White Pla/a last weekend, I heard all the a cappella music from the different
groups. The sounds blended and blurred together above their tables, but as I
drew closer to each table, the separate words and sounds became more distinct.
I recently talked to members of Counterpoint and Everyday People in depth
about their group's history, recent group events and their personal experiences
in a cappella. They are just two of the many groups at Stanford that bring song
to life in unique ways.
