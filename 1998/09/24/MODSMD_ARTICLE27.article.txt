It's that time again. Not only is this the season to stand in long lines to pay
your exorbitant University bill, connect your phone and turn on the cable, it is
also time to be introduced to or reacquainted with Stanford's a cappella
groups. Orientation weekend is a chance tor everyone from Testimony to
Talisman to showcase their material, promote their music and recruit new
members.
As I walked through the melee ol new and old student bodies and bicycles
in White Pla/a last weekend, I heard all the a cappella music from the different
groups. The sounds blended and blurred together above their tables, but as I
drew closer to each table, the separate words and sounds became more distinct.
I recently talked to members of Counterpoint and Everyday People in depth
about their group's history, recent group events and their personal experiences
in a cappella. They are just two of the many groups at Stanford that bring song
to life in unique ways.

Counterpoint is Stafford's second
oldest a cappella TJiev we^v
formed in 1979 as a sister group cwt&i
terpoint to the Stanford's oldest and
male a cappella group, the
(hence the name). Group hiember
Tamara laron enjoys "the different
dynamic" that comes with being in an
all-female group; she finds it "easier to
talk and bond as a group." laron said,
"There's a special chemistry when that
happens and it really shows on stage. We
all have fun."
Counterpoint produces an album
every other year and tours during the oil
years. "Counterculture" was produced in
the summer of '98; it is the group's third
CI) and fifth album. Their previous
album, "Nomansland," was nominated
for Best Female Collegiate Album by The .
Contemporary A Cappella Society of
America. The song "Berkeley School
Dropout," originally written five years
ago to compete against Berkeley's a cap

pella groups irtPtg Sing (the a cappella .
version of Big Game), will be featured on ij
the forthcoming "Best of College A I
Cappella (BOCA)"album.
Counterpoint's financial manager,
Xinru Woo, says all types of students are
welcome to audition, including males.
The group is a mixture of many different
personalities and voices. No prior musi- |
cal background is required, and prospect
tive members should expect a commit-J
men I' tfj three rehearsals a week, each
lastiita two to three hours, and one dorm i

show each Wednesday * night.
Performances at holiday shows, craft
fairs and amusement parks are also part
of Counterpoint's schedule.
Counterpoint's membership lluctuJjS|
ates'between 13 to 17 students. larofHl
said, "We will lake as many people asAtfeli
k think would add to the group dynaifflf«&
We are not looking merely to fill spots.^^
Counterpoint looks for members
whose voices will blend well with, the
group's,, who have "an appreciation for
great music" and who would "add to the
group dynamic and enhance the group."
Woo says, "Kach group is almost a fami
ly in a way; that's what makes it tun." As
she made this remark, a Mendicant ran
from his table, covered her eyes, then
winked and swiped her sunglasses from
her head as he made a laughing getaway.
Everyday People
This is the second year Nick Grossman
will sing with Fveryday People, an a cap
pella group which gets its name from the
same-titled song by 70s group Sly and
The l amilv Stone. It was "luck of the

to do it, until Ire saw the group "
dfHfanwr.nind at MuFuUnSun.
wfßWian said he "liked their style"
and thoujjit tliey looked "chill, laid-back
and cool/'Nfick liked the music they sang
a heat and a rhythm
winch rna<i|' him want to dance and
4< Now now he is a co
dircctof Iff the group.
liMiv People has been on campus
sin* i9|t7, when two male students
* bring the music they grew up
Stanford campus to add to the
mif)rawtliti(»nal sounds of Stanford a
| hat music not only consisted
of OTmHftporary blues, jazz and UBcß
Isa^ficluded '60s Motown and '70s
said that the group has
PTCjftth' strayed into modern R&B but
yam flie group's focus has always been
have fun singing," and not on any
particular musical style.
The group performs music that spans
decades and cultures, singing songs from
contemporary artists such as Mariah
Carey, Janet Jackson, Hoys II Men and
Brandy as well as older performers such
as Ciladvs Knight and The Pips, Aretha
Franklin, Farth Wind and Fire and The
Jackson Five.
Fveryday People just returned from a
great (Hub Med vacation in Mexico
where they were guest performers. In
recent years, the group has also toured
the l ast Coast and competed in the
National Competition of Collegiate A
Cappella. Fast year they made it to the
semifinals.
Aside from paid gigs, Fveryday People
performs at various benefits. The group

formed to bring a cappclln music to
inner-city high schools whose music
budgets have been cut or that cannot
afford music programs. Through this
program, they have performed in high
schools in Oakland, and in San
Francisco's Mission District.
No particular musical background is
necessary to audition for the group.
Grossman says you need 011 ft "have a
feel for the music and be able to get into
it." He enjoys the privilege of singing
with other students who encourage
group singing as well as solos.
"One ol the best parts is that everyone
gets a chance to show their skills. There's
a lot ot freedom to improvise and do
solos, or if you just want to wig out and "
go nuts on a run, you're free to. There's a -
lot ot melodic improvisation, 1
Grossman said.
Grossman believes that perhaps the
greatest thing about singing in an a cap
pella group is the joining of voices. He
said, "It's one thing to sing alone, but it's
amazing to sing with a group. The sound
you make is beautiful. It's the glow that
comes when everything comes together
and everything works."
These tire only llie perspectives of two
groups on campus. The rest of the groups
also hove unique idenitites ami histories.
Stanford is one of the few universities on
the West Coast with a long and glorious
history of student a cappella, and now it is
time for you to write your own chapter in
that history.
