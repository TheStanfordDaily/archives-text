An entertaining Chan / Tucker flick

An action-adventure / comedy,
"Rush Hour" comes at an odd
time of the year. Too late to
cash in on summer crowds, it
» arrives at the same time as
dramas like "One True Thing" and
"Rounders." This is too bad, though,
because if there's one thing this movie is,
it's a crowd-pleaser.
Starring legendary Hong Kong martial
arts icon Jackie Chan and comedian Chris
Tucker, who is fresh from his over-the-top
performance in"The Fifth Element,"
"Rush Hour" opens at the end of Britain's
reign over Hong Kong. The last traces of a
menacing crime syndicate have been
eradicated, and Consol Han (Tzi Ma)
looks toward his new role in America.
However, the leader of the gang, the elu
sive Juntao, and his cronies are still on the
loose. They kidnap Han's daughter to
achieve their ends. Han's personal detective,
Inspector Lee (Chan), is called to investi
gate. The FBI doesn't want Lee's trouble
making partner from the Los Angeles Police
Department, James Carter (Tucker), called
in to distract Lee. Predictably enough,
though, after some initial distractions, they
end up investigating together.
But the plot isn't the important part
here. The choreography of the fights, the
timing of the jokes, and the sheer specta
cle of it all are what make this film so

enjoyable. Chan and Tucker have a
comic chemistry which is put to bril
liant use. Early in the film, each of
them is vying for control over the
other. In one scene, while Tucker, a
"real FBI officer," poses for tourists,
Chan jumps from the top of an open
bus to a hanging street sign. In
another, each one tries to be the one
aiming a gun at the other, and this is
brought to an end by a nearby cabby
with a gun pointed at both of them.
Later, when the bad guys are about
to kill Tucker, he challenges one of
them to "fight like a man." One kicks
him, and, after realizing what hap
pened, he says, "Okay, now which
one of y'all kicked me?"
Chan is usually a serious foil to
Tucker's comedy, but he gets a few
good lines himself. His main purpose
is to amaze with acrobatics, and he
succeeds. Even Tucker gets into the
act by the end of the film.
Sure, it's a lot like "Lethal Weapon,"
"Beverly Hills Cop" and many other
movies, but so what? They didn't have
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. I don't
usually like action-adventure films and
I don't usually laugh much at come
dies, but I did both at this movie. That's
the highest compliment 1 can give it.
