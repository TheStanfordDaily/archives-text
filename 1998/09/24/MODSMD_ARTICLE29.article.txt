# All's not fair in poetry and 'War'
## 
### 
A lot of mov-'i.;' about artists
buy into the romantic vision
of the hero. A creative per
son, the cliche goes, must
- suffer alone in order to
produce great art. "A Merry War" shows
a decidedly different side of the artistic
life. This portrayal of a frustrated
English writer sabotages its poet-hero
with satire, making it a thoroughly
enjoyable, darkly humorous look at
writing, publishing and earning a living.
Based on an early novel by George
Orwell, "A Merry War" debunks the
romantic image of the writer by setting
him in the worst of circumstances a free
spirit could endure: an advertising
agency in middle-class, 1930s Britain.
Gordon Comstock (Richard E. Grant)
is set to become the firm's best-paid ad
writer. But he dreams of being a great
poet. Buoyed by a favorable review,
Comstock quits his job to pursue poet

ry full-time. Comstock soon discovers
the hard reality of what his boss, his
publisher and his girlfriend Rosemary
(Helena Bonham Carter) have told him
before: Poetry doesn't pay.
Without cash or a reputation,
Comstock tries in vain to find solace in
writing. He repeats bloodless lines
about poplar trees in the midst of
London's gray streets. Obsessed with his
own image of what a poet should be —
Blake, Wordsworth and Byron come to
mind — Comstock is unable to find
inspiration in his reality. Meanwhile, his
dream world begins to separate him
from those he loves, especially the long
suffering Rosemary.
Comstock's actions betray the fact his
true love is not poetry itself, but the fame
and money he thinks literary success will
bring. He longs to abandon the confor
mity of middle-class life and enter into
London's high-living, upper-class haunts.

But they make an eloquent battle of satire

"A Merry War" might seem cynical if
it weren't for the brilliant emotional
depth of Grant's performance as
Comstock. It is difficult to like him, yet
impossible to hate him. Director Robert
Bierman and screenwriter Alan Plater
have managed to make Comstock
pathetic, endearing and funny at the
same time, and Grant's energy carries it
all off splendidly. When finally faced
with reality, Comstock's response is con
sistent with the movie's witty tone.
Filled with sly commentary on class
consciousness, literature and wealth,
and crafted with marvelous acting and
elegant set design, this movie should
appeal to those with a taste for satire
and anyone who has ever aspired to be
a full-time writer. Be prepared, howev
er, to feel occasionally as frustrated as
the poet himself.
