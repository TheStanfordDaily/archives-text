## SCBN serves up drama 'Straight' 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Anyone who claims that televi
sion onlv rots the mind hasn't met
Robert Wimlom and Jonathan
Hobb. two Stanford students who
have used their hours of television
watching to spai k their creativity.
Windom. a coterminal student
in sociology. and Hobb. a senior
majoring in economics, have writ
ten a television show which will
soon begin filming and be aired on
SCBN starting I his fall. The idea
for the show grew out of their dis
appointment with the portrayal of
students on television.
"We were watching Dawson's
Creek' and thought that we could
do a much better and more realis
tic show." Windom said.
"The idea got started in the
middle of last year." Hobb said.
"We had never seen anything like
this at Stanford before.. .we start
ed developing characters and cre
ating dialogue."
"Straight. No Chaser." which
Windom describes as a "light
hearted dramatic series." is a show
about college life. The show cen

ters on five main characters, two
girls and three guvs, living in a co
ed social house on a fictitious East
Coast campus. Although the show
is about college living, both Win
dom and Hobb asserted that the
show is not about life at Stanford.
"We're trying to keep it realis
tic." Windom said. "All the
episodes are scripted, but we're
trying to accurately portray the
lives of normal college students."
Much of the material in the
show was adapted from a movie
script that Windom had already
written entitled "Day of Fig." Win
dom. who has experience in cre
ative writing, and Hobb. who has
acting experience, worked togeth
er to create the show's dialogue.
"We really feed off each other."
Hobb said.
T he two hope to start filming in
early October, but are still looking
for actors and technical assistance
for the show. Windom and Hobb
emphasized that any level of acting
experience is fine.
"We really want to encourage
people to come out." Hobb said.
"We think that this is going to be
an intense and unique experience."
Although the pair know the
character types they're looking for.
Windom was reluctant to give away
any of the characters' personalities.
"We know where the show is
going, and we have it all planned
out." Windom said.
The two got the opportunity to
put their show on S( BN by pitching
the idea to the head of the network,
Katie I'ipson. As the only Stanford
made series airing this season,
"Straight, No Chaser" is a unique
project. But its novelty creates some
production and expense problems
funding is not readily available.
I Jsing SC BN equipment and film

ing on location will help cut down
some of the cost of producing the
show. Scenes from the social house
are tentatively slated to be shot in
Kappa Sigma, according to Windom.
In order to defray some of the
other expenses, Windom and Bobb
are hoping to get sponsorships from
area businesses. For example. The
Dutch Goose, a Menlo Park bar and
grill, can function as backdrop for a
college bar scene, Windom said.
They plan to produce 10 shows,
four to be aired this fall and six in
the winter. They then hope to rerun
the series as a whole during spring
quarter.
The pair had extensive experience
before undertaking the writing of the
series. Windom spent six months last
fall living and writing in Australia on
a Undergraduate Research Oppor

tunities grant. He received the grant
to write fiction about the aboriginal
people of Australia. In addition.
Windom has written oiher movie
scripts and short stories.
Bobb has had experience acting
in on-campus productions including
the Winter One Acts, and has writ
ten some dramatic works.
"I've had a great time with [the
project]," Bobb said. "It's opened
me up to experiences that I've never
had before."
As for the show's future
prospects, Windom and Bobb were
reluctant to predict the show's suc
cess. But they both conceded that
producing the show at a higher level
would be an amazing experience.
"It's going to be fun making it and
fun to watch, and that's our goal."
Windom said.
