'One True Thing' is an honest approach to filmmaking

£ 112 ne Irue Thing" is about mothers and daughters, death, and the after
f \ math of carrying on. Based on other films in this genre — "Steel
1 Magnolias" and "Terms of Endearment" come to mind — it would
\ J seem we'd need to prepare ourselves for what has now become a
S trusty filmmaking formula, albeit a well-made one, for tugging at

our vulnerable sentiments.
But Carl Franklin's film does not
slip into a sentimental shadow of
real events. Rather, it is a poignant
reflection on the simple fact of life
that death happens to people who
are important, and that it changes
us. That death happens and we
need to be strong is not the issue
here; that we are often forced to
make an understanding of it in so
short a time is.
Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellwegger),
an ambitious magazine journalist
who drinks instant coffee and Jolt for
dinner, holds her petite self up to the
big boys in the editorial world
through sheer will. Her mom, Kate
(Meryl Streep), is a homemaker. Kate
keeps the family running by throwing
"come as your favorite literary char
acter" surprise parties for her hus
band, George (William Hurt), a high
ly regarded English professor.

At ihe party, mom dresses as Dorothy, complete with ruby shoes, while dad does
the requisite turtleneck and tweed. Ellen, who has returned home for the party, is
truly festive, wearing hlack and remaining aloof and remote in the face of her
mother's domesticity.
Ellen idolizes her father and discusses her work with him. But she is put off when
her father asks her to give up her career and independence to move home, freelance
and take care of Kate, who has just been diagnosed with cancer. Instead of cooing
agreement, Ellen defends herself angrily, downright selfishly. "You have a Harvard edu
cation, but where's your heart?" George asks.
Guilt-tripped into cooperation, Ellen submits to a fate worse than death — becom
ing her mother. Crash courses in cooking and do-gooding for the community follow,
while George continues with teaching classes, seeing students and focusing his atten
tion on literary glitterati, in spite of Kate's rapid deterioration.
Ellen's fury builds with her father's seeming callousness, despite her mother's abili
ty to take it in stride. After missing her chance at freelancing a groundbreaking article
because of her home care duties, it becomes clear that somehow, after countless gripes
and cups of coffee, Ellen has grown a heart.
Zellwegger's and Streep's performances here are nothing short of fantastic. Ellen is
at times childish and whining in her dissent about the life she has been temporarily
forced to lead. But this only reminds us that, despite her voracious ambition, Ellen has
a lot to learn, whether she likes it or not. Streep, despite having played various charac
ters with just about every major debilitating disease in the book, brings calming
strength to a woman who has always been the invisible rock of her family.
"One True Thing," thankfully, is not a journey into the meaning of life. It is simply
a reminder that life is short, that we are loved and that we have a constant choice of
how to deal with both of those facts.
