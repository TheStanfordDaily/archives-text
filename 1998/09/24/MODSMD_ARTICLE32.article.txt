# 'Permanent' boredom
## 
### 
You're better off sleeping at 'Midnight'

I hoped for the intelligence and
wit of "Trainspotting." Instead,
I got "Permanent Midnight," a
boring and pointless exercise
about drug abuse which pre
tends to deliver gut-wrenching per
formances and complex messages.

I can't fault Ben Stiller for his
lack of acting ability — America saw how
funny he can be with the career-making
"There's Something About Mary." But here,
he has taken on the lead role in "Permanent
Midnight," a film where there is no redemp
tion, no transformation and, most impor
tantly, no clarity.
The audience must realize that the film,
which is actually a true-life story about
writer Jerry Stahl, is mostly told in flashback
format. Stiller plays the heroin-addicted
Stahl to the best of his ability, and quite often
we see Stiller play out some truly depressing
scenes with a bold face.
But first-time director David Veloz shows
his inexperience when he tries to generate
interest in the downfall of the '80's sitcom
writer. Veloz has commissioned a very pretty
face (Elizabeth Hurley) to play Jerry's then-lov
able and loyal wife, Sandra. Hurley's limited
acting ability is greatly strained in the more

sentimental and tense portions of "Permanent
Midnight."
Similarly, Veloz has trouble connecting the
past with the present. Stahl's current girl, Kitty
(Maria Bello), is more rebellious than Sandra,
but I did not pick up on Veloz's use of the
flashback technique until halfway into the
movie. I just figured Jerry was dating several
women at once, which further reinforces his
sleazy and corrupt behavior.
The funniest scenes come at the end when
several prominent faces on television today are
used to interview Stahl. I did not find myself
cheering for Stahl to escape his drudgery, since
he repeatedly screws up his drug rehab stints
and family responsibilities. The most mind
blowing scence of all occurs when he shoots up
heroin in front of his newborn baby.
Some of the audience, which was mostly
composed of Live-105 listeners, expressed great
amazement at the terrific acting and virtuoso
directing. I could not figure out what could be
so terrific about watching a person deteriorate
(think "Leaving Las Vegas" on illegal drugs)
and then have no real message come out of it.
Heroin is bad for you? I think we should all
know that by now.
