'Celebrity Skin'

Grunge rock's professional
widow is back. And the
question is not whether we
care, but whether she herself
still does.
Listening to Hole's new album,
"Celebrity Skin," is a perplexing experi
ence. Courtney Love's "Miss World"
grew up, went to Hollywood, lost her
I illusions in the land of "miles and miles
™ of perfect skin", and wants to tell us
E about it, but her story doesn't come
SpDgether. The feeling is simply not there.
® The most striking thing about
< "Celebrity Skin" is how diffuse and
I conventional the album sounds. The
B . r
album sorely lacks the immediacy of
| "Live Through This." It is more self-
I' involved, overproduced and under-
I realized. This time around, Love is
: more composed, her vocals are less
I hoarse, and she lets her band, espe
cially guitarist Eric Erlandson, play a
bigger role on the album. None of
this works as well as it should. The
songs blend together, and none leave
a lasting impression.
This is not to say that the new Hole
(album totally lacks merit. Courtney
Still knows how to put a song together;
her lyrics are as sharp as they were on
Hole's last album. But by ditching her
punk, riot-grrl influences she loses the
very elements that made "Live Through
This" such a powerful album — her
disarming sincerity and wit.

On "Celebrity Skin," it is hard to
emphathize with Courtney Love as we
did on "Live Through This." She is lost
in the layers of sonic noise, backup
singers and self-importance.
After becoming the pancake-make
up movie star, the kind of person she
used to parody viciously, Love still uses
her sizable smarts, but she employs
them masochistically. She tries to turn
her back on her Versace gowns, imply
ing that she's just been one of us all
along. She's been to Los Angeles and
come back to tell the tale, but in a sense
Love is a double agent, lost between her
two competing identities.
The unfortunate result of that ten
sion is that Courtney has become one
of the beautiful empty boys and girls
on the radio, "drunk on apathy/
burned right out" that she ruefully rep
rimands on "Celebrity Skin."
Hole's new album underwhelms, but it
is too easy to say that Hole sold out.
Courtney Love is still one of the most
accomplished songwriters on the pop
scene and, as the new album proves, she is
not afraid to move beyond her post
punk, post-feminist roots.
Perhaps the next time around (if
there is a next time), Hole and Love will
find a point of view which will allow
them to deploy the anger and sarcasm
that has earned them their reputation.
