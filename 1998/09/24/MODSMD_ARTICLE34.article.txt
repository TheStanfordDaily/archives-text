Eve 6'

Starting with its
name, derived from
an "X-Files' episode,
Eve 6 seems io enjo) stealing
ideas from other more successful enter

tainers in its quest for chart success. The single
"Inside Out" may be tearing up the playlists of
alternative stations, but even that song cannot
save this trio from becoming a forgettable one
hit wonder.

Max Collins, the band's lyricist and vocalist, derives great
pleasure from putting together rhyming couplets, no matter
how nonsensical or ridiculous they may be. For example,
"Leech," the band's second single, offers "You're the teacher;
I'm the student / Turning things around, your story's not
congruent." The sophomoric wording continues with "How
Much Longer," which features the line, "I'm exhausting yet
another topic I've exhausted." It's kind of clever on paper,
perhaps in a poem, but when you hear it on a CD, it just
sounds silly.
I suppose that stale and meaningless lyrics could be over
looked if there was an original backbeat or an intriguingly
unique lead vocalist blasting the notes. Unfortunately, F.ve 6
offers no such originality. The guitar riffs arc direct descen
dants of late-'9os bands like 31 l,and the Irish accent of lead
singer Max Collins reminds us of more popular singers like
Billy Joe of Creen Day. All in all, recycled goods make Lve 6's
new offering seem very old and monotonous.
