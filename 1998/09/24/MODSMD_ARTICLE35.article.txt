'No One is Really Beautiful'

I listen to dozens ol CDs every year. Some are
great, and some a. en'' Yet I cannot recall when
I've been as immediately captivated by an
album as I am with Jude's debut CD, "No One
is Really Beautiful." His voice and singing style
are lovely and fluid, his melodies and his instrumen
tation are blissful and his lyrics are pristine. These
wonderful elements coalesce into great songs. Albums
such as this give you faith in the record industry, faith
that labels really do try to get great artists, not just the
latest fad.
Jude is an East Coast transplant, currently residing in
Los Angeles, but his music is universal. Every song on the
album is a gem. There's "Brad and Suzy,"a meditation on
the temptation of generic coupledom. "Rick James" is a
funky song about the unoriginality of being a self-cen
tered jerk. There's also the aching "I Do," a remembrance
of love lost and trust betrayed, brought back to mind by
the receipt of a wedding invitation.
Acoustic guitars and drum loops permeate the
album, so it may be tempting to compare this album to
Beck, but Jude really sounds nothing like him. His music
is funky, but it is also beautiful and deep, recalling the
best of such disparate acoustic artists as Ani DiFranco,
James Taylor and Jewel.
However, comparing Jude to other musicians doesn't
do his music justice; you have to listen to him yourself.
And if you don't, you're missing out.
