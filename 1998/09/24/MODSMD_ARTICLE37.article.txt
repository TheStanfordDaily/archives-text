'Birdseye'

Smooth is the only way to describe The Tony Rich Project's
sophomore release, "Birdseye." With innovative, clever lyrics,
inspirational melodies and mellow beats featured in each
song, "Birdseye" is polished and thoughtful album that is a tes
tament to Rich's multiple talents and creative originality
"Birdseye" follows up on the hit single "Nobody Knows It But Me" from
the band's first album. Each song has the Suzanne Vega-esque ability to tell
a story. "Thoughts of Leavin' " tells the tale of a woman too in love too
leave a relationship gone bad, while "My Stomach Hurts" describes a
woman who leaves without ever looking back: "1 fade away in the night /
'Cause it hurts my mind works / To fight the demon in disguise / She fades
away in the night." "If You're an Angel" and "Bed" are two mellow guitar
laid ballads and "Cool Like That" shows off Rich's Babyface-like sound.
Rich's independent project continues the tradition of R&B artists
Maxwell and Erykah Badu, who are also heavily involved in the pro
duction of their own albums. As on "The Tony Rich Project," the band's
debut, the music and lyrics on this second album have all been pro
duced, written, arranged and performed by Rich. The result is an album
that bridges the gap between R&B and rock / pop by fusing them into
one. Smooth.
