'Dada'

Remember Dada? Sure
you do. It's the one
hit-wonder band who,
about six years
i» ago, came out with

the song "Dizz Knee Land."
(Sample lyric: "I just flipped off
President George / I'm going to
Disneyland.") Now the band is back

with a self-titled album, and while it's
changed a fair bit in six years, much has
stayed the same.

The big guitars and tuneful melodies are

still there, but now the band's influences are

more obvious. Country, '60's California sound, and

'80s arena rock all show up on this disc. Stand-outs include "Beautiful Turnback Time
Machine," a punk-meets-Beatles high school revisitation, and "Information Undertow," a Byrds
y, laid-back meditation on fame.
With these influences showing through so prominently, "Dada" sounds like an album Oasis
could have recorded. As with Oasis, the lyrics sound good but are not overly ponderous. And as
with Oasis, some people will love "Dada" and some will hate it. I fell somewhere in between.
While it was pleasant, the album is not an artistic statement. In fact, Dada, the artistic movement
of deliberate irrationality, is a rather ironic name for a band making music this unoriginal.
It's a good slow-dance album. It's a good make-out album. Heck, it'll be a good high school
memories album if it ever gets any airplay. It's good music. Enjoy.
