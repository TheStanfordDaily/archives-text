## Stanford trio tackles Social Security 
### Rebecca Rainof 
They met in a Stanford Introduc
tory Seminar, but they have gone a
long way since then.
This summer, Stanford students
Nikki Love. Connie Chen and
Matthew Wenger traveled to Wash
ington D.C. as Pacific region final
ists in the Social Security Challenge.
The Stanford group competed
against 150 other student groups.
Each team generated a plan to pro
mote discussion about Social Secu

rity among college students.
Americans Discuss Social Secu
rity. the program's sponsor, created
the contest because "the voice of
young people is very important to
this debate. It is the youth of Amer
ica who will live with the conse
quences of these discussion."
Seven finalist groups were cho
sen based on their t.(XX)-word es
says. which they entered last April.
The two students on the winning
team from Texas A&M each re
ceived a $ 10,(XX) scholarship. Amer
icans Discuss Social Security will
spend $1(X),(XM) to implement the
winning proposal from September
through December this year.
All finalists, including the Stan
ford team members, were also re
warded with $ 1 ,(XX). The nationwide
challenge was funded by the Pew
Charitable Trusts.
Love, Chen and Wenger met last
winter quarter in their Introductory
Seminar, "Lifetime Saving and So
cial Security Reform." The class was
taught by Economics Prof, and for
mer Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven, who encour
aged his students to enter the con
test. Soon after, the Stanford team
started on their task.

"The three of us met for many
late-night brainstorming and essay
writing sessions in our dorms or at
Tresidder," said Love.
The Stanford team created an in
teractive Web site, where a fictional
character, "Sam," serves as a living
time-line of Social Security history.
Their project challenges college stu
dents to "Save Social Security Sam"
by generating ideas for how to im
prove the Social Security system.
After being accepted as finalists,
Love, Chen and Wenger spent most
of July preparing to present their
proposal before a panel of judges in
Washington D.C.
"A former Chief Actuary of the
Social Security Administration was
really drilling us with questions —
tough questions about details of the
Social Security system," recounted
Love.
However, the group kept its
composure during the presentation

and fielded all questions posed to
them.
Though the competition is over,
members of the Stanford team have
not given up the challenge.
This weekend. Love will travel to
Atlanta for the Reform Party's na
tional convention. As the leader of
the Reform Party's Social Security
Issues Team, Love will propose new
Social Security platform planks.
In addition, Susan Rook, moder
ator for the competition and former
host of CNN's "Talk Back Live,"
urged the Stanford team to take
their proposal to another source of
funding to attempt to get it imple
mented.
After weeks of conference calls,
all-nighters, plane trips and high
pressure presentations, the Stanford
team most certainly met the Social
Security Challenge. Love said, "It
was wonderful, definitely stressful,
but it's quite a vivid memory."
