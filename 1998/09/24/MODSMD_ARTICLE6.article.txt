# Peace Corps sends grads far from Farm

For many Stanford students,
community service is a way of life.
But a dedicated few per year take
the spirit of volunteerism to the ul
timate level: the Peace Corps.
Over the last four decades, al
most 500 Stanford alumni have
joined the Peace Corps, working
and traveling in countries as di
verse as Bangladesh. Mozambique
and Gabon.
"The Peace Corps is definitely a
challenge," said Stephanie Lamp
ing, who just completed the mas
ter's program in engineering—
economic systems and operations
research, "but you get to experi
ence another culture and live it in
side out."
Lamping was a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Ghana from 1993 to
1995. In Africa, she taught math
and science at two secondary
schools. She also organized the
community in an effort to build a
laboratory for one of the schools.
Lan Mutehnick, an engineering
alumnus who now works for the
Stanford Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business, vol
unteered in Tanzania from 1993 to
1995.
"I didn't know that Tanzania
existed until I went," Mutehnick
said.
Mutchniek was a history major

at the University of Michigan, but
discovered that he was qualified to
teach math during his Peace Corps
recruitment process. He taught
different levels of math in Africa,
from basic skills to introductory
calculus.
"There is a huge need for Eng
lish. math and science teachers in
Africa and Asia." Mutchniek said.
"I wasn't used to the amount of re
spect and responsibility that I re
ceived there. People would treat
me as an honored guest and come
to me for advice. It was very sober
ing."
For some Peace Corps Volun
teers. the experience can be pow
erful enough to change a career.
When Erin Baker came back from
volunteering in Ghana, she was in
spired to attend graduate school.
Now she's a fourth-year doctoral
student in engineering-economic
systems and operations research.
"I'm interested in developing
countries," Baker said. "(The
Peace ('orps] changed my focus on
what to do in life."
Like Lamping and Mutclmick.
Baker taught math. She also start
ed a geography club. She and her
students painted a large map of the
world on one ot the boarding
school's walls.
"Some of them had never seen
maps before." Baker explained.
