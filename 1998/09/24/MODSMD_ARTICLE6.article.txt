# Peace Corps sends grads far from Farm

### Rito Treviño Senior staff writer 
For many Stanford students,
community service is a way of life.
But a dedicated few per year take
the spirit of volunteerism to the ul
timate level: the Peace Corps.
Over the last four decades, al
most 500 Stanford alumni have
joined the Peace Corps, working
and traveling in countries as di
verse as Bangladesh. Mozambique
and Gabon.
"The Peace Corps is definitely a
challenge," said Stephanie Lamp
ing, who just completed the mas
ter's program in engineering—
economic systems and operations
research, "but you get to experi
ence another culture and live it in
side out."
Lamping was a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Ghana from 1993 to
1995. In Africa, she taught math
and science at two secondary
schools. She also organized the
community in an effort to build a
laboratory for one of the schools.
Lan Mutehnick, an engineering
alumnus who now works for the
Stanford Medical School and the
Graduate School of Business, vol
unteered in Tanzania from 1993 to
1995.
"I didn't know that Tanzania
existed until I went," Mutehnick
said.
Mutchniek was a history major

at the University of Michigan, but
discovered that he was qualified to
teach math during his Peace Corps
recruitment process. He taught
different levels of math in Africa,
from basic skills to introductory
calculus.
"There is a huge need for Eng
lish. math and science teachers in
Africa and Asia." Mutchniek said.
"I wasn't used to the amount of re
spect and responsibility that I re
ceived there. People would treat
me as an honored guest and come
to me for advice. It was very sober
ing."
For some Peace Corps Volun
teers. the experience can be pow
erful enough to change a career.
When Erin Baker came back from
volunteering in Ghana, she was in
spired to attend graduate school.
Now she's a fourth-year doctoral
student in engineering-economic
systems and operations research.
"I'm interested in developing
countries," Baker said. "(The
Peace ('orps] changed my focus on
what to do in life."
Like Lamping and Mutclmick.
Baker taught math. She also start
ed a geography club. She and her
students painted a large map of the
world on one ot the boarding
school's walls.
"Some of them had never seen
maps before." Baker explained.

Ghana.
"One man asked me to point out
where Ghana was, and when I did,
he said, 'Oh! It's so small!'"
The teaching experience in
Africa was a challenge. Baker some
times taught while she and her stu
dents were dripping with sweat.
Mutchnick had to teach in
Swahili, which he learned in six
weeks through the Peace Corps.
Lamping was able to teach in Eng
lish. but she still had to change the
pace of her speech. She also discov
ered that some of her examples in
class weren't culturally appropriate
for her students.
"I taught math for a year at a ju
nior high school here in the U. 5.,"

Baker said, "and the experience was
completely different in Ghana. The
kids were definitely more motivated
[in Ghana]."
The volunteers quickly embraced
the cultures of their new homes.
Mutchnick found himself drawing
water from a spring and tending his
own chicken coop. During his travels
he did some drumming with East
African "cultural troops."
"(In Ghana] there's a very differ
ence pace of life. Their idea of enter
tainment is spending time visiting
with others," Lamping said.
Currently, 33 Stanford alumni
are serving in the Peace Corps. The
experiences go far beyond teaching
math and science; according to the
Peace Corps, Stanford grads have
contributed in the areas of health,
business, agriculture, engineering

and the environment. Mutchnick
commented that many volunteers
are advising businesses in the chang
ing economy of Europe.
"Stanford University graduates
traditionally are very competitive
Peace Corps candidates," said Har
ris Bostic, manager of the Peace
Corps recruiting office in San Fran
cisco. "Many students have shown a
commitment to service during their
years at Stanford and want to con
tinue that commitment to serve
now overseas."
For students who want to learn
more about the Peace Corps, there
will be an informational meeting at
7:(K) pm on Wednesday, Oct. 21 in
the Bechtel International Center.
Former Stanford volunteers and re
cruiters will be present to discuss ex
periences and opportunities.
