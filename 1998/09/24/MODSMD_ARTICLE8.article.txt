Mariann Byerwalter, Stanford
Chief Financial Officer and Class of
1982 alumna, received the Financial
Woman of the Year award last
week from the San Francisco Finan
cial Women's Association.
"I learned of [the award] in
July," Byerwalter said. "I was hon
ored, but also quite humbled â€”
there are many accomplished
women who could have been in my
place."
The award is given annually to a
woman in finance who is recognized
as a leader in her field, said Allison
Wertheim, a board member of the
association's San Francisco chapter.
The winner typically displays a
commitment to bettering her com
munity and helping women.
"The award is a broader recogni

tion for what women have done to
help themselves and others," Byer
walter said.
Until her most recent appoint
ment as CFO almost three years
ago, Byerwalter's tenure at Stan
ford involved a broad range of vol
unteer positions. As a senior at
Stanford in 1982, Byerwalter
served on the Council of Presi
dents. She joined the Board of
Trustees of the Stanford Alumni
Association in 1984 and went on to
become the chairman of the associ
ation's board.
After studying economics and
political science at Stanford, Byer
walter received her MBA at Har
vard University and worked in
mergers and acquisitions at the
Bank of America for several years.
One of her primary achieve
ments was co-founding the America
First financial corporation, which

engineered the recovery of a failed
bank, previously known as Eureka
Bank. After ten years, America
First recently sold Eureka to Bay
View Bank.
Byerwalter received the Finan
cial Woman of the Year award at a
September 16th luncheon attended
by more than 640 people. More
than $92,00() was raised at the lun
cheon for scholarships for women
studying finance, according to
Wertheim.
As CFO of Stanford, Byerwalter
oversees numerous offices, includ
ing Information Technology Sys
tems and Services, which deals with
campus computing, the Controller,
Human Resources, the Govern
ment Cost and Rate Studies Office,
Research Administration, Risk
Management, Internal Audit, Fi
nancial Planning and Business De
velopment.
