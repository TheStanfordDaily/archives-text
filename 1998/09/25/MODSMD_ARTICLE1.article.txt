## 
### Berra Yazar Staff writer 
The Lively Arts at Stanford has
initiated a ground-breaking half
price ticket campaign for Stanford
students. Discount tickets will be
available for all Lively Arts perfor
mances and may be purchased at
any time during the year.
In previous years, Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff received a
$3 discount off Lively Arts tickets.
Until this year, half-priced season
tickets were sold at the end of Sep
tember for a few days, limiting stu
dent access to the performances.
"We want everybody to get the
chance to come." said Suzanne
Field, Lively Arts marketing direc
tor. There is a limit of two half
price tickets per student, provided
the tickets aren't sold out. she
added. The campaign officially
started on Tuesday.
Interested students can go to
the Tresidder Union ticket office
in person with their own Stanford
ID to purchase discounted tickets.
Discounted tickets are also avail
able at the door.
Donations bv Peter and Helen

Bing were the driving force for the
shift in funding, according to Dean
of Students Marc Wais. The Office
of the President and the Office of
Student Affairs provided the rest
of the funding.
"I think this new change is a fan
tastic development that will pro
vide much greater access for Stan
ford students to the Lively Arts,"
Wais said. "Historically, students
found these prices very prohibi
tive."
On top of these discounts. Live
ly Arts offers students the oppor
tunity to buy five half-priced tick
ets to get a sixth ticket free for cer
tain performances. This is also sub
ject to seat availability and is limit
ed to Stanford students.
Stanford faculty and staff can
purchase half-priced season tickets
only from Sunday through Tues
day.
Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya sees Lively
Arts as an integral part of campus
culture.
"It is rare that I give a public
presentation without mentioning
the importance of the arts in our
lives," Montoya said. "In my
speech on Tuesday to the Class of
1999 at the Senior Welcome, I en
couraged seniors to explore the
arts and their own creativity.
"The half-priced Lively Arts
ticket program allows all students
to more easily take advantage of
these fantastic artists and without
having to travel to San Francisco."
One of the Lively Arts' first per
formances will be by Chicago City
Limits, a musical comedy improvi
sation troupe, performing on Oct.
8. There are still group discount
tickets available for this perfor
mance.
Another future performer is

Wynton Marsalis, who will conduct
the Lincoln Jazz Orchestra on
March 14. Stanford Continuing
Studies will be offering a five-week
course to accompany this concert
commemorating the 100 th an
niversary of Duke Ellington's
birth.
The Marsalis tickets will sell out
very quickly, according to Field.
"1 urge students to plan in ad
vance if they want to attend this
one," she said.
Michael Moschen, a juggler of
glass balls and flaming ribbons of
light and the only juggler in history
to receive a Mac Arthur Fellow
ship, will be performing on Oct. 23
in Memorial Auditorium.
More information about dis
counts and performance schedules
are available at the Tresidder tick
et office at 725-ARTS.
