MOSCOW (AP) —Russian inflation has skyrock
eted 67 percent since last month, and the Central Hank
said today the worst was still ahead — price hikes could
approaeh 3(X) percent by year's end.
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged strong
steps to stabilize the crumbling economy, and for the
first time since assuming office almost two weeks ago,
he offered the outlines of a plan for combating the cri
sis.
Primakov said he'll pay wage arrears to workers and
soldiers, offer compensation to offset the effects of
inflation, and impose greater state control on the alco
hol industry, a leading source of tax revenue.
But the government is broke and will almost cer
tainly have to print more money to pay its debts, a
move virtually certain to push inflation even higher.
Today's inflation figures confirmed what Russians
already knew — prices have been going up by the day.
Inflation is up 67 percent since the crisis began five
weeks ago, the State Statistics Committee said. The
Central Bank forecast that the rate could reach 240 per

cent to 290 percent by year's end. the Interfax news
agency reported.
A top government official warned today that Russia
could default on its international debt if the Interna
tional Monetary Fund does not continue to extend
financial help to Russia in the coming months.
"I don't want to scare people," said First Vice Pre
mier Alexander Shokhin. "But we do need to count on
the loyal attitude of our partners in the international
financial organizations."
The IMF organized a $22.6 billion loan package in
July and has issued the first installment. But it is expect
ed to delay additional money until it's satisfied that
Russia has sound financial policies.
The head of Russia's Central Bank, Viktor
Gerashchenko, said Russia wanted to work out a set
tlement with banks but said "those who are stubborn in
their greediness may end up getting nothing."
The ruble went from about six to the dollar last
month to as low as 20 to the dollar this month. It has
strengthened a bit and was trading today at around 15.
