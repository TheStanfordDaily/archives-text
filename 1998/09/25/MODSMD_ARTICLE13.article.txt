SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic
(AP) —Hurricane Georges charged across the
Caribbean on a calamitous path toward the Florida
Keys today, leaving rescuers to pull bodies from rivers,
collapsed houses and mudslides.
At least 110 people have died and hundreds were
missing since the sprawling storm began its rampage on
Monday.
A hurricane warning was issued lor south Florida
early today, and officials said 54().(KM) more people
could be asked to leave Miami Beach and other low
lying areas farther up the coast.
At 8 a.m. ED l\ Georges was inland over Cuba,
about 385 miles southeast of Key West, Fla., and was
moving west-northwest at 12 mph. Top winds of 75
mph. extending 35 miles from the center, were expect
ed to increase.
The storm dumped heavy rains across eastern Cuba
today, but there were no immediate reports of death or
injury. Authorities had evacuated 2(K),(HK) people from
their houses in eastern provinces.
Cuban President Fidel Castro told citizens today to
prepare for the storm's fury.
"It is necessary to remain alert for Hooding and not
to relax just because the winds up to now have not been
as strong as expected," Castro said this morning in
comments carried by the official Mexican Notimex
news agency.
On Wednesday. Dominican President Leonel Fer

nandez went on television to announce that 70 people
were dead and hundreds more were missing in his
nation alone. The missing included 45 people who dis
appeared when a school shelter washed away Wednes
day.
Officials have not even begun to reach the Domini
can Republic's hardest-hit areas, where many more vic
tims are expected to be found. Fernandez asked for
unity and urged people to attend church today, the holy
day for the nation's patron saint. Mercedes.
"Pray and ask the Almighty to help the destiny of
our people," he said.
In La Cienega, a shantytown in the Dominican cap
ital of Santo Domingo, the river flooded thousands of
homes, covering some up to their roofs in fetid water.
After leaving the Dominican Republic, Georges
proceeded to Haiti, where flimsy housing in some areas
of the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation proved no
match for the resulting flash floods, and 27 people
reportedly drowned or were killed in Haiti when their
homes collapsed.
In the Dominican Republic, the president said 90
percent of the country's banana plantations were
destroyed and the sugar crop suffered $13 million in
damage.
Fernandez estimated it would take $113 million to
rebuild the country's electrical power system.
"We are facing a titanic task," Fernandez said. "In a
word, the outlook is desolate."
