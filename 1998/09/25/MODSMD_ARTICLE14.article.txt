# Testimony sought in Clinton case

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Presi-
dential press secretary Mike
McCurry yesterday accused Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starr of
stonewalling Democratic requests
to turn over material withheld from
the House that could help Clinton.
"He gets to be the sole arbiter of
the material that goes to the House.
Now he's going to decide, well, '1 get
to pick and choose what I'm going
to provide to the members of the
House.' ... That is really unfair."
McCurry said.
On Capitol Hill, committee

investigators have been directed to
quickly organize nearly 70.000
pages of potential impeachment evi
dence, a prelude to scheduling a
vote to formally investigate Clinton.
Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-111.. told investigators he'd
like them to make presentations to
lawmakers behind closed doors next
Thursday and Friday.
Hyde wants to have a recom
mendation before the House the
week of Oct. 4. with hearings to
begin after the Nov. 3 midterm con
gressional elections.

Several Republicans familiar
with the deliberations said GOP
officials were considering a plan to
allow the Judiciary Committee to
enlarge its inquiry to include addi
tional conduct that might be consid
ered impeachable offenses. That
view would permit the committee to
range far beyond Clinton's relation
ship with Monica Lewinsky.
Democrats have said they would
vigorously contest any expansion of
the case beyond Starr's evidence
relating to the former White House
intern.
