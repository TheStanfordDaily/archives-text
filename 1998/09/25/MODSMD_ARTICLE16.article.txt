Residential Computing's
new fee hike stifles Inter
net use and accessibility

THE IJNVERSITY HAS taken an
ominous step by raising the annual
Ice for an in-room connection from
$45 to $K(). Residential Computing's failure
to adequately notify students of the change
and to commit to a cap on additional
charges in the future raises the scary possi
bility that the next move might be charges
tor online services such as e-mail and Inter
net access.
There is no doubt that Stanford offers an
extensive computer network. Ethernet
access is available in most campus housing
and Residential Computer Consultants
make getting online an easy task. Most stu
dents are pleased with the easy accessibility
of online services and public computer clus
ters that boast fast World Wide Web
browsers and e-mail services.
We understand that the University may
not be able to provide online services to so
many students at very cheap costs. This is
the point Res Comp director Jeff Merriman
made when he explained that subscribing at
home to networks comparable to Stan
ford's would cost around $4(X) per month.
We also understand, however, that we
attend a university where online access is an
absolute necessity. In-room access is obvi
ously most essential for graduate students
in engineering and the sciences.
Course scheduling, the library catalog
and even class web pages, however, have

made access critical to students in every
department.
Many classes, for example, ask students
to register for sections online. Teaching
assistants and professors also publish class
notes and important messages 011 Web
sites. Often, students use the Web for sup
plementary materials. For most students,
these new online resources save time and
effort and allow for more interaction with
professors and teaching assistants.
Because the Internet is necessary and
useful, the University should provide incen
tives for students who use their own com
puters instead of raising fees for in-room
connections. While it is unnecessary to
adopt a policy that requires every student to
have a personal computer, it seems that the
University should promote every attempt
to use personal computers to achieve more
effective learning and communication.
According to Yahoo Internet Life, Stan
ford was the nation's 27th most wired col
lege campus in the nation, a huge drop from
its place last year at No. 5. The magazine
explained the ranking was due to Stanford's
failure to maximize its online capabilities to
foster close communication and coopera
tion among students, faculty and adminis
trators. The access is there, but the incen
tives to use it is not.
It is the University's responsiblity to
encourage students to maximize online pos
sibilities in order to receive the best educa
tion possible.
By raising the in-room connection fee
and leaving open the possibility that stu
dents may be charged further for e-mail and
Internet access, the University is walking in
the wrong direction.
