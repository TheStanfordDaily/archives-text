## Rodin's 'Thinker': a loner on campus

I REMEMBER AN
afternoon last fall
when I walked out of
class just as the sun was
beginning to set behind
Hoover Tower. It had
been one of those perfect
days: great classes in the

morning, a chance to catch up on the gossip
in White Plaza at noon, a trip to Savers to
pick up some '80s garb for a party, and then
a late-afternoon seminar that blew my mind
away. The warm orange glow of a California
sunset was the icing on the cake. I couldn't
help myself and shouted to no one in partic
ular, "I love this place!"
A savvy prospective student heard my
exclamation and approached me. He smiled
and asked, "Okay, but what don't you love
about Stanford?"
I paused, taken aback, and realized that I
couldn't think of anything in particular. But
as I hiked home I thought about his ques
tion, and now I think I have an answer.
Sometimes it feels like Stanford lacks an
intellectual culture. We don't often continue
academic discussions outside the classroom.
When I first read about Cultures, Ideas and
Values in "Approaching Stanford" during
the spring of my senior year in high school, I
envisioned late-night discussions of Plato
and Aristotle in the dorni halls.

If these intellectual debates ever took
place, I never saw them my freshman year in
Eucalipto. So much of the material present
ed in our classes deserves discussion outside
the classroom, and yet we rarely bother to
invest time when no grade is involved.
And while many Stanford students defi
nitely have academic passion, few actually
show it. If you ask students what's up, they
are more likely to talk about their social
activities than their classes or research. For
some, this may change when they begin to
focus on individual projects and the rigors of
upper-division classes.
Some of my favorite experiences in a
four-class dormitory were my conversations
with seniors who were working on their the
ses. It was exciting to witness their knowl
edge grow as they delved deeper into their
topics and to see the results of their work at
the end of the year.
This intellectual growth can happen in
regular classes too. There is no reason why a
freshman taking CIV can't explore the same
path as a senior working on her thesis.
Some of my most rewarding moments at
Stanford have occurred as a result of intense
academic work. I love being involved in as
many activities as possible, but I also appre
ciate the results when I make time to fine
tune a paper instead of starting it the night
before it is due. I used to wish that Stanford

could make it easier for me to get work
done. I wished that some of the great oppor
tunities would just go away and let me do my
CIV reading in peace.
But now I've realized that it is my respon
sibility to make choices, and to accept the
fact that I can't do everything. Poor grades,
no time for friends and no sleep brought me
to the realization that I was trying to do too
much.
I've watched many friends struggle with
this same issue and seen others finish Stan
ford without ever having found time to
devote to academics. As much as I love all of
the amazing activities and incredible people
on campus, we are here, first and foremost,
to learn.
If I have a wish for Stanford, it is for a
campus culture that values intellectual pas
sion. The administration is heading in the
right direction by organizing freshman and
sophomore seminars, but students need to
support the effort by investing more than
the bare minimum.
This fall as classes begin, don't be afraid
to continue a discussion outside of section.
Ask people what they are learning about
instead of just asking, "What's up?"
