MEN S SOCCER
â–  TONIGHT: No. 15 Stanford (4-2)
vs. USF (0-6).

USF (0-6) has lost eight straight
matches dating to last season and 12
of its past 13. Yet, the last time the
Stanford men's soccer team (4-2) de
feated the Dons was in 1991. Last
season's victory by the Dons came on
a goal in the last minute at the Cali
fornia Invitational. In 19%, the Car
dinal was leading the game until USF
scored late in the second half and the
game ended in a tie. Thus, the eight
Stanford seniors have never man
aged a victory against the Dons.
"The seniors feel this is their last
chance to claim a USF scalp," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark.
The game with USF will doubtless
bring in many emotions from both
sides. The Dons are looking to snap
their eight-game losing streak and
hope to extend their undefeated run
against the Cardinal to seven. The
Stanford players are looking to beat
the Dons for the first time in their ca
reers, and head into the bulk of the
season with a victory.
This match marks No. 15 Stan
ford's first home game in almost
three weeks. In its last game at New
Maloney Field, the Cardinal suffered
a disappointing loss to No. 8 San Jose

State 2-1.
Stanford's past three games were
played on the East Coast. During its
trip to New England, the Cardinal
won two of its three games. The first
game was a 1-0 overtime victory over
Harvard, with senior captain A.J.
Sauer providing the heroics with a
game-winning goal in the 101st
minute. Stanford's other two games
were part of the Men's Soccer Classic
at Dartmouth.
In the first game of the tourna
ment, the Cardinal put on a brilliant
show in its 3-0 upset victory over
then-12th-ranked Boston Universi
ty. In that game, senior Jamie Clark
provided the game-winning goal.
That win sent Stanford to the cham
pionship game against the host
school. No. 11 Dartmouth. The Big
Green shut out the Cardinal for the
first time this season and took the
match 2-0.
Despite the disappointing finish
against Dartmouth, Sauer, senior
Simon Elliott and junior defender
Gerard Davis garnered All-Tourna
ment honors.
As if a victory over the Dons
weren't enough motivation, the team
is also excited to play tor the first time
with the student body on the Farm.
"We are excited for our first
chance to play with the students on
campus," Clark said. "It is a great
place for students to see great soccer.
We have to put on a show for them."
After the defeat to Dartmouth,
Clark states that no changes will be
made in his game plan.
"It doesn't matter who we are
