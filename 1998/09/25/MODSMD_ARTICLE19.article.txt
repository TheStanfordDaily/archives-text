# Women down San Jose State, 2-0, ready to face No. 2 Santa Clara
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial Staff 
Coming off an upset of eighth
ranked Texas A&M last Sunday,
the 19th-ranked women's soccer
team (5-1-1) kept the momentum
going with a win against unranked
San Jose State 2-0 last night at New
Maloney Field.
The win comes at an opportune
time as the Cardinal faces its stiffest
competition of the season in No. 2
Santa Clara this Sunday.
"I knew it would be a difficult
game," said head coach Steve Swan
son, going into his best season yet on
the farm. "San Jose is well organized
and well coached. Looking back at
the end of the season it may well be
our hardest game. Our team played
disciplined and kept working at
what I asked them. I am very
pleased."
A lackluster first half kept the
score at a stalemate. Stanford hus
tled to every ball but the midfield
had difficulty connecting with the
forward pairs of redshirt junior
Kelly Adamson and senior captain
Tracye Lawyer and junior [Cather
ine Bernard and freshman Martha
West. Senior goalkeeper Erin Bryla
kept the few shots San Jose could
muster at bay and the Stanford de
fense refused to let the Spartans
penetrate.
"Erin Bryla did a great job
tonight," Swanson said. "She re
sponded big time."
San Jose started the second half
off with a bang. Only 40 seconds into

the half they stormed the field and
fired a shot straight at the goal. It ric
ocheted off Bryla and the rebound
was headed into the net for an ap
parent goal. However, a foul on San
Jose had been called before the
header, and the goal was deemed in
valid.
The fire had been fueled and San
Jose wanted the win badly. The
Spartans picked up their play a
notch and hit Stanford hard. Foul
calls erupted all over the field and
Stanford started to respond to the
physical pressure San Jose applied
with a little offensive magic.
Adamson, last week's Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Week, led
the offense and had a phenomenal
night.
Her speed, footwork and quick

senior captain Lawyer headed it into
the top left corner for a goal and a
Stanford lead.
Junior Ronnie Fair quickly re
sponded six minutes later with a goal
of her own off a direct kick. The ball
was set 25 yards out and Fair, trying
to find Adamson, who dummied the
ball, careened it into the bottom
right corner of the net.
There was nothing San Jose could
do and Stanford dominated the rest
of the game.
The back field played a solid
game, led by freshman Amy Sauer
and junior Jennifer O'Sullivan. Red
shirt sophomore Christy Arnold, a
midfielder, kept excellent control of
the middle.
"We played really well at times,"
Fair said. "San Jose is a hard-work
ing team. With Santa Clara on Sun
day it would have been easy to lose
focus. This was really important to
get the momentum going into Sun
day's game, which is going to be
emotional."
