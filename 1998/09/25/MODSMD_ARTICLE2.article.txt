# SUBS pairs frosh with upperclassmen

### Betsy Carroll 
Stanford University Big Sibs
plans to kick off the year with a bar
becue this afternoon from 4 p.m. to
6 p.m. at Wilbur Field. The pro
gram. designed to welcome students
of all backgrounds, is new for this
year, and hopes to offer many op
portunities for both freshmen and
upperclassmen.
Stephen Kane, a junior and the
group's chair, originally got the idea
for the program because of the diffi
culties he faced on his first day at
Stanford.
"I had a really tough first day,"
Kane said. "I felt overwhelmed be
cause I didn't understand the
process. It wasn't a good day for
me."
In the midst of his confusion,
Kane wished that he could have had
an upperclass friend with him to ex
plain all the particulars of his first
day at the Farm. Thus, the idea for
SUBS was born.
Since that troublesome first day.

Kane's plan has grown to a fairly siz
able reality. "We have about 135 big
sibs. We expect a big turnout," he
said.
Although the program already
has a substantial roster of eager up
perclassmen, the group is still very
willing to accept new big sibs.
Sophomores, juniors and seniors
are also encouraged to attend this
afternoon's festivities.
"It's all dependent on how many
freshmen we have. We definitely
are looking for more big sibs," said
Julia Adler-Milstein, a sophomore
SUBS core team member.
Kane added, "If upperclassmen
come to the barbecue, we'll have
forms for them, too."
The program plans to start its ac
tivities almost immediately. "We're
going to match sibs right away and
next week we have a scavenger
hunt," Kane said. "We want to push
from the beginning."
The group hopes to have about
three or four activities per quarter.
