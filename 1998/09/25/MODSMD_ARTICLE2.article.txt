# SUBS pairs frosh with upperclassmen

### Betsy Carroll 
Stanford University Big Sibs
plans to kick off the year with a bar
becue this afternoon from 4 p.m. to
6 p.m. at Wilbur Field. The pro
gram. designed to welcome students
of all backgrounds, is new for this
year, and hopes to offer many op
portunities for both freshmen and
upperclassmen.
Stephen Kane, a junior and the
group's chair, originally got the idea
for the program because of the diffi
culties he faced on his first day at
Stanford.
"I had a really tough first day,"
Kane said. "I felt overwhelmed be
cause I didn't understand the
process. It wasn't a good day for
me."
In the midst of his confusion,
Kane wished that he could have had
an upperclass friend with him to ex
plain all the particulars of his first
day at the Farm. Thus, the idea for
SUBS was born.
Since that troublesome first day.

Kane's plan has grown to a fairly siz
able reality. "We have about 135 big
sibs. We expect a big turnout," he
said.
Although the program already
has a substantial roster of eager up
perclassmen, the group is still very
willing to accept new big sibs.
Sophomores, juniors and seniors
are also encouraged to attend this
afternoon's festivities.
"It's all dependent on how many
freshmen we have. We definitely
are looking for more big sibs," said
Julia Adler-Milstein, a sophomore
SUBS core team member.
Kane added, "If upperclassmen
come to the barbecue, we'll have
forms for them, too."
The program plans to start its ac
tivities almost immediately. "We're
going to match sibs right away and
next week we have a scavenger
hunt," Kane said. "We want to push
from the beginning."
The group hopes to have about
three or four activities per quarter.
including outings to nearby points of
interest and on-campus events.
"It's an opportunity for freshmen
and upperclassmen to meet up in a
fun setting," Adler-Milstein said.
One unique feature of the pro
gram is its organization into teams.
Each of the 13 teams will consist of
approximately 20 students, with one
big sib appointed as team captain.

"The job of the captain is to facil
itate communication between [the
SUBS core team] and their group,"
Kane said. In addition to the larger
teams, two little sibs and two big sibs
will be organized into families.
The program's leaders are eager
to introduce their program to the
Class of 2002. "It's something Stan
ford doesn't provide at this time,"
Adler-Milstein said. "I think it's
turned less into an umbrella organi
zation and more into a group for
everyone."
