with a revamped roster full of younger players.

Stanford will carry its newfound momentum into its
first road conference matches of the season, at Arizona
tonight at 7 p.m. and at Arizona State on Sunday.
Despite Stanford's past dominance of the series with
Arizona (10-0,2-0), this year's squad figures to be a true
test for the Cardinal.
The Wildcats return only one starter from last season,
but are off to their best start in school history, and are
currently ranked 20th in the nation.
However, Arizona has not yet faced a ranked oppo
nent, so Stanford will be its first serious competition of
the season.
"It is hard to know what to expect from Arizona,"
Shaw said. "Just like us, they are restructuring their ros
ter and are unpredictable at this point. They lost five
starters, but are 2-0 in the Pac-10. so they must be doing
something right."
In Arizona State (4-5, 1-1), the Cardinal encounters
yet another young opponent that is working to establish
team chemistry and finalize its lineup. In the past, Stan
ford has owned ASU, losing just three of its 36 meetings
with the Sun Devils.
Shaw will look for continuing improvement from his
young players this weekend to guide the Cardinal to vic
tory.
Freshman Michelle Chambers will have plenty to
build upon, following the best game of her career against
UCLA, in which she racked up 22 kills, 15 digs, and 5
blocks.

Bruins. Walsh's shoulder will be back at full strength this weekend as Stanford visits
Arizona and Arizona State.
"Michelle Chambers really
picked up the slack for us against
UCLA," Shaw said. "And Jennifer
Detmer had a very solid weekend as
well."
Shaw was not the only one to no

against UCLA, as the sophomore
middle blocker was awarded Pac-10
Player of the Week Honors for the
first time in her young career.
The ability of the Cardinal's new
starters to step up will be a key to its
success all season long.
But the one-two punch of Det

important last weekend, consider

out of practice on Saturday.
Walsh is expected to be back in
full swing in Arizona, anchoring the
Stanford squad.
"Combining the improvement of
Chambers and Detmer with
Walsh's return to full strength will
be great for this team," Shaw said.
"As long as our outside hitters
do well, good things will happen this
weekend."
