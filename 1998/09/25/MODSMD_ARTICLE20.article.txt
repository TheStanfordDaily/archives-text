Heading into the 1998 season, Stanford women's vol
leyball head coach Don Shaw knew he would he dealing
with a revamped roster full of younger players.
He also knew that this year's team had plenty of tal
ent, and could only hope that his new starters would
eventually mature and rally behind two-time All-Ameri
can Kerri Walsh to become a serious contender for its
third consecutive national championship.
After all, a young team must learn to crawl together
before it can walk into the national title picture.
However, the seventh-ranked Cardinal (6-2, 2-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) took two huge steps last weekend
with wins over USC and UCLA, and appears to have a
better chance to run back to the Final Four than anyone
thought.
"Going into last weekend's matches, I wasn't sure
what to expect from our young team," Shaw said. "We
were just trying to work with our new lineup and show
some signs of progress. Winning those two games really

put us ahead of schedule."
Stanford will carry its newfound momentum into its
first road conference matches of the season, at Arizona
tonight at 7 p.m. and at Arizona State on Sunday.
Despite Stanford's past dominance of the series with
Arizona (10-0,2-0), this year's squad figures to be a true
test for the Cardinal.
The Wildcats return only one starter from last season,
but are off to their best start in school history, and are
currently ranked 20th in the nation.
However, Arizona has not yet faced a ranked oppo
nent, so Stanford will be its first serious competition of
the season.
"It is hard to know what to expect from Arizona,"
Shaw said. "Just like us, they are restructuring their ros
ter and are unpredictable at this point. They lost five
starters, but are 2-0 in the Pac-10. so they must be doing
something right."
In Arizona State (4-5, 1-1), the Cardinal encounters
yet another young opponent that is working to establish
team chemistry and finalize its lineup. In the past, Stan
ford has owned ASU, losing just three of its 36 meetings
with the Sun Devils.
Shaw will look for continuing improvement from his
young players this weekend to guide the Cardinal to vic
tory.
Freshman Michelle Chambers will have plenty to
build upon, following the best game of her career against
UCLA, in which she racked up 22 kills, 15 digs, and 5
blocks.
