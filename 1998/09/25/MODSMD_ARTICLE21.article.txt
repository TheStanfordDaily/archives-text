# Football hits road, tries for .500 mark

The Stanford football team flies
to Oregon today, looking for its first
Pacific 10 Conference win against
20th-ranked Oregon.
After a thrilling upset victory over
North Carolina last week, the Cardi
nal (1-2. 0-1 Pac-10) will have to con
tinue its winning trend to have any
shot at a major bowl berth.
The Ducks (3-0,0-0) pose several
problems, foremost among them
their speed matchup. Oregon has
speed to burn, and has throughout
head coach Mike Bellotti's tenure.
"They've always been fast." said
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "They were fast last year. It
showed in last year's game. You also
see it on their defense. They force a
lot of turnovers and I think that's due
primarily to their team speed."
Unfortunately, Stanford will
probably enter Autzen Stadium with
one of its fastest weapons in plain
clothes. Junior Troy Walters missed
all of last week's game after leaving
the Sept. 12 Arizona game (a 31-14
loss) with a sprained ankle.
Walters is day-to-day, and in all
likelihood will not play against Ore
gon. Autzen's artificial turf, the only
turf Stanford will play on this year,
may play a role in the decision, which
according to Willingham will have
been made by gametime.
Fortunately, Stanford's wide re
ceiving corps has been quick to fill
the void. In Walter's absence, red
shirt freshman David Davis has
given the Cardinal a deep threat,
racking up 235 yards on 14 catches
for two touchdowns. His 6.0 catches
and 98.3 yards per game are good for
fourth in the conference, and his sea
son total of 295 yards leads the team.
Redshirt sophomore Deßonnie
Pitts started for the first time in this
season's opener, and caught his sec
ond touchdown of the year on a 26-
yard halfback option from redshirt
freshman Coy Wire against UNC.
"I think [the young receivers]
have stepped up." Willingham said.
"They've shown good strong play,
but there's room for improving.

We've had, I think, too many drops."
In last week's game, however,
fifth-year senior Jeff Allen may have
proved to be the answer to Walter's
absence. Coming off a back injury
that still leaves him less than 100 per
cent for tomorrow's game, Allen
caught 5 passes for 111 yards, all in
the first half.

Allen also hauled in a nine-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback
Todd Husak. Before the UNC game,
his first career start, Allen had just
two catches for 43 yards, and had
been relegated primarily to special
teams duty.
"It is exciting, getting to play
now." Allen said. "I played mostly
special teams, because there were so
many talented receivers. It was
tough. Obviously I wanted to play,
but just contributing to the team in
any way is great."
Allen's emergence as a sure
handed flanker is one reason why the
team scored as many points against
UNC's vaunted defense as they had
in their first two games combined.
Wire also made significant contri
butions, with 158 all-purpose yards
on 24 carries, five receptions and two
kickoff returns, in addition to the
touchdown pass to Pitts.
Unfortunately, neither Allen nor
Wire will be able to help Stanford
deal with Oregon's explosive of
fense. The Ducks rank eighth in the
nation in total offense and fourth in
scoring offense. Their 139 points
against Michigan State, Texas-El
Paso and San Jose State make for an
average of 46.3 points per game, the
school's highest three-game output
in 82 years.
"We've done well in preseason
games against non-league oppo
nents." Bellotti said. "But now it's
time to step it up. Looking at Stan
ford, from week one to last week,
they're probably the most improved
team in the nation. It looks like a
whole different team stepped on the
Held (against North Carolina]."
In the first quarter against San
Jose State, the Ducks blew up for 21
points in just 1 minute, 16 seconds of
possession time. They've been espe
cially nasty at home, averaging 53
points and 515 yards of total offense
per game, with an average margin of
victory of over 45 points. Stanford
must slow down Oregon's speedy
wideouts to stay in the ballgame.
"When people look at the con
ference. they don't usually put ()re
gon at the top." Willingham said.
"But when you play them, you see
they're a very quick team."
Another issue is Autzen Stadi
um's frenzied atmosphere. With
Stanford's inexperience — nine
players made their first start against
San Jose State and 18 played in their
first college game — noise may be a
distraction to the Cardinal.
But the Cardinal may have histo
ry on its side. Though Bellotti's
teams have prevailed in all but three
of their last lb games decided by a
touchdown or less, two of the losses
have come courtesy of Stanford.
Two years ago, Stanford place
kicker Kevin Miller kicked a game
tying field goal with just 50 seconds
left and won the game with a 27-
yarder in overtime. Last year, Stan
ford won in a 59-4S shootout that set
Stanford records for most combined
points and yards of offense.
"Our feeling is don't worry about
history, let's make history." Bellotti
said. "We're relatively healthy and
very excited to host Stanford."
The combination of Oregon's
speed, loud atmosphere and eager
ness to avenge past heartbreaks will
make Stanford's excitement impor
tant. The Cardinal can't come out
flat or it will face the dreaded three
losses before ()ctober.
