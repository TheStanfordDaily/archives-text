"We only had one loss and I was
pleased with our effort."
Dettamanti's squad has already
collected 77 points this season,
while its opponents have come up
with only 32. This year's team has
also shown exceptional depth.
Thirteen players have each
scored at least once in competition,
and the season has just begun. The
Cardinal hopes to continue its tradi
tion of success when the 49ers come
to town this weekend.
Stanford goes into Sunday's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
opener against Long Beach State
(3-3) with the advantage of having
already played against the 49ers.
The Long Beach team surprised the
Stanford defense with some strong
offensive play and powerful outside
shots, but the Cardinal battled back
and came away with a 10-6 victory.

Some of the most talented water
polo players in the nation — past
and present — will meet at
deGuerre pool at noon this Satur
day in the Stanford men's water
polo alumni game.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti,
who has led the Cardinal (6-1) pro
gram for the past 22 years, will get
the chance to watch graduates of his
successful program compete with
the "new blood" before this year's
Cardinal squad hosts Long Beach
State at noon on Sunday.
During his time on the Farm,
Dettamanti has coached the men's
water polo team to the Final Four
17 times and has taken home seven
NCAA championships. This sea
son. Dettamanti is approaching his
500 th win (he is currently at 497),
which is a level only two other
coaches in NCAA water polo histo
ry have reached.
And this year, the Cardinal looks
to improve even more on its already
impressive record. Stanford was the
top-ranked team in the national
pre-season coaches' poll and the
team performed well during its five
games last weekend.
"I'm encouraged by the begin
ning of the season," Dettamanti
said after last weekend's win against
UCSD and 3-1 record at the South

port Beach, where the Cardinal fin-

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: Alumni Game, 12 p.m.
■ Sunday: No. 1 Stanford (6-1) vs
Long Beach State (3-3), 12 p.m.

In its third game of the Southern
California Tournament, Stanford
led 3-0 after the first quarter, hut
Long Beaeh State rallied during the
next two quarters and took a 6-5
lead at the end of the third period.
The Cardinal defense stepped it
up and held the 49ers scoreless dur

ing the final quarter of play, while
the offense racked up five points for
a decisive finish.
Now that the Cardinal has seen
the 49ers in action, the Stanford
team is even more prepared for
Sunday's game.
"In the Long Beach game [dur
ing the So Cal tourney] it was a case
of not knowing their personnel,"
Dettamanti said. "They have a good
outside shooter who scored three
goals in the first half. But the second
half we held him scoreless."
The two-point goal was a big fac
tor in the last Stanford-Long Beach
State match. Four of Long Beach's
six points came from two-pointers
scored by 49er star Vinca Dolley
from outside the seven-meter mark.
Stanford's offense also capital
ized on the two-pointer. Junior
Brian Heifferon, who leads the
team in scoring with 14 points, and
senior Layne Beaubien, who is sec
ond with 10 points, both scored two
pointers against 49er goalie Adam
Carter. The Stanford defense was
headed by senior goalie Chris
Aguilera, who tallied eight saves
during the game.
Long Beach State was ranked
ninth in the pre-season coaches'
poll and will play seventh-ranked
Pacific on Saturday before coming
to the Farm Sunday.
Dettamanti feels that his squad
performs better after having seen
the competition, so Stanford is
primed for this weekend's match.
