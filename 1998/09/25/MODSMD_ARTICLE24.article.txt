# GSPB hosts weekend carnival
## 
### Rachel Turow 
The recently formed Graduate
Student Programming Board has
been working over the past few
months to improve the quality of
life of Stanford graduate students.
This Saturday, the board w ill
throw a carnival — a late night
event for graduate students that
will boast a wide array of bever
ages, food, music and "interactive
inflatables." These include a
Bungee Run and an American
Gladiators Joust.
The carnival, which will run
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., will be held on
Mirrielees Field between Rains
Houses and Escondido Village. No
admission will be charged.
Undergraduates beware — this

party is for graduate students only,
and they will be carding very strict
ly. All graduate students are en
couraged to come; a turnout of
I,(XX) people is expected.
Before the advent of the pro
gramming board, programming set
up for the more than 7,(XX) gradu
ate students on campus was primar
ily residence-based.
Because the events held by the
board allow people to gather in
non-academic environments, they
"improve the social life of grad stu
dents, especially when they are
held at the beginning of the year,"
said Stacey Kerkela, the summer
chair of the board.
"We want to encourage off
campus students to come back in
the evenings, and we want to make

sure that international students and
those who are far away from home
for the first time feel welcome."
said Catherine Rose, a doctoral
candidate in mechanical engineer
ing.
Rose helped put together the
board's most recent function, the
Graduate Orientation Activity
Luncheon and Information Event.
Provost Condoleezza Rice spoke at
the welcome lunch for graduate
students, which drew over 1,8(X)
people.
"The GSPB has done a wonder
ful job since their inception,"
Graves said. "The work of the two
chairs. Stacey Kerkela and Meta
Jones, and their various commit
tees. has led to some wonderful
events."

The board was put together last
January to foster a greater sense of
community among graduate stu
dents on campus.
"Graduate student life does not
have to be all lab work and TAing,"
said ASSIJ Vice President Santos
Marroquin.
Associate Dean of Students
Morris Graves agrees that the goal
of the board is to encourage gradu
ate students to break away from
their departmentally focused so
cializing. Graves said graduate stu
dents should instead "socially inte
grate across discipline, across eth
nicity and race, between those stu
dents who are international and do
mestic, among spouses and part
ners and families."
