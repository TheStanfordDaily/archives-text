## 
### Bruce Wang Staff writer 
At Wednesday night's Graduate
Student Council meeting, the stu
dents had both cheers and jeers for
the University's recent housing
changes.
The Graduate Student Council
held its first official meeting of the
fall quarter to review the current
housing situation and to discuss plans
for upcoming events this quarter.
Rising real estate costs during re
cent years have led to a severe hous
ing crunch, hitting graduate students
particularly hard. In an effort to ame
liorate the financial burden on grad
uate students, the University leased
150 off-campus apartments this sum
mer to be rented to graduate stu
dents at below market rates.-All units

have since been rented.
"The apartments were very popu
lar," said doctoral student Robert
Rudnitsky, a member of the council.
Only a few rooms remain available
inside a couple of the apartments.
Rudnitsky also said that the
"stuffed doubles" in Crothers and
Crothers Memorial halls instituted
this year have not been very popular.
Many students are opting to find off
campus residences instead of living
in a one-room double, Rudnitsky
said.
Members of the council an
nounced several activities planned
this quarter for graduate students.
Among them is the annual Hal
loween party to be held in Rains,
funded this year by the council. The
event will be open to all graduate stu
dents.

Pre-parties are planned for Hal
loween in both Crothers Memorial
and Lyman Hall. The council will
provide charter Marguerite service
from those residences to and from
the Rains party to avoid drunk dri
ving across the campus, said Harris
Shapiro, a doctoral student and
council member.
Also on the menu of planned
events is a campus-wide Thanksgiv
ing dinner. The council will provide a
free catered dinner for all graduate
students on campus on Thanksgiving
Day. Last year, a similar potluck din
ner was held for Rains residents, but
this will be the first time such a cam
pus-wide event has been held.
The council is looking into possi
ble on-campus sites for the dinner.
Candidates include the Faculty Club,
the Oak Room in Tresidder Union

and the Ford Center.
According to Rudnitsky, the
event was planned to provide a warm
family atmosphere to those students
unable to go home for Thanksgiving
dinner.
Another event discussed during
the meeting was a dinner with Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Last year. Casper dined with a ran
domly selected group of graduate
students twice. About 90 students
applied to each event, and 12 were
selected for each dinner.
This year's dinner is scheduled for
Nov. 24 at one of the on-campus
graduate residences. Again,
uate students will be randomly se
lected to attend. Dessert, open to all
graduate students, will follow.
A similar dinner with Provost
Condoleezza Rice is also planned.
