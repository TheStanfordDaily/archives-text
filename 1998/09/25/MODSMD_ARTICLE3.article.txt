# A 						day in the life of Taylor
## 
### Clara Kim Contributing writer 
Editor's Note: This is
the first installment in a se
ries which intends to ex
plore the daily life of facul
ty, staff and other random

Stanford folks. To get into the world of pro
fessors, Clara Kim followed Economics
Prof. John Taylor through his first day of
classes.
As a student, it's easy to feel over
whelmed tin the first day of classes. Between
shopping for classes, buying books, meeting
new dormmates and unpacking the big pile
of boxes in the middle of your room, returi.
ing to sch(X)l can seem a little daunting.
Hut have you ever wondered what a pro
fessor's first day is like?
Economics Prof. John Taylor began
teaching at Stanford in 19K5. He teaches the
ever-popular introductory course, Econom

ics 1: "Elementary Economics" in autumn,
which always draws throngs of interested
students.
"It's kind of exciting, especially the fall
quarter because there are lots of new stu
dents around," said Taylor about his first
lectures.
Teaching is more than a 9 to 5 job. Tay
lor's "day" began early; he started planning
for his first lecture days in advance. In order
to prepare for Economics 1, Taylor created
an outline and slides using Microsoft Power
point. He also brushed up on the course ma
terial by looking over several of the chapters
that would be covered in the first few lec
tures.
Taylor also had to coordinate with the 20
teaching assistants for the class, assemble
the syllabus and meet with his secretary to
discuss how students will register for the
course.
As the quarter begins, he already has
tÂ»oals in mind for the class.

"My expectations are
for the students to enjoy
econ, and to get excited
about it.and learn the ba
sics for the subject," said
Taylor.

Wednesday morning, Taylor said he feels
excited, a little uncertain, but not nervous.
"Something little always seems to go
wrong," Taylor said. "You just have to be
ready for the unusual."
And considering all the mishaps that
could have occurred, the first day goes rela
tively smoothly.
8:00 a.m.
In anticipation of the lack of space in the
lecture hall for the 10:(X)a.m. Economics I
class. Taylor has opted this year to give an
earlier lecture, at 8 a.m.. Fie begins the day
by making this first recording.

This quarter's lecture series will be
recorded and put on the Stanford
Online Web site as a resource for
students in the course.
Economics 1, according to Tay
lor, is the first non-engineering
course to be featured on this site.
The purpose of the site is to make
the lectures available for students to
review concepts that they did not
fully understand, and also to serve
as an alternative to taping the lec
tures.
After giving the lecture in the
Gates Building, he attends a meet
ing at the Economics Building to
discuss how it went.
10:00 a.m.
Economics 1 is Taylor's largest
and best-known course, and year
after year, it more than fills Kresge

Auditorium, capacity 520. This year
is no exception.
Wednesday morning, an influx of
eager students, many of them fresh
men, overflow Kresge. Students sit
in the aisles and along the sides of
the hall while Taylor lectures for 50
minutes.
Taylor battles a few technical dif
ficulties with the audiovisual equip
ment, but according to Taylor, the
first class goes well.
"I think it ran a little smoother
than what I expected. I was pretty
happy with how it worked out."
Economics 1 is the only under
graduate course Taylor teaches. His
other courses are targeted toward
graduate students.
"I enjoy teaching at the begin
ning level," Taylor said. "Students
are fresh and it's a time to really get
to the basics of the subject, and be
ginning students are quite lively and
ask interesting questions."
"It's a challenge to convey diffi

cult material to beginning students,
and it's rewarding to see the
progress students make in learning a
difficult subject and the greater
things they do as a result of that."
Some of his students share his en
thusiasm.
"I was really excited to take this
class," said sophomore Bonnie Cole.
"It's a great opportunity to have
such a world-renowned professor."
"I had heard from other students
that he was a great professor," Cole
said. "He seems really interested in
making sure that students learn the
material."
11:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.
Besides lecturing, Taylor has
other responsibilities as a professor.
He spends his early afternoon meet
ing with students, both undergradu
ates and graduates.
Taylor then returns to his office
to respond to student e-mail mes
sages and answer phone calls.

3:15 p.m.
Since this is the first time that
Economics 1 has been featured on
Stanford Online, there are logisti
cal matters to deal with. Taylor
meets with the Stanford Online
producers to discuss technical is
sues, including the copyright for
the lecture series.
SJO p.m.
Because Economics 1 is such a
large class, it requires an unusually
large number of teaching assistants.
Taylor again meets with the 20 grad
uate student TAs in order to discuss
how they will be running their sec
tions. After that, he watches the pro
duction of Stanford Online.
At the end of the day, like most
students, Taylor is tired but satisfied.
"Things worked well, I got a lot of
good things accomplished the first
day," Taylor said when summing up
his first day. "I'm looking forward to
the rest of the quarter."
