Editor's Note: This is
the first installment in a se
ries which intends to ex
plore the daily life of facul
ty, staff and other random

Stanford folks. To get into the world of pro
fessors, Clara Kim followed Economics
Prof. John Taylor through his first day of
classes.
As a student, it's easy to feel over
whelmed tin the first day of classes. Between
shopping for classes, buying books, meeting
new dormmates and unpacking the big pile
of boxes in the middle of your room, returi.
ing to sch(X)l can seem a little daunting.
Hut have you ever wondered what a pro
fessor's first day is like?
Economics Prof. John Taylor began
teaching at Stanford in 19K5. He teaches the
ever-popular introductory course, Econom

ics 1: "Elementary Economics" in autumn,
which always draws throngs of interested
students.
"It's kind of exciting, especially the fall
quarter because there are lots of new stu
dents around," said Taylor about his first
lectures.
Teaching is more than a 9 to 5 job. Tay
lor's "day" began early; he started planning
for his first lecture days in advance. In order
to prepare for Economics 1, Taylor created
an outline and slides using Microsoft Power
point. He also brushed up on the course ma
terial by looking over several of the chapters
that would be covered in the first few lec
tures.
Taylor also had to coordinate with the 20
teaching assistants for the class, assemble
the syllabus and meet with his secretary to
discuss how students will register for the
course.
As the quarter begins, he already has
tÂ»oals in mind for the class.

"My expectations are
for the students to enjoy
econ, and to get excited
about it.and learn the ba
sics for the subject," said
Taylor.

Wednesday morning, Taylor said he feels
excited, a little uncertain, but not nervous.
"Something little always seems to go
wrong," Taylor said. "You just have to be
ready for the unusual."
And considering all the mishaps that
could have occurred, the first day goes rela
tively smoothly.
8:00 a.m.
In anticipation of the lack of space in the
lecture hall for the 10:(X)a.m. Economics I
class. Taylor has opted this year to give an
earlier lecture, at 8 a.m.. Fie begins the day
by making this first recording.
