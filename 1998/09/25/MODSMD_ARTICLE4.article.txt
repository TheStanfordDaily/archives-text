# Sand Hill case settled
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
Approximately a

year after the city of Menlo Park
filed a lawsuit against the City of
Palo Alto and Stanford concerning
the Sand Hill Road development,
the controversial case has finally
been settled.
Former Monterey County Judge
Harkjoon Paik. coming out of retire
ment to hear the case, ruled in favor
of Palo Alto and Stanford. He
deemed the environmental impact
report for Stanford's $342 million
development project to be legally

acceptable.
I'aik's ruling is the go-ahead that
Palo Alto and Stanford have been
anticipating. Construction can now
begin on the project, pending the ac
quisition of construction permits.
While the City of Menlo Park may
appeal I'aik's decision, that action
would not hinder construction.
Menlo Park officials claimed that
the report did not fully address Stan
ford's plans to expand the School of
Medicine. They also contended that
F.IP Associates, the company that
compiled the report, had not done a
thorough enough job of assessing
the environmental impact of the

proposed Sand Hill projects.
Foremost, Menlo Park argued
that the report was faulty in that it al
legedly did not adequately address
the increase in traffic, noise and air
pollution caused by the widening of
Sand Hill Road.
The report "lumped together
traffic factors that should have been
looked at separately," said Bill Mc-
Clure, the city attorney for Menlo
Park who worked on the case. "It
didn't adequately discuss the Med
ical Center expansion. But [Paikj
decided these issues wouldn't con
stitute a significant impact and that
the report was fine."

Menlo Park's contention that the
report did not meet requirements of
the California Environmental Qual
ity Act was rebuffed by attorneys for
Palo Alto and Stanford, who insist
ed that it was legally sound.
The report "analyzes the four
projects it was intended to report on
in the manner required by law." Paik
wrote in the conclusion to his 22-
page decision. "Conclusions regard
ing these four projects are substanti
ated by evidence in the record."
"The Court cannot substitute its
judgment or the judgment of Menlo


Horton
Park for the judgment of the lead
agency [Palo Alto] in approving the
projects; nor is it the Court's func
tion to question the wisdom of the
Palo Alto City Council."
Steve Kafka, chief attorney for
Palo Alto, is skeptical of the possibil
ity of a successful appeal. "We had
an extremely thorough environmen
tal report," Kafka said. "Menlo Park
raised dozens of issues that weren't
particularly strong, which is why the
judge didn't rule in their favor, and

it's doubtful that another judge
would."
The addition of 1,500 parking
spaces on the south side of Stanford
Shopping Center near Quarry Road
will begin this February. These new
spaces are being created to compen
sate for the loss of parking that will
come with the widening of Sand Hill
Road from two lanes to four be
tween Santa Cruz Avenue in Menlo
Park and Arboretum Drive in Palo
Alto, and Sand Hill's extension to El
Camino Real
Included in the plans for the pro
ject are 628 apartments and 3KX se
nior citizen housing units. The senior

housing will be placed where the old
Stanford Children's Hospital was,
near the Medical Center. This
arrangement will be especially con
venient for senior citizens, according
to Larry Horton, director of govern
ment and community relations for
the University.
Twenty-five percent of the new
apartments will be rented by the Uni •
versity at lower-than-market rates set
by the state for lower-income renters.
The other 75 percent of the apart
ments and all of the senior housing
will be rented at market rates.
The University will also expand
retail space in the Stanford Shop

ping Center by about 5 percent. The
University is also building five new
intramural athletic fields on Sand
Hill, across from the Oak Creek
Apartments.
Revenue from the new apart
ments, senior housing, and shopping
center expansion will pay for all con
struction and the widening of Sand
Hill. The widening of the road has
been approved four times within the
past 30 years, but neither Palo Alto
nor the University would pay for the
job.
All projects are scheduled to be
completed by fall of 2001. "It is an
aggressive schedule," Horton said.
