# Sand Hill case settled
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
Approximately a

year after the city of Menlo Park
filed a lawsuit against the City of
Palo Alto and Stanford concerning
the Sand Hill Road development,
the controversial case has finally
been settled.
Former Monterey County Judge
Harkjoon Paik. coming out of retire
ment to hear the case, ruled in favor
of Palo Alto and Stanford. He
deemed the environmental impact
report for Stanford's $342 million
development project to be legally

acceptable.
I'aik's ruling is the go-ahead that
Palo Alto and Stanford have been
anticipating. Construction can now
begin on the project, pending the ac
quisition of construction permits.
While the City of Menlo Park may
appeal I'aik's decision, that action
would not hinder construction.
Menlo Park officials claimed that
the report did not fully address Stan
ford's plans to expand the School of
Medicine. They also contended that
F.IP Associates, the company that
compiled the report, had not done a
thorough enough job of assessing
the environmental impact of the

proposed Sand Hill projects.
Foremost, Menlo Park argued
that the report was faulty in that it al
legedly did not adequately address
the increase in traffic, noise and air
pollution caused by the widening of
Sand Hill Road.
The report "lumped together
traffic factors that should have been
looked at separately," said Bill Mc-
Clure, the city attorney for Menlo
Park who worked on the case. "It
didn't adequately discuss the Med
ical Center expansion. But [Paikj
decided these issues wouldn't con
stitute a significant impact and that
the report was fine."

Menlo Park's contention that the
report did not meet requirements of
the California Environmental Qual
ity Act was rebuffed by attorneys for
Palo Alto and Stanford, who insist
ed that it was legally sound.
The report "analyzes the four
projects it was intended to report on
in the manner required by law." Paik
wrote in the conclusion to his 22-
page decision. "Conclusions regard
ing these four projects are substanti
ated by evidence in the record."
"The Court cannot substitute its
judgment or the judgment of Menlo
