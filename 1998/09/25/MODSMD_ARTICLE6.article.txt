## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
When asked about the importance of a community
center catering to the needs of the lesbian, gay. bisexual
and transgendered communities, Gwendolyn Dean
took a moment before replying.
"As individuals, we can be very isolated," she said.
Dean, the first director of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexu
al Community Center, was hired in the spring after a na
tionwide search and began her duties Aug. 1.
"We can't identify each other visually. Some first
year students have never met others like themselves.
There are worries about students and peers .... The
center provides support."
Dean said that one of her initial goals after signing on
to the position was to make sure that current programs
and services continue.
"The changes I'm working on are mostly in terms of
expanding and increasing programs," Dean said be
tween greeting visitors at the center, located on the sec
ond floor of the Old Fire Truck I louse.
Her hiring was not without controversy. Student pro
posals called for a full-time director for the center, but
the University only allocated funds for Dean's half-time
position. Before Dean's arrival, the LGBCC was the
only community center on campus without a director.
Her first nroject, which she is working on with the Of
fice of Residential Education, is to create a "safe space"
program. This would entail the placement of a logo on a
door or window that would indicate to students that the
person inside has been educated and is open-minded
about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered issues.
Dean said that many students suffer ongoing daily
stress negotiating their identity with everyone on cam
pus and hopes that the program will create a friendlier.
warmer environment for students.
"Something like this is definitely
needed ... I think it's a great idea,"
said Diedre Blake, a staff member
last year at the center.
Only Res Ed staff will be involved
in the pilot program, but Dean is hop
ing to include students in the pro
gram at a later time. ITie program is
scheduled to begin winter quarter,
following fall quarter training de
signed to allow staff members to pro
vide a safe climate for students.
Dean also plans to increase the
availability of diversity training in the
Stanford community.
"There are a lot more levels we
can work on as far as educating peo
ple," said Dean, adding that she
wants such programs to be extremely
well organized. She said that she
hopes to have such efforts partly or
ganized by winter quarter.
She is also committed to providing
space and support for different stu
dent-run groups at the center.
"I'm really excited she's empha
sizing [lesbian, gay and bisexual|-
identified student organizations,"
said Troy Gilbert, assistant to the vice
provost for student affairs. "In recent
years we've lost a lot of activity."
Gilbert, who has met with Dean

several times, praised her under
standing of community dynamics.
"She brings a wealth of experi
ence with her," Gilbert said.
Before coming to Stanford, Dean
was graduate coordinator of the Of
fice of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Life at Emory University in Atlanta.
She is working on her dissertation to
receive a doctorate in an interdiscipli
nary program focusing on Feminist
Theory, Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Studies and Art History from Emory.
She also holds an master's in perfor
mance art from UC-Irvine.
"The operating budget is much
smaller than what I'm used to," Dean
said. "But there's more space here
than Emory. In many ways it's hard
to compare resources."
Dean plans to increase the cen
ter's library resources and form an
acquisition plan to look for funds.
She hopes to strengthen ties between
the center and alumni groups, such as
(Jay and Lesbian Alumni.
"I'm hoping to put together more
organized kind of career programs,"
she said.
Other plans include increased
academic programs and more acade
mic speakers, as well as providing
more legal, cultural and political in
formation for students.
"She seems like a wonderful per
son," Blake said. "It's just a matter of
seeing how well she'll be doing."
