When asked about the importance of a community
center catering to the needs of the lesbian, gay. bisexual
and transgendered communities, Gwendolyn Dean
took a moment before replying.
"As individuals, we can be very isolated," she said.
Dean, the first director of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexu
al Community Center, was hired in the spring after a na
tionwide search and began her duties Aug. 1.
"We can't identify each other visually. Some first
year students have never met others like themselves.
There are worries about students and peers .... The
center provides support."
Dean said that one of her initial goals after signing on
to the position was to make sure that current programs
and services continue.
"The changes I'm working on are mostly in terms of
expanding and increasing programs," Dean said be
tween greeting visitors at the center, located on the sec
ond floor of the Old Fire Truck I louse.
Her hiring was not without controversy. Student pro
posals called for a full-time director for the center, but
the University only allocated funds for Dean's half-time
position. Before Dean's arrival, the LGBCC was the
only community center on campus without a director.
Her first nroject, which she is working on with the Of
fice of Residential Education, is to create a "safe space"
program. This would entail the placement of a logo on a
door or window that would indicate to students that the
person inside has been educated and is open-minded
about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered issues.
Dean said that many students suffer ongoing daily
stress negotiating their identity with everyone on cam
pus and hopes that the program will create a friendlier.
