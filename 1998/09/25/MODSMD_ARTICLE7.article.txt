I lie new projector, described as "state of
the art" by Matt Ciarlinghouse, head of SSE,
is the same type used by the AMC Mercado

projector is in tht process of being installed."
Flicks manager "lin Han said. "The installa
tion is taking . nuch longer time than I had
anticipated."
Ciarlinghouse said that when installed, the
new projector will not only result in a better
image but improved sound quality as well.

The new system includes Dolby Digital
Sound, and it should make Flicks "sound I(X)
percent better," he said.
The new projection system should also be
more reliable. "The new projector is a single
projector system with a brighter ;ind more
consistent light source." Garlinghouse said.
"The old system had two projectors, so there
were twice as many chances for things to go
wrong."

Flicks prices should remain constant. Gar
linghouse said that SSE fully funded the pur

timately "be cheaper for everyone." since
SSE is no longer renting the projector from
the University, and will rent the new one to
other student groups.
The new projector is the culmination of
six months of work by SSE. Garlinghouse
