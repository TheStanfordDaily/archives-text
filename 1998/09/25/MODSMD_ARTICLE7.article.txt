### Jennifer Stewart 
When "The Truman Show" opens the fall
ASSI! Sunday Flicks season. Flicks opera
tors hope that students will he seeing Jim
Carrey's face in new clarity thanks to a new
movie projector purchased by Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises.
I lie new projector, described as "state of
the art" by Matt Ciarlinghouse, head of SSE,
is the same type used by the AMC Mercado
20 Theaters in Santa Clara.
SSE anticipates that the projector will be
ready by Sunday, but the installation is un
dergoing unanticipated delays. "The new
projector is in tht process of being installed."
Flicks manager "lin Han said. "The installa
tion is taking . nuch longer time than I had
anticipated."
Ciarlinghouse said that when installed, the
new projector will not only result in a better
image but improved sound quality as well.

The new system includes Dolby Digital
Sound, and it should make Flicks "sound I(X)
percent better," he said.
The new projection system should also be
more reliable. "The new projector is a single
projector system with a brighter ;ind more
consistent light source." Garlinghouse said.
"The old system had two projectors, so there
were twice as many chances for things to go
wrong."
Despite the purchase of the projector.
Flicks prices should remain constant. Gar
linghouse said that SSE fully funded the pur
chase of the projector. 1 le believes it will ul
timately "be cheaper for everyone." since
SSE is no longer renting the projector from
the University, and will rent the new one to
other student groups.
The new projector is the culmination of
six months of work by SSE. Garlinghouse
emphasized that the new projector
represents an important step for
the organization as it seeks to "re
focus on customer service."
The original projector had been
used since the founding of Flicks
over 60 years ago. Because of the
age of the old projector and some

of its unusual modifications, parts
of it will go on display at the Muse
um of Motion Pictures within the
Museum of the City of San Francis
co.
All Stanford students will be
able to see the new projection sys
tem once it is installed at regular
Flicks shows every Sunday at 7
p.m. and 10 p.m. Admission is $4
per show, or a season pass can be
prepurchased for $ 18.
