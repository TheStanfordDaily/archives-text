112 Become a Truman Scholar
Harry S. Truman Scholarships, which honor the thirty-third President of
the United States, are awarded on the basis of merit to students who are
juniors in 1998-99, have compiled excellent academic records, and have
demonstrated outstanding potential for leadership in public service. The
Foundation defines "public service" as employment in government, public
interest organizations, research and/or educational organizations, and public
service non-profit organizations such as those whose primary aim is to help
needy or disadvantaged persons or to protect the environment. Each of the
approximately 80 Truman Scholarships to be awarded in 1999 covers expenses
during the senior undergraduate year and two or three years of graduate study
up to a total of $30,000.
