Treating Yourself to
FI R %)T A I D
Here are first aid basics for
some common problems.
Cuts and Scrapes
What to Do
■ Stop the bleeding: Apply
direct pressure with a clean
cloth for 2 to 5 minutes and
elevate the area
■ Wash carefully with mild
soap; apply Bacitracin, and
cover with a bandage
Note: If there's dirt in an
abrasion, scrub it thoroughly -
otherwise you risk infection and
the dirt may permanently
"tattoo" the skin
■ Get a tetanus shot if you
haven't had one within 10 years
Puncture Wound: Allow some
bleeding to clean it out; soak
several times a day for a few days
Get Help If:
■ Your injuries are extensive
■ The wound gapes open (it
requires stitches)
■ The location is of cosmetic
concern
■ You have severe pain
■ You suspect infection; swelling,
heat, redness, pus, or red
streaks going towanl the heart
Burns
What to Do
■ Immediately apply a cold
compress for 20 to 30 minutes
(it stops the burning)
■ Wash in cool water, pat dry,
apply a thin layer of Bacitracin,
and cover with a bandage
■ Change the dressing every 24
hours; more often if it gets wet
or dirty
Note: There's no harm in
leaving a blister intact (it's a
natural bandage)
These Stanford students in the
'20s probably needed a little
first aid.
Get Help If:
■ Blisters are located in a sen
sitive area (face, hand or
genitalia), or surrounds an
entire extremity such as a finger
■ It looks charred, or is an
electrical burn
Nosebleed
What to Do
■ Pinch nostrils closed for 10
minutes (time by clock)
holding your head forward
■ Put a cold pack over nose
bridge
■ Don't pick at or blow your
nose for 24 hours
■ Prevention: Apply Vaseline
or similar ointment to a Q-Tip
and gently swab inside nose
to keep moist
Get Help If:
■ Bleeding doesn't stop after 30
to 45 minutes, or if it recurs
Tick Bites
What to Do
■ Remove the critter with
tweezers; grab it as close to
the head as possible (close to
your skin); pull back firmly
and continuously
■ Wash and watch for signs of
infection
Note: Myths abound on tick
removal: don't burn, smother, or
squeeze between your fingers; use
method above
Get Help If:
■ There's infection or local rash
Bee Stings
What to Do
■ If there's a stinger, remove it
with a firm sweep of your
student ID or credit card held
perpendicular to the skin (do
ASAP as it's the venom that
causes pain)
■ Elevate area, apply a cold
compress, take Tylenol for
pain, and Benedryl or other
antihistamine for itching
Get Help If:
■ You have an allergic reaction
■ You suspect infection
■ Pain is not controlled by
measures above
■ You have multiple stings and
feel ill
■ It's 10 years since last tetanus
shot

not soak the area first)
■ Wash with soap and water,
cover with an anti-bacteria
ointment (e.g.: Bacitracin), and
use a bandage if it's in a dirt
