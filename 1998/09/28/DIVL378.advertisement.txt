When you have a physical
disability, people often assume
you have a mental one as well.
But Zach Hastings, horn with
spina bifida, is one sharp kid.
When Zach was only 6 months
old, he entered the Easter Seals
early intervention program
designed to give babies and infants
the best developmental start.
Now, as a second grader, Zach
works with an Easter Seals
physical therapist. He's learned
how to get dressed. Throw a
Erisbee. Put on his braces. Play
"Chopsticks." Clean his room.
And his reading level's way
above his peers! Now it seems
everything's within reach.
Giving ability a chance.
