# Voters divided in gubernatorial race

SACRAMENTO (AP) —After 16
years of Republican governors, is Califor
nia ready for a Democrat?
The polls would suggest yes: Democrat
Gray Davis is leading Republican Dan
Lungren in most voter surveys.
History would suggest no: Only three
Democrats have been elected governor in
this century, and in three recent guberna
torial races, the Democrat has been ahead
in September, only to lose on Election
Day.
At first glance, history appears to be
repeating itself this year.
Polls of likely voters found Davis lead
ing Lungren by 12 percentage points in
mid-August, falling to 9 points in early
September and to a 46-46 tie last week.
But the GOP trend for governor isn't as
stark as history suggests.
The governor's office has been in
Republican hands for 80 of the past 100
years.
But the state's voting history during the
first half of the century is all but irrelevant

because of California's rapid growth and
huge economic and demographic changes.
Since 1958, Republicans have held the
office for 24 years. Democrats for 16.
The only real pattern in recent years is
that when there is no incumbent running,
the race for governor has been close
enough to go either way.
Democrat Jerry Brown was elected in
1974 by a 2.9 percent margin, Republican
George Deukmejian won in 1982 by 1.2
percent, and Republican Pete Wilson won
in 1990 by 3.5 percent. By contrast, each
won re-election by landslide margins of 15
to 25 percent.
The Davis-Lungren race is following
that cliffhanger pattern, and for good rea
son: California is almost evenly divided
between the two major parties. Democrats
have an 11 percent edge in voter registra
tion, but Republican turnout and party
loyalty is traditionally higher.
As a result, California voters have
shown a strong tendency to divide power
between the two major parties, most fre

quently with Republican governors and
Democratic Legislatures.
Democrats have controlled both houses
of the Legislature for 37 of the past 40
years and have held the lieutenant gover
nor's office under Republican governors
for the past 16 years.
That pattern is too strong to ignore.
Democrats are strong favorites to retain
control of the Legislature for another two
years, and Democrat Cruz Bustamante has
a slight edge in the low-profile race for
lieutenant governor.
But political observers say party regis
tration is only one — and maybe not the
most important — factor in picking Cali
fornia's next governor.
The polls which say the race for gover
nor is getting closer also found that most
California voters feel the state is moving in
the right direction.
That means they will be more inclined
to vote in November for the candidate
who will stay the course rather than make
radical changes.
