Reno faints in church
WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Janet Reno
fainted during a church service Sunday and was taken to a
hospital, where she was reported in good condition.
Reno, 60, was expected to remain overnight for monitoring
in the coronary unit at Georgetown University Medical Cen
ter, said Paul Katz, the center's chief operating officer.
"This is just a fainting spell. Her condition is good," Katz
said, adding that Reno was joking and in good spirits.
Reno had a similar fainting spell while attending a confer
ence in Mexico City in November 1997. Doctors attributed
the fainting to exhaustion and dehydration.
Van Gogh exhibit begins Thursday
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vincent van Gogh killed him
self more than a century ago, a poor, insane Dutch artist who
at 37 had sold only one painting.

Now people the world over cannot get enough of him.
Today, van Gogh is among the world's most popular
artists. In fact, 72 paintings were lent to the National Gallery
of Art for an exhibit that opens this Thursday. The paintings
were lent to Washington because the Van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam is undergoing a long-needed expansion. Built in
1973 to accommodate 60,000 visitors a year, last year it had 1
million.
Thousands of Washingtonians ringed the gallery in August
when it began distributing free advance passes to "Van
Gogh's Van Goghs," and others bought out 2(X),(XX) more
advance tickets from a commercial agency that charged a
small handling fee.
