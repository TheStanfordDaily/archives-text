## Editorial ASSU calendar steps up 
### 
RA e-mail distribution needs
organization to stop flooding
and disgruntled residents

Resident assistants pride
themselves in being community
builders. Sadly, their job has often
been complicated and undermined by an
obligation to pass along to residents all the
news that's fit for e-mail. But not for long.
We hope that the new online calendar,
created by the ASSU in partnership with
the Office of the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs, will use technology to improve
the channels of disseminating campus
information, partly by shifting the primary
burden from RAs and creating an area on
the ASSU World Wide Web site where
students can view customized calendars.
The ASSU and its allies in the adminis
tration deserve commendation for making
progress where the Office of Residential
Education has failed.
Past and present RAs have explained
that their e-mail list has become a major
medium of campus advertising because of
its several convenient characteristics.
Posting a message on the list is almost
effortless, the delivery is practically
instantaneous, and information can be
sent to the entire residential system with
out focusing on a target audience.
As a result, an entirely predictable set
of problems tends to arise. The list is
flooded with messages from every imagin
able campus group (many of them posted
several times), including a number that
advertise events on extremely short
notice.
RAs who dutifully posted all the

announcements to dorm distribution lists
very soon found that their residents, who
were generally unhappy about being bom
barded with e-mail, got in the habit of
deleting anything the RAs sent, including
important in-house announcements. So
much for successful advertising.
When RAs complained about this inef
fective and burdensome system, the
response from Res Ed was at best disin
genuous. Afraid of having to screen e
mails, it refused to have anything to do
with controlling the RA distribution list,
besides setting it up in the first place.
Last year, the volume of e-mails
became so onerous that one generous RA
volunteered his time to compile them in a
user-friendly format. His colleagues were
thrilled, but Res Ed declined to take a hint
and commit any resources to resurrecting
such compilations this year.
Avoiding the appearance of censorship
is, no doubt, a comfortable position, espe
cially for an organization with Res Ed's
history of public relations disasters.
Unfortunately, such an approach is bla
tantly irresponsible toward the RAs. They
are left with two unappealing options.
RAs must either forward all outside mes
sage to residents and jeopardize other
aspects of their jobs, or they must assume
the censorship role that was avoided by
Res Ed.
Res Ed, the organization that selects,
trains and supports RAs, should have
offered them a hand in coping with their
cyberduties. It has consistently and irre
sponsibly refused to do so.
With a little luck and a lot of hard
work, the ASSU's new online calendar
can give the campus a more centralized
information distribution system and offer
RAs some relief where Res Ed has failed.
