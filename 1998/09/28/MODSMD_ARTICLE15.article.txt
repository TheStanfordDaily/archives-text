# APOLOGY
## 
### 
The headline and first two paragraphs
of the article in Friday's Daily headlined
"GSC sees pros, cons of new housing,"
were entirely misleading and inaccurate
in their coverage of the Wednesday
meeting of the council. The notion that
there were "cheers and jeers," or indeed
any discussion of housing at the meeting
was wholly based on an editorial error.

The meeting was not about housing.
Nor is the opening of the article in any
way an accurate reflection of what
Robert Rudnitsky said to our reporter.
Their conversation was restricted to
statements of fact, which were accurate
ly reported later in the article.
Casting the article in the light of the
housing situation, or casting Rudnitskv's

statements as critical of housing policy
was not justified in any way by the facts
or by those statements. For my part and
on behalf of my staff, I apologize both to
those who were misled and to those who
were misrepresented.
