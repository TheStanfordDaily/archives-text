# Campus Viewpoint
## David Huang Find your profs' hidden talents 
### 
Looking back
at the Sophomore
College brochure
that arrived in my mail
box so long ago, I see now
that the designers of the
program expected a lot to
happen in a mere two and

Three goals are listed on the first page:
"to facilitate the development of mentor
ing relationships between faculty and stu
dents; to provide a small-group introduc
tion to a particular field of study; and to
introduce students to academic resources
available to them at Stanford."
After completing my Sophomore Col
lege experience, I can say that those objec
tives were not only met but also surpassed.
When I arrived on campus for the pro
gram, I really had no idea what to expect.
My own personal hopes were high but
vaguely bounded. Subconsciously I asked
myself, "How much can really happen in
just two and a half weeks?"
The answer was much more than I
expected. I am not intending to spread
Stanford propaganda, but my experience
with Sophomore College was glowing
from the start. The one thing they don't

advertise in the brochure, which ultimate
ly proved most valuable to me, is the bond
you form with fellow classmates.
Immediately after we moved in, the
sophomore assistants rounded up the class
and threw an ice cream party. It was just
the first of many activities organized by
the SAs that established our community.
By the end of the program, many mem
bers of our class felt the tingling of melan
choly as our Sophomore College brethren
went their separate ways.
This connection was not limited to just
the students. Computer Science Professor
Eric Roberts, who taught my class,
became our class' mentor as well as a
member of our close-knit group.
Roberts' enthusiasm, combined with
his vast knowledge of computer science,
made time with him in and out of class fun
and worthwhile. He invited us to his house
for dinner and a movie, where he shared
his hidden talents with us.
Besides witnessing some amazing jug
gling skills, we were given a rare opportu
nity to see Roberts navigate a marble
through the depths of a Labyrinth game
using only his toes. It was an amazing
experience interacting with our professor
in such a relaxed setting.

In the classroom, my classmates and 1
received a fascinating introduction to a
number of fields within computer science.
In his course, "The Intellectual Excite
ment of Computer Science," Professor
Roberts presented material about conven
tional topics such as Turing machines and
the P = NP question.
Roberts also invited professors from
different areas of the department to
amaze and intrigue us with their research
on robotics and graphics.
As for Sophomore College's final goal
to introduce students to academic
resources available at Stanford, many who
hadn't yet discovered the dark corners of
Green Library or dug through the files at
the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter finally had an opportunity to do so.
Although I can only speak for myself, I
am happy to say that all my expectations
for Sophomore College were exceeded. It
was one of my best experiences at Stan
ford.
A bit of advice to all freshmen: Spend
more than 10 minutes on the application.
This program is too good to miss.

After his Sophomore College experience
David Huang remains undeclared.
