Sex has a place in history
In last Wednesday's column. Prof,
emeritus Ronald Hilton lists for us
some of the "signs of the times" symp
tomatic of the decline of American edu
cation.
Like a good number of the clergy in
the late 10th century, suspended
between fear and hope, we watch anx
iously at the turn of this millennium for
any possible hint of The End.
Professor Hilton has divined the
Daily's advertisements, and bemoans
the fact that "the Middle Ages, one of
the greatest periods of human history,"
is represented for this quarter only by
"History 100 A, the basic survey
course," and "History 11S: Sexual Per
version and Propriety in the Middle
Ages."
"Is this," he wonders, "a way of
attracting students through sensational
ism ... or does it express correct politi
cal thinking by ignoring Christianity"?
A little lesson is in order, from the
instructor who teaches the "basic survey
course." This course includes, among
other things, an emphasis on reading
primary sources in depth.

First, one never evaluates a text with
out looking at it in full. The term "Pro
priety" refers to Christian asceticism,
one of the defining traits of the identity
of many Christian groups in Late Antiq
uity and the Middle Ages. Perversions
are what the Church sought to control,
or what various factions in the Church
used to carry factional struggle. I am
sure Christianity won't be ignored in
this course.
Surely a field like sexuality, so critical
to Medieval culture, is a good vector for
the study of the Middle Ages. I have
myself used it at some times (History
211), at other times warfare (History
15S) or rituals to examine this period
(History 210).
I suggest perusing the syllabus and
the Stanford Bulletin.
The former Professor of Geography
may not remember the great Mediter
ranean world, dominated by Islam,
which shaped the Christian Middle
Ages. How about History 209 A: "Law,
Society, and Identity in Christianity and
Islam, 500-1500," taught by Professor
Miller?
