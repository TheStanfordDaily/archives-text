## Cardinal can't Duck out of embarrassing loss Stanford's record drops to 1-3 after defense gives up most points in a game since 1954 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore.— The fog lifted slowly above Eugene
on Saturday morning, but by gametime the sun had risen
once more to reveal a beautiful day for football. Beauti
lul, that is, if you were not a member of the Stanford de
tense, around whom the fog did not lift until several
hours later.
Coming into Saturday's contest, Stanford knew it
would have to slow down Oregon quarterback Akili
Smith and the explosive Duck offense that had averaged
over 46 points and 500 yards of total offense per game in
the Ducks' three wins against San Jose State, Michigan
State, and UTEP.

■ Saturday's Result: Oregon 63, Stanford 28

Those averages were about to go up, however, as
Stanford (1-3 overall, 0-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
dropped to the Ducks (4-0,1 -0), 63-28, allowing the most
points by a Cardinal opponent since 1954.
The first of the Cardinal's few victories on the day
came on the coin toss, but Stanford deferred, allowing
Oregon to receive the ball. After an incomplete pass to
split end Damon Griffin, the Ducks promptly marched
66 yards in four plays, scoring on a 37-yard bullet from
Smith to Griffin over freshman cornerback Brian Tay
lor. The first true freshman to start under Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham, Taylor let Griffin behind him
on a deep post. The play would reappear periodically
throughout the game.
The Cardinal's misfortune continued on the next
play, when Oregon's Michael Fletcher streaked in on the
kickoff, jarring the ball loose from Stanford sophomore
returner Coy Wire. Cornerback Rashad Bauman recov
ered for Oregon and after the first of many Smith com
pletions to tight end Jed Weaver, tailback Derien La
timer took a pitch sweep into the end zone.
Oregon had taken a 14-point lead before the Stanford
offense had even taken a snap.
"You can't have the first turnover," Willingham said.
"It just sort of added fuel to the fire."
Junior quarterback Todd Husak and the Cardinal of
fense rallied a decent drive, but fell short on fourth and
eight, at the Duck 34-yard line, as a screen pass to wide
out Dave Davis fell short of the first down.
Oregon wasted no time, going 63 yards in four plays
to increase its lead to three touchdowns by the end of the
first quarter.

Pinned deep in their own territory, the Ducks went 88
yards in eigh plays, the lion's share of which came on one
of the most spectacularly blown coverages of the day. On
third and 14, Smith found flanker Donald Haynes wide
open on a deep cross, after which he was eventually
chased down by the Stanford secondary. On the goal
line, tailback Kevin Parker bounced off a white jersey,
spun left and found himself in the end zone.
After a Nathan Villegas extra point gave the Ducks a
four-touchdown lead, Husak went 4-of-6 on a 65-yard
drive that culminated in fullback Maxwell Stevenson's
second touchdown of the season. The points were the
first Oregon had allowed in the first half at home this sea
son.
The next drive was not so much a heartbreaker, as it
had already been made abundantly clear which way the
football winds would blow that day, but more of an ex
clamation point, a microcosm of the entire game.
After some more ruthlessly efficient Duck advances.
Smith found Griffin covered by Taylor on a quick slant.
Undeterred, Smith fired high and the ball slipped off
Griffin's fingers. It appeared for a moment that while
turning around, Taylor might intercept the ball. In the
consensus play of the day, the ball was tipped twice and
finally settled in Griffin's hands as Taylor fell by the way
side. Griffin fought off a lunging Tank Williams, coming
over from the far side, and stumbled into the end zone
for a potentially backbreaking score.
To Stanford's credit, what might have caused anoth
er team to crumble inspired instead the Cardinal's best
play of the afternoon.
Husak came out firing, and hooked up with junior
wide receiver Deßonnie Pitts three times for 68 yards,
the last 23 of which brought Stanford within 21 points.
The Cardinal defense stood up as well, stuffing Ore
gon on third and seven, bringing up fourth down and a
Josh Bidwell punt. Bidwell took a high snap only to find
junior fullback Emory Brock crashing through the line
and stuffing the punt.
The block was the first in the four-year career of Bid
well, a preseason All-Pac-10 selection.
Brock recovered the ball at the Oregon 10-yard line,
and when Husak promptly found Davis in the end zone
on a slant, it seemed that Stanford might have a chance
to get back into the game.
Down 35-21 with 1:38 left in the half, the Cardinal
would get a chance to pull within one touchdown when
they received to start the second half.
Of course, that would require Stanford's defense to
stop the Ducks.
The Ducks took but four plays to go 54 yards in 40

seconds, squashing any thoughts of a
Stanford comeback. In the midst of
what Stanford defensive coordina
tor Bill Harris called an "All-Amer
ican day,"
Weaver hauled in a 29-yard post
pattern from Smith and dragged in
two Cardinal defenders to effective
ly put the game out of reach at half
time.

"It could have been [a pivotal
point.]" Willingham said. "When
you close to that margin, you've got
to make plays."
On defense, Stanford couldn't
get any pressure on Smith, and the
Heisman candidate was allowed to
check off one, two, three, and even
four receivers. Even when flushed
out of the pocket. Smith was finding
open receivers, often deep and near
the endzone.
"Even when we had some pres
sure, it wasn't enough," Harris said.

Given the fact that Oregon tail
back Reuben Droughns was averag
ing just under 10 yards per carry, it's
no surprise that the Oregon play ac
tion was devastating, pulling Cardi
nal linebackers out of their hook /
curl zones and freeing up Jed
Weaver down the seams for long
gains.
The surprise is that 28 points is a
good performance for an offense
that struggled against Arizona and
San Jose State, particularly consid
ering Oregon's speed on the other
