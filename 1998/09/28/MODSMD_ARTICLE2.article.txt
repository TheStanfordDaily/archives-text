# Graduate students receive fee refund
## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
In response to numerous stu
dent complaints, Residential Com
puting is refunding the $45 in-room
connection fee that was paid by
graduate students who moved in
after June 1.
These students, along with re
turning on-campus residents, will
be charged the new $80 annual user
fee, which came into effect this fall.
In previous years, students paid
a one-time $45 fee to activate the
connection, used to connect to e
mail and the Internet. If the stu
dent did not move, no other addi
tional fees would have to be paid.
Last year this activation charge
became an annual $45 user fee,
which was increased to $80 this fall.
Many graduate students were
still under the impression that
would not have to pay the fee every
year. Also, residents who moved in
during the spring and summer were
charged the full $45 annual user
fee, rather than a prorated amount.

The policy change has angered
some graduate students, who un
like undergraduates, are allowed
to keep the same residence for
more than a year. Others are upset
that they were charged the full
amount for less than a year's use.
"Although the $45 refund is a
good gesture, it still does not com
pare with the new fee that I will
have to pay over the next two
years," said medical student Juan
Carlos Rodriguez.
Jeff Merriman, director of Resi
dential Computing, called the orig
inal $45 agreement "non-binding."
About 1,200 students with an
ethernet connection received an e
mail in early September informing
them that they would have to pay
$80 by Oct. 15 to keep their con
nection.
"What we meant was to charge
the students [who moved in this
summer] the $80 fee," said Merri
man.
The refund, which will show up
as a credit on winter bills, will be
given to 250 to 300 students who
paid the activation fee after June 1,
Students who will receive the re
fund were notified via e-mail.
Chris Kim, a third-year doctoral
student in geological and environ
mental science, said that he initially
received no response to his com
plaints. He said he then spoke with
Jamey Frank, assistant director of
Res Comp, who denied his request
for a refund.
Frank said that a meeting was
held on Tuesday to correct the
problem. "We realized we just
made a mistake," said I tank. "We
said, 'Let's just fix this because peo
ple are unhappy and we didn't give
them enough notice.' "
After Kim contacted the legal
counseling office and showed the
administrator several student com
plaints, Res Comp announced it
would be offering a refund.
Merriman explained that the
two events were unrelated, and he

explained that Res Comp made the
decision to refund the fee prior to
speaking with the legal counseling
office.
"Student complaints indicated
there was a serious problem in
communication or lack thereof,"
said Merriman. "In all fairness, it
was the right thing to do."
"I was impressed with how
swiftly Res Comp reconciled the
issue — they acknowledged our
concerns and provided a reason
able solution," said Debbie
Stephens, a graduate student in ed
ucation. She also praised Kim for
taking action and sharing the re
sults with other students.
Money from the price increase
will be used to maintain, replace
and upgrade hardware throughout
the system.
"I understand the reasons for
the new fee hike and the change to
an annual fee, but I feel that this
new service agreement should
apply only to the new residents who
moved in this fall, given that they
never were presented with the for
mer agreement," said Rodriguez.
