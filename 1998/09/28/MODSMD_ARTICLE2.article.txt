In response to numerous stu
dent complaints, Residential Com
puting is refunding the $45 in-room
connection fee that was paid by
graduate students who moved in
after June 1.
These students, along with re
turning on-campus residents, will
be charged the new $80 annual user
fee, which came into effect this fall.
In previous years, students paid
a one-time $45 fee to activate the
connection, used to connect to e
mail and the Internet. If the stu
dent did not move, no other addi
tional fees would have to be paid.
Last year this activation charge
became an annual $45 user fee,
which was increased to $80 this fall.
Many graduate students were
still under the impression that
would not have to pay the fee every
year. Also, residents who moved in
during the spring and summer were
charged the full $45 annual user
fee, rather than a prorated amount.

The policy change has angered
some graduate students, who un

to keep the same residence for
more than a year. Others are upset
that they were charged the full
amount for less than a year's use.
"Although the $45 refund is a
good gesture, it still does not com
pare with the new fee that I will
have to pay over the next two
years," said medical student Juan
Carlos Rodriguez.
Jeff Merriman, director of Resi
dential Computing, called the orig
inal $45 agreement "non-binding."
About 1,200 students with an
ethernet connection received an e
mail in early September informing
them that they would have to pay
$80 by Oct. 15 to keep their con
nection.
"What we meant was to charge
the students [who moved in this
summer] the $80 fee," said Merri
man.
The refund, which will show up
as a credit on winter bills, will be
