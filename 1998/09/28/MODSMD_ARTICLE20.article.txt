## Volleyball wins seventh straight match 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
For the Arizona and Arizona
State women's volleyball teams, the
Stanford Cardinal is becoming as
predictably oppressive as the desert
sun.
Over the weekend, the red-hot
Cardinal continued its domination
of both schools, burning both and
picking up its first conference road
wins of the season.
Stanford (8-2,4-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) extended its winning streak
to seven matches with a pair of con
vincing four-game victories.

■ Friday's Result: Stanford defeated
Arizona, 15-9,15-12,13-15,15-7.

■ Sunday's Result: Stanford defeat
ed Arizona State, 15-7, 14-16, 15-6
15-6.

On Friday night, at the McKale
Center in Tucson, the Cardinal
handed Arizona (11-1, 3-1) its first
loss of the season, 15-9,15-12,13-15,
15-7.
Stanford set the tone for the
match in the first game, making it
clear that its young and quickly ma
turing team was ready to answer any
challenges through solid strategy
and late-game surges. Following the
insertion of freshman middle block
er Tara Conrad, with Stanford trail
ing 9-6 in the first game, the Cardi
nal rolled off nine consecutive
points to wrap up the first game.
Stanford, the No. 1-ranked
blocking team in the nation, contin
ued its dominance at the net, out
blocking Arizona 19-8 for the
match. The Cardinal was led by
sophomore middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer who posted team-high to
tals of 10 blocks and 15 kills
The Wildcats' only returning

starter from a season ago, junior
outside hitter Raelene Elam,
proved to be an effective team
leader, finishing with a career-best
20 kills. One younger teammate
who followed Elam's lead was fresh
man Dana Burkholder, who added
Arizona season bests in assists (59),
and digs (23).
The Stanford win marked its
ninth consecutive victory over the
Wildcats.
On Sunday afternoon, Stanford
headed into Wells Fargo Arena to
face an Arizona State squad that
was coming off a victory over Cal
and looking to gain more confidence
about its ability to compete in the
Pac-10, arguably the hardest confer
ence in America.
"We definitely had the confi
dence to beat [Stanford]," said ASU
head coach Patti Snyder-Park. "We
are past the stage where we just
want to be respectable when we
play. We feel that we can win any
game we play."
ASU junior Jami Peck added
that after their win over Cal, she felt
the Sun Devils were ready to take
the next step toward big-time suc
cess.
"The [Cal| game was a fantastic
team effort. The blocking improved
dramatically and 1 think this win
brought us a great amount of confi
dence going into the rest of our con
ference schedule."
However, Stanford showed the
Sun Devils that you need more than
confidence to succeed in the Pac-10,
displaying great team depth and tal
ent en route to a 15-7, 14-16, 15-6,
15-6 victory.
The Cardinal excelled behind
several impressive individual per
formances. Freshman middle block
er Sara Sandrick finished with 16
kills (16-2-32, .438 hitting percent
age), while All-American Kerri
Walsh added a typically dazzling 14-
kill performance.
Detmer continued her emer
gence as one of the conference's
premier players, capping off a great
weekend with 13 kills, eight block
assists and one block solo at Ari
zona State. The sophomore carried
the momentum from the best series
of her career, just a week ago, which
earned her Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors.
Sophomore setter Robyn Lewis
solidified her position as an every
day starter with seven kills, 47 as
sists, nine digs, and three block as
sists.
After Stanford won the first
game with relative ease, Arizona
State rallied to take the second
game 16-14, marking the first time
that the Sun Devils have won a
game from defending national
champions.
To go with this moral victory,

ASU enjoyed a couple encouraging
individual matches. Sophomore
outside hitter Amanda Burbridge
led the Sun Devils with a career high
23 kills, while junior setter Jolynn
Faatulu contributed 59 assists.
However, Arizona State did not
come into the Stanford match look
ing to win just a single game and
take solace in the performance of a
pair of individuals.
"We are not satisfied with the
way we played," Snyder said. "We
faded physically, and we were out
hustled. Those are two things you
can't do if you expect to win in the
Pac-10."
Following Sunday's match, Sny
der was clearly still searching for the
elusive recipe for perennial success in
the Pac-10. However, the Cardinal
proved that she and her Sun Devil
squad needed to look no further than
the other side of the net on Sunday.
For, after another successful
weekend in the desert, it appears
that this season, just like so many in
the past, Stanford is heating up and
preparing for a run at yet another
conference title.
