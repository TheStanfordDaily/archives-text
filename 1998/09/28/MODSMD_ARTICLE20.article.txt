### Will Flemming Staff writer 
For the Arizona and Arizona
State women's volleyball teams, the
Stanford Cardinal is becoming as
predictably oppressive as the desert
sun.
Over the weekend, the red-hot
Cardinal continued its domination
of both schools, burning both and
picking up its first conference road
wins of the season.
Stanford (8-2,4-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) extended its winning streak
to seven matches with a pair of con
vincing four-game victories.

On Friday night, at the McKale
Center in Tucson, the Cardinal
handed Arizona (11-1, 3-1) its first
loss of the season, 15-9,15-12,13-15,
15-7.
Stanford set the tone for the
match in the first game, making it
clear that its young and quickly ma
turing team was ready to answer any
challenges through solid strategy
and late-game surges. Following the
insertion of freshman middle block
er Tara Conrad, with Stanford trail
ing 9-6 in the first game, the Cardi
nal rolled off nine consecutive
points to wrap up the first game.
Stanford, the No. 1-ranked
blocking team in the nation, contin
ued its dominance at the net, out
blocking Arizona 19-8 for the
match. The Cardinal was led by
sophomore middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer who posted team-high to
tals of 10 blocks and 15 kills
The Wildcats' only returning

starter from a season ago, junior
outside hitter Raelene Elam,
proved to be an effective team
leader, finishing with a career-best
20 kills. One younger teammate
who followed Elam's lead was fresh
man Dana Burkholder, who added
Arizona season bests in assists (59),
and digs (23).
The Stanford win marked its
ninth consecutive victory over the
Wildcats.
On Sunday afternoon, Stanford
headed into Wells Fargo Arena to
face an Arizona State squad that
was coming off a victory over Cal
and looking to gain more confidence
about its ability to compete in the
Pac-10, arguably the hardest confer
ence in America.
"We definitely had the confi
dence to beat [Stanford]," said ASU
head coach Patti Snyder-Park. "We
are past the stage where we just
want to be respectable when we
play. We feel that we can win any
game we play."
ASU junior Jami Peck added
that after their win over Cal, she felt
the Sun Devils were ready to take
the next step toward big-time suc
cess.
"The [Cal| game was a fantastic
team effort. The blocking improved
dramatically and 1 think this win
brought us a great amount of confi
dence going into the rest of our con
ference schedule."
However, Stanford showed the
Sun Devils that you need more than
confidence to succeed in the Pac-10,
displaying great team depth and tal
ent en route to a 15-7, 14-16, 15-6,
15-6 victory.
The Cardinal excelled behind
several impressive individual per
formances. Freshman middle block
er Sara Sandrick finished with 16
kills (16-2-32, .438 hitting percent
