■ Sunday's Result: Stanford 0, Santa Clara 0

With an intense rivalry due to the physical
proximity of the two schools, Santa Clara has not
lost to Stanford in three seasons.
Swanson and Stanford goalie Carly Smolak, as
well as senior mid-fielder Tracye Lawyer all
agreed that the key to Stanford's play involved
maintaining the Cardinal's style despite the ag
gressiveness and three-forward formation of the
Broncos.
Stanford players expected a very physical game
and they got it. Sunday's ()-() tie was marked by the
aggressive play of both the Cardinal and Broncos.
According to Lawyer. Stanford spent the first
"20 minutes feeling things out." Reacting defen
sively to the Broncos' aggressiveness, the Cardinal
eventually outshot the Broncos 5-3 in the first half.
A rejuvenated Bronco squad returned for the
second half. Up-and-down action dominated the
half; both teams had threatening chances, yet
failed to capitalize on these opportunities.
Santa Clara opened up the second half with
three failed shots and followed these chances up
with a corner kick.
Perhaps Stanford had the most promising scor
ing possibility when, to the delight of boisterous
Stanford fans, referees ejected Santa Clara's Lisa
Nancz with a red card. Despite having a one-play
er advantage, however, the Cardinal could not
cash in on the opportunity.
The defense proved pivotal in the two 15-
minute overtime quarters because of the numer
ous shot opportunities from both teams.
Swanson singled out the defensive efforts of
Smolak and the back tour.

"Carly gave a great effort and
gives confidence to the entire team,"
she said. "The back four has been
consistent and playing well all sea
son."
Aware of the Broncos' reputation
and skills, a tie was taken bv some

members of the team as a positive in
dication of the Cardinal's progress in
its quest to attain a berth to the
NCAA tournament this season..
"A tie is really good. To tie this
team ... is a great step for us,"
Lawyer said.
Although "pleased with a tie,"
Swanson, however, believes that "the
team can do better" in its upcoming
matches.
