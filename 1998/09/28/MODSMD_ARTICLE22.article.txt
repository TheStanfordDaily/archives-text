MEN'S WATER POLO

â–  Sunday's Result: Stanford 14
Long Beach State 6.

Sunday's game was the second
meeting of the season between the
Cardinal and the 49ers. Stanford had
come back from a 6-5 deficit to de
feat Long Beach State, 10-6, at the
Southern California Tournament
earlier this year.
"We had a tough time with them
at the So Cal Tournament," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "But
we came back and opened it up with
our offense in the last quarter."
The Cardinal wasn't about to give
Long Beach a lead in the second
meeting between the teams. The
Stanford offense tallied nine points
in the first half. The defense, lead by
senior goalie Chris Aguilera, held

the 49ers scoreless until midway
through the third quarter when
Long Beach State's Corey Dolley
scored on a four-meter penalty shot.
Less than 30 seconds later, Stan
ford senior David Hay was kicked
out of the game for misconduct and
Long Beach scored on another four
meter. Dolley scored again with 1:46
left in the quarter to outscore Stan
ford 3-1 in the third quarter of play.
"When you get a lead, you relax
and don't play as well," Dettamanti
said. "We gave [Long Beach] some
penalty shots and that got them back
into the game."
The 49ers scored first in the final
quarter, hut Stanford answered back
with a quick goal from sophomore
Pasi Dutton. Within seconds of scor
ing, however, Dutton received his
third penalty and was kicked out of
the game.
Despite the losses of both Hay
and Dutton, Stanford managed to
outscore the 49ers 4-3, coming away
with the 14-6 victory.
"We had two guys foul out and
we had a few guys who were sick, so
that left us a little short-handed to
wards the end," Dettamanti said.
"But the guys are in shape and they
handled it well."

The Stanford squad has been pol
ishing its counter-attack and the
team's performance on Sunday
demonstrated the depth of its talent
ed offense.
"We have really good team speed
and we weren't taking advantage of
that before," Dettamanti said.
"We've been working on the fast
break and it really opened up our
game."
One of the keys to Stanford's suc
cess was the ability of every member
of the team to capitalize on scoring
opportunities. Eight members of
the Stanford squad contributed
goals in Sunday's game.
"We had really balanced scoring
and everybody got to play," Detta
manti said.
Junior captain Brian Heifferon
led the team in scoring with four
goals and currently leads the team
with 18 points. Hay scored a two
pointer before leaving the game. Se
nior Arturo Rodelo and sophomore
Pasi Dutton each scored twice. Se
nior Jeremiah Robison, juniors Sean
Joy and Andy Walburger and
sophomore Todd Snider also scored.

Stanford stayed afloat, yesterday, rising above Long Beach State to avenge its loss earlier in the season.
emphasized the fact that it is the in
credible talent and depth of the
team that really makes the Stanford
program a powerhouse in collegiate
water polo.
"Our team is super talented,"
Heifferon said. "Everyone can suit
up and contribute ... everyone can
score. It's a total team effort."
Not only does Stanford have the
ability to rack up the points, but the
Cardinal defense performed well by
limiting its opponent's scoring op
portunities.
"Defense is what leads the of
fense," Heifferon said. "Winning
isn't a matter of scoring goals, but
playing defense. It's easy to beat any

team if you have really solid de
fense."
Aguilera headed up the Stanford
defense, making six saves in the first
three quarters against Long Beach
State. Sophomore goalie Arik
Goodman made one save when he
took over the cage in the fourth
quarter.
Stanford, ranked fourth after last
weekend's So Cal Tournament, will
spend the week getting ready to host
next Sunday's "Big Splash" match
with Cal, which is currently ranked
third.
"I think we're better than any
team in the top five," Heifferon said.
"We just need to get ready for each
team. We're going to study the films
and see what we can do. With
enough time to study, you can beat
anyone."
