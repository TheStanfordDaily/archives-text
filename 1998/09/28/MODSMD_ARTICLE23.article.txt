# Stanford silences Dons
## Ends six-year losing streak to San Francisco 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Friday night men's soccer game
was promoted as "Back to School
Night" in an effort to encourage fans
to attend Stanford's match against
the University of San Francisco. The
match, however, could easily have
been given the same slogan due to
the Cardinal's teaching the Dons a
lesson or two.

MEN'S SOCCER

â–  Friday's Result: Stanford 2, San
Francisco 0.

Stanford (5-2) defeated USF (0-
7), 2-0, giving the Cardinal its first
victory over the Dons since 1991 and
extending USF's losing streak to
nine games.
Even though the Dons have
struggled of late, Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark stressed the
threat USF posed as a team waiting
to break out of a slump.
"When you play a good team on a

losing streak, it is hard. You are
scared that they will start winning on
you," Clark said. "But our point of
view was great."
Despite USF's poor record this
season, the Dons had beaten Stan
ford in their past six seasons, stealing
the last two years' games late in the
second half.
This year, however, Stanford did
not let itself get caught off guard by
the struggling Dons.
The first half was played mostly in
the midfield with neither team dom
inating the match. Stanford came
close to scoring midway through the
half as senior Shan Gaw took a direct
kick and rang the shot off the cross
bar of the goal. The Cardinal was un
able to convert, though, until late in
the half.
As the game wore on, Stanford
started threatening and increased
the offensive pressure until it finally
scored with 15 minutes left in the
half.
The play was crafted off an indi
rect kick. Gaw faked the kick and

ran past the ball as senior Simon El
liott passed the ball to a sprinting
Gaw. Quickly, Gaw powered a shot
that was saved by USF's goalie, but
deflected into a crowd of Stanford
players.
Senior Jamie Clark controlled
the rebound and put the ball in for
the game-winner.
With under two minutes left in
the half, it was again Jamie Clark
who came up with a huge play. The
defender chased down an open Don
sprinting down the right side, knock
ing the ball away with a beautiful
slide tackle and saving what would
have been a wide-open USF shot.
Sophomore forward Corey
Woolfolk provided insurance foi the
Cardinal with a goal 15 minutes into
the second half.
Woolfolk used his speed to sprint
up the left side. He settled a pass
from Gaw, dribbled around his de
fender, drew the goalie to come out
and tapped a simple pass around him
