# Introductory seminars hit peak success

"Have you thought lately about
how you think?"
This year in the Freshman and
Sophomore Seminars Program,
every freshman and most sopho
mores have the opportunity to ad
dress questions such as this one
taken from the freshman seminar
Mechanical Engineering 121N,
"Problem Solving and Creativity"
taught by Prof. James Adams.
The Introductory Seminars Pro
gram is offering 224 seminars this
year, the most since its creation in
1992 as the Sophomore Dialogues
and Seminars Program.
According to program director
Todd Benson, this year also marks
the first time in the program's histo
ry that it can accommodate the en
tire freshman class. In addition, the
program has expanded to ensure
that all of these students will be able
to take either a sophomore dialogue
or seminar or participate in sopho
more college next year.
Hans Gumbrecht, a professor of
both Comparative Literature and
French and Italian, is teaching Com
parative Literature 115Q, "Thinking
the Present: 20th-century European
Philosophy," a sophomore dialogue
limited to five people. He said that
it's important that future lawyers
and engineers be exposed to things
that they normally wouldn't, such as
the humanities, and that these semi
nars give them the perfect chance to
do so.
Freshman Daniel Sinton, a
prospective geology major, is taking

Biology 24N, "The Brain." It was not
only the course description that ap
pealed to Sinton but the fact that he
would get to know a faculty member
as a freshman.
"There's a small amount of peo
ple in the class," he said. "It makes it
more personal." He plans to apply to
seminars next quarter as well.
"The idea is to allow all students
to experience the chance to work
closely with a faculty member, and
to explore particular areas of study,
in a small-group setting," Benson
said.
Although the programs for fresh
man and sophomores are both cen
trally coordinated by the program
office, the two are run somewhat dif
ferently. The freshman seminars are
offered directly by each department
in exchange for funding or a new fac
ulty billet from the provost. Sopho
more seminars and dialogues are
taught voluntarily by individual fac
ulty members as an addition to their
normal class load. Although the
teachers are compensated for their
time, many do it solely from their de
sire to teach.
Gumbrecht said that working
with younger people is very produc
tive for him, for they bring new per
spectives to discussion that upper
classmen and graduate students ne
glect. "It's more interesting for me.
They read texts in ways that I didn't
think about," said Gumbrecht. "A
brilliant freshman in a philosophical
discussion is better than a laborious
grad student."
Sophomore seminars and dia
logues have increased by almost 4(H)
percent since 1993. The fact that the

number of faculty interested in
teaching the courses regardless of
the addition to their regular teaching
load is "a testament to how commit
ted Stanford faculty members are to
teaching," Benson said.
Although there are enough semi
nars for every freshman and sopho
more this year, there are no guaran
tees that each will get the ones they
want. Sinton was one of the lucky 16
to be granted admission out of the
2(X) that applied to his seminar.
Ellen Woods, the assistant vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion, said that students may still not
getting into the seminars they most
want. However, she added, "For
everyone who wants to take a semi
nar, there is one." Those students
who are not placed in their top
choice may take any of the seminars
that still have room.
The program tries to accommo
date students who have not had the
chance to take a sophomore semi
nar. Faculty giving courses in the
winter and spring are asked to give
priority to students who have not
previously participated in an intro
ductory seminar or Sophomore Col
lege.
Julia Adler-Milstein, a sopho
more who applied for a seminar,
knows she will probably not be ad
mitted. "I don't think I'll get in be
cause I did Sophomore College," she
said.
The program office realized the
importance of the introductory sem
inars in undergraduate education in
part from student feedback. The re
sponse was so positive to the cre
ation of the freshman seminar pro

gram last year that they increased
the course offerings this year . "Re
search has shown that the develop
ment of these facultyâ€”student men
toring relationships is one of the best
ways of promoting student success
during college, and [this program] is
designed in part to accomplish this,"
Benson said.
"The goal [of the seminars] is to
personalize freshman year," Woods
said.
The office also tries to act as an

advising body for freshmen and
sophomores who have not yet de
elared a major and are not aware of
departmental resources. The Stan
ford Introductory Seminars Course
Catalog was sent to all freshmen and
sophomores with course descrip
tions, contact phone numbers, fre
quently asked questions and faculty
bios to make them aware of the re
sources the office provides and en
courage each freshman and sopho
more to enroll in a seminar.
