### Bruce Wang Staff writer 
After a successful first fall, the
Graduate Student Information
Center will close down, as sched
uled. this Friday.
Located on the second floor of
Tresidder Memorial Union, the
center opened on Aug. 31 to help
graduate students prepare for the
new school year.
The center provides general in
formation about administrative
and academic issues and student
life, as well as telephones for free
local calls and a voice mail service.
Computers connected to Axess and
the Web are also available, plus
campus maps, a message board and
pamphlets on University and com
munity resources.

"The Graduate Student Infor
mation Center resulted from dis
cussions with graduate students
this summer regarding housing is
sues," said Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya.
The center was originally set up
to provide housing information to
new students. Other key help areas
were later identified, however,
such as banking, registration and
telephone services.
According to physics doctoral
student Harris Shapiro, a member
of the center's planning board, the
center had a group of "very re
sourceful staff" who knew how to
get students the information they
needed.
Shapiro also said that the cen
ter's use increased during the first
few weeks of its opening.
"From the opening, the center has
been a valuable resource," said Mon
toya. He also said that students see
this as an effort on the part of the
University to assist the students in
getting adjusted in to the community.
The center was in close commu
nication with the Housing Assign
ment Office to provide students
with information on housing. Stu
dents could read housing postings
using the center's computers and
use the phones to contact people.
"The center was used extensive

ly," said Montoya. A significant
amount of e-mail was also received
asking the center for information,
Montoya said.
Since the start of fall quarter, the
center has seen fewer visits. Al
though the center is closing thifc
week, its information hotline num
ber will still be available. Beginning
Oct. 5, these calls will be routed to
the Dean of Students Office, which
will serve as "a clearing house for
information to graduate students,"
said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"I hope we continue this model
for next year," said Montoya.
"Given the success of the center, I
am planning to have an informa
tion center on campus for the start
of next year."
