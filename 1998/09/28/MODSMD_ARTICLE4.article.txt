# ITSS labors to squash 2000 bug

The coming of the millennium may bring
the unexpected in a variety of arenas, but one
area that should remain safe is Stanford com
puters, thanks to Information Technology
Systems and Services' current efforts.
In order to minimize the millennium fall
out that is expected to plague computers
when the year 2000 rolls around, ITSS will
provide a program that students can either
pick up on a disk from ITSS or download
from the ITSS Web site. This program will be
able to detect whether a particular computer
will face a problem in 2000.
Even users of computers that run operat
ing systems that are year 2000-compatible,
such as Windows 95, Windows 98, or Macin
tosh, will need to download and run the soft
ware. Though their hardware and operating
systems might not be affected, individual
pieces of software or data files might have
year 2000 compatibility problems.
"The program will go through a series of
tests," said Gerald Weitz, Director of Infor
mation Systems Archives. "It would set the
clock to 11:59 on the last day of 1999 and let it

run. Then it would do the same thing on Feb.
28,2000 to make sure it would be okay during
a leap year."
If a problem is detected, the program will
allow the user to download another program
that would then clear the computer of any
bugs that might prove to be hindrances in
2000.
"There is another program in this software
package that identifies data files that have
dates in them," said Weitz. "Then the user has
to go into those data files and make the cor
rections."
The program to analyze data files will not
be site-licensed as the others will be, howev
er, as campus demand is predicted to be limit
ed.
This program, which ITSS has been work
ing on for several years, is about 65 percent
complete. It will be available from ITSS this
October or November, according to Weitz.
Although Weitz declined to comment on
how much ITSS spent to purchase the soft
ware, he did say that ITSS "got a good deal."
"It sounds like a good plan," said sopho
more Erin Schmidt. "It's something that I've
