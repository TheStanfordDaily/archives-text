Morris Graves, who became as
sociate dean of students on Sept. 1,
explained that "fate" first drew him
to Stanford in 1995.
Graves, who grew up in East Palo
Alto and has served as director of
the Black Community Services Cen
ter and later as interim director of
the Program in African and Afro-
American Studies, recounted that
his return to the Bay Area was un
likely one; he had initially tossed the

advertisement for the directorship
of the community center in the
waste basket.
"It was the end of the day, so I
took the ad out of the trash and said
that I would look at it again in the
morning when I was fresh." said
Graves. "So when I came in the next
morning and looked at it, I said to
myself that this job description was
written for me."
In his new position. Graves will
deal heavily with graduate student
issues.
"His primary responsibility will
be to supervise the Graduate Stu

dent Programming Board," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"I'm trying to enlarge that
group," Graves said. "I have solicit
ed representatives from all the com
munity centers, because I'd like to
make that board as a large and as
representative of the graduate com
munity as possible."
Graves also wants to include rep
resentatives of all ages, as well as
spouses and partners of graduate
students.
"The bulk of my time, at least this
first year, is going to be spent trying
to identify the problem areas and

develop solutions," he said.
He foresees the major issues fac
ing graduate students as the level of
stipends, teaching assistantships,
housing, social integration, knowing
people across disciplines and con
cerns about faculty advising.
Graves added that "there is no
sense in reinventing the wheel.
There may be services out there that
grad students don't know about. It
may be a matter of getting them in
formation."
Graves will also oversee student
