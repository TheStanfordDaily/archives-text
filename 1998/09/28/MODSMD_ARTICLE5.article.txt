Morris Graves, who became as
sociate dean of students on Sept. 1,
explained that "fate" first drew him
to Stanford in 1995.
Graves, who grew up in East Palo
Alto and has served as director of
the Black Community Services Cen
ter and later as interim director of
the Program in African and Afro-
American Studies, recounted that
his return to the Bay Area was un
likely one; he had initially tossed the

advertisement for the directorship
of the community center in the
waste basket.
"It was the end of the day, so I
took the ad out of the trash and said
that I would look at it again in the
morning when I was fresh." said
Graves. "So when I came in the next
morning and looked at it, I said to
myself that this job description was
written for me."
In his new position. Graves will
deal heavily with graduate student
issues.
"His primary responsibility will
be to supervise the Graduate Stu

dent Programming Board," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"I'm trying to enlarge that
group," Graves said. "I have solicit
ed representatives from all the com
munity centers, because I'd like to
make that board as a large and as
representative of the graduate com
munity as possible."
Graves also wants to include rep
resentatives of all ages, as well as
spouses and partners of graduate
students.
"The bulk of my time, at least this
first year, is going to be spent trying
to identify the problem areas and

develop solutions," he said.
He foresees the major issues fac
ing graduate students as the level of
stipends, teaching assistantships,
housing, social integration, knowing
people across disciplines and con
cerns about faculty advising.
Graves added that "there is no
sense in reinventing the wheel.
There may be services out there that
grad students don't know about. It
may be a matter of getting them in
formation."
Graves will also oversee student
activities, new student orientation,
the LGBCC, the Women's Center
and meeting services.
Senior Mike Martinez, former ju
nior class president and member of
the associate dean search commit
tee, feels that Graves has immense
promise in his new role.
"Students admire and respect
him for his past endeavors; faculty
support his strong ideals and ability
to handle many public and impor
tant matters of student concern,"
Martinez said.
Ciraves, who entered De Anza
College in 1968 and transferred to
Pitzer College in 1%9, credits his ac
tivism in his college years as sparking
his interest in the field of education.
"As 1 became more politically ac
tive and more conscious of social is
sues, 1 started to focus on education
and 1 started doing tutoring in a local
high school and later in the Clare
mont elementary schools," said
Ciraves.
Having entered college aiming to
be a corporate tax attorney, Graves

decided in the last week of his senior
year to turn down acceptances at
Stanford and Harvard Law Schools
and, instead, go into education.
"The Friday before I graduated, I
called Robert Atwell, the president
of Pitzer College. By then I knew I
wanted to go to grad school, but I
hadn't made applications to any
place but law school. I met with
Atwell and told him that I didn't
want to sit it out a year and asked if
there was anything he could do to
help," explained Graves. "He
arranged for me to meet with Mal
com Douglass of the Claremont
Graduate Schools. Based on
Atwell's recommendation they ac
cepted me and asked me to fill out an
application and take the GRE."
During his undergraduate years,
Graves, who was student body pres
ident, received his first exposure to
the field of student affairs. He noted
that during college he had been a
peer counselor, set up a tutorial pro
gram, served as an administrative as
sistant to the Black Studies program
and worked in the career planning
and placement office, financial aid
office and in student activities.
As a graduate student, Graves fo

cused on many of the interests he
had developed during college, earn
ing a masters' degree in comparative
government with a minor in educa
tion.
After teaching the Pomona pub
lic school system and at Cal State
Fullerton, Graves went to Texas
Southern in 1975.
"I had always wanted to teach at
a historically black college," he said.
From there he moved to the Uni
versity of Houston, where he served
in a number of capacities, including
student activities adviser and associ
ate director of the African-Ameri
can Studies department.
"In many ways I grew up in Hous
ton â€” I came into a great under
standing of the American political
process and the importance of high
er education in providing opportuni
ty for minorities while I was there,"
Graves said.
Graves had expected that he
would finish his career in Houston,
but for the East Palo Alto native,
Stanford's offer proved too good to
pass up.
"My mother had worked at Stan
ford Medical School for 27 years,"
he said. Graves explained that his

brothers convinced him "it was time
to come home" when he
Stanford's offer.
In his first year at Stanford.
Graves served as the director of the
BCSC and the assistant dean of stu
dents.
"He has definitely taken the
BCSC to new heights and added a
level of professionalism to the BCSC'
staff," said Michelle Fowles, a pro
gram associate for the center and a
member of the search committee
that chose Graves for the center's di
rectorship three years ago.
When, in the summer of 1996,
then-Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven asked Graves to
serve as interim director of Afro-
American Studies, he was loathe to
abandon his post at the BC S(

Morris Graves, new associate dean of students, is excited to take
over his new position.
rector of the Afro-American Stud
ies program. "He has the combina
tion of good judgment and people
skills that you would find in a good
administrator."
Graves emphasized that he was
not afraid to make tough decisions
as director of the BCSC, and he as
sures that he will do the same as
assoc. dean of students.
"I made a lot of changes and im
plemented a lot of policies that
some of the students in the black
community, particularly the lead
ership, did not agree with," he said.
"This job is going to be a highly
visible job, particularly in the area
of grad student concerns. I suspect
that there will be times when the
direction I move in will not neces
sarily be accepted by some seg
ments of the graduate student
community, and they may be very
vocal about it."
Graves feels, however, that he
is well prepared to address gradu
ate student issues by his years at
the BCSC. "The community cen
ters, including the BCSC, have
been far more successful in the so
cial integration of graduate stu
dents than the University as a
whole," he said.
One of Grave's proudest ac
complishments was the establish
ment of the "What Matters to Me
and Why" program, which origi
nally came out of the Black Grad
uate Student Association. The
program brings administrators
and professors to discuss their life
goals with students.
Wais has only words of praise
for his new assoc. dean.
"Morris emerged from a na
tional pool of 112 candidates,"
Wais said. "He has firmly estab
lished himself as a dynamic, effec
tive, approachable, goal-oriented
professional."
