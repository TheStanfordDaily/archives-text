# Hooyman remembered as community asset

Chris Hooyman, a Stanford student from Seattle and
the youngest person ever to stand atop the highest peak
in North America, was known to friends and family as
truly indomitable spirit.
"If you only met Chris for 15 minutes, you'd remem
ber him." said Marisha Banister, his close friend and for
mer roommate in Columbae. "What I heard most from
people who knew him was that even though they only
knew him for a short time, he changed the way they
looked at life. He was so full of energy and he lived life
with such passion."
Hooyman died last June on Mt. McKinley, the tallest
mountain in North America. He was guiding four
climbers down the mountain from the summit when a
blast of wind, estimated at 80 mph, knocked one of the
climbers down. Hooyman disconnected himself from the
rope to save the other climber, but he slid to his death.
In his memory, his family and friends have established
the Chris Hooyman Outdoor Education Fund. "We've

established the fund as a way to ex
tend his influenee is his love of the
outdoors," said his mother Nancy
Hooyman. "This charitable fund
will be used to support youth who
can t afford to experience the out
doors.
"We're also holding a memorial
climb up Mt. Rainier from June 4 to
6 to honor Chris as well as raise
money for the fund," continued
Hooyman. "The climb will be guid
ed so that you don't have to be an
expert climber to go along."
Further information about the
climb will be available from the
Northwest Mountain School at
(206) 634-3955 after Nov. 1.
"Chris just inspired people," said
Erick Matsen, Hooyman's close
friend and Stanford cycling team
mate. "What's important to remem
ber about him is how he lived his life.

He had so much fun, so much ener
gy, and was such a great guy to
know. He was always helping peo
ple"
Another of Hooyman's passions
was outdoor education. He was
planning to work for the Northwest
Mountain School, an institute that
educates teenagers about the out
doors and seeks to instill confidence
and self-esteem.
Hooyman also possessed excep
tional creativity. One of his inven
tions, the Hooyman Ice Axe, is in
the process of being patented. As a
unique combination of an ice axe
and a hammer, Hooyman's inven
tion offers climbers a better moun
taineering tool.
Constantly inventing things,
Hooyman was majoring in science,
technology and society, with a prod
uct design concentration.
"He would shop for classes like
nobody else. He'd have six classes at
11:00, and would go to each one for
a few minutes until he found the one

he liked the best," said Banister.
"Eventually, I started following him
around. He taught me to take the
classes that I would like the most.
He was the kind of person who
would take 20 units every quarter
and have a blast doing it."
Friends say he that he would
have majored in product design,
but he chose another major so that
he could finish in three years.
Characteristically, he wanted to
leave time for adventure. Hooy
man took last year off to trek
around the globe. Climbing moun
tains from Guatemala to France,
Hooyman never ran out of energy.
Later in the year, he received a
grant from the American Alpine
Institute to climb a previously un
conquered mountain in Alaska.
Bad weather forced him to spend
three weeks in a snow cave, but he
was unfazed.
Hooyman is survived by his par
ents, his sister, Mani and his brother,
Kevin.
