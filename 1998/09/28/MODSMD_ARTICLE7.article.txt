What were you doing this sum
mer? Traveling? Working? Or
lying on the beach? This summer,
nine Stanford students got to do a
little of all of those through the
LEV I Summer Human Rights and
International Law Internship.
On Aug. 5, the students met in
Geneva, Switzerland to attend the
50th session of the United Nations
Subcommission on the Prevention

of Discrimination and Protection
of Minorities.
LEV-I, which stands for Lift
Every Voice and Sing, Incorporat
ed, is a national organization dedi
cated to promoting awareness of
human rights. Founded in 1981, the
organization's name comes from a
song by the same name, written by
James Weldon Johnson during the
post-Civil War period.
Stanford's LEV-I chapter,
founded in 19%, focuses on human

rights awareness and education at
Stanford and in the surrounding
communities. The U.N. Summer
Internship Program provided the
opportunity for students to gain
hands-on experience on the United
Nations human rights system and
exposure to the field of internation
al law.
The subcommission, composed
of 26 human rights experts, officials
from U.N. member states and rep
resentatives of non-governmental

organizations, comes together
every August to discuss different
topics on current human rights is
sues and to receive briefings from
experts on specific case countries.
As accredited observers, the in
terns not only sat in on various
meetings, but were also able to in
teract with numerous attendees.
"We got to experience the real
U.N., not the guided tour," said
