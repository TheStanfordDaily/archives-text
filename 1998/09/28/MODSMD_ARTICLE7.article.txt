# Stanford students intern at United Nations
## 
### Jennifer Chien 
What were you doing this sum
mer? Traveling? Working? Or
lying on the beach? This summer,
nine Stanford students got to do a
little of all of those through the
LEV I Summer Human Rights and
International Law Internship.
On Aug. 5, the students met in
Geneva, Switzerland to attend the
50th session of the United Nations
Subcommission on the Prevention

of Discrimination and Protection
of Minorities.
LEV-I, which stands for Lift
Every Voice and Sing, Incorporat
ed, is a national organization dedi
cated to promoting awareness of
human rights. Founded in 1981, the
organization's name comes from a
song by the same name, written by
James Weldon Johnson during the
post-Civil War period.
Stanford's LEV-I chapter,
founded in 19%, focuses on human

rights awareness and education at
Stanford and in the surrounding
communities. The U.N. Summer
Internship Program provided the
opportunity for students to gain
hands-on experience on the United
Nations human rights system and
exposure to the field of internation
al law.
The subcommission, composed
of 26 human rights experts, officials
from U.N. member states and rep
resentatives of non-governmental

organizations, comes together
every August to discuss different
topics on current human rights is
sues and to receive briefings from
experts on specific case countries.
As accredited observers, the in
terns not only sat in on various
meetings, but were also able to in
teract with numerous attendees.
"We got to experience the real
U.N., not the guided tour," said
Anu Menon, a senior majoring in
anthropology and minoring in
Latin American Studies. "You got
to watch what really happens be
hind the scenes at the U.N.," she
added.
Assigned to choose individual
research projects, the nine Stanford
interns were joined by interns from
such other schools as UCLA and
Howard University. They spent a
busy two-and-a-half weeks gather
ing information in the U.N. library
and meeting with non-governmen
tal organization representatives
from such places as Papua New
Guinea, Tibet and Mauritania.
They also spoke with U.N. officials
and attended various meetings.
For her research project. Menon
chose the issue of impunity in Chile
and Burundi. While in Geneva, she
met with several representatives of
non-governmental organizations
regarding her topic.
"You get real stories from real
people, instead of just reading it in

a book." Menon said.
Nnenna Ozobia, a junior major
ing in international relations with a
minor in Spanish, decided to study
Afro-Mexicans for her research
project. At the U.N., she met with
the leaders of organizations such as
the Minorities Rights Group In
ternational and Espacio Afro-
Americano.
"I liked meeting the different
representatives," Ozobia said.
Though the representative from
Espacio Afro-Americano, Mer
cedes Moya, spoke primarily Span
ish, Ozobia learned a great deal
from her.
"There is so much that people
can shard, even if there is a lan
guage barrier, because good inten
tions aren't reflected in language,
they are reflected in actions," she
said.
Other research topics included
capital punishment, AIDS and its
effects on the global population
and reparations to African-Ameri
cans for the transatlantic slave
trade. Once completed, the re
search projects will be published by
the Centre for Human Rights Edu

cation and Advocacy.
Beyond the research project, the
internship involved spur-of-the
moment meetings with U.N. offi
cials and presentations by non-gov
ernmental organizations on a vari
ety of subjects, something Ozobia
enjoyed in particular.
"Some people get preoccupied
with their own general interests. It
was great because we got to be ex
posed to all these different human
rights issues going on in the world;
you could see through this how a lot
of this stuff is similar," said Ozobia.
Although the group thought that
at times the program was a little un
structured, Ozobia appreciated the
independence it allowed her.
"It was on yourself to make the
best out of the internship you
could," said Ozobia.
Outside of the U.N., the summer
interns were able to enjoy weekend
trips to the French Riviera, Paris,
and the French Alps. Menon also
has a positive evaluation of her in
ternship experience.
"Before I went, I had thought I
might want to work at the U.N., but I
wasn't sure. After having come back,

it's one of my goals," said Menon.
Other internship participants in
cluded Autumn Cooper, a senior
majoring in Human Biology; Lani
ta Foley, a Stanford graduate in In
ternational Relations from the
Class of '97; Tarana Harris, a junior
majoring in Political Science; Brian
Rikuda, a sophomore majoring in
Political Science and Economics;
Magda Ruiz, a senior majoring in
Political Science and Spanish; Miri
am Ticktin, a Stanford doctoral
candidate in Anthropology; and
Paola Blancarte, a senior majoring
in Economics and International
Relations.
The internship will not be of
fered next year due to other priori
ties, but the internship may be of
fered again in the following years.
The Stanford LEV-I chapter also
publishes a newsletter at Stanford
to educate the community on
human rights issues and violations
occurring throughout the world.
Other LEV-I activities include
an educational human rights pro
gram at nearby schools and spon
sorship of events that promote with
human rights awareness.
