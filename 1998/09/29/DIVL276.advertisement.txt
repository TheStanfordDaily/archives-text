Another Deloitte Consulting Difference
DELOITTE CONSULTING:
Relaxed Fit
Deloitte Consulting approaches its business differently. Here, walls are down; lines of communication
are fluid. The atmosphere is relaxed and confident, never arrogant. There is a commitment to
reasonable work hours and quality time spent away from the job. As well as a belief in strong working
relationships based upon mutual trust, shared goals and respect for individual points of view.
We're looking for top performers to participate in either our Systems Analyst or Business Analyst Program.
As a Systems Analyst at Deloitte Consulting, you will work with seasoned professionals on high-profile
assignments, as well as take part in technical and management consulting training courses offered
around the country. After training, you will hit the ground running — and take on meaningful
responsibilities and tackle significant business problems leveraging state-of-the-art technologies.
The Business Analyst Program is designed for individuals wishing to pursue an MBA from a top business
school. As part of a client engagement team, you'll develop both consulting and business competencies.
If you are intent on building your consulting career with a firm that puts mutual collaboration and
sustainable results ahead of hierarchies and individual agendas, relax. You'll fit in perfectly.
