# Row hit by computer burglaries
## 
### David Felman Contributing writer 
Within the past 10 days, three
laptop computers have been stolen
from houses on the Row. The per
petrators remain at large, and Stan
ford Police has few clues that could
lead to their arrests.
Last Monday, two laptops were
stolen from adjoining rooms in Du
rand House.
"Two men came in saying that
they were selling magazines," said
sophomore Lola Blackwell. whose
computer was stolen.
Sophomore Kate Chauncey, also
a resident in Durand, described the
man she saw as a black male with
glasses, about 6 feet 5 inches tall and
250 pounds with an "almost shaved
head."
A laptop was also stolen from a
resident's room in Grove Mavfield
House Sept. 19. According to Amar
Arora, Grove Mayfield resident as
sistant, the burglar could have sim
ply entered through the house's un
locked door.
"No one saw them come in or
out." Arora said. "We don't even
know what time they came in."
Blackwell is doubtful that the po
lice will be able to locate her com
puter or the computer of her neigh
bor, sophomore Kylene Keith. Stan
ford Police also doubt that they will
make any arrests in these cases.
Although the Stanford campus is
generally considered very safe, the
beginning of a new year is always a
vulnerable time for theft on campus.
"It tends to be easier for strangers to
enter a house and not to be recog
nized as strangers," said Dean of
Students Marc Wais.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul

Niemeyer hopes that students will
be aware of anyone who looks sus
picious in their residences.
"All of these thefts took place
during daytime hours. It could be
random people off the street,"
Niemeyer said. "It should be obvi
ous when someone does not belong,
if you take a look," Niemeyer
added.
Although computer theft is noth
ing new on campus, the numbers in
dicate that it is on the rise. Sixty-two
computers were stolen in 1997,59 in
1996,56 in 1995 and 31 in 1994.
Thirty-six have been stolen thus
far in 1995, and Niemeyer expects
that, for this calendar year, "we'll be
up in the 60s range again."
Stanford Police. Residential Ed
ucation and Residential Computing
are all suggesting that crimes like
these can be curtailed if students
keep their doors locked.
"The best safety measure a stu
dent can take is to close and lock his
or her door whenever the room is
vacant," said Jeff Merriman, direc
tor of Res Comp.
Similarly, Patricia Brandt, resi
dence dean for thâ€ž Row, said she
hopes "that students wiil keep their
doors locked."
Besides locking their doors, stu
dents may take other precautions to
safeguard their belongings. Merri
man suggests purchasing a security
system that may consist of a cable
and a locking plate, but warns to
check with Facilities Operations be
fore doing anything that might dam
age furniture.
The Stanford Bookstore carries
two types of computer locks, one
type for laptops that sells for $37.95,
