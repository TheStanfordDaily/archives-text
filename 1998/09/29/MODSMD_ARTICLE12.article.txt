# Tobacco industry accused of lying

### 
SEA ITLE (AP) — The tobacco industry lied to
the public for decades by denying the health risks of
smoking and that nicotine is addictive, an attorney said
Monday as Washington's lawsuit against cigarette
makers opened.
Paul Luvera, an attorney representing the state, told
jurors that internal tobacco company memos from the
1970s make it clear that the industry knew nicotine was
addictive, and that it purposely hid this information
from the public.
He quoted one: "We are in the business of selling
nicotine, an addictive drug."
He contrasted those documents with a video clip
from a 1994 congressional committee hearing, when

top industry executives said under oath that they
believed nicotine was not addictive.
The lawsuit accuses the tobacco industry of conspir
ing to violate antitrust and consumer-protection laws,
restraining and suppressing health research and
manipulating cigarette nicotine levels.
The state seeks the reimbursement of $2.2 billion in
Medicaid and other insurance costs. The state also
wants the industry to take steps to prevent minors from
obtaining cigarettes and end '"deceptive and unfair
advertising."
Three dozen other states have lawsuits pending
against the industry. Four states have reached settle
ments for a combined $36.8 billion.
