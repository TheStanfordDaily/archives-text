# Germans welcome liberals

BONN, Germany (AP) — Gerhard Schroeder,
Germany's designated new chancellor, approached the
environmental Green party today about joining his
Social Democrats in a coalition government after oust
ing Chancellor Helmut Kohl in sweeping vote for
change.
Such a coalition would be the most radical in post
war Germany and would test the Greens' ability to curb
their sometimes eccentric ideals to cooperate with a
more mainstream party.
In a stinging humiliation for the West's longest-serv
ing leader. Kohl and his Christian Democrats won just
35 percent of the vote, which translates to a loss of 49 of
the 294 seats they held in the old parliament.
" This is a hard evening for me, and for us all," Kohl
said, conceding defeat Sunday night. "1 wish Herr
Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time in
office."
Now it's up to Schroeder — whose Social
Democrats won 41 percent of the vote — to make good
on pledges to end unemployment, stuck above 10 per
cent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
With the Greens, who won 6.7 percent, a Social
Democratic-led government would command a 21-seat
majority in the new 669-seat parliament. "1 think 21

seats is enough of a majority to form a stable govern
ment," Schroeder told the national ZDF television net
work today. The Social Democrats held informal talks
overnight with the Greens.
A high-ranking Social Democrat, Wolf-Michael
Catenhusen, said today the party leadership was
expected to start coalition talks with the Greens on Fri
day.
The liberal Free Democrats won 6.2 percent of the
vote.
Around the world, politicians of the left welcomed
Gerhard Schroeder's election triumph, claiming the
result as fresh evidence that the political tide was run
ning their way.
"A new epoch is coming. Many countries have
become much more leftist in nature," said Russian
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
Schroeder reiterated he would not consider includ
ing in his government the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism, which won enough votes to stay
in parliament. Many in the West view the party as a
troubling remnant of the former communist East Ger
man state.
Kohl had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the
strength of his image of stability and clout with world
powers.
