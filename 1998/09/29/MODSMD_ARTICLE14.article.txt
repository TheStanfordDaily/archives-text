MOSCOW (AP) — The govern
ment has paid its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces and will
pay students' stipends within days.
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
told President Boris Yeltsin today.
Since his appointment nearly
three weeks ago, Primakov has
stressed that paying salaries and
pensions is his government's first
priority as it grapples with Russia's
grave economic crisis.
According to estimates pub
lished in the Kommersant this
month, Russia owed $2.4 billion in
back salaries and social payments.
Of that, $233 million was owed to
the military.

The government did not say
where it got the money to pay the
back wages. There has been no indi
cation that the Central Bank printed
new money for the repayment, so it
presumably came from funds previ
ously allocated to other purposes.
Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin
also focused on efforts to wrap up
formation of the new Cabinet — a
painful process that has stretched
into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats
remain unfilled.
Boris Fyodorov, a strong propo
nent of market-oriented reform,
was dismissed from his posts of act
ing deputy prime minister and tax
chief, as was Acting Deputy Prime

Minister Viktor Khristenko, Rus
sian news agencies reported.
Farid Gazizullin was appointed
head of the committee for state
property management, the agency
in charge of privatization, Interfax
said.
Alexander Shokhin, a centrist
named deputy prime minister in
charge of financial policy, resigned
from the Cabinet Friday after 10
days on the job.
A government team is to meet
Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suf
fered multibillion dollar losses when
the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt
on treasury bills.
