Recycling program should
be expanded to include
areas outside of residences

NESTLED IN THE heart of some of
the most ecologically valuable
regions in the nation, Stanford Uni
versity has a pressing responsibility to its
environment and to the people who live in
it. The University, in cooperation with the
Stanford Recycling Center, should boost the
effectiveness of its campus-wide recycling
program.
The majority of student recycling done on
campus originates from collections within
residences. Dormitories provide collection
bins for materials such as mixed paper, news
paper, glass and aluminum. Many coopera
tives also take the initiative to implement
extensive waste-reduction efforts, which
include composting and purchasing eco-
Iriendly goods. The Stanford Recycling Cen
ter also has a drop-off program for the larg
er Stanford community and collects waste
like used tires at designated times.
Few services are available, however, out
side the setting of University housing or for
recyclers without transportation. Facilities'
approach relies on individual student's initia
tive to recycle, and this prevents recycling
from being convenient and commonplace.
Dormitories, for example, do not provide
individual bins for recycling in each room.
At other universities such as Northwestern,
designated blue recycling bins are übiqui
tous. They are found in dormitories, libraries
and classrooms. At Northwestern, recycling
bins are next to almost every trash bin, so
that students have a choice to recycle any
where on campus.
Following Northwestern's lead by provid
ing a visible means for students to recycle
conveniently in their rooms would do more
than give students free d(x>r stops. A rela

tively small investment in receptacles would
demonstrate the University's awareness of a
major issue facing not just the state of Cali
fornia, but the entire world. Furthermore,
placing a recycling container next to every
trash bin in and out of residences would pre
vent the opportunistic tossing of waste.
Facilities should also commit to making
recycling available at all University-spon
sored functions. Recent Orientation gather
ings for graduate students served large quan
tities of bottled and canned beverages but
failed to provide anything other than large
trash containers. It is irresponsible for a
major university to fail to provide a simple
service to its community while the sanitation
departments of tiny cities are able to offer
d(X)r-to-door collection.
Stanford would also benefit from imple
menting a program like that of Yale Univer
sity. Yale employs a full-time Recycling
Coordinator to manage its campus-wide
recycling program.
Collection materials include everything
from paper to scrap metal. Yale Coordinator
CJ May explained that he is currently nego
tiating with architects to include recycling
friendly alcoves in their renovation projects
and new building designs on campus.
Granted, Yale University only seized
managment of the recycling program in 199()
when Connecticut implemented a recycling
law which mandates the recycling of all
paper, glass and aluminum. The recycling
effort, however, had been coordinated since
the 1970s by student organization.
Stanford Facilities should not wait for
passage of a new stringent California solid
waste law to take action. Further, student
organizations such as Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford should not con
tinue overlooking an issue that strikes so
close to home.
We should seek more inclusive and con
venient recycling services outside dorm
rooms on behalf of the environment outside
of campus.
