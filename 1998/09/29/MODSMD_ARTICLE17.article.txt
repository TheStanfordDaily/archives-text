## Seeking an era of global peace 
###

During this
first week of fall
in our nation's
capital, a city paralyzed by
scandal and recrimination,
I am reminded of an
important anniversary.
This time last year, I was

walking across Arlington Cemetery on my
way to a memorial service for five Ameri
cans who were killed in Bosnia while on a
peacekeeping mission. They lost their lives
along with 17 others in a helicopter crash.
Arlington is an American legend, a mon
ument to those who placed nation over self.
Its endless rows of markers depict the loss
of a devastating century, making it impossi
ble not to notice how many people fought
and died in the World Wars â€” whole pla
toons, entire carrier ships. These reminders
of past battles seemed far removed from the
memorial service, held for a group of Amer
icans whose mission was to reconstitute a
community police force in the rubble that
was Yugoslavia.
Indeed, the memorial service pointed to
a dramatic and important shift in today's
international interventions. Abroad is now
at home. Those Americans killed were for
mer FBI employees, a human rights worker
with the United Nations, and former law
enforcement officers from familiar places
such as Florida and Tennessee. Their iden
tities reflected the reality of today's wars,
where the vast majority of casualities are
civilians.

Many of today's security policy chal
lenges are far from the patrician realm of
arms control. As a State Department col
league recently said, we are no longer post-
Cold War but post-post-Cold War. The
"enemy" may no longer be understood
through a simplistic template of good
against evil. In this way, the ill-fated training
mission was not simply about borders and
weapons. It was about a complex mix of
human skills and hope. It was an attempt to
draw upon the skills of ordinary Americans
to resolve an extraordinary situation.
Deploying a multiethnic volunteer police
force into areas of conflict, as in the case of
the mission to the former Yugoslavia, does
not by default end in devastating loss. One
highly effective showcase program in Sara
jevo is a bicycle patrol which imported
Alaska's state mascot, "Safety Bear." In
Juneau, the bear instructs not to litter. In
Sarajevo, he reminds children not to walk
over land mines. Post-post-Cold War secu
rity is about bikes and bears, successful syn
ergies of multinational values. Americans
are perhaps uniquely qualified to teach
about the benefits of multiethnic coopera
tion.
Today's common experience in interna
tional intervention is a process of creation.
American involvement in civil society
building is more important than ever. The
"public security triad" is police-judicial
penal. Stability is contingent upon this real
ity and nobody makes the case more con
vincingly than the U.S. military itself. But

helping a national civil society is a highly
controversial issue. In a time when
Congress refuses to pay the country's dues
to the United Nations, let alone authorize
money for peacekeeping, the remarks I
heard at a military conference this week
were ironic: Nation-building is increasingly
becoming the exit strategy for international
intervention.
Here in Congress, the e-mail server
began crashing after the Starr Report went
on-line. At the same time, thousands of
Albanians are hiding in the hills, 15 million
Russians live on the brink of starvation and
two U.S. Embassies lie decimated in Africa.
That memorial service one year ago was
symbolic in more ways. Among the speak
ers were Madeleine Aibright from State,
Janet Reno from Justice, Joseph Ralston
from Defense, and Bernard Miyet from the
United Nations. Together they represented
the new face of U.S. national security.
In a week when I can't even send an e
mail from the House to the Senate, I reflect
on a bigger idea enunciated by Janet Reno
as she stood before us at that memorial ser
vice, praising the dead Americans: "They
were idealists and educators who acted on
their beliefs and who prized justice," she
said. Indeed, that is an American govern
ment we can be proud of.
