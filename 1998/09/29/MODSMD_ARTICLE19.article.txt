Psyllid remedy not sound
I recently read the Sept. 8 article in the
West County limes about Stanford Univer
sity's problem with psyllids (Glycaspis
brimblecomhei) attacking eucalyptus trees.
If these insects are not controlled, the trees
will die. ITie proposed solution was to intro
duce a psyllid predator for biological control.
Eucalyptus trees are themselves nonna
tive. They have invaded many of Califor
nia's native plant communities, decreasing
biological diversity and increasing the risk
for fires.
As a student of ecology, I see eucalyptus
trees as the problem. Introducing a psyllid
predator to stop psyllids from attacking the
eucalyptus trees could exacerbate the prob
lem. Any time an insect is introduced from
a different country, it has the potential to
start attacking native trees, prey on native
insects and outcompete native insects, over
taking their habitat.
An alternative solution that may remedy
the eucalyptus problem is to remove the
dying eucalyptus trees. Instead of spending
money on introducing psyllid predators to

the country, money could be spent on a
restoration project. Reintroducing native
plants and trees would help restore an eco
logical balance.
I'm surprised that the Department of
Biology at such a prestigious university has
not given its input about this problem.
If a restoration project were proposed
and accepted it could be an invaluable edu
cational tool for students interested in ecol
ogy and restoration as well as an opportuni
ty for habitat improvement for native
fauna.

Res Comp refund inadequate
I'm glad that Residential Computing has
decided to refund some students' money,
but I still think its policy needs significant
revision. Here's why:
First, many students paid $45 for ether
net access that, according to the written and
posted conditions of the Res Comp, was for
the duration of occupation of that residence

without a yearly fee. Many of us signed up
for an ethernet connection under those con
ditions and refund aside, it is still unfair to
violate that previous agreement. We have
already paid for a particular service and it is
Res Comp's responsibility to provide that
service. A rebate for some students does
not change this.
Second, if the fee structure was going to
be changed, it should have been phased in
in a way that respected the previous fee
agreements that Res Comp had offered.
Those who have paid for their $45 "life
time" connection should have continued to
receive it for as long as they remained in the
same residence. When students moved to a
new residence, the old agreement would be
terminated and Res Comp could then justi
fiably impose whatever new fees it wanted.
Third, rebate or not, the new price is a
bit steep.Sure, for the connection that we
receive, it is a reasonable deal. But to speak
metaphorically for a moment, Res Comp's
boasts about the price of its BMW connec
tion are desperately off-base for those of us
who only want a Ford but have to buy the

BMW because of the complete lack of
options offered.
As for Res Comp's general defense that
it needs the money to pay for network
maintainance, I'm inclined to think that this
is reason to appeal to the University for a
budget increase first, before charging typi
cally financially strapped graduate students.
The problem the rebate is meant to address,
namely an unfair change in policy by Res
Comp, still fails to represent a responsible
policy although it is an improvement.

Biker etiquette 101
As a bike commuter who's been dodg
ing other bikers at Stanford for six years,
these tips might come in handy for those
who need a quickie on biking etiquette.
When passing another biker coming
from the other direction on a sidewalk,
pass on the right (just as cars do). This
convention prevents head-on collisions.
If you're walking your bike or biking

slowly on wide, heavily trafficked streets,
please stay on the right so that faster bik
ers can pass you without colliding with
opposing traffic.
If you stop to talk to a passing friend,
please don't do it in the middle of the
street! (As absurd as this sounds, you will
see it happening again and again.) Please
be considerate and pull yourselves out of
the way of passing traffic.
When turning, especially when turning
left, look over your shoulder before mak
ing the turn. Someone else may have cho
sen that moment to pass you.
Basically, the golden rule of biking is to
think of your effect on other bikers and
pedestrians. Often, your actions won't
cause any harm to you but will cause acci
dents for others who are dodging you. If
we all follow this commonsense notion, we
can all breathe a little easier, though 1
guarantee you will still have at least one
bike crash in your four years here.
