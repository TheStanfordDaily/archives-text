# SHPRC, PHE classes in danger
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
The classes to train counselors for the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center and the Peer Health Educator
Program are currently without departments and are in
danger of not being taught this year.
The Psychology Department, which previously
taught the courses, dropped them when it discontinued
its clinical track.
"We submitted two proposals to be considered as
non-core classes in Human Biology, and Human Biolo
gy declined because their focus is on courses that are
strongly focused on biology," said Carol Pertofsky, who
teaches "Health Psychology and the Campus Culture,"
the class used in part to train PHEs
Pertofsky, the director of health promotion for Stu
dent Health Services, asserts that she will find some way
to reinstate the class by spring quarter.
"We are actively exploring other options," she said.
The SHPRC counselor training class, "Peer Counsel
ing: Issues in Sexual Health and Contraception," has
been almost entirely student-taught with the help of
Susan Anderson, a clinical assistant professor at the
Medical School.
The center is examining various solutions to train new
counselors, including joining their class with the peer
counseling class for the Bridge in the School of Educa
tion, according to sophomore Casey Ward, who would
have been head teaching assistant of the SHPRC peer
counseling class.
"We're OK for now because we trained enough coun
selors last spring," Ward said.
Pertofsky wants to ensure that both classes continue
to be taught for academic credit, rather than counting
strictly as activities units.
"I feel that the preparation is academic in nature and
should stay within the academic realm." she said.
Psychology Prof. Russell Fernald disagreed.
"The classes have to be situated where they're appro
priate," he said. "If students want to get credit at Stan
ford, the class has to have adequate intellectual content.
"It's like an activity course. You can't get intellectual
credit for playing badminton, and you shouldn't."
Fernald adds that he strongly supports the SHPRC
class and thinks that it should be taught.
According to Lauren Puryear, last year's head TA for
the SHPRC class, "the basic goal of the class is to im
prove the sexual health of students at Stanford. It's also
the only way we have to train counselors."
In the past, "Health Psychology and the Campus Cul
ture" was open to all students in the fall and was taught
again in the spring for the PHEs. The class, on hold for
the spring, is not being taught this fall.
"Peer Counseling: Issues in Sexual Health and Con
traception" was formerly offered all three quarters.
