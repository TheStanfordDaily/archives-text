## Cardinal flies past rival Cal in field hockey's Big Game 
### Nathan Christensen 
Stanford field hockey coach Sheryl Johnson
did not always have Cardinal fever. Transferring
to California after attending De Anza College,
Johnson proceeded to letter in field hockey, bas
ketball and softball as a Bear.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Saturday's Result: Stanford 3, California 0.
■ Sunday's Result: Stanford 9, UC-Santa Barbara 0.

Fifteen years ago, she was inducted into Cal's
Hall of Fame.
But things have changed since 1983 and there
is no better proof than last Saturday's game.
After spending more than a decade with
Stanford field hockey, Johnson now focuses on
rallying her team for crucial matches each year
such as those with rival Cal. Her excitement
over Stanford's (5-2) 3-0 victory over the Bears
(2-4) is testimony to her strong allegiance to the
Cardinal.
"I spent three years at Cal, and I've been at
Stanford for 15," she said.
Although the rivalry was nothing new for
Johnson, who has coached Cardinal field hock
ey since 1984, the team's goals for a NorPac
Conference championship required a strong
showing against Cal.
Johnson was not to be disappointed.
Despite the close games that have gripped
Cal and Stanford in past years, heading into the
weekend, Johnson was increasingly confident in
her team due to its recent performances.
"I think we've been playing very well," John
son said. "We were more than ready for [the
Cal] game."
As game time approached, however, John
son had to keep her team focused on prepara

tions for the Big Game.
"I thought [the players] did a really good job
of [preparing] this year," she commented. "Last
week our practices were up in intensity. While
[the players] were on the hockey field they
couldn't possibly focus on anything else."
Once the game was underway, Stanford
jumped ahead of the Bears midway through the
first half after junior forward Lindsey Dunagan
sent senior forward / midfielder Carey Cloyd's
assist past Cal's goalie.
Despite her goal, Dunagan remained deter
mined to keep Stanford in control of the game.
"Coach was really happy that we kept scoring
[and] we didn't let down after the goal," Duna
gan said. "Carey also gave me a great pass."
With 13:32 remaining in the second half, se
nior midfielder J ustina Williams scored an unas
sisted goal to extend Stanford's lead to 2-0. Al
though plenty of time was left in the game, a vic
tory suddenly seemed nearly out of reach for
Cal.
While it was her first goal of the season,
Williams described the play as if it was routine.
"In the first half they were giving me a lot of
room [because] they knew I was going to pass
it," Williams said. "1 noticed they were backing
up a little bit so I just took it strong side, made a
couple moves and took it into the top of the cir
cle and took a shot.
"Luckily we had some forwards in there that
were blocking the goalie's vision so it went right
in."
Less than 10 minutes later, the Cardinal
struck again.
This attack was led by Cloyd. Increasing her
point total to three by scoring her second goal of
the season, Cloyd gave Stanford its third goal of
the game and nailed the victory for the Cardinal.
Johnson attributed Cal's ability to hold the
Cardinal to just three goals to the play of Bears'
goalie Sarah Hoehn, who recorded 10 saves in

the defeat.
"I thought their goalkeeper had a really good
game," Johnson said.
Cal was rarely able to break through the Car
dinal defense, on the other hand, having but one
opportunity to take a shot.
"Our team is clicking now," Johnson said.
"Not only is the passing game on but our de
fenders were absolutely outstanding that
game."
Dunagan, as well, finds it hard to ignore the
crucial role the defense played.
"We've done a lot more strategy this year
than usual," Dunagan said. "It's the same de
fense lineup as last year so [our defense has] had
two years working together and they're really
coming together."
The following day, the Cardinal welcomed
UC-Santa Barbara to Stanford for its second
game of the weekend.
Although the game will not be recorded in
Stanford's record since Santa Barbara's team is
a club team rather than varsity, Stanford did not
let down its guard.
Following the dedication of the new Astro
turf Varsity Hockey Field, the Cardinal pound
ed UCSB, 9-0, providing further evidence of the
solidity of the defense and strength of the pass
ing game.
Stanford emerged from the weekend remain
ing undefeated in conference play, having
soundly defeated Southwest Missouri State two
weeks ago and California on Saturday.
Looking back on the weekend, Williams,
who has played under Johnson for four consec
utive seasons, was not concerned by her coach's
history with Cal.
Johnson's career with the Bears "is on the
sly," Williams joked.
"She got her masters from Stanford [and]
that's the only thing she ever talks about," she
added.
