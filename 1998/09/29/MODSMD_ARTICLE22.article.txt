# Lots of tradition, lots of hope
## Golf team looks to star veterans to set the pace this season

In a sport that traditionally em
phasizes individual ability, the suc
cess of the 1998-99 Stanford men's
golf team will depend on how well the
team can gel and learn from the ex
periences of last year.
With the season beginning this
week, at the Husky Classic in Wash
ington, and running clear through

May and into June for the NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal will
have to learn as it goes.
The team looks to improve on last
season, when it finished sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference and narrowly
missed NCAA Regionals.
"Last year's team wasn't bad, just
young and subject to nature," said
head coach Wally Goodwin, who be
gins his 12th season at the helm.

"We got off to a shaky start, then
El Nino hit us in the wintertime, so we
didn't play any golf until late winter.
When we finally started playing, we
were okay. We were just so far be
hind, we couldn't catch up."
With a drier forecast for this sea
son, the Cardinal should get enough
practice time to make up for last year.
This year's squad returns 10 play
ers and with the addition of three

quality freshmen, the Cardinal have
the potential to contend in the Pac-10
and make a trip to the NCAA's.
"We're going to generate some
electricity this season," Goodwin
said.
The team looks to build around
senior captain and Ail-American
Joel Kribel. Kribel enters the season
