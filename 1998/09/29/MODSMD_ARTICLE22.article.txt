# Lots of tradition, lots of hope
## Golf team looks to star veterans to set the pace this season 
### Ramona Shelburne 
In a sport that traditionally em
phasizes individual ability, the suc
cess of the 1998-99 Stanford men's
golf team will depend on how well the
team can gel and learn from the ex
periences of last year.
With the season beginning this
week, at the Husky Classic in Wash
ington, and running clear through

May and into June for the NCAA
Championships, the Cardinal will
have to learn as it goes.
The team looks to improve on last
season, when it finished sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference and narrowly
missed NCAA Regionals.
"Last year's team wasn't bad, just
young and subject to nature," said
head coach Wally Goodwin, who be
gins his 12th season at the helm.

"We got off to a shaky start, then
El Nino hit us in the wintertime, so we
didn't play any golf until late winter.
When we finally started playing, we
were okay. We were just so far be
hind, we couldn't catch up."
With a drier forecast for this sea
son, the Cardinal should get enough
practice time to make up for last year.
This year's squad returns 10 play
ers and with the addition of three

quality freshmen, the Cardinal have
the potential to contend in the Pac-10
and make a trip to the NCAA's.
"We're going to generate some
electricity this season," Goodwin
said.
The team looks to build around
senior captain and Ail-American
Joel Kribel. Kribel enters the season
ranked fifth in the nation by the Mas
ter Card Collegiate Golf Poll and
looks to better a season in which he
recorded five top-three perfor
mances along with finishing in a tie
for second at the NCAA Champi
onships. Kribel's experiences outside
of Stanford include the U.S. Open,
the Walker Cup and medalist honors
at the U.S. Amateur Open, which will
be much appreciated by a still young
team looking for a leader.
"Joel's played nationally so
much." Goodwin said. "He knows
what it takes to get to the next level
beyond college. That kind of experi
ence will be valuable to our team."
With Kribel's experience, and
Goodwin's outstanding resume,
which includes one NCAA Coach of
the Year award and two Pac-1()
Coach of the Year honors. Stanford
certainly has that leadership.
Besides Kribel, the Cardinal will
look to junior Dusty Brett to com
plete the backbone of the team.
Last year Brett competed in all 12

events for the Cardinal, earning hon
orable mention All Pac-10 honors.
Goodwin will also look for junior
Tylar Lunke and sophomores Jimmy
Lee and Alex Aragon to round out a
talented core group of golfers.
"Tylar s been working really hard
this summer," Goodwin said. "He's
going to be more of a force this year."
Three talented freshmen join the
team and head coach Gooodwin ex
pects them to step up and contribute
to the team. Freshmen Del deWindt,
K.C Yasmer, and Ned Yetten come
in with impressive credentials and
look to make an immediate impact.
The freshmen will battle for time
with seniors Tyler Dennis and David
Searle, as well as sophomores Rudy
Barreto and Eric Dahlberg.
The Cardinal will travel to Illinois
for the Windon Memorial Classic in
early October, after competing in
Washington this week.
