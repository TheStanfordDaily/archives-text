# Just a bit outside
## Football rivalries from sixth grade 
### 
Brian Eule

Sixth grade has some special
memories for me. I don't know
what it was about that time in my
life, but certain things just keep
bringing me back to that year. It was
the year that kissing behind the
bungalows was considered outra
geous and risky. It was the year in
which we were all terrified of Mr. A,

our 5-foot-2-inch math teacher who
could barely reach the chalkboard.
It was the year in which the greatest
prank ever was to embarrass your
friends in any conceivable way.
(Wait, that one hasn't changed.)
And it was the year in which col
lege football became a main topic of
discussion and trash talk on our
playground.
Jim Rohr had moved into my
small community on the skirts of
Los Angeles, from Illinois, only a
year before and was still considered
the new kid in town. The teachers
immediately loved him, my best fe
male friend began dating him and
he was soon a very popular kid
among my peers.
I had no problem with Jim's sud
den popularity. In fact, I liked the
guy. But then came the day he en
tered our college football play
ground conversations.
Growing up in Southern Califor
nia, my friends and I all favored
teams from the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and rarely gave any credit to
other schools. We knew they exist
ed. We just never acknowledged
their talent.
"So, Jim," I started the conversa
tion, hoping he would feel right at
home with my friends. "What's
your favorite team?"

"Notre Dame," he responded.
A hush grew over the crowd.
"You know, the Fighting Irish,"
he added.
"Did he say what I think he
said?" someone asked.
"My mommy told me never to
mention them," someone else whis
pered.
The USC fans in the group start
ed crying at the mere mention of the
school. (There was something
wrong with them to begin with.)
I took Jim aside. This was unac
ceptable. Notre Dame fans were
unheard of on this elementary
school playground. Did he know
what he was up against?
But there was no convincing him
otherwise. That year, Jim made it
his duty to teach each one of us
everything there was to know about
George Gipp, the Four Horsemen,
Knute Rockne and that very fa
mous fight song. We knew where
he'd end up eventually, and when
Jim's family moved back to Illinois
at the end of the year, we were
forced to say goodbye to our very
own Rudy.
Now in college, it was of little
surprise to my sixth-grade friends
that I ended up at a Pac-10 school.
The trash talking began. With
friends going to Oregon, Arizona,
UCLA, USC and California, it was
traditional to call after a victory, es
pecially when it came against one of
their schools, and rub as much salt
in the wound as possible.
Last year, I had my first en
counter with the Fighting Irish. As
Stanford defeated Notre Dame, 33-
15, in front of a packed Stanford
Stadium as well as a national televi
sion audience, I couldn't help but
smile and think of my young friend,
Jim. Had he ended up at Notre
Dame and was he witnessing Stan
ford, a Pac-10 school, destroying his
beloved Irish? I had to laugh. It was
a shame I had lost touch with the
guy-

Last week, Jim walked into my
dorm room.
It was out of the blue. My jaw
dropped in disbelief as I stared at
the large man standing before me,
only slightly resembling the young
kid who had taken so much pride in
Notre Dame football. I was thrilled
to see him, but was perplexed as to
how he found me.
"Where were you going to school

last year?" I asked.
"Notre Dame," he responded
with a smile.
Of course. Things hadn't
changed one bit. It was unbeliev
able. I wanted to immediately start
arguing with him over who would
take next week's game between the
No. 23 Irish and the Cardinal. There
was little doubt that Stanford would
be coming into South Bend after
having an extremely difficult Satur
day in Oregon, but Notre Dame had
experienced its share of trauma this
year as well.

Jim began to tell me how Notre
Dame's campus lived and died with
football. The entire well-being of
the campus depended upon how
well that team did each week. There
was so much pressure on every
member of the team. Football was
life.
"So, tell me," I stumbled. "What
are you doing here?"
"I transferred," he answered.

columns run on Tuesday, thinks of
himself as the Daily's "Rudy.
