### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
As the California general election on Nov. 3 ap
proaches. so too does the deadline for voter registra
tion. A coalition of Stanford student groups, coordi
nated by Campus Green Vote, a national organiza
tion, are joining forces to promote student voter regis
tration before Monday's deadline.
Campus Green Vote encourages student voter reg
istration nationwide through an emphasis on environ
mental issues. At Stanford, they are aligning their ef
forts with dorm Environmental Representatives,
Stanford in Government, the ASSU, the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, Stanford Democrats and
Stanford Republicans.
"Each group has its own agenda, but we're all work

ing together to register students as a whole," said Leila
Salazar, field organizer for Campus Green Vote.
"Your political persuasion doesn't matter," said
ASSU President Maren Norton. "That you're voting is
the key."
The groups are planning to send representatives to
house meetings Wednesday night with voter registra
tion forms. There will also be a table in White Plaza
each day until Monday, where students can pick up
and drop off forms. In addition, freshmen received
registration forms in their orientation packets cour
tesy of the ASSU.
After Monday's registration deadline, the coalition
will shift gears to educate voters and get them to the
polls in November.
