# Coalition registers students to vote
## 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
As the California general election on Nov. 3 ap
proaches. so too does the deadline for voter registra
tion. A coalition of Stanford student groups, coordi
nated by Campus Green Vote, a national organiza
tion, are joining forces to promote student voter regis
tration before Monday's deadline.
Campus Green Vote encourages student voter reg
istration nationwide through an emphasis on environ
mental issues. At Stanford, they are aligning their ef
forts with dorm Environmental Representatives,
Stanford in Government, the ASSU, the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, Stanford Democrats and
Stanford Republicans.
"Each group has its own agenda, but we're all work

ing together to register students as a whole," said Leila
Salazar, field organizer for Campus Green Vote.
"Your political persuasion doesn't matter," said
ASSU President Maren Norton. "That you're voting is
the key."
The groups are planning to send representatives to
house meetings Wednesday night with voter registra
tion forms. There will also be a table in White Plaza
each day until Monday, where students can pick up
and drop off forms. In addition, freshmen received
registration forms in their orientation packets cour
tesy of the ASSU.
After Monday's registration deadline, the coalition
will shift gears to educate voters and get them to the
polls in November.

Campus Green Vote has sup
plied the campaign with a number
of posters emphasizing voting as a
means to preserve the environ
ment. The posters cite studies
showing that male sperm counts
have dropped by 42 percent since
1938, and that one in eight Ameri
can women will develop breast can
cer in her lifetime. They attribute
these statistics to pollution.
Salazar acknowledged that the

groups may be fighting an uphill
battle, as many Stanford students
who vote do so in their home
precinct with absentee ballots and
don't want to change their registra
tion. Last week, the budding coali
tion registered only 65 students.
"We encourage students to vote
locally," she said, "as most students
will be living here for the next four
years."
Those already registered at Stan
ford do exercise their right to vote in
higher numbers than 18-to-24-year
olds nationally, albeit still at a dis
mal rate. Precincts on the Stanford

campus averaged a 49.4 percent
voter participation rate for the 1996
general election, though that figure
does include on-campus resident
faculty as well as students. The low
est participation rate among Stan
ford precincts was 36 percent.
Nationally, however, students
only voted at a rate of 33 percent in
the same election.
"We'd like to emphasize the low
voter turnout across the board,"
said Elma Rosas-Martinez, spokes
woman for the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters office.
Elizabeth Pianca, chair of Stan

ford in Government, was enthusi
astic about the new coalition.
"SIG has always worked on voter
registration," she said, "but efforts
have been scattered among groups.
It should be a collaborative effort."
Norton concurred,
"We want to bring lots of differ
ent groups that represent different
parts of the student body to get out
the vote," she said,
"Sometimes we forget on this
campus that we're part of the out
side world .... Part of being at a
top school is taking part in our
democracy."
