# Walbot wins grant

For Biology Prof. Virginia Wal
bot, today is day one of the five-year
Plant Genome Initiative.
Early yesterday morning, Wal
bot participated in a telephone con
ference confirming the $85-million
grant she has been awarded by the
National Science Foundation to
continue her research mapping the
corn genome.
Participating with Walbot are
nine other professors from lowa
State University, the Seed Center at
the University of linois, the Uni
versity of Arizona, IJC'-San Diego
and UC-Berkeley.
The scientists worked in con

junction with the National Com
Growers Association to receive the
grant. "We have worked aggressive
ly over the last five years to get fed
eral funding and to gain national at
tention for the work that Virginia is
doing," said Chris Nieland of the
NCGA.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1%7, Walbot did graduate work
at Yale and then the University of
Georgia. She returned to Stanford
in 1980 and has been working ever
since on the corn genome.
The project focuses on the trans
posable elements of the corn
genome, which are sections of DN A
that can move to different locations
and which cause mutations. There
are over 5,000 genes to be cata
logued.
Walbot plans to build a "library"
of genes and plants on the World
Wide Web.
With the help of many other sci
entists and "teams of well-trained
Ph.D.s," she will take gene samples
from over 500,000 plants from farms
all over the country and take pic
tures of specific mutations in the
plants. She will then put those pic
tures on the Web.
Each picture will have a link to

the genome that causes the muta
tion in the plant. It scientists find
one plant desirable over another,
they will be able to produce more
plants similar to those on the Web.
According to the NCGA. "Wal
bot's work is important because it
could result in plants that require
less fertilizer and fewer crop protec
tion chemicals. It could also mean
less soil erosion, increased crop
yields, reduced production costs and
conservation of resources."
If Walbot's research is able to im
prove the quality of corn produced
in the United States, the result could
be a significant economic benefit.
"Every 3 percent increase in the
corn yield contributes $1 billion to
the economy," says Nieland.
