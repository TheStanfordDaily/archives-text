Plant Genome Initiative.
Early yesterday morning, Wal
bot participated in a telephone con
ference confirming the $85-million
grant she has been awarded by the
National Science Foundation to
continue her research mapping the
corn genome.
Participating with Walbot are
nine other professors from lowa
State University, the Seed Center at
the University of linois, the Uni
versity of Arizona, IJC'-San Diego
and UC-Berkeley.
The scientists worked in con

junction with the National Com
Growers Association to receive the
grant. "We have worked aggressive
ly over the last five years to get fed
eral funding and to gain national at
tention for the work that Virginia is
doing," said Chris Nieland of the
NCGA.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1%7, Walbot did graduate work
at Yale and then the University of
Georgia. She returned to Stanford
in 1980 and has been working ever
since on the corn genome.
The project focuses on the trans
posable elements of the corn
genome, which are sections of DN A
