# Lines for Vintage dancing
## Tryouts will be more competitive 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Accompanying the recent trend
in partner dancing and especially in
swing music and dancing. Vintage
Dance Ensemble is expecting
record crowds at today's auditions.
Richard Powers, head of Vintage
and lecturer in the Drama Depart
ment, is surprised and thrilled at the
current interest in the group. He
first realized that the auditions
might have an unusual number of
interested students last week at the
International Students Orientation
Party at Bechtel International Cen
ter.
"I'm a little apprehensive about
the crowds," Powers said.
He and his assistant director.
Kvan Knotts, class of'%, anticipate
that between 1(H) and 2(H) people
will show up for the auditions. Only
20 spaces are available.
"Considering the immense pop
ularity of dancing and swing. I m not
surprised about the numbers." said
sophomore Rebecca Rainof. who is
considering auditioning. "I'm going
into it not to get into the group but
to enjoy dancing for the night."
"I think it's really cool that social
dance is taking off." said Deb
Henigson, a senior who has danced

with Vintage since her sophomore
year. "The auditions are usually a
lot of fun, hut 1 have a feeling that
this year it's going to be a zoo."
The theme of last week's party
was swing, and Powers noted that
many incoming freshmen expressed
interest in Vintage and already had
prior knowledge of many dances.
Powers attributed this unusual
knowledge of vintage dancing and
the incoming students' enthusiasm
for the group to the recent popular
ity of swing music.
"Swing has been growing for a
while," said Powers. "But there was
a spike, a large increase in populari
ty this summer."
"It's definitely helped popularize
Vintage as \ group," said Henigson.
"I think it's a combination of our
repertoire and what's in now."
The number of spaces available
is greater than it has traditionally
been because of efforts to divide the
group into two parts.
In anticipation of the record
numbers of interested students,
Powers and Knotts decided to split
the Vintage Dance Ensemble into
two separate groups for the first
time. There will be a dance group
that focuses on Victorian and nine
teenth century dance, and another
group focusing on swing dancing.
This separation will allow the
groups to fit on one stage at different
times, and also permits more people
to become involved. Multiple stu
dios in Roble Gym and supportive
teaching staff make this possible.
The groups are designed to incor
porate more students in the swing
group, although, according to Pow
ers, most of the people who have al
ready danced with Vintage will
probably choose to participate in the
Victorian group.
Powers emphasized that the poli
cy of continuing to admit those peo
ple who have participated in the past
will stand for this year. Although de
pending on the incoming talent this
year and in the following years, that
policy may have to be modified.

In the recent past, those people
who had graduated from Stanford
were invited to continue participat
ing in Vintage. Two years ago, how
ever, this policy had to change be
cause of the size of the group. Since
then. Vintage alumni have partic
ipated in a group called Danse
Libre, which performs all over the
Bay Area and continues to use the
same choreography as the on-cam
pus group.
Along with the increase in the
number of people interested in Vin
tage, there has been an accompany
ing increase in other dance affiliated
groups and classes on campus.
The lines for Social Dance this
quarter began at 1:30 a.m., which
Powers said was very unusual. He is
happy about the increased visibility
of vintage dancing, however.
"I'm happy that we were ahead of
the curve ... I feel great that [swing]
is finally being recognized as great
dancing and great music," he said.
