## Tryouts will be more competitive 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Accompanying the recent trend
in partner dancing and especially in
swing music and dancing. Vintage
Dance Ensemble is expecting
record crowds at today's auditions.
Richard Powers, head of Vintage
and lecturer in the Drama Depart
ment, is surprised and thrilled at the
current interest in the group. He
first realized that the auditions
might have an unusual number of
interested students last week at the
International Students Orientation
Party at Bechtel International Cen
ter.
"I'm a little apprehensive about
the crowds," Powers said.
He and his assistant director.
Kvan Knotts, class of'%, anticipate
that between 1(H) and 2(H) people
will show up for the auditions. Only
20 spaces are available.
"Considering the immense pop
ularity of dancing and swing. I m not
surprised about the numbers." said
sophomore Rebecca Rainof. who is
considering auditioning. "I'm going
into it not to get into the group but
to enjoy dancing for the night."
"I think it's really cool that social
dance is taking off." said Deb
Henigson, a senior who has danced

with Vintage since her sophomore
year. "The auditions are usually a
lot of fun, hut 1 have a feeling that
this year it's going to be a zoo."
The theme of last week's party
was swing, and Powers noted that
many incoming freshmen expressed
interest in Vintage and already had
prior knowledge of many dances.
Powers attributed this unusual
knowledge of vintage dancing and
the incoming students' enthusiasm
for the group to the recent popular
ity of swing music.
"Swing has been growing for a
while," said Powers. "But there was
a spike, a large increase in populari
ty this summer."
"It's definitely helped popularize
Vintage as \ group," said Henigson.
"I think it's a combination of our
repertoire and what's in now."
The number of spaces available
is greater than it has traditionally
been because of efforts to divide the
group into two parts.
In anticipation of the record
numbers of interested students,
Powers and Knotts decided to split
the Vintage Dance Ensemble into
two separate groups for the first
time. There will be a dance group
that focuses on Victorian and nine
