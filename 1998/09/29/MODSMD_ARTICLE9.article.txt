"How sustainable will the peace
process be?"
That was the question that Ed
uardo Stein, minister of foreign rela
tions from Guatemala, posed to an
audience yesterday at a lunch time
talk titled "The Peace Process in
Guatemala: Transforming a Na
tion."
Stein, who received both his mas
ter's and his doctorate in communi
cation from Northwestern Universi
ty, outlined the major thrusts in his
government's attempts at peace.
Guatemala has been wracked by
major insurrections and corruption
in its push for modernization in re
cent decades.
In the talk, which was presented
by the Center for Latin American
Studies and the Consulate General
of Guatemala in San Francisco,
Stein set out to "underscore the six
most fundamental things unleashed
by the peace accords."
Stein discussed such topics as
strengthening democracy, creating
a multicultural nation and rethink
ing national security and defense.
The problems that Stein and the
current regime face are formidable.

"Many of the institutions have de
voted resources to counterinsur
gency," Stein said. He also included
corruption, lack of education, and
the country's tremendous ethnic di
versity among the challenges that
his nation faces. Indigenous people
account for half of the 11 million cit
izens of Guatemala, Stein said,
which includes over 23 ethnic
groups and 4 major languages.
"My country is very racist," Stein
confessed, citing the tax structure
and laws constructed in favor of a se
lect few inhabitants and big busi
nesses. He went on to say, "We need
to allow for a true multiculturality to
emerge ... and we do not know how
to do it."
Stein spoke of his government's
reforms of land ownership and edu
cation/Tor the first time, people
can acquire a piece of the land in a
communal and traditional fashion,"
Stein said.
Most importantly, Stein consis
tently referred to the future. "The
key will be continuity," he said,
"whether or not we can turn over to
the incoming government an ongo
ing [peace] process."
The talk, which was held at the
Law School, was attended by about
50 people.
