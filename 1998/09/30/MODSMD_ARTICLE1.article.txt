# Less psyched
## Psychology enrolling fewer majors 
### Tracy Jan Senior staff writer 
Psychology, traditionally one of the
University's most popular majors, has ex
perienced a steady decline in numbers over

the last four years.
While still one of the larger depart
ments, with 250 active undergraduate ma
jors, the number of undergraduate degrees
conferred has dropped from 151 in the
1994-95 academic year to 114 last year, ac
cording to Undergraduate Coordinator
Joni Bonham.
"It's a significant decrease," said Prof.
Ewart Thomas, chair of the department's
undergraduate education committee. "We
are concerned about it here in the depart
ment, but I'm not sure what the reasons
are. These things go in cycles."
An informal survey sent out over e-mail
to psychology majors last year indicated
that students were concerned about the
number of large introductory lecture class
es required, the lack of a formal advising
system and the weak facilitation of stu
dent-faculty interaction in general.

In addition, Thomas said a common stu
dent complaint was the amount of material
that overlaps among courses.
Stanford's chapter of Psi Chi, the psy
chology national honor society, met with
faculty and administrators last spring to ad
dress student concerns about the under
graduate program.
"A majority of students in the depart
ment do not have academic advisors be
cause it is not required," said coterminal
student Jonathan Levitt, a former Psi Chi
co-president. He said the department is
working to implement a new system of as
signed advisors for all psychology majors.
"There are plenty of faculty who are
willing," Thomas said. "The problem is
that some very popular professors get
overloaded."
