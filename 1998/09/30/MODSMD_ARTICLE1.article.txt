# Less psyched
## Psychology enrolling fewer majors 
### Tracy Jan Senior staff writer 
Psychology, traditionally one of the
University's most popular majors, has ex
perienced a steady decline in numbers over

the last four years.
While still one of the larger depart
ments, with 250 active undergraduate ma
jors, the number of undergraduate degrees
conferred has dropped from 151 in the
1994-95 academic year to 114 last year, ac
cording to Undergraduate Coordinator
Joni Bonham.
"It's a significant decrease," said Prof.
Ewart Thomas, chair of the department's
undergraduate education committee. "We
are concerned about it here in the depart
ment, but I'm not sure what the reasons
are. These things go in cycles."
An informal survey sent out over e-mail
to psychology majors last year indicated
that students were concerned about the
number of large introductory lecture class
es required, the lack of a formal advising
system and the weak facilitation of stu
dent-faculty interaction in general.

In addition, Thomas said a common stu
dent complaint was the amount of material
that overlaps among courses.
Stanford's chapter of Psi Chi, the psy
chology national honor society, met with
faculty and administrators last spring to ad
dress student concerns about the under
graduate program.
"A majority of students in the depart
ment do not have academic advisors be
cause it is not required," said coterminal
student Jonathan Levitt, a former Psi Chi
co-president. He said the department is
working to implement a new system of as
signed advisors for all psychology majors.
"There are plenty of faculty who are
willing," Thomas said. "The problem is
that some very popular professors get
overloaded."
Another student concern indicat
ed in last year's survey is the increas
ing competition to get into upper-di
vision seminars, Levitt said. "The in
troduction of freshmen and sopho
more seminars greatly diminished
the junior / senior seminars from the
department," he said. "Many of our
majors don't get the chance to take a
seminar or interact with the profes
sors during their time here."
Thomas said the department is
trying to provide smaller classes at
all levels. "We need small classes pe

riod," he said. "We do so every
chance we get."
The survey also indicated that
students who get involved in re
search earlier tend to be happier
with the department. To facilitate
doing early research, the depart
ment needs to find a way to make
faculty more accessible to students,
Levitt said.
"A lot of professors don't have
time to get to know students on an
individual basis," said Kim Griffin, a
senior psychology major. "You end
up getting to know the graduate stu
dents whoTA the classes better than
the profs."
Despite the improvements

sought by students and faculty,
many psychology majors remain
content with their choice and are op
timistic about the department's fu
ture.
"If the diminishing size means
we're getting more serious psychol
ogy majors, that's a good thing,"
Levitt said. "In fact, it's better be
cause more resources can be allotted
to people who really care. I don't
think [the decline in numbers] is a
cause for alarm."
Senior Scott Claypool decided to
major in psychology after taking
Psychology 1: "Introduction to Psy
chology" sophomore year. "Enthu
siasm in the department is high,"

Claypool said. "The faculty is out
standing."
To increase enrollment in Psy
chology 1 this year, graduate stu
dents hope to visit residence halls
across campus and talk to students
about the class, research projects
and other related topics.
Decreased enrollment in Psy
chology 1 is a particular concern to
graduate students because they use
students in the class as subjects in
their experiments. The course re
quires that each student participate
as a subject in 10 hours of faculty or
graduate student experiments.
"The more people who are en
rolled in Psychology 1, the more

people we can get to participate in
research," said Adrienne Lee, the
human subjects coordinator.
"A lot of people think, 'Oh, Stan
ford psych â€” the prison experiment.
I don't want to be in that!'," she
added, referring to an experiment in
prison psychology in the early 1970s
that had to be stopped when subjects
became dangerously involved in
their roles.
Although students often com
plain about the large cumulative
time commitment the experiments
require, Lee said participating in ex
periments is a crucial aspect of the
undergraduate psychology experi
ence.
