## Arafat accepts land 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Palestinian leader Yass
er Arafat accepted Israel's formula for turning over
more land on the West Bank Tuesday and voiced
hope that an agreement could be concluded at a White
House summit in mid-October. "Peace is a Palestinian
need, Israeli need. Arab need, international need,"
Arafat said.
With momentum toward an accord growing. Presi
dent Clinton and Arafat were looking ahead to a time
when the United States may be able to "engage for
mally" with the Palestinians, White House spokesman
Mike McCurry said after the two leaders held hour
long talks.
The statement by McCurry suggested the Clinton
administration could be preparing for Palestinian
statehood, or at least upgrading U.S. dealings with the
current Palestinian Authority that Arafat sees as a
precursor to a state.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat
assured Clinton that he would try to counter terrorism
against Israel. Israel's pullback would cover 13
percent of the West Bank, on top of the 27 percent
Israel promised earlier to hand over to Arafat's Pales
tinian Authority.
It was proposed by the Clinton administration last
winter to prod Israel to give up more of the West
Bank. Arafat, who had claimed virtually all of the ter
ritory, agreed to settle for the 13 percent.
Israel, meanwhile, proposed what its diplomats
called "refinements." These included setting aside 3

percent of the land for a nature preserve, with Israel
having a hand in maintaining security over the unde
veloped area.
"We agreed to it to facilitate the negotiations" for
an overall West Bank settlement, Arafat told
reporters after his meeting with Clinton. The Presi
dent proposed the summit and negotiations on Mon
day during a session with Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
