# Court to decide school liability
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said
Tuesday it will decide whether educators have a legal
responsibility to stop students from sexually harassing
their classmates, an issue of enormous importance to
schools nationwide.
The justices will decide whether a Georgia school
district can be sued over teachers' alleged failure to step
in after a fifth-grader complained that another student
was sexually harassing her.
A federal appeals court said a federal anti-discrimi
nation law does not allow lawsuits involving student
on-student harassment, although children can sue over
such misconduct by a teacher.
The case is not about ordinary teasing or schoolyard
hazing. The girl says the boy, also a fifth-grader, repeat
edly tried to touch her breasts and other body parts,
rubbed against her in a suggestive way. and made vul
gar comments indicating he wanted to have sex with
her.
The American Association of University Women
Educational Foundation said in 1993 that 85 percent of
girls and 76 percent of boys had experienced sexual
harassment in school. But Julie Underwood of the
National School Boards Association said Tuesday that
since then, many districts have drafted anti-harassment
policies and sought to educate students and teachers

about the problem.
In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for stu
dents to force school districts to pay financial damages
over sexual harassment by a teacher. But the ruling said
payment can be ordered when someone with authority
to do something about the problem "has actual notice
of or is deliberately indifferent" to the teacher's mis
conduct.
In the Georgia case, a federal appeals court ruled
that a federal law known as Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 does not apply when students
harass each other.
The Clinton administration urged the high court to
overturn that ruling.
Government lawyers said the justices' ruling in June
"makes clear that when a school district responds with
deliberate indifference to known incidents of sexual
harassment of a student, it discriminates against that
student."
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year
threw out a lawsuit against the Monroe County, Ga.,
school board and two officials.
Aurelia Davis sued over a five-month "barrage of
sexual harassment and abuse" she said her daughter
LaShonda endured at Hubbard Elementary School in
Forsyth, Ga., in the 1992-93 year.
