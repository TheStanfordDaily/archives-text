# Feds cut interest rate

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”The Federal Reserve
moved to inoculate the U.S. economy against a spread
ing global crisis Tuesday, cutting a key interest rate for
the first time in nearly three years.
The quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate to
5.25 percent will mean slightly lower borrowing costs
for millions of Americans on everything from auto
loans to home equity lines of credit if commercial
banks, as expected, follow suit in coming days by low
ering their benchmark prime lending rates. The prime
rate is currently at 8.5 percent.
Wall Street, which had hoped for a bigger rate cut.
sent stock prices plunging by more than 1(X) points after
the Fed announcement but later recovered somewhat.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down
28.32 at 8,080.52.
Congressional critics, who have complained that the
Fed has been slow to recognize the threat of Asian eco
nomic troubles to American manufacturers and farm
ers, were also unhappy.
"America and the rest of the world needs stronger
action by the Federal Reserve," said Sen. Tom Harkin,

D-lowa. "The weakening of foreign economies is drag
ging down the U.S. economy."
Private economists, however, said that Tuesday's
decision to lower the federal funds rate, which has been
at 5.5 percent for IS months, still represented a remark
able turnaround for Fed policy-makers, who as recent
ly as July were leaning toward raising rates to fight
inflation.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan first
signaled the Fed's change of heart earlier this month
when he warned that the United States was unlikely to
remain an 'oasis of prosperity" in the face of a curren
cy crisis that began in Asia, then spread to Russia in
August and is now threatening countries in Latin
America.
"This was a difficult decision for the Fed. It is rather
hard to make a convincing case for lower interest rates
in the United States at the present time," said former
Fed board member Lyle Gramley, economist with the
Mortgage Bankers Association. "The Fed was taking
this as a psychological step to settle markets down
internationally."
