# Ex-mayor Bradley dies
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — He
took over a city divided. He left a
city divided. In the 20 years in
between, Tom Bradley, the first
and only black mayor of Los Ange
les, felt the warm glow of the
Olympic flame and the searing heat
of riot fires.
The tall, quiet Texas sharecrop
per's son and college track star who
rose through the ranks of the
LAPD to become a city council
man and then a five-term mayor of
Los Angeles died of heart attack
Tuesday at age 80.
Bradley never fully recovered
from a heart attack and stroke in

19%.
As mayor from 1973 to 1993,
Bradley was credited with opening
city government to minorities and
women, expanding social services
to the urban poor and spurring eco
nomic growth.
Under his administration, Los
Angeles surpassed San Francisco as
the West Coast's economic power
in Pacific Rim trading, symbolized
by the downtown skyline that grew
during his administration.
"He made us proud to be part of
this city," said City Attorney James
Hahn. "We were proud of him as
our mayor — his dignity, his grace

and his willingness to get things
done. The 20 years he was mayor
will probably be the years when
Los Angeles really grew up and
became a world-class city."
A soft-spoken man, he governed
quietly, by building coalitions
instead of using the bully pulpit.
His long hours and energy, even
into his 70s, were legendary.
His style of leadership served
him well for much of his two
decade rule — until the changes in
the late 1980s and early '90s.
At 75, he announced his retire
ment, avoiding an election he
probably couldn't have won.
