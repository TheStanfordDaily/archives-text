Consumer confidence shaken
NEW YORK (AP) â€”Shaken by global eco
nomic and political turmoil. Americans' confidence
in the U.S. economy fell for the third straight
month in September.
The Conference Board reported Tuesday that
its index of consumer confidence fell 7.1 points to
126 in September from a revised 133.1 in August.
The index is down 12.2 points from its 29-year high
in June.
September's decline was larger than Wall Street
analysts had expected and the biggest monthly

drop since January. It brings the index to its lowest
level since October 1997.
"We are beginning to see the financial ails of
others arrive at the shores of the U.S., and that will
result in some degree of slowing of the economy,"
said Dan Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities
International Co. "Consumers realize this and they
are just becoming a bit more cautious."
The consumer confidence index, started in 1967,
is compiled from responses to questions sent to
5,000 households nationwide. The index compares
results to its base year. 1985, when it stood at 100.
