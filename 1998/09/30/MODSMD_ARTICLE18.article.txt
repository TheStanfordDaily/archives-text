The administration and
faculty help bring students
and profs closer together

ONE OF THE privileges of attend
ing a prestigious research univer
sity like Stanford is the opportu
nity to interact with some of the top pro
fessors and researchers in the world.
Many students, however, never find the
time or chance to meet with and get to
know their favorite professors.
With this in mind, the University has
wisely put many resources and much time
into the formation of seminars where stu
dents can work with faculty in small
groups. The University's commitment is
paying off this year, when enough intro
ductory seminars will be offered to acco
modate the entire freshman class.
It is in the University's interest to
devote substantial resources to small
group seminars for freshmen and sopho
mores. A recent study of undergraduate
eduction by the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Eduction found that
the development of faculty-student rela
tionships is one of the most successful
ways of promoting student success during
college. This same study also found most
undergraduate institutions lacking in the
means to develop these relationships, and
it especially faulted top research universi
ties like Harvard and Columbia.
Stanford has long offered many pro
grams designed to foster faculty-student
mentoring. These include Sophomore

College, Honors College, and Structured
Liberal Education. In the past, however,
many students did not know about these
opportunities, If they did know, they were
not highly encouraged to apply by the
University, their professors, or their peers.
This has all changed over the past few
years. The Stanford Introductory Semi
nars Course Catalog was sent to all fresh
men and sophomores with course descrip
tions, contact phone numbers, frequently
asked questions and faculty bios to make
them aware of the resources the office
provides and encourage every freshman
and sophomore to enroll in a seminar.
The Introductory Seminars Program
Office is not the only group to thank for
this stepped-up effort. Without the com
mitment of many members of the faculty
who volunteered to teach seminars in
addition to their normal class loads, the
number of seminars offered would have
remained small and restricted. Instead,
sophomore seminars and dialogues have
increased by almost 400 percent since
1993.
The only concern we have is that many
juniors and seniors getting ready to gradu
ate did not have these opportunities to
develop meaningful relationships with
faculty members.
While those students are certainly par
tially to blame for this missing component
of their education, the University has
taken a long time to ensure that all stu
dents have the opportunity to interact
with faculty in a small setting. This year's
freshmen and sophomores are lucky the
University is moving quickly in the right
direction.
