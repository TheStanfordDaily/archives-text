## Sunshine and SLE can coexist 
### 
Jon Reider

Much has
been said about
the intellectual
life, or the dearth of it,
among Stanford under
graduates. As an admis
sions officer, I confront
this issue often, especially

on the East Coast. "Sure," people tell me,
"Stanford's a great school, lots of fun.
great weather, name-brand recognition
for the degree, etc., but it's just not all that
intellectually deep. Too many palm trees,
too much sunshine."
I have two answers to this.
First, you may be imagining a Stanford
of the '50s or '70s, but it has changed. A
cynic once suggested that Stanford faculty
and students had an implicit pact to leave
each other alone as much as possible.
Highly overstated, even back then, but
the barb still stings.
Second, there is a lot of intellectual life
here, but you just have to look for it. You
can find it in Stanford Introductory Semi
nars. Sophomore College, Honors Col
lege, President's Scholars, and great
demand for Undergraduate Research
Opportunities and departmental research

grants. Last year, 1,270 undergraduates
did independent studies with a faculty
member. The administration has devoted
significant energy and resources to these
initiatives. And they are not done yet —
plans are afoot to link housing with intro
ductory seminars and maybe Introduction
to the Humanities.
There has also been a long-running
success in intellectual culture called Struc
tured Liberal Education. It's not for
everybody, but it does provide a safe
opportunity to discuss ideas at dinner
without being ridiculed. Friday night, my
all-SLE frosh advisees launched into a
discussion of the contradictions of myth in
the Ramayana during dinner at my house.
What is sad is that all SLE students
instantly encounter the suspicion of being
"SLE nerds" upon getting here. They
hear they are too studious, have no
extracurricular activities, and have no fun.
The SLE T-shirt a few years ago mocked
this by featuring a caricature of Nietzsche
saying, "Why I am so clever. Why I read
such good books. Why I have so few
friends."
Recently, I met a very bright student
whose parents wouldn't let him take SLE

because they imagined it would hamper
his social options. We both laughed about
it because at that moment he was with a
very attractive and lively companion who
had been in SLE.
I am not criticizing students, who arrive
here as unfinished products. They come
here honestly and openly in search of
many things, not all of them intellectual.
You can't blame the Greek system, ath
letics or our proximity to Silicon Valley.
Our job at this University is to educate, to
transform, to enlighten. In fact, 1 have
found over the years that the greatest fun
of teaching here is working with those
who have just come alive to ideas, not
necessarily those with the greatest sophis
tication or secondary preparation.
But I share the desire for more intellec
tual discussion among undergraduates.
Let's go beyond the rhetorical, "What's
up?" at the post office or the dinner table.
Although an anthropologist might dis
agree, you change culture by changing
yourself. At the very least, you can have
fun trying.
