Don't blame mess on Res Ed
The ASSU has made an important con
tribution to the entire campus community
through its development of the ASSIJ Com
munity Calendar. The ASSU deserves a big
thanks for taking the initiative on this thorny
global problem.
1 wonder though why the Stanford Daily
devoted so much space in Monday's editori
al to blaming Residential Education for not
coming up with a solution. It only clouded
the ASSI I's success.
E-mail has become a major means of
communication — it is fast, efficient, and
easy. Student use of e-mail has grown expo
nentially in the past live years. Residential
Education did not create the e-mail
morass — everyone who uses e-mail to com
municate and advertise events has created
the chaos. Nor can Residential Education be
expected to solve all of the problems created
by e-mail. Before e-mail we had stacks of
fliers that resident assistants were asked by
students and other campus organizations
and departments to post and deliver, which
created huge paper waste on this campus. E
mail has made RAs lives easier, not harder.
The issue is not what Residential Educa
tion has or has not done about information
dissemination, but the question is what wc
ALL — students, faculty and staff — are
doing to create the e-mail problem and to

contribute to its solution. Let's face it, e-mail
and the Internet are revolutionizing a lot of
things, and we all have to adjust. We need to
learn how to use them effectively and
responsibly, which means developing norms
for its proper and appropriate use. I think
most of us agree that cluttering e-mail boxes
with several copies of an e-mail is inappro
priate; sending out e-mail to announce
events on the day of —or just hours
before — the event is inappropriate; reply
ing to an entire list when a response is meant
for one individual is inappropriate. Beyond
this the definition of "appropriate" becomes
murky. Is using e-mail to announce found
keys appropriate? Is using e-mail to send
jokes? Is advertising extra tickets to events?
And who decides what is appropriate?
Students have different interests and
needs. How can one organization be respon
sible for deciding what announcement
should or should not go out? It is not the
Office of Residential Education's job to cen
sor e-mail, nor is it the RA's role to do so.
The ASSU Community Calendar is a
tremendous step forward in helping the
Stanford community deal with the e-mail
explosion. The cause for their celebration is
not made stronger by blaming others for
what they didn't do, but by applauding the
ASSU for finding the resources to help solve
an important problem on this campus.
It is up to all of us to use this new tool to

make our announcements and to encourage
the campus community to use the ASSII
Community Calendar to see what is being
offered on this amazing campus. The RAs I
know will appreciate this as well.

As I read Melora Krebs-Carter's column,
I remembered that 1 too had looked forward
to spending nights discussing Plato in my
freshman dorm, and I recall how dejected I
was to discover the lack of intellectualism in
the residences of this campus.
But why is that so? Stanford perennially
attracts (and admits) only the most well
rounded and intelligent of students, those
who would presumably be able to see that
ideas in Plato's "Republic" have applications
outside of classical studies. Moreover, most
students come here seeking precisely what
Krebs-Carter sought: an intellectual educa
tion.
One would think, therefore, that placing
intellectually motivated and capable stu
dents in close living quarters would
inevitably result in those discussions that
Krebs-Carter and I so passionately envi
sioned. If this culture is not a reality, then

there must be some force that is opposing it.
I propose that the lack of an intellectual
culture at Stanford is in part due to Stan
lord's (and particularly Residential Educa
tion's) blind focus on community. This nar
rowly pursued goal of community at anv-cost
is fundamentally opposed to intellectualism.
A community is defined by the things that
its members hold in common, and the
strength of that community is proportional
to I) the number of those things and 2) how
important the members believe those things
arc.
By "things." I am referring to anything
that a person considers relevant to her / his
identity, including past experiences, racial
heritage, political beliefs, or career goals. It is
not a coincidence that the ethnic theme
dorms on campus have the strongest com
munities: Most of the residents share an
interest in or identification with the ethnicity
upon which the dormitory is based.
But most students in dorms do not have
many things of significance in common. In
fact, Stanford ensures that each dorm has a
great deal of diversity. There are two paths
that resident assistants can take in trying to
meld these disparate students irlfb a commu
nity.
First, they can call upon our mutual desire
to seek an intellectual education. A commu
nity founded upon this would be strong
indeed, since we all consider intellectualism

an important part of ourselves (else why
come here?). But intellectualism is not an
easy thing to build a community upon; it
involves arguing and fighting, it demands
that residents he able to prove the validity of
their points of view. A community founded
upon intellectualism will not seem like a
community for a while.
So resident assistants take the second
path. This is the formation of a false commu
nity. one that is based upon things that we do
not value at all. How many of us consider
Flicks. Stanford football games or ski trips to
be central to our identities? Moreover, stu
dents are encouraged to not be intellectual,
since any probing will reveal the flimsy web
on which a dorm community is based.
I implore Residential Education to stop
its warm and fuzzy policy of encouraging
blind acceptance of others and start building
real communities. I suggest that those com
munities be founded upon the one important
trait that we do have in common: our desire
for an intellectual environment. If that
means people will yell at one another in
dorm halls, if that means people get their
feelings hurt, then so be it. The result will be
much more rewarding, and the community
much more real than the effervescent fairy
tale that exists today.
