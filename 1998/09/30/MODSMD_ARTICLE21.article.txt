The Stanford men's golf team
came through strong yesterday, fin
ishing second to Oregon at the
Husky Classic in Point Orchard,
Wash. Although the Cardinal tied
the Ducks' score at 1,041 for 54
holes, Oregon won the tournament
in a one-hole sudden death playoff.
In the playoff, each of the six
Cardinal and Duck golfers were al
lowed to play a par-four hole. The
Oregon team combined for a two
under 22 while the Stanford squad
shot a one-over 25.
The Ducks came through in the
clutch with three golfers sinking
hirdies in the sudden-death round.
The Cardinal's finish is a good
sign that the Cardinal is ready to re
enter the national picture as a colle
giate powerhouse, a position it has
fallen from since Tiger Woods left
for the PGA three years ago.
"I thought this year's team
would start us on the way baek,"
said coach Wally Goodwin. "Two
of our sophomores that went didn't
play any varsity events last year.
But they worked on their game all
summer. It added more depth than
I thought we ever had.
"I think the internal competition
within the team will be good for us.
It's going to be a fairly powerful
team. I think one sophomore we
have, Jimmy Lee, is going to work
his way up to play almost with Joel
[Kribel) and Dusty [Brett]."
The Cardinal was followed by
BYU and Northwestern, who tied
for third at 1,095, and fifth-place
California, who scored 1,107.
