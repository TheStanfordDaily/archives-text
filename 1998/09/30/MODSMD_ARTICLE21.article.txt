## Brett places first at Husky invite Golf 2nd in Seattle 
### Kris Andeen 
The Stanford men's golf team
came through strong yesterday, fin
ishing second to Oregon at the
Husky Classic in Point Orchard,
Wash. Although the Cardinal tied
the Ducks' score at 1,041 for 54
holes, Oregon won the tournament
in a one-hole sudden death playoff.
In the playoff, each of the six
Cardinal and Duck golfers were al
lowed to play a par-four hole. The
Oregon team combined for a two
under 22 while the Stanford squad
shot a one-over 25.
The Ducks came through in the
clutch with three golfers sinking
hirdies in the sudden-death round.
The Cardinal's finish is a good
sign that the Cardinal is ready to re
enter the national picture as a colle
giate powerhouse, a position it has
fallen from since Tiger Woods left
for the PGA three years ago.
"I thought this year's team
would start us on the way baek,"
said coach Wally Goodwin. "Two
of our sophomores that went didn't
play any varsity events last year.
But they worked on their game all
summer. It added more depth than
I thought we ever had.
"I think the internal competition
within the team will be good for us.
It's going to be a fairly powerful
team. I think one sophomore we
have, Jimmy Lee, is going to work
his way up to play almost with Joel
[Kribel) and Dusty [Brett]."
The Cardinal was followed by
BYU and Northwestern, who tied
for third at 1,095, and fifth-place
California, who scored 1,107.
Key players in the two-day tour
nament were senior captain and All-
American Kribel and junior Brett.
The latter, a rising star for the Cardi
nal, finished first in the tournament,
scoring 2()9. seven under par, in 54
holes.
Notable was Brett's tournament

and career-low 67 in the final round
yesterday. He preceded this with
scores of 74 and 68 on the par-72
Olympic North Golf Course.
"Dusty's going to give Joel a lot
of competition throughout the
year," Goodwin said. "He has made
himself a really good player. He's
got a great mental attitude toward
golf, and that's about 90 percent of it
right there. He'll give Joel all he can
handle."

Brett's victory was especially re
warding as the Tacoma native was
able to play less than 30 miles away
from home. Supporters came out in
droves to cheer him on.
Kribel, ranked fifth in the nation
by the Master Card Collegiate Golf
Foil, was close behind Brett, shoot
ing 212, four under par, and tying for
second with golfers from Oregon,
Washington, and Northwestern. His
scores were 73,70 and 69.
The tournament marks a good
start for the Cardinal, which placed
sixth in the Pacific 10 Conference
last season.
Thanks to drier weather, the
team could potentially contend for
the Pac-10 title this season.
Other finishes for the Cardinal
included sophomore Lee's 17th
place tie (220), sophomore Eric
Dahlberg's 31st-place tie (225),
sophomore Alex Aragon's 42nd
place tie (230) and Rudy Barreto
51st-place tie (234).
