# Cobb ready to take women back to top
## 
### Barry Cooper 
Last year on Nov. 24, the Stanford women's
cross country team came just shy of a repeat of
its 19% championship season. It were handed
its first defeat of the year when the No. 2-
ranked women from Brigham Young edged it
by two points at the NCAA Championships at
Furman University in Greensboro, S.C.
That race was an emotional conclusion to a
memorable season, one in which the Cardinal
was ranked No. 1 until the very end. Reality did
not turn out as sweet as the women had
dreamed. For the captain of this year's squad,
senior Mary Cobb, second place was not an
easy feeling.
"It was hard because we prepared all season
to come out on top," Cobb said. "It was a shock.
There was no reason why we shouldn't have
won. It was a fluke."
The team had to move on and for collegiate
runners that means competing in indoor track.
For many of the Cardinal women, the cross
country season clearly provided a firm base of
both conditioning and confidence to take with
them into the indoor as well as the outdoor
track season.
Apparently, it also added motivation to
compete on a high level. Of the seven women
who ran at Furman, two went on to earn All-
America honors in track and then-freshman
Ann Ramsey represented the United States at
the I.A.A.F. Junior Cross Country Champi
onships held in Morocco.
Unlike her teammates, Mary Cobb could
not use that motivation on the track. Just two
months after her 22nd-place performance at
cross country Nationals, which earned her a
third-straight Ail-American award, she suf
fered a stress fracture in a metatarsal in her left
foot.
Different from the more common injury of
runners, stress fractures in the shins, this injury
had no warning signs. Mary remembers, "One
morning I just woke up and my foot really
hurt."
It was not the best of news for Cobb, espe
cially considering that she feels her all out
speed is an asset better taken advantage of on
the track than on the cross country course.
Cobb put it simply, "I have the speed that
works in the end for track."

She speaks the truth. In 1997 she finished
second in the 5,000 meters at the outdoor
NCAA Championships. When Cobb was told
by the team's doctor that she would not be able
to compete until this fall, she was disappointed
to say the least.
Fortunately, Cobb seems to view things in
their proper perspective. "It was good in a lot of
ways. It was good to have a break. When I came
back to training I knew it was something I
wanted," Cobb said. Not running for a while
seems to have focused Cobb more than ever.
So far this season she has placed third in her
two races and has finished as the top Cardinal
woman both times.
"I am really enjoying running and I'm more
comfortable now with running as a part of my
life than ever before," Cobb said. "I know how
happy it makes me feel."
Not only is Cobb back in action and running
strong, but she has been handed the responsi
bility of being captain this season to a team with
six freshman faces. Cobb gladly accepted the
job.
"Its exciting. You're a role model and
you've got to help the freshmen with questions.
The best part is being captain of this team. Our
team is very young and fresh and alive. I'm so
lucky," explained Cobb.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna does not
feel the title of captain will change the way
Cobb approaches cross country. "Cobb has
been leading since the first day she arrived on
campus," Lananna said.
But Cobb isn't just a happy-go-lucky girl.
Nor is she shy about talking about touchy sub
jects.
"I don't know why I ran 22nd" at Nationals
she said. "It was not my goal to finish (22nd).
The competition is good, but I see myself bet
ter than I placed. I don't know what happened,
but I don't want it to happen again."
Lananna was not as hard on Cobb.
"Athletics is about ups and downs. Cobb
just didn't have her best day at NCAAs,"
Lananna said.
Despite what Lananna says, Cobb will not
forget the meet last year. "It's really hard to for
get about it and I'm not going to forget about it.
It makes you hungrier," she said- *

Senior captain Mary Cobb, returning from a foot injury that forced her to miss last
year's track season, is aiming to lead the women's cross country team back to the
first-place podium at the NCAAs.
And that hunger has carried over
into this season.
"I'm feeling really great so far.
My goal for each race is to be strong.
I'm not worrying about the outcome
so much, but it does matter. Yet, I'm
not going to beat myself up. I am
willing to take the risks required to
succeed. At Nationals, I definitely
want to be up there."
One thing the past year has clear
ly taught Cobb is not to take any
thing for granted. Still, that has not

stopped her from setting goals for
after this season.
"I want to be at an even higher
collegiate level," she said. "I want to
win [an NCAA] title for myself.
That's what I'm striving for."
After college, Cobb has high
aims as well.

"Competing in Olympic trials
and making the team is something
I've always been dreaming about."
• Assistant coach Beth Alford-Sul
livan thinks she has a great shot.
"Cobb came to Stanford the same
year as I." said Alford-Sullivan.
"Over four years her intensity level
has been consistently high. What has

really grown is her perspective.
Cobb has everything in the right per
spective. Wherever she sets her
goals is what she can achieve. Tal
ent-wise she's phenomenal."
Thus far, five All-American sea
sons have not kept Cobb from her
academics. A pre-med student, she.
plans to earn her degree in psychol
ogy. Eventually, she plans to attend I
medical school to study either psy
chology or pediatrics.
If her running career continues in
the way its headed, eventually may
be later than sooner. Sydney is call
ing in 2(XX). One thing is certain: the
future is bright for Cobb.
