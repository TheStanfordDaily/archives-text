MOUNTAIN BIKING: The cy
cling team has just finished the track
portion of its season and is now get
ting started in the mountain biking
portion of the year. ITie cycling
team was very successful in last
week's track national competition
by claiming third place and having
MD / Ph.D. student Megan Troxell
claim the women's' overall title.
Sept. 27 was the first competition
for this year's mountain circuit.
Stanford finished second at the
Nevada-Reno Sneak Preview Cross
Country race. The race takes its
name from the fact that in just a few
weeks' time (Nov. 7 and 8) the na
tional finals of mountain biking will
take place at the same course.
"These races are in three differ
ent categories - from beginner to in
termediate to advanced riders. Rac
ing with our team is therefore a re
ally cool experience for all aspects
of riders," said captain John Bilder
beck. "The other large component
of the club is offering recreational

rides to anyone who would like to
attend, in order to promote moun
tain biking as more than just a com
petitive sport."
The Cardinal amassed 619
points to take second place behind
host Nevada-Reno, which tallied
768 points. No other team came
within 2(X) points of Stanford.
Standout performances were
provided by first-year MBA stu
dents Jamie McJunkin, who fin
ished second in the men's A divi
sion, and Rebecca van I lazinga,
who finished first in the women's B
division. Both McJunkin and van
Hazinga made their collegiate bik
ing competition debuts at the meet.
Also giving a notable perfor
mance for the Cardinal was coter
minal Erin Kassoy, who decisively
won the women's A division cross
country race by a margin of more
than four minutes. Sophomore For
est Ray finished second in the men's
B division.
Stanford will host a mountain
biking event Oct. 17 and 18 at a
course in San Jose.
CRICKET: The Stanford C rick
et team is well into its season, play
ing a schedule which begins in the
spring and goes through the sum
mer and into fall quarter.
The goal of this year's season
was to win the B division in order to
be advanced into the A division. In
1997, the team finished second in
the league and also captured the six
a-side and the eight-a-side tourna
ment trophies. Stanford was poised
to continue this trend into the 1998
season.
This year's six-a-side tourna
ment did not end as planned. The
Cardinal entered two teams into the
tournament and both were elimi
nated by the second round. Quickly
showing their potential, though, the
team won its first league match by 94
runs.
Since then Stanford has been
plagued by a number of injuries and
player unavailability and has won
only three of 14 league games
throughout the season.

However, with the start of the
new academic year, the team has
been bolstered by an influx of new
players. The team has the Bank of
India Knock-Out Tournament to
start Oct. 11.
The team is lead by captain and
opening bowler Rohan Chandran,
post-doctorate student Dominic
Griffiths, opening batsman
Hrishikesh Mandvam. leading bats

man Atul Khanzode and wicket
keeper and top batsman Madan
Kumar.
One significant recent addition to
the team is Australian Marcus Stood
ley. Stoodley has played high-level
cricket in Australia and now joins the
Stanford team as a neurosurgeon
with the Stanford Hospital. Stoodley
is the best all-around player on the
Cardinal side.
