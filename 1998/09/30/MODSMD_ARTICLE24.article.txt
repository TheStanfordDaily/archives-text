Never in senior l iaeye Lawyer's
wildest freshman dreams, as a walk
on to the soccei team and a jumpei
on the track team, did she expect to
accomplish so much on the I arm.
Although it may have been her
destiny to become a great athlete
her father, a political science profes
sor. played basketball and track at
Princeton, her mother was a stand
out track athlete in high school and
her two brothers both ran track in
college and one played football
Lawyer has exceeded even her own
expectations.
Lawyer is an important part of
both the women's soccer team and
the women's track team. Athletics
have been an important part of her
family and, not surprisingly, she
learned manv of her skills at the

hand of her two older brothers grow
ing up in Santa Barbara.
Lawyer remembers rough-hous
ing with them, but more importantly
looking up to them, hoping she
would one day be as good an athlete
;is they were.
"They made me tough," Lawyer
said. "But it paid off through the
years. I'm not a wimp."
Now. however, they are her
biggest fans along with her parents.
Last weekend, her father surprised
her and made the five-hour drive
from Santa Barbara to watch Stan
lord play Santa Clara and her moth
er routinely flies from Texas to
watch Lawyer compete.
"I was lucky because I had cool
parents who just let me go," Lawyer
said. "I am so lucky to have been
able to play two sports, it's been a
great lesson for life."
Lawyer also receives "hundreds

of e-mails" from her brothers, who
keep close track of how Stanford and
their star little sister are doing.
They have had a lot to follow.
Coming out of Kate High School
in Santa Barbara, Lawyer was quick
ly made into a heptathlete on the
Stanford track team. In high school,
she competed in four out of the
seven events and picked up the other
three quickly.
Since then, she has gathered four
All-America honors in the event in
the past two years, both in the indoor
and outdoor seasons. She is the 1997
and 1998 winner of the Pacific 10
Conference heptathlon and she took
second place in the event at nation
als last year and was sixth in the high
jump. The California State high
jump champion her sophomore year
of high school, Lawyer is still
stronger at jumping and hates the
(S(K)-meter race.

As for soccer. Lawyer was the
second leading scorer for the Cardi
nal last year and was named First-
Team All Pac-10. This year she has
been instrumental in the Cardinal's
(5-1-2) success and leads the team in
scoring.
Lawyer, a biology major, does
have plans after she graduates to
train for at least a year in track to try
and make the 2000 Olympics. She
plans to eventually become a pedia
trician, her lifelong dream, but
hasn't figured soccer out of the equa
tion yet.
"Soccer is my favorite sport and I
feel I have a lot of room to improve,"
Lawyer said. "I have a better chance
to make the Olympics in track but
soccer is still there and always will
be."
It hasn't always been that way.
After a frustrating freshman year,
Lawyer considered quitting the
team and concentrating solely on
track. However, head coach Steve
Swanson was brought in as the new
coach and Lawyer changed her
mind.
Because of her experience as a
freshman, she has tried especially
hard to make the rookies feel wel
come. Lawyer attributes much of the
team's success to the chemistry it
feels off the field.
"It's all coming together,"
Lawyer said. "The first year was a
sort of experiment, last year many
people were injured but this year
everyone is healthy and we all un
derstand the strategy and what
works well."
Playing two sports has never been
a burden for Lawyer and skills de
veloped in each sport have helped
the other. Her speed and jumping
ability has helped her soccer game
and the heavy conditioning regimen
during soccer season has helped her
track skills, especially in the dreaded
800-meter race.
"Everyone on the soccer team
has different roles and I am the
