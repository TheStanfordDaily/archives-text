# Stanford land may go for PA shelter

The Community Working
Group, a coalition of Stanford pro
fessors and local religious, political
and community leaders, has agreed
on a goal for a day-use center to
provide homeless services for Palo
Alto, Menlo Park and East Palo
Alto.
This project would be the prima
ry response of these cities to the
homeless problem.
One of the sites being consid
ered for the facility is in Palo Alto
behind Mac Arthur Park restau
rant. While not on the main Stan
ford campus, the land is owned by
the University.
"As long as it complies with the
core mission of the University,
which is education, it's within the
charter to build this center on Stan
ford land," said Human Biology
Lecturer Don Barr, the group's
moderator. "Ideally, we'd like to
have Stanford students involved
with service providers in the spirit
of service learning. Classes like Al
bert Camarillo's class on homeless
ness [History 2511 would fit perfect
ly with this center."
Thus far, Stanford has no official
response until more developments
occur. However, in Barr's opinion,
with philosophical agreement with
in such a broad coalition, a center to
address the needs of local homeless
looks to be on its way.
"A wealthy university like Stan
ford, with resources like its stu
dents, faculty and land should defi
nitely help the surrounding com
munity," said sophomore Alexis
Kaminsky, founder of Stanford Ad
vocates for Children and a student
in Camarillo's Sophomore College
class on homelessness in America.
"It's an excellent idea."
The proposed S,(KK)- to 6,000-
square-foot center would offer sev
eral types of service. Facilities avail
able to all clients on weekdays

would include, but not be limited to,
showers, haircuts, clothing, toilets
and hot breakfasts. A message ser
vice for mail and phone calls is also
planned, along with Internet termi
nals and newspapers.
On a more involved level, the
center would provide case-specific
services, such as basic medical and
mental health examinations and re
ferrals, including substance abuse
and group counseling. Housing and
emergency shelter assistance, job
skills training, legal help, women's
services and money management
would also be offered.
A third level of community in
volvement would address the con
flicts between the homeless and
local merchants. Programs such as
intervention teams to diffuse hos
tile incidents and community edu
cation about the problem of home
lessness are included in the coali
tion's philosophy.
Another integral part of the
group's philosophy is addressing
those families who are at risk of be
coming homeless.
The coalition was born during
the worst month of El Nino. Last
February, the small room and patio
at the Palo Alto Red Cross building
that had been serving as a drop-in
center for the homeless fell victim
to the flooding that claimed many
local buildings.
An original group was formed,
consisting of the Urban Ministry of
Palo Alto, Stanford, the city of Palo
Alto and Peninsula Interfaith Ac
tion, a coalition of local churches. It
has since grown broader, and now
includes Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties, the Jewish Com
munity Relations Council, the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, the
Haas Center for Public Service, An
other Way and the American Red
Cross, among others.
Already the group has funding
from the Hancock Foundation and
a challenge grant from the Packard
Foundation.
