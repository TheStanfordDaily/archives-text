# Situation improved, but not perfect
## Disabled access changes reviewed 
### Berra Yazar Staff writer 
Over the summer, the University
made campus-wide changes to in
crease the accessibility of buildings,
but many disabled students say that
the University still has not done
enough.
The most obvious renovations
were made in the Cowell Cluster
and Lagunita Court, which were
renovated over the summer as part
of the University's Capital Improve
ment Plan.
"We removed barriers and made
entrances, rooms, restrooms, show
ers and community spaces accessi
ble. We also added units in Escondi
do Village for graduate students, in
creasing the places in which disabled
students can be accommodated,"
said Rosa Gonzalez, who monitors
disability access for the Office for
Multicultural Development.
However, many campus build
ings still do not yet meet accessibili
ty standards. "All new construction
and modifications must be accessi
ble to individuals with disabilities.
For existing facilities, barriers to ser
vices must be removed if readily
achievable," according to the Amer
icans With Disabilities Act.
This entails signs and elevators

marked with Braille, hand rails, stop
signs and general wheelchair acces
sibility.
The University has made some
changes in light of the ADA. Yet
there are many details that continue
to make life hard for disabled stu
dents.
Senior Miriam Rocke, a Kimball
resident who is disabled, said that
"It's getting better, and this is one of
the best college campuses I've seen,
but it's still not perfect."
She especially emphasized that
libraries and classroom buildings are
hard to enter, and that the elevators
in most buildings don't work or are
hard to use.
"The DRC is good about moving
the class where possible, but some
times we don't realize it doesn't
work until we get there."
Rocke mentioned that she had
trouble finding a sophomore year
residence because most dorms were
not accessible.
"A door that's too heavy, corri
dors that are too narrow, corners
that are too tight, washing machines
that are top-loading" can really be
annoying. Rocke added.
Senior Karin Willison, another
disabled Kimball resident, is also
unhappy with the inaccessibility of
classes. "I got stuck with Miriam in

the Hum Bio building's elevator last
year. We had section on the second
floor, and we got on the elevator. It
went all the way to the second floor
but stopped a foot from the landing.
It was a nightmare," she said.
In response to these complaints,
the University will make even more
changes. "We are about to embark
on an ambitious program with the
ADA Task Force, which includes
the renovation of several hundred
buildings," Gonzalez said.
"In terms of the University, it's
probably going to be a five-year pro
gram;" she added. "It's going to be
an aggressive, accelerated, prioritiz
ing program â€” our goal being to
provide equal opportunity and ac
cess to all academic programs and
services."
Every school receiving federal
funding must make residences and
classes accessible to disabled stu
dents. "Since Stanford is in this cate
gory, they have to make these
changes, or they won't get the
money," said Eric Horn, office man
ager of the Disability Resource Cen
ter.
The funding for the renovations
coming up will come from the ongo
ing Capital Improvement Plan,
which is in year seven of the 12-year
plan, and from the ADA Facility

Reserve Fund for the general cam
pus barrier removal. This source was
authorized by the Provost's Office,
according to Gonzalez.
In the summer of 1997, Evan
Terry and Associates, a private com
pany, reviewed all the buildings and
roads on campus. This summer, the
ADA Task Force sorted through
these surveys. They will meet again
in October to review priorities and
criteria for selecting buildings to
renovate.
The changes made this summer
were not made simply with disabled
students in mind. The safety of all
students is at top priority. "We
thought that the road from Tresid
der to Florence Moore was not safe
enough," Gonzalez said, "so we
added stop signs."
Some disabled students are en
thusiastic about the developments
in accessibility. "A student was
telling me that he was 'real pleased
with the paths through the Quad.' "
Gonzalez said.
An elevator will be installed this
year in Kimball Hall, which is one of
the most accessible dorms for dis
abled students. Gonzalez said that
although construction was planned
for the summer, demands of plan
ning have delayed the elevator in
stallation until winter quarter.
