# Improved ASSU course guide on line
## 
### Matthew H. Blumenstein Contributing writer 
Thanks to the ASSU, an online
course guide providing statistical as
well as qualitative information on
over 2,(MX) Stanford courses is now
available on the Internet.
This new service, according to the
World Wide Web site's introduc
tion, revolves around the belief that
the "best way to make decisions
about a class is to get advice from
friends and classmates."
The site is composed of informa
tion put forth on class evaluation
forms at the end of each quarter, as
well as class descriptions copied
from the Stanford Bulletin.
Statistical information, such as
class make-up, time spent on home
work and numerical ratings for class
effectiveness are gleaned from the
standardized section of the evalua
tions. Evaluative comments made
by students on the perforated sec
tion of the forms are also used to cre
ate human reviews of their classes.

The result is a thorough guide to
courses in the School of Humanities
and Sciences with information rang
ing from graphs to frank student
comments. One philosophy student
said his class "treated me like an
abusive spouse." Another statement
warns, "don't take a class offered by
[name withheld) if you like to think
independently."
To compliment these opinions,
students can then learn the average
time spent on homework, the aver
age year of students and other infor
mation.
The guide does not yet have time
schedule information, but this is ex
pected to be fully integrated in the
coming weeks.
Another service in the works is
the ability to search the guide with
criteria such as a professor's name, a
specific time or a needed GER. Ac
cording to the creators, these func
tions are unavailable only because
of a time crunch created by the im
mensity of the project and the small
number of staff.

This year's online guide was cre
ated this summer largely due to the
work of three students, two of
whom worked full-time on the pro
ject. Junior Sacha Zadmehran and
Matthew Pearl, '98, worked full
time sorting through comments, in
tegrating standardized information
and essentially copying the Stanford
Bulletin's class descriptions to the
new site.
Zadmehran and Pearl sorted
through the 1997 course comments
and edited them to boil the com
ments down into a few fair, coher
ent, encompassing comments. Some
particularly telling quotes were en
tered verbatim but most were para
phrased. Zadrehman and Pearl
stayed away from comments regard
ing their areas of study in the interest
of impartiality.
According to Zadmehran, the
sparse amount of comments turned
in by students was frustrating. He es
timates that only about 20 percent of
comment slips were returned by stu
dents. These are the guide's biggest

strength and the need to bolster
their completion is a very important
issue in the guide's future.
ASSU President Maren Norton
believes more students will com
plete the forms "if students feel they
are being put to use for a valuable re
source."
Norton's enthusiasm for this new
creation is apparent. She says they
have already had "a lot of positive
feedback from advising associates,
faculty advisers and students."
Zadmehran insists "the guide is
here to stay," and Norton agrees.
She feels that the ability to get infor
mation from "all the students you
never talk to" will create an in
formed student body with new moti
vation towards excellence in class
and a new means for evaluating it.
If Norton has her way, this new
service will be written into ASSU
by-laws and will continue to grow
and refine itself as an integral part of
Stanford academics.
