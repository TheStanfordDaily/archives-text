## Stanford and the Silicon Valley From Hewlett-Packard to Yahoo 
### Matt Bell 
From the day that Leland Stan
ford declared that his university
should prepare students for "per
sonal success and direct usefulness
in life," Stanford University has
played a vital role in developing the
Bay Area technology industry of
the Silicon Valley. Stanford's pro
research attitude has inspired sever
al generations of students and has
led to groundbreaking joint ven
tures with high-tech companies.
Countless Stanford graduates
and professors have applied their
educations to produce successful
businesses. During the height of the
Cireal Depression, two Stanford
students, Bill Hewlett and David
Packard, were encouraged by their
engineering teacher Frederick Ter
man (of Terman Engineering Cen
ter) to use their ideas in an
entrepreneurial venture.
The resulting partnership,
Hewlett-Packard, is now one of the
most influential corporations in Sil

icon Valley. In fact, the garage
where their work began in 1939, cel
ebrated as the "Birthplace of Sili
con Valley," is now a state land
mark.
The list of industry-founding
alums does not stop with Hewlett
and Packard, however.
Marcian (Ted) Hoff, another
Stanford graduate, invented the
microchip at Intel. Arch-rivals Sili
con Graphics and SUN Microsys
tems (which incidentally stands for
Stanford University Network) were
both started by Stanford graduates.
More recently, both the Yahoo! and
Excite Web search engines were
produced entirely by Stanford tal
ent.
Stanford academic programs
also facilitated the growth of the
technology industry in the Bay
Area.
After World War 11, Frederick
Terman worked to establish a close
link between academia and industry
by facilitating communication
between professors and industry

leaders. Terman also began exten
sive recruiting programs and orga
nized "steeples of excellence,"
groups of highly skilled students
working together in the applied sci
ences.
Terman's new program soon
took the form of the Stanford
Research Institute, founded as a
joint venture between University
researchers and local businesses.
The participating companies and
students formed a symbiotic rela
tionship â€” the students performed
cutting-edge research for the com
panies, who provided funding and
benefitted from their innovations.
Many crucial devices of the modern
computer industry, including the
ink jet printer, mouse, modem and
optical disc, were invented at SRI.
However, many of Stanford's
contributions to the Silicon Valley
grew out of financial necessity. In
the early 19505, Stanford was facing
serious financial difficulties and
needed to expand to remain com
petitive with other universities.

Stanford professor Russell Vari
an suggested a plan to lease part of
Stanford's land as an industrial park
where technology-related compa
nies could settle and develop close
ties with the University. In 1953, the
Stanford Industrial Park was found
ed on a small corner of Stanford's
land near Page Mill Road.
Hewlett-Packard was among the
first companies to move there, and
the park grew rapidly. Within five
years, it was featured at the World
Expo in Brussels. Soon, important
companies such as Lockheed,
Xerox and Ampex set up their West
Coast operations in the park. As the
work done at the park rose in size
and importance, the Silicon Valley
began to develop around it.
Stanford did not single-handedly
create the Silicon Valley. But with
out the creativity of Stanford gradu
ates and the close University-indus
try relationship, the Silicon Valley
would not he the world-reknowned
center of technological innovation
that it is today.
