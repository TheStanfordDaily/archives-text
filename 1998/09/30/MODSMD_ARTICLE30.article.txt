# Putting knowledge to profitable use
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
Ever since Stanford alumni-
William Hewlett and David
Packard founded Hewlett-Packard
next to campus in the 19305, Stan
ford students have shared a symbi
otic relationship with Silicon Valley.
Each year, fresh-faced Stanford
students provide the lifeblood of
dozens of companies in the area. In
return, students get the chance to
work on innovative projects on the
cusp of the industries' next big
thing.
The working relationship
between Stanford students and the
computer industry often begins
with summer internships.
Judy Hay, Class of '98, worked
for Hewlett-Packard in Boise,
Idaho for two summers during her
undergraduate days as a computer
science major. She now works at
Hewlett-Packard in Mountain
View, updating a Web browser
designed to remove glitches from
the process of printing pages off the
Web.
The main challenge in updating
Hewlett-Packard's original soft
ware, I lay said, was to make it more
user-friendly. The developers "were
much more into function than user
interface," Hay explained.

The upgraded browser, HP Web
Print Smart, will allow users to see
Web pages in the browser window
before they are printed, and will
format the pages with a table of
contents and an index. The printing
service is available on the Web at
www.hp.com/go/webprintsmart.
At another high-profile Silicon
Valley address —Intel — Patrick
Neschleba, '98, works with the Fab
Capital Equipment Development
department on the selection and
improvement of semiconductor
equipment. Neschleba meets with
suppliers of the equipment and
helps determine whether the pro
cessors meet Intel's standards.
Neschleba says the job requires
application of economics as well as
materials science and chemical
engineering, which he studied as an
undergraduate chemical engineer
ing major and as a master's student
in materials science and engineer
ing.
Stanford students are getting
their foot in the door at start-ups as
well as with industry giants. Senior
Chris Kramer, a computer science
major, spent the summer at the Sili
con Valley Networking Lab. The
lab, which was launched in May. is
modeled on already-existing labs at
Harvard University and the Univer
sity of New Hampshire, which pro

vide services for larger computer
companies.
Kramer is involved in a project
that tests devices that will eventual
ly increase the speed of Internet
access over fiberoptic phone lines.
The project aims to improve the 56
kilobyte-per-second speed of
today's modems to a future level of
one megabit per second.
Compaq, AT&T, Intel, Lucent
Technologies, ADM and 3Com are
among the eleven companies work
ing to develop devices based on the
original networking technology pio
neered by Tut Systems. For now,
Kramer and others at the lab are
making sure these devices perform
as fast and accurately as they can.
The shared culture of Stanford
and Silicon Valley creates a gener
ally easy transition from life at
school to life in the industry — or
an easy overlap, in the case of stu
dents continuing their summer
internships into the school year.
"It's a very relaxed work envi
ronment — not like the East Coast,
where everyone is in suits and ties,"
Neschleba said. "But it is very driv
en. There is a good balance
between work and play, a Stanford
attitude which carries over well."
Whether their work involves
interactions primarily with engi
neers, suppliers, old hands or new

blood, students and alumni working
in the Valley enjoy the general
dynamism and excitement of the
environment.
"You meet people, from start
ups they began 20 years ago, who
are really excited about making
new ideas happen and are exciting
to meet. They are just glowing with
entrepreneurial enthusiasm."
Neschleba said. The entrepreneuri
al spirit has infected Neschleba and
Hay, who both regard a start-up of
their own as an attractive possibili
ty-
Not all Silicon Valley jobs fit into
the young, start-up stereotype, how
ever. Hay is working with a team of
men that has been together for fif
teen years.
Working in Silicon Valley also
has the advantage of providing all
the scenic distractions of the Bay
Area — providing you can leave
the office to enjoy them. Hay says
she hopes to spend more time in
Mountain View, though "it depends
on how many upgrades they let
[me| do."
Although post-Stanford housing
costs can be "a shock" according to
Neschleba, there are bonuses to liv
ing in the area as a non-student.
As Neschleba said, "One of the
things which surprised me is the
campus recovers all of its magic."
