# Gamma and x-ray radiation surprise scientists
## 
### Armen Berjikly 
A powerful burst of gamma and
X-ray radiation passed through
Earth's upper atmosphere on Aug.
27, quickly grabbing the attention of
a group of Stanford researehers
who were conducting routine atmo
spheric observations.
Although the source of the ener
gy w;ts a star over 23.000 light years
away, the flare was powerful
enough to momentarily alter
Earth's upper atmosphere. This
marked the first time such a severe
atmospheric impact could be
attributed to an object outside our
solar system.
"It was as if night was briefly
turned into day in the ionosphere."
said I Jmran Inan. professor of elec
trical engineering and head of the
observation research group.
The ionosphere, found between
60 and (SO kilometers above Earth's
surface, plays a crucial role in radio
communications. For the nearly

five-minute duration of the burst,
the ionosphere's level of electrical
activity usually very low at
night suddenly jumped to much
noisier daytime levels. The range of
high-power radio stations, generally
longer at night due to less iono
spheric activity, was probably
reduced to shorter daytime levels.
Inan said.
Stanford's Very Low Frequency
Research (iroup observed the phe
nomenon using its network of VL.F
radio transmitters. This network is
part of the Holographic Array for
lonospheric Lightning research.
HAIL is normally used for tracking
effects of localized weather occur
rences on the ionosphere. However,
the system was perfect for observ
ing and assessing the impact of the
distant star's eruption.
The radiation blast produced by
the star, named Soft Gamma
Repeater I I XM)+I4. suggests the star
is a rare object called a magnetar. A
magnetar is a type of neutron star.

Neutron stars form when massive
stars explode and leave behind their
extremely dense, compacted cores.
Neutron stars are no larger than
earthly mountains, but they weigh
more than our entire sun.
Magnetars are no ordinary neu
tron stars. They possess the
strongest known magnetic fields.
Intense X-rays and bursts of gamma
and other high-energy rays radiate
from magnetars. Kevin Hurley at
IJ( -Berkeley calculated that the
total energy emanated by SGR
1900+14 in the Aug. 27 flare could
easily power all of human civiliza
tion for a billion billion years.
Of course, only a minute portion
of that energy reached Earth. Scien
tists claim the radiation reaching
our planet had an intensity slightly
less than that of a dental X-ray.
Nevertheless, the flare had a power
ful impact on the ionosphere that
will be discussed at NASA Head
quarters this week. It has also
received widespread attention from

the national science community.
Although this was the first time
such an event was so clearly
observed, Inan is no stranger to the
study of extrasolar energy. In 1988,
Inan and Gerald Fisherman of
NASA reported a similar but much
smaller ionospheric disturbance
attributed to a gamma-ray burst.
Inan's group also studied another
occurrence of this type in 19%.
However, nothing in this category
can compare to the magnitude of
the Aug. 27 disturbance.
Despite the startling effect the
extrasolar energy had on Earth's
upper atmosphere, "There is no
long-term impact," says Inan.
Although the ionosphere was influ
enced by the gamma ray burst as it
passed through the Earth, the iono
sphere returned to its original con
dition once the energy had passed.
Inan reassures that a neutron
star would have to be less than 10
light years away for a similar blast to
bathe the Earth with the same ener

gy that the sun does. Fortunately,
there are no neutron stars in that
region. "All this goes to show that
the Earth does not exist in splendid
isolation," Inan said.

Rather, Inan concluded, "We
now know the Earth's physical envi
ronment is affected not only hy our
own sun, but hy energy originating
from distant parts of the universe."
