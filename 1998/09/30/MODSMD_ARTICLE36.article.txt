# Kickin' it
## Blood, sweat, toil and tears of martial art 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
Editor's Note: We continue our
series on adventures that attempt to
get writers (tut of the Daily office
with I.auren Phillips' brief experi
ence as a kickhoxer. OK, so she was
never actually a kickhoxer, but she
did go to a lesson.

To the sounds of "Eye of the
Tiger," 20 people stretched out on a
gym floor and prepared themselves
for a night of kiekboxing. Wrapping
their wrists with athletic tape and
choosing a pair of gloves, the group
awaited the arrival of its instructor.
The students in the class were
men and women of all ability levels.
Some people had been taking kick
boxing lessons for years. Others had
never tried the sport, and were un
sure of how to go about preparing,
and even less sure how the sparring
gloves in the corner were going to be
used.
The instructor, a well-built twen
ty-something with black hair to his
waist, entered and introduced him
self. He split the group according to
skill level, and gave the more expe
rienced group over to his assistant
teacher.
With ease, he began to lead the
group through the warm up stretch
es. which in themselves seemed a
workout. Kiekboxing uses muscles
not usually used in aerobic exercise,
especially in the upper and lower
back. The main stretch was lateral
twisting to make sure that the stu
dents' backs were well stretched be
fore they began the series of punch
cs and kicks. The new recruits later
found out that these pre-exercises
did nothing to eliminate the sore
ness they would feel the next day.
While the advanced group fin
ished its stretching and began prac
ticing kicks on each other and vari
ous punching bags, the beginning

group was led through the basics:
foot positions.
It didn't sound glamorous, but it
turned out to be important. Before
we could start punching and kick
ing, we had to learn how to move
our feet, and the basic stance for
kiekboxing.
We were anxious to start practic
ing punches with a partner and
gloves, but the instructor insisted we
first learn some punching technique
by practicing by ourselves. The be
ginning group found themselves po
sitioned in front of three full length
mirrors, hands poised at their tem
ple and chin, waiting for the instruc
tor to tell us to punch. We looked
ridiculous.
Soon though, the positioning of
our hands seemed more natural,
and we learned the basic jab which
comes with the right hand. Feeling a
little more like something out of
"Rocky," we began learning combi
nation jabs.
The instructor would call punch
es, and we beginners, like puppies
learning commands in obedience
school, would try to remember how
to perform the punches that he was
calling. After a while we seemed
fairly confident punching at our
own reflections, but realized that
the precision with which we were
throwing punches would probably
do very little to stop an opponent.
Feeling slightly more powerful
and glistening with sweat, the begin
ners group had to face its next chal
lenge. We knew how to stand, we
knew the basic foot movements and
we knew how to do basic punches.
But now. we were asked to combine
punching and foot movement.
It was difficult. Remembering
where to keep your hands while you
also moved your feet turned out to
be like rubbing your stomach and
patting your head. With time it
could be mastered, but it involved a
lot of concentration.

The last activity during the two
hour-long lesson (there was no kick
ing taught to the beginners) was
sparring with a partner. Working
with the assistant, our instructor
showed us the graceful and almost
choreographed look of two people
kickboxing. We were then asked to
pair up, and attempt to imitate
them.
Like two pre-teens at a middle
school dance, the partners awk
wardly tried to move in step and an
ticipate each other's moves.
It was ugly.
Red gloves flew through the air,
in attempts to hit the flat sparring
gloves of those we had been paired
with. The instructor, who was at
tempting to avoid any possible in
jury by calling which jabs we were
supposed to throw, was pacing
around the pairs, correcting their
form which had been all but forgot
ten in attempts to coordinate
punching with staying in position.
At some point, the movements
became more natural. The begin
ners were not only keeping their
form, but they had also added a lit
tle bit of effort to their punches.
We felt invigorated and stress
free. We also felt sore.
While cooling down, we realized
the beauty of kick-boxing. It was a
workout for the mind and the body,
releasing stress and frustration while
making you sweat. And we realized
as we were leaving, that we too were
humming "Eye of the Tiger."
