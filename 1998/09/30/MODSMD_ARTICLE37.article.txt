# Bio prof returns from Africa, wins University teaching award

### Catherine Lau 
For the past twenty years, Biolo
gy Prof. Richard Sapolsky has spent
his summers in Africa studying a
troop of wild baboons. But when
spending so much time off The
Farm, he can sometimes fall behind
the latest campus news — including
his winning this year's Hoagland
Teaching Award.
"I don't know exactly what it is,
other than a nice prize. 1 have even
less of an idea of how someone is
chosen, but it seems to involve a lot
of student input, which is nice," said
Sapolsky.
Chosen by the student body, the
winner is announced annually at Ju
nior Convocation in September. At
the end of each year, students are
given the opportunity to write a short
summary nominating a professor.
The final decision is then made
by a committee of professors and
staff members.
"I have always viewed him as the
ideal of scholarship for cutting edge
research and teaching." said senior
research scientist Bruce O'Hara.
"He is truly a role model and he has
this incredible ability to convey in
formation to his students in class."
Sapolsky's captivating teaching
methods draws crowds of students
to enroll in his highly popular six
unit course titled "Human Behav
ioral Biology" that is offered every
other year.
"I think that he's a fantastic

teacher and that he definitely de
serves this award," said senior
Anna Yusim. Yusim is a former
student of Sapolsky's and is cur
rently doing biology research at
Stanford.
"He doesn't just lecture to the
students," continued Yusim. "In
stead, he makes students examine
things by themselves. It's more of a
process of self-discovery."
First arriving on campus 12 years
ago, Sapolsky is now a tenured pro
fessor, specializing in primate be
havior and field biology, and teach
es three classes on campus.
Besides teaching Human Behav
ioral Biology, Sapolsky also heads a
class for sophomore biology majors
and teaches an upper level seminar
titled "Mechanisms of Neuron
Death."
"I am extremely interested in
neurological disease, and I'm trying
to do something about it, " said
Sapolsky.
Such a fascination has led Sapol
sky to a Kenyan National Park for
the past twenty years where he has
been doing extensive research with
baboons. "I'm interested in what
your social rank and your personal
ity have to do with who gets the high
blood pressure, the ulcers, and the
stress-related diseases."
In Africa, which he considers his
second home, "virtually everything
there is memorable — working
there is endlessly wonderful, frus
trating, exasperating, and exciting."

Originally from
New York City,
Sapolsky graduat
ed from Harvard
University with a
double-major in
biology and an
thropology and
went to Rocke
feller University

where he received his Ph.D. in neu
roendocrinology. He also per
formed post-doctorate work at the
Salk Institute in San Diego before
coming to teach at Stanford.
Currently, Sapolsky's research is
keeping him extremely busy. "I'm
still trying to understand how stress
hormones can damage the nervous
system, particularly how they might
impair neuronal defenses against in
jury, and I'm trying to figure out
strategies for doing gene therapy in
the nervous system to protect neu
rons from things like strokes and
seizures."
As well as having published
three books, Sapolsky still has time
to pursue his musical interests and
"play soccer badly." Caring for a 20-
month old baby with his wife also
keeps Sapolsky busy.
However, he never seems to run
out of time for his students and col
leagues.
"He's just a fabulous teacher,
and I'm happy that he won it,"
ended Biology Prof. Susan Mc-
Connell, who won the Hoagland
Award last year.
