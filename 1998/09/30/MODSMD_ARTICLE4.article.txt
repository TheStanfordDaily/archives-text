# Wais commissions study to chart how students spend time

The University wants to know
how you spend your time.
This year the Dean of Students
office will be conducting two one
week studies to better understand
the daily life of a Stanford student.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said the project is not a "Hig Broth
er" attempt at delving into stu

dents' personal lives. Rather, its
purpose is to "capture a slice of
Stanford student life."
During one week in fall and win
ter quarters, a small population of
about 500 undergraduate students,
chosen by residence, will be asked
to keep track of what they do each
hour of the day for a week. Stu
dents will spend about 20 to 30 min
utes daily entering their informa
tion in a form on line. Participation

will he voluntary and anonymous,
and all information will be confi
dential.
"The object is not to determine
how individual students use their
time or to prove any preconceived
notions," Wais said.
Students tend to express frustra
tion at the limited amount of time
they have each day.
"The only way to have tree time
is to make it," said senior drama
major Chris Tate, citing 26-hour
work weeks with various drama
productions. "I'm forced to skimp
on class work so I can have some
time to myself."
Wais is optimistic that the study
will "provide useful information

about student life" and "will he il
luminating for its participants."
In addition, Wais said the study
may help to support or confound
many stereotypes about Stanford
students in relation to students at
other schools. It will also provide
information about different sub
groups of the Stanford population,
including differences in time use
among genders, classes and majors.
"We are not going to try and
draw conclusions that are not war

ranted from this," said Keith Light,
associate director of development
for The Stanford Fund, who is vol
unteering his time to the project.
Although there is concern that
students may not be entirely forth
coming, Light said the project co
ordinators will emphasize that
more candid information will pro
duce better results, and that inti
mate details are not needed.
"Any study of this kind has risks
that students will, intentionallv or

not, be inaccurate," Light said.
Both Wais and Light hope that
the results will be interesting to stu
dents, faculty and staff, and will
allow the University to examine
and possibly modify its current un
dergraduate programs and ser
vices.
The fall quarter study will be
conducted in the first week of No
vember, but the dates for the win
ter study have not yet been deter
mined.

"Knowing there's no such thing
as a 'normal' week at Stanford,
we've picked a week in fall and
winter based on calendar dates that
don't pose any obvious distrac
tions," Wais said.
Results from the project will be
announced in the spring. Wais said
that the project coordinators will
produce profiles for each resi
dence. If this pilot project is suc
cessful, Wais said, it may become a
yearly or biannual process.
