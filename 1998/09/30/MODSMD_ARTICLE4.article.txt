The University wants to know
how you spend your time.
This year the Dean of Students
office will be conducting two one
week studies to better understand
the daily life of a Stanford student.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said the project is not a "Hig Broth
er" attempt at delving into stu

dents' personal lives. Rather, its
purpose is to "capture a slice of
Stanford student life."
During one week in fall and win
ter quarters, a small population of
about 500 undergraduate students,
chosen by residence, will be asked
to keep track of what they do each
hour of the day for a week. Stu
dents will spend about 20 to 30 min
utes daily entering their informa
tion in a form on line. Participation

will he voluntary and anonymous,
and all information will be confi
dential.
"The object is not to determine
how individual students use their
time or to prove any preconceived
notions," Wais said.
Students tend to express frustra
tion at the limited amount of time
they have each day.
