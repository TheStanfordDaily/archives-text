# Archeologist works on Sand Hill
## Stanford plans to save artifacts; local activists skeptical 
### Betsy Carroll 
Though Judge I iarkjoon Paik's recent ruling gave the
go-ahead to Stanford's planned $342 million expansion
on Sand Hill Road, questions linger among local residents
and interest groups as to the safety of MuWekma Ohlone
artifacts contained within the area.
In their case against Stanford's Environ ental Impact
Report. anti-Sand Mill development activists cited the
"loss of important archaeological and cultural resources
dating to Prc-l oiombian limes" as a reason to stop con
struction.
"The land needs to remain undeveloped ... as a most
sacred ground," said Debbie Mvtcls. former co-chair of

Mid-Peninsula Action for Tomorrow, the group opposing
the project.
But Campus Archaeologist Laura Jones of the Plan
ning Office maintains that thorough efforts have been
made to protect the integrity of unspoiled sites in the area.
"There are a number of Native American village sites
along San Francisquito Creek, and Stanford's been dig
ging around out there since the 19205." Jones said. "We
know a good deal about where the sites are and where
they're not."
()hlone tribal representatives were not available for
comment.
