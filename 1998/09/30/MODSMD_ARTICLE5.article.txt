# Archeologist works on Sand Hill
## Stanford plans to save artifacts; local activists skeptical 
### Betsy Carroll 
Though Judge I iarkjoon Paik's recent ruling gave the
go-ahead to Stanford's planned $342 million expansion
on Sand Hill Road, questions linger among local residents
and interest groups as to the safety of MuWekma Ohlone
artifacts contained within the area.
In their case against Stanford's Environ ental Impact
Report. anti-Sand Mill development activists cited the
"loss of important archaeological and cultural resources
dating to Prc-l oiombian limes" as a reason to stop con
struction.
"The land needs to remain undeveloped ... as a most
sacred ground," said Debbie Mvtcls. former co-chair of

Mid-Peninsula Action for Tomorrow, the group opposing
the project.
But Campus Archaeologist Laura Jones of the Plan
ning Office maintains that thorough efforts have been
made to protect the integrity of unspoiled sites in the area.
"There are a number of Native American village sites
along San Francisquito Creek, and Stanford's been dig
ging around out there since the 19205." Jones said. "We
know a good deal about where the sites are and where
they're not."
()hlone tribal representatives were not available for
comment.
One of the biggest ways Palo Alto
and Stanford worked to ensure the
protection of unexcavated Oh lone
sites in the development area was to
commission an Environmental Im
pact Report.
"There were many negotiations,
and we ended up with the most com
plete, extensive Environmental Im
pact Report in the history of Palo
Alto," said Larry Horton, Stanford's
director of government and commu
nity relations.
Jones also stressed the impor
tance of the report. "In the Environ
mental Impact Report, which was
written by William Self, who works
for the city of Palo Alto, thev looked

at Stanford's excavation data, and
they decided they wanted to have lev
els."
ITiese levels will indicate the con
centration of artifacts within areas of
the development.
Level 1 areas, which contain the
most dense concentrations of arti
facts, will remain undeveloped
through the expansion, which is
scheduled for completion by fall of
2002.
"There are places out there that
will be protected," Jones said, "Our
highest priority is to protect intact
sites."
In contrast, Level II and Level 111
tracts are slated for development.
These areas are ones that contain ei
ther very little evidence of artifacts or
no artifacts whatsoever.
Following the inspections and the

Environmental Impact Report, the
team of archaeologists made recom
mendations to the developers, who
were very cooperative.
"Stanford Management Compa
ny agreed with the archaeologists,"
Jones said. "We got everything we
asked for — as much as we thought
was reasonable. That doesn't mean
zero impact, but we got a very good
result."
"We have been working on this
project since 1984, and the Anthro
pology Department has been digging
out there since 1981. We know where
the little pockets of disturbed sites
are, and we have a plan for how to
work with them," added Jones.
Part of this plan is to rebuild on
old, previously compromised sites,
such as the land once occupied by the
old children's hospital.

"We didn't think it was reason
able to not build anything new
there," Jones said. "We're still having
excavation by archaeologists."
Despite the plans for construc
tion, Jones remains adamant that
much of the currently intact Ohlone
grounds will be untouched. "The Na
tive American sites are a non-renew
able resource. We feel really strongly
about preservation."
Mytels is skeptical.
"Laura Jones is a consummate
professional, but you have to consid
er who's paying her salary. Stanford
is a company town," she said.
Still, Jones is confident in Stan
ford's efforts at preservation.
"Stanford is incredibly lucky to
have these archaeological sites. We
can teach archaeology here, and I
think that's exciting," Jones said.
