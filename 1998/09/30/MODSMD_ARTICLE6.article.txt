# Bearish markets bite endowment

It happened to UC-Berkeley. It happened to
Harvard. It happened to Princeton. And it hap
pened to Stanford, too.
With the stock market's recent downward
turn, investors around the country — including
the nation's most prestigious universities —
have suffered losses.
The University's endowment, now estimat
ed at $4.5 billion, lost about 10 percent of its
value during August, according to Mariann By
erwalter, vice president of business affairs and
chief financial officer.
Stanford's losses, Byerwalter said, are about
equal to those of other universities with similar
endowments. The endowments at Cal, Harvard
and Princeton decreased between 7 and 10 per

cent during the recent market drop.
Though the figure sounds high, Byerwalter
said investing in real estate equity and bonds in
addition to the stock market has cushioned the
impact of the economic downturn on the Uni
versity's endowment.
"Because we have a diversified asset base,
the endowment suffers less than the [market] in
the same month," Byerwalter said. "Our hope is
that when one sector suffers it is mitigated by the
others."
During the 1997 fiscal year — statistics for
the 1998 year are not available yet — the Uni
versity endowment grew 23.4 percent.
Money from the endowment covered 14 per
cent of the University's total operating expense,
up from 12 percent in the 1996 fiscal year.
Laurance Hoagland, CEO of the
Stanford Management Company,
the group responsible for overseeing
the endowment, explained that since
the 19N()s the endowment has grown
much faster than the target rate.
Since 1982, he said, the growth
rate has been "well up in the teens."
After inflation, Hoagland ex
plained, the University aims for 6.25
percent growth. While the Universi
ty has reinvested the extra earnings
from recent years, Hoagland ex
plained, the system factors in the ups
and downs of the economy.
"We have a smoothing out rule,"
Hoagland said. "Our payout to the
University is 5.25 percent of the mar
ket value of the endowment pool.
We haven't run up that amount with
the bull market and we won't run it
down. It stabilizes the amount of
money we pay out to the University."
The tough times, Byerwalter said,
do not come as a shock to the Uni
versity. She explained that the bud
get process includes putting money
into reserves to protect the Universi
ty's finances. This year, she added,
the University will not need to dip
into those reserves.
"The budget's still in good
shape," Byerwalter said. "We are
happy with the mix of investments.
Given the difficult deterioration of
the market, I think we've fared re
markably well."
Taking risks, Economics Prof.
John Shoven explained, pays oil in
the long run. Prudent investors, he
added, diversify their investments —
as the University did — and in the
end those investors earn more those
who are overly cautious.
"Right now Stanford is doing no
worse than a typical investor. This
kind of thing goes with the territory,"
Shoven said.
"In a way I think we should not be
terribly concerned with whether we
had a good April or a good August,
but rather with a good If) to 20
years."
