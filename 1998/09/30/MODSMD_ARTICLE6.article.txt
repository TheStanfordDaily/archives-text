# Bearish markets bite endowment

It happened to UC-Berkeley. It happened to
Harvard. It happened to Princeton. And it hap
pened to Stanford, too.
With the stock market's recent downward
turn, investors around the country — including
the nation's most prestigious universities —
have suffered losses.
The University's endowment, now estimat
ed at $4.5 billion, lost about 10 percent of its
value during August, according to Mariann By
erwalter, vice president of business affairs and
chief financial officer.
Stanford's losses, Byerwalter said, are about
equal to those of other universities with similar
endowments. The endowments at Cal, Harvard
and Princeton decreased between 7 and 10 per

cent during the recent market drop.
Though the figure sounds high, Byerwalter
said investing in real estate equity and bonds in
addition to the stock market has cushioned the
impact of the economic downturn on the Uni
versity's endowment.
"Because we have a diversified asset base,
the endowment suffers less than the [market] in
the same month," Byerwalter said. "Our hope is
that when one sector suffers it is mitigated by the
others."
During the 1997 fiscal year — statistics for
the 1998 year are not available yet — the Uni
versity endowment grew 23.4 percent.
Money from the endowment covered 14 per
cent of the University's total operating expense,
up from 12 percent in the 1996 fiscal year.
