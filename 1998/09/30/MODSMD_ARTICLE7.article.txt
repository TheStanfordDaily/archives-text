# Greek Judicial Board to publicize decisions
## 
### Brittney Jensen Contributing writer 
In contrast to the past confiden
tiality policy, results of serious disci
plinary cases involving fraternities
and sororities will now be made pub
lic.
Dean of Students Marc Wais an
nounced this new policy at the
Greek retreat last weekend.
According to the policy, effective
immediately, Wais will "provide an
official University statement to the
media concerning the general cir
cumstances and final outcome of all
cases that are reviewed by the Greek
Judicial Board that have the poten
tial for serious sanctions such as the
loss of a Greek organization's recog
nition, housing, or probationary sta

tus."
The Greek Judicial Board, made
up of six members of the Greek
community, one student appointed
by the ASSU nominations commis
sion and Associate Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves, reviews all re
ported incidents of fraternity and
sorority misconduct, determines if
University policy has been violated
and recommends appropriate sanc
tions. Alter the recommendation.
Wais makes the final disciplinary de
cision.
The purpose of this new policy is
"to ensure accuracy of facts and
greater clarity" according to Wais.
"In my past three years as Dean
of Students," said Wais, "it has been
my experience that cases which
could result in serious sanctions

seemed somehow to make its way to
the pages of the Daily."
"Sometimes this information was
not accurate or based on fact," he
added.
Cases brought before the Judicial
Board have included hazing, party
mismanagement, and theft.
"It has been the Dean of Stu
dents' position in the past," said
Wais, "to maintain confidentiality
concerning all cases brought before
the Greek Judicial Board."
According to Wais, the Greek
community has responded positive
ly to this new policy.
"I'm really happy with these
changes," said junior Stephanie
Blossom, a member of Delta Delta
Delta and one of two chairs of the
Greek Judicial Board. "I think
they'll make a positive impact on the
Stanford community as a whole."
She noted that not all disciplinary
cases will warrant a press release.
"The press release will help
quash the rumors regarding high
profile cases," said Blossom.
" The press release will only ac
company important cases that the
campus is already talking about,"
said senior Brian Pilko, the other
chair of the Greek Judicial Board
and president of Kappa Sigma.
He agreed that the new policy
will help "avoid misrepresentation
and confusion."

One concern raised after Wais'
announcement at the Greek retreat
was the publication of cases where
fraternities or sororities are found
innocent of alleged misconduct.
In response to this concern, Wais
agreed to issue a press release when
a fraternity or sorority was found not
to have violated any institutional
rules or regulations.
"It is important for the campus to
know that the overwhelming majori
ty of Greek activities are positive and
contribute to the Stanford communi
ty," said Wais. "It is unfortunate that
a few isolated incidents of inappro
priate behavior by in one or two
Greek organizations have historical
ly tainted a traditionally strong and
vibrant Greek community."
In other Greek Judicial Board
news, the board is also implement

ing the inclusion of two more stu
dents from the ASSU nomination
commission that may or may not be
Greek.
"This change mirrors the Univer
sity judicial system," said Wais,
"provides a more inclusive, repre
sentative student voice, and conveys
that the board will not be overly pro
tective of fraternities and sorori
ties."
Also, the Greek Judicial Board
has a new advisor, Morris Graves,
who replaces Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe. Howe is also
the adviser to sororities and her dual
function could have created a con
flict of interest.
"All three of these new changes
are designed to strengthen Greek
life on Stanford campus," concluded
Wais.
