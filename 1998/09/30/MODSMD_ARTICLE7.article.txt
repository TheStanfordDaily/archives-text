# Greek Judicial Board to publicize decisions
## 
### Brittney Jensen Contributing writer 
In contrast to the past confiden
tiality policy, results of serious disci
plinary cases involving fraternities
and sororities will now be made pub
lic.
Dean of Students Marc Wais an
nounced this new policy at the
Greek retreat last weekend.
According to the policy, effective
immediately, Wais will "provide an
official University statement to the
media concerning the general cir
cumstances and final outcome of all
cases that are reviewed by the Greek
Judicial Board that have the poten
tial for serious sanctions such as the
loss of a Greek organization's recog
nition, housing, or probationary sta

tus."
The Greek Judicial Board, made
up of six members of the Greek
community, one student appointed
by the ASSU nominations commis
sion and Associate Dean of Stu
dents Morris Graves, reviews all re
ported incidents of fraternity and
sorority misconduct, determines if
University policy has been violated
and recommends appropriate sanc
tions. Alter the recommendation.
Wais makes the final disciplinary de
cision.
The purpose of this new policy is
"to ensure accuracy of facts and
greater clarity" according to Wais.
"In my past three years as Dean
of Students," said Wais, "it has been
my experience that cases which
could result in serious sanctions

seemed somehow to make its way to
the pages of the Daily."
"Sometimes this information was
not accurate or based on fact," he
added.
Cases brought before the Judicial
Board have included hazing, party
mismanagement, and theft.
"It has been the Dean of Stu
dents' position in the past," said
Wais, "to maintain confidentiality
concerning all cases brought before
the Greek Judicial Board."
According to Wais, the Greek
community has responded positive
ly to this new policy.
"I'm really happy with these
changes," said junior Stephanie
Blossom, a member of Delta Delta
