Attention Off-campus SUNet Users
On September 15,1998, the University's Communication and Networking Services department
introduced a new, higher-speed dial-in service. The new service supports connections with
modems from 9600 bps (V.32) up to the"s6K" type and has the capacity to support 40% more
calls than the older 498-1440 modem pool.
The new Central Modem Pool dial-in service is available at (650) 325-1010.
There are very few differences between the 325-1010 service and the older 498-1440 modem
pool. Most users should simply be able to change the dialed number in their connection
software (e.g., Dial-up Networking in Windows 95 & NT or the PPP Control Panel in MacOS 8).
Some users will have to make adjustments, however, so the University will maintain the
498-1440 service until sometime in Winter Quarter 1999 to allow time for their transition.
Following are the important similarities and differences:
WHAT'S THE SAME?
-• SUNet ID Authentication — A SUNet ID username and password are required to access the service.
For information about SUNet IDs, point your Web browser to www.stanford.edu/group/itss/services/
sunetid/. Non-authenticated access to FOLIO, FORSYTHE, GENEVA, LANE, REN and SOCRATES will not be
supported with the new dial-in service.
«• Modem Settings — 8 bits, 1 stop bit and no parity. Hardware flow control ("RTS/CTS") should be on,
and software flow control ("XON/XOFF") should be off.
- PPP Connection Support — for TCP/IP connections (e.g., Eudora E-Mail, Web browsing, FTP, etc.).
"* Serial Connection Support — You can still open a Mac Samson, Samson forWindows or other teminal
emulator serial session to dial in and connect to a specific Stanford host computer.
*• Four-Hour Time Limit — The maximum duration of a single Central Modem Pool session is four hours,
or 240 minutes.
"• 30-Minute Idle Disconnect —If there is no session activity for 30 minutes, the Central Modem Pool
equipment will automatically disconnect the call.
*• Unavailability from Most On-campus Student Residences — Since 1996, the University has made
the Central Modem Pool phone number unavailable from residences with access for each student to
in-room SUNet connections via Ethernet. This policy helps make sure that the service remains available
to off-campus student residents, faculty, and staff, who do not have such low-cost, higher-speed options
for accessing Stanford's computing resources from home. Residences where dial-in access is still allowed
are listed to the left.
- Unavailability During Maintenance —As with all SUNet-dependent services, the Central Modem
Pool may be unavailable during Networking's scheduled maintenance windows. During Autumn Quarter
1998, work on the Central Modem Pool equipment, itself, may be required as the system settles into full
operation.
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?
- New Phone Number -The higher-speed Central Modem Pool is available at (650)325-1010. Because
this access number resides outside the Stanford telephone system, on-campus users with University
provided telephone lines must have their modems dial 9 + 325-1010.
- Higher Speed - The new equipment at 325-1010 is capable of connection speeds from 9600 bps up
to the FCC maximum of 53Kbps with user modems ranging from 9600 bps (V.32) to"s6K"(soon to include
V.90). Currently, users connecting with 56KFIex modems can expect to see the fastest connection rates.
Actual connection speeds will vary based on each user's modem type,computer equipment and software,
and local telephone company equipment. Users with non-KFlex *56K"modems should expect connection
speeds to average 30Kbps.
- Greater Call Capacity - The new 325-1010 service is capable of handling up to 40% more modem
calls at one time than the old 498-1440 equipment.
- No Support for SUP — Although MacSLIP software users can reconfigure the control panel and install
a new PPP-compatible script, users of other SLIP dialers (e.g., on Unix and Windows 3.1 systems) must
convert to PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) software to use the 325-1010 number. For a link to instructions,
point your Web browser to the address below.
Nrw PPP Script for MacSLIP — MacSLIP users must install a new script and reconfigure the control
panel tc use PPP instead of SLIP. For a link to instructions, point your Web browser to the address below.
