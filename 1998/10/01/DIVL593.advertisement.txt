THERE IS NO LIBERTY WITHOUT
FREE SPEECH AND OPEN DEBATE
$250,000 Offer
I'.very historical controversy can be debated on national television
except one-the Jewish holocaust story Why? Who benefits? Open
debate, nothing else, will expose the facts behind this taboo.
To this end Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust
(CODOH) offers $250,000 to the one individual instrumental in
arranging a 90-niinute debate on National Network Television, in prime
time, between CO!X)l I (Bradley R. Smith, Dir), and the
ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE (ADL)
Issues to be debated: (1) Were "gas chambers" used during WWII by
Germans to kill millions of Jews as part of a program of "genocide?" (2)
Did key 'eyewitness" survivors give false testimony about "gas
chambers?" (3) Is the Diary of Anne Frank an authentic personal diary
or a "literary" concoction? (4) Is either the book or the movie Schindler's
List true or an intentionally corrupt version of the facts? (5) Are Jewish
organizations like the ADL and campus Ilillel committed to the
censorship of revisionist theory on the Jewish holocaust? (6) Should the
ADL campus Hillel and other mainline Jewish organizations respond
with a "suspicious silence" when a sister organization encourages
violence against revisionists? (7) Should a documentary film maker be
made the target of violence by the Jewish Defense League (or any other
"league"), as was David Cole, the Jewish writer and director of
CODOH's video on Auschwitz, David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek
Piper (called "The Video of the Century"), for exposing on film the fraud
of the Auschwitz gas chamber?
Marcy Kaptur (D), U.S. Congresswoman, Ohio writes: "Mr. Cole
has obviously invested a great deal m researching his subject and I
admire his tenacious curiosity. Again, I thank you for sharing this
documentary with myself and other Members of Congress." Yehuda
Bauer, professor of Holocaust Studies, Hebrew University (Tel Aviv),
writes. "A powerful, dangerous video...."
The Jewish Defense league writes (in a "Wanted" ad for Mr Cole,
on the Internet, which includes Cole's photograph): "An evil monster like
this does not deserve to live.... We must get rid of this monster ... There
needs to be ... the elimination of the Holocaust deniers JDL wants to
know the location 0f... David Cole Anyone giving us his correct address
will receive a monetary reward."
The FBI has termed the JDL a "terrorist organization."
The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith refuses to publicly
condemn the Jewish Defense League, for this language of hate I"he
reason is clear The ADL, by proxy, is "using" this threat of violence
against a Jewish scholar in its own struggle to help censor open debate on
the Holocaust controversy. This betrays our First Amendment and runs
contrary to Article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Who benefits from such censorship? Americans?
Over the past decades there have been thousands-if not tens of
thousands-of hours of one-sided Holocaust allegations broadcast to the
American people Is it not fair that those of us who are not anti-German
bigots, who no longer believe the gas chamber stories but do believe in
intellectual freedom, should be given 90 minutes—only 90 minutes!—to
debate the Anti-Defamation League over the suppression and censorship
of holocaust revisionism? (9.2)
