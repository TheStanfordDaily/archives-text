"An entrancing,
heartbreaking film.
-Caryn James, The New York Times
"Adrian Lyne has translated Nabokov's
classic with sensitivity,
intelligence and style"
-Jack Kroll, Newsweek
"By the time Dominique Swain says,
'I feel like we're grown-ups,'you might
have to wipe the steam off your glasses.
-Kicky Spears, Paper Magazine
"A beautiful, often eloquent film-but
it's also, quite properly, erotic. Lyne is
a master at portraying sexual energy
on the screen."
-Ron Miller, Knight Ridder News Service
