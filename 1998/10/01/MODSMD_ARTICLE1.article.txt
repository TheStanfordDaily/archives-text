### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
As election day approaches, Stanford graduate
Gray Davis gets set for the final weeks of the guberna
torial race.
Davis, a Democrat who graduated in 1964 with his
bachelor's in history, is currently serving as lieutenant
governor of California. He has made education policy
one of the major issues of his campaign.
"When I was growing up, teachers told every child
they were special; people really believed that," Davis
said. "We have to believe in the potential of young
people."
Over the past few years as a regent of the Universi
ty of California, Davis pushed for the reduction of en
rollment fees, which have been growing exponentially.
Governor Wilson recently signed into effect Davis' ini
tiative, which cuts university fees by 5 percent until the
year 2000. As governor, Davis promised he would ex
tend the 5 percent cut for at least two more years.
"We need to make higher education both accessible
and affordable to everyone," Davis said. "A youngster
with a college degree will be a productive citizen."
He added that accountability and responsibility
were key in promoting good schools, both at the K-12
level and for higher education. Davis explained that ex
pectations of high performance will rise by involving
parents, students and teachers in programs such as
weekend classes that get parents into the classrooms
and by rewarding teachers when students do well on
standardized tests.
It elected, Davis plans to hold schools accountable
for their students' performance. He would like to call a
special session of legislature in January to institute a
"type of Manhattan Project to improve reading scores"
. as well as new requirements for
teacher training.
If schools remain in the bottom
, 10 percent of the state two years in
they will be required to
partner up with local colleges and
use the schools' resources to im
prove teaching.
Davis recognized that the in
creasing enrollment at colleges and
universities throughout California
; has become a problem.
Although he has supported the
*new California State University
campuses in Monterey and Stock
«ton, Davis said that this is a problem
i[ "you can't build your way out of —
1 you have to think you way out of it."
; Davis said that he believes the so
r
> lution to the growing number of stu
dents lies in the use of technology
; and distance learning.
