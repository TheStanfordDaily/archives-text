### Hasan McGee 
Biochemistry Profs. Nancy Fed
erspiel and Ronald Davis received
r<sl2.6 million from the National Sci
-1 'ence Foundation last month to con
tinue mapping out the genome of
' 1 Arabidopsis thaliana, a relative of
( the mustard plant.
This project, along with others
' "such as the Maize Genome Project
; and related genetic research in the
'Biology Department and the
'' Carnegie Institute at Stanford have
established the University as an au
' thority on what Davis calls the "hot
topic" of plant genomics.
According to Davis, director of
the Stanford DNA Sequencing and

Technology Center, the genetic in
formation of the mustard plant rela
tive will be crucial to flowering plant
research in the next millennium.
If the research goes as planned,
Arabidopsis will be the "fruit fly of
the '905." The fruit fly genome was
an important breakthrough in insect
research, Davis said.
The project began in 19%, and
will hopefully be completed by the
year 2000, Davis said.
The completed genome of Ara
bidopsis should serve as a model for
other plants and shed considerable
light on research into more complex
plants, according to Davis.
He also compared the Arabidop
sis project with the Human Genome

Project research establishing a ge
netic map of humans. "What we are
doing is the same thing," he said,
"except with plants instead of ani
mals."
Arabidopsis was selected be
cause it is relatively small, yet similar
to common crops such as cauli
flower, cabbage, canola and other
commercial species.
Researchers on the project in
clude scientists from the University
of Pennsylvania and UC-Berkeley.
Internationally, six groups in four
nations are also working on the pro
ject.
The project's high price-tag is
due, in part, to the use of cutting
edge technology, Davis said. Unlike

in the past, all chemical reactions
that determine the genetic structure
of the plant are automated, Davis
said, and the results are catalogued
by computer.
He said that previous genome
projects done manually have been
"successful, but slow."
While the project may seem cost
ly, the federal science agency said
that the consortium of researchers
has been extremely efficient and
highly accurate.
Also, the automation involved in
this project requires a vast amount
of equipment, and the hundreds of
billions of pieces of genetic informa
tion involved require equally vast
amounts of time and labor.
