# Clinton reports $70-million surplus
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government this year
will post a budget surplus of about $70 billion — the first
surplus in a generation — President Clinton announced
today. He claimed his administration deserved most of
the credit for restoring discipline to federal taxing and
spending.
On this final day of the fiscal year, Clinton said the
1998 surplus, first since 1969, signaled an important shift
that opens the door to sustained growth of the American
economy into the 21st century.
"Tonight at midnight, America puts an end to three
decades of deficits and launches an era of balances and
surpluses," Clinton said at a White House ceremony
attended by many congressional Democrats — including
some who lost their seats in 1994 after voting for Clin
ton's deficit-reduction plan.
"We now have to do more to see that our people can
participate in it fully," Clinton said.
A key priority, he said, is to resist the temptation to
spend the surplus on tax cuts until reforms are made to
save the Social Security system.
Republicans were quick to share the credit and push
their proposal for major tax cuts this year.
"Because of the Republican Congress, we've bal
anced the budget," Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said in a
statement issued just moments before Clinton spoke. He
said voters deserve a lightening of their tax burden,
"since American taxpayers are now paying more in taxes
than the government needs."
Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson was
equally blunt. "This is a Republican surplus, and every
body knows it,"he said.

The surplus announced today is an estimate; data on
1998 revenue collections and spending won't be final
until mid-October. It will be the government's first black
ink since a $3 billion surplus in 1969, and will provide a
political boost io incumbents of both parties eyeing the
Nov. 3 congressional elections.
To dramatize the changes America has seen in the
three decades since the last government budget surplus,
the White House noted that in 1969 a can of Coke sold
for 15 cents, compared to 65 cents now, the median fam
ily income was $9,433 compared to $44,568 today, and
the U.S. economy was eight times smaller.
In an interview Tuesday, House Speaker Newt Gin
grich, R-Ga., chided Clinton for criticizing Republicans
for proposing a tax cut from surpluses, while the presi
dent is seeking billions in spending for security of over
seas embassies and other emergencies that would also
come from the surplus.
"It is the purest demagogic dishonesty," Gingrich
said.
The last federal surplus was in 1969 and totaled $3 bil
lion. The shortfalls peaked at $290 billion in 1992, but
have fallen every year since. Economists attribute the
improvement largely to a steadily strengthening econo
my, and to a series of deficit-cutting packages enacted in
the 19905.
Barring a recession, analysts foresee an uninterrupted
string of surpluses for at least the next decade. But loom
ing after that are potentially deep budgetary troubles
because of the huge expenses retiring Baby Boomers are
expected to incur on Social Security, Medicare and other
federal programs.
