# IMF warns of global recession

WASHINGTON (AP) — Worldwide economic
turmoil has cost millions of jobs and more than $600 bil
lion in output — the equivalent of a country the size of
Canada shutting down for a year, the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday. The agency warned
that global recession can't be ruled out, especially if the
U.S. economy weakens more than expected.
In a sobering assessment, the IMF slashed its eco
nomic forecast, predicting the global economy will slow
to a 2 percent growth rate this year, the poorest show
ing in seven years. The world's economy will only
slightly rebound to 2.5 percent growth in 1999, it said.
Both figures were a full percentage point below IMF
estimates made just five months ago.
"International economic and financial conditions
have deteriorated considerably in recent months," the
182-nation international lending agency said in its
"World Economic Outlook."
Employing blunt language, the IMF warned:
"Chances of any significant improvement in 1999 have
also diminished and the risks of a deeper, wider and
more prolonged downturn have escalated."
Just a year ago, the IMF forecast that the global
economy would expand by 4.3 percent this year, right in
line with the long-term growth trend over the past 25

years. But at that time the Asian crisis had not spread
from Thailand.
The IMF, which has assembled more than $100 bil
lion in bailout packages for Thailand, Indonesia, South
Korea and Russia, has been forced to steadily down
grade its economic forecasts as the crisis has intensified.
The human cost already has been significant: Mil
lions of people have been thrown out of work in the
hardest hit countries of Asia, where economies have
plunged to depression-like levels.
The situation in Asia has become so serious that it
threatens to unravel decades of economic gains by tens
of millions of people in the region, the World Bank said
earlier this week.
In the United States, the biggest impact has been an
escalating trade deficit as American factories and farm
ers have seen their foreign markets dry up. The broad
est measure of U.S. trade will surge from a deficit of
$155 billion last year to $236 billion this year, the IMF
said, and to $299 billion in 1999, a level it called unsus
tainable.
The agency forecast that U.S. economic growth will
slow only slightly to 3.5 percent this year, but will drop
to just 2 percent in 1999 as lost exports and rising
imports eat further into U.S. growth.
