HEBRON, West Bank â€”
Undercutting the latest U.S. peace
efforts, an assailant on Wednesday
hurled two grenades at Israeli
troops guarding a downtown
square in the volatile West Bank
city of Hebron, injuring 11 soldiers
and 11 Palestinians.
The attacker was shot in the leg
before he vanished into the Pales
tinian-controlled area of the city.
The Israeli army poured reinforce
ments into Hebron and imposed a
curfew on the area it controls.
Coming at a time when the
United States is trying to conclude
agreement on an Israeli troop with
drawal in the West Bank, the
attack gave a boost to Israeli claims
that the Palestinian Authority is
not doing enough to prevent
attacks on Israelis.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has said he won't hand
over more West Bank land until
the Palestinians control militants.
Troops also set up roadblocks
around Hebron, barring Palestini
ans from leaving or entering the
city of 130,(MX) Palestinians and 450
Jewish settlers.
Pensions in Hebron have been

rising since the Aug. 20 killing of a
settler rabbi, apparently by a Pales
tinian militant.
Wednesday's violence erupted
during Yom Kippur, the holiest
day on the Jewish calendar, as
Israeli troops enforced a blanket
closure on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The bloodshed came amid

intensive U.S. efforts to broker an
agreement on an Israeli troop pull
back from 13 percent of the West
Bank. The results of those talks
had been said to be promising by
U.S. officials earlier this week.
Under a compromise, 3 percent
of that land is to be set aside as a
nature reserve in which Israel
retains control over security.
