# Americans eating more fried veggies
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — A study says Americans are
eating almost 20 percent more vegetables than they did
a quarter-century ago, but many of the veggies aren't
green or leafy — they're deep-fried.
Twenty-five percent of the vegetables consumed by
Americans are french fries, according to Dr. Susan M.
Krebs-Smith, author of a study in Thursday's edition of
the journal Cancer.
The study said Americans have improved their diets
since the early 1970s but need to eat even better to help
reduce their cancer risk.
"That's definitely not broccoli we're chewing down
on," said Karen Collins, a dietitian and consultant for
the American Institute for Cancer Research. "In Amer
icans' minds, if a sandwich isn't enough, what do you
add? Who would think you add some stir-fry vegetables
or a piece of fruit?"
Krebs-Smith, a research nutritionist with the Nation
al Cancer Institute, said the explosion of fast-food joints
makes potatoes — especially in the form of french
fries — the vegetable people eat most. Half of all serv

ings of vegetables Americans eat are potatoes, and half
of those are french fries.
French fries contain a lot of fat and few nutrients,
though they do have small amounts of Vitamin C.
"We depend on them too much. We need to move
from potatoes, particularly fried ones," Krebs-Smith
said. /
The study found that Americans made what Krebs-
Smith called modest but important improvements in
eating habits between 1970 and 1995, consuming 19 per
cent more vegetables, 22 percent more fruit and 47 per
cent more grain products.
At the start of the decade, the government recom
mended in its Healthy People 2000 program that Amer
icans eat more fruits, vegetables and grain products by
the year 2000 and decrease their intake of fat and alco
hol to reduce their risk of cancer.
The study said that fat and alcohol consumption
have gone down slightly and that Americans may reach
many of the objectives in the Healthy People 2000 pro
gram.
