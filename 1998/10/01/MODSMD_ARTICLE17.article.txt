Cost of milk increases
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Got money?
A consumer coalition said Wednesday that the price of milk in Cal
ifornia will likely increase another 15 cents this week following the
California Department of Food and Agriculture's approval to raise
wholesale prices paid to dairy farmers.
The CDFA sets the minimum farm price every two months. In
October and November, it will be $1.54 a gallon, which is actually 16
cents more than the August and September price of $1.38 a gallon.
Data compiled for the first six months of the year showed that on
average, San Diegans pay the highest price in the state for a gallon of
milk at $3.21, while Los Angeles consumers pay $3.04 and San Fran
cisco consumers pay $3.19.
Miami consumers were just a penny above San Diego at $3.22 a
gallon.
When asked why the price of milk continues to rise, spokesman
Oscar Hidalgo said: "A lot of it is supply and demand. It's a very com
plicated formula that goes with the trading of commodities."
"Nationally, production has been down," said Dave Ikari, who
heads the CDFA's dairy marketing branch.
Ikai said California, which is the nation's No. 1 producer with about
27 billion pounds of milk each year, was hurt first by late rains and
then by a hot, humid summer and low pregnancies of cows.
"The cows get stressed," he said.
