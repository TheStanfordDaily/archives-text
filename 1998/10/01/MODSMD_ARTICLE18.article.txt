# 2,300-gallon crude oil spill kills birds in Bay Area
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
Dead and dying birds were found
coated with oil in coastal waters on
Wednesday as a 2,300-gallon spill
broke up into small slicks and tar
balls as big as basketballs.
"1 expect the number of dead
birds to keep going up," said Dana
Michaels, spokeswoman for the
state Department of Fish and
Game. "It's just this nasty, crusty
gunk, big globs. And the sheen
spreads over the surface of the area
for miles."
Twenty-six dead birds and were
collected and 30 oil-covered birds
were recovered alive by Wednesday
afternoon, the day after the thick,
heavy oil was spotted 10 miles from
San Francisco.
"The bird mortality is always
very high in these situations," she
said. "Even when we are fortunate
to find them alive, they are often
seated to death when we are clean

ing them."
This time of year, birds float on
the water in huge "rafts," teaching
newborns how to feed themselves.
Coast Guard crews flying over the
area on Tuesday saw one raft that
had as many as 40,000 birds
between the oil and the shoreline,
Michaels said.
The slick has moved south,
avoiding the Farallon Islands, a
marine sanctuary just 27 miles west
of San Francisco. Now the oil
threatens shoreline from Half
Moon Bay, 22 miles south of San
Francisco, to areas just south of
Ano Nuevo State Park, a mating
area for elephant seals during win
ter months.
So far, the Coast Guard reported
that so far no trace of oil has been
found on beaches in the danger
zone, about 15 miles of coastline in
all.
Petty Officer Edwin Lyngar said

six SCAT teams of three members
each went out at first light Wednes
day. SCAT stands for Shoreline
Cleanup Assessment Team.
The spill was 10 miles long when
it was spotted 10 miles west of San
Francisco on Monday. Since then, it
has floated south and broken up
into tar balls and patches.
In all, the mess covers about 3
miles of ocean, Lyngar said, and
skimmer boats were continuing to
suck up what oil they could.
No one has taken responsibility
for the spill, which was first report
ed by a vessel that moved through
the area Monday, but samples were
sent to Federal Oil Pollution Clean
up Fund laboratories for compari
son with oil taken from ships that
had recently traveled through the
waters.
KRON-TV, the NBC affiliate in
San Francisco, reported that lab
analysis shows the slick is crude oil,

not fuel, which points to a tanker as
the culprit. Lyngar said the Coast
Guard couldn't confirm the report,
but was doing all it could to find a
culprit.
"It does leave a noticeable signa
ture. These kind of lab techniques
have served us well," said Lyngar.
Clean Bay, a consortium created
by Bay area oil companies to deal
with spills, did not immediately
respond to a request for comment
on the crude oil report.
Also, Gov. Pete Wilson signed
legislation Tuesday prohibiting
large transport ships from entering
state waters unless the or
operator has an approved oil fpill
contingency plan.
Two years ago, the tanker Oape
Mohican spilled at least 40,000 gal
lons of oil into the San Francisco
Bay. Some 500 birds died and more
than 4,000 were tinged with oil from
the spill.
