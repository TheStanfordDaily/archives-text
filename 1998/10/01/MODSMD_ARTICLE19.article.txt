## Editorial A lesson in activism
### 
Elucidate decision-mak
ing process to facilitate
effective student activism

Following a spring of
activism and protests by graduate
students, the University has taken
important steps to ease Stanford's graduate
Housing crunch.
By making progress on what is probably
the most significant issue for the graduate
population, the administration sent out an
encouraging message â€” student voice can
matter. We hope that ihe University will
irse the positive publicity of its work on
graduate housing to help all students under
hand how they can most effectively impact
institutional action at Stanford.
The shortage of affordable housing in
c^mr.iunities surrounding Stanford has
greatly impacted graduate students, as an
increasing number unsuccessfully sought an
opportunity to live on campus. Last spring,
several highly publicized events made the
housing crisis the leading issue on campus.
* The ASSIJ Task Force on Graduate
Housing published an extensive report of
its findings in May, outlining the dimen
sions of the crisis and making key recom
mendations. Substantive and comprehen
sive, this report demonstrated the extent of
tbe students' commitment to University
;tCtion on housing.
* A midnight rally in the Quad comple
mented l lie task force's research by offering
dramatic visual evidence of the extent of
the crisis. Still, the spring ended in an atmo
sphere of uncertainty over the University's
plans to deal with the crisis.

By this quarter, a lot had changed. The
administration announced plans to build
480 new apartments in Escondido Village
by 2(XX) and subsidized 150 leases in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park in the interim. Dis
cretionary funds authorized by the
Provost's Office supported apartment sub
sidies.
While it deserves credit for taking these
significant steps, we hope in the future the
administration will be as explicit as possible
about its decision-making process. Most
importantly, the recent developments on
graduate housing could provide momen
tum for a campus-wide conversation about
student voice and activism.
It would be a shame, after all, if the ded
icated efforts of graduate students did not
result in some tangible lessons on how to
make a difference at Stanford. Was it the
research in the ASSU's report that con
vinced the provost to commit to action?
Did the graduate student rallv shock the
institution into action? Perhaps funding was
the key? Or was the administration's
response simply a realization that a housing
shortage could severely impact the recruit
ment of top scholars?
In short, students could use a little
debriefing so that we know what to do next
time student voices need to be heard. If the
University makes its decision-making pro
cesses more public and more transparent,
students will be better equipped to engage
in effective discourse with the administra
tion in the future.
Recent developments in graduate hous
ing are significant, positive steps towards
addressing a key student concern. Let's
build on the progress achieved so far to fur
ther empower the student voice at Stan
ford.
