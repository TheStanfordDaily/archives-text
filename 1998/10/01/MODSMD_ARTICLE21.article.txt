# Good, clean fun
## Swerving off those well-lit paths 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

LATE ONE evening
about a week ago a
friend and I were
trekking through the
parking lots of East Cam
pus on our way home
from a rowdy night at the
Coffee house when we

stumbled across a very scary scene. In the
shadow of Bob we beheld 30 freshman
charging drunkenly off into the night.
It was quite a touching sight. The troops
were walking with arms linked in Flo Mo
solidarity, or perhaps in an attempt to hold
up their swaggering pre-partied, dressed
to-impress selves. They were making very
slow progress, lacking definite direction,
and I swear I could smell their Natty-Light
breath from 20 feet away.
A scruffy, white hat wearing, young gen
tleman was leading the pack with a slightly
intoxicated stumble. No doubt he was the
chosen one merely because his fierce cry of,
"GAVILAN ROCKS! YEEAAAH!" was
the loudest.
Upon closer observation, we deter
mined that these frosh-folk were making a
pilgrimage to "get rocked" at Phi Delt. The
beautiful part about their journey was that
they were stumbling not towards Phi Delt
but in the direction of Phi Sig. Their cam
pus geography was not up to snuff.
But I made no attempt to rectify their
flight plan. And why should I have? They
were having a wonderful experience. There
is no time better than the week after class
es begin for a drunken adventure. I mean
sure, they were lost, misinformed, and sure
to end up in a heap on the lawn of Slav
Dom by blindly following their clueless
leader, but they were together.

Pointing out their confusion would take
the away the beauty of the moment. These
nubile little frosh were having an epic
adventure. Recall, you old and jaded
seniors, when was the last time you and
thirty of your closest Row-housed chums
decided to go sight-seeing at midnight
while clutching Evian bottles filled with
nature's other clear liquid? (Frat boys not
included.)
But one balmy evening last week, I
grabbed a good friend and bravely hiked all
the way to a party across campus. A bit
unsteady on the way home, my legs weren't
able to match the pace of my head. I made
my companion sit with me on a bench
under the magical glow of a blue safety
phone light.
From this picturesque location I
watched the frosh stumble homeward
towards West Campus while loudly won
dering where Otero was. Two especially
endearing frosh broke away, hand in hand.
Looking for a little company to soothe the
lonely pang of missed home-town honeys
and parents who waited up for them with
the driveway lights on, they descended the
stairs behind Green with a giggle and a
feigned grasp for "support." Their traveling
companions, clearly experts in the buddy
system idea, proclaimed that it was okay to
leave them because they had "lost them."
As the couples' heads disappeared
below our sight, my compassionate com
panion let out a cheer. I must say that my
Sex In The '90s conscious self was some
what taken aback. I took his "Ahh Jeeah!"
to be a blatant show of support for his fel
low boy "getting some."
These two freshman were doing some
thing truly great. They let themselves get

lost in the crusty folds of Green's founda
tion for a few moments of gratification.
How few of us ever kiss while overlooking
thousands of volumes of reference materi
al? Sadly few, I'm afraid.
Scared of getting lost, we stay right on
the newly tarred paths. We stay only to the
well-lit suggested travel routes of life. We
get old and being lost no longer thrills us
like a game of hide-and-seek. Instead it fills
our over-educated hearts with lead. Being
lost means time lost. It is a deviation from
the strict regimen of our daily planner. It is
a wave of nausea from reading the green
road sign's warning "Next Exit 24 miles"
after a missed exit, no matter how beautiful
the scenery.
Being in your twenties seems to necessi
tate clear vision and direct routes. The clos
est distance between two points has noth
ing to do with enjoying what is in between.
Being a senior means having the next twen
ty years of your life planned out on Excel.
It means having figured out who you want
to marry and knowing how many kids you
don't want and whether you want a big dog
or tropical fish.
The freshmen are actually doing some
thing right. Soon their memories of stum
bling through campus with no place to go
will too be old and faded. Libraries will be
just for research and sexual harassment will
have them afraid to cling to anyone for sup
port. So if being found involves endless
studying for tests with four-lettered
acronyms and always following the map,
then just try to find me.

alternating Thursdays.
