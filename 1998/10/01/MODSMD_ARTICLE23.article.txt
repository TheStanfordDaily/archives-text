In-room fees are reasonable
I'm tired of all the whining about the
connection fee. Although it would make
sense to include the fee in tuition or room
and board, the University runs on a fee
for-service model. You pay separately for
food, rent, television or telephone service,
ASSII fees, parking and PO Box. Includ
ing the fee in tuition would also be less fair;
people without in-rooms would be charged
for something they would not be using.
Second, the price is ridiculously cheap.
Consider a normal ISP at 56k: $150 for the
modem, $20 per month for service, and a
$20 setup fee: $350 for nine months. For
faster service you'd need ISDN or cable
modem service, which starts at $40 per
month. A T3 line into your room (equiva
lent to an in-room) would cost hundreds
for setup and monthly service.
Chances are you'll pay more for phone
service this year ($l5 per month, for a total
of $135 over 9 months, assuming only local
calls) than you would for your in-room.
Finally, there's always the cluster, which
is provided and maintained for free. Don't
want the BMW connection? Use the clus
ter, the free shuttle bus.
