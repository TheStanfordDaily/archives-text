The focus of the cross country
world will turn to the Stanford golf
course this Saturday as the men in
cardinal dash into action at the
25th annual Stanford Invitational.

In its first major competition
since capturing the NCAA cham
pionship last November, the top
ranked Cardinal will have an op
portunity to showcase the new Ma
chine in front of a home crowd as it
defends last year's Championship
Invitational and Collegiate Invita
tional titles.
The Stanford Machine, as the
consistently indomitable harrier
squad is commonly known, rolled
over all competitors at last year's
Invitational. Then-senior Nathan
Nutter finished a close second be
hind UCLA's Mebrohtam Ke
flezighi over the eight-kilometer
course, leading the Card to a 22-
point final tally in the Champi
onship Invitational.
UCLA's 91 points represented
the Card's closest competition.

amongst smaller schools, was also

The annual Stanford Cross
Country Invitational is traditional
ly an event that showcases the tal
ented Cardinal cross country teams
as well as the beautiful Stanford
Ciolf Course.
In 19%, a victory by the women
vaulted them to national champi
onship.
Last year, they repeated their
feat on their home course to spring
board another phenomenal season
in which they came home from
NCAAs as runners-up.

"Its something special for us to
showcase our runners at home and
show off the course," said head
coach Vin Lananna.
This Saturday s 25th edition ol
the event should be no exception to
years past. Yet the No. 2-ranked
Cardinal women may have to share
the spotlight with a number of
other teams.
Assistant coach Beth Alford-
Sullivan agrees. "The invite has
best field assembled this time of
.year anywhere," she said.

twenty-eight colleges and uni
versities will join Stanford in pursuit
of the Collegiate section champi
onship.
Though the team must deal with
the graduation of vital components
such as Nutter and Jason l.unn (sth
at lasi year's Invite), twin seniors
Brad and Brent Mauser are the top
returners and appear ready to power
the Machine to vet another victory.

The Hausers, fresh off an un
precedented 1-2 finish in the 10.000
meters at the NCAA track and field
championships in May, will seek
support from fellow 10.000 meter
national qualifier and perennial
cross country force Jason Balkman,
also a senior, in their first race of the
year.
"They're all very fit." said head
coach Vin Lananna. "I think we've
done the things we need to do over
the five weeks to prepare and we're
ready for a really good season.
They're anxious about getting
going.
"We want to he in a position to
put all the pieces together. We've
been putting the puzzle together a
few pieces at a time and hopefully it
will start to fall into place."
Other key pieces in the ( 'ardinal
system include senior Jon Weldon
and redshirt freshmen Ciabe Jen
nings and Jamey (iifford.
Junior Michael Stember and

sophomore Thomas Murley will
also have to prove their mettle on
the trails as well this weekend.
Unlikely to participate in Satur
day's race is sophomore Jonathon
Riley, whose 23rd-place finish at last
year's NCAA meet clinched the
men's title. Fie is returning from a
leg injury which cut his stellar spring
track season short.
This meet will be the first for
many of the Cardinal's top runners
and will give the team a chance to
settle upon the runners it will take
into the postseason.
"What we're trying to do is take
each meet as a prep and a learning
experience each week throughout
the season and see what actually our
lineup is," Lananna said.
Some freshman faces may also
see action in Saturday's races.
Jonathan Stevens, a former Califor
nia state champion and former Ore
gon state champion Jesse Thomas
are both new additions to the team.

Cioll ('ourse. boasts Iteams, includ

Surprisingly, the Cardinal isn't
the team to beat. The Brigham
Young Cougars are out to tighten
their grasp on the No. I ranking they
took from the ( ardinal at last year's
N( AAs in November.
Also. No. Wisconsin. No. 12
Arkansas and No. 23 I Hah State are
all legitimate contenders lor the
team title Saturday.
While the ('ardinal women have
already competed twice this season,
this meet marks the first time they
will be running a squad of their top
runners.
One of the interesting aspects
will be tosee how tin women handle
what is essentially a rematch of last
year's nationals.
I ananna does not want to put too
much weight on an early season
race.
"I don't think the focus on ()ct. ?>

will have a direct effect in Novem
ber." Lananna said. "I think Wis
consin and Arkansas are both good
and they have a shot at winning. ()ur
women don't race that way [to beat
one team|. They run as strong as
they can. If BYII is the team that
provides the best competition, then
we'll go after them."
Senior captain Mary ( obb's view
is similar. "We are not going to make
it a showdown [with BYUJ," said
Cobb. "We are not going to be upset
if it doesn't workout. It's not a fore
telling of nationals."
Cobb is correct. After all. BYIJ
was handily defeated by the Cardi
nal women here last year and then
went on to revenge the loss at na
tionals.
According to Alford Sullivan,
the race is essentially a stepping
stone.
"I'm prepared for the team to
open up well," said All'ord-Sullivan.
"I'm not putting too much emphasis
on outcome. It's early."
I he race for the top individual
runner should also prove to be excit
ing. Last year's race was won by

Stanford's then-freshman Julia
Stamps. Stamps came into Stanford
as the nation's No. 1 high school re
cruit and went on to an Ail-Ameri
can season capped by a fourth-place
finish at nationals.
When Stamps steps to the line this
Saturday, she will likely be up against
this year's top incoming recruit in the
nation. BYU's Laura Heiner. Hein
er is coming off a third-place finish at
last weekend's Mountain West Invi
tational at the University of Mon
tana.
She looks to be a possible front
runner along with teammates Mag
gie Chan and Courtney Pugmire-
Meldrum, last year's eighth-place
finisher at nationals.
Stanford junior Sally Glynn and
Cobb are also expected to be in the
running for the individual title.
They will be joined by Amy
Yoder of Arkansas, the seventh
place finisher at last year's nationals,
as well as her teammates Jessica
Koch and Tracy Robertson. A host
of other talented runners promises
to make this year's race a memo
rable one.
