# Fourth and inches
## Running with the weight of the world on their shoulders 
### 
I still remember the day freshman year in high school
when my track coach asked me to run cross country.
After I stopped laughing, I tried to reason with him that
I was a jumper, and the only reason I was even doing
that was to work on my leg strength for basketball.
Besides — though I never would have said this to a
man who almost played in the NFI — what kind of
sport is cross country?
Just look at distance runners. The hour-long runs,
those tiny shorts (which are even more hilarious when
everyone at your high school wears pants that are about
15 inches too big around the waist) and the emaciated
body-type aren't exactly attractive reasons to try it.
(lod knows I'm skinny enough as it is.
But after plenty of goading by my coach, 1 was con
vinced to try it out. just for the conditioning.
Filings haven't been the same since.
Competitive distance running isn't something that

can bo understood by those who haven't tried it. I don I
think most distance runners understand it.

It's a sport which focuses intensely on the individual
yet relies on the team as much as — it not more than
any other. It's a spoil of self-sacrifice and of little pub
lic glory.
It's a sport of masochists.

pushing themselves in order to win or just to get the
race over with as quickly as possible.
I had a teammate who severely injured his ankle
during a race. About 100 meters later, he finally
stopped running, fell to the ground and started crying.
Not because he was in intense pain — which he was
but because he felt he had let his team down.
The truly great runners never worry themselves
about this. They've learned to tune out the pain. I he
searing fire that shoots into your side, the strain on your
ankle as it turns on one bad step, the feeling of nausea
that builds up inside, none of these seem to be part of a
top runner's world.

lime I finally got a hold of him after the race, he had a
swollen foot covered in ice and the only thing he could
say was I didn't even feel it until after I crossed the fin
ish line."
I don't doubt it. Runners just keep pushing. If you're
not the first person across the finish line, most people
won't remember your name. It's not like other team
sports where one play can etch your image into people's
memories.
Everyone remembers Kirk Gibson rounding the
bases after his game-winning home run in game one of
the IIAS<Sl l AS<S World Series. Any Stanford football fan can
recall redshirt freshman quarterback Joe Borehard's
41-yard run to set up a game-winning field goal against
North Carolina earlier this season. In both cases, the
