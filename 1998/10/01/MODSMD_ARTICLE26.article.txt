Creighton (7-1) comes in as one <>t the
strongest programs in the nation. I he Blue
Jays have won five games in a row and already
captured two tournament titles this season
But it is not the Blue Jays' winning streak, nor
their high national ranking that is the primary
motivation for the (Ordinal.

"Many of us sulh i ed tin < »i rli <i I iimhuting
defeat to Creighton tlucc ye.usago. I hey beat

us badly." said senior Jamie Clark. "We've
come a long way since then and this will be a
sort of measuring stick to see how far we have
come."
Stanford has come a long way in the past
two seasons in both season record and con
fidence.
"Creighton was one of the nation's top
teams and still are today. However, we now
feel that we are also one of the stronger teams
in the country," Jamie ( lark added.
This confidence and strength of character
that Jamie Clark expresses has been develop
ing over the past seasons and continues to
grow with this squad. Both losses this season
for the ( ardinal have come against highly
ranked teams in No. 7 San Jose State and No.
11 Dartmouth, but Stanford has taken advan
tage ol every situation to keep improving.
" I he team is full of confidence right now,"
Jamie ('lark said. "We have learned and grown
from our two losses."
Bobby Clark elaborated on these senti
ments.
"In some ways, losing is good for you. You
learn more from a loss than a win." Bobby
( lark said. "You sell examine a little bit when
you take some losses. It is a great thing for a
team to suffer a bit. You can either split apart
or com toufther and I think this team has def-
initely come closer together. I lope
lullv now we don't have to suffer
much more."
Despite its 5-2 record. Hobby
Clark feels the team has only put to
gether one strong overall perfor
mance, against Boston University,
and has yet to do so at home. He
hopes to do so this weekend.
"We have had some good lighting
victories in our home games," Bobby
Clark said. "But I don't think we've
yet shown a total performance."
Junior defender Gerard Davis
also stresses the importance ol capi
talizing on what the team has al
ready accomplished.

"We hope to keep things going as
we are starting to play well." Davis
said. "We are building a little mo
mentum and hope not to let it slip."
Leading the powerful Creighton
offense will be junior forward Mike
Bustos, who has six goals and 14
points. With 11 points, seven from as
sists, junior Riehard Mulrooney is
one of the nation's top midfielders.
He holds C'reighton's all time record
for assists with 42. The Blue Jays have
outscored their opponents 23-7 on
the season. In comparison, the C 'ardi
nal has outscored its opponent 14-4.
But before the team can take on
Creighton, it must face UNLV (6-2).
The Running Rebels have a four
game winning streak at stake and
are looking to avenge last year's 1-0
defeat. At I I WsIJNLV Invitation

al. Sauer scored the game's only
goal to earn the Cardinal victory.
T his year's Rebels have already won
more games than all of last season.
This weekend marks the final
non-conference games before Stan
ford enters the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation stretch of the sea
son. As the MPSF is one of the
strongest conferences in the nation
- both No. 2 UCLA, the defending
NCAA champion, and No. 16
Washington are part of the MPSF —
Bobbv ( lark emphasizes the impor
tance ol each game on the schedule.
"These are every bit as important
as the MPSF games. We don't look
at them as anything different,"
Bobby Clark said. " These are two
tremendous games. We hope to get
a lot of people out to see them."
