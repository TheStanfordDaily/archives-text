# New group mentors EPA girls
## 
### Kimberly Downs 
A new community service group
on campus. Women and Youth Sup
porting Each Other, addresses issues
facing young women today by pro
moting self-esteem, social awareness
and community activism. The group
teaches life skills, sex and health ed
ucation and relationship and inter
personal skills to girls in middle
school.
According to their literature,
WYSE "hopes to recruit women of
all ethnicities and cultures who are
interested in making a difference in
the lives of young girls."
WYSE members mentor sixth,
seventh and eighth grade girls at the
49ers Academy, an East Palo Alto
school for at-risk kids where mentor
ing plays an active part in the stu
dents' education. Members combine
a curriculum-based approach with a
one-on-one mentoring relationship
to teach the students life skills which
they can also use to change their
communities.
Elizabeth Ortega Lau, a junior,
started the WYSE chapter at Stan

ford last year. Senior Katy McDaniel
said she thought the group enjoyed
great success. Each member had to
go through approximately six hours
of training, which involved listening
to speakers discuss issues that would
face the students they would mentor
— such as eating disorders and sexu
al assault —so that they would be ad
equately prepared to deal with them.
This year the group will be at the
49ers Academy every Thursday
from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Participa
tion in the program is optional for ju
nior high girls. Some of the partici
pants from last year will join again
this year, which was no surprise to
McDaniel.
"It was overwhelming at the end
[of the program last year] how much
they did want us to come back," she
said.
Junior Allison Barnum said she
thought it was essential for the girls
to establish a relationship based on
trust. To do this, the members of
WYSE take the junior high girls on
excursions at least once every two
weeks, and they also talk to them on
the phone whenever necessary.

Freshman Melinda Kong said she
thought the program was a great
idea. "I had mentors as an adolescent
and I looked up to them," she said.
"They helped me set goals beyond
my college education because they
were planning their lives too."
WYSE was started eight years a
go at UCLA by three students who
wanted to help prevent teenage
pregnancy and provide young
women with greater options at an
earlier age.
Initially, chapters of the group
were primarily located in California
college campuses, but now they can
be found on East Coast campuses
such as Harvard and Yale.
The Stanford chapter of WYSE
stays in contact with the other chap
ters by attending their annual nation
al conference and by meeting with
the Berkeley chapter for group activ
ities.
The 16 current members are hold
ing an informational meeting in the
Haas Center for Public Service con
ference room today from 2:00 p.m. to
3:00 p.m. The first training session is
October 5.
