# Stanford history twisted on e-mail

Leland Stanford Junior was not
killed in a freak accident, nor was
Stanford University founded in re
sponse to Harvard's refusal of Jane
and Leland Stanford's money.
Many Stanford students and
tourists alike have been hooked by
such rumors circulated over e-mail
and the Internet. Summer tour
guides fielded many questions re
garding the false story, which
claimed Leland Stanford Jr. attend
ed Harvard University.
"People would call and try to
stump me with questions about the
Stanfords donating money to Har
vard." said Anne Terry, a University
tour guide. "There were a lot of
phone inquiries too, and even one
newspaper reporter."
The actual story of how the Uni

versity was founded is more accu
rately described by Stanford
Archivist Margaret Kimball. Kim
ball's account of the University's
founding directly contradicts the
false story in several places.
The false story tells of two "coun
try hicks" that tried to donate money
to Harvard in memory of their son.
Leland Jr., whose accidental death
supposedly occurred after his first
year at Harvard.
According to Kimball. Leland Jr.
had not spent a year at Harvard be
fore his death. Additionally, he was
not "accidentally killed." Kimball
explained. Instead, he died of ty
phoid fever in Florence, Italy just
short of his 16th birthday.
Another significant error in the
story is the portrayal of Leland and
Jane Stanford arriving at Harvard as
"country hicks."

"The thought of Lcland and Jane,
by this time quite wealthy, arriving at
Harvard in a homespun threadbare
suit and a faded gingham dress is
quite entertaining," Kimball said.
The Stanfords did indeed travel to
the East Coast to visit several univer
sities in preparation for founding a
university in their son's memory, she
said
The Stanfords met with Charles
W. Eliot at Harvard. According to
the false story, the Stanfords waited
for hours to meet the Harvard Presi
dent. In reality, Kimball posits that
"as former governor of California
and well-known railroad baron, I
suspect [Leland Stanford] was not
knowingly kept waiting for too long
outside Eliot's office."
The ridiculous ending to the false
story is as follows: The Stanfords
were denied their request for a

memorial at Harvard. Consequent
ly, they moved to Palo Alto, where
they founded Leland Stanford Ju
nior University as a "memorial to a
son that Harvard no longer cared
about."
Kimball corrects the absurdity of
this ending. "The Stanfords estab
lished two institutions in Leland Ju
nior's name: the University and the
Museum." she said. Kimball pointed
out that the University was founded
by the Stanfords to serve "the chil
dren of California" and tuition was
free in the beginning.
Tour guides were surprised by
students' belief in the story. "It's a
sad state when Stanford students
don't know the history of our
school," said former tour guide
Blake Harris.
The origins of the falsified story
are unknown.
