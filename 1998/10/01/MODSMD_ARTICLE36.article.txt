## Gathering of the faithful The 						Church 9/21/98 at The Edge 
### 
For close to two decades, The Church
has endured as one of Australia's
most compelling — if sadly over
looked — musical exports. The commer
cial success of the band's 1988 break
through album, "Starfish," and of the sin
gle "Under the Milky Way Tonight"
seemed to herald the arrival of the Next
Big Thing. But The Church instead turned
out a series of beautifully crafted but
increasingly experimental and atmospher
ic albums that, while drawing rapturous
critical praise, failed to rouse much
Stateside interest.
Nevertheless, The Church's stately and
layered brand of guitar-driven psychedelia
has attracted a loyal cult following, which
was much in evidence last Monday at the
Edge in Palo Alto. This was the third stop
on the band's first American tour in near
ly a decade.
Taking the stage to a swirl of smoke
and keyboard effects (fitting for what has
uncharitably been called high-brow drug
music), the quartet launched into a mus
cular take on its anthem "Aura."
Faced with the impossible task of repli
cating its carefully sculptured studio
arrangements, The Church wisely opted to
skip the subtlety and turn it up. The
band's sound was pared back to its core of
Steve Kilbey's faintly sinister talk-chant
vocals and the ringing, feedback-drenched
attack of guitarists Marty Willson-Piper
and Peter Koppes. For a band known for
the otherworldly quality of its music,
"Aura" set the perfect tone for the evening,
with its surreal evocation of an arid land
scape straight out of "Mad Max."
The unusually dark lighting helped to

augment the sense of mystery that has
always surrounded The Church, as did the
polite but somewhat aloof stage presence
of Kilbey. This is clearly not the sort of
band that exhorts its fans to "boogie." The
one exception to the restrained presenta
tion was the guitarist Willson-Piper, who
chased his Rickcnbacker around the stage
with a manic energy reminiscent of Pete
Townshend's guitar-smashing days.
While The Church was ostensibly tour
ing to support its as-then unreleased new
album "Hologram of Ba'al," the set list was
largely dominated by songs from the
band's late '80s-early '90s commercial hey
day. It's worth noting, however, that the
two new songs that were debuted, especial
ly the dreamy, sunny prospective single
"Louisiana," indicate the band's unwaver
ing quality control remains intact.
Highlights of the one-hour-and-forty
minute set included the obligatory but
hardly rote rendition of "Milky Way," a
perfect distillation of The Church's ability
to straddle the line between Beatlesque
catchiness and its own outback-mystic
atmospherics.
This band, known for its black trench
coats, sunglasses and solemn image, man
aged to produce a few charming moments
of levity. For example, during the suitably
titled guitar epic "Grind," Kilbey effortless
ly segued into the opening bars of
Aerosmith's "Dream On" before exchang
ing a dismissive look with Willson-Piper
and continuing with the song.
The audience, a curious blend of
Silicon Valley types and mascara-and
makeup Goths, initially seemed as sub
dued as the band, but warmed up sub
stantially as the show gathered momen

turn. "Two Places at Once," from the
band's underrated 1994 classic "Sometime
Anywhere," was a particular favorite.
Starting as charming lullaby, the song
blasted into a cathartic chorus of "I've
been waiting for eternity," with Kilbey and
Willson-Piper trading lead-vocal duties.
The Church closed the show with the
taut and dramatic "Reptile" from the
"Starfish" album. The song opened with
Willson-Piper's snaky guitar arabesques
bursting out of an unlit stage, and closed
with dueling guitars rising up into feed
back heaven.
The now frenetic crowd of 300
brought the band back for two encores,

the first the pastoral "Starfish" cut
"Destination" followed by the blitzkrieg
like assault of "Tantalized." The second,
played by a now charmed and bemused
band, was a frolicking jam from its sec
ond album, "The Blurred Crusade," a
charming throwback to the band's early
Byrds-inflected guitar-jangle.
Alternately transportive and electric,
short on theatrics and long on substantial
musicianship, The Church's show capu
tured a truly world-class band — and a
fearsome live unit — at the top of its form.
