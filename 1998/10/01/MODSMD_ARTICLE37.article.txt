# Interview with Marty Willson-Piper
## Guitarist for The Church speaks 
### Mark Brewton Contributing Writer 
Intermission: How long has it been since your last
appearance in the U.S.?
Marty Willson-Pipen 8 years.
I: Any special reasons aside from your new
album why you're touring the States now?
MW: Well, [guitarist] Peter Koppes rejoined the
band for this album, so it's a sort of homecoming.
I: What are your thoughts on the new album
"Hologram of Ba'al'?"
MW: It's always hard to evaluate your own music.

People we've played it to really seem to love it. I'll
leave it at that.
I: Do you see this tour as being an attempt to break
back into the American market?
MW: We're not the sort of band that really picks up
casual fans. You have to come to our music, give it
time and some attention to appreciate it. If you're
looking for mindless gratification, go to a Prodigy
show.
You can't make music with success in mind; you
have to make music for yourself. We've been doing
this for 18 years, so 1 don't really give a [fig) what any
one thinks anymore.
