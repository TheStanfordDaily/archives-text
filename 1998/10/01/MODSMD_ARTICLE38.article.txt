## Watch Out, Pixar Here Comes 'Antz' 
### 
Two years after the wildly popular
movie "Toy Story" proved that
computer animation could create
amazing films, two new computer anima
tion films are scheduled to hit the the
aters in a span of just seven weeks. "Antz,"
which opens tomorrow, is a film created
by the Palo Alto-based company Pacific
Data Images. By beating its competitor
Pixar's film, "A Bug's Life," to the screen,
PDI hopes to become a major player in
the world of computer animated films.
The previews for "Antz" seemed rather
unappealing. After all, how could a colony
of ants, a uniform group without individ
ual identity, capture the imagination of
movie audiences?
The film's main character, Z-4195, a
worker ant voiced by Woody Allen, pon
ders almost the same question. He is
unhappy about the lack of individualism
in his colony and regrets that he has to
blindly follow orders. In one of the film's
funniest scenes, Z's individuality becomes

clear when he is the only ant who dances
by making up moves as he goes along.
This irritates the soldier ants, and when
they try to teach Z a lesson, a full-scale riot
breaks out in the colony.
By pure luck Z meets Bala, the colony's
princess (Sharon Stone), but after only
one dance she runs off and leaves the love
struck Z behind. To see Bala again, Z
switches places with his soldier-friend
Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) so that he can
attend the royal inspection. By dumb luck,
Z inadvertantly kidnaps Bala and they set
off to find Insectopia, a place where the
streets are lined with food. General
Mandible (Gene Hackman), whose evil
plans include terminating the weaker ele
ments of the colony, must recapture Bala
to make his plans work.
The amazing thing about the film is that
it is extremely engaging despite the fact that
the characters are insects. Thanks to the
computers used to make the film, the ants
have an amazing range of facial expressions,

operated by 250 facial control points, that
make them seem almost human.
The details of the scenery, the lighting of
the props and characters, and the fluidity of
the motion are all great results of the com
puter technology used to make the film.
PDl's computer wizardry allows us to expe
rience things that could not otherwise have
been brought to the screen. The film ended
up receiving a PG rating, an indication that
animation is starting to move away from
making films targeted solely towards chil
dren. "Antz" has enough substance to be
enjoyable for people of all ages.

The amazing cast of characters, along
with a terrific script, make this film into
one of the best animated pictures I have
ever seen. Dan Aykroyd, Danny Glover,
Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne
Bancroft, Jane Curtin, John Mahoney,
Paul Mazursky and Grant Shaud all lend
their voices to the characters in "Antz."
While the concept of the film "Antz" may
not draw large crowds to the theaters, once
the word gets out, this film will probably
do very well at the box office.
