# Welcome to the 'Antz' farm
## An Interview at Pacific Data Images 
### Fred Vallaeys Staff writer 
The computer animated movie "Antz"
will be in theaters tomorrow. Most people
who see it will wrongly assume that it is
Pixar's follow-up to "Toy Story." In fact,
"Antz" was made entirely at Pacific Data
Images' studio in on Park Avenue right
behind Fry's Electronics in Palo Alto.
Because this is the first feature film to
come out of Palo Alto, Intermission visit
ed the PDI studios to talk with the movie's
directors, Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson,
and two of the producers, Brad Lewis and
Patty Wooton.
Since "Antz" precedes Pixar's "A Bug's
Life" by only seven weeks, we wanted to
know how the directors felt about their
competition. Surprisingly, they both
seemed sincerely thrilled to hear that Pixar
is releasing a similar project.
Darnell and Johnson feel the industry is
not racing — everyone is trying to con

vince Hollywood that computer animated
movies are here to stay. "Toy Story" 's suc
cess alone does not prove that this new
medium will catch on with audiences. If
the two upcoming movies do well, Darnell
and Johnson feel that the computer graph
ic format will become mainstream much
more quickly.
While the story of "Antz" is great movie
material, most major studios turned down
the chance to help PDI create it. According
to Johnson, all of them asked the same
thing: "Can people really watch a comput
er-generated film for 90 minutes?"
Producers Lewis and Wooton consid
ered themselves extremely lucky when
Jeffrey Katzenberg of Dream Works decid
ed that the two studios could co-produce
"Antz." Katzenberg's experience working
on Disney's animated films came in handy
for this project. Sometimes he was brutal
ly honest in his opinions about certain
scenes. But in the end, his honesty made
the film much stronger.

Katzenberg's network of friends is one
of the reasons why stars such as Woody
Allen, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone,
Sharon Stone and many others decided to
lend their voices to the film's characters.
PDI convinced the actors to work for vir
tually nothing. According to Darnell, the
actors accepted a low fee because the pro
ject sounded fun and interesting. Allen
said he did the film because it was"the
action movie that I never made myself."
While the characters in the film interact
flawlessly, the actors were never together to
record dialogue. For this reason, it was
sometimes difficult for them to get into
their parts, but gradually they grew into
the characters.
Besides the voice actors, over 180 other
people worked on the movie for 30 months.
Before even starting to make the film, they
created a stick figure version of it. When
viewers expressed interest in the crude ani
mation, PDI knew it had a good project and
was willing to invest in the real thing.
One of the benefits of making an ani
mated film is that the directors have con
trol over absolutely everything in the pic
ture. The downside is that the animators
constantly came to them with seemingly
trivial questions. For example, one anima
tor asked whether a wooden table used in
the film should be made out of one solid
board or a bunch of boards put together.
Even the grain of the board became the
topic of a discussion.
A bigger concern was keeping the film
from becoming too violent. While one
battle scene was violent enough to earn
the film a PG rating, the directors claim

they tried to keep the film as peaceful and
tasteful as possible without negatively
affecting the story. For that reason, they
only hinted that the queen was giving
birth every two seconds rather than show
ing it. According to the directors, "Antz" is
the first American animated feature film
that did not receive a G rating.
Everybody at PDI seems to be happy that
the movie didn't earn a G rating. The rating
seems to be a good indication that the
movie can be enjoyed by both children and
adults. While kids will enjoy the cool anima
tion, adults will find the themes and the dia
logue the most enjoyable.
Johnson hopes that people will come
away from "Antz" saying how good the
movie was. If audiences only talk about
the animation after seeing the film, he will
consider it a failure. After all, the anima
tion is merely a medium to communicate
a great story. The animation allowed PDI
to show a world that no one could ever
portray without massive computing
power. PDI hired artists and taught them
how to use computers because their goal
was to make a great film instead of show
ing off their great software.
PDI used mostly in-house software to
create the animation, which means that
they never had to worry about making the
software itself consumer-friendly. Johnson
compares PDl's software to a
Lamborghini — it is the hottest thing on
the road but it requires a team of mechan
ics to keep up its performance. From the
result, it seems the mechanics should con
gratulate themselves on a job well done.


There's nothing like the smell of feet on your shoulders.
