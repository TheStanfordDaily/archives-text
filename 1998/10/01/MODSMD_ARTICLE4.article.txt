## Tresidder to extend hours 
### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
In response to student demand
for extended hours at Tresidder
Union. Dean of Students Marc Wais
and ASSIJ President Maren Norton
announced a host of reforms which
will be implemented on Monday,
Oct. 5.
Under the new arrangements, the
cafeteria seating area in Tresidder
will remain open for an additional
two hours, until 1 a.m., Sunday
through Thursday. The Coffee
House will serve hot food until 12:30
a.m. and the Corner Pocket will serve
food until 11 p.m.. Wais said.
"We've gotten a commitment
that these places will be open," he
said, adding that Bon Appetit. the
major food service tenant at Tresid
der, has collaborated to allow the
changes.
"The reforms are based on stu
dent demand to keep Tresidder open

for longer," Wais said. Since a similar
pilot program last spring proved suc
cessful. he said, "we've decided t0...
institutionalize keeping Tresidder
open."
During finals week last spring,'
Tresidder remained open and the
Corner Pocket served food until 2
a.m.
The lighting in Tresidder has re
cently been overhauled, making the
environment more conducive to
studying and hanging out, Wais said.
Student monitors, who are being;
trained by Tresidder Meeting
vices, will work from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.
to keep order and gauge student use
of the facilities, Norton said. Based
on student response to the reforms,
she said there is the possibility for
further expansion of hours.
According to Wais, recruiting stu
dent monitors has not been a prob
lem, despite the short work shifts and
late hours. "I thought we'd have diffi
culty in staffing it, but we're delighted
that it suits the students' lifestyles,"
he said.
Students are generally pleased
with the finalized changes. "It's great
that they are trying to meet student
needs," said senior Christina Amini.
Amini said that although she
doesn't study at Tresidder, she might
make use of the Coffee House's ex
tended serving hours.
The reforms are a collaborative
effort on the part of the ASSU, the
Dean of Students office and Stanford
Risk Management — all of which are
funding the reforms.
"It's a win-win situation," Wais
said. "Tresidder is furthering its mis
sion of becoming a hub of campus ac
tivity. Students are well-served, and
hopefully vendors will benefit."
Although the reform process
began last spring, suggested changes
were finalized just a few weeks ago
after the Tresidder Advisory Board
endorsed the reform initiative, Nor
ton said.
"All of us saw the need [to expand
Tresidder's hours] — it was [then] a
matter of logistics.. .figuring out the
details, [such as] how to make sure
everything remains secure down
stairs," Norton said.
The Tresidder reforms began at
the grass-roots level, with students
talking about extended hours, Wais
said. Staff were then involved in the
process, and the reforms were codi
fied in a formal initiative.
