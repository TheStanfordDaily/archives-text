# Vince, baby, Vince!
## Cover Story 
### Sharon Armstrong Editorial staff 
Just in time for the release of his newest film, "Clay
Pigeons," Vince Vaughn gave Intermission his thoughts on
acting, swing dancing, the sanctity of filmmaking and pizza.
Vaughn, whose big break came with his role as the lingo
dropping Trent in 1996's "Swingers," went on to star in
Steven Spielberg's "The Lost World," and most recently,
"Return to Paradise." Vaughn will next recreate Anthony
Perkins' role in "Psycho." Intermission joined in a round
table interview with students from colleges across the coun
try to find out what makes Vince Vaughn love playing char
acters who vteld big knives.

Aound Table: Did you have any
background in taking acting
lessons or theater or college?
Vince Vaughn: Well, I took
some classes at a local community
theater in my town where I grew
up. I would go there, and they put
on musicals, but you couldn't be
more than 13, so 1 would play
Daddy Warbucks at 10 when Annie
was 13, and she was like a foot taller
than me. It was more of a summer
activity kind of thing. Then I got
involved in theater in Chicago.
My feeling was always that your
greatest gift as an actor is your
imagination. You know, you'd go
to these acting classes, and they'd
say, "If you haven't taken three
years of ballet, your body's your
instrument, you can't come on
stage. If you haven't taken two
years of voice, your voice is your
instrument, you can't come on
stage." And it was all these sorts of
kids who were doing that sort of
thing. And then they'd all come in
front of the class to perform
Stanley Kowalski.
And I always figured, hell, man,
if you haven't been to a pool hall
and had a guy tell you, "That's how
you play around a pool table," then
how can you play Stanley
Kowalski? Which I don't think is
true, but, I just felt too big of a deal
was made out of it, that it's a child
like thing.
It's not like the rock bands and
musicians you like nave oeen tak
ing years of classical training. And
I've always thought that your
greatest thing is your imagination
and your whole particular life
experiences and using your imagi
nation to make it specifit o what
ever the character would want.
RT: What is the story behind
the production of "Swingers?"
W: The story behind it is, me
and Fav ["Swingers" writer and
star Jon Favreau] did a movie
called "Rudy" together and most of
my stuff got cut out. And he
moved out to LA, and he really
missed his girlfriend, and I always
liked to go out to bars ami stuff,
very similar to what you saw in the
movie, and I liked to swing lance.
He wrote the screenplay rort of
based on that, but he exaggerated
it, and made me out to be one
dimensional, and the who'., .hing
about "babies" and stuff, it worked
for the piece.

And then we had the script, and
an opportunity to sell the script for
a lot of money, which was tempting
to a guy who didn't have a lot of
money. But in doing that, they
always want to change the script,
they'd tack on things which we did
n't think were right and we just
eventually got to a point — we'd
read "The Fountainhead" right
around there — and the questions
we had were running around. Stuff
like, "Beautiful babies, who gonna
understand that?" They'd take
swing music, and say, "Swing music,
nobody listens to swing music." But
we thought, we'd just try to sell a
movie that we respected.
We made that movie, and we
found a guy, Doug Lyman, who
loved the script and would keep it
the way we'd left it. And so, it was
very much a collaboration. And it
was finally made for $250,000,
which isn't a lot of bread, and for
me, I didn't have an agent at the
time, I hadn't worked for a year and
a half, so I was hoping to just get an
agent. But Miramax bought it.
RT: Your most recent movie,
"Clay Pigeons," has a lot of themes
on life and death and slicing and
dicing, so in that vein — Vince
Vaughn, the last supper, who
would you have there, and what
would you eat, and why?
W: Probably my close friends,
and nobody knows who my friends
are — friends I've had from child
hood and that kind of thing —
pizza, with jalapenos.
RT: Do you like steak?
W: I'm a fan of the red meat.
RT: What's a Sunday morning
with Vince Vaughn like?
VV: You get up around 1 p.m.,
have a cigarette, probably of the
Marlboro variety, talk about how
you want to quit.
RT: You started out doing Chevy
commercials, then "Swingers."
Next thing you know you're dotng
a Spielberg, and then "Return to
Paradise" and "Clay Pigeons." It's
been a roller coaster for the past
few years. How has it been for you?
W: It's been cool. I saw "Jaws"
at a young age and "E.T." at a
young age, so for me "The Lost
World" was like going to play cow
boys and Indians with big toys
with a guy who knew a lot about it,
so that was a lot of fun.

But the other material, I've
always tried to pick stories that 1
thought were interesting, and the
people that I work with that I
thought were cool, I got along
with. For me, it's hard to really
have a perspective, because I've
just been doing stuff and working.
I don't really have anything to say
except that I feel really blessed just
to be given the opportunity to get
the chance to play these parts.
Because I spent the last seven and a
half years in Los Angeles before I
really got a serious break. I had
false alarms, and that sort of thing,
it's really helped me appreciate the
opportunities I have now a lot
more.
RT: Do you think you'll do any
more big-budget stuff or stick to
smaller films?
W: If it was a big-budget film
that rocks I'd totally do it. The only
thing is, if the big-budget movies
suck, there's no way. There are a lot
of small films that suck, and
they're totally pretentious. I'd do
"Star Wars" or something like that;
"Bladerunner" I thought was a
good movie. You know, anything
that has value to it— I think it's
good that there's a bunch of differ
ent stuff out there, and things to
choose from.
RT: I loved the laugh of Lester
Long. How much of that character
was written, and how much did
you throw in from past characters
or on your own?
W: That's sort of written ...
But it's also your interpretation.
My interpretation of the character
is that he was a guy who probably
had a hard reality to face, and
because his reality was so weird, he
sort of created a new identity for
himself, out of western movie
stars, western TV stars, Elvis
Presley, Buck Owens, Merle
Hank Williams. Hp so--'
of took all of these people and
came up with a sort of weird mon
ster of this guy.
There were lines that were writ
ten that just led me to go this way.
I'm a very young guy, but [Lester 1
must be talking about this rage
it takes a lot of years of life exne
ence to be saying stuff 'k»; that M
way that someon v/hc . ; <i»'
would. So, the .ame jui ot
the fact thai ie laughs real big
and happy, he makes it like every
one laughs big and happy, like in
his reality it's us : a big great joke
and everyone's oving it.

Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
RT: Lester and Trent find
themselves in a bar together.
Who's more money?
W: T's more money. T don't
wanna hurt the ladies.
RT: How did you prepare for
the role? You looked pretty darn
comfy with that knife, and you
are playing Psycho next.
W: 1 think the greatest thing
you have is your imagination,
and I've always thought there was

an overrespect for the craft. The
thing is alwavs to be a part of
something. > uual to something.
When I was vorking on "The
Lost World," 1 didn't want to put
Steven Spielberg on a pedestal
and make it out to be something I
couldn't relate o and be a part of.
On "Clay Pigeons," this was the
director's very first film; that did
n't mane me feel like 1 didn't want
to be a partner with him in this
experience. The value comes from
dealing with their mind, their
original thought, their concepts.

For me, I always approach a
scene as improvisation, but not
just when lines are concerned. I
just don't have a game plan ever
that if it's written I'm going to
cry, I'm going to cry, or if it's
written I'm going to get angry I
don't actually get angry. Because
you're just trying to have your
whole character specifically
mapped out so that you have
that, you understand that, so you
can just turn that on, in reaction,
given to what happens.
If the glass falls, it's not going

to throw that part of the perfor
mance. If the actor I'm doing a
scene with plays it differently, I
don't even know how I'm going
to do it, I try not to imagine it.
This phone conversation, we
didn't know where we were
going to start. What questions
we ask depend on what's said
The thing I like about a character
like Trent, or a character like
Lester is they get to be extreme
with that, so you can go push the
margins further.
RT: When you were filming in
Montana, did you learn how to
line dance?
VV: We were filming in Utah,
and I did not line dance.
RT: What do you think about
those purists who are against the
"Psycho" remake?
VV: My saying is like, it's not a
religion. It's not a thing you have
to balance on — it's child-like.
It's a thing you can solve with
banging drums; things like that
aren't religion. They're thing
you be a part of.
If a band's going to plav ive,
they don't want you ( o sit

through it. They want you to
dance, or get mad, or feel sexual,
or whatever it is that's happening
to you.
If you're in a movie theater,
you're going to respond to the
film. Because one-half the people
did a great job of [the original
"Psycho"], does that mean there's
no value in other people playing
the role? If you see a great pro
duction of Shakespeare's "Taming
of the Shrew" or "Our Town,"
you're not going to see another
version of the play because you'll
be emotionally cheated of your
experience? That's bullshit.
In music, songs are being
remade all the time. They really
contribute. I think that Gus [van
Sant, director of the new
"Psycho"] is a great filmmaker,
and I think that Hitchcock
inspired people like him to con
tribute to filmmaking. Pretty
much all of the actors involved in
the movie feel the same way.
Hitchcock's daughters were
down at the set, and they were so
excited. The original screenwriter
s excited. I think that once
everyone sees just a couple min
utes of the movie when it kicks
in, I think everyone will under
stand that.
