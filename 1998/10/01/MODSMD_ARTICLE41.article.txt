# The silence of the 'Pigeons'
## A zippy look at serial murder
### 
CC / lay Pigeons" opens with a rapid-fire montage of
the wildly beautiful scenery of big sky country,
by a soundtrack of rifle shots. As
the camera lingers on shattering beer bottles hanging by
nooses from a countryside tree, it becomes clear just what
exactly this movie is — a homage to hickdom.
It is precisely because of this wacky outlook that "Clay
Pigeons" holds its own on screen, despite its terribly
drawn-out pace. This is a happily gratuitous celebration
of the slow, simple life, proving that the worst of troubles
can rear their ugly heads if you even glimpse down the
path of excitement.
Clay, played with a dumbfounded innocence by
Joaquin Phoenix, is a small-town mechanic. While shoot
ing at beer bottles with his lifelong friend Earl, Earl accus
es Clay of sleeping with his hot-to-trot wife Amanda. Earl
finishes the argument by shooting himself. When Clay
realizes that the aftermath of Earl's suicide has an uncan
ny resemblance to a murder scene, he rushes to Amanda
(Georgina Cates) for advice. Amanda, ice queen extraor
dinaire, tells Clay he's on his own, and that if he talks of
their affair, she'll deny everything. Clay fakes a more
believable suicide scene by pushing Earl's car off of a cliff
and "discovers" the body shortly thereafter.
Enter Lester "the Molester" Long, played with charm
ing boyishness by Vince Vaughn. Lester is a friendly joker
with an oft-used, nasal laugh and difficulty controlling
his actions around butcher knives and irritating women.
Lester knows that Amanda is trouble, despite his lustful
attraction to her.
Shortly after Lester arrives, Amanda bursts in on Clay
and his new lover Gloria in bed together. After killing

Gloria, Amanda announces to Clay that a 911 call would
only prompt an unearthing of Earl's botched suicide job
as a murder. Amanda blackmails Clay into helping her
dispose of the body.
Despite his secret life as a reluctant but creative body
dumper, Clay bonds quickly with Lester; the unaggressive
mechanic responds to Lester's easy, drawling charm as
quickly as the ladies do. But when Lester convinces Clay
to go lake fishing and a body turns up, Lester sweetly asks

a nervous Clay to be a true friend and
leave him out of the police report.
It is only when a second dead body
shows up in the lake that small-town
suspicions are truly aroused about who
the real killer is. Soon after, the FBI
shows up with a list of umpteen similar
unsolved murders in the near vicinity,
backing the innocent anti-hero Clay into
a corner between a rock and a Lester.
It is slightly irritating that Clay is not
bright enough to make the right deci
sions about who among ex-lovers and
serial murderers to befriend. But there is
a method to the filmmaker's madness.
Director David Dobkin, who graduated
to this film from commercials, brings a
script full of murders a sense of giddy
foolishness — without hurtling the story
into senseless comedy.
Vaughn is the gem here, guffawing his
way through the film as if serial murder
were just a part of any normal life.

Janeane Garofalo also contributes an appreciated dose of
her trademark deadpan humor as an evidence-confiscat
ing, pot-smoking FBI agent. And the twangy country
soundtrack, coupled with kamikaze camera shots to herald
changing scenes, bring shocks of energy into the far-too
slow pacing of the script. Serial murder may be a serious
subject, but in "Clay Pigeons," it's clearly a laughing matter.
