# Never say 'Never'
## Movie Reviews 'A Soldier's Daughter' has its moments 
### 
In the early moments of "A Soldier's Daughter Never
Cries," we see a pregnant young woman writing to a
son she will never know. At six years of age, Billy is
adopted by an American expatriate couple in Paris.
Initially unable to adjust to his new life, he carries from
room to room the one suitcase he brought with him.
Ultimately, the film is a coming-of-age story about
Billy's adoptive sister Channe, played captivatingly by
Leelee Sobieski. But Billy's confusion haunts every expe
rience to come. "A Soldier's Daughter" is about finding a
place in the world. It is about trying to find solace in the
small moments of family.
The film, is set during the 1960s and 70's, and is based
on a semi-autobiographical novel by Kaylie Jones. Despite
covering too many years, the film restricts itself to three
periods. Each period is titled with the name of a male
who influenced Channe. "Billy" is about her adoptive
brother entering the family when they are children.
"Francis" is about the flamboyant and charismatic boy
(played beautifully by Anthony Roth Constanzo) whom
she befriends in adolescence. And "Daddy" is about the
relationship she develops with her father, the famous
author Bill Willis (Kris Kristofferson), after they all move
back to the U.S.
With "A Soldier's Daughter," producer-director team
Ismail Merchant and James Ivory move refreshingly away
from their classic period-drama characters, who tend to

be caught in times and places that restrict their self defi
nition. The film is instead about a family that has fero
ciously defined itself right out of a country. As a result, its
move to the United States is largely a struggle for the chil
dren to figure out who they are.
At its best, the moments are pure and delightful glimpses
of family life as experience. And the performances of
Kristofferson and Sobieski are particularly powerful. Ivory's
direction creates the sense that we've spent the afternoon
with these lovely people and don't want to go home.
But there is also a strange fragmentation of moments
over too much time. The otherwise moving scenes of the
last segment,"Daddy", almost become lessons in how to be
a liberated, compassionate father. And when we finally are
confronted one last time by the question of whether or not
Billy will read the diary his birth mother has written for
him, we see its power, but can't quite feel its impact.
The mother of this family, played strongly but uneven
ly by Barbara Hershey, pops into some of the final scenes
as an unexpectedly angry drunk. In Paris, drink was the
vehicle for freeing her spirit. It seems the drinking turned
bitter with the loss of that lifestyle and the impending
death of her husband, but this is never really made clear.
Ultimately, we are left without enough information to
care and too much information to just let it pass as one of
Channe's internal impressions.
Watching the film, we take the perspective of little Billy

from the first scenes. We walk through the rooms of these
people's lives and are put slightly off balance. We are only
given bits and pieces of their experience over several years.
We carry with us what we know of them and hope, as Billy
does, that we can take at least one of these things with us
when we go.
