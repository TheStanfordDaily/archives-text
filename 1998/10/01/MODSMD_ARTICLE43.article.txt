# No movie 'legend' here
## But it's still a fun time 
### 
Here's yet another horror film coming our way, and the studios are promising
us even more throughout the next couple of years. "Urban Legend," featuring
a bastion of pretty faces from television, continues the smirking trend of self
aware victims, a la "Scream" and "Scream 2." That makes for decent entertainment,
even if it is a bit formulaic and cornball at times.
Jared Leto has graduated from "My So-Called Life" to headline a cast of actors play
ing Pendleton College students. They are tormented by a serial killer who uses urban
legends as a guideline for his murders. As Haul, a writer for the school paper, Leto is not
unlike the Courtney Cox character in the "Scream" series. Paul is career-driven and
suspected of the murders, since he could reap great benefits from a high-profile story.
Alicia Witt, from CBS' "Cybill," and Rebecca Gayheart (remember the "Noxzema
girl"?) alternate as the beauties chasing Paul. Witt's character, Natalie, appears to be the
first to suspect that the murders might be related. She even checks out a book about
urban legends from the spooky library, which makes for a spine-tingling sequence.
A bleached-blond Joshua Jackson (Pacey from "Dawson's Creek") has a small part
as a sex-crazed prankster who may be using the anniversary of a rumored Pendleton
massacre for one big practical joke. Look for Robert Englund ("Nightmare on Elm
Street") as Professor Wexler, whose American Folklore course is similar to one taught
at UCLA. And "X-Files" fans will surely recognize John Neville, the now-departed Well
Manicured Man, in his role as the stubborn Dean Adams.
1 personally had not heard about most of these legends, so the offing of each of the
characters came as unique surprises. The few that 1 had heard of, like the Death of
Little Mikey and the Microwaved Dog, make it into "Urban Legend" as well. The mur
derer, already intent on following the legends closely, seems to have watched Michael
Myers in the "Halloween" films a little too much, since the killer's gait is the same
methodical, quickened walk.
Overall, the youth and inexperience of this group of actors makes the action appear
forced and unbelievable, but first-time director Jamie Blanks inserts enough campy
wit and thrilling chills to make this a fun night out at the movies. Now I'm definitely
going to check the back seat of the car every time I get in, just in case some evil force
happens to be lurking there.
