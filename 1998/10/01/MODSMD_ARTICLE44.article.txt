# 'Pecker' pleases partially

xt ]rhat can you expect from a movie
\ /\ ' called "Pecker?"
112 T Well, for one, you can look
forward to some twisted but hilarious
scenes about a very unusual photographer
and his very unusual subjects, lohn Waters,
who directed "Fink Flamingos," "Hairspray,"
"Crv-Baby" and "Serial Mom," is true to
his quirky style.
On the other hand, the title "Pecker"
suggests that the film can pet annoying
after a little while.
Pecker (Edward Furlong) is a young
man living in Baltimore, Waters' home
town. He works in a sandwich shop and
spends the rest of his time bothering the

hell out of people with a camera that he
picked up from his mother's thrift store.
The people around Pecker have issues
that might seem commonplace in real life,
but in a )ohn Waters film, they just look
wacky. His girlfriend Shelley (Christina
Ricci) is obsessed with her downtown laun
dromat and runs the place like a general. Hi.s
best friend Matt (Brendan Sexton III) is a
not-so-clever thief who nabs film for
Pecker's shoots. And his older sister Tina
(Martha Plimpton) is an emcee at a gav bar
where the local pastime is "teabagging."
Pecker's pictures are discovered by a
New York gallery owner named Rorey (Lili
Taylor), who insists on an exhibition. The

artsy types in New York fall in love with
Pecker's "exotic blue-collar" style, and he
starts getting calls from Vogue magazine
and the Whitney Museum of American
Art. But the pictures expose things about
his family and friends that are better left
unseen. Pecker finds out that his new
social lite is destroying his old one.
There are points in the film when you
just can't stop laughing. In one scene,
Pecker and Matt go "shopping for others"
— putting unwanted items into people's
carts at the grocery store. Later, Pecker and
Shelley commit a federal crime by having
sex in a voting booth.
Sometimes, however, "Pecker" feels

kind of cheesy. The characters are all too
flat, including Pecker, so when they gather
for parties it turns into a clash of the
Melodramatic Personalities. The moral
dilemma of family against art is resolved
in a way that feels like a cop-out.
While 1 can't sav much for Edward
Furlong's acting — he hasn't improved since
"Terminator 2" and now looks like a young
Pee Wee Herman — "Pecker" is successful
thanks to a great supporting cast. They
achieve the lohn Waters trademark of mak
ing the insane look sane.. .and vice-versa.
