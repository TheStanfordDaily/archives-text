# 'firelight' isn't illuminating
## This one fizzles out fast 
### 
Don't be fooled.
"Firelight," the newest period piece in Miramax's
ever-burgeoning costume drama file, is not the
tragic romance its trailers make it out to be. Instead, it is
an overwrought tale of inexplicable sentimentality — the
kind best left on the pages of romance novels.
The film opens with Elisabeth, played by the perfect
lipped Sophie Marceau. She is a beautiful, young Swiss
woman working as a governess in England, being inter
viewed for a rather odd position — to be a surrogate for
a British landowner who needs an heir. The gentleman,
who hides behind a screen as he speaks to her, would like
to know why she would do such a thing. She explains that
her father has debts and she does not wish to marry.
And so the couple make their separate ways to Calais to
spend several nights together. During their first
encounter, each is awkward and eager for the job to be get
done. After a few nights together, however, they find each
other totally attractive and thoroughly enchanting, and
their "working environment" becomes highly erotic.
Again, think romance novels.
But business is business and they must part. After
Elisabeth determines she is pregnant, she has the baby, a
little girl, who is taken away from her immediately.
Transaction complete.

But Elisabeth is torn. She chronicles the passing of
seven years in her daughter's life by painting watercolors
for every holiday and birthday that passes, while she
searches for the gentleman in England. When she finally
discovers Mr. Charles Godwin's household, he is in need
of a governess, and his sister-in-law, Connie, hires
Elisabeth immediately to care for Louisa, the baby
Elisabeth sold so many years ago.
What follows is a formulaic, toned-down bodice rip
per, complete with chaste justifications for the couple's
lustiness. Charles' wife suffered an accident ten years
before, leaving her in a coma, stowed away in the back of
the house. Elisabeth loves her father so much that she
wanted to rid him of his debt, but never wanted to marry
because her independence would be slaughtered by a hus
band. Louisa is a brat because Charles has spoiled her and
no governess has ever been able to control her. Woman in
the attic, tragic good man, governess who saves his
world...sound familiar? "Jane Eyre" fans everywhere
should be screaming.
What's most frustrating, however, isn't the formula but
the gaps in the story. Elisabeth claims this is a great sacri
fice for her father, by whom she was raised alone, but we
never see evidence that he is a great force in her life. She
sleeps with Charles for three nights and falls in love with

him — a thoroughly silly thing to do — and yet makes it
a point to prove that she is highly principled, intelligent,
and unwilling to make deicisions that would curb her
mind or her independence. To top it all off, she and
Charles have a pre-lovemaking face-to-face in which they
decide that when all the lamps are turned off and life is
only illuminated by firelight, all rules and mores are
absent, and their affair can exist safely. Oh, please.
To his credit, director William Nicholson has picked a
superb supporting cast. Kevin Anderson, most recently seen
in ABC's well-done but cancelled "Nothing Sacred," puts in
an unaffected performance as an American businessman
courting Elisabeth — like it's business. And Lia Williams, as
the sister-in-law who chastely pines for Charles, without the
hapless sentimentality of the other lovers, gives a perfor
mance that deserves attention and praise.
In the end, "Firelight," isn't a total wash —if pre-
Victorian melodrama floats your boat. But for anyone
else with a respect for and love of the costume drama
genre, watch out, or you might find yourself in the mid
dle of a Harlequin novel come to life.
