# 'Ronin' kicks butt

CC onin" is a good action flick.
IJ Starring Robert DeNiro as "The Silent
X V Good Guy" along with Jean Reno ("The
Professional,""Mission Impossible") as "The European
Silent Good Guy," "Ronin" also includes good perfor
mances by Jonathan Pryce as "The Bad Guy"
("Tomorrow Never Dies") and Natascha McElhone as
"The Hot Girl." Throw in three car chas

es, four or five brutal deaths, and

numerous impressively

large guns and you
have the formula

director John

Frankenheimer followed to success at the box office.
I can understand some of the typecasting. The best
part of the movie may be DeNiro's acting during a scene
in which he directs an operation to remove a bullet
lodged in his own stomach. Gruesome? Of course.
DeNiro is money at playing the mature badass that shoot
em-up movies need, and Jean Reno proves that he can
hang with the big boys in that category, too. And
Jonathan Pryce is going to put the pressure on Gary
Oldman for crazy bad men parts if he ever quits those
Infiniti commercials.
What bothered me about this movie, though, was the
plot. Yes, it took second place to the action, but it also did
n't make sense. Just watch the blood splatter, and don't
ask why it's happening. See "Mission Impossible" or "The
Saint" for comparably convoluted plots, as well as for
comparable moviegoing experiences.
The difference between those movies and "Ronin" is
that this movie has a more interesting pretense. A ronin in
samurai times was a samurai whose master had been

betrayed, and who worked for hire until he could exact
revenge, after which he would commit ritual suicide.
Where watching gets rough is in trying to figure out how
that definition of the movie's name maps on to the mod
ern day "Ronin," where there are too many possible mas
ters and too many double-crosses to keep track of.
The plot suffers from either the screenwriter's or the
director's decision to limit the information the audience
gets. The gang is collected to chase after an elusive briefcase,
and you're supposed to be on the edge of your seat wanting
to know what's in the thing. Without blowing the end for all
of you prospective viewers, you won't be satisfied with the
answer. You won't. And because you don't know what's in
the case during the beginning, you don't really ever get to
understand everyone's motives for wanting it.
And one last thing: the car chases. Three are two too
many, and, altogether, they take up about half an hour.
Too much burning rubber, if you ask me. It starts to duil
the senses.
