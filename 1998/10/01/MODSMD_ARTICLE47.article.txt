# The many faces of Julia Sweeney
## Former SNL star does it all in her new film 
### 
C C Said Ha! " is a one-woman show
I brought to the screen. With such a
movie, who tells the story becomes
almost as important as the story itself. Here the
narrator and actor is Julia Sweeney, best known
for her work on "Saturday Night Live."
After Sweeney's brother Mike was diagnosed
with cancer, she let him move with her. Soon after,
her parents joined them. Sweeney's monologue is
about the unavoidable havoc that ensues. She
describes the feeling of being a rebellious teenager
once again, plotting to get out of the house, sneak
ing cigarettes and fooling around with her
boyfriend. When Sweeney is later diagnosed with
cancer, her brother accuses her of stealing the can
cer spotlight. God said,"Ha!" again.
The part of the story that we do not see in the
film is that while her life was unraveling, Sweeney
adapted the events into comedy sketches and per
formed them at a local Los Angeles club. She then
strung the pieces together and produced a one
woman show which worked its way to Broadway.
In keeping with her original play, she spends the
lllm alone on a stage. The question, of course, is
whether this will translate into an effective film,
but Sweeney herself is so restrained, endearing
and sincere that she rises above any limitations.
Her emotional journey is well paced, and her style
ranges from the distressed but hopeful words of a
close friend to the drawn out, sarcastic tone of per
formance artist l.aurie Anderson. If not necessari
ly transfixed, we are engaged.

But the mo\ ie falters sometimes. Sweeney, in
the director's chair, tries to be too clever with the
camera. In one scene, the main camera wanders
among other cameras which we see in silhoutte. It
is an awkward moment and leads to the impres
sion that Sweeney, as director, was trying too hard
to find some action in a one-woman show. But this
is a rare moment when technicality draws atten
tion away from Sweeney's engaging story.
We get to know Sweeney's family through won
derfully subtle characterizations. Her impression
of her mother walks a graceful line between cari
cature and character. The impersonation superim
poses onto Sweeney an older version of herself, but
one we know she will never exactly become, by
virtue of the immpersonation itself.
The personality of her brother Mike is developed
in reenacted moments throughout the film. We get
to know Mike's dry sense of humor not from
Sweeney's description, but rather from her re-cre
ations of events. As a result, Mike becomes less a dra
matized "victim" than just another nuanced charac
ter. It is a more powerful method of characterization.
"God Said Ha!" could have been a curious
glimpse at the woman behind the man / woman
who is Fat. That revelation that would have held our
interest for about five minutes. However, Sweeney
takes us further. She may not make any directly pro
found commentary, but she does create a world.
And in its best moments, she makes us consider that
how we see the events in our lives is largely a choice.
