## Rialto 'Rialto' 
### 
a fter a previous incarnation as
/\ Kinky Machine during 1991-95
JL \flfcd a slew of singles and KPs
with tTOfcuWit line-up, Rialto pre
, sents us, fwilly, with an entire LP of
its polisheuundie sound.
In an atnnpt to evoke a balanced
mix of patlvs and bathos, the group
avoids both triteness and self-pity.
Successful in pointing out the banality
of life and the escapist nature of our
daily indulgences, yet proclaiming that
there is value in every endeavor, Rialto's,
idealism, so often found in indepen
dent bands, really comes through.
Without knowing the band's back
ground and intentions, one can miss
the full quality of the songs and of the
CD as a whole, but what will speak for
Rialto when you can't look into their
red-rimmed but shining eyes is the
band's music. ,
The first bars of the album's opener,
"Monday Morning 5:19" stunned me
into consciousness earlv oVie morning.

song enticed me to pay attent®!
to what might follow such an ehd»B
emptiness, drumbeats ringing oljj fdra
hoding and imminent defeat. The
track, "Dream Another Dream," k
more upbeat hut is equally anxious and
vulnerable. After the inevitable couple
of sloshers, the tjuirky keyboard pro
gramming of "Lucky Number" man
ages to give the album a second wind.
The record winds down with the bril
liantly melancholy " The Underdogs."
The general tone of the music is
dark, and the lyrics follow thaJLmood.
One of the album
Barbie Doll," plays much liMn movie
synopsis. The song is abouffhe loss of
innocence in a deceptively'glamorous
world.
Despite the general nftodiness of
the album, there are rare moments of
unaffected optimism. "Summer's
Over" reminds the listener of better
times and the return of those days.
If you like the Britpop sound with
sometimes lush, sometimes understat
ed orchestrations glimmering from
beneath the layers of glam guitar,
Rialto is a good choice. While there is
certainly room for further develop
ment of its sound, Rialto's self-titled
album is a departure from the band's
previously modish stylings and. is
indicative ol the current state of the
Britpop / glam scene.
