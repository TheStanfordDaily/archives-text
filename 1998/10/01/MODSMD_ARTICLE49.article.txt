# Local H ‘Pack Up The Cats
## 
### 
ocal H has done what tew bands <
| like it have yet to accomplish. It
k «has put together an original, fol- *
low-your-instincts album in the style of .
mainstream '90s rock. The substance of
its music does not stand head and
shoulders above other groups, but local
H's distinct sound is tresh and unique. \
Still, the album as a whole comes across
as a bit of a disappointment.
Hats off to Local H tor getting its
hands dirty and trailblazing through
stale world of pop music. It's unfortu-'
nate, however, that the band's music
lacks consistency between the vocals
and rhythms. "Pack Up The Cats" walks
the slippery line between watered-down
hardcore and alterna-grunge; inevitably,
the group loses its balance.
On the positive side, there's quite a
variety of styles on this record, wnich is
■ pretty impressive considcraig the band
is composed of onty two members:
■ urummer Foe Daniels and vocalist/
\
, guitarist / bassist Scott Lucas, who uses
, special pick-ups on his axe to plav both
instruments simultaneously.
"Pack The Cats' gets oil t«> a slow
start with "All-Right Oh, Ifeai . and
: "Cha! Said TJu' iCittjy,'' then picks ap with
| the more aggressive "What Can ! Tell
Your on which l.ucas belts out' oming
right along / shaking nands and all things
lame / kiswV uss and taking names.
The group does too much at the
same time, ranging from the slow guitar
melodies of "Stonev" to the psychedelic
grooves of "Lucky." Refusing n> bold
itself back, local H explores til the
realms of its sound, substituting an
"everything but the kitchen sink's col
lage of rock for steady musical iirec
tion. The stylistic mishmash can get
pretty confusing bv track 14.
Even the lyrics rellect the lack of
focus throughout the album. On Deep
Cut* one of the CD's stronger numbers,
Lucas sings, '1 fed like my whole life is
spent /1 don't know where I went*
Unfortunately, Lucas' confusion is all
too evident on "Pack Up The Cats,"
You never know quite what Lucas is
going to throw at you next, calling the
listener's ear to attention and keeping it
at full alert. The result is a sound which
many will find tough to sink their teeth
into. Others, however, could find it
quite enjoyable.
