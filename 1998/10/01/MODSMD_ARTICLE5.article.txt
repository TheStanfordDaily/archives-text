# New free parking permits popular
##

In the first month that it has been
offered. Parking and Transporta
tion Service's Far East and Far West
permits have been "very popular"
among students, according to Susan
Law, parking and transit operations
coordinator.
The designation of under-used
spaces on Bowdoin Street and
Searsville Road as Far East and Far
West parking came in an effort to
reduce overcrowding in East and
West campus parking lots. The per
mits arc geared only toward specific
residences, and they are free. Park
ing and Transportation Services
hoped the free offer would prompt
students to park in those areas, even
though they are not very close to the
residences.
Proximity has apparently not
been a concern for students. Law
said. Approximately 25 out of the
original 60 spaces that were offered
on Searsville Road remain unused,
and 35 are left out of the 80 spaces
on Bowdoin Street. Law says that
more sales are expected in the next
two weeks.
"Although we've been offering
this for a month, it's onlv been two

weeks since the students have been
on campus," Law said. "We've
given the bulk of them in the last
two weeks and will probably give
more in the upcoming two."
Law said that many students who
bought regular permits are coming
in for refunds and are getting Far
East and Far West permits instead,
something that Law attributes to
the overcrowding of parking lots
near residences like Stern and
Lyman.
"The [Bowdoin and Searsville]
lots are really not that far out from
the dorms." Law said. "Students
have been finding that they paid for
permits, but that they haven't been
finding parking. The Far East and
West permits are great alterna
tives."
Additional pay phones and an
increase in lighting are in place on
Bowdoin and Searsville. "Since it
will be getting darker in the coming
months and the lots are a bit farther
from the dorms, we thought we'd
make it as safe as possible," Law
said.
A new parking lot between Stern
and Wilbur has already been con
structed in an effort to ease parking
problems on Escondido Road.
Law said that Parking and
Transportation Services will contin
ue to offer the Far East and Far
West permits next year, although
there are no plans to add another
parking lot to the permit.
"There's really no more space
which we could use for the permit,"
she said. "For south residences we
don't even have this option, he
cause there are no free lots. But
we're always keeping our eye out
for more space."
