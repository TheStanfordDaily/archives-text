# Babe the Blue Ox: 'The Way We Were'
## 
### 
Babe the Blue Ox is a band trying to force its
way into a very exclusive and ritzy club. For
the time being, let us call this club"The World
of the Three-Piece Band." Admission is only granted
to the most promising bands comprised of three
members. Unfortunately for Babe and its Ox, the
bouncer has been taking his Beefcake and the band
has failed in its attempt.
This Brooklyn trio, with its latest release, "The Way
We Were," tries to bring its eclectic, bass-driven sound
to the stage of our club. With a sound that can be
compared to that of such bands as The Pixies, The B
52's, R.E.M. and even Parliament, you would figure
that Babe might have a chance. However, the one nec
essary item for admission that the band lacks is cre
ativity, and it lacks it in a major way.
For the most part, the 14 tracks on this album have
essentially the same exact sound. No substantial dis
tinction can be drawn between such songs as "My
Baby 'N' Me," "Basketball" and "F Train," and they
could all be renamed "Boring." Babe fares a little bet
ter on its slower ballads ("Plan B" and "If You See
Me") but don't get your hopes up.

There is promise, though. Tim Thomas has a rich,
deep baritone and Rose Thomson can carry a song by
herself with her pounding bass riffs
A band like this needs to take time and polish every
track on the album to make it. Just the opposite hap
pened on "The Way We Were." The album was
cranked out in four weeks and it shows.
For example, on the opening track "My Baby 'N'
Me," this phrase is uttered an unbelievable 16 times.
Even with the help of the veteran producer Steve
Thompson (Madonna, Blues Traveler), Babe the Blue
Ox still falls considerably short.
The only advice I can offer for the band is to study
the founding fathers of the Three-Piece Band move
ment, Nirvana, whose albums were chock-full of cre
ativity and ingenuity. There was never a dull moment
in Nirvana's songs and it did not matter that there were
only three instruments behind its impressive sound.
No samples or fills. No synthesizers. Simple yet
profound music. Until Babe the Blue Ox finds this, it
will continue to sit outside of the club in the cold.
