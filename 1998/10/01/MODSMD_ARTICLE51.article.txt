# The Candyskins
## 'Death of a Minor TV Celebrity' 
### 
The Candyskins definitely
have all the necessary ingre
dients for a Top-40 band.
The band's album, "Death of a
Minor TV Celebrity," influenced by
the Beatles, is ready to make a new
British invasion of the pop charts.
With its sugar-coated male vocals,
the band could be quite successful.
The Candyskins have a twinge of
Third Eye Blind's sound, but the
lead singer's vocals are more power
ful. His voice is sweet-sounding,
almost like Sean Lennon's, but not
nearly as annoying. Most of the
Candyskins' lyrics are on the happy
go-lucky side. For example, on
"Feed It,"the first track on this
album, the band proclaims, "There's
a place in the sun for everyone."
At the same time, there is also a
weepy aspect to the band's music. A

few tracks, including "Death of a
Minor TV Celebrity" and "Teenage
Suicide," are just perfect for those
depressed evenings home alone.
The Candyskins' main problem
on "Death of a Minor TV
Celebrity" is that the band is enter
ing a market saturated with a
sound identical to its own, and it is
very likely that this band will go
unnoticed. Its sound, composed of
soft male vocals, the mainly unob
trusive drummer, and vaguely
catchy guitar riffs, has become the
industry standard. Unless the
Candyskins become raging drunks
and smash up some hotel rooms,
the band members will probably
have to find themselves new
careers.
Having said that, for those of
you who like syrupy pop bands, the
Candyskins are defi-

nitely worth a listen.
You may just find
yourself catching the
band before its big
breakthrough.
