# Free Sexx
## Free Sexx When the bunk bed's rockin'... 
### Roxy Sass 
A techno remix of old Mariah Carey throbs in
the background, lights flash, and as you step into
the party, the bobbing herd of bodies absorbs
you. A strange scent lingers in the hot air,
though you can't be sure whether it's human
pheromones or Designer Impostors Body Spray.
You look around, noting the abundance of Lycra
tube tops and last year's class rings, and you
know: You are among frosh.
Walk into any campus party this first month
and the scene remains the same. Frosh, giddy
with their recent releases from boarding school,
home or jail, stream into the dating pool like so
many spawning salmon, ready to live the crazy
college life that "Animal House" promised them.
"Sex in the 90's" ("The Real World Stanford,"
for those of you who've been around for a while),
offers frosh a general introduction to the subject,
conjuring thoughts of the seedy trysts they hope
await them. Some frosh may even get a dorm trip
down to Cowell for a lesson in latex-style lovin'.
Then, with shiny, new condoms clutched in their
little palms and visions of single-digit purity test
scores dancing through their heads, they set forth.
Alas! If only having frosh sex was as simple as
planning it.
The problem for frosh is not a lack of dates. A
reasonably attractive girl or boy (read: no drool
ing, twitching or unsightly body hair) will cer
tainly be able to find a date, should she or he
desire it. Opportunities abound, whether a per
son has a taste for the good (the boy next door),
the bad (your Computer Science 106 A TA) or the
ugly (anyone affiliated with Paly High).
Eventually, the opportunity to go out presents
itself to almost everyone.
Il is only after the "official" date is done that
the true trouble begins. When it comes time to
have more after dinner than a cup of coffee, the
cruel joke lies Ed plays on frisky young frosh
lings becomes crystal clear. This joke is called a
"freshman dorm room."
Using the word "room," as anyone who didn't
live in Kimball freshman year can attest, is being
more than generous to the mouse-sized match
boxes issued to frosh. During freshman year,
Stanford students live literally stacked upon one
another, crammed two, three or even four into
the Lilliputian lodgings provided them. Needless
to say, these digs do not an easy hook-up make.
In fact, frosh living conditions can be down
right hazardous to a person's sex life. Think
about it. The perpetually present roommates of
both .i frosh and his / her paramour function a
bit like built-in chaperones, ever-vigilant for
new stains on the futon. And if a person ever did
get the room to himself, romping about on the
standard issue bunk beds would likely produce
squeaks so loud that the guy three floors down
would wink at him the next morning. What is
more, acrobatics on the upper bunk might make
a bed go down faster than the Hindenburg.
So what's a poor horny frosh to do? The
answer lies outside the glorified walls of the dorm
room. Where Res Ed fails, the rest of the world
excels, and for a frosh with the will and the wiles,
the campus provides a veritable smorgasbord of
places for a romantic romp. A healthy sense of

adventure, an ample libido and an eye for roving
police are all a person needs to partake.
Starting with the classics, a frosh who wants to
stay within the norms of out-of-dorm dallying
should take a trek to the south mezzanine of
Green Library. These farthest reaches of the
library domain have long provided refuge for
lusty frosh, due to the fact that their usual inhab
itants are book moths and grad students who
have long since gone blind from the lack of nat
ural light. Here, a couple can, well, couple, unin
terrupted by roommates and RAs. Afterwards
they can add to the wall of initials and lipstick
kisses that attest to the stacks' popularity.
Dorm laundry rooms should also be counted
among the tried and true places for fornication.
Maybe it's the smell of detergent. Maybe it's the
spin cycle. Maybe it's all those single discarded
socks. Whatever the reason, it seems that base
ment laundry rooms have seen as many students
getting down and dirty as getting clean. And
what could make doing laundry more pleasant?
From here, it gets more risky. An adventurous
frosh might put the "stud" back in the 24-hour
study room, or make the underground tunnels a
bit more steamy than usual. The top of Hoover
Tower could lend a pretty view when doing the
ugly, while those afraid of heights may prefer the
balcony of Memorial Auditorium. (Hello Flicks
pass!)
If having sex outside the dormitory really
means outdoors for a frosh, the rafts on Lake
Lag, or the beach near it, might be the right place
for a little picnic of champagne and mosquito
repellent. The newly rebuilt Rodin garden gener
ally clears out at dusk, leaving the place free for
frolicsome raccoons and frosh alike. Even the
foothills contain many a secluded niche for
nookie, though one must always make sure
whatever pokes isn't a snake.
The bottom line is this: The next time a frosh
slathers on a fresh coat of lip gloss or Brut and
heads out to bump and grind with the weekend
crowd, he or she should also bring along some
chutzpah. A little nerve is all that is needed to
get ahead of the shortcomings of frosh living
and get on to getting it on. And next year, one
might consider drawing into Synergy.
