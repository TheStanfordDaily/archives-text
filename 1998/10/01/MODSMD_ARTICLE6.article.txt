Along with selling mail-order bed sheets,
towels and pillows, Stanford Student Enterpris
es has made an addition this year â€” bicycles.
Now, incoming students can easily order a bike
along with their linens to be ready for them
when they arrive on campus.
However, students questioned whether the
bicycles weren't too expensive, at over $3(X).
"I just felt that the students needed a differ

After mailing the order form, all freshmen
who purchased this new item were greeted
upon their arrival on campus with a red-and
black Trek 8(X) by their d(x>r, complete with a
bike lock and light for a package deal of $3(K).
The option of a fender set increased the price to
$330.
Seth Cohen, one freshman who purchased a
bicycle, laughed as he said, "Everyone told me
that I was totally ripped off. I know. I'm a
schmuek, but it was really convenient. I arrived,
and there was a bike waiting at the door, the
keys on the desk, complete with registration
and everything. It saved a lot of hassle."
Many students on campus claim to have
spent an average of $100-$ 150 on their bikes
and don't have any problems with them.
According to several area bike shops, the
Trek S(M) is a new, popular model. Area bike
