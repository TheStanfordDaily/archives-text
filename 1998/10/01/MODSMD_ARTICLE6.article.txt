# Frosh order new bicycles through SSE
## 
### Sylvia Lin 
Along with selling mail-order bed sheets,
towels and pillows, Stanford Student Enterpris
es has made an addition this year — bicycles.
Now, incoming students can easily order a bike
along with their linens to be ready for them
when they arrive on campus.
However, students questioned whether the
bicycles weren't too expensive, at over $3(X).
"I just felt that the students needed a differ
ent option because this place is too expensive,"
said Chad Hollingsworth, manager of ASSU
Linen Service and the bike program. "Students
either had to buy a cheap, old bike or go to a pro
shop and buy a really exensive one. I just want
ed to give them a third option of buying a gtxxl
bike at a decent price."
Some freshmen took them up on the offer.
SSE sold more than 1(X) bikes during this pilot
program.

After mailing the order form, all freshmen
who purchased this new item were greeted
upon their arrival on campus with a red-and
black Trek 8(X) by their d(x>r, complete with a
bike lock and light for a package deal of $3(K).
The option of a fender set increased the price to
$330.
Seth Cohen, one freshman who purchased a
bicycle, laughed as he said, "Everyone told me
that I was totally ripped off. I know. I'm a
schmuek, but it was really convenient. I arrived,
and there was a bike waiting at the door, the
keys on the desk, complete with registration
and everything. It saved a lot of hassle."
Many students on campus claim to have
spent an average of $100-$ 150 on their bikes
and don't have any problems with them.
According to several area bike shops, the
Trek S(M) is a new, popular model. Area bike
stores tagged the high-end bike at
$250-$290, with an additional $40-
$70 for the bike lock and light. Thus,
SSE appears to be offering a com
petitive price.
"I called various area bike stores
to make the deal," said Hoi lings
worth. "It was definitely good. We
were able to cut down bike locks
and lights that are approximately
$35 dollars each to $30 for both."
"Well, it does save freshmen the
trouble of going out to buy the
bikes, the bike lock and light, espe
cially since the first couple of days
are hectic enough," said sophomore
Joy Hsu. "On the other hand, I def
initely think that SSE should offer
more choices — like offering a low
end bike as well as the high-end
bikes."
Other students echo Hsu's sug
gestion. "Freshmen come in spend
ing enough money as it is," said
sophomore Lindsay Gervacio. "I'm
just glad we weren't the guinea
pigs."
Hollingsworth said he will rec
ommend that next year's manager
continue the program, with some

revisions.
Despite the popular belief that
the SSE bikes seem overly expen
sive, this new addition is fairing well
with administrators as well as cus
tomers.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said, "We support any effort that
the ASSU makes to provide stu
dents with competitive prices or
even below market prices because
of their bulk purchasing power."
The project earned a small prof
it for the ASSU, as well as provided
a service to students.
"We're satisfied wth the results,"
said Hollingsworth. "There were a
lot of problems, but I think we defi
nitely were able to minimize them."
