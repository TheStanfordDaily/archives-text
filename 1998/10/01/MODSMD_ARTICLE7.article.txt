ford, Class of '98, couldn't ride a
bike. Less than three years later.
Gainsford was racing on the Bicy
cle MotoCross (BMX) national
circuit.
Gainsford got involved in rac
ing in his home town because he
lived near a BMX track. His father
took him to the tracks, and within
two weeks, he started racing on his
own.

tion and winning, which is obviously
huge," Gainsford said. "But the rea
son I started is to be riding my bike
and jumping."
Gainsford began racing at six and
a half, although many racers start
even younger, some less than three
years old.
"I was awful at first," Gainsford
said. "I got last [place] for a year. But
I was doing it because it was fun."
BMX racing is done on a dirt
track with seven or eight competi
tors at one time. The course includes
a series of jumps and quick turns.
Gainsford competed at the "A
Pro Level," which is the second most
intensive group of racers. Short of
the professionals who make racing
their life, his commitment was as
high as it could have been.
The sport, which is practiced all
over the world, is intense. Gainsford
said that between the ages of 10 and
18, he raced approximately 30 or 35
weekends a year.
As Gainsford became a better
racer, he increasingly found himself
in the spotlight. About age nine, he
started winning races. He placed

among the top three competitors in
his age group in almost all the races
that he was participating in.
"I was good, but I think it was
persistence and practice and all that
old stuff that you hear all the time.
Suddenly something started work
ing," he said.
Speeding around tracks from his
hometown of Monroe, Wash., to the
world championships in Canada,
Gainsford placed third in the world
in 1993 and second in 1994.
The world championships,
Gainsford said, are some of the most
competitive, yet enjoyable, races he
has participated in.
He was also featured on seveAl
covers of BMX magazines because
of his long time participation in the
sport.
Corporate sponsorship plays a
major role in BMX racing. Sponsors
pay for trips to races, hotels, clothing
and equipment. The sport requires
such large amounts of travel that
sponsorship is almost a necessity at
the higher levels.
Gainsford said that there is a lot
of pressure to perform well since
sponsors are paying so much money.
"There was certainly a time when
I was traveling all the time and my
sponsors were paying for my flights

and my hotels and my food," Gains
ford said. "I had to do good. You feel
the pressure."
Through those years of racing,
Gainsford's parents were extremely
supportive. But the pressure eventu
ally became so intense that he felt
burnt-out.
"My freshman year here, it was
getting to that point where I was
burning out," he said. "I'd just been
racing every weekend or every other
weekend for so long, I really didn't
want to be doing that anymore."
But Gainsford didn't quit. He cut
down on his racing hours. He knew
that he didn't want to make a career
out of it, but he still enjoys racing.
He insists that he now races for
fun, and doesn't feel undue pressure
from sponsors to succeed.
Gainsford said that a BMX bike
works to ride around campus,
though it is very different from the
bikes most students use. Although
he used it on campus, he wasn't able
to do much racing while riding to
class.
"I rode my racebike around cam
pus for four years," he said. "But I
ended up having to bunnv-hop my
self out of a lot of accidents by jump
ing out of the way while running
through White Plaza."
