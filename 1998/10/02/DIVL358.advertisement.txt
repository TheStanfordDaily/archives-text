D. E. Shaw <& Co., L.P. is a global investment bank founded by a
former Columbia University computer science professor. The firm
started in 1988 with seven employees, an initial investment of $28
million, and a plan for applying quantitative and computational
techniques to the securities business. Today, the D. E. Shaw group
comprises about a dozen closely related entities with a staff of over
a thousand and aggregate capital of $1.7 billion. At the core of our
business are systems and algorithms that move hundreds of billions
of dollars a year, and the extraordinarily gifted , programmers and
systems architects who build them.
As you might expect in a firm largely run by computer scientists, we
do things a bit differently from the rest of the Street. We wear jeans
and sneakers. We value technology over bureaucracy. And we see to
it that good ideas get implemented. We're growing fast, and we com
pensate exceptional people exceptionally well. To be considered for
an on-campus interview, please submit your resume and a cover
letter stating your GPA and standardized test scores to Career
