NEW COURSE
Individual Genetic Variation: Implications of the Coming Transformation
of Medicine
One Unit S/NC Med 253
As we understand more about the medical implications of individual genetic variation and
as sequencing genes becomes less expensive, medicine and public health will be trans
formed: It will become possible to use information about specific genetic variations to per
sonalize interventions.
In this day-long symposium, the Stanford Program in Genomics, Ethics, and Society will
present its report on the ethical, legal, and social implications arising from health promo
tion, disease prevention, and disease treatment based on individual genetic information.
Leaders in the fields of genetics, medicine, public health, law, ethics, and biotechnology will
comment on the PGES report. Conference speakers will reflect on future transformations
in health care brought about by the genomics revolution.
Saturday, October 17, 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Kresge Auditorium. Please see our Web site for
details http://www.stanford.edu/dept/scbe/indconf.htm
The Stanford Program in Genomics, Ethics & Society gratefully acknowledges funding for this symposium by
the U.S. Department of Energy Human Genome Program and the SmithKline Beecham Corporation.
