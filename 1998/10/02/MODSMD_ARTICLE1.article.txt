# Lasers correct farsightedness

### Meredith Rowe 
A revolutionary laser treat
ment technique to treat those who
experience farsightedness is cur
rently being tested by Edward
Manche, the director of the Stan
ford University Laser Refractive
Center.
Manche is holding a clinical
trial involving 200 patients which
will determine the usefulness of
the procedure, called LASIK, or
laser in-situ keratomileusis.
Laser surgery is already used
for correcting nearsightedness,
but this is one of the first studies in
the United States testing laser
surgery to correct farsightedness,
or hyperopia, according to the
Stanford Report.
Those who would benefit from
the surgery include people of all

ages suffering from hyperopia,
naturally or as a result of other
surgeries.
"Anybody who is farsighted
can undergo this procedure,"
Manche said. "Usually, those over
40 are more severely affected by
the condition, since farsightedness
is related to increasing age, but
anyone from 18 to 100 is eligible."
The entire treatment lasts
about 30 minutes. It involves lift
ing up a thin layer of the cornea so
that ultraviolet light and high en
ergy pulses from a laser can re
shape the internal cornea in about
60 seconds. After that, the flap is
moved back into its original posi
tion.
Another procedure, called
photo-refractive keratectomy, is
also used by surgeons to correct
farsightedness, but differs from
the new surgery.
"[LASIK] is a more modern
procedure," Manche said.
Though Manche is the only sur
geon at Stanford performing the
new procedure, other physicians
praise him for his experience in the
field.
"My understanding is that this
is a study unique to Stanford,"
Kuldev Singh, glaucoma special
ist, said. "Doctors are very excited
about it, and it's a new indication
for the use of a laser. Dr. Manche
has a wonderful reputation."
A recent patient of Manche,
Patricia Nutting, a technician at
the Stanford eye clinic, attests to
the value of the treatment.
"I've worn glasses all the time
for 13 years, due to hyperopia and
astigmatism," Nutting said. "I was
tired of wearing the glasses, and so
I decided to try LASIK. I had the
procedure Wednesday at 4:30, and
went home with a clear plastic
bubble over my eyes to protect
them. The next morning, after
going to bed and keeping my eyes
closed, I woke up and found that
my astigmatism was completely
gone."
Nutting was able to work in the

clinic the next day without any dis
comfort, and said that she re
mained pain-free while the treat
ment was being done as well.
"It was a lovely procedure, and
completely painless," she said.
"You feel pressure for about 60
seconds, which is uncomfortable,
but not painful."
Nutting said much of the rea
son the procedure ended in com
plete success for her was due to the
attention of Manche and his staff.
"They made me feel very com
fortable as a patient," she said.
"Dr. Manche was very reassuring
and professional throughout the
process. 1 would highly recom
mend LAS IK to anyone who is
farsighted."
However, no treatment is with
out potential drawbacks. Litera
ture describing the procedure
notes that slight, post-operative
discomfort is possible, along with
blurry vision for a short period of
time.
"The main risk associated with
LASIK is related to the flap being
created," Manche said. "As long
as the procedure is done by a
skilled surgeon, it should be suc
cessful."
Manche maintains that the
technique will make its mark in the
medical world.
"Most experts feel this will be
the procedure of choice," Manche
said.
