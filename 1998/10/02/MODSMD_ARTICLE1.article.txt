# Lasers correct farsightedness

A revolutionary laser treat
ment technique to treat those who
experience farsightedness is cur
rently being tested by Edward
Manche, the director of the Stan
ford University Laser Refractive
Center.
Manche is holding a clinical
trial involving 200 patients which
will determine the usefulness of
the procedure, called LASIK, or
laser in-situ keratomileusis.
Laser surgery is already used
for correcting nearsightedness,
but this is one of the first studies in
the United States testing laser
surgery to correct farsightedness,
or hyperopia, according to the
Stanford Report.
Those who would benefit from
the surgery include people of all

ages suffering from hyperopia,
naturally or as a result of other
surgeries.
"Anybody who is farsighted
can undergo this procedure,"
Manche said. "Usually, those over
40 are more severely affected by
the condition, since farsightedness
is related to increasing age, but
anyone from 18 to 100 is eligible."
The entire treatment lasts
about 30 minutes. It involves lift
ing up a thin layer of the cornea so
that ultraviolet light and high en
ergy pulses from a laser can re
shape the internal cornea in about
60 seconds. After that, the flap is
moved back into its original posi
tion.
Another procedure, called
photo-refractive keratectomy, is
