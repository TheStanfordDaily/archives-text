## Greenspan rescues hedge fund to protect U.S. economy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regulators
had to broker a bailout of a major hedge
fund to head off the risk of a "fire sale"
that could have further damaged the U.S.
economy at a time of global turmoil, Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
asserted Thursday.
The nation's largest banks, which
faced big losses if the hedge fund col
lapsed, already are hesitating to make the
loans that keep the U.S. economy grow
ing, the Fed found in a special survey.
And the fear that business credit will
dry up as global money managers pull out
from all but the safest investments con
tributed to another crushing day on Wall
Street.
The Dow Jones average of industrial
stocks plunged 210 points to 7,633, its
lowest close in three weeks. That repre
sented nearly a 6 percent loss since Mon
day, when traders were looking forward
to an interest-rate cut from the Fed.
But Tuesday's quarter-point cut
struck traders as inadequate to insulate
the U.S. economy from the turmoil that
has sent much of Asia and Russia into
recession and threatened Latin America.
Some major banks have passed the
reduction on to their customers by cut
ting their prime rates, but many others
have not.
"Effectively, what the banks have
done is to increase their (profit) spread to
absorb losses," said bank analyst Bert
Ely of Alexandria. Va.
Further evidence of what could be a
dawning credit crunch came in the Fed
survey, conducted in mid-September. It
found "a fairly widespread tightening of
standards and terms for commercial and

industrial loans to larger firms."
The report and Greenspan's com
ments came as financial and banking offi
cials of the seven richest industrial coun
tries — the United States, Japan. Ger
many, France, Britain, Canada and
Italy — prepared to discuss the interna
tional economic crisis on Saturday. That
session is being held in conjunction with
the annual meeting of the 182-nation
International Monetary Fund and its sis
ter lending group, the World Bank.
Leading up to that meeting. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, in a speech in
New York, called for a "new openness in
international finance" and the construc
tion of a financial system "far less suscep
tible to systemic instability."
IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus endorsed the Fed's rate cut.
but said rich countries as a whole must
push for strong growth to offset steep
recessions in Asia and Russia. Canada
also cut interest rates this week, and
Camdessus suggested European authori
ties should take similar steps.
The lending conditions found in the
Fed survey of 54 banks marked a dramat
ic difference from a similar survey con
ducted just a month earlier.
The August check found increased
competition among banks to make busi
ness loans and a narrowing profit margin
for most types of business loans.
Only three months ago, the Federal
Reserve found it necessary to warn
bankers to "maintain their lending disci
pline."
The latest survey found that larger
banks, such as those involved in backing
hedge funds, were "considerably more

likely than smaller banks to report hav
ing tightened standards." The tightening
came for large and medium-sized busi
ness borrowers.
The survey revealed little change in
standards and terms for loans to small
firms or consumers.
Economists warn, though, that credit
distress could quickly transfer from high
flying hedge funds, which cater to sophis
ticated wealthy investors, to Main Street
borrowers.
"If hedge funds have significant prob
lems. then the banks that lend to them
are going to have significant problems
and the banks in turn will have difficulty
making loans... to other businesses and
consumers." said economist Mark Zandi
of Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester. Pa.
Testifying to the House Banking
Committee, Greenspan played down the
impact of the Long-Term Capital Man
agement LP hedge fund's problems on
banks.
Banks that lent to the fund had collat
eral adequate to cover most of their
potential losses, he said.
Greenspan said regulators helped
arrange the Sept. 23 rescue — which did
not involve taxpayer money — because
Long-Term's failure could have inflicted
"substantial damage. .. on many market
participants... and could have potential
ly impaired the economies of many
nations, including our own."
"There is no reason for central bank
involvement unless there is substantial
probability that a fire sale would result in
severe, widespread and prolonged dis
ruptions," he said.
