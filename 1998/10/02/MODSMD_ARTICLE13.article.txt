### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Presi-
dent Clinton sought to revive his
stalled education agenda Thursday,
challenging lawmakers in the clos
ing days of Congress to spend "just
one day" on improving schools and
shrinking the size of classes.
"No issue has suffered more
from misplaced priorities and parti
san pursuits than America's public
schools," the president said in a
Rose Garden ceremony attended
by dozens of educators and Demo
cratic members of Congress.
Clinton's suggestion was that
Congress is spending too much time
on issues such as possible impeach

ment proceedings instead of more
important subjects. With time run
ning out for his education initia
tives, Clinton said, "One day, one
vote could make it happen."
Lawmakers hope to go home by
Oct. 9 to campaign, but may not be
able to get away that soon.
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chair
man of the House Education Com
mittee, denied that Congress has
ignored education, saying the
House has spent more than 30 days
on education bills.
"Despite what the president
wants, 1 recommend that we not
spend a minute debating the admin

istration's ill-conceived education
policies," doodling said. He said
Clinton's education agenda "con
sists of nothing more than duplica
tive government programs, unfund
ed mandates and more federal reg
ulations."
But Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Repub
licans were politicizing education.
"There are some things in life you
don't play politics with. ever.
They're just too important. For gen
erations of Americans our chil
drens' education was at the top of
that list but not anymore."
Presidential spokesman Mike

McCurry said Clinton was trying to
turn up the heat on Congress.
Clinton has asked Congress for
$12 billion over seven years to hire
1(K),(XX) teachers and reduce class
size to a national average of 18 in
grades first through third. He has
also proposed providing communi
ties with $22 billion in interest-free
bonds to help renovate, modernize
and build S.(KK) schools nationwide.
Clinton applauded the passage
of a higher education bill that
reduces the cost of student loans
but said the needs of pupils in
kindergarten through grade 12 need
to be addressed.
