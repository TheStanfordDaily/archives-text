# Boxer's challenger launches controversial ads

SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” U.S.
Senate challenger Matt Fong has
launched a TV ad campaign in Chi
nese. Spanish and English, hut only
the English-language version stress
es the importance of learning
English.
The English ad that began airing
Tuesday declares that children
should be taught to "read, write and
speak English so they are prepared
to get a job." The line does not
appear in versions in Spanish and
Cantonese and Mandarin, two
dialects of Chinese.
TTie English spot, however, does
not include a line that appears in the
other three languages: "Matt Fong's

highest priority is family."
Fong, the Republican state trea
surer. supported a ballot measure
last spring that all but did away with
bilingual education in California.
His opponent, one-term incum
bent Barbara Boxer, opposed
Proposition 227.
Boxer's campaign accused Fong
of dropping the line about teaching
kids in English in the Chinese and
Spanish ads to avoid niising the con
troversial topic of bilingual educa
tion. Chinese and Hispanics general
ly support bilingual education.
"He's clearly telling each group
something different." Boxer
spokeswoman Rose Kapolczynski

said today. "There is no other expla
nation for it."
Fong's spokesman said the line
was dropped in the other ads to meet
the 30-second format.
He also said the line was unneces
sary in the Mandarin, Cantonese and
Spanish spots.
"They know the importance of
their children speaking English,"
Schmidt said.
The four ads, which focus on edu
cation, show Fong, a fourth-genera
tion Chinese American who speaks
little Chinese, surrounded by an eth
nically diverse group of elementary
school youngsters.
A narrator describes Fong's sup

port for merit pay for teachers,
mandatory testing for students and
scholarships for the needy.
The ads make no mention of
Fong's support of school vouchers,
one of the key issues in the Senate
race.
Boxer opposes using government
money for private or religious school
tuition. Polls show education is sec
ond only to crime as an issue Cali
fornians care about.
The Fong ad is strikingly similar
to an ad that Boxer began airing sev
eral weeks ago, underscoring her
support for education and safe
schools, and showing her with a mul
ticultural group of schoolchildren.
