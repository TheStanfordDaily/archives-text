Road to be built through Alaskan wilderness
WASHINGTON (AP) — Environmentalists and the Clinton
administration lost a round Thursday when the Senate voted to build a
gravel road through a protected Alaska wilderness and provide over
land access to a remote wind-swept Aleutian fishing village.
The proposed 27-mile road has become a rallying point for environ
mentalists nationally, who argued it would set the stage for further road
building in wilderness areas.
Alaska's lawmakers called it a matter of safety for the nearly 8(M)
residents of King Cove, who now rely on boats to get in and out of the
community, even in medical emergencies during winter gales.
The Senate, by a 59-38 vote, agreed to grant a right-of-way for a 7-
mile stretch of the road through the I/embek National Wildlife Refuge
as part of a land exchange to connect King Cove and Cold Bay, which
has an all-weather airport.
The White House already has threatened to veto the bill, which has
yet to be considered by the House.
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, the sponsor, argued the road,
which would cost about $29 million, is long overdue, poses no harm to
wildlife in the refuge and would provide King Cove residents who need
medical attention an overland route to the Cold Bay airport.
"This road is about saving lives," argued Murkowski. calling it a life
line for the isolated fishing village in the Aleutian Islands. "Twenty
foot seas and 80-knot winds are not uncommon in the area."

Murkowski and Sen. Ted Stevens. R-Alaska. said at least 11 people
have died in King Cove sinee 1980 because they could not get swift
met ;tl ttcntion or were killed in crashes of airplanes attempting
medical rescues.
King Cove's isolation is undisputed.
Surrounded by treeless mountains that rise out of the Pacific Ocean,
the only access is by water or small plane, and even that can be treach
erous during much of the year as high winds roar through the moun
tains and whip up 20-foot swells across Cold Bay. In summer, fog can
cut off the community for days.
But critics of the road said there are other solutions, noting that a
$7(X).000 study is under way to find the best way to meet the medical
needs of the fishing village.
The road is opposed by nearly two dozen environmental organiza
tions, which argued that it would set a precedent for cutting roads
through other protected wilderness areas.
Wilson contains paparrazi
LOS ANGELES (AP) — California has passed a law that tries to
put a lens cap on paparazzi and their raw, high-priced and widely cir
culated photos of celebrities in private moments.
Next year, it will be illegal to take pictures like the now infamous
shots of Brad Pitt in the buff on a private beach or of Madonna's 1985
wedding to Sean Penn from one of the army of helicopters that swirled

above her Malibu mansion.
The law. designed to prevent intrusive hi-tech stalking, will t;ike
effect on Jan. 1.
"Under this bill, the so-called 'stalkera/./i' will be deterred from
driving their human prey to distraction — or even death." Wilson said.
The bill was introduced after Princess Diana was killed last year in
a Paris car crash following a high-speed flight from paparazzi, or
celebrity photographers.
However, the paparazzi who chased Diana would not have been
covered by California's law because her activities were in a public place
and there was no expectation of privacy.
Outrage at the paparazzi following Diana's death came from some
of the biggest names in show business—Madonna. Tom Cruise.
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sylvester Stallone and Elizabeth Taylor. 1 hey
called for everything from consumer boycotts of supermarket tabloids
to new laws on libel and privacy.
The new law forbids "constructive trespass." the use of technologi
cally advanced devices to watch or eavesdrop on someone in a situation
where he or she has "a reasonable expectation of privacy."
The bill defines invasion of privacy as trespassing with the intent to
capture audio or video images of a celebrity or crime victim engaging
in a personal or family activity.
It extends trespassing to electronic devices. And it allows the
celebrity or crime victim to recover damages from the paparazzi and
people who employ them.
