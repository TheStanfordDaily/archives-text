Testing forces considera
tion of who pays the price
for human knowledge

ON TUESDAY, I rcali/cd why I will
never go to medical school.
I was sitting in my neuroscience
class watching a film that demonstrated
how researchers record signals from resting
brain cells. Fairly technical stuff; innocuous
enough, right? Perhaps, except that those
resting brain cells were part of a live animal.
A cat, to be exact. A cat with an electrode
inserted in its brain. I wasn't the only one in
the class who felt sick and sad watching it.
Now you're thinking, "Rabid anti-ani
mal testing rant approaching. Must skip to
something less gross." Hut the difficult part
is that I'm not against animal testing. As a
biology major and the daughter of scien
tists, I know that humans have countless
monkeys, rabbits, mice, rats, cats and other
animals to thank for the vaccines,
medicines and consumer products we use
every day.
But that doesn't make it any easier to
accept. As a kid. I devoured the James Her
riot books, had two cats of my own, and
wanted to be a veterinarian when I grew up.
The whole putting-drops-in-rabbits'-eyes
thing didn't sit well with me..
I used to argue about this with my moth
er to mi avail. She runs an immunology lab
and tests humans for HIV, cancer and even
fetal defects. None of her work would be
possible if some small, furry friends of ours
hadn't been sacrificed, she said. And then
people would die. And that wasn't right.
But morality seems to break down when
it comes to animal testing. Our human code
of ethics says that harming and killing other
human beings is wrong. But it's okay to kill
and harm non-human beings, as long as it's
for our own good. After all, it's not our fault
if we have the knowledge and skills to

manipulate our environment.
Diseases are part of our environment.
We want to get rid of those. And animals
are a part of our environment, too. If we
work on animals, we are only manipulating
two parts of our environment — animals
and diseases. There seems to be no choice.
We can't just sit back and let our knowl
edge go to waste. We can't allow people to
die without doing everything in our human
power to save them.
The problem is that animals are not just
part of our environment. They are sentient
beings that think and feel. Maybe they
don't solve calculus problems or plan out
their futures like humans do, but nobody
questions the fact that animals sense pain.
They deserve the respect that we try — and
sometimes fail — to give each other.
Most researchers try to accommodate
animals' needs. Scientists are not callous.
Some even have pets at home. But it makes
sense to treat lab animals well. If test sub
jects are distressed and dying from non
experimental treatment, the research will
never reach an accurate conclusion.
But those of us who never have to set
foot in a lab can do something, too. We can
realize that this goes on, even though it
might seem unpleasant and even disturbing
to think about. Think about all the trials of
potential drugs that are happening in this
country. Every drug the FDA approves has
to be safety tested on animals before
humans can ever touch it.
We can't do much about that. But we
can buy brands that don't use animal test
ing. Testing on animals to develop new vac
cines is one thing; testing on animals to
make new and better kinds of lipstick or
toothpaste is another. It's not a sacrifice to
buy animal-friendly products.
We shouldn't go out and firebomb a lab
oratory. But we should realize that crea
tures lost their freedom, suffered, or even
died so we can live healthy lives.
