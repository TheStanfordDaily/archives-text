## Building a better residential life 
### 
James Monloya & Ramon Saldivar

AS WE MEET
with undergradu
ates this fall, don't
be surprised to hear us ask
for your opinions on a sub
ject close to your hearts:
residence life. As the two
Vice Provosts overseeing
Undergraduate Education

and Student Affairs, we have been working
together over the past year to implement
key recommendations of the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates.
Perhaps a little recent history is in order
before we share our progress related to the
Task Force recommendations. In October
1996, Provost Codoleezza Rice asked Vice
Provost Saldivar to chair a Task Force com
posed of currently enrolled students, facul
ty, and administrators to evaluate the prop
er relationship between residential pro
grams and undergraduate education and
the system of housing assignments. The
Task Force met weekly for one academic
year reviewing previous reports from the
Advising Task Force, the Internal Review
Committee of Housing and Dining Services
and the Residential Education Office.
The Task Force surveyed student views
on housing and residential programming,
held town hall meetings with students in the
residences, held three sessions with resident
fellows, and heard a variety of presentations
by then-Vice Provost Mary Edmonds and
other administrative officers with responsi
bilities for housing, dining services, and stu
dent housing assignments. Four goals guid
ed the Task Force's recommendations: 1)
To create the best possible integration
between academic programs and under
graduate housing, 2) To foster intellectual
and social faculty / student interaction, 3)
To enhance undergraduate academic and
social support by differentiation of

resources according to student needs, and
4) To foster the creation of University,
community and class identity.
The final report gave 32 recommenda
tions in four major categories, ranging from
providing better computer clusters in the
residences to making sophomore advising
dormitory-based to examining the possibili
ty of running the Draw in groups of 500.
Then, Provost Rice asked that we do a fea
sibility assessment and prioritize the recom
mendations of the Task Force. We formed
an implementation team consisting of stu
dents, professors, officials from Residential
Education and Housing and Dining Ser
vices and administrators.
Based upon recommendations by the
implementation group, we instituted the
first changes last year. In last spring's Draw,
students made residence choices with
knowledge of their Draw numbers and were
able to change their residence choices up
until the final deadline. We also changed
some housing configurations, allowing more
students to live in their preferred choice of
housing freshman year, while increasing the
opportunity for upper-class students to live
in two historically desirable residences.
Cardenal, Cedro and Soto have been
converted to all-freshman houses, while
Kimball has become a tjiree-class house.
Toyon has become an all-sophomore house,
enabling us to pilot incorporating sopho
more advising into a residence, and to have
a place where issues facing second-year stu
dents can be addressed through residence
programming. There have also been small
increases in the numbers of freshmen in
some four-class houses in an effort to create
supportive critical masses of freshmen in
each house where they reside.
We will focus on four major areas this
year. The first will be creating a "premier
year" in the housing assignment. Premier
year is a difficult concept. It means different

things to different stu
dents. For some it is a par
ticular residence or Row
house: for others it is a sin
gle or a two-room double
anywhere. Can the Uni
versity accommodate
everyone who wants a pre
mier year? Would this

mean that students not in a premier year
consistently get less desirable housing
assignments? We will also look at enhanc
ing academic support structures for upper
class students, and creating a
freshman / sophomore college pilot pro
gram for the 1999-2(KK) academic year.
Some of our recommendations have
been controversial. Our task is not easy.
There are lots of ideas, lots of opinions, and
lots of complications. We have learned
much through this process. First and fore
most, the more significantly we involve stu
dents, the better results we get. This year's
work will no doubt include student focus
groups and perhaps additional surveys.
Secondly, we cannot tamper with any
part of the system without significant effects
on other parts of the system. Our housing
program is a complex and diverse entity
serving thousands of people that has
evolved over many, many years.
It has taken much time on the part of
many faculty and students to come up with
the best way to design a residential educa
tion. But we believe the Stanford living expe
rience is ultimately worth it. One of our most
fundamental commitments is that your resi
dential experience should augment your aca
demic experience, not be separate from it.
