## Co-op Council spurs interest 
### Sarah Rapawy 
The Co-op Council, a group
formed last year to promote commu
nity spirit and new interest in the co
operative houses, had its first meet
ing of the year last night at Chi Theta
Chi.
As Gummi Bears, Fig Newtons
and yogurt pretzels were passed
around, representatives from each of
the co-ops discussed ways to recruit
freshmen and maintain good ties
with the University in a time of dwin
dling co-op support.
Last year, co-ops had problems

filling their houses, and the Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest had 12 walk-ins.
Around four people also left Synergy
in the middle of the year, having been
placed there by accident and unpre
pared for the time commmittment
that co-op life demands.
"Projects like the co-ops are
under a lot of fire from the Universi
ty; we're a pain in the ass because we
are an exception to every rule," said
Chi Theta Chi resident Samar
Mehta.
A main concern of last night's
meeting was how to spread the word
about co-ops among freshmen.
" The Greek system started re
cruiting freshmen last week, telling
them how good it is," said Mehta.
"Except for the really good, crunchy,
Grateful Dead freshmen who wear
lots of tie-dye, we have very little im
pact on them."
The council spoke of setting up
regularly scheduled parties at the co
ops.
"The point is to have repeated

events that rotate from house to
house that are bound to introduce
people to the system," said Mehta.
However, the suggestion of flyering
campus dorms to advertise co-op par
ties received mixed reactions, as
some representatives feared the cre
ation of a fraternity party atmost
phere.
"That's one thing I don't like
about frat parties — hoards of fresh
men drinking cheap beer. It's a differ
ent environment. We don't want it to
be like, "What's tonight,' 'It's the Co
op party!' And then Branner ar
rives," said Chi Theta Chi resident
Taylor Boas.

Another main concern of the
council was the preservation of co-op
mural art.
Over the past few years, the Capi
tal Improvement Project has been
renovating campus residences. For
co-ops such as Kairos and Ham
marskjold, this meant the walls were
whitewashed and their murals lost.
Council members felt this was un
fair given the University's respect for
Casa Zapata's murals, "It's such a
double standard. For Zapata, the
University says, 'An artist came in
and painted these.' " said Boas.
Last year Terra successfully peti
tioned to save its murals before its

renovation by photo-documenting
the murals and talking with the Uni
versity.
Despite some friction with the
University and a current reliance on
walk-ins, the council is busy planning
new events and is optimistic for the
future.
After instituting a co-op aware
ness week, holding a booth in White
Plaza and circulating a co-op guide,
over 250 applicants requested priori
ty in Chi Theta Chi last year. "The
lists were overflowing," said Chi
Theta Chi house manager, Emily
Johnson.
Yet co-ops have seen even better

days and have a rich history on Stan
ford campus. Establishing a co-op
council was not a new idea — there
existed an active and thriving group
during the 1970s and '80s.
"Co-ops used to be better orga
nized. People would visit each other
among the co-ops. It was a lot of peo
ple with similar interests and con
cerns," said Mehta.
Mehta thought to re-institute the
council last year when, rummaging
through boxes of former co-op
archives, he found more than 3(X) let
ters from Synergy alumni, written in
the '80s to protest a University at
tempt to close the house.

"There were a flood of letters
more or less all saying the same thing,
'Please don't close Synergy, it would
be a loss to the University,"' said
Mehta. "It's kind of moving."
Among the archives, Mehta found
interesting artifacts that the Office of
Residential Education has since
agreed to give money to have bound
or scanned for preservation. Artifacts
include photos of current Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya in front of his Stanford resi
dence, Columbae, and articles about
the El Salvadorian refugee Colum
bae hosted in the '70s when the house
had declared itself a political asylum.
