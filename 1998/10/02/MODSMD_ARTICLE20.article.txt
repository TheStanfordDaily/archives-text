## Seeking quality amid Puffy and warm beer

DO YOU LIKE to freak? Are you
among the last at a party, getting
down on some guy's leg to the heat
of the latest Puff Daddy rip-off? If so. keep
dancing.
Is your idea of good music the stuff
troubadours spill all over the coffee house
on the occasional weeknight? Was Cake's
performance in Dinkelspiel the best con
cert you have ever seen? If so, keep listen
ing.
The rest of us are upset. This campus is
foaming with talent. Gold-medal athletes
discuss human biology with famous actors.
Stories of our Final Four basketball team
run next to stories about the latest under
graduate entrepreneurs to hit it big. But
where, I ask you. is all the music?
We have more a cappella groups than
anyone can count. We have choirs and
choruses, orchestras and musicals. And yet

in the midst of all this culture, thore is not
a single well-known band on campus. In
years past we had Labrosse King, later
called Canvas. They played often and lots
of people liked them. But that's it. Two
years, one band. Over 6,(XX) undergradu
ates live on this campus. Do you mean to
tell me those were the only guys who could
play?
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe lots of bands
out there are cursing Stanford right now
for its lack of exposure opportunities.
Maybe they are cursing social chairs who
hire the same DJs to play the same songs
party after party after party. Maybe the
musicians are cursing the Coffee House
for only giving them 10 minutes at open
mike. Maybe they are cursing EBF. that
musical oasis, for always importing bands
instead of finding them on campus. Maybe
thev are and mavbe thev are not.

Regardless, the musical scene at Stan
ford is abysmal and embarrassing. Social
chairs hire inexpensive DJs so their guests
can freak and maybe they can too. The
notion of providing quality entertainment
is discarded with the University's memo
about EANABs.
It is often said that college parties allow
people to do two things â€” to get drunk
and to hook up. I submit that this would
not necessarily be the case if there were
anything to do at a party besides freak to
Puffy. I contend that good music makes
for a fulfilling evening, void of unwanted
party talk and pick-up lines. A good band
at a good party sends people home happy.
It's not just social chairs who neglect
this opportunity. For what reason, I beg of
you. was Frost Amphitheater built? In my
experience, its sole purpose has been
Frosted Flicks. Has anyone noticed a sta

dium that fits HO.(MM) people around here?
I guess we'll need that space when we win
the Rose Bowl, but until then, could we
get some music please?
The San Francisco Bay Area has histor
ically been a musical hotbed. Places like
Berkeley, Haight-Ashbury and Golden
Gate Park were synonymous with the '60s
and good music. It still is a great spot for
music, but why must a void exist in such a
high-potential environment as Stanford?
The Grateful Dead used to play at
Stanford every year. The University dis
continued this tradition a few years before
Jerry Garcia's death because they thought
the drug element that accompanied the
band was undesirable. But must we have
no element at all?
I can count the number of concerts on
campus over the last two years on the fin
gers of one hand. The Stanford Concert

Network needs to step into its name and
earn its special fees. This campus is too
quiet considering the opportunities
around.
So play music in White Plaza. We will
stop and listen. Play at a fraternity party and
maybe you'll get asked to do others. Get big
bands to come and play in our big stadium
and it will be worth it. Perhaps one day we
will have the choice whether to go to Frost
Amphitheater to hear quality music or to
Kappa Sig for a quality freak. Maybe one
day you'll be able to push yourself from the
hot beer mass line of a Sigma Chi party into
open air where someone is doing something
worth watching. Ah. reverie.
