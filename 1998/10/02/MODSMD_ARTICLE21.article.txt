## Top of the PAC Leroux's hat-trick puts Card up easy 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
Monique Leroux had been
having a very good senior year for
Stanford's field hockey team thus
far.
Yesterday, she made it a great
year.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Yesterday: Stanford 5, Davis &
Elkins 0.

Scoring three goals in yester
day's 5-0 Cardinal victory over
Davis & Elkins, Leroux recorded
a hat-trick and added to two Stan
ford goals by junior Lindsey
Dunagan.
More importantly, Leroux
and Dunagan helped the Cardi
nal remain undefeated in the
Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference.
"I seriously got the ball in all
the right spots," Leroux said. "All
of our midfielders and backs
were feeding it in just the right
spots."
With the victory, the Cardinal
improved its overall record to 6-2,
and improved its conference

record to 3-0.
"It was a huge game because it
was a conference game," Leroux
added. "It's always really impor
tant for us to do really well in our
conference games to help us get
to the NCAAs."
Stanford jumped to a 1-0 lead
early when Dunagan scored the
first goal of the game off a pass
from Leroux with 25 minutes re
maining in the half. Less than two
minutes later. Leroux scored her
first of the game, giving the Car
dinal a 2-0 lead.
Head coach Sheryl Johnson
certainly appreciated the offen
sive production of her players of
late. With the Cardinal leading
the NorPac in every category,
and two Stanford players now
nailing hat-tricks in the last two
weeks, Johnson couldn't have
been happier.
"It's hard to score a hat trick,"
Johnson said, reflecting on both
Leroux's performance and that
of senior Justina Williams, who
scored three goals against UC-
Santa Barbara on Sept. 27.
"I think our game is really
clicking right now," Johnson
added.
