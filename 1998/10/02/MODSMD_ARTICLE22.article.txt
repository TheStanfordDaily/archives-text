# Cardinal looking to rebound
## Football team takes off for South Bend to face No. 23 Irish 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Moving forward.
That is the mindset the Stanford football team
takes after last week's demoralizing 63-28 loss to
Oregon as it prepares to take off for South Bend,
Ind., for tomorrow's game against No. 23 Notre
Dame (2-1).
Notre Dame, fresh off squeaking out a win
over underdog Purdue last week, has struggled
since their season opener, a 36-20 victory over
Michigan. The Irish dropped their next contest
45-23 to Michigan state, a game that was not as
close as the score indicates, as they trailed 42-3 at
the half.
"We were just in shock, the way that game
went. It's time to go on," said Notre Dame head
coach Bob Davie. "It's time to become more con

sistent. We really do need to get into a rhythm
and 1 think we can do that this week.

"I think we're about where we were after the
Michigan game. It's exciting to move forward."
Stanford (1-3), meanwhile, will try to forget a
game in which the Cardinal allowed the most
points in a Stanford game since 1954. The Ducks
racked up 664 yards of total offense, and rushed
for five touchdowns.
"One of the areas we've struggled in is giving
up big plays," said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "When you can't make a team one

dimensional, they get difficult. [Oregon) kept
both barrels of their gun loaded."
The Irish have quietly averaged 30 points a
game, but present an entirely different challenge
than Oregon did.
"We're not a flashy offense." Davie said. "We
seem to find a way to hang in there. This football
team knows how to win."
That might be what Willingham is afraid of.
"They are getting points on the board. They
mix in the option, which in terms of preparation,
is a problem." Willingham said.
Notre Dame senior tailback Autry Denson is
averaging 122 yards per game with five rushing
touchdowns, good for 14th in the nation. Last
year, he was one of the bright spots in Notre
Dame's loss at Stanford stadium, with 116 yards
rushing.
The Cardinal will have to contain
Denson and minimize the Irish time
of possession. Given the defense's
efforts against Oregon's Reuben
Droughns last week, that will not be
easy, as the junior tailback racked up
214 yards on the ground.
Stanford may not hold the edge in
the history of the rivalry with Notre
Dame, but recently the tides have
been turning. The Irish hold an 8-4
lead in the series, which began on
New Year's Day in 1925 with Knute
Rockne and the Four Horsemen de
feating Stanford in the Rose bowl.
Stanford, however, took last
year's contest, 33-15. Then senior
running backs Mike Mitchell and
Anthony Bookman combined for
277 yards rushing.
The Cardinal will likely enter the
third straight game without flanker
Troy Walters, as his ankle injury suf
fered against Arizona leaves him
listed as uncertain.
This marks the first injury of Wal
ters' career, including both college
and hii»h school.
