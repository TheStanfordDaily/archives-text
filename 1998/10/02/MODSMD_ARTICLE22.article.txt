# Cardinal looking to rebound
## Football team takes off for South Bend to face No. 23 Irish 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Moving forward.
That is the mindset the Stanford football team
takes after last week's demoralizing 63-28 loss to
Oregon as it prepares to take off for South Bend,
Ind., for tomorrow's game against No. 23 Notre
Dame (2-1).
Notre Dame, fresh off squeaking out a win
over underdog Purdue last week, has struggled
since their season opener, a 36-20 victory over
Michigan. The Irish dropped their next contest
45-23 to Michigan state, a game that was not as
close as the score indicates, as they trailed 42-3 at
the half.
"We were just in shock, the way that game
went. It's time to go on," said Notre Dame head
coach Bob Davie. "It's time to become more con

sistent. We really do need to get into a rhythm
and 1 think we can do that this week.

"I think we're about where we were after the
Michigan game. It's exciting to move forward."
Stanford (1-3), meanwhile, will try to forget a
game in which the Cardinal allowed the most
points in a Stanford game since 1954. The Ducks
racked up 664 yards of total offense, and rushed
for five touchdowns.
"One of the areas we've struggled in is giving
up big plays," said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "When you can't make a team one

dimensional, they get difficult. [Oregon) kept
both barrels of their gun loaded."
The Irish have quietly averaged 30 points a
game, but present an entirely different challenge
than Oregon did.
"We're not a flashy offense." Davie said. "We
seem to find a way to hang in there. This football
team knows how to win."
That might be what Willingham is afraid of.
"They are getting points on the board. They
mix in the option, which in terms of preparation,
is a problem." Willingham said.
Notre Dame senior tailback Autry Denson is
averaging 122 yards per game with five rushing
touchdowns, good for 14th in the nation. Last
year, he was one of the bright spots in Notre
Dame's loss at Stanford stadium, with 116 yards
