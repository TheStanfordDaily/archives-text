# Stanford's 'Big Splash' tomorrow
## No. 3 Cardinal gearing up for No. 4 Cal Bears 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
ESPN2 called it one of the great
rivalries in sports. It would be almost
impossible to find a pair of teams in
any sport which are as evenly
matched — and have been for the
past 25 years — as the Stanford and
California varsity men's water polo
teams.

MEN'S WATER POU)
■ Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford (7-1,1-
0 MPSF Conference) vs. No. 4 Cali
fornia (2-1). deGuerre Pool, 3 p.m.

In the last quarter century, the
record between the Bay Area rivals
has been 46-44, with three ties and
Cal leading in wins. Stanford and
Cal have combined to win 19 of the
29 championships since water polo
became an NCAA sport in 1969.
The rival squads have met in the
NCAA national championship
match six times and each school
came away with three titles.
Last year, Cal beat Stanford
twice before the Cardinal defeated
the Bears, 5-4, in the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation Tourna
ment.
With all that history, Stanford
and Cal will face each other for the
first time this season when the Car
dinal hosts the Golden Bears this
Saturday at 1 p.m. at deGuerre pool.
"This is probably the most in
tense water polo rivalry," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"It's a great rivalry because of the
success of both of our programs.
We're usually the top two teams in
the country, so we're always battling

for something."
Under the direction of Detta
manti, who is currently in his 22nd
season as head coach, the Cardinal
has captured eight national titles.
The Cal squad has been led by coach
Steve Heaston for the last decade,
during which the Golden Bears won
three NCAA championships.
Dettamanti is one of the most
successful coaches in water polo his
tory. Having collected 498 wins dur
ing his tenure at Stanford. Detta
manti is rapidly approaching the
S(X)-win plateau. Two more wins will
make Dettamanti the third coach in
NCAA water polo history to accom
plish the feat.
Heaston has been an inspira
tional figure for his team, as well as
for the entire sport, and will be hon
ored by the Stanford Athletic De
partment in a ceremony before Sat
urday's Big Splash.
Heaston "will be recognized for
his contribution to the sport of water
polo, his contribution to the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry, his success at Cal,
and his courage and determination
in coaching," Dettamanti said.
Heaston has returned to coach
his squad, even after undergoing nu
merous surgeries for cancer.

Through it all. the relationship and
the rivalry has remained strong be
tween the two programs.
"It's a friendly rivalry," Detta
manti said. "We respect each other's
players, coaches, and programs.
There's never any animosity. When
the other team wins, we congratu
late them."
In the national rankings released
yesterday, Stanford and Cal were
ranked third and fourth, respective
ly. The Cal team has the advantage
of fielding some talented and formi
dable left-handed players.
"Their four top players are left
handed." said Dettamanti. "They do
the opposite of what most teams do,
so we have to flip-Hop our defense.
Both of their hole-sets are lefties
[and| it's tough to play teams who
have one left-handed player. Cal has
four, so we have to prepare for that."
The Stanford and Cal squads
both boast an impressive amount of
depth and speed and both teams
have talented men in the cage.
"We're pretty well matched,"
Dettamanti said. "Both teams have
good defense. Most of our games
have been ties or one-goal games.
We have similar speed, experience,
depth, and goalies. After [Stanford

senior] Chris [Aguilera], Cals goalie
Peter Kieffer is probably the best
goalie in the NCAA. Cal's one ad
vantage is that they have more left
ies."
Stanford is currently 7-1 for the
season and Cal is 5-1. Both teams are
1-0 in the MPSF. Saturday's game is
one of eight games in the MPSF sea
son and only two teams from the
MPSF will travel to the NCAA tour
nament — the winner of the MPSF
championships and the team with
the best record in the league season.
"These [league] games are very
important [and] seeding is critical."
said Dettamanti. "We can't relax.
Every game is a pressure game be
cause you want to go into the con
ference championships with the best
record possible. The team that can
stay consistent will be the team that
comes out at the end."
Stanford and Cal both suffered
their single losses of the season to
top-ranked USC in the preseason
Southern California Tournament.
The Bears fell to the Trojans, 11-6,
while the Cardinal lost its match, 7-6.
"We're playing well right now."
Dettamanti said. "Besides USC. this
will probably be our toughest match
of the vear."
