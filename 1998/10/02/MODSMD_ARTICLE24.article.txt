At a University with such a storied athletic past, suc
cess is often taken for granted and the stunning achieve
ments of teams and individuals go unnoticed.

Not tonight.
This evening at Maples Pavilion, fans will have the
opportunity to celebrate the rich history of Stanford
women's volleyball and salute the incomparable success
of head coach Don Shaw.
The members of the class of 1998 will be on hand to
help the Cardinal unveil its 1997 NC A A Championship
banner. In many ways, the class of '98 embodies the un

as it led the Cardinal to three national championships
and a 125-8 record.

to do is maintain our position on top.
"There is no way we can get caught up in these cere
monies." he added. "The teams coming in this weekend
could easily take a couple of wins away from us if we
make too many mistakes.
The Cardinal has found its way to the top of th • Pac
-10 with a young and inexperienced team that approach
es each match as an opportunity to improve on the last.
Therefore, there are no easy wins, even at home against
Washington State, tonight at 7 p.m., or Sunday against-
Washington at 1 p.m.
"We have played fairly well so far." Shaw said. "But
we still have a lot to learn. W often have two freshmen
