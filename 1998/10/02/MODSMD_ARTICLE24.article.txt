Not tonight.
This evening at Maples Pavilion, fans will have the
opportunity to celebrate the rich history of Stanford
women's volleyball and salute the incomparable success
of head coach Don Shaw.
The members of the class of 1998 will be on hand to
help the Cardinal unveil its 1997 NC A A Championship
banner. In many ways, the class of '98 embodies the un
believable success of the Stanford program under Shaw,
as it led the Cardinal to three national championships
and a 125-8 record.
Under ordinary circumstances, saying a final good
bye to the class of "98 might leave Cardinal fans let down,
praying for some day in the future when they could wit

ness a comparable Stanford milestone.
But this is no ordinary program, no oidinary coach.
A win in tonight's match against Washington State
would give Shaw his 2(K>th Pacific-10 Conference victo
ry. He would become the first coach in Pac-10 history to
reach this mark.
Shaw is too dedicated to his team to get caught up in
personal achievements, however, and he has other
things on his mind —like how to beat Washington and
Washington State.
"I am more concerned with the matches," Sl.aw said
when asked about the prospect of win No. 200. "2(H) is
just an arbitrary number on paper. It won't change what
happens on the court. The most important thing we need
to do is maintain our position on top.
"There is no way we can get caught up in these cere
monies." he added. "The teams coming in this weekend
could easily take a couple of wins away from us if we
make too many mistakes.
The Cardinal has found its way to the top of th • Pac
-10 with a young and inexperienced team that approach
es each match as an opportunity to improve on the last.
Therefore, there are no easy wins, even at home against
Washington State, tonight at 7 p.m., or Sunday against-
Washington at 1 p.m.
"We have played fairly well so far." Shaw said. "But
we still have a lot to learn. W often have two freshmen
and two sophomores on the court at
a time who. coming into the season,
had little or no experience. So we are
still figuring out where we are. But it
is encouraging that we have found
ways to win."
If the Cardinal is to defeat the
Washington schools, there are sever
al areas where it must improve.
Stanford's first area of difficulty is
found at the beginning of all point
scoring opportunities: a weak ser
vice game. So far on the season, the
Card has committed 75 service er
rors while posting only 29 aces.
"We need to serve tough, and we
didn't start thc > season doing that,"
Shaw said. "We have missed serves
at inopportune times. We need to
concentrate in that area because if
we start serving well, we will make it
a lot easier on our offense."
Secondly, the performance from
the left side of the Cardinal offense
has been erratic thus far. Due to the
nagging shoulder injury of junior
outside hitter Kerri Walsh on the
right side, opposing defenses are
keying on the left side more often,

forcing the left side hitters (junior
Jaimi Gregory, sophomore Sarah
Clark and freshman Michelle Cham
bers) to carry an unbearable load on
offense.
"We need to see some better stats
from our left side hitters," said Shaw.
"It is hard to expect them to adapt to
the newly added pressure.
The Cardinal would also love to
see sophomore setter Robyn Lewis
continue her solid play at the net.
Lewis was recently named the every
day setter, after splitting time in the
early season with sophomore Lind
say Kagawa, and has stepped up all
areas of her game. On top of her set
ting responsibilities, Lewis has since
been asked to pick up some of the
hitting and blocking load.
"We needed to make a decision
and give ourselves some continuity
at that position." Shaw said. "We de
cided that Robyn gave us a lot of
presence at the net and she showed
the ability to lead and make deci
sions on the run.
"When Kerri is out there at full
strength, we set her to attack out of
the back row. Since she is not hitting
at 100 percent, we needed Robyn to
pick up some of the slack at the net
and she has done that."

Another member of the Stanford
squad that is making a name for her
self is sophomore middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer. Detmer leads the
team in kills per game (3.89). and
blocks per game (1.87).
"She has worked hard, and de
serves what she's gotten," Shaw said.
Unfortunately, what she has
earned is more attention from op
posing defenses.
B "She can no longer go out there
unnoticed, like she did last year,"
Shaw said of his emerging offensive
power. "This will be a great learning
experience for her because she will
have to learn to adapt to having
more blockers committed to her."
As the young Stanford team con
tinues to improve and mature in all
of these areas, only good things will
happen for the rest of this season.
Shaw, however, warns that his
team will need a little luck and a
healthy roster to stay on top of the
delicately balanced Pac-10 stand
ings.
"We have been involved in four
4-game matches that we were lucky
enough to win," Shaw said. "With a
few breaks here or there, those
games could have easily gone the
other wav.

cess is often taken for granted and the stunning achieve
ments of teams and individuals go unnoticed.
