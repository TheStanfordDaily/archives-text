# 'Thinker' ponders on road
## 
### Taryn Wilgus 
A noticeable absence on cam
pus as the fall quarter begins is
"The Thinker," the statue that usu
ally sits as an example of intellect

for Stanford students in front of
Meyer Library.
The missing intellectual has left
students and faculty wondering
where it is.
New York City's Rockefeller

Center borrowed "The Thinker"
for their 70th anniversary celebra
tion. The statue departed May 28.
It was originally expected to re
turn in mid-September, before the
quarter started and students re
turned. However, the statue is still
in New York, and after it leaves, it
will be on display at the White
House.
The statue is missed by many
Stanford students. "It makes
Meyer Library look naked," said
senior Marc Mazzoni. "Bring it
back. It's ours."
While some freshmen are not
even aware the statue is not here,
others feel it is an important part of
Stanford's campus.
"It's symbolic of Stanford's in
tellect," said freshman Joel Segre.
" The Thinker" is a creation of
the French sculptor Auguste
Rodin, who died in 1917. "Fertile
thought slowly elaborates itself
within his brain," Rodin said of his
statue. "He is no longer dreamer,
he is creator."
The statue was a gift from the
Cantor family, which actually owns
90 percent of it. The family has the
ultimate say over where the statue
goes, rather than the University.
"They are free to exercise their
right to use it for other purposes,"
said Stanford Art Museum Direc
tor Thomas Seligman.
Seligman was unaware of any
student reactions regarding the ab
sence of "The Thinker."
For those who don't want to
wait until "The Thinker" returns to
appreciate Rodin's work, authentic
casts of other Rodin sculptures
stand in the sculpture garden and
elsewhere on campus.
No one knows when "The
Thinker" will return.

New Yorkers and Washingtonians are currently taking their shot at
figuring out what Rodin's subject is thinking of.
