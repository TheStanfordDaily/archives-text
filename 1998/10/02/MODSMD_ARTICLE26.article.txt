today with a match against Southern Methodist (4-4-0).

■ Today: No. 15 Stanford (5-1 -2) vs. Southern Methodist
(4-4-0). New Maloney Field, 3 p.m.

In last Sunday's tie, Stanford's sophomore goal
keeper Carly Smolak posted 10 saves and was later
named the Pac-10 Player of the Week.
In Smolak's six starts, she carries a .750goals-against
average, good enough to place her in the top 20 nation
ally and second in the Pac-10. Her three shutouts also
place her second in the conference.
SMU is led by Jamie Campanaro, who has scored

four goals this season.
The Lady Mustangs have two competent players
who could make appearances in the goal — Becca Lief
and Erin Poole. Leifs goals-against average is 1.434,
while Poole's is just below that, at 1.440.
"We expect them to be well coached and orga
nized," said Stanford head coach Steve Swanson. "It
will be a demanding game from our standpoint, espe
cially after the Santa Clara match."
Swanson expects SMU to put forward a strong de
fensive front and thinks that the Cardinal will have to
keep strong offensive pressure on in order to stay in the
match.
The Cardinal will rally offensively behind senior
midfielder Tracye Lawyer, the Pac-10's fourth-leading
scorer. Lawyer has scored three game-winning goals
this season alone.
"Our team is playing with a lot of confidence, but we
need to continue to work hard for the full 90 minutes,"
Swanson said. "We want to keep our momentum."
