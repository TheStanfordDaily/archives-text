# iMac at the core of computer buys
## Bookstore's Microdisc also sees increase in PC purchases 
### Sarah L. Matics 
With this year's introduction of
the iMac computer, the Apple is at
the core of campus computer pur
chases.
The Bookstore's sales indicate
that "overall theme is the Apple is
back," said Tim Keely, account exec
utive in the Bookstore's Microdisc
Department.
Recovering from a sales slide last

year, Macintoshes have strength
ened their position as top seller at the
Bookstore. According to Keely, 183
iMacs have been sold this year at
Si, 229 each.
But although the Bookstore's
Macintosh sales have continued to
outnumber PC sales this year, PC
sales have continued to increase.
PC models are priced at the
Bookstore in the $1,400 to $1,500
range.

The bright color and unique de
sign of Apple's newest contribution
to the technology buffet make it hard
to miss.
The iMac is a compact model with
both a built-in monitor and network
connection but no floppy drive.
The Bookstore has been promot
ing the sale of Macintoshes aggres
sively, taking advantage of the ex
citement the iMac creates.
Many students have noticed the

pyramid of iMacs in the front of the
Bookstore, where students can play
around with a inaehine on the floor.
During Demo Day, held July 30
in front of the Bookstore, various
software companies sent representa
tives to speak with 3(X) to 4(H) cus
tomers.
Vendors and companies also
offer educational discounts to stu
dents considering a computer pur
chase.
Freshman Nick Torrey recently
purchased an iMae at the Bookstore.
"The iMac is cheap and powerful,"
he said, citing both the "ease of set
up" and its "all-in-one box" feel as
attractive.
Yet, Torrey observes, the campus
seems evenly split between PC's and
Macintoshes.
Residential Computer Coordina
tor ( IiITS/u. however, sees more res
idents with PCs than with Macin
toshes.
A junior in Twain, Szu noticed
four or five iMacs in the mix of com
puters that residents set up in their
rooms.
Although S/u acknowledges that
both PCs and Macintoshes have
their applications and benefits, he
said, "It's pretty clear that we're a
strong Mac campus."
Still, many students come to Stan
ford with previously-owned PCs, he
said, even though Stanford has a
Macintosh background.
S/u found many returning stu
dents may already have purchased
PCs, while new students are turning
toward Apple.
