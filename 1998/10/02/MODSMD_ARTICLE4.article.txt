# Jasper Ridge celebrates 25
## Distinguished profs to share thoughts at forum 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
In honor of the 25th anniversary
of Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biologi
cal Preserve, a forum entitled
"Global Change — A Local Lega
cy," moderated by Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy and featuring a
panel of distinguished Stanford fac
ulty members will be held tomor
row at 4 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
This event will feature members
of the Stanford community with in
dividual commitments to ecologi
cal preservation.
In addition to the forum's com
memoration of the Jasper Ridge
anniversary, it will also celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the School
of Humanities and Sciences. De
partments in the School of Human
ities and Sciences conduct most of
the research at Jasper Ridge, as
well as teach approximately 80 per
cent of undergraduate classes.
"I think this is a really exciting
forum that Jasper Ridge is putting
on for its own 25th Anniversary,
and in conjunction with [Humani
ties and Sciences'] 50th," said Mary
Ancell, the school's special events
coordinator.

Jasper Ridge will celebrate its quarter-century with a speakers' forum and other events on Saturday.
ogy Prof. Stephen Schneider and Bi
ology Prof. Peter Vitousek.
Each of the panelists is a lauded
expert who represents the forefront
of an aspect of global change.
Each will bring a topic related to
their respective specialty. The top
ics, ranging from Naylor's "The Fu
ture of Agricultural Production: Im
pacts of Climate Change" to Vi
tousek's "Human Appropriation of
Primary Productivity," promise to
bring varied expert perspectives to
the discussion.
The faculty members scheduled
to appear represent a group of some
of the best authorities on global
change anywhere.
"Of the leaders in global change,
a vast majority of them are Stanford
people," said Cindy Wilbur, pro
gram coordinator at Jasper Ridge.
The co-panelists are enthusiastic
to appear with one another.
"It's a great group of social scien
tists and natural scientists working
together," said Naylor, who will ap
pear on the panel. "We've got a re
ally nice breadth of expertise."
The forum plans to be more than
the average lecture.
"One of the things that's going to
be really exciting about the forum is
that there's going to be an opportu
nity for the audience to ask ques
tions of the panelists," said Jasper
Ridge Director Philippe Cohen.

To complement the formidable
list of Stanford faculty members
scheduled to speak at the forum, an
other world-renowned biologist will
appear — Harvard Prof, and
Pulitzer Prize-winning author E.O.
Wilson.
Wilson has authored several
books, including "Sociobiology"
and his autobiography, "The Natu
ralist." He is credited with coining
the term "biodiversity."
Wilson's appearance is a recent
addition to the program.
"He's quite remarkable. I just
found out that he was coming on
Tuesday," Cohen said. "I heard that
he was in the area, and so I FedExed
him some info on Jasper Ridge with
a cover letter from Don Kennedy."
Following the dialogue, there will
be a reception and dinner at the Fac
ulty Club. The dinner will feature
round-table discussions with Jasper
Ridge researchers and a special
screening of a new film titled
"Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve:
An Island of Discovery."
Cohen expressed his enthusiasm
for the film.
"I just came back from an editing
viewing, and I'm stoked," he said.
"It's a great piece of work."
The film's producer-director,
Tamsin Orion, who works for Multi
media Video Productions, had
equally complimentary things to say
about Jasper Ridge.
"It's amazing how this tiny piece
of land can affect the whole world.
It's like a microcosm of the global

environment," she said.
Orion also stressed the impor
tance of the preserve's docent sys
tem, where students must take an in
tensive two-quarter class before
they can enter Jasper Ridge unguid
ed, under docent status.
"Because of [the docent pro
gram] the research can continue
there, and it can touch many more
people in the world," Orion said.
"It's really been a thrill [to be work
ing at Jasper Ridge] because the
people working there are so devot
ed. There is an incredible sense of
community."
For those not attending the
event, the movie and the forum will
be replayed on channel 51 on Oct. 8
at 8:30 p.m.
Tickets for the panel, the dinner
and the film premiere are available
at the Stanford University Ticket
Office in Tresidder Union. They are
priced at $250 per person for main
dining room seating or $150 per per
son for patio seating.
Tickets to the forum alone can be
purchased for $15. Student tickets to
the forum, which were still available
at press time, can also be obtained at
the ticket office at no charge with
presentation of an SUID.
Jasper Ridge became a biological
preserve in 1973 and boasts more
than 1,100 acres. Since its designa
tion, over 200 theses have been
based on research done in the area,
and 25 Stanford classes currently
rely on the preserve for course ma
terial.
