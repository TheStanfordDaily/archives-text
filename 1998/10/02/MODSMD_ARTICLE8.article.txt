# Fewer a cappella singers audition
## 
### Jamecca Marshall 
The soft, soothing sound of har
monic singing drifts into your bed
room window. The lovely chords
glide past your ears and into your
subconscious. You awake to melodi
ous voices crooning rhythmic tunes.
You put the pillow over your
head.
The continuity of an a capella
group depends on engaging incom
ing freshmen. This year, however,
groups have noticed a significant
drop in freshman auditions.
The decrease in numbers of audi
tions vary from group to group. Talis
man, for example, had 25 to 30 fewer

auditions than last year.
But although the number of stu
dents trying out was down, there was
an overall consensus among a cappel
la members that the quality of singing
was significantly better.
"The group of incoming freshmen
were uniformly more talented," said
junior Sasha Polonsky, last year's di
rector of Counterpoint. "All the
groups were enormously happy with
the results."
Senior John Davi, last year's busi
ness director of Fleet Street, agrees
the quality is better. By scaring off
those with only a mild interest in join
ing the groups, "we are attracting
only the people who want to sing at

school, who will audition no matter
what."
The usual attitude toward a cap
pella is excitement at the beginning of
the year that declines progressively as
the year continues, said senior Akhi
Sista, Talisman's director last year.
But groups were concerned at an
initial lack of interest this year. This is
despite, or perhaps a result of, an in
crease in a cappella exposure during
Orientation.
Freshman were blasted with a
cappella their first week on campus,
said Davi. "It's no surprise people
were turned off."
Besides the a cappella concert
during Orientation, groups held per

formances for dormitories, specifics
groups, individual concerts and
"stairwell" performances where
groups sang anywhere on campus at
anytime.
"You get sick," Davi said.
Yet some groups maintain that
type of visibility is a key ingredient to
their success.
Talisman "is very committed to
diversity," said senior Prince Davis, a
former member. "And we want to be
at functions that have diversity."
He believed the problem to be a
larger one. With little central school
support for music and the arts, it's
harder to get incoming freshman in
terested, he said.
