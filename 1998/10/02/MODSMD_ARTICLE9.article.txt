# Animal lovers unite to promote animal action
## 
### Jennifer Stewart 
During this upcoming school
year, several Stanford students an
ticipate spending time in local ani
mal shelters as well as in the class
room.
The Stanford Student Animal
Group is back in action after a one
year hiatus, and now senior Jennifer
Wang, president and founder of the
club, plans to continue from where
the club left off two years ago.
Prior to disbanding, the group
managed to raise $350 for local ani
mal shelters, including the Redwood
City shelter Pets in Need.
This year, Wang has plans for an
other fund-raiser and has raised her
goals. She explains that she is, "very
hopeful that they can raise more,
probably between $S(X) and $6(X)."
The money would then be donated
to local animal shelters.
In addition to money, the group
also has plans to collect animal food

and toys from dorms to donate to
shelters.
Volunteering is also a main com
ponent of the group. Wang said that
the group currently works with the
Pets in Need shelter.
Group members will undergo
orientation next week and then
begin volunteering weekly. Pets in
Need shelter is unique because it has
a no-euthanasia policy, and rescues
animals scheduled to be euthanised
at other shelters.
Wang's goal in founding the
group was to "give people interested
in animal welfare a chance to ex
press that interest." She also hopes
to increase awareness of animal
overpopulation.
The club's name was carefully
chosen to reflect the diversity of in
terests within the club.
Wang believes "that the term 'an
imal action' has wider appeal than
'animal rights.' "
Wang said that her group is

unique. "There are no other groups
on campus uniquely dedicated to an
imals," stated Wang.
Karin Willison, the group's direc
tor of public relations, added that
the group allows her to continue
working with animals.
She said that her motivating fac
tor for joining the club was that she
wanted to "help animals in the com
munity."
Currently, the group has approx
imately 20 to 25 members.
Wang said that sign-ups at the ac
tivities fair "were substantial." She
said that many of the students at the
activities fair came because they left
animals behind when they came to
college.
"This club is a way for them con
tinue having contact with animals,"
Wang said.
