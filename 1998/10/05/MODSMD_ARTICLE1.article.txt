# Loan interest rates lowered
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Thanks to new federal legislation, Stanford stu
dents will have a little more spending money.
On Sept. 29, the Senate approved the Higher Edu
cation Amendments of 1998. As part of the amend
ments, the interest rate on Direct Consolidation Loans
for students was lowered from 8.25 percent to 7.46 per
cent. Other 1998 amendments include grants to im
prove distance education and promote teacher train
ing and recruitment.
The change in interest rates influences Stanford un
dergraduate and graduate students alike.
"Probably between 50 to 60 percent of the under
graduate population is affected," said Cynthia Rife, di
rector of student awards in the Financial Aid Office.
Almost all graduate students are also affected by the
interest rate changes, Rife added.
"There was initially a scare that the as the rates de
creased lenders would get out of the market, but the
law has a subsidy for lenders," Rife said. "Students re
ally were the winners."
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robert Kin
nally agreed that the new interest rate benefits stu
dents. Kinnally called the interest rate change "en
couraging" and "a good step."
"Half a percent is better than none," he added.
"Loans are a reality, wherever you go. We want
them at reasonable levels so when students leave they
are not overly concerned about loan payments," Kin-
nally said.
Rife does not think the interest
rate changes are large enough to
significantly increase the number
of future applicants.
Despite the interest rate
changes contained in the reautho
rization, Rife characterized the
1998 version of the Higher Educa
tion Acts as the "reauthorization
with the least change in 30 years."
Rife said that the small level of
change stems from "pressure on
the Education Department to bet
ter deliver the funds that are avail
able." She said that the changes re
flect attempts to "stabilize the
whole area of education funding."
The stability in the Higher Edu
cation Act is important for stu
dents, according to Rife. "Usually
every four to five years there are
large changes in law and it is hard

for parents, students, and even fi
nancial aid officers to adjust," she
said.
The lowered interest rates have
an impact beyond the Stanford
campus. Rife said the lowered rates

'We are always interested
in increased loan limits, es
pecially for graduate stu
dents'
â€” Cynthia Rife

are "significant for other choices:
career, houses, and number of chil
dren."
Stanford officials were disap
pointed that loan limits were not
raised in the newly reauthorized
act. "We are always interested in
increased loan limits, especially for
graduate students," said Rife. Cur
rently, loan limits force many stu
dents to take out loans through two

different programs, which Rife be
lieves can be confusing and a finan
cial hardship.
Under current federal law,
freshmen are not permitted to bor
row more than $2,625 in Stafford
Loans. The limit for sophomores is
$3,500, and $5,500 for juniors and
seniors. The limit for a dependent
graduate student is $8,500 annual
ly, and $18,500 for an independent
graduate student.
"Since the standard package is
$6,500, students usually receive
$4,(MX) in loans and $2,500 in jobs.
Since Stafford loans have limits,
students have to borrow through
two programs," Rife said.
Students usually supplement
Stafford loans with Perkins loans.
Perkins loans have a maximum of
$3,(MX) per year and are restricted
to the neediest students. "It is a
high priority to see Perkins stu
dents borrow just through the
Perkins program," Rife added.
Rife would like the laws to be

liberalized "to allow students to
borrow more per year, while keep
ing the overall amount borrowed
the same." While these changes
were not incorporated in the 1998
reauthorization, she sees that such
a goal is "something to continue to
push for."
"We want to keep everything as
low as possible for students," Kin
nally agreed.
Kinnally does not foresee any
policy changes at Stanford as a re
sult of the reauthorization.
Kinnally said students interest
ed in the Higher Education Act
and other education issues should
contact the Financial Aid Office,
access Web sites, and write their
representatives.
Students currently receiving
loans at the old interest rate of 8.25
percent must apply to received the
new rate. To refinance, call the Di
rect Loan Program at (800) 557-
7392. The rate will remain at 7.46
percent pending future legislation.
