# Poli Sci to go to Encina
## Relocation not until 2001, however 
### Kenny Shei 
The Political Science Depart
ment is preparing to move to Encina
Hall from its current location in
Building 160 by the summer of2ool.
The English Department, which is
currently housed in the building, will
eventually take up permanent resi
dence in Margaret Jacks Hall.
The main reason for the move is
that Building 160 has yet to be rein
forced for earthquakes.
Unreinforced masonry buildings
in Santa Clara County are required
to be retrofitted to improve their
structural soundness in future earth
quakes. The deadline is the year
2000.
"After the year 2(MX), [Building
160] will be condemned unless it is
retrofitted," explained Ora Hind,
administrative services manager for
the Political Science Department.
Condemnation of a building does

not mean that it will be torn down.
Renovations for Encina are un
derway, after having been approved
by the Board of Trustees this sum
mer.
While the retrofitting happens in
Building 160, the department will be
moved to Encina. The move will
most likely occur in the 2(MX) 2001
school year, probably during the
summer of 2001.
However, specific details have
not been worked out.
"We're not even on the calendar
yet," said Hurd.
It has yet to be determined
whether the move will be temporary
or permanent. The move will be
conducted quickly, with the entire
department transferred simultane
ously. Hurd indicated.
The Political Science department
will not be alone in Encina I fall. Ac
cording to Assoc. Provost Ann
Fletcher, the Institute for Interna
tional Studies will be expanding
within Encina Hall.
Related departments, such as the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control and the Asia Pa
cific Research Center will also move
to Encina.
The smaller departments will be
moved in to Encina before the Polit

ical Science Department, said Hurd.
Some were not entirely enthusi
astic about the move.
"I loved the old-fashioned wood
en desks in I6()-16()J, the first-floor
lecture hall," said Matt Lehar, a se
nior. "When they remodel the build
ing, they should be installing more
classic features, like ink wells for
dip-pens."
But others are glad that Building
160 is being retrofitted. "[Being an
IR major], I have taken a fair num
ber of classes in the Poli Sci building,
but have few memorable reactions

besides that it desperately needed
an overhaul, especially in compari
son to the finery of its neighbors,"
pointed out Nathan Nielsen, Class of
•97.
Tom Soule, a junior, looked at
the big picture.
"Personally, 1 don't see what the
big deal about the move is," said
Soule.
"Though I found the old Poli Sci
building tight and cramped, it really
doesn't matter what buildings the
classes are in. as long as they are well
taught."
