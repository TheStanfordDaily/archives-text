# Hurricane damage costly

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) At a shelter in
Puerto Rico last week. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke
of a $39-million dollar U.S. grant to rebuild hurricane
ravaged homes.
But two weeks after Hurricane Georges pummeled
this U.S. territory, thousands still languish in schools,
community centers and the homes of family and friends
— and her pledge looks like a drop in the bucket.
The cost of getting the homeless into homes will be
far greater than virtually anyone had imagined, proba
bly well beyond $1 billion. And U.S. taxpayers are sure
to foot most of the bill.
Officials originally estimated overall property dam
age to the island — including roads public buildings.

parks and beaches —at $2 billion, a figure now
believed to be underestimated.
Those left homeless can receive up to $25,(XK) from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well
as $ 13.5(H) to buy new appliances and furniture.
Puerto Rico authorities now say the FEMA pro
gram. which would allow residents to rebuild their
wood and zinc homes, may be ill-advised because it will
leave new homes as vulnerable to hurricanes as the old
ones.
Gov. Pedro Rosello instead wants federal block
grants that, combined with money from Puerto Rico's
local budget, would subsidize more expensive cement
homes located out of harm's way.
