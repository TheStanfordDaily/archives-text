# Impeachment lacks support

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” On the eve of House Judi
ciary hearings into possible impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton, chairman Henry Hyde said
Sunday the Senate so far does not have the two-thirds
majority necessary to remove the president from office.
Hyde also said he hopes to finish his impeachment
inquiry by year's end but won't accept Democratic
demands for limits on the investigation.
"You know how New Year's resolutions sometimes
get broken, but it's my hope and prayer that we could
finish by New Year's," the Illinois Republican said.
Hyde's committee meets Monday to take up a GOP
resolution recommending an open-ended inquiry into
whether Clinton's behavior merits impeachment. The
Democrats will offer a separate version that would put
a deadline on the inquiry and limit it to the Monica
Lewinsky affair, but it is likely to be defeated.
On Sunday Hyde again rejected the Democratic
demands. He even said he might if necessary be willing
to expand the inquiry beyond Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on the president's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky when she was a White
House intern and later.
The Judiciary Committee anticipates no more mate
rial from Starr, Hyde said, and "we are not seeking that.
We're not out trolling for additional issues. But if they

come to our attention we will deal with them."
Hyde, who appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press"
and "Fox News Sunday," added: "We don't feel bound
by Ken Starr."
Hyde mentioned as possible extensions Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate and Clinton's relationship with for
mer White House volunteer Kathleen Willey and said
his committee will look at a report being put out this
week by a different House committee on alleged White
House campaign fund-raising violations. "We don't
want to shut our eyes or use tunnel vision," he said.
At the same time, Hyde admitted that if the House
votes to impeach, or indict, the president, the 67 votes
required in the Senate to remove him from office are
not there. "They won't do that until the American peo
ple move, and they have to move from where they
apparently are if the polls are true," Hyde said.
Hyde said it is possible that after the House ends its
investigation the Senate could move to end the matter
by censuring the president. "Everything is possible," he
said. "I wouldn't rule anything out."
He said Starr would have to be involved in any cen
sure negotiations to deal with the issue of whether Clin
ton could still be indicted for charges in the Starr report,
such as peijury and obstruction of justice, after he leaves
office.
