PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) â€”
Serbian authorities, in their latest
effort to head off NATO missiles
and bombs, installed an interim
government in Kosovo on Saturday
aimed at "normalizing conditions"
in the rebellious province.
Zoran Andjelkovic, the man
appointed by the Serbian Parlia
ment to head the 18-member Inter
im Executive Council, told the new
members at their first session in the
Kosovo Parliament building, "We
have to defeat the terrorists and
work for the benefit of all our citi
zens."
Terrorist is a term the Serbs
often have used to describe rebels

of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has been fighting for inde
pendence in the majority ethnic
Albanian province in Serbia. Serbia
is the dominant of two remaining
Yugoslav republics.
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav air
defense has been placed on the
highest state of alert to counter pos
sible NATO airstrikes, said a
Yugoslav army commander who
spoke Saturday on condition of
anonymity.
Constituting the new council was
part of a last-ditch effort to show
that Serbs intend to end the conflict
and came just two days before a
report by U.N. chief Kofi Annan on

whether Belgrade is complying with
demands to halt its assault on ethnic
Albanians. If not, Washington has
indicated NATO airstrikes will hap
pen within two weeks.
Edita Tahiri, a top ethnic Alba
nian political leader, condemned
the establishment of the council as
"strengthening Serbian rule in
Kosovo."
"The act... is a serious impedi
ment for any success in a negotiat
ing process," she said.
Andjelkovic appointed seven
Serbs, five Albanians and the rest
Turks and Muslims. He said he con
sulted no political parties in the pro
cess.
