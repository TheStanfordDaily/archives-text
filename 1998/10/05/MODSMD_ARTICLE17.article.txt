The improved course guide
needs greater student input
and administrative attention

IT'S BECOMING CLEAR that there
are plenty of difficult stages on the way
to making the ASSU Course Guide as
valuable an asset as it should be. However,
the ASSU has successfully passed several of
those stages, and this year's Web-based
guide is a real improvement on last year's
printed version.
We commend Matt Pearl and Sacha
Zadmehran for the job they've done of
incorporating valuable information about a
very substantial number of classes into a
simple and usable format.
That said, the guide is not yet as useful as
it could be. Class selection would be an eas
ier and more informed process, particularly
for freshmen, if there was an impartial
guide with plenty of statistics and honest
descriptions of courses. Conceivably, the
course guide could include Time Schedule
information and provide one-stop shopping
at the beginning of the quarter.
The guide, however, is not going to get
to this point, or indeed advance much at all,
if it continues to be put out by a tiny staff
coordinating the responses of 20 percent of
the student body.
Readers of the course guide can tell that
it's not yet entirely ready for prime time. It
lists last year's courses without updates
from the Bulletin or lime Schedule on
whether they are still taught and, taught by
the same instructor. To be successful, the

guide needs to rely on interaction between
its staff and the various departments so that
it can include up-to-date information on
what courses are out there and who's teach
ing them.
All of this requires a far larger staff than
is now available. The current ASSU admin
istration could score a lot of points by mak
ing the course guide into an institutional
ized and well staffed operation.
An important part of this would be find
ing a source of funding other than, as now.
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences. An
independently funded guide, perhaps
through advertising, could hire a larger staff
and benefit from added editorial freedom.
In addition, schools other than Humani
ties and Sciences should have their quanti
tative information and student comments
included in the guide. The schools owe it to
their students to provide honest informa
tion, and the staff of the guide owes it to the
faculty to run the kind of professional,
responsible operation to whom faculty can
feel comfortable turning over information.
Finally, a good part of the responsibility
for expanding the guide's usefulness lies
with students. The rates at which we fill (tut
those little tear-off slips at the bottom of an
evaluation are far too low. It doesn't take a
long time to fill out an evaluation form, and
students should be all the more willing to
take the time if it's going toward a resource
they find useful.
Although we're a lot closer than we were
last year, we don't have the kind of guide
we want yet. With consistent administrative
effort and a higher degree of engagement
from students and faculty, we might get 0111;
at last.
