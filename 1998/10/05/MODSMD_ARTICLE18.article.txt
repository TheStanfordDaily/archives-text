# What would Rach (or you) do?

I DIDN'T KNOW Wal-
Mart existed in Cali
fornia, much less that
it would be attractive to
Bay Area shoppers. Nor
could I imagine my
clothes-sewing, hitch-hik
ing-folk-singing friend
buying shot pellets or peanut brittle there.
But I learned about the Wal-Mart in Moun
tain View when my friend Julie told me, "So
I was in the jewelry department at Wal-
Mart last weekend. They had these
bracelets with the letters W.W.J.D. printed
on them — 'What Would Jesus Do?' Can
you imagine those poor kids reaching out to
steal a candy bar and then," she switched to
a Darth Vader voice to spell out the letters,
"W.W.J.D. sends them on a guilt trip to
good behavior."
In my current circles, the religion of The
Man gets derided. Judaism is met with
interest: "How do you celebrate Rosh
Hashanah?" Eastern religions earn admira
tion: "Cool, isn't Cat Stevens a Buddhist or
something too?" Leftists and liberals do
what they can to make middle-America's
faith look like it treats fever by bleeding
with leeches. Clone are the days when the
Benilde Saint Margaret girls' volleyball
team used the cheer, "We've got God!
We've got God!" to muster up a victory.
The National Organization of Women pick
eted the Promise Keepers' convention, Cre
ationism is out of high school biology, and a

guy dressed up as the Stanford Cardinal
makes fun of the Vatican's views on contra
ception.
I tug at my sleeve, pulling my sweater
over my wrist covering the letters W.W.J.D.
Still, 1 could probably use a little more guilt.
Since coming to college, I'm older, wiser,
less of a starry-eyed-rock-star-wannabe.
And yes, I'm meaner.
Perhaps it comes from living in a co-op.
I'm prepared to install a video camera to
catch the person who fries eggs and aban
dons the gunky pan in the sink. 1 make
paper-writers wait while I check my e-mail.
I rate people's attractiveness for a psychol
ogy experiment, doling out twos and threes.
I make jokes about the RollerbladingTA in
the Lair.
My body language is impatient when I'm
making small talk. I saw a lady running to
catch the Marguerite and I didn't tell the
driver to wait. I went snowboarding at
Squaw last spring and got in for the child
rate. Did you know that it's only five bucks
for an under-12 lift ticket? I lie to Christina
about what I'm writing this column for. I go
before it's my turn at four-way stop signs
and try to run over those nasty black squir
rels on my bike.
Jesus, alternately, would grab that squir
rel and give it mouth-to-mouth, rabies or no
rabies. He would grab some steel wool and
scrub that burnt egg yolk out of the frypan.
He would pay full price for an adult lift tick
et — if he snowboards, that is. And here I

find myself identifying more with the
humor in, no, not Dilbert, but that bumper
sticker that reads, "My other car is a
broom."
Just as I am nostalgic for casseroles and
cornfields, I miss the Generic Jesus. Per
haps you've never identified him by this
name, but you know who I'm talking about.
He's the tanned and bearded face on the
glowing yellow background that rests upon
old ladies' bedside stands and sometimes on
small-town hardware store calendars. 1 see
his face and I'm ready to drop my burdens,
pick up my cross and start following. I want
to scrape off the gunk of stressed-out self
interest and return to a gut instinct of good
ness.
Maybe I'll never become a living, being,
random act of kindness who drops change
into parking meters. But I could be putting
a little more effort into loving my neighbors
as myself. Next time I'm eating candy out of
the bulk bins at the grocery store, I hope
that Generic Jesus, white robe and glowing
yellow light, taps me on the shoulder and
asks, "What would I do?" Besides, maybe
he'd even offer to buy me a peppermint
lozenge or butterscotch disc. Or maybe he'd
take me out for drinks or dinner. He must
be making tons of money off those
bracelets.
