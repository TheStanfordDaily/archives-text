Recycling program works
Stanford University is doing an excep
tional job in the area of recycling. There are
over 21(X) recycling bins in the academic
areas of the university and over 780 recy
cling bins in the student housing areas.
Newspaper, mixed paper, corrugated
cardboard and beverage containers (includ
ing glass, aluminum and plastics #1 and #2)
are collected all over the campus. Special
event recycling is available by submitting a
work order. In addition, scrap metal includ
ing large appliances, yard waste from the
grounds department and staff / faculty area,
wood waste and concrete are recycled. Fin
ished compost and wood chips from ground
logs are used on the campus, completing the
loop.
California led the nation with recycling
mandates in 1989 with the passage of AB
939, written by Senator Bryon Sher, a for
mer Stanford professor. It states that all
cities and counties must divert 25 percent of
their waste by 1995 and 50 percent by the
year 2(XX). The University is diverting
approximately 40 percent of its waste from
the landfill. We can only divert what gets
put in the recycling bins and what is sepa
rated from the garbage. We need every
one's help in creating strong markets for the
recyclable materials by buying items that
have high post-consumer content.

Finally, West Coast university solid
waste and recycling professionals will be
gathering here at Stanford in February 1999
for a National Recycling Coalition / College
and University Recycling Council work
shop. Stanford University Facilities Opera
tions, Peninsula Sanitary Service, and Cali
fornia Collegiate Recycling Council are
sponsoring the workshop.
The Stanford Community should be
proud of its successful program. Of course,
there is no time to rest on our laurels. There
is more material to be collected, processed,
and shipped!

Local bands abound
To answer your question. Matt Blunien
stein, I, in fact, don't like to freak. I hate frat
parties, don't care for a cappella and hardly
frequent the Co Ho on live music nights.
But that doesn't mean "the music scene at
Stanford is abysmal and embarrassing."
True, there aren't a ton of Stanford bands,
but there are a lot of Stanford kids in bands.
The reason you don't know about them
(even though some of them have records on
large labels and are big enough to tour), is
because they're not Top 40, and because
none of the band members are Sigma Chis.

Stanford does play music in White Plaza.
KZSU brings music to White Plaza every
Wednesday at noon. Last year we present
ed a variety of bands and live DJs. Also,
most people don't know that every
Wednesday night, at 9 p.m., KZSU puts on
"Wednesday Night Live," featuring local
acts.
In the past. KZSU has tried to bring
more popular bands to campus, but if you
don't go through the Concert Network it's
nearly impossible to find an adequate space
that's not exorbitantly expensive. So we've
had to rely on places like Lambda Nu. EBF,
and Chi Theta Chi to put on shows.
So tune into KZSU, 90.1 FM. We play
everything from electronica to grindcore to
hip-hop and rock. Oh yeah â€” if you don't
like frat parties, stay tuned for KZSU par
ties in the future. We threw one last spring
and it was great. Even the frat boys ven
tured out, and there was hardly any freak
ing.

Holocaust ad out of place
On Thursday. Oct. 1, you chose to run an
advertisement by a Holocaust denial group.
It took up one-sixth of a page, right next to
ads for a photo shop and online textbooks.

The ad itself was a blatant effort to commu
nicate the message of the Holocaust deniers
with the usual mix of scare quotes, bizarre
terminology, and suggestions of conspiracy,
but you printed it without comment as
though it were nothing more than an ad for
bicycle parts.
The issue here is not Holocaust denial.
'Hie idea that the Holocaust is a fabrication
is so absurd in light of the historical data and
the tens of thousands of witnesses that only
the truly gullible or the truly hateful could
entertain it. Nor is the issue the content of
the "ad" itself. The ad offers $250,000 to any
person who can arrange a meeting between
its writers and the Anti-Defamation League
on "national network television."
Beyond the humor involved in the notion
that anyone could convince the ADL to
"debate" the Holocaust with these sick peo
ple, the idea that the ADL is the proper
focus for such a "debate" is itself rather
bizarre. The ADL was founded at the turn
of the century to monitor bigotry and com
bat anti-Semitism; its closest equivalent in
American public life is the NAACP.
In that sense, this ad is equivalent to the
Ku Klux Klan or the White Aryan Nation
demanding that the NAACP meet with ilto
"debate" the "issue" of whether slavery
ever happened.
No, the real issue is the fact that the
Stanford Daily chose to run this ad. I am

not suggesting that the Daily should have
simply ignored it, though of course it is your
right and your job to select the advertise
ments you run, and I suspect that there are
many ads you would refuse to run (such as
a malicious ad aimed directly at an individ
ual Stanford student, or for that matter an
ad from the White Aryan Nation).' Rather,
if you insist on turning your newspaper into
a platform for such outrageous trash, you
should at least have the moral sense to treat
it as an issue.
When I was an undergraduate at Rut
gers several years ago, the Rutgers Targum
was faced with a similar issue. Rather than
simply running the ad, the editors took no
money for it, printed it on the editorial
page, and ran editorials alongside it about
the ideological sources of Holocaust denial
and about the responsibilities and dilemmas
of the press. It was a brave thing to do, and
most importantly, it fulfilled a central goal
of the press: to be a source of education and
insight for its readers.
In short, you could have used this ad as
an opportunity to challenge and educate
your readers. Instead, you scored 50 bucks.
I am disgusted and appalled by your choice,
and I hope that you will make an effort to
be more responsible in the future.
