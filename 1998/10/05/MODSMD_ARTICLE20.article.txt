THIS JUST IN: The Humanities are
Dead. They were en route from
LAX to heaven when their flight,
due to some technological boo-boo, plum
meted to the Earth outside of Seattle, near
ly missing Bill Gates's mansion. Everyone
on board died. It was very tragic.
Of course. I'm making all that up. Well,
not all ol it. Unfortunately, the Humanities
have died, but not in any freak airplane acci
dent. They seemed to have died of a self
inflicted gunshot wound after reading a
report issued by the scientific community on
the irrelevance, inappropriateness, and just
plain silliness of their entire course of study.
Looking at the report itself will help us to
understand why the Humanities opted to
kick the proverbial can(on). Fortunately. I
have a copy — the only copy — right here
in my back pocket. Let's look at the high
lights:
"We, the Scientific Community, feel that
the Humanities' petty search for meaning
and truth has gone on far too long and has
produced no definitive results that could be
published in such periodicals as Scientific
American or Physics: Yeah! Therefore, we

request that all funding be immediately
stripped from the Humanities and given to
us so we can build faster modems.
"We've broken down our findings by
academic department, outlining why young,
impressionable college students need to
know next to nothing about subjects taught
outside a 'Core.'
"First, religious studies. It seems that a
lot of the inquiries done in this field involve
religions in which people believe in the exis
tence of une god. How can they prove the
existence of god when the sample size is so
small? Really, one god! How can you get
statistical significance? Puh-leeze. We
weren't born yesterday, people.
"However, we were informed that some
religions are polytheistic, so we said, 'Well,
why not invite all the gods down to the lab
so we could run some DNA tests on them
and see if they really exist?' And they said.
'Gods are forces that cannot be felt physi
cally but sensed spiritually." So we said.
'Well, isn't that a load? Why don't we just
base major world religions on white rats? At
least they show up to the lab!' At that point,
the religious studies professors, unable to

validate their claims, left the room scream
ing that they had seen the Devil. Conclu
sion: no funding.
"Next, philosophy. A big question in this
department is how one determines value
and makes judgments. Hence, the question:
Is the glass half-full or is it half-empty? This
seemed to us to be a foolish line of inquiry
because no one has yet determined whether
50 percent of the volume is filled with
liquid. Did they use a graduated cylinder?
Did they use a balance, assuming that they
know the liquid's identity and molecular
weight? What about the glass — is it Pyrex?
They seemed to be too busy meditating to
answer our very sensible questions, so we
concluded: no funding.
" Third, sociology. We tried very hard to
investigate this department, but none of our
scientists, when told of their assignment,
could stop laughing. Same thing with the
Communication Department. Sorry about
that: no funding.
"Last, literature. We were very interest
ed in this subject, hoping that Shakespeare,
with his linguistic profundity, could provide
us with a substitute language for Java. But

all he seemed to be concerned with were
crazy men such as Hamlet, who, by the way,
would make a great video game hero, like
Super Mario. The English professors repri
manded us for our flippancy, and explained
that Hamlet's madness depicts the pain and
confusion inherent in the human condition.
Of course, we all know that Hamlet proba
bly suffered from a serotonin deficiency in
his forebrain bundle, but we didn't want to
burst their bubble. Oh yeah, no funding."
What could the Humanities be expected
to do? Could any discipline survive when its
supposed colleagues are indeed its ene
mies?
It must be noted that the Humanities
waited before pulling the trigger. They real
ized. quite correctly, that one report
shouldn't herald their doom, but when they
looked around at what is popularly called
the state of sffairs, they knew their time had
passed. Their last words:
"How can we live in a world where stu
dents care more about Web sites than
archaeological sites, the engineering
sciences are housed in million-dollar accom
modations while the English department

squeezes itself into whatever unpainted
hole is available, where we are placated by a
speaker series instead of research grants,
and where freshmen scream that CIV is
killing them but they can't get enough of CS
106 A?"
But wait! A news flash has just come into
our offices.
It seems a young unidentified couple has
been spotted relaxing by the shores of Lake
Lagunita, embracing each other under the
fading sunlight, as the stars settle into place.
They are whispering poetry into each oth
ers' ears, and they are smiling. They seem to
be sensible yet sensitive and faithful people
who care about a lot about Donne's sonnets
and Plato's "Republic." They are laughing
now; they must have not heard about the
Humanities' untimely demise.
And now, as we get a closer look, the
couple has turned and is facing us, and
somehow, in some magical way, the couple
seems to be, believe it or not, you and me.
