from both sides of the bay and the
fans were rewarded with strong,
closely-matched performances by
both teams.
"Goals were hard to get today,"
said Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "It was definitely a de
fensive battle. Neither team had a
lot of opportunities to score."
Stanford (8-1,2-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) scored the
first goal of the game with a back
hand shot from senior hole-set
David Hay in the fourth minute of
play. Cal (5-2, 1-1) answered back
with 0:48 left on the clock to end the
quarter in a 1-1 tie.
In the second quarter, redshirt
freshman Pasi Dutton scored from
the post in a Stanford 6-on-5 oppor
tunity. Once again, Cal evened
things out with a four-meter penal
ty shot at 2:14.
Stanford goalie Chris Aguilera
led the Cardinal defense by tallying
six saves in the first half and five in
the second. Aguilera also got some
help from numerous field blocks
made by his defense.
"Everybody played good de-
fense," said Aguilera. "We worked
on guarding [Cal's] left-handers and
we really took that away from
them."
During the third period, the Stan
ford offense kicked into high gear
and set the pace. In the third minute
of the quarter, Dutton scored again
during the Cardinal man-up offense.
In the next minute and a half, Stan
ford scored two more goals to go
ahead 5-2.
Senior Arturo Rodelo scored on
a break-away assisted by junior
Andy Walburger and Hay scored
after battling it out in the hole with a
defender and Cal goalie Peter Kief
fer.
Cal's only goal of the quarter
came on another penalty shot at
2:51. Less than a minute later, Stan
ford senior Jeremiah Robison
scored what proved to be the game
winning goal.
"The third quarter was the key to
the game," Dettamanti said. "That's
pretty typical of how we've played
this year. We usually have one quar
ter when we really break it open."

Cal fought back during the last
period, outscoring the Cardinal 2-0.
But Cal's rally wasn't strong enough
to overcome Stanford's lead and the
Cardinal came away with the victo
ry-
"We played super defense," said
Aguilera. "But we shouldn't have
made it so exciting at the end."
One of the keys to the victory was
Stanford's defense against all five of
Cal's man-up opportunities.
"We played really solid defense,"
said Dutton. "We shut down their
six-on-five."
The Cardinal's defensive strategy
was to front Cal's hole-set and press
out, and then to slough into the hole
once the two-meter defense got be
hind Cal's center.
"Everybody played well, espe
cially on defense," said Dettamanti.
"Everyone did a good job of helping
in."
It was only during Cal's last-quar
ter rally that Stanford had trouble
making the transition on defense.
"We were really caught in be
tween defenses at the end and that's
why Cal got the chance to come
back," Dettamanti said. "Cal was
countering hard and we were just a
little bit of a step behind."
