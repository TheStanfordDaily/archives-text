### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Watching the unfurling of the 1997
women's volleyball NCAA Championship
banner on Friday night, two-time All-Ameri
can kerri Walsh recalled the fond memories
of last year's title run. her second in as many
years at Stanford.
Then she went out on the court and
showed the crowd that they have good reason
to hope for a third.
Despite the injury to her right shoulder,
the junior outside hitter put on a hitting clin
ic and led the Cardinal to a pair of convincing
three-game sweeps of Washington and
Washington State.
"Friday was as good as my shoulder has
felt in a long time," said Walsh. "So 1 was able
to take some full swings and hit with some
power."
Against the Cougars, Walsh racked up 10
kills and finished with a .692 hitting percent
age.
Stanford's 15-2, 15-9, 15-3 victory on Fri
day against Washington State gave head
coach Don Shaw his 20()th Pacific 10 Confer
ence win, and extended the Cardinal's home
conference winning streak to 40.
Shaw downplayed the significance of No.
200. saying he was more focused on the
progress of this year's team than on any per
sonal accomplishments.
The Cardinal (10-2,6-0 Pac-10) jumped on
to the road to 200 in a hurry, opening a 14-0
lead in game one.
Throughout the match, the Cardinal was
extremely solid up the middle, as sophomore
middle blocker Jennifer Detmer powered her
way to a 13-kill, eight-block performance.
Freshman middle blocker Sara Sandrick
added 11 kills and eight blocks, proving she is
another reliable Stanford weapon.
Overall, the Cardinal posted a .366 hitting
percentage, while holding Washington State
to a frustrating .076 percentage.
Already the leading blocking team in the
nation, Stanford continued its domination at
the net and outblocked WSU 18-5, led by
sophomore setter Robyn Lewis's nine rejec
tions.
Yesterday against the University of Wash
ington (3-6, 2-3). Stanford cruised to another
three-game sweep, 15-9, 15-5, 15-7.
"It is definitely nice to have a pair of quick
three-game matches," Shaw said. "We were

real hanged up in practice this week, with
seven of our 13 players on the trainer's list. So
we focused on watching video tapes and
learning what to expect from our opponents.
1 think we were well prepared and showed
good anticipation on the court."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, Walsh's
shoulder was sore prior to Sunday's match
and she knew she couldn't go all out against

the Huskies.
But the soreness didn't stop her from dom
inating the Washington defenders. Unable to
hit at 100 percent, she used a mixture of
power and placement to baffle Husky block
ers with 10 kills, no errors and a .500 hitting
percentage
"1 have been forced to find other ways to
get kills," Walsh said. "1 have worked on my
placement and have been reading the defens
es a lot better. I think that as a result, my
overall game is definitely better now."
Which is pretty scary for anyone not wear
ing a Stanford uniform.
Another frightening realization for the
Cardinal's opponents is that its offensive at
tack is becoming more balanced and effec
tive.
Along with Walsh's team-high 10 kills,
freshman outside hitter Michelle Chambers,
Sandrick and Detmer added seven kills
apiece.
"1 was happy with the way we spread out
our offense," Shaw said. "We moved the ball
around quite well and were able to mix power
with some off-speed balls to open spots."
On top of the strong showing from the
Cardinal's outside hitters and middle block
ers, setter Robyn Lewis continues to con
tribute more at the net.
"I have been able to dump the ball effec
tively." Lewis said. "That opens things up for
ot! 1 li hitters, and catches defenses by sur
prise.
"The weekend went really well. Each
week, we're getting better and better. Earlier
in the season, we were dragging matches out
to four games, but we seem to be on top of
things now and playing a lot better.


Sophomore Robyn Lewis puts up another perfect set in yesterday's three-game vic
tory agianst Washington. The setter tallied nine rejections in Friday's win against
Washington State.
