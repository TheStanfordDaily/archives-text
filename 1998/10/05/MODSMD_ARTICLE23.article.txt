# Football whipped by Fighting Irish

### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
For the second straight week, the
Stanford football team won the
pregame coin toss. For the second
straight week, it was the only thing
the Cardinal would win all day.
The final score of 35-17 in favor
of the Irish marks the second
straight week of futility for this Car
dinal squad, as they were out of con
tention halfway through the first
quarter.

FOOTBALL
â–  Saturday: No. 3 Notre Dame 35,
Stanford 17.

Stanford deferred the kickoff, al
lowing Notre Dame to quickly build
a lead it would not relinquish. With
its offensive line opening garbage
truck-sized holes, the Irish marched
65 yards on an eight-play drive,
capped by quarterback Jarious
Jackson's 22-yard run on an option
keeper out of a double-wing forma
tion.
After the ensuing kickoff, Stan
ford went three-and-out, and Notre
Dame wasted no time in adding to
its lead. On the first play of the pos
session, Jackson dropped back and
found split end Malcolm Johnson
for 21 yards over the middle.
Continuing their domination of
the trenches, the Irish manhandled
the Cardinal front four, springing
Jackson and tailback Autry Denson
for long gains. Denson finished the
drive with a two-yard blast over left
guard for the touchdown.
Stanford might have crawled
back into the game, but on third and
seven, as quarterback Todd Husak
rolled away from the Irish pass rush,
blitzing cornerback Deveron Harp

er blindsided the nation's 14th
ranked quarterback.
As Husak was bringing the ball
up to throw it away. Harper spiked
it away and Irish end Brad Williams
recovered at the Stanford lb-yard
line. With just 7:40 elapsed in the
game, fullback Jamie Spencer tore
off gains of 10 and six yards to put
the Irish up 21-0.
With the game looking dreadful
ly similar to the previous weekend's
debacle in Oregon, the Stanford of
fense showed some life on its third
drive, which went 57 yards and re
sulted in a Kevin Miller field goal.
The Cardinal finally hit Coy Wire
on two swing passes, a weapon that
had been devastating in the hands of
Anthony Bookman and Mike
Mitchell last year but had yet to sur
face so far in 1998.
Husak also found wideout David
Davis on a quick slant on third and
12. which the Cardinal converted as
Davis ran 28 yards to daylight for a
first down at the Notre Dame 15.
After Husak was forced to throw
the ball away on third and three.
Miller split the uprights to get Stan
ford on the board. Before the drive,
Stanford had run six times for a pa
thetic minus-three yards.
On its next possession. Stanford
couldn't advance past midfield, but
caught a break as Irish punt return
er Joey Getherall's fumble was re
covered by Williams at the I K. Stan
ford couldn't capitalize on the
chance to get back in the game as
they failed to convert on fourth and
five at the Notre Dame 13.
Wire took a Husak screen pass in
the right Hat. and managed to break
a tackle before being swarmed by
blue shirts for a two-yard gai.
"1 was really pleased with our sud
den ehange defense." Said Notre
Dame head coach Boh Davie.
"When we gave up the ball in our red
zone, they were able to come in and
make plays."
Late in the second quarter, Notre
Dame manufactured another touch
down drive, this one for 60 yards, the
lion's share of which came on a 37-
yard Spencer blast through the ('ardi
nal defensive line. Jackson scored his
second of three touchdowns on an
option keeper right, and the half
ended with Notre Dame leading 2K-3.
The Irish offense slowed down in
the second half, but not before
adding a backbreaking 99-yard
touchdown drive to seal the game.
After a 42-yard Miller punt was
downed at the one on a acrobatic ef
fort bycornerbaek Frank Primus, the
Irish ground out seven first downs,
one of them on a face mask penalty
against the Cardinal.
Stanford then managed to tack on
two touchdowns in garbage time, the
second of which came on a 72-yard
drive with redshirt freshman Randy
Fasani at the helm. Fasani took a
quarterback-keeper into the end
zone for one yard, and then found
Davis in the left corner of the end
zone for a two-point conversion.
"We got a little bit sloppy at the
end of the game." Davie said.
The return of Troy Walters
should be of some comfort to Cardi
nal fans, as the senior Hanker ap
peared in two plays as a decoy in the
second quarter. Walters should play
next week against C)regon State.
"1 didn't have any pain. I feel
good." Walters said.
The preseason First-ream All-
Ameriean will be counted on to rein
vigorate an offense that has found it
self forced to change its game plan
after first-quarter defensive break
downs. Walters' leadership can't
hurt, especially considering Stan
ford's lack of experience.
"Any time your leader comes back,
it helps a lot." 1 lusak said. "We know
we're a much better team with him."
