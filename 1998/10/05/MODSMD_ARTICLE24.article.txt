# Men dominate No. 9 Creighton
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
There's nothing like building mo
mentum going into a game against
the defending N( A A champions.
The Cardinal (7-2) captured the
Stanford / Nike Tournament title bv
upsetting No. 9 Creighton (<S-2) 2-0
yesterday with a stellar team perfor
mance. Stanford beat I INI V (6-4) 1-

-0 Friday night to set up the champi
onship game. In its next match, the
Cardinal laces defending champion
1 J( LA in Westwood.
I he much-anticipated Creighton-
Stanford battle lived up to its expecta
tions with Stanford treating its home
crowd to the entertaining victory.
The Cardinal's intensity showed
from the kickoff as it controlled the
first 15 minutes of the game. In the

first five minutes alone, Stanford
posed three scoring threats.
In the 14th minute, after several
missed opportunities, senior Jamie
Clark gave Stanford the lead. The
play began with a corner kick to the
far post. After the ball was headed
around the box, senior Adam Sieg
man headed the ball to Clark who
headed it into the back of the net. The
goal was Clark's third of the season,
and the assist Siegman's fourth.
Stanford capitalized on the goal by
keeping the momentum and playing
with confidence. Creighton was un
able to win battles in the midfield and
throughout the game and Stanford
used its speed and agility to win the
close balls. But with the Cardinal
scoring only one goal in the first half,
Creighton remained in the game.
"In the first half we played as good
as I 've seen. We really controlled the
game. But with only one goal we kept
them alive," Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark said.
The second half saw the Cardinal
extend its lead as sophomore Sean
Sylvis scored his first career goal on
the Farm. The goal was set up by
sophomore Corey Woolfolk. who
used his fancy footwork to center the
ball to senior captain A.J. Sauer.
Blue Jay goalie Tom Zawislan
made a nice save on Salter's shot, but
the ball rebounded back out to Sylvis
who converted the goal. Sauer and
Woolfolk received the assists.
"It was a great goal for young
Sylvis." Bobby Clark said, explaining
that Sylvis saw little time last year and
has capitalized on his opportunities.
An internal battle existed during
the game between the two midfield
lines, particularly that of Stanford se
niors Simon Elliott and Shan Gaw
against Creigton senior Richard Mul
rooney. Touted as one of the nation's
top midfielders. Mulrooney found his
match in Elliott and Gaw. The Blue
Jays' star was held to only two shots
and wasn't able to create opportuni

tics lor his teammates.
"Shan and Simon were immense,"
Bobby ("lark said. "They are ab
solutely one of the top midfield duos
in the country."
F.lliott and Gaw dominated the
midfield, creating shots for the entire
team. Dominating the entire game,
Stanford outshot the Blue Jays 17-9.
Elliott was named the tourna
ment's MVP for his play all weekend.
Stanford redshirt sophomore goalie
Adam Zapala was named the Most

■ Saturday: No. 14 Stanford 2. No. 9
Creighton 0.

Valuable Defensive Player, and
(Yeighton's Mulrooney the Most
Valuable Offensive Player.
The victory against the Blue Jays
was particularly sweet because two
years ago, in Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark's first game with the
Cardinal, Creighton came away with
a convincing 4-0 victory.
"They really schooled us (in
19%]," Clark said. "We've come a
long way."
Stanford was also victorious Fri
day night over the UNLV Running
Rebels. Though not as pretty as yes
terday's victory, the Cardinal looked
solid under the lights.
Elliott came through with Friday
night's heroics. As the team missed
finishing on many scoring chances,
the game remained scoreless until
only seven minutes remained.
Elliott's goal came from the top of
the box and found its way to the bot
tom right corner of the net. Sopho
more Matt Moses was credited with
the assist in only his second game of
the season.
After his goal, Elliott saluted the
crowd with the team's trademark
"TriDingo" pose, used later in the
weekend by Clark after his goal.
