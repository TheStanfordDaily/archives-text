FIELD HOCKEY
■ Saturday: Stanford 4, Davis &
Elkinso.

inviting atmosphere for t£ams
dressed in red, Stanford took all it
wanted from the blue and gold field
this weekend, recording its fourth
consecutive shutout, 4-0, at the ex
pense of St. Louis University.
Traveling across the Bay did not
just mean entering a rival's territo
ry, but also required the Cardinal
(7-2, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference
Northern Division) to adjust to a
different playing surface after being
at home for their last four games.
Unlike the wet ground at the
Varsity Hockey Astroturf Field.
Cal's surface is always left drv.
The transition did not seem un
bearably difficult, however, as the
Cardinal captured the lead first, a
lead they would never relinquish.
Stanford took a quick lead on a
penalty stroke by sweeper Lissv
Goralnik. It was Goralnik's second
goal of the season, but for the Car

dinal it was business as usual.
Before the half was over, how
ever, senior Carey Cloyd led an
other Cardinal attack, moving her
team farther ahead with her third
goal of the regular season and up
ping her season point total to nine.
Despite mounting a 2-0 lead by
half time, Johnson felt her team was
not playing as well as in past games.
"I thought the first half was a lit
tle slow tor us," she said. "We made
some adjustments during halftime..
. the second half was much better."
Implementing Johnson's adjust
ments, Stanford did not relent. Se
nior forward Monique Leroux
scored her fourth goal in the last
two games and seventh overall to
extend the Cardinal's lead to 3-0.
Rookie forward Erica Swesey
took advantage of an assist from se
nior midfielder Justina Williams to
record her first goal of the season,
scoring the final goal of the game
and securing Stanford's victory.
Stanford allowed just two shots
on goal.
"Our team defense has been
working really well," she said.
"Our attack plays are clicking so
we're keeping possession of the
ball a lot longer." When the ball
does escape Stanford's control,
Johnson has a simple remedy:
"Our defense is shutting them
down."
