The men's cross country team
cruised to victory Saturday on the
Stanford golf course, successfully
defending its Stanford Champi
onship Invitational title and lending
credence to its No. 1 ranking in the
collegiate polls.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Saturday: Stanford Invitational,
No. 1 Stanford finishes first with 23
points.

And though the Cardinal handily
defeated competition from the likes
of Boise State and 19th-ranked
Brigham Young by tallying a mere
23 points, the manner in which they
handed out the drubbing was a bit
unexpected.
With top returning seniors Brad
and Brent Hauser watching in the
crowd, a lighter squad of Cardinal
harriers took to the trails. Redshirt
freshman Gabe Jennings and senior
Jason Balkman stepped up to lead
the Card with first and second place
overall finishes.
Running in a lead pack of 10 run
ners through four miles, Jennings
and Balkman were joined by seniors
Jonathon Weldon and Chris Lund
strom as well as junior Jake Maas.
With approximately one mile of
the five-mile course to go, Balkman
and Brandon Richards of BYU
broke away from the pack with Jen
nings in tow.
Jennings remained undaunted.

In a crazed charge with a half-mile
remaining, Jennings dusted
Richards and blitzed past Balkman,
pulling the senior along in his wake.
Blazing down the final stretch
and finishing in a time of 24 minutes,
30 seconds, Jennings turned to see
that a tight pack of Stanford runners
had indeed held together behind
him.
Balkman crossed the line two sec
onds behind Jennings, while Weldon
(24:44) and Maas (24:51) followed
soon after in fifth and sixth, respec
tively. Lundstrom secured the victory
with a 25:03 ninth-place finish.
"Cross country is all about run
ning as a pack with a very small gap
between the runners," said head
coach Vin Lananna, who indicated
that the group racing tactic was a
pre-determined strategy. "Every
body has to count."
Stanford's 23 points were most
closely rivaled by the 68 of BYU,
while Boise State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo placed third and fourth,
respectively, with 91 points each.
Lananna was pleased with the per
formance of Jennings and company.
"Gabe is obviously very fit," said
Lananna. "We were way over
trained as a team going into Fresno
[two weeks ago, where Jennings
placed fifth in 25:35], We tried out a
little different strategy today which
seemed to work a little better."
Another bright spot for the Cardi
nal was freshman Jonathan Stevens,
a former California state champion
at 800 meters, who finished a modest
44th in a time of 25:53.
