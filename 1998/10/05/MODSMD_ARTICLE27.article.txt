The gallery that gathered at the
Stanford Golf Course on Saturday
was anything but typical. In fact, the
scene on the golf course resembled a
mob going after a Mark McGwire
home run ball.
But the reason for the frenzied at-

WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY . . ■
■ Saturday: Stanford Invitational, No. 2 Stanford finishes second with l X)
points.

mosphere was the 25th annual Stan
ford Cross Country Invitational and
much of the crowd assembled had
not come primarily to see the No. 1
Stanford men compete.
The 5,000-meter University
Women's Championship Invitation
al race was hyped to be the race of
the day. Featured in it were three of
the top five teams at cross country
nationals last year: No. 1 Brigham
Young, No. 2 Stanford and No. 9
Wisconsin, who finished first, sec
ond and fifth, respectively, at nation
als last year. Also in the running was
No. 12 Arkansas, the 13th-place fin
isher at nationals.
To the dismay of the crowd as the
women lined up for the Champi
onship Invitational, one key runner
was absent from the Stanford lineup,
former invitational champion and
Cardinal captain Mary Cobb. ("ardi

nal head coach Vin Lananna and as
sistant coach Beth Alford-Sullivap
made the decision to pull her from
the lineup 45 minutes before the race
in an effort to keep the team fresh
for future competition.
The race would go on though and
the Cardinal was still in it to win it.
Sophomore Julia Stamps was

shooting for her sixth-straight Stan
ford Invitational championship. Last
year, she captured the title and in all
four of her high school years she
took first in the Varsity Girls Divi
sion I race.
Stamps took control of the race
early on. leading for most of the first
mile. Yet after going through the
first mile in 5:11, she was not alone.
Amy Yoder and Jessica Koch of
Arkansas were just behind her.
In fact, of the top five runners at
the first mile, four were from
Arkansas. They were attempting to
stage what would have been a huge
upset of the nation's top two pro
grams.
As they headed down the hill
after the two-mile marker, the race
was still up in the air both individual
ly and in the team sector. The front
pack was close and neither BYIJ,

Arkansas nor Stanford appeared to
have a commanding grip on the race.
It was at that time that Stamps
seemed to fall out of contention for
another championship.
"Cardiovascular!}/, I felt fitter
than ever," said Stamps. "However,
due to the fact that I've been training
so hard, my legs felt probably a little
more tired in general.
"I felt good going up the hill.
What hurt me was coming down the
hill. I just tried to stay alive, stay
composed."
She did stay composed enough
for an impressive season debut at
third place in 17 minutes even, but
finished behind Yoder, who won the
race with a time of 16:47, and Koch.
Arkansas dominated early with
the No. 1,2 and 5 finishers, but BYU
claimed Nos. 7,9,10,11 and 17.
Behind Stamps, Sally Glynn was
13th for the Cardinal, followed by an
outstanding 14th-place performance
by freshman Caroline Annis. Next in
line were Mary Huang (29th) and
Courtney Adams (31st).
Wisconsin also had a strong front
five across the line.
BYU took the team title with 54
points, and the Cardinal's 9() points
edged the Lady Backs' 92 and the
Badgers' 94.
With Cobb's absence from the
lineup, as well as sophomore Ann
Ramsey's, the Stanford coaches
were pleased with the outcome.

"I think that the women ran very,
very well," Coach Lananna said.
"Considering the lineup that we had
out there, [I'm] really pleased. We
beat Wisconsin and we beat
Arkansas. Those are going to be

worth a lot of good at-large points
for us and I think we learned a lot of
things about the team."
Coach Sullivan agreed with
Lananna. "I am very pleased," said
Sullivan. "Obviously, this is our first

opener with a lull squad. I think our
team showed tremendous tenacity,
hut we definitely have room to grow.
We definitely have room to grow
and it's only October so we will and
that is encouraging."
