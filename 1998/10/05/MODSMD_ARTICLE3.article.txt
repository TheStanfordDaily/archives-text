# Casper enthused about new opportunities on the Farm

### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Entering his seventh year as
Stanford University president,
Gerhard Casper is in a "state of
elation" regarding current Univer
sity projects and challenges in the
future.
The creation of Introductory
Studies and the new Alumni Asso
ciation will provide growing oppor
tunities for students, faculty, staff
and alumni to interact with each
other on a more in-depth level.
The recent effort to focus on the
first two years of undergraduate
education has so far been a success,
according to Casper. Academic
programs, such as the freshman
and sophomore seminars and
Sophomore College, seem to be
popular.

The goal now is to examine how
well the experiments have worked
and consolidate the gains of these
programs, Casper said.

Stanford Introductory Studies
Casper recognized that being a
student at a research university has
both drawbacks and benefits, and
the goal of Stanford Introductory
Studies is to build on those benefits
and "give students the opportunity
to challenge themselves in small
group interaction" with a profes
sor.
"Our immediate challenge is to
press home the availability of these
extraordinary opportunities" and
help students take advantage of
them, Casper said.
In the long run, the success of
programs such as Sophomore Col
lege will depend on fundraising
and student enthusiasm.
One thing that students have
demanded are more all freshman

dormitories.
This year, with dormitories such
as Cedro, Soto and Faisan. which
are newly all-freshman. Housing
Assignment Services came closer
to meeting the demand of incoming
freshmen for such a residence.
"Many students find the all
frosh experience more intense: col
lege is both about learning and a
rite of passage, and the all-frosh
dorms encourage this experience,"
Casper said.
He added that as Stanford Intro
ductory Studies grows, there may
be additional ways to incorporate it
into the residences, thus increasing
intellectual discourse in the living
space.
Casper said he believes that this
type of discourse is important in all
areas of the University, one of the
reasons he was excited about the
merger of the Alumni Association
into the University.
Alumni Association
Hopefully, the merger will make

"labels and reality coincide," giv
ing alumni a closer connection to
the University when they want to
volunteer, contact other alumni or
get more information about contin
uing education, Casper said.
When the association was a sep
arate entity, it "increased transac
tion costs, and we needed to be
more effective" as a clearing house
for alumni information, Casper ex
plained. "The bifurcation of the or
ganizations made it difficult to es
tablish a presence through the
country as a resource for alumni."
Educational goals for the new
association include an increased
national presence, summer "col
lege" designed for alumni, and pos
sibly the use of technology in dis
tance learning projects, Casper
said.
Acting as a forum
Stanford's growing prestige and
academic influence call into ques
tion the University's role in society
as well.
While there has been pressure
for universities to take political
stands on issues, Casper maintains
that "the role of the University is to

provide a forum for the discussion
of issues, and not to take sides."
Whether the issue is investment
policy in Burma or environmental
justice, Casper said that students
and faculty themselves need to
make decisions about how to exer
cise their citizenship.
"Universities are not set up to
judge which company is complying
with which standards; it can't make
people be responsible citizens" by
enforcing a policy, Casper said.
The exception to this is when an
issue directly affects the function
ing of the University, such as affir
mative action.
Such was the case in 1995, when
Prop. 209 outlawed race as a deter
minate for admission to public uni
versities.
Casper felt that the issue had
such direct and relevant impor
tance to Stanford, that it was vital
to take a stand on it and defend its
use.
"Students should take action
through political parties and volun
teer work," Casper said, explaining
that it is dangerous to make the
classroom itself a captive of politi
cal views.
