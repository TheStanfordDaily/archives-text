Entering his seventh year as
Stanford University president,
Gerhard Casper is in a "state of
elation" regarding current Univer
sity projects and challenges in the
future.
The creation of Introductory
Studies and the new Alumni Asso
ciation will provide growing oppor
tunities for students, faculty, staff
and alumni to interact with each
other on a more in-depth level.
The recent effort to focus on the
first two years of undergraduate
education has so far been a success,
according to Casper. Academic
programs, such as the freshman
and sophomore seminars and
Sophomore College, seem to be
popular.

The goal now is to examine how
well the experiments have worked
and consolidate the gains of these
programs, Casper said.

Stanford Introductory Studies
Casper recognized that being a
student at a research university has
both drawbacks and benefits, and
the goal of Stanford Introductory
Studies is to build on those benefits
and "give students the opportunity
to challenge themselves in small
group interaction" with a profes
sor.
"Our immediate challenge is to
press home the availability of these
extraordinary opportunities" and
help students take advantage of
them, Casper said.
In the long run, the success of
programs such as Sophomore Col
lege will depend on fundraising
and student enthusiasm.
One thing that students have
demanded are more all freshman
