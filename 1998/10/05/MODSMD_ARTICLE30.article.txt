The 13th-ranked Stanford women's soccer
team (6-1-2) was able to convert on two free
kicks for a 2-0 win against Southern Methodist
(4-5) last Friday at New Maloney Field.
"It's a good result," said head coach Steve
Swanson. "It's always good when we don't
play as well as we could have and still come out
with a win."

WOMEN'S SOCCER
â–  Friday: No. 13 Stanford 2, Southern
Methodist 0.

SMI J fought hard the entire game, chal
lenging every 50-50 ball and applying physical
pressure on Stanford. The Mustangs played a
much more direct style of soccer than Stan
ford. driving the ball straight at the defense
while Stanford tried a more creative, building
offense.
The Cardinal received crucial help from its
bench as junior Catherine Bernard, sopho
more Christy LaPierre and freshman Martha
West all gave the Cardinal strong minutes.
"The team's making it difficult because we
have so many good players," said Swanson.
"Its a great luxury to have."
The forward duo of redshirt junior Kelly
Adamson and senior Tracye Lawyer did a
good job up front, frustrating the Mustang de
fense from the start. The SMIJ defense quick
ly picked up on Adamson's skill and began to
triple-team her. When Adamson was able to
distribute the ball, she looked for Lawyer
wide down the wing, who used her speed to
wards the goal.
Stanford didn't score this way but its work
eventually paid off. Mustang defender Lana
Darnell had her work cut out for her as she des
perately tried to defend Lawyer.
Darnell, trying to keep up with Lawyer, was
left with no other option and tripped Lawyer in
side the box. Stanford received a penalty kick.
Junior Ronnie Fair, Stanford's resident ex
pert in free kicks, scored in the 34th minute on

the penalty kiek by driving the ball straight on
the ground to the bottom left corner.
The second goal came in the 50th minute
after a series of three corner kicks. Defender
Christy Arnold, a redshirt sophomore, came
out of nowhere and connected with freshman
Erin Maurer's corner kick for the insurance
goal.
Fair was a force to be reckoned with the en
tire game as she anchored the midfield. win
ning almost every tackle she went into and
penetrating up the field when given the
chance.
Arnold, in the stopper position, also had an
excellent game, as did goalkeeper sophomore
Carly Smolak.
Smolak, named last week's Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Week following her 10
saves against Santa Clara, again came up with
live key saves for the Cardinal for her fourth
shutout of the year.
Her shining moment came late in the sec
ond half as an SMIJ defender tipped a free kick
toward the goal. Smolak knocked the ball up
to stop the shot, only to have it hit the top cross
bar and rebound out. A shot was taken but
stopped by a Stanford defender and the Cardi
nal finally cleared the ball after a scramble in
side the box.
"The defense is doing a great job," said
Smolak. "Il makes my job a lot easier because
each situation is not as dangerous as it could
be."
Stanford will have another chance to play a
team similar to SMIJ tonight as I hey face BYU
at 7 p.m on New Maloney Field. The Cougars
are as forceful as SMI J, but have more speed.
"BYU is a faster version of SMU," said
Swanson. "They get lots of goals from their
two forwards and it's going to take a great ef
fort on our part to get a good result."
It will be good practice for the Cardinal as
they start Pac-10 play this Friday since teams
like USC and UCLA also have direct, speedy
offenses.
"Our defense is playing well but we have to
be able to get a couple of goals against teams
like these," Swanson said. "It's a question of
can we impose our style on them."
