# Forum on Global Change calls for environmental responsibility

Stanford professors and other
environmental experts warned of
the potential devastating effects of
environmental destruction at the
Forum on Global Change, held Sat
urday at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Nine speakers emphasized that
the responsibility for saving the
planet rests on both scientists and
the public.
According to the panelists.

many factors contribute to a wors
ening environment. Deforestation,
population growth, and increased
land and water usage are some fac
tors that stress the earth, panelists
said. Consequences include in
creased floods and droughts and
mass starvation.
Panelists also discussed the
backlash against the environmen
talist movement by people who
doubt scientific findings on the po
tentially harmful consequences of

environmental change.
"There is still an aura of uncer
tainty attached to environmental
change," said Biology Prof. Peter
Vitousek. "People ask, 'Is this
real?'"
Although they said environmen
tal responsibility rests on the pub
lic, experts agreed that scientists
must do a better job of educating
the masses.
"I feel that friends are aston
ished at the amount of information
in the scientific world, yet there is
little effort on the part of scientists
to transmit this information to the
public," said biologist Gretchen
Daily.
"We need a lot more incentives
in academic institutions to promote
communication between the busi
ness community and the general
public," Daily said. "We as a com
munity look like a self-cloistered
elite. We certainly give that per
spective."
Biology Prof. Steven Schneider
added, "It's hard for people to sign
on at a collective scale when they
don't know why."
Critics charge that global change
is normal and can even benefit the
environment. They say politics, not
science, drives the environmental
ists' agenda.

An article on the Internet enti
tled "Global Warming: The Trojan
Horse of Environmental Scares"
criticizes Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich and Schneider for drama
tizing the possible results of global
warming.
"It's not my agenda," Ehrlich
said in response to the article. "It's
the results 0f... thousands of scien
tists [from the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.]" The
IPCC is a United Nations spon
sored organization comprised of
2,500 international scientists who
study global warming.
If the rate of consumption and
environmental destruction doesn't
decrease, there is a "10 percent pos
sibility of the absolute catastrophic
destruction of humanity," Ehrlich
said.
Vitousek said the Earth has seen
a 30 percent increase in carbon
dioxide since the Industrial Revolu
tion, half of which has been pro
duced in the last 30 years. Humans
are using more than half of accessi

ble water and have transformed
half of the Earth's usable land sur
face.
Increased consumption has
killed off irreplaceable animals and
plants, Vitousek said.
The experts suggested environ
mentally conscious voting, imple
menting a gas tax, changing daily
habits and improving science edu
cation as ways to help the planet.
"The most important thing indi
viduals can do is get involved in
public policy," said Economics
Prof. Larry Goulder.
"It's crucial to use power as a
green voter," Goulder said. "It's at
least as important as being a green
user."
Schneider advocated supporting
a political movement that presses
politicians to vote for earth-friend
ly initiatives.
Panelists favored a gas tax sug
gested by the Kyoto Protocol, a
treaty agreed to by the internation
al community in December 1997.
"Environmental benefits would

vastly outweigh costs," said Goul
der.
Despite polls showing that about
eight out of 10 Americans identify
themselves as environmentalists,
Goulder said the public thinks first
of its purse strings instead of future
benefits.
"The public will reject a piddling
increase in the gas tax. I think this is
an infantile approach to the envi
ronment. A gas tax will make even
the people who are paying the tax
much better off," Goulder said.
Improving science education in
schools is another way to slow cli
mate change, experts said.
"I don't think education gets at
the hard issues of how to reduce
pollution and how policies can
make us better off," Goulder said.
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy
supported the idea of a required
freshman course at Stanford deal
ing with environmental issues.
"We have to protect the envi
ronment from ourselves," Kennedy
said.
