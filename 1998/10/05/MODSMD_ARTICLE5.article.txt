## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Kappa Alpha's first major open
party after being housed this year
was shut down by the police at the
fraternity's request Saturday. The
breakup was due to security con
cerns and a brief scuffle.
According to KA members, a
group of 8 to 10 men, at least one of
whom they identified as a member
of the wrestling team, attempted to
get into the well-attended '50s
themed party.
"The only requirement for guys
to get in was that they had to have on

a white shirt," explained Bob Baird,
KA president. "These guys weren't
wearing white shirts, so we didn't let
them in."
After being turned away at the
door, the group went around to the
back of the house and attempted to
force their way in.
"They tore down the fence," said
house resident assistant John Lotz.
"After that, we had no way to keep
control of the party."
Baird and other KAs met the
group behind the house and threat
ened to call the police. The group re
spondee! by daring the KAs to make
the phone call. When Baird went
hack into the house and returned
with a telephone, the altercation en
sued.
"I asked them, 'Do I really need
to call the police?'" said Baird.
" Then some random guy who wasn't
a K A or even anyone we knew start
ed throwing punches at those guys.
We had no clue who this guy was."

After the unknown person at
tacked the large group by himself
and was hit by several of them, KA
members pulled the combatants
apart.
At that point, police were called
and the DJ was told to stop playing.
The party was completely dissolved
within the hour.
"If we had wanted to, we could
have put the fence back up and kept
the party going," said Lotz. "But
there were so many people there it
had the potential to get out of hand."
The whereabouts and identity of

the instigator remain a mystery.
"He just disappeared after we
pulled the guys off of him," said
Baird.
"This was really not a big deal,"
said one KA member who declined
to give his name. "No one got hurt or
anything."

that he had not heard about the inci
dent and therefore had no comment.
In addition, Stanford police have
not released a report on the alterca
tion yet. and therefore had no com
ment.
