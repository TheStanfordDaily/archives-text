# Holbrooke delays Kresge appearance
## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
United States Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke, mediator of
the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords
that ended the Bosnian War, flew
to Europe last night to meet with
Serbian officials about the future of
the troubled region of Kosovo. As
a result, his speech scheduled for
today in Kresge Auditorium has
been postponed.
According to a statement re
leased by the State Department,
"The purpose of Ambassador Hol
brooke's meeting with President
Milosevic is to underscore the clear
requirements of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1199 and to
emphasize the need for prompt and
full compliance."
The resolution allowed the use

of military force as a method for
settling conflict in Kosovo, and
NATO has threatened to attack
the region.
The conflict involves the army in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal re
public, and Albanian rebels, the
ethnic majority in the region who
are fighting for independence. Re
ports indicate Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used mili
tary force to stamp out the rebels
and maintain Kosovo's status as a
province.
Holbrooke will also speak with
NATO officials at NATO head
quarters in Brussels, according to a
statement by State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin.
"[Holbrooke] is known as a
hard-headed, realist type of media
tor," said Stephen Stedman, senior
research scholar at the Center for
International Security and Cooper
ation.
"He's the antithesis of the type
of mediator that works on building
up trust among adversaries," Sted
man explained
Holbrooke lias been nominated
by the Clinton administration as
United Nations ambassador, with
confirmation proceedings sched
uled for 1999.
"I hope that (Holbrooke] comes
back [to campus] to give Stanford
students an opportunity to find out

why the United States is committed
to peace in the region," said Sted
man.
Holbrooke has been involved,
in several capacities, in high-level
international relations for over 25
years.
He was one of the members of
the American delegation to the
Paris peace talks on the Vietnam
War. and then served as Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs from 1977 to
1981
From 1993 to 1994 he was the
United States ambassador to Ger
many, followed by a stint as Assis
tant Secretary of State for Euro
pean and Canadian Affairs from
1994 to 1996.

This year Holbrooke published
a book about his experienees in
Yugoslavia titled "To End a War,"
and, according to Stedman, trav
eled to Kosovo earlier this year in
an informal capacity.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau,
responsible for bringing Hol
brooke to campus, said that the lec
ture will be rescheduled sometime
later this month.
When the new date of the lec
ture is determined, it will be adver
tised and new tickets will be issued
in White Plaza.
Approximately 300 tickets had
already been distributed for the
Oct. 5 event, and that number was
steadily increasing, according to
Kass.
