United States Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke, mediator of
the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords
that ended the Bosnian War, flew
to Europe last night to meet with
Serbian officials about the future of
the troubled region of Kosovo. As
a result, his speech scheduled for
today in Kresge Auditorium has
been postponed.
According to a statement re
leased by the State Department,
"The purpose of Ambassador Hol
brooke's meeting with President
Milosevic is to underscore the clear
requirements of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1199 and to
emphasize the need for prompt and
full compliance."
The resolution allowed the use

of military force as a method for
settling conflict in Kosovo, and
NATO has threatened to attack
the region.
The conflict involves the army in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's principal re
public, and Albanian rebels, the
ethnic majority in the region who
are fighting for independence. Re
ports indicate Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used mili
tary force to stamp out the rebels
and maintain Kosovo's status as a
province.
Holbrooke will also speak with
NATO officials at NATO head
quarters in Brussels, according to a
statement by State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin.
"[Holbrooke] is known as a
hard-headed, realist type of media
