## Sociologists find Gen X angst saturates society

"Gen||Ltion known for its bitter, angst
ridden been fueling the fire of pop
ular ample of decades. Books such
as X", independent
films Juftkletter's "Slacker" and tor
tured Ethan such as "Reality Bites"
have shown ytjing people that the times have been hard
on them is bleak.
Whatfwo Stanford sociologists. Prof. David Grusky
and doctoral student Eric Rice, have discovered is that
X is not alone. The researchers found that
although the stereotype of the alienated generation of
twerttysomethings born between 1965 and 1977 is over
marketed, it accurately portrays the feelings of a signif
i,CJHH Amber of them. However, it fits their parents and
grandparents as well.
Boffljwo late to be hippies, too genuine to be yuppies
and heirli&the social ills such as AIDS, homelessness,
and the eimmnment, "GenXers" are all doomed to feel
disaffection i√üfc-the future and the powerlessness to
change it.
There are even Web sites devoted solely to GenXers
and their language. Examples of this language include
"101-ism: The tendency to pick apart, often in minute
detail, all aspects of life using half-understood pop psy
chology as a tool," or "Poor Buoyancy: The realization
that one was a better person when one had less money."
The 25-year-old Rice considers himself "on good
days" a member of that socially and politically critical
generation. He says what first got him interested in
Generation X was "reading Coupland's book in the
summer of 1992, seeing 'Slacker' and going to Lolla
palooza all within about two weeks of each other."
Grusky, in his tenth year at Stanford, became inter
ested in Generation X because of the popular commen
tary on the classical sociological issues of disaffection,
alienation, cynicism and disengagement with society.

"Generation X commentators are speaking to a mas
sive failure in integration, and hence sociologists should
be most interested in their work, despite the tendency
among academics to disparage popular commentary,"
Grusky said.
He added that although the Generation X commen
tators are accurate in their description of their sources
of disaffection, they have failed to appreciate that this
could operate equally within all age groups.
Their research consisted of a comparison of how dif
ferent age groups answered certain questions such as:
"Do you have faith in the press? Do you think the lot of
the average man is getting better or worse? Do you
think it's fair to bring up a child in the world today?"
They found that when the Baby Boomers were
young adults in the 70s, about 20 percent felt cynical
and unhappy, and by the '90s, 35 percent of 18- to 29-
year olds felt that way. What's worse is that the older
generations do also. Twenty-eight percent of adults
ages 30 to 45 and 39 percent of those ages 46 to 60 feel
just as bleak.
According to Grusky, the sources of each genera
tion's disaffection could be varied. He suspects that
older people probably view their disaffection in terms
of nostalgia for better days gone by, whereas that of
middle-aged adults may be related to and understood as
part of the usual mid-life crisis.
"The disaffection of the Generation X groups should
be understood, by contrast, as the altogether reasonable
and understandable response of [relative] newcomers
to a social system that fails to measure up to their
ideals," said Grusky.
Rice is quick to come to the defense of the unique
sources of the malaise of the X'd Generation.
"Even though GenX is not alone," he said, "You un
derstand your place in the world through how you and
your friends talk about it. The point is more that as
much as every generation comes to understand the
