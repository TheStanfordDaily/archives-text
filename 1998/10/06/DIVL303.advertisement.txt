The* Cowell Health Series, Number 2 7
Staying Healthy at Your\
COMPUTER
Event
Ever consider run
ning a marathon
every day? That
would take 55,000
strides daily, and your
body couldn't do it.
But when you type 60
words a minute, your
lingers pound out 21,600 strokes
an hour. For your fingers, that's
like running a marathon every two
and a half hours! No wonder
computer users get some aches
and pains.
The Problem
When you work at your com
puter, small repeated motions
cause minor trauma to delicate
muscles and tendons. With
prolonged computer use, nerve
damage may gradually accu
mulate. Then boom. You've got a
problem: a repetitive strain injury
(RSI). Even simple daily activities
may become painful.
Symptoms
Pain, aching, tingling, fatigue
and/or numbness in fingers,
hands, wrists, arms, shoulders,
neck, back. Eyestrain; headache.
What to Do
■ Immediately stop the painful
activity (don't try to "work it
through" )
■ Try icing the painful areas,
and rest
■ If symptoms persist, see your
medical practitioner (prompt
treatment often results in full
recovery )
Prevention Tips
RSIs are easier to prevent than
to cure, so:
■ Use relaxed good posture
(don't hunch your shoulders
or sit rigidly - that cramps
muscles and knots your neck)
b
*
Look - desks with no computers!
In the '30s this Stanford student
gathered data in a more relaxed
(and ergonomicallif oblivious) waif.
■ Stretch often to n'lax tight mus
cles and improve blcxxl flow
■ Take breaks; move around at
least every 30 minutes
■ Relax hands, and keep wrists
in a natural position
■ Hold the mouse lightly
■ Alternate thumbs on spacebar
■ Type gently; use as little force
as possible
■ Rest your eyes often, and get
them checked regularly
■ For a more resilient body, pay
attention to your diet, exer
cise, and keep yourself well
hvd rated
Your Workstation
You can get important benefits by
making some small, low-cost
changes. I lere's how:
Your Chair
■ Ihe seat should be level and
padded, but not too soft
■ Full back support is best (if
needed, use a pillow or rolled
towel for back support)
■ Rest both feet flat
on floor (or use a
footrest or a stack
telephone books)
■ Don't rest arms on
armrests while typing
Keyboard
■ Position at lap level,
or slightly higher
■ Keep your shoulders relaxed
(not shrugged)
■ Upper arms should be
straight down, elbows at 90
degrees, and wrists straight
■ Don't strain fingers or bend
wrists sideways to reach keys
(move entire arm along key
board instead)
■ Use wrist pad only while
resting; do not use while
typing
Mouse
■ Should be close to keyboard,
and fit comfortably in cupped,
relaxed hand
Monitor
■ Place between 16" and 28"
from your eyes
■ Top of screen should be level
with your forehead; eyes
looking slightly downward
■ Make sure its bright enough
to match ambient light
■ Avoid reflection, glare, and
screen flicker
■ Keep your work at eye level
(invest in a page holder)
Laptops
If you use a laptop, you probably
can't follow the recommendations
above due to its design. Try to
avoid prolonged use, and switch
to a full-size monitor and a dock
ing station whenever possible. O
