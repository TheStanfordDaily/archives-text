# Room for protest on campus?
## Students, Provost discuss legacy of grape protests 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
By sponsoring standardized ed
ucation and a University-wide vot j
ing week on the United Farm
Workers' grape boycott, the Uni
versity is making the grapes issue
more visible on campus than it has
been in years.
This new effort, though, should
not be construed as a trend favor
ing campus protest. As the grapes
boycott captures more campus at
tention, Stanford activists are mov
ing away from the very type of
protest that made grapes such a
significant campus issue. And, at
the same time, the University ad
ministration pledges to make no
similar compromises in the future.
"Stanford should not be in the
business of championing any moral
/ political cause just because one
group wants it," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said.
The IJFW grapes boycott, after
all, claims a unique spot in Stanford
history.
On May 4, 1994, four Stanford
■students went on a hunger strike
that lasted for three days. Forty
two students fasted for 24 hours.
Hundreds rallied behind the strik
ers.
One principal cause of the stu
dent outcry: the lack of a Universi
ty ban on California table grapes.
The protesters hoped the Universi
ty, as an institution, would take a

stand against the pesticide expo
sure and the poor living conditions
of California grape workers.
The students argued that the
University's pledge in 19K8 to have
the Dean of Students Office and
University Dining Services sponsor
residence-based education and
voting on the grapes boycott was
insufficient.
The University President and
Provost in 1995, however, reaf
firmed the status-quo policy — the
very policy students had protested
against.

The students grapes boycott ef
fort could be viewed as a failure,
but such a short-sighted judgment
would ignore the significance of the
protest on Stanford today.
The grapes boycott remains a
campus issue that claims a remark
able amount of student attention.
"The fact that students are still
voting on grapes is a legacy of stu
dent activism on campus," said Jill
Shenker, a senior and formerly co
coordinator of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford.
The recent work of the Grapes

Education Committee is a testimo
ny to its continued campus promi
nence.
The administration
Although backing the recent
grapes education effort, high-level
University administrators hope to
keep the grape issue unique.
Rice, in fact, said she does not
think that the University ought to
have a policy on grapes ... but she

does support the policy.
Her support is based on respect
for past policy rather than an effort
to help the grapes issue capture
campus attention. "It seemed in
sensitive to reverse a decision that
had been made in '88," Rice ex
plained.
In addition. Rice construes the
current education effort as just a
means of bettering a democratic
process already established before
both she and University President
Gerhard Casper took their positions.
"It's a philosophical-type
thing," explained Rice. "If people
are asked to vote, we'd like them to
be educated on the issue."
Support or no support for educa
tion. Rice does not back any expan
sion of the current grapes policy.
"We let stand a policy that was
in place and that was a policy that

focused on the residences, so I can
live with that policy," Rice said.
"But 1 would be hard-pressed to
imagine the circumstances where
we would extend that model in the
residences."
Even though she would not rule
out the possibility of a residence
vote on strawberries. Rice did say
she would also oppose an initiation
of a new policy on strawberries or
meat.
Strawberries, like grapes, are
subject to protest over the use of
pesticides and working condition
issues.
"The University is neither a gov
ernmental body nor an individual
actor, and it has to stay very far
away from political issues when
they do not affect what the Univer
sity is trying to do," Rice said.
The very diversity of Stanford is
even more of a reason not to sup
port a group's cause, according to
Rice. She does not want Stanford

to slide down any slippery slope of
political activism, where it would
take a stance on one group's cause
after another's. Rice mentioned
abortion as an example of an issue
that the University could be called
to vote on if its taking political po
sitions became the norm.
Rice instead urged students to
"go and work in the democratic
processes of cities and state govern
ments — that's where the political
issue belongs."
As for on-campus issues. Rice
encouraged students to work
through the processes already es
tablished to handle student con
cerns.
"People protesting in the Quad
would never get me or. I think 1 can
speak for Gerhard too. to do some
thing that we wouldn't do — to vio
late our personal principles or to do
something that is not in the interest
of the University," Rice said.
She cited the graduate student

housing protest on the Quad last
year as an example.
The protest, she contended, was
not necessary. In fact, the Universi
ty had already decided to build the
new graduate student housing units
in Escondido Village before the
protest.
"I didn't need students on the
Quad to tell me that there was a
housing problem," Rice remarked.
The students
Despite Rice's claim that
protests are typically ineffective,
many student activists still strongly
support the work of the hunger
strikers.
"I highly respect the people who
went on the hunger strike, and I
think that what they did was very
worthwhile, bringing a lot of issues
that we've had to deal with to the
forefront." said junior Genevieve
Haguilar, co-chair of MEChA, the
Chieano / Latino organization that
spearheaded the 1994 hunger
strike.
Student activists, unlike Rice,
credit much of the current Univer
sity action on grapes to not he a re

sult of supporting past policy but a
response to the dramatic hunger
strike.
"The grapes boycott at Stanford
has been institutionalized at Stan
ford because of the hunger strike,"
said Shenker. "We would not have
a Grapes Education Committee
had there not been a hunger strike.
It was a compromise."
However, despite the success at
tributed to the hunger strike,
MEChA now is not considering a

hunger strike as a strategy to
protest administrative action or in
action, according to Haguilar.
MEChA. moreover, is not even
supporting a strawberry boycott.
Student activists credit a change in
strategies to the change in UFW ac
tions.
"We're working in conjunction
with the union, so we're not going
to step on their toes," Shenker said.
MEC'hA supports the IJFW's
efforts, and this time, with straw

berries, the union is focusing on ed
ucational efforts.
"They're trying to work things
out so that it doesn't have to come
to the level of being a boycott,"
Haguilar explained.
Last year, both SEAS and
MEChA joined together to sup
port a "Coalition for Labor Digni
ty and Justice" in response to the
strawberry issue. They jointly
sponsored week-long programs:
bringing UFW President Arturo

Rodriguez to campus, organizing a
chance for union workers to speak
out about their concerns at Stan
ford and publicizing MEChA cul
tural events.
Also, the two groups passed out
leaflets at Whole Foods and
worked with IJFW members on its
strawberry campaign throughout
the year.
Several hundred students on
campus last year fasted and gave
the money that they would have

otherwise spent on meals to the
United Farm Workers.
But despite the new focus on ed
ucation and the hard-line policy the
administration is declaring, there
still remains some protest spirit on
Stanford's campus.
Shenker was sure to assert that
student activism is far from dead.
" That's one thing that the edu
cation campaign should try to teach
— that student involvement can
make a difference."

had there not been a hunger strike.
It was a compromise."
However, despite the success at
tributed to the hunger strike,
MEChA now is not considering a

hunger strike as a strategy to
protest administrative action or in
action, according to Haguilar.
MEChA. moreover, is not even
supporting a strawberry boycott.
Student activists credit a change in
strategies to the change in UFW ac
tions.
"We're working in conjunction
with the union, so we're not going
to step on their toes," Shenker said.
MEC'hA supports the IJFW's
efforts, and this time, with straw

berries, the union is focusing on ed
ucational efforts.
"They're trying to work things
out so that it doesn't have to come
to the level of being a boycott,"
Haguilar explained.
Last year, both SEAS and
MEChA joined together to sup
port a "Coalition for Labor Digni
ty and Justice" in response to the
strawberry issue. They jointly
sponsored week-long programs:
bringing UFW President Arturo

Rodriguez to campus, organizing a
chance for union workers to speak
out about their concerns at Stan
ford and publicizing MEChA cul
tural events.
Also, the two groups passed out
leaflets at Whole Foods and
worked with IJFW members on its
strawberry campaign throughout
the year.
Several hundred students on
campus last year fasted and gave
the money that they would have

otherwise spent on meals to the
United Farm Workers.
But despite the new focus on ed
ucation and the hard-line policy the
administration is declaring, there
still remains some protest spirit on
Stanford's campus.
Shenker was sure to assert that
student activism is far from dead.
" That's one thing that the edu
cation campaign should try to teach
— that student involvement can
make a difference."
By sponsoring standardized ed
ucation and a University-wide vot j
ing week on the United Farm
Workers' grape boycott, the Uni
versity is making the grapes issue
more visible on campus than it has
been in years.
This new effort, though, should
not be construed as a trend favor
ing campus protest. As the grapes
boycott captures more campus at
tention, Stanford activists are mov
ing away from the very type of
protest that made grapes such a
significant campus issue. And, at
the same time, the University ad
ministration pledges to make no
similar compromises in the future.
"Stanford should not be in the
business of championing any moral
/ political cause just because one
group wants it," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said.
The IJFW grapes boycott, after
all, claims a unique spot in Stanford
history.
On May 4, 1994, four Stanford
■students went on a hunger strike
that lasted for three days. Forty
two students fasted for 24 hours.
Hundreds rallied behind the strik
ers.
One principal cause of the stu
dent outcry: the lack of a Universi
ty ban on California table grapes.
The protesters hoped the Universi
ty, as an institution, would take a

stand against the pesticide expo
sure and the poor living conditions
of California grape workers.
The students argued that the
University's pledge in 19K8 to have
the Dean of Students Office and
University Dining Services sponsor
residence-based education and
voting on the grapes boycott was
insufficient.
The University President and
Provost in 1995, however, reaf
firmed the status-quo policy — the
very policy students had protested
against.

The students grapes boycott ef
fort could be viewed as a failure,
but such a short-sighted judgment
would ignore the significance of the
protest on Stanford today.
The grapes boycott remains a
campus issue that claims a remark
able amount of student attention.
"The fact that students are still
voting on grapes is a legacy of stu
dent activism on campus," said Jill
Shenker, a senior and formerly co
coordinator of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford.
The recent work of the Grapes

Education Committee is a testimo
ny to its continued campus promi
nence.
The administration
Although backing the recent
grapes education effort, high-level
University administrators hope to
keep the grape issue unique.
Rice, in fact, said she does not
think that the University ought to
have a policy on grapes ... but she

does support the policy.
Her support is based on respect
for past policy rather than an effort
to help the grapes issue capture
campus attention. "It seemed in
sensitive to reverse a decision that
had been made in '88," Rice ex
plained.
In addition. Rice construes the
current education effort as just a
means of bettering a democratic
process already established before
both she and University President
Gerhard Casper took their positions.
"It's a philosophical-type
thing," explained Rice. "If people
are asked to vote, we'd like them to
be educated on the issue."
Support or no support for educa
tion. Rice does not back any expan
sion of the current grapes policy.
"We let stand a policy that was
in place and that was a policy that

focused on the residences, so I can
live with that policy," Rice said.
"But 1 would be hard-pressed to
imagine the circumstances where
we would extend that model in the
residences."
Even though she would not rule
out the possibility of a residence
vote on strawberries. Rice did say
she would also oppose an initiation
of a new policy on strawberries or
meat.
Strawberries, like grapes, are
subject to protest over the use of
pesticides and working condition
issues.
"The University is neither a gov
ernmental body nor an individual
actor, and it has to stay very far
away from political issues when
they do not affect what the Univer
sity is trying to do," Rice said.
The very diversity of Stanford is
even more of a reason not to sup
port a group's cause, according to
Rice. She does not want Stanford

to slide down any slippery slope of
political activism, where it would
take a stance on one group's cause
after another's. Rice mentioned
abortion as an example of an issue
that the University could be called
to vote on if its taking political po
sitions became the norm.
Rice instead urged students to
"go and work in the democratic
processes of cities and state govern
ments — that's where the political
issue belongs."
As for on-campus issues. Rice
encouraged students to work
through the processes already es
tablished to handle student con
cerns.
"People protesting in the Quad
would never get me or. I think 1 can
speak for Gerhard too. to do some
thing that we wouldn't do — to vio
late our personal principles or to do
something that is not in the interest
of the University," Rice said.
She cited the graduate student

housing protest on the Quad last
year as an example.
The protest, she contended, was
not necessary. In fact, the Universi
ty had already decided to build the
new graduate student housing units
in Escondido Village before the
protest.
"I didn't need students on the
Quad to tell me that there was a
housing problem," Rice remarked.
The students
Despite Rice's claim that
protests are typically ineffective,
many student activists still strongly
support the work of the hunger
strikers.
"I highly respect the people who
went on the hunger strike, and I
think that what they did was very
worthwhile, bringing a lot of issues
that we've had to deal with to the
forefront." said junior Genevieve
Haguilar, co-chair of MEChA, the
Chieano / Latino organization that
spearheaded the 1994 hunger
strike.
Student activists, unlike Rice,
credit much of the current Univer
sity action on grapes to not he a re

sult of supporting past policy but a
response to the dramatic hunger
strike.
"The grapes boycott at Stanford
has been institutionalized at Stan
ford because of the hunger strike,"
said Shenker. "We would not have
a Grapes Education Committee
had there not been a hunger strike.
It was a compromise."
However, despite the success at
tributed to the hunger strike,
MEChA now is not considering a

hunger strike as a strategy to
protest administrative action or in
action, according to Haguilar.
MEChA. moreover, is not even
supporting a strawberry boycott.
Student activists credit a change in
strategies to the change in UFW ac
tions.
"We're working in conjunction
with the union, so we're not going

MEC'hA supports the IJFW's
efforts, and this time, with straw

berries, the union is focusing on ed
ucational efforts.
"They're trying to work things
out so that it doesn't have to come
to the level of being a boycott,"
Haguilar explained.
Last year, both SEAS and
MEChA joined together to sup
