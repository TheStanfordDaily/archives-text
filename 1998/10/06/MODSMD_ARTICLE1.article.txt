# Room for protest on campus?
## Students, Provost discuss legacy of grape protests 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
By sponsoring standardized ed
ucation and a University-wide vot j
ing week on the United Farm
Workers' grape boycott, the Uni
versity is making the grapes issue
more visible on campus than it has
been in years.
This new effort, though, should
not be construed as a trend favor
ing campus protest. As the grapes
boycott captures more campus at
tention, Stanford activists are mov
ing away from the very type of
protest that made grapes such a
significant campus issue. And, at
the same time, the University ad
ministration pledges to make no
similar compromises in the future.
"Stanford should not be in the
business of championing any moral
/ political cause just because one
group wants it," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said.
The IJFW grapes boycott, after
all, claims a unique spot in Stanford
history.
On May 4, 1994, four Stanford
■students went on a hunger strike
that lasted for three days. Forty
two students fasted for 24 hours.
Hundreds rallied behind the strik
ers.
One principal cause of the stu
dent outcry: the lack of a Universi
ty ban on California table grapes.
The protesters hoped the Universi
ty, as an institution, would take a

stand against the pesticide expo
sure and the poor living conditions
of California grape workers.
The students argued that the
University's pledge in 19K8 to have
the Dean of Students Office and
University Dining Services sponsor
residence-based education and
voting on the grapes boycott was
insufficient.
The University President and
Provost in 1995, however, reaf
firmed the status-quo policy — the
very policy students had protested
against.

The students grapes boycott ef
fort could be viewed as a failure,
but such a short-sighted judgment
would ignore the significance of the
protest on Stanford today.
The grapes boycott remains a
campus issue that claims a remark
able amount of student attention.
"The fact that students are still
voting on grapes is a legacy of stu
dent activism on campus," said Jill
Shenker, a senior and formerly co
coordinator of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford.
The recent work of the Grapes

Education Committee is a testimo

Although backing the recent
grapes education effort, high-level
University administrators hope to
keep the grape issue unique.
Rice, in fact, said she does not
think that the University ought to
have a policy on grapes ... but she
