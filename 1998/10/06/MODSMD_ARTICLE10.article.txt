WASHINGTON (AP) - The House Judiciary Com
mittee clashed in historic debate Monday over a Repub
lican demand for an open-ended impeachment inquiry
of President Clinton. The top GOP lawyer cited "sub
stantial and credible evidence" of 15 possible grounds
for impeachment.
"Do we have a duty to look further, or to look
away?" asked Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., shortly after
gaveling the committee to order in the same cavernous
room where Richard Nixon's fate was debated a quar
ter-century ago.
"This is not about Watergate," retorted Rep. John
Convers of Michigan, the panel's senior Democrat. "It's
an extramarital affair."
Confident of prevailing, majority Republicans
pressed for a committee vote by day's end on their pro

posal for an investigation based on Watergate rules and
unlimited in time or scope. A vote in the full House
would follow by Friday.
The Republicans' lead investigator. David Schippers,
broadened the counts set out bv Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr to raise the possibility that Clinton took
part in a broad conspiracy to cover up his actions.
Democrats countered the Republicans' proposed
resolution with an alternative to limit any inquiry to
matters arising from the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, and to render a verdict by Nov. 25. As
expected. Republicans turned that proposal back on a
strict party-line vote of 21-16.
Clinton himself did not mention the proceedings
unfolding 16 blocks away when he appeared briefly
before reporters on the White House grounds.
