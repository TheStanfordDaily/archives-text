Peer couseling training
must exist through
another class or department

Most students come to
Stanford eager not only to study
calculus and American history
but to learn practical and recreational skills.
These skills include topics as varied as
social dance, lifeguarding and badminton.
One of the most historically popular
skills-oriented classes was Psychology 193:
"Peer Counseling: Issues in Sexual Health
and Contraception." This class taught stu
dents about sexually transmitted diseases
and effective methods of contraception and
also served as the training program for
counselors at the student-run Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center.
We question the Psychology Depart
ment's decision to drop both the peer coun
seling class and the Peer Health Educator
training class. Psychology l l X): "Health Psy
chology and Campus ( ulture," as part of its
decision to discontinue its clinical track.
Administrators in the department have a
legitimate need to question the logic of
granting academic credit to students taking
a credit / no credit course aimed at teaching
an activity. The issue ol what universities
deem worthy of academic credit goes to the
heart of what distinguishes the best univer
sities. Students should not receive academ
ic credit for classes which do not have any
academic content nor require serious study.
While it is true that the peer counseling
class served mainly to train counselors for
the SHPRC, it also required intellectual
exploration and a thorough understanding
of issues surrounding sexual health.
Most students familiar with class agree
that it would be impossible to pass the
midterm and the final without attending
most classes and spending some time study
ing at home. Every student in the class was
also required to conduct an outreach pro
gram in which he or she took the material

from class and presented it to an outside
group such as a dormitory or athletic team.
Students were entirely responsible for
arranging their presentations, which served
as the key factor in determining their
grades.
T he class was also almost entirely taught
by student teaching assistants who invested
considerable time and effort in preparing
lectures, slides, videos and handouts. Stu
dent TAs received up to five units for teach
ing the class, in addition to gaining the valu
able experience of preparing lectures and
communicating important material.
While the Psychology Department has
the right to drop the peer counseling class,
we hope that another department will agree
to sponsor the class so that we can continue
to ensure that students learn about sexual
health and contraception issues. Further,
there must be a means to recruit and train
qualified counselors for the SPHRC.
Without departmental sponsorship, the
burden for continuing the class will fall on
students themselves. While dedicated stu
dents might continue the program initially,
the difficulty of finding a new set of stu
dents to teach the class without the motiva
tion of academic credit might threaten the
continued existence of the training pro
gram. raking away the academic status of
the program could also hurt the quality and
consistency of the training from year to
year.
One good option is to join the sexual
health counseling class with the peer coun
seling class for the Bridge in the School of
Education. The Bridge class trains coun
selors to handle the issues which arise when
students confront mental health crises.
The School of Education or Human
Biology Program could also agree to spon
sor the peer counseling class and continue
the teaching format which has made it so
successful in the past.
I lie peer counseling training program
must remain institutionalized if it is to con
tinue to generate good counselors. The
training program should not be allowed to
fall bv the wayside.
