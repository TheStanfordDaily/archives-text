Co-ops are successful
Friday's article about cooperative hous
ing suggested that cooperatives arc having
trouble attracting and keeping residents. As
a second-year resident and manager at Syn
ergy. I can assure you that wc are having no
such difficulties. In the spring '97 Draw,
Synergy drew 3 1 >1 for women, making it the
third most popular house on campus. Every
year many avid co-op supporters are unable
to draw into a co-op. This clear show of co
op support has made us think about starting
new co-ops, certainly not about ending
them.
ITie article also refercd to four people
who left Synergy in the middle of the year
because of problems with the time commit
ment. This is incorrect. Two people left to
study overseas, and the other two graduat
ed. In addition, neither of them was placed
in the house "by accident," and three of
them have since returned to cooperative liv
ing situations.
While cooperative living docs demand

commitment, all of our residents willingly
give their time, and the result is a strong and
supportive community that I would not give
up for anything.

In his column on Friday, Matthew Blu
menstein says that the Stanford Concert
Network needs to "earn its special fees"
and that "(he] can count the number of
concerts on campus over the last two years
on the fingers of one hand." Where was he
for David Spade, Beck, the Violent
Femmes, Cake, Rinc-A-Delt and numer
ous shows in White Plaza and the Coffee
House? Is he coming to the FREE Digital
Underground Homecoming show on
Thursday or the John Lee Hooker show on
Oct. 30?
It seems that Mr. Blumenstein wants to
complain about how campus bands don't

play enough, and then put the blame on us
because he is misinformed about the mis
sion of the Stanford Concert Network. The
SCN is not here to book bands for frat par
ties. We aim to bring high-quality acts to
campus at low prices (or for free) and give
students a chance to see big name acts
without going to San Francisco. We feel we
have done that well over the past two
years, and we have earned our special fee
by bringing to campus a variety of concerts
that cover a wide spectrum of entertain
ment including rock, rap. jazz and comedy.
We have also co-sponsored events with
other student organizations to bring cultur
al and ethnic music to campus.
Before any of us were on the staff of the
SCN. our organization lost its special fee,
making it more difficult to produce shows.
Nonetheless, we brought quality concerts
to campus, earned the respect of students
and music industry professionals and won
our special fee back.
Mr. Blumenstein. ask your friends at
other colleges about their student-run con

cert organizations. They don't have one as
good as ours. They either have one big
show a year, or their university rents out
facilities to outside promoters who do not
give students discount tickets. Other
schools do not have an organization run
solely by students for students that brings
shows to their campus throughout the
school year. We are the only college con
cert organization in the country that does
this.
Last year, the SCN received more appli
cations to be a part of our organization
than ever before, and our volunteer list
grows constantly. We think people want to
be a part of our group because we are
doing a good job and providing a service to
our campus. Maybe you disagree. Mr. Blu
menstein, but next time you want to point
the finger about the music scene at Stan
ford. get your facts straight.
