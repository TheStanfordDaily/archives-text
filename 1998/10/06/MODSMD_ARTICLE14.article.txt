## Going postal at the Post Office 
### 
HERE AT Stan
ford we're pretty
lucky. We have
great teachers, a great
campus, and even great
facilities — including our
very own post office.
But there's a problem

with our post office: It's slow. It's really
slow.
Some people won't like this. They'll say
I'm not grateful. I'm not being understand
ing. After all, slow is a relative term, and I
just need to be more patient. The post office
people try hard. Can I ever remember these
poor, overworked individuals not rushing to
get my mail as fast as humanly possible?
Well I've got an answer: Yes. Yes, I can.
First of all. slow is a relative term. But our
post office is even slow when compared to
evolution, glaciers, CIV (or IHUM, whatev
er the Hell that is) — you get the point.
And don't give me this crap about being
patient. If I pay to get a package delivered
in one to three days, I want it delivered in
one to three days. It's not like one of those,
"Yeah, one to three days would be cool"
things. It's not even like "Yeah, I know you
didn't mean to hit me in the groin, so I'm
not mad. but I'd really appreciate it if you
didn't do it again." I don't care how busy
they pretend to be. or what else they have to
do. Federal Express has no problem picking
up a package at 5 p.m. and delivering it
across the country by the next morning.
Come to think of it.the Pony Express could
too. So what makes our post office so
unique? Which law of physics slows down

time in 94309?
I think I may have the answer. It's not the
building, not the moon, not the alignment of
the stars. It's the employees. And I think a
good place to start is the package line.
If I was deaf, dumb, blind and had no
limbs I could still find packages faster than
that one guy at the pickup counter. I don't
care if they just throw everything together
in a giant pile — it still shouldn't take that
long. What the hell is he looking for?
Waldo? What could he be doing back
there? I heard a rumor that each employee
has to pound a beer in between packages
(which, by the way, would explain a lot), but
I have yet to see proof. I heard another
rumor about a guy running around with no
pants, but I'd rather not think about that.
Anyway, let's ignore this person. No
doubt a mere aberration. He's just the
exception, right?
Yeah, and I'm a Chinese fighter pilot.
That in no way explains the other guy. You
know the one. I once saw him filling the
stamp machine. He filled it all right —
stamp by stamp, repeating, "Yup, this is a
32-cent stamp." In the machine it went.
Next booklet: "Yup, this is a 32-cent
stamp." Well buddy, I've got a little secret
for you. If it's in the 32-cent stamp box, it's
going to be a 32-cent stamp booklet. For
Christ's sake, just pick them up and load the
damn machine!
Have I made my point? Not yet; let's
delve further into the world of postal
incompetence.
There's that one guy that looks straight
out of the "Golden Child" movie, which, in

my book at least, is pretty cool. But what's
up with him? I brought a package once and
asked him to mail it to New York. "How
about sending it to Australia?" he coun
tered with a weird grin. Yeah, really funny
mister. "No, New York's fine... thanks
though, I guess," I said. I mean a sense of
humor is good, but the joke was a lot less
funny when I found the package back in my
mailbox after a round-trip ticket to the land
down under.
Then there's that other guy. Now, I
understand that he's a post office worker
and that the uniform obviously attracts "the
chicks," but does he have to hit on every
single woman that comes to the counter ?
Now I'm not just trying to set one of
them off to the point of killing his co-work
ers, and I definitely am not trying to encour
age anyone to shoot me. And 1 would like
to still receive my mail after this is printed. I
like the fact that we have our own post
office on campus. I am grateful. But just
because I like it being there doesn't mean
I'm a cruel and unusual person to wonder
why it takes 15 minutes to find one box.
I can also tolerate some of their antics
because I would much rather they send my
packages to another country than send a
bullet through my skull. Everyone needs a
release. But maybe, just maybe, they could
figure out a new release that wouldn't take
so much of our time.
