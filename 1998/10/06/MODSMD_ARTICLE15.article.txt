# The

## Jim Tankersley Avoiding the traditional overseas column 
### 
I CAN HEAR the groans a continent
away. Not another Overseas Column.
Give us Res Ed-hashing or complaints
about Rohle Dining or weekly in-depth
analysis of ASSU meetings. Anything hut
another Daily reporter writing home from
abroad.
My sentiments exactly.
To use a decidedly American metaphor,
the Overseas Column is a beat-up truck —
windows cracked, fender rusting, but still
sputtering along at the hands of an owner
too loyal to trade it in. It is as much a Daily
institution as late deadlines and inside jokes
in the staff box. And I think maybe it's time
we overhauled it.
The problem is not that the Overseas
Column is pointless or poorly written. I
think that foreign correspondents have often
provided some of the best language and
insight in the Daily. Away from the United
States, thev dare to look at the world as

something other than billions of potential
Coke consumers. But because there have
been so many of them. Overseas Columns
have become a bit predictable.
In condensed form, your stereotypical
Overseas Column looks something like this:
"The thing about (pick one: Europe, Asia,
Africa, the Moon) is that it's really (big, old,
full of people who don't speak English). I've
been here for a few weeks, and already I'm
challenging my U.S.-centered views that
(military strength equals superiority, soccer is
boring, Baywatch is better without subtitles).
"I was walking to the subway
yesterday" — herein lies a four paragraph
digression on the lack of public transporta
tion in the United States — "when I had an
epiphany. It's time for the U.S. to wake up
and realize that the world speaks many lan
guages. but Americans insist on English. We
have to stop expecting the world to bow to
us wherever we go.

"So I'm making a bold pledge to start
learning Swedish and stop eating at the (pick
any city in the world) McDonald's. Which
reminds me: 1 saw this building yesterday,
and it totally made me think of (Hoover
Tower, Mem Chu, the Wilbur laundry
room). And I came to this conclusion: The
world is like Stanford. Only different. And
someday, we're all going to have to leave
Stanford.
"But I'll be ready. I'll know Swedish.
"Jim Tankersley, a junior majoring in
political science, complains that it is nearly
impossible to get 'real' football scores in
Scandinavia."
This is not a slam on former Overseas
Columnists. Actually, it greatly resembles
some of the columns I wrote from Idaho
(not overseas, but definitely foreign) two
summers ago. The reason many of these
columns sound the same is because a big
part of studying abroad is looking back

home through the prism of another culture.
The challenge is to relate that experience to
a Stanford audience, a gap not easily bridged
by memories of Green Library and musings
on life after graduation.
1 don't want to write a stereotypical
Overseas Column, but in my short time
abroad I have learned how difficult that can
be. I find myself wanting to write about
hitchhiking, riding trains across borders
and growing a beard. I want to examine cul
tural differences from all sides; to make fun
of the French for their twisted view of the
United States and make fun of myself for
the same thing. 1 want to complain about
the tiny amount of special sauce on a Nor
wegian Big Mac and the fact that Europe
has never heard of the Dave Matthews
Band.
Some of those things I will do. But I won't
write about anything that 1 can't justify as
beinn relevant to students at Stanford. I

want my Overseas Column to bring home
issues that concern people everywhere,
issues of politics, economics or simple
humanity.
That's easy to say, of course. To pull it off
you have to have a plan. Mine is to tell sto
ries. Sometimes they will be personal; most
times they will be observatory. Europe is
big, and old, and a lot of people here strug
gle with the same problems as Stanford stu
dents. Life in Europe, I think, can teach
Americans much about themselves and their
place in the world.
Which reminds me. 1 was walking to a
Metro station yesterday, and 1 noticed that
from the right viewpoint, the Champs-
Elysees looks a lot like Palm Drive.

Jim Tankersley's column will appear here
on Tuesdays. A junior majoring in political
science, he complains that it is nearly impos
sible to get "real" football scores in France.
