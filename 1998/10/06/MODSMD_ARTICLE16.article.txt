## Just a bit outside Brian Eule Homecoming dreams 
### 
While late nights, course read
ers and problem sets have helped
to create some unique dreams in
the past, this nightmare was cer
tainly a first for me.
Stanford's football team has
been struggling with one win and
four losses. And with Homecom
ing just around the corner, I
couldn't help but think about the
alumni returning to campus this
week.
As 1 drifted off to sleep last
night, 1 could only imagine the
scene in the alumni section at Stan
ford Stadium during this week's
battle for the basement of the Pa
cific 10 Conference between the
Cardinal and the Oregon State
Beavers...

The scene is a fuzzy one. (It's a
dream, remember?) A somewhat
rambunctious group sits in a
roped-off section of the bleachers
in Stanford Stadium, October 10,
1998. A vendor is heard selling
programs just outside the vicinity
and at the other side of the stadi
um, the faint sound of the march
ing band is heard from across the
field. Four seats in the front row of
the section remain empty as two
men converse in the row behind.
"Man, if my back wasn't killing
me. I'd get down there and play for
Stanford right now," one says to
the other. "You know, in all my
days here, I never made it to the
Rose Bowl. Didn't do too bad with
Denver, though, last year." He
chuckles to himself, and then ceas
es upon realizing the other is not
sharing in his laughter. "I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your name. I'm John.
John Elway."
" I'm Tiger Woods," the other
responds.
At this moment, four individu
als, dressed in long robes, walk
down the steps together and sit in
the open seats. They have attract
ed the attention of the two men,
who now sit silentlv for lack of any

thing else to say to each other.
"Well, 1 have been hearing that
this team has been struggling, and
I suppose it is time for them to
make a final appeal," the robed
man sitting in the middle of the
front row states. "Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and
Stephen Breyer. 1 am pleased that
you could all return to the Farm
with me today."
"Thank you, Mr. Chief Jus
tice," Kennedy responds. "I would
say that it is quite a pleasure, how
ever, it is very upsetting to see the
Cardinal miss so many tackles."
The sole woman among the
four replies. "I wish to dissent,"
O'Connor insists. "Oregon State
has yet to win a Pac-10 game and 1
have faith that we'll keep it that
way today."
"I'd like to concur with Justice
Kennedy," Breyer states. "This
team just isn't what it used to be
when I was a student here. I blame
that on more than just the lack of
tackling, however. This team con
sists of a young and inexperienced
squad. It is a rebuilding year."
"I'm Tiger Woods," the golfer
interrupts from the second row.
A man wearing a sweatband
and carrying an old wooden tennis
racket leans over from next to
Woods, and enters the conversa
tion.
"You wanna know what I
think?" he yells into the Supre
Court Justices' ears. "I think this
game is he adds as his
racket flies out of his hands and
lands on the field.
Breyer appears puzzled and
turns to O'Connor.
"Who is that?" he asks.
"That's John McEnroe," she
replies. "He's just a bit upset with
this year's team as well as the fact
that both of these teams are 0-2 in
conference."
"I'm Tiger Woods," the golfer
injects.
Utter chaos erupts in the alum
ni section. It appears as if everyone
is voicing an opinion, some more
violently than others, on the Cardi
nal's 1 -4 record.
Silently, a man with snow-col
ored hair and a red sweater walks
to the railing before the front row.
A slight smile begins to form on his


Brian
Eule
face, as he studies the bickering
going on in front of him.
"Excuse me, please," he says in a
calm voice that manages to grab the
attention of the entire section. "I'm
not a Stanford alumnus, nor do I be
long in this section, but I wanted to
turn your attention to something."
The four Supreme Court Justices ex
amine the man. His hands do not
shake and his lips do not quiver. The
distinguished guests know he will
not waste their time
"Playing a team like Oregon
State should serve as a time to land a
much needed conference victory,
and in that respect, this is more im
portant than any against a power
house such as Notre Dame," he
adds.

"Winning a Homecoming game,
in front of class alter class of Stan
ford graduates, can he a very special
thing for a student, and we must not
forget this. There is still the Big
Game to look forward to, and if the
momentum begins to roll now, we
still have a chance to keep the Axe."
The bickering is instantly re
placed by a hush in the section. Eyes
stare up in both awe and respect for
this elderly man.
"Who are you?" someone asks
from the second row.
" I once was a coach at this uni
versity," he replies. "My name is Bill
Walsh."
"What a coincidence," the person
replies. "I'm Tiger Woods."

Sports Editor Brian hide, whose
weekly columns appear on Tuesdays,
hopes the Stanford Alumni will still
speak to him someday.
