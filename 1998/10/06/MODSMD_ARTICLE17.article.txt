WOMEN'S SOCCER
â–  Yesterday: BYU 3, No. 13 Stanford 2. (Over
time).

B YU's Sara Reading scored the decisive goal in
overtime, giving the Cougars a 3-2 victory.
Coming off a 4-3 victory over Cal on Friday
night, the Cougars dominated the game with their
aggressive style of play. Despite Stanford's three
game winning streak. Cardinal head coach Steve
Swanson expected an aggressive match.
"We knew BYU was a good team," he said.
" They deserve a lot of credit, and have aggressive
front runners."
BYU, a fast and attacking team, refused to
allow the Cardinal to impose pressure from the
start of the game. Although both teams scored two
goals in the first half, the Cougars outshot Stanford
14-6 during this time period
Our players worked awfully hard" Swanson
said. "But they did not put any pressure on BYU
in the first half. We came back and bottled them up

in the second half."
Stanford's Shauna Itri, who was responsible for
both of the Cardinal's goals, echoed Swanson's
comments.
"In the first half, we played their game. We
didn't play as well as we could have, but we bat
tled," Itri stated.
BYU continued to dominate the second half as
well as the overtime period. The Cougars had sev
eral threatening chances during overtime including
a header which connected with the outside of the
goal. The Cougars finally attained the "Golden
Goal" when BYU'S Karen Robbins worked the
ball up the field to Sara Reading who scored the de

cisive goal.
Although the Stanford offense was unable to
establish its rhythm, the defense has remained con
sistent throughout the season. Goalkeeper Carly
Smolak, who was recently named the PacificlO
Conference's Player of the Week, recorded a sea
son high 11 saves.
Despite the loss, Stanford remains in a solid po
sition before Pac-10 competition begins this Fri
day. The Cardinal is currently ranked second, be
hind UCLA, in overall standings among Pac-10
teams.
