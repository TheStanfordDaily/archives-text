### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
Even though Stanford's championship men's
tennis team has lost three top players, it still hasn't
lost its edge. The Cardinal traveled to South
Bend, Ind. on Friday for its first match of year,
beating Notre Dame, 5-2.

MEN'S TENNIS
■ Friday: Stanford 5, Notre Dame 2

This meeting was the first of the two sehools
sinee the Cardinal defeated the Irish in thel992
NCAA championship match.
Despite the Stanford's defending NCAA
champion status, this season may be more chal
lenging than last year's record-breaking season.
Stanford suffered a tough loss this summer
with Paul Goldstein graduating and twin sensa

tions Bob and Mike Bryan leaving to try their luck
in the pros. All three players were ranked in the
top 25 in both singles and doubles last year, lead
ing the Cardinal to the 1998 NCAA champi
onships. Bob Bryan even garnered the triple
crown — winning the singles title and doubles
crown with brother Mike.
The Cardinal's golden year saw only three
match losses out of 170, never falling to another
team, during a dream season which some say will
never be matched again.
"No team is going to have the record we had
last year. And I don't mean no team this year. No
team before has ever had the season we had last
year and no team ever will again." Gould said.
Now the only top-25 ranked player left on
Stanford's team, senior Ryan Wolters is currently
ranked sixth in the preseason singles rankings.
But Stanford's strength lies also in its depth
and there has always been a strong support of
players behind the team's top stars.

In Friday's match against the Irish, Wolters
was matched against eighth-ranked Ail-Ameri
can Ryan Sachire at No. 1 singles. Sachire defeat-


All-American junior Ryan Wolters during
last year's NCAA Championship. Wolters
will be a crucial part of this year's team.
ed Wolters 6-2,6-3.
Cardinal junior Geoff Abrams,
who has played at fifth and sixth sin
gles for most of his Stanford career,
pulled through beautifully after
being thrust into the second singles

position. Abrams took Brian Patter
son down in straight sets, 6-2,6-3.
Third singles went just as smooth
ly for the Cardinal as sophomore
Alex Kim defeated Andy Warford,
6-4,6-1.
Freshman K.J. Hippensteel
kicked off his Stanford career with a
tight three-set match at the No. 4
spot against Notre Dame freshman

Casey Smith. Hippensteel eventual
ly cam 6 out on top with a 3-6,6-3,6-
4 score.
At the fifth spot, sophomore
Scotty Scott was forced to retire in
his second set against Matt Daly due
to cramps, giving Daly the forfeit.
Rounding out the singles action
was sophomore Ali Ansari, with a
three-set victorv against Andrew

Laflin, 6-3,6-7,6-3.
"I was very pleased with the way
we played," Gould said. "We played
an experienced team that has been
practicing for a month. We've only
had three days of practice and we
have three new players."
As for the season, Gould is very
optimistic despite the loss of his key
players.
