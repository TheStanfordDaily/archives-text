# A 						buzz in the air
## Stanford hosts the Hornets tonight 
### Will Flemming Stall writer 
Don't get stung.
That is exactly what the quickly
improving Stanford women's vol
leyball team is thinking heading
into tonight's match against the
Hornets of Sacramento State.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: N0.7 Stanford (10-2. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Sacra
mento State (10-6.5-1 Big Skv Con
ference). 7 p.m. RADIO: KZSU
(90.1 FM).

Although the Hornets figure to
be a relatively easy win for the
rolling Cardinal (10-2 overall. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference), which
scored two quick three-game victo
ries against the Washington
schools over the weekend, the last
thing Stanford can afford to do is
overlook Sacramento State (10-6,
5-1 Big Sky Conference).
"When you hear the name
Sacramento State, you don't think
of an athletic powerhouse," said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"In the volleyball world, howev
er, they arc a well respected pro
gram and we cannot afford to look
past them. If we don't give them
1 (X) percent of our attention, they'll
give us all kinds of problems,"
Shaw added.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the

Cardinal will he without the ser
vices of junior outside hitter Kerri
Walsh.
The two-time All American ag
gravated her season-long shoulder
injury against Washington State
last Friday, and soreness kept her
from taking full swings against
Washington on Sunday.
Although Walsh was still an ef
fective hitter against the Huskies,
racking up 10 kills and no hitting
errors, Shaw sees no need to risk
further injury tonight.
Walsh will visit the doctor dur
ing the day and gain some invalu
able rest during this non-confer
ence match.
The good news for the Cardinal,
however, is that several of its
younger and less experienced play
ers showed great improvement
over the weekend and appeared
readv to step up and take some of
the offensive load off Walsh's
shoulder.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Detmer has proven to be a
powerful weapon at the net for the
Cardinal, as the former Pac-10
Player of the Week leads the team
in both kills and blocks. The 6-foot
-3 phenom will look to exploit the
small Hornet defense and put up
some big numbers to compensate
for Walsh's absence.
Detmer returns, this year, after
;i freshman season in which she was
named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman
team. Now. she will have to contin
ue performing well as a sopho
more, against the Hornets.
"Sacramento State is not a real
big team," Shaw said. "They are
more of a hall control team, and
have good passing ability."
Stanford will look to its healthy
outside hitters to fill Walsh's slot
on the right side of the offense.
Freshman Michelle Chambers
is ;i prime contender to carry the
right side, considering her seven
kill performance against Washing
ton.
Against the Huskies, last week.
Chambers saw some time at the
right outside hitter position.
Starting left outside hitter Sarah
Clark will also be expected to con
tinue her solid play and step up her
production. The junior was a big
contributor at the net for the Car
dinal over the weekend and is be
coming a major front row weapon.
Although the greatest attention

is paid to her hitting statistics,
Walsh's absence will be felt in all
areas of the game. Walsh serves as
the number two setter and displays
amazing passing ability on the ser
vice receive.
"Even if she isn't hitting at 1(X)
percent, it is difficult to justify not
having Kerri out on the floor,"
Shaw said.
"She is valuable in so many
other areas of the game. She often
sets up our offense out of the back
row with her passing and as our
second setter, so even when she
isn't swinging at full speed, she can
still have a powerful impact on a
game," he added.
Shaw will look to junior outside
hitter Jaimi Gregory and senior de
fensive specialist Sarah Neal to
pick up the slack on the receive and
to use their age and experience to
guide the young Stanford team to
victory against Sacramento State.
The Cardinal has defeated the
Hornets in both of the previous
two meetings between the schools.
Following tonight's match, the
Cardinal will host California on
Friday, at Maples Pavilion, and
have Sunday off.
