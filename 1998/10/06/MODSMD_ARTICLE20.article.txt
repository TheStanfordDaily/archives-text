## Stanford hosts the Hornets tonight 
### Will Flemming Stall writer 
Don't get stung.
That is exactly what the quickly
improving Stanford women's vol
leyball team is thinking heading
into tonight's match against the
Hornets of Sacramento State.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
â–  Tonight: N0.7 Stanford (10-2. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Sacra
mento State (10-6.5-1 Big Skv Con
ference). 7 p.m. RADIO: KZSU
(90.1 FM).

Although the Hornets figure to
be a relatively easy win for the
rolling Cardinal (10-2 overall. 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference), which
scored two quick three-game victo
ries against the Washington
schools over the weekend, the last
thing Stanford can afford to do is
overlook Sacramento State (10-6,
5-1 Big Sky Conference).
"When you hear the name
Sacramento State, you don't think
of an athletic powerhouse," said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"In the volleyball world, howev
er, they arc a well respected pro
gram and we cannot afford to look
past them. If we don't give them
1 (X) percent of our attention, they'll
give us all kinds of problems,"
Shaw added.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the

Cardinal will he without the ser
vices of junior outside hitter Kerri
Walsh.
The two-time All American ag
gravated her season-long shoulder
injury against Washington State
last Friday, and soreness kept her
from taking full swings against
Washington on Sunday.
Although Walsh was still an ef
fective hitter against the Huskies,
racking up 10 kills and no hitting
errors, Shaw sees no need to risk
further injury tonight.
Walsh will visit the doctor dur
ing the day and gain some invalu
able rest during this non-confer
ence match.
The good news for the Cardinal,
however, is that several of its
younger and less experienced play
ers showed great improvement
over the weekend and appeared
readv to step up and take some of
the offensive load off Walsh's
shoulder.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Detmer has proven to be a
powerful weapon at the net for the
Cardinal, as the former Pac-10
Player of the Week leads the team
in both kills and blocks. The 6-foot
-3 phenom will look to exploit the
small Hornet defense and put up
some big numbers to compensate
for Walsh's absence.
Detmer returns, this year, after
