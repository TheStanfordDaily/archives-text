The target — a small hole in the
middle of lush, green grass. The ob
ject — an even smaller, solid white
ball. The outlook — as bright as the
sun glinting off the shiny metal of a

Stanford's women's golf team is
beginning another season. That is,
it's trying to begin another season.
The first round of the No. 7 Car
dinal's season opening tournament,
the Bama Fall Preview in Tulsa,
Okla., was canceled due to rain.
The seven members making up
the team, all of whom are returning
players, are looking toward making
a strong run this season.
"We had a great fall [quarter]
last year, but didn't finish strongly,"
said junior Julie Dunn. "This year
we want to have a good start and
continue to play well."
Sophomore Hilary Homeyer
agreed. "I was really pleased with
our play during last year's fall quar
ter and hope to continue it through

out this year."
Last year, the team finished third
in the West Region Conference,
qualified for the NCAA champi
onship tournament and placed
ninth once there.

The team is lead by coach Caro
line O'Connor, who was named
head coach at the start of the 1996-
97 season. That season, O'Connor
guided the women's team to a third
-place regional finish and a fourth
place NCAA finish.
O'Connor says that the Cardinal
can expect to see more variation in
the lineup this season. All seven
team members have improved
greatly over the summer, some
working with new coaches while

others just benefited from three
months of intense practice on their
own. All this will most likely result
in five different qualifiers from the
team for each tournament.
O'Connor feels that the addi
tional experience of some of the
golfers, as well as their added confi
dence from playing together as a
team for a year, has brought togeth
er the team.
The team agrees with its coach.
"We have a good team with a
strong talent level without making
any physical improvements be
cause everyone on the team is a vet
eran," Homeyersaid.
Homeyer received Ail-Ameri
can honorable mention honors last
year while fellow sophomore
Stephanie Keever was named to the
All-American second team.
In addition to the Homeyer,
Keever. Dunn and Ro, sophomores
