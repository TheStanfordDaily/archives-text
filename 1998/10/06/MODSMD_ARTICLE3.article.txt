# Mural stolen from Okada
## 
### Kelly Young Senior staff writer 
One of the two large Okada
murals, with an estimated value of
$ 1.5(H), was stolen late Thursday
night.
"No one was seen taking it,"
said Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington. "There are no known
suspects .... We're asking for any
assistance we can get."
The painting, a textured geo
metrical abstract of a blue back
ground with a yellow circle inset
with a white circle, had been hang
ing on the second-floor landing of
the dormitory's stairwell since
19%.
It was on loan from Kevin Yee,
the artist, who was an ethnic
theme associate in Okada last
year.
"It was designed monochrome
and in two dimensions, but it was
painted in color with three-dimen
sional attributes," said Yee, Class
of '98. He "wanted to show diver
sity in Asian-American artwork.
"I hope they get it back." Yee
said. "It was several hundred
hours work."
Senior Kalpana Kotagal,
Okada's ethnic theme associate,
said she remembered seeing the
mural Thursday at about 11 p.m.
Another resident noticed its ab
sence around 1 a.m. Friday, ac
cording to the police report. Her
rington estimated that it was taken
sometime around midnight.

"Most of the dorm was out
playing Capture the Flag," Kota
gal said, "so very few people were
around."
The painting was not attached
to the wall, making it easier to
steal. A board nailed to the wall
supported the mural, which mea
sured about five feet by eight feet
by two inches. Kotagal said that
based on the mural's size and
weight, it probably would have
taken two people to carry the
painting out of the dormitory.
Okada's staff thought someone
may have been hiding it as a prank,
but when it didn't turn up Friday
or Saturday, Kotagal reported the
theft to Stanford Police.
Kotagal said the doors were
locked at the time, and the doors
have remained locked since the in
cident.
"It's frustrating for us because
first, the artist put a lot of time and
effort into it, and second, we don't
understand what the purpose was.
It's not a very good prank," she
said.
Herrington said that the theft
of dorm property makes this case
unusual.
"This is something that's pretty
rare," he said. "If we lose things,
they tend to be personal property.
I'm hoping this is just somebody's
idea of a joke."
Nothing else was reported
missing from Okada.
