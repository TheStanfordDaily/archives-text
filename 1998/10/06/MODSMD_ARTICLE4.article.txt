# Quartet arrives on Farm

Stanford's Music Department has
gained not just one artist-in-residenee but
four, as the St. Lawrence String Quartet
joined the department as ensemble-in
residence to start a chamber music pro
gram.
Stanford's music program, while it has
had student and faculty string quartets
and other musical ensembles for years,
has not had a regular artist-in-residence
position until now. The internationally
acclaimed quartet, experienced in both
contemporary and classical compositions,
will coach students as they initiate a new
program in chamber music. The group
will also perform regularly on campus.
"They have an intellectual under
standing of what they are performing,"
said Music Department ("hair Stephen
Hinton. "Yet their performances are full
blooded — they can play early pieces
[from 250 years ago] as they were meant

to be played then, and they can play the
very latest pieces."
The group, which played in Campbell
Recital Hall last Wednesday during
lunchtime before a capacity crowd, ex
hibits its talent again tomorrow at <S p.m.
in the Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets
are $6.
The foursome was chosen for its wide
repertoire and dynamism. "The electrici
ty factor sets them apart — their work is
stunningly exciting and beautiful," said
Assoc. Music Prof. Jonathan Berger. who
chaired the search committee. "Their
repertoire is enormously broad — they
have interests in every angle of music and
generate passion and excitement. We're
thrilled about them."
The ensemble, which is still spending
much of its time performing on the road,
will be fully installed on campus by next
fall. Their performance schedule, accord
ing to Berger, is such that they can only
work on campus in small chunks of time

this academic year.
The role the group will play in con
structing a chamber music program has
not solidified yet.
"The quarter has just begun, so they
have just started to put their ideas into
practice. I don't know exactly what their
plans are, but they have swung straight
into action," said Keith Chapin, a doctor
al student in musicology who plays the
viola. "They'll be coming in for certain
periods this year to offer coaching and
master classes, and their teaching pat
terns will be more permanent next year.
"At this stage, they are just beginning,
but they have a wonderful opportunity to
mold and enhance the program. Every
one seems to be looking forward to work
ing with the quartet," Chapin said.
According to Hinton, the four would
like to start a program similar to Stan
ford's 25-year-old summer jazz work-
shop, where music students will
focus on chamber music.
The group was chosen from an
initial pool of 86 applicants. Hinton
emphasized that this figure does not
indicate the total number of individ
uals, but groups of varying sizes.
"We weren't particularly seek
ing a string quartet so much as a
group that would answer our needs
by exhibiting diversity. In their au
dition they played both
Tchaikovsky and a selection com
posed by a [Stanford] student. To
them, music is music. They have
very positive and well defined
plans of how they would like to see
the chamber music program devel
op," Berger said.
The St. Lawrence foursome will
benefit the department in ways be
yond coaching chamber music and
adding clout. "Their presence will

benefit our composition program,"
Hinton said. "They often work
with living composers, which is in
valuable to a composer because it
helps them learn about their piece
from the performers' perspective."
Berger said that he is ecstatic. "I
know they will be wonderful col
leagues. It is a very happy moment
for the department."
The St. Lawrence String quartet
has been together since 1989. The
members of the group are first vio
linist Geoff Nuttall, second violin
ist Barry Shiffman, violist Lesley
Robertson and cellist Marina
Hoover.
The many honors they have gar
nered include being appointed
graduate string-quartet-in-resi
dence at the Juilliard School and
winning the Fourth Banff Interna
tional String Quartet Competition.
They have played Washington,
D.C.'s Kennedy Center and the
Paris Opera.
