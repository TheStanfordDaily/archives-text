## Students recall growing up on campus 
### Valerie Crowell 
Imagine trying to park your tricy
cle on a campus hike rack, learning to
drive on May field Avenue or having
your first kiss in the hack of Memori
al Auditorium. Students who grew
up on the Stanford campus are sur
rounded hv memories. And when
college came around, some of them
packed up their things and moved
down Campus Drive to their dormi
tories.
Elizabeth Weisherg. a junior ma
joring in music, was born while her
family was living in Eseondido Vil
lage. At the time, her father. Law
Prof. Robert Weisherg. was a student
at Stanford Law School. After a two
year interlude off campus, the family

moved back to campus and for four
years (Weisberg's sixth to ninth
grade) were Resident Fellows in
Murray House, now called Ameri
can Studies.
"When 1 was an RF kid it seemed
like college was so much fun," Weis
berg said. "I'd often hang out in the
lounge and watch movies with stu
dents. I didn't realiy understand the
meaning of schoolwork. because
there were a lot of students who were
always watching IV. But I looked up
to the students."

ence major, moved to campus in Sep

was quiet, he said, and most of his

Ben Hurlbut, a junior classics
major and son of human biology lec
turer William Hurlbut, attended lec

ternoons spent trying to pick Stan

on campus and busting into frat par
ties at night.
Most "ghetto kids" report that
they admired Stanford students and
appreciated their advice and com
panionship. (Catherine Orr, a junior
majoring in human biology and
daughter of Dean of Earth Sciences
Franklin ( )it. was happy to have peo
ple to play with. And Jack Rakove's
frosh advisees taught Rob various
tricks in the Nintendo game Super
Mario Brothers.

in Woodside all his life, had known
for a long time that he wanted to at

time came around, he applied early
decision and had no regrets.
Amount of dirty laundry is a key
determinant in how often he returns
home.
Orr echoed Hurlbut's laundry
sentiments, but said one drawback is
that "I don't feel like I'm going away
to school."
But after looking at East Coast
schcx)ls, she realized that she was
"looking for a Stanford somewhere
else." Other students agreed that it is
hard to turn Stanford down.
Rakove and Hans Andersen V,
undeclared sophomore and son of

Assoc. Dean for Natural Sciences
Hans Andersen IV, love the conve
nience of being able to return home
for a forgotten personal belonging or
a home-cooked meal. Andersen's life
as a Stanford student revolves around
his friends and dorm, like most other
students.
"It's almost like a whole separate
world once you cross Stanford Av
enue," Andersen said.

Rakove runs into his father quite fre
quently, whereas Orr rarely sees her
father without planning ahead. Hurl

father, while Orr and Andersen pre

demic and family life.
Prof. Jack Rakove said that he did
not experience much "empty nest
syndrome" since he sees his son so
often. Although he believes that
going away for college can be posi
tive. he also recognized the benefits
of attending Stanford. "I also came to
realize that Rob would have the ad
vantage of knowing the faculty and
not being shy about consulting them,
in the way that undergraduates often
are." he said.
All the students agreed that close
contact with other faculty members

and their children reduced the intim

office hours than your average frosh.

imposing intellectual figures for the
first time," Rob Rakove said.
All in all, "ghetto kids" were just
as surprised as the rest of us about
what being a student at Stanford is re
ally like. Rakove's status, however,
may have clued him in to some of
Stanford's rules and regulations be
fore other new frosh.
"For the record," he said, "I never
skateboarded on campus."
