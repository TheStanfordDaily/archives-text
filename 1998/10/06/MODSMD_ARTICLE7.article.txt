# Greeks sponsor date rape presentation
## 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
"l had made just as many plans as
you when I started college," began
Katie Koestner, "but I'm here
tonight to say that absolutely none of
them worked out."
Koestner, a victim of date rape
during her freshman year at William
and Mary in the late 1980s, and
Brent Sokolow, her classmate and fi
ance, spoke in front of about 3()0 stu
dents last night at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium in a effort to raise awareness
of sexual assault. The event was co

sponsored by the Intersorority and
Interfraternity Councils.
"We're trying to raise the issues
to the community and increase
awareness of sexual assault," said
Melissa Chud, a senior and ISC Pres
ident. "It's a pertinent issue for all
college students."
The event included two seg
ments: Koestner's story followed by
an interactive discussion led by
Sokolow that posed two scenarios of
possible date rape and involved the
audience as the jury.
Koestner's testimony included a
detailed description of her relation

ship with the assailant, a fellow stu
dent, as well as a description of the
mild consequences he faced at the
hands of their college's judicial sys
tem.
"I would say I was uncomfort
able, nervous, and at 18,1 would not
have called myself assertive. And I
probably was naive, if the definition
of naive is that you really like some
one, you can be alone in the room
with them, and not have sex," Koest
ner said.
Koestner also shared some star
tling statistics, including that one in
four women and one in eight men
will be raped in his or her lifetime,
according to the program's defini
tion. She stressed the importance of
immediately receiving a physical
exam, known as a rape kit, since evi
dence is no longer present or valid
after 72 hours.
In her speech, Koestner was also
insistent on the potential for sexual
assault even at suburban campuses
such as Stanford. "Rape happens on
a college campus every 21 hours,"
she said.
"I was really impressed with the
enthusiasm," said Mike Martinez, a
senior and IFC President. "The stu
dents really got involved with the
scenarios."
One issue of concern voiced by
the speakers and several audience
members was the disproportionate
ratio of men to women in the audi

ence. Attendance was mandated for
members of ISC sororities but not
for fraternity members.
About 70 men were present.
"It wasn't because we thought it
wasn't important. It wasn't our poli
cy to fine if IFC members didn't at
tend. We strongly encouraged our
members to attend, and a large num
ber of the men in my house were
here," said Matt Koiden, a junior
and IFC vice president for commu
nication.
In related news, the Take Back
the Night rally, originally planned
for Thursday night, has been
rescheduled for Oct. 22 due to over
lapping interest in the Digital Un
derground concert planned for the
same night.
Take Back the Night is an event
held on college campuses across the
country at which men and women
protest sexual assault.
"We didn't want it to conflict with
another event on campus," said
Marian Hammond, a senior and co
ordinator of the event. "We definite
ly wanted to have it in the fall be
cause fall of freshman year is the
time when students are most vulner
able to sexual assault."
Sokolow also emphasized the
need for men's input on the subject.
"If I asked, most of the men in the
room would say that they are anti
rape. It's not enough to be anti-rape.
You have to do anti-rape," he said.
