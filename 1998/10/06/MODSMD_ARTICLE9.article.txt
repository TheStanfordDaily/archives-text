Joint Chiefs unaware of bombing
WASHINGTON (AP) — Most members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff were unaware of the planning
for the Aug. 20 cruise missile strike on suspected ter
rorist strongholds in Afghanistan and Sudan until
days before the weapons were launched, defense
officials confirmed Monday.
The Pentagon defended its highly secretive and
compartmented approach to the raid as appropriate
to the sensitivity of the mission and in conformance
with the military chain of command. Last-minute
recommendations by the service chiefs resulted in
one proposed target being deleted as too risky. And
after the raid, service chiefs voiced no objections to
the short notice they received, said senior defense
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
