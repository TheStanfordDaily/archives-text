# Okada gets mural back
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
The mural stolen from Okada House late Thurs
day was returned yesterday by a group of freshman
pranksters, who accidentally targeted the wrong
dorm.
"All I know is that I got a call a little before 5
p.m. from the residence dean saying to come pick it
up," said senior Ameeta Patel, a resident assistant
in Okada.

'Atypical freshman mistake'
â€”Andy Hernandez

Andy Hernandez, residence dean for Wilbur
and Stern, said that the mural was taken by a group
of freshmen who thought that they were in a rival
freshman dorm.
"Their intentions weren't to commit a crime,"
Hernandez said. "It was part of a rivalry with an
other frosh house."
Hernandez said the students were targeting an
other dorm when they came into Okada and stum
bled upon the unbolted mural. Most of the dorm
residents were out playing Capture the Flag, and
Okada was largely deserted.
Seizing the opportunity, the students ran off with">
the mural, not knowing that they had raided the
wrong dorm.
"That mural was the only one that wasn't bolted
down, so they took it," Patel said. She said the dorm
will probably bolt the mural down
after this incident.
"The thing is solved and Okada
house is happy to have [the mural]
back," Hernandez said. "The stu
dents who took it were remorse
ful."
Hernandez cited the incident as
a "typical freshman mistake," say
ing that the students did not realize
that what they had done would de
velop into an important matter.
Senior Adeh DeSandies, an
other resident assistant in Okada,
said the house was not going to
press charges. "We got it back and
there's nothing really to say about
it. It's not a big deal," he said.
The mural is on loan from its
artist, Kevin Yee, who was an
Okada theme associate last year.
Yee, Class of '98, painted the
mural as a display of diversity in
Asian-American artwork.
The painting measures about
five feet by eight feet. It is a tex
tured abstract of a yellow circle
inset with a white circle on a blue
background.
