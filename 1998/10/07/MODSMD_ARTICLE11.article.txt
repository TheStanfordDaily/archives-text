## House inquiry vote looms 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With a House vote set for
Thursday on launching an open-ended impeachment
inquiry. Democrats rushed to counter Republican
plans while still underscoring their disapproval of Pres
ident Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart
accused the GOP leadership of using the impeachment
issue "to embarrass the president" and produce politi
cal gain for Republicans at the polls this fall.
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the
issue would come to the floor for a vote on Thursday.
Republican officials expressed confidence they would
prevail, thus making Clinton the third president in his
tory to face possible impeachment proceedings.
"The fact of the matter is, it is about obstruction of
justice. It is about lying to the American people,"
Armey told reporters Tuesday. "It is about using all the
instruments, and many of the people in the White
House... to go out and tell a story that the president
himself knew to be untrue."
The GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee
approved a sweeping impeachment inquiry in a party
line vote on Monday, after first brushing aside two
Democratic alternatives.
Leaders are likely to redraft a plan that was offered
in the Judiciary Committee on Monday that would
have limited the scope of the inquiry to the Lewinsky
affair, and called for it to be concluded by Nov. 25. A
second proposal, authored by Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif., would have required the committee to first
decide whether Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's

allegations, if proven, would constitute impeachable
offenses. If so, the Judiciary Committee would then be
empowered to investigate with unlimited time.
Party sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Democratic rank-and-file group remains divid
ed, however. Some liberal lawmakers from safe seats
favor no inquiry on grounds that Clinton's offenses
don't rise to the level of impeachment. But others,
including moderates who face difficult election battles,
are likely to vote for the GOP measure, officials said.
The White House would like all Democrats to vote
against the Republican plan, officials said, to buttress
the claim that the GOP is pushing a partisan impeach
ment probe. But House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt's objective is somewhat different, officials
said, and is to ensure the re-election of as many
Democrats as possible this fall.
White House officials — concerned with the presi
dent's fate — have circulated polling in recent days sug
gesting that Democrats will fare best nationally in the
elections if they oppose the GOP measure. They say
Republicans are vulnerable to election-year criticism
that they want to open the way to a prolonged investi
gation at a time when the public favors a swift end to
the impeachment drama.
Republican polling has detected a change, as well,
according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity. A survey taken recently for the Republican
National Committee reported an increase in the num
ber of Democrats intending to vote compared with a
few weeks ago, although it still lags behind Republicans.
