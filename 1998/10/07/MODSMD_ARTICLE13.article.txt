# Leaders warn Milosevic of intervention

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — Moving
closer to NATO airstrikes, the United States told
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tues
day that he has failed to show the West he really
means to end his harsh crackdown in Kosovo
province.
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met Milosevic
for the second day Tuesday after visiting the
southern Serbian province, where Yugoslav
forces were battling ethnic Albanian rebels seek
ing independence.
In Washington, President Clinton said Hol
brooke was telling the Yugoslav leader that
NATO is prepared to act if Milosevic fails to
honor U.N. resolutions ordering him to with
draw from areas of conflict and allow a political
settlement.
He warned that, unchecked, Serb violence in
the province could lead to instability throughout
the region.
"The stakes are high," Clinton said. "The time
is now to end the violence in Kosovo."
After meeting with ethnic Albanian political
leaders in Kosovo, Holbrooke said Serbian secu
rity forces still maintain a strong presence.
"U.S. diplomatic observers are doing a terrif
ic job bringing us information, and the informa
tion they're bringing is not good," Holbrooke
said.
Milosevic's seven-month crackdown against
the secessionists has killed hundreds, left tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians homeless and led
to growing resolve among NATO allies to stop

the bloodshed by striking Yugoslav army targets
if necessary.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. But ethnic Albanians
form 90 percent of the 2 million-strong Kosovo
population, and most favor self-rule.
Hours after Holbrooke left Kosovo for Bel
grade, reporters saw about 100 Yugoslav military
vehicles of all sorts — ranging from armored per
sonnel carriers to trucks loaded with troops —
moving outside Kosovo in an apparent show of
Milosevic's compliance with international
demands.
Additionally, state-run Serbian TV claimed
that all Serbian special police units were pulled
out of the province — a key international
demand.
Defense Secretary William Cohen told
Congress a pullback of troops in Kosovo by
Milosevic was not enough to ward off NATO
attacks. Airstrikes might be followed by some
"international presence" on the ground, he said.
If more Serb forces don't pull out of the
province, NATO intervention "will become
inevitable," French President Jacques Chirac
said.
However, Yugoslav government spokesman
Miodrag Popovic told Associated Press Televi
sion News that the complete withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops from Kosovo is out of question.
"Who in the right mind would do so? Is there
a country in the world that would do so, espe
cially with an armed rebellion on their hands?"

Popovic asked.
Milosevic told Holbrooke in talks Monday
night that his government is willing to seek a
"political solution" to the crisis. But he also
called the NATO threats against his country "a
criminal act."
Holbrooke, who negotiated the IWS agree
ment that ended the Bosnian war. was dis
patched to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade in
what appeared to he a last-chance diplomatic
effort.
NATO officials say they are ready to launch
airstrikes. No decision is expected until Thurs
day. when NATO ambassadors meet in Brussels.
The United States is trying to get Milosevic
and the ethnic Albanians to agree on a deal that
would defer for two or three years a decision on
whether Kosovo would separate from Serbia.
But the ethnic Albanians have refused lo negoti
ate with Milosevic, and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright voiced skepticism Milosevic
would adhere to any such plan.
"We are dealing with someone we never
trusted," Albright said en route from Washing
ton to Jerusalem, where she was on a Mideast
peace initiative.
The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, whose
attacks on Serb police prompted the crackdown,
has rejected any peace formula short of lull inde
pendence. The KLA has urged NATO to attack.
"The Serbian war machine and iis military and
political structure must be destroyed." said Adem
Demaci. a politician who speaks for the rebels.

The White House and NATO have warned that military intervention
could begin in a matter of days unless Serbian troops stop attack
ing ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
