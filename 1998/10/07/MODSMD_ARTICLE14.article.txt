# Downed Israeli jet carried sarin precursor
##

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands
(AP) — In the shadow of towering
apartment buildings, a living mon
ument to vietims of the worst
Dutch air disaster bears this
inscription: "The Tree That Saw
Everything."
Six years later, investigators are
struggling to uncover what no one
can see — the cause of chronic ill
nesses that have plagued the
neighborhood and its rescuers
since the crash of an Israeli cargo
jet-
New disclosures the plane was
carrying a chemical that can be
used to produce the deadly nerve
gas sarin have reignited demands
for the truth — and renewed spec
ulation over what the Israelis
intended to do with the material.
"Once and for all, we must put
an end to the disaster. The suffer
ing has lasted too long," Hannah
Belliot, who heads the neighbor
hood council, said Sunday in a
memorial service near trees that
survived the inferno.
Forty-three people were killed
on Oct. 4, 1992, when the Israel
bound Boeing 747 cargo jet lost its
two right engines and smashed
into a 12-story apartment block
shortly after takeoff from Amster
dam's Schiphol Airport.
While the cause of the crash
was determined to be a design

flaw, its cargo has been a nagging
mystery to the scores of residents
and rescue workers suffering from
chronic health problems.
Last week, the Israeli govern
ment confirmed what many had
suspected after years of official
denials: The plane was carrying
dangerous cargo.
Up to 50 gallons of dimethyl
methylphosphonate, an ingredient
used in sarin, many pesticides and
in anti-retardants were destined
for the Israel Institute for Biologi
cal Research in suburban Tel
Aviv, the Israelis disclosed.
Recent reports have said Israel
was making chemical and biologi
cal weapons at the institute; the
Israeli government has not com
mented on those claims. The
Dutch government, meanwhile,
has promised a fresh parliamen
tary probe.
Those suffering from health
problems say knowing exactly
what was in the belly of the jet is
their only hope for recovery.
"I can't get it out of my mind,"
said ambulance driver Henk Post,
48, a paramedic dispatched to the
crash site in the low-income, heav
ily immigrant Bijlmer neighbor
hood.
Post arrived within minutes of
the early evening crash and
worked until the next morning —

all while wearing no special pro
tective gear. Three years later, he
began suffering health problems,
including chronic fatigue and mus
cle aches. He also weeps easily and
suffers bouts of depression.
"He's so emotional," said
Post's 22-year-old daughter, Bian
ca. "He's different. He's not my
father anymore."
Post said doctors are at a loss
over how to treat him.
He's not alone. Doctors in
Bijlmer say some 3(X) people have
suffered health problems since the
crash, including nervousness,
stress, chronic fatigue, pain and
drowsiness.
"My whole body is a mess.
There are all kinds of weird things
going on," said Ed Steur, 48, an
auto mechanic who helped evacu
ate the area and now suffers from
bronchial problems and muscle
pains "so bad that I can't do any
thing anymore."
Steur is angry at the Israeli and
Dutch governments for keeping
the plane's cargo a secret. Over
the years, officials have said the
plane carried a small amount of
military equipment; one newspa
per report said it was carrying
Sidewinder missiles.
Earlier this year, Israel's
ambassador to the Netherlands,
Yossi Gal, told reporters the plane

carried "no dangerous
goods ... nothing secret."
Dutch officials bristle at allega
tions of a coverup.
"I don't believe ... that some
thing was wittingly and knowingly
withheld," Transport Minister
Tineke Netelenbos told the daily
De Telegraaf. "What is important
is that we establish quickly which
materials were burned, at what
temperature, and what conse
quences they have on public
health."
There have been conflicting
reports on whether the chemical
by itself is poisonous. But in any
case, experts say long-term expo
sure to a much higher dose of the
chemical than was aboard the
plane would be necessary to pro
duce illnesses.
"People think since it can be
used for sarin, it must have the
same toxicity as sarin. That's non
sense," said Hendrik Benshcop,
head of chemical toxicology at the
Netherlands Organization for
Applied Science Research.
If so, the mystery just deepens
for Everdina Douwes, who was
diagnosed with lung cancer three
years after the crash.
"I don't expect any (compensa
tion) money from the govern
ment," she said. "It's the truth that
needs to come out."
