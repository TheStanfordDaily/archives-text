# Blacks, women, poor get fewer kidneys
## Transplant inequities 
### 
CHICAGO (A P) — Blacks,
women and poor people with kid
ney failure are much less likely to
complete the preliminary steps
required to get an organ transplant,
a study found.
A consumer advocacy group
called the study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical
Association proof that the U.S.
health care system discriminates.
But the researchers suggested
other possibilities, including a lack
of interest in getting a transplant
and fear of losing Medicare cover
age.
It has long been known that the
three groups are underrepresented
among kidney transplant recipients.
Efforts to change that have focused
on trying to increase organ dona
tion or alter the way donor organs
are allocated.
"All that will only help people
already on the waiting list." said Dr.
Ashwini R. Sehgal, coauthor of the
study and a kidney specialist at
Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland. "We wanted to see
what happens before patients get to
the waiting list."
The authors studied 7.125 kid
ney-dialysis patients between 1993
and 19% in Indiana. Kentucky and
Ohio. The patients were examined
through four steps leading to a
transplant: being interested and
medically suitable; seeking a trans
plant; completing pre-operation

work and getting referred to the
waiting list: and moving up the list.
Blacks were 32 percent to 50
percent less likely than whites to
complete the lasl three steps. Poor
patients were 22 percent to 33 per
cent less likely than the rich to com
plete the first three steps, though
those who did were just as likely to
receive transplants. And women
were up to 12 percent less likely
than men to complete all four steps.
The authors did not look at why
these patients didn't complete the
process.
But Sehgal said possibilities
include a lack of a standard ranking
system in the transplant network,
patients who may not want a trans
plant and people who worry about
Medicare rules that could stop their
coverage after three years.
Some patients also may be more
likely to have medical conditions
like acute high blood pressure that
need to be treated before a trans
plant can be done, or illnesses such
as severe heart disease that would
make them unsuitable.
Public ( iti/cn. a consumer advo
cacy group, said bias is to blame
and suggested using case managers
to help blacks, women and poor
people navigate the medical sys
tem.
"This study exposes just how dis
criminatory the U.S health care
system can be." said Public C iti
zen's Dr. Peter Lurie.
