Approach to student time
study should avoid claiming
to capture a typical day

THE RECENTLY commissioned
study by the Dean of Students
Office on how 500 undergraduates
spend their time could end up raising more
questions than it offers conclusions.
We hope that the results of the study will
not be used inappropriately to give the
impression that the student body has cer
tain defining characteristics, determined by
how many hours a few students study,
party, exercise or perform community ser
vice. As even the Dean of Students has
noted, there is no such thing as a typical day
in the life of a Stanford student. This is
because there is no such thing as a typical
Stanford student.
It is easy to see how such a study might
be used as fodder for bragging rights, giving
a false impression of what life at Stanford is
really like. For instance, if 40 percent of stu
dents spend 20 hours a week studying, and
40 percent also report they have 20 hours a
week of free time, that might lead impres
sionable prospective students to the conclu
sion that people here study hard hut play a
lot too. It might also allow the University to
boast that its students are "well-rounded."
In truth, it is unlikely that those who spend
20 hours a week studying are the same peo
ple who report 20 hours a week of free time.
Statistics are easy to manipulate.
That being said, there are ways in which
the study could prove useful to students.
For instance, the study might show that,
contrary to the popular belief that all of us
spend our weekend nights at frat parties,
many students actually study on Saturday
nights. Those study hours might be more

productive if" they were spent in a library.
Here would be a compelling reason to keep
one of the main libraries open later on
weekends.
The study might also demonstrate that a
significant proportion of us spend evenings
hunting down food at Jack in the Box or
Denny's, because we ate dinner at a ridicu
lously early hour, between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Students have long wanted later dinner
hours to accommodate class times, exercise
and errands that cannot be scheduled earli
er in the day. Perhaps this study would give
Dining Services motivation to stagger meal
hours, or at least to keep a few dining halls
open later. Late-night pizza and fries get
old rather quickly, and it's unlikely that
Dining Services really wants all of us to
become fast-food junkies.
The study might also help groups better
schedule speakers and events by indicating
when most students actually have time to
spare in their schedules. As opposed to the
program scheduling we tend to see now,
perhaps the study will indicate typically
overlooked weeknights and times that
would actually be more convenient than
others.
Of course, the time study could also cre
ate divisions on campus. If the study
"proves" that techies spend as much time
working and studying as fuzzies do, old
stereotypes will crumble. If not, it is
inevitable at least that one camp will insist
the study serves as official evidence that its
counterpart houses Stanford's academic
wusses. There is unnecessary strife ahead.
Clearly, it is inappropriate to apply the
data in this way. for therein lies the danger
of attempting to "capture a slice of Stanford
life." Numbers tell only part of the story of
how students spend their time. We hope
that the results of this study will not be used
to support incorrect or misleading conclu
sions about students' lives.
