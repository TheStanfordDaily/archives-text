## Delusions of gross pretension 
### 
FIRST impressions
carry a lot more
weight than they
should.. That a single brief
encounter serves as the
sole basis for a first
impression is both danger
ous and commonplace.

Often, initial conceptions are at best over
simplified or at worst entirely inaccurate.
However, after subsequent encounters
and with careful reflection, one can formu
late a realistic and telling account of the per
son, place or thing that inspired the first
impression. Beginning only my eighth year
at Stanford, I'll do my best to approach such
a description of our fine University.
My time in college has been a collection
of absurd experiences, punctuated by peri
ods of sleep and regular trips to the bath
room. However, as everyone agrees, the
first year of college is by far the strangest. In
the first few weeks, we undergraduates are
asked to interact in a surreal and peculiar
environment that introduces us to a variety
of new anxieties, not the least of which is
our Ivy League inferiority complex.
Here's the prototypical scene: After the
obligatory exchange of high school stats
and hometown tales, Joe and Jane Fresh
man spend most of their first month at
Stanford engaged in SAT-word-studded
conversations with their peers, forging the
relationships that have been heralded as
the friendships they will cherish for life. If
they're not careful, however, by senior year
they will rarely see each other and will
merely share awkward salutations in pass
ing, explaining these embarrassing encoun

ters to their mutually exclusive groups of
newer friends by simply saying, "We lived
in the same freshman dorm" — a universal
excuse that frees anyone from the shame
associated with talking to "uncool" people.
To my knowledge, I myself have never
been the victim of that sort of insult, but I
have frequently been the losing participant
in the"I saw you, then you saw me, but then
I looked away and pretended I didn't see
you" game while walking through White
Plaza. We have all played this game with
people we've met through friends of
friends, but it's a great deal harder to pull
off with people you know well. To all the
people from my freshman dorm: What, do
you think I don't recognize you? Come on.
Give me some credit.
Of course, the most idiosyncratic feature
of freshman year is the orientation period.
During Orientation weekend, the balloons
and banners adorning Palm Drive and dor
mitory entryways give visitors the sense that
they are entering a gigantic theme park.
The Orientation volunteers complete the
Stanford Land™ picture, assuming the role
that the roaming squad of cartoon character
likenesses fulfill in traditional theme parks,
offering visitors a short-lived amusement
that is quickly supplanted by the irrational
but natural urge to repeatedly kick these
Mickey Mouse do-gooders.
I've never understood why humans have
this instinct to lash out against messengers
of cheer — e.g., OVs, cartoon likenesses,
carolers, clowns, cherubs — but I do know
that the reflex is universal in our species. In
fact, I once witnessed an elderly grand
mother succumb to this primitive impulse.

and I haven't thrown a birthday party since.
Again, for better or worse, first impres
sions matter, and I suppose that this fact
explains why thousands of dollars are spent
on engineering this plastic pretense that ini
tially encases the University during Orien
tation weekend. Some students quickly toss
this useless shrink-wrap aside, while others
graduate from their all-freshmen dorms
only to spend their sophomore years in the
infamous slump that occurs once reality
pierces through their polyethylene exis
tence. Perhaps the sophomorification of
Toyon Hall will mitigate the slump syn
drome, but I humbly hypothesize that the
recent addition of all-freshman dorms will
increase the total number of slump candi
dates come next fall.
Let's put it all into perspective: Would
intelligent life on another planet think that
our Stanford practices were odd and
absurd? Of course it would. It's hard
enough for intelligent life on other college
campuses to understand the things we do
here. "MuFut/nSun... ?" they say thought
fully. "You guys are completely ridiculous."
They then puff on their mahogany pipes
and resume reading their copies of The
Economist in the comfort of their ivy-clad
dormitories. Mildly dejected, we can do
nothing but Rollerblade away with lowered
heads; the bee pollen in our Banana-
Orange Triple Frap does little to comfort
our sun-baked souls.
But at least we have souls.
