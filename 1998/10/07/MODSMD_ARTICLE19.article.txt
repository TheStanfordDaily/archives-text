Post office recently sub-par
I only have a couple of things to add to
Dan Geyser's excellent critique of the Stan
ford Post Office, which was printed yester
day.
The thing that gets to me most about the
post office is its inexcusably long line. It
shouldn't have to take more than five min
utes (maybe 10) to pick up a package or to
mail a letter.
In the last three weeks, it has taken me
no less than 20 minutes to wind through the
line — and in one instance, it took 40 min
utes. There is a direct cause-and-effect rela
tionship with the themes that Geyser men
tioned in his piece and the slowness of deliv
ery.
Based on my experiences with the post
office in my first two years here (the experi
ences of others may vary, of course), it did a
competent, if not outstanding, job of han
dling the mail. But, in the past three weeks,
many of the postal workers have been
incompetent, and the level of courtesy has
been low.
Both of these things suggest that most of
the workers show very little regard for the
customer — which is totally unacceptable.

I hope that Stanford's Postmaster, who
ever he or she might he, will use this forum
in the near future to answer the charges
Geyser and I have made, and to provide
solutions like rewarding Stanford's good
postal workers and providing for some
method of accountability, for example.
The whole Stanford community would
he interested in his or her response.

Revitalize the party crowd
There are a few other working bands on
campus besides that now-legendary troupe
of story-rock icons, Labrosse Kanvas.
Blumenstein's failure to notice the
efforts of the recently-defunct Limits and
the Battle of the Bands winners Too Much
Neon suggests that he may be spending a
few too many Saturday nights studying.
He makes no mention of Lifskada,
which was incontestably the most fun band
on campus two years ago. Considering this,
together with the fact that he seems to
have missed every one of the nearly 20 on
campus gigs our band played last year

(along with 10 the year before), we are left
to conclude that he must be impeccably
unqualified to make any kind of statement
whatsoever about the Stanford music
scene.
Nonetheless, Blumenstein seems to
have accidentally stumbled onto a few
points worth repeating. The increasing
prevalence of souless DJ nerds is a threat
to live music everywhere.
The fact that White Plaza is only open
for live music from noon to 1 p.m. is a
source of frustration. That EBF and Rinc
a-Delt seem to be totally closed to campus
bands adds insult to injury.
If you are really interested in supporting
live music at Stanford, the solution is sim
ple: Go listen to it.
When you're trying to decide which
party to go to next Saturday, pick the one
with the live band and stay a while.
Social chairs will realize that live music
draws a crowd, they'll keep booking bands,
a million flowers will blossom, and the DJs
will be forced to go back to programming
HTML.

Band scene alive and well
I would like to challenge Matthew Blu
menstein to open his ears just a little more
and get away from the freaking which he so
eloquently debased in his Oct. 2 column. As
a member of the campus band Too Much
Neon, I was taken aback by his statement
that "Maybe [there] are and maybe [there]
are not [bands on campus]."
Mr. Blumenstein, for your general
knowledge, there are. And while I may
agree on the lack of opportunities for bands
to play at Stanford, I can also count on more
than the fingers on both my hands the num
ber of shows featuring tMn.
Have you ever stopped by White Plaza at
lunch and heard our music? Or the Co Ho?
Or Alpha Sig (do you even remember
Alpha Sig?) Or the Band Shak, KZSU,
Kappa Sig, Lake Lag, or the Battle of the
Bands, to name a few venues? Perhaps you
should, before you decide that there are no
bands at Stanford.
If you had been to Battle of the Bands
'98 you would have witnessed not one, but
six excellent bands performing in front of a
packed house.
Furthermore, while Canvas may be a

quality band, I would like to extend an invi
tation to all to open your minds and listen to
what else is out there. Then you can decide
for yourself what's really good. This applies
to any Daily reporter who would like to
hear tMn or any of the other existing or
future bands as well. You will be pleasantly
surprised.
Mr. Blumenstein is correct in one regard,
that Stanford is waiting to explode with
musical talent. Come support us. Sing along.
Dance. You are a big part of the reason we
play music. If we all stopped complaining
about the lack of good bands and no dating,
maybe we could meet the cute senior stand
ing next to us at the next tMn show.
