## Slim pickings for the bold and the beautiful

A POPULAR SAYING goes: "Nine
out of 10 girls in California are
attractive; the other one goes to
Stanford." I've heard this complaint from
numerous undergraduate boys at this
school, who claim to be more attractive than
their female counterparts. Are these arro
gant statements correct? Are the males here
hot while the females are heinous?
Many Stanford guys cite Playboy maga
zine as the source validating their claim.
Supposedly Playboy once ranked the boys
at Stanford the second best-looking in the
country while the female classmates were
very close to the bottom of the scale.
Although they have the naked Cindy Craw
ford issue readily available, my male friends
can never produce the mythical college
ranking issue that proves this point. I did
some research in the microfilm collection of
Green Library (yes, they carry Playboy, in
full color), and could not find these rankings
in the last four years of the college issue. I
found college football rankings and plenty
of naked girls, but either the rankings are
just a rumor or they ended before the '90s.
I tried to convince mv friend to write her

Human Biology thesis on relative collegiate
hotness, but she decided to study conformi
ty in midgets instead. So while this column
can not give the conclusive answer to this
quandary, there are a few theories that
attempt to explain this frequent complaint:
The Bell Curve
fn the bell curve of intelligence, the male
curve is flatter than the female curve. Thus
more guys are either really smart or really
dumb, while girls tend towards average
intelligence. From this data, a friend of mine
infers that most guys here coasted their way
to a high GPA and Stanford admission,
while the girls had to decide between a
social life and academic prowess. The
attractive girls were more likely to have a
raging social life to distract them from their
studies. The homely girls had time to study
for the SATs and ended up at Stanford.
Thinking back to my own high school
experience, there was definitely a trend of
amazingly good looking 14-year-old girls
getting seduced away from their studies by
senior guys. I am grateful for the spiral
perm and braces that kept me focused dur

ing those formative years. But I've never
noticed a disparity in intelligence between
the males and females I've encountered
here. Maybe I'm biased, being a girl, but
I've met some pretty dumb boys in sections.
Compared to What?
In general, real people are uglier than
media portrayals. Stanford girls are unfairly
compared to the fantasy images in "90210"
and "Sorority Sex Kittens III." I don't know
any girl anywhere who could live up to the
professionally made up, airbrushed bodies I
saw in Playboy. Maybe the girls at UC-
Santa Barbara or Arizona State University
look like that, but I doubt it.
It's Who you Know
Many Stanford men relate walking
around a foreign campus and being over
whelmed by the number of attractive girls
strolling by. Perhaps the girls at Stanford
are materially as attractive but lack the mys
tery of the briefly glimpsed state school
coed. When you see someone hot in White
Plaza, instead of wondering what that gor
geous person is really like, you remember

the time she hooked up with your room
mate and puked on your CIV paper.
High vs. Low Maintenance
I spent my summer in what some consid
er a mecca of collegiate attractiveness,
UCLA. There was an occasional gorgeous
aspiring mattress (model / actress / wait
ress), and there were really hot waiters at
the Maui Beach Cafe, but 1 was generally
unimpressed with the level of hotness.
However, I definitely felt a collective pres
sure to take better care of myself. I started
wearing eyeliner and styling my hair, vani
ties 1 hadn't attended to since freshman ori
entation. I'm not sure if the girls there are
actually more attractive, but I'm pretty sure
they're trying harder.
Two of the most beautiful girls from my
high school go to University of Arizona.
They once described their schedule as:
Wake up, blow dry hair for two hours, go to
class, go to the gym, lay out (20 minutes
front, flip, 20 minutes back, repeat), shower,
blow dry hair for two hours, go shopping for
that night's outfit, nail appointment, go out
wearing that night's outfit. This regime is

obviously going to produce more attractive
results than all-nighters at the Lair. On the
other hand, while these girls were funny and
helpful companions for shoe shopping, I
could only spend an hour with them before
1 felt my brain cells disintegrating.
It's the Walk, Not the Talk
Last spring I sat through a dining hall
meal where six boys fervently denounced
the lack of beauty in Stanford women. An
onlooker observed that five of the six com
plainers had serious girlfriends. My friend
who explained the bell curve theory to me
has kissed more girls than anyone I know.
These boys are simultaneously insulting and
partaking of the female aesthetic at Stan
ford. There is obviously something attrac
tive about Stanford women, even if they
aren't as tan as their Arizona counterparts.
Perhaps boys at Stanford need to quit their
whining and appreciate what they have.

interdisciplinary english. Her drawmates
are really hot, especially when they wear
wigs.
