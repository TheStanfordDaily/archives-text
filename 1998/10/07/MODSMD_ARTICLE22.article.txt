# Stanford avoids Hornets' sting
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
There were all kinds of shocks
running through Maples Pavilion last
night.
The first type came as no surprise
to Stanford fans — it flowed through
an electrode attached to the golden
right shoulder of Stanford junior out
side hitter Kerri Walsh, who sat out
the Cardinal's match against Sacra
mento State.

■ Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford d
Sacramento State, 13-15, 15-6, 15-9
15-4.

Walsh underwent a small proce
dure to treat the hack portion of her
injured shoulder, and Stanford fans
came expecting to see the two-time
All American sidelined.
The second kind of shock was
anything but expected — it ran
across the eyes of the Maples faithful
after the two-time defending nation
al champions dropped game one to
the Hornets, 15-13.
Fortunately, the inexperienced
('ardinal (11-2) squad was able to re
bound from its shaky start and come
away with a four-game victory, 13-15,
15-6.15-9,15-4.
A slow start was to be expected,
considering the absence of team
leader Walsh and junior outside hit
ter Jaimi Gregory, who was
scratched from the lineup after feel
ing pain in her knee during warmups.
Hut no one expected it to be quite
so slow.
"I was pretty concerned with our
slow start," said head coach Don
Shaw. "We didn't have a whole lot of
togetherness tint there on the court.
"With two of our primary passing
out. our service receive broke down.
When that wasn't working in the first

game, we totally lost all rhythm and
function out there."
Freshman middle blocker Sara
Sandrik started the game in Walsh's
right outside hitter position, but
didn't have her normal power behind
the ball and struggled early.

winningest coach to save the day.
Shaw decided to move Sandrik
into the middle blocker slot and shift
freshman middle blocker Tara Con
rad to the right side hitter slot.
You could say it worked.
Sandrik took off in game two and
finished the match with a career-high
21 kills on 40 attempts and a .450 hit
ting percentage. She also led all play
ers with six blocks on the night.
"The first game was definitely dis
appointing," Sandrik said. "For
some reason, I wasn't putting any
power behind the ball. Once I moved
to the middle. Tara took the high
balls and 1 got some quick sets.
"I wanted to do my best to fill in
on the right side. It is obviously a
hard task to fill in for a player as great
as Kerri Walsh."
Freshman outside hitter Michelle
Chambers continued her solid pro
duction, further solidifying the once
suspect left side of the team's offense.
Chambers posted 13 kills, nine
digs and three blocks.
"Although it is always a little hard
to lose the first game to a team you
expect to beat, I was proud of the way
the team hung in there." she said.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Detmer kept up her impressive
play at the net, tallying 15 kills and
five blocks.
In game one. the Cardinal posted
no blocks, marking the first time that
the nation's leading blocking team
has gone a game without a rejection.
Stanford refined its blocking

Freshman outside hitter Michelle Chambers came up big for injured
teammates Kerri Walsh and Jaimi Gregory. Chambers had 13 kills, nine
digs and three blocks in last night's win against Sacremento State.
schemes and finished the game with
14 blocks, while Sacramento State
had only three.

Coming into the match, the Cardi
nal figured to have an easy time with
the shorter Hornet blockers.
The height difference, however,
turned out to confuse the Stanford
blockers in the early stages.
" The ball was coming in lower and

faster than we are used to," Shaw
said. "Our blockers see bigger players
hitting hard in practice every day, so it
was quite a change of pace to see
Sacramento State hitting the ball low
and quickly."
