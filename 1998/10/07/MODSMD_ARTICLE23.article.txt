## Hay making most of Stanford experience 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
David Hay didn't want to play water polo in
college. He even turned down the scholarship
offered to him by the Stanford Department of
Athletics. It just seemed like it was time to
move on and focus on academics. Luckily for
Stanford, Hay decided he could do both.
"I really didn't want to come here at first,"
said Hay, a native of Santa Ana, Calif. "I want
ed to get away and have a real life and not be a
water polo player."
Persistent recruiting by the Cardinal coach
ing staff eventually helped Hay change his
mind.
"I recruited David for three months
straight," said Stanford assistant coach Ben
Quittner. "He's a very smart kid and he wanted
to concentrate on academics, but I pretty much
begged him to come here."
Hay first caught Quittner's eye when he was
a 15 year-old competing in the Junior Olympic
championships. Though he had only been play
ing p'tlo since eighth grade. Hay could already
fire the ball at 53 mph. Quittner took notice and
recruited Hay vigorously.
"Ben was the first guy I met from college
[water polo] when I was in high school. He's re
ally personable," said Hay. "He makes you feel
like he really wants you to come here, not just
you as a water polo player but you as an indi
vidual."
The attention paid off and in the fall of 1994
David Hay was a freshman on the farm. Since
then, the star hole-set has been making the
most of his time in and out of the water. Last
year. Hay was an honorable mention AII
- and third-team MPSF selection. He
was tied for second in scoring for the Cardinal
last year with 32 points and is currently one of
the Cardinal's leading scorers with nine points,
two of which were scored in last weekend's
one-point win against California.
"David's shown a lot of leadership," said
Stanford head coach Dante Dettamanti. "He
was selected by his teammates as captain this
year. That really shows the respect the rest of
the team has for him.''
"David sets a good example by the way he
plays," said junior co-captain Brian Heifferon.
"He's a very unselfish player. And he's always
trying to have fun. He's always laughing and he
has a very distinctive laugh."
Being a member of the team has obviously

been a big — and enjoyable — part of Hay's life
as a Stanford student.
"Water polo has given me so many opportu
nities," Hay said. "I've been able to travel to
Hawaii, Florida and Europe. And the team is
great. For me and a lot of the guys that's why we
keep playing. This is the most fun and talented
group of guys I've ever played with."
But for Hay, there's more to life than water
polo.
The fifth-year senior has already completed
the requirements for his undergraduate degree
in biology. Hay has also taken the MCAT and
finished his pre-med classes. Now Hay is set
tling in to enjoy his last year as a Cardinal —
and as a member of one of the top water polo
teams in the country. The squad is currently
ranked third in the nation and is looking to
make a trip to the NCAA finals this year.
"I have just the right amount of polo left be
fore I have to be an adult," said Hay. "This year
should be a good finish for what's been a really
positive time. With such a good team, this could
be a good cap on a really fun career."
After five years on the Farm, Hay's per
spective has changed. Now Hay and his fellow
fifth-year seniors Layne Beaubien, Chris
Aguilera, Arturo Rodelo and Jeremiah Robi
son are "kind of the old bulls" on the team and
there's a whole new group of "young bulls," ac
cording to Hay.
"It's funny being the oldest guy," Hay said.
"The younger guys look to you the way you
used to look to the older guys."
But Hay is not sad about the end of his ath
letic career. He's an individual who has always
been ready to move on to something new.
"It's a big world," said Hay. "And it doesn't
stop and start in the pool."
Being an athlete has forced Hay to structure
his time more carefully than the average stu
dent, but the experience has been a success.
And Hay is always looking for challenges,
whether that means taking on a powerful de
fensive hole-man or finding new mountains to
climb, literally.
"1 love hiking and mountain biking." said
Hay. "My family goes to Colorado every year.
I just think it's fun to be out in the middle of
nowhere."
Once the season is over. Hay hopes to enjoy
even more of the outdoors.
"I'd like to try to get into climbing more."

Fifth-year senior David Hay has made the most of his water polo career at Stanford.
The co-captain would love nothing more than to finish things off with a national title.
said Hay, who is ready to take a
break from the pool and see what
else the world has to offer."
His love of excitement is some
thing his teammates have admired.
"He's always doing something
exciting and interesting," said Heif
feron. "He's one of those people you
envy because he tries to get every
thing out of life. And he's always
putting in 100 percent."
Though Hay has enjoyed his time
here, he's excited about the prospect
of moving on.

" I here are other things I'd like to
do," said Hay. 'i feel old. I'm ready
to be done."
And to whatever challenge he
tackles next. Hay will bring his re
freshing outlook on life, the future
and responsibility.
"The most important thing is hav
ing a sense of accomplishment, hap
piness and peace with your life," said
Hay. "It's important to know that
you've done what you could to make
a difference."
Hay hopes to fulfill those expec
tations through medicine.
"I'd like to travel and try to get
work doing something medically re
lated in another country," Hav said.

'What's attractive to me about being
a doctor is that if you've saved one
person's life and you've lived [your
life], then you've accomplished
something."
He's already proven his abilities
in the pool and in the classroom. If
Hay decides he wants to do some
thing, the smart money is on him.
"Whatever David puts his mind
to, he can do," said Quittner.
The "big world" holds plenty of
potential for David Hay. but in the
end his goals boil down to a simple
philosophy of life.
"When all is said and done, I'd just
like to be able to smile and look back
and be happy with what I've done."
