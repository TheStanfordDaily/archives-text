# Golf falls to fourth in Illinois

### Ramona Shelburne 
The Stanford men's golf team
won round one of the Windon
Memorial Classic. Unfortunately,
the tournament had two rounds and
its disappointing performance in the
second half dropped the Cardinal
into a fourth place tie with l()th
ranked Florida.
Although Tuesday's round was a
let-down, the Cardinal proved that
it could play with some of the best
teams in the country. Three of the 12
teams in the tournament entered
play on Monday ranked in the top
25 in the nation. Stanford came into
the tournament unranked but its
strong performances the past two
weeks have shown the Cardinal to
be a team on the rise.

MEN'S GOLF
■ Yesterday: Windon Memorial
Classic. Stanford finishes fourth with
a 588 (+12).

Rain forced the cancellation of
the first round Monday, leaving the
Cardinal golfers with only two
rounds to prove themselves, and
that's what they did.
The Cardinal opened play on
Monday afternoon with a hang, rid
ing the momentum of last week's
strong performance at the Husky
Classic where they finished in a tie
for first hut lost in a one-hole, sud
den death playoff. Despite miser
able weather conditions, the Cardi
nal was in top form and ended the
first day of play in first place.
Going into yesterday's final
round at the North Shore Country
Club in Cilenview. 111., the Cardinal
men sat atop of a tough field with a
fouf-under-par opening round score
of 284 — five strokes ahead of sec
ond-place Wake Forest. In fact, on
Monday. Stanford was the only
team to shoot under par.
