### Ravi Chandrasekaran 
The newly formed Redwood
Action Team at Stanford is initiat
ing a campaign to protect environ
mental resources and to educate
the Stanford community about is
sues of concern in the environ
ment.
"Only with education and hard
work can we cause tangible change
on issues that are important," said
group president Kristen Lebacqz.a
senior.
Just two weeks into its exis
tence, RATS has accumulated
nearly 20 members from the stu
dent body. It shares the environ
mental issues domain with several
other student groups and national
group subsidiaries on campus.
"We are hoping to work with
the other organizations on campus
to make a difference in the commu
nity that we live in." said Lebacqz.
While the group hopes to create a
niche distinct from that of the cam
pus's other environmental groups,
they also hope to work alongside
other organizations, according to
Lebacqz.

The group started out to address
logging issues, and in the future,
hopes to branch into other areas.
RATS began the year attempt
ing to make a difference in North
ern California. This past weekend,
the group made a trip to the Head
waters Forest to join other activist's
in protesting the logging of the for
est and the death of a fellow activist

'Saving national treasures
is one of the most important
things that we can do for the
future'
â€” Dana Gundling

Sept. 17. David "Gypsy" Chain was
killed when a tree was allegedly
felled by loggers in the direction of
a group of protesters of which he
was a part. Activists claim that a
proper investigation into the mat
ter has not been done.
In addition to trips like these,
Lebacqz outlined a series of activi
ties in which the group is expected
to participate. The group is plan

ning a tree planting campaign in
the Green Meadow neighborhood
in Palo Alto and a protest against
Home Depot for selling lumber
from "old growth" trees such as
redwoods.
"Groups like RATS are essen
tial for all students because they
give them something to care about,
something that they can put their
energies into that will make a dif
ference," said freshman Dana
Gundling, a member of RATS.
"Saving national treasures is
one of the most important things
that we can do for the future of our
country," she added.
Also, on Oct. 27, RATS will
host photographer Doug Thron to
speak on campus. He will talk
about his work in the Headwaters
Forest. The lecture will be open to
all students and faculty.
Other students also see the need
for groups like these on campus. "It
is important that all students have
the opportunity to express their
views," said Eric Brown, a fresh
man. "Groups like RATS help to
perpetuate Stanford's open atmos
phere."
