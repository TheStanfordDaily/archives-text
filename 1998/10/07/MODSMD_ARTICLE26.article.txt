# CSRE adds students, opportunities, policy forum
## 'Dynamic' major nearly doubles in second year 
### Kimberly Downs 
The two-year-old Program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity has significantly expand
ed in both size and number of aca
demic opportunities, nearly dou
bling its enrollment in the past 12
months.
The program was created sever
al years ago in response to student
demands for programs in ethnic
studies. Formed by merging two
existing programs and creating
four new concentrations, it attract
ed 30 undergraduate majors in its
inaugural year.
"It's growing rapidly, and every
indicator is that it will continue to
grow," said CSRE Program Chair
Prof. A 1 Camarillo. "We've creat
ed a dynamic set of majors."
Students can now select from six
majors, including Asian American,
Chicano, Native American,
African-American, and Jewish
Studies as well as Comparative

Studies. The program has already
attracted 50 student majors and a
handful of minors. Another 12 stu
dents are expected to declare as
majors by the end of the quarter.
Students majoring in CSRE are
required to take two introductory
classes as well as a senior seminar,
but the emphasis remains for stu
dents to take ownership of their
course of study.
"There are many opportunities
for students to construct their own
majors," said Camarillo. "It's a
program that has taken the initia
tive in creating opportunities for
students."
More than 80 faculty are cur
rently involved in CSRE. and the
majority of their classes enrolled
between 40 and 100 students this
quarter. Besides teaching, faculty
can also be involved in the program
through the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity,
which provides research opportu
nities for faculty, graduate and un

dergraduate students.
Because of the large number of
faculty involved in the program,
CvSRE majors receive unique and
individualized attention. They
have lunches and retreats to talk
about the direction of their major.
These opportunities and flexi
bility are what attract students to
'the program.
"I think that the program allows
you a lot of flexibility to really
study what you're interested in by
designing your own thematic con
centration," said junior Genevieve
Aguilar, who is a Chicano Studies
major. "I think it's easy for every
one to find their niche in any of the
CSRE-related majors."
Even when C'SRE students are
away from the Stanford campus,
they can still participate in the pro
gram. For the past two years, it has
enabled students to receive a
stipend over the summer for work
ing at different volunteer organi
zations.
Also, students involved in the
major who want to study overseas
can take CSRE classes at Stan
ford's overseas program in
Puebla, Mexico.
CSRE funded a Public Policy
Institute in Washington, D.C., this
September during the time of
Sophomore College. The policy
forum enabled students to discuss
the intersection of public policy
and race.
"This was a tremendously re
warding experience," said junior
Radha Natarajan, who is studying
how the judicial system affects
communities of color.
"CSRE is a program for stu
dents who understand, or want to
understand, the impact of one's
race on their life chances," he
added.
Prof. Gordon Chang, director
of Asian American Studies, said
they are working on expanding
course offerings and that informa
tion sessions will be held soon.
