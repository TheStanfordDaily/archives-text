## Lab Watch Protein protects against brain damage 
### Greg Miller 
Researchers at Stanford using a promising new technique called
gene transfer have demonstrated that a protein can protect brain
cells from damage caused by strokes and seizures.
The research group found that increasing the level of the heat
shock protein 72 (HSP72) increased the survival of neurons in the
brains of rats subjected to conditions that mimicked those of strokes
and seizures.
The group was led by Midori Yenari, an assistant professor of
neurology. The study was a collaborative effort between the labora
tories of Robert Sapolsky, a biology professor, and Gary Steinberg, a
neurology professor.
HSP72 belongs to a family of proteins that are produced in
response to stressful conditions such as heat, decreased blood flow or
exposure to toxins. Sapolsky said that heat shock proteins had previ
ously been postulated to have a protective effect based on correlative
evidence.
"They're in the right place at the right time," he said. However,
this study is "one of the most direct demonstrations" that heat shock
proteins can protect cells from injury.
"A characteristic thing about neurons." Sapolsky said, "is that
there are certain protective genes that they activate at times when all
Hell is breaking loose â€” such as the heat shock protein genes. One
of the ideas in gene therapy is to give the neuron a boost, help it to
make even more of one of these protective factors."
The group used a relatively new technique known as gene trans
fer to increase HSP72 levels in the brain. A version of the herpes sim
plex virus was genetically altered to produce HSP72. The modified
virus was then injected into the rats' brains, where it was taken up by
brain cells.
In order to simulate a stroke, the researchers cut off part of the
blood supply to a certain region of the brain. This manipulation
caused consistent damage to this region, called the striatum. Rats
injected with the virus that produced HSP72 exhibited greater cell
survival in the striatum. Ninety-five percent of cells survived in the
striatum of treated rats, compared to only 62 percent of cells in
untreated rats.
HSP72 caused a similarly dramatic increase in neuron survival in
rats subjected to conditions that mimicked epileptic seizures.
Seizures were simulated bv injections of kainic acid, a chemical that
damages neurons by overstimulating them.
The group found that HSP72 increased nerve cell survival from 22
percent to 64 percent in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that
is particularly sensitive to kainic acid.
Sapolsky said that the current understanding of the mechanism by
which HSP72 promotes the survival of neurons is "kind of fuzzy."
Heat shock proteins are generally thought of as "cellular chaper
ones," whose job is to "make sure proteins fold properly and wind up
in the right place." Heat shock proteins may help stabilize and repair
damaged cellular proteins and may be involved in destroying the
damaged proteins.
Although this finding provides promising evidence that heat
shock proteins could be used to minimize damage caused to the brain
by stroke and seizures, both Yenari and Sapolsky emphasized that
several obstacles will have to be overcome before treatment strate
gies foi humans can be developed.
The outlook, Sapolsky said, "depends on how optimistic you want
to be."
'ITie findings were published in this month's Annals of Neurology.
