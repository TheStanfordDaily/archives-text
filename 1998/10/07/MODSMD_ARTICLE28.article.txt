# Sending satellites into space
## Students take projects from start to finish 
### Wade Henning 
Stanford University's Space Sys
tems Development Laboratory,
part of the Department of Aero
nautics and Astronautics, is prepar
ing to launch three unique student
built satellites into orbit.
Prof. Robert Twiggs, the founder
of the lab, is enthusiastic about the
progress he and his students have
made since 1994. when the lab's first
project, SAPPHIRE, began. Now
the lab has nearly a dozen projects
and collaborations, including
OPAL, its current satellite, and
EMERALD, a brand new project
scheduled for completion in the
year 2(XM).
"The lab has been successful
beyond what I'd hoped for," said
Twiggs. "I think students have been
very innovative. The visibility of the
lab in the aerospace community and
internationally is much higher than
I expected it to be."
All this fame comes before the
lab has even launched its first mis
sion. Getting the satellites into
space has not been the group's only
goal, though.
"The product of this lab is the
students," Twiggs emphasized. The
lab's mission "was to give students
hands-on experience in the life cycle
of a satellite."
The SSDL is unique in teaching
systems integration, a discipline that
addresses the complexity of bring
ing together parts from many dis
tinct technical fields into one pro
ject.
Students at the SSDL get experi
ence in all aspects of the project,
including electrical and mechanical

design, logistics, scheduling, busi
ness management and, of course,
economics.
"Besides spacecraft, there are
cost considerations, and very often
political considerations," Twiggs
said.
The lab's philosophy is that the
projects are all run by students,
including high-level management.
Students need to learn new skills on
the fly. Some of the biggest obsta
cles the teams have had to face are
scheduling delays and the need for a
lot of manpower.
"It's very hectic," said Carlos
Garcia, a fourth-year doctoral stu
dent, about his time as project man
ager for OPAL.
"I think it's a good experience,"
he said, explaining that the job gave
a valuable perspective on how tech
nical managers operate.
"When you go into industry,
you've already seen the problems
they have. When you become a sub
ordinate you know what you're
doing to them," Garcia said.
Meanwhile, the lab is proving
that it can make good on its ambi
tious promises. SAPPHIRE, the
first mission, is now completed and
is waiting for an opportunity to
launch. The second project, OPAL,
begun in 1995, already has a launch
scheduled.
"It's going up on a converted
Minuteman missile," said Jamie
Cutler, a doctoral student in electri
cal engineering and the current pro
ject manager for OPAL. "They
needed someone to ride on their
first launch, and we jumped in."
"The biggest motivating factor as
I see it is a launch date," said Twig

gs. He and his students feel the thrill
of putting something in orbit is key
to the lab's success.
OPAL will launch a set of
picosatellites. or picosats, hockey
puck-sized satellites that will take
measurements of the space environ
ment and radio them home to
OPAL. One important question is
the performance of the picosat
launcher in zero gravity.
OPAL will be deployed from the
larger primary cargo of the launch
vehicle, JAWSAT. a joint venture
between the Air Force Academy
and Weber State University.
It may be the third and latest
project, EMERALD, that is raising
the most eyebrows in SSDL today.
"We have SAPPHIRE and
OPAL, and this is another gem
from Stanford," Twiggs said. A syn
thesis of several new technologies,
EMERALD will demonstrate the
concept of formation flying in
space.
The mission will consist of two or

more small satellites that fly togeth
er. They will perform simple
maneuvers with a tether ensuring
that tljey do not fly apart. The
spacecraft will use a system of GPS
antennas, currently being tested on
the ground, to determine their pre
cise spacing and orientation.
For this part of the mission,
Twiggs is collaborating with Prof.
Jonathan How of the Aerospace
Robotics Laboratory. How is
demonstrating a prototype of this
GPS system in the former High
Energy Physics Lab, using a small
fleet of robot blimps.
Such formation flying technolo
gy is of particular interest to institu
tions such as NASA for use in very
large space telescopes.
What's next for the SSDL?
"1 see the lab as expanding," said
Twiggs. "Building components to
go to Mars, to do deep space mis
sions. to do some kind of asteroid
interceptors, or some lunar kinds of
things."

These solar panels will help power the OPAL and SAPPHIRE satel
lites in space.

The OPAL satellite, illustrated here by Clem Tillier, launches a
picosatellite. The picosat will take measurements and transmit the
data back to the mothercraft.
