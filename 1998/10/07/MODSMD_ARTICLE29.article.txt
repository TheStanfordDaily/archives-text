# Stanford musicians put down their instruments
## Interdisciplinary program mixes computers and music 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
In the past, music was composed
solely in the mind of the musician
and created on musical instruments.
Today, however, it is possible to
compose and alter musical composi
tions without ever touching an
instrument.
The Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics
focuses tin the development of com
puter-based musical technology
using math, science and computers
in musical and audio research with
out sacrificing the artistic expression
of musical compositions.
The multidisciplinary program
encompasses all aspects of comput
er-assisted musical development,
including composition, synthesis
techniques and computer algo
rithms, as well as digital recording
and editing.
The center is especially unique
because it incorporates the fields of
electrical engineering, computer sci
ence, mechanical engineering, psy
chology and. of course, music.
So, what exactly do these stu
dents in CCRMA work on?
"Our graduates are the kinds of
people you would hire to help

develop new effects processors and
synthesizers," said Julius Smith,
associate professor of music and
advisor in the doctoral CCRMA
program.
The processors would he used
for effects such as artificial rever
beration and equalizers.
Other students are interested in
three-dimensional sound, utilizing
large arrays of speakers and the
sound compression for Internet
applications. Many synthesizers —
including those produced at Yama
ha — use techniques developed at
CCRMA.
CCRMA does not offer its own
doctoral degree, hut any student
from the above fields who wishes to
focus on computerized musical
technology can apply to the pro
gram.
The program is highly competi
tive, especially since many of the
students are in the electrical engi
neering doctoral program. Howev
er. the combination of students with
a strong musical and technical back
ground is quite rare.
According to Smith, this unique
background only strengthens the
program.
The degree program accepts at
most three students each year.

although he would like to limit it
even more.
"I'd like to get it down to one
new student per year," said Smith.
"But it's hard to turn down excel
lent students who are capable of
excellent performance."
Can a music major compete with
an electrical engineer?
"They need to have a fairly solid
technical background and yet be
pursuing a Ph.D. in music," Smith
said.
CCRMA does offer a master's
degree within the music depart
ment. However, the program is also
highly selective — it is limited to
five people each year.
For undergraduate students
interested in computerized music
technology, the Music Department
offers a bachelor's program in
Music, Science and Technology.
"The MST undergrads take our
basic courses as requirements, and
only the rather exceptional students
will take the [graduate level] cours
es which arc not required."
Classes offered by the CCRMA
range from the most basic physics of
music and sound to advanced digital
recording and composition. Some
classes teach the basics in waves and
frequency, while others get more

complicated.
The more advanced courses
address subjects such as algorithmic
composition, which uses math and
computational skills to create musi
cal sounds, as well as acoustic com
puter system design, digital signal
processing and spectrum analysis
used in computerized music and
audio research.
Besides the academic opportuni
ties for students, the CCRMA is a
center that aids in the production
and publication of music composi
tion. Composers and visiting schol
ars from all over the world come to
the facility to work with researchers
and engineers to produce technolo
gy not only as a research tool, but as
an artistic medium.
Works produced by composers
and musicians at the CCRMA have
been showcased at music festivals,
concerts, and competitions interna
tionally. The center is publishing a
series of 14 CDs featuring computer
music by international composers
with another music publishing com
pany.
In addition, a two-volume collec
tion entitled "Computer Music @
CCRMA" was released that cov
ered work by twelve composers at
the center from 1992 to 19%.
