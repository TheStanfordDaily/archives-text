This year, there are 109 new Stan
ford Graduate Fellows, and they've
even received slightly more money
than their predecessors.
In addition to $12,(MX) in tuition
aid, this year's crop of recipients re
ceived a $17,(XX) stipend each — an
increase of $ 1 ,(XX) over last year.
Stanford's Graduate Fellowship
Program has made the University
the envy of its peers.
At a recent meeting of graduate
deans from 60 of the top graduate
institutions in the United States,
Thomas Wasow, associate dean for
graduate policy, said he was be
sieged by questions about the fel

lowship program — and that every
one who asked him about it was jeal
ous.
"One person said to me that
Stanford has completely changed
the face of graduate funding in this
country," said Wasow.
Last year, Stanford launched a
program to fund more doctoral stu
dents in the fields of engineering,
physical and social sciences. The
goal was to raise enough funding for
3(X) fellows, to be implemented at a
rate of 100 new fellowships per year.
The program overshot its 1997
goal and brought 122 fellows to the
campus. The excess numbers are a
