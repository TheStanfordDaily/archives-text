# 109 new science, engineering grads to get fellowships
## 
### Deanne Corbett 
This year, there are 109 new Stan
ford Graduate Fellows, and they've
even received slightly more money
than their predecessors.
In addition to $12,(MX) in tuition
aid, this year's crop of recipients re
ceived a $17,(XX) stipend each — an
increase of $ 1 ,(XX) over last year.
Stanford's Graduate Fellowship
Program has made the University
the envy of its peers.
At a recent meeting of graduate
deans from 60 of the top graduate
institutions in the United States,
Thomas Wasow, associate dean for
graduate policy, said he was be
sieged by questions about the fel

lowship program — and that every
one who asked him about it was jeal
ous.
"One person said to me that
Stanford has completely changed
the face of graduate funding in this
country," said Wasow.
Last year, Stanford launched a
program to fund more doctoral stu
dents in the fields of engineering,
physical and social sciences. The
goal was to raise enough funding for
3(X) fellows, to be implemented at a
rate of 100 new fellowships per year.
The program overshot its 1997
goal and brought 122 fellows to the
campus. The excess numbers are a
result of many applicants bringing
outside funding to Stanford, freeing
funds for other students.
The fellowships have given Stan
ford the edge in the competition to
attract the best scholars in science
and engineering. "People just as
sumed that you couldn't raise
money for graduate fellowships; it
just wasn't a viable option," said
Wasow.
Most schools give funding to

graduate students in the form of re
search and teaching assistantships.
"We've taken a new path at Stan
ford, and now the other institutions
want to follow us," he said.
Graduate students who receive
fellowships are free to pursue their
own research interests. They are not
restricted to working in areas that
have already received grants.
Matt Brennan, a civil and environ
mental engineering doctoral student
currently in his second year, feels
lucky to have been one of last year's
recipients. "It's nice not to have to
worry about getting funding. I've
been able to take time and do what

I've wanted to do," Brennan said.
The development committee's
total fundraising goal is $200 million,
and Charles Kruger, vice provost
and dean of graduate policy, said
that they are two-thirds of the way
there. So far, the committee has
raised $130 million, with the majori
ty of the contributions coming from
individual donors.
However, corporate donations
have also made a significant contri
bution to the fund. Chevron paved
the way last February with a gift of
$1.5 million, and since then other
corporations such as Rambus,
Hewlett-Packard and Lucent Tech

nologies have followed suit.
The question remains, however,
whether a similar program will be
created to benefit graduate students
in the humanities. Wasowsaid that if
such a program is developed, it will
be an entirely new project, and not
simply an extension of the existing
program.
Research shows most humanities
students enter their programs with
sufficient funding in place. "This was
not the case for science and engi
neering students. This program was
developed to do something for them
that humanities students already
had," he said.
