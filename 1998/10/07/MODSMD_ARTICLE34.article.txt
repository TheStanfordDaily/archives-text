II you're nursing a cold you
cauijht at Full Moon on the Quad or

are looking for a cancer patient sup
port group, the Health Library,
which opens a new, expanded facili
ty in the Stanford Shopping Center
today, can point you in the right di
rection.
According to its mission state
ment, the library, a community out
reach project ol the Stanford Med
ical ( enter, was created "to provide
scientifically based medical infor
mation and health education that
help individuals and families make
informed decisions about their
health and health care."
"We originally opened [nine
years ago) because there was very
little information open to the lay
person," said Barbara Ralston, the
director of the I lealth Library.
"Now there's too much informa
tion. and the consumer is inundated
with a plethora of media and Inter
net information that mayor may not
be reliable," she said. "StÂ»that while
our mission remains the same, our
function has been to provide a filter
for the information."
The library has been expanded to
increase its accessibility and techno
logical capacities lor local patrons
and people around the world by
doubling the number of computers
and adding a video viewing carrel.
I he Stanford Shopping Center,
which donated both sites, relocated
the library in response to the in
creasing demands placed on the old,
cramped facilities.
However, the move also reflects
the importance and the success of
the library's role in the community.
"This new site is a dream come
true," Ralston said. "It's not only a

real vote of confidence by the com
munity and our sponsors, but it also
shows what a vital resource we have
become."
Its new location, now visible from
I I ("amino Real, offers I.4(H)square
feet of space filled with health
books, more than S(H) videos and ac
cess to 266.000 medical articles
through a computerized search
bank.
The library also maintains a
World Wide Web site with links to
health-related information and on
line videos on topics ranging from
"I ife Begins at 40" to "Why Zebras
Don't Get I Ilcers."
The library is staffed primarily
by volunteers, who have come back
to work in the library because they
had such positive experiences as pa
trons. It's services are free, open to
the public, personal and eonfiden

tial. They provide patrons with med
ical resources, support group con
tacts, research services, and, most
importantly, highly individualized
attention to large and small health
questions.
Recently there has been a push
"for the individual to become in
formed and thereby their own
health advocate," said Shirley Matti
son, chair of the building committee
for the library expansion.
According to Nora Cain, manag
er of library services. The Health Li
brary strives to connect the individ
ual to the medical information that's
out there in a "feel-good-place."
The library is open Monday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. and on Thursdays until M p.m.
Its Web site is located at
