# Summer camp
## Engineering enrichment program offers selected students a leg up 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
Several of next year's incoming
freshmen engineers will be offered a
chance to interact with senior faculty
and participate in a science and math
enrichment program before the
1999-2(XX) school year begins.
The Stanford Summer Engineer
ing Academy aims to increase the
number of prospective engineering
students who remain in technical ma
jors and to diversify Stanford's engi
neering department.
The selection criteria will focus on
students from disadvantaged back
grounds who did not have opportuni
ties for technical training in high
school but are interested in pursuing
a technical major at Stanford.
The four-week program will ex
pose this group of incoming students

to a full curriculum of math and sci
ence in July and August before they
begin school.
Forty incoming students will be
invited to join the program after
being admitted to the University â€”
30 who elected to come to Stanford
and 10 who chose another school.
Students will be selected among a
pool of 1(X) recommendations from
the Admissions Office.
"We're looking at students who
come from places like South Central
L.A. or East L.A. and don't have the
luxury of a strong [science] back
ground," said Noe Lozano, associate
dean of student affairs in the School
of Engineering. "Denying access [to
engineering] based on who trained
these students is not a good idea."
