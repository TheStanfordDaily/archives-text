# Summer camp
## Engineering enrichment program offers selected students a leg up 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
Several of next year's incoming
freshmen engineers will be offered a
chance to interact with senior faculty
and participate in a science and math
enrichment program before the
1999-2(XX) school year begins.
The Stanford Summer Engineer
ing Academy aims to increase the
number of prospective engineering
students who remain in technical ma
jors and to diversify Stanford's engi
neering department.
The selection criteria will focus on
students from disadvantaged back
grounds who did not have opportuni
ties for technical training in high
school but are interested in pursuing
a technical major at Stanford.
The four-week program will ex
pose this group of incoming students

to a full curriculum of math and sci
ence in July and August before they
begin school.
Forty incoming students will be
invited to join the program after
being admitted to the University —
30 who elected to come to Stanford
and 10 who chose another school.
Students will be selected among a
pool of 1(X) recommendations from
the Admissions Office.
"We're looking at students who
come from places like South Central
L.A. or East L.A. and don't have the
luxury of a strong [science] back
ground," said Noe Lozano, associate
dean of student affairs in the School
of Engineering. "Denying access [to
engineering] based on who trained
these students is not a good idea."
Prof. John Bravman, Materials
Sciences and Engineering Depart
ment chair and principal investigator
for the program proposal, agreed that
the engineering departments lose
many talented prospective students
due to limited high school experi
ence.
"Many of these students will be
coming from inner-city schools that
may not have offered AP Physics,"
said Bravman. "We often lose a num
ber of these interested students be
fore they even enroll."
Much of the idea for this pilot pro
gram began with Erica O'Neal, assis
tant dean of student affairs in the
School of Engineering. The program
will be putting theories from

O'Neal's dissertation and research to
practice.
Program organizers hope to de
crease the number of diverse students
who get discouraged in these intro
ductory tracks and switch to less tech
nical majors.
"We tend to lose between 20 to 30
percent of students to humanities and
sciences majors," Lozano said. "If
people get A'sor B'sin the [introduc
tory calculus] series, the chances they
stay in engineering are high."
To improve diversity, the program
will be at aimed at under-represented
groups in the engineering field, such
as female, African American, Latino
and Native American new students.
The founders of the program have
been cautious, however, not to devel
op a program that will isolate or alien
ate minority students.
Lozano said the program is "em

powering a group of students coming
into engineering," while avoiding
stigmatizing any particular group.
"I think picking only 40 students is
isolating in itself," said sophomore
Xinru Woo, a computer science
major.
"I think that would have been
great when I was starting here, but I
had no idea 1 wanted to be a technical
major. Plus, so many people would
benefit — I don't see how it's fair" to
restrict it to such a small number of
students, he said.
Bravman admitted that "demand
will certainly exceed supply," so the
criteria for choosing and selecting
students are still in debate and subject
to change.
Some students, however, feel that
this program should not be necessary.
"I think it's a bad reflection of
some intro courses here if students

need to take [pre-requistite] courses
in order to take an intro track," said
senior Lucy Lewis, an industrial engi
neering major. Like Woo, Lewis did
not know before coming to Stanford
that she was interested in a technical
field.
"We're just trying to overcome a
historical disadvantage," said Brav
man, "when talent is there but just
has to be awakened."
Both Bravman and Lozano seem
confident and enthusiastic about the
prospect of orchestrating this pilot
program.
As stated by Lozano, "We're just
trying to expand this wonderful tradi
tion of engineers and research for
people who otherwise wouldn't have
the opportunity."
The $ 1 (X),(XM) per year program re
ceived a five-year committment from
the School of Engineering.
