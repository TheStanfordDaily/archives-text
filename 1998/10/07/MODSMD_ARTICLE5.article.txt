# Financial aid changes are popular, successful
## 
### Erica Platt Contributing writer 
By the time of her high school
graduation, freshman Vlada Teper
knew she was Stanford-bound.
"The only big question was how 1
was going to pay for it."
Luckily for Teper, the Universi
ty's recent changes in financial aid,
allowing students to use the full
value of outside scholarships to re
duce loans, meant that the awards
she won at graduation could follow
her in their entirety to the Farm.
"1 worked very hard in high
school and was pleasantly surprised
to win a few awards at the end of my
senior year. Without a doubt, these
grants have really made a difference
in my first year in college," said
Teper.
The University also lessened the
amount of home equity that is fac
tored into a family's assets for finan
cial aid calculations.
With these changes, Stanford
seems to have started a trend. Fol
lowing its lead, both Columbia Uni
versity and Williams College will
allow students to keep their universi
ty aid and use scholarships to reduce
their need for work-study commit

ments.
"I can't tell you how many univer
sity administrators have thanked
Stanford for doing this," said Robert
Kinnally, dean of admissions and fi
nancial aid. "Our changes have
caught the attention of a number of
university presidents and allowed
other schools to push for similar re
forms."
Over the past two years the Uni
versity has attempted to strengthen
its commitment to keeping a Stan
ford education affordable to all stu
dents.
The findings from a study con
ducted by the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid and feedback from students and
parents prompted the changes in aid
analysis for the current academic
year.
The impact of the policy changes
has yet to be quantified, but student
feedback has been overwhelmingly
positive.
Cynthia Rife, director of student
awards, explained that "many stu
dents have felt the positive effects of
increased financial aid for those af
fected by changes in the financial
needs analysis as well as those who
have been able to reduce or elimi-

nate the job and
loan portions of
their package due
to the change in the
way we treat out
side scholarships."
Last spring, the
Board of Trustees
increased financial

aid spending by $3.8 million annual
ly. $1.8 million of these funds assist
middle-income families by limiting
the impact of home equity when de
termining aid.
Now, instead of including all
home equity in the expected family
contributions, home value is capped
at three times the parents' annual in
come. Such a change will benefit
those with home values that have
outpaced their household incomes,
approximately one-third of families
receiving University aid.
"Our surveys of let us know
where families were feeling
stretched," said Kinnally. "With the
new assessments of home equity,
we've; been able to hit head-on the
problems of families that were al
ready borrowing."
The other bie change is the Uni


Kinnaly
versity's treatment of outside schol
arships. Last year alone, Stanford
students received about $6.5 million
in outside scholarships.
Yet in the past, Stanford, like
many other universities, reduced
grant awards to students who won
outside merit-based grants. The poli
cy, while allowing the University to

spread resources to the neediest, an
gered many students.
"My initial experience with finan
cial aid was very frustrating," senior
Kipper York said. "I worked for
months filling out scholarship forms
during my last year in high school
and it was subtracted right out of my
aid package. It was as if all my extra
work meant nothing."
Now, by allowing students to use
these awards to reduce or even elim
inate the self-help portion of their fi
nancial aid package, the Financial

Students deserve to keep
outside awards, and we are
always looking... to make
Stanford more affordable.'

like York, who find additional re

priority.
"We always have to remain com
petitive in our financial aid pro
grams. Students deserve to keep out
side awards and we are always look
ing for more ways to make Stanford
more affordable," Kinnally said.
It is not clear what changes lie
ahead.
"We are always in the process of
assessing what changes we should
consider," Rife said. "Those kinds of
