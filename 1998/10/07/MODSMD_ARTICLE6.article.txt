# Casa Italiana fraud trial delayed
## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Jeremy Smith, the former finan
cial manager of La Casa Italiana,
appeared before a judge yesterday
in Palo Alto Superior Court for a
pretrial hearing.

Last school year. Smith was ar
rested under suspicion of embez
zling $20,000 to $23,000 of 1996-97
house funds. He was arraigned in
April and served time in Santa
Clara'C\Tnrrty*j7*rt"Hts $20,000-bail
was posted, and he is not currently
in custody.

The 22-year-old Smith is
charged with felony embezzlement
in his criminal trial, which will com
mence Nov. 6 at 8:30 a.m.
The hearing yesterday morning,
established a date for more trial
proceedings. The current delay is
due to the investigating officer's

imminent vacation.
Smith waived his Sixth Amend
ment right to a speedy trial, which
would have required his case to he
heard in 45 days or less.
Speaking for himself rather than
through his attorney, Smith said
little yesterday. He appeared calm
and accepted the judge's recom
mendation for the next hearing in
a very perfunctory tone.
Smith is now not currently reg
istered as a Stanford student.
The University currently has no
comment regarding the status of
any civil litigation with Smith
about the missing funds.
Smith was initially suspected of

wrongdoing when he refused to
turn over financial records for La
Casa Italiana. According to the ini
tial police investigation, he could
not account for the missing funds,
but maintained his innocence.
Deputy Allen James, the arrest
ing officer in the case, said that
Smith had been mixing a signifi
cant portion of the house funds
with his own money.
La Casa Italiana is home to 47
Stanford students, each of whom
pay an average of between $7(X)
and $1,100 in quarterly room and
board.
