# Gold medalist trades blue for Cardinal

### Jen Splansky Senior staff writer 
Imagine walking into your beginning gymnastics
class on the first day of school. The teacher is passing
around a sign up sheet and when you go to sign in, the
name above yours says - Kerri Strug.
You think some prankster is making a joke. Or
maybe Strug is the TA.
But sophomore transfer Strug is not allowed to com
pete in gymnastics at Stanford because she became a
professional athlete following the 19% Olympic Games
in Atlanta. Thus, Strug was encouraged to sign up for
Physical Education 59: "Beginning Gymnastics." The
class allows her to gain access to the gymnastics facilities
in the Ford Center.
"When they told me 1 could take a gymnastics class, I
was like are you kidding? 1 get a credit for something I
have to do and like?"
Though her competitive gymnastic career is over, she
now participates in tours and exhibitions so she must
stay in gymnastic shape. Enrolling in a gym course is the
perfect amount of time for Strug to practice.
Strug may not be your ordinary beginning gymnas
tics student, but here on the Farm, she looks to be one of
the many accomplished and talented students.
"That's what's unique about Stanford," Strug said.
"Everyone has something spectacular about them, so it
is not like I am any big deal here."
This attitude is helping Strug grow accustomed to life
at Stanford. Since the 1996 Olympic Games, which
vaulted her into the spotlight, Strug's life has been a
whirlwind of gymnastic tours, television appearances,
celebrity events, charitable functions, and motivational
speeches. Combining this worldly experience with at
tending college at UCLA, and now Stanford, life for

Sophomore Kerri Strug is happy to be relaxing at Stanford.
Strug has taken a drastic change.
"I travel a lot, and I have a broad
er perspective on things now. When
I was tiny, everything revolved
around gymnastics â€” everything.
Who 1 associated with, what I ate,
how 1 slept, my doctors, my trainers,
and my friends. Now I just want to
take part in other things and inte
grate into the community."
Until the summer of 19%, Strug's
life revolved around gymnastics. She
began tumbling at age 3 because her
older sister, whom she idolized, was

a gymnast. Falling in love with the
sport from her very first "Mommy
and Me" class, Strug kept tumbling.
"When 1 was about eight is when
1 noticed a difference, that I was tak
ing gymnastics to a different level
than my friends. They would go to
the gym to have fun and I went be
cause 1 wanted to get better, to excel
and compete."
At age 12, Strug made the full
commitment to gymnastics and
never looked back. She moved to
Texas to train with legendary gym
nastics coach Bela Karolyi, but after
two years, Karolyi retired, leaving
Strug coaehless.
After short stints of training in
other locations, Strug was injured

and moved home for her senior year
of high school. Following gradua
tion, Strug returned to Texas to train
with Karolyi who had come out of
retirement to coach again for the
Olympics. This intense training con
sisted of living on a ranch in a cabin,
training six or seven days a week for
eight hours a day.
"The last year [on the ranch be
fore the Olympics] was tough, but
I'm really glad I did it. I didn't want
to look back and say, 'If I had only
done it differently." I wanted to com
mit myself to the fullest and not have
and not have any regrets."
The world knows that the efforts
paid off, and Strug's life hasn't been
the same since.

Strug committed to attending
UCLA before the Olympics and in
tended to compete for the Bruins.
However, the success in Atlanta cre
ated a change of plans. Strug turned
pro and was thus unable to compete
at the NCAA level.
The timing of attending UCLA
directly after the Olympics, and the
university's location in Los Angeles,
caused Strug's college experience to
be quite business-like. Every week
end was spent travelling, with shows
in different cities each night.
The tour with the other members
of the Olympic team has now fin
ished, and Strug is travelling less.
Currently, she is on a motivational
speaking circuit and still partic

ipates in many charitable events,
particularly those focused towards
children.
And though she has enjoyed the
excitement and experiences of the
past two years, Strug transferred to
Stanford from UCLA in hopes of
settling down into a calmer pace of
life, focusing on academics, and be
coming part of the Stanford commu
nity.
"For once in my life, I'm just try
ing to be a normal kid. It funny be
cause everything is new. I'm 20years
old but for so long, my life was the
same thing, that I feel like I'm really
growing now in many different
areas. I'm growing intellectually and
socially by meeting people. I'm tak

ing in a lot; I get to do things which I
never had the opportunity to do be
fore."
Combining her gymnastic accom
plishments with life's experiences,
Strug's outlook on life is bound to
keep her successful in all her en
deavors.
"Gymnastics really parallels a lot
of other things in life, like your acad
emics or a job. If you really want to
excel, you're going to have to put in
a lot of time and effort. But its not al
ways going to be fun and a lot of
times your going to fail, but you have
to keep going."
And with an attitude like that,
one can be sure that Strug will suc
ceed off the mats as well.
