Dear Sir,
1 wa.s a guest at your restaurant and I chose to eat two of your specials
and they were excellent. One was the corn soup with cumin. Would vou be
willing to send me the recipe?
I liked ii so much that I would enjoy preparing it for my husband. (I'm
not a good enough cook to prepare the main course, the gililed dorado, but I
compliment you on that as well.)
1 look forward to my next meal at Pro Bono. 1 shall rccommend your
restaurant to my friends in the San Francisco area.
Sincerely,
Susan Sheehan, The New Yorker Magazine
