# Stanford may face area code change again
## 
### Tyrone Prather 
Discussions are underway at the Cali
fornia Public Utilities Commission that
may spell the end of the new 650 area code
for Stanford, after little more than a year
in use.
The commission held a series of area
code relief planning hearings this week to
present options for changing the 650 area
code to meet the demand for new tele
phone numbers in the Peninsula. The area
code changes will not involve any rate
changes, according to the commission.
Maureen Trimm, assistant director of
communication services, was one of about
two dozen people who spoke at Palo Alto
City Hall Tuesday at the first of four relief

hearings. Trimm argued
against a plan to split the new
650 area code along geograph
ical lines.
Stanford completed a
problem-filled switch from

area code 415 to the new 650
code in August 1997.
"Unfortunately, when the phone com
pany made the split, they didn't give the
area enough phone numbers," Trimm
said. "We wouldn't mind a geographical
split, as long as we didn't have to change."
Industry representatives will send a re
port to an administrative judge at the con
clusion of the hearings. The commission
will review the judge's decision and vote
on a plan by March.

The commission blames strong de
mand for phone lines on the unforseen
and explosive growth in telecommunica
tion devices in the region. The intent last
year was for the 650 switch to provide
enough numbers to last the area until
2009. However, according to the utilities
commission representatives, all of the
numbers in the area will probably be used
up by 2(H) 1.
