# Stanford may face area code change again
## 
### Tyrone Prather 
Discussions are underway at the Cali
fornia Public Utilities Commission that
may spell the end of the new 650 area code
for Stanford, after little more than a year
in use.
The commission held a series of area
code relief planning hearings this week to
present options for changing the 650 area
code to meet the demand for new tele
phone numbers in the Peninsula. The area
code changes will not involve any rate
changes, according to the commission.
Maureen Trimm, assistant director of
communication services, was one of about
two dozen people who spoke at Palo Alto
City Hall Tuesday at the first of four relief

hearings. Trimm argued
against a plan to split the new
650 area code along geograph
ical lines.
Stanford completed a
problem-filled switch from

area code 415 to the new 650
code in August 1997.
"Unfortunately, when the phone com
pany made the split, they didn't give the
area enough phone numbers," Trimm
said. "We wouldn't mind a geographical
split, as long as we didn't have to change."
Industry representatives will send a re
port to an administrative judge at the con
clusion of the hearings. The commission
will review the judge's decision and vote
on a plan by March.

The commission blames strong de
mand for phone lines on the unforseen
and explosive growth in telecommunica
tion devices in the region. The intent last
year was for the 650 switch to provide
enough numbers to last the area until
2009. However, according to the utilities
commission representatives, all of the
numbers in the area will probably be used
up by 2(H) 1.

"lt's a new phenomenon to say
'We have to do this,' " said Ron
Jury, director of Communications
at Lockheed Martin, who are tak
ing part in the relief hearings.
"Now we've got cell phones, faxes,
Internet phone lines. Those are the
types of things that lead to these
problems."
At a hearing held at the San
Mateo Chamber of Commerce
Wednesday, Arnold Rodman, of
San Mateo, questioned the ability
of the telecommunications indus
try officials to fix the area code
problem with any of the plans that
were presented.
"I'm just puzzled how so many
great minds can forecast the usabil
ity of 650 and miss it by so far,"
Rodman said. "And I'm wonder
ing if those same minds are fore
casting the usability of new area
codes."
At Tuesday's hearing Trimm ar

gued for an "overlay" plan rather
than a geographical split which
could possibly force the Stanford
administration, faculty and stu
dents to change everything from
business cards to letterheads — yet
again.
The overlay plan would allow
the phone company to give out the
new area code to any new tele
phone lines from Daly City to
Mountain View. That means that a
new phone line installed next to an
old line in the same room would
have a different area code.
Trimm said that the need for
new phone lines wouldn't be an
issue on the campus for some time.
"At the time of the split, we paid
for six prefixes," Trimm said.
"That gives us 60,000 possible com
binations. I think we'll be okay for
a while."
Some citizens who addressed
the committee voiced frustration at
the overlay plan.
"I have six lines in my house,"
said Barry Boulier of San Mateo.
"I'm one of those techie people. If

I add additional lines, does that
mean a new area code? A lot of this
stuff isn't addressed. It's very frus
trating."
An additional area code based
on a geographical split would be no
problem for the University, Trimm
said, provided the division does not
disrupt the campus and Stanford
keeps the 650 area code. The Uni
versity had to change all 30,000 of
its lines for last year's switch .
"From a business perspective
it's an extremely expensive propo
sition [to switch area codes],"
Trimm said. "Of course, our pref
erence would be to keep things as
they are."
Additional measures were dis
cussed at this week's hearings, in
cluding keeping the 650 area code
but using eight-digit numbers for
new lines. That proposed solution
also had its detractors.
"That only works if the whole
country goes to that as well,"
Trimm said. "The overlay is the
way the rest of the country is
going."
