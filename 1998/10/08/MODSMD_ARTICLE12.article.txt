# Dean of Admissions and Music
## Robert Kinnally, accomplished organist and singer, plays at Memorial Church 
### Amber Johnson 
Here's a new admissions tip:
learn how to play the organ. At
least one recent Stanford arrival is
a confirmed professional, and
though he's not a member of the
Class of 2003, he definitely has a
say about who will be. Robert Kin
nally, Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid. is also
an avid musician.
A professional organist, Kinnal
ly started out playing the piano but
switched after four years of study.
" The organ has some serious at
titude ... all instruments are ex

pressive, but this one has moods
like no other," said Kinnally. "If
you're up for a real challenge and
some serious complexities, play the
organ."
Kinnally, accustomed to jug
gling musical and administrative
responsibilities, accompanies the
Catholic Choir in Memorial
('hureh in addition to singing tenor
on Sundays, lie performed in
churches during his undergraduate
career and directed a parish choir
while completing his graduate stud
ies in English and American litera
ture at New York University.
After working at the University

of Bridgeport, Connecticut, he ac
cepted a full time position as direc
tor of music at St. Augustine
Church in Connecticut. According
to Kinnally, he"was incredibly
poor but having the time of [his]
life."
At Stanford. Kinnally enjoys the
hectic schedule of both an admis
sions officer and an organist.
While Kinnally promises not to
admit a disproportional number of
organists next year, he does appre
ciate the skill in applicants.
"There are not too many organ
ists in the world ... You can't ex
actly carry [an organ] around with

you," Kinnally said.
While busy assembling next
year's freshman class, Kinnally is
very happy to play occasionally at
Memorial Church. He plays hymns
for worship and accompanies the
choir.
"What I love, sometimes more
than playing the organ, is hearing
people sing to the organ," he said.
Kinnally also enjoys the interac
tion with students and the sur
rounding community during wor
ship.
Surprisingly, considering Kin
nally's extensive experience, he
taught himself how to play. As

many students can relate, he didn't
have a car at the beginning of his
career as a musician, and therefore
studied independently in place of a
conservatory. Kinnally read books
and also listened to organs in vari
ous churches, attempting to imitate
the sounds made by each one.
By high school, Kinnally had al
ready played as a substitute organ
ist during mass in his local church.
Currently, Kinnally does not do
much performing outside of Sun
day services, though he held his
first recital two years ago at Christ's
Church in Bronxville, N.Y. and
hopes to hold more in the future.

Eventually, he also hopes to study
organ at a conservatory.
As for public performances with
other faculty members, there is
nothing on the calendar. Provost
Condoleezza Rice is an established
pianist, yet Kinnally adamantly re
jects the idea of a joint perfor
mance.
"I would never want to do a duet
with her," Kinnally said. "She's too
good."
Kinnally's next performance
will be on Sunday, Oct. 18 at the
regular mass in Memorial Church
at 4:30 pm. He accompanies the
choir one Sunday per month.
