Tuition costs still rising
WASHINGTON (AF) —The price of college grew at a slower
pace this year, but the ticket to a higher education still costs 50 percent
more than a decade ago.
The 4 percent average increase this year means tuition and tees
rose $132 at public four year-institutions, reaching an average of
$3,243, the College Board reported Wednesday.
For private, four-year colleges, average tuition and fees rose $723.
up 5 percent to $14,508. Those costs averaged $1,633 at public two
year colleges, up 4 percent, or $66. A 4 percent increase also occurred
at private two-year colleges, where average tuition and fees rose $254
to $7,333.
Tuition and fees rose an average of 5 percent last year and 6 per
cent each of three years before that. Because of an earlier round of
double-digit growth, tuition at public four-year institutions in the last
decade has risen 50 percent, adjusted for inflation. Family income dur
ing that time rose only 1.5 percent, also adjusted for inflation.
Attending a public, four-year college or university cost 62 percent
of a low-income family's earnings and 17 percent of a middle-income
family's earnings last year, the most recent year for which numbers
were available. Sending a child to a private institution would have
consumed 162 percent of a low-income family's earnings, compared
with 44 percent of the earnings of a middle-income family and 4 per
cent of the earnings of a hinh-ineome family.
