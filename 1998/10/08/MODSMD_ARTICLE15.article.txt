# Clinton urges 'a vote of principle'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Clinton said today that mem
bers of the House should cast "a
vote of principle and conscience" on
whether to approve a broad. Repub
lican-written impeachment inquiry
against him. He denied he was trying
to pressure lawmakers.
"Its up to others to decide what
happens to me and ultimately it's
going to be up to the American peo
ple to make a clear statement there."
the president told reporters in the
Oval Office. "More important than
anything else to me is they do the
people's work and then let the peo
ple decide where we go from here."
In return. Sen. Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, the senior Democrat
in the Senate, offered "friendly
advice" to the White House: "Don't
tamper with this jury." Senators
would be the jury if impeachment
resolutions were approved by the
House and a Senate trial was con

vened.
A day before the House is set to
approve the impeachment inquiry.
Democrats were searching for an
alternative that would satisfy both
liberals and conservatives in the
party, as well as those with tough re
election races.
Meanwhile, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton met with a group
of freshman House Democrats to
urge them to "vote their conscience"
and to argue on behalf of the Demo
cratic alternative, said her
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry.
White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart denied that the first lady
was trying to help twist arms on the
president's behalf. "She made a case
for the Democratic alternative
because it's an alternative that's
more fair." Lockhart said.
After a House Democratic cau
cus. it was clear that a number of
lawmakers — especially conserva

tives and those in tough races —
would vote tor the Republican reso
lution.
"This cannot be a vote where you
try to defend the president of your
own party," Rep. Tim Roemer. D-
Ind., told reporters in expressing
support for the GOP proposal.
But most Democrats who spoke
at the meeting said they would show
strong party unity bv voting first for
a more limited inquiry — even
though it's destined to fail.
"We're a party and we have to
start thinking like a party," Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., told
reporters.
The White House denied that
Clinton was engaged in an intensive
lobbying campaign. Lockhart said
the president had called a half-dozen
lawmakers in the last few days, and
that half of those were return calls to
members who had called him. Clin
ton also denied trying to pressure

lawmakers, saying. "1 think every
body should cast a vote of principle
and conscience."
Republicans are arguing that if
Clinton committed perjury,
obstructed justice or tampered with
witnesses, as Starr contended, he
should be impeached. While careful
ly not defending Clinton's behavior.
Democrats say the Lewinsky matter
is about an affair that the president
sought to conceal, not abuse of
power on official matters.
For Democrats, the dilemma is to
find a more limited inquiry that
would go nowhere, but provide
enough political cover for party
members to support an inquiry —
and then vote against the GOP plan.
This way. Democrats could tell
constituents they were condemning
Clinton's conduct but were unwilling
to saddle the public, which polls indi
cate is tiring of the Lewinsky matter,
with another lengthy investigation.
