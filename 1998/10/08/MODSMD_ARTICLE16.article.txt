# Aids drugs reduce deaths by nearly 50 percent
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of
Americans dying of AIDS fc4l a dramatic 47 per
cent last year as powerful new drugs kept the dis
ease at bay for thousands of patients.
It's the second straight year that AIDS deaths
have dropped — this time nearly twice as fast as in
1996 and enough to push the disease out of the top
10 causes of death in this country for the first time
since 1990, the government said Wednesday.
Still, last year also saw some 40,(XH) new infec
tions, a number that isn't dropping, meaning more
people are living with and potentially spreading
AIDS and the virus that causes it. And doctors
worry the wonder-drug combinations that have
been so successful will eventually stop working.
The drop in AIDS deaths happened across
gender and race, although the rate among white
men fell most. Overall. 16,685 Americans died of
AIDS last year, or about 46 each day. Just two

years earlier, it was 118 per day.
The news from other nations is much worse: In
Africa, home to 90 percent of AIDS deaths, there
is little money for basic medical care, much less
the AIDS drugs that cost more than $K).(KK) per
year, per person. In some areas, one in four adults
has the virus that causes AIDS.
In part because of the good news here, govern
ment officials and activists worry that Americans
will stop seeing the disease as a deadly killer and
take fewer precautions against infection.
" They hear about the good results and say,
'Well this isn't as much of a problem as it used to
be,"' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the
National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Dis
eases.
Fauci says better access to care and more
aggressive treatments contributed to the drop, but
he gives most credit to the new drugs. At least

150,000 Americans are now using the powerful
protease inhibitors first made available in Decem
ber 1995.
But the drugs aren't a simple solution. In addi
tion to their cost, they are tough to take. West
takes 48 pills a day, and the drugs have left him
with an odd side effect, a buffalo hump on his
upper back.
Other side effects include diarrhea, insomnia
and stomach pains. And the pills must be taken on
a strict timetable.
And the protease inhibitors may not work for
ever. Fearing that people may develop a resis
tance to them, scientists are feverishly working on
other drugs to fight AIDS.
"We may just be seeing a postponement of
death," said Dr. Helene Gayle of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. "We want to be
sure people understand these are not cures."
