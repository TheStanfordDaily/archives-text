## Editorial Use Tresidder wisely 
### 
University should focus on
social and economic desires
of students and community

OVER THE PAST four years,
Tresidder Memorial Union has
undergone a series of major
facelifts. Not coincidentally, Marc Wais
look over tlie helm as Dean of Students
during that same time. Through his insight
and the work of the Tresidder Advisory
Hoard, gone are the echoes of dark vacant
rooms, dilapidated pool tables and the clos
et-sized dry cleaners. In are new vendors,
new services, clean furniture and a crop of
Stanford consumers who are learning to
rely on Tresidder for day-to-day conve
niences.
I residder, however, remains far from
fulfilling Wais' vision of being a "hub of stu
dent activity."
In fact, it will never achieve this if the
philosophy behind its development remains
focused on maintaining it as a "Memorial
Union." Deliberate efforts have kept the
"student" out of its name. According to
Wais, this is to prevent a successful Tresid
der from meddling with the community
building responsibilities of Residential
Education.
Whether this approach is in the best
interests of the Stanford community is
questionable, but with this insistence that
student community building will remain
centralized in the dorms, Tresidder has no
choice but to remain the campus oddity it is
father than the social hot spot that it could
be.
Currently, Tresidder caters to the gener
al public through food services such as
Polio Key's and Jamba Juice, both conve
niently located near Stanford Hair. The
offices of the ASSU are directly above the
C offee House and next to the Lair.
We believe Tresidder's usefulness could

improve if it offered the services typically
found in student unions. It would be wise to
include satellite postal services such as a
quick-stop stamp machine or mail drop site.
Tresidder Express could expand its offer
ings to include more items which the Book
store carries for last-minute, late-night pro
jects.
Adding a gym last year was a step in the
right direction, as it offers a popular service
otherwise located a mile away in Arrillaga,
but the equipment and programs it offers
are currently sparse. The gym should
expand to accommodate the complete
needs of its patrons.
Past efforts to rent space to Tower
Records and Blockbuster Video were
headed in the right direction. With the lease
of the old American Express office private
ly pending over the next few weeks, we
hope a new patron offering a useful product
at a reasonable price will help attract more
members of the community.
While non-students have the means to
shop off campus, Tresidder services should
make sure to cater to the specialized major
ity that it serves. Food services should
remain open later. Tresidder Express
would make a great 24-hour convenience
store. The inner eating area that houses the
Corner Pocket could use some partitioning
to improve its atmosphere.
The responsibility does not just fall on
businesses and the Stanford administration.
The community itself should make more of
an effort to utilize Tresidder to its fullest.
No doubt, as more general consumer
services are made available, groups will
realize the convenience of using Tresidder's
many conference rooms. Tresidder could
be the ultimate one-stop site for errand
running and project-planning.
A great deal of latent potential remains
hidden within Tresidder's walls. We praise
the intensive efforts to release it thus far
and hope that future developments will
consider the practical as well as the social
needs of the Stanford community.
