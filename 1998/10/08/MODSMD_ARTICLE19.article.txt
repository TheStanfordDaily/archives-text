## How I survived without alcohol 
### 
SOMEHOW, I'VE
managed to make it
through my time at
Stanford without drink
ing.
Drinking alcohol. Ha, ha.
Good one, though.
Well, okay. I did have

one glass of champagne April of freshman
year in celebration of my election to the
ASSU Senate. I didn't know you could
waste three-dollar champagne.
Seriously, though, I seem to have sur
vived here on water and Diet Coke. Well,
as of now, water. I gave up the Diet Coke
in June. According to my biology-oriented
friends, drinking calorie-free soda will rot
my brain, ruin my prostate and make me
"look like a girl."
Whatever. I just think it tastes better.
Don't you get that gritty sensation in your
teeth from regular Coke? Nutrasweet and
Stanford Dining Services aside, I've held
my own without Hooding my body with
foreign chemicals. I've lived a meaningful
and happy life without once wearing beer
goggles. I've even gone to "fraternity" par
ties. Granted, I haven't had any fun, but
I've gone.
Let me tell you right off the bat, though,
that very few frats provide diet EANABs.
Trust me, I've looked all over. Fresca and
Diet Rite are not typical Greek offer
ings— except for in the new Cowell Clus
ter, that is.
Diet soda or not, these fraternity parties
are interesting little soirees. I like music
and everything, and dancing can be fun,
but sticky floors, thumping bass and

sweaty people just rub me the wrong way.
Almost literally. Is it me, or are these
places just jam-packed with people? You
can't turn around without doing the lam
bada with someone. Not that that's neces
sarily a bad thing, but have you ever tried
to wend your way through the center of a
fraternity dance floor? It's tougher than
getting a front-row seat in a SLE lecture.
Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize to those of
you in SLE. I admit it. I was in SLE, I tutor
in SLE, and now look at me furthering this
massive campus-wide myth for my person
al benefit. Sick, isn't it? Of course, for
those of you who only know me through
this article, maybe you're not so sure it's
only a SLE "myth." Well, trust me, it is.
Where was I? Oh, yes, the middle of the
fraternity dance floor, getting far too inti
mate with a sweaty stranger. Isn't that just
the coolest? I can't think of a better way to
really get to know someone, all the way
down to the type of deodorant he or she
wears.
You know, when I first got to campus,
that was one of my biggest frat party com
plaints. No, not deodorant (or lack there
of), but the fact that I couldn't talk to any
one. Even the folks in my massive dorm
group could only communicate through
improvised sign language and up-close
"ear shouts."
"Do you wanna leave?" I would yell to
someone. "What?" "Do you wanna
leave?" I would repeat, louder and direct
ly into my recipient's ear. "What?"
This interchange would usually result in
the shake of one's head, an apologetic
smile and a shoulder shrug (party sign lan

guage for"the music is so damn loud that I
didn't hear a word of what you said, so I'm
going to smile, ignore you and continue
freaking with this random person behind
me").
Typically, after a few such failed inter
changes, I would fight through the mob on
my own (making a few new friends along
the way), and, ears ringing, get lost on my
way back to Flo Mo — even though the
frats were, for the most part, in my own
backyard. Eventually, I got tired of getting
lost, so I found other things besides frats.
Like SLE reading. Sigh.
In retrospect, though, I'm not sure if
there's a lesson to be learned from my lack
of libation. I've been able to have fun with
out, hut who knows?
Maybe I wouldn't have gotten lost all
the time had I been inebriated, or at least I
would have had more fun getting lost,
right? Maybe I would be the one shrugging
when someone screamed a question across
a crowded dance floor. Maybe I wouldn't
mind dirty dancing with a stranger.
What if I've just been too closed-mind
ed all this time? What if I haven't given
alcohol enough of a chance? What if I'm
missing out? Well, no longer. I'm totally
game for this alcohol stuff. Ready or not,
here I come.
As soon as it's calorie-free.

drinking games when you're only pounding
