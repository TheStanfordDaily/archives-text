Co-ops and University
should work together
Last Friday's article, "Not living in
Syn.'". conveyed some misrepresentative
information about the Stanford University
Co-op Council and its mission. While 1
Cannot speak for the council as a whole, as
a.supporter of the council's purpose I
would like to clarify a couple of points that
did not accurately convey my sense of the
meeting that was covered in the article.
First, the abrasive quote suggesting
that I feel that the cooperative houses at
Stanford are under attack by the Universi
ty was taken somewhat out of context.
While I do feel that the co-ops can be a
pain to the University because we do rep
resent exceptions to several "rules," my
experience as a resident assistant and as a
co-op resident has given me the impres
sion that the University often recognizes
the diversity that these exceptions can
contribute.
Although the relationship between the
co-ops and the administration has at times

been strained, developments such as
Terra's success in preserving its murals
and the Row's continued support of the
Co-op Council indicate that co-ops and
the University may have something to
gain by working together. Opening this
dialogue is part of the reason that the
council was created, and I hope that it will
continue to be a significant part of its func
tion.
Second, while I feel that co-op resi
dents believe that murals are an integral
part of their houses, 1 hope that the article
did not in any way show disrespect for the
powerful murals on the walls of Casa Zap
ata. My understanding of our position on
murals is that we hope that Facilities can
stretch its support of murals such as Zapa
ta's to accommodate the part that artwork
plays in the co-ops.
In her letter on Tuesday, Jacquie Pratt
explained that the co-ops are not current
ly at as low a point as the article seems to
indicate. The houses do fill up quickly
(every woman and nearly every man
assigned a co-op has a priority) and the
recent formation and success of the Co-op

Council suggests that the co-ops are as
"alive and thriving" as we ever have been.
T he council is an organization that has
the potential to build upon this success
and I appreciate the Daily's coverage of
its first meeting. I hope that this letter
helps to clarify our purpose and I suggest
keeping an eye on the organization to see
what it will accomplish in the year ahead.

Geyser,; Daily are childish
Upon reading Dan Geyser's article,
"Going postal at the Post Office," 1 was
amazed not only at the immaturity with
which he approached the issue, but his ele
mentary style of writing and debasing
accusations. His writing, though, is not
only a reflection on himself, but on the
Daily staff and the merit of the newspaper.
I thought it very unprofessional for the
Daily to publish an article where the
author docs not know "what the Hell"

IHIJM is; do your research, and perhaps
you should look into The New York
Times, or for that matter, the Harvard
Crimson, to see how often they use phras
es like "whatever the Hell" and "don't give
me this crap." I like to think of the Daily as
a college-level publication, one which
writes to the college level and has some
sense of professionalism.
The greater basis for my letter, howev
er, is that most of the information in
Geyser's article is unfounded. Instead of
ranting and raving about how the package
he sent to New York ended up in Australia
— which, by the way, is very improbable,
since sending a package to Australia would
cost roughly four times as much as sending
it to New York, and the U.S. Postal Service
does not shuttle packages around the
world for the price of shipping it across the
country — he should have looked into the
reasons why the post office is operating so
slowly. It is not because employees are
"running around with no pants," but sim
ply because there are not enough employ
ees to cater to the needs of such a large stu
dent population.

To debase the postal employees, calling
them "aberration[s]" and saying that "one
guy ... looks straight out of the 'Golden
Child' movie," is much less than I expect
ed of the Stanford Daily, let alone Dan
Geyser, who is a senior majoring in politi
cal science. That supposedly implies that
he has sufficient intelligence and, having
undergone a Stanford education, enough
tact to argue a point without resorting to
childish antics of taunting a person
because of his appearance.
As for the editorial staff of the Daily,
which allowed such an article to be pub
lished, perhaps they should examine their
writers a little more closely and consider a
replacement for those like Geyser who
decide to rant like a five-year-old child
instead of reporting like Stanford students.
1 hope with all sincerity that the Daily will
improve its style of journalism so that
when my fellow college students and I read
the Stanford Daily, we will not be insulted
by the level and approach to reporting.
