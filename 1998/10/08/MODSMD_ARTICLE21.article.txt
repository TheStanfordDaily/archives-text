44TTS THE AMERICAN Dream
I come true," the Guardian news-
JLpaper announced in January
1998, describing the discovery of Olestra.
No doubt, when they framed the Constitu
tion, the Founding Fathers were dreaming
of a substance that is impossible to digest,
tastes like fat, and leaks uncontrollably
into your underwear.
"The American Dream turned night
mare" is such a well-worn descriptive tool,
and can be applied to so much of what
America has to offer — violence, inequali
ty, racism — that you wonder why people
came up with the term "American Dream"
in the first place.
But if the Founding Fathers didn't drink
skimmed milk, their ancestors do now. An
unwritten amendment to the Constitution,
gradually framed over the twentieth centu
ry, is that people have the duty (in this case
not the right) to stay healthy. Naturally, it
was only a matter of time before this

dream of physical fitness turned into the
nightmare of diet hooks, Stan masters and
Richard Simmons.
Consider poor old Oprah. Every time
she thins out we celebrate as if she just
exorcised some demon. And when she
slips back to her inevitably gluteal self, we
gloat and snicker. Even as far as Malaysia,
the following article appears. "DIE I Diva
Oprah Winfrey secretly pigs out twice a
month on fattening chocolate chip cup
cakes FedExed to her from Baltimore. She
got hooked on the cream cheese-filled
treats while living there years ago."
The tone is unmistakable. Oprah has
given in, succumbed to the evil that lurks
within. She's hooked, the Mahusians tell
us, on treats I II LED WITH CREAM
CHEESE!
Oprah Winfrey's soulmate Sarah Fergu
son is paid $1 million by Weight Watchers
to watch her weight and hit it it it moves.
Like a slim beacon of hope. Fergie is

meant to lead fat women everywhere into
the Promised Land of health and fitness.
The only problem is that nobody can
really explain what is so great about the
land of health and fitness. It takes a hell of
a lot to get there — exercise, asceticism
and horrible food. But once you've man
aged to reach the enchanted land of firm
buttocks and brisk pulses, what have you
gained? The answer is nothing worthwhile.
If you don't do anything with your health
you might as well not have it.
The American cult of physical fitness
lias made exercise an end in and of itself.
We run on our treadmills so that the next
time we'll run faster. We lift up weights
only to put them down. We plug ourselves
into machines that tell us how fast and
when to move our legs, and if we're lucky,
we're able to read a book while we do it.
We do all this without ever getting any
where. which is why the patron saint of
physical fitness is none other than Sisy

phus. Rolling the boulder up the hill, his
arms must have become lean, his heartbeat
stronger and stronger. At the end of every
day in eternity his pulse, when checked,
must have been even more reassuring, fast
and fluid than it was the day before. But
when all you do is roll a boulder up a hill,
getting faster can bring little comfort. It
only makes you more efficient at perform
ing your own torture.
1 was once tired and bored enough to
watch the "Miss Fitness USA" competition
late one night. All the contestants had
impressive jobs; one was an electrician,
another a Bay Area choreographer. But
this didn't make any difference. It was
their fitness that was on display. Accord
ingly, the first round (demonstrating
"poise and elocution") involved each con
testant delivering a speech about why fit
ness was the most important thing in her
life. There was all the usual talk of
"reduced stress." "greater efficiency," and

the limitlessness of human potential. This
limitlessness of human potential was then
demonstrated in the second round by the
contestants doing one-armed pushups to
Tom Jones songs, whieh is a pretty miser
able statement about humanity.
Physical fitness is yet another form of
body fascism. Obviously, there are all sorts
of advantages to physical fitness. What I
object to is the idea that if someone is
unfit, then he or she must be in some way
irresponsible or lazy.
I don't quite understand what either
Oprah or Fergie gained from being thin.
Oprah only has to hold her microphone
and interview idiots. Fergie has to do even
less. If they're happier fat than healthy,
then let them be.
