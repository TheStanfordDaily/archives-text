## Fourth and inches Gil Lopez Some of my Cardinal rules 
### 
An open letter to Stanford freshman:
Finally. I get the opportunity to enjoy my first football
game this season as a fan on Saturday. No working in the
press box. no shirt and tie. no trying to constrain cheers
and groans.

I'm not looking forward to it.
This may he the only true complaint I have about Stan
ford. I can deal with the bad food, the mind-numbing sec
tions and the fact that I can hear all too well the most inti
mate moments of my upstairs neighbor, but when it
comes to having to put up with the average Stanford fan.
I lose my patience.
It seems Stanford football fans are... well, they're just
bad. Not all of us mind you. Some people understand the
rules of watching a college football game. And no, I'm not
talking about showing up in a g-string with your body
painted in the school colors. Even I have my limits.
Hut there are some traditions I have seen at other
schools that just elude the bulk of the student body here.
I've already lost hope for the upperclassmen here, but
hopefully I can still show you freshmen the way before
you travel down the dark road of apathy.
So this is my one attempt to set everything straight, to
try and make the student section at Stanford Stadium
what it is meant to be.
Rule No. 1: SHOW UP!!!
Yes. freshman. I know that right about now you're
thinking I 'm not exactly the Lou Holt/ of college football

fandom. but this is actually an issue that needs to be ad
dressed.
Stanford Stadium is a great place. With a capacity of
85,500, it's the largest privately owned football facility in the
nation. But I noticed something. The stadium falls about a
mile short of glorious when only 30,000 fans show up.
Maybe I can put this another way. You know that feel
ing you got when you showed up to your first fraternity
party too early? The place is empty and the reek of beer
hasn't had the opportunity to overtake the regular frat
house stench. It's downright depressing, huh? That's what
a less than half-full football arena is like.
So put down your CIV books — or I-HUM or what
ever the Hell you people call it nowadays — and get your
butt over to the games. Go with a group of friends. Tail
gate. Make a day of it. In case you haven't noticed, Palo
Alto isn't exactly the greatest "college city" in the nation.
Have a beer and kill an afternoon watching football.
Rule No. 2: Never sit down.
Ever. OK, maybe if you're in a wheelchair, but that's
pretty much it.
I don't know how this one got started. My guess is that
somewhere along the line someone figured out that peo
ple who have been standing for a long time tend to be an
grier than well rested people and so they yell more, but
that's just a theory. All I know is that you just don't sit
down when you're in the student section of a college
game. Take a lesson from the Sixth Man Club.
Now people may argue that standing for three-plus
hours is tiresome, but I don't buy that. You've all been in
line at the bookstore, for loan pick-ups and for a beer at a
party (don't deny it). These are all marathon activities
compared to watching a football game. You ever see Ty
rone Willingham sit down during a game? No. And right
about now he probably needs it more than any of us.
Someone once asked me very politely to sit down dur
ing the second quarter of a game. That person hasn't been
