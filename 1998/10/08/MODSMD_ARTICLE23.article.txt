# Stanford hopes to pacify Pacific
## 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
Not many people want to spend a
weekend in Stockton, Calif. The
Stanford women's field hockey
team, however, is looking forward to
its trip toward the trenches of Cali
fornia's Central Valley.
Although the normally stilling
Stockton air is predicted to be a cool
SO degrees this weekend, the Cardi
nal still hopes to remain hot.
Saturday, Stanford will enter play
armed with an intimidating 7-2 over
all record, including an undefeated
4-0 record in games against North
ern Pacific Conference rivals. Facing
Pacific, a member of the NorPac the
Cardinal will have its opportunity to
win its fifth conference match in as
many attempts.

■ Saturday: Stanford (7-2, 4-0
Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence) at Pacifc(4-1,2-0). I p.m.

HOP. the only NorPac team the
Cardinal has yet to play this season,
has an intimidating record of it's
own, standing at 4-1 overall and 2-0

in the conference.
The Tigers, however, have had
few hopeful signs against Stanford in
the past. Last year, in regular-season
matches against Pacific, the Cardinal
refused to give up a single goal, win
ning the two matches 6-0 and 1 -0, re
spectively.
The Cardinal then met the Tigers
in its final game of the season, a
Western Collegiate Tournament
match in which Stanford completed
the season's sweep with a 2-1 victory.
Stanford, always mindful of its
goal to win the NorPac Conference
and enter NCAA postseason play, is
increasingly aware of the impor
tance of each game. Thus, the match
against UOP is important as it is the
Cardinal's final game before the
team travels to Northeastern and
Boston College next week.
Head coach Sheryl Johnson is ex
cited about the team's performance
this season but is hesitant to begin
celebrations just yet.
"It's great because we're still hop
ing to get one of the wild-card bids
[to the NCAAs]," Johnson said. But
"in order to be recognized we have
to have an incredible record. We
hope to win the rest of our games."
Johnson's hopes, while high, are
anything but out of reach. During
the last three weeks, she has watched
her team roll over its opponents,
winning all but one match by at least
three goals.
During the first nine games the
Cardinal has surged forward with a
powerful team effort. Stanford's de
fense and passing have kept the ball
on the opponents' side of the field to
such an extent that the Cardinal has
not conceded a goal since Sept. 1 7.
Leading the team have been a
group of seniors that seems deter
mined to leave Stanford with a bang.
Senior forwards Monique Leroux
and Carey Cloyd have scored a com
bined 11 goals, which is more than
Stanford's opposition has scored all
year.
Midfielders Jordyn Kramer and
Justina Williams have also aided the
offensive attack by providing two as
sists each. Sweeper Lissy Goralnik
has already surpassed her totals last
year with two goals and three assists.
The Cardinal has gone 3-0,
outscoring its opponents 12 goals to
0. since upsetting Northwestern ear
lier in the season.
