Although the No. 7 Stanford's women's golf team
had bright expectations for the beginning of its season,
the weather in Tulsa, Okla. spoiled the plans. Due to the
inclement weather, the competition was officially short
ened from three days to two. With only two rounds of
play, the Cardinal couldn't shake several teams, and
concluded the tournament finishing 12th out of IS
schools, with its highest finisher tying for 12th place.
