## Senior Jeff Allen is making his mark with the football team 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Five years can pass in a blink of
an eye. They ean, anyway, if you're
fifth-year senior flanker Jeff Allen.
"Honestly, I can't believe how
fast it's gone by," Allen says, re
flecting on his career. "1 can't be
lieve the end's almost here. I'm
starting to worry about the future a
little bit."
"I may have to work after this!"
Allen has already done his share
of work on behalf of the Stanford
Athletic Department. The three
year special teams contributor has
also run track for the past four
years. These added efforts, howev
er. have not slowed Allen down in
the least, as he looks to graduate
this year with a degree in econom
ics.
"I'd run track in the winter, and
when spring ball came around I'd
do that," Allen said. "It's difficult,
and it takes up a lot of time.
"Track's a lot easier, obviously,
because it's just three hours a day.
Football takes up a lot more time,
especially during spring ball. It's
difficult — but it's just time man
agement."
In fact, outdoor track has helped
keep Allen in shape to catch the
pigskin.
"If I wasn't out running track I'd
be doing off-season conditioning
for football. It's pretty similar."
Until this year, it's actually been
track in which most of Allen's ac
colades at Stanford have come. He
took third in the 400-meter hurdles
at the 19% Pacific 10 Conference
Championships and third as a
member of Stanford's 1600-meter
relay team.
The following year, he improved
to second overall in the Pac-10 in
the 4(H) hurdles, with a time of
50:98.
Meanwhile, his fall assignments
for the football team were con
fined to special teams.
Allen ran down on punts and
kickoffs. recording 10 tackles and
two blocked punts, but his offen
sive production had been limited
to two catches for 43 yards against
San Jose State last year.
One of Allen's most memorable
blocks, however, came in the 1996
Sun Bowl against Michigan State.

Smashing through the Spartan
line. Allen stuffed a punt that was
recovered for a Stanford touch
down.
"T hat was fun — that was a lot of
fun." Allen said.
He finally got his chance to step
out of the shadows in the first quar
ter of the Arizona game, earlier
this season, when starter Troy
Walters injured his ankle on a 67-
yard reception.
One week later. Allen got his
first career start.
Facing North Carolina, he re
sponded with five catches for 111
yards and his first career touch
down.
"It was a long wait." he laughed.
"Finally having a chance to go out
and play is a lot of fun."
The score came on a nine-yard
fade from quarterback Todd
Husak.
"It was a quick go," Allen said.
"It's a lot of fun, scoring your first
touchdown. It's exciting being at
home. too.
"The crowd just goes crazy, in
stead of on the road, when it just
gets all silent and it's just you and

all your buddies."
Even on the road, though. Allen
loves, and always has. being part ol
a team.
"The best part is just being with
your team, with the excitement on
the sidelines, laughing with all your
teammates."
'It was a long wait.
Finally having a chance to
go out and play is a lot of
fun.'
— Jeff Allen
He should certainly know all
about that. Allen definitely had his
share of good times on his high
school team and raked up quite a
hit of honors.
Rated a Northwest Nugget and
Red Chip prospect by the Seattle
Times. Allen was listed by USA
Today as an honorable mention
All-American and he won First
Team All-State and All-Area hon
ors.

During his senior year in high
school, the Capital High three
sport star accounted lor 1.308 total
yards and scored 15 touchdowns,
scored 12 points and pulled in five
rebounds per game on the basket
ball team and had a personal best
of 21 82 seconds in the 200-meter
dash.
I lie last few weeks have certain
ly been a time for Allen to shine. In
Stanford's last two games, losses at
Oregon and Notre Dame. Allen
has caught six passes for 61 yards.
With Walters' return imminent,
however (he was on the field for
two plavs against Notre Dame and
is expected to return this Saturday
against Oregon State). Allen may
play a bit less, but the Cardinal's
tallest wide receiver looks to make
an equally large impact in the
game.
"1 may not have as many oppor
tunities, but they'll be there I'll get
in on a couple plays.
' I've only played three games. I
need to keep working, keep im
proving. There's definitely a long
way to go. There are a lot of things
I can do better."
