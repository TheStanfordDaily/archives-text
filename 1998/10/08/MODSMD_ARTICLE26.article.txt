No charges in KA fight
No suspects have been identified in the Saturday
night Kappa Alpha disturbance. According to Stan
ford Police, however, the KAs are not interested in fil
ing charges against anyone.
"It is always possible that someone may want to file
charges," said Marv Herrington, Stanford police
chief. "Until then, though, we're finished." The KA
police case is closed.
The KA case, though, remains open as a Student
Affairs case.
Computer theft
Another computer has been stolen from a stu
dent's room on the heels of recent computer thefts at
Grove Mayfield and Durand.
This time, the thief, who entered an unlocked room
door in Robinson House on Saturday, Oct. 3, fled with
an Apple 1400CS Powerbook laptop. There are cur
rently no leads or suspects.
Stanford Police encourages students to keep their
rooms locked.
"We think there is a group of people who come in
regularly to check doors," said Marvin Moore, Stan
ford Police captain. "There's enough theft from dorm
rooms that people really need to be conscious about
locking their doors."
Coffee table stolen
Two residents of Slavianskii Dom removed a cof
fee table without permission from Larkin West on Fri
day, Oct. 2. The police received a tip from an eyewit
ness who saw the students loading the table into their
car.
The students were not arrested and no charges
were filed. Larkin just wanted the table returned.
"They probably didn't even view it as stealing,"
Moore said.
The students insisted that they were "borrowing"
the table and were going to return it.
Removing furniture from common dorm areas for
personal use is also against University rules.
Graffiti at Rains
Disparaging graffiti was sighted at Rains Houses
on Thursday, Oct. 1. The graffiti has the possible mak
ing of a hate crime and may have gang affiliation as
well. The crime is still under investigation by Stanford
Police.
To help keep Stanford free from graffiti, the Uni
versity conscientiously removes graffiti as quickly as

possible when it appears. Stanford Police also prose
cute people who are caught vandalizing with graffiti.
Attempted theft at Lagunita
On Sunday, Oct. 4, an individual was arrested dur
ing an attempt to steal equipment from a construction
trailer near Lagunita Court. Stanford police appre
hended one suspect who was waiting in a nearby vehi
cle, but a second suspect seen inside the trailer man
aged to escape on foot. The former was removed from
his vehicle by police at gunpoint.
"We have reason to believe it was a commercial
burglary in progress," said Moore. The case is still
under investigation.
Car burglaries in West Campus
Three cars were either broken into or tampered
with this past week, all near Lagunita and Governor's
Corner.
Thieves stole a cellular phone, cord and adapter
out of an unlocked Honda Accord outside East House
and punched out a lock on a Nissan Maxima near La
gunita on Oct. 1. Two days later, thieves stole several
CDs and a CD player out of the trunk of another
Honda Accord also near Lagunita. Stanford police
believe the burglaries are not connected.
Police warned that it is not a rarity to have cars bro
ken into at Stanford but also said that car burglary is
not a rising trend.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore expressed
concern that people on campus are apathetic. "Many
people see what's going on, but won't take the time to
call [in a crime]," he said.
Obscene phone calls
There were two reported obscene phone calls
placed this past week by the unknown male who iden
tifies himself as "Oscar" and targets primarily women.
These calls are not so much threatening as they are
pranks, according to police. "We classify them as an
noying calls," said Marvin Moore, Stanford police
captain.
Moore added that these prank calls are difficult to
trace because of their random nature; the suspect does
not usually contact the same person twice.
Four bikes taken
Four bikes were reported stolen within the past
week, one each at Robinson, Junipero, Escondido,
and Lagunita.
