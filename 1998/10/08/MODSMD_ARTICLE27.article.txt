Cricket — The Stanford Cricket
team will begin the last tourna
ment of the season this Sunday at
the team's home field at Blackford
High School in Saratoga. The
Bank of India Cup tournament will
give the Stanford team one more
chance to finish the season strong
ly. The match will begin at 11 a.m.
The current season did not
work out as planned for the Cardi
nal, but the upcoming knock-out
tournament should let the team
have one more chance at showing
its real strength. After a convincing
94-run win in its first league game
last April, the team was plagued
with a series of injuries and had
trouble fielding a strong squad.
The cricket season in Northern
California runs from mid-April
through September. The Bank of
India Cup in ()ctober and the play
off tournament in December finish
off the season.
Stanford finished second in the
B division in the 1997 season and
was poised to challenge for a spot

in the A division in 1998. In the
opening tournament of the season
though, a six-a-side format, the
team stumbled out of the starting
blocks and could not repeat as the
tournament champions after being
knocked out in the second round.
In the end, injuries and several
conflicting work commitments
from the team's graduate students
created a difficult season for the
Cardinal. The team finished with a
league record of 3-11 in the North
ern California Cricket League.
However, the team does not feel its
record reflects its talent.
"One thing I'd like to point out
is that Stanford has a great [over
all] record in the NCCL," said
leading batsman Atul Khanzode.
"I am sure that we will be a force to
reckon with again next year."
Many of the players have
played in their home countries,
several at high levels of select
teams. Khanzode first began to
play cricket in Nagpur, India. He
went on to captain his college team
in India, played while a masters'
student at Duke, and now contin
ues his playing at Stanford.

"In India cricket is as popular as
basketball is in the U. 5.," Khan
zode said. "Everybody wants to be
a cricketer and it is played all over
the country with a lot of passion."
Also bringing in superb play
for the Cardinal is native Aus
tralian Marcus Stoodley. Stood
ley. while not taking his time on
the cricket pitch, is a member of
the Stanford Hospital Medical
Center in the division of neuro
surgery. He has played high-level
cricket in Australia which adds
greatly to the talent found on the
Stanford team.
Team captain Rohan Chandran
was not only selected to the under
-25 Northern California representa
tive team, but was chosen to cap
tain the side as well. The all-star
team went on to play Southern
California and won quite easily.
The Bank of India Cup begins
this Sunday and will be played
again on each successive weekend
for three weeks. The Cardinal
team is looking to use the tourna
ment as a means of setting the
precedence for the 1999 season.
"We're looking for a much bet

ter showing," Chandran said, "not
least because we should have a few
of our players back. We are hoping
to salvage something out of this
season."
Mountain Biking — The Stan
ford mountain biking squad con
tinued its fast start in the collegiate
season this past weekend in Chico.
Except for the host school, Chico
State, the Cardinal fielded the
largest squad at the meet with 18
riders competing. These riders
were spread among five different
categories.
Despite the muddy riding con
ditions, many of the Stanford rid
ers performed well. At points, rid
ers were forced to pick up their
bikes and carry them.
"[We] had some great results,
despite a brutal course that had us
lug our bikes miles through utterly
unrideable thick, sticky mud," said
co-captain John Bilderbeck.
Rookie rider Suzanne Lee stole
the show for the Cardinal though.
Lee has only been mountain riding
since last spring and this weekend ,
in her first mountain race ever,
captured first place.
