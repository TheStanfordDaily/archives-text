# Chinese dissident speaks on prison life
## 
### Rachel Turow 
C hinese dissident Fan Shidong
spoke to a small but interested audi
ence yesterday about his experi
ences as a political prisoner in
China.
Fan came to the United States
last year after spending 11 years in
the Chinese prison system, eight and
a half of them in Xinjiang, the most
feared prison in all of China.
Fan was arrested in 1983 after
having been repeatedly observed
talking with American officials. He
was convicted for selling secrets to
the United States.
However, as Fan articulated in
his talk, "many people are charged
for minor crimes, but are convicted
based on their political beliefs."
Fan's seminar, titled "My Per
sonal Experiences in a Chinese
Labor Camp,"was held in Lane His
tory Corner in a question-and-an
swer format. Stanley Lubman, a
consulting professor at the Law
School, mediated questions be
tween the audience and Fan's inter
preter about Fan's experience.
Since his imprisonment. Fan has
become an expert on the Chinese
prison system. Most of his work fo
cuses on the "laogai" prison labor
system, where the prisoners are no
longer citizens of the state.
Contrary to popular belief. Fan
said Chinese prisoners do not heavily
contribute to the national economy.
According to Fan, prisoners in Chi
nese labor camps produce no more
than one one-thousandth of the en
tire gross domestic product of China.
Many of the facts that Fan dis
cussed in his seminar dispute those
that have been published by Chinese
activist Harry Wu. Fan spends a
great deal of time researching and
disproving the facts that Wu dispers
es to governments around the world.
In Fan's opinion, Wu tends to

sensationalize the issues in China in
order to make a larger impact when
asking for monetary help to influ
ence change in the Chinese govern
ment. Fan wrote a six-part editorial
series on this topic called "Shatter
ing Harry Wu's Western Funhouse
Mirror," which can be found on the
Web at http://heather.cs.ucdavis
.edu/crrc.html.
In his editorial. Fan wrote: "Why
is it that the world's foremost laogai
'expert' can't get his numbers
straight? ... Wu usually states that
his figures are estimates, but it is
hard to imagine how he can take
pride in his research, given such a
wide variation in what he reports
from one statement to the next."
Brie Pettigrew, a senior East
Asian Studies major who attended
the seminar, said, "It is good to have
more perspectives on these kinds of
issues so that we don't just take the
facts for granted. We tend to focus
on the most sensationalistic as
pects."
Fan commented on the most re
cent changes that have come about
in the Chinese prison system. While
a prison sentence was previously in
disputable, a recently appointed
court of appeals allows accused citi
zens to bring their cases against the
police and have the charges
dropped.
In addition. Fan discussed the
benefit of donating the organs of ex
ecuted prisoners. Fan said many pris
oners feel that "if they can sell their
organs for profit, it is worthwhile be
cause someone benefits from the
organ, and the family of the deceased
prisoner can get the money."
When asked by an audience
member what he thought about the
American penal system. Fan re
marked, "Overall, it is much better
than the Chinese. But, once I get to
study it more, I might have more
criticisms."
