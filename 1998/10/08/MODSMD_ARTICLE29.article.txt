The "Race for the Cure," a
fundraiser event for breast cancer
research, will take place on Oct. 18 in
Golden Gate Park. Recently, a Stan
ford professor studying the causes of
breast cancer was awarded a grant
from the foundation benefited by
the race.
If the hopes of race organizers
hold accurate, 16,000 runners will
gather for the eighth annual race
benefiting the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation.
The Komen Foundation allo
cates grants for research, including
one to Asst. Prof. Atsuko Shibata of
the Medical Center's Department of
Health Research and Policy.
Shibata has begun her study, enti
tled "Prenatal Estrogen Level as a
Risk Factor for Breast Cancer."
"It took me quite a while," she

said, "but [the grant] certainly
helped me to get the study started."
Despite promising new drugs for
breast cancer such as the recently
FDA-approved Herceptin. Shibata
remained cautious about compla
cency.
"I'm not optimistic in a sense that
we will find a drug X as a cure-all,"
she said. "I don't think it will be very
soon that a powerful new drug will
cure most, if not all, breast cancers."
Race organizers expect participa
tion in the 5K run to double with this
year's theme, "Bring a Friend." The
foundation mailed postcards to last
year's runners urging them each to
register a new participant. Increased
promotions and word-of-mouth
communication will likely con
tribute to the projected number as
well, said spokesman Dan Gould.
All proceeds from the race go to
the Komen Foundation.

"The Komen Foundation is a vol
unteer organization devoted to rais
ing and allocating funds for research,
education, screening and treatment
with the intent of eradicating breast
cancer," said Betsy Oleskic,
spokeperson for Sally Coates. exec
utive race director for the founda
tion.
Nationwide, the foundation,
started by Susan Komen's sister in
memory of Komen's death, has
raised over $65 million since 1982.
Now, 86 US cities hold Race For The
Cure event during the year. Timing
for the San Francisco race coincides
with October as Breast Cancer
Awareness Month.
Last year's San Francisco Race
For The Cure netted $500,000.
which the foundation allocated to
various Bay Area breast cancer pro
grams and organizations, including
UCSF's mobile mammography van.

The van will offer walk-in mammo
gram screening the day of the race.
The American Cancer Society es
timates 178.7(X) new cases of breast
cancer for 1998 and 43,9(X) deaths
due to breast cancer. Although the
rate of new cases per year has de
clined since the 1980s. Coates and
others continue to educate women.
"People are becoming increas
ingly aware [of breast cancer] at a
much younger age," said Oleskic.
Women are much more likely to
develop the disease than men, as are
older women in comparison to
younger women. In a given lifetime,
about one in nine women will devel
op breast cancer.
Participants have the option of
running or walking the five kilome
ters. or else join others in a One Mile
Fun Walk. Those interested can call
1 (8(H)) 698-8699 to receive a regis
tration form.
