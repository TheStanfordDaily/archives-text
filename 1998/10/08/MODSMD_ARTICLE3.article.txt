# Forbes' Lenzner speaks
## 
### Berra Yazar Staff writer 
Imagine experiencing an economic crisis
similar to the Great Depression of the 19305.
According to Robert Lenzner. the possi
bility is real. The national editor of Forbes, a
business magazine, addressed the possibility
of a world-wide financial crisis as a result of
faulty investments in countries abroad. His
speech yesterday was a part of the Hoover
Institution Media Fellow speaker's series.
Len/.ner's talk compared today's eco
nomic crisis to that of similar crises in 1929,
1973-74 and 19<N7. 1 le theorizes that the cur
rent crisis would be the most similar to the

1973-74 crisis because both were caused by
deflation, a loss in monetary value.
"People have been violating what they
learned in Econ 101," Lenzner said, blaming
world investors for the crisis. "People all
over the world have gotten themselves into
an extraordinary jam.
"Even though some international com
panies have lost as much as $8(X) million, no
body has a cohesive idea about what can be
done to remedy the problem," he said.
Lenzner stressed that the repercussions
of Russia's recent stock market crash are not
over yet.
"Many ordinary people have al
ready suffered, and even more will
in the future," he said. "What
would you do if banks couldn't lend
wm the money to buy a house?"
The greatest threat for the U.S.
economy is the possibility of defla
tion spreading from Russia to
South America, according to
I en/ner.

This would cause the Mexican
economy to fail, which would in
turn bring the downfall of the U.S.,
because some of the largest pur
chasers of American goods would
be gone.
"You have a creeping deflation
from the emerging industrial na
tions." Len/ner said. "It's not a
crash, just yet."
He said the cause of the current
crisis lies in the faulty investments
of large private financial organiza
tions that borrow money from

banks.
When these organizations go
bankrupt, the. banks cannot re
trieve the money that they loaned,
he explained. As a result, the banks
come in jeopardy.
Banks should regulate the
amount of money they lend, he
said.
Lenzner named greed ingrained
in human nature as the greatest
cause for bad loans and the corrup
tion of capitalism. He suggested
that many investors need psycho

logical treatment.
"The major companies that big
institutions own are in danger." he
said. "When these companies close
down, unemployment would in
crease. bringing the danger to each
household around the globe. Mid
dle-class families are starving today
in Indonesia.
"The amount of economic
growth may go down to zero to 1
percent." Lenzner predicted.
"Lower interest rates will soften
the world economy."

As a journalist. Lenzner is in
constant contact with the greatest
names in the U.S. economy. Al
though he said most of his ideas
about economy come from these
economists, investors in yester
day's audience often asked Lenzn
er for his personal advice to over
come the crisis.
"But I'm just a journalist,"
Lenzner said. "I'm not here to give
investment advice!"
Nevertheless, he said. "If you
want to be absolutely secure, invest

your money in short- term treasury
funds."
Lenzner was an investment
banker at Wall Street before he be
came a business journalist in 1971.
He also worked as a business writer
for The Boston Globe, The Econo
mist and The Dallas Morning
News.
The next media fellows will be
conservative author Dinesh
D'Souza on Oct. 14 and New York
Times reporter Richard Stevenson
on Oct. 20.
