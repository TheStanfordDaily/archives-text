Imagine experiencing an economic crisis
similar to the Great Depression of the 19305.
According to Robert Lenzner. the possi
bility is real. The national editor of Forbes, a
business magazine, addressed the possibility
of a world-wide financial crisis as a result of
faulty investments in countries abroad. His
speech yesterday was a part of the Hoover
Institution Media Fellow speaker's series.
Len/.ner's talk compared today's eco
nomic crisis to that of similar crises in 1929,
1973-74 and 19<N7. 1 le theorizes that the cur
rent crisis would be the most similar to the

1973-74 crisis because both were caused by
deflation, a loss in monetary value.
"People have been violating what they
learned in Econ 101," Lenzner said, blaming
world investors for the crisis. "People all
over the world have gotten themselves into
an extraordinary jam.
"Even though some international com
panies have lost as much as $8(X) million, no
body has a cohesive idea about what can be
done to remedy the problem," he said.
Lenzner stressed that the repercussions
of Russia's recent stock market crash are not
over yet.
