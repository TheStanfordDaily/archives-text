THUR/8
Kenneth Baker, art critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, will lecture on "The Grave Outdoors: To
and From Walter De Maria's Lightning Field." Located in the desert of New Mexico, De Maria's piece
is comprised of a grid created by 440 vertical stainless steel poles, each standing approximately 220
feet tall covering a one-mile by one-kilometer area. Of the piece, Baker has written, "The most vivid
sensation one has on arriving at the Lightning Field is of having left the world behind [The poles)
invoke the vast collective projects of science and technology." The lecture is free and open to the pub
lic. The talk begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Cummings Art Building; call 723-3788 for information.
Dance
SUN/11
Twelve musicians on original Turkish instruments set the mood. Then, the blind hofiz, who
knows the entire Koran by memory, chants the sacred verses of Rumi. Kettle drums break the
silence and a single reed flute begins a musical prelude. Dropping dark cloaks to reveal billowing
white skirts, 12 dancers begin a steady spin. This expression of spiritual ecstasy, love, music and
dance — the Whirling Ceremony of Sema — is coming to Stanford. Tickets range from $28-22,
with a 30 percent discount for students. The performance is at 2:30 p.m. at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium; call 725-ARTS for tickets and information.
