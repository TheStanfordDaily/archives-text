## 'Solo: Women Singer-Songwriters in Their Own Words' 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
"At some point we all need to hear our own thoughts resonating in another per
son's words so we can understand that each of us is not alone."
— Sarah McLachlan
A ngry. Interchangeable. Fake. Women singer-songwriters are getting a bad
ZArap these days, but ironically they are more popular than ever. After
JL VSarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour, audiences and critics alike are trying to
place women singer-songerwriters into the context of the music industry.
Where do they belong? What are they trying to say? "Solo" attempts to give
some of these singers a chance to share the true experiences behind their
music. The book features autobiographical sketches by such songwriters as
Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan and Cassandra Wilson.
While reading this book I could not ignore its personal resonance. I proba
bly would not have gotten through the awkwardness of adolescence without
the music made by these women. Some people had Pearl Jam, but 1 had Sheryl
Crow's "I Shall Believe" and Sarah McLachlan's "Good Enough."
Hearing their loneliness, their strength and vulnerability, I allowed my own
fear and confusion to surface until 1 found a strength of my own. In a sense, I
borrowed their strength. This is why when 1 read these autobiographical
sketches, I feel a sense of completion.
This book is truthful. Why? Because while these women are often portrayed
as strong, even angry, here they are vulnerable. Ani DiFranco, for example,
shares the angry responses she received from the lesbian community after she
fell in love with a man. She reveals her fear of falling in love after seeing her
self for so long as such an isolated individual.
Rather than promoting a political agenda, these women share their person
al agendas. They are not all stuck on the pain and anger of life. Each is search
ing for a way to bliss. Mary Chapin Carpenter talks about her love for her dogs;
Joan Osborne talks about renting a summer house in the country.
These women all talk about their families, their influences, their loves. Each

shares musical influences from her childhood. Shawn Colvin talks about trying
to be a Beatle when she was young; Cassandra Wilson talks about discovering Miles
Davis at the age of seven.
Most of all, the women talk about making music — the process of having an
image, a feeling or an idea and transforming it into song, into poetry. Some, like Sarah
McLachlan, claim that they can only write about their own experiences. Others, like
Cassandra Wilson, say that sometimes they write about places and situations they
have never experienced.
Each talks about the method of songwriting as poetry, as creating rhythm. These
songwriters not only have extraordinary imaginations, but also possess the insight to
root their creations in the accessible form of pop music. That is what makes their

words, and their music, so real to us.
Besides each autobiographical sketch, the book features pictures of each singer taken
by Emma Dodge Hanson. Some look glamorous; some look awkward and very real. The
informal pictures show the beauty of each in the wondering eyes and anxious mouths.
On the surface, this book seems like it would promote some sort of feminist girl
power agenda, ending up as a set of cheesy autobios right next to "Hanson: The True
Story," or as a marketing ploy that promises more than it delivers.
But let's not overanalyze. In between the covers, this book does not have a political
goal. It shares. And as I discovered when 1 read "Solo," these women are not trying to
be people who they are not. But the real self each shares does not disappoint.
