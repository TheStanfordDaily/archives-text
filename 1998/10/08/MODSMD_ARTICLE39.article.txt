## Confessions of diva An interview with Janice Watson 
### Benjamin N. Lawrance Staff writer 
The highlight of my first visit to the Bay
Area was not the verdant landscaping or
the mock Spanish architecture of
Stanford, but the dulcet voice of a singular
young soprano from London echoing
through the War Memorial Opera House
in San Francisco. In a semi-staged produc
tion of Richard Strauss' "Daphne," Janice
Watson made her stateside debut and won
the hearts of thousands of operagoers
from the San Francisco area and beyond.
With admiration and ethusiasm border
ing almost on authentic groupieness, I have
followed the career of Ms. Watson from
strength to strength. From San Francisco to
London to Paris, her performances are rich
and stirring beyond words. And now I find
myself living and studying here, just as Ms.
Watson returns to perform her criticaily
acclaimed interpretation of the title role in
Richard Strauss' "Arabella."
When we met in her dressing room last
month, I discovered that she had not for
gotten the pint of ale we shared in Cardiff,
Wales, on my 19th birthday. Then she
explained to me the complicated ins and
outs of "Lucia di Lammermoor," and now
she graciously agreed to an interview.
I asked her how she felt returning to San
Francisco Opera after six years' absence and
what she liked about the area. "1 am not a
city person really," she replied. Being away
from your husband and family can be a try
ing experience lor anyone, but Watson is
fortunate to have had regular visitors. Her
parents had just dropped in for a two-week
stay, and earlier she and her vacationing
husband had time to visit Yosemite.
But she gleefully acknowledged the
welcome she's received has been tremen
dous and supportive. "SFO is such a pres
tigious opera company," she said, and its
productions generate such interest.
Moreover, "The reviewers here offer such
useful and positive criticism," so most
singers enjoy performing with the SFO.
Since "Daphne," six years ago, the opera
house has undergone a $70-million refur
bishment which has made a world of a dif
ference to cast and crew alike. Working
with David F.dwards, the director, has
been rewarding for Watson. "David is —
how would you say? — very open," she
said. "He's simply open to suggestion and
lets you tlow into the role." This is impor
tant, she explained, "because a character
like Arabella is part of you." Fdwards has a

unique approach to artists. Searching for
the right words, Watson suggested his
approach is "like linking it through you,
into the role, so that everything you do
and sing comes from the inside."
Watson has established herself as one of
the world's most exciting new Germanic
sopranos, with particular emphasis on
Strauss and Mozart. She thinks there's
something very special about Strauss.
While all operatic characters develop
through the music and performance, "In
Strauss there's an almost physical transfor
mation of character and music," she said.
Outstanding German singers are a rarity
today, and Watson has set her sights on Eva
in "Die Meistersanger," Marschallin from
"Der Rosenkavalier" and perhaps even
"Capriccio." And while she jokes about the
occasional terrible tongue-twisters in
Hofmannstal's libretti, one cannot fault
her command of German, nor her diction.
Her goals and career path are something

in which SFO Artistic Director, Lofti
Mansouri, takes a keen interest And it's
hardly surprising. Watson's attention to
acting and timing is rare and remarkable.
In "Arabella," the pompous tale of a young
girl's awakening to womanhood and her
entrance into Viennese society, her churlish
girlishness in the first act is visibly absent in
the final scenes. Yet Watson is not beholden
to solely dramatic roles. It is hard to forget
her hilariously delicate treatment of
Mozart's "La Finta Giardinera" in Tim
Albery's Welsh National Opera production.
More important though, Watson sees her
self moving steadily toward solidifying her
family life. After 15 years with her husband,
they think more and more about having
children. "You have to make time (for chil
dren]," she explained. You can't "just rush
into things and not think ... It's as much a
strategic decision as it is a loving one," she
said. Perhaps the image of Watson astride a
motorbike, flying down the English motor

ways from her new home in Guildford to the
seaside town of Brighton is a humorous one,
but this and other anecdotes betray an
unswerving devotion to her family.
To her fans and to future singers she
offers compelling advice: "Whatever you
do, you must live as well as pursue your
career." Reflecting on some of the more
startling demises of divas of late, she said,
"Having only a career is not a life. Family
and friends are just as important." It's vital
"not to rush, but to hold your balance" on
both, and she thinks music keeps too
many people above normal life.
I couldn't agree more with Watson's
advice. Watson comes across as one of the
most earnest, confident and considerate
artists I have ever had the pleasure to inte
view. Since our first meeting years ago in
her dressing room, during the intermis
sion before her climatic mad scene in
"Lucia di Lammermoor," she has not lost
sight of her fans, her family or her career.
