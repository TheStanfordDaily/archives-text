# Psychiatry prof's battle continues
## Pfefferbaum sues for back pay, return of fine 
### Lindsay Stamm 
Former Medical Center neurological re
searcher Adolf Pfefferbaum has filed a lawsuit
contesting his punishment by the University
for leaving his post at the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
In August. University President Gerhard
Casper issued a $20,000 fine and a three-year
suspension upon recommendation of the Ad
visory Board (composed of Stanford faculty
members) for Plefferbaum's violation of his
contract at the VA Hospital.
Under protest, Pfefferbaum paid his fine
two days before the Oct. I due date.
Pfefferbaum's latest filing argues that the
University falsely accused him of neglecting
his duties by retiring from the VA Hospital.
Pfeffebaum said he wants the fine returned,
$55,231 in back pay and the $ 175,988 he would

have been entitled to as principal investigator
of a National Institute of Health funded schiz
ophrenia study
Tom Fenner, senior university counsel,
said he believes that the Advisory Hoard's rec
ommendation will be upheld in court.
"Professor Pfefferbaum was judged by a
body of his peers to have neglected his acade
mic duty," Fenner said. "That senior faculty
body recommended sanctions that were im
posed on him. The process was a lengthy and
fair one, and we are confident that the decision
will be upheld hv the court."
This ongoing battle began when Pfeffer
baum lodged complaints regarding the VA
Hospital in 1995. Pfefferbaum hoped to con
tinue his work as a faculty member of the
School of Medicine, but wished to discontinue
his work at the VA Hospital.
