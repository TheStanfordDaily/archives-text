# Psychiatry prof's battle continues
## Pfefferbaum sues for back pay, return of fine 
### Lindsay Stamm 
Former Medical Center neurological re
searcher Adolf Pfefferbaum has filed a lawsuit
contesting his punishment by the University
for leaving his post at the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
In August. University President Gerhard
Casper issued a $20,000 fine and a three-year
suspension upon recommendation of the Ad
visory Board (composed of Stanford faculty
members) for Plefferbaum's violation of his
contract at the VA Hospital.
Under protest, Pfefferbaum paid his fine
two days before the Oct. I due date.
Pfefferbaum's latest filing argues that the
University falsely accused him of neglecting
his duties by retiring from the VA Hospital.
Pfeffebaum said he wants the fine returned,
$55,231 in back pay and the $ 175,988 he would

have been entitled to as principal investigator
of a National Institute of Health funded schiz
ophrenia study
Tom Fenner, senior university counsel,
said he believes that the Advisory Hoard's rec
ommendation will be upheld in court.
"Professor Pfefferbaum was judged by a
body of his peers to have neglected his acade
mic duty," Fenner said. "That senior faculty
body recommended sanctions that were im
posed on him. The process was a lengthy and
fair one, and we are confident that the decision
will be upheld hv the court."
This ongoing battle began when Pfeffer
baum lodged complaints regarding the VA
Hospital in 1995. Pfefferbaum hoped to con
tinue his work as a faculty member of the
School of Medicine, but wished to discontinue
his work at the VA Hospital.
In 19%, Pfefferbaum retired
from his position at the VA Hospi
tal. In doing so, the University
claimed that Pfefferbaum also re
tired from his tenured faculty posi
tion at Stanford.
In the latest suit filed against the
University, the board and Casper,
specific documentation of the
events leading up to the dispute is
available. It began in February 1995
when Pfefferbaum and two other
faculty working at the VA Hospital
reported instances of misconduct by
fellow faculty at the VA Hospital to
the Dean of Medicine's Office
They complained of an intolera
ble working environment at the VA
Hospital because of "the use of abu
sive, intemperate, profane and hu
miliating language to fellow faculty
members "

They charged that this created
"an environment of fear, intimida
tion and threat of retaliation against
faculty members, treating any dis
cussion and questioning as insubor
dination in violation of their rights
of academic freedom."
The University's contract with
Medical School faculty specifies
that, while working at the VA Hos
pital, faculty are still under the aus
pices of Stanford University. Those
stipulations are set forth in the Fac
ulty Handbook.
Stanford's School of Medicine
has conducted a substantial portion
of its teaching and training in con
junction with the VA Hospital.
Pfefferbaum argued previously
that his rights of free academic ex
pression and dissent without fear of
retaliation — rights guaranteed
under the Statements of Policy on
Academic Freedom and Grievance
Procedures — were being violated.
The suspension of a tenured con

tract is the most serious action taken
against a tenured faculty member
since English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, was
fired in 1972 for encouraging anti-
Vietnam War violence on campus.
Pfefferbaum, a nationally recog
nized schizophrenia researcher, was
one of the most highly funded pro
fessors in the Medical School. He
brought approximately $1.7 million
ofNIH funding per year to Stanford.
Pfefferbaum had been the princi
pal investigator for a $1-million fed
erally funded schizophrenia study.
Much to Pfefferbaum's dismay, a
new principal investigator was ap
pointed soon after Pfefferbaum's re
tirement. Early last year a judge or
dered Stanford to reinstate Pfeffer
baum as the leader of the study, but
Pfefferbaum remains on suspen
sion.
Pfefferbaum is currently a re
searcher at SRI International in
Menlo Park.
