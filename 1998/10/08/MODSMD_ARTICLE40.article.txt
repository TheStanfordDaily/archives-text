## Rhapsody in hot pink A 						review of San Francisco Opera's latest production 
### 
San Francisco Opera's 1998-99 season
opens with a striking rendition of
Giacoino Puccini's "Turandot." The bril
liant colors and foreboding staging are
the hallmark of director David Hockney.
The cast and orchestra came together in
an impressive performance of this
Orientalist tragedy set in the Forbidden
City of Peking.
"Turandot," incomplete upon the
death of Puccini, but finished by Franco
Alfano and Arturo Toscanini, quickly
bccame standard repertoire in opera
houses throughout the world. The com
plex score combines choruses of Verdian
magnitude — absent from so many of
Puccini's earlier operas — with the
spellbinding Wagnerian dramatisni of
the character of Turandot herself.
In the Imperial Palace the crowds await
the execution of the Prince of Persia. He

has failed to answer the three riddles
posed by the ruthless Princess Turandot
(Gabriele Schnaut), and is following in
the footsteps of her many other suitors.
Elsewhere, Calaf (Richard Margison),
recently reunited with his father, King
Timur (Francesco Ellero D'Artegna),
catches a glimpse of the Princess and falls
madly in love. Despite the protestations of
his father and of their faithful slave girl
Liu (Andrea Dankova),an incognito Calaf
schemes to win her cruel competition and
with it her love.
But the opera is not all doom and
gloom. The light-hearted antics of the
Princess' courtiers, Ping, Pang and Pong
(Earlc Patriarco, Dennis Petersen,
Matthew Lord), diffuse the entire affair.
When they are not trying to fool the
young Calaf, they are nostalgic for their
hometowns, or prostrating themselves

before their all-powerful mistress.
Needless to say, Calaf survives his
ordeal and throws a challenge to the
Princess to discover his identity and thus
preserve her chastity. Liu slays herself to
protect Calaf, and this tragedy awakens
Turandot's love for Calaf.
"Turandot" is as unnerving an
Orientalist fantasy as it is a tragedy. An
intelligent, contemporary ' audience
squirms at the racism and cthnoccntrism
poorly veiled as the traditions of Imperial
China. But director Hockney and costume
designer lan Falconer divert our attention
from the opera's political subtext with
such striking visuals as monks robed in
hot pink and leaping acrobats. The final
sets, projections of classical Chinese lur
niture embellishments that become grot
tos, groves and arches shielding the hero,
was truly magical.

Cabriole Schnaut is a dynamic
Princess. Her menacing glances are
matchcd only by her darting movements
and crushed despondency as Margison
draws near to claim his prize. Andrea
Dankova, though seeming a little lost on
the stage, was a memorable Liu, while
Margison delivered a resounding
"Ncssun Dor ma."
Hockney's work is a welcome respite
from the often dry stagings of the San
Francisco theater world, and his rendition
of "Turandot" is warmly recommended.
