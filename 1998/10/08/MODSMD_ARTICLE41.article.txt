## Brecht at Stanford An interview with Aleksandra Wolska 
### Robin Moroney Staff Writer 
Bertolt Brecht remains one of the most
important forces in twentieth-century the
ater. Even if his plays are performed less
and less frequently, the word "Brechtian" is
still considered important enough to be
misused during any serious discussion of
theater. Correctly gargling the consonants
halfway through Brecht's name has proven
to be one of American intellectualisms chief
concerns during this century. (Other thorny
issues include how much "r" to put into
"Sartre," and how to end "Van Gogh")
Bertolt Brecht would have been a hun
dred years old in 1998. To celebrate his cen
tennial, the Stanford Summer Theatre
company is staging "When the Shark Bites,"
an original production that mixes a cabaret
of Brecht/ Weill songs ("Mack the Knife,"
"Pirate Jenny," all the good ones) with a
staging of Brecht's interrogation by the
notorious House Un-American Activities
Committee. The production was conceived
by Aleksandra Wolska (director) and Jarek
Truszczynski (who is playing Brecht), who
also worked together on previous Stanford
productions of "Twelfth Night," "Woyzeck,"
and"The Inspector General." Intermission
recently interviewed Aleksandra Wolska.
Intermission: How did the show
come about?
Aleksandra Wolska: We were asked
by Stanford Drama to do a cabaret of
Brecht / Weill songs. I think they had in
mind a recital of the favorites with some
thing in between. We then had a problem

as to what that something should be.
Jarek came up with the idea of using
the transcript of Brecht's interrogation
and the text to one of his plays, "The
Elephant Calf," which are linked the
matically. The transcript to the hearings
reads like an absurdist play. It's like
lonesco. It's terse. It goes round in cir
cles. He wanted to stay in America, I
think, but he didn't want to betray any
body. Brecht keeps saying that he does
n't understand the question whenever it
suits him. Whenever they point to one
of passages in his plays as demonstrat
ing his communism he'd say, "Well, no,
that's a wrong translation."
Jarek picked about 12 songs with the
intention of performing half of them,
once we'd figured out how to link them
together. This was one of the major chal
lenges. We made the play dreamlike, to
situate it in Brecht's memory, in order to
try to reconcile these different elements.
I: What was the nature of Brecht's
impact on culture?
AW: 1 don't think he had much impact
outside of the theater. Within the theater
his influence is very great indeed. Any
contemporary performance on the stage
is affected by a way of exposing that it is a
performance, and not something else.
I: Did you use many Brechtian tech
niques in the play?
AW: Well, I don't think we used any
purely Brechtian devices, simply ways of
reminding people that it is a performance,

that everything is a condition of circum
stances, and providing enough distance
from what's going on on the stage for
observation with a political element.
I: What is the political element of the
play?
AW: It's the display of the political
machinery of persecution. Of course, on
the surface it would appear that this jars
with the American experience. "The
Elephant Calf," which we used in "When
the Shark Bites," is a play about totalitar
ianism, and I can tell you from personal
experience that living in America feels
very different from living in a totalitari
an state. [Wolska lived in Poland until
the mid-'Bos.] In America, people are
very concerned to get the government
out of their homes; there's a tremendous
fear of government power.
But, on the other hand, you could say
that the very reason that the House Un-
American Activities Committee happened
was because of this fear. The fear of the
totalitarian state, of communism, para
doxically, created an institution that was
totalitarian in its nature. The ease with
which this happened is quite disturbing.

I'm generally not interested in poli
tics in my work. I prefer more human
themes. Brecht's conflicted interests that
are evident in his testimony, I think, are
very interesting. You can see the dilem
ma of having to live in the world and
abide by its rules, but at the same time
not go under ethically.
I: What do you try to achieve with
your plays?
AW: I'm interested in bringing life to
a text. It's kind of fascinating to see the
emergence of a world when there was
nothing there before. I'm fascinated
with the thrill of doing that. I then try to
localize that in a particular play and
drag something out of it.
I do believe that, despite the rights of
interpretation and whatever, that plays
have something to say and I have to bring
that out, as well as whatever 1 have to say
about it. I suppose it's quite unfashionable
to say that there's something intrinsic to a
play that needs to be brought out. But, to
be a little bit more fashionable, 1 might as
well say that it's terribly difficult to know
what that thing is.
