# The 						New York City Ballet
## As great as ever in Berkeley 
### 
The New York City Ballet's reputation
as the finest ballet company in America
proved to be an understatement last
Thursday at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley. It
is almost every young American ballet
dancer's dream to become a member of
this esteemed company, without a doubt
the most selective in the nation. Thursday
night's program, a medley of "Square
Dance," "Barber Violin Concerto,"
"Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux" and"The
Concert" proved why this company is so
magnetic to dancers and audience alike.
"Square Dance" was sheer Balanchine.
Choreographed in 1957, the style is dis
tinctly American. The short ballet lacks a
plot; each phrase of music is simply
accompanied by a dance phrase. Rather
than telling a story, the choreography is a
visual extension of the music.
While the dancing in this piece was the

weakest of the entire program, small touch
es still made it worthwhile. Nilas Martins
was magnificent. His deep, soft plies and
musicality made the male solos a pleasure
to watch. Yvonne Borre was a bit tense and
restrained, but she was technically strong.
One corps de ballet member, Aubrey
Morgan, was especially pristine and smooth
both in her technique and musicality.
"Barber Violin Concerto" was awe
some. Peter Martins, NYCB's artistic
director, choreographed it to show the
conflict between the classical and the wild.
It began with a lyrical pas de deux between
Kyra Nichols and Robert Lyon complete
with tutu, tiara and all the classical trap
pings. Then Elizabeth Walker and jock
Soto appeared as cave people. Walker was
barefoot and frantic-haired, while Soto
wore only tights cut to the knee. They
danced a wild, passionate pas de deux. The

two worlds collided when, Nichols, in her
white tutu, danced with the half-naked
Soto. At the end of the piece, her hair hung
loose and she danced in abandonment,
wrapping her body around his torso.
The "Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux," also
choreographed by Balanchine, was quite
short but extremely well done. It is a vir
tuoso technical piece in which the two
dancers show off their abilities. The
dancers of the piece, Wendy Whelean and
Charles Askegard, were physically and
stylistically strong, dancing the traditional
pas de deux with flair.
The final piece, "The Concert," choreo
graphed by Jerome Robbins was absolutely
brilliant. The ballet is an elaborate charade
of a concert. A piano sat in the right corner
of the stage; the ballet began with the pianist
entering, bowing and sitting down to play
Chopin. As he played, the dancers entered

one by one in black glasses, suspenders and
wide striped ties, each one gradually supple
menting the "audience" on stage.
From there it became an elaborate
inside joke that played off of everyone's
expectations. Not only did the dancers do
hilarious imitations of audience etiquette
— making too much noise, mocking the
arrogance of wealthier patrons — they
mocked themselves, dancing a ballet of
blunders. The entire scene had the audito
rium in stitches.
All in all, 1 have never laughed so much
at the ballet or enjoyed such a dazzling
evening. The dancers, musicians, choreog
raphers, lighting and costumes were truly
thrilling, showing that a performance of
the New York City Ballet is still an event
not to be missed.
