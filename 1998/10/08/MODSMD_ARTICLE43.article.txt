## You oughta be making pictures 
### Meredith Alexander Contributing writer 
The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.

organization that will be around for many years to come."
Gangadharan credits the SFS with fostering her
involvement in film studies and production. She discov
ered that the Bay Area "is a really ripe area to be making
film and curating film programs." Today, Gangadharan
has a full-time job with the Independent Media Institute,
a non-profit umbrella organization that supports media
across the board. She's definitely caught the film bug. Her
other major project is to write a book called "Hollywood
Archaeology," about a compilation of footage collected
from Hollywood studios by artist Lowell Darling.
Considering that it costs from $1,000 to $1,200 just to
screen a film at Stanford, Levitt believes that "we've defi
nitely come a long way. That shouldn't overshadow the
fact that we have a long way to go." One of the priorities
of the SFS is giving grants to student filmmakers, but the
high cost of producing a film limits this practice. -
Shortz! makes students into filmmakers
Despite the expense of its events, SFS still finds room
in its budget to sponsor small film production grants,
many of which go to members of Shortz!, a student group

centered on providing support to student
filmmakers. David Starke, a senior major
ing in Symbolic Systems, was one of the
first members of this group founded by
Mark Lipawen, a 1995 alumni, two years
ago. Starke has made two films with this
collaborative group, the first in video for
mat and the second using 8 mm film.
Starke explains that after an initial selec
tion of student participants, the group
began meeting in the fall quarter to write
scripts and offer each other peer reviews of
their work. In the winter, they conducted
auditions for actors and started filming.
The entire process required teamwork.
"My film was closest to an action-adven
ture," Starke says."It was about this spy per-

son, and it was set on campus. I based it on a person I knew
who used to dramatize her life." The film, called "Carter!"
originally took up 2 hours of video, which Starke cut down
to a 12-minute short. Last year, Starke produced and co
directed another film with another friend. "Lines of
Direction" focused on dancing and featured original music.
This time, Starke filmed approximately 40 minutes and cut
it down to only 5.
"I had a grant from SFS to cover film and develop
ment, which was nice because it ended up costing $500,"
Starke said.
This year, Shortz! may branch out into 16 mm, the film
format used by professionals. "I think we're all going to
collaborate. It's a big step — more expensive and more
complicated. In video, you can play around a lot," but
with 16 mm, every frame costs more time and money. But
the product is remarkably superior. "I was a photograph
er, and that makes a difference to me," says Starke.
After purchasing a nonlinear digital editing machine,
Shortz! has been able to produce films that Starke says he
finds "really impressive." Plus, students get experience
using professional equipment. Starke doesn't think he'll
go on to be a film director or editor, but he's glad he got
to work like the pros. "Making films gives you a whole
new perspective," he said.
Celine Parrenas, one of Stanford's filmmakers
Oline Salazar Parreflas is a combination film scholar
and independent filmmaker who is studying in the
Program in Modern Thought and Literature. As an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, Parrefias began to pursue

her interest in ethnic studies and film. She then went on
to attend the UCLA School of Film and TV, earning a
Master of Fine Arts in Directing.
Parrefias' 30-minute thesis film, "Super Flip" was
deeply rooted in Filipino-American history and culture.
Parrefias describes her work as "experimental," and it
explores some uncomfortable themes: She is a feminist
filmmaker who wishes to uncover the workings of gender
in Filipino immigrant society.
Parrefias unites the techniques of narrative and docu
mentary filmmaking in her own experimental style. "In
the first, pre-production part of the process," she
explained, "1 do a kind of sociological interview project,
where I identify a certain sector of people that I'm mak
ing a film about and of. It's tended to be the Filipino-
American community or the immigrant community in
San Francisco."
"Super Flip" 's origins are in a very specific local com
munity. "I focused on the Filipino-American low-wage
workers who work in the Union Square area," Parrefias
says."From walking around that area, I came to realize
that Filipinos really constitute the low-wage work-force of
this city, and in some ways you could make the argument

that they are the backbone of the city. So I went to talk to
as many people as possible, just walking into stores, get
ting a feeling of how they get to a place where they can
cope with the everyday colonization of their bodies."
Parrenas views film as a way to develop discussion, as
an act rather than a product, as a cultural critique rather
than a commodity. She is especially sensitive to her posi
tion as a filmmaker giving voice to a particular group of
people: "I tried to speak of the community, but also as
someone standing within the community." Like the SFS,
she tries to spark dialogues. After her films are screened,
"there's usually a huge Q & A — it's two hours long, and
they tend to be really intense." Parrenas remarks that "a
film is its own person, and it comes to be in conversation
with its audience."
Parrenas is not surprised that students at Stanford are
starting to take a more active interest in film and its pro
duction. Today, "It is the medium that reaches the most
people, in this postmodern era, where there's definitely a
visual turn, where a lot less people do the reading. It's
almost unavoidable for the smart people who are at
Stanford to want to use this." She's hopeful that Stanford
can be a place for new voices in film, uncorrupted by
Hollywood's obsession with the box office.
Parrenas would like to see the experience of filmmaking
opened up to a more diverse set of people. "Directing is
something that a lot of people, I hope a lot of women, will
get to do. Because it's one of the greatest pleasures in life.
And 1 hope that women get to do it much more," she said.
It's not hard to explain the dearth of women in the
Hollywood film industry. "It tends to be a technical
industry, and there tend to be a lot of men who occupy

those positions, and you have to be a certain kind of
woman to do it. You have to be vicious. Can people han
dle being told what to do by a woman on a set? Can peo
ple handle seeing things from a woman's perspective,
without turning it into a kind of masculinist fantasy?"
Parrefias asked.
Parrefias' work as a woman of color makes her a part of
a wider film community that is just beginning to thrive,
yet for whom it can be hard to find funding. She warns
that schmoozing with the Hollywood bigwigs can be
rough: "You have to be really charming even if they treat
you like a cockroach."
Documentary Film — Stanford's hidden treasure
Stanford's Program in Documentary Film is far from
the world of Hollywood. This two-year graduate program
is the only one in the country that focuses exclusively on
documentary filmmaking. Jan Krawitz, the head of the
program, defends this focus: "We cannot be all things to
all people, and we don't want to be. The people who apply
to the program come here because they want that."
Many of the students, according to Krawitz, have back-

grounds in social service and social policy.
They have come to the documentary medi
um in order to express things that they can
not show other ways. Film is their "means
to explore social issues," Krawitz says. She
adds that the program accepts around 10
students a year, none of whom has formal
ly studied film production.
Krawitz asserts that the Documentary
Film Program is "very integrated into the
larger Bay Area film community," although
there are few signs of the program on cam
pus. It resides in the Communication
Department, but many undergrads and
graduate students in other departments
remain unaware of its presence.
Documentary film student Vanessa

Warhcit commented that "we, the students, are forcing
people to talk to each other" between the departments.
There is no Film Studies major for undergraduates and
little contact between the Art History film scholars and
those involved in the Documentary Film program.
Krawitz explains that the program is intensive and
heavily production-based. But each student is given free
rein to explore the issues that interest him or her.
Students come from many backgrounds. "We have had a
biologist, history master's students, a lawyer, a man who
worked at a center for AIDS prevention. They've all been
out there in the world."
Once they arrive at the program, the students are
expected to work together on critiques of dailies, rough
cuts and Fine cuts. "It's a constant process of built-in feed
back," said Krawitz.
Students start out Filming in 16 mm, which is consid
ered "a little unorthodox these days,' Krawitz said. "It's a
much more expensive, much less forgiving medium."
Students are forced to economize or. their shoots. They
are also instructed in other media. "We feed them a smor
gasbord of choices," said Krawitz, from which they will
select !o make their Final project. Second-year student
I.aura Norton said that her First quarter in the program
was an intense "crazy learning curve," as she was exposed
to the many technical elements of Filmmaking. "It's
exhausting" Norton adrritted.
Warheit remarked that the diversity of the students
leads to a plethora of goals. "We're al! really different.
People go out of it and go in a zillion directions, and peo
ple • ome into it wanting to do a zillion different things."
"Personally," she continued, "I don't want 112« move t<>

L.A. and make movies. That's not my goal. I think a lot of
people are on the fence about whether they want to go on
and do fiction stuff. I'm in the documentary camp. I actu
ally really want to teach."
Norton, on the other hand, came to the program after
spending many years working in feature films and televi
sion in Los Angeles. She graduated from USC with a film
studies major, and is now excited by the very different
focus of the Stanford program. "The thing that I like is
this really amazing blend of journalism and filmmaking"
that is at the center of the documentary style.
Yet there's something slightly unnerving about making
films that probe people's real lives. "Documentary is this
weird world," Norton remarks. "You very aggressively go
into people's lives." She comments that the Stanford pro
gram's atmosphere makes it easier. "It's so supportive. It's
been really valuable for me," she said. In contrast to the
L.A. world of competition, "In our group, everyone loves
to see everyone else succeed. Were like a family."
As in all realms of filmmaking, students can run into
funding issues. "Most of us come out with a lot of debt,"
Warheit says, "which is a really big problem. There's not a
lot of funding and only three TA-ships. We have to pay for
making our films. We do have access to the University's
equipment, which is not state of the art. Thev're finally get
ting digital cameras." Students usually end up funding their
own film projects, which can be expensive, despite product
grants from Kodak and occasional monetary awards.
During their second year in the program, students
learn about computerized editing equipment "and then
we pick a topic and do a 20-minute thesis film." Warheit's
film will focus on Treasure Island, which is off the coast of
San Francisco. The island, she said, "was built in 1937-38
and was the site for the 1939 World's Fair. It was supposed
to be the site for the San Francisco International Airport."
Things went awry when World War II broke out. "The
Navy got nervous, and moved in, 'temporarily,' ostensi
bly." They finally moved out just last year. The city is now
trying to decide what to do with th«* island.
Warheit is seeking a new way to define her filmmaking.
"I'm not making a Ken Burns special," she said.
"I'm going to be including interviews with people who
were at the fair. It'll include archival footage of the lair
and from when the Navy was there. I'm trying to get
interviews of people who were shipped out trom there —
12,000 men a day during the war. I want to get the con
trast of people's memories of that island — people who
went there for fun in 1939 and people who were shipped
out to war."
Warheit and Norton hope that more links can be cre
ated between their program and other parts ot the
Stanford film community. "Someone has to take the ini
tiative," Norton commented, pointing out that she and
Warheit have tried to e-mail information to as many stu
dents as possible.
All these filmmakers face some of the same problems
and have many similar goals. The issue of funding will
never go away, and as long as the product is not a com
mercial one, it will be a problem. Documentary students
learn techniques of grant writing, but worry about not
being able to make ends meet. Stanford undergrads have
only limited access to equipment and funds.
But as more students take the initiative in all of these
realms, more possibilities will open up to the Stanford
community. One ot the best and largely untapped
resources for students is Stanford's proximity to the thriv
ing independent filmmakers ot San Francisco, one of the
most active centers in the nation. Despite obstacles,
Stanford students are in a position to engage with some ot
the most provocative films of the day — those being
made by their peers and their neighbors.
The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.

organization that will be around for many years to come."
Gangadharan credits the SFS with fostering her
involvement in film studies and production. She discov
ered that the Bay Area "is a really ripe area to be making
film and curating film programs." Today, Gangadharan
has a full-time job with the Independent Media Institute,
a non-profit umbrella organization that supports media
across the board. She's definitely caught the film bug. Her
other major project is to write a book called "Hollywood
Archaeology," about a compilation of footage collected
from Hollywood studios by artist Lowell Darling.
Considering that it costs from $1,000 to $1,200 just to
screen a film at Stanford, Levitt believes that "we've defi
nitely come a long way. That shouldn't overshadow the
fact that we have a long way to go." One of the priorities
of the SFS is giving grants to student filmmakers, but the
high cost of producing a film limits this practice. -
Shortz! makes students into filmmakers
Despite the expense of its events, SFS still finds room
in its budget to sponsor small film production grants,
many of which go to members of Shortz!, a student group

centered on providing support to student
filmmakers. David Starke, a senior major
ing in Symbolic Systems, was one of the
first members of this group founded by
Mark Lipawen, a 1995 alumni, two years
ago. Starke has made two films with this
collaborative group, the first in video for
mat and the second using 8 mm film.
Starke explains that after an initial selec
tion of student participants, the group
began meeting in the fall quarter to write
scripts and offer each other peer reviews of
their work. In the winter, they conducted
auditions for actors and started filming.
The entire process required teamwork.
"My film was closest to an action-adven
ture," Starke says."It was about this spy per-

son, and it was set on campus. I based it on a person I knew
who used to dramatize her life." The film, called "Carter!"
originally took up 2 hours of video, which Starke cut down
to a 12-minute short. Last year, Starke produced and co
directed another film with another friend. "Lines of
Direction" focused on dancing and featured original music.
This time, Starke filmed approximately 40 minutes and cut
it down to only 5.
"I had a grant from SFS to cover film and develop
ment, which was nice because it ended up costing $500,"
Starke said.
This year, Shortz! may branch out into 16 mm, the film
format used by professionals. "I think we're all going to
collaborate. It's a big step — more expensive and more
complicated. In video, you can play around a lot," but
with 16 mm, every frame costs more time and money. But
the product is remarkably superior. "I was a photograph
er, and that makes a difference to me," says Starke.
After purchasing a nonlinear digital editing machine,
Shortz! has been able to produce films that Starke says he
finds "really impressive." Plus, students get experience
using professional equipment. Starke doesn't think he'll
go on to be a film director or editor, but he's glad he got
to work like the pros. "Making films gives you a whole
new perspective," he said.
Celine Parrenas, one of Stanford's filmmakers
Oline Salazar Parreflas is a combination film scholar
and independent filmmaker who is studying in the
Program in Modern Thought and Literature. As an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, Parrefias began to pursue

her interest in ethnic studies and film. She then went on
to attend the UCLA School of Film and TV, earning a
Master of Fine Arts in Directing.
Parrefias' 30-minute thesis film, "Super Flip" was
deeply rooted in Filipino-American history and culture.
Parrefias describes her work as "experimental," and it
explores some uncomfortable themes: She is a feminist
filmmaker who wishes to uncover the workings of gender
in Filipino immigrant society.
Parrefias unites the techniques of narrative and docu
mentary filmmaking in her own experimental style. "In
the first, pre-production part of the process," she
explained, "1 do a kind of sociological interview project,
where I identify a certain sector of people that I'm mak
ing a film about and of. It's tended to be the Filipino-
American community or the immigrant community in
San Francisco."
"Super Flip" 's origins are in a very specific local com
munity. "I focused on the Filipino-American low-wage
workers who work in the Union Square area," Parrefias
says."From walking around that area, I came to realize
that Filipinos really constitute the low-wage work-force of
this city, and in some ways you could make the argument

that they are the backbone of the city. So I went to talk to
as many people as possible, just walking into stores, get
ting a feeling of how they get to a place where they can
cope with the everyday colonization of their bodies."
Parrenas views film as a way to develop discussion, as
an act rather than a product, as a cultural critique rather
than a commodity. She is especially sensitive to her posi
tion as a filmmaker giving voice to a particular group of
people: "I tried to speak of the community, but also as
someone standing within the community." Like the SFS,
she tries to spark dialogues. After her films are screened,
"there's usually a huge Q & A — it's two hours long, and
they tend to be really intense." Parrenas remarks that "a
film is its own person, and it comes to be in conversation
with its audience."
Parrenas is not surprised that students at Stanford are
starting to take a more active interest in film and its pro
duction. Today, "It is the medium that reaches the most
people, in this postmodern era, where there's definitely a
visual turn, where a lot less people do the reading. It's
almost unavoidable for the smart people who are at
Stanford to want to use this." She's hopeful that Stanford
can be a place for new voices in film, uncorrupted by
Hollywood's obsession with the box office.
Parrenas would like to see the experience of filmmaking
opened up to a more diverse set of people. "Directing is
something that a lot of people, I hope a lot of women, will
get to do. Because it's one of the greatest pleasures in life.
And 1 hope that women get to do it much more," she said.
It's not hard to explain the dearth of women in the
Hollywood film industry. "It tends to be a technical
industry, and there tend to be a lot of men who occupy

those positions, and you have to be a certain kind of
woman to do it. You have to be vicious. Can people han
dle being told what to do by a woman on a set? Can peo
ple handle seeing things from a woman's perspective,
without turning it into a kind of masculinist fantasy?"
Parrefias asked.
Parrefias' work as a woman of color makes her a part of
a wider film community that is just beginning to thrive,
yet for whom it can be hard to find funding. She warns
that schmoozing with the Hollywood bigwigs can be
rough: "You have to be really charming even if they treat
you like a cockroach."
Documentary Film — Stanford's hidden treasure
Stanford's Program in Documentary Film is far from
the world of Hollywood. This two-year graduate program
is the only one in the country that focuses exclusively on
documentary filmmaking. Jan Krawitz, the head of the
program, defends this focus: "We cannot be all things to
all people, and we don't want to be. The people who apply
to the program come here because they want that."
Many of the students, according to Krawitz, have back-

grounds in social service and social policy.
They have come to the documentary medi
um in order to express things that they can
not show other ways. Film is their "means
to explore social issues," Krawitz says. She
adds that the program accepts around 10
students a year, none of whom has formal
ly studied film production.
Krawitz asserts that the Documentary
Film Program is "very integrated into the
larger Bay Area film community," although
there are few signs of the program on cam
pus. It resides in the Communication
Department, but many undergrads and
graduate students in other departments
remain unaware of its presence.
Documentary film student Vanessa

Warhcit commented that "we, the students, are forcing
people to talk to each other" between the departments.
There is no Film Studies major for undergraduates and
little contact between the Art History film scholars and
those involved in the Documentary Film program.
Krawitz explains that the program is intensive and
heavily production-based. But each student is given free
rein to explore the issues that interest him or her.
Students come from many backgrounds. "We have had a
biologist, history master's students, a lawyer, a man who
worked at a center for AIDS prevention. They've all been
out there in the world."
Once they arrive at the program, the students are
expected to work together on critiques of dailies, rough
cuts and Fine cuts. "It's a constant process of built-in feed
back," said Krawitz.
Students start out Filming in 16 mm, which is consid
ered "a little unorthodox these days,' Krawitz said. "It's a
much more expensive, much less forgiving medium."
Students are forced to economize or. their shoots. They
are also instructed in other media. "We feed them a smor
gasbord of choices," said Krawitz, from which they will
select !o make their Final project. Second-year student
I.aura Norton said that her First quarter in the program
was an intense "crazy learning curve," as she was exposed
to the many technical elements of Filmmaking. "It's
exhausting" Norton adrritted.
Warheit remarked that the diversity of the students
leads to a plethora of goals. "We're al! really different.
People go out of it and go in a zillion directions, and peo
ple • ome into it wanting to do a zillion different things."
"Personally," she continued, "I don't want 112« move t<>

L.A. and make movies. That's not my goal. I think a lot of
people are on the fence about whether they want to go on
and do fiction stuff. I'm in the documentary camp. I actu
ally really want to teach."
Norton, on the other hand, came to the program after
spending many years working in feature films and televi
sion in Los Angeles. She graduated from USC with a film
studies major, and is now excited by the very different
focus of the Stanford program. "The thing that I like is
this really amazing blend of journalism and filmmaking"
that is at the center of the documentary style.
Yet there's something slightly unnerving about making
films that probe people's real lives. "Documentary is this
weird world," Norton remarks. "You very aggressively go
into people's lives." She comments that the Stanford pro
gram's atmosphere makes it easier. "It's so supportive. It's
been really valuable for me," she said. In contrast to the
L.A. world of competition, "In our group, everyone loves
to see everyone else succeed. Were like a family."
As in all realms of filmmaking, students can run into
funding issues. "Most of us come out with a lot of debt,"
Warheit says, "which is a really big problem. There's not a
lot of funding and only three TA-ships. We have to pay for
making our films. We do have access to the University's
equipment, which is not state of the art. Thev're finally get
ting digital cameras." Students usually end up funding their
own film projects, which can be expensive, despite product
grants from Kodak and occasional monetary awards.
During their second year in the program, students
learn about computerized editing equipment "and then
we pick a topic and do a 20-minute thesis film." Warheit's
film will focus on Treasure Island, which is off the coast of
San Francisco. The island, she said, "was built in 1937-38
and was the site for the 1939 World's Fair. It was supposed
to be the site for the San Francisco International Airport."
Things went awry when World War II broke out. "The
Navy got nervous, and moved in, 'temporarily,' ostensi
bly." They finally moved out just last year. The city is now
trying to decide what to do with th«* island.
Warheit is seeking a new way to define her filmmaking.
"I'm not making a Ken Burns special," she said.
"I'm going to be including interviews with people who
were at the fair. It'll include archival footage of the lair
and from when the Navy was there. I'm trying to get
interviews of people who were shipped out trom there —
12,000 men a day during the war. I want to get the con
trast of people's memories of that island — people who
went there for fun in 1939 and people who were shipped
out to war."
Warheit and Norton hope that more links can be cre
ated between their program and other parts ot the
Stanford film community. "Someone has to take the ini
tiative," Norton commented, pointing out that she and
Warheit have tried to e-mail information to as many stu
dents as possible.
All these filmmakers face some of the same problems
and have many similar goals. The issue of funding will
never go away, and as long as the product is not a com
mercial one, it will be a problem. Documentary students
learn techniques of grant writing, but worry about not
being able to make ends meet. Stanford undergrads have
only limited access to equipment and funds.
But as more students take the initiative in all of these
realms, more possibilities will open up to the Stanford
community. One ot the best and largely untapped
resources for students is Stanford's proximity to the thriv
ing independent filmmakers ot San Francisco, one of the
most active centers in the nation. Despite obstacles,
Stanford students are in a position to engage with some ot
the most provocative films of the day — those being
made by their peers and their neighbors.
The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.
Ga>ig.idharan said, "This is a pretty crucial year in

organization that will be around for many years to come."
Gangadharan credits the SFS with fostering her
involvement in film studies and production. She discov
ered that the Bay Area "is a really ripe area to be making
film and curating film programs." Today, Gangadharan
has a full-time job with the Independent Media Institute,
a non-profit umbrella organization that supports media
across the board. She's definitely caught the film bug. Her
other major project is to write a book called "Hollywood
Archaeology," about a compilation of footage collected
from Hollywood studios by artist Lowell Darling.
Considering that it costs from $1,000 to $1,200 just to
screen a film at Stanford, Levitt believes that "we've defi
nitely come a long way. That shouldn't overshadow the
fact that we have a long way to go." One of the priorities
of the SFS is giving grants to student filmmakers, but the
high cost of producing a film limits this practice. -
Shortz! makes students into filmmakers
Despite the expense of its events, SFS still finds room
in its budget to sponsor small film production grants,
many of which go to members of Shortz!, a student group

centered on providing support to student
filmmakers. David Starke, a senior major
ing in Symbolic Systems, was one of the
first members of this group founded by
Mark Lipawen, a 1995 alumni, two years
ago. Starke has made two films with this
collaborative group, the first in video for
mat and the second using 8 mm film.
Starke explains that after an initial selec
tion of student participants, the group
began meeting in the fall quarter to write
scripts and offer each other peer reviews of
their work. In the winter, they conducted
auditions for actors and started filming.
The entire process required teamwork.
"My film was closest to an action-adven
ture," Starke says."It was about this spy per-

son, and it was set on campus. I based it on a person I knew
who used to dramatize her life." The film, called "Carter!"
originally took up 2 hours of video, which Starke cut down
to a 12-minute short. Last year, Starke produced and co
directed another film with another friend. "Lines of
Direction" focused on dancing and featured original music.
This time, Starke filmed approximately 40 minutes and cut
it down to only 5.
"I had a grant from SFS to cover film and develop
ment, which was nice because it ended up costing $500,"
Starke said.
This year, Shortz! may branch out into 16 mm, the film
format used by professionals. "I think we're all going to
collaborate. It's a big step — more expensive and more
complicated. In video, you can play around a lot," but
with 16 mm, every frame costs more time and money. But
the product is remarkably superior. "I was a photograph
er, and that makes a difference to me," says Starke.
After purchasing a nonlinear digital editing machine,
Shortz! has been able to produce films that Starke says he
finds "really impressive." Plus, students get experience
using professional equipment. Starke doesn't think he'll
go on to be a film director or editor, but he's glad he got
to work like the pros. "Making films gives you a whole
new perspective," he said.
Celine Parrenas, one of Stanford's filmmakers
Oline Salazar Parreflas is a combination film scholar
and independent filmmaker who is studying in the
Program in Modern Thought and Literature. As an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, Parrefias began to pursue

her interest in ethnic studies and film. She then went on
to attend the UCLA School of Film and TV, earning a
Master of Fine Arts in Directing.
Parrefias' 30-minute thesis film, "Super Flip" was
deeply rooted in Filipino-American history and culture.
Parrefias describes her work as "experimental," and it
explores some uncomfortable themes: She is a feminist
filmmaker who wishes to uncover the workings of gender
in Filipino immigrant society.
Parrefias unites the techniques of narrative and docu
mentary filmmaking in her own experimental style. "In
the first, pre-production part of the process," she
explained, "1 do a kind of sociological interview project,
where I identify a certain sector of people that I'm mak
ing a film about and of. It's tended to be the Filipino-
American community or the immigrant community in
San Francisco."
"Super Flip" 's origins are in a very specific local com
munity. "I focused on the Filipino-American low-wage
workers who work in the Union Square area," Parrefias
says."From walking around that area, I came to realize
that Filipinos really constitute the low-wage work-force of
this city, and in some ways you could make the argument

that they are the backbone of the city. So I went to talk to
as many people as possible, just walking into stores, get
ting a feeling of how they get to a place where they can
cope with the everyday colonization of their bodies."
Parrenas views film as a way to develop discussion, as
an act rather than a product, as a cultural critique rather
than a commodity. She is especially sensitive to her posi
tion as a filmmaker giving voice to a particular group of
people: "I tried to speak of the community, but also as
someone standing within the community." Like the SFS,
she tries to spark dialogues. After her films are screened,
"there's usually a huge Q & A — it's two hours long, and
they tend to be really intense." Parrenas remarks that "a
film is its own person, and it comes to be in conversation
with its audience."
Parrenas is not surprised that students at Stanford are
starting to take a more active interest in film and its pro
duction. Today, "It is the medium that reaches the most
people, in this postmodern era, where there's definitely a
visual turn, where a lot less people do the reading. It's
almost unavoidable for the smart people who are at
Stanford to want to use this." She's hopeful that Stanford
can be a place for new voices in film, uncorrupted by
Hollywood's obsession with the box office.
Parrenas would like to see the experience of filmmaking
opened up to a more diverse set of people. "Directing is
something that a lot of people, I hope a lot of women, will
get to do. Because it's one of the greatest pleasures in life.
And 1 hope that women get to do it much more," she said.
It's not hard to explain the dearth of women in the
Hollywood film industry. "It tends to be a technical
industry, and there tend to be a lot of men who occupy

those positions, and you have to be a certain kind of
woman to do it. You have to be vicious. Can people han
dle being told what to do by a woman on a set? Can peo
ple handle seeing things from a woman's perspective,
without turning it into a kind of masculinist fantasy?"
Parrefias asked.
Parrefias' work as a woman of color makes her a part of
a wider film community that is just beginning to thrive,
yet for whom it can be hard to find funding. She warns
that schmoozing with the Hollywood bigwigs can be
rough: "You have to be really charming even if they treat
you like a cockroach."
Documentary Film — Stanford's hidden treasure
Stanford's Program in Documentary Film is far from
the world of Hollywood. This two-year graduate program
is the only one in the country that focuses exclusively on
documentary filmmaking. Jan Krawitz, the head of the
program, defends this focus: "We cannot be all things to
all people, and we don't want to be. The people who apply
to the program come here because they want that."
Many of the students, according to Krawitz, have back-

grounds in social service and social policy.
They have come to the documentary medi
um in order to express things that they can
not show other ways. Film is their "means
to explore social issues," Krawitz says. She
adds that the program accepts around 10
students a year, none of whom has formal
ly studied film production.
Krawitz asserts that the Documentary
Film Program is "very integrated into the
larger Bay Area film community," although
there are few signs of the program on cam
pus. It resides in the Communication
Department, but many undergrads and
graduate students in other departments
remain unaware of its presence.
Documentary film student Vanessa

Warhcit commented that "we, the students, are forcing
people to talk to each other" between the departments.
There is no Film Studies major for undergraduates and
little contact between the Art History film scholars and
those involved in the Documentary Film program.
Krawitz explains that the program is intensive and
heavily production-based. But each student is given free
rein to explore the issues that interest him or her.
Students come from many backgrounds. "We have had a
biologist, history master's students, a lawyer, a man who
worked at a center for AIDS prevention. They've all been
out there in the world."
Once they arrive at the program, the students are
expected to work together on critiques of dailies, rough
cuts and Fine cuts. "It's a constant process of built-in feed
back," said Krawitz.
Students start out Filming in 16 mm, which is consid
ered "a little unorthodox these days,' Krawitz said. "It's a
much more expensive, much less forgiving medium."
Students are forced to economize or. their shoots. They
are also instructed in other media. "We feed them a smor
gasbord of choices," said Krawitz, from which they will
select !o make their Final project. Second-year student
I.aura Norton said that her First quarter in the program
was an intense "crazy learning curve," as she was exposed
to the many technical elements of Filmmaking. "It's
exhausting" Norton adrritted.
Warheit remarked that the diversity of the students
leads to a plethora of goals. "We're al! really different.
People go out of it and go in a zillion directions, and peo
ple • ome into it wanting to do a zillion different things."

L.A. and make movies. That's not my goal. I think a lot of
people are on the fence about whether they want to go on
and do fiction stuff. I'm in the documentary camp. I actu
ally really want to teach."
Norton, on the other hand, came to the program after
spending many years working in feature films and televi
sion in Los Angeles. She graduated from USC with a film
studies major, and is now excited by the very different
focus of the Stanford program. "The thing that I like is
this really amazing blend of journalism and filmmaking"
that is at the center of the documentary style.
Yet there's something slightly unnerving about making
films that probe people's real lives. "Documentary is this
weird world," Norton remarks. "You very aggressively go
into people's lives." She comments that the Stanford pro
gram's atmosphere makes it easier. "It's so supportive. It's
been really valuable for me," she said. In contrast to the
L.A. world of competition, "In our group, everyone loves
to see everyone else succeed. Were like a family."
As in all realms of filmmaking, students can run into
funding issues. "Most of us come out with a lot of debt,"
Warheit says, "which is a really big problem. There's not a
lot of funding and only three TA-ships. We have to pay for
making our films. We do have access to the University's
equipment, which is not state of the art. Thev're finally get
ting digital cameras." Students usually end up funding their
own film projects, which can be expensive, despite product
grants from Kodak and occasional monetary awards.
During their second year in the program, students
learn about computerized editing equipment "and then
we pick a topic and do a 20-minute thesis film." Warheit's
film will focus on Treasure Island, which is off the coast of
San Francisco. The island, she said, "was built in 1937-38
and was the site for the 1939 World's Fair. It was supposed
to be the site for the San Francisco International Airport."
Things went awry when World War II broke out. "The
Navy got nervous, and moved in, 'temporarily,' ostensi
bly." They finally moved out just last year. The city is now
trying to decide what to do with th«* island.
Warheit is seeking a new way to define her filmmaking.
"I'm not making a Ken Burns special," she said.
"I'm going to be including interviews with people who
were at the fair. It'll include archival footage of the lair
and from when the Navy was there. I'm trying to get
interviews of people who were shipped out trom there —
12,000 men a day during the war. I want to get the con
trast of people's memories of that island — people who
went there for fun in 1939 and people who were shipped
out to war."
Warheit and Norton hope that more links can be cre
ated between their program and other parts ot the
Stanford film community. "Someone has to take the ini
tiative," Norton commented, pointing out that she and
Warheit have tried to e-mail information to as many stu
dents as possible.
All these filmmakers face some of the same problems
and have many similar goals. The issue of funding will
never go away, and as long as the product is not a com
mercial one, it will be a problem. Documentary students
learn techniques of grant writing, but worry about not
being able to make ends meet. Stanford undergrads have
only limited access to equipment and funds.
But as more students take the initiative in all of these
realms, more possibilities will open up to the Stanford
community. One ot the best and largely untapped
resources for students is Stanford's proximity to the thriv
ing independent filmmakers ot San Francisco, one of the
most active centers in the nation. Despite obstacles,
Stanford students are in a position to engage with some ot
the most provocative films of the day — those being
made by their peers and their neighbors.
The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.
Ga>ig.idharan said, "This is a pretty crucial year in

organization that will be around for many years to come."
Gangadharan credits the SFS with fostering her
involvement in film studies and production. She discov
ered that the Bay Area "is a really ripe area to be making
film and curating film programs." Today, Gangadharan
has a full-time job with the Independent Media Institute,
a non-profit umbrella organization that supports media
across the board. She's definitely caught the film bug. Her
other major project is to write a book called "Hollywood
Archaeology," about a compilation of footage collected
from Hollywood studios by artist Lowell Darling.
Considering that it costs from $1,000 to $1,200 just to
screen a film at Stanford, Levitt believes that "we've defi
nitely come a long way. That shouldn't overshadow the
fact that we have a long way to go." One of the priorities
of the SFS is giving grants to student filmmakers, but the
high cost of producing a film limits this practice. -
Shortz! makes students into filmmakers
Despite the expense of its events, SFS still finds room
in its budget to sponsor small film production grants,
many of which go to members of Shortz!, a student group

centered on providing support to student
filmmakers. David Starke, a senior major
ing in Symbolic Systems, was one of the
first members of this group founded by
Mark Lipawen, a 1995 alumni, two years
ago. Starke has made two films with this
collaborative group, the first in video for
mat and the second using 8 mm film.
Starke explains that after an initial selec
tion of student participants, the group
began meeting in the fall quarter to write
scripts and offer each other peer reviews of
their work. In the winter, they conducted
auditions for actors and started filming.
The entire process required teamwork.
"My film was closest to an action-adven
ture," Starke says."It was about this spy per-

son, and it was set on campus. I based it on a person I knew
who used to dramatize her life." The film, called "Carter!"
originally took up 2 hours of video, which Starke cut down
to a 12-minute short. Last year, Starke produced and co
directed another film with another friend. "Lines of
Direction" focused on dancing and featured original music.
This time, Starke filmed approximately 40 minutes and cut
it down to only 5.
"I had a grant from SFS to cover film and develop
ment, which was nice because it ended up costing $500,"
Starke said.
This year, Shortz! may branch out into 16 mm, the film
format used by professionals. "I think we're all going to
collaborate. It's a big step — more expensive and more
complicated. In video, you can play around a lot," but
with 16 mm, every frame costs more time and money. But
the product is remarkably superior. "I was a photograph
er, and that makes a difference to me," says Starke.
After purchasing a nonlinear digital editing machine,
Shortz! has been able to produce films that Starke says he
finds "really impressive." Plus, students get experience
using professional equipment. Starke doesn't think he'll
go on to be a film director or editor, but he's glad he got
to work like the pros. "Making films gives you a whole
new perspective," he said.
Celine Parrenas, one of Stanford's filmmakers
Oline Salazar Parreflas is a combination film scholar
and independent filmmaker who is studying in the
Program in Modern Thought and Literature. As an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, Parrefias began to pursue

her interest in ethnic studies and film. She then went on
to attend the UCLA School of Film and TV, earning a
Master of Fine Arts in Directing.
Parrefias' 30-minute thesis film, "Super Flip" was
deeply rooted in Filipino-American history and culture.
Parrefias describes her work as "experimental," and it
explores some uncomfortable themes: She is a feminist
filmmaker who wishes to uncover the workings of gender
in Filipino immigrant society.
Parrefias unites the techniques of narrative and docu
mentary filmmaking in her own experimental style. "In
the first, pre-production part of the process," she
explained, "1 do a kind of sociological interview project,
where I identify a certain sector of people that I'm mak
ing a film about and of. It's tended to be the Filipino-
American community or the immigrant community in
San Francisco."
"Super Flip" 's origins are in a very specific local com
munity. "I focused on the Filipino-American low-wage
workers who work in the Union Square area," Parrefias
says."From walking around that area, I came to realize
that Filipinos really constitute the low-wage work-force of
this city, and in some ways you could make the argument

that they are the backbone of the city. So I went to talk to
as many people as possible, just walking into stores, get
ting a feeling of how they get to a place where they can
cope with the everyday colonization of their bodies."
Parrenas views film as a way to develop discussion, as
an act rather than a product, as a cultural critique rather
than a commodity. She is especially sensitive to her posi
tion as a filmmaker giving voice to a particular group of
people: "I tried to speak of the community, but also as
someone standing within the community." Like the SFS,
she tries to spark dialogues. After her films are screened,
"there's usually a huge Q & A — it's two hours long, and
they tend to be really intense." Parrenas remarks that "a
film is its own person, and it comes to be in conversation
with its audience."
Parrenas is not surprised that students at Stanford are
starting to take a more active interest in film and its pro
duction. Today, "It is the medium that reaches the most
people, in this postmodern era, where there's definitely a
visual turn, where a lot less people do the reading. It's
almost unavoidable for the smart people who are at
Stanford to want to use this." She's hopeful that Stanford
can be a place for new voices in film, uncorrupted by
Hollywood's obsession with the box office.
Parrenas would like to see the experience of filmmaking
opened up to a more diverse set of people. "Directing is
something that a lot of people, I hope a lot of women, will
get to do. Because it's one of the greatest pleasures in life.
And 1 hope that women get to do it much more," she said.
It's not hard to explain the dearth of women in the
Hollywood film industry. "It tends to be a technical
industry, and there tend to be a lot of men who occupy

those positions, and you have to be a certain kind of
woman to do it. You have to be vicious. Can people han
dle being told what to do by a woman on a set? Can peo
ple handle seeing things from a woman's perspective,
without turning it into a kind of masculinist fantasy?"
Parrefias asked.
Parrefias' work as a woman of color makes her a part of
a wider film community that is just beginning to thrive,
yet for whom it can be hard to find funding. She warns
that schmoozing with the Hollywood bigwigs can be
rough: "You have to be really charming even if they treat
you like a cockroach."
Documentary Film — Stanford's hidden treasure
Stanford's Program in Documentary Film is far from
the world of Hollywood. This two-year graduate program
is the only one in the country that focuses exclusively on
documentary filmmaking. Jan Krawitz, the head of the
program, defends this focus: "We cannot be all things to
all people, and we don't want to be. The people who apply
to the program come here because they want that."
Many of the students, according to Krawitz, have back-

grounds in social service and social policy.
They have come to the documentary medi
um in order to express things that they can
not show other ways. Film is their "means
to explore social issues," Krawitz says. She
adds that the program accepts around 10
students a year, none of whom has formal
ly studied film production.
Krawitz asserts that the Documentary
Film Program is "very integrated into the
larger Bay Area film community," although
there are few signs of the program on cam
pus. It resides in the Communication
Department, but many undergrads and
graduate students in other departments
remain unaware of its presence.
Documentary film student Vanessa

Warhcit commented that "we, the students, are forcing
people to talk to each other" between the departments.
There is no Film Studies major for undergraduates and
little contact between the Art History film scholars and
those involved in the Documentary Film program.
Krawitz explains that the program is intensive and
heavily production-based. But each student is given free
rein to explore the issues that interest him or her.
Students come from many backgrounds. "We have had a
biologist, history master's students, a lawyer, a man who
worked at a center for AIDS prevention. They've all been
out there in the world."
Once they arrive at the program, the students are
expected to work together on critiques of dailies, rough
cuts and Fine cuts. "It's a constant process of built-in feed
back," said Krawitz.
Students start out Filming in 16 mm, which is consid
ered "a little unorthodox these days,' Krawitz said. "It's a
much more expensive, much less forgiving medium."
Students are forced to economize or. their shoots. They
are also instructed in other media. "We feed them a smor
gasbord of choices," said Krawitz, from which they will
select !o make their Final project. Second-year student
I.aura Norton said that her First quarter in the program
was an intense "crazy learning curve," as she was exposed
to the many technical elements of Filmmaking. "It's
exhausting" Norton adrritted.
Warheit remarked that the diversity of the students
leads to a plethora of goals. "We're al! really different.
People go out of it and go in a zillion directions, and peo
ple • ome into it wanting to do a zillion different things."
"Personally," she continued, "I don't want 112« move t<>

L.A. and make movies. That's not my goal. I think a lot of
people are on the fence about whether they want to go on
and do fiction stuff. I'm in the documentary camp. I actu
ally really want to teach."
Norton, on the other hand, came to the program after
spending many years working in feature films and televi
sion in Los Angeles. She graduated from USC with a film
studies major, and is now excited by the very different
focus of the Stanford program. "The thing that I like is
this really amazing blend of journalism and filmmaking"
that is at the center of the documentary style.
Yet there's something slightly unnerving about making
films that probe people's real lives. "Documentary is this
weird world," Norton remarks. "You very aggressively go
into people's lives." She comments that the Stanford pro
gram's atmosphere makes it easier. "It's so supportive. It's
been really valuable for me," she said. In contrast to the
L.A. world of competition, "In our group, everyone loves
to see everyone else succeed. Were like a family."
As in all realms of filmmaking, students can run into
funding issues. "Most of us come out with a lot of debt,"
Warheit says, "which is a really big problem. There's not a
lot of funding and only three TA-ships. We have to pay for
making our films. We do have access to the University's
equipment, which is not state of the art. Thev're finally get
ting digital cameras." Students usually end up funding their
own film projects, which can be expensive, despite product
grants from Kodak and occasional monetary awards.
During their second year in the program, students
learn about computerized editing equipment "and then
we pick a topic and do a 20-minute thesis film." Warheit's
film will focus on Treasure Island, which is off the coast of
San Francisco. The island, she said, "was built in 1937-38
and was the site for the 1939 World's Fair. It was supposed
to be the site for the San Francisco International Airport."
Things went awry when World War II broke out. "The
Navy got nervous, and moved in, 'temporarily,' ostensi
bly." They finally moved out just last year. The city is now
trying to decide what to do with th«* island.
Warheit is seeking a new way to define her filmmaking.
"I'm not making a Ken Burns special," she said.
"I'm going to be including interviews with people who
were at the fair. It'll include archival footage of the lair
and from when the Navy was there. I'm trying to get
interviews of people who were shipped out trom there —
12,000 men a day during the war. I want to get the con
trast of people's memories of that island — people who
went there for fun in 1939 and people who were shipped
out to war."
Warheit and Norton hope that more links can be cre
ated between their program and other parts ot the
Stanford film community. "Someone has to take the ini
tiative," Norton commented, pointing out that she and
Warheit have tried to e-mail information to as many stu
dents as possible.
All these filmmakers face some of the same problems
and have many similar goals. The issue of funding will
never go away, and as long as the product is not a com
mercial one, it will be a problem. Documentary students
learn techniques of grant writing, but worry about not
being able to make ends meet. Stanford undergrads have
only limited access to equipment and funds.
But as more students take the initiative in all of these
realms, more possibilities will open up to the Stanford
community. One ot the best and largely untapped
resources for students is Stanford's proximity to the thriv
ing independent filmmakers ot San Francisco, one of the
most active centers in the nation. Despite obstacles,
Stanford students are in a position to engage with some ot
the most provocative films of the day — those being
made by their peers and their neighbors.
The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.
Ga>ig.idharan said, "This is a pretty crucial year in

organization that will be around for many years to come."
Gangadharan credits the SFS with fostering her
involvement in film studies and production. She discov
ered that the Bay Area "is a really ripe area to be making
film and curating film programs." Today, Gangadharan
has a full-time job with the Independent Media Institute,
a non-profit umbrella organization that supports media
across the board. She's definitely caught the film bug. Her
other major project is to write a book called "Hollywood
Archaeology," about a compilation of footage collected
from Hollywood studios by artist Lowell Darling.
Considering that it costs from $1,000 to $1,200 just to
screen a film at Stanford, Levitt believes that "we've defi
nitely come a long way. That shouldn't overshadow the
fact that we have a long way to go." One of the priorities
of the SFS is giving grants to student filmmakers, but the
high cost of producing a film limits this practice. -
Shortz! makes students into filmmakers
Despite the expense of its events, SFS still finds room
in its budget to sponsor small film production grants,
many of which go to members of Shortz!, a student group

centered on providing support to student
filmmakers. David Starke, a senior major
ing in Symbolic Systems, was one of the
first members of this group founded by
Mark Lipawen, a 1995 alumni, two years
ago. Starke has made two films with this
collaborative group, the first in video for
mat and the second using 8 mm film.
Starke explains that after an initial selec
tion of student participants, the group
began meeting in the fall quarter to write
scripts and offer each other peer reviews of
their work. In the winter, they conducted
auditions for actors and started filming.
The entire process required teamwork.
"My film was closest to an action-adven
ture," Starke says."It was about this spy per-

son, and it was set on campus. I based it on a person I knew
who used to dramatize her life." The film, called "Carter!"
originally took up 2 hours of video, which Starke cut down
to a 12-minute short. Last year, Starke produced and co
directed another film with another friend. "Lines of
Direction" focused on dancing and featured original music.
This time, Starke filmed approximately 40 minutes and cut
it down to only 5.
"I had a grant from SFS to cover film and develop
ment, which was nice because it ended up costing $500,"
Starke said.
This year, Shortz! may branch out into 16 mm, the film
format used by professionals. "I think we're all going to
collaborate. It's a big step — more expensive and more
complicated. In video, you can play around a lot," but
with 16 mm, every frame costs more time and money. But
the product is remarkably superior. "I was a photograph
er, and that makes a difference to me," says Starke.
After purchasing a nonlinear digital editing machine,
Shortz! has been able to produce films that Starke says he
finds "really impressive." Plus, students get experience
using professional equipment. Starke doesn't think he'll
go on to be a film director or editor, but he's glad he got
to work like the pros. "Making films gives you a whole
new perspective," he said.
Celine Parrenas, one of Stanford's filmmakers
Oline Salazar Parreflas is a combination film scholar
and independent filmmaker who is studying in the
Program in Modern Thought and Literature. As an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley, Parrefias began to pursue

her interest in ethnic studies and film. She then went on
to attend the UCLA School of Film and TV, earning a
Master of Fine Arts in Directing.
Parrefias' 30-minute thesis film, "Super Flip" was
deeply rooted in Filipino-American history and culture.
Parrefias describes her work as "experimental," and it
explores some uncomfortable themes: She is a feminist
filmmaker who wishes to uncover the workings of gender
in Filipino immigrant society.
Parrefias unites the techniques of narrative and docu
mentary filmmaking in her own experimental style. "In
the first, pre-production part of the process," she
explained, "1 do a kind of sociological interview project,
where I identify a certain sector of people that I'm mak
ing a film about and of. It's tended to be the Filipino-
American community or the immigrant community in
San Francisco."
"Super Flip" 's origins are in a very specific local com
munity. "I focused on the Filipino-American low-wage
workers who work in the Union Square area," Parrefias
says."From walking around that area, I came to realize
that Filipinos really constitute the low-wage work-force of
this city, and in some ways you could make the argument

that they are the backbone of the city. So I went to talk to
as many people as possible, just walking into stores, get
ting a feeling of how they get to a place where they can
cope with the everyday colonization of their bodies."
Parrenas views film as a way to develop discussion, as
an act rather than a product, as a cultural critique rather
than a commodity. She is especially sensitive to her posi
tion as a filmmaker giving voice to a particular group of
people: "I tried to speak of the community, but also as
someone standing within the community." Like the SFS,
she tries to spark dialogues. After her films are screened,
"there's usually a huge Q & A — it's two hours long, and
they tend to be really intense." Parrenas remarks that "a
film is its own person, and it comes to be in conversation
with its audience."
Parrenas is not surprised that students at Stanford are
starting to take a more active interest in film and its pro
duction. Today, "It is the medium that reaches the most
people, in this postmodern era, where there's definitely a
visual turn, where a lot less people do the reading. It's
almost unavoidable for the smart people who are at
Stanford to want to use this." She's hopeful that Stanford
can be a place for new voices in film, uncorrupted by
Hollywood's obsession with the box office.
Parrenas would like to see the experience of filmmaking
opened up to a more diverse set of people. "Directing is
something that a lot of people, I hope a lot of women, will
get to do. Because it's one of the greatest pleasures in life.
And 1 hope that women get to do it much more," she said.
It's not hard to explain the dearth of women in the
Hollywood film industry. "It tends to be a technical
industry, and there tend to be a lot of men who occupy

those positions, and you have to be a certain kind of
woman to do it. You have to be vicious. Can people han
dle being told what to do by a woman on a set? Can peo
ple handle seeing things from a woman's perspective,
without turning it into a kind of masculinist fantasy?"
Parrefias asked.
Parrefias' work as a woman of color makes her a part of
a wider film community that is just beginning to thrive,
yet for whom it can be hard to find funding. She warns
that schmoozing with the Hollywood bigwigs can be
rough: "You have to be really charming even if they treat
you like a cockroach."
Documentary Film — Stanford's hidden treasure
Stanford's Program in Documentary Film is far from
the world of Hollywood. This two-year graduate program
is the only one in the country that focuses exclusively on
documentary filmmaking. Jan Krawitz, the head of the
program, defends this focus: "We cannot be all things to
all people, and we don't want to be. The people who apply
to the program come here because they want that."
Many of the students, according to Krawitz, have back-

grounds in social service and social policy.
They have come to the documentary medi
um in order to express things that they can
not show other ways. Film is their "means
to explore social issues," Krawitz says. She
adds that the program accepts around 10
students a year, none of whom has formal
ly studied film production.
Krawitz asserts that the Documentary
Film Program is "very integrated into the
larger Bay Area film community," although
there are few signs of the program on cam
pus. It resides in the Communication
Department, but many undergrads and
graduate students in other departments
remain unaware of its presence.
Documentary film student Vanessa

Warhcit commented that "we, the students, are forcing
people to talk to each other" between the departments.
There is no Film Studies major for undergraduates and
little contact between the Art History film scholars and
those involved in the Documentary Film program.
Krawitz explains that the program is intensive and
heavily production-based. But each student is given free
rein to explore the issues that interest him or her.
Students come from many backgrounds. "We have had a
biologist, history master's students, a lawyer, a man who
worked at a center for AIDS prevention. They've all been
out there in the world."
Once they arrive at the program, the students are
expected to work together on critiques of dailies, rough
cuts and Fine cuts. "It's a constant process of built-in feed
back," said Krawitz.
Students start out Filming in 16 mm, which is consid
ered "a little unorthodox these days,' Krawitz said. "It's a
much more expensive, much less forgiving medium."
Students are forced to economize or. their shoots. They
are also instructed in other media. "We feed them a smor
gasbord of choices," said Krawitz, from which they will
select !o make their Final project. Second-year student
I.aura Norton said that her First quarter in the program
was an intense "crazy learning curve," as she was exposed
to the many technical elements of Filmmaking. "It's
exhausting" Norton adrritted.
Warheit remarked that the diversity of the students
leads to a plethora of goals. "We're al! really different.
People go out of it and go in a zillion directions, and peo
ple • ome into it wanting to do a zillion different things."

L.A. and make movies. That's not my goal. I think a lot of
people are on the fence about whether they want to go on
and do fiction stuff. I'm in the documentary camp. I actu
ally really want to teach."
Norton, on the other hand, came to the program after
spending many years working in feature films and televi
sion in Los Angeles. She graduated from USC with a film
studies major, and is now excited by the very different
focus of the Stanford program. "The thing that I like is
this really amazing blend of journalism and filmmaking"
that is at the center of the documentary style.
Yet there's something slightly unnerving about making
films that probe people's real lives. "Documentary is this
weird world," Norton remarks. "You very aggressively go
into people's lives." She comments that the Stanford pro
gram's atmosphere makes it easier. "It's so supportive. It's
been really valuable for me," she said. In contrast to the
L.A. world of competition, "In our group, everyone loves
to see everyone else succeed. Were like a family."
As in all realms of filmmaking, students can run into
funding issues. "Most of us come out with a lot of debt,"
Warheit says, "which is a really big problem. There's not a
lot of funding and only three TA-ships. We have to pay for
making our films. We do have access to the University's
equipment, which is not state of the art. Thev're finally get
ting digital cameras." Students usually end up funding their
own film projects, which can be expensive, despite product
grants from Kodak and occasional monetary awards.
During their second year in the program, students
learn about computerized editing equipment "and then
we pick a topic and do a 20-minute thesis film." Warheit's
film will focus on Treasure Island, which is off the coast of
San Francisco. The island, she said, "was built in 1937-38
and was the site for the 1939 World's Fair. It was supposed
to be the site for the San Francisco International Airport."
Things went awry when World War II broke out. "The
Navy got nervous, and moved in, 'temporarily,' ostensi
bly." They finally moved out just last year. The city is now
trying to decide what to do with th«* island.
Warheit is seeking a new way to define her filmmaking.
"I'm not making a Ken Burns special," she said.
"I'm going to be including interviews with people who
were at the fair. It'll include archival footage of the lair
and from when the Navy was there. I'm trying to get
interviews of people who were shipped out trom there —
12,000 men a day during the war. I want to get the con
trast of people's memories of that island — people who
went there for fun in 1939 and people who were shipped
out to war."
Warheit and Norton hope that more links can be cre
ated between their program and other parts ot the
Stanford film community. "Someone has to take the ini
tiative," Norton commented, pointing out that she and
Warheit have tried to e-mail information to as many stu
dents as possible.
All these filmmakers face some of the same problems
and have many similar goals. The issue of funding will
never go away, and as long as the product is not a com
mercial one, it will be a problem. Documentary students
learn techniques of grant writing, but worry about not
being able to make ends meet. Stanford undergrads have
only limited access to equipment and funds.
But as more students take the initiative in all of these
realms, more possibilities will open up to the Stanford
community. One ot the best and largely untapped
resources for students is Stanford's proximity to the thriv
ing independent filmmakers ot San Francisco, one of the
most active centers in the nation. Despite obstacles,
Stanford students are in a position to engage with some ot
the most provocative films of the day — those being
made by their peers and their neighbors.
