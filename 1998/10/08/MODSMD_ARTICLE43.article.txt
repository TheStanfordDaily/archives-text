The Farm may not be the first place you'd look for an
innovative film community. It's far from the urban cam
puses famous for their film making, such as UCLA, USC
and NYU. Yet filmmaking and interest in film production
have begun to flourish at Stanford as never before. The
film renaissance underway on campus has

sprung from the ambition of both undergradu
ate and graduate students to actively make film
a part of life at Stanford.
The Stanford Film Society increases awareness
But film hasn't always been a fixture on the
Stanford campus. Jonathan Levitt, a coterminal
student in psychology and founder of the
Stanford Film Society, remembers a time not
long ago when he had trouble finding any stu
dents pursuing film interests. "When I came to
Stanford," Levitt recalls, "I was basically sur
prised and disappointed at the lack of a film
community. There weren't very many opportu
nities to get involved with film in a serious way."
Although students did enjoy weekend movies
at Flicks, they did not have the chance to see films
outside the mainstream. Levitt remembers that

his during his freshman year, Flicks conccntrsted

on showing "a lot of blockbusters."
Shocked to find that Stanford had never had a film soci
ety — - a popular and venerable institution on most college
campuses — Ix*vitt decided to start his own. "I applied for
a grant from the Alumni Association, and after getting one
and selecting a board, we created a vision statement."
This vision has guided the Stanford Film Society since
its inception in 199:>. Levitt recognized 'hat many stu
dents wished to be exposed to the kinds of thoughtful,
provocative films thai do not play at the Mcrcado 20. The
! ilm Society's commitment ranged from screening the
latest independent films to providing funding for student
filmmaking projects.
Some students and recent graduates may recall the

Film Society's first screening 4 years ago. The film "Kids"
was shown on campus to packed houses of at least 1,800
people before its local release. Levitt recalls the success of
this program, which included not only the film itself — a
raw look at the partying youth of New York City — but
also a number of discussion sessions.
Catherine Chang, a coterminal student in English who
joined the group in 1997, was impressed by the fact that

SFS features "not only films, but speakers. It's a forum for
speaking as well as for seeing. After the films, we have
question-and-answer sessions. It seems to be a very satis
fying way to end the evening for people."
Levitt remarked that aside from encouraging film pro
duction, "My main goal in starting SI S was to educate our
community, and film is really the best way to do that. It
sparks discussion, dialogues. My program centers around
particular issues" in order to facilitate engagement. Some
themes explored 1.1 discussion sessions have been the psy
chology of violence and violence against women.
Recently, SFS has successfully brought a number of
film festivals and film directors to campus. The Black
Maria Film Festival, a two-hour-long program of short

films that range from documentary and experimental to
animated or digital in style, has come to Stanford for 3
years now. According to Chang, "Stanford is its only
forum on the West Coast. It's a pretty ambitious thing for
us to do." Levitt says that the event sold 600 to 700 tickets
last year, and that students have become increasingly
receptive to this kind of screening.
Last year, one of the best-attended events was a screen
ing of "The Well," a film that members of SFS first

encountered at the Sundance Film Festival, a
major outlet for independent filmmakers from
around the world. The film's director was flown
in from Australia for the occasion, and numerous
Aussies joined Stanford students at the screening.
The SFS is proud of its presence at Sundance and
of its efforts to bring filmmakers to Stanford.
Just this past Saturday, the SFS sponsored "D.
Film: The Digital Film Festival." Field in Cubberly
and organized by SFS co-president Beth
Robinowitz, this traveling festival featured com
puter-generated films. A panel presentation
kicked off the evening and included Darin
Hollings of Dream Quest Images, the digital
effects production company for Disney. Hollings
directed effects for "Armageddon,""Con-Air," and
"The Rock."
Seeta Gangadharan, a 1997 alumna of
Stanford, has been helping to organize the year's

most prominent event, the United Nations

Association Film Festival. From October 23 to 25, the SFS
and the UNA Midpeninsula Chapter will cosponsor
screenings of documentary films on UN topics such as
human rights, environmental survival, refugee protec
tion, immunization and education. Only 18 films were
selected out of over 50 submissions from countries such
'as Mongolia, Cuba, Rwanda, Tibet, New Zealand and the
United States.
In line with SFS goals, discussions and speakers will
accompany the films. Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
Slavic and Literatures Department, and a doc
umental y maker herself, is this series' director.
