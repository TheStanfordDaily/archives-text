## Lovely 'Lolita' A 						fascinating controversy 
### 
Since when did major motion pictures come out on cable television before appear
ing on the big screen?
Perhaps since Adrian Lyne's adaptation of the Vladimir Nabokov novel "Lolita."
While many are flocking to see the movie in its limited U.S. release, millions have already
seen "Lolita" on Showtime.
"Lolita," which has stirred controversy since its publication in 1955, is about an aging
European who has a sexual affair with his adolescent stepdaughter. Given America's
growing concern with child abuse and Congress's 1996 Child Pornography Prevention
Act, no Hollywood distributor wanted to touch Lyne's movie, which was ready for
release in 1997. The Samuel Goldwyn Company finally picked it up this year, but not
before Showtime, with its "No Limits" tagline, aired it in August.
So is the new "Lolita" worth all the controversy? Well, it's certainly something to talk
about, but child pornography it ain't.
"Lolita" centers around Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons), a professor of French lit
erature who gets a job in a small New England town. He ends up living in the household
of Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), a widow who takes a liking to him. Humbert

becomes fixated on Charlotte's daughter Dolores (Dominique Swain) because she
reminds him of a childhood love who died when he was only 13. He marries Charlotte
as a means of staying close to his true love, his Lolita.
Charlotte dies in a nasty accident, leaving Dolores in Humbert's care. Between
Humbert's strange and sometimes comical "courting" of Dolores and her own naive
crush on him, the two begin their forbidden dance. They pile their things into
Humbert's car and take a hotel-and-apartment tour of 1940s America.
Humbert knows that his actions are wrong, but how can he battle the deep passions
that have troubled him for decades? Dolores, whose pigtails and dental retainer con
stantly remind us of her youth, is quickly becoming an emotional wreck. And a man
named Clare Quilty (Frank Langella), for no clear reason, is following them
"Lolita" can be a hard movie to watch. We find ourselves wondering who the real
criminal is here. Is it Humbert, for violating the innocence of a child in his care? Is it
Dolores, who girlishly but seductively leads him on much of the time? Is it the director,
for putting the whole thing on film? Or is it us, for watching it?
This movie is a great success thanks to its director. Lyne plays with our minds and

pushes us through a range of emo
tions; we are disturbed, yet we feel
compassion toward every character.
Lyne is not at all new to racy movies —
his past credits include "9 '/ 2 Weeks,"
"Fatal Attraction" and "Indecent
Proposal." But "Lolita" has a slower,
dreamier pace than his other films. The
movie is set in the United States, but it
has a more nostalgic, almost European
feel that breaks away from the
Hollywood mold.
Both Irons and Swain do a superb
job of capturing the lead characters.
Swain, in her feature-film debut, can
switch easily among the mischievous
schoolgirl, the alluring temptress and
the raving victim of abuse. Irons, as
twisted as his character is, garners sym
pathy from the audience with his
romantic narration.
Lyne's film stays truer to Nabokov's
vision than Stanley Kubrick's 1962 ver
sion of "Lolita." If you still haven't seen
it on Showtime, you ought to check
this one out.
