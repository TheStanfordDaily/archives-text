						not-so-magic 'Touch'

CC p— of Evil" (1958) begins with a car bomb
ing investigation in a seedy town on the
A Mexican-American border and ends with a
tragic showdown between virtue and, well, evil. It's set in
a poor, grimy town and shot with some of the sexiest
camera work in history. "Touch of Evil" is not a truly
enjoyable film, but it's ultimately watchable because of
the unforgettable images and Orson Welles' diabolical
character, Hank Quinlan.
Recently re-cut according to a memo in which Welles
outlined his vision for the picture, this release of "Evil" is a
"director's cut" which eliminates some of the inconsisten
cies of the studio version. The element that may stand out
most to a 1990s audience is the cultural cross-dressing.
Charlton Heston, about as white a guy as you'll ever meet,
plays Miguel Vargas, a driven Mexican drug investigator.
Akim Tamiroff, presumably of Russian heritage, is "Uncle
Joe" Grandi, the squat interim leader of the Mexican drug

gang Vargas is prosecuting. Smoky Marlene Dietrich, a
native of Germany, is an unconvincing Gypsy fortuneteller.
The characters could be offensive, but mostly they seem
comical, throwing off the balance of the picture. At times,
"Evil" feels more like a post-modern performance piece
than a convincing, affecting drama for the 90s.
Notable performances from the rest of the cast include
Janet Leigh as Vargas' sassy, stand-up-for-herself wife,
Joseph Calleia as Menzies, Quinlan's worshipful partner,
and Dennis Weaver as an over-the-top but entertaining
motel employee.
Orson Welles is widely known as the supreme auteur of
America cinema, but "Touch of Evil," despite its outstand
ing cinematography, is simply not the involving thriller it
might have been. The middle of the film drags on without
real dramatic tension. Only in the final scenes — when
Hank Quinlan goes on a binge of violence and alcohol —
does "Touch of Evil" drag itself to a scintillating level.

The best thing about "Evil" is its amazing moving pic
tures. Welles works the camera like no one else. The open
ing three minutes of the film are legendary, but Welles
never lets up; scene after scene is constructed of startling,
energetic images. One dazzling bit shows Vargas' face
appearing in a mirror on a wall covered with pictures of
famous matadors. Qumlan is in the room and thinks he
sees something, and he leans forward and places his huge
bulk into the frame. Above him is the mounted head of a
bull, surrounded by banderillas, barbed sticks used to
take down the bull in a fight. Those two sad, telling shots
beautifully foreshadow the final showdown.
"Touch of Evil" is a landmark film. With its incredible
artistry, it stands up against the movies of today. And yet
it's somehow unsatisfying. Even all of Orson Welles' scrib
bled notes can't make "Evil" a truly convincing film.
