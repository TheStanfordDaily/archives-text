# Designer Impostors'
## This is stylish, wacky, good stuff 
### 
In "The Impostors," a quirky
comedy about two unem
ployed Depression-era actors,
Arthur (Stanley Tucci) and
Maurice (Oliver Piatt), director
Tucci presents a film with offbeat
and unexpected humor through
out the pair's slapstick adventures
as down-and-out actors.
Arthur, who is sensitive and
meticulous, hopes someday to
perform a death scene fitting of
international acclaim. His partner,
Maurice, is a stout and impulsive
man who is subject to occasional
acts of scene-steaiing. They are as
devoted to one another as they are
to their acting careers.
Searching for the perfect acting
roles, the two create scenes in bak
eries, restaurant patios or wherev
er anyone can watch them. All they
want is the chance to perform.
However, after a barroom con
frontation between the pair and
its least favorite actor, arrogant
thespian Jeremy Burtom (Alfred
Molina), they are falsely accused

of physically assaulting him.
Barely escaping the authorities,
Arthur and Maurice find them
selves as stowaways in a packing
crate aboard a cruise ship.
Trying to evade discovery, the
duo gets the chance to play the
most important roles of their
lives. Impersonating doctors, crew
members and regular passengers,
they find themselves on a ship full
of other impostors as well.
Among the ludicrous passen
gers on board are a political rev
olutionary plotting to blow up
the ship, a deposed queen, an
eager homosexual lover who
pursues Maurice, a suicidal
singer, a wealthy and eccentric
sheik and a gold-digging mother
and her macabre daughter. To
make matters worse, Burtom is
on board, ready and waiting to
identify the duo.
In trying to evade their pur
suers, Maurice and Arthur receive
help from Lily (Lili Taylor), the
head stewardess who believes in

their innocence. Meanwhile, they
get caught up in the passengers'
twisted plots of murder, money
and romance.
When Arthur and Maurice
learn that the ship is about to be
blown up, they seize the chance
to out-perform the other impos
tors on board to save the ship.
"The Impostors" is a unique
blend of colorful characters,
comical dialogue and great act
ing that produces a hilarious

comedy. Costars Steve Buscemi,
Billy Connolly and Isabella
Rossellini join Tucci and Flatt to
create a successful comedy rich
with Depression-era cliches and
satire. And in the director's chair,
Tucci adds details that make the
film quirky but not too silly. The
use of music throughout the film
was particularly well done, as it
changed in tempo to coincide
with the actors' abrupt move
ments or changes in emotion.

With so many interesting
characters in the film, each with a
zany subplot to add to the
already amusing story, the movie
doesn't have a slow moment.
Sometimes the wacky dialogue
takes the spotlight; at other times
the bizarre idiosyncrasies of the
characters demand attention. But
in every scene, the actors' fine
performances create a thorough
ly entertaining film.
