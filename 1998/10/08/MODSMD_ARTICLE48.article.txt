# A 						Wasted 'Dream'
## Not even Robin Williams can save it 
### 
Movie trailers are often deceiving. Such is
the case with "What Dreams May Come."
The artistry of the film's digital effects is
quite imaginative, and the television commercials
are sure to boast about that. Unfortunately, this is
the only true merit of the entire 106-minute pro
duction (though it feels much longer).
The dialogue is too cheesy even for a date flick,
and the script just doesn't exercise enough inge
nuity beyond the visuals. This is yet another film
that has succumbed to its preoccupation with
special effects over dramatic substance.
Nevertheless, fashion over function rarely
achieves the level of beauty seen in "What Dreams
May Come." The actors do what they can to sal
vage the film by delivering solid performances,
but only so much can be done with a film that
stars effects wizards instead of actors.
After his untimely death, Chris Nielsen (Robin
Williams) transcends his earthly life and enters
Heaven, a world that is only limited by his imagi
nation. His Heaven, incidentally, exists within one
of his wife's oil paintings. (Here we hearken back
to Mary Poppins with more sophisticated digital
imaging.) In Heaven, Chris is reunited with long
dead family members and friends who teach him
the ways of his new world.
When Chris finds out that his wife Annie
(Anabella Sciorra) can never join him in Heaven,
he vows to find her. This sets him off on an odyssey

through layers of Heaven and Hell to free her. I'his
journey takes moviegoers through a multitude of
afterlife visions, and the visuals are stunning.
Based on the ideas of unconditional love and
the existence of soulmates, this film had much
potential to move people to tears. Instead, the
opportunity was wasted on overly dramatic flash
backs of Chris and Annie's life together before
death beset their household. Character develop
ment was shallow at best; the audience never
formed any sort of attachment to either the rela
tionships driving the film or the characters them
selves. There was no time for that, because Robin
Williams is just too busy walking past screaming
corpses on his way to find his tortured wife.
The ideas behind the organization of the after
life are quite interesting, but again, "What Dreams
May Come" fails. It squanders the opportunity to
explore this idea further in favor of histrionic
flashbacks and bright colors.
Though it fell short of the human element it was
aiming for, the film does a superb job at trans
forming the silver screen into an interpretive can
vas. Two hours of rich and vivid paintings, though,
can get a bit tedious. So if you're looking for a film
that will move you, see something else. But if
you're in the mood to look at moving pictures of
Heaven and Hell on a big screen, this is exactly
what you'll get with "What Dreams May Come."
