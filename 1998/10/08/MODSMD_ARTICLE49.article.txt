## 'Roxbury,' Shmoxbury SNL flick is forgettable 
### 
« A Night at the Roxbury" plots its success upon
I\ two main points: One, that immature,
JL JL polyester playboys can be serious enough in
their quest for clubdom that we will find them funny,

and two, that the Saturday Night Live franchise has
enough gloss left in its ancestral comic machine that
everything it produces will shine with a hilarious gleam.
Unfortunately, "A Night at the Roxbury" banks for zero

on both counts. Not only is
this tale of the wanna-be
club-gods Butabi brothers not
funny, it's downright boring.
For anyone not familiar
with the SNL sketch on
which the film is based, the
story follows the relentless
quest of Steve (Will Ferrell)
and Doug (Chris Kattan)
Butabi to not only get in to
the hip and trendy Roxbury
club, but to become movers
and shakers in their own
rights, as owners and cre
ators of the hippest nightclub
in all of Los Angeles.
Steve and Ooug start their
simpering climb to the top at
a nice poini. Their father is
the successful owner of a suc
cessful silk flower business in
Beverly Hills, and he makes
more than enough money to
keep them outfitted in shiny
pants, mousse and a BMW.
But life is tough, even for
the shallow and unprinci-

pled. Papa Butabi constantly pushes the older, less ambi
tious Steve towards a life of responsibility — taking over
the family business and marrying the daughter of the
shopowner next door, the sex-crazed Emily. And to top it all
off, they can't even get in to the Roxbury. But Doug vows to
keep Steve on track for the right goals and future — a busi
ness meeting with Mr. Zadir, the owner of the Roxbury.
After a series of events involving Richard Greico's
Lamborghini and the Butabi's rear-ended van (they had
fun until Daddy took their BMW away), the Butabi
boys not only get past the velvet rope, they meet Mr.
Zadir and snag gorgeous, gold-digging women along
the way. Life is sweet.
But tragedy strikes again. Not only does Mr. Zadir's evil
hench-chauffeur keep them from having their business
meeting, but Papa Butabi clamps down an iron fist on
Steve to run the business and carry on the family lineage
with Emily. Will they ever realize their dreams? Will Steve
and Doug ever be truly hip? Will this movie ever end?
There are splashes of fun throughout the film, but
they are rare, and ultimately can be reduced to a portfo
lio of body jokes and corny dance moves. Dan Hedaya,
reviving his role from "Clueless" as the quintessential
unsatisfied Beverly Hills dad, screeches his way through
the movie predictably, but entertainingly. And to his
credit, Chris Kattan, as the more extroverted Butabi, has
a few moments that are truly funny.
But in the end, "A Night at the Roxbury" is nothing to
laugh (or chuckle, or giggle) about. Watch the trailers,
guffaw a bit, and just leave it at that.
