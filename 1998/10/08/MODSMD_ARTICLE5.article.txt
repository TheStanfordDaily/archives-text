If you have to strain to pick out the fa
miliar faces among the Stanford-sweat
shirt-clad throngs this weekend, you can
blame it on Reunion Homecoming
Weekend.
The event, which runs from today
through Sunday, will feature a variety of
academic and social events, according to
Leslie Winick Gasner, director of Re
union Homecoming Events for the Alum
ni Association.
"Reunion Weekend this year will he
unprecedented in the number of guests
on campus and the variety of programs
that will be featured," Gasner said. "Our
goal is to reconnect the alumni with the
University and each other."
At least 5,()(K) guests are expected to
arrive on campus later today, 3,500 of
them alumni.
In addition to employees of the Alum
ni Association and University Events
Staff involved with the gala, over 100 stu
dent employees and volunteers will be
present to help staff events and guide
alumni as they reacquaint themselves
with the campus.
Alumni will be attending events that
cater both towards individual graduating
classes and the group as a whole.

This evening, 1.500 alumni are expect
ed to attend "Dinner on the Quad," which
will feature a keynote address by Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
During the weekend, the alumni will
be able to sample from panel discussions,
a "Classes Without Quizzes" academic
program and other events and exhibitions
throughout campus.
"We have tried to make the greatest
variety of opportunities available so that
everyone will find something that they
will enjoy doing." Gasner said.
The weekend will culminate with two
large-scale events. On Saturday evening,
the alumni will be joined by current facul
ty and students at the first annual "All
Right Now! Swing Dance" in the Main
Quad. The event was conceived and coor
dinated by senior Michael Martinez.
"We are trying to bring together the
many facets of the Stanford community
for an enjoyable evening," Martinez said.
"Hopefully, the dance will be something
we will not soon forget."
Reunion Homecoming will officially
end on Sunday afternoon with the ' Re
union Finale" in Memorial Auditorium,
where Provost Condoleezza Rice is
scheduled to speak.
In addition to the unparalleled size and
structure,of the weekend, this year also

marks the first Reunion Weekend
planned since the integration of the
Alumni Association into the University
Office of Development on Sept. I. Cias
ner said that this alliance has only made
the planning process better.
"Although the event itself hasn't
changed much in the last five years or
even following our integration, working
closely with the University has made
more resources available for the weekend
this year, which results in a better time for
the alumni." she said. "All of lis are ea
gerly anticipating the coming weekend."
Those planning the event are not the
only people anticipating the arrival of the
alumni. The students working closely
with the Alumni Office as well are excited
to greet the flood of guests expected to ar
rive.
"I became a team leader this year be
cause 1 loved working at the weekend for
the past three years." said Trinity Dono
van. a senior.
"Besides being a fun job. it is impor
tant to help the alumni have a smooth
transition back to campus."
Some student staffers will be working
at Reunion Weekend for the first time
this vear.
"1 wiinted to work at Reunion
Weekend because I find it fasci
nating to learn about the perspec
tives of the alumni â€” how they
perceive the campus today, what it
was like when they were here,
things like that," said junior Rahul
Hat 6.
While some students aren't
looking forward to sharing the
campus with thousands of guests,
others not involved with Reunion
events are looking at the weekend
in a different light.
"The atmosphere that Reunion
Weekend brings to campus is un
paralleled." said senior Greg Far
ber. "It is one of the few opportu
nities that current students get to
see part of their school's history."
