## The 						review 
### 
Ihave to admit that 1 have not been entranced by
last year's big television hits, "Ally Mcßeal" and
"Dawson's Creek," unlike many of my dormmates.
From the little I have watched of them, it appears that
Warner Brothers' latest teen-oriented drama, "Felicity,"
runs along a similar vein. Unfortunately, it's a vein that
ultimately wears thin on the discerning viewer.
Starring a host of relative unknowns, the hour-long
"Felicity" relies on a conventionally tense love triangle
and such overdone themes as the pursuit of dreams
and the innocence of youth. Keri Russell stars as
Felicity Porter, the title character who follows a hand
some high school classmate to New York University
instead of going to Stanford. The guy in question is
Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), who writes a mes
merizing paragraph in Felicity's yearbook. But neither
really knew each other during high school. The
premise of throwing away a 100 percent-paid Stanford
education for a pipe dream is rather contrived.
As if the groundwork wasn't flawed enough, the
show's directors, Jeffrey Abrams and Matt Reeves, bor
row liberally from "Ally Mcßeal" and "Dawson's Creek,"
trying to piggyback off of their popularity. Pop songs
from Madonna, Sarah McLachlan and Peter Gabriel
undercut Felicity's most introspective soul-searching
moments. This use of music is just plain annoying, and
it is clear that the technique is used solely because of its

successful implementation on other popular TV dra
mas. 1 just wonder whether "The Soundtrack to
'Felicity'" and "More Hits from 'Felicity'" have come
out yet to pump money out of the show's viewers.
Echoes of "Ally Mcßeal" come when Felicity's
thoughts are inserted into the action via voice-overs
much like those of the long-suffering Ally. Felicity is not
the feminist heroine of pre-"Ally Mcßeal" '90s TV dra
mas. Just like Ally, whose character has been labeled as
a possible step backward for women demanding equal
ity in the workplace, Felicity is also frequently befud
dled and worried that her decisions are not valid or cor
rect. Basically, 1 was just waiting for the dancing baby to
come strutting its stuff out of Felicity's dorm closet.
With the tag line, "She's about to make the best mis
take of her life," something tells me that Felicity is
about to fall in love with somebody, perhaps Noel, her
resident assistant, maybe Ben. But besides the fact that
most of us can relate to her quibbles about dorm food,
parents, and roommates, there really is no reason to
subject yourself to the melodramatic slobber and
stereotyped characters in "Felicity."
With "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as the lead-in,
"Felicity" airs on the WB network on Tuesday nights at
9 p.m. I suspect that I am not the target audience of
"Felicity," as several women who loved the premiere
have sternly pointed out to me. So look for a loyal,

though small, following to develop, just as a devoted
crowd sprang up to watch the wildly overrated
"Dawson's Creek" and the funny-but-overhyped "Ally
Mcßeal" in one year.
