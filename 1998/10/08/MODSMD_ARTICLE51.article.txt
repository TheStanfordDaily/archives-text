## The
						Goo Goo Dolls 'Dizzy Up the Girl' 
### 
The Goo Goo Dolls came out of left field
with an overnight success, 1995's smash
ballad, "Name." They followed that
chart-topper with this year's hit from the "City
of Angels" soundtrack, "Iris," a meditation on
falling from grace to fall in love. Of course,
that's not the whole story. The Goo Goo Dolls
had been around for 10 years before "Name"
brought them to national attention.
Like Extreme, the Scorpions and U2 before
them, the Goo Goo Dolls are known primari
ly for ballads, a misconception the success of
"Iris" does not help debunk. But while the
Goo Goo Dolls may know how to make hit
ballads, they also know how to make good
rock albums in the vein of the Rolling Stones.
"Dizzy Up the Girl" is a solid rock album.
While strings punctuate the record, it is main
ly a standard three-piece affair.
It won't wow any serious rock fans, but is a
pleasure to listen to and sing along with.
The first single from the album, the easy
going "Slide," is not a stand-out, but if you like
that song, you'll probably like "Dizzy Up the
Girl." The album also includes the hit "Iris,"
and more aggressive songs like the Soul
Asylum-esque"January Friend," and the dark
verse / light-chorus rocker "Dizzy."

The lyrics on this record are typical of con
temporary modern rock. Simultaneously cyni
cal and idealistic, weary and excited, they fit the
music perfectly. "Broadway" 's "See the young
man sitting / in the old man's bar / waiting for
his turn to die" is balanced by "Slide" 's "1
wanna wake up where you are /1 won't say any
thing at all / So why don't you slide?"
Upon closer inspection, however, argu
ments, lies, and unlikely causes dominate
"Dizzy Up the Girl." This record is an album of
the '90s if there ever was one. From the open
ing verse to the closing lines, the Goo Goo
Dolls let much of their optimism be obstruct
ed by negativity. However, upbeat musi often
highlights the brighter moments of the . bum,
making the album enjoyable overall.
"Dizzy Up the Girl" isn't too mutii of a
departure from the Goo Goo Dolls' pi vious
material. If you have the band's la t few
albums, this one shouldn't be too sur; rising.
If you like modern rock, "Di/7v Up the Girl"
isn't a bad place to start, either. Yet, il you're
looking for something radically new c 1 dif
ferent, I'm afraid you're going to have look
elsewhere.
