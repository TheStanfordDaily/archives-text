Do you remembet when
the word "alternative"
used to mean Nirvana
and Soundgarden instead of
Matchbox 20 and Third Eye
Blind? Like most rebellious
musical genres which achieve
mass popularity, alternative
music has been transformed by
the mainstream to convenient
ly fit radio formatting.
A similar change occured
about 20 years ago when
punk transformed into New
Wave — the Clash and the
Ramones were slowly
replaced by Culture Club and
Duran Duran. Punk was too
unpredictable, too difficult to
shrink-wrap into convnient
packages. New Wave turned
down the aggression and
added synthesizers to dull the

rougi edges, creating
"com ercial" punk.
Th Psychedelic F»' s
lived between these two

conflicting, often contra
dictory, extremes. Richard
Butler's raspy vocals and
abstract lvrics sounded like an
arty version of the Sex Pistols'
Johnny Rotten. However, the
band's sleek, melodic thrust
was more akin to the Cars, New
Wave's First commercial break
through. Still, the guitar
onslaught could also reach a
level of beautiful ugliness that
would make Sonic Youth jeal
ous. The group's sound encom
passed alienation and ambi
tion, sparkle and grit.
In other words, the Furs
tried to meld punk's aggression
with New Wave's textured
melodicism and for the first
few years, the results were
breathtaking, both for their
pretentiousness and their sin
cerity. From the relentless drive

of "India" to the assured
- nth of "Pretty in Fink," and
from the coy beauty of "Love
My Way" to the danceable des
peration of "Heartbreak Beat,"
the group took punk to sophis
ticated heights approached
only by pioneering bands like
Television and the Talking
Heads. A newly released retro
spective, "Should God Forget,"
contains all of these high
points as well as some previ
ously unavailable tracks.
Of the new material, the
live recordings are perhaps
most interesting, especially
the glossy versions of "Mack
The Knife," "Heartbeat," and
"All Of The Law." Of the unre
lcased studio material,
"Blacks / Radio" is the best,
emphasizing how effective a
saxophone can be in a punk
context.
Nonetheless, this two-disc
collection suffers from too
much music, too much stuff.

Both CDs total more than 75
minutes, which means that
while the retrospective is cer
tainly comprehensive, the col
lection also contains a healthy
dose of filler, especially
towards the end of the second
disc. Because the tracks are
arranged chronologically, this
final decline should come as
little surprise because the
band quickly ran out of ideas
in its last few albums. Indeed,
one has a difficult time telling
the difference between
"Torch," "Get A Room," and
"Until She Comes," three con
secutive tracks near the end of
the second disc.
Still, the Psychedelic Furs'
legacy stands as one of the
crucial links, along with the
Cars and the Talking Heads,
between punk and New Wave,
and "Should God Forget"
effectively chronicles the
band's most significant work.
