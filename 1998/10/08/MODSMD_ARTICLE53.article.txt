# Kent
## 'Isola' 
### 
Kent is a band from Sweden. If you think back
just a little, you'll remember the legacy of other
Swedish bands like The Cardigans, and if you
think back just a little further — to last weekend's frat
party — you'll remember ABBA. But let's not get too
down on Kent because of its campy compatriots. Not
that I dare berate the Swedish products that managed
their ways into our hearts; I still listen to "Love Fool"
in my car and practice the reedy vocals, fighting
against the inevitable break in my voice. But really,
Kent is distinguishable, Kent is rock-and-roll, Kent is
pop, Kent is from Sweden.
Kent recorded its latest release, "Isola," (RCA
Records / BMG Music) in both Swedish and English
to make its work accessible stateside and in the UK.
Accessibility isn't always a positive characteristic, but
for Kent it allows English-speaking audiences to
understand what's being sung. The songs are intrigu
ing enough to inspire further listening.
When I first played the CD, I found the music solid,
and the nasal vocals not too grating. So I nodded my
snobby approval as Kent started off proving they
would not make me want to jump out of my window
to a fate of sprained ankles and other frustrations. In
fact, that opening track is more than just tolerable;
"Lifesavers" is layered and atmospheric, with crashing
guitars, controlled feedback and soaring vocals. An
obvious single, "If You Were Here," follows, with a
metronomic bassline and vocals that are slightly
strained. (After all, how can singer Joakim Berg relax
when "she" just isn't "there?")

The tracks that follow don't
stand out much from each
other until the last few songs.
There are a few more songs
with floating chords, a couple
piano ballads, and "Bianca,"
noticeable for its solemn bass
and rudimentary guitar remi
niscent of The Cure. But
"Elvis" is a jewel, a sweet bal
ance ot formula and innova
tion, with a modern take on
'70s rock vocal melody, chorus
and guitar. The album ends
with "Glider" and "747," which
soften the strut of "Elvis" and
"Velvet" as they point out the
damning ironies of life, yet still
manage to reassure.
With bands like Radiohead,
Marion and the Verve holding
down the rock >cene in Britain
and abroad, Kent faces fierce
competition for audience and
acclaim. But as mainland

China insisted in the 19705, peaceful coexistence is pos
sible, and often necessary. Swedish darling Kent deserves
international recognition, and fewer jabs about how
much loakim sounds like Radiohead's Thorn Yorke.
