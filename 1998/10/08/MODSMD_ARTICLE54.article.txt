# Mister Jones
## 'Hail Mary' 
### 
Mister Jones' frontman, Ali Dee Theodore, is a
successful hip-hop producer. Unfortunately
for audiophiles everywhere, he formed
Mister Jones as an attempt to ride the wave of hip
hop / mellow rock bands. Even more unfortunate is Ali
Dee's attempt to sing. The band uses tired, repetitive
chord progressions and unimaginative rhythms to cre
ate a sound that can only be described one way: bad.
Each of the 14 tracks on the album sounds like 311
on horse tranquilizers mixed with Color Me Badd,
with lead guitar courtesy of a middle-aged rock band
that pJays in bars.

Even though Ali Dee has been
producing re-cords since the early
'90s, he cannot produce a rock
album. Not only does he have a ter
rible voice (he sounds like Leonard
Cohen trying to be "young and
hip"), he sounds even worse
because he layers the myriad vocal
tracks in a jarring way.
Not only is the production style
unpleasant, but the lyrics are terri
ble. Most of the songs are written
about love and girls. The few excep
tions are "Right Hand Man," about
masturbation, and "When I'm
Down," about oral sex. I guess Ali
Dee is trying to be funny, but these
songs offer no entertainment what
soever. The three interludes on the

album are just plain dumb, although I am assuming
Mister Jones intended for these to be humorous.
The one somewhat likeable track is "What a Ting,"
which has the added talent of dancehall artist Mr.
Phang. Besides that single exception, every song
sounds the same and makes the listener want to
lament the album's purchase. Ali Dee needs to stop
trying to be a rock star. He needs to go back to his day
job on the other side of the microphone and put
Mister (ones on the shelf. Forever.
