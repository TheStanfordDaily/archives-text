# Veda Hille
## 'Spine' 
### 
Veda Hille's "Spine" is
certainly something
different. While Hille
may fit the broad category of
"female singer-songwriter,"
she isn't typical of that
classification.
What is most apparent in
Hille's music is not what is
there, but what is not. Her
arrangements are spare and
muted, as is the music itself.
Empty and quiet spaces
abound, and the instruments
are often used very sparingly.
This approach is some
what reminiscent of Kristen
Hersh's recent album, "Hips
and Makers," but in every
other way, "Spine" is differ
ent. Hille's unusual instru
mentation (one song fea
tures yakbak and saw) and
distorted background vocals
contribute to the uncanny
sound of her music, as well
as its underlying tension.
The result is an album which
isn't very accessible, but
makes for an interesting lis
tening experience.
Hille's singing style
sounds at times like a cross

between Ani DiFranco's
roughness and P.J. Harvey's
Gothic moodiness. However,
Hille seems equally inspired
by fellow Canadian Joni
Mitchell. While not as mel
low as Mitchell's, her vocals
float and leap in the same
manner, painting an abstract
picture of life and its com
plications. Hille's flat voice
suggests a certain weariness
from living life.
The tension apparent
throughout this album is
best expressed on "Bellyfish,"
an intense workout on gui
tar, bass, drum kit and cello.
Another stand-out, "strange,
sad," is a more conventional
slow waltz. "INSTRUC
TIONS," built around a pre
viously published poem, is a
disturbing list with direc
tions such as, "Don't think of
it as reasonable, think of it as
terrifying."
This album is certainly not
for everyone, but, for those
who are adventurous, it is
will be a striking change from
run-of-the-mill pop music.
