## Free Sexx Tarts and stud muffins: Food's connection to sex 
### Roxy Sass 
Men swoon at the sight of beach bunnies eat
ing frozen bananas. Women know what it means
to order lobster on a date, and everyone has his
own whipped cream fantasy. In other words,
human nature loves to connect food to sex.
The idea of pairing our two favorite hobbies
isn't a new one. Ancient aphrodisiac recipes
from centuries past show early civilizations were
just as fixated on food and sex as our present
Viagra-popping society. In days of yore, eating
olives supposedly made a person more likely to
attract a marriage partner. Powdered rhino
horn and dried tiger penis were snacked on to
help remedy a limp libido (not the tiger's). And
citrus fruits really delivered some bang for the
shopper's buck: Oranges and grapefruits
cleansed a person's sexual energy, and their peels
were used as prehistoric diaphragms.
More recently, soldiers in World War II made
the food / sex connection, and could be heard to
yell, "Save your green Smarties!" This reminded
them that a soldier who made it home could toss
the candies onto the green grass for the kiddie* to
find. With any luck, the candies would be so hard
to find that the soldier and his wile would have
plenty of time to "get reauquainttd" upstairs.
Hnter modern times. Rhino and tiger have
been left thankfully behind, and M&M's have
taken the place of earlier green candies. But the
link between food and sex remains strong.
Today's consumer market caters to the hungry
lover. The recently released book "Intercourse"
gives recipes to make supper sexy and even dis
plays the finished dishes on tastefully arranged
naked bodies. Spanish fly, that legendary love
powder, now comes in a placebo form (read: no
longer made of ground beetles), in flavors like
coffee, cherry, cola and mint. You can even find
find pamphlets that advertise edible concoctions
designed to "turn men into ramrods of passion."
Mut with choices like these, you're more likely to
get ripped off than ravished.
Where to turn? When it comes down to it, Tlo
Mo dining hall may offer better resources than
the local apothecary. A few basic kitchen items
and .1 >midgen <>i ingenuity will work just as well
its expensive store bought syrups. lor instance,
chocolate sauce tastes every bit as good on a pair
of well defined pecs as it does on ice-cream.
Because we're talkin' about the sauce, it's safe
with condoms and won't even stain your com
forter, as long as you don't use oily hot fudge.
(However, a bottle of Hershey's on the night
stand may start a few rumors.)
If your palate requires texture as well as taste,
fruit is a good way to go. Strawberries are rough,
bananas soft, and papaya pleasantly slick. For
especially brave souls, the spikes ot the horned
melon or the scratchy fur of a kiwi could be
incorporated into sex. A person might even
combine the chocolate sauce with the fruit to
make a love fondue of sorts.
Finally, don't forget that renowned social
lubricant, alcohol. Now, when Miss Sass brings
up alcohol, she isn't talking about the use of beer
by certain unsavory persons to lower their
already-tenuous inhibitions. Rather, she refers
to the more inventive uses for booze that can
spice up romantic situations. Classy and clever

boys and girls have been known to use a colored
liqueur, like Kahlua or Bailey's, to finger paint
on their lovers. No doubt Iht# recipient willfedtljf
terribly exotic with all kinds of designs on his or
her body. The alcohol evaporates quickly as well,
lending a nice cooling sensation. <* **
However, take a few words of warning to
heart before you bolt down to Tres Ex. The
aforementioned cooling sensation of alcohol
should be closely monitored. An unfortunate
acquaintance of Mis# Sass was enjoying being
slathered with JackJDaniels by his lustsome part
ner, when the liquid found its way into places it
should not have ventured. The result was a rapid
trip to the bathroom alid some fervent scrub
bing with soap to stop the burning. Needless to
say, it's been a while since the boy felt comfort
able around a bottle of the stuff.
So, when playing with alcohol, or other
potent foods like peppers and peppermint, take
some precautions. Ask about allergies, keep a
sponge handy and stay away from open flames
when booze is involved. Nothing ruins a roman
tic evening faster than private parts en flambe.
Also, ladies, the chemical balance of your most
delicate placc> does not take kindly to excessive
sugar, if yott know what 1 mean.
Lastly; beware products bearing the label
"edible"' that intuitively should not be. Candy
underwear may seem like God's gift to lingerie,
but it* neither particularly tasty nor dignified to
ingest Plus, it will stick to the roof of your
mouth, soVou may end up smacking like a dog
eating peanut butter when you should be smil
ing invitingly. Best to stick with things you
might find on a aormal shopping list. - v
That said, grab your Safeway Club Cm hit
the super mwket shelves and find out what real
ly powders your dough out. Maybe you have a
thing tor raspberry;.mi. Maybe a bagel tills your
eyes with desire. Maybe potato salad is the per
fect ingredient for a randyromp. Whatever youc
passion, have a sense of humor and remember
what mom always said You're not done until
you clean your plate.
