# Belly up
## Senior pub night a tradition, drunk or sober 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
Hundreds of animated, smiling seniors
crowded the narrow corridors of Com
padres, a bar on F.I Camino Real, two
weeks ago. Packed like sardines, students
shouted brief, but happy greetings to old
friends and faces, before being swept on
by the mad rush of the intoxicated herd.
Is this claustrophobic nightmare actu
ally a must-attend social event in dis
guise? Many Stanford seniors give a
wholehearted yes.
The senior pub night, happening al
most every Thursday night throughout
the school year, is a long-time tradition of
catching up with friends, escaping from
senior stress and drinking your beverage
of choice.
"It's a chance to get off campus and
meet up with people you haven't seen
since freshman year," said co-terminal
student Ellie Mertz, a veteran of last
year's pub nights.
It is a rite of passage for all Stanford
students. Through the first three years,
the pub night remains somewhat of a mys
tery. "Where does my RA go every
Thursday night? What is a pub?" many
freshmen have been known to ask.

For most, though, the senior year
comes alarmingly quick, and before they
know it, it is their turn to uncover the
event that is the senior pub night.

Last Thursday, the second pub night of
the year, took place at the Alpine Inn. for-

lated into Stanford-speak: Zott's.
Tonight's hoopla will take place at
the Dutch Goose.
Jen Slaski, one of the four senior
class presidents who is in charge of
the events, feels that it is all about
escaping from the stress of being a
senior.
"Senior year, you have all these
things to deal with," Slaski said.
"[Pub night] is a place where every
body can just hang out."
The first event at Compadres
drew roughly 800 people, accord
ing to Slaski. The bar featured a
coupon for a free margarita, beer
or soft drink for each Stanford se
nior.
"We try to work out specials

with each bar," Slaski said.
At tonight's event at the Goose,
all fountain drinks will be free, and
students will receive one dollar off
all pitchers of beer. By focusing
also on specials for non-alcoholic
beverages, the senior class presi
dents wanted to appeal to the en
tire senior community — including
those who do not drink alcohol,
Slaski explained.
And as of last week, seniors
have an easier way to avoid the dif
ficultly of assigning a designated
driver. Last Thursday's pub night
was the inaugural evening of Mar
guerite service to and from Zott's.
For two dollars each way, students
could get a ride.
The available shuttles are in
tended to allow students to drink
without having to worry about dri
ving, or to just avoid having to drive
or find a place to park, Slaski said.

The Marguerite service may be
a short-lived option, though, due to
poor turnout.
"We didn't get as enthusiastic a
response as we had hoped for."
Slaski said. "We're hoping for a
better response [tonight]."
If the turnout for the Mar
guerite shuttles aren't different
tonight, they may be cancelled al
together for future pub nights, due
to lack of funding. The presidents
are looking to the University as a
possible source of funding for the
shuttles, if the demand is there.
Potential venues for future pub
nights include the Blue Chalk Cafe
and Q's Cafe, both in downtown
Palo Alto, and Armadillo Willie's
on San Antonio Road in Los Altos.
