## Senior pub night a tradition, drunk or sober 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
Hundreds of animated, smiling seniors
crowded the narrow corridors of Com
padres, a bar on F.I Camino Real, two
weeks ago. Packed like sardines, students
shouted brief, but happy greetings to old
friends and faces, before being swept on
by the mad rush of the intoxicated herd.
Is this claustrophobic nightmare actu
ally a must-attend social event in dis
guise? Many Stanford seniors give a
wholehearted yes.
The senior pub night, happening al
most every Thursday night throughout
the school year, is a long-time tradition of
catching up with friends, escaping from
senior stress and drinking your beverage
of choice.
"It's a chance to get off campus and
meet up with people you haven't seen
since freshman year," said co-terminal
student Ellie Mertz, a veteran of last
year's pub nights.
It is a rite of passage for all Stanford
students. Through the first three years,
the pub night remains somewhat of a mys
tery. "Where does my RA go every
Thursday night? What is a pub?" many
freshmen have been known to ask.

For most, though, the senior year
comes alarmingly quick, and before they
know it, it is their turn to uncover the
event that is the senior pub night.

Last Thursday, the second pub night of
the year, took place at the Alpine Inn. for-
