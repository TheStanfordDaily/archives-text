# IR students start academic journal

### Meredith Rowe 
After several months of plan
ning and dedication, students have
produced the new Stanford Journal
of International Relations, which
will be released in print for the first
time within the coming weeks.
Led by Editor in C hief Hugh
Handeyside, a senior majoring in
International Relations, the semi
annual journal aims to provide a
forum for interdisciplinary discus
sion on current international rela
tions and global affairs.
"Right now, there are not many
opportunities outside the class
room to have good discussions
about these topics," Handeyside
said. "But this journal provides that
opportunity for people to get in
volved with current issues. Basical
ly, it's a group of people with simi
lar interests getting together."
Funding came almost entirely
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences, including departments
such as political science and in
ternational relations.
Each issue will have a theme re

lated to international relations. The
first issue focuses on globalization
and includes material from a vari
ety of sources, ranging from an un
dergraduate student to Alex Inke
les, a senior Hoover fellow who
submitted an excerpt from his yet
to-be released book.
Master's student Shawn Salmon,
who currently works on soliciting
alumni articles for the journal, said
that much of the reason behind the
journal's creation stemmed from
the demand for a medium where
those interested in international re
lations and similar topics could
share their ideas.
"Stanford's really rich in re
sources for international relations,"
Salmon said, a student in the Russ
ian and Eastern European Studies
Department. "However, until the
journal was created, there wasn't a
published forum for students to
write and read each other's works.
"This is a really good opportuni
ty to work with experts in the field
and make contact with professors,"
she said.
The journal will also be a re

source to help students stay in
touch with the events happening
around the world, Salmon said.
"A student who has no idea
what's going on in the world right
now can pick up the journal and
read something well written that
will be informative," she said.
Although most submissions for
the first issue were by graduate stu
dents, the journal will target under
graduates and is not strictly for in
ternational relations majors.
Rather, the publication will include
submissions from a variety of
sources, as long as the material has
something to do with global affairs,
Handeyside said.
"We intend for this to be some
thing close to a scholarly journal
that has application to other parts
of the community," he said.
"Hopefully, it will be represen
tative of all communities at Stan
ford — students and faculty. The
journal will pay attention to issues
of interest to all Stanford people,
including the well-informed ob
server. The first issue really reflects
that."

Submitted material falls under a
range of disciplines, including polit
ical science, economics, anthropol
ogy, history and the environment,
"Hopefully someday we'll ex
pand — maybe with subscriptions
and ads," he said. "But for now
we're just trying to carve a niche.
We're trying to get it seen by as
many as possible."
A large amount of time was
spent over the past months by staff
members in preparation.
"The time required for the jour
nal really varies," Handeyside said.
"The first issue required an intense
amount of my time this summer,
but hopefully that will spread out.
The workload is as much as you
want it to be, and as much as you're
willing to give."
"It has been an amazing educa
tional experience for me," he said.
"I feel like I've learned a lot about
streamlining and editing, as well as
what makes good writing."
The journal will also be posted
on the World Wide Web at
