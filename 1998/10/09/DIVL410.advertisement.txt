OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREAS v
* of Power Management, /
Video, Data-Comm, Wireless,
Power Control, and Motion control.
Analog Design Engineers
If you are graduating with an BS/MS/PhD EE with very strong analog design skills,
these provide the opportunity to learn advanced IC design while
developing engineering skills. Design Engineers will have the chance to
work in > >dvanced BiCMOS/CMOS process technologies. You will also design and
devel»£> analog and mixed-srfenal ICs, including chip definition, circuit design,
simulation, layout supervision, debug, characterization and release to production.
Test Development Engineers
If you are gradj/nting with a BS/MS EE, enjoy working on analog and mixed-signal
circuits, aptfhave computer programming skills, our Test Development
Engiripefing opportunities may be your ticket. You will use your understanding of
.jnslog and digital circuits to design hardware and software that performs complex
electrical screening of our mixed-signal ICs on automatic test equipment. You will
insure this testing correlates to laboratory benchmarks. You will work closely with
our IC Design, Product and Applications Engineers to define and implement a test
program that guarantees parametric and functional operation of the IC.
Product Engineers
If you are graduating with a BS/MS EE and have a preference for analog and
mixed-signal circuits, our Product Engineering positions may be of interest to you.
Strong analog skills are integral, as you will evaluate, characterize and introduce
new products to manufacturing. Vou will also be responsible for analyzing,
enhancing and forecasting Wafer Sort and Final Test yields and supporting produc
tion to resolve product issues.
Product Marketing Engineers
If you're graduating with a BSEE and have a strong desire to be involved in market
ing, product launch and promotion, with an eye on becoming a Product Manager,
this position will get you up to speed in a hurry. You'll be responsible for manag
ing specific products and reporting to a senior marketing manager, while actively
participating in product definition, planning and execution of marketing strategies
and promotions. 0-3 years' of marketing or application experience desired.

The last challenge
of a socially
conscious society?
Depression strikes millions- indiscriminately. Depression is simply a suppression
of brain activity that makes life unbearable. And even though depression is
readily treatable, only 1 in 5 ever seeks treatment. Why do so many just drag
themselves along or eventually seek relief through suicide? First, there's the lack
of awareness of depression- as an illness and as the throat that it is to each and
every one of us. Second, there's the unwarranted negative stigma attached to it.
You know, the mental' thing. It's time to collectively face depression. To know it's
an illness, not a weakness. And it's a xiiirnf >iTf rt
