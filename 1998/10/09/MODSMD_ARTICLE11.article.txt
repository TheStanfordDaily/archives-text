## Cease-fire in Kosovo Rebels' move puts pressure on Milosevic 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — Ethnic Albanian rebels
fighting for independence for the
Serbian province of Kosovo
declared a unilateral cease-fire
Thursday, putting more pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo
sevic to end his crackdown.
Tensions between Milosevic and
the United States, which is pressing
for NATO airstrikes against Serb
led troops, intensified as Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright
declared Thursday that time was
running out for the Yugoslav presi
dent to comply with U.N. demands.
Albright said a united NATO backs
airstrikes.
About 20 carloads of U.S.,
British and Australian embassy
staffers headed out of Belgrade as a
safety measure, even as a U.S.
envoy returned for more talks with
Milosevic.
A statement distributed by the
Kosovo Liberation Army in Koso
vo's capital Pristina said the rebel
command "has decided to refrain
from all military activity" starting
Friday.
Kosovo is a southern province of
Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of
Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor
independence.
Although the KLA has been
driven from all but a few scattered
areas, the announcement is politi
cally significant. Milosevic launched
his crackdown Feb. 28 after attacks
by KLA rebels against police and
soldiers in the majority Albanian
province.
He has insisted he needs to
maintain a military and police pres
ence in the area to guard against
further KLA attacks.
In the statement, the KLA said
its guerrillas would defend them
selves if attacked. The rebels
demanded international monitoring
of the cease-fire.
Despite international pressure
and NATO threats, Milosevic has
refused to openly declare a cease
fire, even though there has been no
major fighting in Kosovo during the
past week.

He considers the Kosovo rebels
"terrorists and bandits," and any
cease-fire on his part would legit
imize them as a negotiating partner,
one of his associates said on condi
tion of anonymity.
The United States says Milosevic
has not complied with U.N. Securi
ty Council demands for a cease-fire,
the partial withdrawal of his troops,
and the return of refugees to their
villages.
In Brussels. Belgium, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke briefed
Albright and NATO officials on the
results of his three rounds of talks
with Milosevic this week.
Albright told Holbrooke to
return to Belgrade for more talks,
amid signs of opposition within
NATO to an attack without further
diplomatic efforts. Albright said
Holbrooke would be delivering a
message that the time for a diplo
matic settlement in Kosovo was "all
but gone." She demanded full com
pliance with U.N. resolutions to end
the crackdown and said "half-mea
sures" would not be enough.
British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook also Thursday emphasized
NATO's united resolve after a
meeting of the six-nation Contact
Group on Yugoslavia.
If Milosevic doesn't comply with
the U.N. resolution, "he will be
responsible for the consequences,
and they will be grave," Cook said
after meeting with foreign ministers
from the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
Russia's foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, met Milosevic Thursday en
route to London for a meeting of
the major powers most deeply
involved in the negotiations. Russia
strongly opposes using force to
resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is
expected to deliver that message
when he meets Albright in London.
At the White House on Thurs
day, President Clinton said the
United States would vote to autho
rize military strikes against Serbia if
Milosevic "continues to defy the
international community."
"In the days ahead my counter
parts in Europe will be making sim
ilar decisions," the president said.
