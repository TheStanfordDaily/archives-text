# Clinton to face impeachment inquiry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —A somber House
today authorized a wide-ranging impeachment
inquiry of President Clinton, making him the
third chief executive in history to face the threat
of being removed from office.
The investigation was approved by a 258-176
vote, with 31 Democrats joining majority
Republicans.
"We want to get this behind us and behind
the country and move on," said Judiciary Com
mittee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-111. "It's an
onerous, miserable, rotten duty, but we have to
do it or we break faith with the people who sent
us here."
Republicans touted their open-ended Water
gate-style inquiry in a debate that stretched far
beyond the planned two hours. Democrats
argued in vain to limit the investigation to the
Monica Lewinsky affair and finish it by year's
end.
The controversy "has hurt our nation and it
has hurt our children," House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt declared in a final plea for limits.
"We must not compound the hurt."
Democratic leaders were resigned, however,
to the idea that conservatives in their party and
those with tough election races only a month
away were defecting to the GOP plan.
Republicans rejected Democratic arguments
that Clinton's attempt to conceal an affair with
Ms. Lewinsky was not impeachable conduct,
saying the issue was not sexual conduct but lying
under oath.
"The purpose of this process is to examine
the public trust, and if it is breached, to repair

it," said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican
from Clinton's home state of Arkansas.
After lobbying Democrats for days, the
White House stood by to watch the inevitable
vote, offering a plea to set aside politics.
"To date this process... has been infected
with politics," presidential spokesman Joe Lock
hart said. "It should be a serious constitutional
effort and as we move forward, it's our hope that
the seriousness and the constitutional nature of
it returns." Clinton urged lawmakers to cast a
"vote of principle and conscience."
The GOP resolution directs the Judiciary
Committee to investigate "whether sufficient

grounds exist for the House of Representatives
to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton, president of the Unit
ed States of America.'
The House rejected by a mostly party-line
vote of 236-198 a Democratic alternative that
would have limited the scope, set a Dec. SI
deadline and asked that the Judiciary Commit
tee first consider the historical standards for
impeachment before deciding Clinton's fate.
A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll out today
found 53 percent of those surveyed oppose
impeachment hearings while 44 percent favor
them.
