# Economy worries rise as dollar falls
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
high-flying U.S. dollar plunged dra
matically for a second straight day,
taking many U.S. stocks down as
well Thursday. The world's eco
nomic troubles hit closer to home
despite international officials' best
efforts to prove they are fighting
back.
The dollar suffered its biggest
two-day drop against the Japanese
yen in 25 years as panic selling
swept the world's $1.5 trillion-a-day
currency markets. The free fall was
blamed in large part on hedge
funds, the once-obscure invest
ments favored by the wealthy.
Hedge funds have been dumping
dollars in recent days on a belief it
will weaken further as prospects for

the U.S. economy darken. The dol
lar is now worth nearly 20 percent
less versus the Japanese yen than at
its August peak.
The turmoil in currency markets
also spilled into stocks. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell as
much as 274 points before largely
recovering in afternoon trading.
Broader market indicators stayed
lower, however. Even before the
dollar's decline, investors were
upset that weeklong talks in Wash
ington had produced no major new
plan.
Michel Camdessus, head of the
182-nation International Monetary
Fund, and James Wolfensohn, head
of the World Bank, took exception
to the market's belief that theses

sions had dissolved into wrangling
over the proper approach. "[T]here
is a way out of the crisis. It is an
uphill way, but it is there,"'
Camdessus said.
The two agencies are moving
aggressively forward on a program
to make themselves more open, to
improve banking regulation world
wide and to provide billions in assis
tance to damaged countries,
Camdessus and Wolfensohn said.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Wednesday that a
"fear-induced psychological
response" grips the world's markets
after the shock of Russia's default
on debt in August. Greenspan
pledged that U.S. monetary author
ities would be "especially alert" to

the need for action, a comment the
markets read as promising further
rate cuts on the heels of last week's
quarter point cut.
However, the prospect of further
Fed rate cuts also helped spur the
dollar's selloff. Lower U.S. rates,
while spurring borrowing in this
country, make dollar-denominated
assets less attractive to overseas
investors.
If foreign investors start dump
ing their U.S. holdings, that could
accelerate the slide in U.S. stocks,
already 17 percent below their July
peak. That in turn could cause mar
ket-set U.S. interest rates to rise,
offsetting the economic momentum
the Fed had hoped to provide bv
lowering short-term rates.
