Saramango wins Nobel prize
STOCKHOLM. Sweden (AP) — Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, an
outspoken nonconformist who has a soft spot for the common man, was
named the winner today of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him one
of Portugal's most popular contemporary writers, and his works have
been translated into more than 20 languages.
"I'm personally very happy," the writer said today in Frankfurt. Ger
many. where he was attending a book fair. "I'm also happy for my coun
try."
The Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work
that "with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony con
tinually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality."

"He invokes tradition in a way that in the current state of things can be
described as radical," the Academy said in the citation for the $ C ->7B,(KK)
prize.
Microsoft denied access to interviews
BOS TON (AP) — Microsoft lost a legal battle today to get what it hoped
would serve as powerful evidence to stymie the federal government's
antitrust lawsuit — access to interviews done by two professors with exec
utives from rival Netscape.
Professors David Yoffie of Harvard University and Michael
Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had refused to
hand over tapes and documents in which Netscape executives admit mis

takes in their efforts to compete against Microsoft.
U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns ruled against Microsoft, saying the
professors had shown the tapes were made in confidence.
Microsoft spokesman James Cullinan said the company will consider
an appeal, saying the court fight wasn't about academic freedom, but
about access to evidence Microsoft needs to defend itself.
To win the mammoth antitrust case, the government must show that
Microsoft crossed the line from innovation to calculated schemes that
choked rivals and hurt consumers.
The several hours of tapes, which include interviews with Netscape
Chairman Jim Barksdale. company co-founder Marc Andreessen and
more than 40 other employees, contain off-the-record comments, private
conversations and admissions of strategic missteps, Cusumano said.
