## Editorial An elegy: 'The Thinker' 
### 
A beloved Stanford icon is on
the road, and we're all torn
up about its empty pedestal

IN FRONT OF Meyer Library, there
stands a solitary pedestal with nothing
on top of it. Freshmen, it was not
always this way.
Once upon a time, Auguste Rodin's
famous symbol of deep, cultivated
thought. ' The Thinker," proudly sat upon
that very pedestal. More than a mere hunk
of metal, the Thinker inspired, encour
aged. consoled, invigorated and — most
importantly — thought.
Inspired by Dante's "Divine Comedy,"
Rodin originally conceived the Thinker as
only one piece in a much larger sculpture,
" The Clates of Hell." But currently our
statue is on loan to the Rockefeller Center
and thus, sadly, left to contemplate far
away from his Stanford home.
In the face of such an insufferable loss,
Stanford students should take the time to
reflect on the significance of the Thinker's
presence on campus and examine their
own feelings about this special statue.
First, we wonder whether the adminis
tration even considered the vocal student
response that inevitably would result from
ihoving our beloved Thinker. We went
straight to the top with this important
question.
President Gerhard Casper, after an ini
tial chuckle, suggested that despondent
students "take a walk on this splendid day
to see a smaller version of 'The Thinker' at
the Rodin Sculpture Garden," but also
admitted that he "could imagine that the
absence of [the larger] Thinker would be
traumatic for students."
perhaps it is actually the administra
tion's intention that the nihilistic view
point that the barren pedestal promotes
will force students to reflect on their own
materialistic desires. Perhaps not.
Maybe the real aim is to bolster the

Overseas Studies Program. You know: Be
like " The Thinker." Go think somewhere
far, far away from Stanford.
But, then again, maybe not.
While these ideas merit some fleeting
consideration, we decided to push even
further in our quest for real answers.
When asked about the situation of the
Thinker, an associate dean claimed (jok
ingly. we hope) that "serious consideration
was given to sending Meyer Library on
tour to accompany the statue." Not sur
prisingly, he added that eventually "the
idea was abandoned."
In our opinion, the most likely scenario
is that when the Thinker left on tour, no
one remembered to provide a substitute.
Such tremendous oversight will not easily
be forgotten by diligent Stanford students.
While entrenched deep in the process
of academic inquiry in Meyer Library's 24-
Hour Study Room, it is the Thinker that
provides us with the motivation to stay and
study, as those acquainted with the pon
derous statue's uncanny powers of inspira
tion and encouragement know only too
well. After all, Rodin created "The
Thinker" specifically to portray the inter
nal torment of the human condition; what
better symbol of a Stanford student during
Dead Week could possibly exist?
Thus, the only natural conclusion, it
seems, is that the absence of our Thinker
places the very academic standing of Stan
ford at stake.
But let us try to move towards a solu
tion. What might be placed upon that lofty
pedestal as a temporary substitute? Ger
hard. the Living Thinker? A scantily clad
female version of Rodin's bronze (it's only
fair)? An iMac? Every single student who
ever "played" in the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band? The
sketchy textbook guy?
None of these ideas seem quite right.
We must face the truth — a horrendous
truth more undesirable than Dante's fiery
Inferno itself. Perhaps it is true that, as
President Casper proposed, "Nothing
could substitute for ' The Thinker.'"
