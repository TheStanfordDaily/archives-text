# Lauren Oster
## Sleeping with the enemy 
### 
IN MY FIRST few
days back on campus,
my "How was your
summer?" conversations
have sounded like the
introductions at Alco
holics Anonymous meet
ings: "My name is Lauren

Oster. 1... I spent the summer at Harvard."
I did indeed opt to spend two months
and a large sum of money at that much
maligned forerunner on the "Nation's Best
Universities" lists.
Like any Harvard freshman. I gawked at
Widener Library and choked down too
expensive meals under the the stern marble
gaze of John Adams and Franklin I). Roo
sevelt. Oddly enough, it is not the time I
spent in the sheltering arms of a rival uni
versity that I confess with dismay. I'm
embarassed by the fact that I liked Harvard.
I liked it a lot.
Enrolling at one of America's most pres
tigious universities may not sound like a
moral shortcoming. Prior to my departure
for Cambridge, however, I found that I had
a lot of rationalizing to do. Harvard has
always been something of an Evil Empire
for me. My friends in the Ivy League were
consistently condescending when I men
tioned that I was studying at Stanford.
"Ah. how amusing. The Harvard of the
West."
Somehow, my school seemed the shabby
younger sibling of the old boys in New Eng
land. My rebuttals to their taunts became
more and more vehement, and more and
more ridiculous. I countered their stories of
the frozen East with sunny Kodak moments
from Big Game, Full Moon on the Ouad.
and Friday-night barbecues at the Toyon
Eating Clubs. I told stories of dormmates

with Olympic medals, amazing relation
ships that dwarfed their online romances
and roommates who could spin straw into
gold. I claimed that I'd rather have a soul
than a Harvard Student ID.
I feared that I had sold that soul when I
packed my overimaginative Stanford ego
and moved back East. I told mysell that I
would collect damning evidence of Califor
nian superiority. I was convinced that inti
mate knowledge of my foes was necessary
to ensure their defeat. If I did make a pact
with the Devil, it was amply justified in the
months to come — but not for the reasons I
anticipated.
Harvard's idiosyncrasies were initially as
easy to ridicule as I had hoped they would
be. The weather was, predictably, disgust
ing. I felt more like a sea monkey than an
academic as I sweated away two months in
the universally non-air-conditioned build
ings of Harvard Yard (Stanford 1, Harvard
0).
The denizens of Cambridge were as
ridiculously preppy as I could have wished:
John Harvard wore khakis. So did Matt
Damon. So did every student I stood in line
behind at Au Bon Fain (Stanford 2, Har
vard 0).
And. dear reader, Harvard professors
are the intellectual sadists who people your
worst nightmares. They force you to eat,
sleep and breathe musty academia (Stan
ford 3, Harvard 0 — game point).
Though I joked to my friends that I was
studying in Cambridge to subvert the domi
nant paradigm, however, I found that it
steadily subverted me. In the course of the
semester, I came to realize that the very
place I loathed was actually pretty endear
ing.
I bade a fond farewell to the stinky old

Charles River on my taxi ride back to
Logan Airport in August; I never did go
swimming, as the water is more toxic than
Dining Services coffee, but the way it
reflected fireworks on the Fourth of July
brought a tear to my cynical eye. New Eng
land, if horridly muggy, is beautiful in the
summer. I'm still in contact with my khaki
clad "summer fling," Lukas. For a comput
er science major who works at The Harvard
Crimson, he definitely knows how to have a
good time.
And I now have a deep respect for my
much-maligned Harvard English profes
sors; they are two of the most brilliant and
engaging women 1 have ever met.
I am in no immediate danger of aban
doning Stanford for the siren call of fries
and mayonnaise at Tommy's House of
Pizza in Cambridge. I wouldn't trade my
thinking place in the Toyon courtyard for
all of the Widener Libraries in the world.
And I'll never find East Coast analogs for
my beloved roommates. Stanford and Har
vard are, indeed, nothing alike — but I
value my memories from each.
I will continue, I'm sure, to tease my
crimson-clad friends; I'm a Stanford girl and
I consider it my job. Condescension, how
ever, is a pretty immature response to con
descension, and I'm no longer so likely to
wear my prejudices on my sleeve. My mock
ery of Harvard made me no less ridiculous
than Berkeley students who tell me I'm eli
tist and pampered because I go to Stanford.
Well, maybe a little less ridiculous. Cal
sucks.

has a higher GPA at Harvard than at Stan
ford and notes that science and math
requirements suck. Her column will appear
