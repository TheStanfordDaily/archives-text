Criticism of guide was misled
We wonder what the editorial board
intended to imply when it stated that "class

selection would he an easier and more
informed process... if there was an impar
tial guide." We can only wonder what basis
the editorial board has for questioning the
impartiality of the Course Guide and its staff.
Not only has the Course Guide staff attempt
ed to convey each class evaluation in a fair
and accurate fashion, but each of its mem
bers also paid special attention to staying
away from the departments in which he or
she majored to avoid any unfair assessment
of the quality of certain classes. We question
the editorial board's motives, as well as its
journalistic integrity, in view of this baseless
claim.
In addition, it seems that the professional
ism and the integrity of the Course Guide
staff were also questioned by board when it
stated that "the staff of the guide owes it to
the faculty to run the kind of professional,
responsible operation to whom faculty can
feel comfortable turning over information."
None of the members of the editorial board
were present during the creation of the
Course Guide, nor did thev ever meet with

us in person to evaluate the quality of our
work. This makes us doubt that the editorial
board has any basis on which to judge the
quality and integrity of the Course Guide
and of its staff. Additionally, we feel that the
faculty should have no say in how it is evalu
ated, that the faculty should play no role in
the evaluation process, and that any role it
could play would in some cases be designed
to improve their ratings. The Course Guide
is an organization catering to the student
body, not to the faculty.
The editorial board also criticized the
usability of the Course Guide, stating that "it
lists last year's courses without updates from
the Bulletin or Time Schedule or whether
they are still taught and taught by the same
instructor." Had the editorial board taken
the time to give the Course Guide a careful
look before criticizing it.it would have real
ized that the 1998-W Bulletin constitutes the
backbone of the database. Only comments
matching class / professor pairings relevant
to this academic year are included. All infor
mation in the Course Guide is relevant to

classes that will be taught.
As for the lime Schedule, the Course
Guide staff is currently working on translat
ing it to a database-compatible format, which
is the only way to add it to the site.
In addition, the editorial board mentions
institutionalization and expansion of the staff
of the Course Guide as a means of improv
ing its quality and continued presence. Insti
tutionalization and expansion of the staff
were two of the concerns we put forth in our
phone interview with the editor in chief. We
resent that the editorial board attempts to
take credit for them by putting them forward
as its own original ideas. The board also
attempts to take credit for ideas concerning
advertising on the Course Guide Web site as
a means of increasing its financial resources,
and expanding to the other schools compos
ing Stanford University.
Finally, the editorial board believes that
the Course Guide should be funded by the
ASSU, independently from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. This statement
reflects the editorial board's misunderstand

ing of the bureaucratic politics involved in
the creation of the Course Guide. The
School of Humanities and Sciences controls
access to the evaluations, and will insure its
institutional control on how they are used. It
would be very appreciated if the board had a
clear understanding of the issues it debates
before making callous statements.
In conclusion, we feel that the editorial
board's evaluation of the success of the
Course Guide is misinformed and unfair,
and that its journalistic integrity and rigor are
poor at best. We also expect the editorial
board to go on record to rectify any undocu
mented and unjustified criticism of the
Course Guide and its staff. We would like to
thank the other members of the staff who
helped make the Course Guide a reality, but
who were forgotten by the editorial board:
Patrick Coffman, Bobby Beaver, Michael
Levin, and David Searl.
Matt Pearl, Sacha Zadmehran, and Patrick
CofTman
