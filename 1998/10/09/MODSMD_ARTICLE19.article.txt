## Relish the days of youth and debauchery

I ALWAYS CRINGE at the induce
ment. "Enjoy these years, for they are
the best o! your life." It's a thrilling and
terrifying edict that has every chance of
being true.
American society allocates the college
years lor us to be young and relatively care
tree. Institutions and individuals alike give
us tree rein in order to fuel the beauty, hap
piness and potential of young people. All
the while, however, the specter of real
world responsibilities casts a shadow over
our heads, reminding us that eventually col
lege must come to an end. The question is,
how do we make the most of it?
Immediately preceding and following
the college years, dc facto restrictions con
strain our lives. Before, parents, eight-hour
class days and borrowed cars reminded us
that we were still in high school and not
quite grown up. Then, 1 wanted nothing
more than to graduate. Now. the threats of
bills, unemployment and sparse living space
lurk off campus to remind college graduates
just how grown-up they are. My reaction to
this is to delay my graduation from college
for as long as possible.

Specific behaviors condoned during col
lege years are deemed unacceptable else
where. For instance, the thought of a nine
o'clock class in college is abhorrent. Jobs
start by nine. My first high school class was
at 7:50 a.m. Only we college students are
allowed to indulge in such widespread sloth.
Where else but college is your weekend
longer than your week? In high school,
drinking was a "Mom and Dad are gone,
watch out for cops" affair. A Stanford fresh
man can drink on his very first day on cam
pus without any sizeable fear of authoritari
an consequence.
Old alumni sit around and talk about the
wild things they did in college. High school
kids watch "Animal House" and think
about the wild things they might do: road
trips, dances, football games, parties, binges,
purges, whole weeks without class. They are
all part of the college experience that every
one knows. Society allows us indulgences
unknown to any other demographic group.
These decadent freedoms are, however,
unimportant compared to the intellectual
luxuries afforded us. We are provided with
free time, a pervasive social atmosphere and

an interesting, edifying wealth of informa
tion. Our job. essentially, is to learn. We
study whatever we choose and follow what
paths we will. And what better time is there
for all of this freedom than our college
years? We are in our physical prime. We
enjoy an intellectual readiness, an environ
mental paradise and in many cases, eco
nomic dependence.
The problem is that it all ends. One day
we must leave and enter a world of compe
tition. responsibility and financial stress.
It seems to me that there are three ways
in which we college students deal with the
thought of one day having to leave. The first
is outright denial a la John Belushi. The sec
ond is pre-professionalism and the third is
the ground that lies between.
John Belushi's character in "Animal
House" was kicked out of Faber College lor
having a ().() grade point average during his
seventh year as an undergraduate. That
probably does not happen at Stanford, but
the underlying mentality is very real. The
potential for indulgence in pleasures of the
flesh while at college is enough to blind peo
ple for years. A student may graduate in

only four years and still suffer from this
mindset if his behavior and habits have been
such as to just get him by. Without finding
inspiration in any classes or disciplines, a
college student may satisfy requirements for
graduation but do so only incidentally, lor
his only real interest lies in the next social
event. Graduation is thus a rude awakening
from habits and customs that are, to most of
the world, unacceptable.
The opposite of this mindset is pre-pro
fessionalism. A shocking number of fresh
men arrive at Stanford knowing exactly
what they want to do with their lives. This
can be a great blessing, for nothing is better
than having dreams and ambitions.
What's troublesome, however, is the
potential for fear of the future to dictate
what one does with his youth. 1 mourn any
young life that engages in a college lifestyle
guided by the desire to make money, it' that
lifestyle does not bring contentment and
happiness to the student. The notion of
someone studying a subject just because he
thinks it will land him a job is horrible and
calls to mind a miserable executive slaving
through middle age in a truly unhappy lite.

What's left is all that lies between. Few"oT
us probably view ourselves as fitting cleanly
into the preceding catagories. The task is
deeiding where we fall and where we would
like to fall. The magnetic poles of youthful
indulgence and adult accountability yank us
back and forth and wreak havoc on our lives
and priorities. The lucky ones are stimulat
ed and directed in their studies and ambi
tions. Happiness, for them, is aligned with
the demands of the world. The unlucky ones
acannot imagine a future after college, or
imagine it without zest. The end will come.
The rest of us simply go about our business,
enjoying ourselves and occasionally experi
encing nervous attacks.
Come what may after college, we must
enjoy these years of allocated youth with all
our might. If all goes well, each successive
year of our lives will be better than the last,
and the passing of youth will go unmourned.
Hut if these are to be the best, let's not for
get to make them uood.

Matthew Hlunwnstein, a junior majoring in
psychology, has little idea what to do with
his life.
