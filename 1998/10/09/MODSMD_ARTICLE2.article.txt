Students filled Room 2 of Lane History
Corner yesterday afternoon for the History
Department-sponsored teach-in, "The
Prospect of Impeachment: Law. Politics. His
tory," The panel of professors discussed how
unlikely it is in their opinion tha' ' resident
Clinton will be removed from of fit'
Three professors — History Profs. Jack
Rakove and Barton Bernstein and Political
Science Prof. Douglas Rivers — presented the
ories on the possibility of President Clinton's
impeachment and the situation's ramifications,
drawing from historical precedents in English
government, the Watergate scandal and the
Constitutional Convention of 1787.
History Prof. Lou Roberts, director of his
tory undergraduate studies and moderator of
the panel, said the purpose of the panel was
"not to give current events more sensationalist
coverage, but rather to give the long view" of
the situation.
Each professor was given 10 minutes in
which to state his argument, followed by a dis
cussion session.
Rakove began by presenting the historical

origins of the key phrase delineating grounds
for impeachment in the Constitution, "high
crimes and misdemeanors."
Although some analysts base their argu
ments for impeachment on the original intent
of the Constitution framers, Rakove said that
the framers added the phrase as an after
thought in the waning days of the Constitu
tional convention. They did not debate the
issue at all. he said.
Considering usage of impeachment pro
ceedings in both American and English histo
ry, Rakove speculated how the prospective
partisan arguments will fare in the current de
bate.
Because grounds lor impeachment were
not clearly defined by the framers of the con
stitution, and because "the framers couldn't
have imagined [the current situation],"
Rakove said the Democrats would probably
have a stronger historical case than the Repub
licans.
"Impeachment requires not just a misdeed
in office, but ;t misdeed of office," Rakove said,
alluding to a historical definition of impeach
able offences as "crimes against the state."
