Students filled Room 2 of Lane History
Corner yesterday afternoon for the History
Department-sponsored teach-in, "The
Prospect of Impeachment: Law. Politics. His
tory," The panel of professors discussed how
unlikely it is in their opinion tha' ' resident
Clinton will be removed from of fit'
Three professors — History Profs. Jack
Rakove and Barton Bernstein and Political
Science Prof. Douglas Rivers — presented the
ories on the possibility of President Clinton's
impeachment and the situation's ramifications,
drawing from historical precedents in English
government, the Watergate scandal and the
Constitutional Convention of 1787.
History Prof. Lou Roberts, director of his
tory undergraduate studies and moderator of
the panel, said the purpose of the panel was
"not to give current events more sensationalist
coverage, but rather to give the long view" of
the situation.
Each professor was given 10 minutes in
which to state his argument, followed by a dis
cussion session.
Rakove began by presenting the historical

origins of the key phrase delineating grounds
for impeachment in the Constitution, "high
crimes and misdemeanors."
Although some analysts base their argu
ments for impeachment on the original intent
of the Constitution framers, Rakove said that
the framers added the phrase as an after
thought in the waning days of the Constitu
tional convention. They did not debate the
issue at all. he said.
Considering usage of impeachment pro
ceedings in both American and English histo
ry, Rakove speculated how the prospective
partisan arguments will fare in the current de
bate.
Because grounds lor impeachment were
not clearly defined by the framers of the con
stitution, and because "the framers couldn't
have imagined [the current situation],"
Rakove said the Democrats would probably
have a stronger historical case than the Repub
licans.
"Impeachment requires not just a misdeed
in office, but ;t misdeed of office," Rakove said,
alluding to a historical definition of impeach
able offences as "crimes against the state."
Rivers focused largely on a com
parison of the Nixon Watergate
scandal and modern issues. Rivers
spoke about Clinton's high popular
ity rating despite the scandal, com
pared to Nixon's, which plummeted
sharply during the Watergate inves
' tigation.
"Conventional wisdom," Rivers
said, "says that the public is not as
; connected with this scandal as much
; as Watergate." He said that people
* view this scandal as a partisan dis
• pute.
Rivers said this claim is not really
• supported, and that the debate over
• impeachment is split along partisan
. lines just as much now as in Nixon's
era. In both cases the public believed
I in the president's guilt, but the per
! centage in favor of impeachment
* was much higher for Nixon.
* Although some analysts think the
effect will be larger, because more
incensed Republicans and fewer
passively defensive Democrats will
turn out to the polls, Rivers said the
scandal would not have an effect on
midterm congressional elections, cit

ing the fact that "the incumbent
party always loses seats in midterm
elections."
Bernstein looked toward the ar

guments that each party would use in
the debate and possible outcomes.
Each party "is going to use the ar
guments that get them the conclu

sions they want for partisan purpos
es," he said, 'if you look at the

sinews of argument, you're not
going to get what people believe."
Without the "smoking gun" evi
dence of taped conversations and
the stained dress, Bernstein said this

Impeachment requires not
just a misdeed in office,
but a misdeed of office.'
—Prof. Jack Rakove

would be a "he said, she said" case,
and that the White House would
make this into "part of the extended
bimbo watch."
Still, Bernstein cautioned the au
dience in closing. "While it's incum
bent upon us to have tentative be
liefs, they should be tentative and
not firm convictions," he said.
Students afterwards questioned

the professors on the prospects of in
dicting a sitting president without
impeachment, alternatives to im
peachment such as censure, and how
the next presidential election would
be affected if Clinton were to resign
or be convicted and removed from
office.
"It doesn't really change my
opinion," said sophomore history
major Bryan Hughes about the
panel. "I think we need to do what's
right in the current context."
"[The panel) demonstrated the
difficulty in trying to bring about im
peachment when you have an ill-de
fined act of wrong-doing," said se
nior history major Atiba Pertilla.
This was the fourth teach-in
sponsored by the History depart
ment since January. According to
Roberts and senior Sarah Cameron,
history undergraduate activities as
sistant, who helped organize the
event, the department will continue
to hold teach-ins once or twice per
quarter.
