## Water polo ready for conference showdowns Head coach Dettamanti needs one win for 500th career victory on the Farm 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
The Stanford men's water polo team will look to im
prove its 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation sea
son record this weekend when the squad takes on de
fending NCAA champion Pepperdine and UC-lrvine
in Southern California.
"This is a really important weekend," said junior
Brian Heifferon. "They're two league games and two
really important games."
For the Cardinal (8-1, 2-0 MPSF), every match is
critical. Only two teams from the MPSF will receive
berths at the NCAA tournament — the team that wins
the MPSF tournament and the team with the best
record.
"This is our toughest league weekend," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "We play everybody [in our
league] once. You don't get a second chance and if you
have the best record, you're seeded first in the league
championships. That seeding is critical because you
have to have the best record in the nation or win the
league championships and to make it to nationals."
This weekend's games are back-to-back, with the
Cardinal playing Irvine tomorrow and Pepperdine
Sunday.
Stanford has already defeated Irvine (4-4, 0-2)
once this year, during the Southern California Tour
nament. In that meeting, the Cardinal outscored
Irvine 13-7 as junior Jonathan Skaalen led the team in
scoring with four points, half of which came off of a
two-point shot.

Senior Layne Beaubien contributed three goals, se
nior Arturo Rodelo and junior Sean Joy each added
two points and Heifferon and senior David Hay
notched one apiece.
Irvine was led by star hole-set Ryan Bailey, who
scored four for his team. Bailey, at 6-foot-6 and 240
pounds, is the biggest offensive threat to the Cardinal.
"We really have to do a lot to stop Bailey," Detta
manti said. "We have to run a complete collapse on
[him] and that opens up their outside shooting."

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (8-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) vs. No. 6UC-Irvine (4-4,0-0), 11 a.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 4 Pepperdine (3-4, 1-2), 11
a.m.

But the Cardinal defense has been playing well this
season. Strong defensive hole play and the drop from
the outside have helped Stanford deny many of its op
ponents scoring opportunities at two meters.
Leading the defensive effort is senior goalie Chris
Aguilera, who notched 11 saves in the last game be
tween Stanford and Irvine.
The Stanford squad has not yet faced Pepperdine
(3-4, 1-2) this season. The last meeting between the
two resulted in a 9-8 Pepperdine victory.
"Pepperdine is a really scrappy team." said sopho
more Pasi Dutton. "They always seem to have good re
sults."
However, the defending champion Waves have al

ready lost to UCLA this season. And Stanford was
able to scout the competition during the SoCal tourna
ment.
"They're not as tough as they were last year," Det
tamanti said. "But they're very dangerous in their own
pool, as is Irvine."
Because the top teams in the nation are all in the
MPSF, Stanford cannot afford to relax for any game.
Each of the eight league games will be a battle in the
conference.

"Everybody has tough games every single week
end," Dettamanti said. "We have to win both of these
games."
Playing back-to-back away games is always diffi
cult. but the Stanford team is ready for the challenge.
"We just have to play hard and get through it,"
Heifferon said.
Saturday's game against Irvine begins at 11 a.m. at
Heritage Park. Sunday's match against Pepperdine is
in Malibu at 1 p.m.
