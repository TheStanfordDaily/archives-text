# Card ready for national champs
## Soccer faces UCLA, Sac St. 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
A three-game winning streak, a
tournament championship, and its
confidence growing by the game.
A team couldn't ask for a better
way to enter a match against the
defending national champions.
The No. 8 Stanford men's soc
cer team (7-2) begins its confer
ence season tonight against the
No. 2 UCLA Bruins (7-1). The
Cardinal's weekend continues
Sunday in a second Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation match
against Sacramento State (0-6-1).
Last Sunday, the Cardinal won
the Stanford / Nike Classic.
With an impressive 2-0 upset
victory over then-No. 9 Creighton,
Stanford is building momentum
going into the battle with the Bru
ins.
"The Creighton victory came at
a really good time," said senior for
ward Adam Siegman. "It was a vic
tory that we can build upon. We
are ready to win a big game."

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Tonight' No. 14 Stanford (7-2,0-0
Mountan Pacific Sports Federation)
vs. No. 2 UCLA (7-1-0, 0-0), 7:30
p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Arizona (0-
6-1,0-0), 4 p.m.

And though the victory over
Creighton was big, a victory over
UCLA would be huge.
The Bruins are currently
ranked second in the nation and
boast a tradition of strong soccer
squads. Under head coach Sigi
Schmid, in his 19th season, the
Bruins have won three national ti
tles, have earned 15 straight post
season appearances, and are riding
a 23-game regular season home
winning streak.
The Cardinal, however, is all
too familiar with this streak. In last
year's MPSF title game, the Bruins
defeated Stanford, which was play
ing a man short most of the game

due to a red card ejection, 1-0, on a
penalty kick.
This victory gave the Bruins the
No. 1 MPSF playoff seed, and
UCLA went on to win the national
title.
But the Cardinal's attitude en
tering this year's game is very dif
ferent than last year.
"Last year's game gave us the
belief that we are capable of com
peting at that level. It makes us
confident," said senior midfielder
Simon Elliott, last weekend's tour
nament MVP.
Senior captain A.J. Sauer elab
orated on Elliott's sentiments.
"In the past we went down [to
UCLA] looking for a good game,"
Sauer said. "But this year we real
ly think we can win."
While the members of the team
have confidence in their abilities,
opponents are also beginning to
take notice.
"At some points last year, we

snuck up on teams. Now we aren't
surprising anyone," said redshirt
sophomore goalie Adam Zapala.
"But we know we are a good team
and we should win games. We now
feel we should beat UCLA, not
hope to."

'We now feel we should
beat UCLA, not hope to.'

But this year's UCLA squad is
as talented as any. In a game earli
er this season, the Bruins had nine
members of the U.S. National
team (Under-23 and Under-20
combined) on the field at one time.
It is this talent that has led them to
tally 27 goals while only allowing
two.
This ratio demonstrates the
strong defense that UCLA com
bines with its potent offense. Lead
ing the Bruin's offense is senior

forward Seth George, who leads
the squad with eight goals and 20
points.
Ready to silence the Bruins' of
fensive firepower is Stanford's de
fense. which has allowed only four
goals all season.
Zapala has been a fixture in
front of the net and sports a .45
goals-against average and seven
shutouts
Senior defender Jamie Clark
anchors the defense for the Cardi
nal, and freshman Lee Morrison
has stepped into his defensive role
flawlessly, with a particularly im
pressive tournament last weekend.
However, one of keys to victory
thus far for Stanford has been the
midfield play, particularly that of
Elliott and fellow senior Shan
Gaw.
"Shan and Simon are im
mense," said Stanford head coach
