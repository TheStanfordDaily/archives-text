at the site of November's NCAA
championship meet.

MEN S CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford at the
Jayhawk Pre-NCAA Meet,
Lawrence, Kan.

And despite the fact that at least
five of the top 10 teams in the nation
will also compete in tomorrow's 8
a.m. Jayhawk Pre-NCAA meet,
coach Vin Lananna insists that win
ning the meet is one of the last things
on his mind.
"Our No. 1 priority is to assess
the fitness of our men, and our next
concern is to check out the national
course and our potential competi
tion," said Lananna.
"Winning the meet is a low priori
ty for us, although it still is a priority."
A blockbuster field including the

likes of third-ranked Colorado, No.
4 North Carolina State,' No* 5 Ari
zona and No. 10 Oregon is expected
to attend. Despite the absence of
No. 2 Arkansas, who toured the
course in the Sept. 12 Jayhawk Invi
tational. there is perhaps no better
opportunity for Lananna to submit
his troops to a trial by fire.
Leading the Cardinal contingent
in their first competition of the sea
son are seniors Brad and Brent
Hauser. who finished sixth and sev
enth, respectively, at last year's Pre-
NCAA meet in Furman, N.C.
"The Hausers are very fit and
ready to run. though they are not as
race-sharp as they were at this time
last year." said Lananna. "But that is
by design."
Joining the Hausers will be se
niors Jason Balkman. Chris Lund
strom and Jonathan Weldon. junior
Jake Maas, sophomore Thomas
Murley and redshirt freshmen Gabe
Jennings and Jamey Gifford.
Of that group, only the Hausers
and Balkman competed on last
year's Pre-NCAA meet squad
which captured first place with a low
43 points.
Jennings is fresh off a victory in
last Saturday's Stanford Invitational
and Weldon was the individual
champion in Sept. 19th's Fresno In
vitational.
Murley will also compete for the
first time this season. He has been

sidelined to this point by a knee injury.
Perpetually students of the sport,
the Cardinal harriers will study the
course, seeking to gain any advan
tage which could give them the
upper hand in the national meet.
"In addition to getting some
quality mid-season competition, we
want to use this meet to determine a
strategy we can use in Nov. [23's na
tional race]," said Lananna.
Developing such a strategy may
be difficult, since the Pre-NCAA
course tours only eight kilometers of

the Rim Rock farm, while the nation
al meet course distance will be ex
tended to a full 10 kilometers of trail.
Last year, however, Lananna
proved that such a thing could be
done. The Stanford Machine al
lowed the Arkansas harriers to rush
to an early lead in the NCAA meet,
only to chase them down in the sec
ond half of the race in accordance
with a predetermined strategy. This
strategy was crafted in part from the
Cardinal's experience at the Pre-
NCAA meet.
