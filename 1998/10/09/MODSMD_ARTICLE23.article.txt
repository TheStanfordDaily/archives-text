After being handed a defeat on
its home course at the hands of
Brighani Young last weekend, the
Stanford women's cross country
team looks to roll at Rim Rock
Farm, the site of this weekends
NCAA Pre-National Invitational
hosted by the University of Kansas.

WOMEN'S CROSS COUN
TRY
â–  Tomorrow: No. 3 Stanford at the
Jayhawk Fre-NCAA Meet,
Lawrence. Kan.

The 1998 Bob Timmons Invita
tional Cross County Meet, better
known as the NCAA Pre-National
Invitational, will likely be the first
time this season that Cardinal head
coach Vin Lananna and assistant
coach Beth Alford-Sullivan run a
full squad of available runners.
Their failure to do so in the pre
vious weeks may have resulted in
the women's recent drop in the
rankings. In Monday's poll, the

women were ranked third in the na
tion, a drop from their previous No.
2 place.
Yet, Lananna and Sullivan are
not concerned with this aspect of
the season.
"The polls are here to help pro
mote the sport and to give an indi
cation of how teams are running at
that present time," Lananna said.
"The only poll that really makes
any difference and the only thing
that we really pay attention to in
any rankings is the rankings that
they post at the end of the race."
"A drop in the spot doesn't have
an effect on what we have for our
plans," Sullivan added.
The Cardinal has more impor
tant things to worry about this Sat
urday at 9 a.m. than a number on a
piece of paper. Not only is the 35-
team women's field packed with
nine of the top 30 teams in the na
tion, but the course at Rim Rock
Farm is also the site of the NCAA
championships in November.
Coach Sullivan has a mission
