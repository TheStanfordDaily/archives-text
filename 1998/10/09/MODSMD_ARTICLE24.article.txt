# Turek toots 'Star Spangled' horn

### Jennifer Chien Contributing writer 
Ben Turek has been playing his
trumpet since fourth grade. He has
taken trumpet lessons. He has
played in church choirs, symphonic
orchestras, and marching bands.
He has even performed at wed
dings. Where, you might ask, has all
of this training led?
To playing "The Star-Spangled
Banner" at Stanford's home foot
ball games. Solo.
Turek, a junior majoring in
Physics, is the "sexion" leader of
the Band's trumpet section. As tra
dition dictates, before each home
game the trumpet section leader
plays the first half of the National
Anthem alone. The entire band
joins in for the second half.
Turek's first experience was at
the Stanford - North Carolina

game two weeks ago. He admits to
having found the event a little
nerve-wracking.
"The fact that there are so many
people there is bewildering,"
Turek said.
With typical fears such as mak
ing a mistake running through his
mind, Turek said he had to close his
eyes in order not to be over
whelmed by the crowd. It turned
out better than he expected.
"You close your eyes, and then
you don't realize the cameras on
you, you don't realize how many
thousands of people are watching
you," Turek said.
Luckily for Turek. he has had a
little practice playing the trumpet
in unusual circumstances. In order
to prepare him for his new role, the
Band had Turek practice his trum
pet playing in front of the band to
test his composure.

He successfully endured having
his pants pulled off, being smeared
with shaving cream, as well as other
distractions, without stopping his
playing once.
In addition, Turek provided the
echo at last year's Big Game. Once
or twice a year, a second trumpet
player in the press box plays the
second half of the solo.
" The hardest time was at the
echo, at Big Game. Right before it,
I got butterflies and weak knees.
But it turned out okay," said Turek.
Turek began playing the trum
pet at an early age. He cites the in
fluence of his mother, who also
played the trumpet, as the reason
that he has stuck with it for so many
years.
Turek took lessons all through
high school, focusing on classical
music.
Besides playing in the Band and

the orchestra, Turek also played in
the church choir, at weddings, and
at other functions.
"The weddings paid well,"
Turek added.
Turek's playing can even be
found on the new Mendicants CD
in the instrumental number.
Turek joined the Band as an en
ergetic freshman, and is still very
enthusiastic about his experience.
In fact, he enjoys being in the Band
so much that he felt like he should
do something in return.
"Being section leader is like giv
ing back," said Turek.
Turek's future plans include ob
taining a doctorate in physics. And,
of course, playing his trumpet solo
at the rest of the home games this
year.
He, along with an echo, will be
playing at Homecoming this Satur
day.
