# Khalidi talks on Israeli-Palestini crisis
## 
### Marty Beard 
The Israel-Palestine crisis can
only be resolved through the ac
knowledgment of their history of
conflict, a noted scholar on the Mid
dle East said on campus last night.
Dr. Rashid Khalidi, who directs
the Center for International Studies
at the University of Chicago and
serves as president of the American
Committee on Jerusalem, said all
parties involved have been inhibit
ing the peace process. Khalidi ad
vised the Palestinian delegation at
the Madrid and Washington Arab-
Israeli negotiations from October
1991 to June 1993.
"We basically feel that the Pales
tinian side of the story is very rarely
heard in the U.S. media and at Stan
ford. This was a chance to introduce
this point of view," said Nabeel
Ibrahim, president of the Organiza
tion of Arab-American Students in
Stanford, which brought Khalidi

here.
In his lecture, Khalidi denounced
the Clinton administration's efforts
at peace in the Middle East as inef
fective, sidestepping the disputed is
sues.
"It is not enough to say that all is
well. The flaws in the process, as I
see it, are that in the negotiations be
tween Israel and Palestine, the hard
issues have not been addressed. I
mean settlements. I mean borders. I
mean Jerusalem. I mean sovereign
ty," Khalidi said.
Khalidi suggested that the Pales
tinian Liberation Organization was
the only entity to benefit from the
Oslo Accords, and that Benjamin
Netanyahu has American politicians
on his side.
"The U.S. must make the deci
sion that peace is crucial," he said.
" The President is a politician, not a
statesman. The U.S. is a superpower,
a 9(K)-pound gorilla that can shake
the [Middle East] if it really tries."

Khalidi cited South Africa and
Ireland as examples of nations that
have confronted their historical dif
ferences rather than ignoring them
to gain peace.

'If they... created a
constitution and stopped
internal corruption, they
could take their fate into
their own hands.'
—Dr. Rashid Khalidi

Audience members expressed
concern that the Palestinians are not
taking positive action. Kassem Gho
rayeb, a research scientist in petrole
um engineering who is affiliated
with the Islamic Society of Stanford
University, said he believed that for
Palestinians, a better chance at au
tonomy lies in establishing another
uprising, or Intifada, similar to that

in 1992.
"You can't just establish an intifa
da," Khalidi said. "It has to be a pop
ular, spontaneous uprising. Tens of
thousands of Palestinians were will
ing to get shot. It shook Israel."
Khalidi proposes a different
means through which the Palestini- ;
ans might strengthen themselves. "If
they built up their society, created a
constitution and stopped internal «.
corruption [in the local Palestinian <
government], they could take their •
fate into their own hands."
Shira Robinson, a doctoral stu
dent in Middle Eastern studies, .
asked Khalidi if he believed the two ;
peoples could solve their problems *
through the formation of a single •
secular democratic state.
"The way things are going now,
this will not be a solution," Khalidi
said, noting that the primary obsta
cle is that factions in both countries >
have extremely strong nationalist >,
agendas.
