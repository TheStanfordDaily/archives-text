It is a tale of two coaches.
On the south side of the Bay, it is
the best of times for Stanford
women's volleyball coach Don
Shaw.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (11-2,6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. California
(3-11, 0-6), 7 p.m. Radio: KZSU
(90.1 FM).

Shaw is only a week removed
from his 2(X)th Pacific 10 Confer
ence victory, and will ride the mo
mentum of a 10-game winning
streak into Maples Pavilion on Fri
day night, when the two-time de
fending national champion Cardinal
(11-2,6-0 Pac-10) face the California
Golden Bears (3-11,0-6).
Just across the Bay, the Cal pro
gram stands as a polar opposite to
the Stanford dynasty.
Bear head coach Sue Woodstra
announced her resignation before
last weekend's matches, after three
unproductive seasons at the helm.
Reports from Berkeley suggested
that the Cal players were not having
fun under Woodstra, and that her
resignation was the product of play
er pressure.
That pressure has now shifted to
interim coach Lee Maes, who will
look for his first win tonight on the
Farm.
Under normal circumstances,
tonight's match would appear to be
an easy win for Stanford.
This week for the Cardinal, how
ever, has been anything but normal.
Stanford junior outside hitters
Kerri Walsh and Jaimi Gregory

were injured and unable to play in
Tuesday's match against Sacramen
to State, and their absence was
clearly felt on the court.
The Cardinal looked totally out
of sync in the first game against the
Hornets, and dropped the opening
frame, 15-13. Fortunately, the young
Stanford squad was able to rally and
rebound for a four-game victory, 13-
15,15-6,15-9,15-4.
Walsh underwent a minor proce
dure on her right shoulder on Tues
day morning to loosen the back por
tion of her right shoulder, so Shaw
decided to rest his two-time All
American.
"When Kerri had surgery over
the summer, they tightened the liga
ments in her shoulder," said team
doctor Elaine Lambert. "Since that
surgery, an area in the back of her
shoulder has not loosened properly.
So she had a small manipulation
under anesthesia, to essentially
stretch those ligaments in her poste
rior capsule and speed up her recov
ery."
In the interest of a full recovery,
Walsh will also be sidelined for
tonight's match.
Gregory was diagnosed with a
mild knee sprain after a fluke acci
dent in practice, and decided to rest
during Tuesday's non-conference
match.
Her status is day-to-day, and the
decision has not yet been made as to
whether the back-row leader will be
on the floor tonight against Cal.
Regardless, the young Stanford
team that did compete against
Sacramento State showed signs of
improvement throughout the match
and showcased the depth that has

players who will have to step up for the injured Kerri Walsh and
