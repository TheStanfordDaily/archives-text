WOMEN'S SOCCER
■Tonight: No. 9 Stanford (6-2-2,0-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) vs. Ari
zona State (4-6,0-0), 7 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Arizona (3-
4-1,0-0), 1 p.m.

Although Stanford faces two un
ranked competitors, the Cardinal
realizes the importance of the Pac
-10 games after last season's disap
pointing results. Although the Car
dinal was the Pac-10 champion dur
ing the 1996-97 season, last year
they failed to attain an NCAA tour
nament berth for the first time in
ten years. During the 1997-98 sea
son, Stanford needed to win its final
eight games in order to qualify for
the NCAA tournament. A 2-2 tie
with Arizona State ended any
chances of continuing post-season
play.
"Last year's game against Ari
zona State is an extremely motivat
ing factor," said sophomore goal
keeper Carly Smolak. "We were on
the bubble and we tied. When it
comes down to it every little thing
counts. When we tied, we knew that
we had ruined our chances."
The Sun Devils will face a famil

iar Cardinal lineup: Stanford re
turns eight of 11 starters.
"We are a tight team and it helps
that we have been playing together
for so long," Smolak said.
In contrast, Arizona State, a
young team, relies on the scoring of
two freshmen. These freshmen
proved pivotal in the Sun Devil's
(4-6-0) upset win over Utah last
week.
Smolak and defenders Natalie
Kim and Jennifer O'Sullivan, will
attempt to shut down the Arizona
State scoring duo of Stacy Tullock
and Kristina Dawson. Tullock is
second among Pac-10 teams in
scoring with 19 points. The forward
has posted back-to-back game-win
ning goals for the Sun Devils. Daw
son is tied for second on the Ari
zona State roster in both goals and
points.
In addition to returning eight
starters, the Cardinal receive addi
tional help from experienced play
ers returning to the field after limit
ed playing time due to injury during
the 1997 season. Senior midfielder
Christy Stoffel points out the con
tributions of these players.
"Although returning eight
starters is great, having Christy
Arnold, Kelly Adamson and Natal
ie Kim back has also made a huge
impact," Stoffel said.
The Cardinal has also been
helped by its depth from the bench.
"The freshman have made a re
ally big impact. Those coming off
the bench have not the level of play
drop at all," said Stoffel.
