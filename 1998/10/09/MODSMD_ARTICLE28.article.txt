# Card hopes for turnaround
## 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
The Stanford football team en
ters Saturday's contest against
Oregon State at something of a
crossroads.
Fresh off thrashings at the hands
of Oregon and Notre Dame and
mired in a two-game losing streak,
the Cardinal needs a win to have
any chance at a howl berth.
"I think there's still some things
we can get accomplished this sea
son," head coach Tyrone Willing
ham said. "The Rose Howl is prob
ably out the window. But win a few
games, get into the bowl picture ...
those things are possible."
In order to even consider such
lofty goals. Stanford will have to
start with a convincing win over the
hapless Beavers (3-2,0-2 Pacific 10
Conference), who have not won a
Pac-10 game since a 26-12 victory
against the Cardinal in 19%.
Stanford has not lost to the
Beavers at home since 1968. com*
piling a 11-0-1 record over that
span.
"I expect a game with two teams
lighting for a win." said Beaver
head coach Mike Riley. "Stanford
has played a very tough schedule
and has had two very tough road
games back-to-back with Oregon
and Notre Dame.
"They are going to be playing at
home and 1 am sure it is a situation
where they are looking to regroup
and start their season over again."
he said.
"By beating North Carolina
they have shown they are obvious
ly very capable of winning. We
must be prepared to play our best
game of the year."
T he Beavers have had unusual

success running the ball this year,
most of it coming at the surprising
hands of sophomore Ken Simon
ton.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford (1-4. 0-2 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. Oregon State
(3-2.0-2). 2 p.m. Radio: KTCT (1050
AM), KZSU (90.3 FM).

Simonton was expected to serve
as the second-string tailback this
season, but has risen to the top of
the depth chart and earned 86.6
rushing yards per game, good for
fifth in the Pac-10.
His 5.91 yards per punt return is
also good for sixth in the confer
ence. The fact that Simonton can
often rack up easy yards out of the
option poses an added problem to
the beleaguered Stanford defense.
"They do enough [of the option |
to keep us busy." Willingham said.
"The option makes things diffi
cult."
Besides the steady production
out of the tailback position, OSIJ
poses a threat when the ball stays in
junior quarterback Terrance
Bryant's hands. Bryant's 1K8 yards
of total offense per game ranks him
sixth in the Pac-10, and he has
thrown 140 consecutive passes
without an interception.
"I think Terrance has done a
very remarkable job in the fact he
has the least amount of time at his
school of any Pac-10 quarter
back." Riley said of the transfer
from Homestead-City College of
San Francisco. "1 think he is con
scientious and wants to do right
and that is one reason he is not
throwing interceptions. He is
probably a little too careful with
some balls because he is not giving

the receivers a chance with some
throws, hut overall he is doing a
great job."
Coming off disastrous efforts
against Oregon and Notre Dame (a
combined 1,136 yards allowed) the
Stanford defense must pull itself
together to keep a struggling of
fense in the game.
Most of the Cardinal's 17 points
in South Bend came in garbage
time, and when the defense allows
63 points as it did against Oregon
the week before, garbage time is all
the time.
"We've got to play a lot better
total defense." Willingham said.
Fortunately, Stanford has the
weapons in place to win a shootout.
Senior flanker Troy Walters is ex
pected to start for the first time
since injuring his ankle against Ari
zona on Sept. 12.
Walters joined the offense for
two plays against Notre Dame, but
was pulled when the game was out
of reach.
"1 don't have any pain." Walters
said. "I feel good."
Junior Todd Husak is also en
joying a solid season, and is on pace
to become just the third quarter
back in school history to pass for
over 3,000 yards in a season.
He would join John Elway and
Steve Stenstrom. who accom
plished the feat in 1982 and 1993,
respectively. Though he was re
placed in the fourth quarter at
Notre Dame, Husak still managed
to rack up 226 yards passing on 41
attempts and 25 completions for
one touchdown.
That said. Willingham is not
content with the offense's perfor
mance.
"I don't think there's an area we
don't need to improve on."
