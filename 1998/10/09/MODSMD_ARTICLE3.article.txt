Stanford students have the opportunity to
be part of a critical mass that could reshape the
United States' relations with a murderous
regime in Sudan, said Michael Horowitz, a
prominent activist on religious persecution is
sues.
"It could be the experience of a lifetime to
sense your own power â€” if you're interested,"
said Horowitz.
Horowitz, who is the director of the Hudson
Institute's Projects for Civil Justice Reform
and International Religious Liberty, spoke
yesterday as a guest of Stanford in Govern
ment to a gathering of 20 students.
He concentrated part of his talk on a recent
effort to bring legislation before the Senate
that would allow the government to impose on
Sudan the same kind of sanctions that existed
to fight apartheid in South Africa. There will be
a two-day conference in Washington beginning

on Nov. 7 to lobby the Senate to pass the bill,
known as the Freedom from Religious Perse
cution Act.
"The most evil, blood-stained regime today
is in the Sudan," said Horowitz. "They have
murdered more than a million Christians, they
buy Christian children to sell as slaves, and as
we speak, over 2 million residents of that coun
try, largely Christian, are being deliberately
starved."
According to Horowitz, the bill before the
Senate provides for a fact-finding commission
that will identify human rights violations and
religious persecution. The President would
then have a choice of which sanctions to im
pose, or he could choose to ignore sanctions al
together. "But he'd be held accountable, be
cause the findings of the commission can't be
just swept under the table," Horowitz said.
