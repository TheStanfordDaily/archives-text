# Horowitz denounces religious persecution

### Deanne Corbett 
Stanford students have the opportunity to
be part of a critical mass that could reshape the
United States' relations with a murderous
regime in Sudan, said Michael Horowitz, a
prominent activist on religious persecution is
sues.
"It could be the experience of a lifetime to
sense your own power — if you're interested,"
said Horowitz.
Horowitz, who is the director of the Hudson
Institute's Projects for Civil Justice Reform
and International Religious Liberty, spoke
yesterday as a guest of Stanford in Govern
ment to a gathering of 20 students.
He concentrated part of his talk on a recent
effort to bring legislation before the Senate
that would allow the government to impose on
Sudan the same kind of sanctions that existed
to fight apartheid in South Africa. There will be
a two-day conference in Washington beginning

on Nov. 7 to lobby the Senate to pass the bill,
known as the Freedom from Religious Perse
cution Act.
"The most evil, blood-stained regime today
is in the Sudan," said Horowitz. "They have
murdered more than a million Christians, they
buy Christian children to sell as slaves, and as
we speak, over 2 million residents of that coun
try, largely Christian, are being deliberately
starved."
According to Horowitz, the bill before the
Senate provides for a fact-finding commission
that will identify human rights violations and
religious persecution. The President would
then have a choice of which sanctions to im
pose, or he could choose to ignore sanctions al
together. "But he'd be held accountable, be
cause the findings of the commission can't be
just swept under the table," Horowitz said.
Actions to raise awareness about the situa-
tion in Sudan are only one part of
Horowitz' commitment to lighting
religious intolerance. He spearhead
ed a loosely formed coalition to
serve as a voice for Christians who
suffer in silence all over the world.
Horowitz, however, is not a
Christian — he's Jewish. 1 le became
involved in these issues "by acci
dent." he says. It began when a
Christian friend of his who had nar
rowly escaped persecution in
Ethiopia was denied asylum in the
United States.
To Horowitz, the most shocking
thing about the persecution of
Christians is the lack of outrage, and
the silence — even on the part of

( hristians themselves.
"This campaign became some
thing else for me as a Jew — an ef
fort to understand why there was
such indifference and hostility
against a massive class of victims,"
he said.
Horowitz explains the silence on

Indifference and hostility
against a massive class
of victims'
— Michael Horowitz

Christian persecution as the result
of a stereotyped definition of Chris
tianity.
"There's a tendency in the facul
ty lounges, newsrooms and Con
gress offices to define (Tiristianity in

terms of the sins that have been
committed in its name," Horowitz
said.
While he doesn't deny that those
sins have been many, he is con
vinced of the positive role of the
Judeo-Christian heritage in this
country.
"1 got beat up by kids who told
me I 'd killed their Christ. But for the
Christian foundation in this country,
I'd be a lampshade or a bar of soap
today," said Horowitz in reference
to America's role in saving Jews
from the Holocaust.
Michael New, a doctoral candi
date in political science and member
of Stanford in Government, was
pleased with the turn-out for
Horowitz' talk.
"We hope to send some people to
the conference on Sudan," he said.
