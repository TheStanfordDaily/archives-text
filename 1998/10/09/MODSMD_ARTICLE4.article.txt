# Gaieties cast hopefuls nearly double
## 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
Although last year's show lacked
rave reviews, the tryouts for this
year's Big Game Gaieties, the stu
dent-written musical and long
standing Stanford tradition, attract
ed staggering numbers of prospec
tive cast members — nearly twice as
many as the 1997 production.
"Last year, 60 people showed up
for auditions," said Steven
Aronowitz, a junior and the show's
producer. "This year, we had 102.
We called back 58."
This morning the staff an
nounced its cast of 35 early this
morning with roll-outs and a cele
bration in front of Memorial Audi
torium.
Many of those who auditioned
came from the freshman class,
which showed especially strong in
terest in the production.'

And the Gaieties staff did work
to draw them in.
"Once you get a rejection from
an a cappella audition, come try out
for Gaieties. We'll take you," ca
joled enthusiastic Gaieties staffers
last week in White Pla/a.
The promising script will put the
presumably talented group to work
for the next five weeks in prepara
tion for the show.
"I've heard stories that it's the
most raucous show of the year, and
that's something 1 want to be a part
of," said Meaghan Working, a fresh
man Gaieties hopeful.
This year's cast plans for their
musical to be a satisfying answer to
the less-than-lukewarm reception
of last year's "The Usual Gaieties."
"Gaieties % was the best show
I've been in, and last year was an un
fortunate departure," said Cody
Harris, a junior two-year veteran of
Gaieties who returns this year as as
sistant producer. "They missed the
point sort of. It was creative, but not
the right approach. I think the show
this year is primo."
"The script is very much in the
vein of Gaieties 96," said
Aronowitz. "This year is back to the
traditional form of Gaieties — part
rally, part student-written musical
and tons of insanity."
Some of the assets of this year's
Gaieties include a well-written
script, an experienced technical
staff and a huge pool of potential
cast members.
Producers cite many changes in
the script's style. " This year, it's pro-
Stanford," Harris said. "We
thought that was a good idea."
Others agree about the quality of
the show. "I've read six lines of it so
far. and it seems really funny," said

Alex Jasso, a senior who audi
tioned.
Harris emphasized the musical's
brevity, tailored to the attention
spans of Branner freshmen heady
with excitement about their first Big
Game.
"When the choice between long
and not funny, and short and funny
came up, we chose short and
funny," he said.
The Gaieties student coordina
tors are also enthused about the mu
sical's technical support.
" The design staff is really good,"
said Technical Director Kathy
Steel, a junior. 'Technically, it's
going to be a tough show to do be
cause we can't move our sets into
Mem Aud until four days before the
show."
The probable success of Gaieties
has been several months in the mak
ing.
"The writers have been working
since last Spring Break, and it's real
ly exciting to see the characters
come to life," Aronowitz said.
