# Gaieties cast hopefuls nearly double
## 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
Although last year's show lacked
rave reviews, the tryouts for this
year's Big Game Gaieties, the stu
dent-written musical and long
standing Stanford tradition, attract
ed staggering numbers of prospec
tive cast members â€” nearly twice as
many as the 1997 production.
"Last year, 60 people showed up
for auditions," said Steven
Aronowitz, a junior and the show's
producer. "This year, we had 102.
We called back 58."
This morning the staff an
nounced its cast of 35 early this
morning with roll-outs and a cele
bration in front of Memorial Audi
torium.
Many of those who auditioned
came from the freshman class,
which showed especially strong in
terest in the production.'

And the Gaieties staff did work
to draw them in.
"Once you get a rejection from
an a cappella audition, come try out
for Gaieties. We'll take you," ca
joled enthusiastic Gaieties staffers
last week in White Pla/a.
The promising script will put the
presumably talented group to work
for the next five weeks in prepara
tion for the show.
"I've heard stories that it's the
most raucous show of the year, and
that's something 1 want to be a part
of," said Meaghan Working, a fresh
man Gaieties hopeful.
This year's cast plans for their
musical to be a satisfying answer to
the less-than-lukewarm reception
of last year's "The Usual Gaieties."
"Gaieties % was the best show
I've been in, and last year was an un
fortunate departure," said Cody
