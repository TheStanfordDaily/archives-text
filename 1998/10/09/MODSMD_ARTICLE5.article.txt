### Ryan kalember Contributing writer 
The NAACP has formed a chapter on
the Stanford campus. The long-standing
civil rights organization's new chapter is
getting off the ground with an initial
membership between 40 and 50.
A combination of student and outside
efforts led to the organization's incep
tion. According to President Mark
Sanders, a junior majoring in public poli
cy. the mid-Peninsula chapter of the
NAACP. led by president Janet Wells,
was instrumental in starting the group.
"It was really a joint effort," Sanders
said. "Stanford students, other NAACP
members and people in the black com
munity were interested in having a chap
ter here."
The Stanford chapter of the National

Association for the Advancement of Col
ored People has a full schedule planned
for its inaugural year. The first activities
include a newsletter designed to inform
voters about issues in the upcoming Nov.
6 election, a membership drive and coop
erative events with other organizations.
The newsletter will be created in con
junction with the Palo Alto League of
Women Voters, and a voter registration
drive will be conducted with the aid of the
Stanford Democrats.
The drive will occur throughout the
area, including local high schools and
East Palo Alto. The effort will target mi
nority voters, especially those from disad
vantaged backgrounds.
"We want to deal with both communi
ty issues and issues that affect the
African-American and other minority
communities nationwide," Sanders said.

The chapter is also attempting to
schedule prominent speakers, notably
Kweisi Mt'ume, NAACP president and
former congressman.
"We want to continue in the NAACP
tradition ot' advocating civil rights,"
Sanders said.
Campus conservatives responded with
mixed feelings.
"We don't condemn the NAACP, hut
we don't see the need for ii on the Stan
ford campus," said Stanford College Re
publicans Co-chair Ryan Parks. "I lowev
er. it's great that they're registering peo
ple to vote."
The group has had two meetings this
year that were primarily organizational.
Meetings will be held Wednesdays il s
p.m.
Interested individuals can contact
