## 
### Leo Feler 
Vegans, vegetarians and those just looking for tree
food lined up during lunchtime in White Plaza to sam
ple vegan euisine served by Vegan Action and Stan
ford University Dining Services.
The recently-formed vegan organization served
300 "veggie burgers," <S0 bean burritos, 400 Health
Valley Granola Bars, 150 Cliff Bars, 25 pounds of Fan
tastic Foods humus. 15 pounds of Whole Foods Tahi
ni Veggie Mix, chocolate and plain soy milk, "Rice
Dream" frozen desserts, fruit drinks and 350 large
cookies — chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, ginger, and
peanut butter.
Dining Services was on hand to serve samples of its
vegan cuisine, including southwestern pozole and
spicy coleslaw.
Most of Vegan Action's food was donated bv local
health food companies.
Vegan Action "hardly spent any money at all," said
Melissa Janiak. a senior and Vegan Action co-presi
dent.
Since veganism requires abstaining from any ani
mal meat or products such as dairy, eggs or honey, all
foods were made only from plants and plant deriva
tives.
"We wanted to increase awareness of veganism,
and to show people that vegan food tastes great," said
the other Vegan Action co-presidcnt Jeff Skopek, a
sophomore.
"I challenge anyone to cite a human characteristic

that warrants moral regard, whose
logical extension does not encom
pass all animals," he said. "If there
is none, as I believe, the oppressive
hierarchy that we have created be
tween ourselves and animals is an
injustice ... There are none who
need our help as desperately as
those who can not help them
selves."
The incentive to organize this
lunch in the plaza also came from
the success of a similar event held
by UC-Berkeley Vegan Action.
Skopek said Stanford and Berkeley
were attempting to create vegan
unity amongst California universi
ties.

Approximately 2,000 people at
tended the event to sample some of
the interesting foods.
From non-beef "beef" jerky
made of soy beans to the more tra
ditional vegan burgers made pri
marily from soy and spices, most of
those who sampled the treats en
joyed them.
"It tastes very good," said Paddy
Clarke, an anesthesiologist at Stan
ford Hospital.
Some students were just there
for "free food," said biology mas
ter's student Sarna Renfro.
"This is okay," said Thomas
Hauge, as he took a bite from his
vegan burger. "It's not tasty."
As a visiting scholar from Nor
way working on his master's thesis
in mechanical engineering, Hauge
said that "normally we eat whales."

For him, tasting soy burgers and
cookies made without butter, eggs,
refined sugar or milk was a new
venture.
Clarke, while licking his lips
from the vegan burger he had just
eaten, said in response, "I would
never consider veganism. It's too
much of a hassle. I enjoy meat, and
we are designed to be omnivores."
Others disagreed.
"I think it is great that they're
doing this." said Tiffany Stevens, a
University employee. Stevens is
vegan "60 to 70 percent of the time.
I can't quite give up ice cream." she
said between smiles and bites of her
burger.
The organization was "incredi
bly happy with the turnout and how
receptive the people were." Skopek
added.
