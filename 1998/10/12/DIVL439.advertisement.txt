does? Fun, right? Not necessarily.
Sexual harassment? Possibly. It's a
confusing and controversial topic.
Think of sexual harassment as a
form of communication that can
be perceived in different ways:
one by the communicator, another
by the recipient, and yet another
by an "objective" third party.
What Is It?
Sexual harassment takes several
forms:
■ Unwelcome or coercive sexual
advances in exchange for favor
able treatment, or under the
threat of unfavorable treatment
(e.g., grades; jobs; promotions)
■ Sexually-related behaviors that
create a hostile academic,
living, or work environment
and interfere with someone's
academic or work performance
(e.g., unwanted sexual com
ments, jokes, e-mails and pub
licly posted sexual graphics)
■ Persistent and unwanted com
munications of a sexual nature
(e.g., in person, by phone or e
mail, or insistent pursuit after a
break-up)
■ It can involve repeated
actions, or one incident if
sufficiently severe; can occur
between peers, in hierar
chical relationships, or
between persons of the same
or opposite gender; can be
subtle or blatant
II If sexual touching is involved
it can also be sexual assault
Why Its Important
Sexual harassment can:
■ Create fear and intimidation
■ Be an abuse of power or an
attempt to control someone else
The term "sexual harassment"
wasn't commonly used when
this picture was taken at
Stanford around 1903.
■ Lead to tension and conflict
in a community
■ Deprive others of the
opportunities they came to
Stanford to enjoy - to study,
work, and live in a sup
portive environment
Sexual harassment violates
university policy and can bring
about legal and university
disciplinary sanctions.
How To Stop It
■ Don't put up with it (there's
no reason to blame yourself -
it's not your fault)
ll Speak up (silence enables
harassment to continue toward
you or someone else; keep
notes and records, including e
mails)
■ Tell the person to stop,
verbally or in writing (be firm
and clear - they'll often back
off), or give them this flyer
■ If you are uncomfortable
dealing with it by yourself, ask
a trusted person in authority
to assist you (e.g., residential
staff, staff or faculty)
The University has resources
available to discuss your options.
They include confidential coun
seling with a counselor at CAPS,
campus clergy, or the University
Ombudsperson. Residence Deans
and other Sexual Harassment
Advisors can also help (see
Resources below)
Important Tips
■ Avoid misunderstandings:
when communicating about
sexual matters your values
and style may be different
from others' (what's accept
able to one may not be to
another), so when in doubt,
check it out
■ When someone says "stop" or
expresses uneasiness, respect
their limits (ask yourself if you
would want your sister or
brother to be addressed this
way)
■ When a relationship is break
ing up, formerly endearing
behaviors can become offen
sive, so if your "ex" expresses
discomfort, back off, and talk
your feelings through with a
neutral party
■ There are extra risks if you
become involved sexually
with someone who is in an
inherently unequal position
(e.g., teacher/student; dorm
resident/staff) - consent may
be misunderstood, and later,
breaking up can have major
consequences
