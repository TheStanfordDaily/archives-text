The Advisory Board Company
& Corporate Executive Board
The Advisory Board Company and Corporate Executive Board are (for-profit)
think tanks serving over 1,700 of the nations most prestigious hospitals and health
systems and 1,200 of the world's largest progressive corporations. Gathering data
across and beyond the membership, the companies publish 60 major studies and
45,000 customized research briefs each year on progressive management practices.
Students in liberal arts programs are strongly encouraged to apply. Qualities that
assist in a career with us—and for which we probe in our interviews —include
intellectual curiosity, analytical acuity, superior communication ability and a track
record of leadership, in school or beyond. Our intention, and largely our
accomplishment, is the promotion of individuals at an astonishing pace —as often
and as quickly as merit allows.
