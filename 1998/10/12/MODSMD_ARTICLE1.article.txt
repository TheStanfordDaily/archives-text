Launching his organization's first campaign that tar
gets the United States as a human rights violator, Pierre
Sane, secretary-general of Amnesty International,
spoke at Kresge Auditorium last evening.
In his 50-minute lecture, Sane claimed the U.S. gov
ernment is increasingly denying prisoners their basic
freedoms, engaging in inhumane restraint procedures
and incarcerating racial and class minorities dispropor
tionately.
Sane's lecture to a crowd of about 250 was his second
in the Bay Area during Amnesty's 12-month "Rights for
All" campaign that will bring him to Los Angeles, Chica
go and Washington, D.C. during a two-week trip.
Sane claimed the United States suffers from a "war
mentality" that leads to crimes against its citizens. "In
this war, the enemies are dehumanized. The enemies are
stripped of their rights," he said.
Amnesty's campaign began with a letter to Attorney
General Janet Reno in which it demanded an end to
shackling female inmates who are pregnant or in labor
and for a ban on electric shock belts. The belts — which
discharge thousands of volts — are often used to inca
pacitate and punish those charged with crimes, accord
ing to Sane.
Sane also said the United States'jails its asylum-seek
ers with convicted criminals and denies them access to
counsel and fair hearings.
He also asked the United States to ratify the Conven
tion on the Rights of the Child and the Convention of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women. The United
States and Somalia are the only two countries that have
not signed the child rights pact. Sane said.
The new campaign adds the United States to the list
of nations targeted by Amnesty reports. The list includes
China, Sudan and Indonesia.
Despite Sane's admission that alleged wrongdoings
listed in Amnesty's new report have been going on for
years in the United States, he said that the end of the
Cold War prompted the organization to begin a cam
paign against the United States.
