## U.S. presses for resolution in Kosovo 
### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — U.S. bombers moved into
position for possible NATO
airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S.
envoy accelerated talks with Presi
dent Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday
after reporting no change in the
leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
Richard Holbrooke and Milose
vic held discussions late into the
night Sunday, meeting for the sixth
time in seven days in talks that sig
naled U.S. determination to search
for a peaceful way out of the dead
lock.
Holbrooke said early Sunday
that he would "continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable,
fully verifiable compliance system
as an alternative to the other
choice" — meaning the use of
force.
But he also said NATO would
meet Monday to authorize action if
his mediation effort fails.
In Washington, national security
adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic "is not in compliance
as of this point."
"He can come into compliance
or he can face military action by

NA TO" at any time, Berger said.
The Americans and Europeans
are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28
against the separatist Kosovo I iher
ation Army.
The major obstacle appears to be
Holbrooke's demand that Milosevic
agree to an expanded international
monitoring mission to verify com
pliance with demands of the IJ.N.
Security Council.
Those demands include an
immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal
of special troops in the province,
allowing refugees to return home
and beginning talks with ethnic
Albanians on Kosovo's future.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About L >() percent ol its 2 million
people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or
substantial self-rule.
Meanwhile, journalists heard
sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from
about six houses in the ethnic Alba
nian village of Makrmalj. about 20
miles west of Pristina.
Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed

the activity was part of a Serb police
operation.
Police prevented the journalists
from getting closer than about a
half-mile from the village.
The Pentagon is continuing mili
tary preparations should Hol
brooke's mission fail. Six U.S. B-52
bombers arrived in Britain on Sun
day and a contingent of A-10 anti
tank planes tlew from Germany to
Italy.
On Sunday, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., warned that Americans
might be killed in the bombing
raids. "There will be significant
jeopardy there because the Serbians
have a very good defense system,"
the former Navy pilot said on "Fox
News Sunday."
The Romanian government has
agreed to allow NATO to use its
airspace in "emergency and unpre
dictable situations" if the alliance
launches strikes against Yugoslavia.
The positioning of more U.S.
planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly
designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force com
pliance with IJ.N. demands.

After a late-night session with
Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday
"nothing has changed" in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke
called the situation "very serious"
and said he was looking for "peace
ful, acceptable" alternative to the
use of force.
A statement from Milosevic's
office, issued after the talks and dis
tributed by the government's Tan
jug news agency, said all U.N. con
ditions have been met for a political
settlement.
But Milosevic seemed to be sep
arating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
Serb sources, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on a monitor
ing force. A source close to Milose
vic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
The United Nations has con
demned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed
airstrikes. The Clinton administra
tion, however, believes it does not
need a new U.N. resolution for the
attacks.
