# Clinton and congressional leaders unable to reach budget agreement

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”Presi-
dent Clinton called for a budget
"that is worthy of bur children"
Sunday, as White House and con
gressional bargainers sought a truce
for their spending battle that would
let lawmakers go home to campaign
for re-election.
Budget negotiators met yet again
at the Capitol to sort through scores
of disputes over money and policy,
even as top Republicans went on
television living to define the fight.
They sought to portray a president

who has been distracted by scandal
and by repeated fund-raising trips,
and who has rejected GOP propos
als for tax breaks and vouchers
aimed at students.
"Now. all of a sudden, he shows
up. Where has he been all year?"
asked House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, on ABC's "This
Week with Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts."
In an office just paces from
where Sunday tourists strolled
through the Capitol's august Rotun

da. White House chief of staff Ersk
ine Bowles and an administration
team bargained with House Speak
er Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott. R-
Miss.. and other congressional lead
ers.
Nearly two weeks after the gov
ernment's new fiscal year began,
eight of the 13 annual spending
measures remain incomplete. A
stopgap measure keeping the gov
ernment operating expires Monday
night.

Neither side is willing to let the
dispute escalate into a federal shut
down that could hurt incumbents'
re-election bids, and ( 'linton said he
would sign another short-term bill
to keep agencies at work.
"We're not going to shut the
government down it we're working
on this, of course," he told reporters
at the White House. "No one is
interested in doing that."
The eight unfinished spending
bills for 1999 are together worth
about $6(M) billion, more than one

third of the total federal budget.
Clinton wants about $3 billion
more for programs he favors,
including more than $1 billion for
helping school districts hire 1(K),(KK)
more teachers and more funding for
Russia and other former Soviet
states, toxic waste cleanups and
food safety efforts.
Republicans have signaled that
they are willing to provide about $2
billion, but want some of the money
spent for programs they prefer, such
as education funds that states could

dispense as they please.
But Clinton stuck to his insis
tence for more education spending,
a theme that has tested well in
Democratic polls for years.
"It's time once again for
Congress to cross party lines and
send me an education budget ...
that is worthy of our children and
their future." he said.
The two sides have, however,
agreed to spend about $200 million
to upgrade security at the Capitol
buildin
