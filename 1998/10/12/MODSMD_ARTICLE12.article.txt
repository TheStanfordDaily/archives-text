Sleeping out may have
been inconvenient, but
it was fun while it lasted

SO YOU WANT to catch a glimpse of
our illustrious men's basketball team
in action? Get in line. Hut don't
expect hours of dedicated queuing to reap
tickets.
Hundreds of undergraduates had been
camping out for over a week to snag the
1,200 available Sixth Man Club and gener
al student season tickets. It seemed the
Cardinal finally had some frenzied fans.
Stanford sports history had reached a high
point.
As squatters huddled together under
soggy blankets in the chill, marveling at
the fact that here we had a little pocket of
real-world sports fanaticism, they willingly
accepted the perplexing code of conduct
created by the Director of Marketing and
Operations, Jamie Zaninovich. Adhering
to "the Rules," they agreed to pre-register
their groups and learned they would be
tagged with non-removable wristbands.
Never mind that the tickets themselves
would then cost up to $55 per student. This
was history.
Throughout the week, Zaninovich
repeatedly emphasized that every effort
was being made to ensure equal ticket
opportunities for every fan. It was evident,
however, that if this were the case, ticket
sales would have gone the way of the hous
ing Draw and sign-ups lor Fiction Writing
60 — a cold, faceless process of a lottery.
In this way, the Rules represented the
antithesis of everything Stanford. And we
were glad.
The Department of Athletics had creat
ed a fan-screening process made on behalf
of the Cardinal. Democracy was out. Sur

vival of the fittest was in. The student
bleachers would be filled only with the
most avid, the most raucous, and the most
insane basketball fans.
And then, at 7 p.m. last night, the Ath
letics Department reneged. Apparently
too many people jumped in line and too
many people clung to tatters of hope
despite being too far at the end of the line.
The Athletics Department decided to give
tickets to 75 percent of the people in each
registered group.
Hut the decision is not truly fair. Now
that entire dorms and fraternities have
spent a week deciding sleep-out rotations
and organizing the delivery of supplies,
there will no doubt be plenty of arguments
once the lottery results are announced.
Ultimately, only 75 percent of the people
who were represented in the line will get
tickets, no matter how long they pitched
their tents.
Clearly, the decision was made too late
into the process to benefit everyone who
wanted tickets. Those who waited for
weeks have now been made equivalent to
those who pitched tents just in time to reg
ister. It was an anticlimactic end to an
event that could have sparked the momen
tum of the season.
The policy change should instead have
been made in advance for next season, so
that the situation could have played itself
out. The Athletics Department made the
abrupt change, and students can finally go
back to being students. Hut we have to
admit that sleeping out was actually kind
of fun.
There are plenty of positions on campus
for which we all qualify simply because we
can sign our names. This pre-game compe
tition represented another side of Stanford
life.
No, not everyone will get into the club.
Hut at least, thanks to those who tried, we
all caught the fever.
