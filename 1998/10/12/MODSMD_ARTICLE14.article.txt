## As American as Raisin Bran 
### 
I'VE GOT THIS
Pavlovian response to
eating my morning
cereal: reading anything I
can get my hands on.
Preferably it's the newspa
per, but phone messages
on Post-Its or the nutri-

tional label on the side of the box will suf
fice when the only news in the paper is a
fiasco I'm so tired of hearing about that I'm
not even going to give it the decency of
being named.
This morning, I was excited to replace
The New York Times with the "Show what
you know with this All-Americana quiz!"
on the back of the box of Raisin Bran.
The first group of questions was about
famous dogs. I named those belonging to
George Jetson and Little Orphan Annie,
two out of six. I was stumped by question
seven; it included lyrics to the most popular
song in 1944, "Mairzy doats and dozy doats
and liddle lamzy divey." 1 got one of the
four questions about colorful folk heroes
and named Snow White's seven dwarves
(but not the Bobbsey Twins or the Little
Women). I had some problems matching
Rubik's Cube, pet rocks, telephone booth
stuffing and 3-D movies with their respec
tive years of popularity, but it was the
"Americanisms" that kicked my butt.
I perused the list of words, yearning des
perately for some sort of connection. What
the hell was a curtain climber? A foozler?
House moss? Or a grinder? Since mv citi

zenship isn't currently at risk. I'll admit it. I
did worse on the All-Americana quiz than
my first midterm in E40.1 felt pretty pathet
ic. What kind of an American was I?
So I called my mom, directed her to the
top dresser drawer still filled with field-day
ribbons and the dust of has-been prom cor
sages, and asked her to send me a cassette
tape, my only evidence of being a true red
blooded American.
This particular cassette came to mind
because 1 believe every kid across the Unit
ed States should have the experience of
being in a really bad garage rock band. And
I mean bad. Loud and bad. No string quar
tets or Jimi Hendrix riffs. Only groups in
which a majority of the members were con
vinced to take up their instruments after the
idea of the band was formulated.
We recorded the tape when I was in
ninth grade, in an effort to solicit gigs we
never ended up playing. The band experi
ence began when Suzanna, the lost lamb my
church youth leader kept trying to befriend
over Cokes, invited me to sit in with her and
the Huiras twins.
We spent Sunday afternoons practicing
in the Huiras' basement. Our studio was
complete with metal-rock-magazine wallpa
per: band photographs of Def Leppard, Poi
son, Nelson and Spinal Tap. Jessica and
Joyce's parents also proudly displayed an
impressive beer can collection which 1
feared would collapse every time wc hit the
downbeat of the Ramones' "Blitzkrieg
Bop."

I can't remember much about the music
we played. We worked on a few tunes
Su/.anna had written, but our best number
was a cover of L7's "Pretend We're Dead."
It was still pretty awful. In some cases, poor
musicianship might be forgiven if the group
maintains some sort of hardcore feminazi
riot-grrrl teenage angst. Some sort of
intense, struggle-filled message. Alas, I
wouldn't even have known if we did effuse
something like that. I never actually heard
the lyrics Suzanna sang because I was play
ing so loud.
Most of my life, the American in me has
been about a shared relationship with trivia
liks the stuff on the back of my cereal box:
quotes from Star Wars, watching fireworks
and driving big cars. But I want it to he
more like the raw and real, humiliating and
inspiring something that surrounds a few
skinny girls with braces and ponytails as
they beat, strum and pluck some value into
a couple hundred dollars worth of crappy
equipment. I want my Americanism to be
more about the chance to try new things
and risk making a candid fool out of myself.
I want it to be about mountain climbers and
star dreamers. And also about humility and
fabulous failures. So long as I remain under
the watchful gaze of Slash from Guns 'N'
Roses, things will end up all right.

Rachel Hutton, a senior majoring in prod
uct design, has never actually listened to the
cassette tape of her former garage hand. It's
sort of her own "Ode to a Grecian Urn."
