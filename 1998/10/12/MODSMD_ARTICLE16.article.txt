Grapes issue is dead
As a California grape worker who
opposes the United Farm Workers boy
cott of our industry, I believe that now is
the time for Stanford to totally drop the
issue.
Universities such as Harvard and Yale
serve grapes again because students want
the dining halls to carry products based on
demand, quality, price and availability.
Students also realize that actual farm
workers do not support the boycott
because it threatens our jobs and the busi
nesses of farmers.
According to the Stanford Daily article,
there seems to be a desire by Stanford to
institutionalize an issue that was dead a
long time ago. The UFW does not actively
promote the boycott anymore and has not
organized the over 50,000 table grape
workers for several years. In fact, the
UFW has only one contract covering
roughly 3(X) workers, which represents less
than 1 percent of the industry's total work
force.
Over the years, the UFW has targeted
other industries including eggs, citrus.

apples, mushrooms, roses, wine grapes,
strawberries, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce
and rappini. Why should Stanford stu
dents support a boycott that the UFW
does not even care about anymore and
that actual farm workers do not support?
My hope is that Stanford will stop try
ing to promote the boycott every year and
allow students to discuss which issues are
important to them. If voting does occur, I
suggest that every residence hall take a
balanced look at the issue and really
examine why farm workers do not support
the boycott.

Selling our moral integrity
This is in response to last Tuesday's
article on the legacy of the grape protests.
Specifically, this is in response to Provost
Rice's statement that "Stanford should not
be in the business of championing any
moral / political cause just because one
group wants it." Having spent four years
as an undergraduate at Stanford, I have

seen that Stanford views itself as a busi
ness that is also an educational institution.
When Stanford is a business institution,
it must cater to certain goals that exclude
certain sets of cultures, ideas, and values.
This also means to take certain moral and
political causes to the garbage. Yet, as an
educational institution, Stanford is a place
where genuinely interested teachers make
an effort to do exactly the opposite —
expose the students to the many varied
thoughts of many varied thinkers, whose
thoughts do include morals and politics.
Provost Rice's remark comes from the
perspective of trying to create a university
that provides certain goods to its students;
a reputation, remarkable resources and
dynamic opportunity. From a "great aver
age," every student can be served to some
degree of satisfaction. Yet, when a blind
eye is taken to certain moral and political
values in favor of material provisions, this
attitude is reflected by the people who
wield no power. Thus, when Stanford
administrators choose not to vote on
grapes, it sets an example for the students.
A similar idea was presented by Ted
Koppel at the Class of 1998 graduation
speech in which he provoked the question

of whether it was all right for everyone to
ignore the principles of one man in favor
of the well-being of the "great average."
Should we turn our heads to the moral
aetivity of government officials so long as
interest rates are low and the stock market
takes orbit?
Likewise, should a place as affluent and
influential as Stanford turn a blind eye to
the moral plight of the under-represented
while endowments pour in? Should Stan
ford include ideas such as dignity and jus
tice in its body of learning, or should it
trade these for financial growth? There
are two answers; one that follows a heart
less logic, and one that follows a compas
sionate mind.

seem to believe that the tuition they pay

As for me. I do not blame Stanford

Clinton's legacy will last
after this scandal ends
Media are carrying many polling reports
and discussions regarding the support
African Americans are extending to Presi

dent ( linton. As an African American. I
offer my own rationale, which is solely
mine. To repeat, it is mine and I do not
speak for others.
The rationale is predicated on partisan
ship. as is the leadership of the House of
Representatives and its Judicial Commit
tee. In summary, in my view. President
Clinton is an embodiment of the Demo
cratic Party in these investigations, and I
tend to support that party.
This is not to suggest that the Demo
cratic Party is all that it should be for me as
an African American. Given the sinister
stance
of the Republican Party on socio-economic
issues important to me. and the improbabil
ity of a third party being successful, sup
porting the Democratic Party is the only
practical, electoral position for me to take.
As an alumnus of the ( ivil Rights move
ment. I recall the Dixiecrats who bolted
from the Party because of advances of
African American in the Party's infrastruc
ture. Among the donkeys who bolted the
Democratic Party were the likes of Strom
Thurmond and Jesse Helms who remain
active in the Senate.
More importantly is the party to which
these donkeys bolted — and were warmly
received, if not recruited. These donkeys
are now the principal breed of the Republi
can Party. To borrow from an adage, when
this bolting occurred, the average 10 of
both political parties increased in quantum
numbers.
There is measured meanness in the pro
file of the Republican Party on issues that
pertain to the African American communi
ty. in my opinion. And, among some of the
staunch right-wingers in that party, there is
a certain rabidity that would even challenge
the sympathy of the ASPCA.

What is important, again, to me is not
President Clinton, hul the party that is in
control of congressional committees. Long
after President Clinton is gone, irrespective
of when or how he leaves, the African
American community will he affected for
generations by decisions made by his nom
inations and confirmations for federal
judgeships.
Personally. I take no comfort in the
smugness and pcrniciousness of Orriti
Hatch, who chairs the Senate's Judiciary
Committee. Nor shall I forget the incivility
of two of his colleagues on that committee
during the tragic confirmation of Clarence
Thomas: former Senator Alan Simpson
and Arlen Specter, both Republicans.
And in the I louse, also under the major
ity Republican Party, it is shameful how the
House's committee has stripped the Dis
trict of Columbia of its political essence.
Holding up the District's own internally
generated funds, exploiting it as a battle
ground for educational vouchers, death
penalty initiatives, etc.. is mean.
All of these committee actions were
taken under the struggles of the former
Mayor. Marion Barry, when even the
genius of Alan Greenspan could not have
saved the District under the abusive actions
of the Republican-led 104 th and l()sth
Congresses.
A final illustration of the Republican
Party's congressional pernicious stances is
its opposition to federal census-taking tech
niques that would yield a more accurate
account of African Americans. Reduced to
simple terms, the Republican Party is say
ing
to African Americans: "You don't count!"
That may be true, but I can vote, and
that vote will will count on Nov. 3. And. to
make the point. President Clinton will not

even he on the ballot.

Staying dry — and loving it
I would like to give my full support to
John Davi in his endeavors as a non-drinker
and as a writer lor the Daily.
A non-drinker myself. I have often strug
gled with the decision to consume alcoholic
beverages, especially in such settings as "fra
ternity" parties. My the way. John, it is not
just you; I also get the feeling that there are
A WHOLE I () I of people at those parties.
Where was I? ()h. yes. the drinking. So one
day I caved in and had a couple of "brews."
Believe me. it is not fun to have your head in
a wastebasket all night as you pray to God
that your testicles do not come shooting out
of your mouth with that day's chili.
Of course the only way to get other peo
ple like us to slay true to their bodies and
souls is to inform them that they are not
alone. The Daily is the pet lect medium, and
Davi is the ideal spokesman. I lis informal,
stream of-consciousness style of writing is
not only refreshing in this day of stale, orga
nized arguments, but it is also efficient. The
use of Joyce-like train of thought allows the
readers to truly get into Davi's mind, where
they can also get a taste of his opinions on
"fraternity" parties and Diet Coke and
SLE. Oh. man. I am with you on that too,
brother.
Rather than ramble on more, I will sim

Grapes issue is dead
As a California grape worker who
opposes the United Farm Workers boy
cott of our industry, I believe that now is
the time for Stanford to totally drop the
issue.
Universities such as Harvard and Yale
serve grapes again because students want
the dining halls to carry products based on
demand, quality, price and availability.
Students also realize that actual farm
workers do not support the boycott
because it threatens our jobs and the busi
nesses of farmers.
According to the Stanford Daily article,
there seems to be a desire by Stanford to
institutionalize an issue that was dead a
long time ago. The UFW does not actively
promote the boycott anymore and has not
organized the over 50,000 table grape
workers for several years. In fact, the
UFW has only one contract covering
roughly 3(X) workers, which represents less
than 1 percent of the industry's total work
force.
Over the years, the UFW has targeted
other industries including eggs, citrus.

apples, mushrooms, roses, wine grapes,
strawberries, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce
and rappini. Why should Stanford stu
dents support a boycott that the UFW
does not even care about anymore and
that actual farm workers do not support?
My hope is that Stanford will stop try
ing to promote the boycott every year and
allow students to discuss which issues are
important to them. If voting does occur, I
suggest that every residence hall take a
balanced look at the issue and really
examine why farm workers do not support
the boycott.

Selling our moral integrity
This is in response to last Tuesday's
article on the legacy of the grape protests.
Specifically, this is in response to Provost
Rice's statement that "Stanford should not
be in the business of championing any
moral / political cause just because one
group wants it." Having spent four years
as an undergraduate at Stanford, I have

seen that Stanford views itself as a busi
ness that is also an educational institution.
When Stanford is a business institution,
it must cater to certain goals that exclude
certain sets of cultures, ideas, and values.
This also means to take certain moral and
political causes to the garbage. Yet, as an
educational institution, Stanford is a place
where genuinely interested teachers make
an effort to do exactly the opposite —
expose the students to the many varied
thoughts of many varied thinkers, whose
thoughts do include morals and politics.
Provost Rice's remark comes from the
perspective of trying to create a university
that provides certain goods to its students;
a reputation, remarkable resources and
dynamic opportunity. From a "great aver
age," every student can be served to some
degree of satisfaction. Yet, when a blind
eye is taken to certain moral and political
values in favor of material provisions, this
attitude is reflected by the people who
wield no power. Thus, when Stanford
administrators choose not to vote on
grapes, it sets an example for the students.
A similar idea was presented by Ted
Koppel at the Class of 1998 graduation
speech in which he provoked the question

of whether it was all right for everyone to
ignore the principles of one man in favor
of the well-being of the "great average."
Should we turn our heads to the moral
aetivity of government officials so long as
interest rates are low and the stock market
takes orbit?
Likewise, should a place as affluent and
influential as Stanford turn a blind eye to
the moral plight of the under-represented
while endowments pour in? Should Stan
ford include ideas such as dignity and jus
tice in its body of learning, or should it
trade these for financial growth? There
are two answers; one that follows a heart
less logic, and one that follows a compas
sionate mind.

ISlo excuse for personal
attacks
Complaining about the service at the
Stanford Post Office has become almost as

trite as complaining about the weather
during winter quarter. Everyone does it.
and everyone nods in agreement as others
do it, partly because justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled at the post office's
management.
I certainly find it ridiculous that lines
routinely stretch out the door because
only two counters are open at the busiest
times of the day.and I wish there were
more parcel delivery lockers so I wouldn't
have to wait for half an hour to pick up a
package when the express window is
closed. These are legitimate issues, and in
recognition of the potential for improved
service, the University has wisely looked
into other options for mail delivery after
the Post Office's lease expires.
None of this, however, justifies the per
sonal attack on Post Office employees that
Dan Geyser chose to make in the Oct. 6
Daily. The fact that he may have been try
ing to write an "amusing" column and that
he did not mention the names of the
employees whose personal habits he was
lampooning docs not excuse his crude
approach to criticizing postal service on
campus.
Unfortunately, some Stanford students
seem to believe that the tuition they pay
each quarter entitles them to a staff of sub
missive, bowing-and-scraping public ser
vants who greet each complaint with a
smile and hustle off with indefatigable
energy to do their customer's bidding.
As for me. I do not blame Stanford
postal workers for losing their customer
service enthusiasm when they are routine
ly confronted with personal criticism for
inefficiencies in the postal system that are
beyond their control. It is certainly not the
fault of the guy behind the counter when a
package doesn't make it to its destination
in fewer than the three magic days. Any
one who wants effective and friendly ser
vice from a post office employee might try
starting the conversation with a friendly
remark rather than an angry complaint.
I've found this approach to be much more
effective.

I was amazed at the number of people
who were involved in the Stanford Swing
at the Main Ouad. I believe events like
this are a major success.
I would like to suggest a new idea along
these lines. If Stanford could pay for a pro
fessional instructor and a good band to
play salsa / merengue. this 100 would be an
event that would be in people's memories
for a long time.
You might ask. why salsa? It is one of
the most popular dances in the Bay Area.

except at Stanford. Why not give it a try? I
guarantee that everyone will fall in love
with a dance filled with passion and grace.
A huge part of Latin American culture
is its music. Sure, we're only 10 percent of
the population on campus, but our music
catches the hearts of more than 90 percent
of the population exposed to it.
