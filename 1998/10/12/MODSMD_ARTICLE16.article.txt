Grapes issue is dead
As a California grape worker who
opposes the United Farm Workers boy
cott of our industry, I believe that now is
the time for Stanford to totally drop the
issue.
Universities such as Harvard and Yale
serve grapes again because students want
the dining halls to carry products based on
demand, quality, price and availability.
Students also realize that actual farm
workers do not support the boycott
because it threatens our jobs and the busi
nesses of farmers.
According to the Stanford Daily article,
there seems to be a desire by Stanford to
institutionalize an issue that was dead a
long time ago. The UFW does not actively
promote the boycott anymore and has not
organized the over 50,000 table grape
workers for several years. In fact, the
UFW has only one contract covering
roughly 3(X) workers, which represents less
than 1 percent of the industry's total work
force.
Over the years, the UFW has targeted
other industries including eggs, citrus.

apples, mushrooms, roses, wine grapes,
strawberries, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce
and rappini. Why should Stanford stu
dents support a boycott that the UFW
does not even care about anymore and
that actual farm workers do not support?
My hope is that Stanford will stop try
ing to promote the boycott every year and
allow students to discuss which issues are
important to them. If voting does occur, I
suggest that every residence hall take a
balanced look at the issue and really
examine why farm workers do not support
the boycott.

Selling our moral integrity
This is in response to last Tuesday's
article on the legacy of the grape protests.
Specifically, this is in response to Provost
Rice's statement that "Stanford should not
be in the business of championing any
moral / political cause just because one
group wants it." Having spent four years
as an undergraduate at Stanford, I have

seen that Stanford views itself as a busi
ness that is also an educational institution.
When Stanford is a business institution,
it must cater to certain goals that exclude
certain sets of cultures, ideas, and values.
This also means to take certain moral and
political causes to the garbage. Yet, as an
educational institution, Stanford is a place
where genuinely interested teachers make
an effort to do exactly the opposite â€”
expose the students to the many varied
thoughts of many varied thinkers, whose
thoughts do include morals and politics.
Provost Rice's remark comes from the
perspective of trying to create a university
that provides certain goods to its students;
a reputation, remarkable resources and
dynamic opportunity. From a "great aver
age," every student can be served to some
degree of satisfaction. Yet, when a blind
eye is taken to certain moral and political
values in favor of material provisions, this
attitude is reflected by the people who
wield no power. Thus, when Stanford
administrators choose not to vote on
grapes, it sets an example for the students.
A similar idea was presented by Ted
Koppel at the Class of 1998 graduation
speech in which he provoked the question

of whether it was all right for everyone to
ignore the principles of one man in favor
of the well-being of the "great average."
Should we turn our heads to the moral
aetivity of government officials so long as
interest rates are low and the stock market
takes orbit?
Likewise, should a place as affluent and
influential as Stanford turn a blind eye to
the moral plight of the under-represented
while endowments pour in? Should Stan
ford include ideas such as dignity and jus
tice in its body of learning, or should it
trade these for financial growth? There
are two answers; one that follows a heart
less logic, and one that follows a compas
sionate mind.

ISlo excuse for personal
attacks
Complaining about the service at the
Stanford Post Office has become almost as

trite as complaining about the weather
during winter quarter. Everyone does it.
and everyone nods in agreement as others
do it, partly because justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled at the post office's
management.
I certainly find it ridiculous that lines
routinely stretch out the door because
only two counters are open at the busiest
times of the day.and I wish there were
more parcel delivery lockers so I wouldn't
have to wait for half an hour to pick up a
package when the express window is
closed. These are legitimate issues, and in
recognition of the potential for improved
service, the University has wisely looked
into other options for mail delivery after
the Post Office's lease expires.
None of this, however, justifies the per
sonal attack on Post Office employees that
Dan Geyser chose to make in the Oct. 6
Daily. The fact that he may have been try
ing to write an "amusing" column and that
he did not mention the names of the
employees whose personal habits he was
lampooning docs not excuse his crude
approach to criticizing postal service on
campus.
