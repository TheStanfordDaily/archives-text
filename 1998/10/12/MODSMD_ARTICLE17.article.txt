# Where we are
## The 						Constitution, equity and Maples Pavilion 
### 
David Stein

Equality and fairness have
their places in society, namely in the
Constitution and Academy Award
voting, hut in the rabid hunt for Sixth Man
tickets, they are uninvited. All they're good
lor is promoting good will, and if there's
one thing this campus needs less of, it's har
mony between man and man. What we
need is more deception and cutthroat com
petition. Once upon a time, our little
Hooverville at Maples gave us that.
I say once upon a time because the Ath
letics Department decided late last night to
stick its regulatory hands into every basket
ball fan's desire to be able to scalp season
tickets for astronomical prices. Now.
instead of having to sleep your unshowered
butt on the concrete outside of Arrillaga for
a chance to see the Card play, all you need
to do is sign a piece of paper and hope your
friends don't abandon you when they hold
their own group lottery.
OK. I'm being a little overemotional.
The Athletics Department realized that
people were cutting in line, forging names
and being just all-around mean, and put an
end to Camp Maples. They also realized
that the campers at the end of the line, who
couldn't put together a tent rotation quick
ly but nonetheless seemed to he bigtime b
ball fans, should have an opportunity to
purchase tickets. Therefore, people like

myself, who enjoy sleeping with sheets,
would have a reasonable chance to go a
game. I commend their sensitivity. I really
do.
Hut why must everything be fair and
equal? Anyone who has gotten a B+ in
freshman writing while his semi-literate
roommate aces his courses knows fairness
doesn't reside on this side of El Camino.
The University doesn't need to coddle us
into believi:.g that liberty and justice for all
is somehow true; everyday life tells us oth
erwise.
That's why it was so refreshing to see ini
tiative and outright aggression dominate
the rush for tickets. In class, we're fair; in
our jobs, we're fair: in the dining halls,
we're fair (sometimes). But occasionally,
equal access robs us of exhilaration and
experience, and I feel that's what this sensi
tive change in rules has done here.
If you don't believe me, let me take you
back to last Friday night when things were
much different....
(Close your eyes.)
Junior Bobby Beaver sat at the head of
the line, bundled against the oncoming chill
of twilight, looking out over the tents and
campfires, like a madman inspecting the
hordes of some twisted cult. Beaver expect
ed to be sitting — and sleeping — in that
same spot for about another 20 hours. But

he didn't mind. He held the most enviable
position on campus.
He was first in line to buy Sixth Man
tickets for the upcoming men's basketball
season. And he wasn't moving. For any
thing. Well, almost anything.
"Everything has its price," Beaver said,
grinning. "That's what my father always
told me."
My father has also given me advice, such
as, "Work hard for what you want," but this
dictum must have been driven home more
forcefully in the Beaver household because,
upon learning that Sixth Man tickets would
be a hard find, he got in line very early,
about 288 hours before tickets went on sale.
"We're not completely insane," Beaver
assured me.
He must have been right because soon
after Beaver set up camp on Oct. 4. resi
dents of Cedro lined up right behind his
Kappa Sigma contingent, and as of Friday
night, there were some 30 tents pitched out
side Maples.
The atmosphere there was casual. Hun
gry students waited for the pizza man. while
others strummed their acoustic guitars or
studied for upcoming midterms.
Everyone seemed to be having a fine
time, but there was drama underneath the
sheen of warmth and joy.
You see, even then not everyone liked

the Rules for getting tickets. Basically, they
were a little more complicated than the tax
code. Like Congress, the process relied on
a representative system, meaning that one
person could have reserved 10 spaces dur
ing the day. while there had to have been a
five-to-one ratio at night. This, of course,
meant that people in the front of the line
were discovering friends they never even
knew about, friends willing to trade a few
hours of on-line duty (and probably a lot
else) for a spot with the early birds.
For those with seemingly guaranteed
tickets, the system worked great.
Rinconada freshman Tyrone Standing, a
future Sixth Man. was all too happy to wait
in line, even though on Thursday night the
sprinklers came on near his sleeping bag.
He did have some limits though. Unlike
one of his dormmates. he would not have
missed a week of morning classes to stand
watch.
However, as with any situation of haves
and have-nots, there were some disgruntled
with the system.
Serge Kassardjian, a freshman from
West Lagunita who seemed out of the hunt,
thought it was tragic that a true basketball
fan like himself couldn't see his favorite
team play. In place of the sleepover, he pro
posed a lottery.
"I'm mad at the world," Serge said after

he'd been in line for 24 and a half hours
with little sleep.
He was also mad at his dorm president
who, after being recently elected, jumped
ship and joined forces with Rinconada. He
won't get re-elected, but at least he'll have
tickets.
The dorm president, who will not be
named to protect his political future, said
that Rinconada ticket holders might have
been willing to sell Sixth Man memberships
for about six times their face value. Fair?
No. Exciting? Definitely.
At first, I sided with Serge. I thought a
lottery system, run through Axess, was the
way to go. But then, after seeing the energy
outside Maples — the first show of over
whelming school unity since we ran whim
pering from a handful of tal students at last
year's Big (iame — I changed my mind.
There was a feeling of community there
that all the RAs in Branner could never
hope to produce, and sometimes that's a lot
more important than, well, personal
hygiene for a week.
The original system might not have
allowed lor total fairness, but. hey, at least
it was fun, unlike the Constitution.

David Stein, a coterminal student in English,
will trade one of his column spots for a ticket
to a game. Two spots for Arizona or UCLA.
