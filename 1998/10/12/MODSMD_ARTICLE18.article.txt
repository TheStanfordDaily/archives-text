a My friend Roberto looked
JL over at me. I sputtered out a
"no." No. not afraid of blood. At least. I
didn't think si).
In the back of the ambulance, on a very
basic stretcher, an upper middle aged
woman was groaning every time the car
shifted. She clutched a dirty shopping bag
with her left hand; her right hand pressed
a blood-soaked rag against her head.
"Just a few minutes." I had warned
Roberto when 1 climbed in the used bur
gundy minivan that serves as the ambu
lance for the municipality ol Nejapa. F.I
Salvador. Roberto was going to pick up a
young man who had recently been in a car
crash who needed a daily visit to the nurse
to check on his stitched-up wound. I was
just keeping Roberto company. But upon
emergence from the main street of the
pueblo onto the highway, a number of
worried eyes and desperate index fingers
gestured to a point about 30 yards down
the road where traffic had slopped.
A mound of people stood ga/ing at
some hidden spectacle. Broken glass glit
tered sharply in the sunlight, quiet evi
dence of what we eventually realized was a
crumpled taxi blocking the thoroughfare.

Roberto pulled over the ambulance.
I he small gathering parted to reveal a
young woman steadying the elbow of an
older woman. The latter had blood
streaming down her right cheek and lore
head. matting down her graying hair and
staining her dress. A large portion of the
left side of her skull was laid bare. But she
was still lucid, clutching a cheap plastic
shopping bag.
Roberto opened the hack door of the
hand-lettered ambulance. The older
woman climbed in alone, as no one in the
crowd of spectators apparently had plans
to accompany her to the hospital. She was
out visiting her daughter, they explained.
The taxi driver was going tot) fast.
Because he had only planned to assist
in a routine check-up. Roberto had not
brought one of the emergency medical
aides who usually attended to the patients
while he drove. 1 climbed in the front with
him, he turned on the lights and sirens,
and we sped off.
The nearest hospital was located in San
Salvador, which is approximately half an
hour away when the streets are not
clogged with traffic, as were that Monday
evening.
Alter a few minutes, the woman started

groaning and talking to Jesus. I looked
back to see blood continue throbbing
down her right cheek. It originated several
inches above, in a large indentation on the
side of her skull. I felt thick-fingered, use
less. superfluous and symbolic. She
groaned again and tried to sit up. Roberto
looked over at me.
" l ienes miedo de sangre? "
No .. . no.
"Me puedes ayudar? "
Yes. Please, let me help, so I don't have
to bear witness to a death unheeded. Yes.
please let me help. Oh God. Oh God.
I took the rubber gloves he handed me
and climbed in the back of the van. I sat
next to the woman and secured her as best
I could as we bounced through the lawless,
crawling traffic of urban sprawl. Why
hadn't I renewed my first aid training? Or
at least learned to drive stick?
"Apply pressure." Roberto instructed,
and 1 pressed.
The woman looked up at me. Where
was her bag? There, she was already grab
bing it. I showed her.
"There is a very big hole in the side of
my head." she told me. "I can feel it. I can
feel the blood rushing out."
I assured her that the hole was small.

that she would be fine, that we were
almost there. In an attempt to disguise my
lie from her, every few seeonds I wiped off
the rivulets of blood pulsing out from
beneath my inexperienced fingers.
Roberto made an illegal U-turn and
pulled into the public hospital. White
coated medical practitioners scooted over.
Who is she? What is your name, senora?
Roberto rushed to accompany the sur
geons who would stitch her up. Although
this process was, almost commonplace for
him, it would not be for most people in
their first year of high school.
Roberto started working with this
ambulance service when he was IS years
old. Now. at the age of 20 (three weeks my
senior) it had become his nightly, unpaid
work.
Everyone who works at the comite <le
emergencias in Nejapa is 21 years old or
under. Each of the seven members of the
group spends at least two nights a week 011
call. Roberto, the only driver, spends
every night 011 call. The group meets, orga
nizes fundraisers and trains other young
people in first aid.
All of the emergency technicians come
from houses in the countryside where they
are still lighting to attain electricity and

potable water. They earn money for
school from the coffee harvest in Novem
ber and December. All of them either
study or work during the day, and some
also are responsible for other family mem
bers. No one on the comite de emergencias
has graduated from high school yet. The
youngest is 12 years old and in the fifth
grade. As much as he wishes he could own
a Nintendo, he probably wouldn't have
much time for it anyhow.
El Salvador is currently tied with South
Africa for having the highest homicide
rate in the world. There are more deaths
per capita from gang violence now than
there were during more than a decade of
death squads.
Youth there, as here, are often
marginalized, underestimated, unem
ployed. Indeed, the ambulance of Nejapa's
comite de emergencias has often provided
transport for young people with spines
severed by machetes, limbs blown off by
grenades. Hut these seven kids in Nejapa.
even though no one asked them to, have
taken the initiative to put pressure to stop
the flow of blood.
