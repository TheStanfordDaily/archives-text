## Turbulent weekend for water polo team Dante Dettamanti earns his 500th victory at Stanford 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
MALIBU, Calif. — When Dante Dettamanti recorded
his first victory as coach of the Stanford men's water polo
program, many of his current players had yet to be born.
This weekend, those players gave the Cardinal head coach
his s(X)th win in 22 years at Stanford.
It is Dettamanti's consistency paired with his longevity
that have made him one of the most successful water polo
coaches in NCAA history. Having spent three years at
Occidental College and three years at UC-Santa Barbara
as head coach of the water polo programs there, over the
course of his 28-year career Dettamanti has collected 596
wins overall.

I'll probably reflect on the win next week,
or maybe a year from now.'
— Dante Dettamanti

In spite of the milestone, however, the coaeh remains
focused on this year's team and this season's quest for a
national title.
"I'll probably reflect on the [s(X)th] win next week, or
maybe a year from now," said Dettamanti. "Right now,
we need to win all of our games to go to the NCAAs."
Cardinal assistant coach Ben Quittner has been with
Dettamanti for the past nine seasons, including this one.
"I enjoy coaching with Dante because we win a lot to
gether," Quittner said. "I hope one day 1 get S(X) wins
under my belt. And 1 hope he's going to get 750."
This year's Cardinal squad was also pleased to be a part
of the historic win, which came during the Pepperdine
match yesterday in Malibu.
"We just wanted to get Dante his 500 th win," said se
nior David Hay. "Our parents got him a cake and we knew
it wouldn't make the trip back up to Northern California."
"It's nice to be a part of it," added Cardinal senior Ar
turo Rodelo. "Dante is a very personable coach. He gets
along with his players. It's a coach-to-player relationship,
but it's also a person-to-person relationship."
With seven NCAA championships under his belt. Det
tamanti is now looking for his eighth. His strong, consis
tent coaching has helped make the Stanford men's water
polo program a powerhouse in the sport.
And with such a stellar coach, the winning tradition is
bound to continue.
