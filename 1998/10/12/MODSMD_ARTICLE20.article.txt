# Upset by Irvine Anteaters, Card defeats Pepperdine Waves
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
MALIBU, Calif. — Any team can have an
off day. But a good team knows how to re
cover quickly. That's just what the No. 2
Stanford men's water polo team had to do
this weekend.
After suffering an 8-2 loss to sixth-ranked
UC-Irvine on Saturday, the Cardinal
bounced back to defeat Pepperdine's fifth
ranked, defending-national-champion
squad, yesterday, 8-5.
"We were trying so hard [in Saturday's
game]," said senior Jeremiah Robison. "But
everything was just going in the opposite di
rection."
Irvine got out to a 3-0 lead in the first
quarter. Stanford's first goal of the game
didn't come until the last two minutes of the
first half, when senior Arturo Rodelo scored
a backhand from the hole. Irvine put four
goals away in the second quarter to end the
half with a 7-1 lead.
During the second half, Stanford stepped
it up on defense. The Irvine offense scored
one goal in the half, with but 1:28 left in the
third quarter.
Junior Brian Heifferon scored the only
goal of the fourth period, in the final 43 sec
onds of play.
"We just didn't have anything [on Satur
day]," said Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti. "We didn't do anything right. All
parts of our game broke down."
Stanford suffered three points-at the
hands of Irvine hole-set and national team
member Ryan Bailey. Dettamanti had his
team running a drop defense against Bailey,
but was forced to switch to a press defense in
the second half.
"We had a tough time stopping Bailey,"
Dettamanti said. "We got caught between
defenses and Irvine got some easy goals.
That really takes the wind out of your sails."
On offense, Stanford was only able to
convert one of its six man-up opportunities.
Irvine goalie Genai Kerr came up big for the
Anteaters, tallying 15 saves. The Cardinal
put away just two of its 27 shots, while Irvine
was able to score its 8 goals on just 16 shots.
The loss is likely to affect Stanford's rank

ing in the national poll, which will lower the
team's seeding in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament as well.
With just 8 league games per season,
every game is extremely important because
only two MPSF teams will receive berths in
the NCAA tournament at the end of the sea
son.
"I told the guys that this was a critical
game," Dettamanti said, describing his
pregame talk with the team before Sunday's

match. "Losing would have put us out of it."
But the Cardinal men weren't about to
accept two losses in a row. Stanford set the
pace of the game with a two-point goal from
Heifferon just 1:41 into the game.
A Cardinal breakdown in communica
tion, however, led to a Pepperdine goal at
3:31.
In the last 19 seconds of the quarter, Stan
ford junior Sean Joy scored on a break-away,
off a pass from junior Jonathan Skaalen. The
lone goal of the second quarter came on a
fast counter-attack by Heifferon who took
on Pepperdine goalie Merrill Moses one on
one.
The Anteaters came on strong in the third
period and tied things up 4-4, but Stanford
refused to back down and outscored Pepper
dine, 4-1, in the final period of play.
Sophomore Pasi Dutton scored on a shot
from the post during a Stanford 6-on-5 op
portunity.
The real turning point of the quarter
came at 3:48, when Robison made a 2-point
lob shot over Merrill's head. Robison also
scored the final goal of the game on a pass
from Heifferon to the inside post.
"Jerry's two-point lob really broke the
game open," said Stanford senior David
Hay.
"The lob shot really did it for us today,"
