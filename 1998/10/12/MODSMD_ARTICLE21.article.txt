LOS ANGELES — It could have been a Hollywood

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: No. 2 UCLA (8-1. 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated No. 8 Stanford (8-3. 1-1). 1-0.
■ Yesterday: Stanford 3. Sacramento State 0.

But Friday night's game did not have the fairy-tale
ending the No. 8 Stanford men's soccer team (8-3, 1-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) had hoped for. The
No. 2 UCLA Bruins (8-1, 1-0 MPSF) capitalized on an
early goal and took the conference opener, 1 -0, from the
Cardinal.
In doing so, the Bruins extended their regular-season
winning streak at home to 24 games.
The story truly began, however, last year in the MPSF
title game. The Cardinal was shooting for its first ever
conference championship, as well as the No. 1 playoff

seed from the MPSF. Using their home-field advantage,
however, the Bruins took the game on a penalty kick and
never looked back on their run to the national title.
Act Two was supposed to be different.
It was not so much revenge that the Cardinal was
seeking, but rather capturing what the team believed
rightfully belonged to it in the first place — a victory at
UCLA.
Friday night, Stanford felt it played well, but didn't
follow through on its plans.
"I thought we deserved maybe a little bit more out of
it. I think most people would agree with that," said Stan
ford head coach Bobby Clark. "That is now twice that we
have come down here and played quite well and gone
away empty-handed."
Riding the momentum of an upset victory and a tour
nament title, the stage was set for Stanford to capture the
attention of the college soccer world.
However, what goes down in the books as a loss for
the Cardinal was a tremendous performance that had
Stanford coming up just short.
As the teams battled from the kickoff, the game was
very evenly matched, with much of it played around the
midfield. Stanford's defense played particularly well and

shut down UCLA's national player
of-the-year candidate, senior Seth
George.
"It is always a very tough game
because Stanford is a very good
team. They don't make many mis
takes and they make it very difficult
for you to play," said UCLA head
coach Sigi Schmid.
Stanford had the game's first
scoring opportunity early in just the
10th minute of the game. Sopho
more Corey Woollolk. who fooled
the Bruin defense with his speed and
footwork throughout game, stole a

pass and dribbled past the last
UCLA defender. UCLA sopho
more goalie Niek Rimando was
caught out of position and slipped
while hack pedaling to the goal. Ri
mando. however, si ill managed to
deflect Woolfolk'sshot and keep the
game at 0-0.
"It is a big boost when your goal
keeper comes up with a save like
that," UCLA's Schmid said. "It
makes you feel like nothing is going
in today."
Rimando's incredible play con
tinued throughout the game, as he
recorded six saves in the shut out.
"lull marks to [Rimando),"
Woollolk s.iid. "I le was on full cylin
ders toniiiht. We couldn't set anv

thing hv him."
UCLA scored the game's lone
goal in the 14th minute off one in a
series of corner kicks. Sophomore
Shaun Tsakiris lifted the corner kick
into the pack in front of the goal and
sophomore Carlos Bocanegra out
leaped his defender to head the ball
past Stanford redshirt sophomore
goalie Adam Zapala.
"They were most dangerous on
set pieces," Zapala said. "Otherwise
we handled them pretty well. We
didn't really give away many oppor
tunities."
Midway through the second half,
the Bruins suffered the loss of senior
Tom Poltl due to injury, adding to
Stanford's late-game chances.

"It hurt us losing Poltl. We lost a
little bit of the midfield, so when they
stepped up that pressure they defi
nitely got a hold of the game,"
Schmid said. "Overall, I think we
were slightly better in the first half
and they were slightly better in the
second half."
This late-game momentum by
the Cardinal led to its final scoring
opportunity. Freshman standout
Lee Morrison, who played superb
defense all game, put the ball in the
back of the net. After a few seconds
of confusion on the field, however,
the goal was waved off due to a
handball ruling.
Though Stanford played well the
entire game, the team was unable to

create enough scoring opportunities.
"Experience has taught me that
you often will rue missing if you miss
chances early in the game," Clark
said. "They often don't come back. It
is frustrating, but I think we played
right up until the last kick of the ball."
Mixed emotions enveloped the
players following the game.
"To be fair, I wish we could have
had a different result. It just wasn't
our day," Morrison said. "But hope
fully it will make us stronger. We
proved to ourselves that we can play
with UCLA, we just have to come
back strong now."
Zapala put the game back in the
perspective of the entire season.
"We are disappointed but we

have to gel on with it,"he said. "It
isn't easy to come down to UCLA
and come away with a victory
against the defending champs. Hav
ing said that, I think we put in a pret
ty good effort and we were a bit un
lucky today."
Stanford followed the loss at
UCLA with a victory against Sacra
mento State, 3-0, last night. Senior
Adam Siegman scored what turned
out to be the game-winning goal in
the 12th minute after stealing a pass
in front of the goal. Seniors Shan
Gaw and A.J. Sauer scored insur
ance goals later in the match. All
three goals were unassisted.
The Cardinal returns to Stanford
to host No. 11 Washington, on Friday.

have to gel on with it,"he said. "It
isn't easy to come down to UCLA
and come away with a victory
against the defending champs. Hav
ing said that, I think we put in a pret
ty good effort and we were a bit un
lucky today."
Stanford followed the loss at
UCLA with a victory against Sacra
mento State, 3-0, last night. Senior
Adam Siegman scored what turned
out to be the game-winning goal in
the 12th minute after stealing a pass
in front of the goal. Seniors Shan
Gaw and A.J. Sauer scored insur
ance goals later in the match. All
three goals were unassisted.
The Cardinal returns to Stanford
to host No. 11 Washington, on Friday.
