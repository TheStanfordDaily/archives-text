LOS ANGELES — It could have been a Hollywood
script with a happy ending. The underdog pulling out the
late victory, avenging last season's loss. One would ex
pect nothing less from a game staged in Southern Cali
fornia.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Friday: No. 2 UCLA (8-1. 1-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated No. 8 Stanford (8-3. 1-1). 1-0.
■ Yesterday: Stanford 3. Sacramento State 0.

But Friday night's game did not have the fairy-tale
ending the No. 8 Stanford men's soccer team (8-3, 1-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) had hoped for. The
No. 2 UCLA Bruins (8-1, 1-0 MPSF) capitalized on an
early goal and took the conference opener, 1 -0, from the
Cardinal.
In doing so, the Bruins extended their regular-season
winning streak at home to 24 games.
The story truly began, however, last year in the MPSF
title game. The Cardinal was shooting for its first ever
conference championship, as well as the No. 1 playoff

seed from the MPSF. Using their home-field advantage,
however, the Bruins took the game on a penalty kick and
never looked back on their run to the national title.
Act Two was supposed to be different.
It was not so much revenge that the Cardinal was
seeking, but rather capturing what the team believed
rightfully belonged to it in the first place — a victory at
UCLA.
Friday night, Stanford felt it played well, but didn't
follow through on its plans.
"I thought we deserved maybe a little bit more out of
it. I think most people would agree with that," said Stan
ford head coach Bobby Clark. "That is now twice that we
have come down here and played quite well and gone
away empty-handed."
Riding the momentum of an upset victory and a tour
nament title, the stage was set for Stanford to capture the
attention of the college soccer world.
However, what goes down in the books as a loss for
the Cardinal was a tremendous performance that had
Stanford coming up just short.
As the teams battled from the kickoff, the game was
very evenly matched, with much of it played around the
midfield. Stanford's defense played particularly well and
