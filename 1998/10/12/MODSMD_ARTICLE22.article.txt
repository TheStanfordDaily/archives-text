### Colleen Shaw 
Coming off its first home loss of
the season last week, the No. 9 Stan
ford women's soccer team (7-3-2, 1-
1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) was look
ing for solid performances in its Pac
-10 opening games this weekend.
The Cardinal needed to reestab
lish the momentum and confidence
it had at the beginning of the season.
Although controversial calls
plagued the Cardinal's Friday night
loss to the Arizona State Sun Devils.
Stanford reaffirmed its prominence
in the Pac-10 with a 8-1 rout of Ari
zona. yesterday afternoon.
Stanford struggled in its last few
games to play aggressively and not
just react defensively to its oppo

nents. Friday night was no excep
tion.
"We did not impose our style as
much as we could have," said senior
midfielder Tracye Lawyer. "They
were kicking the ball back down our

throats."
Some of Stanford's difficulties in
establishing its rhythm in the game
resulted from what it felt were ques
tionable calls.
Although two of Stanford's shots

found the net of the Arizona State
(6-3-2,1-0-0 Pac-10) goal, both goals
were later called hack due to offsides
violations.
"We just got a little unlucky out
there," said junior midfielder Ron
nie Fair. "It hurt our momentum."
Stanford head coach Steve Swan
son agreed but also felt that the Car
dinal should not have let the calls
distract it.
"We played very well," Swanson
said. "It's a bit unfortunate and a bit
unlucky. We needed a win.
"The calls are just part of the
game [and] we should not let them
affect our discipline on the field."

"to come here and move the ball
around well."
