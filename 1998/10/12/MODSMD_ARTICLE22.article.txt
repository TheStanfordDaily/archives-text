Coming off its first home loss of
the season last week, the No. 9 Stan
ford women's soccer team (7-3-2, 1-
1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) was look
ing for solid performances in its Pac
-10 opening games this weekend.
The Cardinal needed to reestab

Stanford reaffirmed its prominence
in the Pac-10 with a 8-1 rout of Ari

were later called hack due to offsides
violations.
"We just got a little unlucky out
there," said junior midfielder Ron
nie Fair. "It hurt our momentum."
Stanford head coach Steve Swan
son agreed but also felt that the Car
dinal should not have let the calls
distract it.
"We played very well," Swanson
said. "It's a bit unfortunate and a bit
unlucky. We needed a win.
"The calls are just part of the
game [and] we should not let them
affect our discipline on the field."
