How to make up for the loss of
the most successful class in the his
tory of women's college volleyball.
Such was the main question fac
ing the Stanford Cardinal heading
into the 1998 season.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Friday: No. 7 Stanford (12-2,7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) defeated
California (3-12, 9-7), 15-4, 15-6,
15-6.

A clear answer was given on Fri
day night at Maples Pavilion.
Even in the absence of junior
outside hitters and floor leaders
Kerri Walsh and Jaimi Gregory, a
young Stanford squad rolled to an
easy three-game victory over Cali
fornia (15-4,15-6,15-6).
The winning effort was led by
the Cardinal freshmen, who trans
lated their high acclaim as the na
tion's top recruiting class into suc
cess on the court.
And for a brief while, the 2,(X)1
fans on hand were able to forget
about the unparalleled accolades
of the Class of '97 and witness what
may be the beginning of a similar
dynasty.
No. 7 Stanford (12-2,7-0 Pacific
10 Conference) posted its 11th win
in a row, its 32nd consecutive Pac
-10 victory, behind the dazzling 14-
kill performance of freshman mid
dle blocker Sara Sandrik.
Sandrik added six blocks and
posted a .423 hitting percentage,
proving herself quite capable of fill

drik said. "It is always hard to fill in
for a player like Kerri, but I am just
glad that I was able to step in and
help our team win."
Freshman middle blocker Tara
Conrad tallied nine kills, while
classmate Michelle Chambers
added seven kills and five blocks at
the right outside hitter position.
"1 am very pleased with the per
formance," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw.
"Our younger players stepped
up and played really well, while the
older players like Sarah Clark and
Sarah Neal provided some stability
and leadership in the back row," he
added.
In particular, Clark accepted a
great deal of added defensive re
sponsibility with Walsh and Grego
ry sidelined.
"We started playing well from
the beginning, and never let up,"
Clark said. "We played together all
night, and were always talking out
there.
"Normally. 1 don't have to play
like a defensive specialist in the
back row. But 1 am working a lot
harder on passing, and 1 think it is
paying off," Clark added.
"It made it a lot easier knowing
that if I just passed the ball well, the
younger players would step up and
make plays," she said.
Much to the pleasure of Shaw,
Clark's hustle in the back row
seemed to rub off on all her team
mates.
"We have stressed hustle and
