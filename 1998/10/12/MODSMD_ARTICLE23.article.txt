How to make up for the loss of
the most successful class in the his
tory of women's college volleyball.
Such was the main question fac
ing the Stanford Cardinal heading
into the 1998 season.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Friday: No. 7 Stanford (12-2,7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) defeated
California (3-12, 9-7), 15-4, 15-6,
15-6.

A clear answer was given on Fri
day night at Maples Pavilion.
Even in the absence of junior
outside hitters and floor leaders
Kerri Walsh and Jaimi Gregory, a
young Stanford squad rolled to an
easy three-game victory over Cali
fornia (15-4,15-6,15-6).
The winning effort was led by
the Cardinal freshmen, who trans
lated their high acclaim as the na
tion's top recruiting class into suc
cess on the court.
And for a brief while, the 2,(X)1
fans on hand were able to forget
about the unparalleled accolades
of the Class of '97 and witness what
may be the beginning of a similar
dynasty.
No. 7 Stanford (12-2,7-0 Pacific
10 Conference) posted its 11th win
in a row, its 32nd consecutive Pac
-10 victory, behind the dazzling 14-
kill performance of freshman mid
dle blocker Sara Sandrik.
Sandrik added six blocks and
posted a .423 hitting percentage,
proving herself quite capable of fill
ing in for the injured Walsh.

"I feel total satisfaction knowing
I did the best job that I could," San
drik said. "It is always hard to fill in
for a player like Kerri, but I am just
glad that I was able to step in and
help our team win."
Freshman middle blocker Tara
Conrad tallied nine kills, while
classmate Michelle Chambers
added seven kills and five blocks at
the right outside hitter position.
"1 am very pleased with the per
formance," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw.
"Our younger players stepped
up and played really well, while the
older players like Sarah Clark and
Sarah Neal provided some stability
and leadership in the back row," he
added.
In particular, Clark accepted a
great deal of added defensive re
sponsibility with Walsh and Grego
ry sidelined.
"We started playing well from
the beginning, and never let up,"
Clark said. "We played together all
night, and were always talking out
there.
"Normally. 1 don't have to play
like a defensive specialist in the
back row. But 1 am working a lot
harder on passing, and 1 think it is
paying off," Clark added.
"It made it a lot easier knowing
that if I just passed the ball well, the
younger players would step up and
make plays," she said.
Much to the pleasure of Shaw,
Clark's hustle in the back row
seemed to rub off on all her team
mates.
"We have stressed hustle and
being aggressive on defense in
practice," Shaw said. "We want to
let fewer balls hit the floor, and
Sarah's added enthusiasm pushed
our team to really work out there for
every ball."
The Cardinal finished with a .404
hitting performance on the night, in
cluding a blistering .565 percentage
in the third game.
Cal, on the other hand, was held
to a lowly .103 hitting mark, with an
abysmal negative .037 performance
in game one.
"1 was happv that we were able to
hold their hitters in check," Shaw
said. "It all goes back to our service
game. Cal was a little short-handed,
and tried to pass with only two re
ceivers, and we did a great job ex
ploiting that.
"We were able to serve tough,
and made it very difficult for them to
set up their main weapons at the
net."
Stanford posted a season-best
eight service aces on the match, in
cluding freshman Emily Lawrence's
laser on match point that sent Cal in
terim coach Lee Maes back across
the bay in just over an hour.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the void left by Gregory's absence
will have to be filled once again. She
will undergo a minor arthroscopic
surgery early this week to repair car
tilage damage that will keep her
sidelined for between 10 days and
two weeks.

Walsh, on the other hand, is
quickly recovering from last Tues
day's shoulder surgery and should
be ready to play next weekend
against the Oregon schools.
The two-time Ail-American will
return at a seemingly perfect time, as
her younger teammates appear
ready to remove some of the offen
sive load off her weakened shoulder.
"During the match, I looked
around and noticed that there were
three freshmen and a sophomore,"
Clark said of Sandrik, Conrad,
Chambers and sophomore setter
Robvn Lewis, who had another qui
etly solid evening at the net, con
tributing 27 assists.
"1 had complete confidence in
them. They really stepped up and
proved that they belong on the floor
at this level," Clark said. "It will be
exciting to see them grow up on the
court and really help this team get to
the next level," she added.
With yesterday off, the Cardinal
will get to explore that next level as
conference play continues next
weekend.
The future aside, the newest
members of this quickly improving
team want to take it one day at a
time and do what every college
freshman craves — just have fun.
"We get along great off the court,
and that really translates to good
chemistry on the court," Sandrik
said. "I love our class. We are all hav
ing a great time."
But not as great a time as the fans
who are watching them blossom into
the next group of Stanford stars.
