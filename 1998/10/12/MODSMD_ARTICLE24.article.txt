What kind of grade would you
give children's media today in the
U.S.?
At the talk "Who's Watching Out
For Our Kids?" at the Law School
on Friday, approximately 90 percent
of the 6()-strong audience gave it dis
mal C's and D's.
However, Herb Scannell, presi
dent of Nickelodeon, the top cable
television channel for children, dis
agreed. Scannell said he believed
people tended to condemn the
whole medium of television without
carefully looking at the program
content.
"If you really look at television,
you'll find that there's some good
television on. More than what has
been around in my lifetime," Scan
nell said.
Also speaking was Jerry Yang,
one of the co-founders of Yahoo!,
the Internet search engine. Yang, a
1 WO Stanford graduate, commented
that the Internet is still pretty unde
veloped as a medium, thus the rules
and "grading" requirements are
very different from those used for
children's television.
Yang also pointed out that the In
ternet offers unique opportunities
for children's education as well as
entertainment.
"On the other hand, we can cre
ate a whole new canvas to give kids
more interactivity. For every bad
thing you can name, there are
tremendous benefits of kids being
involved in computer interactivity,"
Yang said. "We should try to em
phasize the positives and prevent the
negatives from happening," he said.
"The fact is that kids will be ex
posed earlier to computers and the
Internet. The Internet medium
could build up the short attention
span that kids already have because

they can stay as long as they want on
something or go somewhere else,"
Yang said.
"This has pretty fundamental im
plications for how we design pro
grams for kids and educate them on
the Net."
When asked by the moderator,
almost 80 percent of the audience
rated exposure to violence, above
exposure to sex and consumerism, as
their biggest concern in their chil
dren's media viewing.
In response, Scannell replied,
"There's a lot which actually can be
done without sex or violence and
that's what we try to do. For us, we
think that kids' television specifically
does not need to go there and we
don't go there. For instance, we will
not make a show with guns. We do
not have violent shows."
Scannell's stand received much
applause from the audience; howev
er, audience concerns did not stop
there. Most of the audience, many of
whom were Stanford Law School
alumni, were also concerned about
what their children were exposed to
over the Internet.
"I think it starts with educating
the parents. What needs to happen is
that the Internet becomes easier to
use and more accessible to parents,"
Yang replied.
For example, Yang said most par
ents would like to keep an account of
how many hours their children have
been on the Internet and what con
tent they have been exposed to.
Many parents would also like to
have the ability to block access to
certain objectionable site material,
he said.
"These software [programs] do
exist. But they're still very hard to
use. It's not easy to explain to par
ents who are not computer savvy.
