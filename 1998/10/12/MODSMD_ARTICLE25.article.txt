# Bracewell receives medal
## Engineering prof appointed to Order of Australia 
### Erica Platt Contributing writer 
Ronald N. Bracewell, professor
emeritus of electrical engineering,
faces an extraordinary dilemma.
On Sept. 24. Bracewell was ap
pointed as an officer in the General
Division of the Order of Australia,
but he has "nowhere to wear" the im
pressive gold medal that now sits
atop his desk in the Durand Build
ing.
Bracewell was recognized in June
by the Australian government for his
service to science in the fields of
radio astronomy and image recon
struction. Along with this citation.
Queen Elizabeth II of England, as
the sovereign of the Order of Aus
tralia, appointed Bracewell one of
the 11 officers to celebrate her birth
day. He was the only non-resident of
Australia and one of only two scien
tists to receive this honor.
"Receiving this award was very
remarkable and in fact, totally mysti
fying," said Bracewell. "I'm not even

sure how I was nominated."
Bracewell's colleagues, however,
are not as surprised by the honor.
"Ronald is an extremely intelli
gent and unusual guv who really
deserved this award," said Electrical
Engineering Prof. Antony Fraser-
Smith. "He introduced the Fourier
Transform, which is now widely used
by scientists and engineers all over
the world. And, because he's from
Australia originally, he's also an ex
pert on the eucalyptus trees around
campus."
Bracewell's original work on
image reconstruction was done part
ly in Sydney and partly at Stanford.
Born and raised in Sydney,
Bracewell joined the Electrical Engi
neering Department in 1955, where
he designed and built the first radio
instrument with the acuity of the
human eye â€” finer than one sixtieth
of a degree.
"I started my research here with
images of the sun," explained
Bracewell. "By measuring different
wavelengths and designing radio in

struments to them, you come closer
to finding the true diameter of the
sun."
Furthermore, his radio astronom
ical techniques also led to a method
of mapping that came into use for
medical purposes. CAT scans and
MRI scans are examples of medical
imaging directly connected with
radio astronomy.
Bracewell's research continues to
lead his field. Last month, re
searchers at the University of Ari
zona, trying to spot planets normally
hidden by a star's glare, were able to
wipe out the light from three stars in
the first demonstration of a tech
nique Bracewell proposed 20 years
ago.
"It's amazing, and also very excit
ing, that after all these years people
can dredge up my work and apply it
in fresh new ways," Bracewell said.
"In fact, N ASA plans to use the same
technique in order to bring back an
image of a solar system outside of
our own," hopefully in 10 to 15 years,
he said.
