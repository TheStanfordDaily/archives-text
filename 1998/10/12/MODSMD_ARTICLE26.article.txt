# Henry Gates speaks today

### Shalini Bhargava Dana Mulhauser Contributing writers 
Henry Louis Gates, Jr., chair of
the Afro-American Studies Depart
ment at Harvard University, will
speak tonight at 7 p.m. in Kresge Au
ditorium on "Race and Class / Race
in Class."
Gates, known almost as much for
his social and cultural commentary
as for his scholarly work, is the au
thor of several influential books, in
cluding "The Signifying Monkey: A
Theory of Afro-American Literary
Criticism."
"In his own field, he has made the
most important contribution in the
last 10 to 15 years," said Compara
tive Literature Prof. Hans Gum
brecht, coordinator of the Presiden
tial Lecture Series, the program that
is bringing Gates to campus. " The
Signifying Monkey,' which talks
about how certain cultural elements
that we are familiar with in African-
American culture came from Africa,
promotes one of the most influential
theories we have."
Gates, who is also the director of
the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for
Alro-American Studies at Harvard,
has published articles in lime, the
New Yorker, and the New Republic,
and was recently quoted in Mother
Jones criticizing President Clinton.
"You never know where Clinton
stands and he doesn't seem loyal to
his own vision," Gates told Mother
Jones. "When he ran and even a few
months after he was elected, I knew
what he stood for, but now I don't
and it's too bad."

According to Gumbrecht, one of
Gates' strongest appeals is this role
as a vocal leader and critic.
"People have criticized him for
being an operator, but I think it's fab
ulous," said Gumbrecht. "He is ag
gressive, he can deal with money and
organizations, but he is also a fabu
lous scholar."
Gates, the co-editor of the Norton
Anthology of African-American
Literature, is also known to hobnob
with Steven Spielberg and Spike
Lee.
In the last seven years, Gates has
transformed Harvard's Afro-Ameri
can Studies Department from a
small-scale office into a nationally re
spected department.
"His department is so well orga
nized, it's a good model for what you
can do with the humanities," said
Gumbrecht. "What's even more
meritorious, he has done it in a disci
pline that is very young."
As a result. Gates has explored
the role of the humanities in higher
education and now "comes closer
than any other speaker to what this
series is about," Gumbrecht said.
Gates, who grew up in West Vir
ginia, is "a self-made man — as an
undergraduate, he was already writ
ing for Time magazine," Gumbrecht
said.
"Very few people stand symboli
cally for minorities as Gates does; he
is very self-ironic and self-aware," he
added.
"He was a Yalie as an undergrad
uate when deconstruction was a big
deal at Yale. Unlike many others
who don't take pride in the theoreti
cal scene, Gates has grown up in high

theory," said Gumbrecht.
Despite his sophisticated theoret
ical scholarship, Gates is "more
about momentum — he is not very
ideological," Gumbrecht said.
"As long as he sees some activity
and commitment, he won't think he
has the recipe for the answer. All in
stitutes don't have to be like his [to
do good work]."
According to Gumbrecht, Gates'
projects at the Du Bois institute are
very empirical. "(He is] documenting
the slave trade, not to show that slav
ery was evil, but to document the
prices of slaves, [and] the areas in
Africa from which they came."
The lecture will be followed to
morrow with a discussion with Gates
at the Humanities Center Annex
from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.
The Presidential Lecture Series is
an initiative started by University
President Gerhard Casper last Octo
ber to help promote the humanities
at Stanford.
"The series is a statement affirm
ing Stanford's support for the hu
manities internally and externally. 1
think it is internally very important
because the humanities tend to feel
defeated [here]," Gumbrecht said.
The Series's next lecturer, biolo
gist Stephen Jay Gould, will speak on
Nov. 4 at 7 p.m. at the Science and
Engineering Quad.
Future speakers include literary
critic Karl Heinz Bohrer, Nobel Lau
reate playwright Wole Soyinka,
philosopher Jacques Derrida and
novelist Umberto Eco. The Univer
sity is in the process of finalizing
plans to bring cellist Yo-Yo Ma to
Stanford as well.
