### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
Though the process may not have
been pretty, the results came just as
expected as the No. 1 Stanford men
rolled to victory at Saturday's Bob
Timmons Pre-NCAA meet in
Lawrence, Kan.
Led by the filth-place finish of se
nior Brad Hauser in 24 minutes and

46 seconds, the Cardinal tallied 80
points. Hying past 31 other schools
and besting second-place Oregon by
23 points to capture the team title.
Stanford's score nearly doubled
the 43 points they garnered as last
year's Fre-NCAA champions in
Furman, N.C.
Butler's Julius Mwangi was the
individual champion with a course
record time of 23:47

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY

■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford took first
place in the Bob Timmons Pre-
NCAA Meet.

In their first competition of the
season, Cardinal Brad and twin
brother Brent Hauser showed that
they have not lost their competitive
edge and remain established among
the nations elite harriers.
The Hausers joined a lead group
early in the race chasing Mwangi,
who had established a 100-meter
lead by the second mile marker.
Though the group was unable to
reel Mwangi in, the Hausers held
their own, finishing just behind
NCAA 5,000-meter champion
Adam Goucher of Colorado and Pa
cific 10 conference foes Abdi Abdi
rahman of Arizona and Bernard
Lagat of Washington State.
Oregon's Matthew Davis slipped
in behind Brad Hauser, relegating
Brent to a seventh-place finish in
24:49
"The Hausers are phenomenal
competitors," assistant coach Mike
Reilly said, praising their progress in
their first competition of the year.
"They are always excited to get a
chance to race."
The remainder of the Cardinal
contingent lost contact with the
leaders early, however, and had a

difficult time retaining composure
and running as a pack over the long
hills of the course.
Senior Jason Balkman was third
for the Cardinal and 15th overall
(25:15), while senior Jonathan Wel
don (25:33) and redshirt freshman
Gabe Jennings (25:35) finished up
the scoring for the Cardinal in 27th
and 29th places, respectively.
Also competing for Stanford
were freshman Jamey Gifford (43rd
place, 25:49), sophomore Thomas
Murley (74th place, 26:05) and ju
nior Jake Maas (75th place, 26:07).
If nothing else, the Cardinal got
first-hand experience with the
rolling hills and rugged terrain at
Rim Rock Farm, the site of Nov. 23's
NCAA national meet.
The course, riddled with steep in
clines and declines as well as some
treacherous turns, will provide a
strong challenge to all teams at the
national meet, especially since the
racing distance will increase from
eight to 10 kilometers.
Lananna plans on using Satur
day's racing experience to hone a
strategy to use over the same terrain
in November.
Solid victories over No. 3 Col
orado (120 points), No. 5 Arizona
(186) and No. 4 North Carolina
State only bolster Stanford's top
billing, but the close brush with the
dark horse No. 9 Oregon may be a
bit unsettling for the Cardinal harri
ers.
Oregon, a perennial Pac-10 cross
country threat, was hampered by the
collapse of their fifth runner due to
dehydration and may have had the
potential to score even better.
Arkansas, which ranks second in
the nation and was idle over the
weekend, will also be a serious
threat to the Cardinal cause in No
vember.
