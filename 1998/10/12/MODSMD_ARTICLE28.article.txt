The Cardinal women's cross
country team made a statement this
past weekend in Lawrence, Kan.
That statement was — don't
count us out.

WOMEN'S CROSS
COUNTRY

■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford took first
place in the Bob Timmons Pre-
NCAA Meet.

After being convincingly defeat
ed by BYU at the Stanford Invita
tional a week earlier, the Cardinal
bounced back at the Bob Timmons
Pre-National Invitational at the
University of Kansas to grab a con
vincing victory over a 35-team field.
Though the No. 3 Cardinal was
the only team ranked in the top five
present at the meet, the dominance
it showed in a field consisting of nine
of the top 30 teams was very impres
sive.
All five women to score for the
Cardinal including Julia Stamps (4th
place), Sally Glynn (6th place), Car
oline Annis (10th place), Malindi
Elmore (21st place) and Mary Cobb
(24th place) were among the top 25
finishers. Their total score of 65 was
less than half of their nearest com
petition, 10th ranked Arizona (138).
The top five was rounded out by
Northern Arizona (149), Villanova
(152) and North Carolina State
(162).
Individually, Arizona's tandem
of Amy Skieresz and Tara Chaplin
finished first and second, in times of
17 minutes even and 17:15, respec
tively. They were followed by Laris
sa Kleinmann of Boston University.
Claiming the No. 5 spot was Marie

Davis of Oregon.
Assistant coach Beth Alford-Sul
livan was well satisfied with the day.
"I was very pleased," Sullivan
said, 'i thought that our team per
formed extremely well. We had kids
really perform to their potential
right now in October and the out
come was very encouraging for the
future."
While it has become common
place to see Stamps up front, Glynn
shined nearly as bright on Saturday,
finishing just over two seconds be
hind Stamps' 17:28. She credited it
as the result of a planned strategy
that worked out.
"Individually, this race definitely
meant a lot to me in that I feel that I
often don't run aggressively enough
and 1 really wanted to make an ef
fort to go out a little harder than I
normally do," Glynn said. "It
worked well for me yesterday, so
hopefully next I race I'll do the same
thing again."
Freshmen Caroline Annis and
Malindi Elmore also ran well.
"Our premise is to maintain the
level of championship program that
we have and to see the young ath
letes step into the program and
make significant contributions,"
said Sullivan, reflecting on the fresh
man duo. "I was very pleased with
them. They handled themselves
well. They were extremely confident
and presented themselves in a very
athletically mature fashion and it
was really exciting to see them step
up."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the performances by the women on
Saturday will not guarantee them
anything in November when the
NCAAs are run on the same course.
What will be important, though, is
the experience of running the
course, which was deemed tough by

both Stamps and Glynn.
"it's a course that Stanford is def
initely going to have an advantage
on because the Stanford team is a
strong team and we are going to run
well on a course that takes a strong
runner," Stamps said. "I think that
the course is definitely challenging."
"We are going to try over the
next month and half to work on up
hills because up-hill seems to be the
most significant part of the course,"
added Glynn.
Sullivan also stressed the impor
tance of getting familiar with the
course in talking to her team prior to
the race,
"We can start to prepare to run
well on it," said Sullivan.
