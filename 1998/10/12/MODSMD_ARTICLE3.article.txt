# 'Chaos' revised: No more tents
## 75 percent of campers to get tickets 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran 
In a decision handed down yes
terday evening, the Athletics De
partment decided to end the week
old sleepout outside Maples Pavil
ion for tickets for the men's basket
ball 1998-99 season.
Every group that was in line,
from the front to the very back, will
receive enough tickets for 75 per
cent of its members who registered
last Friday. Two-thirds of those —
or 50 percent of the group — will be
for the Sixth Man Club. The last
one-third — 25 percent of the group
— are regular season tickets. In all,
about 1.2(H) tickets will be allotted.
"We felt that the situation as it
stood yesterday was not completely
fair to all students who were in line,"
said Jamie Zaninovich, director of
marketing and operations for men's
basketball. "This, in our opinion,
was the best solution for every
body."
For the past eight days, more
than 1.6(H) students had Hocked to
Maples to get in line to buy tickets.
The tickets, which go on sale on Fri
day, are divided into two groups.
Seven hundred are memberships in
the Sixth Man Club, in its sixth year
of existence. The next 4(H) available
are regular student season tickets.
"My office became aware that
the integrity of the registered line
was not completely upheld," said*

Zaninovich.
Zaninovich and the Athletics
Department, including basketball
head coach Mike Montgomery and
Athletic Director Ted Leland, met
at 6 p.m. yesterday evening and
agreed that this was"the best thing
to do," according to Zaninovich.
The final decision was handed down
at a meeting of all of the student
group leaders with Zaninovich at 7
p.m.
Each group will decide for itself
how to allot tickets among its indi
vidual members. Some groups will
form lotteries for tickets. Others will
allot tickets based on hours served
in line. Each group leader will sub
mit a list to Zaninovich by midnight
tomorrow.
"This type of distribution, we
felt, is most fair to everyone that was
in line," Zaninovich said. "There
were some who remained at the
back of the line for days even though
they knew that they had no chance
at a ticket. That is the type of loyalty
and dedication that we are looking
for in our fans."
Those students whose names
were submitted will still need to buy
their tickets at 9 p.m. this Friday.
These students may buy their tickets
at the price of $55 for Sixth Man
tickets and $30 for season tickets.
Any unclaimed tickets will be
grouped and distributed in a lottery
of all registered students who did not
receive tickets.
"Without a doubt, this year's re
sponse has been unprecedented.
Never had we had so many students
in line so soon to buy tickets for the
upcoming season," said Zaninovich.
Members of the team got in
volved in the situation as well.
"Even in my dorm, people [were]
trying to get me to sleep out to man a
tent," said Mark Madsen, a starting
forward on the basketball team.
The frenzy came as a result of the
Cardinal's recent success, culminat
ing in a Final Four appearance last
March and a No. 1 preseason rank
ing this year in Athlon Magazine.
Such interest was a new phenome
non for the Athletics Department,
continuously sending it scrambling
to develop new ticket policies.
Following the ticket sale, the first
annual "Cardinal Chaos," Stan
ford's version of "Midnight Mad
ness," will occur in Maples. In addi
tion to being the first regular-season
practice for both the men's and
women's teams, it offers students the
opportunity to participate in a num
ber of activities.
Student response
Most students were pleased with
the yesterday's decision.
"It's a sensible decision. It was
bordering on insanity out [there]."
said Julia Goodkough, a freshman.
"The only problem now is that we
have to figure out a way to distribute
the tickets among our group."
There are other students who feel
similarly.
"By dividing the tickets among
the groups the student sections be-'
come more representative, just as
long as they are divided fairly," said
sophomore Charles Schoonover.

But, some fans who spent a con
siderable amount of time at Maples
aren't completely pleased.
"The die-hard fans who want
tickets most aren't guaranteed to get
tickets," said Mark .Petersen, a se
nior. "I don't think it's really fair.
This is my fourth year and I've at
tended every season."
"1 think that it's a crappy situa
tion. It's not fair that people got here
almost two weeks early and it still
wasn't enough." said senior Alex
Teekell.
And. other students are more
ambivalent.
"The rules were a good-faith ef
fort. but obviously weren't enough."
said Michael Whitaker, a sopho
more. "Stanford was beginning to
look a lot like Duke."
Duke University, whose basket
ball program is consistently one of
the best in the nation, is one of the
few other universities whose student
body is as enthusiastic as Stanford's
was this year. Duke students, how
ever, must line up to receive tickets
before each game.
"Before the North Carolina game
last year [at Duke], students slept
out beginning in early January for a
game during the second week of
February," Whitaker said.
Official response
Zaninovich admits that because
the situation this year outside Maples
had never occurred, his office was
not fully prepared to deal with all the
issues that eventually arose.
"We didn't really know what to
expect," he said. "We did learn a lot
from what happened this year, which
will make us better prepared for fu
ture years."
The Stanford basketball team is
impressed with the dedication that
its fans so obviously exhibited over
the past week. In a letter to students
in line, Coach Montgomery wrote,
"you are a testament to the fact that
we have the best college basketball

fans in the country right here at Stan
ford. Your show of support is appre
ciated by our team, staff and the
Athletics Department as a whole."
Players such as Madsen recognize
the enthusiasm of the student body
for its upcoming season.
"As players, we feel really fortu
nate to have such great fans out
there," he said.
The administration was also en
thusiastic but wary of what effects
such an event might have had on the
students involved.
"While it [was] great to see such
excitement. 1 [was] troubled by the
demands of this very complicated
process," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais. "If students [were to]
miss class or [lose] valuable study
time while in line, it could [have had]
potentially serious consequences."
Zaninovich explained, "while we
realize that the process was very in
volved, we tried our best to make it
as flexible as possible for the stu
dents."
He continued. "The spirit of
those who were in line and even
those not in line was truly inspiring."
Sixth man history
According to Zaninovich, the
Sixth Man Club was conceived pri
marily as a way to reward loyal fans
for their support and attendance.
The members receive courtside
seating for all home games. In addi
tion. should the team go into the
postseason, members receive priori
ty on ticket sales.
"The seats for [Sixth Man] are
much better than the regular-season
tickets," said Whitaker.
The history of the club has not
been without incident, however.
Among other occurrences during
the games, the club shouted "Who's
your daddy?" at former Arizona
point guard Mike Bibby. Bibby is es
tranged from his father, USC head
basketball coach Henry Bibby.
Members of the club also waved

oversized phoney joints and yelled
"marijuana" at UCLA player Jelani
McCoy, who had been suspended
earlier in the year for alleged mari
juana possession.
The Bibby incident caused Le
land to reconsider the club's seating
location. In addition he asked, "have
we created a monster?"
University President Gerhard
Casper said that "students have a re
sponsibility to protect the University
name, and actions like [the Bibby
comments] weaken the University
rather than strengthen it."
Leland hoped that this year's
squad would conduct themselves in
a more appropriate manner.
The outlook
While each group will receive its
allotment of tickets, it will be their
decision how to distribute them.
"Even though it is up to each
group how to divide up the tickets
amongst themselves, I encourage
each of them to share the tickets with
everyone in their group," said Zani
novich. " There are plenty of home
games for everyone to be a part of
the action.
"And, not only will the student
sections be filled at all games as a re
sult. those fans in attendance will be
the more spirited than ever," he
added.
After the group leaders have sub
mitted their final lists to Zaninovich.
ticket assignments will be posted on
the Web. Further Cardinal Chaos
related events will take place as
scheduled.
Overall, however, basketball
fever hit harder this year than any
one expected.
Said Madsen, "I thought there
might be a few tents, but this is unbe
lievable."

Members of the team got in
volved in the situation as well.
"Even in my dorm, people [were]
trying to get me to sleep out to man a
tent," said Mark Madsen, a starting
forward on the basketball team.
The frenzy came as a result of the
Cardinal's recent success, culminat
ing in a Final Four appearance last
March and a No. 1 preseason rank
ing this year in Athlon Magazine.
Such interest was a new phenome
non for the Athletics Department,
continuously sending it scrambling
to develop new ticket policies.
Following the ticket sale, the first
annual "Cardinal Chaos," Stan
ford's version of "Midnight Mad
ness," will occur in Maples. In addi
tion to being the first regular-season
practice for both the men's and
women's teams, it offers students the
opportunity to participate in a num
ber of activities.
Student response
Most students were pleased with
the yesterday's decision.
"It's a sensible decision. It was
bordering on insanity out [there]."
said Julia Goodkough, a freshman.
"The only problem now is that we
have to figure out a way to distribute
the tickets among our group."
There are other students who feel
similarly.
"By dividing the tickets among
the groups the student sections be-'
come more representative, just as
long as they are divided fairly," said
sophomore Charles Schoonover.

But, some fans who spent a con
siderable amount of time at Maples
aren't completely pleased.
"The die-hard fans who want
tickets most aren't guaranteed to get
tickets," said Mark .Petersen, a se
nior. "I don't think it's really fair.
This is my fourth year and I've at
tended every season."
"1 think that it's a crappy situa
tion. It's not fair that people got here
almost two weeks early and it still
wasn't enough." said senior Alex
Teekell.
And. other students are more
ambivalent.
"The rules were a good-faith ef
fort. but obviously weren't enough."
said Michael Whitaker, a sopho
more. "Stanford was beginning to
look a lot like Duke."
Duke University, whose basket
ball program is consistently one of
the best in the nation, is one of the
few other universities whose student
body is as enthusiastic as Stanford's
was this year. Duke students, how
ever, must line up to receive tickets
before each game.
"Before the North Carolina game
last year [at Duke], students slept
out beginning in early January for a
game during the second week of
February," Whitaker said.
Official response
Zaninovich admits that because
the situation this year outside Maples
had never occurred, his office was
not fully prepared to deal with all the
issues that eventually arose.
"We didn't really know what to
expect," he said. "We did learn a lot
from what happened this year, which
will make us better prepared for fu
ture years."
The Stanford basketball team is
impressed with the dedication that
its fans so obviously exhibited over
the past week. In a letter to students
in line, Coach Montgomery wrote,
"you are a testament to the fact that
we have the best college basketball

fans in the country right here at Stan
ford. Your show of support is appre
ciated by our team, staff and the
Athletics Department as a whole."
Players such as Madsen recognize
the enthusiasm of the student body
for its upcoming season.
"As players, we feel really fortu
nate to have such great fans out
there," he said.
The administration was also en
thusiastic but wary of what effects
such an event might have had on the
students involved.
"While it [was] great to see such
excitement. 1 [was] troubled by the
demands of this very complicated
process," said Dean of Students
Marc Wais. "If students [were to]
miss class or [lose] valuable study
time while in line, it could [have had]
potentially serious consequences."
Zaninovich explained, "while we
realize that the process was very in
volved, we tried our best to make it
as flexible as possible for the stu
dents."
He continued. "The spirit of
those who were in line and even
those not in line was truly inspiring."
Sixth man history
According to Zaninovich, the
Sixth Man Club was conceived pri
marily as a way to reward loyal fans
for their support and attendance.
The members receive courtside
seating for all home games. In addi
tion. should the team go into the
postseason, members receive priori
ty on ticket sales.
"The seats for [Sixth Man] are
much better than the regular-season
tickets," said Whitaker.
The history of the club has not
been without incident, however.
Among other occurrences during
the games, the club shouted "Who's
your daddy?" at former Arizona
point guard Mike Bibby. Bibby is es
tranged from his father, USC head
basketball coach Henry Bibby.
Members of the club also waved

oversized phoney joints and yelled
"marijuana" at UCLA player Jelani
McCoy, who had been suspended
earlier in the year for alleged mari
juana possession.
The Bibby incident caused Le
land to reconsider the club's seating
location. In addition he asked, "have
we created a monster?"
University President Gerhard
Casper said that "students have a re
sponsibility to protect the University
name, and actions like [the Bibby
comments] weaken the University
rather than strengthen it."
Leland hoped that this year's
squad would conduct themselves in
a more appropriate manner.
The outlook
While each group will receive its
allotment of tickets, it will be their
decision how to distribute them.
"Even though it is up to each
group how to divide up the tickets
amongst themselves, I encourage
each of them to share the tickets with
everyone in their group," said Zani
novich. " There are plenty of home
games for everyone to be a part of
the action.
"And, not only will the student
sections be filled at all games as a re
sult. those fans in attendance will be
the more spirited than ever," he
added.
After the group leaders have sub
mitted their final lists to Zaninovich.
ticket assignments will be posted on
the Web. Further Cardinal Chaos
related events will take place as
scheduled.
Overall, however, basketball
fever hit harder this year than any
one expected.
Said Madsen, "I thought there
might be a few tents, but this is unbe
lievable."

In a decision handed down yes
terday evening, the Athletics De
partment decided to end the week
old sleepout outside Maples Pavil
ion for tickets for the men's basket
ball 1998-99 season.
Every group that was in line,
from the front to the very back, will
receive enough tickets for 75 per
cent of its members who registered
last Friday. Two-thirds of those —
or 50 percent of the group — will be
for the Sixth Man Club. The last
one-third — 25 percent of the group
— are regular season tickets. In all,
about 1.2(H) tickets will be allotted.
"We felt that the situation as it
stood yesterday was not completely
fair to all students who were in line,"
said Jamie Zaninovich, director of
marketing and operations for men's
basketball. "This, in our opinion,
was the best solution for every
body."
For the past eight days, more
than 1.6(H) students had Hocked to
Maples to get in line to buy tickets.
The tickets, which go on sale on Fri
day, are divided into two groups.
Seven hundred are memberships in
the Sixth Man Club, in its sixth year
of existence. The next 4(H) available
are regular student season tickets.
"My office became aware that
the integrity of the registered line
was not completely upheld," said*

Zaninovich.
Zaninovich and the Athletics
Department, including basketball
head coach Mike Montgomery and
Athletic Director Ted Leland, met
at 6 p.m. yesterday evening and
agreed that this was"the best thing
to do," according to Zaninovich.
The final decision was handed down
at a meeting of all of the student
group leaders with Zaninovich at 7
p.m.
Each group will decide for itself
how to allot tickets among its indi
vidual members. Some groups will
form lotteries for tickets. Others will
allot tickets based on hours served
in line. Each group leader will sub
mit a list to Zaninovich by midnight
tomorrow.
"This type of distribution, we
felt, is most fair to everyone that was
in line," Zaninovich said. "There
were some who remained at the
back of the line for days even though
they knew that they had no chance
at a ticket. That is the type of loyalty
and dedication that we are looking
for in our fans."
Those students whose names
were submitted will still need to buy
their tickets at 9 p.m. this Friday.
These students may buy their tickets
at the price of $55 for Sixth Man
tickets and $30 for season tickets.
Any unclaimed tickets will be
grouped and distributed in a lottery
of all registered students who did not
receive tickets.
"Without a doubt, this year's re
sponse has been unprecedented.
Never had we had so many students
in line so soon to buy tickets for the
upcoming season," said Zaninovich.
Members of the team got in
volved in the situation as well.
"Even in my dorm, people [were]
trying to get me to sleep out to man a
