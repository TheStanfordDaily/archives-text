In a decision handed down yes
terday evening, the Athletics De
partment decided to end the week
old sleepout outside Maples Pavil
ion for tickets for the men's basket
ball 1998-99 season.
Every group that was in line,
from the front to the very back, will
receive enough tickets for 75 per
cent of its members who registered
last Friday. Two-thirds of those —
or 50 percent of the group — will be
for the Sixth Man Club. The last
one-third — 25 percent of the group
— are regular season tickets. In all,
about 1.2(H) tickets will be allotted.
"We felt that the situation as it
stood yesterday was not completely
fair to all students who were in line,"
said Jamie Zaninovich, director of
marketing and operations for men's
basketball. "This, in our opinion,
was the best solution for every
body."
For the past eight days, more
than 1.6(H) students had Hocked to
Maples to get in line to buy tickets.
The tickets, which go on sale on Fri
day, are divided into two groups.
Seven hundred are memberships in
the Sixth Man Club, in its sixth year
of existence. The next 4(H) available
are regular student season tickets.
"My office became aware that
the integrity of the registered line
was not completely upheld," said*

Zaninovich.
Zaninovich and the Athletics
Department, including basketball
head coach Mike Montgomery and
Athletic Director Ted Leland, met
at 6 p.m. yesterday evening and
agreed that this was"the best thing
to do," according to Zaninovich.
The final decision was handed down
at a meeting of all of the student
group leaders with Zaninovich at 7
p.m.
Each group will decide for itself
how to allot tickets among its indi
vidual members. Some groups will
form lotteries for tickets. Others will
allot tickets based on hours served
in line. Each group leader will sub
mit a list to Zaninovich by midnight
tomorrow.
"This type of distribution, we
felt, is most fair to everyone that was
in line," Zaninovich said. "There
were some who remained at the
back of the line for days even though
they knew that they had no chance
at a ticket. That is the type of loyalty
and dedication that we are looking
for in our fans."
Those students whose names
were submitted will still need to buy
their tickets at 9 p.m. this Friday.
These students may buy their tickets
at the price of $55 for Sixth Man
tickets and $30 for season tickets.
Any unclaimed tickets will be
