# Cardinal at the basement of the Pacific 10
## Oregon State defeats Stanford 30-23, for first victory in Stanford Stadium since 1968 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
The Stanford football team (1-5,
0-3 Pacific 10 Conference) finally
found an opponent it could physi
cally contend with in the Oregon
State Beavers (4-2, 1-2).
Unfortunately, mental mistakes
and special teams blunders extend
ed the Cardinal's three-game losing
streak, giving the Beavers their first
win at Stanford stadium since 1%8,
with a final score of 30-23.
The game started in a fashion
eerily similar to Stanford's last two
losses at Oregon and Notre Dame.
Oregon won the toss and the ball,
and promptly marched down the
field on the strength of quarterback
Terrance Bryant's arm. Unlike dur
ing the games against Oregon and
Notre Dame, however, the much
maligned Stanford defense stood up
near their own goal line and man
aged to keep the Beavers out of the
end zone. Safety Aaron Focht de
flected a Bryant pass intended for
wideout Greg Ainsworth on third
and six. bringing out the field goal
unit of Oregon State. Jose Cortez
gave Oregon State the lead with a
42-yard field goal.
Back from an ankle injury suf
fered during the game against Ari

zona, Stanford flanker Troy Walters
made his presence known right
away with two receptions on the en
suing Cardinal drive for 40 yards, 14
of them coming on a fantastic diving
catch on a deep crossing pattern
near the Oregon State sideline.
Ouarterback Todd Husak then
found wideout Deßonnie Pitts in
the end zone for the lead.
Defensive end Willie Howard
came back strong, after leaving the
game briefly, and managed to snuff
an Oregon State drive at the Stan
ford 25-yard line when he reached
through the Beaver line to block
Jose Cortex's second field goal at
tempt.
Stanford blew a chance to add
another touchdown after holding
was called against the Beaver sec
ondary on its own one-yard line.
Sophomore Kandv Fasani en
tered the game to run the goal-line
offense, but fumbled the snap and
had to fall on the ball, bringing up
second and goal. Rolling out right,
Fasani found Russell Stewart wide
open in the end zone, but the junior
tight end dropped the lob pass.
Husak reentered the game, but was
forced to throw the ball away under
a heavy Beaver rush, and Kevin
Miller kicked the 20-yard field goal
to give the Cardinal a 10-3 lead.

Halfway through the second
quarter, Husak broke the NCAA
record for consecutive passes at
tempted without an interception
thrown, only to see the streak
snapped when Oregon State corner
back Andre Holland picked off a
Husak lob in the end zone.

said. "The safety had come up and I
thought I had Troy. Unfortunately,
I didn't see the backside safety. That
was a bad read by me."
Alter Oregon State went three
and out, Stanford wideouts Dave
Davis and Pitts combined for the
play of the game. Husak dropped
buck and managed to get rid of the
ball while getting crunched by
Beaver nose guard Shawn Battle,
throwing a laser beam to Pitts on an
out pattern. The junior flanker,
however, couldn't hang on and bob
bled the ball three times into the
hands of a waiting Davis. He
streaked to the Oregon State eight
yard line before being forced out of
bounds setting up a Kevin Miller
field goal attempt.
"I had a deep hook. Ronnie had
an over." Davis said. "I saw [Husak]
throw the ball, [and] saw it juggled.
Ronnie made a great play tipping it
to me."
However, that's when Stanford's
special teams woes came to the fore
front. Miller's 24-yard field goal was
blocked and recovered by the
Beavers, and the Cardinal came
away empty-handed after a solid
drive that started with good field po
sition.
"I think it might have just been a
low kick." Willingham said.
As bad as the blocked kick was, it
was insignificant compared with
what was to come. Oregon State
marched down the field in seven
plays for a Simonton touchdown.
On the ensuing kickoff, sopho
more running back Coy Wire never
got possession of the ball as it
bounced off his chest and dribbled
towards the onrushing Beavers.

Davis, the far side return man, tried
to scoop the ball up but couldn't get
a handle on it as he, the ball and
Oregon State's coverage team all ar
rived simultaneously at the Stanford
goal line in a chaotic collision.
After a fierce battle for the ball
under a pile of red and black jerseys,
Beaver linebacker Brandon Boice
came away with the ball and six
points for a 20-10 Oregon State lead.
"You just hate the fact that you
let that [fumble] decide the game,"
Willingham said. "We shot our
selves in the foot and that is disap
pointing."
To its credit, Stanford came back
and executed a perfect two-minute
drill to end the first half. Walters
hauled in a Husak lob at the Oregon
State one-yard line, somehow
squirming between two significantly
taller defenders for 38 yards to set
up a touchdown blast by fullback
Maxwell Stevenson. Stevenson was
injured on the play, however, leav
ing Oregon State with a 20-17 lead at
the half.
In the second half, the Cardinal
continued to pass almost at will
against the Beaver secondary, but
special teams miscues cost it the
game.
With the score tied at 23-23,
halfway through the fourth quarter,
Walters fumbled a punt at the Stan
ford 30-yard line and the Beavers re
covered and quickly converted the
gift into a Simonton touchdown.
Stanford got a chance to tie the
score once more, but Husak was
picked off in the end zone by nickel
back Armon Hatcher. Oregon State
ran out the clock for a 30-23 win.
The loss stings Cardinal fans per
haps even more than the last two
routs at Oregon and Notre Dame.
Stanford finally got a team it could
contend with, but mistakes and spe
cial teams disasters spoiled the po
tential homecoming victory.
In the game, however, Husak
broke the Stanford record for pass
ing yards in a single game, surpass
ing Steve Dils mark of 430 by 20
yards.
"I'm here to win." Husak said. "If
I had gone two for 10 for five yards,
and we win, I'd be happier then I am
now. Sure, it's nice to have [the
record), but I'd rather win."

Davis, Walters, and Pitts each
had over 1(X) yards receiving, the
first time three receivers had accom
plished the feat in Stanford history.
"It doesn't matter to me." Pitts
said. "I want to win. II I don't need
to get the hall to win. that's my role,
and I'm happy with my role."
Other bright spots for the Cardi
nal included defensive end Willie
Howard's return from a first-quar
ter injury to block a kick and pro
duce a key sack to kill a third quar
ter Beaver drive. Reuben Carter
showed some spark when he re
placed Brian Taylor at cornerback
in the early second quarter. Taylor
had been beaten five times on seven
passes for 71 yards. One of the in

completions came on a touchdown
called back because flanker Greg
Ainsworth couldn't gel a foot in the
end zone.
"We're trying to find someone
who can give us solid play [at the
cornerback position]." Willingham
said.
In the end. the momentum
changes from the special teams
turnovers were too much for Stan
ford to overcome as they dropped to
0-3 in the Pac-1().
"Anytime you lose, it eats at your
stomach a little more. It takes a
chunk out of you." Willingham said,
"but you have to remember — their
guvs are on scholarship too."

halfway through the fourth quarter,
Walters fumbled a punt at the Stan
ford 30-yard line and the Beavers re
covered and quickly converted the
gift into a Simonton touchdown.
Stanford got a chance to tie the
score once more, but Husak was
picked off in the end zone by nickel
back Armon Hatcher. Oregon State
ran out the clock for a 30-23 win.
The loss stings Cardinal fans per
haps even more than the last two
routs at Oregon and Notre Dame.
Stanford finally got a team it could
contend with, but mistakes and spe

tential homecoming victory.
In the game, however, Husak
broke the Stanford record for pass
ing yards in a single game, surpass
ing Steve Dils mark of 430 by 20
yards.
"I'm here to win." Husak said. "If
I had gone two for 10 for five yards,
and we win, I'd be happier then I am
now. Sure, it's nice to have [the
record), but I'd rather win."

Davis, Walters, and Pitts each
had over 1(X) yards receiving, the
first time three receivers had accom
plished the feat in Stanford history.
"It doesn't matter to me." Pitts
said. "I want to win. II I don't need
to get the hall to win. that's my role,
and I'm happy with my role."
Other bright spots for the Cardi
nal included defensive end Willie
Howard's return from a first-quar

showed some spark when he re
placed Brian Taylor at cornerback
in the early second quarter. Taylor
had been beaten five times on seven
passes for 71 yards. One of the in

completions came on a touchdown
called back because flanker Greg
Ainsworth couldn't gel a foot in the
end zone.
"We're trying to find someone
who can give us solid play [at the
cornerback position]." Willingham
said.
In the end. the momentum

turnovers were too much for Stan

0-3 in the Pac-1().
"Anytime you lose, it eats at your

Quarterback Todd Husak had a stellar day for the Cardinal, but still
could not give Stanford its first conference victory of the season.
The Stanford football team (1-5,
0-3 Pacific 10 Conference) finally
found an opponent it could physi
cally contend with in the Oregon
State Beavers (4-2, 1-2).
Unfortunately, mental mistakes
and special teams blunders extend
ed the Cardinal's three-game losing
streak, giving the Beavers their first
win at Stanford stadium since 1%8,
with a final score of 30-23.
The game started in a fashion
eerily similar to Stanford's last two
losses at Oregon and Notre Dame.
Oregon won the toss and the ball,
and promptly marched down the
field on the strength of quarterback
Terrance Bryant's arm. Unlike dur
ing the games against Oregon and
Notre Dame, however, the much
maligned Stanford defense stood up
near their own goal line and man
aged to keep the Beavers out of the
end zone. Safety Aaron Focht de
flected a Bryant pass intended for
wideout Greg Ainsworth on third
and six. bringing out the field goal
unit of Oregon State. Jose Cortez
gave Oregon State the lead with a
42-yard field goal.
Back from an ankle injury suf
fered during the game against Ari

zona, Stanford flanker Troy Walters
made his presence known right
away with two receptions on the en
suing Cardinal drive for 40 yards, 14
of them coming on a fantastic diving
catch on a deep crossing pattern
near the Oregon State sideline.
Ouarterback Todd Husak then
found wideout Deßonnie Pitts in
the end zone for the lead.
Defensive end Willie Howard
came back strong, after leaving the
game briefly, and managed to snuff
an Oregon State drive at the Stan
ford 25-yard line when he reached
through the Beaver line to block
Jose Cortex's second field goal at
tempt.
Stanford blew a chance to add
another touchdown after holding
was called against the Beaver sec
ondary on its own one-yard line.
Sophomore Kandv Fasani en
tered the game to run the goal-line
offense, but fumbled the snap and
had to fall on the ball, bringing up
second and goal. Rolling out right,
Fasani found Russell Stewart wide
open in the end zone, but the junior
tight end dropped the lob pass.
Husak reentered the game, but was
forced to throw the ball away under
a heavy Beaver rush, and Kevin
Miller kicked the 20-yard field goal
to give the Cardinal a 10-3 lead.

Halfway through the second
quarter, Husak broke the NCAA
record for consecutive passes at
tempted without an interception
thrown, only to see the streak
snapped when Oregon State corner
back Andre Holland picked off a
Husak lob in the end zone.
"I had Troy on a post." Husak

said. "The safety had come up and I
thought I had Troy. Unfortunately,
I didn't see the backside safety. That
was a bad read by me."
Alter Oregon State went three
and out, Stanford wideouts Dave
Davis and Pitts combined for the
play of the game. Husak dropped
buck and managed to get rid of the
ball while getting crunched by
Beaver nose guard Shawn Battle,
throwing a laser beam to Pitts on an
out pattern. The junior flanker,
however, couldn't hang on and bob
bled the ball three times into the
hands of a waiting Davis. He
streaked to the Oregon State eight
yard line before being forced out of
bounds setting up a Kevin Miller
field goal attempt.
"I had a deep hook. Ronnie had
an over." Davis said. "I saw [Husak]
throw the ball, [and] saw it juggled.
Ronnie made a great play tipping it
to me."
However, that's when Stanford's
special teams woes came to the fore
front. Miller's 24-yard field goal was
blocked and recovered by the
Beavers, and the Cardinal came
away empty-handed after a solid
drive that started with good field po
sition.
"I think it might have just been a
low kick." Willingham said.
As bad as the blocked kick was, it
was insignificant compared with
what was to come. Oregon State
marched down the field in seven
plays for a Simonton touchdown.
On the ensuing kickoff, sopho
more running back Coy Wire never
got possession of the ball as it
bounced off his chest and dribbled
towards the onrushing Beavers.

Davis, the far side return man, tried
to scoop the ball up but couldn't get
a handle on it as he, the ball and
Oregon State's coverage team all ar
rived simultaneously at the Stanford
goal line in a chaotic collision.
After a fierce battle for the ball
under a pile of red and black jerseys,
Beaver linebacker Brandon Boice
came away with the ball and six
points for a 20-10 Oregon State lead.
"You just hate the fact that you
let that [fumble] decide the game,"
Willingham said. "We shot our
selves in the foot and that is disap
pointing."
To its credit, Stanford came back
and executed a perfect two-minute
drill to end the first half. Walters
hauled in a Husak lob at the Oregon
State one-yard line, somehow
squirming between two significantly
taller defenders for 38 yards to set
up a touchdown blast by fullback
Maxwell Stevenson. Stevenson was
injured on the play, however, leav
ing Oregon State with a 20-17 lead at
the half.
In the second half, the Cardinal
continued to pass almost at will
against the Beaver secondary, but
special teams miscues cost it the
game.
With the score tied at 23-23,
halfway through the fourth quarter,
Walters fumbled a punt at the Stan
ford 30-yard line and the Beavers re
covered and quickly converted the
gift into a Simonton touchdown.
Stanford got a chance to tie the
score once more, but Husak was
picked off in the end zone by nickel
back Armon Hatcher. Oregon State
ran out the clock for a 30-23 win.
The loss stings Cardinal fans per
haps even more than the last two
routs at Oregon and Notre Dame.
Stanford finally got a team it could
contend with, but mistakes and spe
cial teams disasters spoiled the po
tential homecoming victory.
In the game, however, Husak
broke the Stanford record for pass
ing yards in a single game, surpass
ing Steve Dils mark of 430 by 20
yards.
"I'm here to win." Husak said. "If
I had gone two for 10 for five yards,
and we win, I'd be happier then I am
now. Sure, it's nice to have [the
record), but I'd rather win."
