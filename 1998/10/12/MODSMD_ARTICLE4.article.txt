# Business School falls in rankings

### Danielle Chang 
In Business Week magazine's bi
annual ranking of the best business
schools released Thursday, the
Graduate School of Business
dropped two spots to ninth place.
Part of the reason the business
school didn't rank as well in the
Business Week report is the low
score it received from students on
core course teaching, course inte
gration and responsiveness.
" The quality of core [courses] is
uneven," said Katik Ramakrishnan,
a second year business student. He
added that the business school has
become more responsive to student
concern within the last year, but still
needs more improvement.
Another reason for Stanford's
No. 9 ranking is its students' tenden
cy to reject offers from large corpo
rations in favor of small startups and
entrepreneurial firms in Silicon Val
ley.
According Graduate School of
Business Dean Michael Spence,
Business Week's rankings are based
largely on corporate recruiters' suc
cess in recruiting at the surveyed
schools. Given Stanford students'
career inclinations, "it is inevitable
that we will not be at the top," said
Spence.
Compared to Spence's diplomat
ic reply, interviewed students ob
jected to this skew of recruiters' rat
ings more explicitly. According to
Ramakrishnan and first-year busi
ness student Sandeep Aneja, the re
cruiters are frustrated because they

can't hire many Stanford students.
Even Goldman Sachs, regarded
by Business Week as one of the most
selective firms, has trouble recruit
ing Stanford MBAs. According to
the magazine, Goldman Sachs got
acceptance from only 40 percent of
its Stanford offers, a relatively small
number compared to its 80 percent
success rate at other top schools.
Some students questioned the
accuracy of the rankings system. "I
don't believe [the survey] accurately
reflects the reputation and quality of
a school," said first-year business
student Paige Chen. "But. unfortu
nately, it does effect [opinions of]
the people who are farther away
from the school."
