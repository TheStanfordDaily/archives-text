# Business School falls in rankings
## 
### Danielle Chang 
In Business Week magazine's bi
annual ranking of the best business
schools released Thursday, the
Graduate School of Business
dropped two spots to ninth place.
Part of the reason the business
school didn't rank as well in the
Business Week report is the low
score it received from students on
core course teaching, course inte
gration and responsiveness.
" The quality of core [courses] is
uneven," said Katik Ramakrishnan,
a second year business student. He
added that the business school has
become more responsive to student
concern within the last year, but still
needs more improvement.
Another reason for Stanford's
No. 9 ranking is its students' tenden
cy to reject offers from large corpo
rations in favor of small startups and
entrepreneurial firms in Silicon Val
ley.
According Graduate School of
Business Dean Michael Spence,
Business Week's rankings are based
largely on corporate recruiters' suc
cess in recruiting at the surveyed
schools. Given Stanford students'
career inclinations, "it is inevitable
that we will not be at the top," said
Spence.
Compared to Spence's diplomat
ic reply, interviewed students ob
jected to this skew of recruiters' rat
ings more explicitly. According to
Ramakrishnan and first-year busi
ness student Sandeep Aneja, the re
cruiters are frustrated because they

can't hire many Stanford students.
Even Goldman Sachs, regarded
by Business Week as one of the most
selective firms, has trouble recruit
ing Stanford MBAs. According to
the magazine, Goldman Sachs got
acceptance from only 40 percent of
its Stanford offers, a relatively small
number compared to its 80 percent
success rate at other top schools.
Some students questioned the
accuracy of the rankings system. "I
don't believe [the survey] accurately
reflects the reputation and quality of
a school," said first-year business
student Paige Chen. "But. unfortu
nately, it does effect [opinions of]
the people who are farther away
from the school."
In other surveys, the GSB con-

sistently ranks higher than it did in
the Business Week rankings. For
example, the U.S. News and World
Report's rankings earlier this year
put the GSB in the number one
spot, tied with Harvard Business
School.
Business Week took a "cus
tomer's point of view" approach in
conducting its survey. It asked MBA
graduates to rate their schools in
areas of teaching quality, program
content and career placement. The
recruiters were asked to assess the
graduates' skills and their perfor
mance in the companies.
Questionnaires were sent to
9,568 graduating MBAs at 61

schools and 350 companies with ac
tive recruitment. The results were
compiled from the 6.020 students
and 259 companies that responded.
This year's survey is the largest ever
to be conducted. Business Week
said in a press release.
When asked how rankings influ
enced their decision on which school
to attend, most interviewed business
students admitted that they looked
at the rankings, but didn't let them
affect their decisions. "I looked at
it," said second-year business stu
dent Dirk Pawmowski, "but I didn't
take it that seriously."
For some, the decision is clear
and simple. "There are two business
schools in the world: Harvard and
Stanford," said Aneja. "It doesn t
matter how the rankings end up."
Rampkrishnan added: "It sounds

snobbish, but it's true."
Echoing the students' comments,
Spence cited Harvard as Stanford's
main competitor in admissions. As
far as the rankings' effect on admis
sions, Spence said the rankings
"over the last decade have had no ef
fect on admissions results at all that
we detect."
In fact, in both the survey and in
terviews with business students, the
Business School was praised for its
career placement, location in Sili
con Valley, generalized curriculum
and cooperative learning environ
ment.
Despite the school's No. 9 rank
ing in Business Week, Spence said
that the Business School currently
has no plan to do things "that are
solely designed to get high rankings
in any particular survey."
