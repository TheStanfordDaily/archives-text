Frances Beedy, Class of '37, remembers arriving at
Stanford as a member of the first class in which women
were granted open admission to the University. Prior to
1933, admission to females was limited to S(H).
"The atmosphere was so exciting and there was such a
sense of freedom," Beedy recalled.
Beedy, a psychology major, also fondly remembers her
freshman dorm, Roble Hall, and going to "Jolly Ups,"
which were popular dances held for women.
Beedy and other members of the "Wonder Class"
were reunited for Reunion Homecoming Weekend this
past weekend. The oldest reunion class of the weekend,
the Class of 1937 may arguably have been the most spirit
ed.
Class Secretary Dick Bullis recalls sleeping out on
Lake Lagunita before the Big Game Bonfire to defend
the now-extinct traditional event from premature lighting
by a certain rival from across the Bay. Bullis also remem
bers a friendly and sociable campus atmosphere in which
everyone said "Hello," regardless if one knew the other
person or not.
"My friends and I would compete to see how many
people we could say 'Hello' to in one day," said Bullis.
To relieve the weekday stress, students would head to
the Stanford Theater for a movie or to San Francisco for
an evening of dancing with friends.
Gordon Frost, Class of '38, served as editor of the Stan
ford Daily in 1937 and reported on campus issues for the
student paper. Frost remembers covering a student cam
paign to open the library on Sundays. Green Library was
eventually opened to students on Sunday evenings.
Frost was nearly expelled from the University when he
and another member of the Daily staff published the re
sults of a survey on the sexual experiences of female Stan
ford students.
"Today," Frost said, "an article like that would be no
big deal, but back then it was a huge controversy."
Members of the Class of 1937 have a firm appreciation
