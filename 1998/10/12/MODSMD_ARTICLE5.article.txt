# Homecoming Weekend a success
## Class of 1937 returnees remember smaller, friendlier campus 
### Julia Beeson Contributing writer 
Frances Beedy, Class of '37, remembers arriving at
Stanford as a member of the first class in which women
were granted open admission to the University. Prior to
1933, admission to females was limited to S(H).
"The atmosphere was so exciting and there was such a
sense of freedom," Beedy recalled.
Beedy, a psychology major, also fondly remembers her
freshman dorm, Roble Hall, and going to "Jolly Ups,"
which were popular dances held for women.
Beedy and other members of the "Wonder Class"
were reunited for Reunion Homecoming Weekend this
past weekend. The oldest reunion class of the weekend,
the Class of 1937 may arguably have been the most spirit
ed.
Class Secretary Dick Bullis recalls sleeping out on
Lake Lagunita before the Big Game Bonfire to defend
the now-extinct traditional event from premature lighting
by a certain rival from across the Bay. Bullis also remem
bers a friendly and sociable campus atmosphere in which
everyone said "Hello," regardless if one knew the other
person or not.
"My friends and I would compete to see how many
people we could say 'Hello' to in one day," said Bullis.
To relieve the weekday stress, students would head to
the Stanford Theater for a movie or to San Francisco for
an evening of dancing with friends.
Gordon Frost, Class of '38, served as editor of the Stan
ford Daily in 1937 and reported on campus issues for the
student paper. Frost remembers covering a student cam
paign to open the library on Sundays. Green Library was
eventually opened to students on Sunday evenings.
Frost was nearly expelled from the University when he
and another member of the Daily staff published the re
sults of a survey on the sexual experiences of female Stan
ford students.
"Today," Frost said, "an article like that would be no
big deal, but back then it was a huge controversy."
Members of the Class of 1937 have a firm appreciation
of exactly how much times have
changed.
The Class of 1937 was on the
Farm when it really was a farm. The
proliferation of buildings through
out the years has made the campus
nearly unrecognizable to most
members of the class. Bullis, who
lived in Encina Hall freshman year
and the Beta Theta Pi fraternity
house for the remainder of his time
at Stanford, remembers only a small
handful of buildings surrounded by
hayfields.
"I can't believe the huge number
of buildings that have gone up —
there is no open space," Bullis said.
Bullis also remembers that one
policeman was responsible for secu

rity for the entire campus.
"Things were very simple," he
added.
It has been over 6() years since
the Class of 1937 left Stanford, but
its ties to the campus community are
stronger than ever. The class has
been dubbed the "Wonder Class"
because of its generous support of
the University.
Over Reunion Homecoming
Weekend, the class was presented
with an award for having the highest
percentage of any class that gave to
the Stanford Fund. According to
Bullis, 95 percent of the class gave
gifts to the University last year,
amounting to approximately $1.5
million.
This year, the Class of 1937 start
ed a new tradition by adopting two
Stanford "grandchildren," to help
stay in touch with life at Stanford.

Leanna Brown, a junior majoring in
Human Biology, is one of the grand
children.
"Its really fun talking to the class
members because they have so
many interesting stories about their
experiences at Stanford — stories
about parties and how much less tu
ition was back then," said Brown.
The Class of 1937 also "adopted"
an alumnus from the Class of 1930,
when he wasn't able to find any
other members from his class year at
Reunion Homecoming Weekend.
John Dayton, who is now 9() years
old, remembers going into San
Francisco with friends for"beer
busts" at speakeasies when Prohibi
tion was still in effect. The former
chemistry student also recalls fresh
man / sophomore mud fights in
Lake Lagunita and the traditional
Big Game festivities.
