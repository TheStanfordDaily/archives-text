# Swing was the thing for alums and students

As the vocalist soulfully crooned at the
'All Right Now" Student-Alumni Swing
Dance on Saturday evening, Stanford stu
dents and alumni alike were carried back into
the glamorous days of Benny Goodman, '40s
big bands and, of course, lots and lots of
swing.
The evening commenced at 9 p.m. with an
hour-long lesson from professional swing
dancer Johannes Kratz, Class of '98.

After some initial hesitancy, the Main
Quad soon transformed into a mishmash of
high-flying arms and legs. Groves of giggling
undergraduates, many swinging for the first
time, danced and laughed alongside their
long-experienced alumni counterparts, as
each attempted to either master or recall
their Charleston and foxtrot moves.
Participants ran the gamut from animated
freshmen such as Christina Anagick and her

friend Liz Forwand, who merely re
membered "having learned a few
swing steps in fourth grade," to well
seasoned hoppers such as Elaine
Farrar and Marylou Andreatta Zep
penfeld. Class of '48. Farrar and
Zeppenfeld recount that swing was
the thing in their post-war Universi
ty days, and relished the moment as
they soaked in the nostalgic atmos
phere and tunes of the night.
The two alumnae "saw their
younger selves in the current Stan
ford students," said Farrar, and
agreed that young people across the
generations remain the same in their
common penchant for "friends, fun
and dancing."
Saturday's event was the brain
child of Brooke Eittreim and Su/.ie

Mendoza, director and assistant di
rector of student development in the
Development Office, Corky Gains
ford, coordinator of alumni pro
grams at the Alumni Association,
and senior Mike Martinez.
The Student-Alumni Swing
Dance represents the first event of
its scale and kind to take place dur
ing Reunion Homecoming Week
end.
In the words of Martinez, the
four organizers envisioned this
year's swing dance as the first of a
"series of interactive activities
planned for current students to meet
Stanford alumni," and work towards
their shared vision of increasing
"overall class unity and identity that
students have with Stanford Univer
sity."
The Bay Area's Adrian Davis
Swing Orchestra provided the
dancers with two hours of live music.

Founded in 1971, the orchestra con
sists of 16 instrumentalists and a vo
calist, including three founding
members: trombone player Joe
Doll, drummer Bill McAllister, and
saxophone player Art Gallegos.
According to Adrian Davis, who
took over the leadership of the or
chestra after its original founder re
tired, the group mainly performs
their repertoire of "roughly 400 to
500 swing songs" at hotels, country
clubs and weddings.
Swing music has become such an
integral part of these musicians' lives
that many cannot even identify what
captivates them the most about
swing. Trumpet player Jack Her
schkorn. for example, whose love af
fair with swing took root some 63
years ago, only knows that he
"hasn't been able to get enough of
it" since his first guitar lesson from
Alan Reuss years ago.
