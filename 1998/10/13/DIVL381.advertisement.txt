SCA Consulting L.L.C
Since our founding in 1984, SCA
Consulting has specialized in helping
companies create shareholder value by
designing value management,
performance measurement and reward
programs which focus managers on
achieving business objectives. We
understand clients' business strategies
and identify the behaviors that they
need to reinforce; we then create highly
customized value management,
performance measurement and reward
programs which signal the performance
and behavior desired. Our perspective
is unique because it integrates
strategic, financial, organizational and
compensation expertise.
