### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
It is the best of times and it is the worst of
times for black America, Henry Louis Gates,
Jr. told a packed Kresge auditorium last night
in a lecture titled "Race and Class/Race in
Class."
Gates, theW.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the

Humanities at Harvard University, said "We
are a nation within a nation."
Although the black middle class has
quadrupled since 1 968, 45 percent of all black
children live at or below the poverty line. Gates
said. He added that the ratio of the number of
young black men in prison to the number in col-

lege is 99 to 1.
"[Dr. Martin Luther] King did not
die for half of us to make it, half to
perish," Gates said.
Aecording to Gates, successful
blacks must stop feeling the "guilt of
the survivors" and should work to
help those left in despair.
Another important step is to dis
pel the notion in some inner city
youth circles that succeeding is a sign
of "whiteness."
"We don't have to fail to stay
black," Gates said.
"We have never been members of
one socioeconomic class. The best
we can strive for is for class differen
tials to cease their lop-sided ratios...
[due to] the pernicious [effects] of
racism." Gates said.
"Race differences and class differ
entials have been ground together in
a crucible... of squalor," he said.
Gates explained the convergence
of race and poverty among blacks as
both systemic and behavioral. He
also discussed solutions to the alarm
ing class schism in black America.
Black Americans must face the
"twin realities of white racism and
our own failure to take the initiative
to break the cycle of poverty. What is
at stake is the survival of our coun
try," he said.
"We have to demand a structural
change ... the Marshall Plan for
cities," Gates said. As a nation, we
must train the urban poor for occu
pations relevant to the 21st century's
"global economy."
Gates said that although he favors
tax breaks to encourage investment,
he also knows that American cities
will not become "oases" of prosperi
ty overnight because of investment.
Gates also suggested that schools
"teach the story of America as a plur
al nation, not Pilgrim triumphalism."
"We should institutionalize
sophomore and junior year intern
ships ... through the Children's De
fense Fund [and other groups] ...
and combat teenage pregnancy," he
said.

What is needed is a "rigorous
multiculturalism" which "rejects dif
ference over commonality.
"A rigorous multiculturalism
does not promote the proliferation of
ethnic identity conflicts," Gates said.
"There are no short cuts to ethnic
harmony. Those who look to multi
culturalism as a quick fix to expen
sive problems are bound to be disap
pointed," he said.
The task for Americans in the 21 st
century is to transform liberalism
from a silent aversion to judgment to
an active instrument of morality.
"Deference to the autonomy of
beliefs [leads to] moral isolation. We
need a liberalism in this country ...
possessed of clarity as well as com
passion, unafraid to assert itself, its
tenets, its hard-won moral knowl
edge," he said.
"We must learn how to live with
out the age-old deleterious dream of
purity. We must find comfort... and
solace in the rough cultural mix" that
reflects American pluralism.
Gates advocated multicultural
ism not as an absolute truth, but as a
fitting solution to the problem of eth
nic fragmentation.
"Like democracy, multicultural
ism enjoys a decided edge over the
other alternatives," Gates said.
Gates decried what he called the
ethnicization of ideology. By associ
ating particular ideologies with par
ticular ethnic groups, Gates said,
people such as right-wing former
Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
have fueled the fragmentation of the
American polity.
"I believe in civic humanism. Plu
ralism is not about policing bound
aries. Pluralism is about breaking
those boundaries down, [and ac
knowledging] the fluid and interac
tive nature of all of our identities."
Despite the cultural benefits of
distinct ethnic identities. Gates ex
horted all Americans to recognize
the "common humanity" and shared
values of liberty, democracy and jus
tice as the central features of Ameri
can pluralism.
In the words of King, Gates said,
"None of us is free until each of us is
free."
