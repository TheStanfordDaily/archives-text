## Gay student dies of smashed skull after brutal attack 
### 
LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) — A gay col
lege student who was lured from a campus
hangout, beaten and lashed to a split-rail
fence died Monday, and the two young
men arrested in the attack now face mur
der charges that could bring the death
penalty.
Matthew Shepard, 21. died at Poudre
Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo.,
while on life support. His skull was so
badly smashed that doctors could not per
form surgery, hospital president Rulon
Stacey said.
The University of Wyoming student
had been in a coma since bicyclists found
him in near-freezing temperatures
Wednesday evening. They at first mistook
him for a scarecrow.
The attack has spurred calls nationwide
for hate-crimes legislation protecting gays.
President Clinton pressed Congress to
expand the federal hate-crimes law to
cover offenses based 011 disability or sexu
al orientation.
"Americans will once again search their
hearts and do what they can to reduce
their own fear and anxiety and anger at
people who are different," Clinton said.
"And I hope that Congress will pass the

hate-crime legislation."
Russell Arthur Henderson, 21. and
Aaron James McKinney, 22, were origi
nally charged with attempted murder, kid
napping and aggravated robbery, and
jailed on $ 1 (K).(MK) bail each.
Police said that with Shepard's death,
the charges against them will be upgraded
to first-degree murder, which carries a
possible death sentence.
Their girlfriends — Chastity Vera
Pasley. 20. and Kristen Leann Price. 18 —
were charged with being accessories after
the fact. Police said the women helped
dump bloody clothing and initially lied
about their whereabouts.
Police said that robbery was the main
motive but that Shepard apparently was
chosen in part because he was gay. The 5-
foot-2, 105-pound Shepard had been beat
en twice in recent months, attacks he
attributed to his homosexuality.
Of the 41 states that have hate-crime
laws, 21 states specifically cover offenses
motivated by the victim's sexual orienta
tion. Efforts to pass a hate-crime law in
Wyoming have failed several times.
On Monday, the giant rainbow flag that
symbolizes the gay movement was low

ered to half staff in San Francisco's Castro
District. College students rallied in down
town Denver to remember Shepard and
denounce violence. And in Laramie,
where the long-planned Gay Awareness
Week began, some students wore yellow
and green armbands to send a message of
peace.
"To beat somebody and tie them to a
fencepost and beat them some more, obvi
ously you're trying to make a statement,"
said Erik Abbott, a 25-year-old University
of Wyoming student. "Obviously these
people felt this was the feeling of the com
munity as a whole, and it's not."
Authorities have withheld many
details in the case, and a judge is consid
ering a prosecutor's request to seal the
records.
Police said the two men lured Shepard
out of the Fireside bar late Tuesday or
early Wednesday by telling him they were
gay. The three of them got in McKinney's
truck, where the beating began, police
said.
Later, Shepard was tied up and pistol
whipped as he begged for his life, and he
was robbed of his wallet and black patent
leather shoes, police said.
