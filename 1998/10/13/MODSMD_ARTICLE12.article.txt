# FBI to create DNA evidence database
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Law
enforcement officers around the
country will be able to compare
DNA genetic evidence taken from
convicted felons and gathered in
unsolved cases after the FBI switch
es on a national computer system
Tuesday.
All 50 states will be linked to an
FBI computer here that contains
genetic profiles of 250,000 convicted
staiv 1 felons and DNA profiles taken
from evidence left at the scene of
4,600 unsolved cases, Dwight
Adams, chief of the FBI lab's scien
tific analysis section, said Mondav.

The states have collected anoth
er 350,(XK) DNA samples from con
victed felons but have yet to analyze
them and enter the genetic profiles
onto the computer database.
Although all 50 states have laws
authorizing blood sampling of some
convicted felons to obtain DNA
profiles, eight states have not begun
collecting the actual samples,
Adams said.
And while the federal govern
ment set up the national computer
system to share the records.
Congress has not passed a law
authorizing collection of DNA sam

pies from federal felons.
The DNA in the unsolved-case
database is taken from crime
scenes. DNA profiles can be
obtained from semen collected fol
lowing a rape, blood left on broken
glass during a break-in or even bits
of an assailant's skin caught under a
victim's fingernails during an
assault.
Since last December the FBI has
conducted an eight-state test of the
system and has matched DNA evi
dence from almost 200 cases to spe
cific individuals, Adams said. In the
first such success, announced in

December, a convicted felon in Illi
nois was matched to a Wisconsin
rape case.
When local police labs take evi
dence from a convicted felon or
crime scene they enter the DNA
profiles into a state computer sys
tem.
If there are no matches between
local evidence and the convieted
felon profiles, local authorities
would then try to match their evi
dence with the profiles in the
unsolved cases. This could link pre
viously unrelated crimes and might
help investigators find a culprit.
