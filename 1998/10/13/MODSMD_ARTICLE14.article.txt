# Republicans face increasing disapproval

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
Three weeks before midterm elec
tions, Americans disapprove by
almost a 2-to-l margin of the way
Republicans are investigating
President Clinton's conduct,
according to a poll released Mon
day. And a growing number say
they trust Clinton more than the
Republicans to deal with the
nation's problems.
Democratic politicians, sensing
a shift in public sentiment after two
gloomy months, say they have
renewed hopes about the Nov. 3
congressional elections.
"Thanks to the Republicans, it's
a lot easier being a Democratic can
didate now than it was a month
ago," said Democratic pollster
Geoff Garin, contending the
impeachment investigation has
been perceived as partisan.
But Republican politicians say
they are content with their current
approach: steadily pressing ahead
with the impeachment inquiry,
which appeals to their conservative
voter base, while candidates appeal
to swing voters in each district by
talking about issues, not impeach
ment.
"My sense of the polling data is
that the more knowledgeable peo
ple are about the (investigation's!
details, the more likely they are to
vote Republican," said Rep. John
Linder of Georgia, chairman of the

Republican National Congression
al Committee.
The Washington Post poll
released Monday indicates more
than half of registered voters, 51
percent, say they would vote for a
Democrat in November's congres
sional elections and 42 percent say
they would support a Republican.
The race among likely voters
remains close, according to the poll,
but Post pollster Richard Morin
says Democrats have also taken a
slight edge among likely voters in
the last two weeks.
Republicans have had an advan
tage among likely voters in polls
over recent months, and a
Newsweek poll released over the
weekend indicated GOP candi
dates have kept that edge.
Clinton's standing in the polls
has improved since early Septem
ber with the release of a report
from Independent Counsel Ken
neth Starr. Two-thirds of those
polled by the Post. 67 percent, said
they approve of the job the presi
dent is doing, up from 54 percent in
early September.
An increasing number of people
trust the president more than
Republicans to cope with Ameri
ea's problems. The margin was 52
34. In early September, 43 percent
expressed more trust in Clinton to
deal with the nation's problems; 37
percent trusted Republicans more.
