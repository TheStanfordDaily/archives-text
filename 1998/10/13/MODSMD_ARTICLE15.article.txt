# Women fight for re-election
## Sophomore slump 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
(AP) — Female outrage at the all
male Senate Judiciary Committee's
handling of the Clarence Thomas
sexual harassment controversy
helped propel three women to the
Senate. But now Barbara Boxer,
Carol Moseley-Braun and Patty
Murray ate struggling for second
terms.
All three were elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1992. the Year of the
Woman. All are liberal Democrats.
And all are in the political fights of
their lives. The so-called Year of the
Woman has been replaced in 1998
by the Year of One Woman —
Monica Lewinsky.
And yet. there's no common
thread to tie the three together. The
impact of the scandal surrounding
President Clinton and Ms. Lewin
sky is an imponderable. But there is
no question that Democratic bread
and-butter issues such as health
care, education, and abortion rights
have been overshadowed by the
scandal.
" I his campaign in many ways is
a very surreal campaign. Nobody,
or almost nobody, is focusing on the
issues ... so I've got to do it
myself.'' Boxer complained recent
ly*
Boxer. Moseley Braun and Mur
ray all are vulnerable. This likely is
due in part to the possibility the
Democratic vote may be depressed
because of the sex and coverup
scandal. But it may be because of
the upset nature of the women's vic
tories.
In the state of Washington. Mur
ray. who campaigned as a "mom in
tennis shoes." has had lackluster job
ratings since her election.
She faces a conservative Repub
lican, Rep. Linda Smith, who has
never lost an election and has a
35,(KK) strong volunteer army. Hie
latest poll shows Murray leading
narrowly, but a fifth of the vote
remains undecided.
Like Boxer. Murray has been
derided for her relative silence on
Clinton's affair with the former

White House intern. "She put on a
pair of Hush Puppies when she took
off her tennis shoes," Smith said.
In Illinois. Moseley-Braun, down
10 points in the latest polls, has
been hammered with ethics prob
lems ranging from allegations of
misusing campaign funds, to criti
cism of a trip to Nigeria to visit the
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. who
died this year. She was never con
victed of any wrongdoing. On Sun
day. the Chicago Tribune endorsed
her Republican opponent. State
Sen. Peter Fizgerald.
In California, Boxer is in a ne£k
and-neck race with Matt Fong? a
Republican perhaps best known for
his legendary mother. Democrat
March Fong Eu. who was Califor
nia's top elections officer for two
decades.
The latest Field Poll showed
Fong leading 48 percent to 44 per
cent with <S percent undecided and a
margin of error of four percentage
points.
To win. Boxer. Murray and
Moseley-Braun must galvanize
their core supporters, the loyal
Democrats and Republican women
who helped put them over the top
in 1992.
The three benefited from the
support of voters infuriated by
hearings the male-dominated Judi
ciary Committee conducted in 1991
into allegations that Thomas
repeatedly used suggestive lan
guage toward Anita Hill when she
worked for him.
Thomas subsequently was nar
rowly confirmed for a seat on the
Supreme ( ourt.
Later. Boxer took a lead role in
denouncing then-Sen. Bob Pack
wood. R-Ore., who was forced to
resign over allegations of sexual
misconduct.
In 1992. a record number of
women were elected to Congress
and state Legislatures that year,
many inspired to run by the allega
tions that Hill, an Oklahoma law
professor, leveled against Thomas.
In 1998. that momentum is gone.
