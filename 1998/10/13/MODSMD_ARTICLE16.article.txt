Nobel awarded for nitric oxide
Three Americans won the Nobel Prize in
medicine Monday for discovering that the body uses
nitric oxide gas to make blood vessels relax and
widen — a finding that helped lead to Viagra and
could also pay off in treatments for heart disease.
The prize, announced in Sweden, went to Robert
F. Furchgott. Louis J. Ignarro and Dr. Ferid Murad.
Furchgott, 82. is a pharmacologist at the State Uni
versity of New York Health Science Center at
Brooklyn; Ignarro. 57, is at the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles; and Murad. 62. is at the Uni
versity of Texas Medical School in Houston. They
will split the $978,000 prize.
Cells make nitric oxide, which is also an air pol
lutant in auto exhaust. It is different from nitrous

oxide, better known as laughing gas. The researchers
discovered that the body's own nitric oxide acts as a
signal, telling blood vessels to dilate. That, in turn,
lowers blood pressure.
"Now. finally this discovery can be put to use in
treatment of numerous pathologies," said Ignarro,
who was reached in Naples, Italy. "The future of
pharmacology is in the creation of a superaspirin
that will be fundamental in the prevention of heart
attacks, of cardiovascular disease, of arteriosclero
sis."
The gas makes blood vessels dilate by relaxing the
vessels' smooth muscles. It can help trigger erection
of the penis the same way, because the relaxation
lets blood flow in. Viagra was designed to work by
blocking an enzyme that interferes with nitric oxide's
effect.

Results of studies on nitric oxide max pay oft in
new treatments for atherosclerosis, septic shock and
cancer.
Yeltsin's leadership questioned in
light of poor health
ALMA TY. Ka/akstan (AP) — Russian President
Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on
Monday due to a respiratory infection, reviving
questions about his health and ability to lead a coun
try faced with economic crisis and NATO threats
against its Yugoslav allies.
Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall
airstrikes in Kosovo. Moscow's N I V station said it
was a crucial time for Russia, when "presidential

decisions" ;ire needed.
I here was no indication that Yeltsin's illness
would sideline him for any length of time, and aides
said the president would maintain his schedule for
the rest of the week.
Hut after a series of health problems in recent
years, including heart bypass surgery in IW6. every
new ailment unleashes a flurry ol speculation about
the 67-vear old president's ability to function.
Yeltsin's opponents have long charged that his
overall condition has deteriorated to the point that
he can no longer work lull-time. Communist leader
(iennady Zyuganov renewed the call Monday for
the president's resignation.
The president insists he has no major health prob
lems and will serve out the remaining two years of
his term.
