Wc need to understand why
the humanities are ailing
before relying on a quick fix

INITIATED LAST YEAR, the Stan
ford Presidential Lectures and Sym
posia in the I iumanitics and Arts aim to
bring the most remarkable artists and schol
ars to Stanford through a series of lectures
and panel discussions.
Funded by the Office of the President,
the program's speakers this year include
such renowned scholars as Henry Louis
dates, Jr.. who spoke last night. This pro
gram undoubtedly provides students with
great opportunities to hear world-class
speakers, but we need to ask which prob
lems or issues within the humanities are the
intended target of this effort.
President Casper has mentioned that
one motivation for the program is his own
belief that the humanities must be further
strengthened. I le hints at a concern among
many students that the humanities at Stan
ford are suffering while engineering and the
sciences are receiving greater support.
A more extreme version of this view
point is presented by French and Italian
Prof. I lans (iumbreeht, director of the lec
tures and symposia program. He has writ
ten that "nobody today can come up with a
convincing answer to the question
why... the Humanities and Arts should
continue as a quantitatively and financially
significant component of Higher Educa
tion."
We wonder if the University might be
trying to devise a solution to a major prob
lem without trulv understanding what the

problem is. To spark sustained interest in
the humanities among students, more is
needed than a series of lecturers.
A sincere effort to create a strong
humanities culture both inside and outside
of class would be a far better contribution,
lkit this is apparently not a top priority of
the program. Instead, as Prof. Gumbrecht
described, this program is intended to give
Stanford a "high visibility nationally, show
ing a real commitment by the administra
tion to the humanities."
Although building a stronger national
reputation for Stanford is important, this
focus seems to be in the wrong direction.
Informing students about the humanities or
challenging students' interests in the
diverse fields spanning the humanities
would seem to be a more appropriate goal.
Encouragement and excitement within the
arts and humanities cannot be produced by
presenting a lecture or two each quarter.
I his is not to suggest that the program is
ill-suited solely because it will have no
impact on increasing the number of human
ities majors at Stanford. Rather, it is the
establishment and facilitation of a campus
wide, interdisciplinary dialogue about the
humanities that the administration and fac
ulty should actively pursue.
Without clearly addressing any specific
student issues in humanities, the Presiden
tial Lectures and Symposia seem well
intentioned but misguided in specific aims,
especially if those aims include building a
lively humanities community.
Stanford needs to include this key com
munity aspect alongside such concerns as a
national reputation in the humanities and
arts. If the problem cannot be clearly
defined, no effective solution will be
devised.
