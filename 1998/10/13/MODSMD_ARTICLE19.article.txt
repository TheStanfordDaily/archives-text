## Karma in the Sixth Man line 
### 
"NOT AGAIN." IT was
a sight to make Herbert
Hoover roll over in his
grave. Shanties, tents and
crowds all camped outside
Maples Pavilion. But this
was no Bonus Army. This
was no protest. Why were
those people even there?

The quick response is these students
wanted to partake in an incredible Stanford
tradition. We're talking the chance to be a
part of the elite men's basketball team.
We're talking the Sixth Man Club.
But this doesn't answer why they got
there over a week ago. Any loyal basketball
fan knows that the sign-ups originally
weren't until this Friday. An early e-mail
sent by Sixth Man "Czar" Jamie Zaninovich
suggested waiting at least one night — not
one week — to get tickets. In fact, the sleep
out began so early that the system was
forced to change, ending the first Shan
tyville in the Bay Area since Cal relocated
its think tank.
So why did people show up so early? The
answer lies among sleeping bags, tents,
radios, televisions, one projector screen
(talk about resourceful), 23 couches and a
few hundred students. The answer is one
fraternity. But not just any fraternity. We're
talking about Kappa Sigma, better known
around campus as the Schmegs.
These fun-loving individuals, for whatev
er reason, felt compelled to be first in line.
To wait not one, not two, but three weeks,
and this probably included an in-house
sleep out to decide who would get to sleep

out. See, the first tent set off a panic. Once
people saw the line forming — although a
good week premature — they had to follow
suit. There was no choice. The game was on.
For those of you in the social sciences, it
was a basic prisoner's dilemma. The
Schmegs got there early, and then we were
their prisoners. It's like a game of chicken.
You're supposed to wait until the last
minute to jump out. But the Schmegs
jumped ship before the engine even started.
It was in everyone's best interest to wait as
long as possible before starting the line. But
no. Not for the Schmegs.
However, can we really blame them?
Apparently the Schmegs love waiting for
things. I hear a group is going this weekend
to sleep out for the dropping of the millen
nium ball in Times Square. The Schmegs
sleep out for Stanford football games. In
fact, the Schmegs sleep out for everything.
They slept out for the free Digital Under
ground show. They even camped for days in
White Plaza to get that free vegan lunch.
Reserved airline tickets? There are the
Schmegs, five days early.
But now Shantyville has been disbanded.
And this is a good thing. It was beginning to
look like a scene from the movie "Alive."
Sleeping bags everywhere. No cannibals,
but it was only Sunday. And people were
already losing it. My group was thinking
about hiring some communication majors
to hold our spots in line. I mean hey. they
might as well be doing nothing there as
opposed to doing nothing somewhere else.
We'd bring them food and beer and, of
course, monetary compensation. But we

worried that one would get drunk and wan
der off. And why was this even an issue?
Simply because we had to wait for so long.
Thanks, Schmegs.
Now don't get me wrong: The Schmegs
are nice guys. They just didn't think too
much. They didn't realize their actions have
consequences. And certain people have
benefited from the Schmegs' early move.
The University, noting the success of the
"Shantyville / tent Camp." has a new place
to house students drawing below 3,(XX).
("Where did you draw?" "Maples, left
tree." "Oh, that sucks. I got right bollard
last year.")
Is there any justice? The new system dis
tributes tickets equally among all groups in
line. It ignores the fact that a group was,
say, first. But the new system does much
more than that. The new system screws the
instigators. The new system screws the
Schmegs. Can you say "karma"? Kaaarr
rmmmaaa.
In any case, the next time you're waiting
in line at the post office and forget your
copy of "War and Peace," think about the
Schmegs. And think about how you're wait
ing. And then irrationally connect the two.
Why not? After all, it's over now — tickets
will be distributed this Friday. The
Schmegs, of course, will try to stay, waiting
anxiously for next year's season tickets.
That is. at least until Jamie "Hoover" Zani
novich firebombs their tent.
