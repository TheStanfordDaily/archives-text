In developing Afro-American Studies as a
central program in the School of Humanities
and Sciences at Harvard University, Henry
Louis Gates, Jr., strives to balance theory and
practice.
Gates, who has taught at Harvard for
eight years, currently serves as both the Chair
of the Afro-American Studies Department
and the head of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute.
In an interview yesterday. Gates ex
pressed hope that Stanford will develop a
center for Afro-American Studies as part of
a broader, nationwide effort to institutional

ize new disciplines such as Afro-American
Studies and Asian-American Studies.
"I have always admired Stanford. [There
are] prospects for a great Afro-American
Studies center here. We need a [top] center
on the West Coast, and I think it should be at
Stanford," he said.
Gates emphasized establishing forums for
Afro-American scholarship over diverting
energy to distracting theoretical debates.
"I advise my students that theories are
tools and tools only. If you can't explain it to
your mom and dad, what good is it?" Gates
said.
The important idea to remember
is to "learn to use [theories] without
being colonized by them," he said.
A variety of views, from Marxism
to post-structuralism, are useful.
Gates said.
"The most difficult thing is to
come up with a critical approach that
is your own. one that is idiosyncratic.
Now 1 just try to write clearly and
eonipellingly. [The key is] not to be a
jargon machine," he said.
Gates relayed an anecdote illus
trating the consequences of over
emphasizing theory and jargon.
At Howard University in 1976,
Gates gave a talk titled, "Binary Op
posit ions in Chapter One of
Fredrick Douglass' Narrative".
After polite applause. Gates
opened the floor up to questions.
One man asked, "What I really want
to know is, was Booker T. Washing
ton an I Jncle Tom?"
Gates explained that, like that
man in the audience, people want to
know, " 'What does that have to do
with me being black?' "
Gates also said that although he
does not agree with Washington's
ideology about race, he admires
Washington's long-term strategies
and commitment to building institu
tions.
Both Du Bois' idealism and
Washington's pragmatism are nec
essary to ensure the discipline's
"lasting presence at a place like Har
vard or a place like Stanford," he
said.
Gates attributed the success of

Harvard's Afro-American Studies
Department to institutional support.
"Harvard has decided to have a
strong center. The administration
wanted us to succeed; we have the
wind at our back," said Gates.
Gates said he hangs pictures of
his predecessors on the walls outside
his office so that he walks by them
every day.
"[I put them up] to keep myself
humble," he said.
Gates recently completed work
on a film series titled, "Into Africa,"
due to air on BBC in January and on
PBS next September. In addition, he
finished co-editing Encarta
Africana, an encyclopedia of black
history and culture.
"Most of us don't know anything
about ancient Africa. [In the film se
ries], I examine the historical past
myself," Gates said.
The Du Bois Institute, which
Gates described as a think tank that
hosts 12 to 15 scholars per year, is
currently working on several foun
dational projects.
"We're building the discipline,
[trying to promote] things that
change the way we view the field,"
he said.
Gates was guided toward acade
mia by a nurturing family and a set of
inspirational teachers and writers.
He was born in West Virginia in
1950 and started school one year
after the desegregation of his pri
marily Italian and Irish paper mill
town.
"[Mv mother] believed in educa
tion and positive reinforcement. She
let me know she thought I was beau
tiful and brilliant," Gates said.
He credited his teachers with

supporting him throughout his edu
cation.
"Teachers were liberal toward
me," Gates said.
Although Gates entered Yale
University with the hopes of becom
ing a doctor, he had a writing
teacher, Tony Whitmore, who
sparked his interest in literature.
"(Whitmore) loved language and
literature. I was [soon] hooked on
literature, but 1 wouldn't admit it to
myself," Gates said.
Gates was also drawn to the writ
ings of James Baldwin.
"He was the first black writer 1
had read. His sentences had such
compelling cadence," Gates added.
Despite having recognized litera
ture as his academic passion. Gates
said he was "petrified to be a writer.
It's like entering the abyss. I am a
very conservative person: I try to
make very calculated moves."
However, Gates' senior adviser
at Yale, American historian John
Blum, encouraged Gates to explore
academia.
"He said I could be a scholar or a
journalist... [and that] the best writ
ers can do both," he said.
After graduating from Yale,
Gates studied English at Cambridge
University under Nigerian writer
and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka.
Gates went on to become the first
African American to obtain a doc
torate in English from Cambridge.
The intellectual climate in Eng
land was such that "the smartest
people became academics," Gates
said.
"I was so nurtured... that 1 want
ed to be a nurturer, a teacher,"
Gates said.
