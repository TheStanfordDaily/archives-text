In developing Afro-American Studies as a
central program in the School of Humanities
and Sciences at Harvard University, Henry
Louis Gates, Jr., strives to balance theory and
practice.
Gates, who has taught at Harvard for
eight years, currently serves as both the Chair
of the Afro-American Studies Department
and the head of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute.
In an interview yesterday. Gates ex
pressed hope that Stanford will develop a
center for Afro-American Studies as part of
a broader, nationwide effort to institutional

ize new disciplines such as Afro-American
Studies and Asian-American Studies.
"I have always admired Stanford. [There
are] prospects for a great Afro-American
Studies center here. We need a [top] center
on the West Coast, and I think it should be at
Stanford," he said.
Gates emphasized establishing forums for
Afro-American scholarship over diverting
energy to distracting theoretical debates.
"I advise my students that theories are
tools and tools only. If you can't explain it to
your mom and dad, what good is it?" Gates
said.
