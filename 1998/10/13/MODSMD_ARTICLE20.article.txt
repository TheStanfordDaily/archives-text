Geyser sounds sour note
I wasn't going to make Dan Geyser's
day and give him a response to his column,
hut 1 think it's simply too embarrassing not
to have a dissenting opinion on this.
I he basic take of Geyser's column is
that people at the post office are incompe
tent. slow, ugly, sleazeballs. Not very kind
things to say in a public forum.
What exactly was your point, other than
fulfilling your commitment to a weekly col
umn?
It seems that the land of privilege has
turned you into the type of the person who
is eager to ridicule every person who
doesn't measure up to you intellectually.
Maybe you are "smarter" than the peo
ple working at the post office. Congratula
tions.
But when it all comes down to it. that
doesn't matter. The people who work
there are probably nice, kind people. You,
my friend, seem to want people to think
you are a naive, arrogant fool.
When you enter the real world, and
trust me. you are not there yet. you will dis
cover that you occasionally have to wait in
lines.
(kcasionally flights get delayed, you get
the wrong meal at a restaurant or the dry
cleaner breaks a button on your favorite
shirt.

It's all part of growing up to accept that
things don't always work as smoothly as
you would like.
While waiting in line, take a deep
breath, relax and think about what it would
be like for a thousand personalities to con
front you every day with a thousand differ
ent requests.
Have you ever been to a post office any
where else? Things always move kind of
slowly, owing to the uniqueness of the
requests that workers must handle. Certi
fied mail. Express mail, stamp collectors,
people who want a pricing on every ship
ping class — all of these things just take
time.
I bet the post office could do a better
job, as I hear that letters often take much
longer than they should to arrive in P.O.
boxes. But that probably isn't the fault of
the people who work there.
While trying to be humorous, I think
you erred by being far too personal and
cold.
A lot of people probably have percep
tions of Stanford students as being a bit
snooty, and columns like that really don't
help the cause. It's great to have opinions;
just lay off the cruelty.

Revise Sixth Man policy
As a senior, a life-long college basket
hall fan, and a dedicated three-year Sixth
Man member. I am extremely disappoint
ed in the policy for obtaining basketball
tickets this year. Allowing students to
camp out for tickets weeks ahead of time is
a completely impractical and biased policy.
First, in general, the only students who
are able to create a group large enough to
camp out are highly spirited dorms and
motivated Greek organizations. For a stu
dent living in a less organized environ
ment, creating a group large enough to
effectively share camping duties without
disrupting a normal schedule is virtually
impossible. Even if I had been able to
organize such a group, my efforts would
have been too late to secure a spot in line
close enough to earn a ticket.
Second. Jamie Zaninovich claimed that
the camping-out policy would ensure that
only the most loyal and spirited fans will
obtain tickets. The ability to rally with a
frosh dorm doesn't make you a hard-core
basketball fan. When the actual season
rolls around, I'll be curious to see how
many of these "die-hard" fans are home
studying for their Econ 1 assignments.
I'd also be interested to learn how many
of these campers can actually name the
starting five members of the team, the

other members of the Pac-10 conference,
last year's Final Four teams, etc. And how
many of these "hard-core" fans attended
last weekend's football game, or have ever
attended a Stanford water polo, soccer or
volleyball match?
In all fairness, many of the people in
line will be die-hard fans, and it is a shame
that 25 percent of the campers won't
receive tickets.
1 would propose a revised strategy for
next year. Reward those students who
have been committed Sixth Man members
by giving priority to three-year members,
and then all other seniors, and follow suit
with juniors, sophomores, and freshmen.
To ensure a diverse fan base, allocate
4(M) tickets to seniors, 300 to juniors, 2(H) to
sophomores and 100 to freshmen. Fresh
men may complain, but their time will
come. Many schools successfully utilize
such a system.
Stanford often wonders why alumni
support is so weak. Chalk up this Sixth
Man travesty as one reason. My senior
class donation will now be put towards
purchasing scalped basketball tickets, and
I will encourage my fellow angry seniors to
follow suit.
