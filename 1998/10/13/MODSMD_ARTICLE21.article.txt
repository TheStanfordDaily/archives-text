A PARISIAN FRIEND of mine,
who like all good Frenchmen is an
accomplished critic of the United
States, firmly believes that Americans rate
foreign vacation spots based on the per
centage of the country's population that
speaks English. In the course of a Great
American Vacation, he contends, the trav
eler meets hundreds of friendly locals with
cute little accents and — if the traveler is
very lucky — lots of other Americans.
Though I disagree with the theory (if it
were true, for one thing, millions of col
lege kids on spring break would flock to
Manitoba, not Puerto Vallarto). I confess I
lit the bill perfectly last month when I
traveled to Norway. On a three-day stint
in Oslo, I shamelessly spoke English at my
hotel, the city hall, a neighborhood kabob
stand and three different bus stops. Every
one, young and old. replied in cute little
British accents. On my last night in the
city, 1 befriended a ship mechanic from
Louisiana.
It was, of course, a great trip. And in

true American spirit, I figured out a way
for someone else to pay for it.
Stanford Magazine, my summer
employer, dispatched me to Oslo to cover
an alumni-related story for an upcoming
issue. It was my first real business trip, and
for the first day and a half I put on my suit
and tie, ate my hotel continental breakfast
and read an international edition of The
Wall Street Journal, carefully acting very
professionally the whole time.
But by 9 p.m. on the second evening, I
grew tired of my sterile suite, tossed on
jeans and a sweatshirt and went out look
ing for any sign of youth in the city.
I found it at the Studentengarden, a
tavern across the street from the Universi
ty of Oslo Law School. Packed with stu
dents on a Tuesday night in September,
there was barely room for me at the bar
when 1 slid in and paid far too much for a
drink 1 barely like. So I sat down, nursed
the green bottle and didn't say a word for
an hour.
I was about to go back to watching

"The Dating Game" in Norwegian on my
hotel TV when a young man with a
gumbo-thick drawl sat down next to me,
swiveled his head and asked everyone at
the bar, "How ya doin' ta-nite?"
I was the only one who bothered to
answer. We started talking, and in the next
hour the 20-year-old from somewhere out
side Shreveport treated me to his life
story.
His name was Clay, he said, and when
he was 17 he graduated from high school
and joined the Army to see the world. But
in two years, all he saw was Kentucky. Not
satisfied (can you blame him?), he moved
on to a mechanics' school in Tennessee,
then found work with a shipping company
that sent him to England, Jamaica,
Argentina and now, Oslo.
In exchange for keeping the ship's
engine running and taking a few welding
classes. Clay stays in three-star hotels and
receives $40 a day in meal money. He
makes a good wage — enough to buy a fel
low American a second $7 Heineken —

and has six months of the year off when
the ship goes back to Louisiana.
He seems like the kind of man my
French friend jokes about, the American
hick abroad who speaks loud English and
jokes about nudity on European TV. But
I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the most
savvy travelers I've ever met. While his
friends go on tour buses, he walks the
country. When they go back to their rooms
to play cards, he stays out and talks to peo
ple. Every person who shoulders up next
to him receives a smile and the same
southern greeting. This is a man who
learned quickly that the best way to appre
ciate a culture is to march in step with its
people.
We are lucky, you and I, he said as the
clock ticked toward 11:30 p.m. Lucky to be
young, doing what we love and getting
paid for it. Lucky to have found that pas
sion that makes the working world bear
able for a 20-year-old.
More than lucky, Clay is smart. He
knows he has found a good thing just as

sure as he knows it will run out some day.
The ships will stop calling him or the work
schedule will drive away too many women
like his last girlfriend, who was looking for
a solid man who comes home at night
more than six months of the year. When
that time comes, he will be ready, though
for what he's not sure. He's too busy learn
ing how the world works to bother plan
ning that far ahead. We shook hands and
went our separate ways a few minutes
later.
Up again the next day at 7 a.m., I
dressed in my suit and tie. walked down
stairs to my hotel breakfast and caught the
Scandinavian Airlines flight back to
France. Not bad for a first business trip,
but too short. The best thing I can say is
that 1 used my time well.
Now, I'm just hoping the magazine
finds a story in Manitoba.
