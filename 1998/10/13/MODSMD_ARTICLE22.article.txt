### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
As swarms of Stanford's athletes spilled out onto the
football field during an extended halftime at Saturday's
football game, the field hoekey sign was carried by a for
eigner to the team. Rather than enjoy the afternoon at
Stanford Stadium, the women's field hockey team was
doing its best to ensure that the Sears' Cup would return
to Stanford next vear as well.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Friday: Stanford (K-2 overall. 5-0 Northern Pacific Con
ference) defeated Pacific (4-2,2-1), 4-1.
■ Today: Stanford vs. Vermont at Northeastern.

Saturday afternoon, Stanford (8-2, 5-0 Northern Pa
cific Conference) won its fifth consecutive varsity match,
defeating the Pacific Tigers (4-2, 2-1), 4-1, at Pacific's
Brookside Field. Stanford handed the Tigers their first
NorPac defeat of the season.
Just over 10 minutes into the game, senior sweeper
Lissv Goralnik put Stanford on the scoreboard, record
ing her third coal of the season and second in as many

matches. The goal was assisted by junior Mallory Cham
bers and senior Justina Williams. Goralnik's goal
seemed a promising omen for the Cardinal, as Stanford's
record is 7-1 when it has scored first in a match.
However, contrary to the script the Cardinal has fol
lowed in recent weeks, the Tigers struck back in the sec
ond half. Three minutes after play resumed, junior
Aimee Tomasso tied the score with the help of a cross
ing pass from Monica Douglas.
This was the first time since Sept. 17 that Stanford had
lost a lead.
Pacific's score came off freshman goalkeeper Rebec
ca Shapiro, who was making her first appearance of the
season. But after conceding the goal three minutes into
her debut, Shapiro finished strong, recording three
saves.
The Cardinal, however, didn't get discouraged after
relinquishing its lead. With roughly 21 minutes left on
the clock, senior forward Carey Cloyd regained Stan
ford's lead with her fifth goal of the season, tying her
point total from the conclusion of last year.
It would be another seven minutes until the Cardinal
would strike again, this time led by senior midfielder Jor-
