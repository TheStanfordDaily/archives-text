football game, the field hoekey sign was carried by a for
eigner to the team. Rather than enjoy the afternoon at
Stanford Stadium, the women's field hockey team was
doing its best to ensure that the Sears' Cup would return

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Friday: Stanford (K-2 overall. 5-0 Northern Pacific Con
ference) defeated Pacific (4-2,2-1), 4-1.
■ Today: Stanford vs. Vermont at Northeastern.

Saturday afternoon, Stanford (8-2, 5-0 Northern Pa
cific Conference) won its fifth consecutive varsity match,
defeating the Pacific Tigers (4-2, 2-1), 4-1, at Pacific's
Brookside Field. Stanford handed the Tigers their first
NorPac defeat of the season.
Just over 10 minutes into the game, senior sweeper
Lissv Goralnik put Stanford on the scoreboard, record
ing her third coal of the season and second in as many

matches. The goal was assisted by junior Mallory Cham
bers and senior Justina Williams. Goralnik's goal
seemed a promising omen for the Cardinal, as Stanford's
record is 7-1 when it has scored first in a match.
However, contrary to the script the Cardinal has fol
lowed in recent weeks, the Tigers struck back in the sec
ond half. Three minutes after play resumed, junior
Aimee Tomasso tied the score with the help of a cross
ing pass from Monica Douglas.
This was the first time since Sept. 17 that Stanford had
lost a lead.
Pacific's score came off freshman goalkeeper Rebec
ca Shapiro, who was making her first appearance of the
season. But after conceding the goal three minutes into
her debut, Shapiro finished strong, recording three
saves.
The Cardinal, however, didn't get discouraged after
relinquishing its lead. With roughly 21 minutes left on
the clock, senior forward Carey Cloyd regained Stan
ford's lead with her fifth goal of the season, tying her
point total from the conclusion of last year.
It would be another seven minutes until the Cardinal
would strike again, this time led by senior midfielder Jor-

lead.

After seven more minutes, fresh
man defender Melissa Stai scored
her first goal of the season, securing
the 4-1 victory for Stanford. Stai's
goal marked the first time this sea
son a freshman has scored for the
Cardinal.
The game finished with few sur
prises. The Cardinal extended its
winning streak to five games and re
mained undefeated against NorPac
opponents. The attack was led by a
team effort as seven different play
ers received points for goals or as
sists. In the assault Leroux increased
her team-leading point total to 20.
With the victory, the Cardinal

inches closer to last year's greatest
win streak of seven games. Stanford
now finds itself just two matches
away from finishing the IWN season
undefeated in NorPac play, a feat
unmatched by last year's squad.
Perhaps the only surprise during
Saturday's match was that Pacific
was able to break through Stan
ford's defense lor a goal. The ( ardi
