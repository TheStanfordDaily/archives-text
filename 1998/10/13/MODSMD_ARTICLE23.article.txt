# Morrison's clearly a Cardinal

### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Before Friday night's game
against UCLA, 10 of the 11 players
for Stanford men's soccer team were
getting excited for a rematch of last
year's game against the Bruins.
Emotions were flowing as they
would have for any big game.
The emotions driving freshman
defender Lee Morrison, however,
were quite different.
Yes. he wanted a victory over the
defending national champions and a
solid start to conference play. But
there was also something else on
Morrison's mind.
Coming out of high school. Mor
rison was listed as one of Soccer
America's Top 25 recruits. The bat
tle for him ran its course and Morri
son finally limited his choices.
"There was a lot of emotion be
cause these are the schools I was
choosing between," Morrison said
after Friday's game. "I came know
ing there would be a lot of emotion
riding on this game."
Adding to the adrenaline rush for
Morrison was the fact many of his
teammates from the National
Under-20 squad play for UCLA.

Bruin head coach Sigi Schmid is also
the head coach of this national team.
While familiarity with the oppo
nents is advantageous in planning
against them, this also drove Morri
son's competitive spirits throughout
the game.
"It is fun playing against them,"
he said. "It makes you play that
much harder and stronger. You
want to have the bragging rights."
And it is fair to say that both Mor
rison and his National Under-20
teammates stole the show.
Offensively, Morrison nearly
provided the heroics as he actually
sent the ball by the Bruin's goalie
late in the second half, only to have
the goal ruled off due to a hand ball.
UCLA's members of the Under
-20 team dominated as well, shutting
out the Cardinal and recording all of
the points for the Bruins. UCLA
sophomore Shaun Tsakiris lifted a
corner kick to fellow sophomore
Carlos Bocanegra, which Bocane
gra then headed into the net for the
game's only goal.
And though the Bruins won Fri
day night's game. Stanford is happy
to have won the recruiting battle and
have Morrison for the next four
years.
