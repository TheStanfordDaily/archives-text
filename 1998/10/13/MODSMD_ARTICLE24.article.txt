# Reno Revival
## Stanford in third place, one stroke back 
### Ramona Shelburne 
It is an old adage both in sports
and everyday life "Forget about
what happened today, tomorrow is
a new day."
I he Stanford men's golf team
had probably been reminded ol
that proverb on numerous occa
sions after it squandered a five
stroke lead in the final round of last
week's Windon Memorial Classic
to finish in fourth place.

MEN'S GOLF
■ Yesterday: Stanford is one stroke
hack, and in third place, at the Wolf
pack Classic in Reno. Nev.
■ Today: Stanford at the Wolfpack
Classic in Reno, Nev.

Yesterday, however, the Cardi
nal appeared to have taken that
saying to heart with its strong play
at the Wolfpack Classic in Reno.
Nev.
With two rounds of the tourna
ment in the hooks, the Cardinal is
in third place with a two-over-par
(245- 283-578), and finds itself one
stroke back of Pacific-10 Confer
ence rivals Oregon
and Oregon State (281-2%-577).
Stanford looks to he regaining the
impressive form it displayed while
finishing in a tie lor lirst at the
Husky Classic two weeks ago.
The Cardinal has again been

paced by senior captain and All-
American Joel Kribel. who ended
the day three strokes back of the
lead in a tie for third place. Kribel
finished with a one-under-par (72-
71-143) and heads into today's play
looking for his third consecutive
top-three finish.
Other Cardinal golfers seem to
have been inspired by Kribel's per
formance, as Stanford's top four
finishers ended the day in the top
16 spots. The strong overall perfor
mance bodes well for today's
round.
Sophomore Eric Dahlberg
turned in his best performance of
the season with an even par (73-71-
144) to finish in a four-way tie for
11th place. Dahlberg has previous
ly finished in a tie for 31st at the
Husky Classic and a tie for 34th at
the Windon Memorial Classic.
Junior Dusty Brett finished the
rounds in 15th place with a (74-71 -
145) one-over-par. Brett is looking
to regain the form which earned
him medallist honors at the Husky
Classic and to improve upon last
week's tie for 28th place.
Sophomore James Lee contin
ued his strong play this season by
ending the day in a tie for 16th
place with a two-above-par (76-70-
146)
The final round of the Wolfpack
Classic will be played at the Light
ning West Ranch Golf Course,
todav. beginning at 8 a.m.
