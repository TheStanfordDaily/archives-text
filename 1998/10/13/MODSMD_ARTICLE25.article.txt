# Just a bit outside
## Camping out like only Stanford can 
### 
Brian Eule

There were bunk beds, big
screen televisions, foosball ta
bles, sofas, hammocks, an occa
sional D.J. and tents. Lots of tents,
Stanford's version of roughing it
in the great outdoors.
And it was awesome.
The reflection of the small
flames from the portable barbecue
pit flickered in the eyes of the gath
ering students. Some were
drenched from the sprinklers that
had gone off just moments before
and soaked their sleeping bags.
Some had grown tired of tossing a
football around. But all shared in
the glorv of the moment.

Nobody really seemed to plan a
specific day to start camping out
for men's basketball tickets, but
once it began, word traveled like a
man with too many frequent flier
miles. With over a week remaining
before tickets would go on sale, a
tent city was constructed at the foot
of Maples Pavilion.
It was beautiful.
Saturday night, the site was
pulsing with life. Music blared and
students meandered around the
camp, greeting friends and dis
cussed everything from the after
noon's football game to the coming
economics midterm.
As the weekend grew old, many
were tired. The cause at hand,
however, was a worthy one. With
one of the most powerful basket
ball teams in the nation returning
this season, and the smallest home
arena in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford students could do the
math.
How the Stanford basketball of
fice was not ready for this, 1 have
no idea.
Senior Terence Lin was one of
the die-hard fans camped out since
last Wednesday. In his three years

to date as a Stanford student, Lin
missed just one men's game at
Maples, an occurrence he blames
on traffic. He wasn't about to miss
this.
With a group of friends he la
beled as the "Real Fans," Lin made
sure multiple people manned their
tent at all times.
What Lin didn't anticipate was
that the line of tents wrapping
around Maples would grow wider
rather than increase in length.
There was supposed to be a reg
ular checking of those in line to
prevent such problems from ever
occurring. Groups were not sup
posed to be able to multiply in size
and the basketball office had
planned to do more to ensure
order than just make the "informal
checks" that ended up occurring.
The Athletics Department's
final method of meeting with the
group leaders, in order to sort out
the rules, was a good one, however,
the problems should have been an
ticipated in advance. Allocating
tickets for a top program on a first
come first-serve basis, there is
going to be some amount of chaos.
The first solution presented, a
random lottery, was unacceptable
and it is commendable to the de
partment that it altered this upon
hearing students' reactions.
The final solution, allocating
enough tickets for only 75 percent
of each group that camped outside
of Maples, however, creates signif
icant tension within the groups as
to who is entitled to the tickets.
"We're flipping coins like mad."
Lin chuckled.
There were some additional
complaints that it was unfair to give
the same percentage of tickets to
those groups at the front of the line
as to those in the rear, however,
many students did not mind due to
the claim that only a few hours sep
arated their arrivals.
What we need to remember,
though, is that during the past
week, Stanford students demon
strated the kind of spirit that is
needed on this campus. People
keep comparing Stanford basket


Brian
Eule
ball and its fans to that of Duke,
however, the Cardinal has estab
lished its own identity.
The "Real Fans" plans to give
three or four of the season tickets to
its "founding members," as Lin put
it.for their dedication during the
previous week. The remaining tick
ets that were allocated to the group
will be given to its members by a
random series of shuffling.
Other groups, are using varied
methods including holding meet
ings to discuss who will get which
tickets for which games.
Rumor has it. some are planning
on pitching tents the night before.

Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly column runs on Tuesdays,
has writers sleeping out at his door
in hopes of becoming the men 's
basketball beat writer.
