## 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
The Institute for International
Studies has named Raul Alfredo
Estrada Oyuela, a former Argentine
diplomat, as the Payne Distinguished
Professor for 1998-99.
Estrada brings to Stanford a long
history of effective diplomacy. In ad
dition to serving in Argentine em
bassies in the United States, Austria,
Brazil and Chile, he was Argentina's
ambassador to China from 1994 to
1997.
Last December, Estrada chaired
the Kyoto-based Third Conference
of the Parties to the I Jnited Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
At Stanford, Estrada will incorpo
rate his expertise in the relationship
between developed and developing
nations into his lectures, which will

begin in January. Specifically, the lec
tures will focus on the Kyoto Protocol
and its future implications for climate
change policy.
"We thought that he was someone
we'd very much like to bring to Stan
ford. primarily because of his involve
ment at the Kyoto conference," said
Evelyn Kelsev. associate director for
External Affairs at the institute.
Estrada proved to be a master jug
gler in his work at Kyoto, particularly
in striking a deal between environ
mentalist and industrialist causes, ac
cording to lIS Prof. Stephen Schnei
der.
Even though no one was fully ap
peased by the results of the Kyoto
conference. Estrada did manage to
coordinate a plan that will serve as a
crucial working model for future ne
gotiations.
"[ I he plan made at] Kyoto was
the best agreement that was political-

ly possible. Nobody was fully satis
fied. which is testimony to his phe
nomenal job of scientific diplomacy,"
said Schneider.
Schneider stressed that Estrada
completed a task that most people
would not have been able to pull off.
"1 le was in the most difficult games of
football you can imagine." Schneider
said.
"He used personal charisma and
good sense to hold it together."
Estrada follows other prominent
figures in his acceptance of the Payne
professorship, including last year's
professor, former New Jersey Sena
tor Bill Bradley.
Other past Payne Professors are
former Environmental Protection
Agency head William k. Reillv; am
bassador-at-large for the Singapore
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tommy
T.B. Koh: and American nuclear se
curity expert James E. Goodbv.
