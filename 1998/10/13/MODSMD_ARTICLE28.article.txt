I lie show, well-known for its
video box with big red lips, was origi

campy s cx movie. I he plot follows

a very straight-edged couple, Brad
and Janet (Harry Host wick and Susan
Sarandon). The couple is taken
hostage by a transvestite alien from
" Transsexual I'ransylvania," Doctor

scantily clad, overly made-up Tran
sylvanian groupies.

Dressed in black pants, scan
dalously tight tank tops, black eye
pencil, borrowed dog collars and
more hair care products than allowed
by law. the group prepared to take
Berkeley by storm and live it up with
the made-up, dressed up and lit up
Rocky I lorror Picture Show Freaks.
Let's just say the Berkeley scene
did not meet expectations.
Five rows back sat a boy wearing a
button-down shirt and tie who
couldn't have been older than 13, and
two rows in front of him, sat a middle
aged man in royal blue sweats and
Keds. In the front were several teen
age girls, one that had dyed black hair
and a buzz cut. Another had acces

sorized w«'h about eleven facial
piercings and looked more like a 'NOs
punk lost in the '90s than a "Kock
vphile".
Stanford students trying to he dar
ing at I xotic lirotic could have heat
this crowd.
As show time appnniched, a group
ol people in front were hustling
around screaming to each other, to
the audience or to anyone who would
listen ahout flashlights and casting.
The lead was a woman, dressed up
;is the transvestite alien Dr. Frank 'n
I inter. ()ther cast members included
one woman dressed as a maid, and a
man with a dress on and a leash tied
around his neck. We doubted
whether this motely crew could actu
ally put on the show.
In a last-ditch attempt to assemble
a complete cast, someone suddenly
shouted "Does anyone want to be in

the show?"
No answer.
Then pleading, "Please, doesn't
anyone want to be in the show?"
The woman playing the part of the
maid Magenta sat down and chatted
with our group of Stanford misfits.
She introduced the cast members to
us. Then someone had the bright idea
that one of us should get up in front til
the audience and fake an orgasm.
While contemplating a full retreat
and a refund, the lights went down
and the show began. The random cast
managed to pull off a decent perfor
mance. In fact, the woman who
played Frank n I inter gave an out
standing performance in a role that is
usually filled by a man.
Even though the cast didn't know
all the words, only three were wear
ing costumes, and they thought a
streaker would impress Full Moon on

the Quad and Gaieties veterans, the
enthusiasm was huge. The 40 people
in the audience danced in the aisles,
sang the songs, shouted out the audi
ence participation lines and generally
had a great time.
The enthusiasm and fanaticism
that "Rockyphiles" have comes from
the fact that following and perform
ing the show becomes central to their
identity. Also, that enthusiasm
spreads: Berkeley, San Jose, San
Mateo. San Francisco, Marin and
Fremont all have easts that try to per
form at regular showings of the film.
As the cast headed off to Denny's
for a three in the morning celebrato
ry meal, we said good-bye to the cast
members, and headed back to the
land of future investment bankers
and consultants to rest up before
planning the next Rocky Horror ad
venture.
