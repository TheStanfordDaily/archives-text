# Asian students get financial aid
## Big help in economic crisis 
### Lindsay Stamm Contributing writer 
While financial woes continue in Asia, the Financial
Aid Office and Bechtel International Center are busy at
work helping international students affected by the crisis.
The crisis has severely affected the funding of students
from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea and the
Philippines.
Many international Stanford students, at both under
graduate and graduate levels, previously relied on fund
ing from their home governments. Facing economic dis
order and devaluation of currency, these governments
have made cuts in student funding.
"There is a presumption that the system will eventual
ly get better ... but there is a lot of risk and disarray that
continues to escalate," said Economics Prof. Ronald
McKinnon.
Because individual situations widely vary, the I iniver
sity has not implemented a general policy applying to all
affected students. Cynthia Rife, director of student
awards in the Financial Aid Office, emphasized that the
University is continuing to respond on a case by case
basis.
"We have been able to respond to undergraduates
whose '98-'99 financial aid application explained things
had changed," Rife explained.
Graduate students' concerns have been addressed
through the Bechtel International Center and their re
spective academic departments.
Bechtel Director John Pearson noted that a large por
tion of affected students are graduate students, because
they comprise the majority of Asian international stu
dents. He has worked with about 50 graduate students to
defer payment deadlines.
Pearson noted that United States federal assistance
has not had a large impact on Stanford students.
An undergraduate student from Tokyo remarked that
"many undergraduates I know have not been totally cut
oil from their government's funding because they are ic
ceiving the top level financial awards."
Although there arc several initiatives in the United
States intended to assist foreign students, Pearson said
many are too restrictive. One initiative stipulates that
only five students may be nominated and that the univer
sity must match assistance.
Pearson has worked with a handful of students on re
ceiving assistance from the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Services. Through this program, students may drop
below a full course load in order to allow time for work.
The program <>lfers students help in finding a 20-hour
per week campus |ob.ot an expedited application pioccss
in securing off-campus work. I his option is only a\nibble
for students that tiled for assistance
before June 1998.
He has acted as a liaison for indi
vidual students and as a coordina
tor for Stanford's response to stu
dents needs. Pearson remarked
that Stanford's response was simi
lar to that ol its peers.
Although some state institutions
have worked to lower tuition for
students severely affected hv the
crisis, Stanford did not view that as
a viable option.
Pearson said that it is too early to
determine the effect of the financial
crisis on fall enrollment.
