ments, several Stanford College Re
publicans in attendance made them
selves heard as well.
"I heard that the Democrats were
using this event to get support for a
huge Boxer rally on campus," said ju
nior Ryan Parks, chair of the Stan
ford College Republicans. "I wanted
to come here to support Fong and
disprove the ideas that there is over
whelming Boxer support on campus
and that the campus itself is uniform

ly liberal."
Most of the approximately 40 stu
dents who attended, however, did
come to voice their enthusiasm for
Boxer and her campaign.
At the door students were offered
several handouts such as "Highlights
of Senator Barbara Boxer's record
on the environment," "Ten reasons
to support Barbara Boxer for U.S.
Senate," and "Ten ways you can help
Barbara Boxer in your community."
In addition. Boxer pins and bumper
stickers were distributed.
Krista Glaser, a sophomore and
the director of communications for

the Stanford Democrats, was espe
cially excited about the debate be
cause KRON Channel 4 News, the
San Francisco-based network host
ing the debate, had come several days
ago to tape her asking a question tor
the two candidates to answer.
"In my question I noted that,
though there has been a great deal of
emphasis on K through 12 education,
focus on college education has been
lacking. I wanted to know what each
candidate's opinion was," Glaser
said.
To Glaser's disappointment, her
question did not air.
