The University has raised a record $319 million in gifts,
a 2.3 percent increase over the 1996-97 results, according
to the Office of Development's recently completed analy
sis of fundraising efforts during the 1997-98 fiscal year.
"We probably have the second-highest total [for gifts
received] in higher education. Harvard raised $460 mil
lion, so we're second bv a long way," said Vice President
for Development John Ford.
The analysis of this past year reveals "very strong
fundraising indicators," as the number of donors and the
number of gifts given increased. Ford said.
The Senior Gift program is also flourishing, with the
Class of 1998 setting a new record participation rate of 73
percent.
"We're excited about that. It portends well for the fu
ture in that students understand how gift money has sup
ported their education," Ford said.
"We have had very good results, but there are a num
ber of things we want to keep working on. Stanford has a
lot of initiatives that require [large sums of] money. The
Law School and the Hoover Institution have fundraising
efforts underway. We need about $200 million for Stan
lord Graduate Fellowships," he said.
According to Ford, the four areas of focus for fundrais
ing are undergraduate education and the Schools of Busi
ness, Engineering and Medicine.
"They each have a different story. During Mr. Casper's
presidency, the centerpiece [in fundraising]... was raising
the endowment to support Introductory Studies and fi
nancial aid scholarships," he said.
In the area of medicine, there are "new research
thrusts" that warrant additional physical resources and
additional faculty. Stanford's faculty "are especially well
positioned to make contributions to the field," Ford said.
With regards to the Business School, money is needed
to fund initiatives proposed during outgoing dean Michael
Spence's tenure and to provide discretionary funds for his
successor.
According to Ford, the case for engineering is very sim
ilar to the case for medicine. "There are some very inter
esting research areas that [the University] would like to
expand," Ford said.
The areas of concentration are determined by the
Board of Trustees' Committee on Development.
Ford. Class of *71, said that although the alumni giving
rate has risen to an all-time high of 34.8 percent, the por
tion of alumni who donate is low compared to Ivy League
schools.
Ford cited several reasons to explain this disparity in
alumni donation rates.
Many Ivy League schools have fostered a very strong
class identity for years, he said.
This class solidarity fuels competition between the
classes, which in turn drives people to donate.
In addition, those schools cultivate the expectation that
alumni will give back. Ford said.
"We're trying to be a little subtler," he quipped.
"When it comes to larger gilts. Stanford does as well as
anyone. Stanford is very successful in identifying what it
needs funds for and then making a good case to prospec-
