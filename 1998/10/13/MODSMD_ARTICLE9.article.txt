# Naranja students follow passions

### Essan Ni Contributing writer 
A Stanford student enters Naran
ja, the Entrepreneurial Spirit theme
dorm, and trips over a group of com
puter science students sitting in
"Yahoo Hall" talking start-ups.
Looking up, the visitor notices that
each door name tag is based on a dif
ferent internet search category. She
turns the corner, only to find eco
nomics majors in their weekly
power-suit-ironing session.
This picture is a prevalent mis
conception of the new theme-orient
ed Naranja. The dorm, which adopt
ed the Entrepreneurial Spirit focus
(or the first time this year, is far from
being all business and money now.
In fact, it's all about passion.
"We wanted to call the dorm Pas
sion Palace, but I don't think Res Ed
would be too happy about that," said
resident assistant Marwah Helmy.
As she and focus assistant Holda
Biskeborn explained, the theme is
about pursuing one's passions and
dreams and sharing it with the world.
Participants can interpret entrepre
neurial spirit to include anything
they have a drive to achieve.
"The goal is to develop people's
passions and help them follow
through," agreed resident fellow
Thomas Massey. "We're helping

people develop a sense of how they
want to pursue their dreams."
To this end, the upperclassmen
participating in theme activities will
present a project of personal interest
to the rest of the dormitory. The en
trepreneurial spirit, Massey ex
plains, entails getting others — the
public — involved in the implemen
tation of one's ideas and vision.
"It's an idea you have that you
want to project," he said. "We want
to help people communicate to the
world."
Massey intends to hold work
shops to assist residents planning
presentations.
The focus members, for their
part, are brewing a variety of pro
jects for fruition in the near future.
For instance, Biskeborn cites, there
is a Romanian student who loves
music and wants to take the house to
see a Romanian pianist. Another
wants to bring in panelists to talk
about suicide prevention.
Senior Steven Macias is interest
ed in politics and is involved in the
upcoming state elections. He is con
sidering bringing politicians he has
worked with to talk to the house.
"Most people are not doing any
thing business-wise," he said. "We
have sports activities, sky-diving, fun
stuff like that."
In fact, most of the focus resi

dents are not economics or business
related majors.
"We've got [people majoring in]
Psych, ME, Bio, everything," Biske
born said.
Aside from the passion and fun,
however, Massey wants to incorpo
rate a sense of social responsibility in
business entrepreneurs. He stated
that it's great if people take their
passions and make money with it.
but they must keep in mind their
ethics and responsibilities.
"I expect to bring in some
MBA's, investment bankers, who
will show people how business can
help others and be socially responsi
ble," Massey said. "My particular in
terpretation of entrepreneurial spir
it has a business aspect that involves
heart and integrity and character. I
want people to look into their ven
tures with enthusiasm and responsi
bility."
B.J. Hwan, a sophomore resi
dent. is not officially part of the focus
but is also interested in business and
the entrepreneurial spirit. He chose
to live in Naranja because "it has a
focus and will be more than just a
dorm or an ethnic theme dorm." He
also thinks that because of the
theme, upperclassmen will partic
ipate more in the dorm.
This sentiment is echoed by
Helmy.

"I expect upperclassmen to he
more involved in the dorm and with
freshmen and to share with them,"
she said. "It hasn't been like that in
the past."
The dorm, according to Massey,
is about 45 percent freshmen. One of
them is Robert Garcia, who, like his
fellow Naranja frosh, was unaware
that he was coming into a theme
dorm. The freshmen do, however,
have the opportunity to get involved
if they want.
The idea for Naranja's theme
came from last year's resident fel
low, Eyzzz Bacarde-Evolfo. He
worked in the School of Education
and was involved in counseling. Bac
arde-Evolfo focused on motivating
people, and his vision of the theme
dorm is an example of his own entre
preneurial spirit.
Massey liked the idea when Res
Ed approached him and is more
than happy to carry on that vision.
,l I wanted to be an RF but I didn't
want to be just in a dorm. 1 wanted
some focus that can be developed
and help everyone," he said.
He adds that this theme is special
because it is very diverse, dealing
with business, life, interests, ethics,
philosophy, and more.
"It is a marriage of the intellectu
al and practical," he said.
And, of course, the passionate.
