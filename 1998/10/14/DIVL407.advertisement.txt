VISHAY-SILICONIX
Career Fair
Siliconix manufactures and designs power integrated circuits using
advanced BiCMOS processes. The two major market areas Siliconix is
involved in are Power Conversion (DC-DC Conversion, all topologies)
and Motor Control (speed control, sensorless brushless motor
communication circuits, etc.).
We're
Creating a
future
people can
hold on to.
