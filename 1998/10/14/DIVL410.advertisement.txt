Since our founding in 1984, SCA
Consulting has specialized in helping
companies create shareholder value by
designing value management, performance
measurement and reward programs which
focus managers on achieving business
objectives. We understand clients' business
strategies and identify the behaviors that
they need to reinforce; we then create high
ly customized value management, perfor
mance measurement and reward programs
which signal the performance and behavior
desired. Our perspective is unique because
it integrates strategic, financial, organiza
tional and compensation expertise.
