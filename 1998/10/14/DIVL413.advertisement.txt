The Charles R. Blyth Fund
Information Session
Wednesday, October 14 @ 7:00 pm
380-380W (Basement of the Math Building)
We at the Blyth Fund want to extend an invitation to all
interested students to find our more about the Blyth Fund,
Stanford's premier student-managed Investment Club. We
have $65,000 under management (members DO NOT
contribute their own money to the Fund) and you DO NOT
have to be a financial wizard or an IE major to join. If you
don't know that much about stocks, we are here to help you
learn more. If you already know quite a bit about stocks,
here is your opportunity to put some real money behind your
trading ideas. We are also seeking several members to help us
develop our Web page. We will have current members on
hand to discuss the Fund's operation and to answer any
questions that you might have.
