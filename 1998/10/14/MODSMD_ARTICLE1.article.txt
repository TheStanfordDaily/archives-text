### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Renovated dining services for La
gunita Court and Roble Hall, once
expected to he completed by the be
ginning of fall quarter, are now tenta
tively expected to be done by Nov.
20.
Once the structural renovations
are finished. Housing and Dining
Services staff will require additional
time to ready the dining hall to serve
students.
"I fully expect the contractors to
be done by the 2()th," said Housing
and Dining Services Director Keith
Guy. "They're not going to get any
slack on this."

It better be as good as the
establishment promises'

According to Guv. even if the con
struction is delayed further, arrange
ments will be made for students in
the interim. The absolute latest that
the facility would be made available
is the first day of winter quarter.
Lagunita arid Roble students
have reacted with growing impa
tience.
"All I can say is that when our
mythical dining hall finally arrives, it
better be as good as the establish
ment promises." said Eric Altman, a
freshman living in Granada.
Students who cat in dining halls
that absorb the overflow of Lagunita
students also are unhappy with the

temporary arrangements.
"1 understand that they don't
have their own dining hall," said Jen
nifer Brant, a sophomore living in
Florence Moore Hall. "However,
our dining hall is simply not equipped
to handle this quantity of people."
The project as a whole, part of
Stanford's ongoing Capital Improve
ment Project, renovated all of Lagu
nita Court. Residence improvements
are already complete.
"The housing had to be done be
fore the school year started so stu
dents could move in," Guy said. "The
dining facility was set aside so that
[the contractors] could finish [the res
idences] on time."
The dining facility, while built on
top of the old facility, will be much
improved. Patterned after the style of
Lagunita Court, the dining room will
retain its trademark high ceiling and
chandeliers.
"When the project is complete,
Roble and Lagunita will have sepa
rate dining rooms," Guy said. "There
will be a new common kitchen and
serving area, which will be connected
by a corridor to the respective dining
rooms." Beverage stations will be lo
cated in the dining rooms.
This marks the second time the
dining hall completion date has been
postponed. When they did not finish
by the start of school, the contractors
pushed their estimate to Oct. 15.
Under the terms of Stanford's
contract, the contractors will not be
forced to pay penalties for the delay,
but they will be solely responsible for
the additional costs of the extended
construction.
