# Court action angers gay activists

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court today
let stand a Cincinnati city charter amendment that
denies discrimination protection to homosexuals. Two
years ago, the high court struck down as unconstitu
tional a similar measure in Colorado.
The justices turned away a gay rights group's argu
ment that the voter-approved 1993 amendment violates
homosexuals' equal protection rights just as the Col
orado amendment did.
Today's action is not a decision and sets no national
precedent. It likely will create confusion over govern
ment policies toward homosexual rights.
Three justices took the unusual step of emphasizing
that the court's action "should not be interpreted either
as an independent construction of the charter or as an
expression of its views about the underlying issues."
The nation's highest court provided a dramatic vic
tory for gav-rights advocates in 1996 when it threw out
a Colorado state constitutional amendment that for
bade state and local laws protecting homosexuals from

discrimination. The amendment unlawfully singled out
gays and made them "unequal to everyone else," the
eourt ruled then.
The Cincinnati amendment bans city ordinances or
policies that provide gays "any claim of minority or
protected status, quota preference or other preferential
treatment."
Gay rights advocates succeeded in 1994 in barring
enforcement of the city amendment, but the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a trial judge's injunc
tion. After its ruling in the Colorado case, the Supreme
Court had ordered the 6th Circuit court to restudy the
issue. The appeals court again upheld the Cincinnati
measure last October, saying it merely kept homosexu
als from getting "special privileges and preferences,"
unlike the Colorado amendment.
The 6th Circuit also said the Cincinnati measure was
a "direct expression of the local community will" while
the Colorado amendment interfered with local govern
ments' abilities to protect homosexual rights.
