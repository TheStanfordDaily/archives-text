BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke hailed an agreement with the
Yugoslav president today as an apparent turning point
in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis, but said it was still
too early to celebrate.
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic agreed Mon
day to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, begin peace
negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled
Serb province.
In a rare appearance on national television, Milose
vic declared that the agreements "avert the danger of a
military intervention against our country."
"Our task is to accelerate the political process and
economic recovery of our country as a whole," he said.
The breakthrough, announced Monday night by
President Clinton in New York, came after NATO
revved its engines and authorized airstrikes if Milosevic
doesn't match his promises with action.
Hundreds of people have been killed and more than
300,000 uprooted in Kosovo — where ethnic Albanians
make up 90 percent of the 2 million people — since
Milosevic began his crackdown on separatists in Febru
ary. Many refugees are living in the open after Serb
forces burned their homes, and aid officials fear a
humanitarian disaster with winter approaching.
After an hou r long meeting with the Yugoslav lead
er today. Holbrooke warned that "we're not out of the
emergency yet." He said it's up to Milosevic's govern
ment to prove its commitment to the agreement.
"I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we
are about what happened ... in Kosovo ... the unnec
essary horror of it," Holbrooke said.
Milosevic issued a statement saying the agreement
demonstrated his government's commitment to the
peace process, but also reflected his position that the
demands are unwarranted.
"The steps which our country is taking to solve the
Kosovo problems by peaceful means show our firm
commitment that all questions can be solved by politi
cal means, but also the determination to protect the
country's territorial integrity and sovereignty," the
statement said.
Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has
insisted the crisis was an internal matter in which for
eign powers should play no role. The Serbs have been
intent on crushing the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement.

NATO agreed early today on the final step needed to
authorize airstrikes. The 16-nation alliance set a four
day deadline for Milosevic to begin complying with
international demands.
In Pristina, capital of Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian
politician who claims to speak for the KLA said he was
pleased by the NATO action but expressed skepticism
that Milosevic would live up to the agreement.
The politician, Adem Deniaci. said he was disap
pointed that the verification force would be unarmed.
Clinton said NATO had agreed to hold off on
airstrikes for four days so international inspectors could
verify that Milosevic has met U.N. Security Council
demands to stop the violence in Kosovo.
"We hope this will mark a turning point in the right
direction. But the proof... is in compliance with U.N.
resolution 1199 and with actions on the ground in
Kosovo," Holbrooke said.
In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair wel
comed the agreement but warned Milosevic that
NATO won't hesitate to act if he reneges. "We are pre
pared to see this thing through. We are prepared to use
force if necessary," he said.
After talks with Milosevic on Sunday and Monday,
Holbrooke ilew to Belgium to brief NATO.
Dozens of diplomats were evacuated from Belgrade
on Monday in anticipation of possible NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslav military sites.
The Russian parliament voted today to send a fact
finding delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo. Russia has
good relations with Yugoslavia, and has opposed
airstrikes.
Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not alter
existing sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to
the accord was Milosevic's decision to allow a "verifi
cation mission" and to permit "aerial verification" by
non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as the end
of the week.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe will oversee the verification force.
In Brussels, NA TO sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Milosevic must take four steps: with
draw special troops from Kosovo immediately, sign an
agreement with the OSCE on the verification mission,
sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne recon
naissance and hammer out a "framework agreement"
by November outlining future talks with ethnic Albani
ans.
