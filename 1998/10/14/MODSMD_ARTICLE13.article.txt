# Taiwan, China to begin talks

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) â€”On the
eve of talks aimed at restoring its
dialogue with China, Taiwan
called today for a fresh start in
relations but again demanded
recognition of their island as an
equal.
Speaking of a "heavy responsi
bility," top negotiator Koo Chen
fu said he hoped informal discus
sions with counterpart Wang Dao
han starting Wednesday in Shang
hai would help end a three-year
break in negotiations.
"This is a starting point for
rebuilding trust between the
sides," said Koo, SI, a business
man and senior member of Tai
wan's ruling Nationalist Party.
Koo, who will lead a 12-mcmber
delegation of scholars and officials,
is also scheduled to meet Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Vice
Premier Qian Qichen in Beijing on
Sunday. Qian is considered a hard
line advocate of the view that Tai
wan is a renegade province that

must submit to China's authority
or face military attack.
Koo and Wang, elder statesmen
charged with trying to forge rela
tions between the two govern
ments, have not met since their
first talks in Singapore in 1993.
Plans were under way for a second
meeting in 1995 when China sus
pended the talks in anger over Tai
wan's campaign to raise its
international profile.
China has demanded that Tai
wan begin political discussions
relating to reunification before the
formal dialogue can resume on a
regular basis.
Koo's mission is to persuade
China that pragmatic issues also
have political aspects, and that
attaining consensus on issues like
the resolution of fishing disputes is
the best way to begin building
trust. However, whether this trust
comes as an immediate effect or
an indirect result, is debateable.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry

spokesman Tang Guoqiang reiter
ated China's position that there is
only one China and Taiwan is part
of it.
Beijing's goal is peaceful reuni
fication under a "one country, two
systems" formula that would allow
Taiwan to maintain its capitalist
lifestyle. Tang said. The lifestyle.
Tang said, is important to the
nation's identity as a whole.
The talks this week will be a
"major event" between the two
sides. Tang said. Beijing hopes
they will improve the atmosphere
and pave the way for holding polit
ical negotiations soon, he said.
Washington has supported a
resumption of dialogue, sending
officials to both sides earlier in the
year to gently nudge them toward
talks.
The mainland and Taiwan have
been divided since 1949, when the
nationalists retreated to the island
after they lost a civil war to the
communists on the mainland.
