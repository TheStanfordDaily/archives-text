## Editorial Read through a Quad lately? 
### 
Past mismanagement
shouldn't hinder potential
for progress this year

IF IT IS true that one is preceded hy
one's reputation, the Stanford Quad is
in a hit of a hind this year.
Upperclassmen remember a sordid his
tory of inefficient management and late
yearbook deliveries. It was not always this
way; the Quad used to he a popular and
venerable institution. But recent years have
been unkind to the Quad.
Even after a reorganization effort in
summer 1997, last year's staff remained
small. While a small staff does not necessar
ily compromise the quality of the book, it
does leave this year's editor with very little
to work with when the experienced staff
moves on.
Essentially, the Quad is starting from
scratch this year. With no institutionalized
system of staff jobs and production guide
lines, Marianne Recher. the 1998-99 editor,
has a lot of rebuilding to do. But this
rebuilding is hampered by those sordid
memories of Quads from years past.
Nonetheless, this year could be the year
the Quad gets its act together. And
although it's still early, it seems that stu
dents should give the Quad a chance this
year.
Recher knows that she needs to start
from the ground up. After serving on last
year's Quad Advisory Board, she knows

what weaknesses she is dealing with. The
most glaring deficiency is the lack of a staff.
Her most difficult task is to build an infras
tructure — one that will last for future
Quads, so that new editors don't find them
selves in her position again.
Recher has already built a business staff
and, perhaps more importantly, has recruit
ed a public relations manager. By focusing
on staff recruitment, she has shown a com
mitment to enlarge the staff beyond its
once-skeletal numbers.
Recher has researched what kind of jobs
she needs to fill to support a quality year
book. She's shopping for publishers and
putting together a photography staff. She
even has long-term goals, such as setting up
a Web site where students can order year
books online. And yes, she has recruited a
Web site developer.
All that's left is for students to take some
initiative and meet the Quad halfway.
We're used to complaining and bemoaning
the problems of the perennially troubled
yearbook. But if this year goes well, the
book may be well on its way to becoming an
institutionalized and respected publication.
Freshmen, the yearbook may not seem
like an essential part of your Stanford expe
rience yet. But just wait a few years. Last
year's graduates — and this year's
seniors — are already becoming nostalgic.
We hope the Quad fulfills this year's
promise to provide a learning experience, a
foundation for future editions and a quality
product for students. Likewise, we hope
students will give the Quad a chance and
even lend a hand to help the book succeed.
