## Investigating the cult of pop culture 
### 
Popular culture
fascinates me, as it
does most people.
Because the fads and fash
ions are as interesting and
peculiar as the events that
prompted them, it is
entertaining to consider
i the trends that define our

current cultural climate.
In modern American society, television
reigns as the most powerful player in the
pop culture game, despite the diminishing
quality of its programming. What is my
worst fear for the future of television? See
ing an M TV docu-drama of my life set to
the hip tunes of contemporary musical acts.
Nobody wants to watch me sit at home on a
Friday night eating a microwaveable burri
to with some strikingly appropriate Nine
Inch Nails song scoring my every action.
And I especially don't want to watch other
people eat burritos on television, but clear
ly many TV viewers do not share my opin
ion. The proliferation of these so-called real
life shows, along with their inexplicable
popularity, has led me to question the good
taste and basic sense of my peers in the 18-
to-35-year-old demographic.
This trend in television, however, aston
ishes me less than the newest cultural phe
nomenon targeted at my age group: highly
caffeinated soft drinks.
"1 liked Mountain Dew back when it
wasn't even cool to drink it, man," snaps the
green-haired hooligan with the "Cobain
Forever" T-shirt.
More power to you, "man," but you're a

little behind the times. While the marketing
wizards at PepsiCo have you longing tor an
A'-treme lifestyle replete with other pastel
clad twenty-somethings as companions, the
future of high-caffeinated refreshment lies
in the new wave of carbonated energy
drinks (CEDs). Red Bull, XTC and
Zydekola are the new kids in town, and
they don't mess around. Drinks like Red
Bull — which contains taurine and glu
curonolactone, rather than calleine —
boast a caffeine equivalency rating of about
one Red Bull to a case of "the Dew.'
Not surprisingly, even though these
drinks are just becoming popular here, peo
ple in other countries have enjoyed pump
ing themselves full of diuretic stimulants lor
centuries. In Europe, parents serve their
children coffee with dinner; most American
youths, in contrast, will not have an espres
so shot until their first college frat party.
The French, of course, have been hooked
on lattes since the mid-1 S(K)s, while Ger
many, the birthplace of CEDs, is the self
proclaimed leader in non-caloric energy
technologies. In the global market,
CEDs — or, as our friends down south
would say, "bebidas de energia con gas,"
have already become the artificial soft
drinks of choice. So you'd better get on
board, hombre, before the X train leaves for
Caffeine City without you.
Fads in programming and products
aside, the most intriguing aspect of youth
culture is the way our society has sculpted
the image of our generation as a group of
slack-jawed cynics with a fast-food patience
for immediate gratification. The worst part

of this contrived characterization of post
adolescents as thrill-seeking slackers is that
some young adults actually buy into this
manufactured portrait. In the hopes of tap
ping our spend-now, save-never fountain of
disposable income, marketing strategists
everywhere have carefully constructed
commercial products and company images
that appeal to the misanthropic nature of a
generation that had to be told to be misan
thropic. I had always thought I was an ide
alist until Newsweek informed me other
wise.
The unfortunate fact is that, in spite of
our post-Watergate skeptical tendencies
and aversion to mainstream institutions, the
marketing strategists' influence is now
inescapable. The province of alternative
subculture that used to offer us asylum just
got annexed to the mainstream empire.
Alterna-kids are willing and easy fodder for
the alterna-industry, and they offer the
promise of profit that never existed with
their cultural predecessors, the hippies.
These peace-loving rebels shunned con
sumerism and suffered from a bad case ot
upper-middle-class asceticism that stemmed
from the intolerable burden of being con
sidered unfashionably privileged by the
youth of their era.
In light of these ruminations, I find
myself more wary of our popular culture.
But I'll be fine — just microwave me anoth
er burrito.
