Halance convictions with grace
Monday, as I braved White Plaza traffic
to search for my ever-elusive mail, I was
greeted with drumming blasting across the
square and a large sign stating, "Columbus
can kiss my red ass." I saw a few people
standing around under the birdcage, looking
bored and disinterested. 1 had forgotten it
was Columbus Day (as far as I could tell,
Stanford University wisely avoided any
involvement with this questionable holiday).
However, I was deeply offended and dis
turbed by the "protest" in White Plaza.
It is inappropriate to use obscenities to
make any statement, no matter how impor
tant the message. The Holocaust of World
War II was one of the great tragic events of
humankind, yet I am not about to arrange a
protest that proclaims, "Hitler was a fucker."
If I wish to take action against injustice or
oppression, I may pass out leaflets, gather
petition signatures, give a speech or even
play music from the culture that is being
oppressed. However, the use of angry and
hateful language only contributes to polar
ization. intimidation and distrust.
If we wish to prevent events as horrible as
the gent vide against American Indians, we
must encourage dialogue and unity, not
hatred and silence punctuated by obsceni
ties. I would like to think the select and tal
ented students here at Stanford are capable
of intelligent and thoughtful discourse with
out resorting to name-calling and obscenity.

Bring back the Stanford Swing
Last Saturday night's Swing Dance in the
Main Quad is one of the best events I have
attended here at Stanford University. I find it
very refreshing that an event like this was
thought up, planned and carried out. It was
amazing to be out there trying to work out
the steps and then bumping into older cou
ples who attended Stanford years ago.
I just want to say thank you to all those
responsible for putting on such a first-class
event. Please put it on again next year! To
those students and alumni who didn't go to
the swing dance on the Quad, I strongly
encourage you to make it a priority next fall.

Don't get worked up about Geyser
Why are we all offended by Dan Geyser's
remarks?
In the Oct. 13 Daily, David Becker
sounded off a note of personal affront at Mr.
Geyser's attack on the postal workers. Mr.
Becker, you should know as a Stanford affil
iate that Geyser's options for things to com
plain about are limited.
The fact is, Stanford Organized Com
plaint (near relative to Stanford Institution
alized Goofiness, epitomized by freshmen
screaming in unison only during Dead
Week) holds as its targets a limited range of
subjects.
The post office is our sacred cow. It is
imperative that we complain endlessly; oth

erwise someone might actually take initiative
and burn the place down. Heaven forbid
anyone complain about real problems on
campus such as dining service wage dispari
ties. Besides, it's good training for the "luxu
ry" problems that the bulk of us will confront
in our otherwise golden futures. By the way,
thanks, Mr. Becker, for listing them for us:
wrong meals at restaurants, broken buttons
from the cleaners, lah-di-dah — •
His rantings from the soapbox may not be
profound, but at least they're funny. So leave
Dan Geyser alone.

Respect Comm majors
I am writing in response to Dan Geyser's
column, "Karma in the Sixth Man line."
Specifically, I wish to address his comments
about communications majors.
Geyser states, "My group was thinking
about hiring some communication majors to
hold our spots in line. I mean hey. they might
as well be doing nothing there as opposed to
doing nothing somewhere else. We'd bring
them food and beer, and of course, monetary
compensation."
Dan Geyser, I think you have no clue
what a communication major does.
There is a lot more than Comm 1 to the
major. How many upper-level communica
tion classes have you taken? How many
films have you made? How many articulate
news articles have you written? How many
research projects on the psychological pro

cessing of the media have you worked on? I
suspect you have done little if any work in
the field.
Political science is only b<) units. Even as a
senior you should be able to take a real com
munication class to see that we don't have
time to sit on line while the Kappa Schmeg
mas pay us off with beer.
Perhaps you don't get to make movies in
your classes, study the Internet and the
telecommunications industry or investigate
the effects of television on children.
Just because something is entertaining to
study does not mean it is no work. I think
next time you poke fun at a department and
its students you should know what you are
talking about.

Give us the whole enchilada
While Joe Siedel made many excellent
points in his Oct. 11 letter regarding revision
of the ticket policy, his conclusion is incor
rect. Many people who waited in line this
weekend are less interested in basketball
than in belonging to the nationally
reknowned Sixth Man Club. There is no rea
son to believe, however, that seniors as a
whole are better fans than freshmen.
When I entered Stanford last year, I
couldn't name the starters on our basketball
team. By the time I attended the regional
finals in St. Louis after going to all the home
games as a Sixth Man member, though. I
could name all the players. The only way to

become an avid, knowledgeable fan is to
attend many games, but under Siedel's sys
tem, few freshmen would be able to do this.
Siedel's characterization of the "hard
core" camping fans is also correct. As good
as the basketball team was last year finishing
fourth, five other Stanford teams won
NCAA Championships last year. Over a
dozen of our teams finish in the top five in
the country consistently, yet attendance for
these sports is a small fraction of basketball's
attendance. Many of the people camping this
weekend were Stanford men's basketball
Sixth Man Club fans.
Considering the quality of our athletic
programs, Stanford fans should attend a vari
ety of sporting events. I have seen 21 of our
33 teams compete. I plan to see every team
which competes on campus at least once.
Last year, the Whole Enchilada ticket
plan included basketball tickets, in addition
to tickets for all the other sports on campus.
Buying this package encouraged me to see
teams and games which I might not have
seen if they weren't included with basketball
and football.
The Athletics Department should include
basketball tickets in the package in the
future. Including basketball tickets in a pack
age would encourage people to see the other
sports in the package.
People who only want to be in the Sixth
Man Club can take their chances with a sale
or lottery of any left-over tickets, and mean :
while, true Stanford Fans can continue to
have the whole, not the partial enchilada.
