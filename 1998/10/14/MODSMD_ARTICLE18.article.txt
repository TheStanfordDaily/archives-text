# Deep Thoughts
## Follow these six easy steps to popularity 
### 
Brittney Jensen

DID YOU THINK popularity games
ended in high school? If you were
too unattractive, unathletic or too
smart for your home town's social scene,
now is your second chance. The rules for
social ascendancy at Stanford are similar to
those in operation at high schools and junior
highs across the country, but here the sys
tem has been a little more institutionalized.
In six easy steps, how to be wildly popular:
1) Get Drunk
Get really drunk. Get drunk six nights a
week. Get drunk during CIV section and
the night before finals. While intoxicated,
repeat the phrase "I'm sooooo drunk!"
every 10 minutes. The next morning, wear
sunglasses in the rain whether or not your
eyes are red. Tell everyone how drunk you
were the night before.
This step can also be interpreted as get
stoned / shroomed / high on White-Out,
depending on the crowd you're hanging
with.
2) Hook Up
Hook up publicly and often. Tell every

one all the details of your numerous roman
tic escapades. But he very careful whom you
hook up with. He must be hot and belong to
a preferred fraternity / varsity athletic team.
Imagine the joy of walking home across the
Phi Delt parking lot in the morning know
ing everyone's saying, "Oh. she hooked up
with that hot guv."
Hot athletes vary, depending on the sea
son and current statistics, but usually water
polo, volleyball and football (if he's not too
meaty) are safe bets. For preferred fraterni
ty choices, see step number four. If your boy
of choice fits into neither the athlete nor
Greek God category, it is imperative that he
owns a small country and buys you lots of
jewelry.
3) Join a Sorority
Unlike our sisters at state schools, hot
Stanford girls must wait until spring quarter
to find out who their friends really are. Until
then, you can flatter upperclassmen by
soliciting their opinions on the hottest
sorority.
After you officially affiliate, any time you
reach a lull in conversation with any hot

boy. you can impress him with. "Isn't our
pledge class hot?" or "Remember when we
had the GetDrunkAndScrew (substitute
appropriate party) with you guys? 1 was
soooo drunk!"
Some girls might tell you the sororities
are intended to foster female bonding and
community service. They may even mean it.
Don't let these well-meaning but naive girls
distract you from your quest for social
ascendancy.
4) Associate with a Preferred Fraternity
Eat all the meals that you can at the
house. Eat outside so everyone can see you.
Tell everyone how many meals you eat
there. Be seen with the fraternity's mem
bers in White Plaza. Make as many walks of
shame from the house as possible.
This is a tricky step to execute properly,
as the preferred fraternity can change at any
moment. The variation is often seasonal,
revolving around Disco, Jungle or whatever
invite party is forthcoming. Also consider:
a) what house your sorority sisters sleep at;
b) who has the hottest pledge class; c) which
house is not on probation: d) who has the

best popsicles / cookie dough in the freezer.
5) Don't Study
Never go to lecture, or at least tell every
one you never go to lecture. Tell everyone
how you got drunk instead of taking your
midterm. Tell everyone you got into Stan
ford because your dad knows the football
coach and explain that the excellence of the
Stanford Shopping Center was the key to
your college decision.
Pick your classes and major according to
the hotness of the involved guys. Remem
ber, water polo practice is 3 p.m. to 5 p.m..
and Wednesday night is Bar night.
6) Never Trust the Enemy
Remember that every girl at Stanford is
competing for your popularity quotient.
Make fun of her clothes. Deride her
boyfriend's shortness / unpreferred fraterni
ty membership. Tell all the boys about her
cellulite. Only be nice to girls who know hot
guys you can hook up with.
That's how to be the most wanted girl at
Stanford. Just follow these simple and easy

steps, and you will never be left without an
invite to any social function.
Oh no, you ask, won't following these
rules make me shallow and superficial?
Don't worry, you can't he shallow. You
go to Stanford.
On selected occasions, simply mention
how much you love some obscure poet.
Complain about the rampant consumerism
in modern society while shopping for for
mals. Call other people's beliefs simplistic.
Then you will be deep as well as popular.
Remember, you don't have to be attrac
tive. athletic or interesting to succeed in this
game, although having at least one of these
attributes will aid in your kick-off. Just fol
low the rules and stay focused on what real
ly counts for a satisfying Stanford experi
ence. and you can be queen of the Stanford
social scene.

have hosted a "What Would You Do?"
party to distribute Sixth Man tickets.
