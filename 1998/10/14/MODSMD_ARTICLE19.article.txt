### Ramona Shelburne 
Sometimes when expectations
are high for a team, any perfor
mance that falls short of those ex
pectations is disappointing.
The Stanford men's golf team
has finished in the top four in each
of its first three fall tournaments this
year, a solid showing indeed, yet the
Cardinal came away from all three
tournaments disappointed because
quality teams are marked hv the
fact that they expect to win every
event they play in.

â–  Yesterday: Wolfpack Classic -
Stanford finishes fourth with an 883
(+l9).

The Cardinal entered yester
day's final round of the Wolfpack
Classic in Carson City, Nev., in third
place, one stroke back of the lead,
and ended the day in fourth place,
19 shots off the winning pace set by
Pacific 10 Conference rival Oregon
State. Although the fourth-place
finish showed the Cardinal to be a
talented team, Stanford would have
liked to finish the tournament on a
high note with a win.
"The talent's there, we're going
to be OK" said head coach Wallv
