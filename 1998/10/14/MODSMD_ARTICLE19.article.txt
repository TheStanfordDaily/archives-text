## Behind the pack Cardinal takes 4th in Reno 
### Ramona Shelburne 
Sometimes when expectations
are high for a team, any perfor
mance that falls short of those ex
pectations is disappointing.
The Stanford men's golf team
has finished in the top four in each
of its first three fall tournaments this
year, a solid showing indeed, yet the
Cardinal came away from all three
tournaments disappointed because
quality teams are marked hv the
fact that they expect to win every
event they play in.

■ Yesterday: Wolfpack Classic -
Stanford finishes fourth with an 883
(+l9).

The Cardinal entered yester
day's final round of the Wolfpack
Classic in Carson City, Nev., in third
place, one stroke back of the lead,
and ended the day in fourth place,
19 shots off the winning pace set by
Pacific 10 Conference rival Oregon
State. Although the fourth-place
finish showed the Cardinal to be a
talented team, Stanford would have
liked to finish the tournament on a
high note with a win.
"The talent's there, we're going
to be OK" said head coach Wallv
Goodwin.
For the second time in two
weeks, the Cardinal saved its worst
for last and missed an opportunity
to come away with a victory. Yes
terday's round of 17-over-par (305)
was the highest of the Cardinal's
three rounds and dropped it out of
contention for the victory.
Yesterday's performance also
exposed the Cardinal's inexperi
ence in dealing with the elements.
With strong winds affecting play,
the Cardinal once again had to do
battle with mother nature.
"We've had difficulty playing in
the wind, we're not used to playing
in it on the Stanford Golf Course."
said Goodwin.
The Cardinal will have to learn
to play in the wind in order to con
tend this year. Since it can not prac
tice at Stanford, its tournament
play and the experience of players
such as Joel Kribel and Jimmy Lee
with the wind becomes especially
important.
Kribel and Lee have been Stan
ford's most consistent performers
this year. Kribel, a senior All-Amer
ican, has twice finished in the top
three and finished this week's tour
nament in a tie for eighth place with
a 217 (+1). Sophomore Jimmy Lee
has finished in the top 17 in all three
tournaments and turned in his best
performance of the year this week
by finishing in a tie for 12th place
with a three-over-par 219.
Lee turned in the Cardinal's
best round of the tournament,
recording a 70 on Monday, and its
best round on Tuesday with a 73.
Lee is also Stanford's most experi
enced golfer in the wind and it has
showed.
Kribel was the Cardinal's high
est finisher in eighth place and has
been its best overall performer this
season. Kribel came into the final
round tied for third place but a
double bogey on the last hole
dropped him from the top three.
