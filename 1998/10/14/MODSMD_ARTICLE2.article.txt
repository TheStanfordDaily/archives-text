# Laughlin awarded Nobel
## Prize Stanford's fourth in a row 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
"Dad, there's some guy from
Sweden who wants to talk to you,"
Robert Laughlin's son Todd told
him at 4 o'clock yesterday morning.
Based on recent Stanford histo
ry, Laughlin should have known
who was calling.
When he picked up the phone,
Laughlin learned that he was the
fourth Stanford professor to win or
share the Nobel Prize in physics in
as many years.
Laughlin is sharing the award
with Columbia Prof. Horst Stormer
and Princeton Prof. Daniel Tsui.

and low temperatures, Stormer and
Tsui observed that electrons acting
collectively in strong magnetic fields
could form new types of particles
with charges much weaker than elec
trons.
A year later, Laughlin succeeded
in explaining their results. He showed
that those lighter particles were in
fact electrons that had been con
densed to form a kind of quantum liq
uid, similar to those occuring in su
perconductivity and liquid helium.
Laughlin, the Ann and Robert
Bass Professor of Physics and Ap
plied Physics, is proud of his work
not for its immediate usefulness but
for its lesson that "the world is full of
new things, things we don't under
stand."
The discovery, known as the
Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, "is
not going to make technology to
morrow," Laughlin emphasized.
"The effect is so delicate, and real
life technology requires things at
room temperature that can get
banged around and not be hurt."
University President Gerhard
Casper noted that Nobel Prizes in
Physics have become almost routine
at Stanford.
"Last year, when [Physics Prof.]
Steve Chu won, I was in Stockholm,
and people said to me, 'you are from
the university where they give all the
Nobel Prizes in Physics,'" Casper
said. "Little did they know that that
made only three in a row, and now
we have four."
Laughlin admits that, while the
award was a surprise, he "knew for a
long time that these experiments
were of historic proportion."

Laughlin, who has been at Stan
ford since 1989, conducted the re
search that led to his prize at AT&T
Bell Laboratories, as did Stanford's
past two physics winners. Physics
Prof. Steven Chu and Physics Prof.
Doug Osheroff. The lab has dimin
ished greatly in size and scope since
the AT&T conglomerate was split
up into the "Baby Bells" in 1984.
"Back when we were at Bell Labs
... the funding could be used for
anything that was considered good
science," said Osheroff. "Then, after
Bell was split up, it became much
more highly focused and you had to
produce a product."
Laughlin laments the reduction
of Bell Labs and other large, well
funded corporate labs such as Xerox
and IBM.
"The benefits we're reaping
today are from investments made
long ago, and those same invest
ments are not being made now," he
said. "I'm pessimistic about people
of the next generation being where I
am now."
"I accuse my generation of allow
ing this to end," he emphasized.
The Fractional Quantum Hall Ef
fect, is "difficult to explain," accord
ing to Laughlin's postdoctoral
physics student Martin Greiter.
"Usually, in a system made of
electrons, the electrons are also the
elementary particles entering the
field," he said, "In the Quantum Hall
Effect, there is an instant where the
electrons condense into a fluid
An elementary particle in this sys
tem is like one-third of an electron.
You start with one type of particle
and end up with a fraction of that
particle."
Casper also pointed out the in
ternational nature of this year's
award.

"Bob is a Califomian, Stormer
was born and educated in Germany,
and Tsui was born in China and is
now an American citizen. It shows
how great American universities are
attracting talent from all over the
world, and 1 speak with all the au
thority of my accent," said the Ger
man-born Casper.
Laughlin, 47, obtained his doctor
ate in physics from MIT in 1979.
After working at Bell Labs from
1979 to 1981, he did research at
Lawrence Livermore National Lab
oratory from 1981 to 1982 before
coming to Stanford.
The school's four consecutive
awards "speaks to the strength of the
sciences at Stanford and the impor
tance of academic research," said
Robert Bass, chair of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, and the man for
whom Laughlin's endowed profes
sorship is named.
Laughlin noted that he almost
missed yesterday morning's phone
call entirely.
"As my wife says, it turns out Mr.
Physics Professor can't fix his
phone," because the one in our room
hadn't been working for a while," he
said.
After a few rings, his son picked it
up on the Mickey Mouse-shaped
phone in his room.
According to Laughlin, his third
of the $978,000 prize is "about
enough to buy some nice furniture."
As for next year, should another
Stanford physics professor be ex
pecting a call from Sweden in the
middle of the night?
"When I came to Stanford, there
were a number of PNLs, or pre-
Nobel Prize winners, but now
they've all gotten [the prize]," said
Osheroff.
"But after all, you never know,"
