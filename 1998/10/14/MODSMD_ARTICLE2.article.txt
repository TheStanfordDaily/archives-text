"Dad, there's some guy from
Sweden who wants to talk to you,"
Robert Laughlin's son Todd told
him at 4 o'clock yesterday morning.
Based on recent Stanford histo
ry, Laughlin should have known
who was calling.
When he picked up the phone,
Laughlin learned that he was the
fourth Stanford professor to win or
share the Nobel Prize in physics in
as many years.
Laughlin is sharing the award
with Columbia Prof. Horst Stormer
and Princeton Prof. Daniel Tsui.
