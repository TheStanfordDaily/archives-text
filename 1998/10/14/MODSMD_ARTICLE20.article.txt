# Card passing attack keeps team hopeful
## 
### Courntey Mann Senior staff writer 
If the disheartened 1-5 Stanford football
squad is looking for something to smile about,
it does not have to look too far.
Despite having yet to win a conference
game this season, the Cardinal is putting up
huge passing numbers on offense, thanks to
the maturation of two promising receivers,
the return of record-setting playmaker Troy
Walters from an ankle injury and the growth
of redshirt junior quarterback Todd Husak.
The Stanford passing attack, believe it or
not, ranks first in the conference and eighth in
the NCAA. In addition, the Cardinal wel
comes the redshirt junior Walters back from a
high ankle injury to join redshirt freshman
Dave Davis and redshirt sophomore Do Ron
nie Pitts to form a veritable three-headed
monster at the receiver position.
"It's nice to look out there and see the
three of them downfield," Husak said. "They
are quite a receiving corps."

'I would never say that having Troy
miss those games was a good
thing. But Dave and Deßonnie have
really stepped up and become a part
of this offense.'

The high-octane passing game was on dis
play in last week's disappointing 30-23 loss to
Oregon State as Husak and company set a
school record with 450 yards passing.
In addition, for the first time in Stanford
history, each of the three receivers went over
the 100-yard receiving mark for the game.
Walters's return against Oregon State last
week might have been spectacular were it not
for a few crucial special teams errors that cost
Stanford the game. The diminutive playmak
er hauled in five catches for a team-high 159
yards, many of them with two defenders on
his tail.
Despite the loss, head coach Tyrone Will
ingham noted the positive impact Walters
had on the offense in his return.
"I think it is very obvious that Troy made a
difference with his presence on the field.'
Willingham said. "He opened a lot of things
up for us and put a lot of pressure on them, al
lowing some other guys to step up and make

some plays. It really helped open things up for
the play of Deßonnie Pitts and Dave Davis
out wide."
"Troy made some spectacular catches out
there today." Husak said. "We are a tremen
dously better football team with him out
there on the field."
Yet Walters' success is expected. Alter all,
as a redshirt sophomore, Walters set school
records in receptions and receiving yards.
After Saturday's contest. Walters now ranks
ninth all-time at Stanford in receiving yards.
What is more remarkable, however, is the
development of the other two young re
ceivers, Pitts and Davis, in the absence of
Walters.
With 40 catches, 604 receiving yards and
five touchdowns in his first season. Davis is
off to the best start in Stanford receiving his
tory. His 6.7 catches per game rank him
fourth in the Pacific 10 Conference and 17th
in the nation, and his 100.7 yards per game
place him third in the conference and 21st in
the NCAA.
He ranks first among all freshman — true
or redshirt — in the nation in both categories.
In the record-setting fireworks against the
Beavers, Davis caught nine passes for 151
yards and a touchdown.
Not to be outdone, Pitts emerged during
the four games which Walters missed as Stan
ford's go-to receiver. Alter a rookie season in
which he caught nine passes for 135 yards and
a touchdown. Pitts has now handed in three
consecutive 100-yard receiving games.
Against OSU. Pitts recorded a team-high
nine catches for 124 yards and a touchdown.
For the season, Pitts ranks second in the Pac
-10 and ninth in the nation with 7.7 catches per
game.
"I would never say that having Troy miss
those games was a good thing." Husak said.
"But Dave and Deßonnie have really
stepped up and become a part of this of
fense."
Davis and Pitts are on pace to become the
first duo in Stanford history to reach the
1.000-yard mark in the same season.
The frightening aspect is that most of these
numbers have been registered without Wal
ters on the field. The passing attack should be
that much more successful with Walters at
tracting attention from defenses.
"Troy's a threat that everyone has to re
spect," Davis said. "That works in [my and
Deßonnie's] favor. I could see
OSU shading to Troy's side. Our
offense gets the ball to the guy who
is open, and Troy gives us another
man who can get open."
Walters agreed that the three of
them could pose serious problems
for defenses in the upcoming
games.
"I don't know if many defenses
out there will be able to stop us,"
Walters said. "If they try to focus on
any one of us, the other two guys
will have big days."
And as Walters noted, each of
them brings a different game to the
Cardinal offense.
"I think of myself as an explosive
receiver who can make big plays
downfield," Walters said. "Dave is
really talented and athletic, a guy
who you can just throw it up to.
Deßonnie is really dependable and
sure-handed, but he can definitely
break out downfield also."
In addition, the 6-foot Davis and
5-11 Pitts give the Cardinal a size
advantage which it has not had in
recent years.
"We have to be well-rounded
out there," Walters said. "We try to
be physical when we have to be and

to have finesse when we need that."
Husak himself has perhaps been
the biggest beneficiary of the suc
cess of the receivers. Starting for
the first time in his Stanford career,
Husak is vying to break into some
serious company with his passing
numbers this season.
The junior is threatening to join
the likes of John Elway and Steve
Stenstrom in single-season totals
for pass completions and passing
yards. His 298.8 yards per game
rank him second in the conference
and 11th in the nation, and his 450-
yard performance against Oregon
State broke a school record.
But neither Husak nor his re
ceivers want to hear about school
records or conference passing rank
ings.
"The only numbers I care about
is that we are 1-5," Davis said after
the OSU loss. "We are here to win."
The next chance Stanford has to
nab a conference win is a week
from Thursday at Arizona State (2-
4,1-2), a team that ranks just eighth
in the Pac-10 in passing defense.
If the Cardinal defense can hold
up as it did last week against the
Beavers, and Stanford can shore up
the special teams blunders that cost
them the game, Davis and the rest
of the Stanford passing game might
have a victory to smile about.
