# Field hockey opens road trip with victory
## 5-0 shutout win against Vermont extends team's winning streak to six 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
Last Saturday Pacific did what only four
other teams have been able to do against the
Cardinal women's field hockey team this sea
son: score a goal. Vermont, however, was not so
lucky. Stanford decided one was enough.
Yesterday Stanford (9-2) continued its win
ning ways, soundly defeating the University of
Vermont (5-7), 5-0. The victory extends the
Cardinal's win streak to six games and put an
end to Vermont's two-game winning streak.
As in the game against Pacific, both teams
were locked in a scoreless tie for the first 10
minutes. However, once Stanford found its
rhythm, its two leading scorers, seniors
Monique Leroux and Carey C'loyd, played tag
team on Vermont's defense.
With 11:30 remaining in the first half, for
ward Cloyd sparked Stanford's assault with her
sixth goal of the season. Although there were
still over 40 minutes of play left in the game,
Vermont had to be concerned. The Cardinal
has yet to lose a game when it scores a goal.
Determined to make her team victorious,
less than a minute later Cloyd set up Leroux for
the Cardinal's second goal of the game. With
the assist Cloyd raised her season total to four
and her overall point total to 14, the team's sec
ond best.
In the closing minutes half, Leroux made
one final stab at Vermont's defense. Scoring
unassisted, she recorded her team-high ninth
goal of the year and sixth in the last four games.
It did not take Stanford as long to warm up
in the second half. Six minutes in, senior mid
fielder Jordvn Kramer scored her third goal of
the season and upped her team's lead to four,
matching Saturday's team goal total.
Although victorv was close at hand, the Car

dinal did not relent. With less than two minutes
remaining in the game senior sweeper Lissy
Goralnik sent one final shot past Vermont
goalie Mindv Vinelli.
Though the territory may have been unfa
miliar for Stanford, the result was not. The Car
dinal allowed just one shot on goal, which was
aptly converted into sophomore goalie Meg
Crowley's only save. Meanwhile, the offense
continued to find holes in the opposition's de
fense. With the victory, Stanford has 33 goals
on the season, 22 more than its opponents.
Today the Cardinal faces a red-hot North
eastern team on Parsons Field in Boston.
Northeastern is 6-6 overall and 2-1 in the Amer
ica East Conference, but has yet to play a team
from the Pacific 10 Conference Northern Divi
sion this season.

WOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY
■ Yesterday: Stanford ( l )-2) 5, Vermont (5-7) (J.
■ Today: Stanford at Northwestern (6-6), 12
p.m.

Northeastern's recent match results show
startling similarities to the Cardinal's accom
plishments. After starting the season just 1-5,
the Huskies have won five of their last six
games. During that span Northeastern has
shown strong signs on both sides of the field.
Defensively, each of the Huskies' victories
has been bolstered by a shutout. Also, Stan
ford's defense will be put to the test by a North
eastern offense that tied its season high with six
goals against Providence on Saturday.
Northeastern is led by Heidi Benson and Hi
lary McHugh. whose combined 38 points is just
shy of Leroux and Cloyd's 40. However, Husky
goalie Kathleen Madaus's 56 saves is double
that of Crowley's 28 saves.
