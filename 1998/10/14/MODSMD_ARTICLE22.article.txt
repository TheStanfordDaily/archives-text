As far as most true Stanford basketball
fans are concerned, the season com
mences this Friday night at Maples Pavil
ion. For the first time ever, the men's and
women's basketball teams are putting on
their own version of "Midnight Madness."
The night will be called "Cardinal Chaos"
and doors open at 9:45 p.m..

MEN'S & WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL
■ Friday: Cardinal Chaos. Maples Pavilion,
9:45 p.m.

According to the team's marketing di
rector Jaime Zaninovich. 4,000 to 5.000
are expected to be at Maples to welcome
the two teams begin their 1998-99 seasons.

The first 750 people to arrive and enter
after the doors are opened at will re
ceive free T-shirts.
All fans will be issued ticket numbers
and will have an opportunity to win a road
trip with the team to Washington. D.C. as
well as free tuition and books for a quarter
— simply sink a three-quarter court shot
in front of S,(XX) screaming fans.
Following the awards and beginning
around 11:30 p.m. the teams will be an
nounced in conjunction with a visual high
light show from last year. Next comes a
three-point shooting contest for the
women's team and a dunk contest for the
men. Mark Madsen, David Moseley, Kris
Wecms and Mark Seaton are most likely
to be involved. At midnight both teams
will hold a brief scrimmage to bring the
night to a close.
Zaninovich said that the team has

talked about this kind of a season-opening
display for several years, hut never quite
had enough push for it. Reaching the Final
Four last year and having 12 returning
players as well as two solid freshmen has
provided more than enough push.
The men's team has been ranked No. I
in four different preseason polls and in the
top five of all others that have been re
leased. Their talent no doubt will be tested
as they go up against programs such as
Temple, Maryland and ( onnecticut in the
nonconference season and UCLA and
Arizona in Pacific 10 Conference play,
California and Washington are also ex
pected to have solid squads this year.
"It should be a great night to kick off
the season and feel the support of all of oyj
fans," Madsen said. "We know this vear

there are a lot of expectations but we
feel ready for the challenge."
Senior Peter Sauer agrees. "The
fans will get to see us early on in an
exciting setting. It will be good for
players and fans alike," he said.
Most every player, fan and analyst
agrees that "Midnight Madness,"
ever since its recent surge, has been
beneficial to all of college basketball.
In a way it symbolizes two important,
but somewhat clashing, themes. On
the one side there is the increasing
strictness of NCAA rules and on the
other there is the growing excitement
and enthusiasm for college basket

hall, no doubt spurred on by ever-ex
panding television coverage.
The two come together all over
the country Friday when fans eagerly
wait to charge into their home arenas
and welcome their squads on literally
the first minute the NCAA allows
them to practice. ESPN will once
again capture the excitement by tele
vising from arenas all over the nation.
Zaninovich and the team do not
quite expect the kind of turnout a
Kentucky or Duke or North Caroli
na will get, as these three, among
other powerhouses of the East and
South, have been filling their arenas
for years. But with excitement build
ing every minute for the season to
begin, Cardinal fans may surprise
some people around the nation.
