# Senate considers judicial changes
## 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
Last night, the ASSU Senate
discussed potential changes to the
Stanford's Student Conduct Penal
ty Code, which determines punish
ments levied on students found to
violate the Honor Code, Funda
mental Standard, or other rules or
policies governing student con
duct.
The Judicial Board, which over
sees the code, has proposed
amendments and new bylaws to
clarify the charter and determine
how it operates. These changes
would refine the new charter
adopted on Jan. 1, 1998.
Now the ASSU has the option
to either veto the recommended
changes or send them on to the
Faculty Senate.
But at this meeting the senators
decided to delay consideration of
the measure.
" The University prides itself on
our Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code, and the Judicial
Charter is an integral part of the in
tegrity of Stanford and Stanford
students." explained senior Maren
Norton. ASSU president. "These
bylaws and amendments to the
penalty code are very important
and merit further discussion."
Also, the senators tabled an
amendment that modified how
fines would be assessed to guilty
students.
The amendment clarified that
fines could not be imposed except
as restitution and that whatever en
tity was imposing the fines had to
provide documentation listing rea

sons behind the eharges. Under the
amendment, fines could not be im
posed to pay for the investigation
or judicial hearing.
"The purpose of the amend
ment is to bring the concerns to the
floor that the financial penalty cre
ates a conflict of interest and gives
insufficient regard to the financial
status of a student," said ASSU
Senator Dave Robinson, a chem
istry graduate student.
The amendment, according to
Robinson, was based on concern
over a previous policy. As some Ju
dicial Board members had ex
plained to him, the standard penal
ty for an honor code violation cur
rently is a $100 fine, 40 hours of
community service, a one-quarter
suspension, a letter of censure and
no credit for a course in which aca
demic integrity is questioned.
Before voting on the issue,
ASSU senators hope to work out
desired changes with the Judicial
Board.
According to Robinson. ASSU
Senators Vladimir Jevremovic and
William Intner, law students, will
meet with the board's chairman
within the next two weeks to dis
cuss proposed reforms.
Robinson said he hopes the
amendment will be voted on at the
next meeting.
"We don't expect this to drag on
a long time [or] to create a whole
lot of conflict," Robinson said.
"We're not addressing the funda
mental aspects [of the code)."
The proposed judicial changes,
