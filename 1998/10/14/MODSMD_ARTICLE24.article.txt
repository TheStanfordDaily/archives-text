# Assemblyman holds office hours
## Lempert chats in White Plaza 
### Marisa Pavlik 
Democratic Assemblyman Ted
Lempert brought his re-election
campaign to the Farm yesterday,
talking with students about topics
ranging from his support for char
ter schools to earthquake insurance
for apartment residents.
He has been making himself ac
cessible to the public through office
hours about twice a year in each of
the 13 cities in the 21st Assembly
District.
"We get a lot of e-mail, phone
calls and letters at the office but not
a lot of people walking in," Lem
pert said, noting that his office is
only 15 minutes from campus on El
Camino Way.
Senior Steve Mecias, president
of the Stanford Democrats, said it's
important for Lempert to spend
time on campus "to get the view
points of students here who live in
his district and for students to un
derstand what a [California] assem
blyman does, since most students
are from other states," he said.
Because Lempert graduated
from Stanford Law School in 1986,
Mecias added, "he's a perfect per
son to understand how he can help
students here."
One of Lempert's most impor
tant issues is K-12 public education.
"I am a product of it, and we're try
ing to bring excellence back to the
school system," he said.
As The chair of the Higher Edu
cation Committee, which oversees
California colleges and universi
ties, Lempert has worked to make

higher education more affordable.
"Last year, there was a signifi
cant increase in both the number
and amount of Cal Grants," he said.
Cal Grants are a state-run finan
cial aid system, providing both in
come and merit-based scholarships
for California residents going to
public and private universities.
Lempert is concerned about
Stanford's "lack of overall student
political activity," he said.
"Of course, there are a number
of exceptions. However, students
can and should get a lot more in
volved and play a major role in

campaigns.
"I'd like to see students here get
more engaged, put pressure on
policies and get more involved," he
said.

I'd like to see students
here get more engaged, put
pressure on policies and
get more involved'

Lempert added that his office

offers internships.
Lempert said he may come back
to Stanford if students organize a
candidate event before the Nov. 3
election.
Lempert served in the State As
sembly from 1988 to 1992, before
his 20th District was eliminated due
to reapportionment. He was re
elected to the Assembly in the 21st
District in 1996.
In the interim, he served on the
San Mateo County Board of Super
visors.
Lempert and his family reside in
San Carlos.
