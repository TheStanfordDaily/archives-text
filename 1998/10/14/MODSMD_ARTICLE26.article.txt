## Lab Watch Killer protein fights bacteria 
### Joanne Wu 
Collaborating with scientists from the Unit
ed States and Germany, Stanford researchers
have discovered a human immune system pro
tein that kills the bacteria that cause tuberculo
sis. This protein, granulysin, has the potential
to treat a disease that kills 3 million people
every year.
Alan Krensky, a Stanford professor of pedi
atrics, headed the Stanford research team.
"This is the first time an isolated T cell
molecule has been shown to directly kill
microbes," he said. "The fact that this molecule
kills the TB bacterium is very exciting."
The TB bacteria, Mycobacterium tubercu
losis, has proven highly resistant to antibiotics,
and bacterial mutation has reduced the effec
tiveness of the old BCG vaccine. A new treat
ment against TB would be invaluable.
Granulysin, naturally generated by the
body's own killer T cells, has been tested on TB
bacteria in lab cultures. The protein destroys
up to 90 percent of the bacteria within three
days. Krensky expressed hope that perhaps
"we could use granulysin as a therapeutic [for
TBJ directly or use the new information on
how it kills TB to design a new drug."
Granulysin was discovered in 1987 in a joint
effort by Krensky and Mark Davis, a Stanford
professor of microbiology and immunology.
The protein eliminated several target cells, but
its potency against microbes such as TB was
not yet known. Robert Modlin, professor of
dermatology at UCLA, then wrote a paper on
the effectiveness of an unknown molecule
derived from T cells in killing TB pathogens.
Collaborating with Modlin, Krensky was able
to confirm that the molecule was indeed gran
ulysin.
Working with both Modlin and Dennis
Hanson, a Stanford graduate student in
immunology, Krensky has published their
study of the mechanisms of granulysin's actions
in this month's Science.
Hanson is excited about the study's implica
tions for the future. "While this is an exciting
discovery that helps explain how the body
responds to M. tuberculosis, the leap to the
development of new therapeutics based on
these findings is large," he said. "This is not to
say it is an insurmountable one. Because TB is
a very large problem in the world, the investi
gation of any new potential therapies is war
ranted and this provides a starting point."
Currently, Krensky's lab is researching
whether granulysin will work in vivo, testing
the protein in live specimens. Using fluorescent
bacteria in animals, the effectiveness of gran
ulysin can be visualized by the disappearance
of fluorescent glow.
Meanwhile, another Stanford graduate stu
dent, Allan Kaspar, is studying the ability of
granulysin to kill tumor cells. So far, the gran
ulysin has been promising, destroying tumors
in cell cultures. "The biology is interesting —
studying a newly defined molecule of the T
cells, capable of killing both bacteria and
tumor cells," Kaspar said.
This research could also aid in new treat
ments for HIV, which infects the T cells, and in
new cancer therapies.
