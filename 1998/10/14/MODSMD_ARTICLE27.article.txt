# A 						whole lot happening at Hopkins Marine Station

Arriving at Hopkins Marine Station,
Stanford's marine biology research
facility, is breathtaking. After traversing
Monterey's Cannery Row, made
famous by John Steinbeck, visitors to
Hopkins are greeted with an incompa
rable view of Monterey Bay and the
Pacific Ocean.
The beauty of the surroundings, how
ever, is merely a background for the
tremendous amount of research that
takes place at Hopkins. Faculty and stu
dents at the marine station are exploring
fields such as cellular and developmen
tal biology, immunology, neurobiology,
comparative physiology, behavior, pop
ulation biology, biomechanics and ecol
ogy.
The station is located 90 miles south
of the main Stanford campus in Pacific
Grove. Calif., a picturesque little town
adjacent to Monterey. It sits on a rocky
headland known as Mussel Point, right
next to the famous Monterey Bay
Aquarium. Directly across the Bay are a
number of other well-respected marine

research institutions such as the Moss
Landing Marine Lab.
Hopkins was founded in 1892 after
Jane and Leland Stanford returned
from their tour of Italy, which included
a visit to the famous marine research
facility in Naples. Hopkins Marine Sta
tion was initially located closer to Can
nery Row. but was later moved to its
current site to avoid commercial traffic.
Now. the area offshore of the station is
protected by law as a marine reserve,
and hosts a wide variety of flora and
fauna.
Over the years, the station has
attracted a large number of renowned
researchers and has been extraordinari
ly productive. The station has a resident
faculty of nine biologists and a support
staff of 10 people.
Both undergraduate and graduate
students can be found at the station
year-round in pursuit of scientific
knowledge relating to marine biology.
( lasses for undergraduates are offered
most quarters, and many students enjoy
exploring the marine life of Monterey
Bay while scuba diving in a popular
Hopkins class.

Academics, however, are not the sta
tion's only claim to fame. Steinbeck
mentions Hopkins in Cannery Row as
the setting of some fanciful shenanigans,
while both President Clinton and Vice

President Gore toured the station dur
ing their visit to Monterey last June.
Students interested in spending a
quarter or a summer at Hopkins should
contact the Biology Department.
