# More than just the 'Chicken of the Sea'

Most people don't think a whole lot about tuna,
except in the context of sushi or a tuna sandwich. For
others, however, tuna are far more than just food.
Scientists at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine
Center have collaborated with the Monterev Bav

Aquarium to establish the Tuna Research and Con
servation Center.
One of the center's goals is to educate the general
public about tuna biology and conservation. Research
efforts at the tuna center focus on studying the specif
ic issues of tuna biology and fish-tagging in order to
conduct field studies.
Tunas are some of the most valuable fish in the
ocean today. The cost of one giant bluefin tuna can
range from $3,000 to $45,000 in the Tokyo seafood
market.
Due to the large size of the industry, there is a great
need for monitoring of tuna populations. This makes
solving the mystery of tuna migration essential for
managing the world's tuna population. The center has
concentrated on this mystery.
In order to track the tuna, Stanford professor and
co-director of the Tuna Research and Conservation
Center, Barbara Block, has helped develop a new
satellite tagging technology.
These new tags, called satellite pop-up tags, pop
free of the tuna at a preprogrammed time. The tags
then float up to the surface and transmit their accumu
lated data via satellite to scientists in the lab.
So far, this tagging program has proven extremely
successful. The results indicate that the technology
works and the survival rate of tagged tuna has been
fairly high.
Historically, only 13 percent of conventional
bluefin tags are recovered. With experiments conduct
ed over the last two years, however, researchers recov
ered data from 95 percent of all satellite tags.
Another type of tag is an archival tag, which is
implanted in the body cavity of a fish. It takes infor
mation through various sensors every two minutes.
The major limitation of the archival tags, though, has
been retrieving them after they are implanted. Most

tags need to he returned from commercial fisheries
after the fish has been caught again.
One significant issue in tagging is how the tags
affect the fish. Ideally, the tags would have a minimal
effect on the tuna's natural behavior. The scientists
also need to make sure that the actual implantation of
the tags does not harm the fish.
Traditionally, once the tuna are caught, they are
blindfolded and a hose is placed in their mouths to irri
gate them as the scientists implant tags.
The center is seeking funding through its "Tag a
Giant" program, in which sponsors pay for an archival
tag and its implantation into a bluefin tuna for a tax
deductible $1,500.
Stanford senior biology major Meghan Rollins has
been studying how to facilitate this process. Meghan
has "been working on studying the use of anesthesia
on the tuna and other fish" in conjunction with
researchers at the center.
"The dosage of the drugs used is extremely impor
tant," and the ability to reverse the effects of the anes
thesia is another key issue, Rollins said.
Another focus for researchers at the center is the
study of basic physiology of tunas. One characteristic
of especial interest is tunas' ability to conserve heat.
Tunas' endothermic ability allows for a much greater
power output compared to other fish of similar size.
Blood chemistry, muscle enzymes, metabolic rates
and the feeding patterns of the tuna are other hot top
ics.
The center also keeps species closely related to
tuna, such as the Pacific mackerel, in order to investi
gate tuna evolution.
The research at the Tuna Research and Conserva
tion Center continues to be extremely active and
researchers there hope it will yield even more impor
tant insights for the future.
