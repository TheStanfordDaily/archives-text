# New in vitro technique may help avoid multiple births

Women who are considering try
ing methods such as in vitro fertil
ization to get pregnant are ecstatic
when they learn they are finally car
rying a baby. However, they may be
somewhat overwhelmed if they are
carrying not only one baby, but
three, four or even five.
A promising new IVF technique
developed by researchers at Stan

ford greatly minimizes the risk of
multiple births that often arises with
traditional techniques.
At the annual meeting of the
American Society for Reproductive
Medicine in San Francisco last
Wednesday, researchers reported
that out of the first 30 women
involved in the IVF study, are
pregnant beyond the second
trimester, and one has already deliv
ered a baby.

The new technique uses an
enriched culture medium thut can
nurture embryos in the lab for live
days rather than the usual three.
Harry Behr, director of Stanford's
IVF and Assisted Reproductive
Technology Laboratory and assis
tant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology, formulated the special
ized culture medium.
"For infertility not treatable by
other means, this IVF technique

allows for a safe outcome and a
good pregnancy rate," Behr said.
In conventional IVF. doctors
typically transfer four or five
embryos to maximize the chances
that pregnancy will result. The new
IVF technique allows the doctor to
select the best subset of two
embryos to transfer into the uterus,
greatly reducing the odds of multi
ple pregnancies. If fewer embryos
are transplanted, fewer fetuses will
develop, saving mothers the deci
sion of whether to carry multiple
fetuses to term.
According to Behr, the probabil
ity of embryo implantation in the
uterus on day three is only 15 to 20
percent, while on day five the prob
ability is 55 percent.
Amin Milki, medical director of
Stanford's IVF program and associ
ate professor of gynecology and
obstetrics, transferred the embryos
to the uterus on the fifth day for
each of his patients. On day five,
doctors can tell by the number of
cells and the size and appearance of
the embryo whether or not it is like
ly to be viable, he said.
"The new culture system itself

doesn't make the embryos any bet
ter. This technique simply allows us
to weed out the bad embryos,"
Milki said.
By transferring the embryo on
day five, doctors are more closely
imitating nature's own timing. Behr
said. The embryo usually travels
through the fallopian tube to
implant in the uterus on day five.
Therefore, an embryo transferred
on day three is out of sync with its
normal environment.
"Under conventional IVF tech
niques, more than half of the
patients to which we transferred
embryos don't get pregnant, but we
didn't know why, because we can't
assess which embryos are viable at
day two," Milki said.
A potential application of this
technique is that it can also be used
as a diagnostic tool.
"This new technique tells us if
the reason for infertility is an egg
factor, something is intrisically
wrong with the egg," Behr said. "If
the embryo doesn't develop to that
stage on day five, we can then sug
gest that the patient consider adop
tion or the use of a donor egg."

One patient in the study, Cather
ine McMillan of Menlo Park. Cali
fornia, said that for the past three
years she has tried other techniques
to get pregnant with no success. She
was initially wary of IVF because of
the risk of multiple births and the
ethical issues associated with it.
"I knew that Stanford wouldn't
get us into the situation where we
would end up with septuplets,"
McMillan said.
McMillan decided to try the blas
tocyst approach this past March and
opted to have only two embryos
transferred. She is now expecting to
give birth to a baby in the middle of
November.
Milki states that this new IVF
technique should be widely avail
able.
"Many clinics are already using
modifications of this technique in
Europe and across the country."
Milki said.
"People have known for a while
that it is better to wait for the
embryo to develop until the fifth
day, so the concept itself is not new.
The culture system which is effec
tive is what is new."
