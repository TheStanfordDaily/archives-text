# Left with tickets for only three in four, groups struggle to name the Sixth Men

The aftershock of the sudden
shutdown of the Maples shantytown
still has many Stanford basketball
fans reeling, as groups scramble to al
locate the too lew tickets to their
members.
On Sunday, the Department of
Athletics decided to turn away the
crowds camped outside of Maples
Pavilion for basketball tickets and
award each registered group with
enough tickets for three-quarters of
its members. In addition, only two
thirds of those allotments will be for

the coveted Sixth Man Club, a special
courtside student section.
*'1 think it was fun for a while, but
I got the sense that people were
happy to go home," said Jamie Zani
novich, marketing and operations di
rector for the basketball team. "Our
hope was that people would figure
out some way to share [the tickets]."
The Kappa Sigma fraternity has
managed to reach a consensus on
sharing the tickets they were allotted.
They were the first group in line out
side of Maples last week.
"We gave some shirts to people
[outside of the fraternity) who helped
out — the ones who actually con

tributed a fair amount," said junior
Kevin McElroy. "We're going to
share the rest of them with the whole
house."
Kappa Sigma started their round
the-clock campout last Monday,
since it occurred to them that other
houses were planning on doing the
same thing, according to McElroy.
Junipero and Donner, both all
freshman dormitories, joined the line
on Tuesday and Wednesday respec
tively.
"We're all pretty disappointed."
said freshman C raig Baumgartner,
who orchestrated the Junipero sleep
out contingent. "We already had a

schedule for the week worked out —
now 15 people from our group are
going to get shut out."
Junipero opted not to try to share
the tickets, as it would be "too much
work to try to coordinate," according
to Baumgartner.
The consensus was to hold a lot
tery for the 6() interested residents
after giving a ticket to the two group
leaders and to those who devoted the
most time to the wait, such as fresh
man Jason Walters, who slept out
since last Tuesday.
Alternatively, Donner made the
decision to involve their resident fel
low, who they thought would be
"most objective," according to fresh
man Wilhemina Hardy.
Donner residents will fill out a sur
vey that rates "how badly they want
the ticket, how much effort they feel
they contributed, and which five peo
ple deserve tickets the most," she
said.
"1 think it will come down to a few
hard-core people who will get their
own [Sixth Man] shirts. The others
will end up sharing," Hardy said.
Many, however, were disappoint
ed with the decision.
"I think the people in the front of
the line got a kind of weak deal," said
McElroy. "We had our master plan
all set. I think it worked out well for
people [at the end of the line) who
would have gotten nothing, but I still
wish [the Athletics Department! had

just let it go."
"I see the situation as I would see
any other kind of line — if you get to
a movie after it's sold out. that's just
the way it goes," Hardy said.
McElroy, as well as Baumgartner,
admits that the past week's efforts
have been "kind of a waste."
Not every group had the same
frustrating experience. Senior D. P.
Buck managed to finagle a ticket
without even waiting in line.
"Our group was called 'We're
Last' because that's what we were,
last in line," Buck said. 'My friend
and I registered with 13 graduate stu
dents on Friday, but we left because
we figured we had no chance."
While others felt short-changed
after waiting for a week, Buck and his
group were "pretty psyched" when
they got an e-mail telling them that
they could have tickets since they had
registered.
The Athletics Department,
though pleased at the support shown
this year, hopes to initiate measures

in the future to prevent the same kind
of situation from occurring.
"In hindsight I think we should
have anticipated this," Zaninovich
said. "There's all sorts of ways we
could change it in the future — we
could do straight lotteries among the
students, or maybe seven- or eight
game plans that would include cer
tain games, or we might just go by se
niority."
As punctuation on the madness of
the past week. ( 'ardinal C'haos, a gala
event to celebrate the first basketball
practice, will take place as planned on
Friday night.
Fans will have a chance to shoot
for prizes, like a road trip with the
team or tuition and books for a quar
ter.
While many of those involved feel
a sense of relief that sleeping out has
ended, others will miss the thrill.
"It was fun — I wish it was still
going on." said McElroy. "It added a
whole dimension to the pledge
process."
