The aftershock of the sudden
shutdown of the Maples shantytown
still has many Stanford basketball
fans reeling, as groups scramble to al
locate the too lew tickets to their
members.
On Sunday, the Department of
Athletics decided to turn away the
crowds camped outside of Maples
Pavilion for basketball tickets and
award each registered group with
enough tickets for three-quarters of
its members. In addition, only two
thirds of those allotments will be for

the coveted Sixth Man Club, a special
courtside student section.
*'1 think it was fun for a while, but
I got the sense that people were
happy to go home," said Jamie Zani

Kevin McElroy. "We're going to
share the rest of them with the whole
house."
Kappa Sigma started their round

since it occurred to them that other
houses were planning on doing the
same thing, according to McElroy.
Junipero and Donner, both all
freshman dormitories, joined the line
on Tuesday and Wednesday respec
tively.
"We're all pretty disappointed."
said freshman C raig Baumgartner,
who orchestrated the Junipero sleep
out contingent. "We already had a

schedule for the week worked out —
now 15 people from our group are
going to get shut out."
Junipero opted not to try to share
the tickets, as it would be "too much
work to try to coordinate," according
to Baumgartner.
The consensus was to hold a lot
tery for the 6() interested residents
after giving a ticket to the two group
leaders and to those who devoted the
most time to the wait, such as fresh
man Jason Walters, who slept out
since last Tuesday.
Alternatively, Donner made the
