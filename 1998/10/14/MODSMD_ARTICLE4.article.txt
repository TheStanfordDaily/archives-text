## 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
At yesterday's meeting, the first this aca
demic year, Stanford's Board of Trustees
approved an increase in the how much it will
:ost a donor to endow a professorship from
S2 million to $3 million, according to chair
Robert Bass.
'it's been at $2 million since September
1993," Bass said. "Right now it doesn't ade
quately cover expenses. The other major
universities with which we are competitive
are all at $3 million."
The increase, effective September 1999.

will enable Stanford to pay out better
salaries and benefits to endowed professors.
This, Bass said, will likely serve as an entice
ment to applicants, in the short run. Bass
added, however, that in the long run, he
thinks it will level out and the decision is well
justified.
In addition, the Board discussed the high
level of financial donations to the I Jniversi
ty.
"We are pleased to report that the Uni
versity raised $319 million last year," Bass
said. "It's the third year we've broken the
$3(X) million mark."
Bass credited generous alumni and a

healthy economy for the increase in dona
tions.
The Board also talked about the Univer
sity's merger with the Alumni Association.
"In the past the Alumni Association had
been reluctant for the University to do
things that might reach out and tread on its
ground," Bass said. "The merger should rec
tify that situation."
Under the old system, because gilts to
the Alumni Association were not technical
ly considered gifts to the University. Stan
ford was handicapped when reporting its
annual donations total.
Addressing the graduate student
housing crunch, Bass said, "We are
obviously concerned with housing
for graduate students and post-docs.
We are adding S(H) units over time to
help alleviate that problem. We
want to make sure that we continue
getting the same quality of graduate
students and post-docs that we have
had in the past."
Finally, the Board approved the
leasing of part of the Buck Estate to
the Hewlett Foundation. The estate
is a piece of property near the inter
section of Junipero Serra Boulevard
and Sand Hill Road that was donat
ed to the University in 1970. The
University plans to invest the rev
enue generated in redeveloping the
estate's house and gardens for use as
a conference center, primarily for
Medical School functions.
