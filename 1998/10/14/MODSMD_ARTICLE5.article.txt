Rather than watching the days go by at a
boring summer job, senior Jody Madden
spent almost three weeks exploring Israel

to gather information for her honors thesis.
While there. Madden, a Communication
and English major, attended an uerna
tional communications co â€¢ .iv i
Jerusalem. The highlight ol Ik i.|
interview with former Israeli I'- im ms
ter Shimon Peres, keynote speakei the
conference.
Sound too good to be true? It gets bet
ter. Madden was able to fund her entire trip
with a grant from Stanford's Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities program. She
was also compensated for lost summer
wages with URO funds.
I ndci graduate Reseat ui Opportuni
ties is a program which provides grants for
undergraduate research in various fields,
for students in all four undergraduate
years.
Approximately NO percent of students
who apply for URO grants receive them.
But Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities does more than just provide money.
"We want to help students develop a
passion about their courscwork to make it
more meaningful." said Director of Under
graduate Research Opportunities Laura
Sel/nick. "Students are urged to pursue

their interests and view research as discov
ery in the academic context."
"We encourage students to become cre
ators of knowledge," Sel/nick said.
Maddens experience is not an isolated
one. Last year, the URO program funded
about 450 grants totaling more than
$650,000 with money from various donors.
"The number of students that URO
funds to do research is incredible," Madden
said.
"I JRO contributes to the high quality of
education at Stanford," said Laura Leets,
associate professor of communication. "It
demonstrates the University's commit
ment to and recognition of research as well
as undergraduate education."
"It tells students, 'We think you're im
portant: we think your ideas are important,'
and backs it up financially," said Leets.
Modeled alter a similar program at
M IT, Stanford's URO program was started
in 1974 to give students the opportunity to
conduct research with faculty. At that time,
students could receive academic credit for
their work, but no limdinu was available.
