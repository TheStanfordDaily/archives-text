# URO grants fund students' explorations

Rather than watching the days go by at a
boring summer job, senior Jody Madden
spent almost three weeks exploring Israel

to gather information for her honors thesis.
While there. Madden, a Communication
and English major, attended an uerna
tional communications co • .iv i
Jerusalem. The highlight ol Ik i.|
interview with former Israeli I'- im ms
ter Shimon Peres, keynote speakei the
conference.
Sound too good to be true? It gets bet
ter. Madden was able to fund her entire trip
with a grant from Stanford's Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities program. She
was also compensated for lost summer
wages with URO funds.
I ndci graduate Reseat ui Opportuni
ties is a program which provides grants for
undergraduate research in various fields,
for students in all four undergraduate
years.
Approximately NO percent of students
who apply for URO grants receive them.
But Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities does more than just provide money.
"We want to help students develop a
passion about their courscwork to make it
more meaningful." said Director of Under
graduate Research Opportunities Laura
Sel/nick. "Students are urged to pursue

their interests and view research as discov
ery in the academic context."
"We encourage students to become cre
ators of knowledge," Sel/nick said.
Maddens experience is not an isolated
one. Last year, the URO program funded
about 450 grants totaling more than
$650,000 with money from various donors.
"The number of students that URO
funds to do research is incredible," Madden
said.
"I JRO contributes to the high quality of
education at Stanford," said Laura Leets,
associate professor of communication. "It
demonstrates the University's commit
ment to and recognition of research as well
as undergraduate education."
"It tells students, 'We think you're im
portant: we think your ideas are important,'
and backs it up financially," said Leets.
Modeled alter a similar program at
M IT, Stanford's URO program was started
in 1974 to give students the opportunity to
conduct research with faculty. At that time,
students could receive academic credit for
their work, but no limdinu was available.

A turning point for the program
came in 1985, when it received sever
al large grants from outside donors.
A full-time director was hired, re
search opportunities were put on
line, and the URO program gained
physical visibility by moving into the
newly built Sweet Hall. That year.
URO awarded 54 grants totaling
$54,(HX). The program has continued
to grow.
"It's a great experience to get a
taste of actual research," said
Cammy Richmond, a senior major
ing in art history.
Richmond is writing her honors
thesis on Winslow Homer, a turn-of
the-century American artist. This
summer, she used URO funds to see
original Homer paintings in Boston.
"URO allowed me to do some se
rious research that I wouldn't have
been able to do otherwise," Rich
mond said.
The program offers "major" and
"minor" grants as well as Chappell-
Lougee Scholarships, Stanford Fund
Assistantships and Research
Awards, Mellon Minority Under
graduate Fellowships and Future
Faculty Incentives. Major grants may
be as large as $2,500 for research last
ing three academic quarters. Minor
grants can amount to $S(M). Students
may use grant funds to cover a vari
ety of approved expenses including
travel, books, phone calls and faxes.
Through URO, undergraduates
are able to design original research or
work on existing research with facul
ty-
"The opportunity to do this type
of research is one of the best experi
ences students can have," said Psv

chology Prof. Russell Fernald. who is
also head of the Human Biology pro
gram. "Stanford is a research univer
sity and by being involved with re
search, students get the opportunity
to see how knowledge is generated."
"As citizens of the world, this ex
perience helps make students be
come better consumers of the knowl
edge they take in." said Fernald. who
has worked with students on about
30 LJRO projects since 1990.
Before applying for a URO grant,
undergraduates work directly with
Selznick and her assistant. Dean
Eyre, who help students refine their
research interests.
"One of my favorite things is
working with students who come in
with what they think is a flicker of an
idea, and watching their ideas grow,"
said Selznick.
She and Eyre also help students
develop the comfort level necessary
to approach and work with faculty.
To apply for a grant, students
must submit a research proposal and
budget, work with a faculty sponsor,
and be in good academic standing.
"One of the most valuable things
about URO is the application
process — students have to create a
thoughtful, detailed proposal which
can convince faculty members that
their research will be useful and that
they'll be able to understand their
findings. It's an extremely essential
process because it's like the real
world experience of competing for
funding," Fernald said.
"The program is amazing — it of
fers people opportunities that other
universities can't offer." said Anna
Yusim, a senior biology major.
Yusim. who ultimately wants to
become a doctor, is currently work
ing on her honors thesis research to
determine how stress affects learning

and memory. This summer. Yusim
used URO funds to pay for summer
living expenses while working on a
second thesis in philosophy.
"You have the opportunity to do
anything you possibly want to do,"
Yusim said.
Much of the URO program's suc
cess is credited to Selznick.
"Laura Selznick is one of the main
reasons this program is so success
ful," said Fernald.
"She has an amazing amount of
energy and enthusiasm and is com
pletely generous with her time."
"Laura is incredible," added Leets.
"She knows all the students as well as
their research and the faculty they're
working with."
Selznick came to Stanford as a
master's student in Slavic Languages
and Literature in 1%8. after graduat
ing from Smith College. She came on
staff three years later, and has been
working with the URO program
since it began in 1974.
"I love working with students and
also really enjoy working to get new
programs launched." Selznick said.
Yusim said, " There are so many
amazing opportunities at Stanford
that students don't know about.
Laura Selznick is the liaison between
students and those opportunities."
Selznick worked with James
Gibbs. Jr.. the first dean of under
graduate education in Stanford histo
ry. and with each of his successors.
She currently works closely with Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldivar.
"All the former deans are still
contributing to undergraduate edu
cation. which shows their commit
ment to students." said Selznick.
"We pride ourselves in being accessi
ble to students."
