Dear Restaurant Owner,
One of the most popular features in Bon AppEtit magazine is R.S.V.P. In
"il we publish recipes by our readers, who dine out frequently and travel widely.
In answer to a recent request, we would be most grateful if you would
send us your recipe for Susan's Downfall Cheese Raviolis.

Dear Sir,
I was a guest at your restaurant and I chose to eat two of your specials
and they were excellent. One was the corn soup with cumin. Would you be
willing to send me the recipe?
I liked it so much that 1 would enjoy preparing it for my husband. (I'm
not a good enough cook to prepare the main course, the gillled dorado, but I
compliment you on that as well.)
I look forward to my next meal at Pro Bono. I shall recommend your
restaurant to my friends in the San Francisco area.
Sincerely,
Susan Sheehan, The New Yorker Magazine
