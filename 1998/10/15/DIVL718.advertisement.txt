Give the Precious Gift of Life
Our Medical Family specializes in the
treatment of infertility. We help many
childless couples with our Egg Donation
Program.
Becoming a donor takes a rare kind of
individual. If you are between the ages of
21 and 32 and in good health, you can
experience the reward and satisfaction of
helping another woman to conceive. It
is the kindest, most heartfelt gift you
can give.
