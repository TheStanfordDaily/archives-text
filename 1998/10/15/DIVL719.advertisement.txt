iiouienal, wa\ iiiihio'i than me and Monjes
H|. Inn that's how everybody stalls.
When wo wore on lour wilh Queen
I atil.ih, one o! her roadies was lreacli"and
ours was 2l'ac, and that s how ihey was run
nuii" il. I vervone getting tighter than their
peer group. I his was wa\ hack in the dav.
When we first came out, we were both
lonuny boy artists, and on the stage logetli
er. At the time, Pac was at that rank with us,
and I reach and Apache and them were at
that rank with l.atilah. That's why later on.
as you see, they Were really tight, because
I reach went on to make things.
Q: Do you feel tliut your previous suc
cess determines how people see you, like
"Huniply Dunce" being u huge hit?
Shock: I m older than .Ml in this, hut I'm
still dirty in this. I keep missing, hut I'm still
kissing 'em back. The same mission. L'p
until about three or lour /ears ago, if I was
walking down the street, and 1 was like
incognito, people go up to me and say, "Are
you that one?" Or il I was not incognito, or
1 was dressed as you know-wlio, they'd be
like,"Oh sliit!"
but now,-brothers and kills are like, "Ain't
you the one who hangs around with 2Pac?
Aren't you going around with the roadies?"
So some ot the artists we worked with
return the favor, and have helped me gel
recognition as a musician, as one of the
people behind the tracks. And I still got
Ilunipty out there if I feel like getting my
clown on.
Q: How did you come up with Humpty?
Shock: Accident. Shopping for props lor
the video, and. I was in the store and they
had all these pig noses, dog noses, shark
noses, brown (iroucho noses. And when I
looked in the mirror wilh that brown
(iroucho nose on, I stood there and laughed
lor about live minutes. I had to sneak up oh
the mirror! Il was so tunny;- I was like,
"Okay, I see the potential here: the original
big-nosed rapper."
Q: How hns the audience been respond
ing to the tour? Hove you been getting good
responses?
Money: Definitely. And the thing about
it is, when we started the tour, we didn't
really rehearse it, but we know each other,
we know what makes each other work, li s
pretty much one big party anyway. We iusi
get on with the partv, kicking it. That's all
we're doing. We feed ol the eniovment ,«»l
the crowd. And so far every show has been
cooler than the last.
