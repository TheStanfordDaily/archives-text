# Opening session
## New honors office on slate for Faculty Senate meeting 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
The Committee 011 Under
graduate Education is recom
mending the formation of a cen
tral office to coordinate the hon
ors programs across depart
ments.
In its annual report to be pre
sented at today's Faculty Senate
meeting, the committee, while
pleased with many aspects of
the current honors programs,
found "troublesome develop
ments and room for improve
ment."
Included in the committee's

concerns are the large differ
ence across departments in the
percentage of students who pur
sue honors and the fact that
many current students don't
fully consider pursuing honors.
According to Senate Chair
Brad Efron, professor of statis
tics, the item should be subject
to vigorous debate in the senate.
"Some, people think there
should be a central office, others
think that we already have too
many central offices," he said.
The proposals, while up for
discussion in today's senate, are
not subject to a vote. Further ac
tion will depend on the reaction

of the senate to the proposal.
Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education Ramon Saldi
var, under whose auspices the
new Senior Honors Studies of
fice would exist, is in favor of the
formation of the new office. He
also favors including indepen
dent study programs in the of
fice.
Saldi'var is in the process of
implementing two new pro
grams having to do with honors,
which he could envision joining
Honors College and the Under
graduate Research Opportuni
ties office under a new honors
office.

"We're piloting something
called Incentives for Indepen
dent Studies, which provides re
sources for faculty to develop
programs for their majors to do
independent studies," he said.
"Another pet project of mine
is an extension of the Honors
College into the [year-round]
residences."
One discovery by the com
mittee was that the students
who graduate with honors are
clustered in certain depart
ments. For example, while only
15 percent of English majors
pursue honors, 51 percent of history
majors do.
"Different majors have ap
proached [honors] in different
ways," said Saldi'var. "English, for
example, tried to establish a broad
discipline that covers all of British
and American literature. It may now
be time to ask whether our majors
can do that and still focus on one area
for honors."
Committee Chair John Taylor,
professor of economics, feels that
the creation of a separate office for
honors will both monitor the various
programs and encourage depart
ments to focus more strongly on
honors. He compared the proposed
office to the Office of Introductory
Studies that encourages depart
ments to give more freshman semi
nars.
Taylor noted that each depart

ment would retain the diversity and
uniqueness of its honors program.
In addition, the senate will discuss
the Overseas Studies Program and
the graduate program in Latin
American Studies in today's meet
ing.
" The Latin American Studies
program is an old, well endowed
program and has not been without
controversy," said Efron. "It's had
criticism at the dean's level and the
committee's proposal says that it
needs to get more faculty in
volved."
The committee recommended
that the Latin American Studies
masters program add two courses to
its core on political economy and cul
ture and identity.
It also recommended the creation
of a committee to report to the direc
tor of the program annually on the
progress of the program's changes.
"They recommended a yearly
oversight, which I've never seen hap
pen before," said Efron.
