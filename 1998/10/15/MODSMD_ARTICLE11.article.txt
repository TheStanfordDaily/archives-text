### 
LAS VECiAS (AP) — A former honor student who
murdered a little girl in a Nevada casino was sentenced
to life in prison Wednesday after appealing to her fam
ily for forgiveness and lashing out at a friend who failed
to stop the crime.
Jeremy Strohmeyer, 20. received multiple life terms
without parole for sexually assaulting and killing Sher
rice Iverson. 7. in a women's restroom at the Primm
Valley hotel-casino on May 25, 1997.
Strohmeyer read a 22-page typed statement that
expressed remorse, told of efforts to commit suicide in
the days after the killing, and blamed drugs, alcohol and
society for his problems.
"I am sorry." he said. "I do not know if any apology
from me will ever have any worth for Sherrice's family,
but whether they will be able to accept it or not. I must
apologize. 1 am truly sorrv."
Strohmeyer spoke of meeting the girl in a video
arcade and chasing her into the restroom. He said he
was in a drunken stupor and could recall only two of the
22 minutes he was in the restroom with the girl.
"Can you imagine what it would be like to open your
eyes, not knowing where you were or how you got
there?" Strohmeyer said. "To find yourself looking
down on a half-naked, dying little girl?
"I wanted to get out of there as soon as 1 could, but
in my drunken and drugged-out panic, 1 crazily felt that
1 couldn't leave the child in her suffering state. In this

panic. I tried to stop her pain."
Strohmeyer told police he snapped the girl's neck.
Strohmeyer lashed out at his friend. David Cash Jr..
19. who was with him that night.
Cash has said he entered the restroom, saw the
assault in progress, tapped Strohmeyer on the head,
then left when the assault continued.
"He may be proud of what he did that morning but
he makes me sick," Strohmeyer said. "Even that day 1
knew full well the evil of what I had done, yet there
Dave was offering me praise for the part I had in what
had happened."
The younger Cash has drawn the wrath of the vic
tim's family and friends for not acting to save the girl.
He is now a student at the University of California-
Berkeley, where he has been the subject of a protest
and one attack by a man who spit in his face.
The student government has twice voted to recom
mend Cash's ouster, but school officials say he has a
right to study there. Plainclothes officers provide him
protection.
Strohmeyer blamed his problems on a number of
factors: Los Angeles County officials for not telling his
adoptive parents about his birth mother's schizophre
nia and substance abuse; a former girlfriend for driving
him to use methamphetamines; Nevada casinos for
allowing children to play at arcades; and a therapist for
failing to recognize and treat his emotional problems.
