WASHINGTON (AP) —Fed-
eral officials pleaded for the public's
help to find Eric Robert Rudolph as
they added major charges — the
1996 bombing at the Olympics and
two other Atlanta attacks — against
the man who has eluded a massive
search for nine months.
Attorney General Janet Reno
told a Wednesday news conference
the complaint charging Rudolph
with the Olympic blast and the 1997
bombings of a gay bar and an abor
tion clinic was filed with a federal
court. New evidence against him
was kept sealed to protect "the safe
ty of witnesses who have come for
ward," she said.
Two people died and scores were
injured by the six bombs Rudolph is
charged with planting.
"Eric Rudolph is on the run"
from earlier charges that he bombed
a Birmingham. Ala., abortion clinic
Jan. 29, Reno said. "We are not
going to rest until we bring him to
justice."
She re-emphasized the $1 million
reward posted when Rudolph was
put on the FBl's 10 most wanted list
last May.
Accompanying Reno, FBI
Director Louis Freeh said the new
charges were filed because agents
have assembled "a very strong and
substantial case . . . against Mr.
Rudolph with respect to the
Olympic bombing" and the other
Atlanta attacks.
But Freeh conceded another
motive: "We want to emphasize the
indiscriminate nature of these
attacks, as well as the gravity of
them, and hope that that will
encourage anybody who has infor
mation to come forward."
Reno and Freeh released a pho
tograph showing Rudolph in khaki

shorts and a green T-shirt that inves
tigators believe Rudolph was wear
ing in Atlanta the day of the
Olympic blast. Freeh conceded nei
ther witnesses nor thousands of
videos and photographs sent in by
private citizens put Rudolph at the
bomb site itself.
"We hope anyone who sees this
man will contact us immediately,"
Reno said, repeating the toll-free
number: 1-888-ATF-BOMB, or 1-
888-283-2662.
For nine months, hundreds of
FBI and state and local agents have
futilely searched rugged, mountain
ous wilderness in western North
Carolina where the 31 -year-old car
penter and experienced woodsman
grew up and is at home. They
believe he remains there.
Federal officials are aware some
residents of the area, where abor
tion is unpopular, have told
reporters they would not turn
Rudolph in if they came across him.
"We would hope that nobody
would look at this defendant... as a
hero," Freeh said.
The bombs killed an off-duty
police officer guarding the Birming
ham clinic and a 40-year-old mother
in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic
Park, nearly killed a nurse in Birm
ingham and injured a total of 120
people.
Freeh also accused Rudolph of
"a planned and deliberate attack
against law enforcement officers,
rescuers, first-aid individuals who
came to the scenes" of the abortion
clinic and gay bar bombings in
Atlanta. At those sites, a secondary
bomb was timed to go off later, and
federal agents were injured in the
second blast at the Atlanta clinic.
Rudolph faces six counts of using
an explosive against a facility in

interstate commerce, one for each
bomb.
Rudolph could get the death
penalty.
Freeh said investigators have "a
very powerful array of circumstan
tial and direct evidence" but offered
few details.
Asked if the evidence produced a
timeline of Rudolph's movements
that put him in Atlanta when the
Olympics were bombed. Freeh
replied: "Yes .... We have a good
timeline both before and after all of
the bombings now."
Forensic evidence also ties
Rudolph to the explosions, Freeh
said. "There is similarity among
some of the devices," he said, and
he also mentioned letters claiming
responsibility and signed "Army of
God" received after the Atlanta
gay bar and the Birmingham bomb
ings.
All the bombs contained nails
designed to maim people over a
wide area. Investigators have
matched the nails in the two abor
tion clinic bombings to nails found
in a storage shed rented by
Rudolph, according to an agent wh >
requested anonymity.
