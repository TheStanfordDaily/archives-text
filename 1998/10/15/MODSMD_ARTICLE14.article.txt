Sharing results of Greek
judicial hearings ensures
credibility and fairness
IF THE RECENT announcement
regarding the Greek judicial system is
an accurate indicator, the Dean of Stu
dents Office may be relinquishing the prin
ciple that what students and faculty don't
know won't hurt them.
Dean of Students Mark Wais will begin
making official statements to the media
regarding circumstances and outcomes of
serious cases reviewed by the (ireek Judi
cial Hoard. Prior to this change, no effort
was made to publicize the board's decisions.
We are encouraged by this latest step, as
we would be by any move toward more
openness and accountability by the Univer
sity administration.
Charged with reviewing allegations of
misconduct by fraternities and sororities,
the board advises Wais on whether Univer
sity policy has been violated; the board also
recommends sanctions if necessary. The
final decision on ramifications for C ireek
organizations rests with Wais.
One motivation behind this policy
change was certainly information control.
Once a fraternity or a sorority is
involved in a major incident, word eventu
ally leaks to campus media. This can indeed
be problematic, since the rumor grapevine
is clearly neither the most efficient nor the
most accurate tool for transmitting infor
mation.
We hope, however, that fear of gossip
was not the only motivation driving Wais'
decision. A persuasive argument can also
be made that Greek governance should be
more open to the campus as a whole.

As University-sponsored organizations
with collective responsibility and as major
drivers of social life, fraternities and sorori
ties are natural candidates for public
accountability.
In addition, more publicity will probably
give the Greek judicial process the credibil
ity it requires.
Confidential hearings only contribute to
a cynic's view of the board as a group dom
inated by Greeks and determined to shield
other Greeks from responsibility.
Being accountable to the campus will
help the board to meet the standards of the
Stanford community and get credit for deci
sions that fit those standards.
At the same time, willingness to open
disciplinary proceedings should increase
awareness of the Greek judicial system by
students and faculty.
Wais, too, will benefit from educating
the campus about the board's decisions. As
affairs stand now, every disciplinary sanc
tion adds to the myth of a University bent
on destroying the Greek system. Once the
facts and the board's recommendations are
publicized, the decisions of administrators
should appear more balanced and reason
able.
Ultimately, we agree with Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe that open
ness in the judicial process is in line with
Stanford's overall educational mission.
Without an opportunity for public discus
sion, a learning opportunity may be missed.
We are glad the administration has taken a
step in this direction by deciding to
announce the board's opinions.
Campus views toward the Greek system
range from respect to suspicion. The best
way to add some reality to the mix is a con
certed effort to make the governance of fra
ternities and sororities more transparent
and public.
