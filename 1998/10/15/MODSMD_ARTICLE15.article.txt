## Stairmastering without sleeves 
### 
IN TERMS OF the
clothes 1 wear, most
people tell me to err on
the side of caution. "John,"
they say, "err on the side of
caution. Exercise some
restraint. Leave a little to
the imagination. Please."
Okay, not in those words

exactly. More often than not I get a blank
stare and a "What the heck are you doing
wearing a tank top?"
To be honest, I only wear a tank top
when jogging or Stairmastering. Yes, "Stair
master" is a verb. "Today I Stairmaster, yes
terday I Stairmastered, many times I have
Stairmastered."
Unfortunately, I happen to perspire —
ever so slightly — while exercising. And
despite the warnings on the gym equipment,
I prefer "loose articles of clothing" to con
stricting T-shirts. Nothing's worse than
walking home in a soggy, sweaty shirt, so I
go sleeveless, baby. Like my deodorant says,
it's cool to be dry.
Before we go any further, let me reassure
you that personal comfort is my sole inten
tion for wearing tank tops. I certainly don't
wear them for aesthetic reasons, (iod knows
there's nothing aesthetic about my upper
body, anyway. 1 don't really have "guns" or
"pipes" (aren't those clever euphemisms for
biceps?), or veins popping out all over the
place. My triceps jiggle a little too much
when I nudge them, and a one-armed
pushup is about as probable as my running a
three-(or four-, or five-, or six-) minute mile.

I'm not particularly proud of the color of
my upper arms, either. As deeply Sicilian as
dad is, his skin tone DNA just couldn't beat
out Mom's Irish pigmentation. You could
call me ivory, pearly or snow-white, but it's
probably closer to pallid. Clorox ain't got
nothing on me, mama.
Despite my clarification of my clothing
motives, however, I still face opposition
from my anti-tank top friends. I haven't real
ly paid much attention to their argument,
but it's something about guys not being
allowed to wear them. I've heard that it's
better for men to wear no shirt at all rather
than a tank top. What? Are you kidding?
Boy, if my arms are bad, then my tummy is
downright evil. I've tried and tried to devel
op a six-pack down there, but the closest I've
gotten is a mini-keg, which is a step in the
slightly wrong direction. But it's just a varia
tion on a theme, right?
I once asked if a totally buff guy could
pull off wearing one. You know, someone
with a dark tan, thick, python-like arms and
the neck to match? Nope. According to my
sources, a male simply doesn't belong in a
sleeveless shirt, regardless of his physique.
"Even David Hasselhoff?" I asked. Yes.
Even David Hasselhoff.
I can compromise with my tank top
adversaries, but only to a certain extent. I
agree they probably don't belong in certain
places — dining halls or weddings or the
House of Representatives, for example —
but they work just fine on the Stairmaster or
around Lake Lagunita. I, too, would rather
not face someone's bare armpit at the salad

bar, but I'm fully prepared for it in the mid
dle of Arrillaga. I mean, how else are we
males supposed to stay cool and dry? How
else can we ensure proper ventilation of our
upper arms?
Tank tops are the answer. There's a rea
son basketball teams (including our own,
top-riyiked, Final Four-caliber, worth-wait
ing-in-line-for-a-week-and-a-half-for->a-
small-chance-at-maybe-getting-tickets Stan
ford Cardinal) go sleeveless. It just makes
sense. And tank tops use less fabric, ,so
they're economical, too.
Speaking of Cardinal basketball, if our
Sixth Man Club really wanted to make, its
members part of the action, they'd give out
tank tops instead of those ugly long-sleeved
shirts. Not only would the "Sixth Men"
forge a special sleeveless connection with
the players, but the entire section would
remain comfortable, cool and dry. I bet they
could even squeeze in an extra hundred peo
ple with the increased ventilation.
Despite my attempts, I'm sure even this
practical tank top usage remains unaccept
able to my anti-sleeveless friends. As they
stand by their convictions, and I run out of
writing space, I have but one final thought:
my arms are weak, and I'm no David Has
selhoff, but I'm proud to be the sleeveless
man I am.

John, who thinks his picture up there is pret
ty goofy, prefers the Tresidder gym to Arril
laga. He's the pale guy on the Stairmaster
wearing, well, not as much as you'd like.
