4 Rocky 9 misrepresented
I was thoroughly disappointed by your
article on the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
I know that the performers mentioned
numerous times that they were not the
regular performing cast and that this was
by no means the usual show, but this was
not mentioned once in the article.
I lie author makes it sound as though
five pre-pubescent punks show up every
week and this was a rare, special occur
rence for people who didn't know what
they were doing.
Berkeley, San Mateo and Fremont
have casts that DO perform regular show
ings of the film — Berkeley and Fremont
on Saturday nights and San Mateo on Fri
days. They all do a fantastic job.
I think everyone involved with the
show in Berkeley, performers and audi
ence members alike, would appreciate
some sort of correction of what was print
ed.
I think we were all thoroughly misrep
resented. and I hope we will not lose
potential audience members from Stan
ford because your staff happened to
attend on one of the very few weekends
during the year (about once every six
months) that there is no official show.

Barely Legal was the performing cast,
and I thought they put on one of the most
incredible shows I've ever seen. That
weekend there was a Rocky Horror Con
vention that many of the cast members
attended in Las Vegas. This shows how
committed these people are and that they
are willing to travel for the sake of Rocky
Horror.
I hope that the attendees will return on
another weekend to get the real scoop on
the Berkeley Rocky Horror scene.

Strengthen humanities
through dialogue
Since the beginning of this academic
year, 1 have been delighted to see, both on
the pages of the Stanford Daily and in my
undergraduate seminars, many strong
reactions to the different initiatives of
President Casper to strengthen the
Humanities at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily's editorial of Oct.

13 was just added evidence to the impres
sion that, almost an entire year after these
"Presidential" initiatives were announced,
they are beginning to he taken seriously —
which of course does not mean that they
are generally approved of.
There was one layer of reaction and
argument, however, in the Daily editorial,
which I think is beginning to become
obsolete.
Once again, the question was raised of
whether these initiatives, which include
Stanford Introductory Seminars, new
chairs in the humanities and the Stanford
Presidential Lectures and Symposia in the
Humanities and Arts can be taken seri
ously, or whether, as the editorial insinu
ates, they have to be treated with caution
and as if they were part of a wicked strat
egy of deception.
1 think there is reason to ask what more
a University can possibly do to strengthen
a cluster of disciplines like the humanities
than to create new professorships, to
change its program of courses and to
invite world-leading representatives of
these disciplines for lectures and debates.
If, in a conversation I had with the
Stanford Daily, I emphasized (and this is
quoted in the Daily editorial) that, at this
point, no one has a completely convincing
recipe as to what the future of the human
ities will and should be. this should not be

read either as a symptom of a lack of sin
cerity behind these initiatives nor as an
argument on whose basis students will be
excluded from further discussion.
Quite to the contrary, I have always
thought that admitting to one's difficulties
in resolving a problem, that developing
awareness of the complexity of the task in
question, is the most intellectually respon
sible and, normally, the most practical step
towards a solution.

Geyser's column raised
substantive issues
We are sick and tired of reading letters
complaining about Dan Geyser's humor
ous column last week. If the writers would
take a second to remove their heads from
their collective asses it would be obvious
that one, the column was meant to be
funny and entertaining; and two, it made a
valid point: While certain "managerial"
problems do slow down the post office, the
specific behavior of specific employees

also works to the detriment of postal effi
ciency.
The fact is that people leave the post
office in tears because of rude and obnox
ious, unnecessary and quite inexcusable
behavior. It may be "mean" to point this
out. but having an unpleasant, difficult job
is not a "free pass" to harass and antago
nize everyone that walks through the
door. If they don't like the criticism, they
shouldn't provoke it.
