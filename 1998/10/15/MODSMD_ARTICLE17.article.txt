## Taking out and taking care of the kids

II HAD BEEN a very long day. My
morning began with an alarm that I
didn't hear followed by a rousing from
my roommate. Andy â€” a stunning guy, but
not at his most soothing at 5 a.m.
Alter the shaking, growling and the tug
of war over my blankets, 1 gave in, hit verti
cal and made a beeline to the bathroom.
Grab toothbrush. Add paste. Scrub.
1 grabbed my almost-dry bathing suit and
pulled it back on for the millionth time in as
many days. Flying through the kitchen. 1
grabbed a frozen Eggo and a banana and
jumped into the car. Andy and 1 rode in
silence. No radio. No talking. Just groggy
quiet and me crunching on a frozen Eggo.
Like clockwork. The life of a swimming
instructor. The life of summer. Every morn
ing, cursing yourself for staying out late that
one last time. Wondering how your body can
function on only eight hours of sleep. A
week. And somehow it becomes a routine.
And so, the day wound on like any other.
I taught the frog-kick, gave out 17 Band
aids and rescued one stow-away six-year
old who had set sail for the middle of the
pond on an inflatable alligator. By the time

1 got back behind the wheel to leave. 1 had
seen 2(K) children and taught almost 80.
And it was in this state that 1 started the
engine. I should have waited for Andy. I
should have walked home. Or napped in the
car. Anything but turned the key.
But 1 didn't. I started up my 1986 Jeep
Cherokee and listened to the engine rattle
to life. After I backed out, a guy in a Cadil
lac with Jersey plates cut out in front of me
and began to back up into me.
Seeing the six year-old Fergeson twins in
my rear-view mirror. I quickly checked to
make sure the little Dennis-the-Menace
look-alikes saw me before taking my foot
off the brake. I let my car roll back. Sud
denly I heard a huge CRACK as I felt my
bumper hit something. My heart stopped.
I slammed the car in park and jumped
out. No, no, no.
1 dashed behind my car and saw little
Spencer Fergeson on the ground, his twin
staring at me with his mouth open. His
mother came running as 1 prayed I hadn't
killed him.
But, Spencer sat up, a red bump already
forming on his forehead. When he saw that

the scrape on his arm was dribbling a bit of
blood he started to cry. Immediately I
grabbed my first aid kit from my car and did
a primary check, mumbling "I'm sorry. I am
so, so sorry," the whole time.
Nothing was broken, and after taking
care of his elbow and putting an ice pack on
his head. Spencer stopped crying and we
found out what had happened. Apparently
in a rush to go play at his friend's house, he
thought I was parked and ran behind my car
just as 1 started backing up. And the
bumper on my massive beast of a Jeep
made contact with his head.
As I watched Spencer leave, my head
started spinning and I slumped to the
ground. That poor kid!
I almost killed, or seriously maimed
someone. A six-year old. nonetheless. In a
second, some bad timing almost left me
guilty of manslaughter.
There I was, the person responsible for
teaching kids, and I was ramming into them
with my car. I started shivering uncontrol
lably in the hot summer heat. How could I
face this kid. any kid, after this?
A sickness overwhelmed my stomach.

What it I had kept going and run him over?
What it I caused brain damage? What if his
brain hemorrhaged? What if he got amne
sia? My overactive imagination was running
madly away. And my schizophrenia was
compounded by my father, who said. "Gee,
I hope they don't sue."
With that my mind charged on. A mil
lion-dollar lawsuit. Jail time. How would I
survive in a correctional institution? How
would I finish both majors behind bars? My
mother would be so embarrassed!
1 would never get a job after doing time,
even with a Stanford degree. It was all
becoming clear as day. 1 really was going to
have to work at McDonald's. I could never
go to a class reunion.
And to top it off, how was 1 going to
explain it to Red Cross? They would read
down my class roster for beginning swim
ming: Pass, Pass, Pass. Fail. Pass, Murdered.
It really wasn't going to look good.
And then I remembered that I had to go
back and teach the next morning. Would
the kids run in fear when they saw me com
ing? Would parents even bring their kids?
How could a woman who runs over her stu

dents on land be trusted with them in
water?
When Speneer's mother ealled me that
evening, my heart was sitting in my feet. I
waited for her to mention a subpoena.
Instead she said that Spencer was fine. They
took him to a doctor, and he didn't have a
concussion. Not even a bruise. Apparently
six-year-old heads are fairly malleable and
he wasn't even swelling.
1 hung up with a huge sense of relief. But
that kid reminded me, in a matter of sec
onds, that life is fragile. And shit happens,
even when you look twice. With a shift of
my right foot I almost went from care-free
kid to convicted killer.
And the next day, as I once again swung
my feet down to the cold wood floors to
rush through my routine yet another time. 1
made some resolutions: to check my mir
rors. not my radio; to love my students, not
maim them: and whenever possible, to just
let Andy drive.

Vanessa Bartsch is a senior majoring in
music. If you think her driving is atrocious,
you ought to see her hike.
