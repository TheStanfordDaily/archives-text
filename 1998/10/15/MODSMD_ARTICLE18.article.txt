## Fourth and inches Don't stop the Chaos 
### 
Gil Lopez

Stanford fans have finally done it.
They've been so good, they had to he
stopped. The Sixth Man Club is now
a burden. I love it.
The fact that "Cardinal Chaos"
broke out about two weeks early out
side of Maples Pavilion led to more
revisions of the basketball office's
season-ticket policies than 1 care to
think about right now. What are we
at now? I think you have to stand in a
crowd while team marketing director
Jamie Zaninovich chucks bricks at
random. You get nailed, you get tick
ets. Jamie Z relieves some stress,
everyone's happy.

But seriously, the basketball of
fice can't be faulted. They haven't
quite realized that there's no real fair
and easy way to diwy up the ticket al
lotment. It's like trying to partition a
steak between a pack of hungry
wolves; it's better to just drop it and
run.
And that's what happened. In
order to try and please as many peo
ple as possible without getting itself

flooded with complaints, the front of
fice just decided to drop a bunch of
tickets on each group and let some
one else figure out the rest.
Smart move. We're dealing with a
group of people whose past offenses
have included: viciously mocking a
coach for his relationship with his es
tranged son; taunting a player about
his ex-girlfriend; poking fun at anoth
er player's alleged legal / drug trou
bles; and of course, making fun of
anyone with the slightest aesthetic
blemish. (Do the words "big and
ugly" ring a bell?)
Nothing is sacred or taboo as far
as the Sixth Man is concerned. It's ba
sically the monster the Band would
be if it didn't have to worry about
University sanctions.
My personal theory on why the
campout was stopped? The Univer
sity was afraid of the party that would
thrown on the eve of Cardinal Chaos,
It would have made Halloween's
Mausoleum Party look like a SLE
pear-cider kegger.
The Sixth Man is now its own en
tity. Arizona has those annoying
"Lute Lids." we have giant rolled-uj
joints.
Not that this is all good. Flit
whole process has transformed the
club into a big inarticulate bully
"Who's your daddy?" isn't exacth
the most refined rallying cry. I like it

but people like Gerhard Casper and
head coach Mike Montgomery
worry about the school's image.
But that's not they're job. As long
as Monty takes care of the team and
its players, we can handle the rest.
Fans are there to cause a ruckus.
They give their team every advan
tage possible. And if that means
causing a little permanent emotion
al damage to opponents, so be it.
Hopefully next year we can try
this again. Zaninovich needs to do a
little work to keep things more or
derly. Have registration over the
Web. Limit the maximum group
sizes to six or eight people so giant
dormitories don't get advantages
that smaller suites can't possibly
hope to have. It won't be perfect, but
it'll even the playing field a little bit.
