### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
Last night Stanford women's field
hockey was forced to come to the re
alization that it, too, is subject to the
old proverb, "All good things must
come to an end." After a gut-wrench
ing loss to 13th-ranked Northeastern
(7-6), the team fell to 9-3 on the year.

Parsons Field, which had seemed
an inviting atmosphere during Tues
day's 5-0 victory over Vermont, sud
denly turned on the Cardinal as the
skies over Boston were blanketed
with clouds and tilled with drizzle. It
wasn't long before they began to rain
on Stanford's parade.
During the first half both teams
were locked in a defensive grudge
match. Stanford was able to muscle
just two shots-on-goal, one by senior
midfielder Jordyn Kramer and the
other by sophomore forward
Michelle Scott, who had a 40 percent
scoring percentage before the road
trip began.
Stanford's defense matched
Northeastern's efforts, holding the
Huskies to just two shots as well.

Hilary McHugh.
For the fust 10 minutes of the see
ond half, it appeared the scorciess lie
would not be broken. Then, with z4
minutes, 7 seconds remaining,
McHugh made Stanford pay for the
opportunities it was affording ner.
Scoring her ninth goal of the season,
McHugh sailed a shot from tne
penalty comer by the Cardinal de
fense and into the net to give North
eastern a 1-0 lead.
Stanford got just one shot in the
second halt, fai short of the Huskies'
five sccond-half shots on goal.
When the final whistle blew, the
Cardinal found itself with its third
loss overall and first in over a month.

eastern knew that in order to be vic
torious it would have to shutdown
the Cardinal offense, which had used
explosive attacks to place games out
of reach before Stanford's oppo
nents could produce a shot. Execut
ing perfectly. Northeastern held the
Cardinal to just five shots, 24 fewer
than it took just one day earlier. For
a team that had out-shot its oppo
nents 195 to 48, this w as anything but
normal.

While the loss ended a number of
Stanford's streaks, including the six
game win streak and a four-game
streak of scoring at least four goals,
one streak was preserved. Each of
Stanford's losses this season have
come on shutouts, and the Huskies
followed this recipe for victory per
