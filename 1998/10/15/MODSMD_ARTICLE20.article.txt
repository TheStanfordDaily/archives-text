FOOTBALL

per carry for your two best backs
just isn't going to cut it, not even in
the pass-happy Pacific 10 Confer
ence. It seems as if the Cardinal has
never gained more than a yard on
any dive or blast between the
guards. Furthermore, a lot of those
yards came on draws and delays
when the defense had put them in a
situation where the running game
had to be an afterthought. Howev
er. the line did bounce back from a
manhandling in South Bend to
push the Beavers around a little, so
its stock may be slightly on the rise.
Grade: C
Tight Ends: It's hard to say why the
tight ends seem nonexistent this
year. Russell Stewart may not have

helped inspire confidence in their
pass-catching ability with his two
drops against OSU (one in the end
zone) but that was unusual in that
someone actually saw a Cardinal
tight end near the ball. So far. ju
niors Stewart and Steve Coughlin
have combined for seven catches
for 71 yards — nowhere near the
production of last year.
"There's some youth and inex
perience here, but we're going to
need them to learn and grow up
and play big-time football at tight
end very soon," head coach Tyrone
Willingham said before the season.
They've shown some progress,
but they're not there yet. Stanford
has had some success running Coy
Wire off tackle, so that keeps them
in the passing range. Grade: C-
Runniiig Backs: Sometimes. Coy
Wire looks like the real deal. He'll
slide off tackle and get stood up.
but he'll spin away from a tackier,
bounce outside and pick up 17.
Other times, he looks like he's run
ning into a dark room that he's
never been in before, overly care
ful not to bump into the sofa or cof
fee table.

A Division I back needs an ab
solutely explosive move to the out
side and a willingness to smash
through for the tough yards. Wire
has shown both, but inconsistently
and never at the same time. The
good news is that he's only a red
shirt freshman, so the potential he
showed when he was stacked up at
the line against OSU and still man
aged to bounce off a tackier and
hurdle another for first down
yardage could be fulfilled in the
coming years.
Juan-Carlos Lacey has been
used primarily as a changeup back
to spell Wire, and hasn't gotten
enough carries to show what he can
do. At fullback. Maxwell Steven
son has picked up three goal-line
touchdowns for the Cardinal, and
has performed marginally well at
the little run-blocking he's had to
perform. Grade: C
Wide Receivers: When Trov Wal
ters left the Arizona game with an
injured ankle, the question re
mained whether the receiving
corps of Dave Davis and Deßon

posing quarterbacks this season.
nie Pitts could step up in his ab
sence. They have done so in
spades, and received help from the
unlikely source of fifth-year senior
Jeff Allen. In his three previous
years in a Cardinal uniform, "Allen
had caught just two passes for 37
yards, but he came up huge against
North Carolina with five catches
for 111 yards and his first touch
down. Walters resumed against
OSU where he left off against Ari
zona, finishing with six catches for
159 yards. Pitts and Davis are both
close to averaging 100 yards receiv
ing per game, and have combined
for nine touchdowns. Sophomore
Tafiti Uso has demonstrated some
potential in goal-line situations as
well. Grade: A-
Quarterback: Husak has been one
of the few bright spots for the 1-5
Stanford squad. The junior is on
pace to break 3,000 yards passing
for the season, and would become
just the third Cardinal quarterback
ever to achieve the feat, the other
two being John Elway and Steve
Stenstrom. When Walters missed
three games with a sprained ankle,
Husak was still able to find re
ceivers open downfield and con
nect with them.
Husak had no problem spread
ing the ball around even when
Walters returned as Walters, Pitts,
and Davis all enjoyed 100-plus
yard games. Against Oregon State,
Husak even managed to break
Stanford's single game passing
record, eclipsing Steve Dils's 1978
mark of 430 yards by 20. In the
same game, he broke the NCAA
record for consecutive pass at
tempts without an interception,
only to see his streak snapped by
costly picks in the second half. One
of those came on Stanford's final
drive, which is the only thing that
prevents Husak from a straight A.
Grade: A-
Defensive Line: The only starter

returning from last year is end
Willie Howard, who came back
from a first-quarter injury against
OSU to record a key sack and
block a Beaver field goal. That in
experience has shown, as the Car
dinal is last in the Pac-10 in rushing
defense, passing defense and over
all defense. When you give up 217
yards on the ground each game, it's
tough to keep opponent's offense
off the field, or, for that matter, out
of the end zone.
Junior Riall Johnson has played
well at end, but was taken out of
the game by a constant stream of
double-teams at Oregon. The
line's worst moments came in
South Bend, as a bigger, stronger
and faster Irish line pushed them
around to the tune of 309 yards
rushing. Until getting some things
going against the Beavers, the pass
rush was nonexistent. Grade: C-
Defensive Secondary: This is
where it gets really ugly. Stanford
is 107 th in the nation in pass de
fense. Sophomore Reuben Carter
was pulled during the second half
of the North Carolina game in
favor of Brian Taylor, who the next
week became the first true fresh
man ever to start during Willing
ham's tenure at Stanford. Carter
and Taylor platooned for the last
three quarters of the OSU game,
after the Beavers went after Taylor
for five catches on seven attempts
for 71 yards.
"We're still looking for some
one who can give us solid produc
tion at that position." Willingham
said.
It gets worse. Though safeties
Tim Smith and Aaron Focht have
delivered some teeth-rattling hits
on opposing wide receivers, the
deep help has been absent all too
often. The nadir of Stanford pass
coverage history surely came at
Autzen stadium against Oregon, as
the Duck wideouts looked like
wolves in the hen house of the Car
dinal secondary, gnashing and
tearing off long chunks of yardage
until they had sated themselves at
Stanford's expense.

There's more — the tackling
has been suspect, and Stanford's
been trapped in too many man-to
man schemes. Grade: D-
Linebackers: Trouble ahead, trou
ble behind. With weaknesses up
front and in the backfield, the line
backers have actually played rela
tively well. As run-stoppers, out
side backer Donnie Spragan and
inside backers Sharcus Steen and
Marc Stockbauer have done an ad
equate job, but have shown them
selves to be vulnerable to the play
action. Occasionally poor tackling
detracts from a job otherwise well
done. Grade: B-
Special teams: This could have
been a B. Maybe a B+ it the game
against the Beavers had produced
a runback for a touchdown or a
blocked punt. Instead, the special
teams disasters last weekend cost
the Cardinal a much-needed win,
and the grades plummet accord
ingly. The final line for Stanford's
special teams reads like A 1
Capone's rap sheet: a blocked field
goal, a blocked extra point, a par
tially blocked punt, and two cata
strophic fumbles on an OSU punt
and a kickoff. The fumbles by Wire
and Walters led directly to two
Oregon State touchdowns, erasing
a rare Stanford lead. Assume the
25-yard field goal and extra point
would have been good, and special
teams cost the Cardinal 18 points.
There aren't many 1-5 teams that
can afford that kind of swing, and
Stanford isn't one of them. The
starting field position on kickoffs
has been horrendous as of late, and
kicker / punter Kevin Miller didn't
help the field position struggle with
a 10-yard punt against the Beavers.
On the bright side, Miller has
generally been superb on field
goals, and trails only Husak in
scoring with 32 points on the sea
son. Frank Primus has also made a
habit of making acrobatic plays to
down punts on the goal line, and it
is only his and Miller's play that
keeps special teams out of the D
range. Grade: C-


Kevin Scheirer — Daily file
Junior quarterback Todd Husak has been one of the few consistent bright spots for the Cardinal foot
ball team this year. He has combined with a talented group of wideouts to give the Cardinal a strong of
fensive punch.
