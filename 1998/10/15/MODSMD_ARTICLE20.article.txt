FOOTBALL

per carry for your two best backs
just isn't going to cut it, not even in
the pass-happy Pacific 10 Confer
ence. It seems as if the Cardinal has
never gained more than a yard on
any dive or blast between the
guards. Furthermore, a lot of those
yards came on draws and delays
when the defense had put them in a
situation where the running game
had to be an afterthought. Howev
er. the line did bounce back from a
manhandling in South Bend to
push the Beavers around a little, so
its stock may be slightly on the rise.
Grade: C
Tight Ends: It's hard to say why the
tight ends seem nonexistent this
year. Russell Stewart may not have

helped inspire confidence in their
pass-catching ability with his two
drops against OSU (one in the end
zone) but that was unusual in that
someone actually saw a Cardinal
tight end near the ball. So far. ju
niors Stewart and Steve Coughlin
have combined for seven catches
for 71 yards — nowhere near the
production of last year.
"There's some youth and inex
perience here, but we're going to
need them to learn and grow up
and play big-time football at tight
end very soon," head coach Tyrone
Willingham said before the season.
They've shown some progress,
but they're not there yet. Stanford
has had some success running Coy
Wire off tackle, so that keeps them
in the passing range. Grade: C-
Runniiig Backs: Sometimes. Coy
Wire looks like the real deal. He'll
slide off tackle and get stood up.
but he'll spin away from a tackier,
bounce outside and pick up 17.
Other times, he looks like he's run
ning into a dark room that he's
never been in before, overly care
ful not to bump into the sofa or cof
fee table.

A Division I back needs an ab
solutely explosive move to the out
side and a willingness to smash
through for the tough yards. Wire
has shown both, but inconsistently
and never at the same time. The
good news is that he's only a red
shirt freshman, so the potential he
showed when he was stacked up at
the line against OSU and still man
aged to bounce off a tackier and
hurdle another for first down
yardage could be fulfilled in the
coming years.
Juan-Carlos Lacey has been
used primarily as a changeup back
to spell Wire, and hasn't gotten
enough carries to show what he can
do. At fullback. Maxwell Steven
son has picked up three goal-line
touchdowns for the Cardinal, and
has performed marginally well at
the little run-blocking he's had to
perform. Grade: C
Wide Receivers: When Trov Wal
ters left the Arizona game with an
injured ankle, the question re
mained whether the receiving
corps of Dave Davis and Deßon

Redshirt freshman Travis Pfeifer tries to make it past the Beaver offensive line in last week's 30-23 loss.
The nose tackle and the rest of the Cardinal defensive linemen have had trouble putting pressure on op
posing quarterbacks this season.
