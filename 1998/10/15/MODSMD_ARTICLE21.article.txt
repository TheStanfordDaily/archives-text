"This weekend is huge. If we can
beat these teams, we are on our way
to a Pac-10 championship," said se
nior midfielder Christy Stoffel.
No. 25 Stanford (7-3-2. 1-1 Pac
-10) kicked off Pac-10 competition
last weekend when the team hosted
the Arizona schools.
The Cardinal bounced back from
last Friday's 2-1 loss to Arizona State
with an 8-1 rout of Arizona on Sun
day. That game helped rebuild the
team's confidence.
"Because we had lost the last two
games, we needed a win in the Ari
zona game." Stoffel said. "A lot of
people scored and it's good to have a
lot of people contributing."
"This game shows that we have a
lot of weapons and momentum mov
ing into the Pac-10 competition, "said
head coach Steve Swanson.
The Cardinal will seek to continue
to build on the momentum of this

commanding win when the team
takes on the Trojans (6-6-1.0-2-0) in
Friday's afternoon game. Stanford is
3-1 all-time against the Trojans.
Southern California began its
Pac-10 season last weekend with two
losses: a 2-0 decision against Wash
ington State and a 3-2 loss against
Washington.
Injuries have plagued the Trojans
season. Highly recruited freshman
defender Kim Abbamonto is out for
the season, as is junior forward
Kaylee Whittel.
