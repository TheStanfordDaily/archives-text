Just over half way through its sea
son. the Stanford mountain hiking
squad has experienced almost every
extreme of racing conditions. The
myriad of adverse situations has not
slowed the Cardinal though, as the
team is currently ranked fourth in
the Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference.
The mountain biking season is
quite compact, consisting of six com
petitions over only seven weeks.
Competitions typically run over two

days on the weekends, with the
downhill and slalom races on Satur
day and the eross-country races con
ducted on Sundays.
After the first three races of the
season Stanford trails conference
leader Nevada bv only 69 points.
Nevada leads the WCCC with 372
points, followed by Chico State and
C al Foly-San Luis Obispo in second
and third, respectively.
Stanford has not scored well in
the downhill portions of the week
ends simply due to the lack of riders

entered into these events,
deticit detracts from the strong
cross-country results in the ovcriil
team finish for the competition.
Adding to the list of naturally
hazardous conditions Lhat the
mountain hiking team has endured
was the past weekend's hard and
humpy track at Parkfield. Calif. As a
result of the track conditions Stan
ford had to deal with many flat tires,
broken equipment and the debris
left on the course by other teams as
well.
