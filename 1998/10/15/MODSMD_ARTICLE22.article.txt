# Mountain biking takes 2nd
## 
### Bobby Blunt Staff writer 
Just over half way through its sea
son. the Stanford mountain hiking
squad has experienced almost every
extreme of racing conditions. The
myriad of adverse situations has not
slowed the Cardinal though, as the
team is currently ranked fourth in
the Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference.
The mountain biking season is
quite compact, consisting of six com
petitions over only seven weeks.
Competitions typically run over two

CLUB SPORTS

days on the weekends, with the
downhill and slalom races on Satur
day and the eross-country races con
ducted on Sundays.
After the first three races of the
season Stanford trails conference
leader Nevada bv only 69 points.
Nevada leads the WCCC with 372
points, followed by Chico State and
C al Foly-San Luis Obispo in second
and third, respectively.
Stanford has not scored well in
the downhill portions of the week
ends simply due to the lack of riders

entered into these events,
deticit detracts from the strong
cross-country results in the ovcriil
team finish for the competition.
Adding to the list of naturally
hazardous conditions Lhat the
mountain hiking team has endured
was the past weekend's hard and
humpy track at Parkfield. Calif. As a
result of the track conditions Stan
ford had to deal with many flat tires,
broken equipment and the debris
left on the course by other teams as
well.
"The second part of the course
was literally strewn with riders from
different teams carrying mangled
wheels, or pushing hikes, or fixing
flats by the side of the trail. Such a
rough, humpy and rocky course re
ally tests the mettle of a rider and his
or her equipment," said captain
John Bilderbeck.
Business school student Kasey
Craig started her mountain biking
career off well last weekend with a
second place finish in the women's
B category. She was followed by

Lee, who followed up her first-place
finish in Chico by taking third. Kas
soy finished third in the A category
after having to struggle with a tlat
tire and only loosing the second spot
by seconds as she was passed at the
finish line while carrying her bike
due to a second flat tire.
The mechanical problems did
not only plague the women, but the
men's team as well. Scott Daily
could not even finish his race due to
a sheared wheel. Jaime McJunkin
ended up finishing sixth despite hav
ing to overcome two flat tires and ju
nior Colin Fay rebounded after
loosing his chain to finish well in the
men's C division.

Overall, Stanford finished sec
ond with 120 total team points. The
Cardinal came in behind the host
Broncos, who had 252 points. The
Cardinal gets the chance to advance
in the rankings this weekend as they
host a home meet at Santa Teresa
County Park in San Jose.
"We're on our home turf for this
one, and we expect good results
from our racers. Many of us are fa
miliar with the course we've set out,
so we'll know what to expect," said
Bilderbeck.
After hosting this weekend,
Stanford will take a one-week break
in order to gear up for the WCCC
championships in San Diego.
