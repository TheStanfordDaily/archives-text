# ASSU Nom Com revises process
## 
### Rachel Turow 
Although the process of nominat
ing students for University commit
tees is a perennial target of student
skepticism, this year's nominees and
members of the ASSU Nominations
Commission are defending their
process and pointing toward new ini
tiatives to make it more flexible.
University Committees are made
up of University staff, faculty and
student members who work together
to make decisions that affect stu
dents and administrators on a Uni
versity-wide level. Each member of
the committee has equal weight in
the final decision.
Lisa Liao, a senior and head of the
ASSU Nominations Commission,
which places students on the Univer
sity committees, is aware that the stu
dent body has many negative opin
ions about both the effectiveness of
University committees and the com
mission's process of placing students
on the committees.
The application process for Uni
versity Committees has been
changed this year to a "rolling" for
mat, whereby students who are inter
ested in serving on committees can
submit applications at any time and
will be taken into consideration for
committee positions that open up
during the year. At the moment, the
Coffee House Focus Group and the
Bookstore Advisory Committee are
both in need of student members.
The committee used to only ac
cept applications in the spring for the
following year.
Liao said the commission tries to
place both students who have good
experience and those who have
strong interests in the issues at hand
on the committees. By staggering ex
perience and interest levels we have
"the best way to bring in new ideas
and changes to the committees," said
Liao.

The Nominations Committee
looks for students such as sopho
more Cassandra Sweet. "I became
interested in serving on the Library
Committee because... I work at the
Hoover Institution and I wanted
more exposure to the library sys
tem," she said.
Sweet was happy with the appli
cation process. She also appreciates
her role on the commission. "If any
body needs to know anything about
the libraries, or they have an issue to
discuss, they can come to me."
Liao is also aware of the growing
need to integrate student opinion
into the committee decision-making
process. She is working this year to
organize student committee mem
bers and ASSU senators into a more
cohesive network.
The increased communication
between committee members and
ASSU senators will allow for more of
what Sophomore Class President
Parth Raval termed, "addressing stu
dents' concerns by representing
them with a gcx)d cross-section of the
student body."
Senior Brian Pilko, a member of
the Greek Judicial Board, con
curred. "We work to represent the
entire student body and, because of
this, we are very well received by
both students and administrators.
We take into account the issues
brought to us by students as well as
those of the administration and this
allows us to maintain a good level of
respect on both sides."
The Greek Judicial Board was
subjected to scrutiny last year be
cause its members were picked not
by the Nominations Commission,
but by Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Although some students may feel
their opinions don't count, they real
ly are important, according to Liao.
"We need to disseminate the right
information and dispel these miscon
ceptions," said Liao.
