# A 						more realistic 'Real World' welcomed this year's frosh
## Thinking about sex and life 
### Vlada Teper 
Gasps reverberated through
Memorial Auditorium. Exclama
tions of "how rude" rustled through
the crowd as a hoy in the audience
suddenly started yelling and jumped
onto the stage. Only after 10 minutes
did the whispering cease as it became
apparent that the hoy was an actor in
" The Real World: Stanford."
An annual production for Stan
ford's freshmen since 1990, "The
Real World" attacks problems such
as sexual health, sexual assault and
eating disorders.
But this year's show broke
ground, treating the sensitive subject
matter in a compelling new style, set
ting a precedent for years to come.
"Usually the production was pre
sented in a skit format without conti
nuity," said senior David Lampson,
this year's script writer. "When I saw
'Sex in the '90s' my freshman year it
seemed more like a comedy show;
there wasn't enough realism, which is
necessary to be moved."
As a result, he developed five
main characters with consistent per
sonalities that evolved during the
show.
"It was a coherent plav instead of
a bunch of little skits," said Jenny
Moon, a senior who plqyed the part
of character Alice Ritchie. "With a
different format it was more realistic.
In fact, I still have freshmen asking
me when volleyball practice is, since
my character played volleyball."
"Every year we really struggle
with how to present the health topics
we want to address, most effectively,"
said Carole Pertofsky, director of
health promotion services at Cowell
Student Health Center. "We don't
want the characters to sound stilted.
And we don't want them to start
spouting statistics."
Sexual Assault Prevention Pro
gram Manager Sally Baird agreed.

"We wanted the script upbeat, in
not just black and white, but with gray
areas," she said.
This presented a major challenge
to Lampson, who spent his August
trying to create a production which
was both infomative and not too de
pressing.
"While respecting the material, I
had to present it in an accessible way
yet without lecturing, and make it en
tertaining," said Lampson.
"Lots of safety tips were eliminat
ed this year," said junior Andrew
Leeds, the director. "Things about
bike safety and the importance of
locking doors weren't included."
Instead more health issues, such as
body image made their way into the
spotlight.
"As a result of comment sheets
from the previous year we also dealt
more with depression and absti
nence," said Lampson.
In surreal reality a completely
new, experimental script became a
full-blown production in five days.
"I couldn't believe," said Lamp
son, "the way they put it together.
The actors were excellent and the
Hashing back to different periods in
volved lots of really complicated
things with lighting. It was beautifully
done."
"Without Caroline Chao, the
lighting director, the show would not
have been possible," said director
Andrew Leeds. "The actors were
wonderful, and Carole and Sally
helped us to make sure that the char
acters portrayed were accurate."
In 1990, the year that the first pro
duction dealing with sexual health
was presented, the show was spon
sored solely by the ASSIJ.
"As a result of student activism
and the findings of two studies that
concluded that during the first six
weeks of freshmen year the students
run an increased risk of sexual as
sault. Cowell Health Services began

to contribute funds," said Baird.
In 1993 RAs began to get in
volved, and post-production discus
sions in houses were initiated. By
1998 the goals were filtered further.
"People should be able to argue
afterwards," said Lampson, "and ask
themselves whether, for example,
eating disorders make people more
attractive, or whether that guy is real
ly a rapist."

Everyone seemed to be pleased
with the outcome of this year's pro
duction, including members of the
University administration.
"The audience was able to identi
fy better with the characters,' 4 said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. "I be
lieve some students in the audience
may believe that Nathan Jones is a
chemistry genius from Massachu
setts."
