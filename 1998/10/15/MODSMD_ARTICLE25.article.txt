# Lexis-Nexis goes to Web
## Many students regret loss of access for off-campus users 
### Diana Reddy 
On Sept. 1, Stanford switched
from a Unix-based, Telnet-accessi
ble version of Lexis-Nexis to a Web
based version.
Some members of the Stanford
community have welcomed the
change, while others complain that
the change limits access and search
capabilities.
Academic Universe, the Lexis-
Nexis service used by Stanford, pro
vides access to a huge searchable
database of magazines, newspapers
and journals specifically selected to
meet the needs of the general acade
mic community.
Individual subscriptions to this
service are very expensive, but Stan
ford purchases bulk access, allowing
students, faculty and staff to use the
service for free.
The recent switch to a Web-based

version was not Stanford's choice.
The Unix-based version was discon
tinued by Lexis-Nexis, making the
Web-based version the only feasible
alternative.
Some users prefer the new sys
tem, stating that the Web-based ver
sion is designed to be user-friendly
— making it easier to search, save
and print.
"I used the Telnet version of Aca
demic Universe when 1 came up to
Stanford for Admit Weekend, and I
didn't like it at all." said Maulik Za
veri. a freshman. "The new version is
much easier to use." However, this
new version presents two major
problems to some members of the
Stanford community.
First, it presents a problem for
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents who live off campus. These
users used to be able to log in with a
username and password, but the

Web-based version requires a com
puter with an on-campus identifica
tion code.
"I think it is important that grad
uate students who live off campus
have access to the same resources as
those who live on campus," said
Holly Tabor, a graduate student in
epidemiology.
Second, there is a difference in
the search capacities of this new sys
tem. The Unix-based version ran
full-text searches for all keywords
entered, while the new system will
initially search only titles, lead para
graphs and index terms. Although
full-text searches can be performed
within these results, this new struc
ture still limits search capabilities.
"For a power user, there can be
some loss of functionality," said Paul
Zarins, a social sciences data librari
an and economics bibliographer.
Librarians are trying their best to

A.
work out the kinks of the new sys
tem. In other systems, proxy services
are often used to allow access to
databases from computers outside
the system. However, because of
technical incompatibilities between
the Stanford network and the Lexis-
Nexis network, this is not yetpossi
ble.
However, Zarins is hopeful that
Stanford technicians will work out
this incompatibility soon. Until then,
Zarins recommends that off-campus
students dial into the modem pool in
order to access Academic Universe.
For those having trouble with
specific searches, there are people
eager to help. Zarins urges students
to contact library staff who "more
than welcome any comments, ques
tions and suggestions.
'if people are having trouble,
come talk to us, and we will help," he
added.
