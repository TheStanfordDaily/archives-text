# Alum Haugen runs for House
## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Growing up, Chris Haugen want
ed to go to UC-Berkeley.
"The Berkeley professors talked
me into going to Stanford," said Hau
gen, the Republican challenging in
cumbent Democrat Anna Eshoo in
the 14th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford. "They
talked about the breadth of the Stan
ford program."
Haugen must have taken the no
tion of breadth to heart. After gradu
ating from Stanford in 1%7 with a
bachelor's in civil engineering and
earning a master's in the same de
partment the following year, he
worked for the United States Army
Corps of Engineers.
But he would spend much of his
career in education — returning to
the Farm to earn a master's in educa
tion in 1985, working as a math
teacher in various schools and even
co-founding a private Christian
school.
Now Haugen approaches another
task, perhaps his toughest to date —
taking on Eshoo.

Haugen's son recalls when his fa
ther made the decision.
"He had mentioned [running for
Congress) a long time ago," said Erik
Haugen, a coterminal student in
computer science. "Then in March or
May he came home for dinner and
said Tm running for Congress.'"
Explaining his decision to run for
office, Haugen said, "It revolves
around what direction the country is
going in. It's a direction that's not
good for families."
Haugen has lived in Palo Alto for
the past 29 years with his wife Janet,
who graduated from Stanford in
1970. They also have two children,
Marni, also a Stanford graduate, and
Erik.
Haugen feels education is a key
issue, and strongly opposes federal
government involvement in school
curricula.
"What I'm supporting is local con
trol of sch(X)ls," said Haugen, who in
1991 co-founded The King's Acade
my, a 450-student junior-senior high
school in Sunnyvale, where he cur
rently serves as vice principal.
He also supports a private school
voucher program for poor and mi-

nority families un
happy with local
public schools.
At the post-sec
ondary level, Hau
gen expressed con
cern that govern
ment dollars would
taint academia's
"search for truth."

He said he would like to "lessen fed
eral strings" attached to colleges.
Big government in general poses a
problem to Haugen, who would also
like to lower taxes.
"I'm steadfastly against that kind
of system that takes money away
from families," he said, referring to
excessive government spending.
Haugen opposes a nationalized
health care system and excessive fed
eral spending on public works pro
jects.
According to his Web site, Hau
gen opposes partial-birth abortions
and supports a strong U.S. defense.
He believes that the United States
should "retain political and strategic
independence."
