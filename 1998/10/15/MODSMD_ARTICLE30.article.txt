Art
NOW — JAN / 99
Catch the just-opened exhibit "Picasso and the War Years: 1937-1945." The exhibit examines the influ
ence on Picasso's art of the period from the Spanish Civil War to the Nazi occupation of France. While
Picasso never depicted actual wartime events, the war's presence looms as a steady and oppressive
theme through the use of personalized signs and symbols, resulting in some of the strongest, most
intense and expressive works of his career. Included are over 40 paintings, 25 prints and drawings, vari
ous sculptures, and other objets d'art. Tickets are $7. The exhibit is at the California Palace of the

Legion of Honor, located in Lincoln Park near 34th Ave. and Clement, San Francisco; MUNI riders can
save $2 on admission by presenting their tickets to the museum cashier. The museum is open 9:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Sunday; call (415) 863-3330 for further information.
