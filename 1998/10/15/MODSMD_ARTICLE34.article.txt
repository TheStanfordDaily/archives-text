### Courtney lake 
Put 10 svelte dancers in body-clinging black 1 vera and sheer
inesh and you normally got the beginnings of .1 Janet
Jackson video. However, throw in a pair ol ja// bands, a
couple ol catchy tunes, and a murder plot and vou normallv have
the makings ol a pretty good musical revival."( hicago" tells the
story ol Uoxie Hart, a nightclub dancer who kills her cheating
lover. Hart then dupes the public and the media In hiring a
shrewd lawyer who ultimately turns her crime into Celebrity
headlines and gets his client acquitted. 112 9
I his touring company of"( hicago" succumbed to ol the
traps that olten hurt revivals. This conipanv strives tit reach the
polished poise and elegance ol its big sister oil broadwav. The
New York production, complete with the likes of Ik-he Neuwirth
and Ann Keinking, has the talent and raw emotional energv need
ed to carry such big song-and dance numbers as "Cell block
Tango" and the opener, "All That la//."
In this production. Donna Marie Asbury in the role ol mur
deress \ eh 11 a Kelly captivates the audience with her rich voice and
smooth vocal patterns from the start and stands out among her
cast. Ms. Ashburv s portrayal ol Kelly has the over-the top charm
and dark, witty sarcasm needed to breathe life into the character.
Yet,"(.hicago" is an ensemble work dependent 011 the" next per
former to deliver the next theatrical punch.
I he punches never rolled. What came next were a series of
solid vet uninspired sets that had technical merit but little else.
Those who may have been fortunate enough to see the New York
or the second touring company of this production will under
stand. I hese sets lacked the needed spark that draws an audience
into the story. With original choreographv by the late, great boh
fosse, whose credits included "A ( horns line" and "Cabaret," the
dance numbers alone should have put the audience on its feet.
Known lor sexy and seductive moves with plentv of rump shak
ing and pelvic thrusts, fosse's choreography was one of the main
reasons why hicago" was revived. However, loose's straight
lines and geometric patterns were left in shahln disrepair bv
intermission. I be actors, while competent, onlv proved that am -
one can look decent doing a ja// box if lie shows enough skin.
In show business there is a term called a "triple threat," which
describes an individual who can sini;, dance and act.
I nlortunately lor this company, the sum ol its parts onlv pro
duces one threat: the threat ol a disappointing and uninspired
show.
