## 'The Write Stuff An interview with Robin Troy 
### Dina Leytes Contributing writer 
Robin Troy is the winner of MTV's
first "The Write Stuff" fiction con
test. Her original 50-page manu
script was selected from 500 entries by a
panel of authors and celebrities including
Mike Mills of R.E.M., author Dale Peck
and MTV News correspondent Serena
Altschul. Troy received a $5,000 advance as
well as the publication of her completed
257-page novel by MTV Books this sum
mer. The fiction contest signifies a new
direction for MTV Books, which has been
quite successful in the past with spinoff
books — the Beavis and Butthead title
"This Books Sucks" sold more than half a
million copies.
Next on the agenda for MTV Books is
"The Write Stuff Short Story Compe
tition," which will select 15 writers, ages
16-28, to be published in an upcoming
anthology. Information and entry forms
for the contest, which runs through Dec.
1, can be found in the back of Troy's
novel, "Floating," or on the World Wide
Web at http://writestuff.mtv.com.
Intermission: Tell me your story.
Robin Troy: Well, I just turned 24. I
grew up in Connecticut, went to boarding
school in New Hampshire and graduated
from Harvard in 1996 with a degree in
English. After that 1 went to work as an
account executive in New York.
I: When did you first hear about the
MTV contest?

RT: I was at work late one Sunday night
when I read about the contest in Tne New
York Times. The submission deadline was
the next day at noon. So out of the blue I
just threw the first 50 pages of my creative
thesis into the mail. Six months later I quit
my job and decided that I was going to try
to make it on my own as a writer. I
planned to move out to Colorado to find a
cheaper place to live and practice my craft.
I was determined to be a writer. The week
end after I quit my job I heard from them
that I was a finalist.
I: Why do you think you wont
RT: My editor was so happy to have
found a story that would appeal to an
MTV audience, but also a wider demo
graphic range as well.
I: Have you always thought of yourself
as a writer?
RT: Yes. I've written my whole life. It
was just something I did in my spare time.
I knew that I wanted to write a creative
thesis my senior year. I was really lucky to
get into some great classes, including one
taught by Jamaica Kincaid.
I: How did "Floating" come about?
RT: It started out as a short story when
I was 15 and I always thought when I had
time someday I'd like to make it longer. I
had been on vacation with my parents. I
made the story up entirely.
It's a story of a family. I really like to
write about places and people that have
lives different from my own. Art to me is
just a form of communication, and if
you're doing it well then you reach out to

those who have lots in common
with you or nothing in common.
The project has really shown me
that I know how to write short
stories. The book is really like a
bunch of short stories linked
together.
I: What particular issues are
you trying to address in
"Floating"?
RT: The book deals a lot with
learning independence and self
reliance so that you know that
the next morning you can get up

and take care of the day. Brian [a
character in the novel] learns how
empowering this is even though his par
ents aren't there to help him out in the
kind of way that he'd like. I think it's
something anyone can relate to.
I: Do you plan on pursuing novel writ
ing further? Is there a second novel in the
works?
RT: I m working on something else now
and I'm playing with construction more
than I did with "Floating." Maybe tying
two plots into one. You know, something
more complex.
I: What writers have influenced you?
RT: Joan Didion — especially her
essays. She has a haunting, spare voice I
find fantastic. Also, Richard Ford, Dale
Peck, Andrea Barrett — I enjoy a lot of
contemporary fiction.
I: Any suggestions for aspiring writers?
RT: I think it's important to realize that

you have good days and bad days, but you
should always work every day. What I nor
mally do is get up around 5:30 or 6:00 a.m.
Mornings are usually my most concen
trated time. I'll get up early and work, but
I usually don't write beyond two in the
afternoon. I figure you have to be disci
plined about it. In writing fiction, I do like
to start with an outline.
I: How would you describe your writ
ing style?
RT: I saw an interview on "60 Minutes"
with Stephen King where he was asked
about his writing style and he said some
thing like, "This is what I can write; this is
what I do write when I have to write." I feel
the same way. It's just what I do. I can't
wait to have the chance to write more. I'm
looking forward to having my writing
develop and I feel that is happening.
