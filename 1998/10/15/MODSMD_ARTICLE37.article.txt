## The 						Whirling Dervishes perform for Lively Arts

cc 112 | '"{he Whirling Dervishes of Turkey": Perhaps
we can begin there. This second performance
JL in Stanford's Lively Arts series was billed
under this heading, with a promise of an "expression of
spiritual ecstasy, love, music and dance."
Yet the performance which took place last Sunday at
Dinkelspiel was quite different. The performance notes
contained a statement written by Dr. Celaleddin Celebi,
the 21st grandson of Jalaluddin Rumi, the 13th century
Turkish poet and Sufi mystic.
"Contrary to popular belief," Celebi writes, "the
semazen's [dervish's] goal is not to lose consciousness or
to fall into a state of ecstasy. Instead, by revolving in har
mony with all things in nature...the semazen testifies to
the existence and the majesty of the Creator."
The first part of the performance featured nary a
dervish, but was rather a medley of poetry and music.
The performance began with a recitation of passages
from Rumi.
"You are an explosive force, calling our dammed-up
rivers to burst forth....Let my soul be your carpet."
For the next hour, the semi-circle of musicians
played their various instruments, which included neys,

ouds, tanburs, kemenches and percussion instruments.
Punctuating this performance was the voice of Kani
Karaca, who half-recited, half-sung sections of the Koran.
Finally, a few minutes before the intermission, two
somber figures emerged on stage, clad in black robes and
tall camel-brown hats. Shedding their robes to reveal
white gowns, the two moved to the stage center and
began a slow, hypnotic twirl.
Immediately, the music took on a new aspect. Paired
with movement, what had formerly seemed wandering
and unfocused now took on a sense of purpose, though
the musical composition itself remained the same.
The dervishes' movements gradually became rougher
and less synchronized. Finally, abruptly, the dervishes
both stopped, bowed quickly, and left the stage, hugging
their arms around their bodies and trembling slightly.
The peculiarity of viewing a religious rite as perfor
mance hadn't occurred to me until the dervishes
appeared: their faces were slack and emptied of emotion,
while their movements had none of the practiced formal
ism one finds in choreographed dance.
This issue was addressed after the intermission, when
the master of the ceremonies, Dr. Kabir Helminski, spoke
briefly on stage. "We are not performers," he began, and
proceeded to sketch the phases of the Sema ritual to fol
low.

Which was, itself, quite beautiful. The dervishes were
foregrounded in this second part, consisting largely of the
same counter-clockwise turning accompanied by the
Turkish musicians. The repetitive nature allowed one to
become tuned to the idiosyncrasies of each dancer: One
moved with extreme precision, another with greater
abandon, a third had a notably regal carriage. Yet
throughout, I remained acutely aware that I was watching
a series of movements whose form was not tailored for
the viewer's gaze.
It's queer to feel like an interloper when attending a
Lively Arts event. Yet what if the "performance" had been
billed with greater accuracy, if the audience had been
given a clearer sense of what to expect?
I find it interesting that the uneasiness created by the
Whirling Dervishes performance is the very emotion that
numerous avant-garde displays of dance or theater seek
to stir within their viewers. However, by announcing their
intentions in advertisements trumpeting edginess and
experimentation, the ultimate blow is dulled.
But that is neither here nor there. Watching the Sema
ritual in performance gave me a clearer window into Sufi
mysticism, helping me to understand the center of
whirling dervish as reason, not emotion. For this, I am
thankful.
