like even night episode with him. Major drama. I couldn't begin to
say. 112 ike, the very fh\st time wc ever took him on tour, lie,wanted to heat up
the .sound man. I don't know the reason. Shit happens.

, Money: I here's nothing but love. I can learn from somebody and some
body can learn from me. lust keep it alive. It's cool. We might have started
something, but so whatL\s long as it's going. \ ause if I stop making music,
I at least want to hear some music that I like.
Q; What do you lliiuk about Puff Daddy and the whole movement of
sampling?
Money: It's blatantly done, hut somebody had to do it. So it's like,"All I
have to do is loop this up." But anybody can loop up a popular song, but
everybody can I come across the way they come across. So you miuht be
like, "Man, all this Huffy shii. Hut we get to the club and that's the shit we
hearing and jump up and start grooving. I can ride with am thing that gets
it cranking, 112 ike, wlien I went to Miami, down south, that blues shit was
jumping Hp; I was like,"Yeah!"

Money. I think all tliats shes saying is that the artist is supposed to
make good shit. 1 mean, I appreciate that. Hut I can respect and appreciate
both sides. The I'uffys |\vho are] doing it'—making the dough — ami
those that are preserving it. What they Uo is what tliev do. I'm not mad at
nobody. My own philosophy is; If you're not especially me
