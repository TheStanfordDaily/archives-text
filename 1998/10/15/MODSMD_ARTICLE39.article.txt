## A
						poet at Stanford We talk with Chris Wiman 
### Sylee Gore Contributing writer 
Christian Wiman, an alumnus of Stanford's
Stegner Fellowship program, is currently a Jones
lecturer in poetry with the Creative Writing
Program. This week, his first book, "The Long Home,"
will be published by Storyline Press.
Intermission: What would you suggest for a person
who thinks he wants to become a poet?
Chris Wiman: I guess what 1 would suggest if some
one is serious about being a poet is to be alone with it for
a while, not to go into any MFA program or any creative
writing kind of environment. See if your interest really
has its roots in you.
I: Is that what you did?
CW: Yes. I spent the four years after college just travel
ing around from place to place doing various things, try
ing to avoid real work, trying to stay out of the economy.
And trying to read and write.
I: How much of a schedule do you work under or live
in?
CW: I'm very rigorous. I envy writers, actually, who are
more flexible. I'm always at my desk at six o'clock in the
morning, I sit there all morning. Work on something,
prose, or poetry, or if I can't do either one, I read. I'm not
sure that's the best way. I have a friend who I think is a
very good poet who is much more easy-going. He waits
for poems to come to him.
I: What was it that drew you to the Stegner program?
CW: I decided I didn't want to go to an MFA, and I
thought the Stegner program would be very different.
Things had really bottomed out for me: I was living in a
trailer in West Texas and was languishing.... And I was
getting work done, but I was going crazy. So I applied for
that, and it came through, and it was an easy decision.
I: What encouraged you to stay on with the Jones lec
tureship?
CW: I finished the Stegner and I was gone for two
years. I did the Stegner when I was fairly young — 24.
And I came back for much the same reason. I was having
a hard time earning money.
I: Do you incorporate other people's criticisms into
what you write? Do you even show your poems to people
for a response?
CW: No. I show them to one person, Simone DiPiero.
And that can be helpful. But I don't show them to people
until a long time is passed, until they're locked in my
head.
/: Do you find it strange then, to teach poetry?
CW: Why?
I: In that setting, people show show their poems to
people the day after they've written them. It seems that
a lot of things inherent in the poetry workshop are
against the things you yourself practice when you write.
CW: Wordsworth says in one of his letters that eventu
ally a poet must go out and claim his own stakes.
Otherwise his judgment becomes so debilitated that he
won't be able to tell what is his really good writing.

I think that when you're in an undergraduate work
shop you're not at the point of deciding what your stakes
are, your real writing, whatever. So having that kind of
feedback can be a really valuable thing. I think that at
some point you've got to grow out of it, you've got to
move on.
I: What do you try to give your students?
CW: I try not to lie. I give them an intensity, a passion
for poetry. 1 don't really feel I can teach someone how to
write poetry. I hope I bring that into the class. That's part
of the reason why teaching's difficult for me — because
it's exhausting.
I: Do you prefer teaching poets about which you're
ambivalent?
CW: What 1 can't stand is teaching poets about whom
I'm passionate, and having them met with indifference.
That drives me crazy. So it's sometimes easier for me to
teach someone like Auden, with whom my investment is
not so great.
I: You have a new book coming out. What is it called?
CW: "The Long Home." It's the long poem, that makes
up about three-quarters of the book, and then 20 pages of
other poems.
I: Is the other poetry more recent, or is it contempora
neous with the long poem?
CW: I didn't write any other poetry during the four
years I was writing that long poem. So there are a couple
of poems that are earlier; most of it is from the year after
the long poem.
I: Is it an autobiographical poem?
CW: Emotionally autobiographical, in a way, but, no.
There are biographical elements of my grandmother and
aunt, but their lives are conflated, and some of the events
are imagined.
But the way in which it's connected to real life, what we
call real life, is very mysterious to me, because I found I
could not imagine things wholedoth. I would have to
have some kind of root in reality and then I could imag
ine whatever grew out from the root. But if I just tried to
imagine, it had no substance.
