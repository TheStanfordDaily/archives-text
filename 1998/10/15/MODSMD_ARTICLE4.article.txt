# Bookstore rebate set at 10 percent

### Marisa Pavlik 
Stanford Bookstore customers who meticulously
saved and turned in their receipts last year can now cash
in for the last time. From Oct. 19 to Oct. 21, they can pick
up rebate checks for 10 percent of their total hook costs
from the last academic year in front of the Bookstore.
The average refund this year is $52.71, according to
Marketing Manager Karen Park. This year's Bookstore
rebate is down from last year's 11 percent because net
sales dropped approximately $3 million to $43.3 million,
according to the Bookstore's annual financial report.
However, Bookstore President Peggy Mendelson
said, "Over the last five years, the Bookstore has become
more financially responsible and financially stable
We've cut expenses to maintain responsibility.
"We've also paid off all of our debts this year, which is
very positive for a nonprofit organization," she said. Last
year, the Bookstore had a long-term debt of $400,000.
According to Park, the main message of the auditors'
report was that the Bookstore was in "strong fiscal
health."
"Sales are down, but they're not down dramatically,"
Park said. "We've decreased operating expenses and
we're in strong financial health."
The new rebate program is also an improvement, ac-

cording to Mendelson. Under the old
program, students collected receipts
from textbook purchases and turned
them in at the end of the school year
to receive a percentage of surplus the
following October. The rebate usual
ly ranged from 6 to 11 percent. But
according to Mendelson, this did not
benefit enough students.
"Students don't want to take the
time to save the receipts and get the
envelopes," Mendelson said, 'it
didn't seem quite fair for only some
students to get the share of the sur
plus."
While only 6,(XX) Bookstore cus
tomers took advantage of the pro
gram last year, the new program has
benefited 14,(XX) already, according
to Park. Under the new program, stu
dents, faculty and staff receive an au
tomatic 7 percent discount at the
$ales counter when purchasing text

books.
"It's much faster and more effi
cient," Mendelson said of the new re
bate system, which the student advi
sory- group advocated.
According to Park, some students
were upset that the discount remains
an automatic 7 percent because they
didn't understand how many more
benefit from the new rebates.
"We're one of the only book
stores to provide rebates for students
buying textbooks and course read
ers," Park added.
When the Bookstore ends up with
a surplus at the end of the fiscal year,
the Board of Directors decides what
to do with the money. But with the
new rebate program, the Bookstore
is spending most of its surplus ahead
of time this year.
The retained earnings are used for
renovating and remodeling tlfc
stores, according to Mendelson. For
example, the Bookstore will open a
store in the Stanford Art Museum
when it opens in January, she said.

"Although we are the only book
store on campus, we feel the real deal
of market pulls and pushes in the
community and in competition of
Web-based stores," Park said.
She cited the increasing competi
tion of general bookstores such as
Barnes & Noble and online stores as
factors affecting sales.
"The business is changing. Com
puters used to be a larger part of our
business and now they're a smaller
part," Mendelson said. "There's
more of a variety in the market."
Because of the Bookstore's small
advertising budget. Park said it plans
to apply more co-op advertising.
Vendors, like book publishers or the
makers of sweatshirts, will pay a per
centage of Bookstore advertising
costs that features their product.
"Our other merchandise general
ly fluctuates," Mendelson said. She
pointed out that last year's athletic
events, such as the l(X)th Big Game
and the men's basketball team mak
ing it to the Final Four, helped sales.
