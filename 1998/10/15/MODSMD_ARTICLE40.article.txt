I: As a professor and a writer, how would you
define a story?
Tobias Wolff; Every time I write a story, I try to
change my own definition of a story. It is something
that I refuse to put limits on. I want to be able to rein
vent the form every time I use it, in some way.
I: What do you feel you contributed to Syracuse's
program [of creative writing] and what have you
learned from your own experiences there?
TW: I brought a lot of seriousness to that program
about what writing could mean to the life of the
writer and to the life of the reader. Writing is of the
greatest importance to me. It's changed my life and I
think it has the capacity to change other lives for the
good. I know it has. Once you know that, you have to
be serious about it.
I: How has it affected your life?
TW: Writing breaks through the veneer or glaze of
the life that we take for granted and shows us the real
ity beneath that veneer. In that way, it's opened my
eyes, it's made me awake.
I: What has been the greatest challenge you have
faced as a writer and what has been your greatest joy?
TW: The greatest challenge is to find that angle; a
vision of the world that really is your own. It is not as
easy as it sounds. To find it and render it as your own:
those are projects for life. For me, the greatest joy is to
finish what 1 think is a good piece of work.
I: Do you adhere to any particular regimen or rou
tine while writing?
TW: I write whenever I can. I am hard-pressed for
time so I really try to seize whatever time I can to
write.
I: Do you have a favorite snack you like to eat or
type of music you like to listen to while writing?
TW: No. Some friends of mine do. Ann Beattie lis
tens to Top 40 while writing. It helps her. If I listen to
music, I cannot concentrate on my work. I don't
drink. I don't smoke any more. I drink water, isn't
that pathetic? What kind of writer drinks water?
I: What is the one thing you wished you knew when
you first began to write that you now know?
TW: Patience.
