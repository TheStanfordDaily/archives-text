# Q & A with Stanford author Lan Samantha Ghana

### Amina Gautier Staff writer 
Intermission: How would you define a story?
Lan Samantha Chang: For me, a story is something
that I feel compelled towards. The germ of a story is usu
ally an event that I feel compelled to write down in order
to understand. This is not really a textbook definition, but
a writer's definition, and a personal definition. I think I
write from a position of incomprehension. Many things
have happened to me or to people I know that I can't
comprehend until I try to write them down.
I: What were your challenges in transitioning from
writing short stories to longer pieces of fiction?
LC: While I was in graduate school, I learned to write
for workshop. Short stories are a good form for workshop
because they provide a coherent, complete piece that gen
erates discussion. My prose tends to be spare, so I find it
very natural to work on short stories.
But I've always been most fascinated by novels as a
reader and a writer. So I was disappointed when I tried to
write a novel during grad school and couldn't get past 30
pages of disconnected little pieces. I didn't understand
how to make a long story.
It wasn't until I was in the Stegner program that I real
ized that writing a long piece requires a different
approach. It means learning an entirely new form. I
began reading and studying novels; I began asking my
teacher and writer friends how they wrote their novels
and eventually I learned that writing something so long
requires a different attitude toward working.
I could no longer work in spurts the way I used to

when I was putting stories up in workshop. Writing
longer pieces is like long-distance running. You have to
train every day, build up your muscles and emphasize
endurance. After a year of studying novels I decided that
an intermediate length would be my best approach and I
decided to try to write a novella. That is how I started
"Hunger." It's not fashionable to say you take your inspi
ration from form, but it worked for me.
I: How much of the narrative "I"in "Hunger" is Min
and how much is Chang?
LC: In some of my short stories, such as "The Eve of
The Spirit Festival," I felt very close to the narrator. Like
me, Claudia is a younger sister whose older sister seems
so much wiser that she is essentially a mystery.
But in "Hunger," I had to reach further to discover

Min. Her life is very different from mine. Confronted
with the emotional challenge of a difficult family, she
chose to stay and keep hoping that things would work
out. Some people see her as passive, and certainly, her
choices were not the ones I would have made, but I
admire her for making them. She held her family togeth
er.
I: The characters in your novella all hunger for differ
ent things. What do you hunger for as a writer?
LC: I think that Tian is a lot like me. I didn't see this
until my best friend pointed it out. I don't know why I
write, but I do know it's something I've always wanted to
do since I can remember. The most miserable years of my
life were the years when I thought I would have to get a
real job and forget about making writing the center of my
life. I hunger for an understanding of what I see.
I: What is the greatest challenge of being a writer and
what is the greatest joy for you?
LC: The greatest challenge still, after eight years of
working, is to concentrate and focus on what I'm writing
about. The most satisfying thing about writing for me is
when I suddenly look up from my work and realize that
I've just been immersed in another world. I just want to
get back there.
I: What do you know now that you wish you knew
when you first began to write?
LC: I think I now know that I should be more patient
with my writing process and less angry with myself when
I don't understand what I'm doing. Over time, I've
learned that it is when I'm stuck and struggling that I can
