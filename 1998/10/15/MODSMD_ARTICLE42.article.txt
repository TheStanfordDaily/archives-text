# for these are jolly good fellows
## The 						Stegner Fellows open up 
### Jeff Cooper Contributing writer 
For a budding writer struggling to find his
or her voice, there are no sweeter words to
hear than "Go ahead and write — we'll
pay for you." Stanford's Stegner
Fellowship, the flagship prize awarded by
the Creative Writing Program, is dedicat
ed to saying just those words. The Stegner
is a prestigious two-year fellowship
awarded to five new fiction writers each
year to support the development of fresh
young faces in the field. Who are these
Fellows?
Intermission talked to two current
Stegner Fellows, Andrea Bewick (a sec
ond-year Fellow) and Bridget Garrity
(just beginning her official fellowship) to
find out.
Andrea Bewick
Intermission: How did get into fiction
writing to start with? When you begin to
think of writing as something you could
make a career out of?

Andrea Bewick: Reading was always
my favorite thing to do; I read all the time
in college. My sophomore and junior years
at [the University of] Michigan, I went
and took some writing classes. I always
had this impression of writing as a life you
couldn't really pursue and be happy. In
particular, it didn't really seem to work out
for a lot of women writers — I'd only real
ly been exposed to the women writers who
committed suicide [laughs).
Then, I had one instructor for a writing
class my junior year, a woman who had
written some really great fiction, and she
was married and had a kid and everything,
and that sort of showed me, "Hey, you can
do this if you want." So I began to really
look at following the career and seeing
what happened.
I: How did you end up as a Stegner
Fellow?
AB: It's one of those fellowships that's
just sort of out there; I'd heard about it
from people. I actually applied twice; I
applied three or four years ago and didn't
get it, and then I applied two years after

that and heard in March or April. John
L'Heureux called me up and left a mes
sage, and I didn't know I'd gotten it for a
few days, until I finally got in touch with
him.
I: Talk about the writing workshops a
little bit. How do they work? Have you
found them helpful?
AB: You need to produce work for the
workshop — we mostly talk about each
others' work, although we'll also talk
about other writers out there, stuff that
people in the group like.
The workshops have been immensely
helpful. Both the faculty and the other
people in the workshop are really great at
looking [at] what you're trying to do,
telling you what the strengths of the piece
are, and where you could tighten it.
They're by far the best writing workshops
I've been in. It's really important to be in a
group like this in order to get better, and
the other fellows have been really wonder
ful, really supportive.
I: Could you talk a little bit about your

personal writing process? What things do
you find work best in getting you started
on ideas? What do you find works best in
editing your work?
AB: When I'm starting a story, I'll usu
ally just sit down and start taking notes
about what it is I want to work on, just jot
down what I'm thinking about the subject,
rather than trying to write whole stories at
once.
As for editing, the fellowship's a big

help, because it helps me to sit
down and get work. It helps a
lot to be required to write regu
larly for a workshop; you feel an
obligation to write just to have
something to show the group.
There usually comes a point
when the story's just lingering,
and it increases your confidence
so much to know that people
are there to read it. Being part
of a community's immensely
helpful; to people trying to
write out there, I'd say to not be
too isolated, even though that's
a natural tendency. Definitely
find people who you trust to
read your work.
/: What are you working on
now — stories or novels or
something else?
AB: I've written short stories;
right now I'm working on a
novel. It's really daunting —
I've been trying to just break it
down day-to-day, to have some
thing to work on every day, so I
can sit down and go to work,
like normal people do (laughs].
Bridget Garrity
Intermission: Could you talk
a little bit about your back
ground as a writerf How did
you decide you wanted to pur
sue writing seriously 112
Bridget Garrity; Well, I'm at
sort of a crossroads right now; I
don't really know if I want to
write as a career, but this is an
opportunity to figure it out.
There's not many programs that
allow you to just write with no
other responsibilities.
I was at the lowa writer's
workshop for two years, where I
got my MFA [Master's of Fine
Arts]. Almost everyone in my
program applied for the Stegner

fellowship; it's
well-known in the
writing world. So I
applied, and lo and
behold, I just got it,
which was great.
The Stegner's the
best of the fellow
ships because it's
two-year, and it
doesn't have any
teaching require
ments. I'm TAing
for Tobias Wolff,
though, this year,
in his Develop
ment of the Short
Story class.

I: How have the workshops
gone for you? Do you find them
helpful?
Garrity: The group has been
really supportive. People really
try to figure out what's positive
about the piece. It's very low
key in some ways. It seems more
laid-back than my MFA pro
gram, which has been a nice
change. It's a lot different, sort
of less ... .rigorous isn't the
right word. But just more laid
back, more relaxed. It's great to
be around people whose first
instinct is the work, and noth
ing else.
I: Could you talk about your
personal process for writing?
What do you do to get started,
and edit your work?
Garrity: I think every story is
a unique process. I might write
one story straight through,
though that's a gift that hap
pens very rarely. The last story I
did though... that probably
took fifteen revisions. It's a very
idiosyncratic process.
I tend to write down scenes
whenever they come to me,
whether it's at the movies or in

line or wherever. Making sense
of those scenes after they're
written down is the worst part.
That's the really painful part
[laugh]. Transitions are very
difficult for me. That's why I
write novels; you don't really
need transitions. You just start a
new chapter [laughs].
I also find, for some reason, I
get good ideas when I'm mov
ing. I could be running or dri
ving or anvthing, but they tend
to come to me then. I don't
know why.
I: What advice would you
offer a budding writer, some
undergraduate who's written a
few stories an is thinking about
writing seriously?
Garrity: I guess my best
piece of advice — the one thing
that's helped me — is to really
only read the best stuff out
there. That's a law of nature;
you're only going to get out
what you put in. So I'd say if
you're going to try to write for
real, only read people that are
really considered masters of the
craft.

Intermission talked to two current
Stegner Fellows, Andrea Bewick (a sec
ond-year Fellow) and Bridget Garrity
(just beginning her official fellowship) to
find out.
Andrea Bewick
Intermission: How did get into fiction
writing to start with? When you begin to
think of writing as something you could
make a career out of?

Andrea Bewick: Reading was always
my favorite thing to do; I read all the time
in college. My sophomore and junior years
at [the University of] Michigan, I went
and took some writing classes. I always
had this impression of writing as a life you
couldn't really pursue and be happy. In
particular, it didn't really seem to work out
for a lot of women writers — I'd only real
ly been exposed to the women writers who
committed suicide [laughs).
Then, I had one instructor for a writing
class my junior year, a woman who had
written some really great fiction, and she
was married and had a kid and everything,
and that sort of showed me, "Hey, you can
do this if you want." So I began to really
look at following the career and seeing
what happened.
I: How did you end up as a Stegner
Fellow?
AB: It's one of those fellowships that's
just sort of out there; I'd heard about it
from people. I actually applied twice; I
applied three or four years ago and didn't
get it, and then I applied two years after

that and heard in March or April. John
L'Heureux called me up and left a mes
sage, and I didn't know I'd gotten it for a
few days, until I finally got in touch with
him.
I: Talk about the writing workshops a
little bit. How do they work? Have you
found them helpful?
AB: You need to produce work for the
workshop — we mostly talk about each
others' work, although we'll also talk
about other writers out there, stuff that
people in the group like.
The workshops have been immensely
helpful. Both the faculty and the other
people in the workshop are really great at
looking [at] what you're trying to do,
telling you what the strengths of the piece
are, and where you could tighten it.
They're by far the best writing workshops
I've been in. It's really important to be in a
group like this in order to get better, and
the other fellows have been really wonder
ful, really supportive.
I: Could you talk a little bit about your

personal writing process? What things do
you find work best in getting you started
on ideas? What do you find works best in
editing your work?
AB: When I'm starting a story, I'll usu
ally just sit down and start taking notes
about what it is I want to work on, just jot
down what I'm thinking about the subject,
rather than trying to write whole stories at
once.
As for editing, the fellowship's a big

help, because it helps me to sit
down and get work. It helps a
lot to be required to write regu
larly for a workshop; you feel an
obligation to write just to have
something to show the group.
There usually comes a point
when the story's just lingering,
and it increases your confidence
so much to know that people
are there to read it. Being part
of a community's immensely
helpful; to people trying to
write out there, I'd say to not be
too isolated, even though that's
a natural tendency. Definitely
find people who you trust to
read your work.
/: What are you working on
now — stories or novels or
something else?
AB: I've written short stories;
right now I'm working on a
novel. It's really daunting —
I've been trying to just break it
down day-to-day, to have some
thing to work on every day, so I
can sit down and go to work,
like normal people do (laughs].
Bridget Garrity
Intermission: Could you talk
a little bit about your back
ground as a writerf How did
you decide you wanted to pur
sue writing seriously 112
Bridget Garrity; Well, I'm at
sort of a crossroads right now; I
don't really know if I want to
write as a career, but this is an
opportunity to figure it out.
There's not many programs that
allow you to just write with no
other responsibilities.
I was at the lowa writer's
workshop for two years, where I
got my MFA [Master's of Fine
Arts]. Almost everyone in my
program applied for the Stegner

fellowship; it's
well-known in the
writing world. So I
applied, and lo and
behold, I just got it,
which was great.
The Stegner's the
best of the fellow
ships because it's
two-year, and it
doesn't have any
teaching require
ments. I'm TAing
for Tobias Wolff,
though, this year,
in his Develop
ment of the Short
Story class.

I: How have the workshops
gone for you? Do you find them
helpful?
Garrity: The group has been
really supportive. People really
try to figure out what's positive
about the piece. It's very low
key in some ways. It seems more
laid-back than my MFA pro
gram, which has been a nice
change. It's a lot different, sort
of less ... .rigorous isn't the
right word. But just more laid
back, more relaxed. It's great to
be around people whose first
instinct is the work, and noth
ing else.
I: Could you talk about your
personal process for writing?
What do you do to get started,
and edit your work?
Garrity: I think every story is
a unique process. I might write
one story straight through,
though that's a gift that hap
pens very rarely. The last story I
did though... that probably
took fifteen revisions. It's a very
idiosyncratic process.
I tend to write down scenes
whenever they come to me,
whether it's at the movies or in

line or wherever. Making sense
of those scenes after they're
written down is the worst part.
That's the really painful part
[laugh]. Transitions are very
difficult for me. That's why I
write novels; you don't really
need transitions. You just start a
new chapter [laughs].
I also find, for some reason, I
get good ideas when I'm mov
ing. I could be running or dri
ving or anvthing, but they tend
to come to me then. I don't
know why.
I: What advice would you
offer a budding writer, some
undergraduate who's written a
few stories an is thinking about
writing seriously?
Garrity: I guess my best
piece of advice — the one thing
that's helped me — is to really
only read the best stuff out
there. That's a law of nature;
you're only going to get out
what you put in. So I'd say if
you're going to try to write for
real, only read people that are
really considered masters of the
craft.
