## The
						Stegner Fellows open up 
### Jeff Cooper Contributing writer 
For a budding writer struggling to find his
or her voice, there are no sweeter words to
hear than "Go ahead and write — we'll
pay for you." Stanford's Stegner
Fellowship, the flagship prize awarded by
the Creative Writing Program, is dedicat
ed to saying just those words. The Stegner
is a prestigious two-year fellowship
awarded to five new fiction writers each
year to support the development of fresh
young faces in the field. Who are these
Fellows?
Intermission talked to two current
Stegner Fellows, Andrea Bewick (a sec
ond-year Fellow) and Bridget Garrity
(just beginning her official fellowship) to
find out.
Andrea Bewick
Intermission: How did get into fiction
writing to start with? When you begin to
think of writing as something you could
make a career out of?

Andrea Bewick: Reading was always
my favorite thing to do; I read all the time
in college. My sophomore and junior years
at [the University of] Michigan, I went
and took some writing classes. I always
had this impression of writing as a life you
couldn't really pursue and be happy. In
particular, it didn't really seem to work out
for a lot of women writers — I'd only real
ly been exposed to the women writers who
committed suicide [laughs).
Then, I had one instructor for a writing
class my junior year, a woman who had
written some really great fiction, and she
was married and had a kid and everything,
and that sort of showed me, "Hey, you can
do this if you want." So I began to really
look at following the career and seeing
what happened.
I: How did you end up as a Stegner
Fellow?
AB: It's one of those fellowships that's
just sort of out there; I'd heard about it
from people. I actually applied twice; I
applied three or four years ago and didn't
get it, and then I applied two years after

that and heard in March or April. John
L'Heureux called me up and left a mes
sage, and I didn't know I'd gotten it for a
few days, until I finally got in touch with
him.
I: Talk about the writing workshops a
little bit. How do they work? Have you
found them helpful?
AB: You need to produce work for the
workshop — we mostly talk about each
others' work, although we'll also talk
about other writers out there, stuff that
people in the group like.
The workshops have been immensely
helpful. Both the faculty and the other
people in the workshop are really great at
looking [at] what you're trying to do,
telling you what the strengths of the piece
are, and where you could tighten it.
They're by far the best writing workshops
I've been in. It's really important to be in a
group like this in order to get better, and
the other fellows have been really wonder
ful, really supportive.
I: Could you talk a little bit about your

personal writing process? What things do
you find work best in getting you started
on ideas? What do you find works best in
editing your work?
AB: When I'm starting a story, I'll usu
ally just sit down and start taking notes
about what it is I want to work on, just jot
down what I'm thinking about the subject,
rather than trying to write whole stories at
once.
As for editing, the fellowship's a big
