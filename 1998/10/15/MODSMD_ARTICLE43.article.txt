"Hunger: A Novella and Stories" (Norton), which combines
the title novella and five short stories in one volume, is Lan
Samantha Chang's first long piece of fiction and it is an exquisite
literary gem. Polished, it stands alone and sparkles.
Chang has won numerous grants, awards and fellowships for
her writing. Her story "The Eve of the Spirit Festival" appeared in
Best American Short Stories 1996. Her fiction has also appeared
in Story and the Atlantic Monthly. Chang has been a Stegner
Fellow and a Jones Lecturer in Stanford University's Department
of English.
Chang's writing is controlled, fine and spare. Each carefully
crafted word is essential. Her stories focus on an inner world of
intensely motivated families — parents and children divided by
desire, memory, generation gaps and longing. The result is a very
compelling collection.
Chang's five short stories portray children seeking to uncover
their families' hidden histories to discover their own identities. In
"Pipas Story," a young girl leaves home to escape her mother's
overwhelming presence. In her attempt to escape where she
comes from, she finds that the past continues to follow and exert
pressure upon her. In"The Unforgetting," a Chinese family moves
to America. The family consciously conceals the memories of
their old life for the good of their American-born son, who
hungers for that very same past.
In the title novella, the narrator, Min, stands by and watches
while her husband's exacting nature consumes her family; his pas
sion to become a musician threatens to destroy them.
Chang's characters all desire and hunger for missing pieces.
They are constantly searching to make themselves and their fam
ilies complete. They leave their countries, their parents, their
memories and their pasts behind in a search to satisfy their indi
vidual hungers. They are motivated by mystery, by craving for
fame, by desire. They investigate the past, searching for clues in
the memories of others. Hope and fear and love drive them.
In the title novella, Tian, the father sums up this inexplicable
desire: "Everyone has things they want to do in their lives. But
sometimes there is only one thing — one thing that a person
must do. More than what he is told to do .. it is what he hungers
for."
"Hunger" is an excellent collection, rich and descriptive. It
shows the haunting presence of history. Chang's book portrays
the immigrant experience with a rare beauty. It poses challenging
questions about memory and loss. "Hunger" shows love's many
faces and reveals the consequences of desire.
