## No conversion here 'Holy Man' is no revelation 
### 
The only thing that shines in director Stephen Herek's latest release "Holy Man"
is Eddie Murphy's bald head. This supposed comedy leaves the audience with a
bland taste in its mouth, on the edge of its seats, wanting to laugh at jokes that
never came.
Murphy portrays "G," a spiritual guru who is on a pilgrimage down the Los Angeles
freeways when he runs into Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum) and Kate Newell (Kelly
Preston). There is not a lot of mystery in the rest of the story line. G ends up helping the
down-and-out Hayman in his career and his love life. This film could be a light-heart
ed comedy about how the unconventional G shows Hayman how his life could be bet
ter. But Herek, who also directed "The Mighty Ducks," decides to throw drama into the
mix, alienating the audi
ence.

G infilitrates Hayman's
staid life and changes his
life in positive ways, such
as helping with the sales of
the Home Shopping
Network, where Newell
and Hayman are directors.
With appearances from
infomercial stars like
Morgan Fairchild, Willard
Scott and Florence
Henderson, G joins the
mix not only to sell the
network's products, but
also to provide spiritual
guidance.
G rises to superstar sta
tus as consumerism and
spirituality are reconciled
through his sales power.
Buying is okay as long as
your soul is in order. While
the money flows in,
Hayman's conscience nags
him for exploiting G.
Hayman finally decides to
get G out of the business,
while shedding the
remainder of his formerly
greedy ways.
Romantically, G proves
useful between Hayman
and Newell. While G
spends the nights on the

floor of Hayman's apartment, he helps to kindle the impending relationship between
the two directors. As G changes Hayman's cynical outlook, Hayman becomes more
appealing to Newell, which leads the two together.
All ends well — Hayman gets the girl, and his life and career are saved. However, so
much is left unsaid that the audience is left wanting more. G's origins are never estab
lished, while other characters, such as Hayman's, are barely developed. No closure is ever
reached. While I agree with not holding the audience's hand every step of the way, the
lack of information here is staggering. The writers should have gone back to the script
to fill in the gaping holes that clearly aren't filled by this lackluster cast.
This movie does have a few redeeming qualities. It is refreshing to see Eddie Murphy
in a character different

from than the slick, recy
cled policeman from
"Beverly Hills Cop." For
fans of a good love story
and mushy scene-ending
kisses, this film does a fair
job with the relationship
between Hayman and
Newell, even though
chemistry is lacking
between Goldblum and
Preston. There is even
some bathroom humor
culminating in a humor
ous scene between
Hayman and his assistant
Barry (an underused John
Cryer).
Overall, this movie isn't
even average, as it is
plagued by predictability.
The performances by
Goldblum, Preston and
Murphy are mediocre at
best and are not capable of
saving the substandard
plot. Save this one for a
Saturday afternoon rental,
when there's no one to talk
to and nothing better to
do.
