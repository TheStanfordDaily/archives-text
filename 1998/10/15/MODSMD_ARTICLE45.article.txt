# 'Tough' luck
## Not enough action here 
### 
Disappointing from the opening still-cam shot on boring dirt gravel to its trite
conclusion, "One Tough Cop" hardly lives up to its name. True, there is a lot
of violence and profanity, and many Mafiosos run around in this thankfully
short film. But a recap of "the most heinous crime of New York City's history," as
portrayed in "One Tough Cop," has so little sting that it feels more like a re-run of a
so-so "NYPD Blue" episode than a classic in the making.
Stephen Baldwin has the role of Bo Dietl, an officer with a long-time partner
addicted to gambling (Mike McGlone, "The Brothers McMullen"). Lucky Bo also has
a long-time friend ("since kindergarten!") known to be a top crime lord and played by
Chris Penn, who most recently had a part in "Rush Hour." I can guess that "Rush
Hour" is probably infinitely more exhilarating than "One Tough Cop."
Upon reflection, I realized that "One Tough Cop" reminded me of another gritty
cop drama, "Donnie Brasco." While I didn't care for that film's overused imagery and
characterizations, 1 thought the acting itself was superb and the directorial talent
shined through during a few scenes.
But "One Tough Cop" does not even have quality acting or camera shots. Baldwin,
best known for his "Threesome" days, shows how limited his acting range actually is.

Periods of crying and anger ring false, which clearly hurts the tense build-up we are
supposed to feel as Bo chooses between protecting his childhood companion and sell
ing out to the Feds. Penn isn't much better as Duke Finnerty, a character lacking depth
from the start. And Gina Gershon ("Bound"), who plays a beauty named Joey O'Hara,
cannot create a magical connection with either of her love partners.
Director Bruno Barreto showed promise in the widely-praised "Four Days in
September," which starred Alan Arkin, but he has clearly faltered here. Barretos
movies have largely been in Portugese, and perhaps that may explain why one of his
first English-only productions suffers from a sluggish beat throughout the investiga
tion of the brutal murder of a nun in East Harlem.
The New York City landscape looked real enough, I suppose. The officers did occa
sionally try to stir up some action and our emotions while trying to investigate the
murder. But in the end, "One Tough Cop" fails on most counts to convince us that the
story played out on the screen has any meaning or believability. This is one movie that
is not a tough act to follow.
