## Brand Nubian 'Foundation' 
### 
a "ir- y ere we 8° again /1 thought
I 1 what we had was over but
JL X here we go again," sing the
Isley Brothers in a sample in the intro
duction to Brand Nubian's "Foundation."
It's appropriate — we haven't heard a
complete Brand Nubian (Grand Puba,
Sadat X, Lord Jamar and Alamo) LP since
their acclaimed debut "One For All," back
in 1990 when we used to "fight the
power" and "fuck the police".
The explosion in recent years of play
ers and their haters, ganja smokas, and
Tony Montana / Shaolin monk wannabes
had seemingly relegated Nubian brand
hip-hop to the fringes of the lowly col
lege market. But while contemporaries
such as A Tribe Called Quest and Public
Enemy may seem to have stumbled or
simply dropped out, Brand Nubian
comes correct.
As the name implies, "Foundation"
goes back, rewinding to themes common
to hip-hop before positivity got played
out. Naive or even dated as some of the 5
Percent-tinged wording might seem (one
track liberally appropriates the oldest of
old-school Black Power raps, James
Brown's "I'm Black and I'm Proud," for
its chorus), the sheer verve of the group's
wordplay keeps the project afloat. Grand
Puba, the most successful soloist from
the camp, maintains his reputation as
one of the sharpest tongues in the East,
alternating between make-you-blush
locker-room humor to mind-boggling
poetry in the same breath. Sadat X rides

shotgun mike for most of the album and
holds his own. No, Sadat doesn't always
rhyme and his trademark loopy voice
couldn't carry him all the way through
his debut LP last year, but in the context
of Brand Nubian it's pure chemistry.
Bolstering the project throughout is
the production. Gang Starr beat-chopper
DJ Premier blesses the opening song,
"The Return," with his trademark drum
combos, while Diamond D finishes the
album with a bouncy title track. In
between, Alamo and Puba's board work
keeps things moving, with guest produc
ers Buck Wild and Lord Finesse also
lending a hand in production. Stand
outs include "Maybe One Day" featuring
guest Common Sense, who over a lilting
Buck Wild beat rips it: "Feeding the mul
titudes with five loaves / Dead men walk
ing with live souls / Some say the gangs is
strange / Our ways have been tribal since
the days of Kemmett."
Not so bright spots are the obligatory
dance / R&B flavored selections, which
thankfully are held to just a few of the 17
full songs. If you weren't quite sure why
hip-hop sucks sucks in '98, just take a lis
ten to "Let's Dance." Former Leader of
the New School Busta Rhymes is left
yelping the irritating chorus.
Still, in a day where hip hop reunions
come too little and either late or never,
"Foundation" is a breath of fresh air.
