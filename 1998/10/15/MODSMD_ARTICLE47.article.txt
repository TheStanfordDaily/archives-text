# Cruel Sea
## 'Over Easy' 
### 
Americans have never heard of the Cruel Sea, so
the band deserves an introduction of sorts. The
five-piece Australian rock group has released six
albums since 1990. The Cruel Sea is one of the biggest
bands Down Under. The band has won ARIAs
(Australian versions of the Grammy) for best group,
album, and song, its albums have gone platinum and the
group has opened for the Rolling Stones in its home
country. In other words, the Cruel Sea is a superstar at
home, but a no-name in the U.S.A.
The reason for the band's international anonymity is
that standard dictator of mass popularity, the hit single.
More to the point, the Cruel Sea has never written one
big enough to bridge the Pacific, and unlike its
Candadian counterparts, the Barenaked Ladies, the band
has not been able to build a grass-roots following in the
States through touring. The Cruel Sea's albums, howev
er, have been nothing short of brilliant, particularly
1995's double-dose of "Three-Legged Dog," a tuneful,
tight dose of swamp-rock, and "Rock 'n' Roll Duds," a
remarkably varied B-Side compiliation. The group's
sound equates roughly to a New Orleans gumbo, with
especially spicy bits of delta blues, Stax / Volt soul, and
surf guitar.
The group's latest album, "Over Easy," builds on its

strengths and puts a heavier emphasis on the bottom.
Ken Gormly's bass is brought to the front of the mix,
adding a funk flavor to the already potent sound. As
usual, the stand-out tracks are the instrumental, espe
cially the almost-techno "13th Floor" and the George-

Clinton-meets-Dick-Dale "Daytona." Another strong
track, "You'll Do," sounds like a natural hit. The song car
ries an irresistable bass riff over crunchy rhythms. The
catchy lyrics are pure frosting.
Unlike most bands, the Cruel Sea has relied less and
less on one or two primary songwriters over the years,
which keeps their recent albums varied. "Over Easy" is
no exception, as all five members contribute successful
tracks. More importantly, Tex Perkins, the group's lead
singer, delivers a strong, natural performance. His some
what forced singing style weakened the band's early
work, but songs such as "Welcome" and "Seaman's
Lament," Perkins' delivery is smooth, even soulful.
Still, the key to "Over Easy" is the group's sound,
which has always been in a world of its own. The band's
influences are so wide that the group can produce virtu
ally any sound imaginable; in the past, the band has cov
ered the Velvet Underground, John Lee Hooker, Queen,
Tony Joe White and Jimi Hendrix. Accordingly, "Over
Easy" cannot be described as having any one style, and
no hyphenated description would suffice either. Only
one word can sum up the Cruel Sea's music —
"Excellent".
