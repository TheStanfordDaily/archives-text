# Joni Mitchell
## 'Taming the Tiger' 
### 
Sporting an impressive
record of 20 albums and
30 years in the music
business, Joni Mitchell has
persistently produced her
brand of mellow folk rock
despite the amorphous
nature of the music industry
around her. With her new
album, "Taming the Tiger,"
Mitchell skims the surfaces
of various musical genres
while staying close to her sig
nature stvle.

Although Mitchell's music has reached the top of
the charts only a few times, her talents seem an obvi
ous source of inspiration for such artists like Tori
Amos and Jewel. Lack of big hits aside, the sheer vol
ume of music Mitchell has produced, as well as the
number of artists who've covered her songs, attests to
the quality of her music and the sincerity of her
artistry. Her songs are soft but have a far-reaching
tone, with lyrics that are honest and up-front. Lyrics
are not her strength, but Mitchell does enough to keep
the spirit of folk music flowing with each tune.
Mitchell starts the album with "Harlem in
Havana," a lazy tune that's half '50s lounge act and
half blues. Like most of the album, this song ambles

with the chill malaise of a Sunday
afternoon, blending almost
seamlessly with the next track,
"Man from Mars."
Throughout the album
Mitchell's unpretentious
thoughtfulness shines through
the sometimes morose lyrics. The
only problem is that she still
holds dearly to the '60s protest
song mentality, though the tunes
are not as politically responsive as
some songs coming out of the
anti-war era. In "No Apologies,"

for example, Mitchell quips, "So what makes a man a
man / in these tough times / as drug lords buy up the
banks / and warlords radiate the oceans / ecosystems
fail."
This artist is genuine in her music and her paint
ings, and that is something to be respected in a time
when bands come fresh on to the music scene spout
ing their "doo-doo-doo"s and "na -na -na"s for the
one-hit wonder cop-out song. "Taming the Tiger"
finds Joni Mitchell being Joni Mitchell, and doing a
good job of it. A few electric guitar gratings and syn
thesized chords spice up the album a bit, but in the
end folk rock remains the foundation.
