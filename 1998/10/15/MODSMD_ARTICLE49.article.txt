# 'Nuggets' are pure gold
## 
### 
It is easy to dismiss
the American rock
scene of the mid
'6os. In our cultural
memory that era is

defined by the pouty, beautiful British Invaders and
the hard-driving, if wistful Motown sounds. In com
parison to these sounds American rock 'n' roll seems
goofy, almost embarrassing — it is the soundtrack to
Ann-Margret beach movies. Yet underneath that
blandness and the slavish imitation of the Brits, there
was that turmoil that produced what is perhaps the
greatest expression of the democratic ideal in the
post-war America — the Garage Band.
The new Rhino 4-CD box set "Nuggets: Original
Artifacts From the First Psychedelic Era 1965-1968,"
an expanded update of the original 1972 double-LP
release, is a treasure chest of lost masterpieces from
that time. Admittedly, "masterpiece" is a strong word
to describe The Leaves' version of "Hey Joe" or "Louie,
Louie" by the Kingsmen. None of the songs in this
anthology feature profound lyrics or intricate instru
mentation, but after listening to "Nuggets" these ele
ments stop being important.
While certainly influenced by the Stones and the
Byrds, the "Nuggets" bands manage to express all of
Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A." anguish, flawlessly
packaged in neat, three-minute packages of fuzz gui
tar bliss. Before American rock downed a Quaalude
with the Eagles and clumsily put on pink eye shadow
with the New York Dolls, the music was a truly local,
popular phenomenon.
Granted, all of these Lemon Drops, the Blues
Magoos and the Brigands may have only been ama
teur bar bands, landing a few club gigs and a single or
two before fading into obscurity. Yet, in their clumsy
quest to get famous, get rich and get laid the guys in

these bands accidentally
invented punk rock.
Listening to Ronnie Peter of
the Groupies growl malevo
lently "I love and live . . .

primitive," locates the heart of punk squarely where it
belongs: the frustrated lives of the suburban kids from
New York and Chicago, L. A. and Portland. These guy
were hardcore way before Johnny Rotten started
squawking about anarchy in the U.K.
Of course, armed with the smirking telescope of
historical perspective, we see a lot of '60s-style silli
ness on "Nuggets". All of the winking references to
love-ins and journeys to the center of the mind can
occasionally make one cringe. The wave of imitators
following overwhelming impact of the British
Invasion also expressed itself in some truly surreal
ways; for example, the Sir Douglas Quintet, represent
ed on "Nuggets" by "She's About a Mover," was com
posed entirely of Mexican kids from San Antonio. But
all that misguidedness only belies a mesmerizingly
articulate working-class sensibility of these garage
bands.
The bands featured on "Nuggets" have only
glimpsed success. While the original versions of
"Wooly Bully" and"I Want Candy" are included here,
the vast majority of the 118 songs on "Nuggets" will
be unfamiliar to the most listeners. This is all the bet
ter. "Nuggets" is a compilation that not only resur
rects '60s has-beens and never-weres, but also con
stantly surprises us with songs that are fresh, genuine
and heartfelt. Rock 'n' roll may have died several times
over since the '60s, but while the contemporary musi
cal necrophiliacs are getting their last jollies, let's take
the advice of The Hombres and "Let it all hang out."
