# Knight life on the Farm
## Journalism fellows find welcome break 
### Marty Beard 
Stanford students may not realize it, but the
press has been infiltrating their ranks for 33
years. Batteries need recharging and so do
professional journalists, goes the philosophy
behind Stanford's John S. Knight Fellowships
for Professional Journalists.
Knight Fellows come to Stanford and audit
classes from many different departments.
They are forbidden to work professionally
during the academic year they spend here at
the Farm, and after that year, they must return
to their previous news organizations.
The only required courses of study for a
Knight Fellow are weekly seminars, during
which Fellows benefit from interaction with
business and political leaders and scholars,
such as Henry Louis Gates Jr, chair of Harvard
University's Department of Afro-American
Studies.
"The program is designed to improve jour
nalism, to give individual journalists s the
chance to study in a concentrated way — to
write better, to take better photos, to broad
cast better," said Program Deputy Director

Professor James Bettinger, a 19X2-83 Knight
Fellow.
No pressure. No grades. Just pure intellec
tual stimulation.
"It's too good to be true, this not having to
answer to editors and deadlines. All pressures
arc lifted." said Knight Fellow DougSwanson,
a national correspondent for the Dallas Morn
ing News.
The program began in 1966 with a three
year. $975,000 grant from the Ford Founda
tion. One of its program officers, James W.
Armsey, wanted to establish a West Coast fel
lowship program to complement the Ford-en
dowed Urban Journalism Program at North
western University and Nieman Foundation
at Harvard.
Fellows receive a stipend of $45.(XX) plus lu
ition and an allowance for books and child
care, a boon since most fellows bring their
families along. The Knight Fellowships pro
gram is directed by Professor James V. Risser.
