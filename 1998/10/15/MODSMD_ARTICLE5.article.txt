# Knight life on the Farm
## Journalism fellows find welcome break 
### Marty Beard 
Stanford students may not realize it, but the
press has been infiltrating their ranks for 33
years. Batteries need recharging and so do
professional journalists, goes the philosophy
behind Stanford's John S. Knight Fellowships
for Professional Journalists.
Knight Fellows come to Stanford and audit
classes from many different departments.
They are forbidden to work professionally
during the academic year they spend here at
the Farm, and after that year, they must return
to their previous news organizations.
The only required courses of study for a
Knight Fellow are weekly seminars, during
which Fellows benefit from interaction with
business and political leaders and scholars,
such as Henry Louis Gates Jr, chair of Harvard
University's Department of Afro-American
Studies.
"The program is designed to improve jour
nalism, to give individual journalists s the
chance to study in a concentrated way — to
write better, to take better photos, to broad
cast better," said Program Deputy Director

Professor James Bettinger, a 19X2-83 Knight
Fellow.
No pressure. No grades. Just pure intellec
tual stimulation.
"It's too good to be true, this not having to
answer to editors and deadlines. All pressures
arc lifted." said Knight Fellow DougSwanson,
a national correspondent for the Dallas Morn
ing News.
The program began in 1966 with a three
year. $975,000 grant from the Ford Founda
tion. One of its program officers, James W.
Armsey, wanted to establish a West Coast fel
lowship program to complement the Ford-en
dowed Urban Journalism Program at North
western University and Nieman Foundation
at Harvard.
Fellows receive a stipend of $45.(XX) plus lu
ition and an allowance for books and child
care, a boon since most fellows bring their
families along. The Knight Fellowships pro
gram is directed by Professor James V. Risser.
who is on sabbatical this quarter.
This year's fellows — 12 American and
eight international fellows — come
from India. South Africa, the Mid
dle East and from all over the Unit
ed States. Among the group, one has
covered the White House for
Newsweek, and several have been
prohibited from practicing journal
ism in their native countries.
" They're a great group, both the
U.S. and international fellows,"
Kisser said. "They come from all
sorts of news organizations and
backgrounds."
Professors who have had John S.
Knight Fellows in their classes have
found them inspiring.
"I've had Knight Fellows taking
my course. Invariably, it's a very
good experience — they are mature
people who have a wealth of experi
ence in real life," said Ernie Young,
co-director of the Center for Bio
medical Ethics.
"Many of them have been writers
for newspapers, or TV producers
that have explored biomedical
ethics issues. They come with some
background, and seek a thorough
foundation in theoretical stuff they
haven't encountered."
English Prof. Diane Middle
brook agrees.
"(letting to know them personal
ly has helped me professionally in
my work as a biographer, particular
ly in writing "Suits Me" [a biography
dI Hilly Upton, a cross-dressing jazz
musician), (iood journalists are ex
emplars dI persistence, and they
know how to find people," Middle
brook said.
The selection committee seeks

three things: intellectual firepower,
demonstrated excellence and seri
ous ambition "to make a mark, and
not necessarily by winning a Pulitzer
or becoming editor in chief of The
New York Times," Hettinger said.
Applicants must have at least seven
years of professional journalism ex
perience.
Past well-known Knight Fellows
include former MTV News Anchor
Tabitha Soren and Susan Faludi, au
thor of the IWI best selling feminist
treatise "Backlash."
Twenty Pulitzer Prizes have been
awarded to Knight Fellows after the
program. Risser, himself a Knight
Fellow in won two for his
work with the Des Moines Register.
His experiences as a Knight Fellow
were so positive that he came back
to Stanford to direct the program.
"It's hard for journalists to step
back and study new things, [espe
cially] with the pressures of 24-hour
news, cable TV and the Internet.
Good journalists need this kind of
time," Risser said.
Following are profiles of three of
this year's Knight Fellows.
Newton Kanheniii
Senior journalist, The Sunday Inde
pendent, Johannesburg, South
Africa
Newton Kanhema has been
banned from the practice of journal
ism in his native Zimbabwe. Now his
adopted nation, South Africa, is also
trying to get rid of him.
Newspapers in Zimbabwe are
controlled by the government, and
in IW2, Kanhema was expelled
from the Harare Sunday Mail on
charges of "embarrassing the gov
ernment" because he interviewed
an opposition leader. So he moved

his career to South Africa since jour
nalism opportunities in Zimbabwe's
private sector are scarce.
"I was fascinated with the [South
African] situation," Kanhema said.
"As a black person. I thought it
would be fascinating to see what it
would be like to report in a segregat
ed country."
As a journalist in South Africa,
Kanhema exposed a 51.5-billion
arms deal with Saudi Arabia and
conducted an interview with Winnie
Mandela in which she criticized the
government.
Last year, Kanhema spent time in
a journalism fellowship at the Carter
Center at Emory University in At
lanta. CNN named Kanhema
"African Journalist of the Year" for
the third time while he was at
Emory. When he returned to South
Africa to accept the award, the
country tried to deport his wife, Jean
Kasiyamhuru, accusing Kanhema of
falsification of immigration papers.
According to Kanhema, the
judge in South Africa who tried to
block the deportation ruling criti
cized the government, saying that it
had gone mad trying to prosecute in
nocent people such as Kasiyamhuru.
"If we had been deported back to
Zimbabwe, I would have to sell
tomatoes to make a living since I
cannot practice journalism there,"
he said.
He regrets nothing about his
South Africa experience.
"The experience I got out of
South Africa was priceless. I gained
a lot. even il I do face deportation,
that won't outweigh the experi
ence."
Meanwhile, Kanhema is happy
to be with the Knight Fellowships
program.

"There is no other part of the
United States I can go and have a
better time," Kanhame said.
His situation is unresolved, al
though former President Jimmy
Carter is advocating Kanhema's
cause to South African President
Nelson Mandela.
After this fellowship ends, Kan
hema wants to return to Africa as an
investigative journalist.
Bruno Lopez
Mexico City bureau chief, Univision
Bruno Lopez started out in jour
nalism the old-fashioned way: as an
office boy at a Mexico City newspa
per, which hired him as a reporter.
He left this paper when he realized
that some employees were supple
menting their incomes with bribes.
Lopez applied to be a Knight Fel
low after covering a hurricane that
had smashed Mexico's Pacific
Coast. He felt that the government
had allowed the people to be killed
by letting them build houses in un
suitable areas.
"I cried. I was glad that I was still
able to cry, because I knew that I was
becoming really cynical. It would be
sad if I were not able to cry any
more," he said.
But he knew then that he needed
a respite. After an unsatisfying so
journ as an ABC news manager that
had Lopez working "like a gopher,"
he was offered a job covering Cen
tral America, Mexico and the
Caribbean for the Arizona Republic
newspaper. After the interview, he
realized that he had fotgotten to re
veal an important detail about his
skills to the editor.
"I forgot to tell him I had not
written in English before. But he
told me, 'Your writing is as mediocre

as anyone else's,' and that it
wouldn't be a problem."
Lopez has been practicing jour
nalism for 25 years, and has studied
archaeology, political science and
journalism.
Linda Gradstein
Israel correspondent. National Pub
lic Radio
Linda Gradstein and her family
had a special concern when she was
named a Knight Fellow: they had to
live within walking distance from a
synagogue. Gradstein and her fami
ly are Orthodox Jews.
She "fell into journalism," as she
puts it, by working as a Hebrew
translator for the Washington Post.
She started writing feature stories
for the Post about events in the Mid
dle East such as the Palestinian In
tifada. But midsized American
newspapers, she learned, needed to
cover these events as well — but
they couldn't afford to maintain
their own bureaus. She ended up
stringing for a number of papers.
Gradstein, who also speaks Ara
bic, has worked in journalism since
1987. She is currently the Israel cor
respondent for National Public
Radio.
