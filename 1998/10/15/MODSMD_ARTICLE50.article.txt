## 'One Wish' 
### 
Canadian-born songstress Deborah Cox's sophomore album,
"One Wish," features carefully selected and beautifully written
songs that have a timeless quality to them, reminiscent of the
ballads on Whitney Houston's first album. Cox has a wide range.
Her voice has matured since her first album, "Deborah Cox,"
when her vocals were sometimes shy and hesitant. On this album
the restraint is gone and in its place are seductive runs and sen
sual songs.
"One Day You Will" shows off Cox's new confidence in her
voice and in her sexuality. In a soft voice she begins with the
refrain: "You don't miss me now / Don't miss me now / One day
you will." In her verse, she warns and predicts: "You'll look inside
your coffee cup and see my face / And you'll realize the sad mis
take you made / And it will be too late." "I Never Knew" and
"One Day You Will" showcase Cox's strong alto vocals, fit to rival
Whitney Houston's or Toni Braxton's.
Reminiscent of the '80s soft R&B duets by Luther Vandross
with Cheryl Lynn, and Lionel Richie with Diana Ross, "We Can't
Be Friends" is a slow, melodic and romantic duet. R.L. from Next
joins Cox on the duet. She complains: "I tried to think of you as
just another love / In my past / That didn't last / But it's not that
simple."
"September," one of the three songs co-written by Cox, is one
of her first steps into hip-hop. On this track her hypnotic voice
combines with delicate guitar and string instruments and floats
over an insistent and booming bass. "Nobody's Supposed To Be
Here" is a mixture of gospel and pop. However, instead of
singing about Cod and religion, Cox sings about past hurts and
new love. She sings: "My heart said no no / Nobody's supposed
to be here / But you came along and changed my mind." Cox's
deep voice is backed by a rich and soaring choir.
Deborah Cox describes her music as a "fusion of R&B; and
pop with a touch of Canadian soul." Though primarily an R&B
album, "One Wish" is an eclectic blend of gospel, pop and hip -
hop. So there's a little something here for everyone, whether you
want to croon along, get up and dance or find some religion.
