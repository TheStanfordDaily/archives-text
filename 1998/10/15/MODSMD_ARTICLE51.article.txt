## Schmuck and Putz From Blaine to Broadway, 'Guffman' delivers 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
cc X A T a ' l ' n 8 f° r Guffman," direct
\ f\ j ed, starring, and written by
V V Christopher Guest, is one
of Putz's all-time favorites. When he
found out that Schmuck hadn't seen this
modern classic, Putz strapped Schmuck
down to a chair and stuck the tape in the
VCR. Here's what the two of them had to
say about it.
Putz: This is one of the funniest films of
the late 20th century. Many critics have
compared this work to Guest's earlier
mock documentary with Rob Reiner,
"This is Spinal Tap," in which he played
Nigel Tufnel, but I think "Guffman" is a far
nobler effort.
"Waiting for Guffman" introduces us to
the pathetic residents of Blaine, Mo., who
are celebrating their town's 150 th anniver
sary. Keep in mind, this town was founded
by Blaine Fabin, who thought he had
brought his expedition to California when
he smelled salt in the air. But it's a good
thing he decided to stay. Otherwise, Corky
St. Clair (Guest), the exiled off-off-off-
Broadway director, wouldn't be able to
take the town by storm.
After moving to Blaine expecting to be
a construction worker, this most flamboy
ant man ends up teaching drama in the
high school and forming the "Blaine

Community Players." For his latest pro
duction, Gorky's job is to present the cul
tural elite of Blaine with a musical history
of the town called "Red, White, and
Blaine." The production's cast includes
Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey), a proud
employee of the Dairy Queen who dreams
of inventing non-fat Blizzards, Ron and
Sheila Albertson (Catherine O'Hara and
Fred Willard), known as "The Lunts of
Blaine," who are accustomed to doing
scene studies at home together with exten
sive notes for each other, and Allan Pearl, a
dentist (Eugene Levy) who claims he
caught the acting bug from his great
grandfather who worked in Yiddish
Theatre — to name a few.
Schmuck: Blaine certainly is full of
some of the quirkiest characters you may
ever meet. I loved the rich history of the
town, especially President McKinley's
famous whistle-stop tour to Blaine, when
a little boy handed him a footstool. From
then on, the town became the stool capital
of the world. That is just about all that
Blaine has to boast about, and it cleverly
makes its way into Gorky's show. When
the troupe starts rehearsals, the film
almost takes on a tragic and sardonic tone.
The players think they are headed towards
Broadway after they hear a critic from the
Oppenheimer organization, Mort Guff
man, will be coming to see the show.

Although I enjoyed the film, I didn't
have the strong inclination to laugh hys
terically like my ridiculous counterpart,
Putz. Guest was definitely the most enter
taining of the bunch. He captured my
attention every moment he presented
himself on film. From his bowl-shaped
haircut to his purple and pink clothes and
his effeminate (to say the least) voice,
Corky had me watching to see what he
would do or say next.
Even though Corky was attention-grab
bing, the rest of the characters seemed
bland and flat, especially Posey as the DQ
worker. From her gum-smacking cheeks
to her nonchalant attitude, 1 never got the
impression that there were any details to
her character. In fact, I felt the whole film
lacked crucial character details that would
enable us to identify with them.
Putz: Lacked details? Did you happen
to notice all the brilliant touches that
Guest added to the film, or are you just as
brain-fried as the residents of Blaine?
I'll give you details: Parker Posey is
cooking a little piece of what seems to be
road kill on the grill when she talks of
returning to the DQ. Catherine O'Hara
mouths all of her husband's lines in her
audition for the musical, and they both
mumble "hubbub hubbub" when they are
supposed to be ad-libbing. The last scene
of the film when Corky exhibits his trea

sures is filled with such inspired lunacy
that it is worth the rental price alone. Who
else would have thought of "Remains of
the Day" lunch boxes, "My Dinner With
Andre" action figures, and Andrew
McCarthy dolls?
There is nothing lacking in this film at
all except for Putz's appreciation for it.
The songs "Stool Rules," "Nothing Ever
Happens on Mars," and "A Penny For Your
Thoughts," should, if you are a normal
human being, have you rolling on the
floor busting a gut.
Schmuck: Maybe because you were
rolling on the floor, I had trouble under
standing some of the lines. For God's sake,
who laughs that way in a film? Right off
the top of my head, I can list off five videos
that I have enjoyed more than "Guffman"
this year.
Putz: And I'm sure they either have
"Batman" or "Porky's" in the title. True,
this film is not for everyone, but for any
one who has worked in the theatre or
knows people who have, it is funniest film
made in a long time.
The bottom line:
Putz: One of the best.
Schmuck: See it if you must.
