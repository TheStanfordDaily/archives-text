# Kurosawa on video
## Rediscover one of film's innovators 
### Jason Varughese 
A little over a month ago, the film world lost one of
its great creative minds, Akiro Kurosawa. The
Japanese director, whose career spanned five
decades, is considered one of the best directors of all time.
Through his use of creative camera angles, coupled with
striking close-ups and innovative stop-motion (slow
motion) technology, Kurosawa created a new, distinct
style of filmmaking, which was copied by some of
Hollywood's most famous directors. He usually wrote his
screenplays and edited his own films. For all those "Star
Wars" fans out there, George Lucas credits Kurosawa's
"The Hidden Fortress" for inspiring parts of the original
trilogy, specifically R2-D2 and C3PO.
It is indicative of the scope of Kurosawa's work that he
could create characters that had a lasting impression on
people. His characters were well developed and well
played (notice the eyes and facial features of Takashi
Shimura in "Ikiru"). He also worked with many of the
same actors throughout his carper. Kurosawa was quoted
in an interview as saying, "The film maker must believe in
something, be honest with himself, and be objective in his
job." Three of his movies show best how this philosophy
materialized in his work. If you're bored with the con
trived movies of late ("Rush Hour" and "Lethal Weapon
4"), I recommend renting some of Kurosawa's work.
1950's "Rashomon," (remade in Hollywood under the
title "Outrage," in 1964, with Paul Newman as the bandit)
was the first Kurosawa movie I watched. In some ways it
was very difficult to understand. We are introduced to a
disturbed man who has just come from an interrogation
regarding the rape of a woman and murder of her hus
band. The man is telling the story to a religious man and
a wanderer on a rainy day in Japan; all are deeply moved

by the events that took place two days earlier.
The couple was walking to a village when a bandit
crossed their path. Most disturbing is the fact that the
three people involved (the woman, the bandit and the
husband, through a haunting channeling of his spirit) all
have very different versions of what happened. We learn
in the end that the narrator has his own version of what
happened, that he actually was present during the terrify
ing events.
"Rashomon" is not just about the rape of a woman and
murder of a man, but about how these events can change
the lives of the people that witness and hear them. In the
end, the idealistic religious man is revitalized by the sud
den goodness of the narrator, while the wanderer goes on
with his usual ways. It is cleverly told through a series of
flashbacks (an unconventional format for 1950), with
vivid imagery and excellent acting.
With "Seven Samurai," released in 1954 (remade in
Hollywood under the title "The Magnificent Seven" in
1960), Kurosawa introduced stop-motion to most of the
film world. Many American directors quickly made use of
the technique — most notably, Sam Peckenpah, in the
shockingly violent western "The Wild Bunch."
In sixteenth-century Japan, villages were at the mercy
of bandits. The bandits would loot helpless villages in
gangs, burning the remains of the towns. Hot-tempered
men in one such village want to fight back, and decide to
enlist the help of samurai.
The search for samurai is taken seriously by Kurosawa,
showing the dejection of the villagers who go without
food while keeping hope alive for the samurai to help
them. They finally recruit seven samurai, who come and
train the villagers to defend themselves. The villagers
grow to respect the samurai, and each samurai adds his
own unique personality to the film. We are not disap

pointed when the bloody final confrontation with the
bandits arrives. The battle scenes are tragic and empow
ering. This is an epic film with a solid cast and a classic
story line.
"Ikiru," filmed in 1952, asks, what would you do if you
had six months to live? Would you spend time with your
family? Would you try to "make a difference?" Would you
have time to be angry with people? These are questions
the hero of the movie deals with after he is told he has a
"stomach ulcer" — a polite way in his community of
being told one has terminal cancer.
Watanabe, the film's main character, is suddenly forced
to reexamine his boring existence at his boring job. He
stops going to work, gets drunk, sobers up, then becomes
intrigued by a younger woman from his office. She is
everything he is not — young, full of energy and happy.
In order to keep from contemplating his illness, he
decides to focus on a project at work — helping a group
of women create and build a park near their home.
The final third of the movie is an intense sequence of
events following Watanabe's death. His co-workers and
family try to understand why he became so engrossed
with building a park. He had kept his illness a secret, and
he was never the type to take on "causes." Kurosawa shows
us how in a few weeks a man can find meaning in his life
through the most familiar thing to him: his dull job,
which actually had the ability to affect the lives of many.
With Kurosawa's death, the film world has lost one of
its greatest directors. However, Kurosawa still lives on
through the legacy of movies that he left behind. To find
more films by Kurosawa, check out Meyer and local video
stores for the above titles and others, including, "The
Idiot," "Ran" and "Kagemusha."
