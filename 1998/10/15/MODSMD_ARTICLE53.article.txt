Dear Roxy,
Please help. I am a Stanford senior living off
campus this year and have just recently
acquired my first boyfriend in three years. It's a
shock to the system, and I'm having a hard time
adjusting. Sometimes I feel smothered. When
we go to bed at night, I just want to sleep and
he always wants to have sex. Sometimes I real
ly would just rather sleep. I know if we stay up
making out, etc, I will be super tired the next
morning. This boy lives with me, so I never get
any work done because when I come home, all
he wants to do is jump me. Sound like an atyp
ical Stanford boy? Yes, well, that's because he
doesn't go to this school, so naturally he has a
normal aggressive, healthy sexual appetite—
one that I'm totally not used to. How do I help
him understand that I can't give him constant
attention as soon as I walk in the door? I don't
want to seem like a prude, or that I don't care
for him, but I feel like I'd be a much more pro
ductive student if he wasn't around.
Overwhelmed by a big lusty penis
My darling Overwhelmed,
Permit me a little ranting. Today is the day
that you kick some freeloading booty. Your
question about sex is only the frosting on this
HoHo. The real bungle lies in the fact that your
man friend has invaded your personal space. No
matter how darling Casanova may be, no matter
how many times he rubs your back and sponta
neously cooks you an omelette, he must move
out. A girl cannot live for long without some
room to call her own.
Take for example, a friend of Miss Sass who
secured herself a single last year. Her boy, on the
other hand, was cursed with a one-room dou
ble, thanks to that game of Russian Roulette we
call the Draw. He moved into her 10-foot-by
-10-foot bungalow and there they lived ever after.
They slept on their sides in the twin bed, they
used the same towels, and she was cranky much
of the time. Nothing tests a relationship like
waking up to find that your boyfriend put your
bra in his nighttime cup of Ramen.
That said, let's move on to sex, shall we? It is
no wonder you feel smothered with a big, heavy
boyfriend on top of you at all hours. Aside from
carrying around a fly swatter and giving him the
occasional smack, two options present them
selves in this case. You can steer him in the right
direction or you can deaJ with it directly.
Women, by our very nature, prefer steering.
Some would call it manipulation, but when it's
done right, it can be far less painful for all
involved. You may have already tried this and
run out of ideas. That's where Miss Sass comes
in.
Idea 1: Make sex quicker
You say you need some sleep, but he always
wants to romp? Give him what he desires, but
keep it short for your sake. A good tidbit to
remember is that guys tend to need much less

hay. Claw his clothes a■ down and
for it. He won't mind that you seem »udd nify
overcome air
take less than ?<) minutes
Idea 2: Make him want it ss
Another fine acquaintan _ of Miss Sass once :
served as a Peer Health r ucator in a dorm on 4
campus, handing out .gßfifmps and the occa
sional condom this lady knewlhat con- 4
dom vending was not her primary role, but she|
also did not want to leave her residents without
a hat in the rain. Her answer? Snugger-fitting
condoms. Available at the SHPRC (in the base
ment of Cowell), these little beauties will fit the
male member tighter than a sausage casing. She
knew that a boy would have to be absolutely rav
enous for sex before he'd willingly use one
(assuming he wouldn't need the small size nor
mally) so she could be sure that the condoms
she dished out were a last resort.
Miss Sass suggests you buy a few yourself.
Next time Romeo looks at you with those big,
horn dog eyes, simper sadly, "Oh, these little
green ones seem to be the only ones I have left."
After a couple times of having his penis vaccu
um-packed, the flames of his passion may die
down a bit (Note: Invest in a tube of lubricant
and apply liberally. The idea here is not to cause
friction and/or weaken the condom. You want
him to have a rougher ride, not a flat tire.)
Idea 3: Talk to him
Tell him you want to wait a few days to build
up the tension. Tell him you have all manners of
infections riddling your frail body. Or tell him
the truth. Being blunt may be your best option
here, and it will behoove you to lay down some
ground rules. Explain 'the bases,' and remind
him that a runner who gets to first or second
does not always round home base.
In the meantime, make a few compromises
yourself. After all, goddess that you are, how can
you fault the lad for becoming a lust-crazed
drool puddle at the very sight of you? Give in a
little more than you might normally, sleep
through a few morning classes and, provided he
does his part to find balance, you'll both be
more satisfied.
Yours,
Roxy Sass
