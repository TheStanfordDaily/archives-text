# Former AG criticizes independent counsel act
## Meese addresses impeachment 
### Sarah Rapawy 
Edwin Meese 111, former U.S. attorney general and
distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution,
spoke yesterday at the Law School about crime and
punishment in Washington, D.C. and the independent
counsel process.
Invited to speak by Stanford's chapter of The Fed
eralist Society, Meese focused on what he considers to
be the unconstitutional nature of the independent
counsel statute.
The Independent Counsel Act, enacted in 1978, al
lows the appointment of a single person, at the initia
tive of the attorney general, to investigate any allega
tions of criminal conduct on the part of the president or
people closely related to the president. The law could
be applied to anyone from cabinet secretaries to top
White House aides. Once the attorney general decides
there is sufficient evidence to warrant a counsel, a spe
cial three-judge federal court handles the appointment.
Congress last renewed the independent counsel
statute in 1994, and will reconsider it for re-authoriza
tion in 1999. Since the first Whitewater independent
counsel, Robert Friske, began investigation in 1994, net
attorney fees have topped $23 million.
Meese declared the independent counsel statute to

be an "outright violation of separa
tion of powers." Under the statute.
Congress holds the attorney general
responsible by law to turn over all
evidence and information. Meese
claims this has "really brought an
arm of the executive branch into the
impeachment process ... before it
was mostly legislative."
If he feels there is sufficient
cause, the president can fire the in
dependent counsel; the counsel can
consequently appeal.
"This is intermingling of the
three branches — an unfortunate
mixture of politics, policy, and crim
inal investigation," Meese said.
Meese is not alone in his conclu
sion that the results of the indepen
dent counsel have been "generally
pretty much of a mess."
Joseph Di Genova, former U.S.

Attorney for the District of Colum
bia and a former independent coun
sel, voiced a similar opinion on The
News Hour with Jim Lehrer Jan. 26,
according to FBS's Web site.
"Mr. Justice Scalia, in his famous
dissent, outlined precisely what was
going to happen with this statute ...
when an unconstitutional officer is
given the sole authority to investiga
tion. a single person with unlimited
resources and no time restraints,"
I)i Genova said. "This statute was a
mistake; it was a constitutional mon
strosity."
Although Meese felt that a nor
mal prosecutor would have come to
a conclusion in the Clinton scandal
much sooner as partisan politics
would not have obscured criminal
proceedings, he was unwavering in
his support of current independent
counsel Kenneth Starr. Meese said
he has known Starr personally for
years and feels he is "acting and has
acted in a very responsible manner."

Referring to Starr's "effective
and responsible" investigative pro
cedures, Meese said, "If Clinton was
innocent, he couldn't have a better
independent counsel than Kenneth
Starr."
As well as questioning the consti
tutionality of the independent coun
sel statute, Meese criticized Wash
ington's latest idea of an intermedi
ate form of punishment — neither
impeaching nor acquitting Clinton.
Suggestions range from the presi
dent having to pay for the trial to
subjecting him to two hours of in
sults and House criticism in a con
gressional well, an idea Meese at
tributed to former president Gerald
Ford.
Meese not only thinks that the
idea of punishment would be a "ter
rible idea, breach of separation of
powers," and a "serious violation of
the constitution," but that any inter
mediate solution would undermine
the power of the executive office

and set a precedent for similar fu
ture congressional behavior.
"If the house doesn't vote im
peachment, Clinton should be re
stored to full office — plea-bargain
ing like a common criminal is de
meaning to the president," he said.
Will Washington's current inves
tigation affect the future of the Inde
pendent Counsel Act? Meese antic
ipates problems for the 20-year old
statute.
"I think this situation will make
people wary of the whole thing," he
said. "1 think there are a lot of rea
sons not to renew the law or to
renew it in a different way."
Meese's remarks were in the spir
it of the general philosophy of the
Federalist Society, an association of
approximately 5,()00 law students
nationwide who favor strict inter
pretation of the constitution and
emphasize the separation of govern
mental powers.
As well as serving as the 75th

United States Attorney General,
from February 1985 to August 1988,
Meese is also an educator, public of
ficial and author.
He was previously a counselor
to President Reagan and a member
of Reagan's cabinet and of the Na
tional Security Council. He was a
law professor at The University of
San Diego from 1977 to 1981 as well
as director of their Center for Crim
inal Justice Policy and Manage
ment,
Born in California, Meese served
as deputy district attorney of
Alameda County before joining
then-California governor Reagan's
staff in 1967.
Having received his undergradu
ate degree from Yale and his law de
gree from the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, Meese responded
to the question of East vs. West
Coast rivalry with a politician's
diplomacy — "I got a good educa
tion at both schools."
