Without Cracking A Book.
Relax. Learning to fly just got a lot easier. And fun. At the Stanford Flying Club, you
won't sit through boring classes or wade through mountains of manuals. Instead
you'll discover our exclusive, interactive, computer-based instruction. With this CD
ROM centered multi-media training system, you learn at your own pace—anywhere
you have access to a computer. It takes you all the way to your pilot's license, tracking
progress as you go. You even get to preview upcoming training flights. Discover how
fun, convenient and affordable getting your Pilot's License can be these days. Join the
Stanford Flying Club. And open up a brand new chapter. Don't be confused by fly-by
night imitations with a lesser safety record. Up to 20% of our available memberships
is open to the public. Call for more details, to borrow a Demo CD, or to try a test flight!
