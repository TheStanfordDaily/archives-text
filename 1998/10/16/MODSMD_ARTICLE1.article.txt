# Phi Delt in intensive care after accident
## College alcohol trend examined 
### Kara Chalmers 
Legislators and academics are
calling hinge drinking a national
problem, and this week has
brought the issue into sharp focus
at Stanford.
However, Stanford students
and staff say the behavior of stu
dents here does not exactly corre
spond to nationwide drinking
trends.
On the national level, a U.S.
Senator's bill urging college admin
istrators to take a tougher stance on
excessive drinking on college cam
puses nationwide awaits the Presi
dent's signature. A troubling na
tionwide study on drinking habits
on college campuses says that al
most half of all students are "binge
drinkers."
"Binge drinking" is defined by
five drinks in a sitting for men and
four drinks in a sitting for women.

at least once in the course of two
weeks. A drink is defined by one 12-
ounce can of beer, one four-ounce
glass of wine, or one shot of liquor.
"This is one of the most important
issues facing America's college cam
puses," said Sen. Joseph Biden, who
drafted the Biden Binge Drinking
Resolution in a press release.
"Last year alone there were at
least IS college students who died in
binge drinking incidents — drinking
so much so fast that it literally killed
them," Biden added.
"Alcohol is involved in most cam
pus rapes, violent crimes, suicides
and fraternity hazing accidents."
The bill outlines six specific activi
ties that colleges and universities are
encouraged to carry out. They are:
• Appoint a task force to establish a
policy on reducing alcohol and other
drug-related problems.
• Provide students with the chance
to live in an alcohol-free environment
• Enforce a zero-tolerance policy
onconsumption of alcohol by minors.
• Eliminate alcoholic beverage
sponsorship of on-campus events.
• Enforce vigorously a college's dis
ciplinary codes against those who vi
olate campus alcohol policies.
• Work closely with the local offi
cials in the town in which the college
is located.
Stanford is already prepared, says
James Montoya, vice provost for stu
dent affairs.
"Our approach is consistent with
those requirements outlined," Mon
toya said. "I believe that no amount
of education, community caring or
punitive measures will ever eliminate
all possibility of students drinking
with severe consequences. A univer
sity can only influence an individual's
behavior so far."
As of this year the only dry hous
ing on campus is in the two housed
sororities — Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Alpha Theta — which are dry
due to national regulations. 'Hie Task
Force on Residential Education's re
port, completed in June 19%, did not

include a recommendation for sub
stance-free housing.
"The task force understood that
this was an important issue, but we
felt that we simply did not have
enough information in order to make
a recommendation on that count,"
said Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for
undergraduate education. "It is nec
essary to be very careful to try to have
a clear sense of how students, faculty,
staff, and the Stanford community as
a whole would be affected, and we
simply did not know at the time."
"We have not always had consis
tent support from students. The com
mitment from students may not fill a
house," said Jane Camarillo, Direc
tor of Residential Education. "Can
we fill a house with people who would
sign an agreement to be substance
free, even for nine months?"
Concerning the "zero tolerance
for the consumption of alcohol by mi
nors" portion of the bill, "Stanford
makes a big effort to ensure that there
is no alcohol served to minors," said
Mary Edmonds, former vice provost
for student affairs, currently a special
assistant to the provost. "The police
do strictly enforce the no-open-con
tainer law. There is no alcohol served
at any athletic events or at any sports
facilities."
"There are so many safety nets
here, but I don't think we can ever do
enough. We just have to be vigilant,"
said Edmonds
The 1997 College Alcohol Study
by Harvard's School of Public
Health, a follow-up to a landmark
1993 study, shows that although there
are more abstainers in 1997, there is
an increased intensity of drinking
among those people who do drink,
meaning people "drank to get drunk"
more often in 1997. The study sur
veyed 914,521 students at 1 Hi col
leges in 39 states.
"Students' heavy episodic alcohol
use, or binge drinking, is by far the
single most serious public health
problem confronting American col
leges," according to a statement from
the study's principal investigator,
Henrv Wechsler.
The study shows that almost half
of all college students are binge

drinkers, and four out of five fraterni
ty and sorority members who live in
Greek houses are binge drinkers. The
study also cites that in 1997 there
were more alcohol-related problems
— from missed classes to drunk dri
ving— than in 1993.
"Fraternity and sorority mem
bers, and especially students who live
in the houses, continue to be at the
center of the campus alcohol cul
ture," said Wechsler.
"Alcohol-related problems have
not been limited to Greek chapters;
there have also been alcohol-related
problems in residences and with stu
dent organizations," said Montoya.
"Although I am unable to single
out our Greek system as the 'center
of the campus alcohol culture,' in
cases where a Greek chapter (or any
residence or student organization) is
found negligent of Stanford alcohol
policy, we will continue to take swift
and severe action against individuals
or organizations responsible."
The student characteristics associ
ated with higher levels of binge drink
ing include being: male, white, aged
23 years or younger, never having
been married, belonging to fraterni
ties and sororities, living in fraternity
and sorority houses, and binge drink
ing in high school.
Mike Martinez, the president of
the Interfraternity Council, does not
feel the results of the Harvard study
are completely representative of the
Stanford undergraduate community.
"Alcohol is not a predominant in
fluence on campus. It really isn't," he
said.
"People come here to receive the
best education possible .... people
don't really look at the party aspect as
a reason to attend, as opposed to the
student body and academics."
Following up on the report of the
Alcohol Task Force of 1996-97, there
will be expanded alcohol awareness
programs throughout the year within
residences, said Carol Pertofsky. di
rector of Health Promotion Services.
"The programs are aimed at fresh
men and are very interactive and dy
namic," Pertofsky said. "[The pro
grams) are centered on the role of al
cohol in student life and responsible

drinking." An advisory hoard of stu
dents and staff, guides the program.
"I have great personal concern for
the students at Stanford, and the
problems 1 have seen them have,"
said Carol Pertofsky. "Our main mes
sage is that heavy drinking is associat
ed with high risk. We advocate that
students drink responsibly."
"One thing we try to do is talk to
students about what to do when a stu
dent passes out. We really want stu
dents to know how to recognize an
emergency," said Pertofsky.
"One of the problems that has to
do with alcohol use at Stanford is the
misconception among students about
how many students actually drink
and actually binge drink," she added.
Mary Edmonds agreed that "what
we've got to establish is that binge
drinking is not the norm."
According to a survey of 1,2(X) un
dergraduates directed by Health Pro
motion Services, 67 percent of Stan
ford students have never engaged in
binge drinking, and 11 percent binge
drink three or more times a year.
Pertofsky says that the survey
shows a popular misconception —
students think that more of their
peers either drink or binge drink than
actually do. Respondents to the sur
vey believed on average that 98.5 per
cent of their peers drank, when actu
ally 80.2 percent do. Respondents
also thought around 80 percent of
their peers binge drank.
"In general, Stanford's profile
compared to other schools is that
harm associated with alcohol is slight
ly lower than the national average.
But when an incident does happen, it
is usually very serious," said Pertof
sky.
"I admire the fraternities who
have taken steps to show they really
care about their members. For the
most part, students at Stanford are
very cognizant of potential conse
quences of drinking," said Pertofsky.
"We live in such a small communi
ty," Pertofsky said. "It is a great act of
caring to keep an eye out for each
other. Our message has worked if one
person says to a friend next weekend
at a party, 'Come on, let's take a
walk.'"
