# Phi Delt in intensive care after accident
## College alcohol trend examined 
### Kara Chalmers 
Legislators and academics are
calling hinge drinking a national
problem, and this week has
brought the issue into sharp focus
at Stanford.
However, Stanford students
and staff say the behavior of stu
dents here does not exactly corre
spond to nationwide drinking
trends.
On the national level, a U.S.
Senator's bill urging college admin
istrators to take a tougher stance on
excessive drinking on college cam
puses nationwide awaits the Presi
dent's signature. A troubling na
tionwide study on drinking habits
on college campuses says that al
most half of all students are "binge
drinkers."
"Binge drinking" is defined by
five drinks in a sitting for men and
four drinks in a sitting for women.
