Resident chases burglary suspect
On his way from the bathroom
to his room in Toyon last Wednes
day, sophomore Ajay Kundaria
found an unexpected visitor in his
doorway. The visitor asked Kun
daria where his roommate was
and then proceeded to leave. He
did not, however, leave Kun
daria's computer.
After the man left, Kundaria
noticed that his Apple Power
book had been stolen. Kundaria
immediately began chasing the
man down a pathway until losing
sight of him at the street.
The suspect is described as an
African-American male, weigh
ing 2(X) to 220 pounds. He was ap
proximately 6 feet tall and about
21 to 24 years old.
"The suspect knows he's been
seen," Kundaria said.
Nevertheless, the thief has
been sighted attempting to enter
Toyon again and RAs have ad
vised residents to keep their doors
locked and to be aware. The same
man was allegedly sighted in
EAST House in the guise of a
salesman.
Kundaria said it was his gut re
action at the time to begin chasing
the suspect, but it was probably
not the smartest thing to do.

"It's not safe to chase after sus
pects," said Del Bandy, a Stan
ford Police lieutenant.
Fire damage at Gilbert
Stanford electricians unoffi
cially estimate damage caused by
Monday's fire in Gilbert Biologi
cal Sciences Building at $250,000,
according to Stanford Police.
A heavy-duty electrical panel
that services all of Gilbert sus
tained heavy damage in the fire
and comprises the bulk of the
price tag.
The fire filled the building with
smoke and forced evacuation but
caused no injuries. Although
power was temporarily cut off at
Gilbert, the building has re
opened with power. Firefighters
first received a call at 5:33 p.m.,
and the last worker did not leave
the scene until 10:15 p.m.
Initially, firefighters could not
reach the fire because of the elec
trical hazard. If firefighters had
shut off the transformer that
caused the fire, they would have
run the risk of igniting a fire in a
second transformer. Ultimately,
they put out the fire with carbon
dioxide extinguishers.
