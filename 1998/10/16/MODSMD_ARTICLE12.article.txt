Fed cuts interest rates
WASHINGTON (AP) —
The Federal Reserve cut short
term interest rates by a quarter
percentage point today, citing
"growing caution by lenders and
unsettled conditions in financial
markets."
The cut made a ho-hum rally
on Wall Street explosive. The
Dow Jones average of industrial
stocks had been up about 1(X)
points before the announcement
and closed 331 points higher at
8,299, its best finish since Aug. 26.
In recent years, it has been
extremely rare for the Federal

Reserve to change interest rates
in between its eight regularly
scheduled policy-setting meet
ings. The last such move came in
1994.
The fact that it did again is a
clear sign of growing concern
about the economy.
"This means that Alan
Greenspan is legitimately wor
ried," said economist Larry
Chimerine of Economic Strategy
Institute. "He realizes that not
only is there going to be a huge
drag on trade from what is hap
pening in Asia, but he is now see
ing consumer confidence start to
slip."
