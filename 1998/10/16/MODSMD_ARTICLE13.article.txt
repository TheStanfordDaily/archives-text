WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi-
dent Clinton kicked off a Mideast
peace summit today by calling on the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to
"break the logjam" over a U.S. pro
posal for a West Bank settlement.
"We must remember as we come
together again that, in the end. peace
is more than a process; it is, in the
end, a destination," Clinton said in a
statement in the Rose Garden after
meeting privately for 42 minutes
with Israeli Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
Flanked by the two leaders, Clin
ton said the negotiations beginning
this afternoon at a rustic retreat on

Maryland's Eastern Shore were
being undertaken with a sense of
urgency after a year and a half of
stalemate. Clinton was flying there
to convene the talks' formal opening,
then returning to the White House,
leaving Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to oversee the weekend
talks.
"This week's talks at Wye River
offer the chance for the parties to
break the logjam and finally take the
next essential steps for peace," Clin
ton said. Although there was no
timetable, officials said the talks
most likely would run through Sun
day.
In separate remarks to reporters,

Netanyahu and Arafat pledged their
best efforts at compromise, while
cautioning that neither side should
enter the negotiations with unrealis
tic expectations.
Netanyahu, speaking to a pack of
reporters in the White House drive
way before departing for Wye River,
said Israelis want first and foremost
assurances that the Palestinians will
"fight terrorism in word and deed."
For his part, Arafat promised the
Palestinians would give a "100 per
cent effort" at Wye. "But no one in
the world can give 100 percent
results."
With the approach of a May
deadline for completing a full Israeli-

Palestinian peace accord, U.S. offi
cials expressed hope for untangling
the complex web of issues on both
sides, to set the stage for a final peace
deal.
Time is pressing because Arafat
has said he will unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state next May if there is
no final peace.
Under a U.S. plan that
Netanyahu and Arafat will discuss,
Israeli troops would withdraw from a
further 13 percent of the West Bank,
giving Palestinians a measure of con
trol of 40 percent of the territory.
Israel wants firmer Palestinian assur
ances of security for Jewish settle
ments in the West Bank.
