Stanford humanities majors
benefit from contributions
of fuzzies and techies alike

BECAUSE MY PAPER just ran an
editorial calling for inquiry into "the
problem with the humanities," I
thought I might as well make my contribu
tion.
In its Stanford-specific sense, ihe "prob
lem with the humanities" is expressed, in
comments from humanities majors that run
roughly as follows: "They might as well call
diis place Stanford 'lech. The scientists and
engineers get all of the glory, and most of
the rest are just pre-professional types who
just want a degree."
I'm about as fuzzie as they come. I'm a
classics major, a major I picked based pure
ly on my love for what I study. Having said
that. I have never perceived a problem such
as the one referred to in that quotation.
()n the contrary, I think that a lot of the
points of complaint — the emphasis on
technical fields, the pre-professionalism,
the high-profile athletics — give Stanford
real advantages for undergraduates in the
humanities. One shouldn't ignore these
advantages out of short-sightedness.
First of all. it's perverse to complain
about something that brings you into con
tact with intelligent people in an intellectu
al setting. A lot of brilliant people come to
Stanford for technical or pre-professional
study. Some of them are obsessed with their
labs or their professional prospects and
never stop to read a book. A lot of them
aren't. Instead, these non-humanists con
tributed immensely to "fuzzie" classes I've
taken. Their brains, rigor and enthusiasm
put them on an equal intellectual footing
with the declared humanists. Those people
don't go to Swarthmore. They come here,
and we humanists are lucky to have them.
However, non-humanists at Stanford

don't just contribute to the humanities by
attending our classes. The humanities also
benefit from many characteristics of Stan
lord that we owe to the non-humanists.
First, there is the question of purpose.
Many of my fellow students have a sense of
drive and purpose that it's sometimes hard
for an undergraduate in a "fuzzie" field to
find. Faced with fellow students who are
learning to build bridges, save lives or just
become rich, I cannot, as a future classicist,
think of my work as self-justifying. I am
made to consider the purpose of what I do,
- J , T n j r V 1 1 „• ~\
and tji<it makes fyr clearer thinking and, in
the end, improves my work.
Therefore, I derive a lot of good from
the driven and hard-working people that
come to Stanford to be programmers or
lawyers. But there's another bunch of my
fellow students who contribute to my stud
ies immensely without knowing it, just by
having a good time.
I've never been a big party guy. I love
going to football games, but I virtually
never have enough time to do it. Hut every
time I hear about someone dancing all night
or taking a whole day to tailgate, watch the
game and live it up afterwards, I stop to
make sure I'm enjoying what I'm doing
instead.
I know many a hard-working student at
an Eastern school who has long since for
gotten to have fun, and makes this a badge
of honor. It's a terrible thing for students to
forget to enjoy their work. Easterners often
think of Stanford's atmosphere as light and
frivolous. For some people it surely is. but
because of those people, I remember to
make sure that I'm enjoying my hard work.
Every undergraduate in the humanities
at Stanford can enjoy the advantages I've
just described. If you truly see them as
drawbacks, you can find other schools
where you won't have to deal with them.
Hut there's a lot you'd lose by leaving the
Farm.
