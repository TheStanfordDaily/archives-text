## Sign here and say 'I love you' 
### 
AS MY RA has
reminded me
many times, my
roommate Jen and I have
yet to complete our
mandatory contract with
one another. Since I am a
law-abiding Arroyo resi-

dent, I will do so here

We, as roommates committed to maintaining
open communication, have decided upon the
following guidelines for our co-habitation. *
The proposal of said guidelines leads us
to suspect that Residential Education
requires us to like and learn from each
other, and that failure to do so will result in
revocation of our dining services privileges
and dishonorable expulsion onto Escondi
do Road. Roommate alimony payments
sound nasty, as we are both dirt-poor
humanities majors. Thus, we will exercise
responsible citizenship and enjoy each
other's company.
Boundaries: What aspects of your personali
ty, values, etc. need to he respected? Posses
sions to he shared?
Ideally, all aspects of our personalities
and values deserve respect. For the purpose
of documentation, however, we recognize
the need to quantify ourselves. Lauren is a
Libra and 12 is her lucky number. Jennifer
has red hair and plays the soundtrack to
"Rent" a lot. Should either roommate
exhibit characteristics which do not fall
under these descriptors, they will be
mocked and / or beaten with reeds.
Lauren offers Jennifer the use of her hair
products, provided that she completes a
request form at least three days prior to
their intended use. Jennifer recognizes that
Lauren may cross into what is not "her half'
of the room, and finds this acceptable.
Schedules: What time restrictions / needs
with respect to any of the following? Work,
study, sleep, noise, vacuuming, and empty
ing trash?
Lauren asserts that she prefers not to
work or studv, and Jennifer maintains that

she will keep her work and study germs to
herself. Should either roommate sleep and /
or make noise in a manner inappropriate to
the Contract, she understands that she will
be vacuumed and /or emptied with the
trash.
Guests: When can they he in the room? How
long? Friends, overnight guests, romantic
partners?
Guests will be welcome on every second
Tuesday of the month, provided that they
are approved by a majority of the room
mates and do not prove to be putzes. They
may remain for as long as they are consid
ered interesting;.style points may be award
ed if the guests bring alcohol. Friends,
overnight guests and romantic partners will
be evaluated by means of breathalzyers. the
Meyer-Briggs Personality Test, and YM's
"Is He The One?" quiz. Guests who frolic
inappropriately in the beanbag chair may
also be vacuumed and / or emptied with the
trash (cf. "Schedules").
Financial Issues: How will joint financial
obligations be handled? Telephone, voice
mail, TV?
Joint financial obligations are moot, as
neither of us has any money. Telephone and
voice mail services may be maintained by
revenues from inappropriate frolics in the
beanbag chair.
Communication: How will you communi
cate when there are problems? Pre-existing
conditions such as snoring? Health issues?
Phone responsibility â€” taking messages,
answering machine messages?
When problems arise, roommates will
prosecute one another with reference to the
Contract. We will implement a "three
strikes" system to address snoring; health
issues will fall under a "don't ask, don't tell"
policy. Phone responsibilities are irrelevent,
as we expect to have no friends at all after
implementing our "Guests" procedures.

We will revisit this contract at least once a
quarter to make sure we are comfortable and
that we are holding to the agreements we

decided on.
In fact, we are confident that through
strict attention to our Roommate Contract,
we may attend to the guidelines of Residen
tial Education and never become real
friends at all. This is fine, for we both have
rich inner lives and are uninterested in the
misunderstandings and personal quirks that
might force us to like each other and detract
from our academic growth.

1 understand the point The Powers That
Be are attempting to make by requiring me
to complete a roommate contract. In fact. 1
agree the values they mention are impor
tant. What I reject is the idea that I can
learn to live by following a written set of
guidelines.
My relationship with Jen is anything but
businesslike; we mercilessly steal each
other's clothes, pillage the refrigerator and
annoy each other with horrible music long
into the night. She is not a clause in my life
plan; she is a talented, complicated and
always-unpredictable part of my world, and
she is one of my best friends. It's nice that
Res Ed encourages me to enjoy her compa
ny, but I don't care about her because of
their influence. I care about her because
she's damn cool.
Listen to your roommate's crappy CDs
sometime. Stay up with her and chat about
her friends at home instead of growling
about your nine 'o' clock section the next
morning. Your MCAT scores won't get any
higher; you will, I'll wager, learn more
about mutual respect than you would by fol
lowing a contract for cohabitation.
And, I would venture to add, learn to tol
erate petty theft now and then. Pilfering is
the sincerest form of flattery.

adds for Jen's sake that there is in fact no
prostitution ring involving her beanhag
chair.
