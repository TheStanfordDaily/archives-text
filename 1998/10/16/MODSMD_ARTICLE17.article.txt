Nobel Laureate overlooked
The Oct. 14 story about Professor B.
Laughlin's Nobel Prize in Physics seems
incomplete without the mention of Dr.
Ferid Murad, a co-winner of this year's
Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.
Dr. Murad. now at the University of
Texas Medical School, was a professor of
medicine at Stanford University School of
Medicine from l l >S() to 1989. He served as
co-chairman of the Department of
Medicine, then acting chairman, and he
was also the chief of medicine at the Vet
erans Administration Medical Center in
Palo Alto.
Although his observations that nitro
glycerin anil related artery-widening com
pounds act by releasing nitric oxide were
made in 1977, when Murad was at the Uni
versity of Virginia School of Medicine, he
continued to refine his observations at
Stanford and later at Abbott Laboratories.
Those of us familiar with his research
thought of Dr. Murad as a reserved schol
ar. deeply absorbed in his scientific work.

We were also aware that he was widely
respected but not addicted to the publicity
games that some researchers endlessly
play in the quest for professional or public
recognition.
Until he received the Lasker Award a
couple of years ago for the same work that
earned the Nobel Prize, even some people
at Stanford were not fully aware of the
importance of his discoveries.
Dr. Murad was recruited to Stanford by
now-Assoc. Dean Kenneth Melmon in
1980 when he Came from IJCSF to chair
the Department of Medicine.
Dr. Melmon began an extensive faculty
recruitment program to replenish some of
the dead wood in the department. In an
interview I published at that time. Dr. Mel
mon confided that the people ne was look
ing for would someday be the Nobel Lau
reates of tomorrow.
Dr. Melmon's choice of Murad was
right on the money if you are among those
Stanfordites who believe science is more
important than marketing. The fact that
Dr. Murad is no longer at Stanford to help

us share his moment of triumph also high
lights the important problem of faculty
retention.
This is a problem afflicting many of our
premier biomedical institutions because of
conflicting priorities forced on them by the
economic pressures of an impossible
health care system, and national competi
tion for highly talented biomedical scien
tists.
Medical schools need to emphasize
excellence in clinical and scientific endeav
ors in the proper balance. Stanford, tradi
tionally a scientific school, confronts a
major challenge in trying to tackle both.

Stop the scramble for tickets
The current basketball ticket crunch
has renewed my frustration with the Ath
letics Department's student ticket poli

cy— a frustration that I've had since I
transferred three years ago from Duke
University.
My frustration stems from two extreme
ly annoying facts. First, students must actu
ally pay to attend varsity athletic events.
Second, tickets are sold on a seasonal
basis.
Whereas it is true that the ticket pack
ages are relatively cheap for most Stanford
students, other students may not be able to
afford them.
Frankly, the idea of making students
pay to support the school is an idea I find
hard to grasp, whether or not people have
problems paying. The blame would most
likely be placed on lack of funding, but I
would find this hard to believe of an Ath
letics Department that has been awarded
the Sears Cup since its inception and has
no issues with selling out to Nike.
Why was there such a large rush on bas
ketball tickets?
Because we're good, and everyone
wants to participate in the action. But not
everyone can participate because season

tickets screw everyone who didn't get
them. Stanford students can't decide to
just go to a game one weekend, unless they
already bought their season tickets a full
three months before.
Without season tickets, any student
could go any time. As a result, the fan base
would increase and so would the intensity
of the students. More students would be
supportive of the school and their basket
ball team, and those 25 percent of the stu
dents at the front of the camp-out line that
couldn't get a damn ticket would get a
chance to see their team.
While at Duke, I witnessed the fan base
expanding because tickets were readily
available, and no one can argue that Duke
students don't appreciate their team as
much as anyone else — even Stanford stu
dents.
Stanford Athletics Department, please
promise your loyal fans that next year will
be different.
