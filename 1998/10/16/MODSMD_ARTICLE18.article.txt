WE LOST OUR house last night.
The University snatched Phi
Delt from the Phi Delts and
today, I'm in the paper immediately with
the opportunity to set the record straight
and give my version of the story.
1 he issues involved in us losing our
house, however, are extremely sensitive,
and 1 have no right to voice any opinions 1
may have at this point. What I will write
about is how it feels to be a Phi Delt now
that it's over.
I'he oldest housed fraternity on campus
has been snuffed out in a moment.
Admit it, you're upset.
You've been up here before. Maybe
you slid down our water slide or ate pig at
Luau. My mother went to Phi Delt Luaus.
Done, gone. Maybe you saw this house
blacklit, covered in black construction
paper, splattered with flourescent paint
with hundreds of people dancing at four
'o' clock in the morning. It was fun.
You know you'll miss us. The SAEs are
going to miss their arch-nemesis. The KAs
are going to miss having a house to blame
things on. Freshmen RAs are going to

miss telling their girls to stay away.
Yearly stories will have to be retired:
We spike beer with ecstacy at blacklight.
We tape sex. We torture pledges. Some
one has to be accused of these things or it
won't feel right.
To be serious, though. 1 think you will
miss us. Phi Delt means a lot to Stanford
and it will not be the same without us. Few
people argue with the fact that this school
has trouble keeping its head above water
socially. There is, at times, a conspicuous
void where a youthful energy should be.
Empty games, silent Saturday nights and
weekend study addicts often remind us
that our university's spirit leaves a lot to
be desired. With us gone, it's bound to get
worse.
Now forget about parties and think
about us.
1 get to speak for hundreds of people
when 1 say that Phi Delt has been the best
part of Stanford. The reason I support fra
ternities is 1 believe we should further any
effort to have students choose where and
with whom they live. It has a vastly posi
tive effect on your life to be surrounded bv

good friends. It was quickly clear to me as
a freshman that I wanted to live in Phi
Delt with the Phi Delts, as it was immedi
ately clear to thousands before me. It's
tragic that this option exists no longer.
How will you remember us?
There are stories about Delta Tau
Delta burning couches, crashing golf carts
and brandishing axes. That's about it,
though. I bet they had notorious parties. I
bet they had committed alumni. I bet they
had an awesome history, but nobody
cares. The Delt house is now some place
called Narnia and that's that.
Some alumni came back to the house
during Homecoming and caught up on
house business. "How are things? Ever
hear this story? What are we in trouble for
at the moment?" Phi Delt has been in and
out of serious trouble for as long as any
one can remember. It's like a really good
inside joke. Alumni come back and are
soothed by the fact that things are just as
they left them. The kitchen is scrappy, the
back deck rages, the basketball court has a
game of knockout going on and we are in
trouble with the University.

My brother was a Phi Delt here and I
feel guilty being around for the end. Con
sidering Phi Delt has long been the black
sheep, we must be total screw-ups to lose
it altogether. It means a lot for alumni to
have a physical location to unite them with
their college memories. Phi Delt alums
won't have that any more and we feel ter
rible.
If you don't care about Phi Delt alums,
think about yourselves. You don't really
want us living with you, do you?
A little piece of Phi Delt might be mov
ing next door to you next quarter and
there's nothing you can do about it. The
only place we won't be is up here on the
hill. But on second thought, I suspect the
new residents might see us up there from
time to time.
By the way, we have the nicest house
on campus. Plush two-room doubles com
plemented by outdoor space aplenty. If
that's not enough, how about a basketball
court and a volleyball court to boot? We
have the coolest bar room I've ever seen
and the perfect layout for parties.
It makes me phvsicallv ill to think of

anyone seeing joe
Montana wearing a Chiefs jersey or
Michael Jordan wearing anything but
Chicago red. Our house has always been
our greatest asset and it is infinitely sad to
think of it forfeited to someone else.
We're not gone yet, though. Yesterday
was a day of sorrow and of great specula
tion. Look for us to handcuff ourselves to
our rooms, throw the biggest party ever or
burn the house to the ground.
Freshmen should come by before it's
over, in case anyone ever asks them about
Phi Delt when we're gone. Our friends
outside the house should help us savor this
place and its memories every day we can.
All I ask of everyone else is to give us a
thought next quarter some time when
there's nothing to do, and admit you liked
having us here.

Matthew Blumenstein, a junior majoring in
psychology, will probably milk this topic
for his column all quarter long. His
thoughts and prayers, and those of his
brothers, are with Michael Howard. We
