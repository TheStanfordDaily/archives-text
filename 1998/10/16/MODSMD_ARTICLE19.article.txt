### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
Five games in three days is a
challenge for any team.
It's the exact challenge the Stan
ford men's water polo team must
face this weekend.

MEN'S WATER POLO

■ Today: No. 3 Stanford (9-2, 3-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
vs. No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara (2-6,0-
3), 3 p.m. deGuerre Pool

■ Saturday - Sunday: Stanford hosts
the Northern California Tourna
ment. The Cardinal plays No. 18
Santa Clara in the Ist round, Satur
day, 10:20 a.m.

The No. 3 Cardinal (9-2 overall,
3-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) will host No. 9 UC-Santa
Barbara (2-6,0-3) today in a league
match at deGuerre Pool. Tomor
row and Sunday, Stanford hosts 16
teams during the Northern Califor
nia Tournament.
"This is a good tournament,"
said Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "You have the best
teams in the nation in one pool."
After last weekend's loss to UC-
Irvine, Stanford dropped from No.
2 to No. 3 in <he national rankings.
This puts the Cardinal in a difficult
position in the tournament as it
must face No. 6 Pepperdine in the
first round.

Although Stanford defeated
Pepperdine 8-5, last weekend in
Malibu, the Waves are still not the
Cardinal's first choice to meet early
in a highly competitive tourna
ment.
"We just had a tough game with
[Pepperdine] down south," Detta
manti said. "We need to be consis
tent in a tournament like this and
it's hard to get up for early games.
But we have to play well early so
we have the chance to advance."
Before facing Pepperdine in a
4:10 p.m. game tomorrow, Stan
ford must first beat No. 18 Santa
Clara in a 10:20 a.m. match.
If the Cardinal wins both of its
first-round games, the squad will
probably end up playing No. 2
UCLA on Sunday at 11 a.m. The
championship match is scheduled
for Sunday afternoon.
An added incentive to perform
well in the NorCal tournament is
that all of the games played this
weekend factor directly into each
team's record. With the best teams
in the nation all vying for the top
seed in the MPSF tournament, the
weekend could play a serious role
in determining postseason posi
tions
"Everything counts. It's just like
regular head-to-head competi
tion," Dettamanti said. "This is a
good opportunity for up tojump up
in the standings. If we get into the

not going to be easy."
In addition to competing against
some top teams. Stanford has also
been dealing with illness. Numerous
players have been sidelined in recent
games and practices due to health
reasons. And in a tournament such

as this. the Cardinal needs to he at

the finals.
"We're still recovering [from the

pretty healthy," Dettamanti said.
" I he key is that we have to use all of
our players to keep everybody fresh.
In a first-round game, you don't
want to have to use your starters the
whole game."

Stanford is counting on its first
string to get things going carlv on so
that the team can be fresh for the
Pepperdine game and the second
round matches. Junior Brian Heif
feron currently leads the Cardinal in
scoring, with 22 points. Senior Ar
turo Rodelo and sophomore Pasi
Dutton each have 11 points, while
seniors Jeremiah Robison and
Layne Beaubien have collected 10.
In preparation for this weekend.

the Cardinal squad has been work
ing on its offense to create more
scoring opportunities.
"We've been working on our
front court offense to get more scor
ing. and also on our six-on-five,"
Dettamanti said. "Right now most of
[our goals are] coming from the fast
break."
On defense, the Cardinal is lead
by senior goalie C'hris Aguilera, with
87 saves this season.
