# Honors Program may get facelift
## 
### Elise Lipkowitz Senior staff writer 
Although University President
Gerhard Casper's announcement of
the Phi Delt incident marked the
emotional zenith of the inaugural
meeting of the 31st Faculty Senate,
the main course was the lengthy dis
cussion of the future of the Honors
Program.
Noting that it was the first study
of the Honors Program since 1%8,
Economics Prof. John Taylor pre
sented the findings from the report
prepared by the 1997-98 Committee
on I Jndergraduate Studies.
"We found that what people
meant by honors is an experience
that involves independent work at
an advanced level." Taylor said. He
added that the goals of such an ex
perience are for the student to syn
thesize and integrate material, en
hance writing and critical thinking
skills, and learn how to think like an
expert.

Honors theses "also provide op
portunities for close contact with
faculty members, an experience that
too few students get," Taylor said.
Ile said that somewhere between
25 and 30 percent of undergraduates
write honors theses and that signifi
cant funding is available to students
both through Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities and through
departments.
However, Taylor emphasized
that there were huge differences in
the numbers and percentages of stu
dents who did honors work in vari
ous departments.
He cited that whereas 40 percent
of biology students write theses,
only 13 percent of economics majors
do. Taylor suggested that this was a
fair comparison given that both de
partments are large and have similar
quantative orientations in their re
search.
"It is a matter of how much en
couragement they get and the cul
ture of the department," Taylor said.
I le also expressed that students
perceive honors theses to be of "high
cost and low benefit.
"A student can graduate with dis
tinction by having a high CiPA,"
Taylor said, noting that such a sys
tem provides a disincentive for
doing more rigorous honors work.
Taylor then outlined the commit
tee's recommendations that includ
ed the development of a Senior
I lonors Studies program within the
Office of the Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education.
Praising the success biology stu
dents have had working with med
ical school faculty on their theses,
Taylor also suggested that Business,
Law School and Institute for In
ternational Studies faculty, as well as
Hoover Fellows, be encouraged to
advise students on their honors the
ses. Finally, he suggested that
greater incentives be provided for
doing honors work through the es
tablishment of a three-tiered recog
nition system of honors, high honors

and highest honors.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
noted the disturbingly high number
of students not pursuing honors .
"I think that just 25 to 30 percent
of students doing honors work is 50
percent of what it should be," Mc-
Call said, noting that this is consid
erably lower than that of institutions
such as Harvard and Princeton.
McCall also supported distin
guishing between distinction and
honors.
"My hope is that Stanford would
have a high honors and highest hon
ors, even if its not in Latin, and my
hope is that students would catch on
to it," McCall said.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni ex
pressed reservations about a tiered
honors program, noting that an hon
ors project is a subjective thing.
"The Biology Department has
vacillated for a number of years
about giving letter grades for honors
research," Simoni said.
Simoni said that the large number
of theses written by biology students
is a result of the "department's cul
ture and well-structured advising."
Psychology Prof. Russ Fernald
said that it was important to remem
ber that "honors isn't for everyone"

and urged the senate to think of
ways for all students to do something
"to eulminate and synthesize their
University experience."
Economics Prof. Roger Noll
urged the committee, this year
under the direction of German Stud
ies Prof. Rob Robinson, to continue
to explore ways to enhance the Hon
ors Program.
Casper assured them that fund
ing would be available should the
program be expanded.
"If we increase our programs in
that area and did it under depart
mental control, there would be no
difficulty raising money. Very few
things appeal to our alumni donors
more than funding for undergradu
ate research," Casper said.
"The discussion was very con
structive and raised the issue for gen
eral faculty discussion," said Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldivar. "It takes an
opportunity like this to make it a
concern. I think we will see some
creative proposals," he added.
LAS program extended
The other major business item at
the meeting was a vote to extend

the degree-granting power of the
master's program in Latin Ameri
can Studies for three years starting
in 1999. After a discussion of how to
best maximize the utility of the two
senior visiting scholars who join the
program each year, the senate
voted unanimously to accept the
Committee on Graduate Studies'
recommendation to extend the pro
gram.
Minor gains popularity
University Registrar Roger
Printup also announced that the
minor for undergraduates, which
was introduced in the fall of 1996,
has gained popularity. Printup said
that 234 members of the Class of
1998 graduated with minors.
Printup noted that students often
cross disciplines when pursuing mi
nors programs, earning bachelor's of
science degrees with minors in hu
manities fields or bachelor's of arts
degrees with minors in scientific
fields.
"One of the objectives of having
minors was to have some cross-fer
tilization between disciplines and I
think that was happening," Printup
said.
