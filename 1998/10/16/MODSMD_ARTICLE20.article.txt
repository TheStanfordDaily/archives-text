### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Just when you think you have
time to breathe, think again.
After a huge game last weekend
against the defending national
champions, the Stanford men's soc

cer team (8-3 overall, 1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) faces an
other set of crucial games this
weekend.
Tonight, the No. 7 Cardinal
faces off against No. 6 Washington
(10-1 overall, 2-0 MPSF), and bat
tles Oregon State (5-3-1 overall, 1-1
MPSF) on Sunday.
Despite a 1 -0 defeat at the hands
of the Bruins, Stanford is riding a
wave of confidence entering these
matches.
"We are going in with a lot of
confidence. We lost [to UCLA] but
I think we proved ourselves we can
play with anyone, anytime, any
where," said senior captain A.J.
Sauer. "We are looking to build on
that game."
After the momentum break of
the UCLA loss, Stanford can't wait
to get back on track again.
"When we are disappointed with
results, we can't wait to get out
there and do it again," said redshirt
sophomore goaltender Adam Za
pala.
"We feel that the Washington
game is a game we should win.
Everyone is anxious in a good way
to get out there and play," Zapala

added.
At this point of the season, with
the way the Cardinal has been play
ing, the next step is to turn these
confidence-building performances
into wins in the scorebook. And the
team feels that this could be the
weekend to make everything come
together.

"It is our game to break through

So far this season, Stanford has
balanced its attack between several
players.
Sauer leads the team with four

only five.

another great opportunity this

can rectify things quickly," he
