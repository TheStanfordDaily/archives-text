# Hoping to get back on track
## No. 7 Cardinal to battle No. 6 Washington Huskies tonight 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Just when you think you have
time to breathe, think again.
After a huge game last weekend
against the defending national
champions, the Stanford men's soc

cer team (8-3 overall, 1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) faces an
other set of crucial games this
weekend.
Tonight, the No. 7 Cardinal
faces off against No. 6 Washington
(10-1 overall, 2-0 MPSF), and bat
tles Oregon State (5-3-1 overall, 1-1
MPSF) on Sunday.
Despite a 1 -0 defeat at the hands
of the Bruins, Stanford is riding a
wave of confidence entering these
matches.
"We are going in with a lot of
confidence. We lost [to UCLA] but
I think we proved ourselves we can
play with anyone, anytime, any
where," said senior captain A.J.
Sauer. "We are looking to build on
that game."
After the momentum break of
the UCLA loss, Stanford can't wait
to get back on track again.
"When we are disappointed with
results, we can't wait to get out
there and do it again," said redshirt
sophomore goaltender Adam Za
pala.
"We feel that the Washington
game is a game we should win.
Everyone is anxious in a good way
to get out there and play," Zapala

added.
At this point of the season, with
the way the Cardinal has been play
ing, the next step is to turn these
confidence-building performances
into wins in the scorebook. And the
team feels that this could be the
weekend to make everything come
together.

State, 3 p.m., New Maloney Field.

"It is our game to break through
and turn some heads," said sopho
more forward Corey Woolfolk.
So far this season, Stanford has
balanced its attack between several
players.
Sauer leads the team with four
goals and seniors Jamie Clark,
Simon Elliott and Adam Siegman
have scored three goals each, with a
total of nine players scoring on the
season.

The Cardinal's midfield and de
fense have also contributed to the
team's success, allowing only five
goals thus far.
The Huskies have run out to an
impressive start this season them
selves.
After graduating many of its key
players last year, Washington has
kept its offensive firepower com
ing. The Huskies have tallied 32
goals on the season, while allowing
only five.
Leading the way for Washington
are senior Matt Annis, with eight
goals, and junior Wes Hart with five
goals and an MPSF-high 11 assists.
While Washington has played
only two ranked teams, Rutgers
and Portland, the Cardinal has
faced five already this season.
"With such a strong schedule, it
is tough not to lose some games,"
Bobby Clark said.
"But we bounce back, and this is
another great opportunity this
weekend. With this schedule, we
can rectify things quickly," he
added.

"We are looking forward to the
games," said junior defender Andy
Hemmerich. "When playing the
better teams, you have to play hard
in all of the games. The harder the
schedule, the more fun the season
is."
And with this competition, the
Cardinal is improving by the game.
"These tough games will help us
in the long run. The more tough
games we play, the better team we
are becoming," Siegman said.
Both Washington and UCLA
have opened MPSF play with two
wins, and a Stanford victory over
Washington would keep the Cardi
nal in the MPSF race.
A loss, however, would put
Stanford further out of first place,
and the Cardinal can not afford this

with its tough schedule.
"We have to keep on winning to
keep the pressure on and challenge
for the league title," said junior de
fender Gerard Davis.
On Sunday, the Oregon State
Beavers will he shooting to upset
the Cardinal.
After an extremely important
game on Friday, it would be easy for
Stanford to let down its guard
against the Beavers.
Last year, after an upset victory
over Washington, Stanford settled
for a tie against OSU.
This year, however, the Cardinal
knows the importance of the OSU
game as well, and won't let itself he
come complacent.
"It won't be hard for us to get
motivated [for OSU] because of our
team maturity," Sauer said, reflect
ing on the team.
"We showed against [Sacramento
State] that we aren't that type of
team," he added.
Last year. Stanford's first impor

tant win of the season was a 1-0 vic
tory over the Huskies in Seattle.
However, the two teams again
faced off in the first round of the
playoffs and Washington knocked
the Cardinal out of the tournament
with a 1-0 overtime loss.
A final motivating factor for the
Cardinal this weekend is the loss of
senior Eric Vandevelde.
In his first game back from miss
ing three weeks with a minor foot
injury. Vandevelde suffered a bro
ken leg last Sunday against Sacra
mento State.
It was Vandevelde who scored
the game-winning goal last season
over the Huskies.
Stanford, however, is trying to be
optimistic about Vandevelde's sec
ond injury of the season and use it as
motivation.
"The loss of Eric Vandevelde
