## Walsh returns as Card heads to OSU, Oregon 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Half of the report from the
trainer's room is great news for the
Stanford women's volleyball team.
The No. 7 Cardinal (12-2 over
all, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference) will
get one of its floor leaders back on
the court this weekend, as junior
outside hitter Kerri Walsh will re
turn to action against Oregon State
(1-6, 11-7) tonight.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (12-2. 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at Oregon
State (1-6.11-7). 7 p.m.

■ Sunday: Stanford at Oregon, 1
p.m.

The second half of the injury up
date, however, is not so good.
Junior outside hitter and defen
sive star Jaimi Gregory was diag
nosed with torn knee cartilage and
will he out of the Stanford lineup
indefinitely.
The loss of Gregory, a veteran
hack-row leader, comes at a bad
time for the young and inexperi
enced Cardinal squad
"Losing Jaimi thins us out from
a personnel standpoint," said Stan

ford head coach Don Shaw. "She
gives us great ball eontrol and de
fensive ability out there, so we
could struggle in her absence."
Stanford will attempt to avoid a
breakdown in its service receive in
the absence of Gregory.
Heading into tonight's match
with Oregon State, which is coming
off its first conference victory, such
a letdown appears to be the only
chance for the Beavers.
Shaw doesn't see it that way.
"As with so many Pac-10 teams,
I don't know what to expect,"
Shaw said. "Oregon State lost four
or five seniors, just like we did.
Their new starters have been on
the roster for a couple years, they
just haven't been primary players.
"They haven't done well in the
Pac-10 so far this year, but I am not
sure why. They have looked really
good on the films 1 have seen, so we
have to be prepared for a hard
match."
Regardless, if Stanford can con
tinue its recent improvement and
play to its potential, the Beavers
should become just another harm
less stop on the Cardinal's road to
what would be its fifth straight con
ference title.

Tara Conrad prepares to attack. Stanford spends the weekend in
Oregon.
Oregon, which is tied with Ore
gon State for eighth place in the
conference, should also be an easy
victory for Stanford.
Again, Shaw warns that his team
cannot overlook the Ducks.
"They are capable of playing
very well at times," Shaw said.
"You also have to figure that they
are going to play their hardest
against us, because a win could turn

their whole season around.
The addition of Walsh to a line
lip that dismantled California in
three quick games, however,
should be more than enough to
guide Stanford to a pair of victo
ries.
"It will he interesting to see how
Kerri tits hack into the puzzle after
a week off," Shaw said. "The fact
that the younger players filled in so
well puts us in a great position.
"Kerri will provide a nice boost
to those younger players, and by
demanding attention from oppos

ing defenses, will give them an even
better chance to contribute."
In particular, freshman middle
blocker Sara Sandrik is coming off
a spectacular performance against
Cal, in which she tallied 14 kills and
six blocks.
Freshman outside hitter
Michelle Chambers also continued
her solid play and improvement,
adding seven kills and live blocks.
Along with the newfound fresh
men weapons, sophomore middle
blocker Jennifer Detmer figures to
be a kev contributor for Stanford.

The powerful sophomore leads the
team with 3.71 kills per game and
1.78 blocks per contest.
Thus, setting its lineup to maxi
mize the depth and performance of
its numerous capable players could
be the hardest challenge for the
Cardinal this weekend.
But according to Shaw, there are
no simple wins in the Pac-10.
"This year in the conference,
every match is such a toss-up,"
Shaw said. "Oregon is so hungry to
figure out the winning formula."
Shaw's Cardinal already has it.
