## Walsh returns as Card heads to OSU, Oregon 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Half of the report from the
trainer's room is great news for the
Stanford women's volleyball team.
The No. 7 Cardinal (12-2 over
all, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference) will
get one of its floor leaders back on
the court this weekend, as junior
outside hitter Kerri Walsh will re
turn to action against Oregon State
(1-6, 11-7) tonight.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (12-2. 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at Oregon
State (1-6.11-7). 7 p.m.

■ Sunday: Stanford at Oregon, 1
p.m.

The second half of the injury up
date, however, is not so good.
Junior outside hitter and defen
sive star Jaimi Gregory was diag
nosed with torn knee cartilage and
will he out of the Stanford lineup
indefinitely.
The loss of Gregory, a veteran
hack-row leader, comes at a bad
time for the young and inexperi
enced Cardinal squad
"Losing Jaimi thins us out from
a personnel standpoint," said Stan

ford head coach Don Shaw. "She
gives us great ball eontrol and de
fensive ability out there, so we
could struggle in her absence."
Stanford will attempt to avoid a
breakdown in its service receive in
the absence of Gregory.
Heading into tonight's match
with Oregon State, which is coming
off its first conference victory, such
a letdown appears to be the only
chance for the Beavers.
Shaw doesn't see it that way.
"As with so many Pac-10 teams,
I don't know what to expect,"
Shaw said. "Oregon State lost four
or five seniors, just like we did.
Their new starters have been on
the roster for a couple years, they
just haven't been primary players.
"They haven't done well in the
Pac-10 so far this year, but I am not
sure why. They have looked really
good on the films 1 have seen, so we
have to be prepared for a hard
match."
Regardless, if Stanford can con
tinue its recent improvement and
play to its potential, the Beavers
should become just another harm
less stop on the Cardinal's road to
what would be its fifth straight con
ference title.
