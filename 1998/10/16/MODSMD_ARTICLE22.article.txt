# Stanford's got quite the Crew
## Crew team heads to Boston for Head of the Charles Regatta 
### Justin Virgili 
Stanford's men's and women's varsity crew teams
look to gauge their place in the collegiate rowing
world as they travel to Boston, this weekend for Sun
day's Head of the Charles Regatta.
The Head of the Charles race is perhaps the most
prestigious race in America with nearly every colle
giate crew team, the national crew team and several
international crew teams in attendance.
"It's a regatta with 10(),0(X) people [and it's] a great
rowing atmosphere that you can't find other places."
said Stanford men's head coach Wieslaw Kujda.
The Head of the Charles race is the first race of the
season for both the men's and women's teams.
The race "gives us an idea of the national picture,
though it's very, very early for us," added women's
head coach Aimee Baker.
The fall season does not count toward the teams'
national rankings. Only the spring season races count
towards national standing and for qualifying for the
NCAA and Intercollegiate Rowing Association
Championships.

Kujda described the fall races as a way to "create
the long-distance race early in the fall and break the
boredom of training."
Stanford, however, might be at a slight disadvan
tage on Sunday.

provement as they enter just their fourth week of prac
tice.
Kujda predicted, however, that this could actually
help in tine way.
The team is "more hungry because we know we're
a little behind," he said.
"Starting late is an issue, but we came back to
school earlv to get cr. nkinu and everyone came back
