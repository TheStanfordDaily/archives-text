# Stanford's got quite the Crew
## Crew team heads to Boston for Head of the Charles Regatta 
### Justin Virgili 
Stanford's men's and women's varsity crew teams
look to gauge their place in the collegiate rowing
world as they travel to Boston, this weekend for Sun
day's Head of the Charles Regatta.
The Head of the Charles race is perhaps the most
prestigious race in America with nearly every colle
giate crew team, the national crew team and several
international crew teams in attendance.
"It's a regatta with 10(),0(X) people [and it's] a great
rowing atmosphere that you can't find other places."
said Stanford men's head coach Wieslaw Kujda.
The Head of the Charles race is the first race of the
season for both the men's and women's teams.
The race "gives us an idea of the national picture,
though it's very, very early for us," added women's
head coach Aimee Baker.
The fall season does not count toward the teams'
national rankings. Only the spring season races count
towards national standing and for qualifying for the
NCAA and Intercollegiate Rowing Association
Championships.

Kujda described the fall races as a way to "create
the long-distance race early in the fall and break the
boredom of training."
Stanford, however, might be at a slight disadvan
tage on Sunday.

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CREW

■ Sunday: Stanford competes in the Head of the Charles
Regatta, in Boston.

Due to the quarter system. Stanford does not start
as early as many schools in the East. What this means
is that Stanford's teams must continue their rapid im
provement as they enter just their fourth week of prac
tice.
Kujda predicted, however, that this could actually
help in tine way.
The team is "more hungry because we know we're
a little behind," he said.
"Starting late is an issue, but we came back to
school earlv to get cr. nkinu and everyone came back
in good shape," added the men's
team coxswain Dan Matross, a ju
nior.
In addition to less training,
Stanford's coxswains (the team
members that pilot the boat) face a
technically difficult Charles River
course.
"It has seven bridges and only
two boats can go under an arch at
once," said freshman rower
Catherine Pligavko. "The course is
really curvy, a complete U-turn at
one point and there is also shallow
water."
The team will have only two
practice sessions on the river for
the coxswains, Matross and senior
Kipper York, to acquaint them
selves with the treacherous course.
"It will be a fun course to cox,
lots of turns, bridges, it'll keep me
on mv toes," Matross said.

Senior Nate Matter, one of the
men's team captains, expressed his
confidence in Matross.
"Dan did a great job at the Stan
ford Fall Regatta," Matter said. "It
was a pretty curvy and narrow
course."
Another obstacle for Stanford
will be its high starting number in
the race.
In crew head races, all teams
line up at the starting line together,
but leave two at a time at 15-second
intervals.
Both the women's and men's
team was assigned fairly low start
ing positions in Sunday's race in
Boston.
"It's tough because we will be
racing the clock and will never see
the top teams," Baker said.
Stanford received these starting
spots because the crew teams have
not competed in the Charles River
race for several year.
Starting placement, in crew
races, is based on past perfor

mance.
Despite these concerns Kudja
and Baker remain optimistic.
"They have to execute what
they learn from practice, there's no
magic," Kudja said. "Pull hard,
simple as that."
Baker added her thoughts on
the race, streesing that it would
serve more as a trial for the Cardi
nal.
"I'm anxious to see where we
are. I'm not going to place a whole
lot of importance on [the race]."
added Baker.
The race also iias implications
for the future of Stanford's rowing
program.
Matter said the team has been
trying "to appeal to athletic stu
dents. We want people to come out
and try rowing because that's how
we can build a team."
Baker echoed these sentiments
and added. "I think you're going to
see a big improvement in the fu
ture."
