Along with the Beijing expan
sion, the Latin American study
abroad programs in Santiago, Chile
and Puebla, Mexico will soon be ex
panding their curricula and re
sources.
"Spanish is the most highly en
rolled foreign language, and for
many years, there has been a vision
[in regards to the Spanish-American
program]," said Russell Berman, di
rector of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, as he announced the new ex
pansions for the program at the Fac
ulty Senate meeting yesterday.
In 2(XX), students will be allowed
to enroll for the spring quarter in
Santiago, as well as the currently
available winter and fall sessions.
The Puebla prografn, which
began with focal areas in economics

and anthropology, will include a vi
sual arts focus in its new curriculum.
Berman stressed that the new vi
sual arts program will allow students
to "build on the rich Mexican tradi
tions in the arts."
Along with these enrichments in
the program, higher standards for
language preparation have been an
nounced. A minimum two-year lan
guage requirement wilJ be set for the
Puebla program and one year for
Santiago.
Also in store for the year 2(XX),
students looking for an opportunity
to head towards Argentina now
have their chance.
Specialized study modules for the
spring quarter will soon be initiated
