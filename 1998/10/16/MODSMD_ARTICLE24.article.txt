# Cross Country teams off to ASU Invitational
## Final tuneup before Pacific-10 Championships for No. 2 women 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
Last call to get on board the
championship train.
That is the motivation behind the
women competing for the No. 2
Stanford cross country team at
today's Arizona State Invitational.
While the previous weeks' meets
have provided very competitive op

ponents as well as outstanding indi
vidual runners, today's competition
at Freestone Park in Gilbert. Ariz.,
serves asa final tuneup for the eham
pionship portion of the season. It will
mark the last race for the Cardinal
women before they head to Eugene,
Ore., for the Pacific 10 Conference
( hainpionships on Oct. 31.
The 18-team field made up of 10
Division I programs, one Division II

program, unci seven junior colleges
includes sixth-ranked Arizona as
well as 12th-ranked Northern Ari
zona. Therefore, the meet should
provide some good inter-district
competition. The competition how
ever, is not expected to he of the
same caliber as Stanford has seen of
late.
Stanford, along with Arizona and
Northern Arizona, plans to ap
proach this meet a little differently
than those of the past.
For one, Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna and assistant coach Beth
Alford-Sullivan plan to rest some of
the Cardinal's key runners, includ
ing sophomore Julia Stamps.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

■ Today: No. 2 Stanford competes at
the Arizona State Invitational, 4:30
p.m.

In addition to Stamps, the coach
es will likely sit freshmen Caroline
Annisand Melindi Elmore.
"We'll probably rest our younger
women," Lananna said. " This way
they go into the Pac-1() and the re
gional meet with some fresh legs."
It is highly likely that both Ari
zona and Northern Arizona will em
ploy the same strategy, holding out
their top runners. For Arizona, that
may mean no Amy Skieresz and
Tara Chaplin, the first and second
finishers at last weekend's competi
tion.
Missing from Northern Arizona
could be Rikki Pederson, Emily Al
lison, and Amy Swier. the 16th, 19th
and 23rd-place finishers at Pre-Na
tionals.
Despite what might be consid
ered watered-down competition, the
race today may be the most impor
tant of the year for some of the Car

dinal runners.
"This time of year our champi
onship team is not 100 percent de
cided or defined," Sullivan said.
"We have a lot of depth this year and
I think people are still in the position
to be vying for spots
Lananna agrees and feels like this
meet will provide more than just an
other victory if all goes well for the
Cardinal.
"I think there are still some things
that we need to fix and this is just one
of those chances," he said.
Likely to be on the starting line
today at 4:30 p.m. are redshirt
sophomore Courtney Adams and
freshman Colleen Flaherty, both of
whom have seen limited action this
season but are possible pieces to the
championship run. Other possibili
ties for the Cardinal include sopho
more Alvssa Pagon and freshman
Maurica Carlucci.
One purpose the meet will serve
"is for some of the athletes who have
not had the chance to race that much
to get a good solid competition in,"
Lananna said.
Even though many of the top
women are unlikely to be with their
teams at the start of race, Lananna
still expects his team to be pushed.
"1 think what we're looking at is
that there will be front runners,"
Lananna said.
"Some of these [junior colleges]
have some great front runners. They
won't be challenges in terms of a
team, but they have traditionally had
some very strong [foreign] runners
that have come in and are waiting to
get used to the academic routine be
fore going to a Division I school," he
added.
But whether the junior colleges
provide the push or not. the desire to
make the postseason squad should
give the Cardinal the necessary mo
tivation to perform strongly.
