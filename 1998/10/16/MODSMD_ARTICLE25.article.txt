## 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
With the Pacific 10. Western Re
gional and NCAA Championship
meets just around the corner. No. 1
Stanford will use today's Arizona
State Invitational in Gilbert. Ariz.,
to fine tune "the Machine" while
seeking just the right formula for
late-season success.
And although the lineup of op
ponents certainly cannot compete
with that of last week's Pre-NCAA
meet, formidable team foes as well
as individual stars will test the Car
dinal's top ranking.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford competes at
the Arizona State Invitational, 5
p.m.

Leading the charge against Stan
ford will be No. 5 Arizona, led by se
nior Adbi Abdirahman. Abdirah
man was seventh at last year's
NCAAs and also proved his merit
on the track, winning last year's Pac
-10 10,000-mcter race.
Joining the chase for a team vic
tory will be No. 23 Northern Ari
zona and host Arizona State, both of
which Stanford head coach Vin
Lananna expects will provide some
good competition.
Stanford, however, is prepared
to show some of its big guns as well.
Ail-American seniors Brad and
Brent Hauser will lead the Cardinal
harriers in just their second meet of
the season, and sophomore
Jonathan Riley, an Ail-American

last year, marks his return to the
trails with his season debut today.
Juniors Don Kennedy, Mike
Devine and Jeffrey Fischer will also
compete alongside sophomore
Thomas Murley and redshirt fresh
man Jamey Clifford.
Last year, the Cardinal took
home the team trophy at the Sun
Devil Invitational, scoring 47 points
compared to the 73 of second-place
Dine College.
Lananna has very specific goals
in mind for this year's Invitational.
"This meet will provide us anoth
er opportunity to practice the strate
gies we will need at the champi
onship meets," Lananna said. "It
will be our goal to compete well and
gauge our fitness level before head
ing into the Pac-10's."
On the minds of many of the Car
dinal athletes will be the desire to
win a spot on the squad for a cham
pionship meet.
But Lananna indicates that win
ning a spot among the top seven run
ners on one of the nation's most
dominant teams will not be easy.
"We will select our squads for the
Pac-l()'s, Western Regionals, and
the NCAAs based on several fac
tors. including performances in
meets and the particular strengths of
each athlete in order to put our
selves in the best position to per
form at the highest level on that
day,"he added.
Freshman Jonathan Stevens will
be one of those fighting for a spot on
the championship squad.
The Cardinal will hit the course
at 5 p.m. today.
