Rep. Anna Eshoo says she can
sum up the goal of her legislative
agenda in three words.
"Education, education, educa
tion," she said.
Eshoo has more than a civic in
terest in higher education in there-

gion. She re
ceived her bache
lor's degree from
Canada College
in Redwood City.
Her daughter
Kathy attended
graduate school
at Stanford, and
her son Paul went

to UC-Berkeley.
"Wc always have a lot of rivalry."
Eshoo said.
With less than three weeks be
fore the Nov. 3 general election
Eshoo finds herself in a familiar po
sition. Comfortably ahead of her
nearest opponent, Chris Haugen.

the three-term Democrat represent
ing Stanford in the 14th Congres
sional District continues to legislate
today while looking toward the lu
tu re.
"The plan for the future is to push
ahead with the kind of work I've
done in the Congress," she said. "To
he effective, to be fearless, to be un
afraid. and to really speak with pas
sion on behalf of the people of the
14th District.
Stanford senior LaNitra Walker,
vice-chair of Stanford Democrats,
met Eshoo recently at a voter regis
tration event in Palo Alto.
"She's definitely trying to make
sure that once you get into college
you don't come out of it $ KK).(KK) in
debt." Walker said. "She's interest
ed in what college kids have to say
and what kinds of issues and needs
they have I'll say that's one of the
benefits of having her as our con
gresswoman."


Eshoo
Eshoo said the support of Stan
ford community has been vital to all
of her campaigns and she has
worked to respond to the needs of
the I Jniversity.
"I'm exceedingly proud to repre
sent Stanford I Jniversity and to have
it as part of one of the jewels in the
crown of my congressional district,"
Eshoo said.
"For the students, I hope that my

record is one that is inspiring to them.
It's the young people 1 pay most of
my attention to. So the decisions I
make are really the long-term deci
sions — what's going to speak best to
the next generation in the country."
Eshoo has a long political track
record in the Hay Area, beginning in
1980 when she was elected the first
woman chair of the San Mateo
County Democratic Committee. In
1992, Eshoo won the first of her
three House terms.
She currently serves on the
House Commerce Committee,

which oversees technology, health
and the environment — all vital to
the local economy, she noted. In
1993, Eshoo was instrumental in se
curing funding for the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center.
Ben Brink, Class of '74, who chal
lenged Eshoo for her congressional
seat in 1994 and 1996, said that it
would take a particularly strong
campaign to defeat Eshoo this year,
adding that he felt the district was
quite pleased with its representative.
"She certainly listens to her con
stituents," Brink said. "She is cer

tainly not an inattentive member of
Congress, and representation is one
of the things you elect people for,
not just issues."
Eshoo sidesteps charges by the
Republican challenger Haugen,
who has painted himself as an out
sider while seeking to portray Eshoo
as a tool of big government.
"Whether someone's an insider
or an outsider — or however they
characterize themselves — it's the
voters that will make that judge
ment," Eshoo said. "I have confi
dence in the work I have done."
