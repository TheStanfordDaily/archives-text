agenda in three words.
"Education, education, educa

at Stanford, and
her son Paul went

to UC-Berkeley.
"Wc always have a lot of rivalry."
Eshoo said.
With less than three weeks be

nearest opponent, Chris Haugen.

"The plan for the future is to push

Stanford senior LaNitra Walker,

"She's definitely trying to make
sure that once you get into college
you don't come out of it $ KK).(KK) in
debt." Walker said. "She's interest
ed in what college kids have to say
and what kinds of issues and needs
they have I'll say that's one of the
benefits of having her as our con
gresswoman."
