# Independent counsel law examined
## Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox among panelists 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
On a cold fall morning in 1973,
Archibald Cox. a Harvard professor
and spccial prosecutor in the Water
gate investigation, walked solemnly
to the National Press Club to make a
televised appeal to the American
people. Cox knew his time as special
prosecutor was running out — Presi
dent Nixon would soon order his fir
ing in hopes of quashing the investi
gation into the president's role in the
Watergate scandal.
"The agonizing question was
whether the country would under
stand what was at stake," Cox said at
last night's discussion of "The Future
of the Independent Counsel," held in
a packed Kresge Auditorium.
"The country rose up spiritually
and morally and saw that the rule of
law would prevail." he said. " The im
portance of Watergate was the coun
try's reaffirmation of the ancient
principle essential to individual liber
ty — even the president must be sub
ject to the rule of law."
Public outcry over Nixon's subse
quent order for the firing of Cox and
Attorney General Elliot Richardson,
known as the "Saturday Night Mas
sacre," was a key factor in Nixon's
resignation, and in the passage of the

Independent Counsel Act of 1978.
The act, which created the ad-hoc po
sition of independent counsel and
separated it from the Justice Depart
ment, was intended to ensure that the
"Saturday Night Massacre" would
never be repeated.
At last night's panel. Cox, Law
Profs. Gerald Gunther and Patricia
Karlan, and Duquesne University
Law Prof. Ken Gormley agreed that
the role of the independent counsel is
in need of serious reform.
Cox voiced skepticism for the fu
ture effectiveness of the act that must
either be renewed by Congress or will
expire in June 1999.
"I am genuinely doubtful. At the
minimum, major changes, greatly
narrowing the use of the [act] and
some other changes are required,"
Cox said in an interview yesterday.
"Even if changes were proposed, I
am unsure if 1 would be for reinstate
ment [of the act]."
Gormley said that although he has
great respect for current Indepen
dent Counsel Kenneth Starr, he be
lieves Starr has neglected to ask him
self, " 'What happens if 1 go too far?
What happens to the President?
What happens to the courts? What
happens to the rule of law?' "
The act "was meant to be very spe
cific and used very cautiously — the

[independent counsel] must exercise
restraint... or destroy the very insti
tution he or she was hired to protect,"
Gormley said.
Panelists disagreed on which re
forms to institute. Gunther suggested
that the office of the independent
counsel be "sharply limited from its
present scope," but that it also be
made a permanent organization.
Making the office permanent, he
said, would relieve the pressure on
independent counsels to "stake their
career" on the investigation of one in
cident.
Gormley suggested that the inde
pendent counsel be made a full-time
job — as it was for Cox — to create in
centive for the counsel to finish the in
vestigation quickly. Gormley also
said the office should be limited in its
jurisdiction, in order to prevent pros
ecutors from springing "almost at will
from one subject to the next."
Cox suggested that the office be
restricted to investigating only the
president and a few other senior offi
cials and to investigate only those
abuses of power committed by these
officials while in office or while seek
ing office. He also recommended a
time limit on all investigations, such
as 18 months with the possibility for
extension.
Gunther noted that although he

believed Starr's investigation is au
thorized by the independent counsel
statute, he feels that Starr has shown
poorer judgment in his investigation
of Clinton than Cox did during the
Watergate affair.
"I didn't expect in my lifetime to
see two possible impeachments, and I
didn't expect to see two independent
prosecutors with the balance and in
tegrity of Archie Cox," Gunther said,
inciting an outburst of resounding ap
plause from the audience.
Cox was quick to differentiate be
tween the Watergate affair and the
current presidential controversy.
"Watergate was a grab bag of
wrongs, but pretty much involved
abuses of official power, and many in
volved the violation of the civil liber
ties of individual citizens," Cox said.
"The present imbroglio doesn't in
volve either."
However, Cox did criticize the
president's actions in the Lewinsky
scandal.
"Clinton's misconduct was a dis
grace to himself and the office," Cox
said.
He added that the president's ac
tions have added to a trend toward
cynicism about politics and govern
ment, and a reduced belief among
American citizens in common good
and community spirit.
