# Family of former Juniperan publishes book of his works
## A 						legacy of works 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
David Pianko was only here for
a brief while. He entered Stanford
as a freshman in the fall of 1995,
joining the class of 1999 and set
tling into Junipero with his class
mates.
Eight months later, in March, he
took a leave of absence. He needed
time to deal with the auto-immune
disease, Weber-Christian syn
drome, which has plagued him
throughout high school. Sadly,
David was not able to return for his
sophomore year. He died later in
1996.
Pianko's family is unwilling to
let him be forgotten. In order to
preserve his memory at Stanford,
at his high school or for anyone else
who did or did not have the oppor
tunity to know him, his family has
privately published "The Edge," a
collection of his fiction, poetry,
plays and essays.
"[The Edge] has a lot of come
dy in it, his sense of different val
ues, his interest in sports, music
and making fun of things, sides of
him that people never had a chance
to truly know, particularly at Stan
ford, and even people that knew
him well," said Ira Pianko, David's
father. "When someone is lost at
that age it's so hard to rationalize
and explain that. We wanted to
perpetuate his memory."
The book illuminates Pianko's
sense of language, his familiarity
with rhythm and tone and a sense
of how words should work togeth
er. It also demonstrates Pianko's
love for writing and his passion for
intellectual pursuits.
Highlighted in the book is his
concept of history: a sense of how
the events of time and even the
passage of time itself affect the in
dividual.
His interest in the personal im
pact of the Holocaust shapes some
of the book's darkest and most
powerful pieces.
Ira Pianko said that there was,
"A piece that we never saw until
[after] he passed away, when we
were searching the computer. His
last line asks if it wrong to want to
be remembered. This is a way to re
member him for his abilities. In his
short life he touched a lot of people
and a lot of people were affected."
Pianko's work was turned into a
book posthumously. As with with
any posthumous work, there is a
question of the author's lack of
consent in the publication.
His father, however, said that
the family was unconcerned with
intruding.
"To me, creative artists will al
ways tell you it's not ready yet, it's
not finished," Pianko said. "I re
member when he was applying to
Stanford he was putting together a
slide portfolio and I said what
about this one? And he said no. no
it's not ready yet. Artists will al
ways say they aren't ready yet,
often while they are doing work of
great quality. We didn't feel that

we were violating his privacy. It's
personal, but it's wonderfully per
sonal."
The book is not for sale, but in
stead is available through the Pi
anko family under the private im
print of Thea Press.

"Thea was what David called
things that needed to he called. His
car and his rubber chicken were
Thea. So we thought that David
should have his own publishing
company," said Pianko.
A copy of "The Edge" has also
been placed in the Stanford li
braries.
The Pianko family feels that his
writing is the best way to remem
ber the many other facets of his life
and personality.
"I was just talking to David's
best friend the other day and he re
members saying to David come on
let's go run, and David would say
no he wanted to stay home and
write. And if he hadn't done that
we wouldn't have this to remember
him by," said Pianko.
"I know I probably will not live
long. I am watching my body crum
ble before me. My skin is scarred,
my head weary from the persisting
fevers. I used to be able to run.
Every day after school, I would
venture into my backyard and play
basketball for hours. Some days I
was Jordan, other afternoons 1
could be found emulating rising
college stars. Now, I cannot even
stay awake at 4 p.m. munching on
Honey Nut Cheerios
"It is almost amusing — I. who
has feared death since early child
hood, will live too short a life. My
intellect has not weakened to
where 1 cannot appreciate the
irony. To be honest, despite the
tearing at my soul, knowing fate's
outcome is mollifying. I was always
tenacious, a perfectionist, never
perceiving anything as being done.
Since my nameless and idiopathic
sickness has been engendered, my
eyes tear when I try to read. And
frankly, I don't care, perusing wild
dog comic
"I would guess the easygoing
sentiment is due to the still remain
ing ambiguity. Death is always im
minent, but I had often dreamed of
aging old — making a mark on the
world. Is it wrong to want to be re
membered?"
