After falling off a balcony at the
Phi Delta Theta house at approxi
mately 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,
21-year-old senior Michael Howard,
a member of the fraternity, remains
hospitalized and in serious condition
at Stanford Hospital.
A subsequent investigation re
vealed that the Phi Delts had violated
terms of their probation and, as a re
sult. will lose their house at the end of
fall quarter.
Last spring, a Phi Delt pledge was
seriously injured in an alcohol-relat
ed incident on a weekend retreat.
Dean of Students Marc Wais, after
receiving a recommendation from
the Greek Judicial Board, banned al
cohol at Phi Delt functions for one
year as part of the fraternity's proba
tion.
Howard's injury was also related
to alcohol consumption, according to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Howard, who had been drinking.

fell 20 feet from the balcony to the
concrete below and was not discov
ered until 8 a.m. the next day. At that
time, paramedics took him to the
Stanford Medical Center where he
underwent surgery and has remained
since.
Despite the severity of Howard's
injuries, members of the Greek Judi
cial Board stressed that the Phi Delts
lost their house because they violated
their probation and not because of
the tragedy.
"The event brought to light the
fact that the Phi Delts did not follow
the stipulations that had been laid out
for them," said Greek Judicial Board
co-chair Brian Pilko, a senior.
The probation stated that any
subsequent infractions would result
in an immediate loss of housing priv
ileges and would also jeopardize the
fraternity's future at Stanford, even
as an unhoused organization.
Stanford Police have ruled the in
cident an accident, and do not fore
see a further investigation.
The future of the fraternity and its
house
The Greek Judicial Board will
begin reviewing Phi Delt's charter
this quarter and deliver its decision
sometime winter quarter.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Mike Martinez said he has
faith in the Judicial Board's ability
to evaluate the situation appropri
ately. "The Greek Judicial Board
will come to a fair decision with the
best interest of the Stanford com
munity in mind," Martinez said.
The board can decide to either
permanently revoke the Phi Delt's
charter or suspend it for a specified
length of time.
If the fraternity were allowed to
keep its charter, Wais said, the Phi
Dclts could eventually re-apply for
campus housing at some point in
the future.
Starting next quarter, however,
the Phi Delt house will become a
draw-filled "self-op." Fraternity
members will be assigned to Uni
versity residences through the reg
ular draw system.
Phi Delt reaction
Phi Delt president Jackson Wa
goner said the fraternity's thoughts
about losing their house play a dis
tant second to their concern for
their friend.
"Right now our only concern is
for Mike and his health," said Phi
Delt president Jackson Wagener, a
junior.
"The house is of secondary con
cern. ()ur thoughts and prayers go
out to him and his family. I hope to
God that the University never sees
something like this again."
Wagener acknowledged that the
fraternity "violated the terms of
the sanctions" and emphasized the
importance of drawing a distinc
tion between the loss of the house
and the tragedy.
"It is one of those events that

forces everyone to take a step
back," he said.
Administrative reaction
At a Faculty Senate meeting yes
terday, President Casper reported
the incident with "deep sadness."
"I strongly endorse Dean Wais'
action," Casper said. " The University
will not tolerate such disregard when
lives are at stake."
Casper further emphasized that
the implications of the incident ex
tend beyond the Greek community.
"This is not a fraternity issue
only," Casper said. "Dean Wais and
Vice Provost [for Student Affairs
James) Montoya are going to work
with the leadership of the ASSU to
address problems with alcohol that
do exist."
During the discussions about the
fraternity and the consequences
members now face for violating sanc
tions, administrators said their fore
most concern was for Howard.
"I can't emphasize enough that
our primary focus is on the health
and well-being of the student," Wais
said. "One of the most difficult things
that I ever had to do in my personal or
professional life was to meet with the
family last night. It's been a difficult
and painful experience and one that I
don't want to ever have to repeat."
Despite the tragic nature of the sit
uation for Howard, his family, the fra
ternity and the community at large,
Montoya said that the University had
no choice in its actions.
"Unfortunately, we were no
longer able to justify allocating Uni
versity resources such as student
housing to a group of individuals who
collectively are unable to support the
educational goals of the University,"
Montoya said. "The reality is that this
incident brought to light the fact that
the fraternity violated one of the con
ditions of the sanctions."
ASSU reaction
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin said that the incident was
not a Phi Delt issue, but a campus
issue.
"It could have happened to any

one," Marroquin said. "It's a freak
occurance."
Still, Marroquin said, such inci
dents can be prevented.
"Stanford students drink, but the
reason why we don't have incidents
like this normally happen is because
Stanford students take care of each
other," explained Marroquin. "It
wouldn't have happened if there
were people with him."
He emphasized that students must
continue watching out for each other.
The responsibility for preventing
future incidents, ASSU President
Maren Norton pointed out, falls not
just on students but on University of
ficials and the community as a whole.
"I think that we need to make sure
people are educated about the conse
quences of the choice to either drink
or not drink and we need to take a
look at other alternatives to drink
ing," Norton said.
Norton and Marroquin are ex
ploring ways to provide alternatives
to drinking, including chartering
weekend shuttles to movie theaters.
Other Stanford fraternity incidents
Phi Delt is not the only fraternity
to be evicted from University housing
in recent years.
In May 1997, Wais de-housed the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity after
an intoxicated Deke pledge was hos
pitalized. The Greek Judicial Board
recommended less severe sanctions,
according to fraternity members, but
Wais overruled the board.
The Dekes were able to return to
their house this school year because
they met probation requirements.
In the past four years, four other
fraternities have lost their houses.
Delta Tau Delta was evicted for
money and discipline problems with
the University. Kappa Alpha. Theta
Xi, and Beta Theta Pi lost their hous
es due to low numbers.
The University has disciplined fra
ternities for lesser offenses as well.
Last fall, an unprovoked attack at
a Theta Delta Chi party injured one
student and led to the arrest of a Palo
Alto resident who snuck into the
party.

According to the police report, an
other fight broke out as the police
were removing the assailant. That
fight had to be broken up by a sher
iffs deputy on patrol in the area.
During 1996, the Sigma Chi frater
nity was placed on a three-month so
cial probation because of what Wais
called "lack of responsible planning
and on-site management" at a party
thrown during Orientation.
The sanctions against the Sigma
Chis, many fraternity members felt,
were harsher than similar ones insti
tuted before.
Fratcrnit\ incidents nationwide
Stanford is not the only University
that has faced alcohol-related prob
lems within its Greek community re
cently.
Earlier this week, a 20-year-old
Rutgers University student died from
head injuries sustained after falling
down a flight of concrete stairs in his
fraternity house Oct. 12.
The student. Jason Greco, a mem
ber of Rutgers' Theta Chi fraternity,
fell after returning from a local tavern
where he was served alcohol.
"What occurred was every par
ent's nightmare and every adminis
trator's nightmare," said Leslie
Fehrenbach, associate vice president
for administration and public safety
at Rutgers. "It was a very tragic, dev
astating event."
University officials at Rutgers
formed a committee charged with
changing "the culture of college
drinking" there. That committee will
report on its findings next month.
At Mi l' last fall, a freshman Phi
(lamina Delta pledge died from alco
hol poisoning. The fraternity, subse
quently indicted on one count of
manslaughter and one count of haz
ing, no longer exists.
Also, earlier this year, Louisiana
State University banned a fraternity
for a minimum of three years after a
sophomore died in another alcohol
related incident.
The fraternity pleaded "no con
test" to 86 criminal charges. The stu
dent's parents filed a civil wrongful
death suit against the fraternity.
After falling off a balcony at the
Phi Delta Theta house at approxi
mately 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,
21-year-old senior Michael Howard,
a member of the fraternity, remains
hospitalized and in serious condition
at Stanford Hospital.
A subsequent investigation re

members now face for violating sanc
tions, administrators said their fore
most concern was for Howard.
"I can't emphasize enough that
our primary focus is on the health
and well-being of the student," Wais
said. "One of the most difficult things
that I ever had to do in my personal or
professional life was to meet with the
family last night. It's been a difficult
and painful experience and one that I
don't want to ever have to repeat."
Despite the tragic nature of the sit
uation for Howard, his family, the fra
ternity and the community at large,
Montoya said that the University had
no choice in its actions.
"Unfortunately, we were no
longer able to justify allocating Uni
versity resources such as student
housing to a group of individuals who
collectively are unable to support the
educational goals of the University,"
Montoya said. "The reality is that this
incident brought to light the fact that
the fraternity violated one of the con
ditions of the sanctions."
ASSU reaction
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin said that the incident was
not a Phi Delt issue, but a campus
issue.
"It could have happened to any

one," Marroquin said. "It's a freak
occurance."
Still, Marroquin said, such inci
dents can be prevented.
"Stanford students drink, but the
reason why we don't have incidents
like this normally happen is because
Stanford students take care of each
other," explained Marroquin. "It
wouldn't have happened if there
were people with him."
He emphasized that students must
continue watching out for each other.
The responsibility for preventing
future incidents, ASSU President
Maren Norton pointed out, falls not
just on students but on University of
ficials and the community as a whole.
"I think that we need to make sure
people are educated about the conse
quences of the choice to either drink
or not drink and we need to take a
look at other alternatives to drink
ing," Norton said.
Norton and Marroquin are ex
ploring ways to provide alternatives
to drinking, including chartering
weekend shuttles to movie theaters.
Other Stanford fraternity incidents
Phi Delt is not the only fraternity
to be evicted from University housing
in recent years.
In May 1997, Wais de-housed the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity after
an intoxicated Deke pledge was hos
pitalized. The Greek Judicial Board
recommended less severe sanctions,
according to fraternity members, but
Wais overruled the board.
The Dekes were able to return to
their house this school year because
they met probation requirements.
In the past four years, four other
fraternities have lost their houses.
Delta Tau Delta was evicted for
money and discipline problems with
the University. Kappa Alpha. Theta
Xi, and Beta Theta Pi lost their hous
es due to low numbers.
The University has disciplined fra
ternities for lesser offenses as well.
Last fall, an unprovoked attack at
a Theta Delta Chi party injured one
student and led to the arrest of a Palo
Alto resident who snuck into the
party.

According to the police report, an
other fight broke out as the police
were removing the assailant. That
fight had to be broken up by a sher
iffs deputy on patrol in the area.
During 1996, the Sigma Chi frater
nity was placed on a three-month so
cial probation because of what Wais
called "lack of responsible planning
and on-site management" at a party
thrown during Orientation.
The sanctions against the Sigma
Chis, many fraternity members felt,
were harsher than similar ones insti
tuted before.
Fratcrnit\ incidents nationwide
Stanford is not the only University
that has faced alcohol-related prob
lems within its Greek community re
cently.
Earlier this week, a 20-year-old
Rutgers University student died from
head injuries sustained after falling
down a flight of concrete stairs in his
fraternity house Oct. 12.
The student. Jason Greco, a mem
ber of Rutgers' Theta Chi fraternity,
fell after returning from a local tavern
where he was served alcohol.
"What occurred was every par
ent's nightmare and every adminis
trator's nightmare," said Leslie
Fehrenbach, associate vice president
for administration and public safety
at Rutgers. "It was a very tragic, dev
astating event."
University officials at Rutgers
formed a committee charged with
changing "the culture of college
drinking" there. That committee will
report on its findings next month.
At Mi l' last fall, a freshman Phi
(lamina Delta pledge died from alco
hol poisoning. The fraternity, subse
quently indicted on one count of
manslaughter and one count of haz
ing, no longer exists.
Also, earlier this year, Louisiana
State University banned a fraternity
for a minimum of three years after a
sophomore died in another alcohol
related incident.
The fraternity pleaded "no con
test" to 86 criminal charges. The stu
dent's parents filed a civil wrongful
death suit against the fraternity.
After falling off a balcony at the
Phi Delta Theta house at approxi
mately 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,
21-year-old senior Michael Howard,
a member of the fraternity, remains
hospitalized and in serious condition
at Stanford Hospital.
A subsequent investigation re
vealed that the Phi Delts had violated
terms of their probation and, as a re
sult. will lose their house at the end of
fall quarter.
Last spring, a Phi Delt pledge was
seriously injured in an alcohol-relat
ed incident on a weekend retreat.
Dean of Students Marc Wais, after
receiving a recommendation from
the Greek Judicial Board, banned al
cohol at Phi Delt functions for one
year as part of the fraternity's proba
tion.
Howard's injury was also related
to alcohol consumption, according to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Howard, who had been drinking.

fell 20 feet from the balcony to the
concrete below and was not discov
ered until 8 a.m. the next day. At that
time, paramedics took him to the
Stanford Medical Center where he
underwent surgery and has remained
since.
Despite the severity of Howard's
injuries, members of the Greek Judi
cial Board stressed that the Phi Delts
lost their house because they violated
their probation and not because of
the tragedy.
"The event brought to light the
fact that the Phi Delts did not follow
the stipulations that had been laid out
for them," said Greek Judicial Board
co-chair Brian Pilko, a senior.
The probation stated that any
subsequent infractions would result
in an immediate loss of housing priv
ileges and would also jeopardize the
fraternity's future at Stanford, even
as an unhoused organization.
Stanford Police have ruled the in
cident an accident, and do not fore
see a further investigation.
The future of the fraternity and its
house
The Greek Judicial Board will
begin reviewing Phi Delt's charter
this quarter and deliver its decision
sometime winter quarter.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Mike Martinez said he has
faith in the Judicial Board's ability
to evaluate the situation appropri
ately. "The Greek Judicial Board
will come to a fair decision with the
best interest of the Stanford com
munity in mind," Martinez said.
The board can decide to either
permanently revoke the Phi Delt's
charter or suspend it for a specified
length of time.
If the fraternity were allowed to
keep its charter, Wais said, the Phi
Dclts could eventually re-apply for
campus housing at some point in
the future.
Starting next quarter, however,
the Phi Delt house will become a
draw-filled "self-op." Fraternity
members will be assigned to Uni
versity residences through the reg
ular draw system.
Phi Delt reaction
Phi Delt president Jackson Wa
goner said the fraternity's thoughts
about losing their house play a dis
tant second to their concern for
their friend.
"Right now our only concern is
for Mike and his health," said Phi
Delt president Jackson Wagener, a
junior.
"The house is of secondary con
cern. ()ur thoughts and prayers go
out to him and his family. I hope to
God that the University never sees
something like this again."
Wagener acknowledged that the
fraternity "violated the terms of
the sanctions" and emphasized the
importance of drawing a distinc
tion between the loss of the house
and the tragedy.
"It is one of those events that

forces everyone to take a step
back," he said.
Administrative reaction
At a Faculty Senate meeting yes
terday, President Casper reported
the incident with "deep sadness."
"I strongly endorse Dean Wais'
action," Casper said. " The University
will not tolerate such disregard when
lives are at stake."
Casper further emphasized that
the implications of the incident ex
tend beyond the Greek community.
"This is not a fraternity issue
only," Casper said. "Dean Wais and
Vice Provost [for Student Affairs
James) Montoya are going to work
with the leadership of the ASSU to
address problems with alcohol that
do exist."
During the discussions about the
fraternity and the consequences
members now face for violating sanc
tions, administrators said their fore
most concern was for Howard.
"I can't emphasize enough that
our primary focus is on the health
and well-being of the student," Wais
