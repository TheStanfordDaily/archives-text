After falling off a balcony at the
Phi Delta Theta house at approxi
mately 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,
21-year-old senior Michael Howard,
a member of the fraternity, remains
hospitalized and in serious condition
at Stanford Hospital.
A subsequent investigation re
vealed that the Phi Delts had violated
terms of their probation and, as a re
sult. will lose their house at the end of
fall quarter.
Last spring, a Phi Delt pledge was
seriously injured in an alcohol-relat
ed incident on a weekend retreat.
Dean of Students Marc Wais, after
receiving a recommendation from
the Greek Judicial Board, banned al
cohol at Phi Delt functions for one
year as part of the fraternity's proba
tion.
Howard's injury was also related
to alcohol consumption, according to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Howard, who had been drinking.

fell 20 feet from the balcony to the
concrete below and was not discov
ered until 8 a.m. the next day. At that
time, paramedics took him to the
Stanford Medical Center where he
underwent surgery and has remained
since.
Despite the severity of Howard's
injuries, members of the Greek Judi
cial Board stressed that the Phi Delts
lost their house because they violated
their probation and not because of
the tragedy.
"The event brought to light the
fact that the Phi Delts did not follow
the stipulations that had been laid out
for them," said Greek Judicial Board
co-chair Brian Pilko, a senior.
The probation stated that any
subsequent infractions would result
in an immediate loss of housing priv
ileges and would also jeopardize the
fraternity's future at Stanford, even
as an unhoused organization.
Stanford Police have ruled the in
cident an accident, and do not fore
see a further investigation.
