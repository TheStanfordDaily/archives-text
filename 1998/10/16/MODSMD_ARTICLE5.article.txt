# OSP looking into opening a Stanford-in-Beijing center

Students looking for foreign study
opportunities may have a new option
soon, as the Overseas Studies Pro
gram has been exploring the possibil
ity of implementing a program in
Beijing.
"We're pleased to announce that
we have had very productive conver
sations with the University of Bei
jing. While issues are by no means re
solved. we can tentatively say that a
program may begin in the near fu
ture." said Russell Berman, the pro
gram's director.
Berman anticipates positive stu
dent response to this new decision.

Rumors of this potential program
have already begun to stir the con
versations of many Stanford stu
dents.
"I've always been planning to go
to China myjunior year. I've actually
been thinking how I was going to go
without a Stanford program, but I
will definitely make use of this. I
think a lot of people will jump at this
opportunity." said Margaux Krem
petz, a freshman pre-medical student
and prospective East Asian Studies
minor, focusing in comparative med
icine.
With the overwhelming respons
es to the program, it does appear that
many will indeed "jump" at this

chance, and for others, they wish
they had had the opportunity to
"jump" earlier.
"This is such a wonderful idea.
I've been waiting for this," said Kelly
Price, a senior majoring in Human
Biology and hoping to earn a mas
ter's in East Asian Studies.
Already, Price has studied in
mainland China and Taiwan
through another university's pro
gram, and recently returned from
Stanford's Kyoto campus. "China is
going through so many political and
economic changes, and this gives
people a chance to see China in their
stage of development. Just really liv
ing in the culture has been awe

some.
"There are so many Asian stu
dents and such a large East Asian
studies niche that it's nice to finally
have a something that might be able
to cater to that group." said sopho
more Joy Hsu.
Students have been waiting a long
time for a study program in Beijing,
but even coming to this stage has not
been an easy task.
"One of my apprehensions had to
do with the extent that we would be
able to have a hand in choosing the
courses. The Chinese host continued
to have a hold on the course curricu

luin and we found it unacceptable for
academic rVasons," Berman said.
Berman added that "we have the
best students around the world here
at Stanford â€” students that expect
the best in courses, technology, cur
riculum, etc. China was not like that
four to five years ago."
With advancements rapidly
streaming in, new industries begin
ning to form and a developing youth
culture, China's changes have
brought a new sense of vitality to a
country that has continually grap
pled with economic troubles and
human rights issues.
Human rights issues have been of
concern for a few students, but
Berman assured that "the focus of
interest is the home campus. This
program is for academic reasons. It is
not a political judgment."
" There will be vigorous interac

lion between the U.S. and China.
Students need to understand China
better, and this is an expression of
the OSP's interest to provide stu
dents with important learning op
portunities."
This new program ean kxik for
ward to classes that are similar to
other study-abroad curricula.
Herman is hoping to offer Chinese
society and culture courses along
with humanities and social sciences.
And much like the other pro
grams, prior study of the Chinese
language is required. With the in
crease in students taking Chinese in
recent years, the Beijing program
looks to be a destination that many
students are hoping to approach. Ju
nior John Pettus isn't surprised by
the growing numbers.
"China is one of the most inter
esting countries to study," he said.
"It has the most incredible possibili
ties. There is so much going on there
and so little is known about it here in
the west."
