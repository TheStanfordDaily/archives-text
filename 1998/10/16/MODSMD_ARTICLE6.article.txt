For the first time at Stanford, black students and fac
ulty will "refrain from class, work and play" today with a
day of atonement, commemorating the third anniver
sary of the Million Man March.
This all-day event, which includes speeches, forums
and workshops, was spearheaded nationally by the Na
tion of Islam and organized on campus by the Black Stu
dent ' 'ni< . The event is supported by several black stu
lent orj li/ations, such as the Black (iraduate Student
Association and the newly-formed Stanford chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement ol Col
ored People.
The Million Man March, which took place on Oct. 16.
1995 in Washington D.C., was "a day where, not just
men, but all black people, regardless of religious or po
litical beliefs, reflected on their lives and saw how they
could bear themselves in their community in order to
strengthen the community." said BSU Co-chair Damien
Schnyder.
Brian Rikuda. BSU co-chair, explained that the pur
pose of a day of atonement is for "an individual or com
munity to recognize past shortcomings and flaws with
the end goal of redirecting oneself on to a more progres
sive pathway.
"For most of the 24 hours of any given day. our lives
are either focused on our Stanford curriculum, or the re
lease ol stress from that curriculum." Rikuda said. " The
day of atonement is one day where we take an entire day
to ... reflect on the status and direction of our commu
nity. In an ideal setting, we would be able to dedicate
time out of every day to focus on these issues."
Similar events have been taking place on college cam
puses across the country since the first National Day of
