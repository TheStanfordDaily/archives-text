# BSU holds day of atonement
## 
### Hasan McGee 
For the first time at Stanford, black students and fac
ulty will "refrain from class, work and play" today with a
day of atonement, commemorating the third anniver
sary of the Million Man March.
This all-day event, which includes speeches, forums
and workshops, was spearheaded nationally by the Na
tion of Islam and organized on campus by the Black Stu
dent ' 'ni< . The event is supported by several black stu
lent orj li/ations, such as the Black (iraduate Student
Association and the newly-formed Stanford chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement ol Col
ored People.
The Million Man March, which took place on Oct. 16.
1995 in Washington D.C., was "a day where, not just
men, but all black people, regardless of religious or po
litical beliefs, reflected on their lives and saw how they
could bear themselves in their community in order to
strengthen the community." said BSU Co-chair Damien
Schnyder.
Brian Rikuda. BSU co-chair, explained that the pur
pose of a day of atonement is for "an individual or com
munity to recognize past shortcomings and flaws with
the end goal of redirecting oneself on to a more progres
sive pathway.
"For most of the 24 hours of any given day. our lives
are either focused on our Stanford curriculum, or the re
lease ol stress from that curriculum." Rikuda said. " The
day of atonement is one day where we take an entire day
to ... reflect on the status and direction of our commu
nity. In an ideal setting, we would be able to dedicate
time out of every day to focus on these issues."
Similar events have been taking place on college cam
puses across the country since the first National Day of
Atonement was held in 1996, one
year after the Million Man March.
Efforts were first made to hold a
day of atonement at Stanford
when, according to Schnyder, Stan
ford students attended such days at
other campuses and came back
with requests that "we put on simi
lar programs so that we can
strengthen [the black] community
here."
On-campus activities begin at 9
a.m. with an opening in White
Plaza, The opening, according to
Rikuda, will give organizers a
chance to see how many people are
in attendance and plan accordingly.
Rikuda said the number of stu
dents who will participate is very
hard to judge and organizers are
not shooting for high attendance.
He also accepts that many stu
dents will be unable to attend. "We
recognize that it's midterm time,
and we don't recommend that peo
ple miss class if it's integral to their
education," he said.
He was also quick to point out
that the event is not a walk-out. Its
purpose, he said, is not to protest,
cause a disturbance or get a reac
tion, but rather for the black com
munity to rest and reflect.
" The action of refraining from
classes and work," Rikuda said, "is
not directed at publicizing anything
or saying anything against the Uni
versity."
Freshman Shannon Ashford, a
new member of the BSU who plans
to participate in today's activities,
compared the event to the Jewish
day of atonement, Yom Kippur,
during which Jewish people take a
day off to confess their sins and
seek forgiveness, clearing the way
for the future.
She plans on going to class but
still attending most of today's
events.
"I hope it will be very informa
tive and help break down barriers
so that we can be more unified in

our approach to racial issues at
Stanford," she said.
The opening will be followed at
10 a.m. by separate forums for
black men and women, where
hopefully. Rikuda said, "issues per
taining to each gender's present
status and roles within the black
community" will be addressed.
The men's forum will be held in
the Mirrielees fourth floor lounge,
while the women's forum will be
held in the Casa Zapata lounge.
Moderators will include Student
Affairs Officer Thomas Massey,
Education Prof. John Baugh and
Director of Multicultural Develop
ment Sally Dickson.
After a "black eating time" in
Stern Dining Hall-South, a commu
nity building workshop will be held
from 1:30 to 3 p.m. at Wilbur Field.
Having already addressed issues
that affect the respective genders,
speakers will address issues that im
pact the black community as a
whole. Rikuda said that this work
shop will "analyze the present sta
tus of our community and our vi
sion for it in the future."
From 3:15 to 4:30 p.m., Casa Za
pata's lounge will host two work
shops, one on black entrepreneur
ship and the other on bridging the
gap between various subgroups
within the black community, such
as native Africans. African Ameri
cans and those of African heritage
from the Caribbean.
Schnyder said he does not ex
pect a negative reaction from stu
dents. He hopes that non-black stu
dents understand that the event is
actually a reflection for all people,
but organizers have chosen to focus
on the black community because
they feel that "in order to go forth
in the general community, we must
first build up our own black com
munity."
Dean of Students Marc Wais is
sued a statement in which he said,
"I am not advocating that students
miss class, however, I am under
standing and respectful that this is a
personal choice to participate in
this event."
