This is a weekly advertisement (generally on Mondays) to let you know of the most current events and listings relat

groups, and Stanford staff. If you would like your group to publicize a public service opportunity, call us at
723-0992 or visit the Bing Information and Resource Center (BIRC) located on the first floor of the Haas Center
to find out how you can do so.
