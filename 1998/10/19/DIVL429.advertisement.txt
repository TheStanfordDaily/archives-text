DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T JUST KILL DRUNK DRIVERS.
Nicholas Esposito, killed Oct. 13, 1989 at 8:25 pm.
Next time your friend insists on driving drunk, do whatever it takes to stop him.
Because if he kills innocent people, how will you live with yourself?

MEDICAL VISIT
specialize in the care of
students like you, and are
dedicated to helping you
enhance your health. We believe
that a team approach and a
shared treatment and prevention
strategy work best. Here are
some tips:
Before the Visit
■ Think through why you want
to see a practitioner, and ask
yourself:
■ What are my goals for the
visit?
■ Can I call ahead to schedule
an appointment?
■ Find the most appropriate
person for your condition
(our advice nurse can help:
call 4-CARE (724-2273) and
press 4)
■ We need complete infor
mation to make an accurate
diagnosis, so be prepared to
answer these questions:
■ What are all of your
symptoms?
■ I low long have you had
them?
■ Have you had them before?
■ What have you already
tried that has worked? That
hasn't?
Note: Consider writing down
your answers and bringing them
with you
■ Write down your questions in
advance, and prioritize them
TT
Hi
Hopefully you won't feel like this
patient when you come to Cowell
(Stanford Hospital about 1930).
■ Identify your expectations
ahead, and make them clear
to us (examples follow):
■ Do you want antibiotics, or
other specific medications?
■ IX) you have certain tests in
mind?
■ If you have a number of
concerns, do you expect them
all to be addressed in one brief
appoint-ment? (some issues
take longer to discuss)
■ Bring any medications
you're currently taking with
you, including traditional
and alternative therapies
and non-prescription drugs
During the Visit
Sometimes we may want to
explore personal issues such as:
■ What stresses you out?
■ What you are really worried
about?
■ Do you have any previous
health problems?
■ What is your family's health
history?
■ What are your habits related to
sex, drugs, alcohol and tobacco?
Note: At Cowell, your medical
information is kept strictly
confidential (it's our practice,
and it's the law)
■ It's common to have some
anxiety when seeing a medical
practitioner - we anticipate
and understand this
■ Be open even if you haven't
been taking your medication
as prescribed, you're using
someone else's medicine, or
you've done something you
think we may not approve of
(we can help you better if you
tell us the whole history)
■ Once you find a practitioner
you like, try to stick with him
or her - you'll get better care,
and the practitioner will enjoy
getting to know you (you can
always change without giving
a reason)
Ending the Visit
■ Ask us to repeat anything you
don't understand
■ Be sure you know what you
are being asked to do
■ Check your list to be sure we
have covered the important
points
■ Know who to call in case you
have questions after you leave
The health and well-being of
students is our top priority. Call
if you need our help. Q
