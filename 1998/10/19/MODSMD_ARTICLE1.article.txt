# Waterfall
## Dorm flooded in accident 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Gavilan's theme for the 1998-99 school year is
''Uncharted Waters.' The all-freshman dorm quite
literally sailed off intv > those very same waters when a
Saturday night game of hallway soccer sheared the
head off a fire sprinkler and resulted in a flood that
forced the evacuation of Gavilan's second floor.
The resident fellow for West Florence Moore Hall
Ed Frueh. whose apartment is located on the first
floor of Gavilan, said that he believed the sprinkler
head was broken between 9:05 p.m. and 9:10 p.m. on
Saturday night. The fire alarm was activated when the
sprinkler was broken.
"The soccer ball hit the sprinkler and sheared off
the sprinkler head." said Andrew Rosen, a Gavilan
resident. "There was a waterfall and the hallways
Started to fill up with water."
Gavilan resident Benjamin Koh summed up the
incident in perhaps the most succinct manner, "Ball 1,
Sprinkler 0."
As a result of the flood, the second floor carpet was
saturated and second floor residents were evacuated
from their rooms. To dry the carpet, fans were set up
along the second floor hallway and the second floor
carpet was torn up.
Another Gavilan resident, Michael Deßaca, said
that Gavilan residents displaced by the flood were of
fered rooms in Governor's Corner for the night.
Displaced residents were allowed to move back
into their rooms late Sunday night.
Michael Gottfried, a resident of the second floor,
explained his experience with the flood.
"Returning from dinner I walked in and about 20
firemen were sweeping water off the carpet on the
second floor. The first fireman I saw looked at me and
said, 'Party's over.' I said that 1
needed to go into my room. 1
walked in and 1 stepped on the car
pet and the water rose up over the
soles of my boots."
Becky Chaplin had a similar ex
perience. "1 got back from a con
cert and 1 saw a fire truck pumping
water with a hose, the carpet was
pulled up. and firemen were
sweeping water out from under the
carpet."
As a result of the flooding there
were concerns about electrical fail
ure. Deßaca said, "We had a meet
ing in the Loro lounge and the head
of Housing and the Residence
Dean told us that there was electri
cal danger because the water had
come in contact with some of the
wiring and that they had to get a
safety clearance before allowing us
back in."
Frueh said, "There is no electri
cal danger. We were worried about

it but it didn't materialize."
Frueh had no information on
the dollar amount of the damage
done. He confirmed that water had
leaked from the second floor and
through the first floor ceiling.
Frueh's apartment, located on
Gavilan's first floor, suffered only
minor damage.
In order to allow water to drain
from the second floor, holes were
drilled into the first floor ceiling,
said Seers and Frueh.
In Gavilan's first-floor lounge
area, next to the RF apartment,
several ceiling panels had been re
moved and brown water stains
were visible on the ceiling.
The lounge area carpet had not
been torn up, but two fans were
running.
Much as the admissions com
mittee hoped, freshmen in Gavilan
took their journey into uncharted
flood waters with high spirits.
"It was a big party," Deßaca
said. "It was a bonding experience
for the smallest all-freshman dorm
on campus."
