## China-Taiwan talks end amiably 
### 
BEIJING (AP) With pointed
talk about democracy, rivals China
and Taiwan on Sunday wrapped up
talks that failed to bridge wide dif
ferences but ended a hostile freeze
in relations.
Taiwan's chief envoy to China.
Koo Chen-fu. capped his path
breaking five-day visit by urging
President Jiang Zemin to follow
Taiwan's example as a democracy.
Koo said he spoke of democracy
only in general terms with Jiang,
and said he recognized Taiwan's
version may not be a perfect fit. but
"if the Chinese mainland wishes to
promote its economic development
in the future, it has to take a brave
stride forward on the path to

democratization."'
Taiwan's 81-year-old negotiator
said that the atmosphere was com
fortable, calling Jiang "an old
friend." Koo told reporters that
"not a single person was angry."'
The talk was more blunt in Koo's
first appointment Sunday, with Vice
Premier Qian Oichen, the commu
nist government's leading strategist
on the island. Both sides- political
heirs to the combatants in the Chi
nese civil war — reiterated long
held positions that have prevented
reconciliation in the past.
Koo argued that Taiwan is a
sovereign state and will accept no
lesser status. He said reunification
has to wait until China becomes a

democracy.
Qian said Taiwan belongs to
C hina. But he said the island could
keep its capitalist system after
reunification.
China and Taiwan split into rival
governments after Mao Tse-tung's
Communists sent Chiang Kai
shek's Nationalists fleeing from the
mainland in 1949.
The two sides have rarely dealt
face-to-face since then. Talks began
in 1993 between Koo and Wang
Daoluin, an ex-mayor of Shanghai
and mentor to Chinese President
Jiang. But Beijing scrubbed talks
two years later, angry over per
ceived Taiwanese moves toward
independence.
