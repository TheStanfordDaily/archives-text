## Majority Editorial Dehousing justified 
### 
Judicial Board's recom
mendation was warranted
due to sanction violation

THE GREEK JUDICIAL Board's
recommendation to dehouse Phi
Delta Thcta was justified on the
basis that the Phi Delts clearly violated the
stipulations of their probation. Given the
severe consequences of a drinking spree,
the media coverage that soon followed
and. most important, the clear violations of
established rules, the University had no
other choice.
Even the president of the fraternity
does not contest that the events that
occurred on Saturday night violated the
terms of the sanctions. Those sanctions,
imposed on Phi Delta Theta last spring,
said that the fraternity could not organize a
house "event" where alcohol was served.
According to the definition in the sanc
tions, the Phi Delts who stopped by
Michael Howard's room that night were
members ol such an "event." While the Phi
Delts did not intentionally defy the rules,
they were given adequate warning to avoid
such a situation.
At the same time, it is difficult to swal
low the University's drastic response, even
though it originated from a literal interpre

tation of the probation agreement. The
University's response might have been dif
ferent had there been only three people in
Howard's room at one time. The rules stip
ulated that any gathering of five or more
people in the presence of alcohol constitut
ed a violation of the sanctions. Regardless
of the number of people present, the result
could have been the same—a Stanford
student lying in the hospital.
The University may have caught the Phi
Delts on a technicality, hut the sanctions
were not intended merely to prevent par
ties. Clearly, the sanctions were intended to
protect and monitor the lives and health of
the Stanford community by limiting high
risk situations. If the University had intend
ed to put an end to all Phi Delt social
events, as many opposed to the dehousing
decision claim, it would have moved to
dehouse the fraternity after last spring's
incident. This did not take place, however,
and only recently Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya said that the Uni
versity could no longer house a group that
"collectively was unable it) support the edu
cational goals of the I Jniversity."
Dehousing the Phi Delts was an easy
decision because the University holds
(ireek organizations to a standard of col
lective responsibility and the fraternity was
already under probation. Hut Stanford stu
dents drink in residences outside of Greek
housing. There is no clear University pro
cedure to address the consequences had
the accident occurred in a dormitory or
Row house. In that case, no entity could be
held accountable, and there would be no
swift and simple solution.
It is critical that the University clearly
indicate its position on student drinking in
both Greek and residential life. The issue
reaches beyond Stanford's campus; this
weekend, a University of Michigan stu
dent died in another alcohol-related inci
dent. Evidently, what happened at Phi
Delt could easily happen in any residence
at any university.
