## Sanction terms unjust

Zero-tolerance policies risk
punishing organizations for
crimes they did not commit

I CAN'T SAY the decision to take
away Phi Delta Theta's house was
unjustified. Twice in the past six
months liquor-related incidents involving
Phi Delt have put a student in hospital.
It may he that Phi Delt had an alcohol
based culture that contributed greatly to
both incidents. Perhaps that atmosphere
wasn't going to go away, and more such
incidents were just waiting to happen. If
so. Dean of Students Marc Wais was
entirely justified in evicting Phi Delt,
which he did with the unanimous support
of the Greek Judicial Board.
However, according to Wais' state
ment. the housing decision wasn't a direct
result of Michael Howard's tragic acci
dent. The decision was based on a proba
tion violation. After an incident in the
spring in which a student ended up in the
hospital after an alcohol-related fight. Phi
Delt had several sanctions imposed on it.
One of these prohibited any events at
which liquor was served.
After Friday's accident, an investiga
tion found that about seven people had
been together in Howard's room, and that
liquor was being served. By the definition
set out in the sanctions, that was an

"event."and therefore violated the proba
tion, thus evoking the "zero-tolerance"
part of the sanction, which stated that any
violation resulted in automatic expulsion.
T his specific incident clearly contribut
ed in some way to ;i very tragic event, but
even without the tragic circumstances, the
incident would have set off the "zero-tol
erance" clause.
This is not to say that the Phi Pelts
shouldn't have lost their house. If in fact
they did nothing to change the circum
stances that led to the incident in the
spring, they should have lost it.
However, one can forsee a circum
stance in which, in spite of meaningful and
effective efforts to change the culture of a
house, one incident involving a few mem
bers could negate a lot of sincere effort on
the part of the rest of the fraternity.
The problem with "zero-tolerance"
policies is that they make actual justice in
any given case less important than obedi
ence to some previously determined stan
dard. which isn't always relevant to the
circumstances under which it's invoked.
Quite probably, the "zero-tolerance"
sanction didn't cause an injustice in this
case, and the punishment was probably
appropriate. However, the reasons given
for the punishment were not in themselves
adequate, and if the University continues
to employ such sanctions and enforce
them as it has. then injustice will result.
