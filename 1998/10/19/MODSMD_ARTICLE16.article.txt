## Find your 'dealability quotient' 
### 
ARE YOU familiar
with the formula
for gross domestic
product, the economic indi
cator for a country? Come
on, Econ 1 students, say it
with me now: Consump
tion + investments + gov-

ernment spending + net exports = GDP. I've
created my own gross domestic product, a
mathematical formula to indicate quantita
tively how well I'm doing, not per economic
stability, but social and mental health. I'm
labeling it my dealability quotient, d.q. for
short. It is defined as such: the sum of dis
turbing behaviors resulting from too much
work and too little time which tend to short
change areas like nutrition, academics, socia
bility and personal hygiene, normalized by
the degree of stress experienced in that time
period.
Get out a pencil and give it a try! Select a
day (perhaps yesterday), begin with 10
points and subtract one for each disturbing
act. You might, for example, sum up the
number 0f...
—Meals eaten standing up or riding a bike
—Days since your last shower
Days your current outfit has been worn
and slept in
—Hours spent in Sweet I iall or the Lair after
12:fX) am
—Condiments counted as vegetable servings
—Bagels or Power Bars eaten
—Times you responded "Fine" to "What's

up?" or "Nothing" to "How are you?
—Acquaintances dodged
—Days it has been since you had a conversa
tion with someone (No, "Hi does not count
as a conversation and neither does anything
related to "Where do you live?" "What class
es are you taking this quarter?" "How was
your summer?" or "I have so much work to
do.")
—Papers turned in considering spellcheck a
comprehensive edit
—Times you drove to class from an on-cam
pus location
—Times you drove to the Tressidder fish
bowl to "work out"
—(for co-opers) Times you left a bottle con
taining less than two swallows of milk in the
fridge because you didn't want to spend two
minutes washing it or brought a dish back to
your room because the Hobart was full and
you couldn't handle emptying it
You've got your sum, right? Today mine
was a six. Ten minus six leaves me with four.
For students taking the math class with the H
attached to it, you can increase the accuracy
of this formula by adding points for behav
iors that are good and right, like calling mom,
taking a nap, going out to eat and playing
tennis. Adding four to my previous score
gives me an eight.
Then rank the degree of stress you expe
rienced in that period on a scale of one to 10.
For me let's say it was a six. Divide your sum
by this estimate. That gives me a d.q. of one
and one-third. Not too bad, but far from

excellent.
Stanford students aren't the kicked-back-
California-sunshine-devil-may-care social
shiners we like to think of ourselves as. Often
we race frantically from one commitment to
the next. We get swept up in a mad flurry of
books, papers, problem sets, athletes, vegans
and musicians. We start running from
Naranja to Netscape, Meyer to MEChA, and
Roble to resume workshops like chickens
with our heads cut off. It has to stop, just like
the pushing and shoving at Hum Bio section
sign ups has to stop.
Now break your pencil in two and throw
it in the trash. This is the kind of math you
can do in your head and without the formu
la. D.q. is about taking yourself a little less
seriously, maintaining a sense of balance and
perspective in the larger scheme of things.
When your bike maims a squirrel and you
leave it lying on its back, legs kicking, chest
heaving, tail twitching, because, shoot, you're
already late for your meeting (although I'm
not sure what the realistic options are — go
back and bash its skull in? Hide it in the
bushes? Take it to Stanford Hospital? 1 think
I'll just ask for a moment of respectful
silence), you need to take it down a notch.
I've realized that lifestyle changes take more
than picking a few more daisies or wearing
purple more often.

Hours spent trying to figure out the point of
this column have left Rachel Hutton, a senior
majoring in product design, d.q.-negative.
