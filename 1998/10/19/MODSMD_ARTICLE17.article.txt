Ticket line shames Stanford
1 never thought that I would be as
ashamed of Stanford students as group as I
was Friday night. The lists of who was going
to get what basketball tickets had been sent
in days ago. so everyone in the line to pick
them up knew that it really didn't matter
who got to the front of the line first.
My dorm went down there as a group
about an hour early so we were there
around 6:30 p.m. when they handed out the
information sheets all the way to the back
of the line, which was very far by that point.
There were plenty of information sheets to
go around and everyone who was there in
line got one.
As it got closer to 7 p.m., though, many
people and groups tried to barge their way
into the front of the line from the sides.
When they opened the windows shortly
after 7 p.m., people starting shoving and
cutting. After only a few minutes, it became
clear that many of the people at the "front"
of the line didn't have information sheets.
One of the organi/ers came out and asked
who needed information sheets and all the
cutters were identified. More than half of
the people in front of me. at least 20 or 30
people just within my line of sight, didn't
have the sheets and had to fill them out
right there in front of me. Those people cut
into the front of the long line even though

they knew that the people behind them had
been there for much longer.
1 wouldn't expect that kind of behavior
from high school or even elementary school
kids, and I am very disappointed and
ashamed to see it from my fellow Stanford
students.

Weighing D'Souza's merits
In the spirit of the word "merit" which
figured so prominently in Dinesh
D'Souza's well-rehearsed indictment of
affirmative action on Oct. 14,1 offer the fol
lowing account of the speech's merits and
demerits. The demerits in the end carried
the day.
On the meritorious side of the ledger.
D'Souza pointed to the anemic definition
of diversity employed by many affirmative
action proponents. When Bill Clinton
vowed to make his Cabinet look like Amer
ica. D'Souza observed, he didn't really look
much beyond looks — that is. the race, eth
nicity and gender-based triumvirate for
gauging diversity.
While such "cosmetic diversity." to bor
row D'Souza's phrase, might satisfy ethnic,
racial and gender-conscious bean counters,
it ignores the many other axes of

diversity — class, religion, region, and ide
ology, to name just a few. D'Souza also
rightly took issue with those who cry cul
tural bias when it comes to explaining
group differentials in standardized test
scores. Surely cultural bias, he maintained,
cannot explain why SAT math results con
sistently reveal that poor whites outper
form well-to-do blacks.
On the demeritorious side of the ledger,
D'Souza's case against affirmative action
suffers from missing links in the logical
chain and a flawed, dubiously selective,
reading of the historical record. D'Souza
said that the precipitous drop in black
matriculation at UC-Berkeley in the wake
of Prop. 2(W is "acceptable in the short run
but not in the long run."
How one gets from here to there, how
ever. without affirmative action remains a
profound mystery.
D'Souza draped himself in the legacy of
Martin Luther King, Jr. True, King did
have a dream about a world where people
judged each other by the content of their
characters, not the color of their skin. How
ever, what D'Souza neglected to mention
(apparently it must not merit it), is that
King recognizing the need for color con
scious meant realizing colorblind dreams.
In 1%4, in "Why Can't We Wait," King
articulated the underlying premise for affir
