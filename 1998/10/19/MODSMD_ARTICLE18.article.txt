# Where we are
## Crime laws trespass on our right to think 
### 
David Stein

NO ONE NEED look any further
than Matthew Shepard's murder
last week to know that hatred
remains one of the foremost obstacles in
reaching a unified and peaceful society. It is
a corrosive and ultimately cancerous emo
tion that not only destroys the individual
victim — in this case, a young, ambitious
college student not too different from any
one of us — but also violates an entire sec
tion of the population that the individual, by
no effort of his own, has come to represent.
In the aftermath of the Wyoming
tragedy, mourning has been replaced by an
angry wail for retribution which, in this
country, takes the hopeful form of new leg
islation. Hate crimes can be stopped, popu
lar logic contends, by simply creating laws
that call for harsher enforcement and
increased penalties for offenders. While
hate-crime laws are an admirable way of
achieving an important goal — a diverse
society built on mutual respect — they are
nonetheless misguided and impractical in
their current form.
There's no denying that most victims of
hate crimes, who are also members of cer
tain minority groups, still unfortunately
need extra protection in our society. Like
anti-discrimination laws and even affirma
tive action measures, hate-crime laws don't
seek to give minorities an advantage over

the rest of us but merely grant them the
same rights that non-minorities have always
enjoyed. By announcing that those who
intentionally go after minorities will receive
more severe punishments, we aim to
advance the legitimate social goal of making
our country honor its pledge of universal
fairness.
It must also be noted that hate-crime
laws are more than just social equalizers;
just about any form of hate that divides is
intolerable For example, while minorities
comprise the majority of hate-crime victims,
crimes against whites occurred more often
than crimes against homosexuals, according
to the most recent FBI Hate Crime Statis
tics. In fact, the number of incidents report
ed against people like myself— a white Jew
— was about the same number reported
against homosexuals, Asians and Hispanics
combined. So, for those who claim that hate
crime laws are designed merely to protect
limited political interests, it's a good idea to
look at all the facts before drawing false
conclusions.
Additionally, hate-crime laws put into
explicit terms what any sensible and intelli
gent human being already knows: that
despite differences in race, religion or sexu
al orientation, all people should be afforded
their inherent freedoms. This explicitness is
unfortunately necessary because there are

certain groups in this country, namely right
wing Republicans and anti-Christian Chris
tians headed up by the likes of Rev. Jerry
Falwell, who still believe that homosexuali
ty is a sin and consequently that not all men
are truly created equal. It is perhaps for
these unenlightened groups alone that hate
crime laws are useful.
Nevertheless, hate-crime laws are not the
ideal means for achieving their all too wor
thy ends. The laws currently on the books
are too vague and non-inclusive, and they
violate the most basic of American princi
ples: They tell us what we can and can't
think.
First of all. while these laws try to protect
all groups from hate-related crimes, in real
ity, they only shield acknowledged cate
gories (i.e., race, religion and sexual orienta
tion) from persecution. For example, if I
were to hit a homosexual or a Japanese man
and call him "Oueer" or "Jap." I could be
prosecuted for a hate crime. However, if 1
were to smack a skinhead and call him a
Nazi, I would be free from any penalty
(aside from assault, of course).
Both exchanges would be (hvpothetical
ly) characterized by the same disdain, the
same lack of respect for the other's dignity,
and yet only the former would be criminal
in nature. While a skinhead might not exact
ly be a model citizen, does he not have the

same right, as long as he too acts lawfully, to
be lree from name-calling and intimidation?
If our intention remains to create an equal
society free from preferential treatment,
then the distinction between a protected
class and a non-protected class undermines
that goal.
Ironically, a group that is not protected
under all current hate crime laws is women.
As historically discriminated against as most
other minorities, women seem to be ideal
candidates for shelter under federal law.
However, since they are not, is the law sug
gesting that crimes against women, most
notably rape, are not driven by destructive
feelings of hate? In fact, there are few
crimes more offensive to our sensibilities
and ideas of liberty than rape, and yet, there
is no special provision for this felony under
current statutes.
There seems to be an easy solution to all
this ambiguity and discrepancy in the laws:
Defend all groups from hate. Everyone
would then be secure and no one would be
left out. However, even with this beneficent
move, the true problem with hate crime
laws remains.
Whether we or anyone else likes it —
and I definitely do not — hatred is not ille
gal. It is an emotion and a frame of mind,
and even if it is invoked to belittle and
destroy, hatred is nonetheless protected

under our freedom of speech and thought.
We might hate hate and what it can do, but
we can't outlaw a feeling. Despite its gen
uine ugliness, it is inherently no different
than other character flaws. In fact, if we
want to prosecute people for their hatred,
then it would be equally reasonable to crim
inalize greed and envy as they often perpet
uate acts of significant depravity.
It is unnecessary to assign the title of
"hate crime" to such offenses as Matthew
Shepard's killing. The criminal code has
already ensured that violent crimes will be
dealt with in the most severe way. Shepard's
killers will probably remain in jail for the
rest of their lives. But they will do so
because they committed a hateful act. not a
hateful thought. A murder, by its very
nature, is despicable, and to give it added
weight seems to be merely for expedient
political reasons.
A law will not change the hatred in a
dark heart nor end its dark yield; only the
patient re-education of the soul will achieve
that objective.
Such a process is not easy, but we must
remember that nothing important ever is.

as well as hate, could he a mediating factor
