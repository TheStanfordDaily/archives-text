was swept during its road trip against
the Los Angeles schools.

After suffering its first home loss
of the season against the then-No. 9
Brigham Young Cougars on Oct. 5.
the Cardinal lost its opening Pac-10
game to the Arizona State Sun Dev
ils. An 8-1 rout of the University of
Arizona Wildcats last Sunday
reestablished the confidence and
momentum of the Stanford squad.
Stanford looked to Friday's game
against the unranked USC Trojans
(7-6-1, 1-2) and yesterday's game
against No. 14 UCLA (13-2-1) to es
tablish a winning record in the all
important Pac-10 competition.
