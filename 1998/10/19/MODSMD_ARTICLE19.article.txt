soccer team (7-4-2. 1-3 Pacific 10
Conference) continued to falter as it
was swept during its road trip against
the Los Angeles schools.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Yesterday: No. 14 UCLA (13-2-1.
3-1 Pacific 10 Conference) 2. No. 25
Stanford (7-4-2,1-3) 1.
■ Frida\: IJS( (7-6-1.1-2) Stanford 1.

After suffering its first home loss
of the season against the then-No. 9
Brigham Young Cougars on Oct. 5.
the Cardinal lost its opening Pac-10
game to the Arizona State Sun Dev
ils. An 8-1 rout of the University of
Arizona Wildcats last Sunday
reestablished the confidence and
momentum of the Stanford squad.
Stanford looked to Friday's game
against the unranked USC Trojans
(7-6-1, 1-2) and yesterday's game
against No. 14 UCLA (13-2-1) to es
tablish a winning record in the all
important Pac-10 competition.
The Cardinal dropped both
games in two very competitive en
counters.
(JSC sophomore forward Megan
Orach chose an opportune time to
score her first goal of the season.
Orach scored the game-clinching
goal in the 74th minute of play to lead
USC to a 2-1 victory over Stanford.
Stanford scored early when se
nior midfielder Tracye Lawyer capi
talized on USC's mistakes. When a
Trojan defender's header failed to
clear the ball safely out of the box,
Lawyer scored from 15 yards out 20
minutes into the game.
Thirteen minutes later, USC's
free kick opportunity set up the Tro
jans' first goal of the game. Sopho
more midfielder Andrea Warner
scored USC's first goal in the 33rd
minute of play off of the free kick
from teammate Christina Kushnir.
Both teams remained scoreless
until Orach's game-winning goal in
the 74th minute of play.
After a one-day hiatus, the Cardi
nal hoped to bounce back against a
vulnerable Bruin squad.
After California ended UCLA's
11 game unbeaten streak on Friday
in a double-overtime game, the Bru
ins entered yesterday's match-up
with the Cardinal eager to establish a
new winning streak.
Despite outshooting the Bruins

12-8 in the second half and having
five corner kick opportunities as op
posed to UCLA's three, the Cardinal
came up on the short end of a 2-1 de
cision.
Sophomore forward Tracey Mil
burn and freshman midfielder Bre
ana Boling dominated the efforts of
the UCLA offense. The duo com
bined for eight of the Bruins' 15 shots
and both of the team's goals.
Milburn recorded the first UCLA
goal in the 26th minute of play. The
sophomore has distinguished herself
in the Bruin roster by notching at
least one point in each of her last five
games.
Securing their lead in the final
moments of play, the Bruins record
ed their second goal in the 88th
minute when freshman midfielder
Breana Boling scored off an assist
from senior forward Larisa Kiremid
jan.
Stanford struck back when fresh
men forward Erin Maurer scored off
of an assist from Lawyer. Maurer has
had a goal in each of her last two
games.
The Bruins and the Cardinal had
exemplary defensive performances.
The goalkeepers of both teams have
attained prominence within the Pac
-10. UCLA goalkeeper Lindsay Culp
j-ecorded eight saves and Stanford
goalkeeper Carly Smolak recorded
six saves.
The loss leaves the Cardinal with
three losses in its last four games and
in a deep hole in Pac-10 play.
