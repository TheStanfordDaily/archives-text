WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford (14-2.9-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) d. Oregon
(6-14. 1-8), 5-11. 15-1. 16-14.
■ Friday: Stanford d. Oregon State
(11-8. 1-7). 15-4. 15-10, 15-8.

Certainly not the ideal script for
the first halt of the season for the
Stanford women's volleyball team.
The result?

A two-game lead in the Pacific 10
Conference.
With wins against Oregon and
Oregon State over the weekend, the
Cardinal closed out the first half of
its conference schedule with a per
fect 9-0 record and a two-match lead
over USC (12-4,7-2 Pac-10).
Energized hy the return of
Walsh. Stanford rolled to an easy
three-game victory against Oregon
State on Friday evening.
In her first match back after tak
ing a week off to rest her injured
right shoulder, the two-time Ail-
American posted a match-high 13
kills to lead the Cardinal past OSIJ
(11-8. 1-7), 15-4. 15-10.15-8.
Stanford leapt out to a 13-0 lead
in game one and never looked back.
"We played very well at Oregon
State," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "It was an all-around
solid performance for the team. We
didn't do anything pretty, but then
again it is hard to stay too sharp in a
match like that."
As usual, Stanford sophomore
middle blocker Jennifer Detmer had
a solid night at the net, adding 10 kills
and demanding a great deal of atten
tion from the Beaver defense.

"We played good defense and
forced them to make a lot of hitting
errors," Shaw said. "Having Walsh
back in the lineup was a nice boost,
and everyone else on the team rallied
around her."
Yesterday afternoon at
Mac Arthur Court, Stanford over
came a scrappy effort from Oregon
and defeated the Ducks in three, 15-
I I. 15-1, 16-14.
The Cardinal used a balanced at
tack to fool the Oregon blockers, as
four players tallied over 10 kills.
Freshman middle blocker Sara San

drik and Detmer each finished with
11 kills, while Walsh and freshman
outside hitter Michelle Chambers
posted 10 apiece.
"I think the Oregon match was
just a case of playing well enough to
win," Shaw said. "We got behind a
little bit but were able to come back
and pull away in the end. ()regon de
serves some credit for the way they
played.
"They made a little comeback and
made us work hard to come away
with the win."
In order to compensate for the ab

sence of Gregory, Stanford experi
mented with a new lineup in the sec
ond two games, moving Sandrik out
side and bringing freshman Tara
Conrad in as the second middle
blocker.
The new lineup clearly worked, as
evidenced by the Cardinal's 15-1
domination of game two.
"That is the great thing about this
team — we don't just have one com
plete standout. We have such a great
balance that when someone is down,
we can confidently make some ad
justments and pick up the slack."
