## Volleyball sweeps through Oregon

The loss of five seniors that led
your program to three national
championships. A young team that
often starts two freshman and two
sophomores. Injuries to two of your
experienced stars. Kerri Walsh and
Jaimi Gregory.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford (14-2.9-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) d. Oregon
(6-14. 1-8), 5-11. 15-1. 16-14.
■ Friday: Stanford d. Oregon State
(11-8. 1-7). 15-4. 15-10, 15-8.

Certainly not the ideal script for
the first halt of the season for the
Stanford women's volleyball team.
The result?

A two-game lead in the Pacific 10
Conference.
With wins against Oregon and
Oregon State over the weekend, the
Cardinal closed out the first half of
its conference schedule with a per
fect 9-0 record and a two-match lead
over USC (12-4,7-2 Pac-10).
Energized hy the return of
Walsh. Stanford rolled to an easy
three-game victory against Oregon
State on Friday evening.
In her first match back after tak
ing a week off to rest her injured
right shoulder, the two-time Ail-
American posted a match-high 13
kills to lead the Cardinal past OSIJ
(11-8. 1-7), 15-4. 15-10.15-8.
Stanford leapt out to a 13-0 lead
in game one and never looked back.
"We played very well at Oregon
