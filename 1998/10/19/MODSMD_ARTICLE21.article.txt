"It looks like they're dancing," said eight
year-old Stanford soccer fan Nick Cohen as he
watched the men's soccer team yesterday at
New Maloney Field.
Dancing is exactly what the seventh
ranked Cardinal (10-4, 3-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) did this weekend as it
upset the No. 4 Washington Huskies 2-1 in
overtime on Friday and then downed the Ore
gon State Beavers 2-0 vesterday.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford (10-3, 3-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) 2, Oregon State
(5-5-1.1-3)0.
■ Friday: No. 7 Stanford 2, No. 4 Washington
(10-3,3-1) 1 (OT).

"lt was a good victory but I wish we could
have put it away a little earlier," said head
coach Bobby Clark after Sunday's game. "But
if you had told me before the start of the week
end that we would have come away with two
victories 1 would have been very pleased."
Indeed, with two solid victories, Clark has a
lot to be pleased about.
Not only did the upset of Washington
prove the ability of the team, but it also kept
the Cardinal in the MPSF title race. Now both
Stanford and Washington, who entered the
match as the top-ranked team in the region,
have one loss.
"You can't articulate how important this

win is." said senior midfielder Simon Elliott,
who scored Friday's first goal and provided
the game-winning assist. "This win was vital
for us to get back on track."
It was sophomore Luke Rust who provided
the heroics for Stanford, scoring the game
winning goal 10 minutes into sudden-death
overtime. Rust, who hails from Washington
and was playing in only his fourth career game,
converted his first goal as a Cardinal off a cross
from Elliott into the victory.
The goal was created off a defensive stand
by senior Jamie Clark, who then fed the ball to
Elliott on the left side of the box. Elliott
crossed the ball to Rust on the right, who rico
cheted the ball off the far post and into the goal
past Washington's Peter Van de Ven.
Rust, who had been inserted into the game
during overtime and was playing for only the
fourth time this season, had an opportunity to
put the game away earlier in overtime, but was
unable to convert his first opportunity.
"It is incredible," Rust said of the game
winning goal. "All I could think about was not
putting in the first chance. 1 have no idea how
[the winner] went in. I am just happy about it."
The overtime victory was the climax of an
intense l(X)-minute battle. Much of the first
half was played around the midfield and nei
ther team was able to assert its dominance.
The Cardinal got on the board first with a
goal by Elliott in the sixth minute of the sec
ond half. Elliott's brilliant play created nu
merous opportunities all game long, but it was
a full team effort that set up his goal.

ington off guard by taking a quick in
direct kick up the sideline. Senior
midfielder Shan Gaw settled the ball
and sent it across the box to Elliott,
who headed the game's first goal
into the net. The goal was Elliott's
lourth of the year, and his assist late
in the game was also his fourth.
Less than five minutes later, how
ever. the Huskies equalized, slowing
Stanford's momentum. Washington
senior Craig Waibel put the ball
through a crowd of defenders and
into the net.
Stanford wouldn't let the tying
goal hold it back, however, and play
grew extremely intense at the end of
the half. Five yellow card warnings
were handed out in the next 20 min
utes of the game. The Cardinal came
close to a go-ahead goal when Hem
merich worked his way through

three Washington defenders but was
taken down inside the penalty box.
Stanford was awarded a penalty
kick and senior captain A.J. Sauer
stepped to the line, but his shot was
blocked by Van de Ven, and the
score remained tied at 1-1.
The victory was a huge step for
the Cardinal in both conference
standings and attitude.
"It is definitely a good confidence
booster to beat a good team ranked
above us." Elliott said.
Stanford head coach Bobby
Clark stressed the importance of the
manner in which Stanford captured
the game.
"We showed tremendous disci
pline and character." Bobby Clark
said. "With the missed penalty kick
and their goal, it is easy to drop your
head, but we stuck with it. We de
served it."
In Sunday's game, the Cardinal
converted on a direct kick in the 12th
minute after Oregon was called for a

hand ball just outside the 18-yard
line. Elliott took the kick after a
dummy by Gaw. Instead of dumping
the ball into the box, Elliott passed
the ball, beside the Beaver wall, to
Gaw who had run to the baseline.
Gaw crossed the ball across the goal
as a frozen Oregon team looked on
and senior defender Jamie Clark
calmly put it away to the opposite
corner
"That is the third time we have
scored on [that set play]," said
Bobby Clark. "I'm surprised other
teams haven't been scouting us."
Stanford dominated play the rest
of the half and came out gunning
after halftime. The second goal came
early in the second half at 46:39.
"The team had to put in a lot of
effort to win — it didn't come easy,"
said senior forward Adam Siegman.
"It would have been nice if 1 could
have scored so all the guys who work
really hard at practice could have
gotten to play."
