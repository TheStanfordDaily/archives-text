"It looks like they're dancing," said eight
year-old Stanford soccer fan Nick Cohen as he
watched the men's soccer team yesterday at
New Maloney Field.
Dancing is exactly what the seventh
ranked Cardinal (10-4, 3-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) did this weekend as it
upset the No. 4 Washington Huskies 2-1 in
overtime on Friday and then downed the Ore
gon State Beavers 2-0 vesterday.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Yesterday: No. 7 Stanford (10-3, 3-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) 2, Oregon State
(5-5-1.1-3)0.
■ Friday: No. 7 Stanford 2, No. 4 Washington
(10-3,3-1) 1 (OT).

"lt was a good victory but I wish we could
have put it away a little earlier," said head
coach Bobby Clark after Sunday's game. "But
if you had told me before the start of the week
end that we would have come away with two
victories 1 would have been very pleased."
Indeed, with two solid victories, Clark has a
lot to be pleased about.
Not only did the upset of Washington
prove the ability of the team, but it also kept
the Cardinal in the MPSF title race. Now both
Stanford and Washington, who entered the
match as the top-ranked team in the region,
have one loss.
"You can't articulate how important this

win is." said senior midfielder Simon Elliott,
who scored Friday's first goal and provided
the game-winning assist. "This win was vital
for us to get back on track."
It was sophomore Luke Rust who provided
the heroics for Stanford, scoring the game
winning goal 10 minutes into sudden-death
overtime. Rust, who hails from Washington
and was playing in only his fourth career game,
converted his first goal as a Cardinal off a cross
from Elliott into the victory.
The goal was created off a defensive stand
by senior Jamie Clark, who then fed the ball to
Elliott on the left side of the box. Elliott
crossed the ball to Rust on the right, who rico
cheted the ball off the far post and into the goal
past Washington's Peter Van de Ven.
Rust, who had been inserted into the game
during overtime and was playing for only the
fourth time this season, had an opportunity to
put the game away earlier in overtime, but was
unable to convert his first opportunity.
"It is incredible," Rust said of the game
winning goal. "All I could think about was not
putting in the first chance. 1 have no idea how
[the winner] went in. I am just happy about it."
The overtime victory was the climax of an
intense l(X)-minute battle. Much of the first
half was played around the midfield and nei
ther team was able to assert its dominance.
The Cardinal got on the board first with a
goal by Elliott in the sixth minute of the sec
ond half. Elliott's brilliant play created nu
merous opportunities all game long, but it was
a full team effort that set up his goal.
