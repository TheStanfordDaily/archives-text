While Stanford's offense battered
the Waves with non-stop shots, Stan
ford goalie Chris Aguilera led the
Cardinal defense with 12 saves.
"Chris was very steady the whole
weekend," Dettamanti said. "He
outplayed [Pepperdine's] All-Amer
ican goalie."
Stanford's defense effectively
shut down the Pepperdine six-on-five
advantage, allowing only one goal
out of nine opportunities.
After three wins in two days, Stan
ford was ready to give UCLA a run
for its money.
Sunday morning saw Stanford
facing the Bruins in the semi-final
round. UCLA led 3-2 after the first
quarter, but Stanford evened the
score to 3-3 by halftime. In the third
period, UCLA again outscored Stan
ford 3-2, for a one-goal lead heading
into the final period.
But once again the tide shifted
back to Stanford and it came back to
tie it up at 7-7 by the time the buzzer
sounded for regulation play.
In the first three-minute overtime
period, Stanford was unable to con
vert on a man-up opportunity. With
24 seconds left in the period, Heiffer
on committed his third personal foul
and was ejected from the game.
In the first 15 seconds of the sec

ond-overtime period, UC'LA's Sam
Grayeli fired a shot past senior goalie
C'hris Aguilera. Although Stanford
had another 6-on-5 ehance to score,
the game ended with an 8-7 Bruins
victory.
"One bad bounce and we lost to
UCLA," said assistant coach Ben
Quittner of an out-of-bounds call
that gave the Bruins an advantage
that led to the game-winning goal.
"Even though we lost, we played
our hearts out," said Rodelo. "We
gave UCLA a good game. We had a
few mistakes, but we did well."
The loss to UCLA put Stanford in
the third-place match against No. 8
Pacific, who beat out top-ranked
IJSC in the first round of play.
Beaubien scored a game-high five
goals, including one two-pointer in
the final quarter which helped the
Cardinal secure a 9-7 win over the
Tigers. Heifferon added two goals in
the first half and Hay shot the final
goal of the game at 2:27 during a
Stanford man-up advantage.
Beaubien led the Cardinal over
the weekend with 11 points, includ
ing a pair of two-pointers.
Stanford's last match marked an
other milestone for Dettamanti, who
reached his 6(X)th career win in 28
years with the victory over UOP.
Dettamanti recently recorded his
s(X)th win in 22 years as the head
