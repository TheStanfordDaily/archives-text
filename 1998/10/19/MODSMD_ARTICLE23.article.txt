MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Friday: No. 1 Stanford finishes
first at Sun Devil Invitational.

With Friday's victory in the Ari
zona State Sun Devil Invitational,
Stanford closed out another unde
feated regular season and heads into
the championship series of meets
with a host of top-caliber athletes.
Holding off competition from the
B squads of No. 5 Arizona and No. 21
Northern Arizona, the No. 1 Cardi
nal racked up a mere 39 points en

route to a commanding victory, out
distancing second place Arizona
State's total of 60.
Stanford was led by the efforts of
senior Brent Hauser. who took indi
vidual honors with a winning time of
24 minutes, 53 seconds on the eight
kilometer course. The Cardinal
placed three runners in the top four
with sophomores Jonathan Riley
(24:54) and Thomas Murley (25:06)
finishing second and fourth, respec
tively.
"We accomplished a great deal
this weekend." said head coach Vin
Lananna. pleased with Friday's hap
penings. "1 think we've put ourselves
in a great place heading into the
championship meets."
Riley's performance in his first
outing with the team this year was es
pecially encouraging, showing that

his rebound from a hip injury suf
fered in the spring is nearly complete.
"There was never more than a few
seconds between me and Brent,"
said Riley, who caught up to Hauser
near the midpoint of the race. "When
the pack started to thin out. I knew it
would be a good time to go with
him."
From there. Riley and Hauser
cruised to the finish, placing comfort
ably ahead of Brandon Leslie (25:02)
of Southwest Indian Polytechnic.
Still, Riley believes there is room
for improvement.
"I'm not quite where I need to be
by the end of the season," said Riley,
"but of course it's not the end of the
season yet."
Lananna was also impressed with
Riley's showing.
"I really expected Jonathan to

come through and perform." said
Lananna. "Jonathan is very fit, and
he's been ready to race for a few
weeks now. I hoped that he would
rise to the occasion, and he did."
Murley, who is also recovering
from an injury which has limited his
action this fall, was another standout
for the Cardinal. After tailing Hauser
and Riley for much of the race, Mur
ley closed strongly at the finish and
nearly caught Leslie.
Finishing up the scoring for Stan
ford were 15th-place Jamey Clifford
(25:29). a redshirt freshman, and true
freshman Jonathan Stevens, who
crossed the line in 25:42 for
place.
