WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford finishes
third at Sun Devil Invitational.

A squad made up mostly of run
ners who have not had many oppor
tunities to compete this year was sent
not so much with the intention of
winning as with the intention of corn

peting on a high level. The results
were modest. The Cardinal finished
third behind two full-strength Pacific
10 Conference teams in UCLA and
host Arizona State.
With the Pac-10 Championships
just two weeks away, head coach Vin
Lananna and assistant coach Beth
Alford-Sullivan believed resting
most of the top women was a higher
priority than winning the meet.
"The meet in itself was not a big
deal," Lananna said. "The purpose of
the meet was to give a lot of our ath
letes an opportunity to get a competi
tion under their belt and to give Mary
[Cobb] an opportunity to run up in
the front. I think in that respect, it
went well."
Cobb, the team captain, was the
only Cardinal woman in the line up
who is consistently one of team's top
five finishers. She finished third in 17
minutes, 57 seconds, coming in be
hind Northern Arizona's Rikki Ped
ersen (17:34) and Arizona State's
Priscilla Mein.
"I was really happy with my first
mile and my third mile," Cobb said. "I

think I felt a little tired in the second
mile, but I was very excited at the end
to have that good opening and finish.
Overall, 1 felt pretty good. I think I'm
a little tired just from traveling every
where, especially Kansas. In light of
that I was happy with my race."
While Cobb was the only top-10
finisher for Stanford, the coaches
found several positive things to take
away from the meet.
"UCLA ran really, really well and
it was good to be able to see another
couple of Pac-10 Conference teams
run at full strength," Sullivan said. "I
thought it was good experience."
Additionally, the meet served as
an opportunity to solidify a roster for
the upcoming championship season.
"Part of the reason for going to
the meet was to get some of the ath
letes a chance to see what they can
do," Lananna said. "I think it defi
nitely solidified us."
Coach Sullivan agreed.
"I actually think that one of our
strengths this year is the depth at that
six, seven, eight, nine and 10 spot,"
Sullivan said. "Kids like Courtney
Adams who had been out sick for a
good 10 days and Colleen Flaherty
who is just a young freshman really
had the opportunity to get in there to
compete well."
Flaherty was the second finisher
for the Cardinal in 16th place. It was
her third consecutive top-20 finish
and it put her in good standing as a
possible post-season participant.
Adams was the third Cardinal
across the line in 22nd place.
"It's hard to come back and feel
good about yourself when you are
not racing as well as you would like,
but you kind of have to remember
the circumstances," said Adams. "1
didn't race as well as I would have
liked, but I guess 1 am pleased for
coming back after being sick."
