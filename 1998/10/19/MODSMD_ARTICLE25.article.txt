## Chess team upsets traditional powerhouse on the road 
### Anthony Chiu 
Stanford's chess team sent shock
waves throughout the collegiate
chess world last weekend when it
upset the heavily favored University
of Maryland at Baltimore County by
a score of 3.5-2.5 at ChessFest '98.
After the teams played to a 2 2
draw at the 1997 Pan-American In
tercollegiate Chess Championships,
I!MBC challenged Stanford to a re
match in ChessFest '98, an annual
event in which UMBC invites an op
posing team to Baltimore for a six
hoard match. Until Saturday,
lIMBC had never lost in this event,
which had previously featured
teams such as Harvard, MIT, and
Johns Hopkins.
"We went up there with nothing
to lose," said Cardinal Chess Club
Vice President Michael Aigner, a
master s student in mechanical engi
neering. "We were hoping to put our
best effort forward and show that
Stanford does have a good chess
team that is competitive with the top
schools. We did a lot more than
that."
Cioing into the match, the odds
did not look favorable for Stanford.
( hess players are rated by the Unit
ed States Chess Federation on a
scale from zero to 28(X) (the rating
held by World Chess Champion
(iarry Kasparov). Even though they
were missing three players with rat
ings over 2350, UMBC still had an

average rating that was 160 points
higher than Stanford.
"I was always very positive but
also very realistic. I think that we all
knew that we would be happy with
two points out of six," said senior
and club president Adrian
Keatinge-Clay. In team chess
matches, half a point is awarded for
a draw and one point is awarded for
a win.
In the match, the No. 1 board fea
tured freshman Etan Ilfeld against
UMBC's Tal Shaked, the reigning
World Junior Champion. Although
Shaked, a grandmaster with a rating
of 2,567, eventually prevailed, Ilfeld
held his own. "It was intense, [and]
we had a good four-hour struggle, so
I was satisfied." said Ilfeld.
On the No. 3 board, Aigner de
feated Oxana Tarassova, known in
national chess circles as the "Mon
golian Terror," while senior Ivan
Troufanov beat Nathan Fewel on
the No. 5 board. UMBC then drew
even when David Shin vanquished
senior Sergei Linnik on the No. 6
board.
Tied with two points apiece with
15 minutes left in this timed match,
the outcome hinged on the results of
the No. 2 and 4 boards. On the No. 2
board, Keatinge-Clay had a slight
advantage over UMBC's Eugene
Perlshteyn, while Erik Stuart, a doc
toral student in Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, was locked in a
battle with Derrick Longo on the

No. 4 board.
However, after Longo refused a
draw offer, Stuart found a way to
turn the game into a win. Seeing that
Stuart was going to win. Keatinge-
C'lay put the needs of the team
ahead of his personal aspirations
and immediately accepted a draw to
clinch the match for Stanford.
With the landmark victory, Stan
ford expccts to gain respect in the
collegiate chess scene. "We got
pushed up a lot in terms of reputa
tion with this win. It shows that Stan
ford can compete with the big boys
in chess," said Aigner.
Stanford's chess program differs
.from traditional chess powers such
as UMBC. University of Toronto,
and the University of Texas at Dal
las in its age and players.
"The current club was founded
four years ago by Irvin Tyan, so
we're a building program," said
Aigner. "On the other hand, UMBC
recruits and offers scholarships to
chess players, so obviously they at
tract better players."
Stanford hopes to continue their
success at their next major event, the
Fan-American Intercollegiate
Championships in December.
"The win has really given a boost
of confidence to the team," said
Keatinge-Clay. "We know that
we're able to beat premier schools
like UMBC, and that gives us a lot of
hope for the upcoming National In
tercollegiate Championships."
