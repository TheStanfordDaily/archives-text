# Basketball teams open up practice
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Although I lie chaos began a week
ago in attempts to acquire a coveted
men's season basketball pass, the
men's and women's basketball sea
son kicked oil Saturday morning at
12:01 in the inaugural Cardinal
( haos at Maples Pavilion.
And as the evening concluded
with junior Mark Madsen's two
handed shun dunk, everyone in
Maples could tell an exciting season
ol basketball lay in the near future.
With lines wrapping through the
courtyard between Maples and Ar
rillaga, students and local residents
alike rushed into the pavilion as
doors opened at 9:45 p.m. Friday in
anticipation ol the clock striking mid
night lor the basketball season to of
ficially begin.
And as 12 o'clock approached,
the bu// grew louder and louder
amongst the fans.
Al quarter to the hour, lights in
the stadium dimmed anil the teams
took center stage with introductions.
I lie spotlight panned back and forth
between the two teams with alternat
ing introductions between each.
While the men's team was familiar to
most seasoned fans ol ( ardinal bas
ketball. the night lor the young
women's squad was more of a debut
lot a talented freshman class.
Introductions were followed by
the intrasquad scrimmages, a

women's three-point shooting con
test and finished with the men's slam
clunk contest.
The scrimmages provided a good
opportunity for both teams to see the
floor, hut it was the slam dunk contest
that captivated the crowd.
The night's contests were judged
by a Stanford celebrity panel of five
judges. The group included basket
ball and volleyball Stanford alumna
Kristin Folkl, former football stand
out (ireg Clark, who now is a starting
lineman for the San Francisco 49ers,
and (Mympic gold medalist and Stan
ford sophomore Kerri Strug. The
group was rounded out by Dean of
Admissions Robert Kinnallv and
football great and I leisman Trophy
winner Jim I'lunkett.
As the dunk contest began, fresh
man Kyle Logan immediately en
deared himself to the student section
as lie followed his first Hying dunk
with a Ilex to the crowd. But Madsen
eventually beat senior Kris Weems
for the title.
The favorite crowd-involvement
activity was the "Mad Dog Mash."
()n a movie projector screen hanging
above the baseline, the crowd was re
minded of Madsen's now-trademark
celebratory "dance" after his dunk
during the "Miracle Minute" against
Rhode Island in last season's N( 'AA
Midwest Regional final. Five fans se
lected at random from the crowd
were clad in No. 45 jerseys and imi
tated Mad Dog's gesture.
