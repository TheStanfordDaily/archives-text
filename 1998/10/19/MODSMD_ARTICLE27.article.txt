## 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
It was the best of times, it is now
the worst of times. Home will never
feel quite as good as it did last night
for Stanford women's field hockey
team, which returned from Boston
College after suffering a 1 -0 defeat
to the Harvard Crimson (7-5) yes
terday and a 4-1 loss at the hands of
l()th-ranked Boston College (12-2)
last Friday.

■ Yesterday: Harvard (7-5) 1, Stan
ford (9-5) 0.
■ Friday: No. 10 Boston College
(12-2)4. Stanford 1.

The Cardinal (9-5) left last week
to play a four-game road trip in the
Northeast with hopes of demon
strating its talent and ability against
some of the nation's best teams.
Stanford had reason to be opti
mistic. After winning its last five
matches and playing at arguably its
best level of the season, the Cardi
nal hoped to do to the East Coast
teams what it had been able to do
to Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference rivals. After all. in its first
10 games Stanford went 8-2,
outscoring its opponents 2K-11.
I Jnfortunately for Stanford, the
East Coast was not as friendly as
the Cardinal hoped. Entering the

trip Stanford knew that to earn its
rite of passage into the NCAA
postseason tournament it would
have to play flawlessly in order to
defeat nationally ranked teams
such as Northeastern and Boston
College.
Yesterday the team completed
its eastern tour on a sour note.
Matching up against Harvard for
an afternoon game at Boston Col
lege, the Cardinal handed the
Crimson its fifth consecutive win.
Locked in another defensive
battle, Harvard scored the only
goal of the match, securing its sev
enth victory of the season. Stan
ford, on the other hand,hopped on
the plane with its fifth loss. The
game was uncomfortably reminis
cent -of last Wednesday, when
Northeastern defeated the Cardi
nal 1-0.
The loss to Harvard will be es
pecially difficult for the team to
swallow as it came on the heels of
two previous losses, the most re
cent at the hands of No. 10 Boston
College last Friday.
After beginning its road trip I -1,
Stanford arrived at Boston College
hoping to rebound against BC.
The Eagles had a different plan
in mind.
Just 1:15 into the first half, se
nior co-captain Joy Ramsbotham
gave the Eagles a I -0 lead on a dou
ble assist from seniors Janis Corn
well and Anne Marie Ambros.

The Cardinal, meanwhile, was
shut out through the first 35 min
utes of play, extremely uncharac
teristic compared to its frequent 5-
0 and 4-0 rompings of West Coast
teams.
The second half did not bring re
lief for Stanford. Just over six min
utes in. another double assist, this
one from junior Kellie Misaiaszek
and freshman Clina Dinan, set up
Katie Gentile for the Eagles' sec
ond goal of the match.
Showing the persistence that
has helped the Cardinal climb to
the top of the NorPac, senior for
ward and team point leader
Monique Leroux put her team on

the board. Leroux's l()th goal of the
season gave Stanford new hope.
After all. it had yet to he defeated
when the offense had delivered a
goal.
For just over 10 minutes the
Cardinal remained within one goal
of a tie. However. Boston College
junior Julianne Marrone sent a
pass from Gentile past Stanford
goalie Meg Crowley for the Eagles'
third goal.
Within five minutes Boston
College struck again. Recording
her fifth point of the game. Gentile
put her team up 4-1 with the help of
Ambros's second assist of the after
noon.
