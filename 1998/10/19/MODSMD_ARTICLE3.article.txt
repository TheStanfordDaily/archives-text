Those Stanford students w!
were banking on their bookstou
rebates to help them pay those ex
pensive begin ning-of-fall-quarter
phone bills are going to have to
hold off payment for at least anoth
er week.

The Bookstore planned to give
out its annual rebate checks today,
hut. due to a major computer glitch,
the checks will not he given out
until Oct. 28.
I he Bookstore installed a new
computer system on July Ist. The
new system is capable of printing all
of the rebate checks.

However, as a result of an all
system problem, it cannot integrate
the student name and check
amount correctly.
Bookstore computer technicians
are working to correct the problem.

Karen Park said that "all we really
want to do is get the checks out, we
know they're important to stu
dents."
The average amount of each re
bate check came to $52.71, accord
ing to Park. This year's rebate is 10
percent of last year's Bookstore
surplus. The remainder of the sur
plus is used for maintenance and
development costs.
The rebate is down 1 percent
from last year due to a drop in net
sales of approximately $3 million
over the last year, as is explained in
the Bookstore's annual financial
report.
Because there were over 6,(XX)
checks to print. Bookstore employ
ees were unable to write each check
by hand.
They are posting apology signs
around the store explaining the

computer malfunction.
"We are extremely apologetic.
We're only interested in solving the
problem and getting the students
their money," said Park.
This is the last year students will
be receiving their rebates in the

form of a check. The Bookstore's
new computer system allows for an
automatic 7 percent rebate that
comes directly off the price of
books when they are purchased.
The rebate program ending this
year required students to collect
and save receipts from textbook
purchases over the course of the
school year. The receipts were

turned in at the end of the year.
All students who were meticu
lous enough to complete the
process received a percentage of
that year's surplus the following
October.
This year, the automatic rebate
program has already benefited over
14,fXK) students, according to Park.
However, as the money is spread
over twice as many students, each
student gets a smaller rebate under
the new system.
Most Stanford students are not
terribly upset by the delay.
"It doesn't really bother me that
much as long as it's coming," said
senior Sarah McDonald.
Sophomore Katie Watts was
slightly disgruntled by the disrup
tion in her shopping schedule.
However, she said, "as long as my
parents don't find out and I can
keep the money, it doesn't matter
when 1 get it."
Rebate checks will be available
in front of the Bookstore.
