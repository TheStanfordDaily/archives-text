Those Stanford students w!
were banking on their bookstou
rebates to help them pay those ex
pensive begin ning-of-fall-quarter
phone bills are going to have to
hold off payment for at least anoth
er week.

The Bookstore planned to give
out its annual rebate checks today,
hut. due to a major computer glitch,
the checks will not he given out
until Oct. 28.
I he Bookstore installed a new
computer system on July Ist. The
new system is capable of printing all
of the rebate checks.

However, as a result of an all
system problem, it cannot integrate
the student name and check
amount correctly.
Bookstore computer technicians
are working to correct the problem.
