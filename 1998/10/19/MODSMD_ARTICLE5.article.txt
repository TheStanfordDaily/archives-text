# Howard out of intensive care
## Phi Delt recovering; Michigan frosh dies in similar incident 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
Senior Michael Howard, the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity member
who fell from a balcony at the
house last week, has been trans
ferred out of intensive care, ac
cording to Laurel Joyce, director of
the Office of Communications for
the Stanford Medical Center. In
addition, as of 10 p.m. yesterday,
his vital signs are stable and he re

Howard's family declined to

alcohol was directly a factor in
Cantor's death.
Michigan's Phi Delt chapter was
officially alcohol-free, according to

The Michigan Daily. All Phi Delt
chapters are scheduled to go dry in
2000.

reinforces concerns he had about
alcohol abuse.
"What happened at Michigan is

worse than that."
Considering an alcohol-related
death at Rutgers University last
week along with fatalities at MIT
and Louisiana State University last
year, Wais echoed sentiments ex
pressed by University President
Gerhard Casper at a Faculty Sen
ate meeting last Thursday.
"As the president said, lives are
at stake," Wais explained. "I am
very, very concerned. Stanford is
not insulated. Alcohol abuse is
prevalent on every college campus,
at varying levels. Surveys that we
have done through Cowell show
