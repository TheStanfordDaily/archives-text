# Howard out of intensive care
## Phi Delt recovering; Michigan frosh dies in similar incident 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
Senior Michael Howard, the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity member
who fell from a balcony at the
house last week, has been trans
ferred out of intensive care, ac
cording to Laurel Joyce, director of
the Office of Communications for
the Stanford Medical Center. In
addition, as of 10 p.m. yesterday,
his vital signs are stable and he re
mains in "fair" condition.
Howard's family declined to
comment.
As the Stanford community
continued pulling for Howard, an
other alcohol-related tragedy
struck at the University of Michi
gan in Ann Arbor. Early Friday
morning, Courtney Cantor, a
freshman and Chi Omega sorority
pledge, fell from the sixth floor of
her dormitory and died. Cantor
had been drinking at a party at the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity house,
though it remains unclear whether
alcohol was directly a factor in
Cantor's death.
Michigan's Phi Delt chapter was
officially alcohol-free, according to

The Michigan Daily. All Phi Delt
chapters are scheduled to go dry in
2000.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
pointed out although the incident
at the University of Michigan re
mains very different from what
happened at Stanford last week, it
reinforces concerns he had about
alcohol abuse.
"What happened at Michigan is
even more tragic than what hap
pened here," Wais said. "It result
ed in a fatality and it can't get any
worse than that."
Considering an alcohol-related
death at Rutgers University last
week along with fatalities at MIT
and Louisiana State University last
year, Wais echoed sentiments ex
pressed by University President
Gerhard Casper at a Faculty Sen
ate meeting last Thursday.
"As the president said, lives are
at stake," Wais explained. "I am
very, very concerned. Stanford is
not insulated. Alcohol abuse is
prevalent on every college campus,
at varying levels. Surveys that we
have done through Cowell show
that alcohol abuse at Stanford is
clearly below the national level,
but it is still a subject that we are
very concerned about."
Sending her sympathy and con
dolences to Cantor's family and
friends at the University of Michi
gan, ASSU President Maren Nor
ton pointed out that the problem of
alcohol abuse on college campuses
is hardly a new one.
Although alcohol abuse is a sub
ject Norton said she and ASSU
Vice President Santos Marroquin
had discussed with administrators
prior to the incidents here and at
the University of Michigan, she
added that tragedies added a new
dimension to the talks.
"It's sad that it has taken these
tragedies to continue the dia
logues," Norton said.
Norton emphasized that al

though she believes that alcohol
abuse is a national problem of na
tional concern, she sees it as a trend
rather than an epidemic.
"We are not alone," she said.

"A lot of campuses are looking at
this issue. It's not a specific frater
nity issue and it's not a specific
Stanford issue."
At Thursday's Faculty Senate
meeting Casper charged the ASSU
leadership to work closely both
with Vice Provost James Montoya
and Wais to come up with ways to
respond to alcohol abuse on the

Stanford campus.
"We take that charge very seri
ously," Norton said. "We are
pulling for Mike and we feel sorry
and horrible for his family. We
need to do whatever we can to
make sure that it does not happen
again to any one at any school,
ever."
Norton said that she and Marro
quin plan to look at short term so
lutions, such as providing students
with alternatives to drinking. They
also are planning programs that
will hopefully prove effective in the
long run.
For example, they plan to im
prove educational programs al
ready in place and make sure the
student community knows and
cares about watching out for each
other.
"What does it mean to have a
caring community?" Norton
asked. "Can you create one? How?
Asking those three questions is the
key to addressing this problem."
