## Campus mourns victim of Wyoming hate crime 
### Joshua Robin 
They came to remember a young man they never
knew. About 250 people gathered in White Plaza Friday
night for a vigil, then moved to Memorial Church for a
service to pay tribute to Matthew Shepard, the 21-year
old University of Wyoming student who died last Mon
day.
Shepard died after he was pistol-whipped and left
tied to a fence for 18 hours in the near-freezing temper
atures of a Wyoming fall night in what police say was an
act of anti-gay violence.
The mourners were both gav and straight, young and
old. Some had attended previous remembrances and
wore the rainbow-colored band of the gay rights move
ment. Others were drawn from their Friday night plans
by the mostly impromptu speakers, who shared person
al stories of similar loss. sang, or vocalized their anger
that a young man could be killed just for being himself.
"This could have been me." said Marcos Garcia, a
doctoral student in immunology, whose lover was killed
outside a University of Illinois bar in IW) after being
taunted with anti-gay epithets. No arrests have been
made in the case which the I University of Illinois labeled
accidental, Garcia said.
Without accompaniment and holding a candle with a
painting of the Virgin Mary. Jacquie Bradd, a junior,
echoed Garcia's sentiment, singing Holly Near's "It
Could Have Been Me."
The services, coordinated by the Stanford Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center, echoed similar
gatherings across the country. Shepard's death has also
reopened the debate over whether government officials
should broaden hate-crime legislation that increase
penalties for crimes committed on the basis of religion,
race, gender, national origin or sexual orientation.
Wyoming currently has no hate-crime laws, though it
does have strict punishment guidelines for violent of
fenses. If convicted. Shepard's killers could face the
death penalty.
Some speakers, including Rev. Maurice Charles, as
sociate dean for religious life, who led the church ser
vice, asked that Shepard's death reinforce the crowd's
commitment to never turn away from injustice.
"Matthew's pain was our pain," Charles said. "When
he cried out, his cry was our cry and we heard it. When
he died out there alone, we felt it."
"There's the chance we might be here again, holding
candles for another hate crime." added Rubv Pasigan. a

law student. "We can't let that happen."
Wearing a rainbow ribbon around his neck. Bob Tay
lor, a member of the Menlo Park chapter of Parents,
Friends and Family of Lesbians and Gays, said he came
to Stanford to show that "gay people have a right to exist
and be contributing members of our society." His gay
son was shot and seriously injured outside a bar in San
Diego, considered by many a vibrant gay community.
While anti-gay protesters picketed outside Shepard's
Wyoming funeral Friday, there was no sign of dissent at
either the vigil or the service.
