# Stanford community discusses crimes of hate
## 
### kitten Hsieh 
Matthew Shepard may be dead, but outrage over
the brutality of his murder is living at Stanford. The sav
age crime has galvanized the community in a fight to in
crease awareness on campus.
"I'm not ashamed to say that I'm angry beyond be
lief," said one participant in the candlelight vigil Friday
night, who declined to be named. "My anger drives
me."
The violence of the crime hit members of the les
bian. gay. bisexual and transgendered community par
ticularly hard, according to Rev. Maurice Charles, as
sociate dean for religious life. Charles led a service of
healing at Memorial Church on Sunday.
"Many of us have experienced violence ranging
from something as mild as the taunts you receive as
children to beatings that put us in the hospital," said
Charles. "This event has underscored a deep connec
tion many of us didn't know we felt."
Charles was surprised by the number of people who
reacted to Shepard's death as if he was a relative. He
said that he believes people arc paying attention pre
cisely because the inhuman nature of the murder shat
ters the myth that privileged college students are insu
lated from violence.
"The fact of the matter is that it can happen any
where," he said.
The episode has raised the question of whether a
similar incident could occur at Stanford.
"I think it's less likely to happen because people
here tend to be more educated and
tolerant and less ignorant," said
sophomore B.J. Hwan. "I think that
they would know better."
Sophomore Michael Silva said
that the event has made him appre
ciate Stanford a lot more.
> "It's really easy to be out at Stan
ford," Silva said. "At the same time,
I have to wonder whether this world
Km living in is realistic."
Senior Anthony Engel said he
believes that even people who don't
agree with supporting alternative
lifestyles at Stanford would not re
sort to violence.
■> "And if this isn't the real world,
then 1 prefer it this way," Engel said.
But Kanishk Agarwal, a master's
Student at the Graduate School of
Business, said he believes hate
crimes occur all the time on campus
id much more subtle ways.

One graduate student said that
three students threw stones at him as
he biked home from the Lesbian,
Gay, and Bisexual Community Cen
ter's orientation party on the night of
Friday. Sept. 25 this year. One of the
men called him "motherfucker" and
grabbed hold of his bike. The stu
dent ignored them and rode away
unharmed.
In another recent incident, a stu
dent said he was called "queer boy"
and was told to stay out of an argu
ment or he would get hurt.
"We know there's been a history
of people perceived as gay being
thrown out of parties and being
shoved around," said Gwendolyn
Dean, director of the LGBCC. "For
the most part these things are acci
dents. but they can escalate, and I
wouldn't say it couldn't happen
here."
One student said he has experi
enced verbal abuse in recent years
when other students have seen him
holding hands with or kissing his

lover. And anti-gay vandalism has
defaced personal property as well as
The Bollard eating club and the
"Gay Liberation" statue in the past.

While some students were loath
to discuss personal experiences or
had none to speak of, one student
said that he didn't want it to appear
"as if it's just the gay community
complaining again."
Dean said that she doesn't think
there exists equal levels of revulsion
for harassing someone over their
racial or religious identity, and ha
rassing someone over their sexual
identity.
"It's a much larger group of peo

pie who would be horrified by racist
remarks and a smaller one that
thinks calling someone a 'fag' or a
'dyke' is repulsive, unacceptable be
havior," she said.
Dean is concerned that news of
Shepard's death will intimidate peo
ple in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgendered community.
"This is our worst nightmare,"
she said. "We try and say 'No, it's
safe — you have a community, and if
you have a problem, we'll take care
of it for you' and then something like
this happens and it makes us liars."
Hut there is safety in numbers, ac
cording to Dean.
"If 1 have one thing to say it's that
isolation is very dangerous." she
said. "It's probably the most unsafe
thing. You're safer when you have a
community, and there's a lot of sup
port here."
Dean said that she believes the
administration is committed to im
proving the climate at Stanford.
Dean of Students Marc Wais has of

fered the center financial assistance
to cover whatever programming ac
tivities it feels is appropriate as a re
sponse to this issue. The center is
currently planning a variety of fol
low-up education programs about
hate crimes, harassment, and homo
phobia.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya said that the Uni

teaching respect and value of all
people.
The hope is that by honoring
Shepard at Stanford, people will be
come more open, not only to differ

every human difference, and that
this trend will continue even after
the outrage fades.
