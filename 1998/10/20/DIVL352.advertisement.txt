TAKE TECHNOLOGY
ioaaitciwpGKm
When something is too extreme for words, it's to the Nth degree. And that's the
level of technology you'll experience at Raytheon.
Raytheon has formed a new technological superpower-Raytheon Systems
Company, composed of four major technological giants: Raytheon Electronic
Systems, Raytheon E-Systems, Raytheon Tl Systems and Hughes Aircraft.
The new Raytheon Systems Company is driving technology to the limit. And
we're looking for engineers who want to push the envelope. Break new ground.
Make their mark.
At Raytheon, you'll take technology-and your career-to the highest possible
level. You'll take it to the Nth. We'll be visiting your campus soon. Contact your
career placement office now to schedule an interview, or check out our website
at www.rayjobs.com. If you are unable to meet with us, please send your resume
to: Raytheon Resume Processing Center, PO Box 660246, MS-201, Dallas, TX 75266.

PEOPLE
The fun does not have to stop when the
paychecks start. Especially when you |oin
Adobe. We offer big company success with a
small-company attitude. Of course, we did not
become one of the world's largest personal
computer software developers without lots of
hard work. But when your products lead the
industry year after year, enriching the way
everyone communicates, you have plenty to
smile about. So if you agree that it's possible to
have fun while doing interesting and creative
work, Adobe may be the place for you. To learn
more about opportunities at Adobe, visit the
Computer Forum and sign up for an interview.
