## 500 killed in Nigerian fire 
### 
JESSE, Nigeria (AP) —The charred
remains of victims still clutched the plastic
cups, funnels and cans they intended to use
to scoop gasoline from a punctured
pipeline before it exploded in this southern
Nigerian town.
The bodies were among at least S(H)
killed when the fuel erupted into a ball of
fire over the weekend, an inferno so
intense that flames — some shooting 65
feet in the air — still flared Monday as fire
fighters let the last of the gasoline burn
away.
The burned body of one woman was
found with her dead baby still strapped to
her back. Many other victims were farmers
and villagers sleeping in homes consumed
by the blaze that also spread to nearby
towns.
Grieving relatives came Monday to
Jesse, about IKO miles southeast of Lagos,
searching for relatives who ventured to the
town drawn by rumors that a huge pool of
spilled gasoline was free for the taking.
"It is finished," cried Charity
Unurhoro, after finding the horribly
burned bodies of her mother and brother.
"Now everything is over for me."
Authorities believe the pipeline was

punctured intentionally, and that scav
engers' tools sparked the explosion Satur
day, said an official for Nigeria's state
petroleum corporation, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity. Some newspaper
reports, however, said it may have been a
lighted cigarette that started the blaze.
A mass grave was being dug at the edge
of Jesse to bury hundreds of unidentified
corpses, many burned beyond recognition.
Some bodies remained scattered about
town on Monday afternoon, but most were
piled together. About 1 (K) people were
hospitalized, many of them in serious con
dition.
Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar flew in by helicopter for a 15-
minute visit. He said the government
would pay for medical treatment, but that
there would be no compensation to sur
vivors, apparently because many of those
killed were believed to be stealing fuel.
But area residents were furious over
the deaths.
"This is a tragedy of huge proportions,"
the Rev. Andrew Imadu, a local minister,
said at one funeral in Jesse. "Our own peo
ple have been driven by deprivation to
such a desperate search for livelihood."

Southeastern Nigeria, while rich in oil,
is scarred by decades of poverty and vil
lagers in some areas are believed to regu
larly sabotage oil pipelines in order to file
claims for compensation.
The above-ground pipeline that caught
fire links a refinery in the southeastern city
of Warri. 210 miles southeast of Lagos,
with the northern city of Kaduna, nearly
3HO miles away.
Over the weekend, hundreds of people
descended on the town as rumors spread
that a huge pool of gasoline — which had
spilled from the pipeline into a concrete
well — was available for the taking, said
J.I. Ogude, village chief of Jesse.
The gasoline theft, known locally as
"bunkering." had been going on since at
least Saturday morning, he said.
The people gathering at the scene, who
Ogude said came from at least seven area
villages — including some attending a
funeral nearby — were taking the gasoline
to sell on the black market.
Despite Nigeria's enormous oil wealth,
years of government misrule and corrup
tion have resulted in almost perpetual fuel
shortages, causing skyrocketing black
market prices and long lines at gas pumps.
