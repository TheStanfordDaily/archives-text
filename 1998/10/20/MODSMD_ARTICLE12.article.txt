# Government antitrust trial against Microsoft begins
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Government lawyers
opened their landmark antitrust trial against Microsoft
Corp. on Monday by accusing the software titan of a
carefully crafted, no-holds-barred campaign to illegally
"crush" a rival company.
The hard-core tactics alleged by the government
included Microsoft using its money and influence as the
maker of the hugely popular Windows operating sys
tem to intimidate computer makers and entice other
companies to distribute Microsoft's own Internet soft
ware over that of Netscape Communications Corp.
The government contended Microsoft launched its
war with Netscape after a controversial June 1995 meet
ing at which Microsoft allegedly proposed, unsuccess
fully. to divide the market for Internet software.
Microsoft has denied ever making such an offer, which
would be illegal under antitrust laws.
"What you see is a consistent pattern of Microsoft
doing this, using its monopoly power, using its leverage,
using everything it has," Justice lawyer David Boies
told U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.

Microsoft's lawyers were expected to make their
opening arguments Tuesday.
The outcome of the trial — expected to last six
weeks — could dramatically change the computer
industry as it becomes increasingly important to virtual
ly every facet of modern life.
The contested 1995 meeting is crucial to the govern
ment's effort to show that Microsoft so feared the
potential of Internet software to threaten its lucrative
Windows system that it acted unfairly to guard it.
The government used videotape excerpts from pre
trial interviews with Microsoft's billionaire chairman.
Bill Gates, to try to show him Monday as reluctant to
discuss the meeting, which he did not attend.
On the tape, made last August, Gates denied that he
instructed his executives to make an illegal offer to
divide the software market with Netscape: "I wasn't
involved in setting up the meeting.... I'm not aware of
such a thing, and it's very much against the way we
operate."
Boies then produced internal Microsoft documents

written days before the 1995 meeting in which Gates
urged his executives to make a deal with Netscape.
"I think there is a very powerful deal of some kind
we can do with Netscape," Gates wrote, suggesting that
Netscape executives "agree to do certain things in the
(browser market)... I would really like to see some
thing like that happen."
Boies also showed a Gates message, written before
the Netscape meeting, in which Gates said: "We could
even give them money as part of the deal, buy a piece of
them or something."
Microsoft said the government took Gates' words
out of context.
"The government once again has based its entire
case on tiny excerpts," spokesman Mark Murray said in
an interview. "The facts will show that Microsoft did
not in any way try to divide the market with Netscape."
In written testimony unsealed Monday, Netscape's
chief executive officer. James Barksdale. said
Microsoft's executives promised during the June 1995
meeting that "we can have our special relationship" if

Netscape agreed not to compete in the unfolding mar
ket for Microsoft's Windows 95 software.
Microsoft made clear that il Netscape didn't agree,
"Microsoft would crush Netscape, using its operating
system monopoly," Barksdale wrote, describing the
offer as "something I had not ever seen happen in my
more than 30 years of experience)... 1 left the meeting
stunned that Microsoft had made such an explicit pro
posal."
The government contends that after Netscape reject
ed the offer. Microsoft sought to limit the main ways
that Netscape distributed its software, through comput
er makers and Internet providers including America
Online, the nation's largest Internet provider.
Six months later, in early 1996, when Microsoft
sought to convince AOL to distribute ils browser soft
ware rather than Netscape's, Gates asked: "How much
do we need to pay you to screw Netscape? This is your
lucky day," according to an AOL official's notes from
that meeting. AOL. announced a deal with Microsoft
three months later.
