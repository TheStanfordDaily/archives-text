# Feds to shoulder burdens of mass migration
## INS steps up in Florida

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) —
The federal government will have
to handle and pay for any future
mass migrations to Florida under an
agreement signed Monday by Gov.
Lawton Chiles.
The deal is the first between the
federal government and a state that
provides for a joint response to a
mass influx of aliens, said Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
"Four years ago. I declared a
state of emergency in south Flori
da ... because the federal govern
ment failed to adequately enforce
U.S. immigration law and protect
the state of Florida," Chiles said.
"Today I'm declaring victory
because the federal government is
stepping up and will assume full
responsibility for future mass

migration response operations."
Under the agreement, INS will
be the lead agency and may ask for
help from Florida — but will reim
burse the state for its costs.
Four years ago, some 30,000
Cubans came to South Florida.
State officials estimated costs
climbed to $50 million, but Florida
received just $18 million from a fed
eral immigration emtrgency fund.
Under the agreement, federal
immigration officials in south Flori
da will have the power to move staff
and resources to Florida without
having to wait for approval from
Washington.
Also, no long-term detention
siies will be built in Florida for
immigrants who make landfall in
the state and state law enforcement
officers will be empowered to
enforce federal immigration law.
