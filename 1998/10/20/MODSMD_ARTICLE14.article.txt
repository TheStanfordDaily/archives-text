Many Americans are still without 911
WASHINGTON (AP) — If you're visiting Montezuma, Ga., and
need help, don't bother calling 911. It doesn't work there and it won't
work in dozens of other places across the country, either.
"Many people think 911 is everywhere," said Woody Glover, execu
tive director of the 911 network for East Texas. '"But there are a lot of
pockets of the country that aren't covered."
By one estimate, roughly 7(M) mostly small and rural counties have no
form of the service. By another estimate, 9 percent of the U.S. popula
tion lacks it.
The major reasons: The estimated $1 million to $4 million in start-up
costs — primarily communications and computer equipment — and the
cost to run the system, including pay for round-the-clock dispatchers.
These costs are paid by the people who live in communities with 911, and
voters usually decide whether their state or county should get the service.
Longtime residents of communities without 911 service generally
know the number to call in an emergency.
"The problem arises when people move into a community or visit it,"
said John Ellison, executive director of 911 service for Shelby County,
Ala. In those cases, precious time can be lost, jeopardizing lives, public
safety officials say.
About 26(),(KX) calls a day are made to 911.

Commuter train opens in Silicon valley
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) A long-awaited commuter train
made its inaugural run Monday, enabling hundreds of commuters to zip
right past the traffic jams created by the boom in Silicon Valley.
The debut of the Altamont Commuter Express was a relief to many
workers weary of the crush of cars streaming into the high-tech mecca
from points eastward, where the living is cheaper.
Some people looking for homes have been pushed as far as Stock
ton — 100 miles to the east — because Silicon Valley's dramatic growth
in the 1990s has led to a tighter housing market and higher rents.
The two purple, blue and white trains carry about 800 passengers
each. The first leaves Stockton at 4:12 a.m. and arrives in San Jose at fr:3l
a.m. with a half-dozen stops along the 85-mile route.
As of last week, about <SOO people had already bought monthly pass
es. which range from $59 to $279. depending on the distance.
The mood was light Monday its passengers read newspapers or typed
on laptop computers. Grover and his friend Chris Mansell. 30. both
workers at Cisco Systems in San Jose, played cards for part of the trip.
Although the new commute doesn't shave much time from the com
mute for many passengers, some said they won't miss driving.
An estimated 36.000 people commute from the San Joaquin Valley to
the Silicon Valley, an increase of almost 500 percent since 1980.
