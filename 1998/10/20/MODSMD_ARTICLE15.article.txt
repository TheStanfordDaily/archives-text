## Editorial A 						homecoming victory 
### 
Alumni turnout and many
activities should serve as
an example for the future

MOST YEARS, n IE only signs for
many students that Homecoming
weekend has arrived are the
greater number of catered tailgates and a
few more older people walking around
campus pointing ;it nil the buildings.
This year, however, the I Jniversity made
a concerted effort to make Homecoming
weekend an event that would strengthen
the University's relationship with alumni
and students. Events such as the Swing
Dance party in the Main Quad and the
"Classes Without Quizzes" academic pro
gram tried to engage the unprecedented
number of returning alumni in fun and chal
lenging programs with students and faculty.
We encourage the University to keep
improving alumni relations and develop
more efficient and organized programs that
encourage alumni to stay involved with
I Jniversity affairs.
The University has devoted much time
and many resources into improving alumni
relations over the last few years. These
efforts culminated in the merger between
the Alumni Association and the University
at the end of last summer. The merger has
the potential to make new alumni initiatives
more feasible by combining the resources
of the I Jniversity with the contacts and pro
jects of the Alumni Association.
Homecoming weekend was organized
by stall from both the Alumni Association

and the University Office of Development.
In addition, by the end of fall quarter, the
University hopes to have completed con
struction of a new alumni facility on the
north side of campus, adjacent to Frost
Amphitheater. The building will replace
the cramped Bowman Alumni House and
feature meeting space, a great hall, a histo
ry room, a business center and a cafe.
The results of this year's Homecoming
Weekend suggest that alumni are interest
ed in maintaining ties with the University.
On average, about 25 percent of alumni
from every class returned for Homecoming
weekend, and positive feedbaek has already
begun to pour into the Alumni Association
offices.
In the future, the new Alumni Associa
tion should continue to promote the popu
lar "Classes Without Quizzes" program and
create new Homecoming events that might
involve even more students and faculty.
Initiatives that involve students as well
as alumni can expose students to the com
mitment many alumni feel towards Stan
ford. This can help ensure that current stu
dents will begin to develop strong ties to
Stanford that will last their entire lives.
This is a noble goal and one that the
Alumni Association and the University
must continue to pursue. While we may
never see alumni take control of campus
for Homecoming weekend as they do at
Princeton, we hope to see more alumni tak
ing an active and enjoyable role during
Homecoming and the entire year. More
locally active and satisfied alumni can only
benefit the students and faculty at Stan
ford.
