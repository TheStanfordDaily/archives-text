## Emergency blue light special 
### 
TO START OFF, as
per the thoughtful
sign in White Plaza
last week, I'd like to wish
you all a Happy Belated
"Columbus Can Kiss My
Red Ass" Day.
On to other news. While

they are few and far between, there are
some enigmas on campus. For example,
what exactly is growing in Columbae's
compost heap? And why does it smell?
And how can they stand the smell?
But we can talk about that later. Today
the focus is large, blue and has a neat light
on top. It also has a big red button that
screams, "Push me." And similar to frosh,
it was unbeknownst to the campus only a
few short years ago. I'm talking about the
911 pole.
In theory, the poles provide quick access
to the police. Say, for example, I was walk
ing and encountered a postal employee, a
Schmeg, or one of the hypersensitive PC
fanatics offended at the opening paragraph
(or insert your own favorite Dan Geyser
fan here). Assuming I could reach the pole
before being caught, I could get help.
But this plan has a little flaw. See, here
in the fourth dimension, there's this thing
called time. If I get to the pole and push the
button, I then have to wait for the police to
come. This means I have to either (1) ask
my attacker to wait a few minutes, which
isn't really a popular request among the
chemically challenged; or (2) push the but
ton and then continue running. Since (1)
would lead to a painful beating, (2) is the
only option, and thus significantly detracts
from the pole's utility. The last time I

checked, screaming "Heelllpp!! I'm run
ning soouutth!" doesn't really accomplish a
whole lot.
However, the pole has evolved over the
years. In an attempt to make the pole idiot
proof, a disclaimer informs its eager users
that the pole is for "emergency use
only" — in other words, no personal
phone calls. Thank God for the clarifica
tion. I know the first thing I think of when
I see a giant blue pole with a red button is
that it will automatically know the number
I want to dial.
But forget the fact that the pole is only
for emergencies. Outside of the deterrent
effect, the pole itself is useless. I guess the
cool blue light may provide Sociology
majors hours of staring pleasure (two
majors down, many to g0...), but that
doesn't really do it for the rest of us.
See, the pole needs some added feature,
some sort of deterrent that would say,
"Hey, maniac, bring it on!" to potential
attackers. But is there any room for
improvement?
For one, the pole could have a force
field. Needless to say, there are many
advantages to the force field. For one, it's a
force field. However, a main problem is
that it does not exist. A second problem
could be misuse of the field: for example, it
would only be a matter of time before the
Business School would move the blue pole
to its soccer goal to ensure scoreless IM
games. While rape and assault are serious
problems, the Business School is a more
ominous threat. Therefore, we cannot
implement the force field.
Another idea would be to load the suck
er with an ax. Now, the ax, if wielded cor

rectly, could scare away (not to mention
behead) a number of criminals. A problem
with the ax would be the strong desire to
use it against meter maids, whose presence
on campus causes about as much happiness
as jock itch. While global utility would
increase, the University would definitely
drop lower in the U.S. News & World
Report college rankings (the category
"Ticket Troll Giving Rate," one of the
magazine's favorite and most cherished
indicators of overall school performance,
would surely suffer). And since Hell has
finally defrosted since the time when Duke
placed above Stanford a few years back,
this may not be the best idea.
A third solution, of course, would be to
equip each pole with my very own "staff of
submission," which by virtue of its magical
powers, has the incredible ability of forcing
underlings to do as I say, when 1 say. A
problem, again, would be with the Business
School. The magical staff would be used as
an evil wand to influence IM referees.
Come to think of it, the biz school students
would also use it on each other to make
sure no one missed IM inner tube water
polo practice. And I think we can all agree
that 10 plays and five set formations are
enough for Team MBA.
Basically, there's no realistic way to
improve the 911 poles. And this only can
mean one thing: the University should add
more of them.

Dan Geyser, a senior majoring in political
science, wishes he lived closer to a blue pole
and an emergency earthquake evacuation
field.
