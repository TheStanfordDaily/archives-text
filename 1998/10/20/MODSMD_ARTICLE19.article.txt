Blumenstein forgets
tragedy of Phi Deli
I'd like to raise my hand and admit that
I will not miss Phi Delta Theta. Let me
thank Matthew Blumenstein for remind
ing me why this is so in his Oct. 16 column.
What was published last Friday showed
a great deal of arrogance and a lack of
class from someone who. whether he likes
it or not, was speaking as a Phi Delt on
behalf ol the Phi Delts. Matthew, I was
hoping to see some sort of apology or
explanation as to why your fraternity
brother Michael Howard was left outside
for nearly six hours after falling 20 feet
from a balcony. Such a column may have
offered some real sincerity to back up Phi
Delt President Jackson Wagener's state
ment to the Daily. "Right now our only
concern is for Mike and his health."
Instead, you chose to boast of the mer
its of Phi Delt and solicit sympathy for
being Stanford's "black sheep," a term
that has really lost meaning on this cam
pus given the frequency of house occu
pancy changes. Your only attention to
Howard came as a footnote. Do you real
ly think anybody cares about how great
your parties were or how nice your house
is when one of your brothers is in intensive
care?
I am willing to look at Howard falling

off a Phi Delt balcony as a freak accident,
although it was preventable. However, let
ting him lay on the ground for six hours
was no accident. This horrific scenario
stems from a climate of carelessness when
it comes to alcohol and hard drug use.
Unfortunately, Phi Delta Theta has left
us with an image that is far more memo
rable than the greatest party we've ever
been to; we've been left with the image of
one of your members stranded while he
was in his gravest hour. In Blumenstein's
words, this image is what makes me "phys
ically ill."
The Phi Delts' behavior puts every
other fraternity and house at Stanford in
danger and gives momentum to very
unpopular ideas, such as making Stanford
a "dry" campus. Freshmen, if anybody
asks you what Phi Delta Theta was like,
please tell them whatever your impression
was. Hut if they ask for a tour of the "old
house," please do not point to the bal
cony, the site of a freak accident; make
sure you point to the ground, the site of a
tragedy.

Free speech not absolute
In his column yesterday, David Stein
parrots the scare tactic used by the "reli

gious right" (which is, of course, neither!)
against passage of hate-crime laws. He
claims "hatred is protected under our
freedom of speech and thought." The
Hate Crimes Prevention Act before
Congress this term would not harm any
one's First Amendment guarantees, but
might actually help contribute to a climate
in which all people might be able to enjoy
the right to "life, liberty and the pursuit of
hapiness."
While we may be guaranteed absolute
freedom of thought by the United States
Constitution, we are NOT guaranteed
absolute freedom of speech. We are not
permitted the freedom to yell "Fire!" in a
crowded theater when there is no fire. We
have the freedom to think how much fun
it might be, but we do NOT have the right
to voice that thought by screaming "Fire!"
in the theater. This is a tired analogy, but
an apt one.
We do not have the right to slander
others. We also do not have the right to
joke about bombs and hijacking in air
ports and on airplanes in this country.
There have been times when I've been at
the airport and I've had a really funny
thing to say about a bomb, but knowing
that if I said it I could wind up in jail has
kept me quiet. Were my First Amendment
rights infringed? I doubt it.
I do not believe all speech should be
"nice" and "proper." Flag burning, while
under many circumstances a distasteful

act, is protected under the First Amend
ment. Many people find themselves very
upset at the exercise of free speech in that
manner. Some protected speech is bound
to upset many, and perhaps sometimes,
most people. I'm all in favor of people get
ting upset by what other people say; that
probably means they're paying attention.
The First Amendment almost certainly
guarantees that we'll all be revulsed at
some point or other by what others say
and do. But it does not permit us to say
anything we want, anywhere we want.
The limits to the right of free speech
have to do with concerns for the compet
ing rights of others in society — by pre
venting mayhem, for example. But there is
no limit to the freedom of thought. So
what are these people so upset about?
Suppose David Stein was home-school
ing his children. Now suppose that while
he was teaching his kids he was also
spending 15 minutes a day telling his chil
dren how much fun it would be, and how
correct it is, to yell "Fire!" in a crowded
theater. After his 16-year stint as home
school educator ends, would we be sur
prised if one of those kids actually went
and yelled "Fire!" in a theater? Would
that "Fire!" then be protected speech,
since the kid would just be acting out the
protected speech of his parent?
Or maybe David would like to teach his
children how fun it would be to phone in
bomb threats to airports or hospitals or

schools. It's all protected speech. But
would his kid's actual bomb threat be pro
tected speech as well? After all, it's OK to
think about it and teach it, right?
Some might say these are far-fetched;
examples. But are they?

Suppose David Stein was home-school
ing his children. Now suppose that while
he was teaching his kids he was also
spending 15 minutes a day telling his chil
dren how much fun it would be, and how
correct it is, to yell "Fire!" in a crowded
theater. After his 16-year stint as home
school educator ends, would we be sur
prised if one of those kids actually went
and yelled "Fire!" in a theater? Would
that "Fire!" then be protected speech,
since the kid would just be acting out the
protected speech of his parent?
Or maybe David would like to teach his
children how fun it would be to phone in
bomb threats to airports or hospitals or

schools. It's all protected speech. But
would his kid's actual bomb threat be pro
tected speech as well? After all, it's OK to
think about it and teach it, right?
Some might say these are far-fetched;
examples. But are they?
Last Friday the Salt Lake Tribune pub-*
lished a news story by Hilary Groutage.
which stated in part: "Students gathered*
around a tree outside Provo's Centennial-
Middle School on Wednesday for an
annual tradition where they voice their*
wishes lor the world. Most were idyllic:.
Stop world hunger. Save the rain forest.
Then a 13-year-old boy stepped to the,
microphone and suggested that 'gay men
be crucified on Main Street and lesbians,
be burned at the stake.' Some of the stu
dents cheered." •
Matthew Shepard hadn't even been*
buried yet.
Is the 13-year-old practicing yelling
"Fire!" in a theatre, or getting himself and.
his cheering fans revved up to bash gay.
lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered per
sons? What if the person who is next tar )
geted for brutalization just "looks" like,
one. whatever that means? Or does it not
really matter, David, since you seem to
believe the First Amendment guarantees'
the right to say everything you think, any
time, anywhere?
