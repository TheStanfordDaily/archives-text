# Stanford in the Cold War years
## New book looks at history of corporate, federal funding 
### Carmel Levitan 
Rebecca Lowen's recent book.
"Creating the Cold War University:
The Transformation of Stanford,"
has sparked a debate over the histo
ry of Stanford's rise to prominence
during the 1
According to the book, which
began as Lowen's doctoral thesis in
history, private industry and govern
ment agencies dramatically shaped
the way in which Stanford devel
oped during the Cold War.
Lowen asserts that in this period,
the University became dependent
on federal and corporate support,
challenging typical conceptions of
the evolution of the modern re
search university.

In a forum hosted by Stanford
Today last spring, former University
President Richard Lyman, former
University Vice President Robert
Rosenzweig, Physics Prof. Emeritus
David Ritson and History Profs.
Barton Bernstein and Timothy
Lenoir discussed the book.
Some panelists suggested that
there was a missing dimension to
Lowen's work.
Rosenzweig told Stanford Today
that he thinks the book "tells part of
the Stanford story ... but she hasn't
really captured either Terman or his

accomplishments fully or fairly, in
part because she's used too narrow a
focus — the Cold War — to explain
too complex a subject."
Lyman suggested that Lowen's
text suffers from "inattention to as
pects of Stanford's development in
years she looked at that don't fit her
thesis."
But Bernstein, Lowen's former
thesis advisor, defended her work.
He told the magazine that many crit
ics have made her book "the target
of their feelings about that troubled
period" of the 19605. He said that
"ideally, they should use her book to
understand better the 30-year peri
od she examines and also to gain a
new perspective on the so-called
'time of troubles' that followed the
early 19605."
According to Lowen. she delib
erately ended her book before the
student upheavals of the 19605,
seeking to avoid taking sides on the
issue.
" The truth is that I decided to
limit the book to the period of the
Depression to the early 1960s be
cause I did not want either to write
about the upheavals on the campus
in the 19605, nor did I want to con
tend with people's very emotional
response, both pro and con. to that
period."
The book starts by examining the
era immediately following the De
pression and continues until the
early 19605, demonstrating the rela
tionship between Stanford's finan
cial situation and the research sup
ported by the University.
"In the beginning, I was mainly
trying to understand the history of
Stanford. Some of the rather limited
secondary literature on the post-
World War II history of universities
and the relationship between uni
versities and private industry and
the federal government had suggest
ed that funders of university-based
research pressured academic scien
tists to undertake work that was of

interest to the funders, but not nec
essarily to the scientists," said
Lowen.
"So I looked for evidence of this
but never found much for the post-
World War II period. What I did un
cover was the prominent role played
by University administrators in
bringing industrial and federal pa
tronage into the University."
The book argues that prior to
World War 11, faculty and depart
ments generally resisted any outside
funding, believing that the Universi
ty needed to remain free from any
pressures that would come from ex
ternal sources. Instead, they valued
the pursuit of "pure" research, free
from political or corporate influ
ences.
Hut the onset of the Depression
left Stanford with financial prob
lems. Fewer students were able to
afford the tuition to enroll and in
come from investments dropped
about 20 percent. The University
needed another source of funding.
Lowen said that she "discovered

that there was a strong anti-statist,
that is, anti-federal government phi
losophy among the University's ad
ministrators, set in part, by Herbert
Hoover. Hoover, along with Stan
ford's president, thought that the
University should develop a close
relationship to private enterprise
but not the federal government."
During World War 11. other re
search universities, including UC-
Berkeley. Harvard and MIT began
to enter into lucrative partnerships
with the federal government. Ad
ministrators realized that University
prestige had become tied to federal
research programs and they sent
representatives to Washington.
D.C. in search of government con
tracts. But Stanford did not receive
funding on anywhere near the scale
of other major universities.
After the war. Stanford contin
ued to seek federal money and pa
tronage became a central issue.
In the book. Lowen emphasizes
that this process of seeking outside
funding had begun prior to World
War 11, rather than as a direct re
sponse to it.
She examines in great detail the
role of Frederick Terman, former

dean of the School of Engineering
and provost, in changing the Univer
sity.
Terman believed that partner
ship between government, the uni
versity and private industry would
lead to a "win-win-win" relation
ship.
This relationship led to the incep
tion of Silicon Valley, as companies
began to cluster around Stanford.
By the early 19605, about 40 per
cent of the University's budget came
from the government and another
portion from private industry.
Terman's financial winnings did
not come without significant prob
lems, the book asserts.
Terman placed an enormous em
phasis on profit and pressed depart
ments to find external funding, en
couraging them to base their ap
pointments upon financial gain.
Lowen examines a number of de
partments at length, showing how)
Terman wielded his influence
against the wishes of much of the
faculty.
This weakened the academic
strength of the undergraduate pro
gram, as teaching was de-empha
sized in favor of research.
