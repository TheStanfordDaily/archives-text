# Stanford in the Cold War years
## New book looks at history of corporate, federal funding 
### Carmel Levitan 
Rebecca Lowen's recent book.
"Creating the Cold War University:
The Transformation of Stanford,"
has sparked a debate over the histo
ry of Stanford's rise to prominence
during the 1
According to the book, which
began as Lowen's doctoral thesis in
history, private industry and govern
ment agencies dramatically shaped
the way in which Stanford devel
oped during the Cold War.
Lowen asserts that in this period,
the University became dependent
on federal and corporate support,
challenging typical conceptions of
the evolution of the modern re
search university.

In a forum hosted by Stanford
Today last spring, former University
President Richard Lyman, former
University Vice President Robert
Rosenzweig, Physics Prof. Emeritus
David Ritson and History Profs.
Barton Bernstein and Timothy
Lenoir discussed the book.
Some panelists suggested that
there was a missing dimension to
Lowen's work.
Rosenzweig told Stanford Today
that he thinks the book "tells part of
the Stanford story ... but she hasn't
really captured either Terman or his

accomplishments fully or fairly, in
part because she's used too narrow a
focus — the Cold War — to explain
too complex a subject."
Lyman suggested that Lowen's
text suffers from "inattention to as
pects of Stanford's development in
years she looked at that don't fit her
thesis."
But Bernstein, Lowen's former
thesis advisor, defended her work.
He told the magazine that many crit
ics have made her book "the target
of their feelings about that troubled
period" of the 19605. He said that
"ideally, they should use her book to
understand better the 30-year peri
od she examines and also to gain a
new perspective on the so-called
'time of troubles' that followed the
early 19605."
According to Lowen. she delib
erately ended her book before the
student upheavals of the 19605,
seeking to avoid taking sides on the
issue.
" The truth is that I decided to
limit the book to the period of the
Depression to the early 1960s be
cause I did not want either to write
about the upheavals on the campus
in the 19605, nor did I want to con
tend with people's very emotional
response, both pro and con. to that
period."
The book starts by examining the
era immediately following the De
pression and continues until the
early 19605, demonstrating the rela
tionship between Stanford's finan
cial situation and the research sup
ported by the University.
"In the beginning, I was mainly
trying to understand the history of
Stanford. Some of the rather limited
secondary literature on the post-
World War II history of universities
and the relationship between uni
versities and private industry and
the federal government had suggest
ed that funders of university-based
research pressured academic scien
tists to undertake work that was of
