# The 						European tour
## Striking a blow for columnists everywhere

Jim Tankersley

THE EDITOR IN chief is a good
friend of mine, dating back to my
freshman year when I wrote news
stories for him and he occasionally let me
borrow his old white Volvo to take my girl
friend to the movies. We've sat together in
church and sung "New York, New York"
at Daily banquets. He's a good guy —
intelligent, funny and most of all, under
standing.
, "Hey Jim," he said in his I'm-really
,tired-but-still-ha ve-a-chipper-British
accent voice when I called the office last
.week. "What can I do for you?"
"It's about my column next week," I
said.
; "I've been meaning to talk to you about
that," he said. "The folks at Stanford Mag
azine called yesterday. They asked you not
to mention them in any more stories.
Seems students are dropping by the office
all the time, thinking they're just giving
away free Scandinavian vacations or some
thing."
"Oh." I said. "No, that won't be a prob
lem. I'm not writing a column next week.
I'm going on strike."

"You are not going on any bloody
strike," he practically yelled. Like 1 said,
understanding.
"Listen. Adam, I have to go on strike.
Everyone in France goes on strike. It's like
a rite of passage. You wouldn't believe the
peer pressure."
"Peer pressure?"
"I'm trying to assimilate into the culture,
but I don't have a lot of time. I need some
thing big, something to really show that I fit
in. And there's no better way to do that
than to stop working for a little while. It's
the French wav."
"Huh?"
"Early this month, all the commuter
trains in Paris shut down to protest violence
against conductors. Some of the subway
lines followed suit a few days later. Last
week, high school students went on strike
for three days. High school students! They
don't even have jobs, and there they were,
out in the streets, striking, demanding
smaller class sizes."
"Look. Jim. I appreciate the gesture. It's
a nice idea. But you can't just go on strike
like that. The Daily needs your column.

We're counting on you to fill page five."
"Inconvenience isn't an issue here." I
said. "When the trains stopped, my friend
Oscar had to walk an hour and take the
subway for another hour just to get to
French class. Besides, you guys have
options. Run Dan Geyser twice, o. a big
house ad like Picket the Daily.' "
"Jim ..."
"You have to appreciate the power of
organized labor here. People stop working
and their problems get attention, fast.
These aren't pay disputes, either. They're
striking against attacks on helpless rail
workers, or low education funding. These
are serious social issues."
"But this isn't France. You can't just do
that here," he said.
"Exactly. When was the last time Stan
ford students walked out in protest of
something? Vietnam? Do you ever remem
ber students emptying the Ouad to march
for increased attention to undergraduate
education? For all the I'uss over graduate
housing last year, I don't ever remember a
day when work stopped in the physics
labs."

"Maybe you're right," he said. " That
wouldn't ever happen here. It's too expen
sive. Ain't no one here going to risk tailing
CS or losing time on a doetoral thesis for
some misplaced social statement. And even
if they did, no one would listen."
"That's what 1 thought, too, until 1 saw
teachers marching along with the high
school students, in support of their cause.
People here realize how interdependent
they are. Violence is a threat to everyone,
education builds a nation, all that great
stuff."
I heard a sigh from the other end of the
line, a long, weary gasp of resignation. I
knew he must be scratching his head and
reaching for a cigarette. "So you want Stan
ford students to walk, en masse down Palm
Drive, demanding more for their money, is
that it?"
"Not really," 1 said. "I'm not sure Stan
ford students are ready for that. I'm just
starting with me. One week, no column —
that's my social statement."
"Why you?" he asked. "Why are you
going on strike? What labor complaint
could you possiblv have? You tvpe on a

laptop and e-mail 8(X) words once a week."
He had me there. "Well," I said. " The
Daily Web page takes a really long time to
load over here. And I, um. can't find
peanut butter anywhere. Yeah. I write bet
ter with a peanut butter sandwich in my
stomach, you know?"
"Jaysus, Jim," he said. "And all this time
1 thought you were actually on to some
thing. You can't just strike over trivial
things like Web pages and sandwiches. If
you want your actions to count for some
thing, you have to save them for important
issues."
"But it's the principle!"
"Sorry," he interrupted. "I'm expecting
a column next week, no excuses."
"Maybe," 1 said, weakly. "But could you
at least try to send me a jar of Skippy?"
"I'll see what I can do."
Like I said, understanding.
