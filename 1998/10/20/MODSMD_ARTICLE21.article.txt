■ Yesterday: Stanford's Ryan Wolters lost to
James Blake of Harvard. 7-6. 6-4. in the semifinals
of the ITA All-American Championships.

Though the eventual singles champion was
No. 2 seed James Blake from Harvard. Stanford
made sure its presence would be felt. Cardinal se
nior captain Ryan Wolters reached the semifinals
before losing to Blake, while sophomore Alex
Kim knocked out the tournament's No. 1 seed in
the third round with a close win. 7-6,7-6.
"Even though we didn't win. there were lots of
pluses," said assistant coach John Whitlinger. "1
was really happy with the way we played. We can
take something away from this tournament and
feel good about it."

Wolters was going for his second ITA All-
American Championship of his career. Winning
the singles title during his freshman year, Wolters
had high hopes coming into the tournament. The
tournament's No. 4 seed, he flew through the first
three rounds without dropping a set.
"He had a couple of big matches earlier this
week." said head coach Dick Gould. "He blew
some big guys out of the water."
Wolters, however, ran into some trouble in the
quarterfinals when he lost the first set of his match
against Jack Brasington of Texas, 3-6. He was able
to recover, though, and win the next two sets, 7-5
and 6-1. to advance to the semifinals.
Wolters' semifinal match against Blake was
also close and well played on both sides. The turn
ing point of the match came late in the first set,
with Wolters up 5-4 and serving for the set. Blake,
however, was able to break Wolters* serve.
According to Whitlinger, Wolters' only mis
take was that he didn't serve-and-volley enough.
"Ryan needed to keep the pressure on."
Whitlinger said. "It might have been different if
we could have closed out that set."
Another key match for Stanford in the tourna
ment was Kim's huge upset of the tournament's
top seed Daniel Andersson of Virginia Common
wealth. Andersson was ranked as the nation's No.

3 singles player in preseason polls.
"Alex was very patient." Whitlinger said. "We
had a game plan of where to serve and where to
put pressure. He did a great job."
Stanford junior Geoff Abrams also played well
despite losing a close match in the first round to
Justin O'Neal of Florida. After breaking O'Neal's
serve twice in the first set, Abrams was not able to
break serve again in the rest of the match. He had
a chance to change the outcome in the third set.
though, with O'Neal serving for the match.
Down 40-love, O'Neal was able to battle back
and win both the game and match. Abrams lost
the match 5-7.6-4.6-4.
"1 was a little disappointed losing as early as 1
did." Abrams said. "But as the tournament went
on, 1 got my confidence back."
Abrams ended up playing well the rest of the
tournament, making it to the semifinals of the
consolation bracket. He credited his success to a
more aggressive game plan that included using
the serve-and-volley more.
Abrams said that the tournament should not
only help Stanford's individual players, but also
help the team's confidence going into the season.
"Obviously, going into a tournament, you
want to win." he said. "But it was more like a step
ping stone for the season."
