# Rough start for crew teams
## 
### Justin Virgili 
Stanford's men's and women's varsity crew teams re
turned from Boston looking towards the future after dis
appointing performances in the Head of the Charles Re
gatta this past Sunday-
Stanford's men's team finished 27th out of a total 50
teams, and landed 14th place among collegiate teams.
The women's team struggled to a 36th place finish out of
59 teams overall and took the 25th place spot among col
lege teams.
"It's hard to be satisfied with that result even given
the short amount of time on the water," said Stanford
women's coach Aimee Baker.
"We need some more fitness and time on the water."
"We came up a little short. [I was) kind of expecting we
were going to be in the top 10." men's coach Wieslaw
Kudja added.
Stanford's lack of training time due to the quarter sys
tem seemed to be the biggest obstacle the teams faced.
"Three weeks definitely showed," added freshman
rower Catherine Pligavko. "We definitely need to work
more on technique."
The two teams experienced different fates as a result
of low starting positions. The women started 46th. but
benefited from starting between two competitive teams.
"[The starting place] wasn't an issue," Baker said.
"We were fighting with two.boats all the time."
The men's team, on the other hand, fared differently
after starting at the 38th position in the race.
"It was a little bit of a mistake because the crew that
was behind the team wasn't pushing us." Kudja said.

"We were in our own environment. It would have been
helpful to have other erews to chase or hold off."
Nevertheless, both the men's and women's teams had
stellar performances provided by their coxswains.
Men's coxswain Dan Matross and women's coxswain
Kipper York remained aggressive throughout the diffi
cult ( 'harles River course.
"Kipper was outstanding. She took charge and didn't
let anyone cut on the inside," Baker said.

MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CREW
â–  Sunday: Stanford's men's crew team finished 27th and
Stanford's women's team finished 36th at the Head of the
( harles Regatta.

"The cox did a line job. (He] outperformed his team
mates/' Kudja added.
The women's team, however, did have two nerve
racking moments in the arches of the Charles River
bridges as an aggressive Rutger's boat chased them.
"We managed to lit three boats under one arch," Pli
gavko said. "Our coxswain had some gutsy steering."
Rutgers surpassed the Stanford women after this
bridge, but York made it a tight race with more aggres
sive steering.
"At the last bridge, Rutgers swung wide and we were
able to make some distance by cutting inside on the
turn," York said.
Coming into this weekend's Head ol the American
Race. Baker and Kudja remain confident.
"The team is finally coming out of the woods," Kudja
said.
