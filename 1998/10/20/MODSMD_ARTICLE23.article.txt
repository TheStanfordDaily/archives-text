# Stanford to gauge progress as it continues packed week
## Cardinal to play Pacific 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
As if there weren't enough diffi
cult tests in the classroom.

Right smack in the middle of
midterms, the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team will have
an exam of another sort, as it trav
els to Pacific, tonight, to face the
lOth-ranked Tigers.
Along with the fact that Pacific
(15-3 overall) is a tough opponent,
the timing of the match is not very
good for Stanford (14-2, 9-0 Pacific
10 Conference). After returning
from Oregon on Sunday night,
tonight will mark the team's third
match in five days.
"I'm not real excited to be play
ing Pacific right now." said Stan
ford coach Don Shaw. "They are a
very good team and playing them
there is always difficult. The timing
of this game just happens to be bad
for us.
"We're coming off a long week
end. and have to be prepared for
two tough conference matches
against Arizona and Arizona State
at the end of the week. It will not be
easy — it's just a tough spot for us."
Poor timing aside, the fact re
mains that tonight's match is a rare
opportunity for the Cardinal to

gauge its progress and make a
statement against a highly ranked
opponent.
After tonight's game, only one
currently ranked team remains on
Stanford's regular season sched
ule.

affeet the national rankings. Shaw
is more focused on his team's im
provement and standing in the PaC
-10.
"This is definitely a good test for
us right now," Shaw said. "But as
far as moving up in the rankings;
none of that means anything. They
will he a good measuring stick for
us as a team, hut that is as far as it
goes."

tonight, it will need to solve the
blocking problems that led to an
avalanche of kills from Oregon's
outside hitters on Sunday.
The Ducks baffled Stanford
blockers and ended with 54 kills, in
cluding 17 from Monique Tobaggi
and 16 from Madeline Ernst.
"We took a real step back in
some basic areas," Shaw said. "Our
defensive performance against
Oregon, particularly in the second
half of the match, was unaccept
able. There were a lot of reasons for
the lapse. After beating them 15-1
in the second game and taking a big
lead early in the third, we went
dead psychologically and let their
hitters put up some big numbers.
"Another part of it is that we
have so many freshmen out there.
They just don't have certain tools
yet, so opposing offenses can he

confusing at times."
On the whole, however, the
Stanford freshmen have done a
tremendous job stepping into pri
mary roles and forming a core of
the Cardinal lineup.
They have done so well, in fact,
that they have given Shaw the abil
ity to alter his lineup to make up for
the injury to junior outside hitter
Jaimi Gregory.

'Being two games up in
the conference with nine
to go, we have a
tremendous opportunity to
win the title.
— head coach Don Shaw

In the second half of the Oregon
match, freshman Sara Sandrik
moved to the outside hitter slot to
make room for classmate Tara

Conrad at one middle blocker posi
tion, and joined fellow first-year
hitter Michelle Chambers in a line
up that was extremely effective.
Regardless of the outcome of
tonight's match, however, Shaw is
focused on the fact that his team
has a chance for its fifth consecu
tive conference title.
"Being two games up in the con
ference with nine to go. we have a
tremendous opportunity to win the
title." Shaw said.
"We are nearing the stretch run.
and tonight's match will be a good
gauge to see where we stand in the
nation," he added. Hut I am mostly
concerned with winning the Pae-I()
and earning a high seed in the tour
nament."
Alter all, midseason rankings
aren't the ones that concern Shaw.
"The current rankings are nice
to talk about, but they don't mean
that much. All we want to do is be
ranked number one in the final
poll."
