# Stanford to gauge progress as it continues packed week
## Cardinal to play Pacific 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
As if there weren't enough diffi
cult tests in the classroom.

Right smack in the middle of
midterms, the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team will have
an exam of another sort, as it trav
els to Pacific, tonight, to face the
lOth-ranked Tigers.
Along with the fact that Pacific
(15-3 overall) is a tough opponent,
the timing of the match is not very
good for Stanford (14-2, 9-0 Pacific
10 Conference). After returning
from Oregon on Sunday night,
tonight will mark the team's third
match in five days.
"I'm not real excited to be play
ing Pacific right now." said Stan
ford coach Don Shaw. "They are a
very good team and playing them
there is always difficult. The timing
of this game just happens to be bad
for us.
"We're coming off a long week
end. and have to be prepared for
two tough conference matches
against Arizona and Arizona State
at the end of the week. It will not be
easy — it's just a tough spot for us."
Poor timing aside, the fact re
mains that tonight's match is a rare
opportunity for the Cardinal to

gauge its progress and make a
statement against a highly ranked
opponent.
After tonight's game, only one
currently ranked team remains on
Stanford's regular season sched
ule.

overall, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference] at
No. 10 Pacific (15-3 overall). 7 p.m.

Although the game figures to
affeet the national rankings. Shaw
is more focused on his team's im
provement and standing in the PaC
-10.
"This is definitely a good test for
us right now," Shaw said. "But as
far as moving up in the rankings;
none of that means anything. They
will he a good measuring stick for
us as a team, hut that is as far as it
goes."
