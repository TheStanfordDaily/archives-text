# Just a bit outside
## Opening your eyes 
### 
Brian Eule

I've never met her, and yet. I al
ready understand what every
one is talking about.
Every now and then, some
body comes along, opens your
eyes and reminds you the differ
ence that one person can make.
It caught me off guard.
I played the message off the an
swering machine multiple times,
wondering if my roommates were
playing a prank on me or if, in fact,
Jamila Wideman had really called.

Actually, it was a bit ironic. The
former Stanford women's basket
ball star, who had been selected
third in the inaugural WNBA
draft by the Los Angeles Sparks
several years ago, had actually
been on my mind recently. I had
just received a press release an
nouncing that USA Weekend
Magazine had selected Wideman
to receive its annual ' Most Caring
Athlete" award.
I didn't know there was such an
award.

But 1 know why she won it.
Wideman called to talk about
the "Shoot for the Stars" program,
and its involvement with the Stan
ford's women's basketball team.
For 16 Sundays throughout the
academic year, approximately 24
young girls ranging in age from 12
to 14 years, come to Stanford from
East Palo Alto, to spend the day
on campus with the Cardinal hoop
stars.
Every two weeks, their activi
ties revolve around a different
theme, with the goal that the chil
dren will set their sights on going
to college and. one day. fulfill that
dream.
This week's theme was the
power of words.
This week's activity — the
Stanford Daily.
As the young girls, all basket
ball players themselves, filtered
into our newsroom, a smile came
to my face. It was little wonder
that Wideman agreed to coordi
nate the program. The kids were
energetic and eager, despite hav
ing had a long Sunday already.
And it was little wonder, as
well, that Wideman was able to
get so many of Stanford's present
day basketball players involved.
"Jamila is a deep person."
Stanford head coach Tara Van-


Brian
Eule
Derveer said of the point guard
during Wideman's senior year.
"She's someone who understands
the big picture. She's someone who
genuinely cares about people.
She's someone people trust and
have confidence in. She says. "Let's
go,' and they go."
When Wideman called and
asked me to meet the kids, there
was no questioning it. I went.
She has the ability to reach peo
ple. young and old. and it appears
that Wideman uses this, and just
about every moment of her free
time, for such charitable causes.
In 1997, she founded a program,
in conjunction with Nike's P.L.A.Y..
called "Hoopin' with Jamila."
"1 didn't name it," she laughed.
In the program. Wideman had a
series of one-day events, combin
ing clinics for basketball skills with

a reading program. It was designed
to teach inner-citv youths to use
basketball and poetry to deal with
frustration, in the place of violence.
Who said there aren't any role
models in sports today?
While I'm not sure if my fellow
editors appreciated Sunday's
ruckus, as the children streamed
into the Daily's newsroom, I did. I
loved seeing the kids stare up at ju
nior point guard Mlena Flores in
awe. 1 was thrilled to hear them at
tempt to interview senior forward
Regan Freuen and bring me the
quotes. And 1 was touched that I
could be a part of it.
There was little question that al
ready, in but a few short weeks, the
children had grown attach to Stan
ford's basketball players. They
yanked on them, they ran to them,
and when Flores walked out of the
Daily with the kids by her side, they
all sang "Happy Birthday" to the
newly turned-21 -year-old.
With this program. Stanford is

making a big difference in each and
every one of these kid's lives. The
program and the Stanford basket
ball players are giving these chil
dren opportunities that are rare tor
anyone and allowing them to dis
cover their passions.
As the children exited the
Storke Publications Building, 1 no
ticed that Wideman had not been
with them. While the kids certainly
were more than fine with the pre
sent-day members of Stanford's
team. 1 couldn't help but wonder
where Wideman was.
She was only spending part of
the day with group. 1 was told.
As for the rest of the day? Wide
man was in the city helping raise
money for breast cancer.
The difference one person can
make is astonishing.

Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly columns run on Tuesdays,
hopes some of those children will
write for him someday.
