# Just a bit outside
## Opening your eyes

I've never met her, and yet. I al
ready understand what every
one is talking about.
Every now and then, some
body comes along, opens your
eyes and reminds you the differ
ence that one person can make.
It caught me off guard.
I played the message off the an
swering machine multiple times,
wondering if my roommates were
playing a prank on me or if, in fact,
Jamila Wideman had really called.

Actually, it was a bit ironic. The
former Stanford women's basket
ball star, who had been selected
third in the inaugural WNBA
draft by the Los Angeles Sparks
several years ago, had actually
been on my mind recently. I had
just received a press release an
nouncing that USA Weekend
Magazine had selected Wideman
to receive its annual ' Most Caring
Athlete" award.
I didn't know there was such an
award.

But 1 know why she won it.
Wideman called to talk about
the "Shoot for the Stars" program,
and its involvement with the Stan
ford's women's basketball team.
For 16 Sundays throughout the
academic year, approximately 24
young girls ranging in age from 12
to 14 years, come to Stanford from
East Palo Alto, to spend the day
on campus with the Cardinal hoop
stars.
Every two weeks, their activi
ties revolve around a different
theme, with the goal that the chil
dren will set their sights on going
to college and. one day. fulfill that
dream.
This week's theme was the
power of words.
This week's activity â€” the
Stanford Daily.
As the young girls, all basket
ball players themselves, filtered
into our newsroom, a smile came
to my face. It was little wonder
that Wideman agreed to coordi
nate the program. The kids were
energetic and eager, despite hav
ing had a long Sunday already.
And it was little wonder, as
well, that Wideman was able to
get so many of Stanford's present
day basketball players involved.
"Jamila is a deep person."
