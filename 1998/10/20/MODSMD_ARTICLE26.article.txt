# Teaching good body image

Reborn with a wider focus as a
student group to spread awareness
of various self-image issues. Body
Image, Fotni and Self-Esteem em
barks on a fresh year with new plans.
"We've found that just sitting
down and talking about these issues
are non-productive, and even dan
gerous," said group co-president
Amy Wertheimer, a senior. "We've
shifted to more positive activities
that people will enjoy."
The group now addresses a vari
ety of body-image issues, not simply
eating disorders, its traditional focus.
"This issue is really serious," said
Wertheimer. "It's something to be
dealt with, not something to be ig
nored."
Treasurer Antonia Welch, a ju
nior, said. "An eating disorder is not
something you really recover from;
you may gain back the weiuht, but

the problems are with you for the
rest of your life."
Whereas the organization was a
weekly support group last year, this
year it is more pro-active, planning
new activities and working with the
University and Cowell Student
Health Center to institute policies to
help students with body-image prob
lems.
Specific plans for BIFSE include
yoga sessions, art therapy, hiking,
workshops on building a better body
image, inviting speakers onto cam
pus, dorm panels and trips to muse
ums praising different body images.
These events, "acts of group
strength," according to Welch, are all
geared towards fostering a positive
sense of one's self.
The group offers resources for
those struggling with a body-image
problem, including Cowell's Coun
seling and Psychological Services
and off-campus professional coun

selors.
"We're not for psychological
treatment," said Welch, "hut if peo
ple just want to talk, on a personal
level, we share our stories and suc
cess, and suggestions. We listen and
encourage, and show people that
there is a community of students to
fight and recover from body-image
problems."
Stressing the gravity of body
image issues, Wertheimer said, "It's
depressing, what's going on. The rat
race on Campus Drive â€” there are
20 people running at any given time.
There is no reason for someone who
made it this far to look into the mir
ror and be unhappy."
According to Welch, body image
problems are "seen more often in
groups of overachievers. At Stan
ford, we see an environment of per
fection here, but it's not accurate.
We're here to say that it's OK to not
be perfect."
