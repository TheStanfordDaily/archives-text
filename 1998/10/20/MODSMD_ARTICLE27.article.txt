# Public service minor on track

Bureaucracy involves a lot of red
tape.
This is one of the lessons that the
students interested in creating a pub
lic service minor have learned. All fu
ture government employees take
note.
Last year, several seniors brain
stormed the idea of a public service
minor at Stanford. They wanted the
opportunity to integrate service
learning into a program with degree
granting authority.
After a year of effort, one public
service course is in the planning
stages for next year, according to
Jacqueline Schmidt-Posner, the stu
dent development coordinator at the
I laas ( enter for Public Service.
The course will provide the infra
structure for students interested in
public service as an academic disci
pline.
The path to secure this class began

when the students approached the
Office of Student Activities with the
idea for the minor. They were direct
ed to the 112 teas Center. Then, a facul
ty steering committee deliberated on
the proposal for a minor.
However, with no faculty advisors
in place and no established core cur
riculum. the steering committee was
forced to turn down the proposal.
"It would be like putting the cart
before the horse," said History Prof.
Al ('amarillo, chair of last year's fac
ulty steering committee. "With no
curriculum, there's no chance in the
world that a minor would happen."
The Haas Center has joined with
several faculty members, including
( amarillo and Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Luis Fraga, to forge con
nections between students and public
service and to develop the service
learning class.
("amarillo, who has taught service
learning courses through the I listorv
Department, believes that the

process of students initiating a minor
through a non-academic department
is unprecedented. "I don't think an
organization like the Haas Center
has ever proposed something like
this," he said.
The public service minor would
be interdisciplinary, and thus would
require the coordination of different
departments
Despite the extended time frame
it takes to implement this new pro
gram, faculty are committed.
"It is a process that the liaas Fac
ulty Steering Committee is taking se
riously, and the first step is develop
ment of this gateway service learning
class," stressed ( amarillo.
Some students are looking for
ward to the minor.
" There are probably a good num
ber of people at Stanford who are in
terested in the same thing," said Jes
sica Stanton, a junior majoring in sci
ence, technology and society, who is
considering a career in public service.
