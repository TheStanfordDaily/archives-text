University President Gerhard Casper is not the
highest-paid official at Stanford, according to a sur
vey reported in the current edition of the Chronicle of
Higher Education.
That title goes to Laurance Hoagland, chief exec
utive officer of Stanford Management Company, who
manages the investment policy of the University's
$4.5-billion endowment fund.
Casper's salary, including benefits, was reported at
$397,995 — placing his salary 10th overall among the
nation's university presidents.
University of Pennsylvania President Judith S.
Rodin earned the most of any university president at
$498,536. Former UC-Berkeley chancellor Chang-
Lin Tien earned a total of $236,700 in pay and bene
fits.
Among Stanford's top-paid executives, Casper
ranked sixth.
Hoagland earned more than $900,000 in salary and
benefits according to the survey, which compared
1996-97 salaries'at 475 private colleges and universi
ties.
The survey was based on information gathered on
Form 990, and filed annually with
the Internal Revenue Service.
Form 990 is the best measure
available of compensation paid to
employees of private institutions,
according to the Chronicle of High
er Education.
As is commonly the case with
universities that have affiliated hos
pitals, top salaries go to academic
physicians whose teaching salaries
are combined with substantially
larger patient fees.
Survey results showed that three
faculty members at the Medical
School had earnings in the $500,000
range, not including benefits. They
were Bruce Reitz, professor of car
diothoracic surgery and depart
mental chair at $583,758; Gary
Steinberg, Neurosurgery Depart
ment head and professor at
$558,371; Carlos Esquivel. profes

sor of surgery al $520,852.
Pathology Prof. David Korn
earned $743,600 in 1996-97, but this
included a one-time retirement
payment in the amount of $497,000.

Tm not saying any
particular person isn't
worth it, but this is a trend
we ought to watch
carefully.'
— Patric Callan

The Athletics Department de
clined to speak to the Daily about
coaches' salaries.
In an article accompanying the
Chronicle of Higher Education's
survey results. Patric Callan of the
California Higher Education Policy
Center expressed concern about
the growing incomes of top univer
sity executives.
"I'm not saying any particular

person isn't worth it. but this is a
trend we ought to watch carefully,"
Callan said.
In his view, private institutions
are to blame for the continuing in
flation of their top people's earn
ings.
"These kinds of escalations start
with the privates." said Callan.
"Then the publics that have pri
vates on their list of peer institu
tions ratchet theirs up."
Kossi Sama, a first year graduate
student in Civil and Environmental
Engineering, questioned
Hoagland's income.
"His position is very important
because he manages our funds,"
said Sama. "Hut 1 don't know
whether that means he should make
more money than everybody else."
Other students agreed.
"1 had read about the
Hoagland's salary on the weekend,
and 1 was surprised." said sopho
more Noeen Anwar. "1 thought it
was quite high."
