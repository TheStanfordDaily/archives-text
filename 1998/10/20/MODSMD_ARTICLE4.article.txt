### Tyrone Prather 
While college tuition and fees nationwide for 1998-99
are up about 4 percent over last year, Stanford's annual
increase is slightly below the U.S. average, according to
a report released Oct. 7 by the College Board.
Stanford's tuition increase for 1998-99 was its small
est in three decades. Tuition, room and board for un
dergraduates this year is $29,879, an increase of 3.5 per
cent.
The University's Vice Provost for Budget, Tim
Warner, said this year's increase was in line with private
institutions across the country, and that the rise in tu
ition and fees had shown little impact on enrollment.
According to the College Board's Annual Survey of
Colleges, the average annual cost of all four-year insti
tutions in the United States is $14,508, with the average
annual cost for four-year public institutions at $3,243.
The board reported that the average annual cost of
tuition, room and board at a four-year private institu
tion for this school year is $22,533. Students attending
these institutions saw their average cost increase rough
ly 3 percent, slightly lower than Stanford's 1998-99 fig
ure.
However, Stanford's rise in tuition and fees is lower
than most of the select private insti
tutions belonging to the ("onsortium
on Financing Higher Education,
which show an average increase of
about 3.8 percent.
Meanwhile, the University of
California system has lowered its tu
ition and fees for the 1998-99 school
year by about 5 percent, according
to the Los Angeles Times.
At a press conference in Wash
ington, DC. marking the release of
the study, Donald Stewart, the pres

ident of the College Board, called on
the federal government, schools and
families to work together to help
stem the rise in college costs.
"We must encourage colleges to
do even more to hold the line on ris
ing prices, even as we encourage
families to plan ahead," said Stew
art. "Simply put. it is in everyone's
interest —the wider society, the col
leges, families and individual stu
dents — that a college education re
main accessible and affordable."
Stewart also cautioned students
and families to put tuition costs in
context and to beware of miscalcula
tion and overestimation of the cost

of college.
Stewart said that the majority of
full-time undergraduate students
pay far less than the average, and
that a record amount of more than
$60 billion in financial aid was avail
able to students last year.
"The price of attending college is
only one side of the coin, as it were,"
Stewart said.
"For a number of years I have
said that a college education is ac
cessible for most Americans at a
range of institutions. That is still true
today. Yet, I am fully aware that for
many Americans, financing higher
education is a daunting task."
