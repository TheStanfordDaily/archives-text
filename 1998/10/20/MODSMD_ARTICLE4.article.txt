While college tuition and fees nationwide for 1998-99
are up about 4 percent over last year, Stanford's annual
increase is slightly below the U.S. average, according to
a report released Oct. 7 by the College Board.
Stanford's tuition increase for 1998-99 was its small
est in three decades. Tuition, room and board for un
dergraduates this year is $29,879, an increase of 3.5 per
cent.
The University's Vice Provost for Budget, Tim
Warner, said this year's increase was in line with private
institutions across the country, and that the rise in tu
ition and fees had shown little impact on enrollment.
According to the College Board's Annual Survey of
Colleges, the average annual cost of all four-year insti
tutions in the United States is $14,508, with the average
annual cost for four-year public institutions at $3,243.
The board reported that the average annual cost of
tuition, room and board at a four-year private institu
tion for this school year is $22,533. Students attending
these institutions saw their average cost increase rough
ly 3 percent, slightly lower than Stanford's 1998-99 fig
ure.
