Next month,
the Center for
Primary Care
and Outcomes

Research will officially open in
Encina Commons. Dean of the
Medical School Eugene Bauer and
Medicine Department chair Judith
Swain announced its formation last
month.
The multidisciplinary center,
which has been operating on an ad
hoc basis for the past year, studies
the current status of health care and
coordinates research on health
practices and primary care. Faculty
and students from different depart

mcnts in the Medical School and
University have joined together to
work on its projects.
The center was formerly known
as the Center for Evaluation of
Health Practices and Advancement
of Primary Care.
The University is also establish
ing a related center, the Center for
Health Policy, which will share the
Center for Primary Care's facilities
and faculty.
"Two centers give us the unique
opportunity to draw together from
different areas of the University,"
said Assoc. Medicine Prof. Alan
Garber, who will head both centers.
Garber stressed the benefits of
the multidisciplinary perspective to

health carc research.
"The Center for Primary Care
and Outcomes Research was orga
nized to promote research and de
signed to improve health care prac
tices," said Garber.
The center will focus its research
on four main goals: advancement of
primary care practice, development
of practice guidelines, outcomes re
search and medical technology as
sessment.
The University approved the
center two years ago. The center
has hired faculty and staff, em
barked on initial projects and de
veloped educational guidelines.
"We've accomplished more than
one would think possible," said

Garber, "given that we have had no
place to set up shop."
The Medical School will provide
basic funding for the center, but
other resources, such as the Laugh
lin Fund, an endowment given to
the University to support the im
provement of the quality of prima
ry care, will also donate funding.
Outside grants will also provide ad
ditional financial support.
With a new rise in managed care,
hospitals in the Bay Area have been
forced to adopt aggressive cost-cut
ting strategies. These cuts have led
to changing standards that health
care providers must follow in order
to function efficiently, according to
Garber.
