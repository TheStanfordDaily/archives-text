# The 						nightmare of Guatemala's past
## Anthropologist works to uncover 36 years of mass murders 
### Jennifer Kavanaugh 
Not many people who meet
Fernando Moscoso, a master's stu
dent in Latin American Studies,
will unearth his mission or the his
tory of a nation that he carries with
him.
In fact, nothing about the quiet
demeanor of the 36-year-old ar
chaeologist, forensic anthropolo
gist and human rights activist sug
gests his role in helping Guatemala
emerge from the nightmare of a 36-
year civil war that left 2(X),(MX) civil
ians dead.
Much like the archaeological
sites he visits, Moscoso quietly re
veals his story, layer by layer, of a
nation torn apart by violence and
deception, and a man's attempts to
put the fragments back together.
"I study the dead for the living,"
Moscoso said of his attempts to un
cover Guatemala's buried past.
From 1992 until 1998, when he
entered Stanford's Center for
Latin American Studies, Moscoso
and the team he founded, the
Guatemalan Forensic Anthropol
ogy Foundation, uncovered 37
mass graves and 3,(KK) bodies of
men, women, and children. The
team, now an authority on ex
humations, has trained similar
teams in Bosnia, Rwanda, and
other scenes of human rights abus
es.

"We arc trying to create the
crime scene in the same way we are
trying to recreate the cultural
thing, the past," Moscoso said. "In
forensic anthropology, we are try
ing to imagine the crime. Later in
the laboratory, we try to recon
struct the process of death, torture,
broken bones, how people were
killed."

Guatemala has needed
Moscoso's expertise. In 1954, a
CIA-instigated coup unseated the
nation's democratically elected
president and replaced him with a
military leader. Rebel groups
emerged, and six years later, the
country erupted in a civil war that
lasted until 1996. Adopting a
scorched-earth policy, military-led

death squads tore through remote
Indian villages, leaving little be
hind.
For years, the population of
Guatemala City, primarily com
prised of Spanish speakers, knew
little of the violence in the moun
tains. Several barriers separated

the city from the terror: a weak
communication system, the more
than 20 languages spoken by the
largely indigenous victims and fear
of retaliation for telling the truth.
For the first time, the exhuma
tions performed by Moscoso and
others gave the country what it
didn't have before: proof of what
happened.
Now Moscoso, as a Fulbright
Scholar and MacArthur-Ford-
Hewlett fellow, shares his experi
ences with classmates. When asked
why he needs a degree in Latin
American studies, Moscoso said he
wants to combine theory with what
he has seen and heard.
"I worked all this time to change
things in my country, but I am an ar
chaeologist," he said. "I am not an
economist. My knowledge is not
theoretical. It is from experience."
\ very special place
Moscoso was born in 1962, two
years after the war began. The
youngest of live children. Moscoso
grew up in Guatemala City, away
from the center of the conflict. At
the University of San Carlos, he
studied civil engineering before
turning to archaeology.
According to Moscoso, Guate
mala is a natural setting for excur
sions into the past.
"My country is a big archaeolog
ical site. I Everywhere you dig a hole,
you find something," he said.
Alter excavating Mayan ruins
for the government, Moscoso
began collaborating with U.S. ar
chaeologists. It was in 1991, while
working with Vanderbilt Universi
ty, that Moscoso first encountered
Guatemala's recent past.
Moscoso's team had been travel
ing to a site near Dos Pilas - which
means "two natural pools." The
team couldn't get to the site, largely
because of the crocodiles that pa
trolled the area. While the archae
ologists were devising an alternate

route, some workers suggested an
other destination.
"The workers told us they want
ed to show us a very special place,"
Moscoso said.
The workers took Moscoso and
the other archaeologists to a 15-
foot crevice. Moscoso and the three
other archaeologists climbed into
the hole, while the workers peered
over the edge. There the archaeolo
gists made a grim discovery.
"We realized that the ground
was filled with human bones,"
Moscoso said.
But they weren't the bones of
the ancient Mayan civilization
Moscoso had been seeking. "We
saw Indian clothes - they are very
easy to identify, very colorful," he
said, along with men's wallets and
other unmistakable signs of mod
ern life.
"We wanted to know who had
done this to them," he said. "We
asked the workers what happened
and who did it. Of course, they
didn't answer any of our questions
because of fear."
A year later. Moscoso accepted
a friend's invitation to join one of
Guatemala's first exhumations.
Recalling the past
Moscoso went to work in the
summer of 1992. "It was July 28,
1992 - 1 still remember that date,"
he said.
Moscoso realized it would be
hard to forget anything about the
work. At first, he said, he dreamt
about the bodies he found. Like
any professional who deals with
human tragedy, he had to develop a
scientific detachment toward the
work.
"1 began to look at the skeletons
like archaeological artifacts," he
said, adding, "it is impossible to
completely separate the archaeo
logical artifact and the human ele
ment. It is very terrible to imagine
how the bone was broken and the
pain that was caused to the victim."
Even more disturbing was en
countering the war's youngest vic
tims. "I couldn't |be detached]

when it was children," he said,
adding that he often found toys
buried with their owners.
Moscoso recalled finding a site
where 350 victims — mostly women
and children — were buried. Ac
cording to Moscoso, the children
were taken to the village's medical
clinic, where they were shot and
burned. The clinic stood near a
school, and Moscoso said he kept
thinking about the sounds children
make while playing in the school
yard.
"I couldn't help but imagine the
sound of the children during the
massacre," he said.
But Moscoso didn't just deal
with the dead — he had to console
the living. When the team ex
humed, survivors and relatives
would watch them work. Most of
these witnesses were Indian, per
forming elaborate rituals for the
dead. Many cried.
"People would talk about their
experiences, and we have to hear,
and to take notes," he said. "It was
like watching a movie."
A relentless quest
In the early 19905, few people in
Guatemala City could or wanted to
see what was happening in the rural
areas. Moscoso said members of his
own family refused to believe that
massacres occurred, even as he was
digging up victims' remains.
Moscoso said the government
worked hard to conceal the work of
the death squads.
"Many people didn't believe
that because the government has a
policy of very strong distortion of
reality," Moscoso said.
But as the team forged ahead,
Moscoso said, the media slowly
began to report on the killings.
Team members visited foreign con
ferences and universities to discuss
their findings. And in 1995, the
team published a book about their
discoveries.
But the publicity wasn't enough
to move the team's evidence
through Guatemala's courts.
Moscoso then raised money to con

duct training sessions for prosecu
tors, educating them about forensic
anthropology.
Victoria Sanford, a Stanford
doctoral student in anthropology
who has worked with Moscoso, said
he never loses sight of his goal.
"When it comes to defending the
rights of people in villages, he is re
lentless," she said.
Time to reflect
Moscoso and Sanford met in
1994, when Sanford joined an ex
humation.
Moscoso taught Sanford how to
exhume, and she invited him to
speak at Stanford, and later encour
aged him to apply as a graduate stu
dent.
"He's one of the best forensic
anthropologists in the world," San
ford said. "There's no doubt about
it."
"I thought it would be really
great for him to come to Stanford
and take all the experiences he has
had in the past five years and put
them together," Sanford said.
Terry Karl, the director of the
Center for Latin American Studies
and one of Moscoso's professors,
said Moscoso shares his experience
with a humble attitude.
"He thinks, 'isn't that what any
one else would have done?' " Karl
said. "But of course, not many peo
ple did."
Sanford expressed confidence in
Moscoso's future: "Fernando will
go back to Guatemala and do some
thing spectacular and wonderful
that no one has ever thought of."
Moscoso said he plans to return
to Guatemala after he receives his
degree.
He's preparing for"the next
stage of development" - which in
cludes educating citizens about de
mocratization and establishing a
Guatemalan peace museum mod
eled on the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C.
Moscoso expressed optimism
about his country's future: "I have
faith that things will get better, little
by little."

lasted until 1996. Adopting a
scorched-earth policy, military-led

death squads tore through remote
Indian villages, leaving little be

the city from the terror: a weak
communication system, the more
than 20 languages spoken by the
largely indigenous victims and fear
of retaliation for telling the truth.
For the first time, the exhuma
tions performed by Moscoso and
others gave the country what it
didn't have before: proof of what
happened.
Now Moscoso, as a Fulbright
Scholar and MacArthur-Ford-
Hewlett fellow, shares his experi
ences with classmates. When asked
why he needs a degree in Latin
American studies, Moscoso said he
wants to combine theory with what
he has seen and heard.
"I worked all this time to change
things in my country, but I am an ar
chaeologist," he said. "I am not an
economist. My knowledge is not
theoretical. It is from experience."
\ very special place
Moscoso was born in 1962, two
years after the war began. The
youngest of live children. Moscoso
grew up in Guatemala City, away
from the center of the conflict. At
the University of San Carlos, he
studied civil engineering before
turning to archaeology.
According to Moscoso, Guate
mala is a natural setting for excur
sions into the past.
"My country is a big archaeolog
ical site. I Everywhere you dig a hole,
you find something," he said.
Alter excavating Mayan ruins
for the government, Moscoso
began collaborating with U.S. ar
chaeologists. It was in 1991, while
working with Vanderbilt Universi
ty, that Moscoso first encountered
Guatemala's recent past.
Moscoso's team had been travel
ing to a site near Dos Pilas - which
means "two natural pools." The
team couldn't get to the site, largely
because of the crocodiles that pa
trolled the area. While the archae
ologists were devising an alternate

route, some workers suggested an
other destination.
"The workers told us they want
ed to show us a very special place,"
Moscoso said.
The workers took Moscoso and
the other archaeologists to a 15-
foot crevice. Moscoso and the three
other archaeologists climbed into
the hole, while the workers peered
over the edge. There the archaeolo
gists made a grim discovery.
"We realized that the ground
was filled with human bones,"
Moscoso said.
But they weren't the bones of
the ancient Mayan civilization
Moscoso had been seeking. "We
saw Indian clothes - they are very
easy to identify, very colorful," he
said, along with men's wallets and
other unmistakable signs of mod
ern life.
"We wanted to know who had
done this to them," he said. "We
asked the workers what happened
and who did it. Of course, they
didn't answer any of our questions
because of fear."
A year later. Moscoso accepted
a friend's invitation to join one of
Guatemala's first exhumations.
Recalling the past
Moscoso went to work in the
summer of 1992. "It was July 28,
1992 - 1 still remember that date,"
he said.
Moscoso realized it would be
hard to forget anything about the
work. At first, he said, he dreamt
about the bodies he found. Like
any professional who deals with
human tragedy, he had to develop a
scientific detachment toward the
work.
"1 began to look at the skeletons
like archaeological artifacts," he
said, adding, "it is impossible to
completely separate the archaeo
logical artifact and the human ele
ment. It is very terrible to imagine
how the bone was broken and the
pain that was caused to the victim."
Even more disturbing was en
countering the war's youngest vic
tims. "I couldn't |be detached]

when it was children," he said,
adding that he often found toys
buried with their owners.
Moscoso recalled finding a site
where 350 victims — mostly women
and children — were buried. Ac
cording to Moscoso, the children
were taken to the village's medical
clinic, where they were shot and
burned. The clinic stood near a
school, and Moscoso said he kept
thinking about the sounds children
make while playing in the school
yard.
"I couldn't help but imagine the
sound of the children during the
massacre," he said.
But Moscoso didn't just deal
with the dead — he had to console
the living. When the team ex
humed, survivors and relatives
would watch them work. Most of
these witnesses were Indian, per
forming elaborate rituals for the
dead. Many cried.
"People would talk about their
experiences, and we have to hear,
and to take notes," he said. "It was
like watching a movie."
A relentless quest
In the early 19905, few people in
Guatemala City could or wanted to
see what was happening in the rural
areas. Moscoso said members of his
own family refused to believe that
massacres occurred, even as he was
digging up victims' remains.
Moscoso said the government
worked hard to conceal the work of
the death squads.
"Many people didn't believe
that because the government has a
policy of very strong distortion of
reality," Moscoso said.
But as the team forged ahead,
Moscoso said, the media slowly
began to report on the killings.
Team members visited foreign con
ferences and universities to discuss
their findings. And in 1995, the
team published a book about their
discoveries.
But the publicity wasn't enough
to move the team's evidence
through Guatemala's courts.
Moscoso then raised money to con

duct training sessions for prosecu
tors, educating them about forensic
anthropology.
Victoria Sanford, a Stanford
doctoral student in anthropology
who has worked with Moscoso, said
he never loses sight of his goal.
"When it comes to defending the
rights of people in villages, he is re
lentless," she said.
Time to reflect
Moscoso and Sanford met in
1994, when Sanford joined an ex
humation.
Moscoso taught Sanford how to
exhume, and she invited him to
speak at Stanford, and later encour
aged him to apply as a graduate stu
dent.
"He's one of the best forensic
anthropologists in the world," San
ford said. "There's no doubt about
it."
"I thought it would be really
great for him to come to Stanford
and take all the experiences he has
had in the past five years and put
them together," Sanford said.
Terry Karl, the director of the
Center for Latin American Studies
and one of Moscoso's professors,
said Moscoso shares his experience
with a humble attitude.
"He thinks, 'isn't that what any
one else would have done?' " Karl
said. "But of course, not many peo
ple did."
Sanford expressed confidence in
Moscoso's future: "Fernando will
go back to Guatemala and do some
thing spectacular and wonderful
that no one has ever thought of."
Moscoso said he plans to return
to Guatemala after he receives his
degree.
He's preparing for"the next
stage of development" - which in
cludes educating citizens about de
mocratization and establishing a
Guatemalan peace museum mod
eled on the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C.
Moscoso expressed optimism
about his country's future: "I have
faith that things will get better, little
by little."
Not many people who meet
Fernando Moscoso, a master's stu
dent in Latin American Studies,
will unearth his mission or the his
tory of a nation that he carries with
him.
In fact, nothing about the quiet
demeanor of the 36-year-old ar
chaeologist, forensic anthropolo
gist and human rights activist sug
gests his role in helping Guatemala
emerge from the nightmare of a 36-
year civil war that left 2(X),(MX) civil
ians dead.
Much like the archaeological
sites he visits, Moscoso quietly re
veals his story, layer by layer, of a
nation torn apart by violence and
deception, and a man's attempts to
put the fragments back together.
"I study the dead for the living,"
Moscoso said of his attempts to un
cover Guatemala's buried past.
From 1992 until 1998, when he
entered Stanford's Center for
Latin American Studies, Moscoso
and the team he founded, the
Guatemalan Forensic Anthropol
ogy Foundation, uncovered 37
mass graves and 3,(KK) bodies of
men, women, and children. The
team, now an authority on ex
humations, has trained similar
teams in Bosnia, Rwanda, and
other scenes of human rights abus
es.

"We arc trying to create the
crime scene in the same way we are
trying to recreate the cultural
thing, the past," Moscoso said. "In
forensic anthropology, we are try
ing to imagine the crime. Later in
the laboratory, we try to recon
struct the process of death, torture,
broken bones, how people were
killed."

Guatemala has needed
Moscoso's expertise. In 1954, a
CIA-instigated coup unseated the
nation's democratically elected
president and replaced him with a
military leader. Rebel groups
emerged, and six years later, the
country erupted in a civil war that
lasted until 1996. Adopting a
scorched-earth policy, military-led

death squads tore through remote
Indian villages, leaving little be
hind.

prised of Spanish speakers, knew
