# The
						nightmare of Guatemala's past

Not many people who meet
Fernando Moscoso, a master's stu
dent in Latin American Studies,
will unearth his mission or the his
tory of a nation that he carries with
him.
In fact, nothing about the quiet
demeanor of the 36-year-old ar
chaeologist, forensic anthropolo
gist and human rights activist sug
gests his role in helping Guatemala
emerge from the nightmare of a 36-
year civil war that left 2(X),(MX) civil
ians dead.
Much like the archaeological
sites he visits, Moscoso quietly re
veals his story, layer by layer, of a
nation torn apart by violence and
deception, and a man's attempts to
put the fragments back together.
"I study the dead for the living,"
Moscoso said of his attempts to un
cover Guatemala's buried past.
From 1992 until 1998, when he
entered Stanford's Center for
Latin American Studies, Moscoso
and the team he founded, the
Guatemalan Forensic Anthropol
ogy Foundation, uncovered 37
mass graves and 3,(KK) bodies of
men, women, and children. The
team, now an authority on ex
humations, has trained similar
teams in Bosnia, Rwanda, and
other scenes of human rights abus
es.

"We arc trying to create the
crime scene in the same way we are
trying to recreate the cultural
thing, the past," Moscoso said. "In
forensic anthropology, we are try
ing to imagine the crime. Later in
the laboratory, we try to recon
struct the process of death, torture,
broken bones, how people were
killed."

Guatemala has needed
Moscoso's expertise. In 1954, a
CIA-instigated coup unseated the
nation's democratically elected
president and replaced him with a
military leader. Rebel groups
emerged, and six years later, the
country erupted in a civil war that
lasted until 1996. Adopting a
scorched-earth policy, military-led

death squads tore through remote
Indian villages, leaving little be
hind.
For years, the population of
Guatemala City, primarily com
prised of Spanish speakers, knew
little of the violence in the moun
tains. Several barriers separated
