RECENTLY,
MORNINGSTAR CALLED
US CHEAP.
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
YOU GET A COMPLIMENT
LIKE THAT.
A I financial companies charge operating fees
and expenses —some more than others. Of
course, the lower the expenses you pay. the better.
That way, more ol your money goes where it
should— towards building a comfortable future.
We make low expenses a top priority.
As the largest retirement system in the
world'—u nonprofit company focused exclu
sively on the financial needs of the educational
and research communities — our expenses are
among the lowest in the insurance and mutual
fund industries.
In fact, TIAA-CREF's 0.31% average fund
expenses are less than half of the expense charges
of comparable funds. 1 It's why Morningstar —
one of the nation s leading sources of annuity and
mutual fund information — says, "At that level
[TIAA-CREFJ is cheaper than any other
[variable annuity] policy, and is even compet
itive with the cheapest mutual fund complexes,
though it offers far more benefits."'
"TIAA-CREF sets the standard in the
financial services industry."
Of course, expenses are only one factor to
consider when you make an investment decision.
Morningstar also noted our commitment to
"consumer education, service and "solid
investment performance." Because that can
make a difference in the long run, too.
At TIAA-CREF, we believe people would
like to spend more in retirement, not on their
retirement company. Today, over two million
people count on that approach to help them
build a comfortable and secure future. So
can you. To find out more, call us at
1 800 842-2776. We'd consider it a compliment.
