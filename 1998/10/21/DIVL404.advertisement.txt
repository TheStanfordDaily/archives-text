D. E. Shaw & Co., LP. is a global investment bank founded by a former Columbia
University professor. Over the past ten years, we've grown from a seven-person startup
with an initial investment of $28 million into about a dozen closely related entities with
over a thousand employees and aggregate capital of $1.7 billion. We've done so by coupling
our Wall Street expertise with a rigorously analytical approach, and by assembling an
extraordinary team of professionals with a broad range of backgrounds: from computer
science to philosophy, from finance to physics.
We're currently seeking to fill entry-level positions in a variety of areas, including
sales/trading, software development, quantitative analysis, and business development.
Successful candidates will demonstrate curiosity, drive, intellectual breadth, and the ability
to think both analytically and creatively. Our rapid growth creates unusual opportunities
for advancement, and we compensate exceptional people exceptionally well.

Thursday, October 22, in the Woodside Room of the Stanford Park Hotel.
