# Clinton signs drug, alcohol notification law
## Allows colleges to call parents 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
Students caught violating Stan
ford's drug and alcohol policies may
have to deal with a new set of conse
quences. now that new federal legis
lation permits the University to tell
their parents about such incidents.
On Oct. 7. a bill passed by Con
gress was signed by President ( lin
ton. giving universities the authority
to notify parents of a student's alco
hol and drug violations.
President Clinton signed the reau
thorization of the Higher Education
Act. a bill that primarily focuses on
the reduction of interest rates for fed
eral college loans but also contains a
measure on parental notification.
Previous federal law prohibited
universities from disclosing records
of students above KS years of age,
preventing schools from notifying

parents of a student's drug and alco
hol use. However, after a string of
five alcohol-related deaths last year
on Virginia campuses, the bill to dis
close the substance use of students
under 21 but over IS was recom
mended to Congress in July.
Ihe bill, signed within weeks of al
cohol-related deaths or severe in
juries at Rutgers, the I Jniversity of
Michigan and here at Stanford, could
greatly affect the alcohol and drug
policies of universities nationwide.
James Montoya, vice provost for
student affairs, did not specify how
the new legislation might directly af
fect Stanford policy.
According to Montoya. it is im
portant to maintain communication
with both parent and student, with
out sacrificing the student's indepen
dence.
"For the most part, Stanford stu
dents act responsibly, and we value
that students function as adults," he
said, "but the University has the re
sponsibility to be in touch with the
student's family with extreme situa
tions," he said.
As for the future, Montoya admits
that in light of the current issues,
Stanford's alcohol policy will need
"fine-tuning."
"1 do not see dramatic changes in
the future," Montoya said. "Instead,
it should be used as a catalyst for dis
cussion" between the University and
the ASSU.
According to Jane Camarillo,

head of the Office of Residential Ed
ucation, current Stanford policy on
alcohol and drugs is guided hy Cali
fornia state law and the Fundamental
Standard — an expectation that stu
dents act in ways that demonstrate re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others. How
ever, in terms of governing students,
Stanford regards them as adults.
Current Stanford policy does not
require that resident assistants or res
ident fellows enforce the alcohol pol
icy. All decisions regarding alcohol
enforcement are left to the Stanford
Police Department.
However, if a student violates the
law, he or she also violates the Fun
damental Standard, ostensibly giving
the University the power to notify
parents in all cases of violations.

Some students believe that if uni
versities have the power to notify par
ents of their alcohol use. one of the
most crucial aspects of college — in
dependence — will be invaded.
Advocates of the bill, however,
argue that many parents are unaware
of their children's alcohol or drug
abuse, and therefore can do nothing
to help them. In a statement to the
press. Sen. John Warner (K-Va.) stat
ed that personal freedom must some
times have exceptions.
Incidents of alcohol abuse "not
only jeopardize the health of the per
son who consumes too much alcohol,
but that individual in turn can do
harm to others. Why shouldn't a par
ent be brought in?"
Rep. Anna Eshoo. a Democrat
whose district includes Stanford,

agrees with this provision in the bill:
"This is a big issue in the country, and
this bill is a small, but could be a
rather important, step." she said.
Some students noted that not all
student-parent relationships are the
same. "It assumes the parents have
control over students" lives when a lot
of 18-year-olds have more indepen
dence." said junior Shannon Frank.
"It sets a standard for young people
to be under their parents' rules past
the age of IS."
Montova agreed that college is a
time of growth and independence,
but pointed out that the college years,
especially freshman year, are a time
of transition. "It is important we do
all that we can to help students devel
op a healthy standard of living." he
said.
