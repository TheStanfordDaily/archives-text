# Clinton signs drug, alcohol notification law
## Allows colleges to call parents 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
Students caught violating Stan
ford's drug and alcohol policies may
have to deal with a new set of conse
quences. now that new federal legis
lation permits the University to tell
their parents about such incidents.
On Oct. 7. a bill passed by Con
gress was signed by President ( lin
ton. giving universities the authority
to notify parents of a student's alco
hol and drug violations.
President Clinton signed the reau
thorization of the Higher Education
Act. a bill that primarily focuses on
the reduction of interest rates for fed
eral college loans but also contains a
measure on parental notification.
Previous federal law prohibited
universities from disclosing records
of students above KS years of age,
preventing schools from notifying

parents of a student's drug and alco
hol use. However, after a string of
five alcohol-related deaths last year
on Virginia campuses, the bill to dis
close the substance use of students
under 21 but over IS was recom
mended to Congress in July.
Ihe bill, signed within weeks of al
cohol-related deaths or severe in
juries at Rutgers, the I Jniversity of
Michigan and here at Stanford, could
greatly affect the alcohol and drug
policies of universities nationwide.
James Montoya, vice provost for
student affairs, did not specify how
the new legislation might directly af
fect Stanford policy.
According to Montoya. it is im
portant to maintain communication
with both parent and student, with
out sacrificing the student's indepen
dence.
