### 
QUEENSTOWN, Md. (AP) —
Under President Clinton's prod
ding. Israel and the Palestinians
neared a West Bank agreement
Tuesday that calls for the jailing of
suspected terrorists under CIA
supervision, two parties to the Mid
dle East talks said.
Clinton finalized the arrange
ment during dinner Monday with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, the sources said.
The suspects wanted in Israel
would not be extradited to Israel for
trial, as Israel initially demanded.
But the presence of the CIA to ver
ify punishment would be meted out
evidently satisfies Israel's concerns,
said the sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
With Jordan's King Hussein on
hand to help. Israel and the Pales
tinians began shaping the frame
work of a West Bank land-for
peace accord on the sixth day of
their summit talks.
The pace of negotiations picked
up. with Israel and the Palestinians
getting down to hard bargaining.
Clinton, in his fifth dav at a seclud-

Ed Maryland retreat, met for 45
minutes with Arafat and scheduled
a session later with Netanyahu.
Clinton had been briefed on his
arrival from Washington by Secre
tary of State Madeleine Albright.
He then conferred with Hussein,
who joined the talks at the adminis
tration's request.
"There is important work going
on here but significant gaps are still
there," White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said.
The sources, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said that while
several knotty issues remained.
Israel and the Palestinians had suc
ceeded in reaching a preliminary
understanding on several points.
These included a 12-week Israeli
pullback from a further 13 percent
of the West Bank, with the Pales
tinians responding with the confis
cation of illegally held weapons
from militant groups on territory
they already control and the jailing
of suspect terrorists.
Israel claims 17 suspects remain
free in Palestinian-held land and 13
serve in the Palestinian police force.
Initially, the Israeli negotiators

demanded their extradition for trial
in Israel, but is settling for trial and
punishment by Palestinian authori
ties.
The United States would assume
the role of verifying both the
weapons seizure and the jailings,
the sources told The Associated
Press.
CIA Director George Tenet has
played a behind-the-scene role in
the summit talks. He made several
trips to the Mideast to develop
intelligence cooperation between
Israel and Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
The Israeli pullback and the
Palestinian counterterrorism moves
would be carried out in parallel
phases\ A major sticking point
remained whether and when Israel
would carry out another pullback. It
has offered to withdraw from an
additional 1 percent.
A day after a grenade attack in
Israel, James P. Rubin, a State
Department spokesman, said the
two sides had shifted from postur
ing to "endgame" bargaining. "We
are past the atmospherics and down
to hard bargaining," he said.
