# Doctors fed up with HMOs
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — For years, doc
tors have complained about the heavy
hand HMOs have over their medical
practices.
Tired of bemoaning their fate and
unable to improve their position at the
negotiating table, doctors now seem
increasingly willing to take the ultimate
step: They're quitting.
In the past year, large groups of doc
tors in Colorado, Georgia and Florida
have defected from health plans, citing
low pay and too many administrative
hassles.
This month, more than 400 doctors in
North Texas are calling it quits with
Aetna-US Healthcare. It is believed to
be the largest mass exodus from one
HMO by a group of doctors.
As a result, patients must choose
another Aetna doctor if they want to
maintain insurance coverage.
"This clearly sends a message that
physicians are not willing to be bullied
around by the insurance company," said
Dr. Evan Bates, an ear. nose and throat
doctor and board member of Genesis
Physicians Practice Association, the Dal

las group which terminated its deal with
Aetna Oct. 10.
"We are not willing to have the insur
ance company become a dictator of how
care is delivered."
Another big Texas medical group —
the 150-physician Health Texas Net
work owned by Baylor University
Health System — has told Aetna it
intends to quit the plan on Dec. 31.
While the physician defections have
made headlines and disrupted patients,
so far they've vet to slow HMO from
adding new members in most markets.
That's because HMOs have found
enough doctors to replace those that
quit. And employers that hire the HMOs
to cover their workers largely have not
been deterred by physician complaints
or their defections, health experts say.
"These defections do not provide a
significant disruption to provide
irreparable damage to the HMO." said
Paul Shumway, a health care consultant
with Towers Perrin in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
By quitting, and making their displea
sure with the HMOs known publicly,

doctors have been able to expand nega
tive perception of the HMO industry, he
said.
In the case of the Genesis medical
group, the doctors said their main gripe
was that Aetna failed to give them
patient claims information to help the
group oversee its physicians. The group
was paid a capitated, or set fee. by
Aetna, so Genesis needed the informa
tion to learn which doctors were treating
patients appropriately and which doctors
might be overusing expensive tests or
high priced drugs.
Last summer, doctors also clashed
with Aetna in Florida, where the plan
was accused of using a "gag clause" that
forbid doctors from telling patients all
their treatment options. The doctors also
were perturbed at a contract language
that seemed to tell doctors to give their
patient medical records to the health
plan.
On Tuesday, Aetna said it had rewrit
ten its standard doctor contracts in plain
language to address past misunderstand
ings. Aetna said the new contracts
include additional "anti-gag" language.
