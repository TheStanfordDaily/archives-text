Gilligan's Island awarded
the American Icon Award
WASHINGTON (AP) —It was a
zany version of "Swiss Family Robinson:"
seven castaways on a deserted island,
forced to survive on nut and berry
casseroles while rescue bobbed in and out
of reach — over and over again.
For 34 years, television viewers have
sal right back and heard the tale, "the tale
of a fateful trip" that landed seven people
on the luxurious "Gilligan's Island."
The original actors who played the
crew and passengers of the ill-fated S.S.
Minnow were awarded the American
Icon Award Tuesday by Women in Film
and Video. The award was accepted by
the surviving "Gilligan's Island" actors:
Bob Denver (Gilligan).Tina Louise ((lin
ger). Russell Johnson (the professor), and
Dawn Wells (Mary Ann).
The four cast members of the campy
'60s show were reunited for the award
presentation Tuesday.
The half-hour show is considered a
classic example of American situation
comedies.
"It satisfies people's fantasies." John
son said, when asked in an interview
about the show's lasting popularity.
"Nobody really gets hurt. It reflects a time
of innocence in a way. and I think that's
very valuable today."

of women in the entertainment industry.

Severe floods leave thou
sands homeless in Texas
VICTORIA, Texas (AP) —Perched
on the roof of his home while the
Guadalupe River swirled menacingly
around him. Larry Crisp stepped without
hesitation into a nylon rope basket dan
gling from a helicopter.
Crisp was among scores of trapped res
idents rescued by helicopters and boats
Tuesday as rain-swollen waterways
spilled across southeastern Texas, carry
ing off homes, cattle and lives in the cof
fee-brown floodwaters.
The death toll in Texas is 20 since
weekend storms swamped 60 counties, or
nearly one-fourth of the state.
Up to 5,000 cattle, many without
brands to identify them, were roaming
free because of washed-away pens and
fences near San Antonio.
But much of the misery was flowing
downstream Tuesday. Nearly 2 feet of
rain around San Antonio sent torrents of
water toward farm towns and cities along
the Guadalupe and other rivers.
In Cuero, 90 miles southeast, three
quarters of the town of 7,(KK) was under
water after the Guadalupe crested at
49.7K feet, more than double its 20-foot
Hood stage. At least 2.(KK) people were
left homeless.
More than 20 miles downstream in
Victoria, a town of 60,(XX) people, locals
called it the worst flooding since 1936.
National Guardsmen flying over the
Guadalupe said the river was nearly four
miles wide at some points. It usually is 150
feet across.
