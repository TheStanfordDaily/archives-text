WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton named John Podesta as his chief of
staff Tuesday, replacing millionaire busi
nessman Erskine Bowles with an immi
grant's grandson with "a tough hide."
"Bowles, blue blood. Podesta, blue col
lar," Podesta joked. "I know what it means
to work for the minimum wage and to count
your raises in cents and not dollars .... That
is why I'm so profoundly grateful to the
president for giving me this chance to serve
our country in this hallowed place."
( linton said Podesta. a veteran go-to man
for the president's many investigative woes,
brings a number of assets to the chief of staff
post, the highest-ranking of Clinton's aides.
"He has a tough hide, a dry wit, a lot of
patience in dealing with the president," Clin
ton said. "He and his family have a taste for
riding roller coasters. That will certainly
serve him well here."
"You have chosen someone to lead the
team in the days ahead that I both admire
and respect," Bowles told Clinton. "1 could
not be leaving you in better hands, my
friend."
It had long been assumed that Podesta
would succeed Bowles, who is returning to
his home state of North Carolina to consider
a run for governor in 2(MX). Podesta will
assume his new duties in November.
Podesta was among the aides who accom
panied Bowles to Capitol Hill to negotiate
the fiscal 1999 budget agreement reached
last week with Congress. Podesta said they
made an odd team — he. blunt and scrappy,
Bowles, relaxed and erudite.
"No one ever got confused about which

one of us had a passion for golf and which
one of us had a passion for amusement
parks." Podesta joked.
But after Clinton proclaimed his budget
victory on the White House lawn and
walked away in a phalanx of aides, it was
Podesta who walked beside him. his arm
around the president's back.
"Working in the White House is as high
an honor as anyone involved in public ser
vice can achieve." Podesta said. "Working
here means a great deal to me. and so does
working for a president who makes every
day count when it comes to solving problems
for average people."
Podesta, a 49-year-old Chicago native, is
an ultra-connected operative described by
White House colleagues as a true "grown
up," a man who makes both Democrats and
Republicans comfortable, a straight-shooter
with a low threshold for nonsense.
"John's qualities are also his problem."
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
"There's nothing that happens in this build
ing that people don't want John's input on.
He's stretched very thin."
It is at those moments that Podesta's
"othei side" comes out — a mean, surly
presence his White House colleagues nick
named "Skippy."
Lockhart encountered Skippy once. "I
screwed something up." Lockhart said. "1
met Skippv. Then he went home."
Podesta is expected to continue in
Bowles' tradition by putting together a hard
working. low-profile White House staff to
help Clinton weather impeachment pro
ceedings.
