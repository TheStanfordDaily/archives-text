## Editorial Tolerance on campus 
### 
Change will come
through thoughts
and efforts of students

LAS T WEEK S HORRIFIC murder
ol Matthew Shepard proved what
many students already know: Col
lege campuses are not isolated beacons of
tolerance and harmony.
It may seem like Stanford, with its ethnic
organizations, theme dorms and communi
ty centers, is a more tolerant campus than
most. And while there is no way to prevent
individuals from carrying out acts of hate
against other individuals, the I Iniversity has
outlets available at the institutional and
community level to try to change hateful
attitudes or at least make it known that
such attitudes should not be acted upon.
The institutional level is where the Uni
versity has the best means to demonstrate
its own tolerance through management of
organizations.
Hiring a full-time director for the
I.CiBCC this year was a positive step,
although it diil take time and prodding Ironi
the community. Stanford's continued sup
port lor ethnic theme dorms shows the I Jni
versit\ is willing to devote resources to
allow students to develop communities.
And enforcing rules when hate acts do
occur, such as the legal penalties applied to
last year's gralliti at the Suites, shows that
such acts are unacceptable.
I lie I 'niversity has taken positive steps,
and we are grateful. Indeed, many of us
chose to conic here in part because we
knew Stanford tries to promote diversity
through institutional practices. We expect

the University to promote tolerance
through management.
The University also plays a large role in
determining community values. These val
ues have the power to deter or promote tol
erance by encouraging or discouraging
hateful speech and acts.
University policies help create an anti
hate climate by prohibiting sexual harass
ment and accepting gay. lesbian and trans
gender faculty. In the dormitories, Residen
tial Education acts as a link between the
University and the residences. Res Ed does
sponsor programs such as "Faces of the
Community," and RAs play a large role in
shaping the culture of all-freshmen dorms.
But elsewhere, community values are
determined more by residents themselves.
( learly, then, a large part of building tol
erance can result only from the efforts of
students themselves.
The things we say and do have conse
quences. But censoring yourself, your
friends or your neighbors is less productive
than encouraging discussion before some
one ever says something racist, sexist or
anti-gay.
We hope that the discussion spurred by
the vigil for Matthew Shepard last week will
continue into the residences this week.
Ask yourselves whether a student might
be brutally attacked here simply because of
his or her race, ethnicity or sexual orienta
tion. Ask yourselves whether you think
Stanford is doing enough to prevent such
acts from happening here. Don't wait for
Res Ed or your RAs to schedule a program
to discuss the issues.
We must do our part to create commu
nities that shun hate and promote toler
ance.
