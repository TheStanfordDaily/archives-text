## Optimizing the function of life 
### 
WE PERHAPS
can trace our
societal urge to
maximize productivity to a
single man: Frederick Tay
lor.
While notions of opti
mization already existed in

economics, Taylor realized these concepts
in human practice through his work in the
early part of this century. In one famous
experiment, by studying the hodv move
ments of a steel plant worker named
Schmidt, Taylor was able to quadruple the
worker's output by minimizing physical
movement, calculating ideal intervals
between rest periods and reducing
Schmidt's craft to a soulless sequence of
mechanical events.
Heralded as the premier industrial engi
neer and efficiency expert, Taylor was the
father of scientific management — a move
ment that quickly swept the nation — turn
ing a wise business strategy into an Ameri
can obsession. In present times, we yell at
fellow drivers who add 30 seconds to our
commute, and the idea of a siesta seems
lackadaisical to the American sensibility.
The principle of efficient living has become
our new moral imperative.
Of course, today we speak less about
wasted body movements, looking instead
towards more general features related to
productivity. Nowadays efficiency is mea
sured in terms of speed, size and cost. We
want everything to be faster, smaller and
cheaper.
Technology has undoubtedly raised the
standard of what we consider to be accept
able turnover rates and processing times.
The first innovations that come to mind are
the assembly line and the computer, but
everyone forgets about my favorite twenti
eth century invention, the microwave oven.
The advent of this household appliance
revolutionized cooking, and the frozen food

market has never been the same. Where
would the instant food industry be without
the microwave? The answer: Ramen and
Spaghetti-O's.
Thankfully we do have the microwave,
and we have progressed beyond the dehy
drated noodle — I don't know what I'd do
without my microwaveable burritos. ()l
course, in the years just preceding the boom
in frozen delectables, the selection ol
microwaveable options was limited, but the
futuristic aura of the appliance was enough
to motivate its frequent use; somehow, elec
tromagnetically irradiated water tasted
sweeter than conventionally heated water.
But there is a dark side to this technolog
ical advance. The same device that has made
the two-minute lasagna a reality is the source
of atrocities such as the soggy pizza and the
reheated fast-food Wurger. I can just imagine
that somewhere a scientist is solemnly pacing
about his lab. pulling his hair out and grum
bling, "I just wanted to boil water quickly —
I never meant for this to happen."
In contrast, Alan Turing, the inventor of
the computer, is peacefully enjoying the
information age from his grave. Integrated
circuits are getting faster and smaller, allow
ing us to perform complex calculations at
lightning speeds with a notebook-sized col
lection of voltage gates. Unfortunately,
while serious researchers use these
machines to track satellites and map
genomes, the rest of us waste our processor
power downloading pornography and ren
dering 3-1) graphics for games like "Doom
VII: Kicking Much Ass for No Apparent
Reason."
Nonetheless the pressure is on to make
even faster, smaller computers.
The newest idea is to use subatomic par
ticles, instead of silicon chips, to represent
states of a computer. Quantum computing
is the hip, cool trend in physics, and that
makes perfect sense: the quantum physicist
has always been the hip, cool guy with the

leather jacket and the shallow girlfriend.
The quantum computer is just around the
corner, he says, and soon it will be able to
perform complex calculations at light
speeds with an atom-sized collection of par
ticles. thereby making conventional cryp
tography and slow porn downloads obso
lete.
In spite of this exciting vision of things to
come, the practical critic voices some con
cern. "But is there a market for this prod
uct?" he asks. "Who will make it? Who will
buy it? What is the bottom line?"
These are all good questions, but some
times we forget the proper domain of "bot
tom line" analyses. In day-to-day life, peo
ple will talk about the "emotional invest
ments" they have made in friends and the
"net returns" they expect from them. We
are all familiar with this approach to rela
tionships. as well as the ridiculous rules that
accompany it. If the monthly net gain is neg
ative, then the friend owes an additional
emotional percentage based on the previ
ous month's affective balance; in common
parlance, this interest rate is known as the
"I'll make it up to you" index, and its value
remains at a fixed low percentage except
around birthdays and anniversaries.
At last we can see the dangerous pitfalls
of efficient living. By trying to quantify,
evaluate and then maximize our human
output, we have let the ineffable aspects of
our lives drop in priority. In our quest for
greater convenience and efficiency, we have
sacrificed the quality of our food, the quali
ty of our friendships and the overall quality
of our lives.
How can we avoid these pitfalls? I don't
know, but I'm going to go boil some water
the old-fashioned wav.

Eugene /'ark, a master's student in philoso
phy, suspects that Frederick Taylor would
not like Spaghetti-O's. "Why bother punch
ing holes in the pasta?" he would wonder.
