Screaming fire is the
criminal act
You know, after reading David Stein's
column yesterday, the gist I got was, " The
law should punish action, not thought, and
that hate-crime legislation is unnecessary."
While I might not agree with him, I
thought his arguments were well articulated
and straightforward, which is whv I find it
somewhat odd that Rev. Meier felt it neces
sary to rip David for defending absolute
free speech. Phis, as far as I could tell,
wasn't David's aim at all.
Meier continues to posit a hypothetical
situation in which Duvid's child yells lire in
a crowded theater. Though my guess is the
most likely reaction from the crowd would
he lo tell the kicl to shut up, it seems that the
act would fall squarely under endangering
public safety. I'm not sure what law some
one calling in a bomb threat would be
breaking — fraud perhaps? Or maybe dis
turbing the peace?
The point is. the actions of David's hypo
thetical youngster are criminal, and there
are already laws to deal with them. What we
can't do. Stein argues, is make criminal
merely thinking about yelling fire or think
ing less of someone because of his or her
sexual orientation. If that were the case, I'd
have to be charged with a "thinking some
one isn't much fun at parties" and several

counts of "discriminatory thought towards
those who use tired analogies."

Stein's point was misun
derstood
Although this topic will undoubtedly
soon be overdone, I would like to respond
to the recent events involving the Phi Delts
and their injured brother. It's an awful situ
ation, and they don't need me to tell them
any more about it. As a caveat, I do want to
make it clear that I have known members of
fraternities and sororities, men and women
who are perfectly responsible people and
who give the Greek organizations a great
name on campus and to the outside world. I
do not. however, know much about what
it's like on the inside.
The distinction that can be made
between the "brethren" I've come in con
tact with and the stereotypical frat boys, is
that these friends are not in housed frats.
Whether it's the Sigma Chi plywood scan
dal. homophobic remarks at Kappa Sig.
fights at any number of parties, or the
recent, and most grave instance of a seri
ously injured Phi Delt, it seems to be far
from a coincidence that the fraternities who
earn the stereotypical reputations are

housed, and exist largely outside University
control. 1 don't believe that the frats are all
had. but there's something about a group of
twenty-something guys getting together
with a keg that seems to lead to trouble.
I understand that it isn't the brothers
who always cause the problem, but it is the
brothers' responsibility to take care of their
own and to respect the community that sup
ports them by attending their parties.
Frankly, housed fraternities' track records
have not been indicative of any degree of
concern for the students who are members
or who they are entertaining.
It is horrifying to me that no one. Greek
or independent, was willing to recognize an
incipient problem that has now resulted in
relative catastrophes, like recent fights and
cases of alcohol poisoning. These things
don't just happen.
I am concerned about the community
that we are encouraging and the lack of
respect and accountability which seems to
be the norm.
The notion of housing Greek organiza
tions is probably as old as Stanford, or close
to it.and undoubtedly has its merits. Frats
and sororities do provide a beneficial net
work of people for their members and some
are active in community service efforts. 1
think that, in general, if the sense of com
munity were strong and the desire for ser
vice great enough on campus, housing
would be a peripheral issue and the "great

parties" even further away from the main
discussion about the Greeks.
It is evident that the administration is
keeping a relatively close watch on the
housed frats. but also evident that probation
will always be temporary. 1 have some idea
why: Stanford alumni have a fairly good
connection to the University, and Greek
alumni sometimes even more so. 1 think
that, for all of our egalitarian pretensions,
outside support is an absolutely crucial fac
tor in forming University policy —as it
must be considering the financial needs of
our institution and the intellectual commu
nity it supports. But I wonder if the Univer
sity should be at all dependent on a system
that, in spite of relatively gracious policies
and many second chances, continues to
harm its students?
I say, give the houses to students willing
to foster innovative and individual commu
nities— not necessarily more co-ops and
theme houses, but something totally new,
created by interested students —and give
the frats a few years, unhoused, to prove
that they really mean business and can
maintain a sense of community without a
house to hold them together. At the end of
the trial period, evaluate the progress of the
new housing groups and the unhoused frats.
It's time to shake things up.
