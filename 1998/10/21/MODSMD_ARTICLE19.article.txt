# Deep Thoughts
## To woo is to avoid the perils of sketchiness 
### 
Brittney Jensen

UO KETCHY" IS ONE of those
Stanford words with a vague
definition hut an obvious mean
ing. Usually it applies to an attempted
romantic encounter that is sleazy, scary or
just odd. The categories of a sketchy per
son can range from stalker to pervert to
psychopath. How can a Stanford student
woo a romantic interest without being
coined sketchy? Where is the fine line
between flirtation and sliminess? For the
romantically challenged, here are a few
definitely sketchy words and locations to
avoid.
How to be sketchy: Ten really bad Stan
lord pick-up lines
(These statements have all actually been
attempted on someone 1 know in the last
three years. Hopefully the picker-upper
was really drunk.)
1) I saw your picture in the face book, and
I've been looking for you ever since, Betty
Sue Jones from Memphis. Tennessee, who
lives in Otero.

2) Did you hear about our house's under
ground hot tub? There's a secret passage
way to it in my room.
3) Didn't you hook up with my roommate?
He said you're a good kisser. Prove it to
me.
4) I like the dress you're wearing. I also
like the blue checked one you wear a lot
with your brown Ann Taylor sandals, and
the red knit one you only wear occasional
ly. You only think we've just met.
5) Want to go swim naked in Lake Lag?
6) You have a boyfriend? Are you sure?
Do you want me to beat him up? Why
don't we go downstairs and I'll take off my
shirt and you can judge who really has a
better body.
7) Wow, your butt is so big! Can I touch it?
8) I designed my own major, interdisci
plinary Human Sexuality. Would you like
to help me with my research?
9) I am not a whore. They made me wear
this.
10) Don't say anything at all. Just start
groping and kissing your potential
hookee's stomach on the dance floor.

Where to be sketchy: Ten really had places
to kiss at Stanford
1) Social dance class: It's understandable
that a good tango can arouse passions, but
please wait until after class to indulge your
amorous longings, or at least go to the lock
er room. Caressing each other while every
one's sitting down taking roll is not appreci
ated either.
2) Any room at SAE: Before anyone gets
offended, let me say that I'm sure there are
many respectable kisses between SAEs and
their girlfriends in those rooms. Hut if it's
3:0() a.m. on the weekend, you're in a toga
or a leopard-print bikini, and some guy tells
you there's a keg in his room, don't do it.
3) By the dumpster: All of your dormmates
will see you as they walk home. And it
smells bad.
4) The Phi Delt pool table: Unfortunately,
this landmark of sketchiness will soon be
just a hazy memory. Still, pool tables any
where are generally a bad idea, in case peo
ple want to play pool.
5) Single-stall bathrooms: Other people will
be annoyed if they have to pee and you're

using the toilet for non-functional purposes.
They might pee in your room. Also note
that the multiple stalls in dorms are too
small for a safe hook-up. Bathrooms in gen
eral should he avoided.
6) Your roommate's bed: If you put your
beds together to make a queen when she
goes home for Thanksgiving, she will find
out. And she won't be happy. At least wash
the sheets.
7) CIV/IHUM lecture: Granted, you're
bored, and your professor's dramatic read
ing of Sappho's poems is stirring your
blood. But self-control is appreciated.
8) At the Band Shak: Perhaps the new shak
will be cleaner, at least for the first few
hours, but presently, there's really not any
surface in the shak that bare skin is safe to
touch. Not even in the Friendship Room.
9) Blatantly in front of your ex: It's not very
nice. There are others ways to avenge your
self without involving an innocent bystander.
10) In the Roman Bath in the kitchen at
SAE Toga Party: Not to be redundant, but
this makes the bedrooms look respectable.
Considering the plethora of opportuni-
ties for sketchy behavior, what's a hopeful

romantic to do? The opposite of sketchiness
is sincerity. I recommend that boys just talk
to girls they like. Ask her name. Remember
her name. Don't call her by the wrong
name. Try not to puke on her. Call her up
and ask her on a official date. Successful
dates don't require big bucks, just a little
effort. Studying together at Sweet Hall and
eating dinner out of the vending machine
doesn't count.
Of course there are occasions when both
parties are in a sketchy mood and have sim
ilar intentions. In these instances, go ahead
and use the above sayings and locations or
any others your creativity can produce. But
for those wanting more than a random
hook-up, such behavior is inappropriate.
Just use a little respect and thoughtfulness.
Even at Stanford, one can flirt and date
without falling into the abyss of sketchiness.

Briltney Jensen is a senior majoring in English
with a focus on film and theater. She'd like to
thank Meghan for helping her conceive this
column after one of their potentially sketchy
adventures freshman year. She's heard SAE
has gotten a lot less sketchy since then.
