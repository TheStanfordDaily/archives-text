### Kiffen Hsieh 
Fewer foreign students are study
ing abroad at U.S. colleges and uni
versities, but Stanford's reputation
appears to be cushioning it against
this trend.
Although U.S. institutions en
rolled a record 458,000 foreign stu
dents in |y%-97, the percentage of
foreign students who are studying in
the I Jnited States has decreased from
40 percent in the to about 32
percent today, according to a recent
article in the ( hronicle of I ligher Ed
ucation.
The article said that Australia.
Britain, and Canada are now major
competitors for students, but num
bers suggest that the University,
along with peer elite institutions such
as Ivy League schools, doesn't need
to be concerned just yet.

it's like having a stock portfolio
of solid blue-chip companies." Se
nior Associate Director of Admis
sion Jon Reider s;iid. "They may go
up or down a little, but not like those
fly-by-night computer companies
that no one trusts."
Reider said that the I .800 interna
tional applications the I Jniversity re
ceived for the Class of 2002 was an
all-time high, lip from about 1.5(H) the
previous year. I le said that by main
taining its selectivity, the University
will continue to attract the best stu
dents.
"We still only accept 120-130 of
those applicants." he said. "So even if
the numbers went down bv <X percent,
we're not going to lose quality."
