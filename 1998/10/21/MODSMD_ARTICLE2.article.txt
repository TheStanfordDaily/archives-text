# Fewer foreign students in U.S.
## 
### Kiffen Hsieh 
Fewer foreign students are study
ing abroad at U.S. colleges and uni
versities, but Stanford's reputation
appears to be cushioning it against
this trend.
Although U.S. institutions en
rolled a record 458,000 foreign stu
dents in |y%-97, the percentage of
foreign students who are studying in
the I Jnited States has decreased from
40 percent in the to about 32
percent today, according to a recent
article in the ( hronicle of I ligher Ed
ucation.
The article said that Australia.
Britain, and Canada are now major
competitors for students, but num
bers suggest that the University,
along with peer elite institutions such
as Ivy League schools, doesn't need
to be concerned just yet.

it's like having a stock portfolio
of solid blue-chip companies." Se
nior Associate Director of Admis
sion Jon Reider s;iid. "They may go
up or down a little, but not like those
fly-by-night computer companies
that no one trusts."
Reider said that the I .800 interna
tional applications the I Jniversity re
ceived for the Class of 2002 was an
all-time high, lip from about 1.5(H) the
previous year. I le said that by main
taining its selectivity, the University
will continue to attract the best stu
dents.
"We still only accept 120-130 of
those applicants." he said. "So even if
the numbers went down bv <X percent,
we're not going to lose quality."
I lie percentage of international
students at the undergraduate level
has increased from 2.5 percent to 4.b
percent in the past 12 years, accord
ing to the Registrar's Office. At the
graduate level, 27.8 percent of gradu
ate students are foreign, up from 20.4
percent 12 years ago.
Reider said that one reason for the
disparity between undergraduate
and graduate numbers is the more
rigorous language requirements at
the undergraduate level. Graduate
applicants for many science pro
grams only have to take the Test of
English as a Foreign Language, but

the undergraduate admissions office
requires the SAT and a two-page
writing sample.
"We like students to be interested
in computer science, but as under
grads they also have to be able to
function in the humanities." he said.
At the graduate level, foreign stu
dents are Hocking to the School of
Engineering and the School of Earth
Sciences. Close to I<X percent of for
eign graduate students are studying
electrical engineering. And of the
total of 55 students in the Depart
ment of Petroleum Engineering, 4<S
are foreign graduate students.
Keider said he believes that hav
ing a Stanford professor win or share

the Nobel Prize in physics for the past
four years hasextended the I Iniversi
ty's reach in the sciences.
"You can bet they've heard about
it in Budapest. Romania. Beijing and
New Delhi," he said.
While Stanford's reputation plays
a major role in attracting applicants,
students often have financial consid
erations. The University is only able
to offer financial aid to about 30 for
eign undergraduates a year. At the
graduate level, aid is much more
plentiful and is determined by the
specific departments.
"I still would have come here if I
didn't have financial aid. but I would
have been working from dav one,"

said Jin Hian Lee, a co-terminal stu
dent in electrical engineering from
Malaysia. He will spend the eight
years following graduation working
for the company in Singapore that
has paid his tuition.
Petar Atanackovic, a first-year
post-doctoral student in physics from
Australia, said he also would have
come to Stanford without funding.
"It's just worth it,"he said. "You're at
one of the best universities in the
world."
But in some cases, money was the
determining factor.
"There's no way 1 would have
come here if I didn't have funding."
said Gordon Keeler, a doctoral can

didate in applied physics from Cana
da. "It would have been too expen
sive."
Bo Zhang, a master's student in
communication from China, said he
must pay an education fee of about
$3(X) a year to study abroad in the
I Jnited States, but the cost of his edu
cation in China is only $ 1(K)-$2(X) per
year. "If I didn't receive full tuition. I
couldn't have come here," he said.
While there are 98 countries rep
resented in the foreign student body,
more than half of the 2,852 students
are from Asian countries, according
to John Pearson, Director of the
Bechtel International Center. Pear
son said he was surprised to see appli

cation numbers go up last year de
spite the Asian economic crisis, hut
said the application deadlines oc
cured before the crisis was in full
swing.
"I'm more interested in whether
currency problems will affect foreign
student numbers than I am about
competition from other countries,"
Pearson said. He said that it is too
soon to tell whether the crisis will af
fect international applications this
year.
"I'm not worried at this moment,"
Pearson said. "Stanford's reputation
is spreading by word of mouth, and
we continue to see an increase in in
ternational students."
