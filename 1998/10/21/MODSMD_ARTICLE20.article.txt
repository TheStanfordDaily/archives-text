## On the defense Swim opens strong 
### Rebecca Rettig 
With the firing of the gun at the
Rolls Aquatic Center Pool in South
Bend, Ind.. the Stanford men's swim
team began its season with a victory
over the University of Notre Dame.
Stanford built on that win with a
strong showing at the Pacific Invita
tional in Stockton last Saturday.
Although collective team scores
were not kept at the meet, the Cardi
nal won all but three events.
Two swimmers were able to gar
ner first-place honors at Pacific. Se
nior Justin tiwers placed first in both
the 1 (K)-yard freestyle with a time of
46.30 and the 50 freestyle in 20.33.
The other double winner was senior
Tate Blahnik with victories in both
the 1(K) and 2(H) backstroke.
The team, last year's NCAA
champion, looks forward to another
strong winning year. Stanford tri
umphed last year with the second
largest margin of victory in the histo
ry of the NCAA Championships
with a point total of 599, 205 points
more than second-place Auburn.
"Last year, we had the best per
formance in NCAA history, placing
someone in the top eight in every sin
gle event." said head coach Skip
Kenney.
The team has two returning indi
vidual NCAA champions in seniors
Blahnik (200 backstroke) and
Matthew Pierce (2(X) butterfly).
Despite losing five seniors, includ
ing All-American Tom Wilkens, the
team has remained a swimming pow
erhouse by acquiring six new fresh
man — a well-rounded crew in terms
of event strengths — and sophomore
transfer C layton Jones.
It is really the strong sophomore

class that adds much power to the
men's team.
"I like to call the sophomore class
the 'straw that stirs the team.' " Ken
ney said.
Kenney is in his 20th season with
Stanford and has led the Cardinal to
17 consecutive Pacific 10 Conference
titles and seven NCAA Champi
onships. He has been named NCAA
Coach of the Year six times and Pac
-10 Coach of the year 12 times, with
consecutive titles in 1996-97 and
1997-9 S. Kenney also was the Head
Coach of the U.S. Olympic Team
during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
Ga.
Kenney is assisted by Ted Knapp,
who is in his 16th season, and by new
assistant coach Scott Claypool. Clay
pool swam for Stanford for four
years and graduated last year.
On Oct. 30-31, Stanford travel to
Austin to face Texas, which isn't a
common Stanford rival, but is a
strong team that poses a great chal
lenge to the team. Texas, like Stan
ford. has consistently had one of the
top-ranked men's swimming pro
grams in the country and has much
success in recruiting top swimmers.
"For the past two decades, it has
been us and Texas on top," said se
nior Blake Holden. "The Texas meet
for us is one of our true tests of what
NCA As is going to be like."
Last year's big meet against Texas
was held on Stanford's home turf, re
sulting in a strong Stanford victory.
Stanford took control of the meet
early and did not lose its lead, beating
the Longhorns 156-85.
"Our domination last year was
unbelievable. We all swam so well."
said distance standout Jeremv Kane.
