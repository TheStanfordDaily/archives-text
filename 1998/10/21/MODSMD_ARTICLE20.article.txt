## On the defense Swim opens strong 
### Rebecca Rettig 
With the firing of the gun at the
Rolls Aquatic Center Pool in South
Bend, Ind.. the Stanford men's swim
team began its season with a victory
over the University of Notre Dame.
Stanford built on that win with a
strong showing at the Pacific Invita
tional in Stockton last Saturday.
Although collective team scores
were not kept at the meet, the Cardi
nal won all but three events.
Two swimmers were able to gar
ner first-place honors at Pacific. Se
nior Justin tiwers placed first in both
the 1 (K)-yard freestyle with a time of
46.30 and the 50 freestyle in 20.33.
The other double winner was senior
Tate Blahnik with victories in both
the 1(K) and 2(H) backstroke.
The team, last year's NCAA
champion, looks forward to another
strong winning year. Stanford tri
umphed last year with the second
largest margin of victory in the histo
ry of the NCAA Championships
with a point total of 599, 205 points
more than second-place Auburn.
"Last year, we had the best per
formance in NCAA history, placing
someone in the top eight in every sin
gle event." said head coach Skip
Kenney.
The team has two returning indi
vidual NCAA champions in seniors
Blahnik (200 backstroke) and
Matthew Pierce (2(X) butterfly).
Despite losing five seniors, includ
ing All-American Tom Wilkens, the
team has remained a swimming pow
erhouse by acquiring six new fresh
man — a well-rounded crew in terms
of event strengths — and sophomore
transfer C layton Jones.
It is really the strong sophomore

class that adds much power to the
men's team.
"I like to call the sophomore class
the 'straw that stirs the team.' " Ken
ney said.
Kenney is in his 20th season with
Stanford and has led the Cardinal to
17 consecutive Pacific 10 Conference
titles and seven NCAA Champi
onships. He has been named NCAA
Coach of the Year six times and Pac
-10 Coach of the year 12 times, with
consecutive titles in 1996-97 and
1997-9 S. Kenney also was the Head
Coach of the U.S. Olympic Team
during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
Ga.
Kenney is assisted by Ted Knapp,
who is in his 16th season, and by new
assistant coach Scott Claypool. Clay
pool swam for Stanford for four
years and graduated last year.
On Oct. 30-31, Stanford travel to
Austin to face Texas, which isn't a
common Stanford rival, but is a
strong team that poses a great chal
lenge to the team. Texas, like Stan
ford. has consistently had one of the
top-ranked men's swimming pro
grams in the country and has much
success in recruiting top swimmers.
"For the past two decades, it has
been us and Texas on top," said se
nior Blake Holden. "The Texas meet
for us is one of our true tests of what
NCA As is going to be like."
Last year's big meet against Texas
was held on Stanford's home turf, re
sulting in a strong Stanford victory.
Stanford took control of the meet
early and did not lose its lead, beating
the Longhorns 156-85.
"Our domination last year was
unbelievable. We all swam so well."
said distance standout Jeremv Kane.
Although the team is now work
ing to repeat its triumph over the
Longhorns, the collective team goal
is to repeat as champions in both
the Pac-10 and NCAA competi
tions.
"We don't change our training for
dual meets," Kenney said. "Right
now we are working on race condi
tioning and sharpening technique. As
NCAA champions, we must train at a
higher level each year. All we are
doing now is trying to swim fast and
heat the competition. It is what is in
side that counts; no one can take your
race away from you."
With the remarkable team chem
istry and the strong team leadership
by captains junior Glen Counts and
seniors Dod Wales and Justin Ewers,
I lie ( ardinal has an excellent chance
at repeating last year's victories.
"Our team chemistry is great.
Everyone is ready to work, which
makes workouts easier and the mid
dle of the season... go by faster,"

Holden said.
The men's team was just ranked
No. 1 in the country by the College
Swim Coaches' Association Top 25
Poll with 275 total points. In addition
to the two returning NCAA champi
ons, the Cardinal returns 12 NCAA
championship scorers.
On Oct. 2, the Cardinal triumphed
in its first dual meet of the season with
a score of 149 over the Fighting Irish's
102. ITie male swimmers also set
three pool records for the Rolfs
Aquatic Center.
Two of the records came in the
first two events. The opening 400
medley relay team of senior Justin
Ewers, junior Glen Counts, sopho
more Adam Messner and freshman
Jeff Guyman set a pool record with a
first place time of 3:21.62.
Sophomore Jeremy Kane set the
second record in the second event —
the 1 .(XX) freestyle — with a time of
9:18.81. Matthew Pierce set the third
record later in the competition in the
2(X)-yard butterfly, also placing first
with a time of 1:49.(X). Stanford won
all but four events during the meet
against Notre Dame.
