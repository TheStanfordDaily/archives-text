# Volleyball rolls past Pacific

The Stanford women's volleyball
team headed into last night's match
at Pacific expecting a hard-fought ef
fort from the lOth-ranked Tigers.
But no one could have ever antic
ipated this.
After quickly jumping out to a
surprising two-game lead, the Cardi
nal proceeded to fall apart and drop
the next two frames, forcing a fifth
and deciding game in which the rally
scoring system would be used.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford d. No.
10 Pacific, 16-14, 15-6, 12-15, 3-15,
15-7.

With a point on the line with each
possession, Stanford regained its
composure and rolled to a thrilling
15-7 victory in game five.
After such a resilient effort, one
would expect the team to be drained
and content to bask in the satisfac
tion of an important win.
Maybe even a relaxing and mel
low bus ride home.
With this team, not a chance.
As soon as the last player boarded
the bus for the trip home, the video of
the five-game odyssey was rolling on
the bus's six built-in televisions.
And the players actually watched
it! And critiqued it!
The amazing post-game focus and
drive of the team aside, its most no
table accomplishment last night was
its gritty performance on the court.
"It was a great match," said junior
outside hitter Kerri Walsh. "Both
teams fought very hard and put up in
credible offensive numbers."
On the match, the two-time All-
American posted 24 kills and a .404

attacking mark, tying her career
high. She also passed the 1 ,(MX) mark
in career kills.
"I was so proud of our team for
stepping up in the fifth game and re
gaining focus," Walsh said. "We re
sponded to the added pressure and
came out with a lot of intensity."
Seemingly in control after win
ning the first two games, Stanford
lost all its momentum during half
time and brought an entirely differ
ent squad to the orange- and black
tiled tloor for the next two stanzas.
"We should've been out of there
in three," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "We came out and
played very well, but then we com
pletely broke down. We needed to
sustain the effort in the third game,
but we just let them back into the
match.
"It is definitely a good sign that we
were able to right the ship and win
game five," Shaw said. "But we still
have some major fundamental flaws
to take care of."
The main sore spot for the Cardi
nal after the Pacific match was its
poor defensive preformance, as it al
lowed two Tigers to post 25 kills and
yielded a .312 hitting percentage.
"We really did have a let-down on
defense, particularly in dealing with
that left-side angled kill," said sopho
more middle blocker Jennifer Det
mer. who had 13 kills of her own.
Defensive breakdowns aside,
Stanford posted an awesome offen
sive performance against the Tigers
with three players tallying over 15
kills, and an overall team hitting per
centage of .365.

bers at the right outside hitter slot,

before getting the win at Pacific last night.
