"Yeah, sometimes I accidentally
call him coach at home too," said se
nior Jamie Clark.
When you spend at least three
hours a day with your dad as your
coach, it's no wonder if the wrong
title accidentally slips out. Stanford
men's soccer head coach Bobby
('lark and his son spend many hours
a week together, practicing, lifting
weights and talking about the sport.
The bond between the two cen
ters around soccer, and the father
son relationship is often eclipsed by
the player-coach dynamic.
Or perhaps it is just that Bobby
( lark treats all his players like sons.
"He treats the whole team like he
treats his kids," Jamie said. "He has a
good sense of humor and is willing to
have fun. but the moment anyone
steps out of line he is right upon them.
That's the wav he is as a dad too."

The family's life has been cen
tered around soecer since Bobby and
Bette Clark's first child was born.
Originally from Scotland, the
elder Clark signed with a profession
al Scottish team during college and
played with Aberdeen for 17 years.
His playing career included a stint as
a member of three Scottish World
Cup squads. During these years, his
family grew to the size of five with
the births of his three children
Tommy, Jen and Jamie. But after a
career-ending back injury, Bobby
did not turn straight to coaching.
'The only way 1 had thought of
going into coaching was on the pro
fessional side of the game in Europe.
But that is a very unstable job, espe
cially with a young family," he said.
Luckily for Stanford, coach Clark
was brought back into the world of
soccer by a former professor who of
fered him the chance to start a soccer
club in Africa. The family picked up
and left Scotland for Zimbabwe,

where Bobby began life as a coach.
"I went there for a year and loved
coaching," he said.
After the stint in Zimbabwe, the
family moved to the United States
when Bobby accepted the head
coaching job at Dartmouth. At this
time, Jamie, the youngest of the
three children, was 8 years old and al
ready passionate about soccer.
"I started soccer when I was little
because everyone in Scotland
plays," the younger Clark said.
With his father at Dartmouth, he
did not pursue playing options else
where. However, during that winter,
Bobby accepted a coaching job in
New Zealand, and Jamie decided to
move with his family. During his
time in New Zealand, he decided to
attend North Carolina, where he had
a solid freshman year.
But during Jamie's first season as
a Tar Heel, his dad accepted the
