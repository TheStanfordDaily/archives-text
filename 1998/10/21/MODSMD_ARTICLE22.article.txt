"Yeah, sometimes I accidentally
call him coach at home too," said se
nior Jamie Clark.
When you spend at least three
hours a day with your dad as your
coach, it's no wonder if the wrong
title accidentally slips out. Stanford
men's soccer head coach Bobby
('lark and his son spend many hours
a week together, practicing, lifting
weights and talking about the sport.
The bond between the two cen
ters around soccer, and the father
son relationship is often eclipsed by
the player-coach dynamic.
Or perhaps it is just that Bobby
( lark treats all his players like sons.
"He treats the whole team like he
treats his kids," Jamie said. "He has a
good sense of humor and is willing to
have fun. but the moment anyone
steps out of line he is right upon them.
That's the wav he is as a dad too."

The family's life has been cen
tered around soecer since Bobby and
Bette Clark's first child was born.
Originally from Scotland, the
elder Clark signed with a profession
al Scottish team during college and
played with Aberdeen for 17 years.
His playing career included a stint as
a member of three Scottish World
Cup squads. During these years, his
family grew to the size of five with
the births of his three children
Tommy, Jen and Jamie. But after a
career-ending back injury, Bobby
did not turn straight to coaching.
'The only way 1 had thought of
going into coaching was on the pro
fessional side of the game in Europe.
But that is a very unstable job, espe
cially with a young family," he said.
Luckily for Stanford, coach Clark
was brought back into the world of
soccer by a former professor who of
fered him the chance to start a soccer
club in Africa. The family picked up
and left Scotland for Zimbabwe,

where Bobby began life as a coach.
"I went there for a year and loved
coaching," he said.
After the stint in Zimbabwe, the
family moved to the United States
when Bobby accepted the head
coaching job at Dartmouth. At this
time, Jamie, the youngest of the
three children, was 8 years old and al
ready passionate about soccer.
"I started soccer when I was little
because everyone in Scotland
plays," the younger Clark said.
With his father at Dartmouth, he
did not pursue playing options else
where. However, during that winter,
Bobby accepted a coaching job in
New Zealand, and Jamie decided to
move with his family. During his
time in New Zealand, he decided to
attend North Carolina, where he had
a solid freshman year.
But during Jamie's first season as
a Tar Heel, his dad accepted the

oned with since their arrival on the Farm.
head coaching job at Stanford and
Jamie knew what his next move
would be.
"I loved North Carolina, but I
transferred to Stanford to play under
my dad." he said.
These past two seasons at Stan
lord were the first time the two have
worked intensely, and the product
has been two successful seasons. Hut
to have the success on the field,
Hobby Clark had to develop the art
of coaching his own children. After
coaching Tommy at Dartmouth, the
experience with Jamie has been easy.
"You have to know that you are
going to be harder on [your own chil
dren | than on anyone else, and I think
they've got to know that," the elder
( lark said. "The other thing is that if
there is any doubt, you've got to give
it to someone else. When you take

your son, you have to know that he is
going to contribute to the team."
And there is no doubt that Jamie
Clark's contribution to Stanford soc
cer has been immense. He has al
ready received many awards and
honors, highlighted by last season's
pick as a National Soccer Coaches'
Association of America's second
team All-American, the highest
honor ever earned by a Cardinal
men's soccer player.
And he finds that having his father
as the coach means a constant incen
tive to play hard.
"I think 1 play smarter because he
gives me trouble if I don't," he said.
"It is different because if I do some
thing silly or make a mistake, I will
have to come home in a couple of
days, I can't really hide."
Despite this, the relationship isn't
an issue on the field.
"One of the best compliments that
I got was that one of the freshmen
during Jamie's first year didn't realize

until about six weeks into the season
that Jamie and I were related,"
Bobby said. "I took that as a compli
ment that I must have been doing a
pretty good job."
Even though they do not show it
on the field, the two articulate that
they are indeed very close, especially
as a result of soccer — and they
wouldn't have it any other way.
"My job has always been soccer
and it has all revolved around that.
Soccer has kept us very close," Hobby
Clark said.
The opportunity to play for his
dad has also made Jamie's college ex
perience different than that of the av
erage college student.
"Most people in college get away
from their parents, but at the age
when most are breaking away, I am
with him every day," Jamie said. "In
high school your aren't always a fan
of being around your parents, but in
college it is easier and I am happy to
be with them."
"Yeah, sometimes I accidentally
