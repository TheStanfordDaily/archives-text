Mountain Biking: Although not ac
cruing the number of points that it
had hoped, the Stanford mountain
hiking team was able to host a first
class meet last weekend.
The weekend wasn't all about the
organization though, as Stanford
was able to maintain its fourth place
ranking in the league. The teams
that hold the top three spots were
again able to enter more racers in
the downhill event, where Stanford
is not quite as strong.
