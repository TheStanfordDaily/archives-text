Mountain Biking: Although not ac
cruing the number of points that it
had hoped, the Stanford mountain
hiking team was able to host a first
class meet last weekend.
The weekend wasn't all about the
organization though, as Stanford
was able to maintain its fourth place
ranking in the league. The teams
that hold the top three spots were
again able to enter more racers in
the downhill event, where Stanford
is not quite as strong.

student Craig Litherland finished
seventh in the men's downhill. Dan
Blaugrund finished third in the
men's C cross-country race.
Ice Hockey: The ice hockey team
started its pre-league schedule out in
fine form this past Saturday night
with a 3-1 win against Palmer Col
lege of San Jose.
Stanford will begin the home sea
son this Friday with a game against
San Jose State. The game will begin
at 15 at Stanford's home rink at the

Forest Ray and the rest of the mountain biking team ran into trouble
last weekend at their home meet in San Jose.
State is in the Cardinal's conference,
the Pacific Eight, but both are strong
teams and a win over Palmer bodes
well for the upcoming season. How
ever, Palmer and San Jose State do
compete with Stanford for the West's
spot in the national tournament at the
end of the season and therefore are
important opponents for the team.
Gabe Miller had one of his best
games for Stanford, scoring two of
the team's goals and acting the assist
on the third, a shot by Ben D'Ewart.
Goalie Sami Jo Small shut down
many of Palmer's scoring opportuni
ties. Small's performance was even
more remarkable considering that
Palmer outshot Stanford 40 to 20.
Stanford will play San Jose State
again Saturday night in San Jose and
then will start play in the Pac-8 the
following weekend with a trip to Los

Angeles.
Cricket: The Stanford cricketers
ended a disappointing season on a
down note after being eliminated
from the Bank of India Knock-Out
Cup, which began on Oct. 11.
The injuries that plagued the team
the entire season continued for the
final tournament, forcing Stanford to
play a man down when one of the
team's new recruits had to sit out with
what is thought to be a slipped disk.
Adding to the frustration, the team
disagreed with an out by an umpire,
deflating its spirits for the rest of the
match. In the end, the Cardinal fell to
South Valley by 40 runs.
Equestrian: The Stanford equestrian
team had a strong showing as it host
ed a tournament for the Intercolle
giate Horse Show Association, and
the team was heavily complimented
for the professional and fast manner
in which the tournament was run.
Stanford was awarded first-place
finishes with the efforts of two of its

new freshman riders. Novice Libby
Porzig finished first in the Hat class, as
did Cindy Lin in the advanced walk
trot-canter class. All of the competi
tion this weekend was English riding.
Polo: The women's team was victori
ous with a 10-3 win at Oregon State
last Friday, and the men fell 20-7 on
Saturday.
Since collegiate polo consists of
only three players on the grounds at a
time, the women's team should have
a strong season as all four team mem
bers are experienced players return
ing to the squad.
The team consists of senior An
drea Avtjoglou, juniors Alison Daw
son and Bonnie Lind and sophomore
Brandy Moses.
The men's team, on the other
hand, is playing with two new players
and was facing a veteran OSU team.
The test for the men will be to see
how quickly it can incorporate its new
players into the game and come to
gether in a coordinated team attack.
