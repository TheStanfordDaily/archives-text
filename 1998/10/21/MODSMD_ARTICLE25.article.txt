# Grads start housing letter campaign
## Students writing letters to get support for new construction 
### Meredith Rowe 
Prompted by concern that a pro
posal to add 474 additional units of
graduate housing by 2(XX) will not be
accepted by the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, graduate stu
dents have begun a letter-writing
campaign to gain the support of sur
rounding communities.
The campaign, in which students
will write to local newspapers in
praise of the housing expansion, is
necessary to respond to negative
press, physics doctoral student Harris
Shapiro said.
"We're trying to balance the re
cent picture in the media," he said.
"We want to persuade the surround
ing community not to hurt graduate
students, however unfairly they feel
they've been treated in the past."
In order for the housing to be
built, the University must apply to
the Palo Alto City Council for an ex
emption to the general use permit

that restricts building to a fixed num
ber of square feet.
"Stanford is running out of
space," Shapiro said. "The proposed
474 units would occupy more than
half of the dwindling amount of
square footage left. With an exemp
tion. new housing wouldn't have to
count toward the total."
The need for the exemption
makes support of the Palo Alto City
Council essential, biochemistry grad
uate student Stephanie Toering said.
"If we don't get the exemption,
housing will be competing with acad
emic space." she said, fearing cuts in
the graduate housing proposal.
Residents living near planned
areas of expansion have voiced con
cern for two reasons, Shapiro said.
"First it was the Sand Hill quag
mire that caused difficulties," he said,
referring to the controversial con
struction project approved by voters
last year. "The second problem is that
when Stanford was presenting the

idea, 200 to 250 additional units for
faculty and staff housing were tacked
on to the planned 474."
"Also, 200 to 250 units were
added for medical residents in an
area currently zoned as a parking lot
across from the Stanford Shopping
Center. This area had been previous
ly deemed unsuitable for Sand Hill
housing," he said.
The cost of off-campus living is
currently extremely high, prompting
greater demand for on-cainpus
arrangements for graduate students.
The proposal for 474 new units of
housing represents a great beginning
on the behalf of Stanford, Shapiro
said."The University has done a good
job with short-term response." he
said. "The plan to build 474 new units
by 2(XK) is an admirable goal, since
there is no indication that the housing
market will get better."
Currently, the situation in stuffed
graduate residences such as Crothers
Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall is

difficult to accept, law student Allen
Drexel said.
"1 feel sorry for people in their 20s
and older who have to share tiny
rooms with no privacy," he said.
"With the increasing number of stu
dents, tremendous stress has been
placed on various resources."
Crothers community associate
Catherine Rose said crowded facili
ties have been hard for some.
"Some people can't get used to
waiting six hours for a shower," she
said. "When you're bringing together
such diverse people and you put
them together in such a close envi
ronment, it's difficult."
Shapiro maintains that the sup
port he hopes will be gained through
the campaign is necessary for success.
"This housing is desperately need
ed," he said. "We have to show the
surrounding community that there
are actually people being hurt and
they will continue to suffer consider
ably if dorms aren't built."
