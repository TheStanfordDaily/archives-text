# Profs discuss Clinton impeachment
## 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
For nine months journalists,
politicians and average citizens have
disputed whether or not the accusa
tions made against President Clin
ton warrant his impeachment and
removal from office. Yesterday in
Kresge Auditorium, a panel of eight
Stanford professors took their turn.
Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has accused Clinton of 13 im
peachable offenses relating to his re
lationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, including
perjury and obstruction of justice.
The group began by considering
the meaning of "high crimes and
misdemeanors," the Constitution's
standards for impeachment.
According to History Prof. Jack
Rakove, the "perplexing phrase"

was "adopted with a minimum of de
bate."
Rakove, who won the 1997
Pulitzer Prize in history for his book
on constitutional history, said that
when drafting the Constitution the
founders discussed narrowing the
grounds for impeachment to trea
son. bribery and corruption. George
Mason, who did not sign the Consti
tution. proposed that they also in
clude "maladministrations," or poor
performance in office. James Madi
son found that word too vague, so
Mason offered the phrase "other
high crimes and misdemeanors,"
which come from English law and
dates to the late 13(X)s.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
noted that the current political par
ties were arguing against their typi
cal beliefs. Liberals who usually pre
fer expansive terms are now "trying

to stay in George Mason's head,"
she said, while conservatives who
generally "dislike the loosey-goosey
interpretations" of the Constitution
are arguing for a more expansive de
finition of the phrase.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode, who
is currently advising Democratic
members of the House Judiciary
Committee on the issue, said that
the term misdemeanor, as used in
the Constitution, is often misunder
stood by the public. To the authors
of the Constitution, the term meant
"misconduct to the State or neglect
ed duty," she said.
One panelist. Law Prof. William
Cohen, agreed, saying that "[im
peachment) ought to require serious
maladministration of official duties
or even more serious criminal acts."
But Cohen said he couldn't abstract
ly pinpoint when acts become so se

rious as to require removal from of
fice.
The panel, however, spent a great
deal of time contesting whether or
not the accusations facing the presi
dent constituted impeachable of
fenses. Many have been asked to
join publicly with other constitution
al lawyers and issue a proclamation
saying the current charges do not
merit impeachment.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said
that it was too early to issue public
statements, but that he was con
cerned with the social impact of the
President disgracing himself and his
office bv lying under oath.
"Swearing and telling a grand
jury what seems to be a clear-cut lie,
informed by lawyers, sends a terrible
message." he said. "If I was sitting in
the House, I would have no doubt
that the House voted correctly to in
vestigate further."
He predicted that the House
would impeach President Clinton
but the Senate would not convict
him. He added that he said this as a
registered Democrat who voted for
Clinton twice.
Rakove also criticized Clinton's
behavior.
"The President is a graduate of
[Yale] law school, he was the attor
ney general of [Arkansas) He
should have known better," Rakove

said.
"The extent that Clinton made
everyone else — to use the Bogart
phrase — take the fall, shows a radi
cal misjudgment," he said, adding
that in his opinion, this "does get in
the ballpark of a plausible case for
impeachment."
Business and Political Science
Prof. David Brady, however, said he
couldn't "see impeachment voted
for a president with 61 percent ap
proval ratings."
In weighing the allegations,
Cohen separated them into three
groups.
"The question 'Did he fondle
Monica Lewinsky?' is far from an
impeachable offense," he said.

Cohen said he thought the eharges
of witness tampering and obstruc
tion of justice were more serious,
but doubts either can be proven.
Sullivan observed that judges
have been impeached for perjury,
but judges are appointed for life and
for good behavior, adding that if
there was a good behavior clause for
the president, this uncertainty might
have been avoided.
However, Gunther feels it is too
early to come to definite conclu
sions. He said he feels that the best
action is for citizens to "hope and
pray and write to your congressman
urging [him or her] to take this seri
ously so that is isn't a political foot
ball."
