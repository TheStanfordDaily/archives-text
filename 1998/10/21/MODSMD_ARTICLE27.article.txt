## Explain the inexplicable, and win a Nobel 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
With faculty Nobel prizes becoming
more of a sure thing than Big Game wins,
Stanford's Physics Department definitely
deserves some attention.
Stanford earned its fourth straight
Nobel prize in physics last week when it
was announced that Prof. Robert Laugh
lin had won this year's prize, sharing it
with Columbia Prof. Horst Stormer and
Princeton Prof. Daniel Tsui.
Physics Prof. Peter Michelson intro
duced one of the department's regular
weekly physics colloqiums yesterday,
Laughlin had a chance to explain the work
that earned him the prize.
"When we made the scheduling for the
colloquium, we left a gap... we knew
we'd need it," Michelson said, joking
about Laughlin's impromptu talk at the
colloqium.
With a total of nine Nobels, Stanford is
approaching the decade mark of prizes,
beginning with Felix Bloch's 1952 award.
Laughlin was recognized for his work
in the discovery of a phenomenon called
the "fractional quantum Hall effect." His
work built on the work of previous Nobel
prize winners in quantum mechanics.
Laughlin explained the importance of
his work. "Any time you find something in
nature which is quantitatively new, it is
grist for the mill."
A previous theory, proved in the late
1970s in a famous physics paper called the
"Gang of Four," proposed that current
should not How in certain types of two
dimensional materials. A physicist named
Klaus von Klitzing, who would later win
the Nobel prize for his discovery, contra
dieted this paper when he showed that a
current could How in those structures.
Von Klitzing's experiments, which laid
the groundwork for Laughlin's discover
ies, were performed on a sheet of semi
conductor material, cut into the shape of a
cross with two horizontal bars.

This cross was placed in a region of
extraordinarily high magnetic field. When
they applied a voltage difference across
the material, the scientists were suprised
to observe that current flowed.
This phenomenon led to a further dis
covery. The voltage across the horizontal
portion of the cross is called the Hall volt
age. If you divide this voltage by the cur
rent flowing through the material, you are
left with the Hall resistance. This value
and the strength of the magnetic field
allows a calculation of the number of car
riers, in this case electrons, in the material.
Von Klitzing's experiment raised
important questions, because for a large
range of magnetic fields, this quantity, the
Hall resistance, remained constant.
This fixed value would be expected if
the material they were working with had
been a "perfect" material, but it wasn't.
Materials which have an unclean or imper
fect crystalline structure are said to be
localized. Localization implied that cur
rent would not flow, but it did.
It created "perfection out of imperfec
tion," Laughlin explained. "It was just a
matter of figuring out why."
Other physicists changed the condi
tions of the experiment to see if the con
stant value would still be observed under a
greater magnetic field. Once again, the sci
entists saw what they did not expect to see.
Von Klitzing's effect still held, but
researchers observed a constant value
which was one-third of the original. This
phenomenon implied fractional particles,
which needed some explanation.
At this point, in the early 1980s, Laugh
lin arrived on the scene. He attempted to
explain why the fractional particles — in
this case, one-third — were observed in
the two-dimensional cross experiment.
"The one-third could only mean one
thing," Laughlin said, "A new kind of vac
uum which had a different kind of ele
mentary excitation." This realization, for
which Laughlin won the Nobel, is called
the fractional quantum Hall effect.

When an electron travels through a
medium, it distorts the environment
around it on an extremely microscopic
level. The "object" of the travelling elec
tron combined with the distortion of the
material it travels through is called the ele
mentary excitation.
Excitations will be different given a dif
ferent vacuum, also known as ground
state. Laughlin knew that the von Klit/.ing
experiment and the experiments that fol
lowed from it, which demonstrated the
movement of fractional particles, implied
a previously undiscovered type of vacuum.
Laughlin attributes his realization to a
bit of blind luck. His interaction with indi
viduals at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory sparked ideas that
led to his discovery.
"The moral of the story is to learn a lot
of things," Laughlin explained. "It was just
a fluke" that he was talking to the right
people when he was considering the frac
tional particle phenomenon.
When Laughlin published his paper
describing his discovery, it turned a lot of
heads in the scientific community. " There
were a lot of knockoffs [from the paper],
so I knew it was great," Laughlin said.
Surprisingly, Laughlin's Nobel prize
winning work is not directly relevant to
current work in the physics community.
Laughlin himself has moved on to the sub
ject of superconductivity.
"The importance of the experiment is
that it's a prototype for what ordinary
quantum mechanics can do," Laughlin
said. "They are a model for what our
notion of space-time would be like."
In order to understand a system as mas
sive and complex as space itself, work first
needs to be done at the laboratory level.
In each case, the theory is a logical
development from an unanswered ques
tion or from an observation which is so
bizarre, it seems wrong. Laughlin said.
"This is one more little clue about what
quantum mechanics might do for you,"
Laughlin said.
