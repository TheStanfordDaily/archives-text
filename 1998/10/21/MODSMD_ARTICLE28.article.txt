# They won't let sleeping dogs lie
## Stanford researchers search for canine narcolepsy gene 
### Jane Morril 
In I c >73, a veterinarian at IJC-Davis
discovered a group of poodles who
demonstrated sudden muscle paralysis
when excited. Intrigued, the doctor gave
the dogs to Stanford for study. The
donation ol these animals, who exhibit
ed symptoms very similar to humans
with narcolepsy, marked the beginning
of the research on narcolepsy at the I Jni
versity.
Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder charac
terized by excessive daytime sleepiness
and cataplexy. Cataplexy is the sudden
loss of muscle control, ranging from ;i
slight facial paralysis to a full body limp
ness. Narcoleptic patients may ;ilso
experience abnormalities in dreaming
sleep (KHM). I he disease currently
affects about I in 2.0(H) Americans.
In 19.X6, after 13 years ol studying
narcolepsy in dogs. Stanford officially

opened the Center for Narcolepsy
Research, devoted to the research of the
causes and treatments of this sleep dis
order. I he center is located in the Med
ical School under the department of
behavioral psychology. The canine
colony initiated in 1973 is currently the
primary focus of research.
Researchers believe that both a
genetic predisposition and environmen
tal factors play a role in the onset of nar
colepsy. I he primary locus ol research is
i)ii genetics rather than environment.
"At this point, the most important
thing is to locate the gene for narcolepsy
m canines." said Associate Director Sciji
Nishino. Once scientists find the gene in
dogs, they will be able to learn more
about the cause and possible treatments
of narcolepsy in humans.
"Current treatment in humans is not
entirely satisfactory," Nishino s;iid. "We
need a breakthrough, which we hope to

achieve through canine research."
"Studying sleep disorders such as nar
colepsy provides us with the opportunity
to learn more about the mechanisms
underlying sleep," said research assis
tant Joyce Riehl.
Research on narcolepsy has not been
a simple task. "This is a difficult and long
process," said research coordinator
Michele Okun.
Limited genetic knowledge of dogs
has slowed research on the canine
colony. I'he center, however, has con
structed its own gene map of the dog to
facilitate its research.
The psychological effects of narcolep
sy can be severe. Okun emphasized the
importance of understanding the dis
ease. "Not a lot of people know about
the disease and think it's funny. A lot of
students here, however, suffer from nar
colepsy, often without knowing it," she
said.
