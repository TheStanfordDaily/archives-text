# Developing ways to survive the quake

### Armen Berjikly 
In just the last three days, more than 16
earthquakes over magnitude 2.0 have occurred
in Northern California. This level of activity is
typical in this region and serves as an excellent
reminder that earthquakes are a constant
threat to property and life — they cannot be
ignored or conveniently forgotten.
Earthquakes, of course, cannot be prevent
ed either. The only practical option is studying
earthquakes in order to better control their
damage.
Stanford's John A. Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center, located on campus in
Building 54(3, does just that. Named after a
world-renowned structural engineer, this spin
off from the Department of Civil Engineering
has been involved in research and education in
earthquake engineering for over 25 years.
Director Anne Kiremidjian expresses the
center's theme as "advancing the state-of-the
art in earthquake engineering." Over its life
time, center researchers have done pioneering
work in various aspects of earthquake engi
neering— seismic hazard and risk analysis,
earthquake occurrence and ground motion
modeling, and the evaluation of the damage
potential of specific ground motions.
Current research at the center focuses on
characterizing earthquake forces and their
effect on buildings, as well as analyzing the per
formance of all types of structures against those
forces. The analytical study paves the way for
new design procedures and development meth
ods that will stand up to earthquakes far better
than previous structures. The secondary benefit
is the development of tools for social and polit
ical decision-making with regard to earthquake
preparedness and preparation.
One example of current research involves
the development of advanced damage monitor
ing systems. Kiremidjian and Civil Engineering
Prof. Kincho Law, along with graduate student
Erik Straser, prototyped vibration and strain
sensors which accumulate local siesmic data
and then transfer it by radio to a nearby "base"
computer.
The wireless mode of communication solves
numerous problems associated with the older
method, which involved hard-wiring all the sen
sors at a site to the central base.
"Traditionally, over two-thirds of the cost of
installing sensors was directly related to the
hard-wiring method," Kiremidjian said.

In addition to the tremendous cost savings
of the new design, the sensors are easier to
install. In testing, Straser took approximately
one hour to equip an extensive bridge with the
new sensors. A team working on the same
bridge using the older meters took ewer a day
and a half to perform the same task.
Furthermore, retrofitting existing structures
with monitors now becomes a much easier
chore. "Not having to run wires is a huge sav
ings," Kiremidjian says.
Straser concludes that the use of the center's
wireless design facilitates "real-time damage
monitoring that evaluates both the extreme
event and long term health of civil structures."
A study completed last summer by Rachel
Davidson, a recent Civil and Environmental
Engineering graduate, showcases the more vis
ible aspects of earthquake engineering. In a
multidisciplinary approach typical of the Blutne
Center, Davidson formulated an Earthquake
Disaster Risk Index, a scale which allows direct
and relative comparison between different
cities' overall seismic risk.
Since there has been very little research
done on a city-by-city scale, this systematic
comparison could prove to be extremely useful.
For example, each city will know which factors
are most important for itself and can then tar
get the areas which are the greatest risk for the
city. Further, by reevaluating the index period
ically. the scale can be used to monitor trends in
earthquake disaster risk over time.
The index aims to increase awareness of the
wide range of factors that contribute to earth
quake risk. "Even in urban regions with low
seismicity, an earthquake may occur, and if it
does, the other characteristics of the city could
turn that single event into a major disaster,"
Davidson said.
When asked what developments to expect
from the Blume Center in the future, Kiremid
jian first stipulated. "We are not involved in
earthquake prediction."
Throwing away the crystal-ball approach,
the center strives instead to remain the leader
in the development and design of earthquake
loss prevention methods. The center's work
"will help government agencies develop appro
priate mitigation strategies and influence future
building codes," Kiremidjian said.
When that next inevitable earthquake
strikes, Stanford's Blume Center may very well
be behind the scenes, keeping the frightening
rumble from becoming a disaster.
