Yew has been recognized as a key
figure in the rapid economic rise of
Singapore during his terms as prime
minister from 1959 to 1990. He was
visiting Stanford as a member of the
Institute for International Studies
Advisory Council. The council met
on Monday and yesterday to discuss
such issues as global warming, secu
rity issues in Asia and preventive de
fense for Russia and China.
The council was founded in 1991
by George Shultz, former U.S. Sec
retary of State and Distinguished
Hoover Fellow and gives advice on
the activities and general direction

of the institute. It meets every IX
months and includes dignitaries such
as former President Gerald Ford,
former ambassador to Czechoslova
kia Shirley Temple Black and Fuji
Xerox Company Co-Chief Execu
tive Officer Yotaro Kobayashi.
"[The council] gives greater ex
posure to the lIS faculty on the views
of policy-makers," said Nancy Oki
moto, the institute's director of spe
cial projects. This dialogue gives
those conducting academic research
a chance to gain more insight on the
implications for policy makers.
"It's one form of outreach for us,"
Okimoto added. "It's important to
get feedback."
Members of the council also at
tended a luncheon with more than
40 students at the Manzanita Dining

Hall yesterday. Josh Kramer, a
sophomore, sat at a table with Visit
ing lIS Prof. John Shalikashvili, for
mer Chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
"I was really fascinated to get a
glimpse of how our nation's leaders
think, act and live when they're off
camera," Kramer said.
Other attendees included former
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher. former West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt, former
British foreign minister Lord Howe
and Shultz. who chairs the council.
Howe and Christopher spoke
briefly, encouraging students to lill
what they saw as a present vacuum
of strong leadership in international
politics.
Howe said that the abrasiveness

of the media had raised the costs of
being involved in public life, but said
these concerns are outweighed
when an individual makes a differ
ence in determining international
policy.
"Democracy is not a spectator
sport." Howe said. "Public life offers
the opportunity to make a difference
beyond any other kind of occupa
tion." He exhorted students to es
tablish economic independence be
fore pursuing a life of public service
to guard against the whims of poli
tics.
Shultz repeated these sentiments
at the dinner last night, which was
closed to the public. "If you're trying
to make a democratic society work,
then you have to get at it and work at
it vourself."
