# Gaieties group tickets to be sold on the World Wide Web
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
The Big Game Gaieties produc
tion crew is taking extra precautions
this year to prevent a repeat of last
year's Fridav-night ticket-sales cata
strophe.
Last year, group ticket sales were
accepted for two days without a tabu
lation check. When requests were
counted, the Friday night show was
oversold by 700 tickets.
This year, the crew is anticipating
a Friday sellout, and perhaps a Thurs
day sellout as well, and plans to use
technology to simplify the process.
"We decided we'd make it Web
based this year." said Gaieties pro
ducer Steven Aronowitz. "Once we
start accepting orders, we'll be able to
keep track of exactly how many [we
have sold) and stop access to the page
once we reach the limit."
"[The page] is not going to crash,"
said junior Tom Jacobs, Gaieties'
webmaster. "I think it should allevi
ate some of our problem and enable
us to keep track of who is submitting
tickets for what dorms."

"Last year we ended updoingit by
percentage," Aronowitz said. "We
ended up giving priority to dorms
with the greatest percentage of peo
ple coming for the Friday night" per
formance and denied seating to 7(K)
people in dorms with lower percent
ages.
"We just couldn't do it first come,
first serve since we hadn't kept
track," he added. "Lots of people
were really pissed, and we're hoping
to avoid that this time."
Last year's fiasco culminated in
many dorms losing their Friday seat
ing. Additionally, Ram's Head The
atrical Society, the organization that
produces Gaieties, had to grant re
funds and priority seating for the
Thursday night show to those who
had lost out in the oversell.
"I think this way will be easier and
more fair," Aronowitz said.
In assigning seat locations, orga
nizers will take into account three
categories of dorms: those with 50 or
more residents, those with 50 to 150
residents and those with 150 or more
residents. The best seats will go to
those dorms in each category with the

highest percentage of residents at
tending the performance.
Aronowitz will contact RAs, in
forming everyone of the guidelines.
As another precaution, the Thurs
day performance will be combined
with a senior pub night, so as to create
for seniors an especially attractive al
ternative to the Friday night show.
"We're working together with the
[senior] class presidents," Aronowitz
said. "We'll have beer and pizza at
Mem Aud for seniors an hour before
the show." The hope is this will dis
tribute demand more evenly be
tween the nights.
"Gaieties is an event that people
like to go to with groups of friends, es
pecially as seniors," said Erica Straus,
a senior class president. "This is a way
for us to drayv a large crowd of seniors
who might not otherwise go. It will be
a great senior bonding experience
and spirit-builder for Big Game."
"1 want people to come all three
nights," Aronowitz said. "I don't
want to have a Friday sellout and a
Wednesday and Thursday partial
showing. The senior night will help to
balance that out."
