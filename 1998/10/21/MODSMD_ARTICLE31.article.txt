# New judicial rules proposed
## Fines eliminated, advisors may not speak in proceedings 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Students accused of Honor Code
or Fundamental Standard viola
tions may no longer have represen
tatives speak for them during judi
cial panel hearings, according to by
laws drafted by the Board on Judi
cial Affairs that take effect this
quarter.
The board, consisting of six stu
dents, six faculty members and
three University staff members,
also released a new penalty code
listing all possible punishments for
student infractions. Honor Code of
fenses involve academic miscon
duct, while examples of Fundamen
tal Standard violations include
theft, forgery and harassment.
The new code grants judicial
panels the authority to issue a for
mal warning as a penalty and elimi
nates punitive fines for students.
Law Prof. Janet Halley, the
board's co-chair, said that the board
reached a consensus on all the new
legislation except for the issue of
what role a student's representative
can play in hearings.
"We deliberated [the issue] at
every meeting for all of winter and
spring terms," Halley said.
Halley said the committee con
sidered whether students whose na
tive language is not English would
be slighted by the legislation, but
concluded that using a translator in

hearings would be preferable to
having an outside representative.
She also noted that the charter
does not require students to speak
at the hearing, allowing for an emo
tionally distraught student to sub
mit a written statement.
With regard to the new penalty
code, Halley emphasized that it is
not meant to tell panels how to pun
ish specific crimes, but rather pro
vide a comprehensive list from
which the panel can choose an ap
propriate punishment.
While the new code eliminates
fines, it does state that "a student
may be assessed a reasonable mon
etary penalty to defray actual finan
cial losses to the University."
History master's student Daniel
Levin, co-chair of the board, said
that the financial means of the stu
dent will be considered by the judi
cial panel before assessing damages.
"If a person knocks down
Hoover Tower, we shouldn't make
them pay for it," said Halley, ex
plaining that such a large financial
penalty would affect a student long
after the incident.
Although the entire penalty
code has been rewritten by the
board. Levin said the change "was
not a huge departure" from the old
code, which was originally written
in 1968. The changes, according to
Levin, were mainly in style to coor
dinate with the new charter.
Since the new charter has been in

place, there has been no significant
change in the number of cases
heard, according to Jennifer
Perkins, judicial advisor. According
to Perkins, disciplinary panels have
heard about 35 cases since January.
The new bylaws and penalty
code were sent to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, the Faculty
Senate, and the ASSU Senate for
review in mid-September. Each of
these three bodies has the power to
veto the board's legislation if it so
chooses.
Levin said that the board is not
looking to create extraneous by
laws, but rather generate them as
necessary. He said the board will
now focus on educating students on
the judicial process and what hap
pens when a student is accused of
misconduct.
In last week's ASSU meeting, an
amendment, which was tabled until
the Oct. 27 meeting, was offered to
clarify that fines assessed to guilty
students could not be imposed ex
cept as restitution and that whatev
er entity was imposing the fines had
to provide documentation listing
reasons behind the charges. Fines,
under the amendment, could not be
imposed to pay for the investigation
or judicial hearing.
Halley said that the board wel
comes input from all members of
the Stanford community. She can
