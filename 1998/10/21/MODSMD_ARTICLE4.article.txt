Members of Phi Delta Theta fru
iernity will not he allowed to draw
hack into their house or to draw into
other residences 111 groups of more
than four, according to Kathleen
Hransfield. manager of I lousing As
signment Services.
I ast week I )ean ol Students Marc
Wais. with the unanimous support of
the (ireek Judicial Board, evicted the
fraternity from its house after I Jni
versity officials conducted an investi
gation that revealed the fraternity
had violated the terms ol its proba
tion.
I he investigation came after se
nior Michael Howard, a member of

the fraternity, fell from a balcony at
the house two weeks ago. While
looking into the accident. I Jniversity
officials discovered that that fraterni

house event, a clear violation of the
probation sanctions. Howard re

no member of the (Jreek chapter,
pledge or alumni will be allowed to
use the house for any (ircek activities

chapter will be allowed to draw into
the house."
Camarillo cited no punitive rea

"Phi Dells who lived in the house
for two vears alread\ will have to eo

Phi Delt president Jackson Wa
gener, a senior, said that fraternity
members have not spent much time
thinking about the housing situation
because their thoughts have been
with I ioward.
"What happened was unfortunate
and tragic," Wagener said. "Of
course we are sad that we are not
going to be living together, but we re
