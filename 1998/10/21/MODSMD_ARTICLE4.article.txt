### Marni Leff Staff writer 
Members of Phi Delta Theta fru
iernity will not he allowed to draw
hack into their house or to draw into
other residences 111 groups of more
than four, according to Kathleen
Hransfield. manager of I lousing As
signment Services.
I ast week I )ean ol Students Marc
Wais. with the unanimous support of
the (ireek Judicial Board, evicted the
fraternity from its house after I Jni
versity officials conducted an investi
gation that revealed the fraternity
had violated the terms ol its proba
tion.
I he investigation came after se
nior Michael Howard, a member of

the fraternity, fell from a balcony at
the house two weeks ago. While
looking into the accident. I Jniversity
officials discovered that that fraterni
ty members had been drinking at a
house event, a clear violation of the
probation sanctions. Howard re
mains in the hospital in "fair" condi
tion. a representative of Stanford
Medical Center, said yesterday.
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo explained that in
past incidents where fraternities have
lost their houses. Res Ed has fol
lowed similar guidelines.
"We believe that in order to fully
support those students who will be
assigned to live at the house for the
remainder of the academic year, that
there must be a clear break with the

current residents and culture of the
house." Camarillo said. " Therefore
no member of the (Jreek chapter,
pledge or alumni will be allowed to
use the house for any (ircek activities
including rush. No member of the
chapter will be allowed to draw into
the house."
Camarillo cited no punitive rea
sons for limiting the si/o of I'lii Dell
draw groups.
" The troubling piece is that we
will not have enough space to accom
modate draw groups of eight." Ca
marillo said.
Branslield explained that the I 'ni
versity considers years spent in fra
ternity housing "preferred" years.
"Phi Dells who lived in the house
for two vears alread\ will have to eo

unpreferred." Bransfield explained.
"They had their two years of pre
ferred housing."
Other fraternity members, how
ever. will he allowed to draw pre
ferred. Bransfield said.
Phi Delt president Jackson Wa
gener, a senior, said that fraternity
members have not spent much time
thinking about the housing situation
because their thoughts have been
with I ioward.
"What happened was unfortunate
and tragic," Wagener said. "Of
course we are sad that we are not
going to be living together, but we re
ally haven't talked about it much."
To eliminate confusion and allow
Housing Assignment Services to
make sure fraternity members un
derstand the draw process. Brans
field said, the Phi Delts will have to
submit their draw cards to the office
on paper rather than by computer.
"This will allow us to look at each
application," Bransfield said. "A lot
of the Phi Delts have never gone
through draw. We found when the
[Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
members] lost their house last year
that they did not understand how the
final choice worked. This way we can
answer any questions they may
have."
Students who are currently over

seas and have submitted applications
for University housing can change
those applications by Axess. The
house is already listed as an option
for students who have applied for
winter quarter housing.
Students have until Oct. 30 to sub
mit changes to their housing applica
tions. In addition. Bransfield said, her
office will e-mail the 253 students
who applied for winter quarter hous
ing to let them know that their op
tions now include the Phi Delt house.
But some are skeptical.
Senior Rebecca Robbins, re
mained unassigned for a few days of
winter quarter last year after return
ing from Florence. "It opens better
spots, but the Phi Delts are going to
have to live somewhere so there will
still be people left unassigned."
