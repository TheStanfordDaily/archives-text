### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Only ;i small population of Stan
ford students know ol the "(irateful
Dead Mouses." And even fewer
know Rob l.evitsky, the man who
owns them. Approximately 70 cur
rent or former Stanford students live
in these houses and l.evitsky plays an
important role in their community
life.
The 12 Dead houses, which are
within biking distance of campus, are
;ill named after (irateful Dead songs:
Terrapin Station. Box of Rain. I )ark
I follow. Scarlet Fire. Deal. Birdsong,
Morning Dew. Touch of (irav. Built
to Last. Shakedown Street, New
Speedway Boogie and Truck in",
l.evitsky currently lives with stu
dents in Morning Dew.
I le acquired his first house. Ter
rapin, in 19N2. In 1987. he bought
Box of Rain and has subsequently
purchased one house a year since
then. And just Monday afternoon,
he bought another house. It will be
called I Inbroken Chain.
It's no surprise that l.evitsky
chose to name his houses after Dead

songs. I le contributed heavily to the
community that followed the band
for more than 20 years.
Levitskv was known at shows bv

I he costume lhal he wore, which he
described as "quite visible." He
looked like a lighted dancing bear
and carried a spinning volleyball-

Si/cd sphere made of wires and col
ored lights.
Matt Linden, who graduated in
June and who is currently living in
Shakedown Street for a second year,
knows Levitsky through his atten
dance at shows.
"I know Rob because he was the
warm, fuzzy dancing bear with the
twirlv light thing at the Dead shows.
That's how I first met him." Linden
said.
Sandy Coulson. who has been the
cook at Lambda Nu for 19years, also
knew Levitsky from shows.
"Back when [the Dead] existed.
Rob.. .would spend the entire Dead
show dancing around." Coulson
said. "He was a reassuring thing to
look at. he always gave you the feel
ing that everything was OK. The idea
that he did this for hours and hours
on end always amazed me."
Originally from Palo Alto. Levit
sky attended I J( -Davis and graduat
ed in 1979 with a degree in electrical
engineering. He returned to Palo
Alto and worked for the start-up
company Megatest making test
