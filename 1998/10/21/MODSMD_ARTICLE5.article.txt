### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Only ;i small population of Stan
ford students know ol the "(irateful
Dead Mouses." And even fewer
know Rob l.evitsky, the man who
owns them. Approximately 70 cur
rent or former Stanford students live
in these houses and l.evitsky plays an
important role in their community
life.
The 12 Dead houses, which are
within biking distance of campus, are
;ill named after (irateful Dead songs:
Terrapin Station. Box of Rain. I )ark
I follow. Scarlet Fire. Deal. Birdsong,
Morning Dew. Touch of (irav. Built
to Last. Shakedown Street, New
Speedway Boogie and Truck in",
l.evitsky currently lives with stu
dents in Morning Dew.
I le acquired his first house. Ter
rapin, in 19N2. In 1987. he bought
Box of Rain and has subsequently
purchased one house a year since
then. And just Monday afternoon,
he bought another house. It will be
called I Inbroken Chain.
It's no surprise that l.evitsky
chose to name his houses after Dead

songs. I le contributed heavily to the
community that followed the band
for more than 20 years.
Levitskv was known at shows bv

I he costume lhal he wore, which he
described as "quite visible." He
looked like a lighted dancing bear
and carried a spinning volleyball-

Si/cd sphere made of wires and col
ored lights.
Matt Linden, who graduated in
June and who is currently living in
Shakedown Street for a second year,
knows Levitsky through his atten
dance at shows.
"I know Rob because he was the
warm, fuzzy dancing bear with the
twirlv light thing at the Dead shows.
That's how I first met him." Linden
said.
Sandy Coulson. who has been the
cook at Lambda Nu for 19years, also
knew Levitsky from shows.
"Back when [the Dead] existed.
Rob.. .would spend the entire Dead
show dancing around." Coulson
said. "He was a reassuring thing to
look at. he always gave you the feel
ing that everything was OK. The idea
that he did this for hours and hours
on end always amazed me."
Originally from Palo Alto. Levit
sky attended I J( -Davis and graduat
ed in 1979 with a degree in electrical
engineering. He returned to Palo
Alto and worked for the start-up
company Megatest making test

equipment for computer chips.
After five years at Megatest. he quit
and started working for himself as a
consultant.
Despite rumors to the contrary.
Levitsky does not own a patent on
any equipment..Today, he still con
sults on the equipment he helped to
design. He is hired by large semi
conductor companies to write the
computer programs to test their new
chip.
Coulson remarked that Stanford
is a big part of Levitsky's life.
"He's turned Stanford into his
personal family that he takes care of.
That Grateful Dead spirit, that's re
ally what the Grateful Dead was â€”
one giant family," Coulson said.
Moreover, Coulson believes Lev
itsky has a lot to give to students.
"He tries to share with students
experiences that he's had in life that
students may never have had if he
wasn't around. Since we don't have
the Grateful Dead anymore, it's our
job to not let people forget," she said.
Linden added that Levitsky does
a great thing for Stanford communi
ty by providing cheap housing. The
average rent in the Dead houses is
$450 per month, much less than the
average cost of housing in this area.
"His houses are a coveted place
to live and offer cheap rent and a
mellow community near Stanford, "
agreed Heather Rogers, who gradu
ated in June and lives in Deal.
This mellow community is com
prised of people that share similar in
terests and philosophies of life. Lin
den describes the residents as easy
going.
"It's very rare," he said, "that
you'll find someone who is uptight in
the houses."
Community not only exists within
a house, but it is also betweenhouses.
" They are another place to hang
out in addition to parties put on by
the Greek system," commented
Rogers. "For my last two years here,
I've spent a lot of time at parties at

Dead houses, not on campus."
Just as the tenants of the Dead
houses are easy going, so is the land
lord. Rogers confirmed that Levit
sky allows the residents a great deal
of freedom.
"[He] lets you do what you want
to the house. My housemates and I
repainted Deal and we Roto-Tilled
the back yard." she said.
Most of Levitsky's tenants have
previously lived in one of the Stan
ford co-ops or self-ops. and thus have
experience in cooperative living.
They hear of openings in the houses
only by word of mouth. Levitsky has
never officially advertised.
Levitsky benefits from the stu
dents, too.
"There's a lot more life that hap
pens in younger people," Levitsky
said. "They are not locked away in
some compartment of society. They
are a lot more open to new life styles,
and more open in general. There are
too many other people my age who
become caught up in materialism,
clothes, cars and competition."
"You don't have to be forced into
the corporate mold," Levitsky be
lieves. "You can interact with soci
ety, yet maintain your individuality."
In addition to the houses, three
years ago Levitsky acquired 65 acres
of land that adjoins Big Basin.
Since then, he has invited stu
dents and on-campus houses to go
there on camping trips.
The camp site overlooks the
ocean and Pidgeon's Point.
When asked why he has chosen to
be so generous to people half his age,
Levitsky answered, "It feels like a
good thing to be doing. People seem
to enjoy it."
He added, "Big Basin is a beauti
ful place and it's not easy to go camp
ing where you can have a fire and be
by yourself, instead of right next to
the neighboring fire pit."
Besides attending dinners and
happy hours at the co-ops, Levitsky
drums and plays guitar.
Occasionally, he performs with
Phil Coulson, guitarist for Grateful
Dead cover band Jerry's Kids, at the
Palo Alto Farmer's Market.
