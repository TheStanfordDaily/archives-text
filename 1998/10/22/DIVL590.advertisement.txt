♦ Exclusive Integrated Flight Training System:
Relax. Learning to fly just got a lot easier and fun. At the Stanford Flying Club, you won't need
to sit through boring classes or wade through mountains of manuals. Instead you'll discover
our new exclusive, interactive Private Pilot Multi-Media Training System (from Cessna
Aircraft). With this Computer Based Instruction system, you can learn at your own pace - any
where you have access to a computer, tracking progress as you go. You even get to preview
your upcoming training flights. Graduates have typically obtained their Pilot's License with up
to 26% fewer hours than the national average, and with correspondingly lower costs.
Discover how fun, convenient and affordable getting your Pilot's License can be these days!
+ Highest Success Rate: Our percentage of new Members actually completing a Pilot's
License is significantly higher than elsewhere. Don't be confused by those fly-by-night imita
tions with a lesser safety record. And as an authorized FAA Test Center, we found that 100%
of our 1997 and 1998 graduates successfully passed their FAA Pilot's License Knowledge Test
on the first try.
+ Affordable Rates: Two-Seat aircraft start at $47/ hr and Four-Seaters at $59/ hr, incl.
fuel. Aircraft elsewhere typically cost 15% to 30% more.
