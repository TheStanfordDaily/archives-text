Meet author Paul Theroux
'Cfw Monday, October 26 at 4pm
J| "An irresistible storyteller, able to hook you with his first few lines.
|_| e dazzles not just with the number of places he writes about but
the number he can evoke as if they were home."
—Chicago Tribune
"Shrewd, lively, lyrical, catty, sometimes even ecstatic."
—San Francisco Chronicle
Built around exotic landscapes, anecdotes that are revealing, humorous, and melancholy, and
three decades of mutual history, this is a very personal account of a friendship, its beginning,
middle and end. One year before he published his first book, Paul Theroux met V.S. Naipaul —
Vidia, as he was known. For thirty years both men remained in close touch, even when conti
nents separated them. They became each other's editors, confidants, and teachers. Told with
Theroux's impeccable eye for place and setting and his novelistic instinct for character and inci
dent, it is nearly without precedent in anatomizing the nature of writing as well as the nature of
friendship itself.
