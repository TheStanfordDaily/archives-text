You can also help prevent storm water pollution by doing the following:
• Service your car regularly to prevent fluid leaks, which lead to water pollution.
• When changing oil and coolant, use drip pans, collect and recycle properly.
• Instead of washing your car in the street, wash your car over a grassy area to prevent runoff or
take your car to a car wash.
• Waste water should be disposed to the sanitary sewer not the storm drain.
• Dispose of trash properly; small debris adds up to big pollution!
