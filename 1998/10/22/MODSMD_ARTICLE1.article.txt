### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Tonight at 9 p.m., victims of sexual assault and their
supporters will join in White Plaza for "Take Back the
Night," a candlelight vigil and march around campus.
The group will travel around the dorms and the Main
Quad, highlighting areas that are high risk and areas that
were previous locations of sexual assault.
"We'll go to Lake Lag, which is typically not well lit,"
said Marian Hammond, co-director of the Coalition
Against Sexual Assault, the group sponsoring the march.
"We'll also go to the middle of the row, where a lot of up
perclassmen live, and to Stern to represent frosh houses."
Hammond also noted that Stern was the site of a sex
ual assault last fall, when a woman was attacked in Casa
Zapata.
The march will "end up in the Main Quad with testi
ii.v lis and affirmation and an open discussion," said
Hammond. A reception at the Women's Center will fol
low.
Fifth-year senior Mary Kathryn Harcomb remembers
that the testimonials deeply affected her when she at
tended as a freshman.
"People really open up and tell about their own expe
riences," Harcomb said. "It's amazing for me to hear peo
ple talk about it, and to talk about how important having
a safe place is."
Harcomb, who organized the vigil three years ago, de
cries the complacent attitude of Stanford students.
"We think that it couldn't happen to us here at Stan
ford. but it's not true," she said.
This year, "Take Back the Night" is encouraging the
participation of both men and women, a change from the
female-only focus of the last several years.
"We work to bring men into it, because it's an impor
tant focus for us to get everyone involved," said Ham
mond.
Another reason for involving men is to ward off occa
sions like last year, when several fraternity members
heckled the marchers, according to Harcombe.
