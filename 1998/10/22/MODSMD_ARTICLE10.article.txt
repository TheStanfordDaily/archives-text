## Clinton signs budget 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With little fanfare. Presi
dent Clinton signed a $520 billion spending package
Wednesday that by early estimates came in about $30
billion more than envisioned in last year's budget-bal
ancing deal. Lawmakers shipped the measure to the
White House as the 105 th Congress faded into history.
In its last major vote of 1998, the Senate approved
the 4,(XX)-page bill by 65-29, then sorted through a final
stack of minor items and left town for the year. The
House was also poised to leave — but still planned to
pursue its inquiry into Clinton's possible impeachment
after the Nov. 3 elections.
Clinton said of the bill, "There's a lot of little things
tucked away there that I wish weren't in that budget."
But he added that "on balance, it honors our values and
strengthens our country and looks to the future."
The bill covers nearly one-third of the federal bud

get for fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1. Using various
accounting maneuvers, lawmakers were able to cram
even more spending into it than last year's balanced
budget agreement was designed to accommodate.
They and Clinton designated $21 billion as emer
gency spending, which means it will be paid for out of
expected federal surpluses. This includes aid for farm
ers, heightened security at U.S. embassies, keeping U.S.
peacekeepers in Bosnia and other programs.
The lawmakers also avoided budget caps for this
year by designating at least $8.4 billion of mostly edu
cation spending for fiscal 2(XX), according to prelimi
nary Congressional Budget Office figures provided by
Senate budget aides.
While lawmakers have long used this practice, the
$8.4 billion is more than twice the $4 billion that budget
writers last year designated for 1999.
