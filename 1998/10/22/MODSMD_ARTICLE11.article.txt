QUEENSTOWN, Md. (AP) — The Clinton admin
istration crafted fresh security proposals Wednesday in
an effort to salvage Mideast peace talks, but an Israeli
spokesman said, "We are packing our bags."
With the atmosphere souring on the seventh day of
the talks, Israel and the Palestinians exchanged accusa
tions on which side was responsible for the slow
progress in concluding a land-for-peace accord.
And yet, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat tele
phoned 49th birthday congratulations to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and urged him to stay
on.
Ahmed Tibi, a close adviser to Arafat, said he had
delivered flowers to Netanyahu in Arafat's behalf.
Turning grave at a news conference in English,
Hebrew and Arabic, Tibi said the Palestinians had

already accepted the U.S. recommendations. "We are
waiting for a yes from the Israelis," he said.
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said a
U.S. document, combining understandings already
reached by the two sides and U.S. suggestions to bridge
remaining differences, would be given to Israel and the
Palestinians later in the day.
"We are at a key moment in the history of the Mid
dle East peace process," he said.
Almost immediately after Rubin spoke to reporters,
Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Netanyahu, said the
Israeli delegation had a "timetable" for departure
Wednesday night.
As to whether the Israelis would leave, Rubin said,
"We're prepared to facilitate anyone's departure.
We're not holding anyone against their will."
