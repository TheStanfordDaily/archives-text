Overseas Studies correctly
addresses concerns with
potential Beijing program

TII1 ; . PRAYERS OF many Stanford
students may soon be answered if
the University succeeds in establish
ing a study program in Beijing. An oppor
tunity to study such an important place
firsthand would be absolutely invaluable.
In addition, this is a period when the
world's largest nation is transforming itself.
Students of today will be one day be writing
the history of this period, and a program in
Beijing would give them a chance to write it
as eyewitnesses.
I lowever, the Overseas Studies Program
still has a difficult job ahead before anyone
can start booking plane tickets. The office is
still negotiating with Beijing's University of
Peking over some very important issues.
On these issues, we believe the program is
taking the correct stand, and we applaud its
insistence on certain vital principles.
First, as Russell Berman, the director of
the Overseas Studies Program, has made
clear, starting an academic program in
China is not, and should not be, a political
statement, given the importance of the aca
demic work to be done.
Having Americans study in China isn't
simply a matter of providing them with
interesting travel stories and filling photo
albums. American studies of China's histo
ry and culture are a vital part of how the
world understands a country that includes
almost 20 percent of its inhabitants. In
order for that essential work to be done,
those who do it require firsthand experi
ence of the nation and its people.
If we allow our judgements about

China's current political state to prevent us
from studying that country properly, then
our judgements will increasingly be made
from a position of ignorance. If we send stu
dents to Beijing, that doesn't mean we
approve or disapprove of the regime. What
it means is that we want our opinions to be
better informed.
While the OSP is correctly keeping poli
tics out of the decision, there remains an
important academic question that must be
answered before there can be a meaningful
Stanford-in-Beijing.
As Berman has noted, there's always
been a tricky issue in the negotiations with
the Chinese university over curriculum con
trol and ensuring that what is taught in Bei
jing will be of a comparable academic cal
iber to what the students would receive
here in Palo Alto.
This issue is going to come up any time
the University wants to start an overseas
program, and guaranteeing academic free
dom is an important part of it. The position
set forth by Berman is the only responsible
one for the University to take:
"We will not have a Stanford program
anywhere in the world where we can't have
academic freedom, period."
For a Beijing program, academic free
dom is going to be more than a hypothetical
issue. It appears that the Overseas Studies
Program has found a way to resolve it satis
factorily.
If, however, that turns out not to be true,
then the University would be perfectly cor
rect in refusing to attach this University's
name to a program that wouldn't provide a
Stanford education. Students shouldn't
consider the Beijing program in any way a
done deal, or think that they have a promise
from the University to provide them with
an opportunity that may not yet exist.
