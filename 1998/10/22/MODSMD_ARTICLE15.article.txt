## How to pass basic facial training 
### 
This one s for
the guys out there.
You ladies can
read, too, but when I say
"you" in this column, I'm
talking to those of you
with the Y chromosome;
you with the natural aver-

sions to clothes shopping, you with the
macho, extra-low "can't sound like a girl"
voices, the ones with the recently developed
opposable thumbs. Fellas, listen up.
Today I'm talking about face masks. Not
the Halloween, hockey or masquerade ball
kind — your mother's face masks. I'm talk
ing about deep-cleaning, invigorating, mois
turizing, exfoliating, name-your-adjective
face masks. Facial masks.
To be completely honest, I like facials.
They're healthy, relatively quick and you
can check e-mail while wearing them.
Apparently, I'm not alone. Last week my
dorm held its inaugural Facial Night, and of
the 30 or so people who attended, more
than 20 were guys. Not mocking or jeering
guys, mind you. These fellas were willing
participants, and had a great — if not
cleansing — time. Men, if you follow these
simple steps, I think you will too.
Step One: Pre-Treatment
The first step in correctly cleaning your
face is, well, cleaning your face. Don't ask
me why the whole process doesn't end here.
Apparently, nothing is clean enough after
only one wash.
If only Housing and Dining Services
adopted that same maxim with its silver
ware.
Anyway, clean your face with a store
bought or friend-borrowed face wash. You
don't need one of those bathroom "poof

balls" or anything; hands are fine. Like you
would with shampoo, simply wet, lather,
rinse and repeat if necessary (chances are,
guys, it will be).
Step Two: Mask Application
This is when it gets fun. As a mask-wear
er, you have two options — wash-off or
peel-off — both of which have distinct
advantages. The peel-off mask is fun in its
horror movie-esque removal, hence the
name. The wash-off is typically a funky
color (green is popular) and provides an
excellent photo opportunity. However, this
mud-based mask takes anywhere from 10 to
15 minutes to "set," thus giving you ample
time to be seen by fraternity members, var
sity athletes or any other specimens of Stan
ford machismo. If you happen to be caught
by one of these "manlier-than-thou" exam
ples, just grit your teeth and smile. These
guys'll be envious of your face at the next
frat party, anyway.
Step Three: Mask Removal
Regardless of the mask you choose, it
takes some effort to get it off. The peel-off,
though easy in theory, usually requires a
light wash to fully eliminate. The wash-off
mask, which is little more than caked-on
mud, necessitates some heavy duty cleans
ing. If you've got a wire brush or any steel
wool around, this might be a good time to
break it out.
Step Four Cool Down
Thought you were finished? Sit your ass
back down — we're just getting started.
This, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, is
the Wintergreen Step. Grab your bottle of
astringent (really just peppermint-smelling
alcohol), pick up a cotton ball and wipe

down your face. While removing any linger
ing mask elements, the poisoned alcohol
should get rid of any bacteria (or nearby frat
guys) still hanging around. Be careful,
though. As any woman knows, this step can
burn. «
Step Five: Moisture-Ize, Ize, Baby
Of all the things with which you will
leave Spa Night, perhaps nothing is more
important than hydrated skin. Indeed, tb
adequately finish off, you must maintaih
your face's new luster. After patting dry
(always pat, never rub), apply a small
amount of lotion to your face until the
greasy feeling subsides. "Non-comode
genic" lotion is ideal, for it protects you
from blackheads and inflamed lesions, espe
cially, according to www.clearasil.com, in
the T-zones — "those areas where
always seem to be lurking."
With completion of this final step, you've
successfully made it through basic facial
training. Ideally, this will also empower you
to open yourself — and your heart —to
your inherent feminine side. It will permit
you a glimpse into the world of the opposite
sex, break down long-established gend.er
barriers and reveal just how similar men
and women really are. Let's get rid of the
divisions our society has made, and end this
silly gender war. Can't we all just get along?
Please?
Well, if not, at least we'll get our faces
pretty clean, right? Chicks dig that, anyway.

John Davi, a senior majoring in public pol
icy, knows that shaving is equivalent' to
exfoliating. He embarks on his Fraternity
Facial Tour this weekend — catch him in
action at Theta Delt, Sigma Chi and SAB.
