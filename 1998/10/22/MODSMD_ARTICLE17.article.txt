Ketterling writes fiction
Thoughtful journalism, or even thought
less journalism—even thoughtful writing
about actual events — should always be
founded in some sort of factual context.
Otherwise it isn't serious writing, and can be
taken as a joke. Casey Ketterling's creative
writing piece in yesterday's Daily, however,
was not very funny — especially his state
ment referring to the recent incident at Phi
Delta Theta, which claimed that "(l|etting
[Mr. Howard] lay on the ground for six
hours was no accident."
Was it then intentional? Although Ket
terling proclaimed it numerous times, the
notion that we would knowingly leave a
friend outside in such a situation is prepos
terous. It is not surprising, however, after
noting the dissemination of misinformation
that currently seems to be quite the rage on
campus.
Not only did the Stanford administration
allow the media to claim numerous times
that Phi Delt threw a big party Friday night
where "alcohol was served," (there was no
party, and no alcohol was served) but the
Daily and Kettcrling threw around state
ments that were spoken like fact but which
in reality are quite fanciful. The bottom line

is that nobody knows exactly when the acci
dent took place.
The fateful time of 2:30 am is actually the
last time anyone saw Mr. Howard (when he
and everyone else was proceeding to bed),
not when the accident occurred. If anyone
had attempted to look at doctor's estimates
he or she would have found that the acci
dent more likely transpired at around 4 or 5
a.m. What does this mean? That perhaps
after everyone had gone to sleep Mr.
Howard got up and went out to the deck.
Again, I stress the word 'perhaps' because,
quite simply, nobody knows. Only when
Mr. Howard is allowed to speak to us about
the true nature of the events that evening
will anyone know what occurred. Any state
ment claiming knowledge otherwise is the
product of an active imagination.
Ketterling's article is thus rooted in what
is currently an imagined scenario — that
Mr. Howard waited six hours until someone
decided to finally help him. Incidentally
Kettcrling and the rest of the media also
forgot to mention that Mr. Howard was
found early in the morning by a Phi Delt
who happened to be a member of the Santa
Clara County Search and Rescue Team —
one of the most capable students on cam
pus to be in such a situation.
President Jackson Wagcner stated so

eloquently and succinctly numerous times
after the accident that "right now our only
concern is for Mike and his health." It
always was, and it still is. Kctterling asking
us to provide a more sincere gesture to
everyone shows much of the "lack of class"
to which he so eagerly referred to in his let
ter.
Kctterling also pointed towards Mr. Blu
menstein's column, asking for an explana
tion of the night's events. Again, if he had
fulfilled any sort of literary obligation, he
could have read the police report and
quenched his worries. It claimed that this
was an accident and no further investigation
was necessary. Should Mr. Blumenstein be
responsible for repeating that statement
after the Daily has already done so in its
report on the incident?
Everything aside, however, I admit that I
would probably love to have Kctterling as a
friend. Does he regularly make sweeps of
his dormitory at 5 a.m. (the inside halls and
the outside perimeter), after everyone has
already gone to bed, for individuals and
good friends who may have had awful acci
dents? I certainly hope so, otherwise his let
ter simply makes him out to be a hypocrite,
and I am sure that isn't the case.
To finish then, Mr. Ketterling, I must
concede that your melodramatic story is a

great piece of fiction. But please, before you
have gathered all the proper evidence, don't
attempt to influence the popular opinion of
intelligent individuals. Reading such drivel
insults not only Phi Delt, but the Stanford
student body as a whole.

First Amendment questioned
In response to David Stein's column.
Rev. Meier wrote that free speech "does
not permit us to say anything we want, any
where we want." While this is true and nec
essary for a viable society, it brings up the
question of whether the overly publicized
and acknowledged freedom of speech is
indeed free.
It is not about what free speech should
consist of, but whether free speech is indeed
an inherent right, as people who hug the
First Amendment daily would like to
believe, or whether it is just something
defined and artificial. "Of course freedom
of speech is a right, it is written in the Bill of
Rights," you might say. But how free is
something if it is qualified whenever the
court is in session? Is it still a right?

It seems that too many people are cling
ing onto the belief that just because the First
Amendment guarantees it, it is the indh'icj
ual's obligation to exercise the right to the
fullest extent with the reasoning that if it is
left alone for a moment, it would disappear.
This thinking undermines the competence
of individuals to judge for themselves, and Jt
encourages people to say or do anything as
long as it is legally permissible as opposed to
what is right as determined by an individu
al's conscience.
Maybe the deciding factor for saying
something should rest in the old rule of
Don t say anything you might regret
later." This regret should not simply be due
to judgment by the laws or by our peers, but
by some qualities inside us, some things
called conscience and guilt, which I sincere
ly hope we all have and hold onto tightly.
And if you happen to lack this, too bad; the
only remedy is to hold up a sign saying so
before a large crowd. I am sure they wiil
understand.
If thoughts and expressions were filtered
through our heart first, there would be nb
need for the First Amendment to entitle us
to speak freely. The guarantee will still be
there, but it will only be for insurance puj
p6ses. Only then will speech regain its free
dom to become, once again, our inherent
'right.

Body image concerns abound
~As the coordinators for the student
■group Body Image, Food and Self Esteem
(BIFSE), we would like to voice our con
cerns about the Daily article that
appeared on Tuesday, Oct. 20.
, , First, it would appear that the reporter
x and editor assigned to the article were
either grossly ignorant about the issue at
hand, or incapable of the task assigned
them. The article lacked any background
details, history about our organization or
general information about the prevalence
of body image-related issues on the Stan
ford campus or in our society at large.
Second, we take issue with the way in
which members of BIFSE were quoted
completely out of context, contorting the

meaning of their comments and their atti
tudes about body image and eating disor
der problems in general.
Third, the placement of this article (on
the second-to-last page) and the obvious
editing oversights simply served to rein
force the virtual non-priority stance that
the Stanford community has taken with
respect to this subject in general.
We at BIFSE would like to remind not
only the Stanford Daily but also the entire
Stanford community that body image
problems and eating disorders are present
on the campus in epidemic proportions
and that ignoring this problem will not
make it go away. Neither will slighting
organizations like BIFSE that have
worked hard to get this message out. We
hope that in the future the Daily and all
Stanford organizations will take the time
and attention to detail that this problem
deserves.

Athletics Department still
plays by own rules
I read in the Daily Tuesday that the
Athletics Department declined to divulge
the salaries of its many coaches. Am I the
only one outraged by this? The Athletics
Department at Stanford has a long and
illustrious career of thumbing its nose at
the larger community, without cost, it
seems.
While there are certainly many athletes
among us who are bright students and
good citizens, I can think of several who
are a far cry from the scholars Stanford
purports to admit. Not only are many of
them nearly failing their courses, despite
the existence of special tutoring programs
provided for them, but these athletes are
rude, uninterested in campus life, and
often destructive. Some things I have
known such athletes to do are: throw fur
niture from balconies, throw plates as
Frisbees from high places, drop toasters
out windows, drive golf carts into bike
racks, and other fun, intelligent, construc

tive activities.
Aside from the problems these athletes
create for their housemates in property
damage and destruction, Stanford athletes
have been found responsible for some of
the most notorious acts of violence and
criminality on campus. The "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture was attacked by four base
ball players. And don't forget about the
Athletics Department recruiter who was
caught asking for nude photos of appli
cants and charged accordingly in a court of
law. To add insult to injury, at least one of
those baseball players did not get the lull
season suspension he should have gotten
based on the Athletics Department's poli
cies. Instead, they bent the rules for him,
and he sat out one lousy game. That'll
teach him.
In light of the recent trend of fraternity
alcohol violations, I'd also be very inter
ested to know the percentage of fraternity
members who are athletes on Stanford's
teams. Perhaps we would have fewer
problems with our fraternities it the Ath
letics Department was more willing to

take its athletes' behavior seriously.
What is even more shocking is that
despite Stanford's policy to give aid only
on a need basis, and despite the wealth of
their families, many of these athletes are
fully funded to "study" here. Meanwhile, a
significant portion of Stanford students
work, some of them full time, to support
their education here. Why is the Athletics
Department exempt from Stanford's poli
cy on aid?
Tuesday's news was yet another exam
ple of how the Athletics Department has
made a habit of assuming that the rules of
the University do not apply to its policies
or its students. And has gotten away with
it. The department would not to divulge
the salaries of its many coaches, while
even the president has done so. Why not?
Does it have yet another embarrassment
to hide from students and the University
at large?

writing piece in yesterday's Daily, however,
was not very funny — especially his state
ment referring to the recent incident at Phi
Delta Theta, which claimed that "(l|etting
[Mr. Howard] lay on the ground for six
hours was no accident."
Was it then intentional? Although Ket
terling proclaimed it numerous times, the
notion that we would knowingly leave a
friend outside in such a situation is prepos
terous. It is not surprising, however, after
noting the dissemination of misinformation
that currently seems to be quite the rage on
campus.
Not only did the Stanford administration
allow the media to claim numerous times
that Phi Delt threw a big party Friday night
where "alcohol was served," (there was no
party, and no alcohol was served) but the
Daily and Kettcrling threw around state
ments that were spoken like fact but which
in reality are quite fanciful. The bottom line

is that nobody knows exactly when the acci
dent took place.
The fateful time of 2:30 am is actually the
last time anyone saw Mr. Howard (when he
and everyone else was proceeding to bed),
not when the accident occurred. If anyone
had attempted to look at doctor's estimates
he or she would have found that the acci
dent more likely transpired at around 4 or 5
a.m. What does this mean? That perhaps
after everyone had gone to sleep Mr.
Howard got up and went out to the deck.
Again, I stress the word 'perhaps' because,
quite simply, nobody knows. Only when
Mr. Howard is allowed to speak to us about
the true nature of the events that evening
will anyone know what occurred. Any state
ment claiming knowledge otherwise is the
product of an active imagination.
Ketterling's article is thus rooted in what
is currently an imagined scenario — that
Mr. Howard waited six hours until someone
decided to finally help him. Incidentally
Kettcrling and the rest of the media also
forgot to mention that Mr. Howard was
found early in the morning by a Phi Delt
who happened to be a member of the Santa
Clara County Search and Rescue Team —
one of the most capable students on cam
pus to be in such a situation.
President Jackson Wagcner stated so

eloquently and succinctly numerous times
after the accident that "right now our only
concern is for Mike and his health." It
always was, and it still is. Kctterling asking
us to provide a more sincere gesture to
everyone shows much of the "lack of class"
to which he so eagerly referred to in his let
ter.
Kctterling also pointed towards Mr. Blu
menstein's column, asking for an explana
tion of the night's events. Again, if he had
fulfilled any sort of literary obligation, he
could have read the police report and
quenched his worries. It claimed that this
was an accident and no further investigation
was necessary. Should Mr. Blumenstein be
responsible for repeating that statement
after the Daily has already done so in its
report on the incident?
Everything aside, however, I admit that I
would probably love to have Kctterling as a
friend. Does he regularly make sweeps of
his dormitory at 5 a.m. (the inside halls and
the outside perimeter), after everyone has
already gone to bed, for individuals and
good friends who may have had awful acci
dents? I certainly hope so, otherwise his let
ter simply makes him out to be a hypocrite,
and I am sure that isn't the case.
To finish then, Mr. Ketterling, I must
concede that your melodramatic story is a

great piece of fiction. But please, before you
have gathered all the proper evidence, don't
attempt to influence the popular opinion of
intelligent individuals. Reading such drivel
insults not only Phi Delt, but the Stanford
student body as a whole.

First Amendment questioned
In response to David Stein's column.
Rev. Meier wrote that free speech "does
not permit us to say anything we want, any
where we want." While this is true and nec
essary for a viable society, it brings up the
question of whether the overly publicized
and acknowledged freedom of speech is
indeed free.
It is not about what free speech should
consist of, but whether free speech is indeed
an inherent right, as people who hug the
First Amendment daily would like to
believe, or whether it is just something
defined and artificial. "Of course freedom
of speech is a right, it is written in the Bill of
Rights," you might say. But how free is
something if it is qualified whenever the
court is in session? Is it still a right?

It seems that too many people are cling
ing onto the belief that just because the First
Amendment guarantees it, it is the indh'icj
ual's obligation to exercise the right to the
fullest extent with the reasoning that if it is
left alone for a moment, it would disappear.
This thinking undermines the competence
of individuals to judge for themselves, and Jt
encourages people to say or do anything as
long as it is legally permissible as opposed to
what is right as determined by an individu
al's conscience.
Maybe the deciding factor for saying
something should rest in the old rule of
Don t say anything you might regret
later." This regret should not simply be due
to judgment by the laws or by our peers, but
by some qualities inside us, some things
called conscience and guilt, which I sincere
ly hope we all have and hold onto tightly.
And if you happen to lack this, too bad; the
only remedy is to hold up a sign saying so
before a large crowd. I am sure they wiil
understand.
If thoughts and expressions were filtered
through our heart first, there would be nb
need for the First Amendment to entitle us
to speak freely. The guarantee will still be
there, but it will only be for insurance puj
p6ses. Only then will speech regain its free
dom to become, once again, our inherent
'right.

Body image concerns abound
~As the coordinators for the student
■group Body Image, Food and Self Esteem
(BIFSE), we would like to voice our con
cerns about the Daily article that
appeared on Tuesday, Oct. 20.
, , First, it would appear that the reporter
x and editor assigned to the article were
either grossly ignorant about the issue at
hand, or incapable of the task assigned
them. The article lacked any background
details, history about our organization or
general information about the prevalence
of body image-related issues on the Stan
ford campus or in our society at large.
Second, we take issue with the way in
which members of BIFSE were quoted
completely out of context, contorting the

meaning of their comments and their atti
tudes about body image and eating disor
der problems in general.
Third, the placement of this article (on
the second-to-last page) and the obvious
editing oversights simply served to rein
force the virtual non-priority stance that
the Stanford community has taken with
respect to this subject in general.
We at BIFSE would like to remind not
only the Stanford Daily but also the entire
Stanford community that body image
problems and eating disorders are present
on the campus in epidemic proportions
and that ignoring this problem will not
make it go away. Neither will slighting
organizations like BIFSE that have
worked hard to get this message out. We
hope that in the future the Daily and all
Stanford organizations will take the time
and attention to detail that this problem
deserves.

Athletics Department still
plays by own rules
I read in the Daily Tuesday that the
Athletics Department declined to divulge
the salaries of its many coaches. Am I the
only one outraged by this? The Athletics
Department at Stanford has a long and
illustrious career of thumbing its nose at
the larger community, without cost, it
seems.
While there are certainly many athletes
among us who are bright students and
good citizens, I can think of several who
are a far cry from the scholars Stanford
purports to admit. Not only are many of
them nearly failing their courses, despite
the existence of special tutoring programs
provided for them, but these athletes are
rude, uninterested in campus life, and
often destructive. Some things I have
known such athletes to do are: throw fur
niture from balconies, throw plates as
Frisbees from high places, drop toasters
out windows, drive golf carts into bike
racks, and other fun, intelligent, construc

tive activities.
Aside from the problems these athletes
create for their housemates in property
damage and destruction, Stanford athletes
have been found responsible for some of
the most notorious acts of violence and
criminality on campus. The "Gay Libera
tion" sculpture was attacked by four base
ball players. And don't forget about the
Athletics Department recruiter who was
caught asking for nude photos of appli
cants and charged accordingly in a court of
law. To add insult to injury, at least one of
those baseball players did not get the lull
season suspension he should have gotten
based on the Athletics Department's poli
cies. Instead, they bent the rules for him,
and he sat out one lousy game. That'll
teach him.
In light of the recent trend of fraternity
alcohol violations, I'd also be very inter
ested to know the percentage of fraternity
members who are athletes on Stanford's
teams. Perhaps we would have fewer
problems with our fraternities it the Ath
letics Department was more willing to

take its athletes' behavior seriously.
What is even more shocking is that
despite Stanford's policy to give aid only
on a need basis, and despite the wealth of
their families, many of these athletes are
fully funded to "study" here. Meanwhile, a
significant portion of Stanford students
work, some of them full time, to support
their education here. Why is the Athletics
Department exempt from Stanford's poli
cy on aid?
Tuesday's news was yet another exam
ple of how the Athletics Department has
made a habit of assuming that the rules of
the University do not apply to its policies
or its students. And has gotten away with
it. The department would not to divulge
the salaries of its many coaches, while
even the president has done so. Why not?
Does it have yet another embarrassment
to hide from students and the University
at large?

Ketterling writes fiction
Thoughtful journalism, or even thought
less journalism—even thoughtful writing
about actual events — should always be
founded in some sort of factual context.
