## The 						challenge of tolerating intolerance

Robin Moroney

YOU CAN ONLY tolerate what
you hate. Everything else is simply
a matter of not complaining about
NVjjjfat you already agree with or what you
particularly care about.
-At Stanford tolerance is made so very
that one wonders what horror it is that
wt; are actually tolerating. We can survey
the various ethnic and cultural centers, the
vy t i<Je bundle of religions, the diversity of
pLhnic categories on display on our way to
class and, giving a sort of liberal benedic
tion, announce, "1 tolerate you and I toler
ate you," congratulating ourselves on a
gopd day's tolerance.
, But the easy machinery of tolerance
tfiat Stanford provides should give us cause
fpij concern. The whole point of tolerance
js that it is so difficult; tolerance without
discomfort is as remarkable as a naked per
son with clothes on. Tolerance without dis
comfort is barely tolerance at all.
We have made tolerance on this campus
easy because we have managed to silence
wfiat we truly, madly, deeply disagree with,
regardless of its legitimacy as a viewpoint.
Then we tolerate whatever noise remains.

A friend confided to me last year that
he voted for Prop. 209. I repeat, confided,
because he knew that if people found out
he would be stigmatized as a racist. Per
haps my friend was wrong on this issue, but
he was certainly no racist. Where did the
stigma come from?
The answer. 1 think, is intolerance, pure
and simple. The charge of racism was a
silencing tool. Affirmative action (unlike,
dare I say it, religion) is an intensely impor
tant issue on this campus. Those who agree
with it do so passionately and find it hard
to tolerate those who are against it.
Saying that those opposed to affirma
tive action were racist was an act of intol
erance. This was not achieved through any
official institution, but rather through a
tacit assumption that permeated every dis
cussion of the issue. People were free to
voice their opinions but ran the risk of
being labeled racist. In this way an entire
side of the argument was effectively elimi
nated from the debate. It was not tolerat
ed, it was eliminated.
Stanford students have become very
good at silencing what they don't want to

hear.
Stanford's speech code from 199() to
1995 and the silencing of (not just hostility
towards) right-wing views should not be a
point of pride for those on the left at this
campus.
At a grapes boycott debate 1 attended,
the audience composed mostly of Stanford
students effectively shouted down any
views that they hadn't come to hear.
Last year Aly Remtulla wrote a column
questioning how much of Israel's history
was cause for celebration. The response
was predictable. One letter, that went
unpublished, happily equated his views
with anti-Semitism.
The Stanford Review is another institu
tion that suffers from grass-roots intoler
ance, giving it the absurd ability to claim
victim status. It's an easy and frequent tar
get for bashing during conversation. More
disturbingly, twice in the past four years
(once in Casa Zapata, the other in Arroyo)
resident fellows have decided to protect
residents from possible conservative politi
cal influence by actively preventing the
Review from delivering issues to their

dorms.
Of course, some of the Review's pieces
are fairly repugnant and themselves rep
resent intolerance. Last year, Thorvin
Anderson wrote that he has dealt with "a
veritable circus side-show of perverts,
weirdos and political malcontents" while
at Stanford. "Perverts," it turns out.
refers to gays. I have no idea whom
Anderson was classifying as "weirdos,"
but "political malcontents" refers to
everyone except Anderson, who was so
content about Stanford politics that he
described it later in the piece as "down
right subversive."
But, it's no good simply to ignore
Anderson or to pretend that he thinks the
way he does only because he is a buffoon.
Refute his arguments because they are
wrong. Don't simply dismiss them by pre
tending that they are motivated purely by
ignorance or hatred. To do so is to be intol
erant. Why bother allowing people to have
a voice if you already intend not to listen to
them? To be intolerant of intolerance does
no good at all.
The Review is a laughable institution

but no more so than the extreme reactions
that it provokes. It's just a tabloid, written
by undergraduates who like to be outra
geous. It's not Hitler. Lately, it's even
become disappointingly respectable.
I realize that if I had said in Germany in
1933, "Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
tolerance without discomfort; despicable
as the Nazis are, we must tolerate them,"
that by 1937, I would not only look very
stupid but also very shot in the head. Tol
erance is not a universal good.
But surely we can tolerate at least the
ideas, if not the acts, that we find repug
nant, rather than remove them entirely. It's
in this sort of atmosphere where the real
homophobes and racists become invisible
and unreachable, surfacing only to leave
hateful graffiti such as that found on the
Toyon Eating Club walls last year.
It is in our interest to keep the things we
hate visible rather than to hide them and
let them hurt us in silence.
