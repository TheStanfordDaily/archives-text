## Not the leaders of this PAC Arizona State, Stanford football squads meet tonight 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Call it what you will — beleaguered, bewildered,
driven time and again off course. All these things de
scribe the Stanford football team. But disappointing?
Not really.
Entering this season, the first words out of the
media guide were various combinations of the words
"young" and "inexperienced."

FOOTBALL

■ Tonight: Stanford (1-5 overall, 0-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) at Arizona State (2-4,1-2), 7 p.m.. Sun Devil Stadi
um. RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM), KTCT (1050 AM). TV:
Fox Sports Net, Live.

When 22 lettermcn graduate and just five seniors
return, a team is not expected to be in Rose Bowl con
tention.
Thus, it is no great surprise that the Cardinal sits
winless in the Pacific 10 Conference, as well as with a
1-5 overall record.
That separates it a from tonight's opponent, the
Arizona State Sun Devils. But just by a bit.
ASU, ranked Bth in the preseason AP poll, now
finds itself unranked after stumbling to a 1-2 record in

the Pac-10 and a 2-4 overall record.
"I don't know what's broken down for them," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham. "In a couple
of cases, I think they just ran out of time. But they are
still a very good ballclub."
The Sun Devils primary threat comes out of the
backfield, where junior tailback J.R. Redmond en
tered the season touted as a Heisman Trophy candi
date. Redmond ran all over USC, two weeks ago, for
214 yards rushing on 33 carries, both career highs, as
well as one touchdown. His 350 all-purpose yards
against the Trojans boosted him to first in the confer
ence and fourth in the nation in total yardage, while
standing second in the conference in rushing and
fourth in punt returns.
"He is a very good back," Willingham said. "Look
ing at the conference, he is probably one that we would
say is at the top of the list."
The Stanford front four will have to shut down Red
mond if it is to give the vulnerable Cardinal secondary
any chance.
"1 think our defense is becoming more pursuit-ori
ented, and that's a sign of progress," Willingham said.
"We've had a good effort. The most important thing
we see now is getting our defense to the point of at-

from seeing action tonight, special
team maestro Lucius Brock will get
his first start in the backfield.
"Coy could possibly be out for
the season." Willingham said.
"What Coy gave us was versatility
and there are some things we'll
have to adjust with him out."
Another special teamer fighting
his way onto the field, though, is
cover man Frank Primus.
The lone bright spot in last
week's special teams debacle,
Primus will back up Carter at the
cornerback position. The senior
downed a Kevin Miller punt deep
in Beaver territory, managing to
jump back from the end zone to
catch the ball in midair at the OSU
one-yard line.
"Frank has been very good at
downing the ball inside the oppo
nent's five, 10-yard line." Willing

ham said.
"That's a tribute to the kicker, I
think," he added. "Frank is doing a
great job, you just need to be able
to take advantage."

Starting center Grey Ruegamer
has become something of a media
darling due primarily to some in
teresting hobbies and quotable
one-liners.
"I just do my own thing."
Ruegamer said.
According to head coach Bruce
Snyder, the senior is a man of in
herent contradictions.
"He's compassionate but mean,
polite but vulgar, bright but he can
do silly things." Snyder said. "I'm
going to miss him because he's col
orful."
Kickoff at Sun Devil Stadium,
tonight, is at 7 p.m.
