## Not the leaders of this PAC Arizona State, Stanford football squads meet tonight 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Call it what you will — beleaguered, bewildered,
driven time and again off course. All these things de
scribe the Stanford football team. But disappointing?
Not really.
Entering this season, the first words out of the
media guide were various combinations of the words
"young" and "inexperienced."

■ Tonight: Stanford (1-5 overall, 0-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) at Arizona State (2-4,1-2), 7 p.m.. Sun Devil Stadi
um. RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM), KTCT (1050 AM). TV:

When 22 lettermcn graduate and just five seniors

against the Trojans boosted him to first in the confer
ence and fourth in the nation in total yardage, while
standing second in the conference in rushing and
fourth in punt returns.
"He is a very good back," Willingham said. "Look

The Stanford front four will have to shut down Red
mond if it is to give the vulnerable Cardinal secondary
any chance.
