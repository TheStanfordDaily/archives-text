• J Tuesday's match against No. 10
Pacific wasn't the prettiest win. but
fcfmford bounced back from weak
Cltnd and fourth games to pick up
Ok win. It might not have been
Mmplctely dominating, as the
{Jam has looked in past years, but it
definitely resilient.
•! And that's the best sign.
« j Occasional bad play doesn't
£$ep this team down. One poor set
isji't going to dishearten the squad,
liiey just suck it up and get the job
ifne.

It's been the same story through
out my three years on the Farm.
Death, taxes and Stanford volley
ball. You ean set your watch by it.
And the stone keeps rolling.
For the first time in nine seasons,
the Cardinal didn't come into a year
as the team to beat in the Pacific 10
Conference. That analytical error
was quickly rebuffed as the Cardinal
downed league-favorite IJSC in the
league opener. Already 9-0 in the
conference this year, the team has
amassed a 44-1 league record since
19%.
Hut with names like Folkl and
Lisa Sharplev gone, the team had to
look for a new floor leader.
The mantle of leadership has
fallen upon Kerri Walsh and she's
handled the reins beautifully.
Knowing the kind of competitor
that Walsh is, this shouldn't come as
a surprise to anyone.
But considering that Walsh's
name has become synonymous with
the terms "off-season surgery" and
"shoulder injury," you can't help
hut be a little surprised. You almost
get the feeling that her arm could
just tall off and she'd still rack up 20-
plus kills per match.
And while she might get most of
the publicity, there's still a team he
hind her.
Entering this week. Jaimi Grego
ry — the other junior outside hitter
led the team in digs. Sophomore
Robyn Lewis has done an excellent
job of replacing Sharpley at the set
ter position, but she is definitely
helped by the fact that Walsh and
sophomore middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer rank one and two. respec
tively. in the conference in hitting
percentage.
It's like dishing off assists to
Michael Jordan — he's not going to
let you down too often.
It's a unit that is similar to the
cross country "Machine". The sys
tem doesn't change, just the parts.
Head coach Don Shaw has won
over 90 percent of his conference
matches and is the only person to
ever win 200 total matches in the
Pac-10: he's never let the graduation
of one or two or even five players
stop him.
And this team is perhaps the hest
example of that. Lewis replaces
Sharpley. a hunch of freshmen re
place everyone else who left. The
team keeps on winning, the Stan
ford community as a whole notices
no letdown in the production of its
team, everything works perfectly.

Ihe World Series is over, the NBA is
locked out, Los Angeles litis no fool
hall learn, and (HI Lopez just quit
smoking. Its going to he a rough
quarter.
