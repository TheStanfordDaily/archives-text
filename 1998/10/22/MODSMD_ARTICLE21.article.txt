WOMEN'S GOLF

■ Friday-Sunday: Stanford attempts
to defend its title in the Stanford/
Pepsi Women's Intercollegiate
Tournament, Stanford Golf Course.

Stanford will compete against
19 other teams, including 10 of the
top 25 teams in the nation. Also,
nine of the top 25 nationally ranked
individual women will compete on
the Stanford Golf Course during
the three-day, 54-hole event.
The nation's top-ranked indi
vidual, USC's Jennifer Rosales,
will play in the tournament after
winning the Pacific 10 Conference
title last season. Defending NCAA
team champion Arizona State,
ranked third in the nation, is also
participating.
With the tournament running
from tomorrow through Sunday,
play lasts all day and tee times

begin at 8 a.m on both Friday and
Saturday and 8:30 a.m on Sunday.
The Cardinal returns to the
Stanford golf course as defending
champions of the tournament.
Sophomore Hilary Homeyer en
ters having to defend the individual
title that she claimed last year at
the tournament. Junior Jae Jean
Ro also played well, at last season's
tournament, placing fourth with a
career best score 217 during the
three days.
"We can easily defend our title if
we play to our potential," Homey
er said. "1 don't have any personal
expectations [but] 1 am just going
to give it the best that 1 have."
The four other Cardinal com
petitors in the tournament last year
all placed within the top 25.
Stephanie Keever and Michelle
Sperry tied for 13th, while Julie
Dunn tied for 18th and Jessica Bel
skis tied for 22nd.
This season, however, the Car
dinal might have a bit more compe
tition.
Of the 19 teams that will play in
Stanford's tournament, all of 10 of
the conference teams will be in at
tendance, previewing Pac-10 play
in April.
Whereas the weather during the
team's Oct. 5-7 debut at the Bama
Fall Preview in Tulsa, Okla. was

poor and led to hard conditions for
golfing, the outlook for this week
end calls for sun and clear skies.
We "are used to playing in any
thing, said Homeyer. "We will do
what we will have to do."
The team has an advantage for
repeating as champions because it
has been playing the course every
week and is used to its home
course. The only disadvantage,
however, to playing at home is that
the Cardinal might not feel that it is
in a true competitive atmosphere.
"We have a better advantage
because we have been playing the
course consistently. The greens are
a little faster which is better for us,"
Homeyer said. "We have to be
careful [though] to be conscious to
look at this weekend as a tourna
ment." 1
Stanford has been refining its
technique these past few weeks and
working on some changes since its
play in Tulsa.
Some team members have spent
time working on ball striking, while
others have been focusing on swing
changes.
Head coach Caroline O'Connor
has been working on the team's
short game since the team's season
opener in Tulsa.
In the weeks before a home
meet "it is important to break up

the course, change the tees up. and
not play the same shots every day,
O'Connor said. "We have been
stressing the importance of seeing
the target."
Overall, however. Stanford's
target is to repeat last year's tour
nament win.
