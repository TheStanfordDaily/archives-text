# Extremely hungry to be victorious
## Stanford and Pacific Tigers to battle after their long, painful road trips 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
Whether it's the ocean. In-and-
Out burgers, or the weather that
drives people back to California,
Stanford's women's field hockey
team (9-5 overall) is certainly glad

to return to the state after a poor
East Coast performance.
The Cardinal left over a week
ago to embark on a road trip to
challenge the unfamiliar teams of
the America East. Big East and Ivy
League Conferences.
Last year, during a similar East

Coast swing, Stanford won three of
four matches, losing only to Boston
College.
This past week, however, when
the Cardinal traveled East to face
some of the nation's top field hock
ey teams, it didn't come up so
luckv.

Although Stanford left the farm
with an K-2 overall record and a
five-game win streak, it has re
turned singing a much different
tune.
Wrapping up the trip on Sun
day. in an afternoon match against
Harvard, the Cardinal returned
home having beaten Vermont in
the trip's opener and losing subse
quent matches to Northeastern,
Boston College and Harvard.

"I am disappointed with what
we did on the road." said Stanford
head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We had two [very close] games
which could have gone either way,"
she added.
Now the team must focus on its
three remaining matches of the
regular season.
If the Cardinal can regain the
type of play, both offensive and de
fensive. that the team had demon
strated earlier this vear, the season
