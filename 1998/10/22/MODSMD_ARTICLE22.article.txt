# Extremely hungry to be victorious
## Stanford and Pacific Tigers to battle after their long, painful road trips 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
Whether it's the ocean. In-and-
Out burgers, or the weather that
drives people back to California,
Stanford's women's field hockey
team (9-5 overall) is certainly glad

to return to the state after a poor
East Coast performance.
The Cardinal left over a week
ago to embark on a road trip to
challenge the unfamiliar teams of
the America East. Big East and Ivy
League Conferences.
Last year, during a similar East

Coast swing, Stanford won three of
four matches, losing only to Boston
College.
This past week, however, when
the Cardinal traveled East to face
some of the nation's top field hock
ey teams, it didn't come up so
luckv.

Although Stanford left the farm
with an K-2 overall record and a
five-game win streak, it has re
turned singing a much different
tune.
Wrapping up the trip on Sun
day. in an afternoon match against
Harvard, the Cardinal returned
home having beaten Vermont in
the trip's opener and losing subse
quent matches to Northeastern,
Boston College and Harvard.

"I am disappointed with what
we did on the road." said Stanford
head coach Sheryl Johnson.
"We had two [very close] games
which could have gone either way,"
she added.
Now the team must focus on its
three remaining matches of the
regular season.
If the Cardinal can regain the
type of play, both offensive and de

Stanford's field hockey team, still dominating the NorPac, will face Pacific on Saturday.
might have a satisfying end.
On Saturday, the Pacific Tigers'
desire to pave a road to the top of
the Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference will find the resolute oppo
sition of a Stanford team hungry to
reassert its dominance.
Earlier this season Stanford eas
ily defeated the Tigers, 4-1, on their
home field in Stockton, Calif.
The only disappointment of the
match for the Cardinal was giving
up a goal to junior forward Aimee
Tomasso, the first goal an oppo
nent had scored in over two weeks.
Now both teams head into the
final match-up of the season with
similar mentalities.
After the match at Brookside
Field in Stockton, both the Cardi
nal and Tigers left for their respec
tive East Coast tours.

While Stanford was trudging its
way through Boston, Pacific faced
La Salle, Pennsylvania and Rut
gers, all three resulting in losses for
the Tigers. Most recently, against
No. 20 Rutgers, Pacific lost, 7-0.
Now, both the Cardinal and
Tigers head to the field looking to
rebound.
While Stanford rests securely
atop the NorPac with a league title
already under its belt, Pacific's fate
is less certain. The Tigers are 2-1 in
NorPac play, with their only loss
coming to the Cardinal.
Even taking the road trip into
consideration, the Cardinal has
outscored its opponents, on the
season, 38-18.
If the defense can recover from
the recent setbacks, it should not be
much of a concern on Saturday.
While recording six shutouts on the
season, opponents have averaged
just 1.2 goals per game on the Car
dinal's defensive squad.
