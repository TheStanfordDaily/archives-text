What started as an effort to col
lect unused food items from cam
pus residences and dining halls and
redistribute them to local soup
kitchens has resulted in national
recognition for the Spoon Hunger
Network.
Spoon received an award last
Saturday for raising more money
than any other school during last
spring's Hunger Awareness Week.
Spoon initiated Stanford stu
- dents' involvement in Hunger
;<Awareness Week by organizing a
.'"Hunger cleanup.
* Students found people to spon
sor them to complete three hours
community service doing pro-
that the coordinators of
* .-Spoon had organized at charitable
in the Palo Alto
: ;«ftea.
The money that Spoon raised
"through this sponsorship was then
donated to purchase food supplies
Z-jbr the hungry.
Senior Meghan Higgins, a mem
* ber of Spoon, said, "Our only goal
'•\>y£as to beat Cal."
.*. % \But, to her and Spoon's sur-
the $B,(KX) they raised was
most money raised by any of

Vttpnwide.

* Hunger and Homelessness
■faicld this past Saturday in Madison,
Wis.. None of the members of
Spoon could make the trip to Wis
consin to attend the conference,
however.
Spoon was organized in 1987,
which makes it, "one of the oldest
community service groups on cam
pus," according to Higgins.
Students realized that though
the dining services on campus at

tempted to conserve food to the
best of their ability, waste was in
evitable.
According to their brochure,
"Spoon does not attempt to feed
community members by increasing
University costs, but rather chan
nels the unused food leftovers to
those who need it."
Senior Phoebe Grow said, "1
joined Spoon because 1 was a hash
er in Flo Mo and it made me upset
to see all of the food that was wast
ed."
Spoon members have tried to
make participation in theproject as
simple as possible.
When members of a Row house,
dormitory or Housing and Dining
Services decide to participate in
Spoon, they place unserved food in
plastic Spoon bags, which they
then label and bring to the freezer
room at the Haas Center for Public
Service.
This food is in turn picked up
and given to the Urban Ministry of
Palo Alto, where it is dsitributed by
the Breaking Bread Meals Pro
gram.
Last year, Spoon provided 90
percent of the food for the 450 hot
meals served every week at four
different locations in Palo Alto to
the homeless and low-income peo
ple in the area.
Spoon members also donate
their time serving up the food
which they collect at the soup
kitchens.
Sophomore Nancy Lai said she
enjoyed this aspect of the group be
cause the people served "are so ap
preciative of our efforts."
Higgins related fondly how she
had received a message on her an
swering machine thanking her for
the 300 boxed lunches she had
saved from being thrown out dur
ing Reunion Homecoming Week
end.
