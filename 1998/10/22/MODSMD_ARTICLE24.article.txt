### Lindsay Stamm Contributing writer 
; "It's like sausage, you don't want
to know what goes into it," re
marked New York Times Staff
Writer Richard Stevenson, in refer
ence to newspaper articles. But last
night he let some Stanford students
in on what goes on behind the scenes
in one of the world's most presti
gious newspaper offices.
; "Journalism is taking cross-cur
rtnts and sorting them out," Steven
son remarked. He said trying to
avoid jargon, while not being conde
scending to the reader, is his goal.
• As a front-page writer on eco
nomic policy, Stevenson said that he
assumes his readers have a general
Understanding of world events.
; Stevenson also spoke of the diffi
culty of deciphering fact from agen
da in Washington.
The single most important thing
as a reporter in Washington is to
write without the spin, according to
Stevenson. While this is demanding
as a writer, he said it is an crucial part

of the democratic process. "It's how
issues are debated and policy is
made," he said.
Stevenson emphasized that this
has become even more of an issue
today because many economists are
promoting a particular ideology. Be
sides economists, he pointed to
think tanks and academics as poten
tial sources for the facts on econom
ic policy. However, even these
sources are often slanted by some
type of agenda, he said.
As a writer, Stevenson said he
tries to provide perspective on the is
sues. In some cases he will provide
history or other background infor
mation when relating his topic to the
reader.
Stevenson said he feels that peo
ple are much more intimidated by
the subject of economics than they
should be. "Basically, it is a language
of academia that is filled with code
and jargon — it's not really all that
tough," Stevenson remarked.
The subject matter that Steven
son covers demands that he relate
his subject to the reader. He said this

has become easier to accomplish
with the recent rise of issues, such as
Social Security, which directly im
pact the lives of Americans.
Stevenson remarked there has
been a surge of interest in economics
due to the present growth of the
economy.
According to Stevenson, the re
cent fluctuation of activities in the
stock market has kept economics a
hot topic. People have a great inter
est in the subject, Stevenson ex
plained, when it involves their own
stocks.
"The $64 million question re
mains: How long will this prosperity
go on?" he posed.
In addition, Stevenson spoke
about the role the country's eco
nomic situation plays in the nation's
approval rating of the President.
Former President George Bush's
l l )92 campaign was largely over
shadowed by an economic recession
that had ended the previous spring.
Such could be the case for Al Gore,
Stevenson hypothesized, if present
economic prosperity declines.
