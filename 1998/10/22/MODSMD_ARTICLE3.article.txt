# Dunn's successor finding her role
## Tomaro will direct Orientation; Greek advisor search in winter 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
While this year's crop of fresh
men are finding their feet and get
ting settled, Susan Tomaro, the new
director of student orientation and
assistant director of student affairs,
is getting down to business.
The departure of Heather Dunn,
the woman who formerly held
Tomaro's position, left the Dean of
Student's office with what Tomaro
described as some "big shoes to fill."
Tomaro fills one of them. Since
her appointment to the job of Assis
tant Director of Student Affairs on
Oct. 1, Tomaro has filled half of
Dunn's old position.
The Office of Student Affairs has
yet to fill the other shoe. "We are
still short one and a half people,"
says Nanci Howe, assistant dean and
director of student activities. The
Office of Student Affairs is still in
the process of filling the other half of
Heather Dunn's job which focuses
mostly on Greek life, specifically
fraternities, and Tomaro's old part
time position as assistant director of
Orientation.
"We won't start the search
process until early winter quarter,"
says Howe. In the interim, Howe
and Dean of Students Marc Wais
have shared Dunn's old responsibil
ities. Howe is working with sorori
ties and unhoused fraternities while
Wais deals with the housed fraterni
ties on campus.
Howe stressed that the process of
selecting more employees for the
Office of Student Affairs will have

heavy student participation. There
will be a search committee made up
of students and staff who will screen
candidates and help decide which
ones to interview. Once the job de
scriptions for the new positions are
more clear, Howe will notify the
ASSU Nominations Commission to
pick members for the selection com
mittee.
In the interim, Susan Tomaro is
assisting Howe to compensate for
Dunn's absence. "We wish we had
five more of her," exclaimed Howe.
"I also wish we had the rest of our
staff in place, but, for now, we are
happy to have Susan here."
Tomaro was originally hired for
the part-time position of assistant di
rector of orientation. She worked
closely with Dunn as the program
ming coordinator of Orientation.
Her job utilized her journalism
background as she helped put to
gether all student publications used
during Orientation.
Of Dunn, Tomaro said "1 appre-;
ciate having been able to work with
her through an entire cycle so that I
could ask all those questions: 'What
is important? How do I get this
done? How does one plan a suc
cessful orientation?'"
Orientation Coordinator and ju
nior Melora Krebs-Carter said of
Tomaro, "She was invaluable to me
this summer," in helping to plan Ori
entation.
Tomaro's new position provides
her with many opportunities to do
her favorite thing, which is to inter
act with students. She works as an
advisor to many student organiza
tions, including the Stanford Con
cert Network, and is currently plan
ning the Holiday Crafts Fair with the
help of coworker Nancy Harris.
The bulk of Tomaro's job,
though, is focused on coordinating
and often facilitating the workshops
that come out of the Office of Stu
dent Affairs. These include the Party
Planning Workshop, the ASSU
Banking Workshop, a major events
workshop and a fundraising work
shop.
One of the areas Tomaro takes a
great deal of responsibility for is
party planning. She looks through all
of the party planning notifications
that the Office of Student Affairs re
ceives over its Web site."Depending
on the level of the party, there is an
expectation that the groups will noti
fy us," she said, "This is the best way
for us to know what is going on and
to offer support." If there were ever
an incident at a party, Tomaro would
be one of the people involved in the
follow-up investigation.
Tomaro's main goal for the work

shops is to help educate students.
She wants people to understand
"what risks they take and how to
avoid or limit those risks."
Tomaro did both her undergrad
uate and masters degree work at
Northwestern University's Medill
School of Journalism.
"Having been trained as a re
porter, I focus a lot on observation,"
she said.
Over the course of fall quarter,
she will be taking over the advisory
position for many of the student
publications on campus. "I use my
background almost every day," she
said. These skills are useful in many
situations "whether it's working with
student journalists, writing for my
own work or interacting with people
I've never met before."
The part Tomaso loves most
about her job is working with stu
dents. "I have the most fun when I'm
able to listen to their ideas, help
them brainstorm ... advise them or
collaborate with them ... I also
enjoy observing students as they
grow."
Observation is another aspect of
her reporter background that
Tomaro utilizes often. "She really
has a keen eye for not only detail but
also the big picture ... she is totally

on the ball," said Krebs-Carter of
her former boss.
Tamaro worked at the University
of Portland as the head of their Stu
dent Activities Office, and now
being on the Stanford campus is a
treat for her. "I have gotten to know
the campus slowly since February
[when she arrived to work on Orien
tation]. It has allowed me to meet
people throughout the university
and to learn what this place is
about."
But, Tomaro concedes, she still
has a long way to go simply because
of the huge difference between her
old job in Portland and her new posi
tion at Stanford.
An added bonus for Tomaro is
that her husband also works on the
Stanford campus. Mark DeLucchi is
the student development program
advisor in the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service. They met and got mar
ried while both working at the Uni
versity of Portland, and subsequent
ly moved to the Bay Area.
He started working at Stanford
last September before she began her
work on Orientation. They had no
idea they would be back working to
gether on the same campus, but
Tomaro is thrilled that they are able
to work so closely.
