# Dunn's successor finding her role
## Tomaro will direct Orientation; Greek advisor search in winter 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
While this year's crop of fresh
men are finding their feet and get
ting settled, Susan Tomaro, the new
director of student orientation and
assistant director of student affairs,
is getting down to business.
The departure of Heather Dunn,
the woman who formerly held
Tomaro's position, left the Dean of
Student's office with what Tomaro
described as some "big shoes to fill."
Tomaro fills one of them. Since
her appointment to the job of Assis
tant Director of Student Affairs on
Oct. 1, Tomaro has filled half of
Dunn's old position.
The Office of Student Affairs has
yet to fill the other shoe. "We are
still short one and a half people,"
says Nanci Howe, assistant dean and
director of student activities. The
Office of Student Affairs is still in
the process of filling the other half of
Heather Dunn's job which focuses
mostly on Greek life, specifically
fraternities, and Tomaro's old part
time position as assistant director of
Orientation.
"We won't start the search
process until early winter quarter,"
says Howe. In the interim, Howe
and Dean of Students Marc Wais
have shared Dunn's old responsibil
ities. Howe is working with sorori
ties and unhoused fraternities while
Wais deals with the housed fraterni
ties on campus.
Howe stressed that the process of
selecting more employees for the
Office of Student Affairs will have

heavy student participation. There
will be a search committee made up
of students and staff who will screen
candidates and help decide which
ones to interview. Once the job de
scriptions for the new positions are
more clear, Howe will notify the
ASSU Nominations Commission to
pick members for the selection com
mittee.
In the interim, Susan Tomaro is
assisting Howe to compensate for
Dunn's absence. "We wish we had
five more of her," exclaimed Howe.
"I also wish we had the rest of our
staff in place, but, for now, we are
happy to have Susan here."
Tomaro was originally hired for
the part-time position of assistant di
rector of orientation. She worked
closely with Dunn as the program
ming coordinator of Orientation.
Her job utilized her journalism
background as she helped put to
gether all student publications used
during Orientation.
Of Dunn, Tomaro said "1 appre-;
ciate having been able to work with
her through an entire cycle so that I
could ask all those questions: 'What
is important? How do I get this
done? How does one plan a suc
cessful orientation?'"
Orientation Coordinator and ju
nior Melora Krebs-Carter said of
Tomaro, "She was invaluable to me
this summer," in helping to plan Ori
entation.
Tomaro's new position provides
her with many opportunities to do
her favorite thing, which is to inter
