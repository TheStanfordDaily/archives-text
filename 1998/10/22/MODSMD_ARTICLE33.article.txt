## films that bring the world together The 						UNAFF festival at Stanford 
### Laura Norton Contributing Writer 
This Friday, Oct. 23 marks the opening night at
Stanford of a dynamic, first-time film festival.
And if festival director Jasmina Bojic has her
way, it won't be the last time either — she hopes to
make this an annual event.
Bringing films and filmmakers from all over the
world, the United Nations Association Film Festival
(UNAFF '98) has the promise of becoming a wonder
ful Stanford tradition. The event takes place in
Cubberley Auditorium, Annenberg Auditorium and
Bechtel International Center and will run through the
weekend.
Co-sponsored by the United Nations Association
Midpeninsula Chapter and the Stanford Film Society,
this event is a non-

competitive festival
showing over 20 out
standing documen
taries by international
filmmakers. The
films come from
countries as far rang
ing as Mongolia,
Cuba, Rwanda,
Panama, former
Yugoslavia, India,
Kenya, Peru, Tibet,
New Zealand and the
United States. The
films in the festival
deal with such topics
addressed by the
United Nations as
human rights, refugee

protection, disease
control, foreign policy changes, land mines and edu
cation for all.
The festival is planned in part to celebrate the
United Nations and the 50th anniversary of the sign
ing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Bojic said, "This festival celebrates the efforts of doc
umentary filmmakers to fight for international peace
justice and human dignity." Bojic also noted that this
festival brings the goals of the UN back to the west
coast where the UN first opened its doors in 1945.
UNA-Midpeninsula, now 35 years old, is a group
that serves as a link between the local community and
the United Nations. The mission of this non-profit
organization is to lead the community to a common
understanding of UN goals and strengthen participa
tion by bringing the UN spirit to the local communi
ties.
The Stanford Film Society is a Stanford group
made up of undergraduate and graduate students.
The group works to expand the Stanford communi
ty's awareness of film, which it believes "combines
technology and human imagination to create a for
midable cultural force worldwide."
Jasmina Bojic, a board member of both nonprofit
organizations is the force that brought them together
to fashion the film festival. "It is a great combination
of the energies of the two groups," said Bojic. That
kind of combination is found in Bojic herself. She is a
documentary filmmaker and film critic. She has also
been teaching at Stanford for eight years in Slavic
Languages and Literatures Department.
Over 50 submissions for this first UNAFF were
carefully reviewed. The jurors included Bojic, Jan
Krawitz, a professor in the Documentary Film and

Video Program, and four Stanford students. Both
Krawitz and Bojic had worked on the same jury
together at the San Francisco Film Festival and
UNAFF provided another opportunity for them to
combine their talents.
The idea for the festival was inspired largely from
Bojic's experiences as a juror for the San Francisco
International Film Festival. For six years she had
watched "fantastic films dealing with social, political
and human rights issues" and was inspired to create
an outlet specifically for documentaries she felt really
needed a place and an audience.
The opening on Friday night begins with a recep
tion at Cubberly Auditorium at 6:30 p.m. Opening
remarks will be by actor John Savage, who abandoned
Hollywood in 1988 and moved to South Africa. There
he became involved with the anti-apartheid move-

ment ana worked
with Nelson Mandela
and documentary
filmmakers. He con
tinues to promote the
cause of human
rights around the
world with docu
mentary, working in
places such as Mexico
and Eastern Europe.
A special program
at the festival will
provide a retrospec
tive of the work of
Academy-Award
winning documen
tary filmmaker
Barbara Trent. Three
of her feature docu-

mentaries will play
during the weekend: "Panama Deception" (1992),
"Coverup: Behind the Iran-Contra Affair" (1988) and
"Destination Nicaragua" (1986). Trent will be present
at all of these screenings.
Many of the ideas generated throughout the festi
val will come together at a roundtable discussion
titled "Documentary Filmmaking — A Forum For
Open Dialogue About The World." It is scheduled for
4:00 p.m. on Saturday. Invited are Jerry Aronson,
Judith Bizot, Peter Coyote, Ronny Novick, John
Savage and Barbara Trent.
Also of special interest is the film "The Life and
Times of Allen Ginsberg" whose archive, Bojic notes,
was recently bought by Stanford. The film incorpo
rates this archival footage. The filmmakers will be at
the screening and at the roundtable.
Bojic likes to quote Eleanor Roosevelt when she
discusses the mission of the festival. "The destiny of
human rights," said Roosevelt, "is in the hands of all
our citizens in all our communities." She hopes that
for Stanford students the festival will be a chance to
find out more about what's going on around the
world, a perspective she feels is lacking in the media.
Her hope is to inspire people to look further into the
subjects touched on during the three-day festival, to
get further information and to learn what is going on
around the world, to understand how decisions made
or avoided may affect the world. Ultimately, the festi
val, Bojic said, gives "documentaries and the film
makers a chance to speak about the world's problems
from the human side."
