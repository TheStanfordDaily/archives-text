Fame within popular American music is a strange
j beast. Because of Top 40 radio's primacy in the rock
J world, the public's connection with bands and artists is
J usually determined by the all-important hit single,
j However, that success can become a trap in and of
| itself — a fact evident in the concert world when signifi
j cant portions of the audiences come for one or two
! songs, which they think the groups are obligated to play.
The all-acoustic Bridge School Benefit held last week
i end at the Shoreline Ampitheatre provided an interesting
" microcosm of these conflicts. Each act's story illuminated
[ subtle variations on the virtues and limitations of fame.
Jonathan Richman, the eternal adolescent, is still rela-
J tively new to the world of fame, which is surprising con
j sidering that his work with the Modern Lovers in 1971
| deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as that of
j Lou Reed and Iggy Pop as the beginning of modern
! American rock.
Instead, Richman lived as a cult figure for nearly three
i decades and has gained notoriety only through his small,
i but distinctive, role in the recent hit movie, "There's
' Something About Mary." Naturally, Richman played the
j title track from the movie in his set, as the song was like
[ ly his ticket into the show. The instrumentation was
[ sparse, just Richman's guitar with a standing drummer,
j emphasizing the immense debt punkabilly bands such as
J the Violent Femmes owe to his work.
! Further, Richman was also able to portray some of the
! wonder and fear which defines his world. To a disarm
! ingly sweet tune, he sang, "When 1 was sue years old, I
i never dreamed I would grow up to be so lonely," which
i was perhaps the most emotionally direct statement of the
j night.
In contrast, the Wallflowers' quick path to fame has
j been a much different story. Jakob Dylan's heritage and
| the hit single "One Headlight" insured success, but the
| band's future is yet to be determined. The fact that their
! first hit sounded very much like a rewrite of Springsteen's
! "Independence Day" was not a particularly good sign.

Nonetheless, the band's set was strong, especially
Dylan's singing. "One Headlight" sounded a little hollow
in the acoustic context, but excellent covers of Neil
Young's "Don't Cry No Tears" and David Bowie's
"Heroes" spoke well of the band's strength. The question
mark, of course, is original songwriting. Dylan does seem
to have a good grasp of pathos though, suggesting that if
he is not the new Dylan, so to speak, he might be the new
Springsteen.
Like the Wallflowers, the Barenaked Ladies are
depending on a hit single to sustain the band's fame.
Unlike the Wallflowers, the band built its following the
old-fashioned way, with strong albums and relentless
touring. Although the Barenaked Ladies have been super
stars in Canada for about six years, the band didn't crack
the U.S. market until its bouncy, lite-rap single "One
Week" shot up the charts. This small opening is all the
band will need, as their live shows are irresistible, and its
back catalog, especially the creative album "Gordon," is
fantastic.
Indeed, the Barenaked Ladies earned the most enthu
siastic applause of the night, which was well deserved.
The band performed its best material well, notably "Old
Apartment," "What A Good Boy," and "Brian Wilson."
The band's on-stage banter was hilarious as usual. More
importantly, the band let everyone know it was excited to
be playing, the importance of which, as R.E.M. proved
later in the night, cannot be overstated. The Barenaked
Ladies played "One Week," of course, but closed with the
real banner song, "If I Had $1,000,000," which is begin
ning to take on new meaning as the band's star continues
to rise.
Sarah McLachlan's path to fame is a different story
altogether. Although her music is receiving increasing
airplay, her major accomplishment has been the organi
zation of Lilith Fair, the successful, all-female summer
tour, which sawily put her at the front of the female
singer-songwriter movement.
McLachlan's set, relying heavily on her recent album,
"Surfacing," was quite strong. Although she sang her sig
nature songs, "Adia," "Possession," and "Building A
Mystery," the heart of her performance consisted of the
solemn "Angel," performed with the Barenaked Ladies'
bassist and fellow Canadian, Jim Creeggan, and the gor
geous "I Love You," dedicated to a Bridge School student
named Lisa. As she had not planned to sing the song, this
dedication speaks strongly of her dedication to her fans.
The next act, Phish, is perhaps a little too dedicated to
its fans, having gained fame solely through grass-roots

touring with virtually no airplay for its music. Like its
cultural ancestors, the Grateful Dead, Phish specializes in
long, country / jazz / bluegrass / rock jams, which in this
concert were immensely interesting to my drug-influ
enced neighbors and a stone-cold bore to the rest of us.
The band's chops are not even very impressive — a
dreadfully tone-deaf a cappella version of "Free Bird" was
so bad that the "joke" was a little hard to understand.
Luckily for us, Neil Young soon took the stage„bring
ing his lonely voice and exceedingly beautiful songs.
Young has been the force behind the Bridge School ben
efit, a worthy event now in its 12th year, helping an inno
vative program for children with severe physical and
speech impairments.
Young is the prototype for the artist who doesn't know
how to deal with his fame. Ever since the commercial suc
cess of "Harvest" in 1972, Young has been fighting to
redefine himself to avoid the expectations of his fame.
The nadir of this battle occurred when Geffen Records
sued him in the early '80s for not making "Neil Young
records." However Young has seemed to find peace with
his past as his set included beautiful versions of "Heart of
Gold" and "Old Man," the two hit singles he used to wear
as albatrosses around his neck.
R.E.M. is another band which has experienced signifi
cant difficulty with its success. By spending an unusual
amount of time trying to convince critics that it hadn't
"sold out" after the success of "Out Of Time" in 1991, the
group raised the still-unanswered question about why it
didn't want a mass audience.
Perhaps the answer is that R.E.M. ultimately doesn't
care about its audience. The band may have sung its
biggest hit single, "Losing My Religion," but Michael
Stipe screwed up the lyrics even though he was reading
them from a music stand. Admittedly, the band hasn't
been touring for years and has lost its original drummer
to retirement, but the group used the concert as a sort of
open rehearsal for very new material. However, this
material reveals that R.E.M. is on the verge of becoming
a caricature of its former self. Only "Daysleeper" showed
any promise; everything else sounded like music made by
bands who wanted to sound like R.E.M.
The variety of bands at the Bridge School Benefit
proves there is neither one way to achieve fame, nor one
way to deal with it once achieved. Hopefully, the
Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan will never be
sued by their record companies for attempting to destroy
their own stereotypes.

! mess."
— "Box Set," Barenaked Ladies, 1992
Fame within popular American music is a strange
j beast. Because of Top 40 radio's primacy in the rock
J world, the public's connection with bands and artists is
J usually determined by the all-important hit single,
j However, that success can become a trap in and of
| itself — a fact evident in the concert world when signifi
j cant portions of the audiences come for one or two
! songs, which they think the groups are obligated to play.
The all-acoustic Bridge School Benefit held last week
i end at the Shoreline Ampitheatre provided an interesting
" microcosm of these conflicts. Each act's story illuminated
[ subtle variations on the virtues and limitations of fame.
Jonathan Richman, the eternal adolescent, is still rela-
J tively new to the world of fame, which is surprising con
j sidering that his work with the Modern Lovers in 1971
| deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as that of
j Lou Reed and Iggy Pop as the beginning of modern
! American rock.
Instead, Richman lived as a cult figure for nearly three
i decades and has gained notoriety only through his small,
i but distinctive, role in the recent hit movie, "There's
' Something About Mary." Naturally, Richman played the
j title track from the movie in his set, as the song was like
[ ly his ticket into the show. The instrumentation was
[ sparse, just Richman's guitar with a standing drummer,
j emphasizing the immense debt punkabilly bands such as
J the Violent Femmes owe to his work.
! Further, Richman was also able to portray some of the
! wonder and fear which defines his world. To a disarm
! ingly sweet tune, he sang, "When 1 was sue years old, I
i never dreamed I would grow up to be so lonely," which
i was perhaps the most emotionally direct statement of the
j night.
In contrast, the Wallflowers' quick path to fame has
j been a much different story. Jakob Dylan's heritage and
| the hit single "One Headlight" insured success, but the
| band's future is yet to be determined. The fact that their
! first hit sounded very much like a rewrite of Springsteen's
! "Independence Day" was not a particularly good sign.

Nonetheless, the band's set was strong, especially
Dylan's singing. "One Headlight" sounded a little hollow
in the acoustic context, but excellent covers of Neil
Young's "Don't Cry No Tears" and David Bowie's
"Heroes" spoke well of the band's strength. The question
mark, of course, is original songwriting. Dylan does seem
to have a good grasp of pathos though, suggesting that if
he is not the new Dylan, so to speak, he might be the new
Springsteen.
Like the Wallflowers, the Barenaked Ladies are
depending on a hit single to sustain the band's fame.
Unlike the Wallflowers, the band built its following the
old-fashioned way, with strong albums and relentless
touring. Although the Barenaked Ladies have been super
stars in Canada for about six years, the band didn't crack
the U.S. market until its bouncy, lite-rap single "One
Week" shot up the charts. This small opening is all the
band will need, as their live shows are irresistible, and its
back catalog, especially the creative album "Gordon," is
fantastic.
Indeed, the Barenaked Ladies earned the most enthu
siastic applause of the night, which was well deserved.
The band performed its best material well, notably "Old
Apartment," "What A Good Boy," and "Brian Wilson."
The band's on-stage banter was hilarious as usual. More
importantly, the band let everyone know it was excited to
be playing, the importance of which, as R.E.M. proved
later in the night, cannot be overstated. The Barenaked
Ladies played "One Week," of course, but closed with the
real banner song, "If I Had $1,000,000," which is begin
ning to take on new meaning as the band's star continues
to rise.
Sarah McLachlan's path to fame is a different story
altogether. Although her music is receiving increasing
airplay, her major accomplishment has been the organi
zation of Lilith Fair, the successful, all-female summer
tour, which sawily put her at the front of the female
singer-songwriter movement.
McLachlan's set, relying heavily on her recent album,
"Surfacing," was quite strong. Although she sang her sig
nature songs, "Adia," "Possession," and "Building A
Mystery," the heart of her performance consisted of the
solemn "Angel," performed with the Barenaked Ladies'
bassist and fellow Canadian, Jim Creeggan, and the gor
geous "I Love You," dedicated to a Bridge School student
named Lisa. As she had not planned to sing the song, this
dedication speaks strongly of her dedication to her fans.
The next act, Phish, is perhaps a little too dedicated to
its fans, having gained fame solely through grass-roots

touring with virtually no airplay for its music. Like its
cultural ancestors, the Grateful Dead, Phish specializes in
long, country / jazz / bluegrass / rock jams, which in this
concert were immensely interesting to my drug-influ
enced neighbors and a stone-cold bore to the rest of us.
The band's chops are not even very impressive — a
dreadfully tone-deaf a cappella version of "Free Bird" was
so bad that the "joke" was a little hard to understand.
Luckily for us, Neil Young soon took the stage„bring
ing his lonely voice and exceedingly beautiful songs.
Young has been the force behind the Bridge School ben
efit, a worthy event now in its 12th year, helping an inno
vative program for children with severe physical and
speech impairments.
Young is the prototype for the artist who doesn't know
how to deal with his fame. Ever since the commercial suc
cess of "Harvest" in 1972, Young has been fighting to
redefine himself to avoid the expectations of his fame.
The nadir of this battle occurred when Geffen Records
sued him in the early '80s for not making "Neil Young
records." However Young has seemed to find peace with
his past as his set included beautiful versions of "Heart of
Gold" and "Old Man," the two hit singles he used to wear
as albatrosses around his neck.
R.E.M. is another band which has experienced signifi
cant difficulty with its success. By spending an unusual
amount of time trying to convince critics that it hadn't
"sold out" after the success of "Out Of Time" in 1991, the
group raised the still-unanswered question about why it
didn't want a mass audience.
Perhaps the answer is that R.E.M. ultimately doesn't
care about its audience. The band may have sung its
biggest hit single, "Losing My Religion," but Michael
Stipe screwed up the lyrics even though he was reading
them from a music stand. Admittedly, the band hasn't
been touring for years and has lost its original drummer
to retirement, but the group used the concert as a sort of
open rehearsal for very new material. However, this
material reveals that R.E.M. is on the verge of becoming
a caricature of its former self. Only "Daysleeper" showed
any promise; everything else sounded like music made by
bands who wanted to sound like R.E.M.
The variety of bands at the Bridge School Benefit
proves there is neither one way to achieve fame, nor one
way to deal with it once achieved. Hopefully, the
Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan will never be
sued by their record companies for attempting to destroy
their own stereotypes.
