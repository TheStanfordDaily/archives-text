# Concert Review
## Third Eye Blind: The Bonfire Tour October 9, 1998, The Greek Theater, UC-Berkeley 
### 
What rock idols. When I stepped into the Greek
Theater that Friday night, I first noticed the
enthusiasm of the near-capacity crowd, and
then I saw the reason why. Third Eye Blind played
through its set with a passion and sincerity that lends
itself to an idolatry in which the audience feels an enor
mous affinity with the band.
Swaggering and confident, yet somehow, still redeem
ingly humble, lead vocalist Stephen Jenkins incited, and
at times subdued the constant waves of frenzy. From the
onset, Jenkins hugged the edge stage and gestured wild
ly whenever he wasn't bopping and jumping to the
music, singing particularly at some, reaching out and
touching fingers with others, running to the speaker
stacks at the far sides of the stage to communicate more
directly to the audience at the fringes of the theater.
The concert wasn't non-stop fury and wild entertain
ment, however. Towards the middle of the show, the
band set up on a slightly raised platform, carpeted and
adorned with various pillows, with purple velvet draped
behind it as backdrop. Jenkins likened the setup to his
living room at home. After playing the first song the
band recorded, "Tattoo of the Sun," he gave the first real
heart-to-heart talk of the evening, starting off with, "So
I'll tell you guys why we're doing this tonight... .*
The gig at Berkeley was a homecoming, and Jenkins
thought back to two years ago, when the band was at the
Paradise Lounge on Telegraph, "on someone's hippie
carpet like this," and the felt lucky to have seven or eight
people show up. He expressed his gratitude at now play
ing shows to 7,000 to 8,000 people before the group
launched into one of their new songs, "Gorgeous."
The tempo of the set changed again as the purple

background lifted to reveal a transformed stage. A huge
black on white banner that spelled "THIRD EYE
BLIND" spanned its entire length, and the raised drum

set platform was flanked by two elevated stands, one full
of dancing, college-aged girls. The other held a cellist,
violinists and a programmer. The band launched into
"How's It Gonna Be?" backed by the added orchestra
tion, some grounded fireworks (just like watching Kiss,
or so I'm told) and the shouted chorus of the crowd.
After expressing concern with the roughness of the
more belligerent crowd-surfers, Jenkins requested, "Let's
be good to each other, all right?" and the band played the
song by the same title. Guitarist Kevin Cadogan started
off the next song, to which Jenkins exclaimed, "Oh, no
Kevin, that sounds like hip hop that you're playing.
You're gonna get in trouble, big trouble!" Jenkins
explained the band had trouble getting airplay for one of
its songs, since it had too much of a rap influence to fit
into the stations' "targeted demographic." Then he
added, "I don't want to be a targeted demographic, I'd

rather be a freak!"
With the accusation that every boy, girl, man and
woman knew the words, "which proves you're all a
bunch of perverts, and we love you for itP Third Eye
Blind swung into "Semi-Charmed Life." I looked at the
audience around me and realized how true it was, as 12-
year-olds, middle-aged couples and teenage girls all sang
along confidently.
Cadogan took cue from lenkins, introducing the song
"Can I Graduate." Recalling his own admiration of rock
bands like the Who and Led Zeppelin, Cadogan revealed
how he felt he was finally in the same tradition when
Third Eye Blind got together in studio to perform this
song. As a belly dancer pranced on stage and gyrated
patiendy tc the music, two friends laughed and hugged
nearby in obvious sympathy when Jenkins yelled, "Can I
get my punk ass off the street?"
After paying homage to U2 with a cover of "I Will
Follow," Jenkins did a final introduction of the band.
Third Eye Blind thanked the fans for their support and
for the connection that developed between them all,
wanting to send them off with "something safe," "The
God of One " With the last chord of the song looping in
the background, the band walked off.
You can accuse the group of projecting the awe of its
own success onto the crowd, or even blame the crowd for
what seems to be trite sentimentality. Yet despite the
mainstream success of the band and the variety of audi
ence that it will draw, Berkeley's Greek Theater held wit
ness to the energy and excitement of a genuine rock
show, and the reciprocity of appreciation between artist
and fan that is telling of true legends
