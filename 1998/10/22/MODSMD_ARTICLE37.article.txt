## Everything swing! The 						craze hits Stanford 
### Alexis Tygenhof Contributing writer 
Swing, the dance of the 19305, has exploded back into mainstream American
social dance, and Stanford ranks as one of the craze's biggest victims. Last
spring quarter, the line to sign up for Richard Powers' "Living Traditions of
Swing" class wound all the way around Roble Gym, and dancers packed the Main Quad
on the Saturday night of Homecoming Weekend '98 for the "It's All Right Now" swing
dance.
But what is swing dancing exactly? Where did it come from and where is it going?
How can someone new to the swing scene become involved?
What is swing?
The term "swing" refers to several dances that are similar in style and footwork but
that work best with different types of music. Joy Hatzidakis, a graduate student biolo
gy, explains, "The more well-known types are East Coast swing, Lindy Hop and West
Coast swing. The sort of moves you saw on the Gap commercial are from Lindy Hop
but the ones in the movie 'Swingers' are ECS." West Coast swing falls into the country-

western genre, tends to be slower and
sleeker, and works incredibly well
with blues music. Other forms
include Jitterbug, Jive, Two-Step and
Hustle.
According to dance historian and
Stanford dance instructor Richard
Powers, swing began its evolution
back in the early 20th century. Even
before 1910, people in San Francisco
were doing the Texas Tommy, a
dance that had swingouts and looked
like Lindy. In the 1920s it became the
Charleston, a turning, closed couple
dance with breakouts.
The dance happened to be in this
state when Shorty Snowden, a cham
pion dancer in the Savoy Ball in New
York City, called it Lindy. At that
time, most of the elements of today,
such as the Lindy circle, and both
six-count and eight-count varia
tions, were there. However, the dance
was very vertical and the footwork
and tempo were Charleston; the
music was classic jazz.
In the 19305, the music became
swing, the dance became more hori

zontal, and style diversified. Swing dancing dominated until World War 11, peaking in
the years between 1938 and 1941.
The swing revival began 15 years ago in San Francisco. The Royal Crown Revue, a
Los Angeles ska band that played its best gigs in San Francisco, reintroduced swing
music. Soon after, the movie "Swing Kids" was released. Then other bands began cross
ing over. The revival began with small gatherings of devoted fanatics and developed
into a national craze because of bands, films and TV ads.
Why the swingers swing
People at Stanford tend to try swing because their friends do it or they think it looks
cool, and then they become hooked, often attending multiple dance events every week.
They learn the dance quickly and then keep it up for years. Deb Henigson, a senior
majoring in art history and visual literature, learned swing in high school but still goes
dancing "as often as I can afford to."
Kristen Grenfell, a junior majoring in science, technology and society, explains the
lure of swing: "Swing, specifically Lindy Hop, is everything I could want in a
dance ... in life, in fact: Fast, energetic, potentially intricate. Lots of opportunities for
personal style and improvisation, no set limits or 'standards.' It requires spirit, energy,
rhythm, but most of all it induces joy, whether you're dancing yourself or enjoying

watching others enjoy themselves."
Swing is always fresh; there's no such thing as the same old swing. There's always a
new move, a new partner, a new style, and the old stuff never grows old.
Where to go: The club scene and the Stanford scene
Pick any night of the week and someone nearby will be swing dancing. A phenome
nal number of clubs in the Bay Area host swing nights. But be savvy in your choice of
local dance. Some clubs cater to serious dancers; they have large, well-surfaced dance
floors and tend to attract conscientious crowds, while other clubs service the hop-on
the-bandwagon, drink-and-dance-wildly crowds; these places often have new dancers
and higher casualty rates. Both types have their allure.
Where you ultimately go depends largely on why you dance and what you want out
of a night on the town. Henigson defined a good swing scene as one with "a wide vari
ety of styles and ages of swingers out on the floor. But most of all, the band sets the
scene."
Hatzidakis recommended Broadway Studios in San Francisco because it has "great
atmosphere and a spacious dance floor." But Scott Stanford, BS '93, MS '98, cautions,
"The places in the City — Broadway Studios, Inferno, Hißall — are the social places to
be, but they are crowded. Backßeat in Santa Clara is close by and has pretty good bands

on Sunday evenings. Nice to have the
lowered dance floor. Not incredibly
crowded either." Henigson raves,
"My favorite club is by far Coconut
Grove in Santa Cruz — great atmos
phere, beautiful building, lots of
space, although the actual wooden
dance floor could be bigger.
Consistently awesome bands, free
water, and a live, very mixed crowd."
Other places to try are "Lindy in
the Park" every Saturday afternoon
in San Francisco, which is free, and
Palookaville and the Catalyst in
Santa Cruz.
But you can find a healthy swing
scene right here at Stanford. Jammix
is held in Roble Gym once a month,
and entrance is only $2. These
dances consistently max out at 300
attendees early in the evening. And
coming up on Nov. 7 is Stanford's
annual 1930s dance, The Ragtime
Ball and Jitterbug lam. Swing
Solution's Big Band and Paul Price's
Society Orchestra will play at this
first big dance event of the school

year. The theme for this year's ball is "Stars of the Silver Screen," and for decoration, the
road leading up to Roble Gym will be lined with 1930's automobiles.
Where to learn
Formal lessons are the safest and quickest way to learn swing, and they supply a
swinger with a solid dance foundation upon which he or she can add fancy moves. Scott
Stanford advises, "For beginners, definitely go to a series. When you get intermediate or
advanced, you can go to the 'drop-in' lessons and pick up 'ammunition.'"
A good dancer never stops learning and improving; as he or she advances, lessons
supplement "real world" experience on the dance floor. Grenfell elaborates, "Lessons are
good for picking up new fancy footwork you wouldn't otherwise know well enough to
be able to lead in a social situation. Just picking it up, going out and dancing with ran
dom people — not stagnating in a familiar group where everyone starts to develop
exactly the same style — is totally the way to go."
Just like any other class, a dance class can be anything from fabulous to atrocious. A
good class teaches you to dance. Henigson explains, "The best teachers are ones that
teach you more than just sequences — they actually teach you how to lead the moves
on people who don't know them, and how to follow moves you've never been taught."

We'll swing like it's 1939.
In addition, Ken Takusagawa, a computer science junior,
said he prefers lessons that "cover a lot of things rather
than repeating the same thing over and over again."
Stanford is a rich source of dance lessons. For those
willing to line up outside Roble Gym at 6:00 a.m. to sign
up, Powers teaches a beginning and an intermediate
social dance class every quarter that includes swing. And
in the spring, "Living Traditions of Swing" (Drama 147)
replaces "Social Dance II." Powers also teaches a Monday
night lesson in Palo Alto and a Thursday night lesson
back in Roble Gym. The Stanford Ballroom Dance Club
offers lessons on Sunday in general ballroom. Also, every
Thursday at 6 p.m. in Roble Gym, Henigson DJs a ball
room practice session called dance lab — sort of a mini
weekday Jammix.
The swing dancer's survival guide
Unless you never dance anywhere but in your own liv
ing room / dorm lounge with anyone other than your
own shadow, you need to know more than steps to enjoy
swing dancing. There is an unwritten, basic code of eti
quette that all considerate dancers follow.
These rules protect both you and your partner and
enhance and lengthen your dancing experience. No mat
ter how good your turns are, if you hurt your partner, he
or she will not want to dance with you again.
S. S. Mohan, a doctoral student in electrical engineer
ing, describes the basic etiquette of partnering, which
applies to both leads and follows: "This translates to
dancing for your partner, looking our for your partner,
doing steps that your partner finds comfortable." And for
leads in particular, he advises, "If you would like to
experiment with complex steps, first start with basic ones
and then throw in complexity gradually. If you find your
partner struggling, reduce complexity and repeat some
steps until she is comfortable."
Powers added that a man should never attempt aerials
(airborne dance moves) with a partner until he and she
have practiced them (preferably over a surface more for
giving than a concrete or wood floor) and he has her
expressed permission.
Other ways to enhance your partner's experience:
Dance with your face as well as your body; if you're at an
event where people change partners frequently, allow
your partner to move on after a few dances; and always
carry breath mints (ALTOIDS!). Also, don't drink and
dance — it's rude and dangerous, and besides, you'll
have more fun sober.
The above rules apply every time you step on a dance
floor; when the floor is crowded, a whole new code of

conduct goes into
affect.
Henigson stressed,
"Keep it small! No big
kicks, especially for
ladies with heels, no
aerials. But most of all,
be considerate of your
partner. This goes for
both leads and follows.
Look out for each
other. Also, don't let
your arms go straight
on the swingout or
during open moves.
Keep tension so you
come back together
quickly and can tug
each other away from
danger!"
Scott Atwood, BS

*96, MS '98, added,
"Show courtesy for other dancers. Take small steps. Rock
step under your body. Stay close to your partner
— besides, it's nicer that way!"
The look: clothes and shoes
Although dressing up in 1930s garb is not required for
swing dancing and a cool outfit won't turn a bad partner
into a phenomenal dancer, many swingers undoubtedly
find dressing vintage extremely fun.
Explaining the joys of dressing up, Grenfell said, "I
think people love to dress up in general, and this is a
great excuse. It's Halloween, prom and the Savoy ball
room all combined."
Henigson theorizes, "I think the whole swing resur
gence is sort of a backlash against grunge and the whole
slacker stereotype young people seem to have following
them everywhere. So they go the whole nine yards, neat
clothes inluded. It really makes you feel like you're part of
the scene as well."
For authentic clothes, try Trappings of Time in Palo
Alto. According to Hatzidakis, they offer "high quality
items at a cost, although they seem to have frequent
sales." She added, "I also highly recommend the Vintage
Fashion Expo, which comes to San Francisco twice yearly."
Stanford got most of his swing outfits from his grand
father, and Henigson also wears many hand-me-downs.
She advised dancers to buy their clothes out of state
because "everything in California is way too expensive."
But authentic clothing may not be the way to go.
Hatzidakis prefers imitations. "Remember," she said, "If
you sweat in and wear out a vintage clothing item, you're
destroying a piece of history. Also, I bought a pair of vin
tage shoes that once that fell apart on me. Imitations are
the way to go. They will take the wear and tear better."
Imitations can be made from scratch, compiled from
what's in stores today, found at garage sales and in rela
tives' closets, or even rented from costume shops such as
the Costume Bank in Palo Alto. When buying shoes, look
for something with support and a nice, soft sole.
Henigson explained, "Comfort should be number one if
you are serious about dancing. Sometimes I'll have a
whole period outfit and then my black Reeboks that I
resoled for dancing."
The beat
Swing music is comprised of both traditional and
revival songs. Comparing the two, Henigson said,
"They're very different. New swing music, as opposed to
the classic Big Band sound, is filled with ska and rock

influences. Big Band music derives from the Kletzmer
music tradition of Eastern European jews, and is way
more than just swing-dancing tunes."
Hatzidakis prefers the oldies because "you can really
feel a swing feeling in the older music, unlike the new
stuff" And Grenfell said that "a lot of the original songs
have more brass, more intricate rhythms and beats to
inspire more improvisations, syncopations and fancy
footwork" But she added, "Newer songs tend to have
more beat and be more immediately exciting than the
older song that you have to listen more closely to."
Both types of music have positive attributes and many
people have no preference for one above the other.
Henigson said, "I like them both equally, for different
reasons on each side."
Some of the hottest bands of today are Indigo Swing,
Royal Crown Revue, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Lavay
Smith and her Red Hot Skillet Lickers, Steve Lucky and
the Rhumba Bums, Brian Setzer Orchestra, and Cherry
Poppin' Daddies.
Hatzidakis said, "Louis Jordan's tunes are a must. They
also play some good music on 90.3 and 89.1 FM. You can
purchase music from stores, over the Web, or from the
bands themselves. Henigson recommends the last way
because then you can get your CD signed.
Swing tomorrow
Swing began developing around the turn of the centu
ry. Today, swing is a national craze, but will it last, or will
it go out of style like so many other American crazes?
Powers comments that as recently as last year, the
sw'ng revival was powered by honest new interest in the
dance. But this year, for the first time, he said he sees "all
the trademarks of a fad. And in the past, most often fads
die." People are using swing to get people to buy things
or to come to their parties, and because these people
don't understand what swing is and where it comes from,
they use it badly.
Powers compared the swing craze to the disco fad of
the late '70s. Disco survived for a long time in small
clubs. But then, "Saturday Night Fever" came out.

Suddenly, disco received a lot of publicity and disco clubs
sprung up all over the country. The next year it crashed,
and when it went out of style, it dragged all the old estab
lished clubs with it.
The swing fad has this same simmer, peak and crash
potential.
If swing dies, Powers said, "It would be too bad; it
would be a loss. Swing has a depth and a richness and a
genuine dancers' appeal." He added, "I hope I'm wrong; I
may be wrong."
Hopefully, when the craze dies down, which it must,
there will still be enough devoted dancers and musicians
left to carry on a revival.
