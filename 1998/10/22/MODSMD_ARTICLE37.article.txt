## Everything swing! The
						craze hits Stanford 
### Alexis Tygenhof Contributing writer 
Swing, the dance of the 19305, has exploded back into mainstream American
social dance, and Stanford ranks as one of the craze's biggest victims. Last
spring quarter, the line to sign up for Richard Powers' "Living Traditions of
Swing" class wound all the way around Roble Gym, and dancers packed the Main Quad
on the Saturday night of Homecoming Weekend '98 for the "It's All Right Now" swing
dance.
But what is swing dancing exactly? Where did it come from and where is it going?
How can someone new to the swing scene become involved?
What is swing?
The term "swing" refers to several dances that are similar in style and footwork but
that work best with different types of music. Joy Hatzidakis, a graduate student biolo
gy, explains, "The more well-known types are East Coast swing, Lindy Hop and West
Coast swing. The sort of moves you saw on the Gap commercial are from Lindy Hop
but the ones in the movie 'Swingers' are ECS." West Coast swing falls into the country-

western genre, tends to be slower and
sleeker, and works incredibly well
with blues music. Other forms
include Jitterbug, Jive, Two-Step and
Hustle.
According to dance historian and
Stanford dance instructor Richard
Powers, swing began its evolution
back in the early 20th century. Even
before 1910, people in San Francisco
were doing the Texas Tommy, a
dance that had swingouts and looked
like Lindy. In the 1920s it became the
Charleston, a turning, closed couple
dance with breakouts.
The dance happened to be in this
state when Shorty Snowden, a cham
pion dancer in the Savoy Ball in New
York City, called it Lindy. At that
time, most of the elements of today,
such as the Lindy circle, and both
six-count and eight-count varia
tions, were there. However, the dance
was very vertical and the footwork
and tempo were Charleston; the
music was classic jazz.
In the 19305, the music became
swing, the dance became more hori

zontal, and style diversified. Swing dancing dominated until World War 11, peaking in
the years between 1938 and 1941.
The swing revival began 15 years ago in San Francisco. The Royal Crown Revue, a
Los Angeles ska band that played its best gigs in San Francisco, reintroduced swing
music. Soon after, the movie "Swing Kids" was released. Then other bands began cross
ing over. The revival began with small gatherings of devoted fanatics and developed
into a national craze because of bands, films and TV ads.
Why the swingers swing
People at Stanford tend to try swing because their friends do it or they think it looks
cool, and then they become hooked, often attending multiple dance events every week.
They learn the dance quickly and then keep it up for years. Deb Henigson, a senior
majoring in art history and visual literature, learned swing in high school but still goes
dancing "as often as I can afford to."
Kristen Grenfell, a junior majoring in science, technology and society, explains the
lure of swing: "Swing, specifically Lindy Hop, is everything I could want in a
dance ... in life, in fact: Fast, energetic, potentially intricate. Lots of opportunities for
personal style and improvisation, no set limits or 'standards.' It requires spirit, energy,
rhythm, but most of all it induces joy, whether you're dancing yourself or enjoying

watching others enjoy themselves."
Swing is always fresh; there's no such thing as the same old swing. There's always a
new move, a new partner, a new style, and the old stuff never grows old.
Where to go: The club scene and the Stanford scene
Pick any night of the week and someone nearby will be swing dancing. A phenome
nal number of clubs in the Bay Area host swing nights. But be savvy in your choice of
local dance. Some clubs cater to serious dancers; they have large, well-surfaced dance
floors and tend to attract conscientious crowds, while other clubs service the hop-on
the-bandwagon, drink-and-dance-wildly crowds; these places often have new dancers
and higher casualty rates. Both types have their allure.
Where you ultimately go depends largely on why you dance and what you want out
of a night on the town. Henigson defined a good swing scene as one with "a wide vari
ety of styles and ages of swingers out on the floor. But most of all, the band sets the
scene."
Hatzidakis recommended Broadway Studios in San Francisco because it has "great
atmosphere and a spacious dance floor." But Scott Stanford, BS '93, MS '98, cautions,
"The places in the City — Broadway Studios, Inferno, Hißall — are the social places to
be, but they are crowded. Backßeat in Santa Clara is close by and has pretty good bands

on Sunday evenings. Nice to have the
lowered dance floor. Not incredibly
crowded either." Henigson raves,
"My favorite club is by far Coconut
Grove in Santa Cruz — great atmos
phere, beautiful building, lots of
space, although the actual wooden
dance floor could be bigger.
Consistently awesome bands, free
water, and a live, very mixed crowd."
Other places to try are "Lindy in
the Park" every Saturday afternoon
in San Francisco, which is free, and
Palookaville and the Catalyst in
Santa Cruz.
But you can find a healthy swing
scene right here at Stanford. Jammix
is held in Roble Gym once a month,
and entrance is only $2. These
dances consistently max out at 300
attendees early in the evening. And
coming up on Nov. 7 is Stanford's
annual 1930s dance, The Ragtime
Ball and Jitterbug lam. Swing
Solution's Big Band and Paul Price's
Society Orchestra will play at this
first big dance event of the school

year. The theme for this year's ball is "Stars of the Silver Screen," and for decoration, the
road leading up to Roble Gym will be lined with 1930's automobiles.
Where to learn
Formal lessons are the safest and quickest way to learn swing, and they supply a
swinger with a solid dance foundation upon which he or she can add fancy moves. Scott
Stanford advises, "For beginners, definitely go to a series. When you get intermediate or
advanced, you can go to the 'drop-in' lessons and pick up 'ammunition.'"
A good dancer never stops learning and improving; as he or she advances, lessons
supplement "real world" experience on the dance floor. Grenfell elaborates, "Lessons are
good for picking up new fancy footwork you wouldn't otherwise know well enough to
be able to lead in a social situation. Just picking it up, going out and dancing with ran
dom people — not stagnating in a familiar group where everyone starts to develop
exactly the same style — is totally the way to go."
Just like any other class, a dance class can be anything from fabulous to atrocious. A
good class teaches you to dance. Henigson explains, "The best teachers are ones that
teach you more than just sequences — they actually teach you how to lead the moves
on people who don't know them, and how to follow moves you've never been taught."
