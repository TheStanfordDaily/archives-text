# Interview
## 'Slam' This one's on the mark 
### 
Raymond Joshua (played by Saul Williams) is a
writer who doesn't think of himself as a poet. At
least that is what he tells Lauren Bell, (Sonja Sohn)
a writing teacher at the jail where he is spending time on
a petty drug charge.
Raymond slams words together. He says that he will
"throw a shadow on the sun" and "bathe in the yesterdays
of days to come." In the words he piles onto one other, he
imagines himself beyond the grim reality of the inner-city
projects of his childhood and the prison sentence he sud
denly finds himself having to serve.
"Slam" is yet another foray into the world of gang con
flict. Unlike many films of late, however, "Slam" is crafted
with great attention to the humanity and personality of
its characters, showing us a detailed sliver of a world few
viewers are familiar with. Earlier this year, "Slam" won the
1998 Grand Jury Prize at Sundance Film Festival and the
Camera d'Or and Prix du Public (audience award) at the
1998 Cannes Film Festival. Both awards were well
deserved.
Slowly we watch what seems to be a documentary
unfold. We are drawn into Raymond's life and the beauti
ful words that he uses like prods and daggers to protect
and express himself. And we come to know that he is

indeed a poet — a pretty brilliant one.
At a "slam," people speak their poetry to a crowd, com
peting both with their words and the dynamic of their
deliveries. Like a performer at a poetry slam, director
Marc Levin has crafted a film which has both awkward
and powerful moments. And like a slam, most of the film
is a forceful and dramatic delivery of unusual juxtaposi
tions both in style and story. It is a film that slowly draws
us in to its world of gang wars, subtly building its layers of
dramatic tension masterfully.
Unfortunately, the hard fight for ideals over violence is
immediately undermined by the rapid transformation of
one of the gang leaders, Hopha (played by Bonz Malone).
Supposedly shaken by Joshua's words, he pledges reform.
However, he is so powerfully convincing as a hardened
career criminal in two earlier scenes that the transition
seems a ridiculous. A similar switch happens again later
in the film. Raymond tells a friend who has recently suf
fered blindness from a gang-related incident to abandon
his feelings of revenge. And he abruptly, unbelievably,
does just that.
Director Levin has most recently been known for
award-winning documentaries which often explore
worlds of troubled youth (the HBO documentary "Gang

War: Bangin' In Little Rock"). In "Slam" he draws on that
experience beautifully, both in style and story. Watching
Raymond being processed in prison — his personality
stripped and replaced by a number — is evidence alone
that this is the work of someone who knows this world,
and has given much thought about how to portray it.
