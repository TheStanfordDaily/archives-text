# Spoken word spoken here
## An interview with Saul Williams 
### Laura Norton Contributing Writer 
Intermission recently had the opportunity to speak with Saul Williams, poet, actor
and now, screenwriter, about his upcoming film "Slam" and his life as a poet in the spo
ken word scene.
Intermission: How did you get involved in the project?
Saul Williams: Mark [Levin, the film's director] saw me perform at the Grand Slam
championship at the New Eureka Poets Cafe [in New York] in the spring of '96.1 didn't
meet him that night.
He had an idea about doing a story, telling a story of a poet who is on the street, he

sells drugs and gets caught up in the drug game and
finds his way through words, enlightenment poetry.
So he came up with some skeleton of an idea and
approached me the following fall, and asked me if I'd
be willing to collaborate as a writer and an actor
At the time I was in my third year at the graduate
acting program at NYU. I had been on the poetry
scene for around a year and a half, and was at that
point becoming very interested in finding a way to
fuse my poetry with my acting. This was perfect, like
the glass slipper that fit perfectly. And that was how it
started.
I: What was it like working with the veriU style?
SW: I've had such an extensive theatrical back
ground that I think it is the perfect segue into film —
to work with filmmakers who see making a movie in
the sense of capturing a scene as opposed to setting
one up and shooting it. They capture, so you just have
to be. It made it easier because I had the nine-month

period to totally ingest everything that I had created for this character. When it came
time to film it was very much internalized, so there was very little outward, over-the-top
acting. It was very subtle, which is a great opportunity. I was very conscious of the fact
that most guys in their first film overact.
I: How do you think it will be working with other people's words?
SW: My background is theater and I've never written a play. The difference is that
you'll never see "Jurassic Park: The Play," you'll never see "Lethal Weapon: The Play."
Since theater isn't a big money-making industry in the first place, you can always find a
nice compelling chunk to feel passionate about.
However, you don't have many playwrights conforming, because plays don't sell any
way. If they're going to conform they're going to write a screenplay. But screenplay writ-

ers do conform so it's hard to find good material. My problem is not doing other peo
ple's material. My problem is doing other people's dirty shit — I mean boring work
which I just refuse to do.
Film is such an important vehicle for enlightenment. It's a vehicle for reaching peo
ple. I never imagined my introduction to the film world would be a project that I am so
attached to, that I would have so much say in. I thought that I'd be at an audition next
to Chris Tucker, and someone would just fall in love with me and I'd get that shitty role.
But it would be mine. And that would be my introduction on the road to being Denzel
[Washington].
I: Were you at Cannes? What was the international reaction there?
SW: The first thing I learned at Cannes was that there is no such thing as a language

barrier. That was the first foreign audience that I
saw it with. But that was the first foreign audience
that I watched it with and they sat on the edges of
their chairs crying and were blown away by the
film.
If you're viscerally connected to what you're
saying, passionate about what you're saying, then
you don't need a translator. People can understand
just based on the feeling. It's only when you're
talking about nonsense about shit that doesn't
need to be said — that's when you need subtitles.
I: It sounds like you had so much freedom in
your acting during the filming.
SW: Yeah, the thing is that the film is impro
vised, yet at the same time we had a longer
rehearsal process than any play. We had nine
months preparing so that we were overly prepared.
The final step of the process was releasing every
thing and saying, "Well, whatever happens, hap
pens."

I: Did it ever feel like you had prepared too much at any point?
SW: No, not at all because we knew that the final step would be just being there and
trusting that everything we had planned on was in our bloodstream. We had our shot
list and knew what we needed to do and it would work out.
I: Is there any particular audience you'd like the film to reach specifically?
SW: I'd like the film to reach everyone, specifically. 1 think the largest group of pris
oners in this country are the people who think they're free because of their material pos
sessions. They think they're free because they are seemingly disconnected from what
they see happening in the film. And that's not the way their life is.
