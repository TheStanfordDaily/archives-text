# Mendicants' anniversary concert on Friday night
## 35 years of singing men in pinstripes 
### Maggie Weidner 
When a group of Stanford men
dressed in suits burst in unannounced
to the dining hall of Branner Hall in
1963, then an all-women's dorm, the
startled girls thought that some fra
ternity boys were about to play a joke
on them. That is, until the dashing
group began to sing.
On that night 35 years ago. Hank
Adams, Class of '64, Peary Spaght
and Dick Grant, both class of '67, and
the rest of the newly formed group
performed the first a cappella con
cert on the Stanford campus. Figur
ing that if the Stanford freshman
women didn't like them, nobody
would, the trio sparked a tradition
that continues to this day. Even now,
a cappella groups traditionally make
rounds to dorms to welcome fresh
men to Stanford life during orienta
tion week.
The three men who co-founded
Stanford a cappella by forming the
Mendicants desired to make a cap
pella "happen" on the West Coast
and on the Stanford campus — they
wanted to create something that
would last. And they succeeded.
Eight a cappella groups at Stan
ford have blossomed since that night
in 1963. And tomorrow, the Stanford
Mendicants — old and new — cele
brate their 35th anniversary, and 35
years of the Stanford singing tradi

tion.

said, "I played a C-major triad chord
one day, and I literally made a mis
take. My fourth finger fell on the
sixth note of the chord, and I said,
'Wow! What is that?'"
That was the beginnings of har
mony. "Electrified" by its sound,
Adams taught himself modern har
mony and arranged over 3(X) songs
for the piano before he transferred to
Stanford from Yale as a junior in
1963.

It was this extensive experience,
as well as his seniority, that earned
him the position of the Mendicants'
first director or "pitchpipe."
Adams, steeped in East Coast a
cappella tradition, felt the need to de
velop similar traditions this side of
