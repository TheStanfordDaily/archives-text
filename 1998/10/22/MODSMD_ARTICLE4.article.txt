# Mendicants' anniversary concert on Friday night
## 35 years of singing men in pinstripes 
### Maggie Weidner 
When a group of Stanford men
dressed in suits burst in unannounced
to the dining hall of Branner Hall in
1963, then an all-women's dorm, the
startled girls thought that some fra
ternity boys were about to play a joke
on them. That is, until the dashing
group began to sing.
On that night 35 years ago. Hank
Adams, Class of '64, Peary Spaght
and Dick Grant, both class of '67, and
the rest of the newly formed group
performed the first a cappella con
cert on the Stanford campus. Figur
ing that if the Stanford freshman
women didn't like them, nobody
would, the trio sparked a tradition
that continues to this day. Even now,
a cappella groups traditionally make
rounds to dorms to welcome fresh
men to Stanford life during orienta
tion week.
The three men who co-founded
Stanford a cappella by forming the
Mendicants desired to make a cap
pella "happen" on the West Coast
and on the Stanford campus — they
wanted to create something that
would last. And they succeeded.
Eight a cappella groups at Stan
ford have blossomed since that night
in 1963. And tomorrow, the Stanford
Mendicants — old and new — cele
brate their 35th anniversary, and 35
years of the Stanford singing tradi

tion.
"When I was sixteen," Adams
said, "I played a C-major triad chord
one day, and I literally made a mis
take. My fourth finger fell on the
sixth note of the chord, and I said,
'Wow! What is that?'"
That was the beginnings of har
mony. "Electrified" by its sound,
Adams taught himself modern har
mony and arranged over 3(X) songs
for the piano before he transferred to
Stanford from Yale as a junior in
1963.

It was this extensive experience,
as well as his seniority, that earned
him the position of the Mendicants'
first director or "pitchpipe."
Adams, steeped in East Coast a
cappella tradition, felt the need to de
velop similar traditions this side of

the Mississippi. Luckily, thai same
year, freshmen Peary Spaght and
Dick Grant were also planning a
vocal group. Spaght, Grant and
Adams consolidated their effdrts to
form the first a cappella group at
Stanford, and the second oldest a cap
pella group west of the Mississippi.
The oldest group is the Men's Octet
at UC-Berkeley.
In the words of "Forever Plaid," a
musical revue of male quartets in the
19505, Adams said, "There's no feel
ing in the world like climbing inside a
nice, tight chord."
ITie Mendicants' sound was born
from the modern music of the l%()s.
Adams fervently loved the sounds of
big band jazz, and he thought that the
Mendicants could recreate that
sound in the vocal group.
Mike LaHood, senior and four
year member of the Mendicants ex
plained that today there is no one
Mendicant sound. Though their roots
are still firmly planted in classic '50s
and '60s tunes, the group also per
forms jazz, bossa nova and rock 'n'
roll.
The one song that almost every
Mendicant knows is "Delia,"
arranged by Peary Spaght in 1%6.
Along with the Stanford Hymn, the
Mendicants will sing "Delia" en

masse tomorrow night.
" 'Delia' is not just a signature
song," LaHcxnJ said. "It [isj some
thing that the Mendicants would go
off and sing by themselves."
He said that "Delia" has meaning
because it demonstrates to him that
"each person, if they were singing by
themselves, would have a nice voice.
But if you add up all these individuals,
you get something much greater than
just the sum of their voices. Everyone
just bonds through the music."
According to the jacket of their
1965 album, "A Fella Needs a Girl,"
"These are 16 men ... but the sound
inside is one: it is the sound of the
Mendicants."
So who are these people? Both
LaHood and Adams insist that there
is no such thing as a typical Mendi
cant. According to their web site,
"They are many ... things — an
actor, a psychologist, a couple of en
gineers, a playboy, a poet, and a few
wandering scholars."
Mendicant alumni have become
very successful scientists, actors and
entrepreneurs, like John Frohnmay
er, a former chairman of the National
Endowment of the Arts, and Kurt
Kassulke, winner of an Emmy for his
sound work on "Ally Mcßeal." The
Mendicants' only criterion is that
they have a good voice and ear and
that they be "Mendicants," as the title
could be construed in an English-
Latin pun: "Men di Cant" or "Men of

Song."
Of course, because the Mendi
cants are not "a unified fraternal
group," as the 1965 jacket cover ex
plained, "factions arise and tempers
Hare as they inevitably must."
Indeed, the group had a brief
brush with oblivion when they almost
split in 1970 over musical differences.
1 lowever, Adams gathered the group
in his Palo Alto home and together
they worked out their conflicts.
LaHood said that the dedication
that Mendicants members have to
their music and to each other has
formed a strong brotherhood be
tween them. I le marveled at how far
people will go to for the Mendicants.
"It means so much to so many
people," he said.
Adams agreed. "I didn't go to
Stanford. I went to the Mendicants."
Friday night, the Mendicants will
be celebrating just this kind of dedi
cation to song in a concert at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium that includes not
only six of the Stanford a cappella
groups, but also the Men's Octet from
UC-Berkeley.
LaHood is excited because this
will be a perfect opportunity to meet
some Mendicant alumni and hear
good stories from the past.
"When you feel the scope of how
many people there were before you .
... it just blows you away. It's over
whelming," he said.
As Adams looked back over the

last three-and-a-half decades, he said.
"The memory is of the times when we
really created a good sound. The
memory is of working very hard. The
idea is that it really looks like a hunch
of guys, who just got up and started to

sing informally, and it looks very re
laxed, hut there is an enormous
amount of work that goes into it. It's
like a team in sports."
"I can't tell you how much I love
Stanford," Adams said, "I wanted to

contribute in some way to the cam
pus."
It would seem that he has, leaving
a brotherhood in the Mendicants and
legacy of Stanford a cappella that has
nourished for 35 years.
