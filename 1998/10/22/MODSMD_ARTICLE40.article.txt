## The 						Witching Hour 'Practical Magic' has its moments 
### 
Can witches lead normal lives? This
question is at the heart of
"Practical Magic." The movie's
women do their best to suppress their
witchiness when men are around. The
problem is, they suffer from a curse stem
ming back to "Scarlet Letter" days: Their
ancestor, a witch among Puritans,
promised never to love again. Ever since,
all the Owens women have been destined
to lose the men they cared for.
Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) is deter
mined to break this spell. She abandons
the craft that her two loving, white-witch
aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne
Wiest) have taught her to pursue a nor
mal life — connubial bliss with a nice,
average man and cute children. But she
can't escape her destiny, and she's eventu
ally drawn back into witchy behavior by
her sister, the vixen Gillian (Nicole
Kidman). Gillian's misadventures moti
vate much of the plot.

The amounts of long, flowing hair in this movie may
make it a bit too girly for some men to take, although the
tempting Gillian should attract a fair few. It's not a typi
cal "chick flick" in the derogatory sense, since most of the
film does not to fall into sentimentalism. In fact,
the movie's central plot focuses on a menacing man from
Transylvania, ]immy Angelo (Goran Visnjic), who has
enough venom for any male in the audience to admire.

What's most interesting about this film is how it
blends four genres: the family saga (three generations of
Owens women are portrayed), the romantic comedy
(Sally's love life), the suspense thriller (Jimmy's menace),
and the horror / supernatural movie (magical exploits).
Part of the disappointment of the film, however, comes
with its attempt to incorporate all four — it cannot give
enough time to each thread to make the viewer feel fully

satisfied.
I was left wanting to know much more
about the aunts. Channing and Wiest are
as compelling as always, and I felt cheated
that they couldn't play a more involved
role. We see very little of the interactions
between the Owens family and the closed
minded, New England town dwellers —
although the aunts seem to have contacts
among them.
The acting here is not always stellar. The
film's focus on Sandra Bullock's character
made me cringe, because Bullock lacks the
range to portray the kinds of emotions
that Sally was supposed to be experienc
ing. She is flat, while Nicole Kidman is a
study in expressiveness. This casting does
bring out the contrast between the two sis
ters, but it proves frustrating. I walked out
of the theater thinking how much more
exciting the movie could have been with
Kidman's character as its focus.
Unfortunately, the end of the film starts

veering towards cliches and predictabilities. The tension
created by Jimmy's threat seems contrived and quickly
gets repetitive. The love story is made to be a bit too
heart-warming.But overall, the film is engaging and
amusing, and with its odd combination of the normal
and the bizarre, it mirrors the desires oi the two Owens
sisters.
