# 'Beloved'
## Oprah does period drama 
### 
A paradox of modern film, "Beloved" both fascinates and disappoints. Director
Jonathan Demme takes on a challenge that most fail — turning a literary mas
terpiece into a mainstream movie. Casting the world's most famous talk-show
host, Oprah Winfrey, as the unbreakable heroine of Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-win
ning novel doesn't make the challenge any easier.
Staying true to Morrison's plot, Demme begins in Ohio where ex-slave Sethe (Oprah
Winfrey) lives with her daughter Denver and her lover, Paul D. (Danny Glover). Paul D.'s
conversations with Sethe lead to flashbacks from her past, powerful and pungent images
that startle the passive mind. These flashbacks eventually lead to Paul D.'s cathartic dis-

covery of Sethe's past.
The role of Sethe is a hard one, for she is described by Morrison as a woman who has
undergone every foreseeable struggle in life, a woman who has always been chained in
some way. Though Oprah remains all too familiar to the American audience to meld
into the role completely, she plays her part with grace and easy talent. It is like watching
someone we know perform in a play — although we're cheering for her, we know she's
only playing a temporary role.
On the other hand, Thandie Newton gives a powerful and believable performance as
the Sethe's dead daughter, Beloved. She plays the daughter that Sethe killed, the daugh
ter who comes back to life 16 years after her mother murdered her so that she would not
grow up to be a slave. Newton plays the part with such maturity, one can only think of
her potential in future films.
The other two main actors give solid performances as well. Danny Glover is won
derful as Sethe's new lover Paul D., though his character is not developed as well as the
others. Kimberly Elise plays Sethe's younger daughter, Denver, in a role that demon
strates the quiet strength Morrison gave the character in her novel.
Director Demme tries to follow Morrison's storyline closely, though he loses much of
the background and thematic development in the book. This is expected, for Morrison's
"Beloved" spans too many ideas and charactcrs to be completely captured in even a
three-hour movie. Yet Demme does a translation that ties together the main aspects of
the book — in other words, yes, if you watch the movie instead of reading the book,
you'll be all set for your Area 1 discussion section.
Jonathan Demme's "Beloved" is beautiful, but perhaps 1 am too biased in reviewing
it. 1 love the novel too much, so much that even the memory of reading it two years ago
can bring a tight knot to my stomach, a tight knot that reminds me of its power. So when
I watched Oprah on the big screen, 1 thought, "This is not my' Beloved.' This is not the
'Beloved' I have in my head." So now I fear that my images from two years ago are jux
taposed with and almost overwhelmed by the cinematic images I saw on the screen.
But there's something about the magic of movies. And there's something about the
power of books. But I believe they are two completely different entities, which is why as
much as I am unconvinced by the movie adaptation, I value its cinematic effort.
