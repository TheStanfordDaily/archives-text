# An 'Apt' Retelling
## A 						creepy lesson to learn 
### 
Bryan Singer, the director who dazzled us in "The
Usual Suspects," has emerged with a darker, creepi
er film which causes us to think about ourselves.
"Apt Pupil," based on a novella in Stephen King's book
"Different Seasons," pits up-and-coming teen star Brad
Renfro ("Sleepers") against the distinguished Ian
McKellen ("Richard III"). And, for the most part, this
pairing drives the action set forth by the sure hands of
Singer.
Renfro is Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old set to graduate
early as the valedictorian from his high school. Following
a unit on the Holocaust, Todd becomes intrigued by the
Nazi regime and rushes to the library to analyze the his
torical materials. Coincidentally, Todd bumps into a for
mer Nazi war criminal (McKellen) on the bus, and he rec
ognizes him from his World War II photograph. So Todd
meticulously gathers fingerprint data to plug into the
computer system, and sure enough, the man in question
is Kurt Dussander, now a naturalized citizen named
Arthur Denker.
Todd blackmails Arthur into telling him stories about

the war camps and the Holocaust. However, the horrors
of the past emerge as more of a nightmare for Todd than
expected. Todd starts to do very poorly in classes, and he
has to visit his guidance counselor, played by the
embarassingly out-of-place David Schwimmer
("Friends"). A deal is then set: If Todd aces all of his finals,
then he can still be valedictorian and graduate with a 4.0.
The story itself is familiar to me, since I had already
read King's story. Two film classics of our generation have
already emerged from the novel, "Stand by Me" and"The
Shawshank Redemption." While it's unfair to compare
"Apt Pupil" to these fantastic films, Singer has quietly
directed another gem. He has driven himself to capture

faithfully the moody tension in the relationship between
Todd and Arthur.
"Apt Pupil" functions well as a psychological thriller
and shows us a new perspective on the continuing effects
of World War 11. I vividly remember the harrowing open
ing moments in "Saving Private Ryan," and here, we get a
more sullen treatment designed to investigate the after
math of the war. Arthur has lived quietly in his home,
buffering himself against terrible memories with loads of
alcohol and cigarettes. The reality becomes too much for
Arthur when Todd demands that he tell war stories and
march in a Nazi uniform.
Some scenes, I admit, are rather hard to sit through.
Even though the violence here is hardly gratuitous, this
isn't subject matter for the weak at heart. And I must say
that whoever taught Singer how to direct did a great job.
His latest, "Apt Pupil," reaps full potential from its two
lead actors and effectively shows us the dangers of mess
ing with evil.
