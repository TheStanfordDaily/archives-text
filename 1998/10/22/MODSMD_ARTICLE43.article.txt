# 'Happiness’?
## This one won't leave you in a good mood 
### 
Talk about an oxymoron. There
isn't a single moment of joy in this
movie.
Then again, I think that's the point. No
matter how happy we claim to be, there is
always some tragedy that we're trying to
hide. In "Happiness," director Todd
Solondz's mission is to expose the slimy
humanity beneath the "ideal" American
middle class.
In one scene, Bill Maplewood (Dylan
Baker) has a fantasy sequence in which he
walks into a beautiful park and violently
guns down several of the picnickers. Does
that sound strange coming from a thera
pist with a picture-perfect suburban fam
ily? That's nothing; Bill happens to have a
certain liking for little boys, particularly

his son Billy's (Rufus Read) classmates.
Bill is married to Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson), and Trish has two sisters,
Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Joy (Jane
Adams). The three sisters provide a con
nection between a dozen or so assorted
characters. There's no real protagonist in
"Happiness;" we just jump in and out of
these twisted peoples' lives. The bits we
see can be funny, tragically romantic or
just downright disgusting.
Helen is a writer who breathes new life
into the term "phony." Her next-door
neighbor Allen (Phillip Seymour) is a
dorky cubicle-jockey who silently lusts
after her. Meanwhile, Allen has an admir
er of his own, the ice cream-loving
Kristina (Camryn Manheim); her secret

may be the worst of all.
This movie definitely has some charm.
Set in Solondz's home state of New Jersey,
it is a means of unleashing some of his
childhood bitterness in a way that's both
funny and disturbing. The theme was
enough to win "Happiness" as much
praise at the Cannes Film Festival as his
first film, "Welcome to the Dollhouse,"
got at Sundance.
But a great theme isn't enough for
audiences. The truth is, "Happiness" is
lacking the thing that made "Dollhouse" a
success: a captivating and interesting
story. It clocks in at over two hours, and I
came away feeling like I could have gotten
the same message from a shorter film.
"Happiness" doesn't give us the proper

emotional connection to the characters,
either. This is a real shame because the
actors do a terrific job. We aren't given
enough time to love them before we
begin to despise them, and in the end it
seems like none of them has made that
key step toward a better life.
Solondz has something great here, but
it doesn't get carried across to the audi
ence clearly enough. Most people will
walk out of this movie feeling disgusted,
and for this reason I can't recommend it
But if you're an open-minded, artsy-fart
sy type who is as brave in watching it as
Solondz was in making it, then you just
might get it
