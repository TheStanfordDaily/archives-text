# Technicolor teaser
## 'Pleasantville' shows that life isn't always black and white 
### 
Do you remember the moment in "Schindler's List"
when a little girl's coat shows up bright red, in
contrast to the black and white of the rest of the
film? That scene demonstrated the emotional power of
color. "Pleasantville" takes that idea one step further,
gradually painting a black-and-white world with the
Technicolor rainbow.
The movie centers on David (Tobey Maguire) and his
sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), a pair of modern
day teenagers who magically end up in David's favorite
television program, "Pleasantville." They become two of
the show's main characters, Bud and Mary Sue Parker.
The world of "Pleasantville" is that of your basic 1950s
family show — the soda shop is the perfect hangout, the
basketball team never misses a shot, there are no minori
ties in sight and the world is clearly black and white.
David implores his sister to play along with the show so
they won't blow their cover, but Jennifer isn't so keen on
living in a non-feminist society. She introduces the con
cept of sex to her standard-issue boyfriend, and before
long all the kids are doing it. Mysteriously, Lover's Lane
turns green and Jennifer's friends start taking on flesh
tones.

Bud and Mary Sue's mother, Betty Parker (loan Allen),
is also feeling the onset of feminism. After years of being
happy to make dinner for Mr. Parker (William H. Macy),
she is contemplating an affair with the soda shop owner,
Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels). Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson has
found that there's more to life than flipping burgers and
is discovering the joys of painting in color — resulting in
some of the movie's most breathtaking scenes.
Naturally, there are some who would rather leave
things as they were. Big Bob (J.T. Walsh),
Pleasantville's mayor, leads a group of townspeople who
want to issue laws that hinder the ways of the "coloreds."
This is plot that could easily fall apart, but it is carried
along by a great storyteller and subtle special effects.
Writer / director Gary Ross also co-wrote the movie
"Big," another film about a kid doing wonderful things
out of his element. This time, Ross' formula works to
summarize the social struggles and breakthroughs of the
last half-century. There is no longer such thing as a clear
cut American dream. As each person uncovers his or her
true calling, it is revealed in glorious color — a wonder
ful use of symbolism.
Ross and his fellow producers would rather credit the

movie's special effects for its success, since over 15
months were spent in post-production. The film was shot
in color and parts were digitally converted to black and
white, meaning that Ross had no idea what his film would
really look like until over a year after he shot it.
"Pleasantville" has over 1,700 digital effect shots (the
average Hollywood action film has no more than 400),
making it the largest digital effects movie ever produced.
"Pleasantville" is about more than just the apprecia
tion of color. It's a great film for people of all ages to see.
