## lisahall 'isthisreal?' 
### 
Looking at the cover of lisahall's
album, "isthisreal?" you might
think that this is just another
repetitious, angst-ridden band fronted
by a pale, emaciated-looking woman
who's generally pissed off at the world.
Instead, you'll find a multi-talented,
wide-ranging band fronted by a pale,
emaciated-looking woman who's gen
erally pissed off at the world.
Excepting its name (a slightly preten
tious "despacing" of lead singer Lisa
Hall's appellation), the band brings
forth a swell of originality in its music,
balanced well with a thoughtful, retro
spective undertone.
The album begins with "comatose," a
simple but effective tune with slow
drum and bass interludes among heavy
guitars and vocals. Reflective of other
songs on the album, "comatose" mixes
fast and slow sections enough to keep
the listener interested, but not so much
that the song loses continuity and flow.
Lisahall's music is mysterious at
times, yet occasionally cheery, with a
seductive quality that's part the Sundays
and part Tori Amos. With one tune you

think you're listening to a Bjorkish
underground mix, and with another
you're at a concert of the ill-fated
Breeders (this group is similar only in
Hall's voice, not in musical potential).
Some of the group's lyrics are heavi
ly contrived. On "I know I can do it,"for
example, Hall sings, "Everything is,
black and white now / Making me feel
like something I knew." But the music
itself largely conveys particular feelings
well enough that lyrics are almost
unnecessary. (But then what would you
sing along to?)
"Chocolate," on the other hand, is a
beautifully quiet tune with lyrics that
read almost like a Sappho poem:
"Breathe deeply / Caress me with your
breath / All my love for you melts like
chocolate / Soft and sticky sweet."
Despite some shortcomings, the
album is a great first effort, mostly
because it exhibits the band's variety of
styles and diversity in musical talent,
"isthisreal?" is definitely worth a sam
pling to find out if lisahall is indeed a
real find.
