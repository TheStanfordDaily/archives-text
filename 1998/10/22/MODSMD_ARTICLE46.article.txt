# Soul Coughing
## 'El Oso' 
### 
Back in the
summer of
1996, I
caught my first
glance of Soul

Coughing on the second stage of
Lollapalooza. From frontman M.
Doughtery's poetic verbal games, the
simple, laid-back grooves and beats
and Sebastian Steinberg's towering
upright bass, I knew that this was the
harbinger of a new musical genera
tion that would eventually displace
the dying cadre of wannabe, nihilis
tic grunge rockers at that time.
Now, Soul Coughing is back with
its third album, "El Oso." "Circles,"
the first single on the album, is a
catchy tune with lulling guitar lines.
On "$300," Doughtery's distorted
voice is accompanied by rolling
instrumentals. "Houston" 's weird
percussion and a distored organ

intro set the
stage for a pen
> sive, moving
ballad.

Even though
the funky grooves and Doughtery's
recognizable voice remain, this
album is less about the band's poeti
cal lyricism and more about its jour
ney into the musical unknown. For
instance, "Monster Man" is a fast
paced, distortion-filled piece that has
vestiges of punk written all over it.
Meanwhile, "Pensacola" is like a
Trent Reznor track. Slow, pulsating
electronic beats sway in the fore
ground while Doughtery's amor
phous, cryptic musings float non
chalantly in the background.
Doughtery's vocals accelerate in
intensity at the three-minute mark,
and even then they hardly resemble
his distinctive voice.
In all, "EI Oso" is an incredible
album with lots of distinctive styles
intermixed with lots of unique
instruments — various keyboards,
whistles, bells, guitars and overdubs.
In addition, all the band's musical
experimentation is combined into
one cohesive package that always
gets your foot a-tappin' and your
body a-rollin'.
