# The 						Bootleg Series Vol. 4'
## 'Bob Dylan Live 1966' 
### 
In May of 1966, Bob
Dylan, arguably the
greatest songwriter
ever, stood on stage

with the Hawks,
unquestionably one of the
greatest rock bands ever, and
made what was perhaps the
greatest music of his career.
And to nobody's surprise, the
audience hated it.
A legend among rock critics
and Dylan fans for three
decades, the Manchester Free
Trade Hall show has finally
seen the light of day in
Columbia's release of "The
Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob
Dylan Live 1966." The two
discs document one of the best
and most famous shows from
the controversial tour, during
which Dylan faced hostile
crowds who saw him as a trai
tor to the folk music move
ment.
At the heart of the contro
versy was Dylan's decision to
play electric music. Folk
purists, who had latched onto
Dylan for his protest anthems
"Blowin' in the Wind" and
"The Times They Are
A' Changin'thought that
Dylan was selling out in the

worst possible way, and they
showed up en masse to his
concerts to protest.
That protest took the form
of booing, disruptive clapping,
and finally the cry of "Judas!"
which makes this concert so
famous. Dylan, confident in
his artistic vision, responds by
shouting, "I don't believe you!
You're a liar!" and then, more
persuasively, playing absolutely
the most caustic version of
"Like a Rolling Stone" ever
recorded.
Song after song, Dylan and
the Hawks (who would later be
known simply as The Band)
draw on the crowd's hatred to
make music of almost fright
ening power. Tearing through
the back pages of Dylan's
acoustic catalog, they turn soft
ballads like "I Don't Believe
You" or "One Too Many
Mornings" into punkish bursts
of bile.
The songs from Dylan's
electric albums somehow
manage to rock even harder.
"Just Like Tom Thumb's

Blues" quivers
with a tension
that is only
relieved by Robbie

Robertson's dia
mond-sharp solo, while "Like a
Rolling Stone" is animated by
such sublime ire that it ought
to have torn down the walls of
the concert hall.
The raucous noise of the
second disc is a perfect com
plement to Dylan's beautiful,
prayer-like acoustic perfor
mance on the first disc.
Drawing heavily on his new
material, Dylan had the crowd
in the palm of his hand as he
played best-ever versions of
classics like "It's All Over Now,
Baby Blue" and "lust Like a
Woman." His singing is sur
prisingly smooth, his phrasing
perfect, and his harmonica
playing so far beyond anything
he had ever done that it sounds
like a wholly new instrument.
As a social document and
more importantly as a rock
concert, "Bob Dylan Live
1966" is essential. It is one of
the best albums of this or any
other year.
