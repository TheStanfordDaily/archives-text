# Interview
## Intermission Questionaire: Scott Bukatman A
						film studies prof opens up. 
### 
Professor Bukatman is author of "Terminal Identity:
The Virtual Subject in Postmodern Science Fiction" and
the British Film Institute volume on Blade Runner. Fie
teaches popular courses on subjects ranging from
Hollywood Musicals to Cyborgs and Synethetic Humans.
We caught up with Professor Bukatman for the inau
gural edition of what will hopefully become a permanent
Intermission feature.
Intermission: What is your favorite thing about
Stanford?
Scott Bukatman: I really like the little golf carts and
the way everything is so conveniently located. Did you
ever see the British television program, "The Prisoner"?
I: Least favorite?
SB: The raccoons frighten me a little.
I: Which one of all of your accomplishments here are
you most proud of?
SB: Hmmm. I think that the film-oriented communi
ty at Stanford is Finally beginning to come together more
regularly and more seriously, and I'm really pleased to
have been a part of that.
I: What is one thing that you don't think you'll ever
get to do?
SB: Get tenure, obviously.
I: What are your favorite qualities in people?
SB: A willingness to listen to Neil Diamond and take
long walks on the beach at sunset with a glass of chablis.
I: Least favorite?
SB: I hate pushy people! (I got these last 2 answers
from a 1972 Playboy magazine, but, you know, whatever
works.)
/: What is the best and worst thing about Stanford
students?
SB: The best thing is that they all get A's! The worst

thing is that if they don't, they sue you.
I: What book changed your life (if any)?
SB: What a sarcastically phrased question! Since 1 have
no life, I'll have to skip this one.

I: Favorite song or album?
SB: Uh 0h... this is the "how cool are you" question,
isn't it? Forget it, pal! Instead, I'll tell you that some of my
favorite comics of the last few years have been Preacher,
Madman, Sin City, Calvin & Hobbes and From Hell.
Astro City is pretty good, too.

I: What's your favorite film and why?
SB: Academics are not supposed to play favorites. But
since you're dragging it out of me, my favorite film is
"Some Came Running," a lurid but serious '50s melodra
ma starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Shirley
MacLaine. It's not a Rat Pack movie, but a terrifically
damning film about displacement, creativity, uncon
scious brutality and social hypocrisy. It's directed by a
Vincente Minnelli, a great director of musicals, and it
stars three singers, but there isn't any singing â€” just
complex interplay among the characters. Fantastic wide
screen color photography and a sensational score by
Elmer Bernstein top this thing off.
I: Favorite actor or actress?
SB: Which guy played "Ted" in those "Bill and Ted"
movies? Otherwise, Barbara Stanwyck and Robert
Mitchum have solid holds on my libido.
I: Who's your favorite artist?
SB: George Herriman, the creator of Krazy Kat.
I: If you could meet any personality, dead or alive,
who would it be and why?
SB: I'd like to spend a day with the Teletubbies.
I: What is your one weakness?
SB: Red Kryptonite.
I: Describe what you consider to be a perfect day.
SB: Well, an absence of Red Kryptonite is certainly a good
start.
I: Who was the most important person in your life?
SB: "Was?" What do you mean, "Was?" Is that if? I was
going to say that the next person I go out with will be the
most important, but now I'm too depressed.
I: Do you have a motto?
SB: "... it is the duty of every poet, and even of every
critic, to dance in respectful imitation of the child."
