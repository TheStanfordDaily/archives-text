### Roxy Sass 
Dear Roxy,
Last weekend, a group of friends and I
were watching old "CHiPS" reruns and
admiring Eric Estrada's fine bike. Yfe were
getting pretty giddy, and eventually a
night of harmless TV turned into a bout of
free-for-all group tickling. It was pretty
innocent until one of my male friends
reached up my shirt and tickled some
where off limits. This is a purely platonic
friend in whom I have no romantic inter
est, so J freaked out and left. Did I do the
right thingf Is it wrong to romp with a
friend? Is it wrong to romp with more than
one friendt At what point does the romp
ing become a dirty group thing which will
embarass us all?
Self-exiled from the Romper Room
Dear Romper,
You raise, by Sass-count, three important
and separate questions:
A) Should I hook up witli my friend?
B) Should 1 hook up in a Big Group
Thing?
C) Should I hook up with my friends in
a Big Group Thing?
Miss Sass has a theory that every friend
ship reaches that ambiguous phase sooner
or later. One friend of Miss Sass' once had a
hometown girl that he wanted to become
"more than friends" with for months. She
didn't figure out until three days before he
came to Stanford as a freshman that she
agreed. Heck of a time for a change of
heart.
But even if you and your "platonic"
friend have decided not to allow animal lust
to enter the equation, he may need a little
reminder once in a while. If you've both
decided that goodnight hugs will be the
limit of your physical involvement, don't let
him get away with a breach of contract
However, depending on the circum
stances, your best friends can become your
best more than-friends, in the broader rela
tionship sense. Who else knows more about
you? file things you like. The things you
don't like.
Say you were a radical vegan. That ran
dom cute boy in Comm class wouldn't
know that inviting you to the annual Yost
Crawfish Boil would kill his chances of
winning you over. Your best friend, howev
er, would make sure to provide you with a
huge helping of rice and beans at the All-
Co-op Potluck. He would probably even
scare up some Rice Dream for you.
And in the sack, your lines of communi
cation with your best friend are probably
more open than with that guy you met at
the concert last Thursday at Chi Theta Chi.

It's difficult enough to talk about exactly
how you want your "Hobart emptied"
without having to remember your partner's
name.
As for Big Group Things, Miss Sass
would like to quote University President
Gerhard Casper: "Go for it!"
Miss Sass has a female friend who once
ended up on a ski trip with several guy
friends. After a day spent out in the cold
snow and a couple of cocoas laced with
peppermint schnapps, our heroine found
herself with two willing male companions
ready to warm things up. She doubled her
pleasure and doubled her fun.
Of course, first make sure that all parties
are interested and completely comfortable
with sharing. But once y'all are sure you're
ready—and that includes contraception
and STD prevention methods — let your
imagination and your collective libido do
the walking.
Don't worry too much about what con
figurations work. Ttoo-on-one may get the
most lip service. But a female friend tells
Miss Sass, "In a two-on-one with two guys,
usually the only contact between the guys is
the occasional high-five."
More creative folks can work with seem
ingly bizarre collections of boys, girls,
inflatable dolls and other toys. Some may
feel more comfortable with standard-issue
stuff in such a strange situation, but others
suspend disbelief and try things they would
be ashamed to ask their serious love inter
ests to attempt, for fear it might cause
strained neck muscles or the like.
Which brings Miss Sass to the final point
of your question: should all of you do the
deeds together? Assuming that all of the
possible hang-ups mentioned above have
been worked out, Miss Sass doesn't see why
you couldn't all have your own "Party of
Pive."
It would certainly save you all the time
you would have spent gossiping about who
got together with whom last Saturday
night.
Yours,
Roxy Sass
