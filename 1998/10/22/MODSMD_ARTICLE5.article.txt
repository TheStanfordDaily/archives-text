# Speakers decry 'assault on liberty'
## Kors and Silvergate call on libertarians to remain firm 
### Sarah Rapawy 
Alan Kors, professor of history
at University of Pennsylvania, and
Harvey Silvergate, civil liberties
lawyer and member of the Massa
chusetts chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, spoke at the
Hoover Institute yesterday about
what Kors called the "assault on lib
erty and dignity on American uni
versity campuses".
Kors and Silvergate championed
freedom of speech, arguing that
through restrictive speech codes,
judicial committees, sensitivity
training and even freshman orienta
tions, the academic left is assuming
a new form of tyranny on college
campuses, stifling the expression of

any conservative, non-politically
correct or somehow radical opin
ion.
Kors came to national attention
in 1993 with his defense of Eden Ja
cobowitz, a student at the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania. As a freshman,
Jacobowitz shouted out his window
to a group of black women singing
in a sorority event, "Shut up, you
water buffalo!"
Jacobowitz was accused of vio
lating the campus' speech code, and
Kors stated that this was part of the
university's double standard, toler
ating offensive liberal remarks
while rebuking those of conserva
tives.
Kors argued that Jacobowitz,
who was Jewish and attended He

brew language school, had actually
translated the Hebrew slang term
"behema," which is used to de
scribe rowdy people. The university
dropped the case when Kors went
public.
"True pluralism," stated Kors,
"should include neo-Marxist insti
tutes, Catholic seminaries .... If
Stanford has a Women's Center,
why is there not a Jewish cultural
center where Orthodox and Ha
sidic Jews try and dissuade agnos
tics?"
Through residential program
ming, judicial systems and the like,
Kors argued that universities corre
late genetics and culture, indoctri
nating new students with "officially
designated identities."

"This has worsened, not bet
tered, human rights on universities.
Campuses have become ever more
segregated and Balkanized
Authentic liberation is the right to
distinguish oneself," said Kors.
There are currently over 80 cam
puses nationwide with speech
codes, and Kors and Silvergate cite
numerous examples in their book,
"The Shadow University," of what
they deem blatant violations of the
First Amendment.
Violations, according to the pair,
include anything from Carnegie-
Mellon University's dismissal in
1991 of a Catholic residence advisor
who refused to wear a symbol of gay
