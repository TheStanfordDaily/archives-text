# Climbing wall coming soon
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
Almost two years after special
fee approval, the long-awaited
Stanford indoor climbing wall will
finally become a reality by the end
of fall quarter.
Students voted to give around
$25,(KM) to the Climbing Wall Club
for construction and maintenance
in 1997.

Now that the club has approval
from the Department of Athletics,
the contractor CompWall will
begin work as soon as the paper
work is complete. The project is
likely to take two weeks to engi
neer and two weeks more to con
struct.
Construction has been assured
since the confirmation of the space
from the Athletics Department last
week. The climbing gym will be lo
cated on old racquetball courts
near the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium. Its construction will accom
pany renovations to the tennis
courts.
Several years have passed since
the initial conception of the climb
ing gym project. Club president
Trevor Bezdek and other members
explained that the challenges have
been funding, liability and space.
"The group in past years
couldn't get approval because of li
ability issues," said Bezdek, a se
nior. "We had to go through Risk
Management to prove that we
wouldn't be negligent."
Other club members echoed
Bezdek's impatience.
"Basically what it boils down to
is that we've had to wait for the
Athletics Department to confirm
our space," said junior Dennis
Murphree. "They switched our
space from inside to outside and
back to inside."
Since the recent approval for an
indoor gym facility, the climbing
wall will likely be in place by the
end of fall quarter.

The idea for the climbing wall
originated around eight years ago
in the geology class on wilderness
skills, now part of the Department
for Geological and Environmental
Sciences. Instructor Dennis Bird
instigated the initial idea with a hy
pothetical recommendation.
"I kind of dropped the seed
when I said "what you guys need
around here is a climbing gym.' "
said Bird, a professor of Geological
and Environmental Sciences.
Bird noted that Stanford stu
dents in the past have had to be re
sourceful about finding climbing
locations on campus. Stanford
climbers had made use of the
Quad, the Art Building and the
Chemistry Building until the Uni
versity intervened and imposed
regulations.
"I was 15 feet up on the wall of
Memorial Church during the '89
earthquake," said Bird, who is
thrilled with the prospect of a prop
er climbing wall on campus. "Let
me know when it opens â€” 1 want to
be first in line."
Bezdek has expressed hope that
the wall will form a central gather
ing place for the campus climbing
community. He anticipates possi
bility of overlap with other clubs
such as Outdoor Education Pro
gram and Redwood Climbing

Club.
Sophomore Andrew Davis, co
chair of the Redwood Climbing
Club, foresees helping with in
struction when the wall is complet
ed.
"I'm sure that having the wall on
campus will be a great way for
climbers to meet and share skills,"
Davis said, adding that he foresees
cooperation between the various
climbing clubs once the wall comes
closer to fruition.
Climbers uniformly hope that
the wall will encourage more of the
Stanford community to take part in
the sport. Students seem to agree.
"I was definitely surprised that
Stanford didn't have [a climbing
wall] when 1 looked here, since
they are all over the East Coast,
like at Cornell, Dartmouth and
Bowdoin," said junior Jon Kart. "I
think it will definitely be a nice
touch to have one here on cam
pus."
Current climbers agree.
"1 really think this will provide
an official and natural congrega
tion spot for climbers," Murphree
said. "We've had to wait a long
time and really hold onto our
hopes. But we know how great it
would be to have a wall, and we've
all been determined for that pur
pose."
