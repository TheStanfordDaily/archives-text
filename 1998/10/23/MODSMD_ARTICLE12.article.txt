# Eco-terrorists strike in Colorado

VAIL, Colo. (AP) — An environmental group has
taken responsibility for a series of fires on Vail Moun
tain, transforming the blazes into what may be the
costliest act of eco-terrorism in the nation's history.
The Earth Liberation Front, linked to arson inci
dents across the Northwest, said it torched the buildings
and chairlifts to protest an expansion plan by the
nation's busiest ski resort.
The group said it set the fires — estimated to have
caused $12 million in damage — "on behalf of the
lynx." And it vowed to "be back" if Vail encroached on
roadless land again.
"We are currently investigating the content, credi
bility and origin of this message," Eagle County sher
iffs spokeswoman Kim Andree said Wednesday.
Paul Witt, Vail Associates spokesman, said, "We are
aware of the claim and are leaving it to authorities to

investigate.
Seven separate fires, reported around 4 a.m. Mon
day. destroyed three buildings and damaged four chair
lifts at the chic resort in the heart of the Colorado
mountains, 1 (K) miles west of Denver.
Last week. Vail cleared a key hurdle in its bid to
become even larger when a federal judge dismissed a
suit by environmentalists who said the 885-acre expan
sion could harm the planned reintroduction of lynx. Six
days ago, crews began clearing trees and erecting
fences. Then came the fires, which were denounced by
environmentalists involved in the fight against Vail.
Barry Clausen of North American Research, a
Eureka, Calif., group that tracks environmental crimes,
said more than 1,500 eco-terrorism crimes have been
documented in the past decade, including arson and
bombings.
