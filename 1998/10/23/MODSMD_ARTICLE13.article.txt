QUEENSTOWN, Md. (AP) â€” Returning to trou
bled Mideast peace talks. President Clinton appealed
to Israeli and Palestinian leaders to close a land-for
peace accord today. "The hardest decisions now at last
are on the table," he said.
Clinton rejoined discussions on Maryland's Eastern
Shore after a week of hard bargaining and a threat by
Israelis to bolt unless they won more Palestinian con
cessions on security and other issues regarding control
of the West Bank.
The president and his top aides today held three
way talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for
the third time in eight days after intense overnight
negotiating with both sides on a U.S. plan.
The meeting lasted for one hour and then Clinton
began shuttling between the two leaders, who were sta
tioned in separate dining rooms.
Netanyahu and Arafat, sitting side by side on a
couch with notepads on their laps, discussed details of a
deal for 20 minutes with the Palestinian leader using an
Arabic translator. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said. Clinton and officials from the Israeli and
Palestinian delegations remained in the Wye Woods
Conference Center, talking in separate groups.
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart suggested
Clinton was hoping to seal a deal. "The tough issues are

on the table and we're looking to spend today focusing
on how we get decisions," Lockhart said.
Clinton greeted Arafat at 10:30 a.m. before a roaring
fireplace in the conference center's main dining room.
Netanyahu arrived a few minutes later, said Lock
hart, who described the atmosphere as "cordial and
businesslike."
King Hussein of Jordan also returned to the talks
today. He was part of discussions at Wye on Tuesday.
He made peace with Israel in 1994.
Netanyahu, who had packed his bags and ordered
his plane on standby Wednesday for a planned mid
night walkout, agreed to stay after advancing security
guarantees in talks with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and CIA Director George Tenet, Israeli and
U.S. officials said.
"There was progress on security," Netanyahu
spokesman Aviv Bushinsky confirmed today as Pales
tinian claimed "the security file was closed."
The two sides reached agreement on an operating
system to counter terrorism and included a specific
timetable for Palestinians to make arrests, according to
a diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The Central Intelligence Agency is to
supervise security measures.
"The hardest decisions now at last are on the table,"
Clinton said.
