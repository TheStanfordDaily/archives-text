Restaurants to be taxed on tips
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Internal Revenue
Service has won another round in its long court bat
tle to force restaurants to cough up payroll taxes on
tips, even if they're not reported to employers as
required by waiters, waitresses, busboys and bar
tenders.
Although the IRS insists its new focus is a volun
tary program based on educating restaurant employ
ees, the recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision marks
the second time a federal appellate court has certified
the government's authority over tips.
The National Restaurant Association promised
Thursday to continue the fight to shift the IRS tax
burden to the employees.

Recall on toy cars and trucks
WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents should
remove the 6-volt batteries from kids' Power Wheels
cars and trucks because faulty wiring can cause them
to erupt in flame, the government said Thursday in
announcing one of the biggest toy recalls ever.
Fisher-Price, the toys' maker, has agreed to make
free repairs on up to 10 million Barbie Jeeps, Big
Jakes and Extreme Machines sold in the last 14 years.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission said
flawed electrical systems have sparked 150 fires,
burning nine children.
Parents were told to remove the car's batteries
and take the toy to a Fisher-Price repair shop for a
free overhaul.
