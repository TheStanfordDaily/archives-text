Keep rivalry with Berkeley
healthy hy refraining from
vengeance and animosity

EVERYONE NEEDS A rival. Ever
since there's been a Stanford and a
IJC-Berkeley, there's been a rival
ry. and we hope there'll always be one.
Competition with Cal, and the Big Game
in particular, give all of us something to
cheer about and laugh about.
However, the rivalry should be about
both sides enjoying it rather than one side
attempting to ruin it for the other. Certain
ly. we don't think Big Game would be Big
Game without the Tree, and we applaud
both universities for working together to
see that the Tree costume is returned to us
by whomever stole it on Saturday.
The recent spirit of cooperation
between both universities to make Big
Game the best it can be for both sides is a
very promising trend, but if those who stole
the Tree don't return it, they risk making
Big Game sadder for both schools.
II the Tree isn't returned, Cal may not
allow Oski. its own mascot, to perform at
Big Game either. No one wants a bearless,
deforested Big Game.
In addition, the Tree represents a lot of
hard work and a sizeable chunk of money
for the Band, as well as an integral part of
its performance. Having it stolen is far
more to them than just an embarrassment.

In general, we manage our rivalry with
Cal in a civilized way. We remember how
much our schools actually have to offer

each other, and our cooperative relation
ship in academic and other fields is just as
important as our competitive one.
Therefore, we urge Stanford fans to
respect the efforts of the two universities to
return the Tree and not to make the situa
tion worse with any reprisals aimed at
Berkeley, or with a general increase in ani
mosity toward what ought to be a respect
ed rather than a hated rival. Anything that
turns the rivalry uglier increases the chance
that we won't have mascots at game time.
In the last lew years there's been a dis
turbing dimension to the pre-Big Game
spirit. Two years ago at Cal, the Tree was
attacked after the game and his costume
torn up bv Cal fans. Last year, here, fans
invaded the field and tore down goal posts.
It's very sad that we have to hold our
breath before the game this year and say,
"Hope nothing really bad happens." Any
violence of the kind we have seen in the
past two years is completely unacceptable,
first for the sake of those who are hurt, but
also for the rest of us who are ashamed of
our own fellow fans.
Stanford and Cal are both unusual
among top academic institutions in that
their rivalry is meaningful both in athletic
terms and in how much a part it is of uni
versity spirit. For that rivalry to be mean
ingful, it shouldn't be about how bad Cal
is and what we can do to embarrass or
inconvenience them off of the football
field. It should be about what we can do to
make Stanford a place we're proud to
attend.
That, combined with a sound whipping
on the gridiron, is the only kind of bragging
rights we're interested in.
