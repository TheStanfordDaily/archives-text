# This week in Stanford history October 23, 1939

THIS WEEK IN 1939, campus fraternities
announced that the three-day pledge initia
tion period known as "Hell week" went
according to plans. According to one participant,
the previous week's initiation was "swell — just
swell."
On Monday, Oct. 23. the Daily reported that 350
pledges had endured the previous week's tortures
to become "full-fledged Row men."
The reported rituals included the Phi Delt
clothes scramble, in which naked, blindfolded fra
ternity members searched for their own clothes.
One unnamed fraternity favored the "air raid," in
which pledges lay on their backs at the bottom of a
stairwell. Upperclassmen then threw eggs at the
hapless frat-boy hopefuls.
Sorority women gave tepid approval of the pro
cess. One Delta Gamma woman said, "We didn't
like being kept awake by the noise, but we certain
ly enjoyed having our cars washed by the pledges of
neighboring houses."
In unrelated news, the ASSU squeaked in under
a tight deadline to procure a band for the upcoming
Big Game Dance. The story made the front page of
the Daily every day during the week of Oct. 23 to
Oct. 27.
On Tuesday, the Executive Committee of the
ASSU voted to hold the dance off campus at the

Millhrae Club. The committee also set a 4K-hour
deadline to find a $S(X) band to play at the event.
That deadline was close to expiring Thursday night
as negotiators stalled trying to come to consensus
on terms of a contract. At the last minute, agent
Ames Bishop agreed to let his Jimmy Grier
Orchestra play for the $S(X) fee.
Big Game Dance was saved, and happy Stanford
students lined up to buy tickets. The tickets, called
"bids," allowed admission, dancing, drinks and
refreshments for the low, low price of $5.
That same week, seniors paid 50 cents to partic
ipate in Friday's Class of '40 skate day at a rink in
San Mateo.
And throngs of cheering students showed up at
the Palo Alto Southern Pacific Train Station after a
campus parade. The well-wishers turned out for the
Stanford football team, which was taking the train
up to the University of Washington to play the
Huskies.
Thursday's Daily reported that although the
Stanford team wasn't too stellar, they were fresh
from a "sparkling moral victory" over UCLA and
would surely trounce the Huskies. The Stanford
team was favored by a slight margin for the first
time in the season.
Unfortunately, the Daily reported the following
Monday that the Huskies beat Stanford 8-5.
