## True confessions of a Co Ho Ho 
### 
About a year
ago, I applied for
a job at the Stan
ford Coffee House.
Little did I know, as I
completed a stack of tax
forms and signed all sorts
of "Conditions for

Employment" contracts, that I would enter
a surreal landscape of precious little espres
so and very many stereotypes.
Okay, I admit that I knew all about the
Co Ho stereotypes. I went to work there
because I, too, wished to dye my hair taste
less colors and serve lattes to my fellow stu
dents with an inexplicably "cooler-than
thou" flair. Now that I've been involved in
this business for a while, I suppose I can
speak with the voice of authority about the
lifestyle of a Coffee House employee, and
why we charge $1.85 for a frosty mint.
Allow me to debunk a few myths about the
good people who take your money.
1. All of the employees are funny looking.
Far be it for me to claim any expert
knowledge of what the typical Stanford stu
dent looks like. I would note, however, that
the hapless folk behind the counter can't be
that much more freakish than frat pledges
with catchy slogans felt-penned across their
briefs, or John Davi in a tank top. The Co
Ho, moreover, can't be held responsible for
individual fashion no-no's. I.for example,
bought my plastic pants long before I came
to Palo Alto, and I chopped off all my hair
because I lost a bet. The myth of work-influ
enced appearance is only productive when I
go home, as it makes my mother feel better
to attribute my tattoos to peer pressure.
2. We hold your naive orders for coffee in
contempt and complete them whenever we
feel like it.

I'm saddened by the popular eonception
that we at the Co Ho ignore the Golden
Rule and treat others as it amuses us to treat
them. We do in fact take caffeine depen
dency seriously, and we realize that people
expect to receive it in a timely manner. The
"two-hour drink" phenomenon can best be
explained as the combination of three fac
tors.
First, a large portion of the Stanford pop
ulation seems to need coffee for itself and
its 4() closest friends at approximately 11
p.m. on any given night. Even a battalion of
foolishly coiffed drink attendants can be no
match for the Million Man Mocha.
The second factor is what 1 call the "idiot
tax." When a customer returns five minutes
after I've made her drink to whine that she
"didn't know that frosty mints are cold," I
am obliged to stop what I'm doing and
laugh at her. The line behind said individu
al must suffer an extended wait for this; it's
really out of my hands.
Finally. I admit that my natural tendency
toward altruism is somewhat dulled when
customers decide to be downright mean.
Last week, a man threatened to slap me
when I apologetically informed him that we
had run out of chicken. Spitting on a burri
to takes time; logically, his order was not
completed as promptly as it might have
been.
3. We play music specially designed to
annoy you.
Before 1 fully address this subject, I
would like to point out that the Coffee
House is not the 24-hour study room, nor is
it Meyer Library. If one insists upon con
ducting a review section for CS 107 in a
place which is social by design, one must
expect a certain amount of background
noise.

Having said this, I am now prepared to
defend the musical stylings of the Co Ho to
any and all nitpickers. I cannot be held per
sonally responsible for everything that pass
es through the speakers, as there is a bitter
and ongoing struggle behind the counter as
to whose five CDs will hold places of honor
in the stereo.
1 will maintain, however, that the occa
sional field trip beyond the scope of one's
preferred musical genre should be regarded
as character-building rather than patently
offensive. I dislike Swedish dance music as
much as the next person, but I will admit the
possibility that it is character-building in the
long run.
4. We're actually bald, freakish robots, engi
neered by Starbucks and Stanford Universi
ty to stage a subtle takeover of your stock
options and your souls.
The crusty old tip jar next to the cash
register is no mere formality; it's actually
my sole means of survival. If I were truly
capable of and contracted to drain the stu
dent body of its laundry quarters and its
life essence, I would earn far more than
the campus-controlled minimum wage. I
don't.
I'm not attempting to inspire admiration,
or even additions to the tip jar, by offering
up a slice of life at the Coffee House. Mv
point, quite simply, is that my fellow
drudges and I deserve no more praise or
censure than any other member of the cam
pus population. We merely pay less for cof
fee and have more espresso stains on our
shoes than most people do.
Besides, robots don't need money.

Lauren Oster, a junior majoring in English,
would like to assure Dan Geyser that she
wears pants while running around behind
the counter.
