# A 						view from the hill
## Heaven is a Stanford water polo game

Times come when the world
flushes a store of putrid unhappiness
on our lives and leaves us cursing
through the mess. For many on campus, last
week was such a time. With every aspect of
living gone awry, I felt destined for an
indefinite depression. And then I went to a
water polo game and life got better for a
while.
Polo games are the perfect reminder of
why I love this school.
Approaching deGuerre, I passed
Maples Pavilion (Maples was a Phi Delt, by
the way), and gave a quick thought to last
year's Final Four. I walked down the path,
heard a tennis ball pop in the multimillion
dollar Taube Family Tennis Stadium and
then reached olympic-caliber deGuerre. A
nice, elderly gentleman (most likely a vol
unteer) checked my 113 and in 1 went.
Walking behind the bleachers I watched

my friend pull off a preposterously acrobat
ic dive and caught a glimpse of our champi
onship swim team at practice. I rounded the
corners of the pool, found a couple of
friends, and had a seat on the grass.
Sprawled around me in all directions
were some of the world's most gifted stu
dents and athletes. The sky was a perfect
Palo Alto blue. It had been for weeks. The
temperature was 72 degrees. It had been
for weeks.
Coach Dettamanti had his last words
with the team and then they dove in to get
things started. I find it ineffably wonderful
to watch a sport in which you take the play
ing field by diving into an outdoor pool. I
am envious of people who grew up going to
the pool every day. Stanford does not have
an indoor pool. The weather is too nice.
Californians are yawning. They know
this place is nice; many have wanted to go

here their whole lives. Much of Stanford's
prowess comes from the fact that California
is almost paradise and no one wants to
leave. Hordes of talented Californian kids
grow up dreaming about coming here, hop
ing they don't have to settle for Berkeley.
Polo players and computer scientists alike
know this is what they want.
I am not a great athlete and I am not a
computer scientist. I am not from Califor
nia and I have no real claim to this oppor
tunity but I'm here anyway and that Satur
day I was at a polo game in awe.
Waiting for the game to get going and
for Brian Heifferon's victorious swim off, I
watched through the fence, where a group
of alumni were playing football shirtless in
the sun. Some graduated years ago but still
live in the area. Who would leave?
A whistle started the polo game but as
my eyes headed back towards the pool they

stalled on the swimming facility as a whole.
Its perfect symmetry, its grand yet unas
suming design and the woman twisting
through the air before me all slammed
home how absolutely first class our school's
athletics are.
As my gaze headed back to the game, it
got diverted by a drop-dead gorgeous
blonde woman in the stands across the way.
But some guy in a UCLA water polo jack
et sat down next to her, so I cursed UCLA
and returned to the game. We were already
beating the snot out of Pepperdine, the
defending national champions.
And so before me was every indication
of an impeccable athletic system. Above
me was idyllic sky and around me sprawled
the Stanford student body.
What a place this is.
Some out there are waiting to pounce on
me for not mentioning academics. I don't

have to. Any school that whines like mad
off over dropping to six in the U.S. News &
World Report rankings needs no more
praise of its intellect.
Our school is the best in the country, but
not because of academics. Don't get me
wrong. Our academics are outstanding, but
the atmosphere sets us apart. With every
thing gone wrong and more wrong to come,
with all the work in the world and personal
problems aplenty, you can go to a water
polo game at deGuerre.
You can go to deGuerre and lap up the
sun. You can go to deGuerre, sit amongst
the nation's brightest, forget your prob
lems, listen to the pool and enjoy.
