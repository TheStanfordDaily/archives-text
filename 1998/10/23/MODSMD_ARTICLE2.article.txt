## 
### Krista Glaser Contributing writer 
The United States military's
"don't ask. don't tell" policy is
"lousy." according to Rep. Barney
Frank, a preeminent gay-rights sup
porter.
Frank told a crowd of about 2(H) at
Kresge Auditorium last night that he
was severely disappointed by the pol
icy and that it was "carried out even
worse."
The "don't ask, don't tell" policy
bars openly lesbian, gay and bisexual
people from the armed forces.
As fellow panelist Law Prof. Janet
Halley argued, the policy is problem
atic since military officers can ask
members of the military about their
conduct and sexual orientation.
" The policy deeply dangers every
one involved," Halley said. "It leads
to homophobia and should be re
garded as bad policy."
In addition, Frank argued that the
Solomon Amendment, which denies
federal funding to law schools that do
not allow the military to recruit on
their campuses, can be fought politi
cally.
Voting is "our most perfected
weapon against homophobia," he
said.

Frank argued that if gay-rights
supporters paid more attention to the
political process, there would be no
Solomon Amendment.
Stanford currently does not allow
the military to recruit on campus as a
result of the military's policy.
Michelle Benecke. Co-Executive
Director of Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network and former U.S.
army commander, said time should
be spent "honoring the anti-discrimi
natory policy... here at Stanford."
Benecke's organization provides
servicemen and women with legal as
sistance when they are targeted by
the "don't ask. don't tell" policy.
She pointed out that under the
Solomon Amendment, students will
suffer by losing student loans as a re
sult of the University's decision.
As of April. Stanford Law School
had been able to avoid making any fi
nancial or policy decisions.
The panelists condemned the mil
itary for its alleged anti-gay attitudes.
"The military socializes soldiers to
treat gays and lesbians as second
class citizens," Benecke said.
She told the story of one of her
clients. Kevin Smith, who was at
tacked outside a uay bar in Texas. In
stead of pressing charges. Smith de
cided to hide the information be
cause he did not want the military to
know about his presence at a gay bar.
His sergeant, however, did find
out and instead of focusing on the
men who physically assaulted Smith,
the military launched an investiga
tion into Smith's personal life and
then discharged him.
Benecke said that although Gen.
Colin Powell, President Clinton and
other leaders promised "to not ask,
to not pursue or harass,... promises
have been broken."
Frank described former Sen. Sam
Nunn, a ranking Democrat who was
a driving force behind the policy, as
an "unremitted bigot."
Frank added humor throughout
his speech. When he talked of anti
gay-rights supporters who focused
on what occurs in the bedroom,
Frank asked, "Could we do it in the
living room? Please tell me what
room to use."
Frank also denounced the
hypocrisy of the right wing. He won
dered about right-wing memhers of
Congress who committed adultery
and broke up the marriages they re
garded as sacred.
Frank hopes to promote an end to
bigotry and wonders how he could
ever "promote homosexuality."
"Should I have a jingle?" he
asked.
After the presentations, audience
members questioned the panelists.
When one student asked Frank what
would happen if the commander-in
chief were gay, he responded, "I
wouldn't be spending as much time
on impeachment."
Stanford Law School and Out
law, Stanford Law Students for Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Equality,
sponsored the presentation. Assoc.
Law Prof. George Fisher moderated
the panel.
Outlaw invited the author of the
Solomon Amendment as well as sup
porters of the military's policy, but
no one replied to these invitations.
