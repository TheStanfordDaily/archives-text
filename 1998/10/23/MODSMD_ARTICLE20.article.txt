## Title hungry Soccer continues in MPSF 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
"Play each game as if it is the last."
This motto, posted in the locker
room of the No. 6 Stanford mens
soccer team, is the slogan that the
team has embraced for the season.
And it accurately sums up the in
tense attitude the team has adopted
and carried through the year.

MEN'S SOCCER

■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (10-3,3-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
at UC-Santa Barbara (2-11, 0-2),
7:30 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo (6-4-2,1 -1), 5 p.m.
"If we can play every game with
the passion and enthusiasm as it was
the last, we will be fine," said head
coach Bobby Clark. "We have to
create the ability to have that enthu
siasm for every game."
The main challenge for the Car
dinal (10-3, 3-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) this weekend
will be the test of its depth and en
durance as it hits the road for two
league games. The team will travel to
UC-Santa Barbara (2-11, 0-2)
tonight and Cal Poly-San Louis Obis
po (6-4-2,1-1 MPSF) on Sunday.
Stanford stepped up its play the
past few matches with a close 1 -0 loss
to then-No. 2 UCLA and a 2-1 upset
win against then-No. 6 Washington.
After two such games, some
teams might not be able to produce
the enthusiasm Clark refers to for
games against unranked opponents.
But if the words of the players reflect
their attitude, they feel the same way
as their coach.
"From our experience last year,
these games are more important than
the big games in our minds," said se
nior midfielder Aaron Jones.
Last season, after starting 15-0,
the Cardinal lost to then-No. 1 Indi
ana 2-1, then proceeded to lose its
final four games. Thus far, the squad
has capitalized on last year's experi
ences and looks to keep doing so.
"This team is mature enough to
realize how difficult road games are
against anyone," Bobby Clark said.
"The team is aware of what is at stake
and they know these are two impor
tant conference games. Any game on
the road is tough."
What is at stake for the Cardinal is
staying on par for the conference
lead. Currently, No. 15 Cal State-
Fullerton is atop the conference with
a 2-0 record, with Washington,
UCLA and Stanford one game back.
Of concern to the Cardinal this

weekend, however, are the Gauchos
and Mustangs. The Gauchos have
struggled this season and have tallied
only 19 goals, 13 coming in a blowout
of Menlo College. They dropped
their first two league games to Wash
ington and Oregon State.
Cal Poly has split its first two
MPSF games with a 4-0 loss to the
Huskies and 2-1 victory against the
Beavers. Senior Martin Haynes leads
the Mustangs with five goals, and ju
nior Brian Lange is just behind him
with four.
While preparing for games, how
ever, the Cardinal pays more atten
tion to itself than the opponent.
"The big thing is that we pay at
tention to and respect the other
teams, but are more concerned with
the way we play," Clark said.
And Stanford has been playing
well recently. Senior midfielder
Simon Elliott stole the show last
weekend as he tallied points on all
four of the team's scores, with a goal
and an assist in each game.
In Friday's game against Santa
Barbara, the Cardinal will have to go
without two of its senior starters, for
ward Adam Siegman and defender
Jamie Clark. Siegman is suffering
from a severe thigh bruise and his sta
tus is uncertain. After receiving his
fifth yellow card in the Cardinal's last
game, Jamie Clark is forced to sit out
one game. Redshirt sophomore
Chris Gores will make his first start of
the season in place of Clark.
"Gores has turned it up a level this
season," Jones said. "He is playing
like he deserves to be starting. He is
getting a chance to shine."
