Fired out from its grueling five
game victory against rival Pacific on
Tuesday, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team will look for a pair of
quick victories over the Arizona
schools this weekend.

With Arizona just two games back
of the Cardinal in the Pacific 10 Con
ference standings, however, a mental
letdown could be extremely costly
for the young Stanford team.
But don't bet on the Cardinal (15-
2 overall, 9-0 Pac-10) looking past the
Wildcats, or anyone, for that matter.
After all, Stanford hasn't won 34
consecutive conference matches by
taking any opponents lightly.
"[The Pacific match] was very im
portant for us," said junior outside
hitter Kerri Walsh. "It was a good
chance to compare our team to the
rest of the nation, and it is nice to win
that kind of match. But we realize
that we have to focus on the Arizona
matches.
"We never look past anyone," the
two-time Ail-American added. "It

has always been our philosophy to
focus on the match we are playing,
and that is exactly what we'll do this
weekend."
On the last weekend of Septem
ber, Stanford swept the Arizona
schools, but required four games
each night.
The Sun Devils will be the first of
the two teams to roll in to Maples
Pavilion, facing the conference-lead
ing Cardinal tonight at 7 p.m.
Arizona State (7-9, 4-5) has
dropped its last three Pac-10 match
es, including a five-game heartbreak
ing defeat at the hands of rival Ari
zona last Friday.
ASU is led by the powerful hitting
of sophomore Amanda Burbridge,
who is fourth in the Pac-10 with 4.71
kills per game.
The Wildcats (16-2, 7-2), on the
other hand, have won six of their last
seven matches. Arizona's only losses
on the year have come to the top two
teams in the Pac-10, Stanford and
use.
Right after the Pacific win, Stan
ford head coach Don Shaw recog
nized the importance of the Arizona
series.
"We are a little tired right now,"
Shaw said. "We will take [Wednes
day] off, but then we have to get our
focus back. We are in a great position
with a two-game lead, and we need to
take the rest of the year one match at
a time, starting on Friday."
