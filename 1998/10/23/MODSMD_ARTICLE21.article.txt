Fired out from its grueling five
game victory against rival Pacific on
Tuesday, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team will look for a pair of
quick victories over the Arizona
schools this weekend.

With Arizona just two games back
of the Cardinal in the Pacific 10 Con
ference standings, however, a mental
letdown could be extremely costly
for the young Stanford team.
But don't bet on the Cardinal (15-
2 overall, 9-0 Pac-10) looking past the
Wildcats, or anyone, for that matter.
After all, Stanford hasn't won 34
consecutive conference matches by
taking any opponents lightly.
"[The Pacific match] was very im
portant for us," said junior outside
hitter Kerri Walsh. "It was a good
chance to compare our team to the
rest of the nation, and it is nice to win
that kind of match. But we realize
that we have to focus on the Arizona
matches.
"We never look past anyone," the
two-time Ail-American added. "It

has always been our philosophy to
focus on the match we are playing,
and that is exactly what we'll do this
weekend."
On the last weekend of Septem
ber, Stanford swept the Arizona
schools, but required four games
each night.
The Sun Devils will be the first of
the two teams to roll in to Maples
Pavilion, facing the conference-lead
ing Cardinal tonight at 7 p.m.
Arizona State (7-9, 4-5) has
dropped its last three Pac-10 match
es, including a five-game heartbreak
ing defeat at the hands of rival Ari
zona last Friday.
ASU is led by the powerful hitting
of sophomore Amanda Burbridge,
who is fourth in the Pac-10 with 4.71
kills per game.
The Wildcats (16-2, 7-2), on the
other hand, have won six of their last
seven matches. Arizona's only losses
on the year have come to the top two
teams in the Pac-10, Stanford and
use.
Right after the Pacific win, Stan
ford head coach Don Shaw recog
nized the importance of the Arizona
series.
"We are a little tired right now,"
Shaw said. "We will take [Wednes
day] off, but then we have to get our
focus back. We are in a great position
with a two-game lead, and we need to
take the rest of the year one match at
a time, starting on Friday."
Although the last thing the team

itself can do is reflect on its progress
and national standing, the midway
point of the season provides a good
opportunity to analyze the team's de
velopment.
Junior Kerri Walsh has weathered
early-season shoulder surgery and re
turned to the floor as strong as ever,
recording 24 kills on Tuesday, includ

ing No. I ,(KX) for her career.
The freshmen have quickly ma
tured into a group of potent offensive
weapons, as Sara Sandrik and Tara
Conrad have been solid up the mid
dle and Michelle Chambers is emerg
ing as a reliable left outside hitter.
"I'm not a Kerri Walsh or a Kristin
Folkl, so I need to outsmart defens
es," Chambers said. "I try to put the
ball where there are no defenders and
provide some scoring for our of
fense."

After Tuesday's win, team captain
Sarah Neal offered her veteran per
spective on the progress of the Cardi
nal's first-year players.
" This season, we have gotten bet
ter with every match, especially the
freshmen," Neal said. "With so much
inexperience coming into the year, it
has been great to see people get more
confident.
"A lot of people have been betting
against us, hut our freshmen have
stepped into leadership roles and

helped us win. I think they are realiz
ing that at this level, being a freshman
isn't an excuse, and they have show
the ability to step up when it really
counts."
With sophomore middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer joining the fresh
men up front, the Stanford offense is
clearly well-rounded and powerful.
It defense, however, has not been
so solid of late. Although the Cardi
nal leads the nation in blocking, fun
damental breakdowns have led to

huge offensive outputs from Stan
ford's past two opponents.
"We haven't been doing anything
to stop opposing hitters," Shaw said.
"We have got to get back to basics
and work our defense back togeth
er."
Heading into the Arizona match
es, however, the reality of Stanford's
situation is that it has played well
enough to earn a nice cushion atop
the conference, and that unpre
dictable performances are only nat-

Ural from such an inexperienced
group.
"The reason our play is so up and
down is that we have so many young
players," Conrad said Tuesday. "We
aren't experienced with high intensi
ty and big-time matches, but we are
learning with every day."
As long as the younger players
continue to improve and become
more comfortable in the Stanford
system, the rest of the season looks
promising.
