# Card ready for showdown
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
As men's water polo head coach Dante Dettaman
ti put it, "To physically perform in an athletic event,
you have to be able to breathe."
The biggest obstacle facing the Stanford men's
water polo team right now is not so much the intense
competition it can expect from UCLA and Pacific this
weekend, but the illnesses that have plagued the team
for the last couple of weeks.
With at least half the team suffering from various
illnesses, the bench will have to come through strong
ly for the Cardinal.
"We need [the reserves] to really help us out, espe
cially against UCLA," Dettamanti said.

MEN'S WATER POLO

■ Tonight: No. 4 Stanford (13-3, 4-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) vs. No. 7 Pacific (6-9. 1-3), 12 p.m.
deGuerre Pool.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 3 UCLA (10-2, 3-0), 12 p.m.
deGuerre Pool.
Stanford begins the weekend with an Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation league game against Pacific on
Saturday then faces UCLA on Sunday. Both games
are scheduled for noon and will be held at deGuerre
pool. Last weekend, Stanford suffered an 8-7 loss to
UCLA in the semi-final match of the Northern Cali
fornia tournament. The Cardinal subsequently de
feated UOP 9-7 to take third place in the tournament.
Films of the matches against UOP and UCLA have
been integral in helping the team and the coaching

staff analyze their opponents — and their own perfor
mance.
"In looking at the films, you pick up a lot of things
you can't see in the pool," said Dettamanti.
Those weak points or difficulties that Stanford had
last weekend have been the focus of practices during
the past week.
"We've had the chance to work against the defense
UCLA runs on us, and also the six-on-five that other
teams run against us," Dettamanti said. "We might
even incorporate a bit of [UCLA's defense] in our de
fense."
It is critical that Stanford plays well in the next five
games, with two games each against No. 1 USC and
No. 2 UCLA.
If the Cardinal can defeat the top two teams it will
have the best record in the league, as well as the top
seed going into the MPSF championship tournament.
The two teams that will travel to NC A As are the team
with the best record and the team that wins the MPSF
tournament.
"This will make or break us," said Dettamanti.
"[Winning] could put us a long ways towards being
number one in the record and number one [in MPSF
tournament seeding].... When it comes down to
crunch time, that's a big deal."
In addition to trying to recover from an exhausting
five-game stretch last weekend, the players have the
stress of midterms to deal with. Practices this week
have been designed to get the squad rested and
healthy for the upcoming games.
"We're taking it easy," said Dettamanti. "The guys
are physically down and mentally up, but they need
some rest."
The coaching staff is also look
ing to make some adjustments in
the line-up in order to keep the
players as fresh as possible. Senior
Layne Beaubien, who was named
MPSF player of the week, led the
Cardinal in scoring with 13 points
last weekend and will be a key part
of the Stanford offense this week
end.
Juniors Sean Joy and Todd
Snider, along with freshman Onno
Koelman will be counted on to
contribute speed and depth from
the bench.
"We're counting on Todd and
Sean and Onno," said Dettamanti.
"We need to get the fast guys in
there in the first quarter so we can
really come out blasting. Todd is an
excellent shooter. We're going to
be using him more and more."
