# Needing to rebound
## Women take on rival Bears 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team's (7-5-2, 1-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) Sunday afternoon game
against the unranked California
Bears (8-6,3-1) has implications be
yond the traditional bragging rights
that this rivalry entails.

Although the cross-Bay rivalry
with Cal always adds to the intensity
of any matchup, this year the rivalry
seems on the periphery, as both
teams focus on attaining a hid to the
NCAA tournament. With only five
regular-season games left on the
Stanford schedule, each remaining
game has added significance.
Although the Pac-10 winner ob

tains an automatic bid to the tourna
ment, other teams can enter the
tournament based on rankings and
overall season performance.
"Obviously, it's a very important
game" said Stanford head coach
Steve Swanson. "Because it's Cal.
Because it's a Pac-10 game. There
are definitely implications for post
season play."
Stanford holds the advantage in
the 16-game rivalry: the Cardinal
leads the Bears 8-6-2. Last season,
the Bears suffered their worst loss of
the season, a 3-1 decision, at the
Farm.

■ Sunday: Stanford (7-5-2,1-3 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) at California (8-6,
3-1). 1 pm.
Cal and Stanford are both return
ing to competition after road trips
last weekend to play the Los Ange
les schools. Cal recorded a thrilling
2-1 double-overtime victory over
the UCLA Bruins before suffering
its first Pac-10 defeat of the season, a
2-0 loss to USC.
Stanford dropped both of its
weekend games in two very compet
itive encounters.
"This game is really important to
see if we can rebound and how we
respond" said sophomore goalkeep
er Carlv Sniolak. "We can't afford to
lose any more games."
Despite similar overall records,
Stanford has struggled in Pac-10

Sophomore forward Karin Brett and the women's soccer team face
a must-win game against rival California Sunday as they try to keep
their postseason hopes alive.
competition while Cal has attained
prominence in the standings. The
Cardinal has dropped four of its past
five games, including three confer
ence matches. This 1-3 conference
record places Stanford seventh in
the Pac-1() standings.
On the other hand, Cal stands
atop the conference standings along
with UCLA. Washington, and
Washington State.
In preparation for Sunday's
game, both teams look to establish
dominance early. The Bears have
been victorious in seven of eight
games when they score the first goal
of the game. When the Bears' oppo
nents seize the first scoring opportu
nity, Cal has lost all six of its games.
This season, Stanford has strug
gled to impose its style of play on its
opponents, especially in the first
half. This situation creates a sce
nario in which the Cardinal must
struggle for goals in the second half.
"We need to come out aggressive
in the first half and possess the ball
more so that we don't have to come
back in the second half," said senior
midfielder Tracye Lawyer.
Despite recent losses, a tie with
then-second-ranked Santa Clara
and a win over No. 15 Texas A & M
gives evidence of the caliber of play
which Stanford possesses.
"Overall, we have been consis
tent in the way we're playing,"
Swanson said. "We have lots of con
fidence."
