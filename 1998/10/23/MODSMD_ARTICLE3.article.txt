# Med student fund raising holds steady

A fund-raising campaign l or med
ical student research is generally on
target, having brought in $5 million in
the last year.
The Medical Student Scholar's
Program, expected to raise $20 mil
lion in five years, allows medical stu
dents to conduct research under fac
ulty supervision while relieving debt.
The program, which gives stu
dents academic credit, allows them to
develop their own project â€” they're
not just "tagging on" to a professor's
research, said Patricia Cross, associ
ate dean of student affairs and associ
ate structural biology professor.
"It's one of the best academic
ways for them to approach research,"
Cross said. "Here in this program,
they're involved in the creative input
and actually develop a project which
is their own."

Less money than originally antici
pated has been raised because plan
ning consumed the campaign's first
year, said Bruce Bingham, associate
director of medical development.
"It is a little behind where we want
to be. but we have every confidence
that we will reach the goal," he said.
"I think we're just fine."
The campaign's plan to raise the
remaining $15 million will be includ
ed in the School of Medicine's overall
fundraising strategy.
Last fall, the federal government,
questioning how medical schools
were using their funds, slashed pro
gram money, which forced Stanford
to expand its donor base. With prior
warning, the campaign was started a
year before government money ran
out to keep the 18-year-old program
alive.
About 80 medical students each
year receive program scholarships,
which have been $10,0(1) per project
since 1997. That's almost three-quar
ters of each class, according to Cross.
Most projects are accepted. Stu
dents submitted 78 proposals last
year, and 71 were funded, Bingham
said. They represent roughly three
quarters of the medical school's de
partments, from surgery to neurobi
ology, Cross said.
Alumni, former Stanford Hospi
tal patients, charitable foundations
and corporations donate money to
the campaign after "selective word
of-mouth advertising," Bingham
said.

A background in research is not
required for the program. In fact, fac
ulty encourage all students to pursue
research money.
"I'm glad to hear that people
without research experience were
encouraged to apply," said first-year
medical student Chaya Bhu
vaneswar. "People have done some
really cool things."
Tim Brazelton, a fifth-year med
ical student who received a program
scholarship his first year, had never
figured research into his medical ca
reer. But he liked the research so
much, he enrolled in the joint
Ph.D. / M.D. program.
Before attending Stanford, he
said, "I wasn't doing good research. I
wasn't working with people who
taught me to ask the right questions.
I learned to do research."
