# Med student fund raising holds steady

A fund-raising campaign l or med
ical student research is generally on
target, having brought in $5 million in
the last year.
The Medical Student Scholar's
Program, expected to raise $20 mil
lion in five years, allows medical stu
dents to conduct research under fac
ulty supervision while relieving debt.
The program, which gives stu
dents academic credit, allows them to
develop their own project — they're
not just "tagging on" to a professor's
research, said Patricia Cross, associ
ate dean of student affairs and associ
ate structural biology professor.
"It's one of the best academic
ways for them to approach research,"
Cross said. "Here in this program,
they're involved in the creative input
and actually develop a project which
is their own."

Less money than originally antici
pated has been raised because plan
ning consumed the campaign's first
year, said Bruce Bingham, associate
director of medical development.
"It is a little behind where we want
to be. but we have every confidence
that we will reach the goal," he said.
"I think we're just fine."
The campaign's plan to raise the
remaining $15 million will be includ
ed in the School of Medicine's overall
fundraising strategy.
Last fall, the federal government,
questioning how medical schools
were using their funds, slashed pro
gram money, which forced Stanford
to expand its donor base. With prior
warning, the campaign was started a
year before government money ran
out to keep the 18-year-old program
alive.
