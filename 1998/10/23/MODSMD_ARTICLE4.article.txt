# Tree costume stolen
## Stanford, Cal work to recover pine 
### David Felman Staff writer 
Early Saturday morning, uniden
tified perpetrators broke into the
Band Shak and stole the Tree. For
the past week, Stanford and UC-
Berkeley students and officials have
been working together to return
Stanford's mascot to its rightful
owners.
Jon Stemmle, assistant band
manager, expressed concern about
any retaliatory acts, as they might
jeopardize the Tree's return.
"We are deeply concerned that a
group of students might go over and
pull a prank that would jeopardize
the return of the Tree," said Stemm
le. He also indicated that members
of the Band are cooperating and
have not gone to Cal to try to recov
er the costume.
Chris Henderson, the Stanford

Tree, said he believes he was fol
lowed by three or four people out of
Maples Pavilion to the Shak after
the C ardinal ('haos basketball event
late Friday night. They then loitered
by a dumpster near the building, ac
cording to I lenderson. who left the
Shak at around 4:(K) a.m..
When Henderson awoke later
that morning, a neighbor notified
him that someone had written
"Bears" in shaving cream on a bath
room wall in his residence, Theta
Delta Chi.
Remembering the individuals
who allegedly followed him the
night before, Henderson immedi
ately went to the Shak, where he dis
covered the Tree missing. At that
time, Henderson called the Band's
manager, then Stanford Police.
Henderson estimates that the
costume is worth about $I.(KX). but
added, "What is the functional value


of the Tree? It is worth millions."
Although Henderson indicated
that there is no definitive proof that
the people who stole the Tree are
affiliated with Berkeley, officials at
both Stanford and Berkeley are
taking the incident seriously, espe
cially as Big Game approaches.
"1 have been in contact with col
leagues at Berkeley and have
voiced my concern that it is highly
likely that the tree was probably
taken by someone linked to Cal,"
said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Cal officials share this view, and
"are taking this incident just as seri
ously as we are here at Stanford,"
according to Wais.
"The Chancellor was very con
cerned when he learned that the
costume was stolen," said Jesus
Mena, UC-Berkeley campus
spokesman and director of media
relations.
Cal's chancellor met with the
student senate Wednesday night
and indicated to them that if the
tree is not returned to Stanford, he
would consider restricting Oski, the
Cal mascot, from performing at Big
Game.
Word has spread throughout the
UC-Berkeley campus that the Tree
has been stolen, Wais said. Cal offi
cials and student leaders are search
ing vigorously to turn up the tree, he
said.
Of primary concern to officials

at both schools is the health and
safety of fans who attend Big
Game.
"We want to make sure that Big
Game does not get out of hand,"
said Mena.
"Within the context of our con
cern for health and safety," Wais
said. "I am hopeful that no mem
bers of the Stanford community
will overreact to the incident which
was perpetrated by one or two indi
viduals who were affiliated with
Cal."
"The bottom line: we hope no
one will retaliate," said Wais.
"Retaliation is a strong word,"
said Henderson. "But it all boils
down to that they stole something
from me and broke into my home."
Henderson cautioned students
from retaliating, though. "I don't
want students to retaliate because I
don't want anyone hurt," Hender
son said. "But as the great lyricist
William Paley said, 'Who can refute
a sneer?'"
Wais has stated to Cal that he
just wants the Tree back, no ques
tions asked.
Stanford and Cal police are
treating the incident as a criminal
matter. "It would be a felony," ac
cording to Stanford Police Lieu
tenant Del Bandy.
Henderson designed the cos
tume himself and sewed it together
with the assistance of his mother
and friends.
