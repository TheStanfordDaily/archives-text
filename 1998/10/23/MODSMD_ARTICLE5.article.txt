### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Imagine what it would be like if Arthur Lee,
Milena Flores or Jennifer Azzi walked into your
classroom and became your teacher for an hour.
A number of students in local schools got to
contemplate that very question this past week.
At nearby elementary, middle and high
schools in East Palo Alto. Oakland and San Jose,
kindergarteners through 12th-graders had the op
portunity to welcome 12 well-known Bay Area
residents as part of l each for America Week, a
promotional activity for Teach for America.
This second annual nationwide event called
"upon successful Americans to share their knowl

edge and expertise in the classrooms of under
served schools," according to Aviva Friedman,
executive director of development for the local di
vision of Teach for America, based in San Fran
cisco.
"It's very inspirational when these role models
come to give their time for the good of local
schools," Friedman said. "Both the students and
the community leaders benefit by learning new
things about each other."
Founded in 1989, Teach for America is a non
profit national teacher corps that is made up of re
cent college graduates who serve for two years as
teachers in rural and urban schools throughout
the country. There are over 1,200 corps members
nationally.

Among the participants from the University
this year, in addition to Lee and Flores. were for
mer Olympic gymnast and sophomore transfer
student kerri Strug and Ramon Cortines, execu
tive director for the Annenberg Center for School
Reform. Professional basketball player and Stan
ford alumna Azzi and several local corporate
leaders also taught at different schools.
National participants included writer Tom
Clancy. U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, ac
tors John Lithgow and Sarah Jessica Parker and
over !?() others.
Friedman called this week "very successful."
citine that the event not onlv raised awareness
about the "need for teachers in
under-resourced districts," but also
helped "to connect thousands of the
nation's most under-served students
with positive role models."
Flores went to visit a third-grade
class at Willow Oaks Elementary in
Menlo Park. While she was there,
Flores talked about her experiences
in basketball, the need for higher ed
ucation and the benefits of team
work. She even led the students in a
short basketball practice on the
courts outside.
"It is hard to pass up something
like this when you see the good that
it does for the kids in our communi
ty," Flores said. "I would definitely

do it again."
Lee went to Edison McNair Mid
dle School in East Palo Alto and dis
cussed the merits of a college educa
tion, the importance of balancing
athletics and academics and showed
a highlight video of last year's bas
ketball season.
Liam Skilling, the teacher whose
classroom Lee visited, said that the
visit was "a great opportunity for the
kids to meet an exemplary role
model — someone who has exceed
ed academically and athletically."
Skilling joined the Teach for
America Corps a year ago because it
targeted the types of students he was
interested in teaching.
"I can see how this program will
make a huge difference for Ameri
can education in 10 years," he said.
"It is an integral part of our educa

tional system and our society."
The Bay Area division of Teach
for America was started in 1991. It
now works with about 30 schools in
three different school districts.
There are currently 101 active Bay
Area teachers in the program.
Friedman said that this type of
event takes a considerable amount
of preparation and coordination at
both the local and national levels to
work each year.
"We typically begin planning this
in January for the following Octo
ber," she said. "It is a very important
activity for our organization."
Friedman did, however, add that
this event will occur again next year.
"As long as the need exists for
more teachers in this country, Teach
for America Week will definitely be
back," she said.
