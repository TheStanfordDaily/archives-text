"upon successful Americans to share their knowl

edge and expertise in the classrooms of under
served schools," according to Aviva Friedman,
executive director of development for the local di
vision of Teach for America, based in San Fran
cisco.

come to give their time for the good of local
schools," Friedman said. "Both the students and
the community leaders benefit by learning new
things about each other."

profit national teacher corps that is made up of re
cent college graduates who serve for two years as
