# Farooq urges U.S. envoy to Kashmir
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called for
the appointment of a United States
special envoy to monitor the situa
tion in Kashmir, a disputed region
between Pakistan and India.
"We formally believe that if a res
olution to the Kashmir crisis is to be
found." said Farooq. who founded
the Kashmiri All Parties Hurriyat
Conference, "it must be in accor
dance with the wishes of the people
of Kashmir."
The near-capacity audience of
Terman Auditorium erupted into
applause during his speech last night.
The All Parties Hurriyat Confer
ence is "composed of approximately
25 Kashmiri political, social, human
rights and religious groups," said Fa
rooq. whose speech was sponsored
by Pakistanis at Stanford and the
Muslim Students Awareness Net
work.
Farooq's speech, titled "Kashmir:
At the Core of Conflict in a Nuclear
South Asia," did not concentrate
heavily on the impact of nuclear pro
liferation in South Asia. Instead, it
advocated the position of Farooq's
group towards Kashmiri indepen
dence.
In Farooq's words, the confer
ence is "adjudicating a peaceful res
olution to crisis."
The crisis Farooq referred to is
the fate of Kashmir.
The dispute over Kashmir stems
from the 1947 creation of India and
Pakistan. When the two nations
were created as a result of British
withdrawal, the leader of Kashmir
ceded the region to India.
Farooq argued that the leader of
Kashmir acted without the consent

of his people and that India pledged
to allow Kashmir to decide its own
fate. He said this has not occurred,
and as a result, "the story of the peo
ple of Kashmir has been a story of
pain and suffering for 50 years."
The United Nations agreed that
the Kashmiri people needed to re
solve their own fate, according to Fa
rooq. He characterized Kashmir as
"the oldest unresolved issue for the
United Nations."
The Kashmiri conflict is compli
cated by religious tensions that run
deep in the region. Pakistan is a pre
dominantly Muslim nation while
India is predominantly Hindu. Fa
rooq contended that Kashmir is pre
dominantly Muslim.
"Kashmir is not a border issue,"
he proclaimed, as he pounded the
lectern. "Are we a commodity? We
are a nation. We are 13 million peo
ple."
Farooq also rejected the charac
terization of the Kashmiri conflict as
a Muslim against I lindu struggle.
"Kashmir is an issue of identity. It
is the problem of identity of a nation.
The people have lost an identity."
Throughout his speech. Farooq
emphasized the presence of India's
military within the disputed region.
In a CBS News report shown before
the speech. Correspondent John
Roberts said that India has half of its
army within Kashmir.
Farooq said, "Kashmir is the
highest militarized zone in a ratio of
population to armed forces .... If
you go into the [Kashmir] valley you
will see a military siege."
Other portions of the video
showed mutilated and dead bodies
that the video attributed to India's
security forces within the Kashmir
region.

In his talk, Farooq returned to the
theme of the alleged violence of
India's security forces.
"Dozens of people are killed
every day. Kashmir has seen the
worst kind of human rights viola

tions."
Yet Farooq said the All Parties
Conference believes that "Kashmir
is a political dispute, and it must a

have a political solution not a mili
tary one. Unfortunately," he added,
"India has a military point of view."
"India must keep in mind that
the movement for Kashmiri self-de
termination has the support of the
masses," Farooq said. "The struggle
involves masses — it is alive in the
heart and mind of the masses."
Farooq's audience was not limit
ed to the Stanford undergraduate
community.
In addition to several families at
tending the event, Aruba Shabbir, a
senior, and Miriam Hossein, a ju
nior, both from Santa Clara Univer
sity, heard Farooq speak.
"My parents live in Palestine,
and I wanted to learn more about
the Kashmiri point of view," Shab
bir said. "Living in Palestine you
hear nothing about Kashmir."
Hossein, who lived in Kashmir,
said that she feels a special attach
ment for the region. She came to
hear Farooq speak to both, "find
out about Kashmir and to support
the Muslim community."
