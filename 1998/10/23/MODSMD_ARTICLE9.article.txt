Do you know"The Way
Home"? Women from different cul
tures will try to show the way there
through a discussion of this film on
race and gender today at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
"Women are still trying to find
their home, their origins in society,"
explained Shel Tejamo, the program
coordinator for the Women's Cen
ter.
In the film produced and directed
by Shaki Butler, "women from dif
ferent ethnic tribes bring their expe
riences in intercultural racism to
take the audience to a different level
of intellectual discussion," said Te
jamo.
The discussion following the
movie will be the most important
part of the program, said Tejamo.
Shaki Butler will be facilitating it,
using the video as a tool to allow the
audience to verbalize their experi
ence with the movie, according to
Tejamo.

The independent movie will be
the first of its kind to be shown
through the Women's Center, and
attendance from women's organiza
tions, local activists, and students all
over the Bay Area is expected.
All the women in the film are in
vited. "It is really possible for people
that come to sit right next to a movie
star," said Fabienne McPhail, direc
tor of the center.
McPhail was an advisor for the
movie for the past four years.
" This movie is a revolutionary art
form, a collage of women's voices, "
McPhail said. "We will get the op
portunity to listen and learn from
conversations we normally don't
have access to."
Stanford students who don't
agree with the views expressed in the
movie would be those to benefit the
most from watching it, McPhail said.
"We think Stanford students will be
wonderfully surprised with what
they will find," she explained.
"We encourage men to come as
well to hear women's voices. Ihey
would be a valuable contribution to

the ensuing discussions," she added.
The film cost $300,(XX) and was
funded by the World Trust Fund, a
non-profit organization co-founded
by Butler. The money for the movie
came mainly from private organiza
tions and personal donations, ac
cording toTejamo.
However, Butler is using the dis
cussion sessions and showings of the
movie to pay back the money to the
fund. "It's her life's work, and Shak
ti really embodies the spirits of all
the women involved with the
movie," McPhail said.
The center's main goal this year is
to encourage young women on cam
pus to go a little bit deeper in their
relationships with one another, ac
cording to McPhail.
Senior Sonia Das, community
outreach intern for the center, wants
the movie to be a "stimulus to get
people involved within our commu
nity, which is the point of the recep
tion and the discussion The film
is very powerful and can get all of
Stanford interested in the issues it
covers," she said.
