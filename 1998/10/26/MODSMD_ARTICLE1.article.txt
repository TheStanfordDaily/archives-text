### Beth Robinowitz 
Celebrating the 50th anniversary
of School of Humanities and Sci
ences, current Dean Malcolm
Beasley and past deans reminisced
about the school's development and
looked to the future.
Humanities and Sciences, the
largest of Stanford's seven schools,
formed in i l '4S with the merger of
the Schools of Biological Sciences,
Humanities, Physical Sciences and
Social Sciences. It is responsible for
more than SO percent of undergradu
ate teaching and awards the largest
number of Stanford doctoral de
grees.
The convocation on Friday
marked the beginning of a series of
occasions planned for this year com
memorating the anniversary. As
Beasley put it. " The way to turn 50 is
to throw a party; so we're going to
throw a party all year long."
The audience included rows of
decked-out faculty members; stu
dents were conspicuously absent.
The event's speeches reconstruct
ed the past 2N years of the school
through the perspective of each
dean. The historical description and

analysis explained how the school
evolved through each dean's admin
istration — including improvements
made in program implementation, fi
nancial management, faculty expan
sion and departmental development.
According to Ewart A.C.
Thomas, dean from 1488 to 1993,

"bringing the faculty to Stanford and
building the programs that have
made H&S the jewel that it is today
required extraordinary expendi
tures." Quoting the "Dean of Reg
gae Music," Bob Marley, Thomas

described building the school under
the pressure of financial constraints
as applying "vision to reality" — as
Marley's song, "Survival," instructs.
From the banks of a New Zealand
river, Norman Wessells, dean from
1981 to 1988, sent remarks, read
aloud by Bradley Efron. associate
dean from 1987 to 1990. Wessells

highlighted the school's commitment
to its faculty, even after they have left.
Wessells recalled that his adminis
tration tried to ensure that all of the
school's retired faculty and their wid
ows or widowers were financially
sound. " The very oldest had retired
with top salaries of perhaps $7,(KX); if
their total pensions and income were
below a certain figure, H&S, with the
Provost's kind help, repaired the situ
ation," Wessells explained.
Not onlv was the event a celebra

tion of the anniversary, but it also cel
ebrated the philanthropy of Vernon
and Lysbeth Anderson. The Ander
sons pledged $4 million to endow the
school's deanship, enabling all of
Stanford's seven schools to have
named and endowed deanships.
After praising the legacy left to
him by his predecessors and thanking
the Andersons, Beasley ended the
convocation by expressing his goals
for Humanities and Sciences and for
Stanford as a whole.

"We must not only strive to bring
the best possible faculty to Stanford.
We must strive also to make Stanford
the place where the newest ideas are
being generated and the most imagi
native teaching innovation is taking
place," Beasley said.
"Stanford is still exploring what a
great university can be," he contin
ued. "It is not yet a fully formed insti
tution. It is possible not only to move
to a new level, but also in a real sense
to define what universities can be."
