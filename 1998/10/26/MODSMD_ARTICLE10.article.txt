WASHINGTON (AP) — Gird
ing for a confrontation with Jewish
settlers back home, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says
he will not drop his opposition to a
Palestinian state. The West Bank,
he says, is part of my homeland."
Before flying home late Satur
day. Netanyahu told The Associat
ed Press he was obligated to yield
more territory to the Palestinian
Authority under the Oslo accords
reached by previous Israeli govern
ments.
"We did not choose this agree
ment." Netanyahu said.
Under the West Bank accord
signed last week. Israel is due to
relinquish 13 percent of the land
that many Jews who supported
Netanyahu, including most settlers,
consider part of Israel.
It was captured in the 1%7 war
from Jordan, which had controlled
the West Bank since 1948.
"Any inch of land that we cede
lo the Palestinians is painful for me
to cede," Netanyahu said in an
interview. "It is part of my home
land."
Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat ■" F.urope on Saturday
seeking tmancial support, said an
independent Palestinian state "is
coinii'g \ci \ soon.
But Netanyahu told a reporter
that while statehood would be on
the agenda in negotiations with the
Palestinians over a final settlement.
"We will still oppose a Palestinian
state."
Basing his position on Israel's
security, he said a Palestinian state
would expose Israel to a greater
threat from Iran and Iraq. He
repeated the assertion Sunday on
CNN's "Late Edition": "Tiny Israel
would have to protect itself against
[Iraq's] Saddam Hussein, against
Iran, against all these assorted pow
ers to our east which would have
more weaponry than NATO did at
the height of the C old War."
Beyond denying full statehood,
Netanyahu said, Israel has no inten
tion of interfering in the lives of
Palestinians.
Under interim agreements, the
Palestinian Authority will take con
trol of about 95 percent of the areas

densely inhabited by 1.6 million
Arabs. Remaining on the West
Bank, meanwhile, are 15().(KK) Jew
ish settlers.
At the Wye River summit,
besides yielding 13 percent of the
land. Israel agreed to give the Pales
tinian Authority security control
over more than half the 27 percent
ceded in past accords.
Currently, security control of the
14 percent is shared with Israel.
Jewish settlers, due to be sur
rounded in many parts of the West
Bank by Palestinian villages and
towns, are mounting angry protests,
accusing Netanyahu of caving in.
Netanyahu said he did the best
he could at the summit, considering
Israel had taken on obligations
under the Oslo accords to give up
more territory.
He said in the interview he will
keep a close eye on Arafat to
ensure he follows through on his
commitments to counter terrorism.
Netanyahu said he would be
guided by the same principle for
mer President Ronald Reagan
applied to treaties with the Soviet
Union to reduce U.S. and Soviet
nuclear arsenals: "Trust but verify."
"II they do their part, we will do
our part." he said. But he insisted if
Aralat does not adhere to his com
mitments. neither will Israel.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Sunday on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation" that Israeli Jews
living side bv side with Palestinian
Arabs would be better protected
under the new accord's security
provisions.
Much of the verification of
Arafat's promises to take action
against terrorists is to be undertak
en by the Central Intelligence
Agency. Netanyahu told Fox News
Saturday night that cooperation
between Israeli and Palestinian
intelligence agencies would form
"the critical link" in lighting terror
ism.
He also said the Palestinians
could raise their claim to part of
Jerusalem as their capital but
added: "1 will tell them that is going
to remain just as it is .... We will
never, ever, ever, ever let it be
divided again."
