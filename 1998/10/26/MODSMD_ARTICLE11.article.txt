WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A
Senate committee will hold hear
ings on the ClA's security-moni
toring role in an interim Middle
East peace accord.
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
who heads the Select Committee
on Intelligence, said Sunday he is
troubled by an agreement to have
the CIA monitor Palestinian anti
terrorist efforts. Such activities dif
fer from the agency's traditional
job "because it's a visible role."
"What is the role of the (TA? Is

it to enforce a policy? Is it to be an
arbitrator? Is it to be bodyguards?
I think not." Shelby said on "Fox
News Sunday." "I think we have to
look at this, and I believe we will
hold hearings on it in the Senate
Intelligence Committee."
Under the U.S.-brokered
agreement concluded Friday
between Israel and the Palestini
ans. the CIA would keep track of
Palestinian efforts to arrest and
punish terrorists as a way of
assuaging Israeli security concerns.
