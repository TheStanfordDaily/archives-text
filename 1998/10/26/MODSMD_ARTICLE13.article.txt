# U.N. to monitor Kosovo
##

UNITED NATIONS (AP)
The Security Council demanded
Saturday that Yugoslavia abide by
an accord to end lighting in Kosovo
province and said action may be
needed to ensure the safety of
international monitors there.
After nearly eight hours of rare
Saturday consultations, the council
adopted a resolution 13-0 to endorse
the agreement to allow unarmed
monitors to patrol Kosovo and
NATO to verify from the air that
fighting has stopped.
C 'hina and Russia abstained from
the vote and maintain the resolution
by no means authorizes force to
implement the agreement — some
thing both strongly oppose. The
United States, however, said NATO
retained that right and Britain
pledged to use whatever force was
needed to protect the unarmed mon
itors.
" The threat of force remains in
place," Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in a statement after the
vote.
Ihe resolution, diplomats said,
was believed to have been the first
by the Security Council to endorse a
NATO operation.

Fighting between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanians — who make up C X)
percent of Kosovo's population
has killed hundreds of people and
forced about 3(H),(KK) from their
homes since a Serb crackdown
began in February.
Under an Oct. 12 deal that avert
ed NATO airstrikes on Serb targets.
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo
sevic agreed to a cease-fire, to with
draw his special police forces from
the province and to allow a 2.( X K)-
strong team from the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to verify the agreement.
NATO would verify compliance
from the air.
As permanent council members.
Russia and China could have vetoed
the Security Council resolution.
Much of the negotiating Saturda\
was intended to prevent a possible
veto by easing language about the
threat of force, diplomats said.
China said it abstained from the
vote because the resolution went
beyond what was agreed to Oct. 12.
Russia said details of it — particular
ly an expression of deep concern
about the recent closure of indepen
dent media in Yugoslavia — had no

place in the resolution endorsing the
accord.
Russian Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov said before the vote that the
resolution "excludes all enforcement
elements." and guarantees against
"arbitrary or unsanctioned actions."
Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter
Burleigh said he regretted that Rus
sia had cited the free media part of
the resolution as a reason to abstain.
"I thought we would all agree on
the council that a free media is essen
tial to the solution to the political
problems in Kosovo and the evolu
tion towards democracy." Burleigh
said.
The Security Council was under
pressure to adopt a resolution
endorsing the accord and protecting
the verification team. Nations that
may contribute to the team have
been concerned about safety issues.
Saturday's rev ised draft deleted a
reference to international organiza
tions taking "appropriate steps" to
ensure compliance with the agree
ment and instead demanded
Yugoslavia implement the accord
fully and promptly Ihe resolution
affirmed that action may be needed
to protect monitors.
