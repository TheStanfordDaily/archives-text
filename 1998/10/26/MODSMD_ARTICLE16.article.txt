Three-tiered system seeks
to reduce disparities
between Draw groups

WLi ALL LOVE to gripe about the
Draw and to exchange stories
about the trials it brings.
First comes the social calamity of form
ing groups. I'hen begin the bitter disagree
ments ;ibout housing choices, followed bv a
frantic rush to acquire priorities. And. once
the fateful day arrives, everybody hears
about the unfortunate Draw group whose
post World War II preferred number
caused an awkward split between
Hooverville and Zimbabwe.
Yes, stories about the Draw are fun to
tell. As I found out, coming up with an
effective way to improve it is somewhat
harder.
For the List year. I have been represent
ing students on the Residential Programs
Implementation (iroup, a committee
charged with bringing to life the recom
mendations ol the I ask Force for Under
graduate Housing and Residential Pro
grams. I'hc dreaded Draw is. predictably,
one ol the areas we seek to reform. In other
words, we are working on a plan to increase
student satisfaction by tweaking the assign
ment system, not the quality of housing
itself.
I he task force felt that the Draw leaves
a substantial number ol students without a
single chance to live in a place they really
want. Falling through the cracks are the
unlucky souls who could not draw below
1.000 or so in either of their preferred years.
In response, the task force recommended
replacing two preferred years and one
unpreferred year with one preferred year
and two unpreferred years. Each student
would then be guaranteed to draw a num
ber in the top third once.
After many discussions with my peers
and after studying answers to RPICJ's sur
vey ol students. I encountered a persuasive
objection to this plan. I'he change offers an
advantage to those who wish to live in high
ly desirable housing, but a disadvantage for
those who strongly wish to avoid highly
undesirable housing. In short, the new hor
ror stories will be about Draw groups that
drew above, say. 2.N00 for two years.
Instead, a significant number of students
m the survey suggested a three-tiered alter
native. I here would be three levels of pri
ority: one year in the top third of the draw
(between numbers one and I.(XX)), one vear

in the middle (1 ,(K)1 to 2.000), and one year
at the bottom (2,(K) Ito 3,(KM)). Under the
leadership of Vice Provost lor Student
Affairs James Montoya and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education Ramon
Saldfvar, RPKJ is now actively seeking
more student input about the merits of a
three-tiered plan.
1 believe that this proposal would meet
the intent of the task force's recommenda
tions— giving each student a shot at the
top third in housing choices. Furthermore,
the three-tiered system is superior to the
task force's proposal to the extent that it
reduces the disparity between the luckiest
and the unluckiest Draw groups.
One can capture this disparity by com
paring the sum of Draw numbers groups
accumulate over three years. Under the
present system or under the task force's rec
ommendation, the luckiest possible group
gets a cumulative number about 5.000
lower than the unluckiest. The three-tiered
proposal reduces this gap to about 3,000.
When chance matters less, more students
would get a shot at housing they desire.
()ne difficulty with assessing any propos
al is the incredibly complex and diverse
nature of Stanford's housing system. While
some students prefer a desirable house, oth
ers prioritize availability of single rooms,
and still others simply want to keep their
groups together. 1 he assignment system is
further complicated by special priorities,
which often trump the Draw's mathematics.
RPK is survey revealed that undergrad
uates are not supportive of major changes
to the priority system or of a movement
away from decentralized in-house draws.
However, enough students appeared
intrigued by the three-tiered approach that
the proposal merits serious campus discus
sion.
While 1 am persuaded that the three
tiered Draw would make housing assign
ments more equitable, I am not sure if the
marginal improvement is worth the costs of
a transition between two systems. On this
question, RPKi. a group whose principal
aim is student satisfaction, now needs input
from undergraduates.
In addition to several focus groups, we
plan to host a public forum about the three
tiered alternative. Student opinions will, as
usual, be critical to any decisions the com
mittee will implement.
I doubt that the ritual of lamenting
about the Draw will ever go away. RPKI
simply hopes to give students less to com
plain about.
