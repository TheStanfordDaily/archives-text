## Honk if you're an honors student 
### 
My mom put
one of those
Stanford stickers
| on the back of our car win
j dow. I showed up last sum
| mer and there it was —
red background, white
Palatino type: Stanford. I

whined.
"Mom. what's that sticker doing on the
back of the car? I'm going to take it off."
To this she replied, "You leave that there.
It's my car and I put the sticker on it. I'm
proud that my kids go to Stanford."
I whined some more but all she said was.
"I thought I was showing restraint. It was a
full-sized bumper sticker that said something
about Proud Stanford Parent, and I just cut
out the word 'Stanford'."
This strikes me as odd because never
before has a Ilutton vehicle, even the Audi
station wagon my dad just sold for I XK) bucks
or the Bronco that's now being used as a
doghouse, sported a bumper sticker of any
kind. No, my parents never stuck one of
those, "My kid is a North Oaks Junior High
honor student" stickers on the minivan
maybe it was only because we didn't have a
minivan. Never before have my parents been
compelled to use automobiles as soapboxes
to support lesbians, defense department
bake sales, evolution, pop radio or the (ireen
Bay Packers. So why tell everybody on the
road where your kids go to school?
Perhaps if I were a hot shot, driving a
bitchy little coupe, darting in and out of traf

fic like Indiana Jones narrowly escaping clos
ing garage doors, I could outrun the CEOs'
and Nohel Laureates' hot breath fogging up
the glass of my rear window. Alas, in my
Ford Taurus station wagon, I drive within
the speed limit, sometimes well below it
when I'm looking for a place to park. 1 don't
even see the middle fingers intended for me.
because the rear-view mirror has been miss
ing for over a year.
Why is the word "Stanford" is something
1 instinctively want to hide rather than dis
play? 1 am intentionally vague, simply telling
acquaintances that I go to school in Califor
nia. I think I'm just tired of the assumptions
and divisions coming from the label of "Stan
ford student." Instead of anticipating
respect, I anticipate the pressure of living up
to being a "smart person." Can I figure out
how to turn the computer on? Can I read this
map and direct us to our destination? Did I
load that dishwasher as efficiently as expect
ed of a Stanford student?
Dining with my Sophomore ( ollege class,
we discussed the idea of being proud of
attending Stanford. I listened without com
ment to stories from people who had worked
hard, struggling through tough neighbor
hoods. poor families and le. mini ,lisabili:ii
to get themselves to Stanford. I put it in my
journal for something to figure <>ut later: Am
I proud that I go to Stanford.
I understand emotions like happy and
frustrated and anxious, but I'm not sure that
I really understand how pride feels.
I am proud of other people: tough-love

parents, kids learning to ride bikes, Rosa
Parks. And I'm proud of myself in small
ways: for growing a garden, sticking up for a
friend, getting an A in C'S 106 A. But as for
big pride, the "blood-and-sweat-and-tears
hard work and achievement" pride, I don't
know that I've ever really felt this. I haven't
grown up as an Olympic athlete, a soldier or
a revolutionary. I've grown up associating
the word "pride" with being too proud, the
"you're-not-the-boss-of-me" pride that
keeps widows from visiting food shelves and
brothers from apologizing.
So in reference to Stanford pride, I don't
think 1 can really feel proud until I see more
of a connection between my effort and
where I've ended up. Did I really earn this? 1
didn't save whales, raise a family on a
shoestring budget and maintain a 4.0. I just
took the SATs and went home hungry with a
sore neck.
But I'm still young, and I've got time
enough to earn myself some more pride. For
right now. it's enough that I've convinced
myself that who I am is enough to be a stu
dent at Stanford. Yet, I'm not sure it's
enough for the people criticizing my Ford
Taurus' not-so-parallel parking job.
ii) 1 stumble upon this phice rather than
follow detailed directions? Maybe so, but
that means I yot to wander through the
foothills r.ither than sit in traffic on the 101.

Rachel II niton's mom can beat up some
honor student's mom. She is a senior major
ing in product design.
