Free speech is not an entitlement
In his Oct. 22 letter, Michael Woo
brought up several interesting points of
discussion regarding the value of the First
Amendment.
I agree that freedom of speech is not
inherently without cost. I do not, however,
believe that the First Amendment is a
mere entitlement for freedom of speech.
I lie purpose of the First Amendment con
sists of the protection it bestows upon
society. This, among many other reasons,
prevents the government from stifling the

views of society. It enables us to tar and
feather not only the President but also
Congress. Make no mistake; freedom of
speech is not "just something defined and
artificial." Freedom of speech, as support
ed by the First Amendment, allows society
a voice in the direction of the government
and the country.
I also take issue with Woo's statement
on the influence of an individual's values
on speech decisions, (individuals should
be capable of making appropriate judg
ment calls based on their value systems.
Unfortunately, not everyone has a similar

perception of "correct values." Witness
the extreme religious activists who picket
ed Matthew Shepard's funeral. In their
own minds, they believe their ideas and
actions to be correct. Few would argue,
however, that their use of free speech did
not overstep the boundaries of common
sense and human decency.
1 conclude with a quotation from an
unknown source: "Your freedom to swing
your fist ends where my nose begins."

Bloodshed was Pakistan strategy
Your Oct. 23 report on the tnlk by Mir
wauz IJmar Farooq neglects to mention
the chief cause of bloodshed in the Kash
mir valley â€” unprecedented terrorism
sponsored by Pakistan.
After waging a couple of unsuccessful
wars, the Pakistani government adopted
the strategy of sending in locally trained
armed terrorists into the Kashmir valley.
Weapons and mercenaries were plentiful
as a result of earlier Soviet / American
misadventures in Afghanistan.

These terrorists abducted and mur
dered Indians by the thousands and have
recently extended these practices to visit
ing European nationals. The armed forces
were sent in to restore order in the valley
and to prevent further infiltration by ter
rorists. Thus a military approach was cho
sen by India to quell terrorism in Kashmir,
much like the US approach in such mat
ters.
