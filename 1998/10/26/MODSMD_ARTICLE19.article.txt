# Where we are
## For whom the wedding bell tolls

OH. GO ON and shake your head
disapprovingly, go on and cluck, tsk
tsk and giggle. Go off to your week
end parties, grind your bones to numbness
and lap up the pleasures of being single while
the lapping is good. Say what you will, sup
port or condemn, but I — barely of legal age
and currently without meaningful employ
ment — 1 am engaged to be married.
Now, 1 can imagine what you're thinking.
He's too young. He's jumping into it. He has
yet to experience the varied richness of life.
All the things you might say of a man getting
married or else, contemplating suicide. The
two. let me reassure you, are quite different.
Fortunately, the resistance I have imag
ined here in this column has been just that —
imaginary. My friends have been enthusiasti
cally supportive; my parents, if more
reserved in their excitement, are nonetheless
wholly approving; and my future in-laws
honestly adore me. The one minor objection
1 do receive comes in the question of "Is it
really true?" which seems to reveal only my
friends'good-natured shock, but nevertheless
sometimes makes me feel as if they want me
to say it's all a big lie, designed to elicit warm

wishes and an unwarranted gift.
For my girlfriend, excuse me, fiancee (the
change in terms is not yet natural), the reac
tions haven't been as thoroughly positive.
Perhaps it's because she's a woman, and peo
ple might feel she's throwing her career plans
away to become a domestic. However, 1
must say that her fire and ambition are as
impassioned as anyone's, and that this hypo
thetical complaint can only be grounded in
ignorance. Or maybe she might be attracting
more suspicious looks than 1 just because
she's the one wearing the ring (and what a
ring it is, might 1 add!).
Nevertheless, our prenuptial announce
ment has been received with all the rosy hues
of celebration, and when I think of my deci
sion— our decision — 1 am as thrilled as I
am thrilled by the sum total of my life accom
plishments. Why then would 1 imagine such
resistance and uneasiness in the minds of
people around me?
Because, for the longest time, I myself
was opposed to getting engaged.
Now, I'm a private man, and speaking
about my romantic life in public is as appeal
ing as an eight o' clock class on Fridays. Even

when I talk of such pleasantries as how I pro
posed. at sunset, on a cliff overlooking the
ocean without going down on my knee, I feel
the twinge of propriety.
But in this case, it might be helpful to
reveal some of the decision-making process
that went into such a commitment, because
although few of us are setting wedding dates,
most people are planning out their lives.
And for the longest time, getting engaged
at age 21 was not part of my plan.
I had always wanted to get married, but in
the same way that I've always wanted to go
on an African safari: it would happen one
day, but not any time soon. It would defi
nitely not happen while I was in college or
before I was earning enough money to pay
for, say. my own honeymoon.
Moreover, my fiancee did not typify the
woman I had always envisioned myself mar
rying. She is a Mexican Catholic —I am
not — and while I have no problem whatso
ever with this cultural difference, she never
theless represented something entirely
unlike the girls who populated my childhood
and adolescence. She was foreign, in every
wav, to what I had been accustomed to.

I can claim no one reason for these preju
dices. Parents, society, idiosyncrasies. Who
knows? They were just part of the Plan.
My earliest recollection of the Plan is
from fifth grade when 1 was required to sub
mit an entry to the "What I Will Do When I
Grow Up" collection. While visions of base
ball players danced in others' heads, I
remember handing in a picture of myself,
holding a briefcase inscribed with the words
"Harvard Law." How a ten-year-old knew
that the Stanford of the East sported one of
the most venerable institutions of law in the
country, I still don't know. Even then, I had
constructed mentally a path for myself to fol
low, and from then on, for some reason or
another, 1 considered it both dangerous and
unwise to veer from this path.
While law school no longer figures into
my future, portions of the Plan remain, por
tions that irrationally prevented me from
popping the question even though 1 truly
cared for my fiancee and was certain she
would say, "Yes."
The Plan was a terrible foe: terrible in the
sense that it threatened my relationship, but
also that it had for so long been a source of

my success. It shaped my ambitions and
allowed me to achieve the things I had want
ed to achieve. It was both master and slave; it
controlled me, but I exploited it in return.
I finally overcame the Plan (at least the
portion which kept me from proposing) by
taking to heart a simple truth, a truth we
might acknowledge but probably rarely put
into action: life, as much as we try to push it
into our preformed bottles and force it to
obey our demands, often chooses us and our
own choices must be reworked or discarded
so as to accommodate our happiness.
I recognize the triteness of this statement,
but then I look up and see half the freshman
class declared pre-med even though few
have actually touched a cadaver. I see people
unwilling to befriend different races just
because they never had to. I see lovers end
ing their relationships because, hey, this is
college and they can't be tied down. We all
have Plans that cloud our vision.
It's just that sometimes we move them a
bit, and we can see clearly.
