# Prof. Kennedy looks back on his 'Springs'
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
Former Stanford president Don
ald Kennedy has worn many hats at
Stanford, most of them variations on
the mortarboard.
The lanky, jovial Kennedy — who
resigned from the presidency in the
summer of 1991 and is now the Bing
Professor of Evolutionary Biology —
has assembled his commencement
and other special-occasion speeches
into one slim volume, which also dis
cusses the challenges Stanford faced
during his presidency.
The book's title. "The Last of
Your Springs," highlights the Adlai
Stevenson quotation with which
Kennedy ended ;ill his commence
ment speeches, a quotation which
probably left 12 years of Stanford
graduates in tears.
"Your days are short here; this is
the last of your springs. And now in
the serenity and quiet of this lovely
place, touch the depths of truth, feel
the hem of I leaven. You w ill go away
with old. good friends. And don't for
get when you leave why you came."
Walter Falcon, director of the In
stitute for International Studies, said,
"I've heard him do that final use of
Adlai Stevenson's quote a dozen
times, and every time it absolutely
stilled the commencement crowd."
Kennedy "combined different ad
vice. thoughtful advice in ways that
were really inspiring on t he one hand,
and good rules for the sand box on
the other. And he did this while being
uplifting, not patronizing."
Kennedy said writing the book
without becoming repetitive was
challenging. "I had to wrap history
around excerpts from speeches and
make sense of disparate events," he
said.
The former president led Stan
ford through some of its hardest
times. I lis tenure in office saw the
Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 and
a funding scandal that troubled not
just Stanford but all major research
universities in America. His tenure
also encompassed Stanford's centen
nial celebration and a visit from for
mer Soviet Union president Mikhail
Gorbachev.
"He was an inspirational leader
on campus, just a terrific leader," said

'
Larry Horton, director of govern
ment and community relations. "He
accepted responsibility just on the
grounds that that's what leaders do."
The book is Kennedy's love son
net to the University. "I hope that if
one thing comes out of this book, is a
sense of my affection for the student
body," Kennedy said.
Kennedy has written several
other books, including several text
books, and "Academic Duty," a re
cent treatise on higher education and
challenges to the American universi
ty.
Prior to arriving at Stanford,
Kennedy earned a bachelor's degree,
master's degree and doctorate from
Harvard University. He then taught
at Syracuse University. Kennedy,
who has been a member of the Stan
ford faculty for 38 years, served as
Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979,
and was provost for one year until
becoming president in I9<S().
The 1980s
Most members of the Stanford
community know the early history of
the University in one form or anoth
er. But newcomers may not be ac
quainted with the events of the 1980s.
And those who were there in the
'80s will appreciate Kennedy's de
tailed remembrances.
"The book is a different kind of
history about that period — it comes
from his point of view," said Maggie
Kimball, president of the Stanford
