# Prof. Kennedy looks back on his 'Springs'
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
Former Stanford president Don
ald Kennedy has worn many hats at
Stanford, most of them variations on
the mortarboard.
The lanky, jovial Kennedy — who
resigned from the presidency in the
summer of 1991 and is now the Bing
Professor of Evolutionary Biology —
has assembled his commencement
and other special-occasion speeches
into one slim volume, which also dis
cusses the challenges Stanford faced
during his presidency.
The book's title. "The Last of
Your Springs," highlights the Adlai
Stevenson quotation with which
Kennedy ended ;ill his commence
ment speeches, a quotation which
probably left 12 years of Stanford
graduates in tears.
"Your days are short here; this is
the last of your springs. And now in
the serenity and quiet of this lovely
place, touch the depths of truth, feel
the hem of I leaven. You w ill go away
with old. good friends. And don't for
get when you leave why you came."
Walter Falcon, director of the In
stitute for International Studies, said,
"I've heard him do that final use of
Adlai Stevenson's quote a dozen
times, and every time it absolutely
stilled the commencement crowd."
Kennedy "combined different ad
vice. thoughtful advice in ways that
were really inspiring on t he one hand,
and good rules for the sand box on
the other. And he did this while being
uplifting, not patronizing."
Kennedy said writing the book
without becoming repetitive was
challenging. "I had to wrap history
around excerpts from speeches and
make sense of disparate events," he
said.
The former president led Stan
ford through some of its hardest
times. I lis tenure in office saw the
Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 and
a funding scandal that troubled not
just Stanford but all major research
universities in America. His tenure
also encompassed Stanford's centen
nial celebration and a visit from for
mer Soviet Union president Mikhail
Gorbachev.
"He was an inspirational leader
on campus, just a terrific leader," said

'
Larry Horton, director of govern
ment and community relations. "He
accepted responsibility just on the
grounds that that's what leaders do."
The book is Kennedy's love son
net to the University. "I hope that if
one thing comes out of this book, is a
sense of my affection for the student
body," Kennedy said.
Kennedy has written several
other books, including several text
books, and "Academic Duty," a re
cent treatise on higher education and
challenges to the American universi
ty.
Prior to arriving at Stanford,
Kennedy earned a bachelor's degree,
master's degree and doctorate from
Harvard University. He then taught
at Syracuse University. Kennedy,
who has been a member of the Stan
ford faculty for 38 years, served as
Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration from 1977 to 1979,
and was provost for one year until
becoming president in I9<S().
The 1980s
Most members of the Stanford
community know the early history of
the University in one form or anoth
er. But newcomers may not be ac
quainted with the events of the 1980s.
And those who were there in the
'80s will appreciate Kennedy's de
tailed remembrances.
"The book is a different kind of
history about that period — it comes
from his point of view," said Maggie
Kimball, president of the Stanford


DotniM Kcnruiiy
Historical Society. "It's important be
cause of his role in the events of that
time."
Deeper issues arose at Stanford in
the decade of "Reaganomics,"
crunchy hair and materialism. Stan
ford was at the forefront of debates in
race relations, multicultural curricu
lum and undergraduate education re
form.
"The '80s were not as tumultuous
as the '605," Kennedy said. "They
had less of an edge." Yet the events of
the decade left their mark upon Stan
ford.
In 1989,55 students were arrested
after storming Kennedy's office. The
students presented Kennedy with a
list of demands, including the hiring
of a tenure-track Asian-American
history professor, and an increased
budget for undergraduate programs
including the Chicano Fellows and
the human biology and international
relations programs.
Kennedy also oversaw the re
placement of the required Western
Culture sequence with Cultures,
Ideas and Values, which placed a
greater emphasis on minority and fe
male authors.
The indirect cost recovery scandal
In 1990, Stanford went under
Congress' microscope, charged with
misallocating taxpayer dollars. The
indirect cost controversy was a clash
between Stanford and the govern
ment, essentially because the univer
sity had charged expenses to indirect
pools — a common practice among
institutions of higher learning.
Indirect costs are those costs asso

ciated with research that can't be
charged to particular projects, and
are reimbursed to universities.
"Stanford got caught in eye of a
hurricane," said Robert Rosenzwieg,
former vice-president for public af
fairs. Rosenzweig served as president
of the Association of American Uni
versities — a grouping of the top 50
research universities in the country
— during the indirect cost debacle.
There were several different is
sues in the indirect-cost recovery
issue. Bed sheets and flowers in the
president's house are some of the
most famous examples of items paid
for by money from the indirect pool,
the most infamous being a yacht, the
Victoria, which was given to the Ath
letics Department. The yacht, of
which Kennedy was unaware until an
article on it appeared in the San Jose
Mercury News, "popped up in a pool
no one had thought to examine, one
including depreciation charges on a
group of physical assets," Kennedy
wrote.
Stanford eventually reimbursed
the government $1.2 million, far less
than the $2(X) million to 400 million
originally calculated. Although he
was not involved with the cause of the
scandal. Kennedy resigned.
"Don got caught up in the politics
of it. The university looked bad. Once
the fat is in the fire, it's too late.
There's a tendency in human events
to look for a scapegoat, and they tied
a can to him," Rosen/weig said.
"The next thing you knew, Stan
ford was all over TV and the newspa
pers and hauled before Congress. It
was a hanging jury, and no rational
case could have been made."
According to Morton, "he weath
ered it quite well. I think the evidence
is pretty clear now that the charges
and wild accusations were quite wild.

and what I thought was really very
admirable is that in a difficult situa
tion like that with the press behaving
badly Don never pointed the finger at
anybody else when he accepted re
sponsibility."
Falcon agreed. "A good president
bleeds for his university."
Kennedy on culture
Kennedy, a long-time champion
of diversity in higher education, be
lieves the battle is not over yet. He
cites Proposition 209, which bans
public affirmative action programs in
California.
Kennedy is excited about changes
in undergraduate education, citing
the establishment of such institutions
as Sophomore College and Stanford
Introductory Seminars, one of which
he teaches.
"Stanford's attention to under
graduate education has improved,"
Kennedy said. However, he thinks
there is room for improvement in
doctoral programs. "No one has real
ly figured out how to teach future
professors to teach," he said.
Kennedy discusses another Stan
ford-relevant issue in the book that
has not been addressed enough at
Stanford or elsewhere — overwork.
"Overwork is a social disease in
America," Kennedy said. "We've
substituted outrageously demanding
apprenticeships for thoughtful, in
centive-increasing apprenticeships
that provide a gradual sense of what
the fields are about."
He believes that current training
programs for medical students, for
example, are merely a slightly dis
guised form of hazing, and the same
applies to the grueling seven-year ap
prenticeships for new attorneys.
"The number of well educated

Americans and institutional leaders
who believe the 8(>-hour week is in
strumental to success is truly alarm
ing," he writes. "The elite professions
are now levying outlandish demands
for commitment upon their junior
members, guaranteeing that some of
the brightest and most imaginative
members of society will be unavail
able for any tasks outside their nar
row professional sphere.
"That is not a recipe for con
fronting and managing great social
change. Rather, it is one for main
taining visa>sity."
Graduating from the Presidency
Kennedy remains active in the Bi
ology department. This year he is
teaching one Introductory Studies
course and one upper-level seminar,
both titled "Assessment of Chronic,
Low-level Environmental Risks."
One past student remembers him
fondly from his days before the pres
idency.
"The introductory biology course
I took from him back when it was re
quired of all freshmen was incredi
ble," said Candace Brooks, Class of
*63.
"He was lecturing to a cast of
thousands — yet he knew quite a
number of us by name. You could
walk into his office and talk to him.
He is an incredible person, really easy
to talk to. He could just suck you in
because he could make anything in
teresting," Br(X)ks said.
Max Edelson, a sophomore,
served as Kennedy's research assis
tant over the summer and helped him
write another book, "Environmental
Quality and Regional Security."
"It's surprising what a nice guy he
is — he's so knowledgeable, and so
encouraging," Edelson said.
