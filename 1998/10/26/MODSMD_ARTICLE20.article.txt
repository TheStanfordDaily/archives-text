WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Kriday: No. 7 Stanford (17-2 over
all, 11-0* Pacific 10 Conference) de
feated ASU (7-10, 4-6), 7-15. 15-3
15-2. 15-4.
■ Yesterday: Stanford defeated No
17 Arizona (17-3,8-3). 15-10.15-5,7-
15. 15-10.

With the pair of four-game victo
ries at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal
(17-2 overall, 11-0 Pac-10) main
tained its two-game conference lead
over USC.
Still tired from road trips to Ore
gon and Pacific. Stanford came out
slowly on Friday night and dropped
the first game to Arizona State.
Then they woke up.
After giving up the first game 15-
7. Stanford allowed the Sun Devils
only nine points in the match's last
three games and cruised to victory
(7-15,15-3, 15-2. 15-4).
"It didn't surprise me that we
didn't start well." said Stanford head

coach Don Shaw, who won his 399 th
career match yesterday. "We were
coming off a long match at Pacific,
and we didn't have a very good prac
tice."
The Cardinal started the Arizona
State (7-10. 4-6) match with a new
lineup, moving freshman Sara San
drik to outside hitter and bringing
freshman Tara Conrad in as the sec
ond middle blocker. After game
one. Shaw moved Sandrik back and
returned junior outside hitter Sarah
Clark to the third hitter position.
From that point, the rest of the
match was a blur for ASU.
"We went back to our old lineup
to give us some stability." Shaw said.
"We weren't passing the ball very
well, so we moved Sandrik back to
middle blocker and immediately got
better in a lot of areas."
Stanford's blockers also strug
gled early with the powerful outside
hitting of Sun Devil sophomore
Amanda Burbridge, but Sandrik
and Detmer learned to focus on Ari
zona State's primary offensive
weapon and shut down the outside
attack.
"They kept going outside to Bur
bridge. so we focused our block on
her," said sophomore middle block
er Jennifer Detmer, who ended the
match with eight kills and four
blocks. "We wanted to keep them
from hitting over the tops of our
hands, so we extended our arms into

weekend and provided stability for the Cardinal in the back row.
;i more powerful blocking position
and shut them down."
Once the Cardinal figured out
Arizona State's outside attack, the
Sun Devils' only option was to loo!,
to then middle blockers for offen
sive production.
They didn't get it. Stanford con
trolled the net the rest of the way.
"They absolutely dominated us
in the middle." said Arizona State
head coach Patti Snyder-Park. "You
come in knowing you can't match up
with Walsh. We expected Walsh to
get her share, but we didn't expect
Sandrik and Detmer to own us up
the middle."
In the end. the Cardinal used a
balanced attack to burn the Sun
Devils l.ed by junior outside hitter
kerri Walsh's IS kills. Stanford uot

11 kills from Sandrik and nine each
from Clark and Michelle Chambers.
Stanford carried the momentum
of Friday's win into Maples Pavilion,
yesterday, for its matchup with seri
ous Pac-1() challenger, No. 17 Ari
zona (17-3, K-3), which came into the
match just two games back of the
Cardinal.
Stanford learned from Friday
night's slow start and came out fir
ing. The C ardinal used its solid early
hitting to win key sideouts and
points, edging the Wildcats 15-10 in
an up-and-down first game.
Shaw's conference leaders con
tinued to roll in the second, holding
Arizona to a .OK7 hitting percentage
and easily winning the second game
15-5.
Just like earlier in the week at Pa
cific, however, the Cardinal came
out from the 10-minute break a little
Hat and dropped the third game, 15-

"It is very hard to put a good team
away in three games," Shaw said. "It
is hard not to have a letdown coming
out of that 10-minute break, and we
lost the edge a little bit."
Stanford regained its sharpness
in the fourth and final game and sent
Arizona home with a tight 15-10
Cardinal victory.
Once again, the Cardinal boasted
a balanced attack, with four players
posting double-digit kill totals.
Walsh and Chambers both fin
ished with a match-high 17 kills,
while Clark tallied 16 in her return to
the starting rotation. Sandrik added
12 kills and eight blocks, and fellow
middle blocker Jennifer Detmer tal
lied eight kills and six blocks.
"On the whole, we hit very well,"
Walsh said. "They did a good job
blocking, but we were able to spread
it around enough and be successful."
Junior outside hitter Raelene
Elam led the Cats with 16 kills, while

sophomore Marisa DeLee added 14
kills and 11 blocks.
While the four-game victory was
encouraging for Stanford, it proved
devastating for Arizona, which
stands three hack of the Cardinal,
with seven conference matches left.
"Every match is equally impor
tant in the standings, but you know
that a win over a team like Stanford
could mean a lot to your program,"
said Arizona coach David Rubio,
who has taken his program to the
doorstep of national power. "We
want to be one of those teams that
has a shot at a national title. And you
have to beat a team like Stanford to
get into that category.
"It is quite a psychological hurdle
to beat Stanford," Rubio added. "At
least we came out and gave it our
best. Stanford was simply better
today, and I admire the job Don
Shaw is doing with all his young tal
ent.

half of the season.
