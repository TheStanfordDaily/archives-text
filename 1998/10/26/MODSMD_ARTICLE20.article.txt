7. Stanford allowed the Sun Devils
only nine points in the match's last
three games and cruised to victory

weapon and shut down the outside
attack.
"They kept going outside to Bur
bridge. so we focused our block on
her," said sophomore middle block

match with eight kills and four
blocks. "We wanted to keep them
from hitting over the tops of our
hands, so we extended our arms into
