MEN'S SOCCER

■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford (11-4
overall, 4-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated UC-Santa
Barbara (2-13,0-4), 2-0.
■ Yesterday: Cal Poly (8-4-2, 3-1)
defeated Stanford. 1 -0.

Although Friday's game was
recorded as a victory and yester
day's a loss, the team felt its perfor
mance was stronger in last night's
match against the Mustangs.
"I didn't think we played well
Friday night. [Yesterday] was a
tremendous team effort, hut wasn't
going to be our day," said Stanford
head coach Bobby Clark. "Some
times it just doesn't work for you.
but you have to praise the effort."
Although the effort was strong,
the Cardinal wasn't able to convert
on any of its 15 shots-on-goal.
In comparison, Cal Poly took
only four shots and Stanford goalie
redshirt sophomore Adam Zapala
was only forced to make one save
during the entire game.
The Mustangs' goal came off a
penalty kick five minutes into the
second half. Junior Brian Lange
drilled the shot into the bottom left
corner past Zapala for the game's
only goal.
The penalty came after junior
defender Gerard Davis found him
self in a foot race with Cal Poly's
freshman Kayin DeSandies. Davis
attempted a slide tackle and ended

up with DeSandies instead of the
ball. DeSandies went down and
since the play was inside the penal
ty box, the Mustangs were awarded
the penalty kick.
Following the goal. Stanford
picked its play up a level, but wasn't
able to put the ball in the net de
spite the Cardinal outshooting the
Mustangs. 10-2. in the second half.
"Once they scored, we lifted our
intensity," Davis said. "We wanted
to get something more out of it. but
1 think it will make us better in the
long run."
The Cardinal suffered a second
loss on the night when sophomore
midfielder Sean Sylvis was carried
off with a serious leg injury. The de
tails of the injury were unknown.
Friday night's game against UC-
Santa Barbara, on the other hand,
was not the Cardinal's most im
pressive of the season, but went
down in the books as a victory all
the same.
"We dominated the first half
and played very well, but came out
very flat in the second half. We
never quite got out of that mode,"
Bobby Clark said.
The domination in the first half
helped the Cardinal jump out to an
early lead and never look back.
Redshirt junior T.k. Inbody put
Stanford ahead for good in only the
seventh minute of the game. Junior
Andy Hemmerich created the play
off a long throw in that freshman
Lee Morrison directed upfield to
Inbody. From the top of the box, 18
yards out. Inbody sent the ball
through to the back of the net for
his third goal of the season.
"T.K.'s goal came off a very
good shot." Bobby Clark said.
The Cardinal was forced to bat
tle the Gauchos while missing two
of its senior starters, forward Adam
Siegman and defender Jamie

Clark. Siegman was sidelined all
weekend with a severe bruise and
Clark was forced to sit out after re
ceiving his fifth yellow card of the
season, coming last Sundav against
OSU.
Sophomore Matt Moses started
in Siegman's place and was part of
Stanford's rotation of forwards,
along with sophomore Corey Wool
folk and senior captain A.J. Sauer.
"Adam's position is a lot harder
than it looks," Moses said. "I give a
lot of credit to him. It is hard to do
what he does every day."
Redshirt sophomore Chris
Gores earned his first start ever for
Stanford in Jamie Clark's place.
"This was a good opportunity for
the two lads and they did very well,"
Bobbv Clark said.

It was Gores who began the play
which led to Stanford's second goal.
With five minutes left in the first
half. Gores hit a beautiful pass to
Svlvis who beat his man and fired a
shot that deflected off the Gaucho
goalie Trent Ulicny. Woolfolk eon
verted the rebound into the Cardi
nal's insurance, scoring his third
goal of the season.
The two goals were enough to
hold on for the vietory, but the
team's second half let-down led to
more post-game frustration.
" The boys were a little disap
pointed with the second half,"
Hobby Clark said. "We did enough
to keep in the game, but dropped a
level. [UCSB] also did a lot better in
the second half."
Goalie Adam Zapala recorded
his l()th shutout out of the season,
making six saves. Entering the
weekend, Zapala led the MPSF with
a 0.46 goals-against average.
