MEN'S SOCCER

■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford (11-4
overall, 4-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated UC-Santa
Barbara (2-13,0-4), 2-0.
■ Yesterday: Cal Poly (8-4-2, 3-1)
defeated Stanford. 1 -0.

Although Friday's game was
recorded as a victory and yester
day's a loss, the team felt its perfor
mance was stronger in last night's
match against the Mustangs.
"I didn't think we played well
Friday night. [Yesterday] was a
tremendous team effort, hut wasn't
going to be our day," said Stanford
head coach Bobby Clark. "Some
times it just doesn't work for you.
but you have to praise the effort."
Although the effort was strong,
the Cardinal wasn't able to convert
on any of its 15 shots-on-goal.
In comparison, Cal Poly took
only four shots and Stanford goalie
redshirt sophomore Adam Zapala
was only forced to make one save
during the entire game.
The Mustangs' goal came off a
penalty kick five minutes into the
second half. Junior Brian Lange
drilled the shot into the bottom left
corner past Zapala for the game's
only goal.
The penalty came after junior
defender Gerard Davis found him
self in a foot race with Cal Poly's
freshman Kayin DeSandies. Davis
attempted a slide tackle and ended

up with DeSandies instead of the
ball. DeSandies went down and
since the play was inside the penal
ty box, the Mustangs were awarded
the penalty kick.
Following the goal. Stanford
picked its play up a level, but wasn't
able to put the ball in the net de
spite the Cardinal outshooting the
Mustangs. 10-2. in the second half.
"Once they scored, we lifted our
intensity," Davis said. "We wanted
to get something more out of it. but
1 think it will make us better in the
long run."
The Cardinal suffered a second
loss on the night when sophomore
midfielder Sean Sylvis was carried
off with a serious leg injury. The de
tails of the injury were unknown.
Friday night's game against UC-
Santa Barbara, on the other hand,
was not the Cardinal's most im
pressive of the season, but went
down in the books as a victory all
the same.
"We dominated the first half
and played very well, but came out
very flat in the second half. We
never quite got out of that mode,"
Bobby Clark said.
The domination in the first half
helped the Cardinal jump out to an
early lead and never look back.
Redshirt junior T.k. Inbody put
Stanford ahead for good in only the
seventh minute of the game. Junior
Andy Hemmerich created the play
off a long throw in that freshman
Lee Morrison directed upfield to
Inbody. From the top of the box, 18
yards out. Inbody sent the ball
through to the back of the net for
his third goal of the season.
"T.K.'s goal came off a very
good shot." Bobby Clark said.
The Cardinal was forced to bat
tle the Gauchos while missing two
of its senior starters, forward Adam
Siegman and defender Jamie
