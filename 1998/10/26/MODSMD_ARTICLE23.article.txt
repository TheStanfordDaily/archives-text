### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
As Stanford's women's field hockey team assumed its
positions on the Varsity Hockey Astroturl Field, it
looked as though the warm homecoming the team had
hoped for was not to he. Reminiscent of the stormy skies
the team had left behind during its disappointing road
trip to Boston, the field had collected puddles from the
steady afternoon showers.
The Cardinal, however, was not deterred I using
three of its last four games, the team knew tli ' S. it in

day's game against Pacific would be an important step to
returning to the level of play it had established before
leaving ( alifornia for its Fast ( oast road trip.
Picking up exactly where it left off before the trip,
Stanford (10-5 overall, 6-0 Northern Pacific Athletic
( (inference) pummeled Pacific (4-6.2-2). 5-1.
As it taking out aggressions from Stanford's recent
scoring slump, junior forward I indsev Dunagan gave the
Cardinal a quick lead after just three minutes of play.
Dunagan's fourth goal of the season set the tone for the
*> mc strike quick, strike often.
Stanford head coach Shervl Johnson felt the comforts

of home.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Saturday: Stanford (10-5 overall, 6-0 Northern Pacific
Athletic ( onference) defeated Pacific (4-6.2-2). 5-1

"We have the best field in the nation, so playing at
home is always great." she said.
With 10:30 remaining in the first half, senior forward
Sarah Medeiros scored her first goal of the season, mark
ing the first time in four games that her team scored more

than one goal.
Increasing her team's lead to two. Medeiros's goal
began to offer painful reminders to the Tigers of their last
confrontation with the Cardinal, which ended in a 4-1 de
feat. two weeks before.
Even so. when the second half opened the game was
far from out of reach for Pacific. That, however, was not
to last for long.
A rapid succession of Stanford goals suddenly
bumped Pacific's deficit from two to five within a 10-
minute span.
Junior forward Mallory Cham
bers sparked the attack with her
fourth goal of the season and first in
over a month. With the goal, Cham
bers also increased her season point
total to 12.
It was only a matter of time until
the Cardinal's goals and assists
leader, Monique Leroux, became in
volved in the offensive strike.
Just over three minutes after
Chambers' goal, Leroux gave her
team a commanding 4-0 lead. Ler
oux's 11th goal and 29th point of the
season were aided by an assist from
senior Carey Cloyd. The duo has
now teamed up three times on the
season in similar Cloyd-to-Leroux
scoring assaults.
Feeling left out, senior sweeper
Lissy Goralnik then got into the ac
tion. Scoring her sixth goal of the
season, Goralnik increased Stan
ford's lead to 5-0 with just 13 minutes
elapsed in the second half.
Celebrating Halloween a week
early in its black and orange, Pacific
then went scrambling to cut the lead
and get back in the game. The Cardi
nal defense, however, was unrelent

ing.
Playing according to script, as
soon as a Tiger player would get con
trol of the ball, Stanford's defense
would descend upon her and emerge
with the ball. It was a momentous oc
casion for Pacific when it could pen
etrate far enough into Stanford's de
fense to get a shot on goal, a mo
mentous occasion that happened
only twice.
Johnson was excited, yet not sur
prised to see her team playing so
smoothly.
"They were ready to play," she
said. "We've had a week of prac
tice. .. getting back on home turf
and getting our passing, timing and
shooting down was really nice."
As the clock dwindled to its final
minutes and shouts of "quickly,
quickly, quickly" erupted from both
teams' benches, Pacific was able to
send the ball down to the Cardinal
goal. Although time had expired.
Pacific was set up a penalty shot.
The Tigers then took the shot and
followed the ricochet off goalie Meg
Crowley. In an extended battle, Pa
cific was able to wrangle it from the
Cardinal and score its first and last
goal of the game. The goal was
recorded by the Tigers' senior for
ward, Sarah Wright.
While the win was satisfying,

Johnson was observing her team's
play more intricately than by the
overall score.
"Our goal for the game was to
keep the ball on the right side [since]
our right is really fast," Johnson said.
"It's also [the] strong side so it helps
us cross the ball into the circle better.
We did that exclusively in the first
half and in most of the second half." v
Prior to the game, the team had
pinpointed some areas for improve
ment and hoped to be at its best
against the Tigers.
"We had a few adjustments we
needed to make from the Boston
trip," Johnson said. These included
"taking more shots and finishing the
rebounds on the shot."
Considering Stanford finished
the day with 42 shots, nearly tripling
its season average, Johnson had to
be pleased.
On defense, Stanford was stellar.
Allowing just two shots, Crowley
came within a few seconds of her
seventh shutout of the season.
"When we got out there I think we
felt right away that we were playing
like our old selves. People got really
excited and things started to click,"
Crowley said. "There's been four or
five games when 1 literally have not
[fielded] a single shot. That's evi
dence of how good this defense is."
