# Freshman writers help community
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
For nearly fifteen years the Com
munity Service Writing program has
helped freshmen integrate good work
into their homework.
Over the past two years the pro
gram has maJe a push to integrate
new media and the monetary needs
of the service organizations into the
curriculum. Along with the recent
separation from the Haas Center for
Public Service and the development
of the Community Service Writing
Awards, the program has made im
portant changes on behalf of both the
students and the organizations they
serve.
For example, community-service
organizations often hire expensive
professionals to write grant applica
tions, as large amounts of money can
be at stake. Within the community
service writing program. Stanford
students have been taking on these
projects themselves, with real bene
fits for the community-service
groups.
Recent grant-writing projects
have been especially successful. "One
group was awarded a $50,000 grant
because of a proposal written by our
students," said Ardell Thomas, direc
tor of the Community Service Writ
ing program.
Thomas points out that the com
munity service projects exercise the
skills learned in writing other papers

throughout the quarter.
"The students use all the skills
they've learned and put it to use," she
said. "And in the case where you get
$S(),(XX) for a community-service or
ganization, the students can really
say, 'Wow, my argument must have
worked.' This is great for the non
profits and it's a great skill for stu
dents to have."
Thomas also said that the program
recently added Web page creation as
an acceptable community service
project. "The Web is starting to play a
huge role for non-profits, especially
grassroots organizations that basical
ly have no money."
One student who participated last
year, sophomore Misty Hvman, pro
duced work that eventually appeared
on a non-profit organization's Web
site.
"I worked for a program called
Global Roots," Hvman said. "We got
to see how a non-profit runs, and all
the things they have to do like grant
proposals and mission statements.
We wrote about ten different mission
statements for the group so they
could choose, and I went and inter
viewed people who had been in
volved with the program so they
could put it on their Web site."
One student project last year re
searched where an organization
could find free Web space and then
built a site for the group. Thomas
said, "It makes the group look really
professional. Some people may think

a Web site is not a real writing project
but it takes so much research and
there's so much thinking about how
to put this information together in a
concise and creative way."
In addition to providing much
needed services to non-profit organi
zations, the founders hoped that the
Community Service Writing program
would help students learn how to
write for an audience beyond the
writing instructor.
"More often than not. the commu
nity service writing projects are going
out to a huge general audience,"
Thomas said. "Brochures might be
sent out to 1(),(XX) people to let them
know about the organization. Stu
dents recently did a project like that
for the Family Giving Tree and the
more circulation they have, the more
people who respond to their
brochures, the more clothes and toys
and food they get to distribute during
the holidays."
Other times the projects are for in
ternal use. but still have an important
impact. Thomas added, "I had a
group of students last year who
worked for the Names Project, which
puts together the AIDS quilt. They
wanted to start an oral history project
to go with the quilt and as an organi
zation they didn't know how to start
doing that. My students wrote a how
to. including the history of oral histo
ries and their significance, how do
you go about conducting them, not
just how to use the equipment but

how to ask questions."
The group of students that created
the oral history guide for the Names
Project was one of four groups that
received the first annual Community
Service Writing Awards.
The program has been growing
throughout the 19905, from three to
four Community Service Writing
classes per quarter at the beginning of
the decade to six or seven per quarter
in 1998. Also, added Thomas, "More
and more students are putting the
classes as their first choice."
Sophomore Elisabeth Presser,
who was involved in the class last year
and now works as the student assis
tant to the program, says that her con
tinued involvement "stems from my
experience last year. It's really unique
on campus. And there are so many
organizations off campus, I really
value that people get a sense of the
surrounding community, because
Stanford can be really isolated."
Thomas believes that the greatest
benefit of the program is keeping the
University in touch with the commu
nity. "The program stresses ties be
tween Stanford and the rest of the
world. We don't have to be an entity
over here in and of ourselves. The stu
dents learn about problems they say
they never even knew existed and the
groups really benefit from having
these bright-eyed first-year students
and their new take on old problems.
The program builds connections peo
ple otherwise might not make."
