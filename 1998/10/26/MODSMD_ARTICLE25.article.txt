## Stanford ranks No. 2 in quality 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
According to the Institute for Sci
entific Information, Stanford placed
second in the group's "top-10 tourna
ment" of U.S. universities in research
quality and influence. Only Harvard
University ranked higher.
Unlike rankings such as those
published by U.S. News and World
Report, which rank universities for
educational value according to sub
jective, self-reported data, the insti
tute's rankings are purely objective
— quantitative rather than qualita
tive.
"The important thing to remem
ber is that we are not subjectively say
ing who has best reputation because
they have the nicest buildings," said
Christopher King, editor of the insti
tute's Science Watch, which publi
cizes the rankings. "We are looking
at what scientists themselves judge
important — they must acknowl
edge their sources and points of de
parture."
The institute assesses research
universities by looking through its
database of scientific articles that
have appeared in significant journals.
The articles are not judged by con
tent but by which authors from which
universities are cited most often. Sci
ence Watch "calculates the citations
per paper per university."
The institute ranks the universi
ties in more than 20 categories span
ning the biological, physical and so
cial science disciplines. The overall
rank in the top 10 is determined not
by the average overall ranking but by
how many different categories a
school is ranked in. Stanford ranks
second because it appears in 13 of the
21 lists; Harvard ranks first because it

appears in 17.
"I think that being on 13 of the
lists indicates quite a breadth of sig
nificance and quality," King said.
This is the second list released by
the institute. Stanford was ranked
first in the last list, released in 1994,
which encompassed papers cited be
tween 1981 and 1993. The current
rankings include papers cited be
tween 1993 and 1997.
"This is one way of looking at the
impact of an institution on the rest of
academia and society," said Stanford
Dean of Research Patricia Jones.
"But there is no clear, most relevant
indicator to decide which is the top
research university in the world."
According to Jones, the calcula
tions take a university's relative size
into consideration as well, meaning
that a smaller school can have as
much impact as a large institution.
"Obviously, people are always
pleased when their institutions are
highly ranked," King said. "It's im
portant to note that this is just one
measure."
"[One must] take these things
with a grain of salt, but it's always nice
when Stanford ranks high," Jones
said.
"I think the rankings could have
much more of an effect than the U.S.
News rankings," said Taylor Rick
etts, a doctoral student in the Biology
Department.
"The ISI rankings definitely have
an effect — they're a pretty good
measure of the impact a paper would
have," Ricketts said. "Stanford's
place on the list doesn't surprise me.
One of the exciting things about
being here for grad school is working
with [scientists who are often cited in
these papers] and who shaped the
discipline," Ricketts added.
