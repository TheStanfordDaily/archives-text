# Cal's Hunt scores in 103rd minute to defeat Card
## 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
Before yesterday afternoon's
game against California, Stanford
women's soccer head coach Steve
Swanson stated the obvious.
"Despite what happens during
the game, at the end of the day, who
ever scores the most wins," Swanson
said.
The Stanford women's soccer
team (7-6-2 overall, 1-4 Pacific 10
Conference) 1-0 overtime loss to the
California Bears (10-6-0,4-1), yester
day, epitomizes this logic.
Although neither team dominat
ed the game, Ashlee Hunt's goal in
the 103 rd minute of play enabled the
Bears to emerge victorious.
As Cal and Stanford near the con
clusion of their regular season
games, yesterday's match had defi
nite ramifications for both teams.
For the Bears, who sit atop the
Pac-10, it was an effort to maintain
dominance within the conference to
ensure an automatic bid to the

NCAA tournament.
Despite a promising 6-1-2 start
and a ninth-place ranking in the polls
as of Oct. 5, the Cardinal, on the
other hand, has faltered in recent
conference games.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ Yesterday: California (10-6-0
overall, 4-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
defeated Stanford (7-6-2. 1-4), 1-0
(OT).

Although these losses have elimi
nated the possibility of Stanford win
ning the Pac-10 , the team clings to
the chance of continuing post-season
play. Teams which are not confer
ence winners can only enter the tour
nament by achieving high rankings in
polls.
Yesterday's loss, however, does
not boost the Cardinal's dwindling
post-season opportunities.
Both teams played similar defen
sive styles throughout the game, but
Cal's adjustment to a more offensive
playing style during overtime was the

critical factor in the Bears' victory.
Throughout the season, the Car
dinal has struggled to be the aggres
sor and impose its playing style on its
opponents. Yesterday's loss was no
exception.
The first half was a defensive bat
tle in which neither team could find
the back of the net. Despite out
shooting the Bears 3-1 during this
half, the Cardinal could not capital
ize on its scoring opportunities.
"We kept our shape and stayed
close," said junior defender Natalie
Kim. "We played defensively, but
got some more offensive chances be
cause of our playing style."
The Cardinal's frustrations con
tinued when officials called back a
Stanford goal.
"We were doing well bringing up
the ball," Kim added. Then, "they
called back our goal. That was kind
of frustrating."
The Cardinal's inability to profit
from its threatening chances contin
ued during the second half of play.
Although Stanford had four corner

kick opportunities, the team could
not get a shot off any of these
chances.
During the second half, the Bears
gradually became more aggressive,
outshooting the Cardinal, seven to
five.
In the overtime period, however,
the Bears' playing style evolved into
an aggressive charge in which they
retained possession of the ball for the
majority of the extra period.
"Our team was spread apart,"
said Stanford sophomore forward
Christy Arnold. "We did not play the
way we could have played. We were
confused and they picked it up."
Cal managed to get two shots off
and attained the "Golden Goal"
when Amy Balavac found teammate
Hunt.
"They put it in the net, which is
something we couldn't do," Arnold
said.
Stanford wraps up a five-game
road trip when the team competes
against the Washington schools next
weekend.
