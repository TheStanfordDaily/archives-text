### Anthony Chiu 
Today kicks off a week of activi
ties to celebrate Dia de los Muertos.
a Mexican holiday that pays tribute
to the dead.
"Dia de Los Muertos commemo
rates death and it celebrates the lives
of those who have passed on." said
senior Manuel Ojeda, the publicity
coordinator for El Centro Chicano.
"Death is crucial to Mexican culture
— you both respect it and you mock
it."
There will be an activity each
night of the week, starting tonight
with a mask-making workshop at
6:30 p.m. in the lounge of El Centro
Chicano. Masks are an integral part
of the costume worn in the tradition
al procession to the cemetery to pay
honor to the dead.
In Tuesday night's event, "Meta
morphosis," participants will learn
the appropriate attire for the festivi
ties — with a twist. Attendees will
undergo a gender transformation in
a makeup workshop. The event is
sponsored by La Familia, Stanford's
gay Latino group, and will begin at 7
p.m. in El Centro Chicano's lounge.
Wednesday will feature a work
shop on how to prepare two tradi
tional foods of Dia de los Muertos:
pan de muertos (bread of the dead)
and sugar skulls. Both are taken to
altars and gravesites and offered to
the deceased. Participants will have
the opportunity to cook at 7 p.m. in
the Casa Zapata lounge.
Thursday night will be the instal
lation and presentation of the altar,
which is the centerpiece of the festiv
ities. "The idea behind Dia de Los
Muertos is that the spirits will visit
their home, and the altars are made
for them," said senior Crystal Zer
meno, the program director for El
Centro.
Features of an altar include a
bowl of water to quench thirst, can
dles and marigold petals to lead the
way and mementos that the person
enjoyed in life. People are asked to
bring anything they would like to

place on the altar, which will be in
stalled by artist Rene Yanez at 7 p.m.
in the lounge of El Centro.
The celebration concludes Friday
night with several activities starting
at 7 p.m. at Old Union.

Folklorico de Stanford.
