Kitchen theft at Bob
Thieves stole a microwave, 10
pounds of Hank steak and a box of
Kudos from Bob House this past
week.
"This is not something new,"
assistant kitchen manager An
drew Taylor said.
Bulk packages of chicken and
$150 worth of shrimp have also
been stolen from Bob recently,
bringing the count to four fcxxl
burglaries at Bob this academic
year.
Two weekends ago, Taylor no
ticed unidentified individuals re
moving a window screen from
Bob. He drove his truck on the
grass to scare them off.
"Someone has stumbled upon
what they think is a good, easy
deal," said Stanford Police Lieu
tenant Del Bandy.

Although the kitchen in Bob is
unsecured, residents there are ex
tremely conscientious about clos
ing up at night, according to
Bandy.
"The residents are informed
and the dtx>rs are always locked,"
said Lisa Haley, the resident assis
tant at Bob.
The staff is recommending
that everyone in the house ques
tion people when they walk in.
Staff have also placed padlocks
and chain locks on all refrigera
tors.
Residents are also looking into
alternative security measures.
The house staff has contacted
Stanford Police in the hopes of
obtaining a night watchman.
'We're tossing around the
idea of installing security cam
eras," Taylor said. If the cameras
are installed, which Taylor said is

likely, they will cost about $350.
With security cameras,
though, Haley feels that the at
mosphere at Bob will be changed.
"We don't want to put in secu
rity cameras because of the way
people might feel," Haley said.
Photo stolen from Tri-
Delt
The 1997 composite photo of
the Delta Delta Delta sorority
was reported stolen to Stanford
Police last Monday.
According to Stanford Police
Lieutenant Del Bandy, a suspect
entered the lobby of the Tri-Delt
house and removed the sorority's
1997 composite photo of its mem
bers late last month. There was no
sign of forced-entry.
Jenny Pippin, director of pub
lic relations for Tri-Delt, hopes
that whoever took the picture will

return it.
"It was the one item in our
house that made our house the
most personal and most at home
for us," Pippin said.
The police suspect that the
photo might have been taken as a
joke.
"The house feels it might he a
prank," Bandy said.
Even if it is a prank, it is still
considered felony grand theft.
According to the police report,
Tri-Delt places the value of the
photo at $650.
"The urging would he to re
turn the photograph or make offi
cials aware of where it can be lo
cated," said Bandy.
Pippin said that she is disap
pointed by the theft because she
wants the sorority to get off to a
good start in its new house.
