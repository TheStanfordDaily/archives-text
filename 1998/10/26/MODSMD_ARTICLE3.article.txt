# Three-tiered plan
## Task force proposes new Draw 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
A proposal for a new. three-tiered Undergraduate
Housing Draw system will he brought before students
over the next two weeks.
The new system would give every student a chance to
be among the approximate top third of all Draw groups
during one of three years, while being delegated to the
approximate middle third in another year and forced to
draw in the bottom third during the remaining year of
guaranteed housing.
Two focus groups, each consisting of 12 to 15 ran
domly selected students, will be asked their opinion on
the proposal this week, while next week all students will
be given a chance to respond to the proposal at an open
forum on the issue.
The proposal is being considered by the Residential
Programs Implementation Group, which consists of
both students and administrators.
The group conducted a web survey
on the issue of modifying the Draw
last spring.
Student response from the sur
vey led the three-tier proposal, said
Kathleen Bransfield. manager of
Housing Assignment Services.
About 200 students responded to
the survey, she said.
According to Bransfield, a mem
ber of the implementation group,
the complicated issue of how stu
dents would switch over to the new
system is a major concern.
"The full benefits of [changing
the system] would not be realized
for a couple of years," she said.
Bransfield was quick to point out
that no final decisions have been
made and that the focus groups and
open forum are designed to get
feedback from students.
Many students feel they have
never received a chance to live in
their top housing choices due to the
wide range of numbers available to
students who draw preferred.
In the fall of 19%, a task force
was created to respond to this and
other concerns involving under
graduate student housing. In a re
port to the provost in 1997, the task
force recommended replacing two
preferred years with one "premier"
year. In the premier year, students
would receive draw numbers below
1,2(X) to increase the likelihood of
attaining housing they actually pre
ferred for at least one year.
"It's the responsibility of the im
plementation group to act on the
recommendations," said Director
of Undergraduate Advising Lori
White, who was a member of the
task force and is on the implemen
tation committee.
The group has already imple
mented some of the changes sug
gested by the task force, such as in
creasing the number of all-fresh
man dorms and allowing students
access to their Draw numbers be
fore having to submit their housing

choices.
But after studying student sur
vey responses, the idea of one "pre
mier" year is no longer being seri
ously considered.
"The recommendation of the
task force and the underlying prin
ciple were to make [the Draw] more
equitable. We felt that wasn't going
to happen with the premier year,"
said Bransfield.
"What's important to students
varies tremendously," she said,
"For some students privacy is the
most important thing, while others
would be happy with a one-room
triple in Bob .... The definition of
'premier' year varies from student
to student."
The current system gives stu
dents two preferred years, during
which they randomly receive a
number between one and 2,000,
and one unpreferred year, during
which they draw below the students
using their preferred years. Stu
dents are allowed to draw in groups
of as many as eight, with the entire
group receiving the same number.
Each student then submits a list
of housing choices ranked in order
of preference. Residences are then
filled based on students' Draw
numbers and their list of choices,
with special consideration given to
filling academic focus and ethnic
theme housing, as well as certain in
dividual circumstances.
A open forum similar to one
scheduled for next week was held
last year, but Bransfield said only
two students attended the meeting.
"I like the idea of the open
forum," said ASSU Vice President
Santos Marroquin, suggesting that
students simply weren't aware of
the previous forum. "I definitely
plan on going," he said.
Bransfield noted that no matter
what changes are made to the
Draw, "whenever you have a lot
tery type system, there is no way to
insure a given outcome."
"We don't want to make things
worse," said Bransfield. "There is a
fair amount of work that goes into
[a change]. We're not interested in
changing it just to change it."
