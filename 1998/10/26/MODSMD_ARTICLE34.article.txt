TEMPE, Ariz. — Another week,
another gridiron disaster. Another
dagger twisting in the gut of a Cardi
nal football team already painfully
low on stomach lining.

FOOTBALL

■ Thursday night: Arizona St. (3-4
overall, 2-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
defeated Stanford (1-6, 0-4), 44-38
(OT).

This time, it came on a Thursday
night, in Arizona State's (3-4 overall,
2-2 Pacific 10Conference) Sun Devil
Stadium.
The Cardinal (1-6, 0-4) pushed
the game to overtime but came away
with the same result — A devastat
ing Stanford loss, made all the more
painful by the fact that it could have
been won.
"We're disappointed. We're
hurt," said Stanford head coach Ty
rone Willingham. "If we didn't make
some major mistakes, we would've
had a chance to have an explosive
ballgame. At the same time, I
thought the kids showed a great deal
of character in fighting back."
Stanford had to light back almost
immediately, as the highlight-reel
running by ASU preseason Heis
man candidate J.R. Redmond led to
an early 14-0 Sun Devil lead.
The junior tailback took a hand
off from quarterback Chad Elliott,
who was starting in place of the Ryan
Kealy, and blasted off tackle into the
Stanford secondary. Several blown
tackles, a nice hip shake that froze

the Cardinal safety, and 58 yards
later, ASU was staked to a 7-0 lead.
Kealy was taken out of the starting
role due to a lack of luster in the pre
vious couple of games.
Just five minutes later, Stanford's
special teams travesties continued,
as Redmond caught Kevin Miller's
punt at the Sun Devil 24-yard line
and went untouched for the entire
length of the field.
The lackluster start was disap
pointing given how well Stanford
began the game. Sophomore Ruben
Carter, who replaced the injured and
much maligned Brian Taylor at the
cornerback position, ended the Sun
Devils' first drive with a beautiful
pick from Elliott. Though perhaps
doomed from the start of the game,
Carter was all over wideout Tariq
McDonald on an out pattern, and
stepped in front for his first intercep
tion of the year.
On the very next play, Stanford
offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick
began his game-long prank on ASIJ,
running a quarterback carousel that
saw junior Todd I lusak shuffling in
and out of the game with redshirt
freshmen Joe Borchard and Randy
Fasani like Hankers sent into the
huddle with the play call.
Twice, Stanford rotated quarter
hacks on consecutive plays and
though Husak was in on roughly
two-thirds of the plays, Borchard
was in enough to throw two touch
down passes to put the Cardinal on
the board at 14-7.
"It kept them off balance and
made them confused," Fasani said.
"It obviously showed when they had
to call timeouts. The coaches are just
looking for answers. We're 1-6 and

need victories."
After another Redmond touch
down to start the second quarter, the
Cardinal crawled within seven as
Tim Smith's blocked punt set up
Deßonnie Pitts' quick out for a
touchdown. Going into halltime,
Stanford trailed 21-14.
Stanford received to open the
second half, and immediately tied
the game with a 78-yard Pitts touch
down reception against perhaps the
worst blown coverage since the Car
dinal's own performance in Oregon.
ASU safety Christon Ranee bit so
hard on an under pattern by Stan
ford's Troy Walters that Pitts found
himself several area codes away
from any taco-colored uniforms.
"It was nice to open the second
with that big play [and] create a little
excitement." Willingham said.
The only truly effective running
play by a Stanford back all day was
Fasani's third quarter touchdown
pitch to junior Juan-Carlos Lacey.
That option gave Stanford a 31-
24 lead entering the fourth. Howev
er, disaster loomed.
Elliot proved ineffective after
Redmond left the game with a
sprained ankle, so Kealy entered the
game and promptly engineered a 89-
yard game-tying drive. And the walls
started crumbling down.
Stanford and ASIJ traded touch
downs in the fourth, and the game
came down to the Cardinal's last
possession.
Already in the middle of a spec
tacular day, with 10 catches for 131
yards, Walters took the kickoff from
the 7-yard line, shimmied outside,
busted through a seam in the ASU
coverage and romped 93 yards for

the apparent game-winning score.
"I knew there was something
wrong when I went in the end zone,
and everyone in the crowd was
pointing the other way," Walters
said.
A clipping penalty called the run
all the way back to the 11-yard line,
where Stanford picked up a first
down before going three and out.
Kevin Miller's punt with 50 seconds
left in the game set ASU up on the

37, but a missed field goal as time ex
pired sent the game to overtime.
ASU won the toss and elected to
defend first.
Stanford didn't even bother at
tempting to jump-start its running
game, as Husak threw three straight
incomplete passes from the 25-yard
line, two of which could be credited
to Sun Devil pressure on the quar
terback. Kevin Miller then missed
the 42-yard field goal, and it was

clear what the Sun Devils would
need to do to earn their second con
ference victory.
ASU needed only a field goal to
win the game, but death came much
more swiftly for Ruben Carter and
the rest of the tired Stanford de
fense. Kealy went right for the throat
with a deep slant to McDonald for
six points and the game. ASU fans
stormed the field as a dejected Car
dinal squad left in quiet agony.
