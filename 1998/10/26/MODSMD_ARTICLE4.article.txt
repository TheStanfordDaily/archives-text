# Large donation possible from Hong Kong foundation
## Center for Buddhist studies opens 
### Danielle Chang 
The department of East Asian
Studies opened a Center for Buddhist
Studies last week in the hope of se
curing the donation of a $2 million en
dowment for the program from a
1 long Kong foundation.
The foundation has been looking
for a program to fund with a strong
academic emphasis on Buddhist
studies, rather than a purely religious
angle. Although Stanford fits that cri
terion. the foundation wants to see

that the University is willing to ex
pand its existing program within the
East Asian Studies Department.
"That's why the opening of the
center is also an act showing the en
dowment owners the will of Stan
ford's Buddhism program." said cen
ter director Bernard Faure.
While the center currently re
ceives the $70,000 annual interest
from the endowment, it has not yet
been promised the entire $2 million.
The center's budget also includes
donations from a former Stanford

professor given years ago.
"To fully implement our plans for
academic programs and visiting re
search and teaching positions, [it)
would require an annual budget of at
least $750,000," said the center's co
director Carl Bielefeldt.
The center seeks to attract stu
dents to the program, to expand cur
riculum and faculty, to encourage re
search dissemination and to facilitate
scholarly exchange by holding sym
posia and conferences.
The center is also working to pro

vide research funds and promote
public understanding of Buddhism.
Its ultimate goal is to serve as both an
educational and informational re
source for the Bay Area.
The center is located in Building
70. the new home of the Religious
Studies Department and former
home of Humanities Special Pro
grams. When the Humanities pro
gram moved to Building2so. the I )ni
versity was able to reserve three
rooms for the center.
The center is currently comprised
of a conference room, a computer
room and an office on the ground
floor of Building 70.
"[The University] said that they
don't even dream of [possible vacan
cy]," recalled Faure when he had
originally asked the University for
some space.
Lack of space is a problem that
will worsen when the center tries to
expand, admitted Faure. "For now
we're just happy to have the center
set up," he said.
Stanford's Buddhist Studies pro
gram is among the top two or three
such programs in the nation, accord
ing to Faure.
The program's approach is unique
in that it hasn't as much "Christian

flavor" in its discussion, said Nadav
Caine, a doctoral student in Reli
gious Studies. "The program offers
more historical and cultural perspec
tive."
Julius Tsai, a religious studies doc
toral student, echoed Caine's com
ment and said that the program's
combination of "historical and textu
al works makes it an innovative ap
proach" to studying religious theory.
"The study of religion is impor
tant because it is one of the few places
in the university where students think
about questions of ultimate meaning
and value, and do so in a way that is
very much tied to history and tradi
tion," he said.
The center will soon launch its
Web site, along with its newsletter, to
keep students and the community in
formed.
The center will host its first con
ference series in May.
