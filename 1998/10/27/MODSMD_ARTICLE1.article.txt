# Findlen to co-chair STS
## 
### Huat Chye Lim Contributing writer 
Beginning fall quarter 1999,
Assoc. History Prof. Paula Findlen
will co-chair the Program in Science,
Technology and Society. Findlen,
who is currently on leave from the
Stanford Humanities Center, will
share the directorship of the program
with Industrial Engineering Prof.
Robert McGinn, currently the inter
im chair.
The appointment marks a drastic
change from the program's situation
of two years ago, when the Faculty
Senate considered dropping STS'
status as a degree-granting program.
Findlen, who is on the STS Pro
gram Committee, was appointed
chair for several reasons, including
the need to hire new faculty after the
retirement of several existing profes
sors.
"The program is now a unit of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
which makes it fitting that a tenured
faculty member from that school be
in charge of STS," McGinn said. He
added that Findlen could also help
serve as a program advisor.
Although Findlen was originally
appointed STS chair, she voluntarily
approached McGinn to share the di
rectorship with her. McGinn, unlike
Findlen, has an engineering back
ground, and Findlen wanted to "have
people representing both sides of
what STS stands for here — both the
humanities and the engineering sci
ences," she said. For his part,
McGinn said he was pleased to ac
cept.
Findlen, who helped launch an
STS-like program in a previous
teaching position at UC-Davis, plans*
to make several changes to the pro

gram here when she assumes the co
chair position. Programs sueh as STS
cannot hire their own faculty. Asa re
sult. "One of the problems ... is get
ting enough faculty who consider the
program as their primary commit
ment."
As co-chair, Findlen plans to solve
this by making "strategic [faculty]
hires who will consider STS to be
their primary commitment." To facil
itate this. Findlen said, the adminis
tration has established an associate
professorship committed to STS.
Findlen hopes to have this position
filled by the end of the academic
year.
In addition to making new hires,
Findlen plans to increase the interdis
ciplinary quality of STS, in part by
hiring new faculty, but also by estab
lishing more connections with other
departments. For example, bringing
a sociology professor into the pro
gram would help establish new ties
with the Sociology Department — a
prospect that is especially important
in that sociology and STS are highly
related fields, she said.
Finally, Findlen. who teaches
courses in the Program in History
and Philosophy of Science, hopes to
increase cooperation between that
program and STS. "The different as
pects of STS [and HPS) have always
overlapped," Findlen said. In the fu
ture, she envisions shared hires,
speaker series and a general sense of
"common community" between the
two programs.
Students will benefit from her
planned influx of new personnel in
that they will enjoy a wider variety of
advisors and courses to choose from,
Findlen said.
In addition, students will benefit
"from solid, imaginative and respect
ed leadership, and 1 believe Prof.
Findlen, along with Prof. McGinn,
can provide this," said American
Studies Coordinator Joseph Corn,
who also teaches in STS.
Corn and McGinn agreed that
Findlen's appointment as co-chair
marks a drastic reversal from two
years ago, when the STS program was
about to lose its degree-granting sta
tus. STS majors at the time organized

a "Save STS" campaign that amassed
a 2,300-signature petition and suc
ceeded in rescuing the department.
Findlen's appointment, "along
with the authorization of new hires
for the program, evidence the [ad
ministration's current] strong sup
port of STS," said Corn.
"I certainly would not have ac
cepted [the STS] directorship if I had
any doubts" as to the administra
tion's support of the program, she
said. To Findlen, the new faculty are
evidence of this support. "We should
stop worrying about STS' presence
on campus The major is thriv
ing," she said.
