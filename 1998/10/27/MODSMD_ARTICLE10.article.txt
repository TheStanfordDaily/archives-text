## Sundquist supports widow of slain Burks 
### 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) —
After being criticized for not say
ing anything, Republican Gov. Don
Sundquist announced today he sup
ports the write-in candidacy of the
widow of slain Democratic state
Sen. Tommy Burks.
Sundquist had distanced himself
from Byron (Low Tax) Looper,
Burks' GOP opponent who was
arrested Friday and charged with
shooting the lawmaker. But he was
attacked by Democrats during the
weekend for not combining that
with an endorsement of Charlotte

Burks.
Burks' body was found Oct. 19
in his pickup truck on his farm in
Monterey in central Tennessee. He
had been shot once in the head.
Burks' name will be stripped
from the ballot. However,
Democrats cannot name another
candidate because his death
occurred within 30 days of the elec
tion. Looper's name —he legally
changed his middle name to (Low
Tax) — will remain on the ballot
because he hasn't been convicted of
a felony.
