SAO PAULO. Brazil (AP) — Pres
ident Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
plan to pull Brazil out of economic
turmoil received a strong boost with
the re-election of a key ally as gov
ernor of Brazil's largest state.
But opposition candidates took
five of the other 12 governorships in
Sunday's vote, which many Brazil
ians saw as a referendum on Car
doso's austerity measures. Cardoso
was expected to announce those
measures Tuesday.
Sao Paulo Gov. Mario Covas, a
supporter of the president, was re
elected to a second term, turning
back a challenge by two-time former
governor Paulo Maluf. Covas

received 55 percent of the vote to
Malufs 45 percent.
Sao Paulo is Brazil's industrial
and financial powerhouse. It has a
population of more than 34 million,
accounts for more than one-third of
Brazil's economic output and holds
70 seats in the 513-seat congress.
Cardoso's austerity measures —
which include spending cuts and tax
increases — must be approved by
Congress, and state governors have
enormous sway over local delega
tions.
Brazil is caught up in the global
financial crisis that began last year in
Asia and shifted to Russia before
spreading here. In the past two

months, investors fearful of an eco
nomic slump and weaker currency
have withdrawn some $25 billion
from the country.
Cardoso's economic team and
the International Monetary Fund
are discussing ways to slash Brazil's
deficit of around $65 billion, equal
to 7 percent of its gross domestic
product. The austerity plan must be
tough enough to persuade the IMF
to approve emergency loans worth
$30 billion.
"By electing Covas, the elec
torate voted in favor of austerity,"
Health Minister Jose Serra said.
Covas told reporters his victory
showed that voters understand "that

you cannot spend more than you
take in."
In other states, however, Car
dosos allies did not fare as well.
In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony
Garotinho of the center-left Demo
cratic Labor Party was elected with
58 percent of the vote over former
Rio mayor Cesar Maia, a Cardoso
ally.
"I will support the (austerity)
measures but with restrictions,"
Garotinho said.
In southern Rio Grande do Sul,
an important farm state, Olivio
Dutra of the leftist Workers Party
was elected with 51 percent of the
vote over a Cardoso backer.
