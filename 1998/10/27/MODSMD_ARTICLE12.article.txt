Stop being apathetic
about being apathetic
and vote on Nov. 3

Living busy lives within the
happy confines of the Farm, we
often forget about the outside world
and leave weighty issues for others to
decide. It is important, however, that those
whom we elect to represent us are the best
people for the job.
The Nov. 3 elections are rapidly
approaching. Issues such as smaller class
sizes at all educational levels, air quality
improvement measures and new public
transportation systems deserve the atten
tion of students and faculty alike. Election
awareness is a serious issue; we must think
beyond the Farm and exercise our right to
choose.
For the last election in 19%, the average
voter participation rate among Stanford
precincts was 49 percent, which is, in view
of the 33 percent average for college stu
dents nationwide, a good start. Hut more
work must be done.
A democracy depends on its voters to
choose wisely among various candidates —
but choosing to vote at all is the most
important choice.
Several political events have already
been held this year. Two weeks ago, the
Barbara Boxer/Matt Fong debate for the
Senate race in the Castano Lounge attract
ed a crowd of both Stanford Democrats
and Stanford Republicans. Around the
same time, California Assemblyman Ted
Lcmpert brought his re-election campaign
to Stanford by holding office hours in
White Plaza, encouraging students to get
more involved with state and national gov
ernment. Most importantly, almost all cam

pus political parties had tables in White
Plaza providing voter registration forms.
Nevertheless, these events, although of
noble intentions, do not address the crux of
the problem. Aside from students who are
already involved in political events or
clubs, it seems that election awareness is
simply not a pressing issue to most stu
dents. This results in a type of uneducated
apathy and, consequently, poor voter
turnout.
Election interest must start at the gener
al student level. Regardless of interest —
community service, research in the
humanities or the sciences or doing nothing
but breathing (clean air, that is) — there
are important issues that require student
input. For example, one proposition seeks
to raise over nine billion dollars to build
new classrooms and add state-of-the-art
educational technologies at every level,
from kindergarten through college. Stu
dents are the most important voters on
these types of issues. Regardless of our
opinions about politics or the current con
dition of the state or of the nation, voting
does help change things and reward those
who have represented our interests merito
riously and accurately.
Students should involve other students
in discussions about the issues through
house meeting presentations, issues forums
or late-night dorm room discussions. To
muster interest in elections and candidates,
an interest in issues must first be generated.
Although many of us might have
smirked at the Campus Green Vote's sign
about the diminishing average sperm count
as we flew through White Plaza, most did
not stop and register to vote. But for the
next election, it is important that we do
choose to vote. Setting the example for
other students by agreeing to voice our
own opinions will leave both us and our
government better served.
