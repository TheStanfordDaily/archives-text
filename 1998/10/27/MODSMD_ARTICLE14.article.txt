## TV station jinxes Stanford football 
### 
TO SAY THE
least, our football
team is not having
its "season of seasons."
In fact, in a word, we're
terrible.
But just how bad are we?
Well, for one, we started

off the season losing to San Jose State.
The last time anyone lost to the Spartans
was back a few thousand years before we
decided to keep track of time by counting
years in the "up" direction. That team was
from Athens. And that was only the
beginning. We currently have one win.
We've played seven games. You know it's
a bad year when your school will have
more NCAA championships than your
team has wins.
We've taken the concept of "rebuild
ing" to a new level. In fact, wins are com
ing about as infrequently as entertaining
computer science majors. (I'm on a roll,
baby!) Assuming any of you read the
Daily, the football stories have been
appearing more frequently towards the
back of the sports section, behind
accounts of the exciting exploits of "team
badminton" and the ever-popular (and
highly athletic) sailing squad. Then there
was the ill-fated, "We'll win ... 1 guaran
tee it" campaign. Good call. Athletics
Department, really nice, but, "You'll lose
money ... I guarantee it."
So what is the source of our woes?
Yeah, our team is young and somewhat
inexperienced, but that's not it. There isn't
a player on our team who couldn't hold
his own anywhere else in the country.
Could it be our offense? Possibly, but our
offense does just fine against our defense
in practice (that may have been too subtle

for some of you). And it's not like we've
been getting blown out. If you take away
the first five or so minutes of the Notre
Dame game, that's our win. And we've
been close in our other attempts. If there
were only "half-wins" for making it to
overtime or keeping the score within
seven, we'd have a decent record (well,
two wins instead of one, but hey, that's
twice as good!).
So something else must be holding us
back. It's not really clear at first glance,
and may not be clear after this column.
But I have the answer, damn it, and you're
all going to listen. The reason why we're
no good this year is Fox Sports West.
But what is this Fox Sports West? It is
the station that televises quite a few of our
games. It is also the station whose
announcers have one singular talent: jinx
ing Stanford football.
Before getting into the announcers, a
little bit about the station: Fox Sports
West is ESPN's retarded cousin. Why is
the picture so bad? Did you ever notice
that it dramatically improved when Sony
released its brand new hand-held mini
cam? Coincidence? I think not.
Pathetic picture quality aside, the true
source of the debacle that is our football
team is the announcers. If you've ever
watched a game on television, you've
asked the same question: How did these
people get hired?
While I've never applied for the job, I
can guess what the application looks like:
"Have you ever played any high school
sports, or their equivalent? Can you read
at the third grade level, or its equivalent?
Do you have an uncanny knack for point
ing out information that no other normal
human being would consider important?

(This question is weighed heavily in the
final decision.) If Barney were a woman,
would you be 'turned on?' " And on and
on. The application concludes with, "But
most importantly, our announcers must be
able to jinx Stanford football."
How do I know this? By the simple
process of elimination. If it's not the play
ers, and not entirely the fault of team
chemistry, then only the Fox Sports West
announcers remain. And with that bril
liant leap of logic, 1 point my finger
squarely at you, evil announcers.
But is there no hope? Of course not.
The team is a positive force on campus
even if Stanford doesn't win another
game. We love diversity, and I'll be
damned if someone a good two feet taller
and 200 pounds heavier than myself isn't
considered diverse.
Anyway, it's Stanford, and we can
accomplish anything. Once again, the indi
vidual talent on the team is amazing; per
fect team chemistry has been missing, but
unlike a talented Fox Sports West
announcer, this can be found before the
end of the year. And bowl game, no bowl
game — who cares? There's only one rea
son we have a football team. One singular
reason. It's called the "Axe." And no mat
ter how many Trees Cal tries to steal,
(Real smooth there, jackasses — seen
"loitering" around the Band Shak at 4:00
a.m.? That won't look suspicious. Mac-
Gyver, you are not.) the Axe is something
you're not going to take away from us.
So let's go, Stanford football. Bring it
home.

Dan Geyser, a senior majorinj in political
science, hopes that no one has tried to kill
him by this time next week.
