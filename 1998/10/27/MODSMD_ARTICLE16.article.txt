Don't stereotype athletes
From my Irish immigrant ancestors in
the 1 H3()s to today's rap lyrics, every soci
ety has its scapegoat. Stanford's scapegoat
is the Athletics Department, at least
according to Audrey Leung's Oct. 22 let
ter, in which everything lrom alcohol
abuse to reckless golf cart driving is conve
niently blamed on several hundred student
athletes.
Just a few moments after stating that "I
can think of several (athletes) who are a
far cry from the scholars Stanford purports
to admit," Ms. Leung quickly jumps to
"many of them are failing their cours
es... many are rude, uninterested in cam
pus life and often destructive."
I thought I learned in CIV section that
it was unfair to generalize the actions of a
few to a whole group of people.
Leung continues, "I have known ath
letes to throw furniture from balconies,
throw plates as Frisbces from high places,
drop toasters out windows and drive golf
carts into bike racks."
I know people who have thrown furni
ture off the Wilbur balcony, people who
have been arrested for throwing plates like

Frisbces and even people who have no
business behind the wheel of a golf cart,
but amazingly, none of these people are
athletes. It's possible that one of them
played Little League baseball, but I'd have
to check on that.
I guess we can blame toaster-dropping
on athletes, but the rest of these significant
problems have apparently infected our
entire society.
If Leung thinks athletes behave badly
or care little for academics here, she
should spend some time at the University
of Nebraska or read about the course loads
of Andy Katzenmoyer and Miles Simon.
Ms. Leung might also want to educate
herself on the policies of the Athletics
Department. She states, "What is even
more shocking is that despite Stanford's
policy to give aid only on a need basis, and
despite the wealth of many of their fami
lies. many of these athletes are fully fund
ed to 'study' here .... Why is the Athletics
Department exempt from Stanford's poli
cy on aid?"
If Leung had studied the issue at all, she
would have found that the Athletics
Department is financially independent
from the University, completely funding
$7 million in scholarships. Her generaliza

tion about the wealth of athletes' families
is yet another example of her laek of
knowledge on this subject.
At the end of her article Ms. Leung
ponders whether the Athletics Depart
ment has "yet another embarrassment to
hide from its students at the University at
large?" The real embarrassment is her
reckless stereotyping of the nation's best
athletics department, both on and off the
field.
I'm afraid Ms. Leung will have to find
another scapegoat for Stanford's prob
lems. Try the post office or Jamie Z.

Congratulations to Robin Moroney for
his column in last Thursday's Daily. Using
labels to conveniently silence or dismiss
those with whom we disagree should be
avoided in favor of well reasoned argu
ments.
The ability to engage in respectful
debate has traditionally been a hallmark of

educated persons. It is unfortunate that
some Stanford students apparently prefer
to "shout down" or "shut out" views which
differ from their own, rather than thought
fully defend the merits of their own posi
tions.
My wife and I were graduate students at
Stanford in the l%()s. National debate
over the Vietnam War was growing, yet we
saw on campus a definite trend toward sti
lling any perspective except those which
opposed American involvement in South
east Asia. Regardless of one's viewpoint
on that conflict, we were disturbed by
many students' intolerance toward dissent
ing opinions then, as we are now.
I have always thought that a university
is one place where you should be able to
discuss the great issues of the day in a safe
environment characterized by open
inquiry, freedom of expression and per
sonal respect.
Tolerance may be becoming an overrat
ed or mistakenly applied virtue. You and 1
do not simply want to be "tolerated" by
others.
Rather, we seek to be accepted and
understood. We want our ideas to be con
sidered and taken seriously, even if we
later realize that, despite the best of inten

tions, our ideas were wrong. At times, tak
ing my ideas seriously enough to under
stand me might mean that you and I final
ly "agree to disagree" about the best solu
tion to some complex dilemma. This out
come is far more desirable than us merely
trying to tolerate one another.
In today's post-modern academic world
— which often denies even the possibility
of absolute truth — it may seem arcane to
view the university as a place where one
searches for truth.
Nonetheless, it seems to me that Stan
ford should still be a marketplace of
ideas — a place where students remain
unafraid to question basic assumptions in
all areas of life and willing to consider
views which may differ from their current
beliefs.
