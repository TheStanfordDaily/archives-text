# The 						European tour
## A 						hero to history, country, and the world

National heroes are hard
to come by. especially in McMin
nville, Ore. But last week, in the
harsh autumn spotlight of the Fall Classic,
a small-town boy on a big-city team
reminded the nation that heroes come
from unlikely places.
The New York Yankees swept the San
Diego Padres in the World Series last
week on the shoulders of tough pitching
and a little-known third baseman from
Lin field College in McMinnville, a town of
25,000 people southwest of Portland. Scott
Brosius —who batted last in the order
much of the season, who a year ago hit
.203 for one of the worst teams in baseball,
who wasn't even supposed to be the best
third baseman in the series, let alone the
best player — hit .471 and drove in six
runs in four games to win the Series Most
Valuable Player award.
For a McMinnville native trapped in a
country that doesn't know Babe Ruth
from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it was a stir
ring feat. The same Scott Brosius who
used to wander down to baseball camp at
the college and sign autographs for the

local kids, the guy who was best man at my
high school government teacher's wed
ding, was there on the big screen, winning
the World Series for the team of Mantle,
Gehrig and DiMaggio and for all us
McMinnville kids out there watching.
For most of us, anyway.
In all my 20 years 1 had never missed a
World Series before this fall. I remember
watching postgame interviews after the
Dodgers beat the Yankees in 1981, not
being able to sleep for days after Kirk Gib
son's famous game-winning homer against
the A's in 1988, literally crying when they
announced in 1994 that the Series would
be canceled due to the players' strike. And
though I loathe the Yankees like any good
Dodger fan, I couldn't wait to watch New
York in the series this year. I had to see
Brosius.
But televised baseball is hard to come
by in Europe, especially when the games
are live via satellite at 2 a.m. After an
unsuccessful attempt to find Game 1 in
Amsterdam, I tried again in Paris, can
vassing the Latin Quarter with a group of
Padres fans in search of Game 3.

1 did some research, asking around the
American University in Paris, pouring
over TV listings, calling every bar in the
Yellow Pages that advertised a satellite
dish. At 1 a.m. we found a bar with a dish
but no late license; closing time was 20
minutes before the first pitch.
Dejected, we took a night bus back to a
friend's house and combed the bands of
the long-wave radio in his kitchen. No
luck.
I collapsed on his floor around 3:30 and
woke up two hours later, shortly after
Scott Brosius hit his second homer of
Game 3, a three-run shot that won it for
the Yankees.
Traveling home on the subway at 6
a.m., I had no idea who won the game. It's
probably best that I didn't. At the time, all
1 could think of was how I'd failed, how I
wouldn't see the World Series for the first
time ever.
Most of all, I felt beaten. Culturally
beaten. I had spent six weeks in France
trying not to be American. I wore muted
colors, avoided English when possible, ate
with both hands on the table, drank wine

with meals and read Le Monde on the bus.
It was starting to work. People weren't
treating me like a tourist anymore. I was
fitting in, soaking up the culture from the
inside.
Then, the one day in almost two
months that I wanted to be American, I
couldn't go back. Baseball, one of the cor
nerstones of the culture of my youth,
wasn't there for me.
It upset me at first; in our great infor
mation age, when you can read The New
York Times anywhere in the world, there
are places where you can stay up all night
and still not find the World Series. French
disdain for American culture had won out.
I have since realized that even if the
games didn't make it across the Atlantic,
their importance did.
When word of the sweep finally got
through, I ran through my French univer
sity and told everyone I saw, regardless of
nationality, that my favorite player had
won the World Series for the most storied
team in baseball history. I didn't have to
see a single swing to be proud of Scott
Brosius, proud of my home town, proud of

my culture.
McMinnville wants to throw a party for
its national hero, though his friends say he
doesn't want his homecoming to be a big
deal. I'll miss that, too. But I won't be dis
appointed.
Last week, a kids' game with dirt and
sticks and rules that are impossible to
explain in French reminded me that cul
ture is not something to hide. Unlike Ken
Burns or George Will, I don't revere
baseball as the essence of America. But I
love it because it gives small-town kids
like me — wherever we are — our own
history, our own emotions, our own
heroes.
These are heroes like Scott Brosius, a
man whose autographed picture is hang
ing on my bedroom wall at home. A man
who makes even this die-hard Dodger fan
want, just a little bit, to be a Yankee.

Jim Tankersley, a junior majoring in politi
cal science, is sure that the Great Dodger in
the Sky will punish him for writing this cql
umn, if he can clear French customs.
