## Card takes 2nd place, finishes two back 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's golf team fell just short of winning
the Stanford / PEPSI Women's Intercollegiate golf tourna
ment, on Sunday.
The Cardinal had hoped to repeat last year's victory, but at
the end of the three-day tournament. No. 7 Stanford placed sec
ond with KB7. two strokes behind No. 2 Arizona.
"We played well, but so did Arizona. They just pulled it
through in the end," said sophomore Lauren Robertson, who
played as an individual in the tournament.
During the first two days of the tournament, it looked as if
Stanford was going to win its home tournament for the second
consecutive year. Stanford led over Indiana by five strokes
after Friday, the first day of play.
On Saturday, the rain delayed tee time by four hours, start
ing play at noon and forcing the teams to play in the dark as the
day progressed.
But. even with the poor weather and difficult course condi
tions. Stanford still looked as if it was in position to end up as
champion of the event, once again finishing the day with a five

stroke lead, this time edging out Arizona.
The last day of the tournament was a fateful one for the Car
dinal. Arizona had two players shoot four under par to take the
lead from Stanford and end up triumphant in its own quest for
a trophy.

WOMEN'S GOLF ■
■ Friday-Sunday: No. 7 Stanford finished second at the Stanford
/ PEPSI Women's Intercollegiate golf tournament.

The top-placing individual of the event was also from Ari
zona. Jenna Daniels tied with Washington's Elisha Au to take
first place with a score of 215, four strokes under par.
The top finishers for Stanford were sophomores Stephanie
Keever and Hilary Homeyer, who tied for fifth with a one
under-par score of 21K. Also scoring for Stanford was junior Jae
Jean Ro. tied for 19th, and senior Michelle Sperry, tied for 30th.
Overall, Stanford head coach Caroline O'Connor was
pleased with the results of the tournament.
"We had solid games. [Saturday], the weather led to long
rounds and playing in the dark, but we held it together and

played well as a team," O'Connor said.
There was some concern before the tournament that play
ing at home might make the event seem a bit relaxed, but Stan
ford did not find that a problem.
"There was really no trouble being in the tournament mind
set. There were so many teams here that it felt like any other
tournament," Homeyer said.
Of the 19 teams at the tournament, all of the Pacific-10 Con
ference teams were in attendance. The top three finishers were
all from the Pac-10, with No. 25 Washington placing third with
a score of 899.
Even though the Cardinal did not meet its goal for this tour
nament, its true aspirations come during Memorial Day Week
end in May at the NCAA Championship Tournament in Tulsa,
Okla.
"Our team chemistry is only improving as the season goes
on," Ro said. "We are all fighting for the same goal at the end
of the season — to win NCA As."
"It is a process, a matter of peaking," O'Connor added. "We
want to win Nationals."
Stanford will compete again at the Golf World / Palmetto
Dunes Invitational in Hilton Head. S.C., Nov. 6-8.
