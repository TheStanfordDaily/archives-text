# Just a bit outside
## Bradley and the boys 
### 
Brian Eule

He's been a professional basket
ball player, a U.S. Senator, a
Rhodes Scholar, a teacher, an au
thor, an Olympian and possibly a
candidate for the presidency in 2(KK).
And he credit's the Stanford men's
basketball team as insipiration lor
his latest book.

And yet, I never know what to
call Bill Bradley, this man of many
faces. Senator Bradley? Former
Senator Bradley? Mr. Amazing?
"Just call me Bill." he said when I
first met him and confronted him
with this problem, late last year.
That wouldn't do.
While my friends and I chal
lenged the former NBA Champion
to a game of hoops, we certainly set
tled for the brief question-and-an
swer session he provided for our
dorm. Bradley, then Stanford's
Payne profesor at the Institue for In
ternational Studies, came last year
to discuss politics, basketball, his
new book and life.

And then, he got up and made a
point to shaking each and every per
son's hand.
Yesterday, I got to see Bradley
speak again — this time to the pre
season top-ranked basketball team.
"You made it fun again," he told
the team, recalling getting caught up
in the Cardinal's run to the Final
Four last season.
As Bradley held up his new
book. "Values of the Game", Stan
ford's basketball stars sat attenti
tivelv in the several rows of chairs
lined up inside their locker room.
They were spellbound as the former
senator credited them for inspiring
him while writing the book.
There was. however, a sense of
mutual respect in the room.
Geese fly in a V-shaped forma
tion, the senator explained. The
leader can only take the brunt of the
wind's force for so long, and thus,
the geese rotate at the front position
switching who handles the pressure.
Bradley used this analogy to par
allel Stanford's team during last
year's Final Four game.
The Cardinal was unrelenting, he
said. The three-pointers were con
stant. II Ryan Mendez wasn't hitting
them, then Peter Sauer was. IfSauer
wasn't hitting them, then Art Lee
was. Each stepped up to that front

position, handling the pressure, until
the next came to relieve him.
Otherwise, Stanford's goose
would have been cooked.
(Sorry, but I had to.)
At first glance, the scene in Stan
lord's locker room, yesterday, might
have seemed a hit strange. The na-

tion's most respected and feared bas
ketball team, sitting around a former
NBA star as he shared stories and
showed pictures of Michael Jordan
and Larry Bird from his new book.
But there was nothing condescending
about this scene.
It was a busy man learning to love
the game again.
It was a team with great expecta
tions, listening to a wise one.
And while Bradley didn't make

any mention of writing another book,
he certainly expressed interest at
Stanford making a repeat run to the
Final Four.
"I'll he there if you're there," he
said.
And then, he got up and made a
point to shake each and every per
son's hand.

Sports editor Brian Eule would also
like he at the Final Four this season.
