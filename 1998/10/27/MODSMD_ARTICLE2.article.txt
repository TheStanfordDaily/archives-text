### kimberly Downs 
A group of UC-Berkeley stu
dents calling themselves the
Phoenix Five has claimed responsi
bility for the theft of the Stanford
Tree costume from the Band Shak
in the earlv morning hours of Oct.
17.
The group sent a letter and a pho
tograph of the blindfolded tree to
Cal's newspaper claiming responsi
bility for the theft, which they called
a "crime of opportunity."
They promised to return the
Tree in time for Big Game, but
Berkeley's chancellor, Robert
Berdahl, was not satisfied with this
promise.
In a statement released last night,
he said, "Unfortunately it appears

that Cal students have taken the
Stanford Tree. This is outright theft,
and we will not tolerate it. If the tree
is not returned by midnight
Wednesday Oski [the Cal mascot]
will not appear at Saturday's Cal
football game and will not appear
until the tree is returned."
"We're delighted that the Chan
cellor at Cal is taking it as seriously
as we are at Stanford," said Dean of
Students Marc Wais. " They under
stand the importance of the Tree
and that it could lead to the escala
tion of tension between the two
schools. We want the Tree returned
and want it returned in the condition
it was taken in."
The Phoenix Five claimed in
their letter that they have no inten
tion of harming or otherwise alter

ing the costume. They say they want
to return it safely and do not intend
to destroy it.
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy
had not yet seen the article in The
Daily California!! when called for
comment, and therefore was un
aware of the Phoenix Five. Before
the article appeared, the depart
ment had not come upon any strong
leads.
Capt. Cooper of the Berkeley
Police had seen the article but didn't
know what the department's re
sponse to it would be because the
Stanford Police is heading the inves
tigation.
He said the letter could be used
as evidence only it it could be
proved that the person who stole the
Tree also wrote the letter, and if the

newspaper would release the letter.
He also reiterated that though
the Phoenix Five made light of steal
ing the costume, it was a crime. The
costume's estimated value is $I.(KK).
The theft of the costume wasn't
premeditated, according to the
Phoenix Five. The group claimed in
their letter that they came to Stan
ford Oct. 16 to see if their were any
signs or banners that they could take
hostage. They did not expect to find
the Tree left "unattended in a
locked cage" in the Band Shak. ac
cording to the Daily Californian.
The theft involved an elaborate
burglary, according to Stanford Po
lice.
Members of the group said they
feel that Stanford pales in compari
son to UC-Berkeley. This is what
compelled them to steal the Tree.
"Stanford lacks the three marks
of a superior university," said one
group member. "We feel that diver
sity, spirit and work ethic are what
make Cal a superior university to an
inferior one."
Before members of the Phoenix
Five return the Tree, they plan to
take it on a road trip because, they
claim, the Tree has expressed an in
terest in exploring the world.
The letter, which was "signed" by
the Tree, said, "I am sick of the
Farm. The Phoenix live have intro

duced me to the outside world
where people are different and actu
ally like their school."
On the same night that the cos
tume was stolen, someone wrote
"Bears" in shaving cream on the
bathroom wall of Stanford Tree
Chris Henderson's fraternity house,
Theta Delta Chi. The Phoenix Five
denied any involvement.
Over the weekend, "some Stan
ford students" allegedly wrote
"Stanford" in bleach on the Faculty
Glade on Berkeley's campus, ac
cording to the Daily Californian.
Based on incidents like this, Wais
fears that students may get hurt if
the costume isn't returned soon.
Henderson is releasing a state
ment today in response to the
Phoenix Five letter.
