# Art, music, and a bit of running
## Fifth-year Weldon is keeping busy

If the Stanford men's cross coun
try team can successfully defend its
conference, regional and national ti
tles this year, it will have accom
plished a goal it set over a year ago.
If fifth-year senior Jon Weldon
can continue to contribute to the
No. 1 Cardinal's successes, he will be
accomplishing a goal he didn't even
know he had been working towards
for much of his life.
"I never really considered a na
tional championship in cross coun
try with Stanford," says Weldon.
"My background was more in soc
cer and track."
Weldon, a Thomasville. N.C. na
tive. never even ran cross country
until his senior year in high school.
Up until that point, he had played
soccer year round with a brief hiatus
in the springtime to focus on track.
But perhaps Weldon should
have seen success coming. Growing
up around the track, he watched his
father compete in masters' division
(over 40 years) races, and he won
the first race he ever competed in —
a one mile run in a middle school
track meet.
"I had no idea how 1 would do."
says Weldon. "I just decided to try
and win it. Fortunately, there was

another guy whom 1 had to compete
with and I believe I finally dropped
him during the last lap."
That win set Weldon's career in
motion. After garnering national
recognition for successes on the
track in high school, he decided not
to follow in the footsteps of his fa
ther and older brother, who both
ran for Duke University, but to seek
out a better life on the Farm.
"I guess I was attracted by the
usual — weather, other guys to train
with, a good school," Weldon says.
"I actually thought Stanford was
tame compared to what 1 expected
California to be like. No freaks and
weirdos, hut yes. the weather was
nice."
Though adaptation to college life
presented some tough challenges.
Weldon's' -especially
smooth.
With running, as well as acade
mics, Weldon remarks, "1 eased into
it.
"I was intimidated a little in the
classroom," he says, "but I soon re
alized how to play the game and re
alized that I would not Hunk out."
Weldon easily found his niche at
Stanford, and he has devoted what
little free time he has to the pursuit
of a variety of interests, including a

Fifth-year senior Jon Weldon never expected to be where he is
today. Weldon is a crucial part of Stanford's cross country "Ma
chine."
