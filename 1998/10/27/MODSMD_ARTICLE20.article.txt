# Art, music, and a bit of running
## Fifth-year Weldon is keeping busy 
### Ben Allen Contributing writer 
If the Stanford men's cross coun
try team can successfully defend its
conference, regional and national ti
tles this year, it will have accom
plished a goal it set over a year ago.
If fifth-year senior Jon Weldon
can continue to contribute to the
No. 1 Cardinal's successes, he will be
accomplishing a goal he didn't even
know he had been working towards
for much of his life.
"I never really considered a na
tional championship in cross coun
try with Stanford," says Weldon.
"My background was more in soc
cer and track."
Weldon, a Thomasville. N.C. na
tive. never even ran cross country
until his senior year in high school.
Up until that point, he had played
soccer year round with a brief hiatus
in the springtime to focus on track.
But perhaps Weldon should
have seen success coming. Growing
up around the track, he watched his
father compete in masters' division
(over 40 years) races, and he won
the first race he ever competed in —
a one mile run in a middle school
track meet.
"I had no idea how 1 would do."
says Weldon. "I just decided to try
and win it. Fortunately, there was

another guy whom 1 had to compete
with and I believe I finally dropped
him during the last lap."
That win set Weldon's career in
motion. After garnering national
recognition for successes on the
track in high school, he decided not
to follow in the footsteps of his fa
ther and older brother, who both
ran for Duke University, but to seek
out a better life on the Farm.
"I guess I was attracted by the
usual — weather, other guys to train
with, a good school," Weldon says.
"I actually thought Stanford was
tame compared to what 1 expected
California to be like. No freaks and
weirdos, hut yes. the weather was
nice."
Though adaptation to college life
presented some tough challenges.
Weldon's' -especially
smooth.
With running, as well as acade
mics, Weldon remarks, "1 eased into
it.
"I was intimidated a little in the
classroom," he says, "but I soon re
alized how to play the game and re
alized that I would not Hunk out."
Weldon easily found his niche at
Stanford, and he has devoted what
little free time he has to the pursuit
of a variety of interests, including a

show on Stanford's KZSU radio sta
tion.
"I started out playing industrial,
heavy, dark, stuff," says Weldon,
whose show now features electronic,
ambient and even a little hip-hop
music. "1 think since I've been out
here in California, I've lightened up
and mellowed out a little."
A double major in studio art and
modern thought and literature, Wel
don is no slouch when it comes to the
books, either. He has been a Pacific
10 Conference Academic selection
for the past two years.
He has also incorporated running
into painting, another hobby of Wel
don's, using "images of legs frozen in
contraction as they land, with all the
quad muscles rippling."
With such diverse interests, one
might expect Weldon to easily be
come bogged down in a mire of

obligations and requirements. But
Weldon sees his interests less as
trappings and more as creative out
lets and stress relievers, especially
with the pressures associated with
racing at the collegiate level.
"1 just try to allot myself chunks
of time to do each thing, and that
usually works pretty well," says Wel
don. "The pressure seems to be
spread out. Rather than just having
the pressure of a race, a thesis, a
painting or whatever, 1 always have
something to fall back on."
In the midst of his many interests,
he is probably making his biggest
splash on the Farm with the tool that
helped get him here in the first place
— distance running.
Though he still considers himself
primarily a middle-distance track
runner. Weldon has contributed im
measurably to the success of the
Cardinal cross country team.
After a breakthrough junior sea
son in which he qualified for track's
indoor national meet in the 3,(XM)

meters, Weldon has established
himself as a force to be reckoned
with on the cross country trails.
Cardinal head coach Vin Lanan
na couldn't be happier with Wel
don's progress.
"Jon has developed from a guy
who was a soccer player in high
school to someone who has done a
real good job filling in at different
positions throughout his career,"
says Lananna.
Having competed on a squad that
took home last year's conference,
regional, and national titles, the 22-
year-old has already won this year's
Fresno Invitational individual title
and looks to he a big factor in Stan
ford's title defense runs.
And as such an accomplished se
nior. Weldon has not shrugged off
his responsibility as a team leader.
"There is a maturity factor that
goes into the age," says Weldon.
"But I try to stay away from too
much counseling of the younger
guys. I try to lead by example."
