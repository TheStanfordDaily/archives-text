# First impressions
## Freshman Irvin pulls of a few upsets 
### Sonny Ping Tat 
On paper, it seemed like a clear
cut case.
Playing in her first collegiate
tournament,freshman Marrisa Irvin
wasn't supposed to do too well. In
vited with a wild-card berth in a
prestigious tournament that boasted
18 of the top 20 women's tennis play
ers in the country, Irvin should have
been out in the first round. Fighting
the nerves of playing in her home
town with a doubles partner with
whom she had only played three
sets, in practice, Irvin's chances of
advancinu seemed slim.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
â–  Sunday: Stanford's Marissa Irvin
and Teryn Ashley won the doubles
title at the Riviera Ail-American
Championships.

Good thing for the Cardinal that
tennis isn't played on paper.
Instead of succumbing to the
freshman jitters, Irvin, the top
ranked 18-and-under women's play
er in the country, made an outstand

Ail-American Championship in Pa

Irvin reached the semifinals in
singles play, beating the No. 3 seed
and defending champion Mirela
Vladulescu of Alabama-Birming

throughout high school.
"It was fun to see everyone again,
but it was nerve-wracking," Irvin
said. "I was really nervous at the be

match."
Despite the nervousness, Irvin's
doubles partner, standout junior
Teryn Ashley, said that Irvin "dom
inated her first match."
Irvin and Ashley combined to
win the doubles championship. The
number of top-ranked teams that
the duo left in their wake was im
pressive. Because the two were un
seeded, their bracket was packed
with the toughest teams.
On their march to the finals, the
Cardinal duo defeated both the sec
ond-and-sixth seeded teams in the
tournament. In a tough second
round match, Ashley and Irvin de
feated Amanda Augustus and Amy
Jensen of California, 6-4. 7-5. the
No. 1 seed and defending national
champions.
The final match against No. 2
seed Vanessa Castellano and Mar
rissa Catlin of Georgia was a close
contest, however. Stanford's pair
pulled off the victory. 6-1. 3-6.6-4.
Irvin and Ashley breezed
through the first set with relative
ease and dominated the Georgia
team, losing only one game in the
