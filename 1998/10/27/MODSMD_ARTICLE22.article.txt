# First impressions
## Freshman Irvin pulls of a few upsets 
### Sonny Ping Tat 
On paper, it seemed like a clear
cut case.
Playing in her first collegiate
tournament,freshman Marrisa Irvin
wasn't supposed to do too well. In
vited with a wild-card berth in a
prestigious tournament that boasted
18 of the top 20 women's tennis play
ers in the country, Irvin should have
been out in the first round. Fighting
the nerves of playing in her home
town with a doubles partner with
whom she had only played three
sets, in practice, Irvin's chances of
advancinu seemed slim.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
â–  Sunday: Stanford's Marissa Irvin
and Teryn Ashley won the doubles
title at the Riviera Ail-American
Championships.

Good thing for the Cardinal that
tennis isn't played on paper.
Instead of succumbing to the
freshman jitters, Irvin, the top
ranked 18-and-under women's play
er in the country, made an outstand
ing collegiate debut at the Riviera
Ail-American Championship in Pa
cific Palisades, Calif.
Irvin reached the semifinals in
singles play, beating the No. 3 seed
and defending champion Mirela
Vladulescu of Alabama-Birming
ham, 6-3.6-2. in the second round.
Irvin admitted that she was ner

vous playing in front of her family
and friends on a court she played on
throughout high school.
"It was fun to see everyone again,
but it was nerve-wracking," Irvin
said. "I was really nervous at the be
ginning because I didn't know what
to expect in my first [singles]
match."
Despite the nervousness, Irvin's
doubles partner, standout junior
Teryn Ashley, said that Irvin "dom
inated her first match."
Irvin and Ashley combined to
win the doubles championship. The
number of top-ranked teams that
the duo left in their wake was im
pressive. Because the two were un
seeded, their bracket was packed
with the toughest teams.
On their march to the finals, the
Cardinal duo defeated both the sec
ond-and-sixth seeded teams in the
tournament. In a tough second
round match, Ashley and Irvin de
feated Amanda Augustus and Amy
Jensen of California, 6-4. 7-5. the
No. 1 seed and defending national
champions.
The final match against No. 2
seed Vanessa Castellano and Mar
rissa Catlin of Georgia was a close
contest, however. Stanford's pair
pulled off the victory. 6-1. 3-6.6-4.
Irvin and Ashley breezed
through the first set with relative
ease and dominated the Georgia
team, losing only one game in the
set.
The second set. however, was a
different story.
Castcllano and Catlin seemed to
make adjustments and step up their
play. At the same time, Irvin and
Ashley began to make mental er
rors.
"I think basically we tuned out

for a set and a half," Ashley said.
"We made basic errors that we
didn't make in the first set."
Irvin agreed, saying that small
things caused them to lose the sec
ond set.
"It wasn't that we were overcon
fident (going into the second set],"
Irvin said. "We just didn't capitalize
on a few points and respond well
enough to how they were playing."
The turning point came late in the
match with the ('ardinal down 2-4, in

the third set at game point.
Georgia went for a winner that
landed out by inches, allowing Irvin
and Ashley a chance to break back
and eventually make it 3-4, instead
of 2-5.
Despite the obvious chemistry
and winning their first tournament
together, Ashley thinks she and
Irvin have not reached their full po
tential.
"We didn't play close to perfect,"
Ashley said. "We can still improve,"
