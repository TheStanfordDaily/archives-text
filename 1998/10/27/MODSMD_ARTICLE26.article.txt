One of Stanford's newest stu
dent-produced literary journals.
Masque magazine, received the
title "Best New Publication of the
Year" by the Vice Versa National
Press Awards, which honors excep
tional achievement in gay and les
bian press.
The ceremony took place Oct. 1
at the National Lesbian and Gay
Journalistic Association's annual
convention in Las Vegas, Nev.
Judged by journalists, writers
and journalism professors, Masque
was one of 80 publications partic
ipating in this year's competition.
The high level of professionalism
obtained by a student-produced

magazine especially impressed the
judges.
Masque's staff consists of full
time students who together pro
duce the magazine.
They gather art and literature
submissions, write their own sto
ries, design the layouts and com
plete digital and print production.
"It's been so exciting to watch
this magazine grow to encompass
new ideas and talents from the
Stanford community. The staff it
self feels like a community and has
learned to work together cohesive
ly," explained Jenny Assef, a se
nior.
Masque was first published last
year as a response to a series of in
cidents targeting homosexuals on

Stanford's campus. One University
student was charged with vandal
ism for painting anti-gay graffiti at
The Bollard eating club.
Masque, funded in part by an
ASSU special fee, is now published
three times a year, giving students
active in the lesbian, gay and bisex
ual community a means of artistic
expression.
It was first intended to be a small
campus production, but is now sold
in bookstores across the United
States.
The president of the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center advisory board. Kathy Veit,
acknowledges the diversity pre
sented by Masque magazine.
"Indeed, I have never seen a

project at Stanford — in the queer
community or outside it — that has
succeeded in bringing together
such a range of students to achieve
such a fruitful end," she said.
Co-editors-in-chief Larry C'hu, a
student in the Medical School, and
Jessica DuLong. a senior, have
both witnessed the growth of
Masque since its first issue.
The two explained in an e-mail,
"The success of Masque under
scores the depth and creative spirit
of the queer community and chal
lenges the superficial representa
tion of queer culture portrayed by
mainstream media."
