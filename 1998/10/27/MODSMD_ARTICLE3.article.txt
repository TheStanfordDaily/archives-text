# Overseas Studies expands frontiers

In 1958, Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program began with a pro
gram in Beutelsbach, outside of
Stuttgart, Germany. Since then, the
program has grown to include 515
students at eight different centers.
" The program has grown and
changed enormously across four
decades, but it remains a central piece
at Stanford undergraduate educa
tion," Overseas Studies Director
Russell Berman said. Indeed, the
program is now considering a poten
tial ninth program in Beijing, China.
Numbers continue to grow
Applications for Overseas Studies
have increased over the past five
years. In 1992, 418 students were ac
cepted into the programs abroad.

Five years later, for the 1997-98 pro
grams, 515 students participated.
Berman explained that much of
the growth "can be attributed to
three locations: the increased de
mand in the Florence program, the
addition of the Puebla program, and
the expansion of the Santiago pro
gram."
A further increase in the number
of applicants is expected with new ex
pansions in the Puebla and Santiago
programs that will hopefully include
opportunities for study in Buenos
Aires. Argentina.
A Beijing program will lure stu
dents as well. Berman has been con
sulting with a Beijing University, and
Overseas Studies hopes to open a
center there within the next year.
