# Overseas Studies expands frontiers
## 
### Sylvia Lin 
In 1958, Stanford's Overseas
Studies Program began with a pro
gram in Beutelsbach, outside of
Stuttgart, Germany. Since then, the
program has grown to include 515
students at eight different centers.
" The program has grown and
changed enormously across four
decades, but it remains a central piece
at Stanford undergraduate educa
tion," Overseas Studies Director
Russell Berman said. Indeed, the
program is now considering a poten
tial ninth program in Beijing, China.
Numbers continue to grow
Applications for Overseas Studies
have increased over the past five
years. In 1992, 418 students were ac
cepted into the programs abroad.

Five years later, for the 1997-98 pro
grams, 515 students participated.
Berman explained that much of
the growth "can be attributed to
three locations: the increased de
mand in the Florence program, the
addition of the Puebla program, and
the expansion of the Santiago pro
gram."
A further increase in the number
of applicants is expected with new ex
pansions in the Puebla and Santiago
programs that will hopefully include
opportunities for study in Buenos
Aires. Argentina.
A Beijing program will lure stu
dents as well. Berman has been con
sulting with a Beijing University, and
Overseas Studies hopes to open a
center there within the next year.
A short stay
Most of the Overseas Studies pro
gram directors advise students to
spend more than one quarter abroad,
hut most students only spend one
quarter overseas.
"There are too many required
classes that have to be taken here at
Stanford, especially for engineering
and economics classes," said sopho
more Leslie Ikemoto.
Most students echo Ikemoto's re
sponse. But Berman would prefer
that students study abroad for more
than one quarter, to learn about the
"local culture, and perhaps pursue in
dependent projects."
He added that "the arrival of a
contingent of fresh students, largely
with lower language skills than those
who have already spent three months
on site, tends to dilute the experi
ence."
Due to this impact on its academ
ic mission, Overseas Studies is con
sidering revising some of the require
ments for students who arrive in the
winter quarter.
Technology, Research and Lan
guage
Chief among Overseas Studies'
new advancements are new pro
grams in technology, research oppor

tunities and language facilities.
The program is increasing its
number of computer and network fa
cilities at the program centers and of
fering home campus courses on line,
such as Engineering^).
This advancement may help rem
edy student worries about time and
schedule constraints. Next year, the
program plans multi-site courses, in
which students at several sites can
join in an online discussion, overseen
by a faculty member.
Berman noted that this year,
funds allocated by Ramon Saldivar,
vice provost for undergraduate edu
cation, have allowed the Overseas
Studies Program to support student
research projects. But these grants
are only automatically available to
students who have been overseas for
two or more quarters.
Students must also have support
from a home-campus member of the
Academic Council to conduct re
search.
Developing and improving lan
guage skills is clearly another "crucial
component" at overseas campuses.
Therefore, the program has devel
oped new methods for preparing stu
dents.
For instance, at the Florence pro
gram, language classes have been dis
carded. Students now work with a
language resource tutor, and take
topical courses offered in Italian.
This improvement not only frees

up units that were normally dedicat
ed to language classes, but also allows
students to actively delve into the lan
guage.
The Berlin, Paris, Puebla and San
tiago programs will soon implement
this new language method.
Programs return and upgrade
This fall. Overseas Studies sus
pended the program in Moscow due
to economic instability in Russia.
Berman has made it pointedly clear,
however, that students should not
rule out the Moscow program per
manently.
"Nothing is certain, but we hope
that we can continue soon â€” perhaps
at the end of this year or in autumn of
'99."
In Berlin, along with the imple
mentation of the new language re
source tutor program, the program
has begun a Language Partner Pro
gram that allows students to have na
tive Berliners as language partners.
"It's a bit like having a good pen
pal, except that you meet and talk in
Berlin cafes and pubs instead of trad
ing e-mails," said Karen Kramer,
program director.
Kramer also eagerly anticipates
the move of the German capital to
Berlin next year. She believes that
this move will have a "big impact on
research and internship opportuni
ties, and will be a rich resource, par
ticularly for students in international

re! itions. economics, history, politi
cal science and public policy."
Students are also looking forward
to the Berlin program's expansion.
"Everyone always raves about the
Berlin program, and with the capital
moving to Berlin next year, I'm real
ly looking forward to having a chance
at an internship in hopes of exploring
this issue further," said Joy Hsu, a
sophomore who plans to study in
Berlin next year.
The movement of the capital will
add to Berlin's extensive Cultural
Enrichment Program, which in
cludes tickets to the Berlin Philhar
monic, operas, the Berlin film festival
and trips to top restaurants.
Kramer is also looking forward to
intensifying joint-seminar arrange
ments with Berlin universities. In the
seminars, visiting professors from
Stanford have taught a mixed group
of Stanford and German students,
which not only provides a "great way
for our students to meet German stu
dents, it also makes for a rich variety
of perspectives in the discussions."
Terry MacDougall, director of the
Kyoto program, is also looking to
ward a new year of additions.
MacDougall is adding guest
speakers, including more people
from the Japanese government and
business, new courses to be taught by
Kyoto University engineering faculty
professors and further opportunities
for internship placements.
