# B-Factory collider dedicated at SLAC

Confirming that matter matters,
U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill
Richardson dedicated the new B-
Factory particle collider at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center in a
ceremony yesterday.
The dedication marked the com
pletion of a $3(X) million Department
of Energy project that will allow sci
entists "to delve into the deepest mys
teries of matter and antimatter in the
universe," according to Richardson.
Richardson called the completion
of the B-Factory "a victory for sci

ence, a victory for partnership and
collaboration and a victory for knowl
edge and understanding," and he
conveyed President Clinton's "sin
cere and profound gratitude" to the
scientists working on the project.
The B-Factory collider acceler
ates two particle beams to nearly the
speed of light and then forces the two
beams to cross. At the point where
the beams cross, particles collide and,
in tiny bursts of energy, produce new
particles called B-mesons.
The B-mesons will help scientists
learn why the universe contains more
matter than antimatter, which is the

ultimate goal of the collider. Accord
ing to SLAC scientist Ewan Paterson,
"A weak force causes the difference
in the decay rates of matter and anti
matter, and the B-factory will help to
study that force."
Richardson also praised the coop
eration behind the project, which was
a collaboration of SLAC and the
Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratories. In
addition to the three Bay Area DOE
labs, the project also received contri
butions from scientists from Canada,
England, France, Germany, Italy,
Norway, Russia and China.

According to David Treacy, a pro
ject manager at SLAC for the De
partment of Energy, the B-Factory
project had additional aims beyond
the basic scientific goals. Scientists
developed new manufacturing tech
nologies during the colliders con
struction. For example, the creation
of a new welding technique con
tributed to building the collider's
components.
Treacy said that "A big part of
what this project is all about is educa
tion. We have hundreds of post-doc
toral fellows from the University
working and doing research here."
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo. whose
14th District includes Stanford, and
Provost Condoleezza Rice also spoke
at the dedication.
Eshoo, one of the legislators who
pushed the Clinton administration
for approval of the project proposal
in 1993, said, "I always had confi
dence in the merits of the case." She
called the new collider a homage to
"the genius of America."
Meanwhile, Rice praised the pro
ject scientists, saying their "faith in
humankind and faith in the desire to
know is a monument to great re
search universities like this one."
The project got underway in ()ct.,
1993, when President Clinton an
nounced that the B-Factory would be
built at Stanford.
At yesterday's ceremony. B-Fac
tory Project Director Jonathan Dor
fan announced that the project had
been completed on time and under
budget.
The first particle collisions in the
B-Factory occurred this summer, and
the full-scale physics experiments are
scheduled to begin in spring of next
year.
