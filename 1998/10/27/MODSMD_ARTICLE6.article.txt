Lagunita ( 'ourt is still having its
share of problems that accompany
all dorm renovations.
Although a number of details
are still incomplete and the new
dining service is well behind sched
ule. many students think that any
hassle in the short run is more than
offset by the benefits they will see
in the long run.

'They seem to be sparing
no expense. I've really
noticed them going all out.'

Lagunita ('ourt. an undergradu
ate dormitory built in 1933. is being
renovated under the Capital Im
provement Project, a 15-year plan
begun in 1993 to renovate all
dorms.
In mid-October, Housing and
Dining Services Director Keith
Ciuv said. "The housing had to be

renovating the residences, areas
still need improvement.

Assoc. Director of Student

thinks the kitchenettes will be
ready by the end of October. He
said there was a problem with the
front door shutting completely, but
that the problem will soon be
solved.
"I don't want anyone to think
the door will sta\ that way. Ii is bet

"When doing .1 project of this
si/e 111 two months, the downside is
that you have some punch list'
items, items that may linger after
the project ends, he said. "I think
people are on top of these."
Renovations to the interior ol
