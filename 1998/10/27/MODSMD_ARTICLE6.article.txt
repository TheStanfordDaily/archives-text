## Lag living spaces still unfinished

Lagunita ( 'ourt is still having its
share of problems that accompany
all dorm renovations.
Although a number of details
are still incomplete and the new
dining service is well behind sched
ule. many students think that any
hassle in the short run is more than
offset by the benefits they will see
in the long run.

'They seem to be sparing
no expense. I've really
noticed them going all out.'
â€”lan Hill

Lagunita ('ourt. an undergradu
ate dormitory built in 1933. is being
renovated under the Capital Im
provement Project, a 15-year plan
begun in 1993 to renovate all
dorms.
In mid-October, Housing and
Dining Services Director Keith
Ciuv said. "The housing had to be
done before the school year started
so students could move in.the tim
ing facility was set aside so that 11 he
contractors! could finish [the resi
dences! on time."
While priority was placed on
renovating the residences, areas
still need improvement.

The kitchenettes are still unus
able. The kitchenettes' sinks are
not working and stoves are not vet
hooked up.
In addition, the carpet on the
small inner stairwells was torn up
but never replaced. I lie front door
is out of order, and residents can
only use theii ke\ sin the side door.
Assoc. Director of Student
Housing Rodgei Whitney said he
thinks the kitchenettes will be
ready by the end of October. He
said there was a problem with the
front door shutting completely, but
that the problem will soon be
solved.
"I don't want anyone to think
the door will sta\ that way. Ii is bet
tei to keep it shut than to compro
mise securih." said Whitney.
"When doing .1 project of this
si/e 111 two months, the downside is
that you have some punch list'
items, items that may linger after
the project ends, he said. "I think
people are on top of these."
Renovations to the interior ol
Lagunita include repainted hall
ways. new wall-to-wall carpeting 111
the rooms and hallways, bulletin
boards alongside the room's doors,
new furniture in rooms and lobbies
and new curtains 111 rooms
" They seem to be sparing no ex
pense, said sophomore lan Hill,
who lives in Eucalipto. "I've really
noticed them going all out."
Freshman Melissa Valentine, a
resident in Eucalipto, said, " The
renovations are really positive. The
rooms look really nice. No com
plaints with my room."
The dining services in Lagunita
are not yet ready for use. They may
not be finished until Nov. 20, or
later, according to Guy.
Because the kitchen and servery
are not yet finished, on weekends
residents go to another dormitory
to eat.
The kitchen was first closed to
residents last spring, and the com
pletion date has since been pushed
back twice.

Rick Stephenson, a senior in La
gunita Court, said. "Now they're
saying that the kitchen and dining
facilities will be ready for winter
quarter, but I'm skeptical."
Other students mentioned the
construction noise.
Hill said, i may be the worst af
fected by renovations because my
room is right next to the construc
tion crew. I get to hear the genera
tor, and the crew hammering and
talking. Daily I experience the pain
of renovation, but I still think its for
the best. 1 would much rather lose a
couple hours' sleep now."
Overall, however, students
seem pleased.
"I love the renovations," said
Hill." I think the renovations are
great. The dorms last year were
run-down, dreary, and decrepit.
Now. they are new. clean, and
bright."
