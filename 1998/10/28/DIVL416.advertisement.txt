Beagle II
Thanks to a special alumni gift, the Program in
Human Biology is pleased to offer a unique opportu
nity for the summer of 1998, open to Stanford stu
dents of all years and majors. A grant called "Beagle
II" will be awarded to the best proposals for a sum
mer's voyage of scientific discovery somewhere in
the world. Applications are now available in the
Human Biology Office (Bldg 80), and will be due on Wednesday, Dec. 2 (awards to be announced
Monday, Jan 11, 1999). The applications ask for a proposed itinerary of travel (it need not be by
ship) and study, together with a statement of the ways in which a self-styled Beagle "voyage"
would contribute to his/her undergraduate science education. Applications will be screened by an
interdisciplinary committee. The Beagle 11 grant provides a total of $3500 that can be used toward
travel and study costs, plus summer earnings offset.
Questions not addressed by the application packet can be directed to Lia Cacciari,
Student Services Assistant, Bldg 80, cacciari@LELAND.
A Beagle II informational meeting will be held on Wednesday afternoon,
November 4, at 4:00 p.m. in Room 320-105 of the Quad.
The meeting will include a brief introduction to the goals of the Beagle II program, as well as pre
sentations by last year's Beagle II awardees. Students considering applying for a Beagle II grant
this fall are especially encouraged to attend.
