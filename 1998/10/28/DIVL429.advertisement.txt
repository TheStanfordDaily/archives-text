For The Best Of Us
+ Exclusive Integrated Flight Training System:
Relax. Learning to fly just got a lot easier. And fun. At the Stanford Flying Club, you won't need to
sit through bonng classes or wade through mountains of manuals. Instead you'll discover our new
exclusive, interactive Private Pilot Multi-Media Training System. It offers interactive graphics, self
diagnostic quizzes, and can help you to visualize flying maneuvers. It bndges the gap between
theory and hands on experience. Students using the Cessna integrated flight training system in
conjunction with actual in-flight training and a Personal Instructor-Pilot, have typically earned their
wings with up to 26% fewer hours than the national average, and with correspondingly lower costs.
+ Highest Success Rate: Our percentage of Members actually completing a Pilot's License is
significantly higher than elsewhere And as an FAA Test Center, we found that 100% of our 1998
graduates passed their FAA Pilot's License Knowledge Test on the first try.
+ Affordable Rates: Two-Seat aircraft start at j49/hr and Four-Seat Cessna aircraft start at
559/ hr, ind. fuel. Aircraft elsewhere typically cost 15% to 30% more.
+ Join us to learn to Fly: Find out how fun, convenient and affordable getting your Pilot's
License can be these days! Call us for more information, to borrow a Demo CD, or to try a test flight!
