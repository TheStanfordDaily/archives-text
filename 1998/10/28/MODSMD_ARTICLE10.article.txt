## Muslim students reflect on prayer

He puts on a pair of flip-flops and
walks out onto the balcony outside
Room 19 of the Old Union Club
house. With his back to White Plaza
and facing Mecca, Makin Abdul-
Halik cups his hands around his
mouth and begins a hauntingly
melodic call.
Five times a day, Abdul-Malik, a
doctoral student in linguistics, or an
other of his fellow practitioners of
Islam, makes this call to prayer. Reg
ular prayer, or Salai, comprises one
of the Five Pillars of the religion.
Muslims believe that this ritual rein
forces their commitment to (iod and
the general practices of Islam.
Most Muslims know how to do
the call to prayer, or adhan. Abdul-
Halik, who began regularly making
the adhan at Stanford in July, is the
one who calls most regularly, al
though other members of the com
munity call as well. Abdul-Malik
said that he had no special training
to prepare him for making the calls.
"You hear it so often you just
know it,"he said.
Previously, members of the Is
lamic Society of Stanford held two
daytime prayers. Now, all five of the
required prayers are done daily, in
correspondence with the movement
of the sun: at dawn, noon, afternoon,
sunset and evening. While many
non-Muslims might consider this
frequency inhibiting, faithful partici
pants do not find fitting Stanford life
around prayer times too difficult.
"The prayer time is short — it's
always easy to find five minutes,"
said Hossam Fahmy, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering.
Abdul-Halik agreed, "Once I
had a class that completely covered
the window for a prayer time, but
the instructor was understanding,"

and allowed him to leave during the
middle of class and return after pray
ing.
However, in some instances
prayer times can be daunting. The
Fajr, or dawn prayer, takes place at
5:40 a.m.
Therefore the morning call to
prayer includes the line, "Prayer is
better than sleep," providing greater
incentive to get up at the early hour.
The call itself differs in various
countries. For instance, an adhan in
Iran will not be the same as one in
Lebanon. In all of these countries,
the caller faces Mecca, the religious
center of Islam which is in Saudi
Arabia. In this direction, called the
qibla, Abdul-Halik calls for Muslims
to "come to prayer" and "come to
success."
Although attendance at the
prayer sessions vary, the greatest
number of people attend the Zhuhr,
or noon prayer.
Anywhere between 50 and KM)
people may come to the Bechtel In
ternational Center on Fridays at
12:30 p.m. The largest Islamic Soci
ety meetings take place on Fridays,
which is the Islamic holy day.
"( hristians have Sunday [as their
holy day), the Jewish have Saturday.
For us it's Friday," says Fahmy.
Muslims of the Stanford commu
nity have long maintained their
practice of daily prayer.
The Islamic Society was estab
lished in 1958 by a student named
Marghoub Quraishi with the pur
pose of serving "the spiritual needs
of the Muslim students on campus."
Of course, anyone walking by
White Plaza or Old Union may hear
the calls to prayer every day, not
only Muslim students.
"Sometimes classmates or pro
fessors will say to me, 'Oh, I heard
you praying,' " Abdul-Halik said.
