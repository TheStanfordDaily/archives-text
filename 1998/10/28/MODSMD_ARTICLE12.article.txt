# New electronic resources abound
## Library services, materials keep pace with technological chang

Your library is changing. The
books are still there, the South Mez
zanine is still scary and you still have
to be quiet, but the nature of library
science is slowly becoming more
elaborate and electronic.
The main reason, as with many in
formation issues today, is the World
Wide Web. Electronic databases and
filing systems have been a part of uni
versity and civic libraries for over fif
teen years, but over the past two
years, the Web has taken on new im
portance in organizing and deliver
ing information.
Databases of specialized informa
tion previously only available
through cumbersome interfaces or
acquired CD-ROMs have been
pushed on to the Web in an effort to
improve accessibility and user

friendliness.
The most obvious example is
Socrates. The online catalog of Stan
ford libraries, once relegated to tel
net access, has been available since
1997 on the Web with enhanced fea
tures. Users now can request more
complicated searches, using a more
user-friendly interface. The Stanford
Bookstore database, periodical cita
tions and Lexis-Nexis are all now
available on the Web.
Along with telnet-based services,
CD-ROMs are being replaced as the
means to access specialized databas
es.
According to Paul Lomio, assis
tant director for information services
at Crown Law Library, "There's
been a hyperspace leap from CD
ROM to Web services. CD-ROMs
are a bit of a nuisance. The things are
so small you can lose them. The Web
is always there and there are multiple

access points. We've basically jetti
soned CD-ROM databases as a mat
ter of policy. We won't acquire data
bases on CD-ROM. only those that
are accessible through the Web."
Previously, specialized databases
such as Westlaw, Lexis-Nexis or
Medline would only be available on
machines specifically dedicated for
CD-ROM use. Now professors, doc
tors and students can use them from
home.
Chris Stave, an information ser
vices librarian at Lane Medical Li
brary adds that the electronic ser
vices that provide full-text are often
more reliable than paper journals or
books.
"You don't have to worry about a
journal issue being missing because it
was lost or stolen or it's at the
bindery. It will always be there,"
Stave said.
He said that "It's interesting

watching people deal with electronic
journals and books. People connect
with the information they're looking
for and they don't even read it, they
just hit print. But 1 have to say that
electronic journals offer things that
their print counterparts don't have,
like links to the full text of a citation."
One major online journal
provider is Stanford's own High
Wire Press, which has Web-based
versions of over 50 scientific jour
nals.
"1 would say that the majority of
folks do not necessarily know every
thing that's available to them," Stave
said. People don't know how to
search in a sophisticated manner. It's
more than just a few keywords. A big
part of our job [as librarians] is edu
cation and knowing more effective
ways of searching."
