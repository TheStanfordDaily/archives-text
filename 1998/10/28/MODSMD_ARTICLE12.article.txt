# New electronic resources abound
## Library services, materials keep pace with technological chang

Your library is changing. The
books are still there, the South Mez
zanine is still scary and you still have
to be quiet, but the nature of library
science is slowly becoming more
elaborate and electronic.
The main reason, as with many in
formation issues today, is the World
Wide Web. Electronic databases and
filing systems have been a part of uni
versity and civic libraries for over fif
teen years, but over the past two
years, the Web has taken on new im
portance in organizing and deliver
ing information.
Databases of specialized informa
tion previously only available
through cumbersome interfaces or
acquired CD-ROMs have been
pushed on to the Web in an effort to
improve accessibility and user

friendliness.
The most obvious example is
Socrates. The online catalog of Stan
ford libraries, once relegated to tel
net access, has been available since
1997 on the Web with enhanced fea
tures. Users now can request more
complicated searches, using a more
user-friendly interface. The Stanford
Bookstore database, periodical cita
tions and Lexis-Nexis are all now
available on the Web.
Along with telnet-based services,
CD-ROMs are being replaced as the
means to access specialized databas
es.
According to Paul Lomio, assis
tant director for information services
at Crown Law Library, "There's
been a hyperspace leap from CD
ROM to Web services. CD-ROMs
are a bit of a nuisance. The things are
so small you can lose them. The Web
is always there and there are multiple

access points. We've basically jetti
soned CD-ROM databases as a mat
ter of policy. We won't acquire data
bases on CD-ROM. only those that
are accessible through the Web."
Previously, specialized databases
such as Westlaw, Lexis-Nexis or
Medline would only be available on
machines specifically dedicated for
CD-ROM use. Now professors, doc
tors and students can use them from
home.
Chris Stave, an information ser
vices librarian at Lane Medical Li
brary adds that the electronic ser
vices that provide full-text are often
more reliable than paper journals or
books.
"You don't have to worry about a
journal issue being missing because it
was lost or stolen or it's at the
bindery. It will always be there,"
Stave said.
He said that "It's interesting

watching people deal with electronic
journals and books. People connect
with the information they're looking
for and they don't even read it, they
just hit print. But 1 have to say that
electronic journals offer things that
their print counterparts don't have,
like links to the full text of a citation."
One major online journal
provider is Stanford's own High
Wire Press, which has Web-based
versions of over 50 scientific jour
nals.
"1 would say that the majority of
folks do not necessarily know every
thing that's available to them," Stave
said. People don't know how to
search in a sophisticated manner. It's
more than just a few keywords. A big
part of our job [as librarians] is edu
cation and knowing more effective
ways of searching."
Lomio said that he believes con
temporary researchers are computer
savvy. "Traditional research skills
may he what they need instruction
on. Not everything is available on
line."
"Medical students are infinitely
more sophisticated about searching
Web databases than students com
ing in even two years ago," said
Stave. "There's a real change in
knowledge. The other day I was in a
class talking about electronic full
text databases and one student was
incensed because something was on
line but he couldn't get the PDF ver

sion. Two years ago very few people
would know what PDF was." PDF is
a doeument file format.
According to Lomio and Stave,
the Stanford library system hopes
that tutorials and classes will help
students understand the range of re
sources Stanford offers. Those re
sources are often described as
among the best perks of a Stanford
education.
At the present time, fees for on
line databases, full-text resources
and other information services are
generally paid for out of collections
budgets.
"We haven't spent that much
money on full-text resources yet, al
though they are very expensive,"
said Valerie Su, deputy director of

Lane Medical Library. We'll try our
best to provide the right resources
for our users. People still are using
print as well as the electronic. We'll
continue buying licenses as long as
we can, with the support of the ad
ministration."
In the early days of the Web, five
long years ago, an electronic library
probably had the text of Whitman's
"Leaves of Grass" and an old edition
of "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations."
Today, nearly every type of re
source, citation and reference is in
some way accessible through the
Web. There is, and always will be, a
need for bookshelves, printed mat
ter and study carrels, but more and
more, the library you need will be in
your desktop computer.
