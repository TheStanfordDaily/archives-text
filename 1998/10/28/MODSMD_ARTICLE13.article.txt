## Consumers cautious amid economic turmoil 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Consumer confi
dence has fallen to its lowest level in nearly
two amid the economic turmoil spread
ing around the globe.
The Conference Board reported Tuesday
that its index of consumer confidence fell 9.1
points to 117.3 in October. The last time it was
lower was in December 1996.
The decline was the fourth straight month
of retreat and was much larger than Wall
Street analysts expected. The index now is
down 20.9 points from its 29-year high in June.
Consumer sentiment is an important eco
nomic indicator since consumer spending
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's eco
nomic activity.
With the Christmas season just getting
under way, the decline in confidence may
mean trouble for the nation's retailers.
Department stores make nearly half their
profits in the last three months of the year.
"Growing anxiety about the financial mar
kets, combined with political concerns and
recent layoff announcements, have given con
sumers the jitters," said Lynn Franco, associ
ate director at the Conference Board, a busi
ness-financed private research group.

The report comes amid increasing evidence
that the U.S. economy is slowing because of
the financial crisis in Asia and Russia.
Stocks fell Tuesday, with the Dow Jones
average dropping 71.32 to 8,360.89 in late
afternoon trading. That's nearly 6 percent
above where it began the year but 10 percent
below its record high of 9,337.97, reached July
17.
The index that measures consumers' expec
tations for the next six months dropped 10.2
points to 86.6.
Fewer Americans said they would buy a
home or major appliance or were planning a
vacation. Many consumers said they expect
business conditions to worsen, meaning fewer
jobs and lower paychecks.
There's already evidence that consumers
are turning cautious. A survey released Tues
day by the International Mass Retail Associa
tion found 1,003 respondents planned to spend
$828 on holiday gifts this year, up a slim 1.8
percent from their expectations for Christmas
1997.
Anticipating a tough holiday season, many
merchants are issuing conservative sales esti
mates for Christmas.
