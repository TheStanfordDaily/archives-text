# Germany gets new chancellor

BONN, Germany (AP) — An upbeat Gerhard Schroeder
took power Tuesday as Germany's seventh postwar chancellor,
ushering in an era of political change in Europe's largest nation
after 16 years of conservative rule under Helmut Kohl.
The handover represents the most dramatic political transi
tion Germany has experienced in a generation. Kohl's conserva
tive politics defined by childhood memories of World War II
now shifts to Schroeder's more liberal world view of a generation
born too late in the war to feel personal burdens.
The two men stood side by side as Kohl turned over the office
to Schroeder; one clearly saddened by the changes, reminding his
successor of the "great responsibility" he will have, the other
cheerful and forward-looking.
"Mr. Chancellor, I wish you good fortune," Kohl said, blink
ing back tears.
"You are facing challenges completely different than those 1
faced when 1 took office 16 years ago," Kohl told Schroeder.
"You would do well not to become a cynic."
Schroeder's Social Democratic-led government promises to
bring political change to Germany, aiming to restore a sense
among average Germans that the government is attentive to
their welfare. Its chief goals outlined in a coalition agreement
with the junior governing partner, the Greens, are to put Ger
mans back to work, to recognize more foreigners living in Ger
many as citizens and to abandon nuclear power.
But as Schroeder leads Germany into the 21st century, he also
will oversee two key transitions that Kohl set in motion: the gov
ernment's move to Berlin and the adoption of the single Euro
pean currency to replace the German mark.
The symbolic importance of the government's return to the
prewar capital historically linked to Nazi Germany and the Prus
sian military state weighed on Kohl. He cautioned Schroeder
that one of his biggest challenges will be "taking to Berlin what
has flourished in Bonn."
Schroeder already has suggested bumping his move up to
April, signaling his eagerness to put his own stamp on govern
ment and to inaugurate the so-called Berlin Republic — a mod
ern Germany governed by a generation less burdened by the
war. But he made no broad policy statements during a day of cer
emonies that confirmed him as head of government. He was sav
ing that for an inaugural speech in two weeks.
Schroeder's pro-market reputation helped him win centrist
voters who previously mistrusted the left. But since his triumph

in the Sept. 27 election, he has stressed his party's plans to
strengthen the social welfare state, and his commitment to the
free market was called into question after a computer
entrepreneur he tapped as a Cabinet member backed out.
Germans are not all that sure who is in charge: Schroeder
himself, or the powerful party chief, Oskar Lafontaine, who rep
resents traditional leftist values. In a survey released Tuesday,
about 43 percent of 1,003 Germans questioned in a poll said they
believe Lafontaine, who also is the new finance minister, will be
making decisions alongside Schroeder.
But in a day that marked his triumph, Schroeder savored
every moment. As the parliament president announced his elec
tion by the new parliament with a vote of 351-287 with 27 absten
tions, he smiled slowly and stood to embrace Lafontaine.
Throughout the day, Schroeder emphasized the importance
of political change for a democracy — while recognizing that
Germans have seen little of it in the last 50 years. Schroeder is
only the third Social Democrat of just seven postwar chancel
lors.
