JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) â€” The ruling African National
Congress criticized a leaked report by the
commission investigating apartheid's hor
rors, saying Tuesday that accusations it
violated human rights to topple the white
regime were "baseless."
The Truth and Reconciliation Com
mission's report is to be formally deliv
ered Thursday to President Nelson Man
dela, the ANC leader, culminating more
than two years of nationwide hearings.
The report accuses the ANC of com
mitting human rights violations by plant
ing mines in rural areas, executing enemy

agents and blurring the line between mil
itary and civilian targets, according to
findings leaked to the media Monday.
ANC Secretary-General Kgalema
Motlanthe called the accusations "base
less" and said they contained "glaring
inaccuracies."
The Truth Commission's report is
expected to lay most of the blame for
human rights violations on the white
apartheid government and its security
forces. The commission also reportedly
will declare apartheid a crime against
humanity and acknowledge the ANC's
fight against the former apartheid state

was legitimate.
Meanwhile, lawyers for former Presi
dent F.W. de Klerk were to go to court
Wednesday to try to prevent the commis
sion's report from implicating him in
apartheid crimes, a spokesman said.
The finding could pave the way for de
Klerk's prosecution because he did not
seek amnesty in connection with the
bombings of buildings that housed anti
apartheid groups.
The commission can grant amnesty to
those who fully confess to politically
motivated crimes committed during
apartheid.
