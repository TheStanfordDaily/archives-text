# Protest thwarted in China
## 
### 
BEIJING (A P) —Police
detained one of China's most
prominent democracy activists and
at least four other dissidents Tues
day to thwart a planned protest.
Police took Xu Wenli from his
Beijing home, questioned him
about his planned trip Tuesday to
eastern Shandong province and
released him 10 hours later, Xu
said. He said he and as many as 30
other dissidents had planned to go
to Shandong's Dongpin county, 280
miles south of Beijing, to support
Xie Wanjun, an activist they say has
been harassed by authorities.
A Hong Kong-based rights
group said four other dissidents
were detained Tuesday in Beijing
and elsewhere, and that police also
questioned nearly 20 others who
had planned to go to Shandong.
Xu's wife. He Xintong, said
police detained Xu's associate,

Zhang Hui, and searched Xu's
home, confiscating a fax machine,
papers, magazines and photos.
Zhou Guoqiang, another dissi
dent who had planned to go to
Shandong, said he also was
detained, questioned and released
after 12 hours. Xu said dissident
Wang Zhixin also was detained and
released.
"This is their real face," said
Xu's wife. "The Communist Party
says one thing but does another."
A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman. Tang Guoqiang, said
he was unaware of the detentions.
But he said China signed the U.N.
pact to safeguard citizens' rights
and remains determined to do so.
The Hong Kong-based Informa
tion Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement said that in
all, about 40 dissidents were
detained or questioned in the past

three days.
Xie was detained last month and
held for 15 days for attempting to
file an application with the authori
ties to set up an opposition group,
the China Democracy Party.
Since July, dissidents have tried
to register branches of the party in
at least nine provinces and major
cities, challenging a 49-year ban on
virtually all organized opposition to
the ruling Communist Party.
Authorities have rejected all the
applications.
With many other dissidents in
exile, Xu, 56, is one of the most
prominent democracy campaigners
left in China.
His activism dates to the Democ
racy Wall protest movement of the
late 19705. Xu was arrested and
freed in 1993 after serving all but
three years of a 15-year sentence,
much of it in solitary confinement.
