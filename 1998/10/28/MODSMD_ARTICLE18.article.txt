# Clinton to look out for women in Social Security
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Presi-
dent Clinton said Tuesday he will
keep in mind the obstacles to a
secure old age for women when he
and lawmakers sit down to talk
about Social Security's future at a
White House conference in Decem
ber.
"We still have hard decisions to
make, but... we ought to be espe
cially sensitive as to how these deci
sions affect women," Clinton said
during a discussion he and Vice
President Al Gore had at the White
House with a group of women from
different parts of the country.

"Study after study shows us that
women face greater economic chal
lenges in retirement than men do,"
said Clinton.
Women live longer, earn less
during their working years and are
less likely to have private pensions
than men, the president said, using
charts to make his point.
Wilma V. Haga, 76, of Bristol,
Tenn., told how she worked in a
school cafeteria for nearly 28 years
to help her husband put their two
sons through college.
When her husband died in 1991,
the Social Security system allowed

her to collect his much bigger bene
fit checks instead of her own $3(X)
monthly benefit.
Other women told how Social
Security survivors' benefits had
helped them make ends meet when
a husband or parent died, or how
they expect to be completely
dependent on the program because
they will have virtually no other
income in old age.
Clinton said Tuesday he will
seek legislation next year to give
women greater access to income
from private pension or 401 (k)
retirement savings plans.
