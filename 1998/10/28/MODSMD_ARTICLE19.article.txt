Klu Klux Klan leaders won't wear
masks on Halloween
GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) — Saying pointy
hoods and masks don't qualify as Halloween cos
tumes, a sheriff told Ku Klux Klan leaders they'll be
thrown in jail if they try to use the holiday as a way
around Georgia's anti-mask law.
"If they've got on a Klan robe and a Klan hat and
any type of mask, including a Mickey Mouse mask,
they will be arrested," Hall County Sheriff Hob Vass
said Tuesday.
Klan leaders thought they had found a loophole in
the law that bans anyone from wearing a mask, hood
or any device that conceals a person's identity in pub
lic.
The law exempts Halloween costumes, but Vass
says officers know the difference between Klan
hoods and Casper masks.
Gary Mallicoat, spokesman for the Gainesville
based American Knights, said the group had planned
on marching with masks on Halloween "because we
thought we could get away with it."
But threatened with arrest, "None of our mem
bers will be covering their faces."
The state Supreme rejected arguments in 1990
that the law intended to curb Klan activity is uncon
stitutional. The justices said the 1951 law doesn't vio
late free-speech rights and is a legitimate attempt to
prevent violence and intimidation.
Government recommends pilots
not take Viagra before flights
WASHINGTON (AP) — Add another line to a
pilot's preflight checklist: No Viagra.
The Federal Aviation Administration is recom
mending pilots not take the impotence drug within
six hours of flying because it could make it tough to
distinguish between the blues and greens found in
cockpit instrument and runway lights.
So far the drug doesn't seem to be a problem for
other transportation workers.

"For the above reasons, '.Six hours from Viagra to
throttle' is recommended," wrote Dr. Donato J. Bor
rillo, a llight surgeon who issued the warning in the
most recent issue of the Federal Air Surgeon's Med
ical Bulletin. Studies show it takes that long for Via
gra to leave the bloodstream. The phrase mimics the
abstinence rule for pilots who drink alcohol: "Eiight
hours from bottle to throttle."
In clinical studies of Viagra, 3 percent of patients
reported seeing a bluish haze. Others taking higher
than-recommended doses had trouble telling the dif
ference between blue and green.
Both conditions are troublesome for pilots, since
blue and green lights are used to outline taxiways and
illuminate digital instrument panels.
1997 was safest year on highways,
government says
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government is
crediting public safety campaigns with pushing the
highway death rate to an all-time low last year.
Traffic accidents killed 41.%7 people in 1997.
Since people drove nearly 2.6 billion miles, the death
rate was 1.6 per 1(H) million miles traveled, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said.
Although the number of fatalities has been lower
in some other years, the higher mileage held down
the rate, the lowest since Nil ISA started keeping
statistics 30 years ago.
Traffic accidents killed 42,085 people in 19%. for
a rate of 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the agency's director, said
Tuesday the country is starting to see the results of a
coordinated effort to crack down on drunken drivers
and red-light runners, as well as the benefit of other
programs.
Much of the work has come in the form of human
interest advertising campaigns, such as haunting fam
ily videos of the victims of drunken driving crashes.
Of those who were killed last year, 21.989 died in
passenger car crashes. Another 10,244 died in light
truck crashes, while 2.106 were killed in motorcycle
crashes.
