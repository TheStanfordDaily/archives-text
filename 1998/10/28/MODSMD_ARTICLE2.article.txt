## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Yesterday, the attorney representing
Michael Ternoey, the Phi Delta Theta
pledge who was seriously injured in a fight
during fraternity Rush last spring, met to dis
cuss pre-trial hearings for a pending lawsuit
with attorneys for Stanford's Phi Delt chap
ter, the national Phi Delt organization, and
the alleged assailants.
Ternoey has filed suit against the Phi
Delta Theta national fraternity, Stanford's
chapter, two members of the fraternity and
the two other pledges who allegedly at
tacked Ternoey.
At a Santa Cruz beach bonfire April 17,
an alleged altercation between two other
pledges. Christian Felix and Hamzah
Mazari, and Ternoey ended in Ternoey
being rushed to the hospital for stitches and
plastic surgery. Former fraternity president

Daniel Broderick and Crosby Grant drove
Ternoey to Dominican Hospital in Santa
C ruz.
The official complaint, filed June 2 by
Ternoey's attorney Todd Emanuel, de
scribes the incident as an unprovoked attack
by the two pledges, who were intoxicated at
the time. The complaint also details the days
following the event, when Broderick and
Felix allegedly tried to convince Ternoey
that his injuries were caused by an acciden
tal fall.
The two pledges are charged with assault
and battery, and all defendants named are
being sued for negligence, fraud and inten
tional infliction of emotional distress. Ter
noey is suing for compensation for general
damages, medical expenses, lawsuit costs,
lost earnings and"for such other and further
relief as the Court may deem proper " ac
cording to the official complaint.
The national fraternity, Stanford's chap

ter. and Grant and Broderick are all being
represented by the same law firm. Each of
the alleged assailants, Felix and Mazari, has
retained separate counsel.
111 a case management conference yester
day morning, lawyers on both sides met to
discuss further case hearing and conference
dates. According to Emanuel, the trial date
will probably be decided at another case
management conference on Feb. 14. The
date is likely to be in late summer 19W.
The lawyers also set a January date for a
hearing on a motion filed by the attorneys
for the fraternity and its members. The ac
tion, if successful, would dismiss the suit
against the national fraternity, the Stanford
chapter and the two former officers. Grant
and Broderick.
Emanuel also subpoenaed the hearing
records of Stanford's internal investigation
of the incident from last spring. De
fense lawyers tried to block the sub
poena, claiming that those files are
confidential under Stanford's Judi
cial Charter, but the judge has or
dered the University to provide
Emanuel with the records.

chapter... will be found
blameless.'
—Rudy Porchivina

Province President Rudy Porchiv
ina, a regional representative of the
fraternity who oversees the Stanford,
UC-Berkeley, San Jose State and
Sonoma State chapters, thinks the
fraternity will not feel any more con
sequences due to this incident.
"I am confident that both the
chapter and the general fraternity will
be found blameless," he said. "1 think
the fraternity has experienced all the
ramifications that it's going to as a re
sult of this incident."
None of the defense attorneys was
available for comment.
Porchivina mentioned that there

cent tragedy involving senior Michael
Howard is more of a concern than the
current lawsuit. Although issues of
housing and future policies regarding
the fraternity are crucial, Porchivina
said, "We remain very concerned
about Mike Howard — that's our
biggest concern right now."
According to Emanuel, although
marijuana and alcohol were made
available at the party, substance
abuse was not his major concern.
"My concern is the physical act
that took place and that it was al
lowed to take place," he said. "This is
a case about a freshman getting the
living daylights beaten out of him and
nobcxly doing anything about it."
The incident occured on a Rush
trip to a Santa Cruz beach last spring.
About 15 members of the fraternity
and 10 pledges gathered for a bonfire
party on the beach, where both alco
hol and marijuana were provided to
the rushees by active members, ac
cording to Emanuel. Mazari and
Felix allegedly attacked Ternoey, re
sulting in severe facial injuries.
The incident resulted in sanctions
being imposed on the fraternity by
the University. The fraternity violat
ed those sanctions in events related to
Howard's recent accident. Conse
quently, the fraternity will lose its
campus housing after this quarter.
