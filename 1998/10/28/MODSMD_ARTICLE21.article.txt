This year's changes guaran
tee return of Stanford's part
rally, part musical insanity

The gaieties production is
one of Stanford's few hallowed tradi
tions. Unfortunately, last year's sub
par production and poor organization hurt
the show's reputation and led many fresh
men to believe that Gaieties was not a seri
ously funny Stanford hallmark.
This year, however, a reorganized and
re-energized Gaieties staff is gearing up for
an exciting, humorous portrayal of the infa
mous Stanford / Cal rivalry.
Under the direction of producer Steven
Aronowitz, this year's Gaieties has under
gone some important changes. Over the
summer, the script was made available on
the World Wide Web for the crew members
to peruse and suggest alterations. The
entire crew also went on a retreat at the
beginning of the year to share ideas and get
to know one another before the long hours
of work awaiting them. These preparatory
efforts have resulted in a more cohesive
crew with fewer of the historic conflicts
between the artistic and technical sides.
According to crew members, they are
consciously trying to reverse the direction
the production took last year in order to
bring back some of the students that may
have been alienated by last year's show.
The length has been shortened to two
hours, and the subject matter will focus
more on the Stanford / Cal rivalry.
Last year's production seemed more of a
bitter, social criticism of Stanford than a
raucous depiction of our rivalry with Cal. In
that show, Stanford was run bv various cor

porations. Memorial Church was known as
NikeChu while the Coffee House was run
by Starbucks, Sta√üu. While many of those
references were humorous, most Stanford
students are not in the mood to attend an
extended performance based on a social cri
tique of the University the night before our
football team plays our biggest rival.
In addition to these efforts, the Gaieties
staff explained they are undertaking an
extensive publicity campaign to spread the
word about the new and revitalized Gai
eties. Aronowitz and another staff member
have written a promotional song to be sung
in dining halls and house meetings. Titled
"The Gaieties Song," the verses hint at the
subject of this year's production and are
sung to the tune of the Barenaked Ladies
song "One Week." Aronowitz will not
reveal the plot of Gaieties '98, but he guar
antees that it will depict a "colossal battle
between Berkeley and Stanford."
The staff has also made a concerted
effort to make ticket sales easier and more
efficient. Last year, the most popular per
formance on Friday night was oversold by
7(M) tickets. Tickets will be available on the
World Wide Web this year so that it will be
easier to track how many tickets are being
sold for each show.
This year's cast of 37 competed in a pool
with the largest group of auditioners ever,
and the cast and crew has been rehearsing
four hours, five nights each week. Vice-
Provost James Montoya, Dean of Admis
sions Robert Kinnally and, of course, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper will make
cameo appearances.
The efforts to bring Gaieties back to the
center of Big Game tradition demonstrate
Rams Head's commitment to quality pro
ductions. We hope Gaieties '98 will boost
school spirit for the main event.
