## But this porridge is just right 
### 
Although our
society values
efficiency and
economy, we undoubtedly
live in a nation of excess.
While some other coun
tries cannot provide their
people with basic human

necessities, we Americans make sure that
even our homeless have access to a cell
phone and a good chiropractor. With our
surplus of resources, we revel in our glut
tony.
When I reflect on what epitomizes
American society, a number of things come
to mind — the first of which is our love
affair with cheap, greasy food. We never get
tired of eating burgers, fried chicken and
pizza, and the fast food chains that cater to
our super-sized diets are proliferating.
In California, it is impossible to avoid the
array of Mexican restaurants that pervade
the state. While the authentic eateries are
always the best, Californian chefs invariably
contaminate their dishes with feta cheese
and hummus, transforming savory enchila
da entrees into distorted Mexicali debacles.
In contrast, I enjoy indulging in Tex-Mex
meals. Occasionally 1 will spend an evening
at Chili's Bar and Grill, where I like to sit
and watch the locals. Most of the parties
waiting for tables are families that include
small children bubbling with an excitement
unfettered by culinary standards or the
knowledge that there exists a cuisine
beyond mozzarella sticks and Awesome
Blossoms®. The menu refers to its fried
fare using this distinctive nomenclature, fea
turing deep-fat favorites such as Fried
Cheese®, Southwestern Eggrolls® and

Batter-Dipped Coronary Artery Block
age®.
Even with the our current health fads,
these grease houses continue to be success
ful without much advertising. I have never
really understood the way marketing works
for these some of these franchises. Hot-
Dog-on-a-Stick, a fixture in food courts at
malls across the nation, has the enigmatic
policy of dressing its employe ts in red, yel
low and blue striped clown outfi s. Does this
uniform somehow make a con. log taste
better? Is mustard sweeter when served by
a clerk whose complete lack of dignity is dis
played in primary colors?
In my vision of the future, the most suc
cessful fast food chain would sell nothing
but one specialty item — say, stuffed baked
potatoes — and would have workers who
dressed in tuxedoes and had stylish haircuts.
The workers' shifts would have to be short,
because their cummerbunds would fill up
with bacon bits quickly — this much is
clear. But the chain would be so popular
that it would have enough money to pay for
extra labor and automated cummerbund
shakers. You see, in the future, we will
respect the members of the service industry,
and we will refuse to soak our potato prod
ucts in polysaturated fat.
Of course, the fast-food industry partial
ly owes its success to the immoderate ten
dencies of us young adults. We surely are
the most overindulgent members of our
population; just consider the way we lead
our lives.
Accustomed to living in excess, college
students across the country are studying,
drinking and spending too much. The com
mon sense advice of not exceeding the lim

its of one's capacities falls on deaf, prodigal
ears. "1 can't afford to go out tonight, but
I'm going to anyway!" roars the impulsive
college-age socialite. We truly live in a cred
it-card nation.
This credit card mentality has us digging
our own graves with a smile. The freedom
to live beyond our means, if only temporar
ily, grants us instant gratification, but all the
while we accrue a debt whose eventual pay
ment may take the form of a lackluster aca
demic record, a mediocre professional
career or a grand karmic reckoning involv
ing a stuck elevator and a Hansen CD.
Fortunately, as we grow older, most of us
have the good sense to resist our natural
affinity for the extreme. Moderation pre
vails over the desires to take more food than
we can possibly eat and to drink more alco
hol than we can comfortably regurgitate.
Ancient Greeks and Chinese sages alike
advocated tending towards the middle of
any two extremes, and accepting this view is
a clear sign of maturity. And perhaps our
nation as a whole is coming of age. While the
excesses of the 60s and the 80s represent the
opposing swings of society's pendulum, the
character of the 90s more closely resembles
the temperate state of equilibrium.
A social drinker friend of mine put it
best: "You don't want to have too many or
have too few. When you get to the point
where you're feeling good, just sit back
enjoy the buzz."
Said like a true sage.

phy, is developing a prototype for the auto
mated cummerbund shaker. "I am ahead of
my time," he insists.
