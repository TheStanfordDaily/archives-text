Leung's attack unjustified
Being a athlete at Stanford is real hard.
For instance, last quarter, when I got three
F's and a D, my coach said, "Alii, I think
you're concentrating too much on one sub
ject." After he said that, I got really angry,
so I threw some furniture and plates from a
balcony, dropped a toaster out the window
and then drove my golf cart into a bike rack
outside of Mirrielees. Then I worked on
other ways to be "rude and uninterested in
campus life" and thought about other
"notorious acts of violence and criminality."
Then I went to the special tutoring sessions
offered just for athletes. Unfortunately, the
tutors were athletes too, and since they're
"a far cry from scholars" we all just sat and
stared blankly at my problem set.
That's my life as an athlete in a nutshell,
according to Audrey Leung's Oct. 22 letter.
In a thinly veiled criticism of the Depart
ment of Athletics' failure to divulge coach
es' salaries, Leung attacked all Stanford ath
letes. The short disclaimer, "While there are
certainly many athletes among us who are
bright students and good citizens" does not
excuse the fact that Leung made sweeping
generalizations about the athlete popula
tion as a whole. This population, by the way,
makes up more than 10 percent of the

undergraduate student body. That's a sig
nificant portion of students Leung targeted
with her comments.
Leung needs a reality check. Athletes at
Stanford are capable of taking the same
classes that she did and then going to sever
al hours of physically demanding practice
each day. Many athletes manage to earn the
same grades she did, or better, even though
they miss class for days at a time while trav
eling. The majority of athletes contribute to
campus life as presidents of organizations,
researchers, and community service volun
teers. Apparently, because we talk in com
plete sentences and wear non-Nike apparel,
our presence goes undetected.
Leung also takes issue with the practice
of awarding scholarships to wealthy athletes
to "study" here while non-athletes struggle
to pay their way at Stanford. This insinuates
that non-athletes are better students, and
thus, more deserving of financial aid. Per
haps Leung is bitter that she did not possess
a skill that would have helped fund her edu
cation. Maybe Leung is unaware that Uni
versity aid and Department of Athletics aid
come from separate funds. No student ever
lost his or her need-based aid at the expense
of an athletic scholarship. Furthermore, the
idea that any group of students deserves to
be here more than another is ridiculous.
Admissions chooses all students because

they possess special talents.
Leung also accused athletes of causing
"problems with our fraternities," such as
"alcohol violations." This too is an unfound
ed accusation. Both athletes and non-ath
letes are members of Greek organizations,
so why are athletes automatically blamed?
Judging from the length of her letter
devoted to belittling athletes, Leung appar
ently has more issues with them than with
the Athletics Department. But it is still dif
ficult to believe that Leung attended Stan
ford for four years without coming into con
tact with some "quality" athletes.
Either way, Leung owes Stanford ath
letes an apology. Meanwhile, we'll step on
to the court, take the field, hit the course or
jump into the pool wearing our Cardinal
red, proud to represent the University with
the finest combination of academics and
athletics in the nation.

Kashmir seeks freedom
This is in response to Vikas Duwuri's
Oct. 26 letter. It is Duwuri's brand of blind
patriotism that Oscar Wilde was referring to

when he said, "Patriotism is the virtue of the
vicious." Either Duvvuri is completely con
fused about the ground realities in Kashmir,
or he has deliberately chosen to be true to
the traditional Indian approach to the Kash
mir issue.
The "chief cause of bloodshed" in Kash
mir is the brutal campaign of terror
unleashed by one of the world's largest mil
itary forces against an unarmed civilian
population. The "chief cause of bloodshed"
in Kashmir is the 50 years of denial by India
of the internationally recognized right of
the Kashmiris to self-determination,
endorsed by India itself in the United
Nations and other international forums. In
their attempt to crush the indigenous strug
gle of the Kashmiris against foreign occupa
tion, Indian forces have committed
unprecedented barbarities — killings, rape,
torture, deaths in custody.
In 1989, the Kashmiris took up arms in
their campaign, since, for four decades, the
Indians did not understand the language of
a peaceful struggle. Those who took up
arms are freedom fighters, not "terrorists."
The "Indians" that Duvvuri claims were
"abducted and murdered... by the thou
sands" were actually Kashmiris who died
and disappeared by the thousands at the
hands of the Indian security forces. And the
large majority of Kashmiris do not consider

themselves "Indians."
If the "chief cause of bloodshed" in
Kashmir is so clear in Duvvuri's view, why is
the Indian government unwilling to let
international human rights orgranizations.
like Amnesty International, enter Kashmir?
And if the main problem is foreign-trained
"terrorists", does India really need a mili
tary force amounting to one soldier for
every six Kashmiri civilians?
For 50 years, Pakistan has supported the
Kashmiris politically, morally, and diplo
matically in their just struggle. Unlike India,
it does not consider Kashmir an "integral
part" of itself. Pakistan has been imploring
the world community to keep the commit
ment made to the people of Kashmir in
1948 in the form of UN Security Council
resolutions.
Kashmir needs to be recognized as an
issue about people whose future must be
decided only by themselves. It has been the
scene of a gruesome human tragedy as a
result of the unbridled terror unleashed by
an occupying military force. The beautiful
Stanford motto goes, "Die Luft der Freiheit
weht" — "The wind of freedom blows,"
and it is only this "wind of freedom" that
can make Kashmir the paradise it once was.
