# Deep Thoughts
## Repeat after me: Are you fat? Just say no 
### 
Brittney Jensen

LAS I SPRING I filled out a body
image study questionnaire that
asked, "How much do you agree
with the following statement? I am happy
with my body the way it is."
1 couldn't imagine circling 5, "I agree
completely with this statement." 1 lingered
over circling 4; I was having a good day. 1
settled on the neutral 3. Sometimes 1 am
happy with my body, but, as a young
American female, I couldn't admit this
tact, even to a piece of paper.
How many times have you heard girls
complain, "I'm so fat"? How many times
have you heard a girl say, "I'm skinny
enough and happy with my body the way it
is"? Even in the era of self-esteem cele
bration, it is not culturally acceptable for a
girl to love her body.
Magazines give us "Ten steps to boost
your confidence" next to "How to loose
those 10 pounds by eating cabbage and
chocolate-covered pickles." The articles
assume we all have 10 pounds to lose. We
have to get rid of that cellulite, a bodily
feature found even in underweight
females who are genetically predisposed

to this harmless repulsion.
We are never working out enough nor
eating low fat enough. The media con
stantly encourages this obsession and the
diet / nutrition industry thrives off our
economic support.
Sometimes a girl gets enough positive
feedback, sees enough protruding bone, to
accept her skinniness. Then comes the
overwhelming guilt and isolation of not
participating in the female obsession.
Your friends will not like you when
they give you clothes they outgrew after
high school graduation. When other girls
get together and complain about their
weight, should you just keep quiet?
Should you start crying over the flap of
skin by your armpit? Can you appease
their hatred by complaining about how
small your boobs are? Should you insist
you have cellulite, and go as far as to show
the third floor of Rinconada your butt to
prove it?
Or should you just find something
wrong with your body so you can partake
in the national pastime of physical self
improvement?

Even scarier than skinny chic is anorex
ic chic. Fortunately, Stanford seems too
intelligent to embrace the celebration of
self-destruction that pervades most state
schools, where the pipes have to be
changed periodically to clean out the
bulimic vomit.
I've witnessed this phenomenon among
dancers, whose art requires emaciation. Of
the girls I danced with, I would estimate an
80 percent rate of serious eating disorders.
A combination of looking at our practical
ly naked, imperfect bodies in the mirror
for five hours a day and dance teachers
who made us write down and turn in for
grading how much we ate, usually pro
duced an unhealthy eating obsession and
negative body image.
Fortunately, most girls at some point
get sick of the constant hunger-induced
crankiness and / or realize their mortality
and start eating before it's too late. Once
the vomiting and starvation stops, the
shame is over and the talking starts.
I'm sure it's beneficial to talk about
these intense experiences, to share stories
about how you slipped and ate a baked

potato, overreaching your three-grams
per-day fat limit, then ran until you passed
out in the bushes two blocks from your
house. But at some point it almost
becomes boasting. Unhealthy eating radi
ates a certain glamour, despite the nasty
reality of permanent vomit taste and chest
hair sprouting to warm the under-insulat
ed body.
The anorexic follows a legacy that
includes Princess Di and numerous prima
ballerinas, and she feels she has proven
her discipline and dedication to the art.
Once I witnessed three post-anorexics
sharing stories when the topic of hospital
stays came up. Girls A and B had suffered
starvation-induced kidney failure; girl C
had no near-death experiences. Immedi
ately girl A and B bonded, comparing the
way the evil doctors tried to make them
eat, pushing girl C outside the close circle
they formed. A and B are now best friends
and look down on C as a poser anorexic
and a less serious dancer than those who
have hospital bracelets to prove their
intensity.
These examples may seem extreme, but

apply them to the female population at
large. Without a troubled (some would say
psychotic) eating past, a dancer is not a
serious artist. Without a constant yearning
towards a skinnier nirvana, a girl is not a
true woman. Once a woman is satisfied
with her skinniness, she is excluded from a
large percentage of the pages of Made
moiselle and Cosmopolitan.
It is not enough to have just any com
plaint about your body; whine about being
too skinny and other girls are more likely
to be annoyed than sympathetic. There's
no need for a "Don't hate me because I'm
beautiful" attitude, but I encourage
women to rip up that "30 days to a perfect
body" article and repeat after me: "I'm
good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog
gonnit, I love my body."

Brittney Jensen is a senior majoring in inter
disciplinary English. She would like to clari
fy that the sketchy incidents involving SAE
mentioned in last week's column occurred
three years ago. She understands that the
SAEs are now quality, especially their awe
some pledge class.
