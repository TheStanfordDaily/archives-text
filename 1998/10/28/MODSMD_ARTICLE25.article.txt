"We were able to play right with
[San Jose State] despite missing
some key players," senior defense
man Paul Heneman said. "When we
have a full team we might beat

During the first game on Friday

on a goal by graduate defenseman
Filip Ronning. A vicious foul by San
Jose State, however, resulted in a
devastating injury to senior goal
tender Nick Flores, who was playing
at forward because of Stanford
being short-handed.
"He had a bad concussion in the
first period," said Heneman. "The
games were stopped for 30 min
utes."
Flores was hospitalized for the
night and will probably miss at least
