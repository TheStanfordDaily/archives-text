"We were able to play right with
[San Jose State] despite missing
some key players," senior defense
man Paul Heneman said. "When we
have a full team we might beat
them."
During the first game on Friday
night Stanford jumped to a 1-0 lead
on a goal by graduate defenseman
Filip Ronning. A vicious foul by San
Jose State, however, resulted in a
devastating injury to senior goal
tender Nick Flores, who was playing
at forward because of Stanford
being short-handed.
"He had a bad concussion in the
first period," said Heneman. "The
games were stopped for 30 min
utes."
Flores was hospitalized for the
night and will probably miss at least
six weeks.
"It [the injury] definitely put the
game in perspective," said Sami Jo
Small, a senior goaltender.
Stanford's Juha Yrjanheikki, a
doctorate student from Finland, net
ted a power-play goal following the
injury, but Stanford quickly lost the
advantage.
"We were playing pretty well
[and] had some momentum, but the
team was a little flat after the injury,"
said Heneman. "We didn't have the
fire after that."
"The team basically let up and
they got a couple of goals," Small
said.
San Jose State capitalized in the
second period, tying the score at 2-2.

"[ln] the third period things just
broke down and we gave up three
goals for the 5-2 defeat," Heneman
said.
During the second game on Satur
day evening, Stanford came out flat
and gave up two early goals to the
Spartans.
"We came out underspirited be
cause of the first game and losing
Nick," said junior defenseman Ben
D'Ewart.
"After the two early goals we set
tled down," Heneman said. "Some
times it happens. You don't have it
right off the bat, but [we] pretty much
played even after the early goals."
Stanford fought back, cutting the
lead to 3-2. D'Ewart scored on an
outside shot from 50 feet away and
Yrjanheikki followed with a break
away goal.
"We had a three-on-one," said

D'Ewart. "[We] caught them in a
transition and capitalized quickly."
Stanford, however, continued to
catch unlucky breaks after cutting the
deficit to one and San Jose State
scored twice more.
"The second game we hit six
posts," Small said. "It's just the luck
of the draw."
The team remained optimistic fol
lowing the two losses, anticipating
that the return of missing players and
more practice time with new coach
BJ. Nader will lead to quick im
provements.
"We were uncertain going into the
first game," said Heneman. "Coach
had only coached one practice before
that and now we can work on setting
the power play, offense and defense."
Stanford travels to Los Angeles
for a two-game series against UCLA
this weekend.
