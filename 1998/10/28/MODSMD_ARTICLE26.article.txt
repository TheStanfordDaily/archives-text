## Kribel brings experience to men's golf 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
For most athletes, playing alongside or
even just meeting a professional athlete is
only a dream. For Stanford golfer Joel Kribel,
it is old hat.
Kribel has twice played in the U.S. Open
and once participated in the Masters. While
there. Kribel had the opportunity to tee off
with the likes of Masters champion Phil
Mickelson. 1997 British Open winner Justin
Leonard and 1997 PGA Championship win
ner Davis Love 111.
Yet Kribel claims that he was not intimi
dated to play with such accomplished golfers.
"I played with Tiger [Woods] when he was
here, and he's the guy that everybody's look
ing at. Once I got to know him on a personal
level. I wasn't intimidated or overwhelmed
[by professional golfers]."
Rather than just enjoy the scenery, Kribel
used his PCi A Tour experiences as a learning
tool.
"Anytime you have a chance to play with
somebody better than you, it helps you to
evaluate where you stand, what you need to
do to improve your game. Also. 1 really ap
preciated how many of the professionals
went out of their way to help me."
Playing in the U.S. Open and the Masters
also reinforced Kribel's desire to one day
turn professional.
"Playing in those tournaments gave me a
taste of what's out there and made me more
hungry to get there again."
Bui Kribel did not always envision himself
as a professional golfer. After narrowing his
choices down to baseball or golf, Kribel final
ly settled on the latter.
"I had to make a choice, it was tough. At
that time, there weren't as many golfers my
age who were really good whereas there were
a lot of good baseball players my age."

Judging from his performances at Stan
ford and the promising PGA Tour career that
awaits him, it seems the choice was a good
one.
At Stanford. Kribel has been a mainstay
for Cardinal coach Wally Goodwin. Kribel
has twice earned First Team Ail-American
honors and last year finished second at the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships and
fourth at the NCAA Regional Tournament.
"I never have to worry about Joel. He gets
over his problems on the golf course very
quickly," Goodwin said. "From the stand
point of mental toughness, he's right up there
with the best I've ever coached."
High praise indeed from someone who has
coached PGA Tour professionals Woods and
Casey Martin, among others.
This season, the senior has been the cap
tain of the Stanford golf team both on and off
the course. Kribel has been the Cardinal's
most consistent golfer, finishing in the top 10
in each of Stanford's first three tournaments.
Off the course, Kribel's experience has
proven invaluable for Stanford's younger
golfers.
"He's the motor that drives the boat," said
Goodwin.
Kribel began the season ranked fifth in the
Mastercard / Collegiate Golf Poll and is cur
rently ninth. Kribel's individual ranking fell
after his eighth-place finish at the Wolfpack
Classic, the first time he has placed out of the
top five in his last 12 collegiate tournaments.
"So far 1 feel like I've played pretty well
but it goes without saying that there's room
for improvement," Kribel said.
Though most golfers would be happy with
the season he has turned in so far. Kribel is al
ways looking for ways to improve.
"In golf, you learn to play from experience.
After each shot, you have to think about what
