Women's Rugby: The Stanford women's rugby season
seemed to get kicked off at just the proper time to
enjoy the mud of the intramural fields. The Cardinal
hosted a rookie tournament that consisted of 11 dif
ferent teams. Humboldt won the tournament champi
onship, topping Santa Clara by a score of 1 3-7.
The rookie tournament is a l()-a-side format that
gives all of the new players on the Stanford team and
the other teams of the region a chance to test out their
newly acquired skills and game. Not only were the
players being introduced to the game of rugby itself,
but also to the joys of playing rugby during the winter
rainy season in Northern California.

"It hasn't rained since May, but we spent most of
Saturday morning shivering in the rain," said team
president Lara Strauss. "The rookies absolutely loved
the mud [though] and all the teams showed up."
Stanford has so many women that are j list joining
the team that the Cardinal entered three separate
teams into the tournament play. Between the three
teams, Stanford posted a 5-4 record for the day, and
outscored opponents by a two-point margin, 117 to
115.
Junior Sarah Clowes raced around the opposition
scoring four tries, the highest scoring total for the Car
dinal. Also scoring for Stanford were freshman Anna
Veit with three ties, and senior Cherie McCabe and
freshman Ann Timbie both had one try each.
On the defensive side of play, freshman Heather
Littlejohn proved to be quite a tackling force. Little
john stopped the opposition several times and helped
to force turnovers by the other teams. Senior Ashly
Dean debuted in the prop position and was able to
capitalize on those loose balls created in the tackles by
picking the ball up and advancing for the Cardinal.
Each of the rookie teams were allowed to have two
returning players experienced with the game to help
captain the side and keep continuity throughout the
game. Sara Dwight, although a returning player,
played for the first time at the position of scrum-half
and helped the Cardinal to several of its victories.
Now that the Stanford rookies have some experi
ence under their belts, it is time to prepare for the reg
ular season. Several of the rookies may be called into

action on the A team to make up for positions that
were vacated due to graduating seniors from last sea
son.
I he Cardinal is poised to make a run at the nation
al cup division championship after finishing first in the
plate division last year. The A-side squad will initiate
the season this Saturday with a I p.m. game against
Arizona State University at Maloney field.
Equestrian: With heavy rain falling last Saturday, the
equestrian team traveled to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
for a double-header western competition. Despite the
second part of the day being held completely in the
rain. Stanford had several riders finish very well in the
show, including senior Kathleen Gilbert, who finished
first in the open-reining division.
Despite being abroad all of last year and therefore
having not ridden in almost 12 months, Gilbert was
able to win the top spot in the stock-seat (Western
style) open reining. I'he open division is for the best
and most experienced riders.
Stanford also placed well in the intermediate, level
one bracket. Shannon Kieslingtook first in each of the
two competitions in this bracket. She was followed
closely by Chandra Christenson, who had a second
place finish, and by Jana Cain, who had both second
and fourth-place finishes.
The Cardinal had several riders competing for the
very first time. Freshmen Bo White, Steve Smith and
Amanda Vinson all rode in their first show. Smith was
able to capture two sixth-place finishes at the interme
diate two level, and White a second- and fifth- place
finish in the beginning walk / jog category. Vinson was
able to jump right into the open category and was
awarded a fifth-place finish in the afternoon competi
tion.
The Stanford equestrian team will have its last
home show of the season this Saturday and Sunday.
The competition will be held at the Red Barn and will
consist of only English riding styles. The Western team
will be back in action on Nov. 8 at a meet in Reedley,
Calif.
Bowling: The Bowling team dropped two matches to
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo last Saturday. Junior Tak
Nomura led Stanford with scores of 155, 189, and 160
in the first match. Freshman Bill Westphall also had a
solid days with scores of 158,159 and 177.
The Cardinal ended up losing the first match 2478-
2255. Cal State-Fullerton was much more dominating
in the second match, beating the bowling team 3(XM)-
2381.
