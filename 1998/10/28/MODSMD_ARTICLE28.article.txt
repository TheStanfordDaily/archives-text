Sophomore midfielder Sean Sylvis suffered a clean break to his fibula in last weekend's game
against UC-Santa Barbara. Sylvis planted his left leg in order to retrieve a long ball when a defend
er slid into it and caused the injury. With recovery and rehabilitation, Sylvis is not expected to return
any sooner than mid-December.
