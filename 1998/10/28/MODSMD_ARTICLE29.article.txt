# Brest stepping down, not out
## Law dean will devote time to broadening legal education 
### Alice Brown 
Although Paul Brest is stepping
down from his position as Dean of
Stanford Law School this August,
he is hardly lightening his load.
Brest, after a year on sabbatical,
will return to the Law School to
teach and develop new interdisci
plinary courses.
He will most likely spend next
year at the NYU Law School, de
veloping classes there as well.
"My own teaching agenda in
volves problem-solving and related
skills," Brest said. He is focusing on
the "skills and knowledge that
lawyers use all the time but that law
schools don't teach," he added.
Increasingly, there are both po
litical and business aspects to law,
and the courses he is developing
will give students a better sense of
how to apply legal knowledge to

the range of problems clients bring.
The course he has proposed, ti
tled "Initiative in Law, Business
and Public Policy," will borrow
from other parts of the University,
such as the Graduate School of
Business.
The proposal for the course
states that "legal analytic skills arc
essential for preparing students for
the practice of law and also are ex
tremely valuable foundations for
careers in business and public poli
cy, a substantial and increasing
number of Stanford Law School
graduates pursue careers in busi
ness and public policy as well as
law, often moving among these
fields, and law school graduates
whose careers remain exclusively
in law practice are better lawyers if
they gain certain skills and knowl
edge in addition to legal analysis."
Brest noted that the Law School

is moving in the direction of broad
ening the careers of graduates to
include more business and public
policy.
His course is the blueprint for
such a broadening. "It will go be
yond traditional legal education,"
Brest said.
Brest, along with other profes
sors in the Law School, is currently
assessing what skills and knowl
edge graduates will use across the
three fields of law, business and
public policy to gather more mate
rial for new courses.
Brest held his position for more
than a decade. The outgoing dean
is well known for his successful fi
nancial campaigning for the Law
School and work on faculty devel
opment.
The finance campaign that he
led has raised more than $72 mil
lion.
