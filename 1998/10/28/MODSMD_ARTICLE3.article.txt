## Henderson replies to Tree thieves 
### Jane Morril 
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson
has responded to the theft of his cos
tume by challenging the robbers to
escalate their efforts and kidnap
him.
In a statement released yester
day, Henderson mocked the so
called Phoenix Five, who claim to be
a group of UC-Berkeley students
holding the costume, for issuing a
statement purportedly signed by the
Tree.

'This is called Big Game for
a reason. Get big. Get me."
— Chris Henderson

"It has come to my attention that
perhaps our friends at Cal have a
limited understanding of the organ
ic world," Henderson said in his
statement. "It seems that they mis
takenly believe they have stolen a
living thing. This is not the case. The
Tree costume is an inanimate ob
ject. It does not move; it does not
think; it does not write letters, espe
cially letters which deprecate Stan
ford."
The costume was stolen from the
Band Shak music librarv on Oct. 17.

The Phoenix Five issued their >tate
ment Monday to The Daily Cali
fornian. Cal's student newspaper,
accompanied by a photograph of the
Tree costume blindfolded.
"I am sick of the Fai m." the cap
tors' letter attributed to the cos
tume. " The Phoenix Five have intro
duced me to the outside world
where people are different and actu
ally like their school."
The group claimed they were
compelled to steal the Tree because
"diversity, spirit and work ethic
make Cal a superior university and
Stanford an inferior one."
Henderson's tongue-in-cheek
reply egged on his "rather slow
friends."
"Stop talking to a pile of fabric
and show a little backbone. ('urrent
ly, there is some debate over
whether stealing the costume is a
misdemeanor or a felony. I assure
you that kidnapping the real Tree is
a federal offense. This is called Big
Game for a reason. Get big. Get
me."
If the costume is not turned in to
police by midnight, l)C-Berkeley
Chancellor Robert Berdahl has said
he will prohibit Oski the Bear,
Berkeley's mascot, from appearing
in Saturday's football game. As of
Tuesday evening, the costume had
not been returned.
The Phoenix Five claim theirs
was a "crime of opportunity" and
that they found the tree "unattend
ed in a locked cage."
"Sure it was a crime of opportu
nity," Henderson said. "It's like
when 1 was five, and 1 climbed onto
the table, pulled myself up onto a
shelf, zip-lined across the room
over a pit of gila monsters, and, see
ing that the cookie jar happened to
be there, took one as a dessert of
opportunity."
The theft involved an elaborate
break-in to the Band Shak, accord
ing to Stanford Police, Band, and
University officials.
Student opinion on the theft
ranged from anger to amusement.
"I think it's kind of funny," said
junior Sarika Singh. "It's pretty
cool that Cal and Stanford are still
taking the rivalry seriously."
"It's a tragedy," said freshman
Megan Green.
"I'm outraged — we should get
those bastards back," said sopho
more Mike Padillo.
