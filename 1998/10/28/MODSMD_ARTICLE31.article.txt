# Making college possible
## National initiative seeks to teach students about financial aid 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
Stanford has pledged its support
to College Is Possible, a national cam
paign launched yesterday to inform
the public about financial aid for
higher education.
The program, organized by the
American Council on Education, is
sponsored by several Bay Area insti
tutions and nearly 1,2(X) colleges, uni
versities and related associations
across the country. It will continue at
least through 2(XX).
"This form of early education is
helpful to prospective students who
might have applied to schools but are
eliminating them because of fear of
costs," said Cynthia Rife, director of
student awards at the Financial Aids
Office.
College Is Possible arose after the
council found in a recent investiga
tion that students lack basic informa
tion about the financial aid process
and the considerable financial re
sources available for college stu
dents.
The council "found out that fami
lies believe that college is a good
value, and that all students should be
able to attend college," said Kate
Chesley, associate director of Uni
versity Communications.
"They also found out that people
vastly overestimated the price of
higher education and vastly underes
timated the availability of financial
aid."

The College Board's 1997-98 an
nual survey of colleges reported that
Americans greatly overestimate the
price of attending a four-year private
college: the estimated average price
in the survey results was $28,532 com
pared to the actual price of $20,378.
In another case, the Council on
Education found people overesti
mated the cost of attending college by
200 percent.
Every year, $60 billion is available
as financial aid, and 70 percent of full
time undergraduates in the nation re
ceive assistance.
The council discovered that mi
nority, low-income and first-genera
tion college students knew the least
about college costs.
"The people who could benefit
the most from a college education
know the least about it," said Tim
McDonough, director of public af
fairs for the council. "This campaign
will particularly help the most needy
when it comes to going to college but
will also provide helpful information
to a broad spectrum of people."
This spectrum will include Stan
ford hopefuls, even though McDo
nough was complimentary about
Stanford's existing mentoring pro
grams, community activities and im
proved financial aid policy.
"I wish I had known more about
the financial aid process earlier, be
cause it's so complicated that it's dif
ficult to get through on your own,"
said sophomore Carol Lin.
Each participating campus will

implement the program in a different
way.
"It's not just an ACE effort; it's a
community-wide effort that we're
helping to coordinate. It represents
the input of a lot of hardworking peo
ple and important higher education
associations," McDonough said.
As part of the campaign, the coun
cil plans to incorporate outreach pro
grams at elementary schools and
other community organizations.
At Stanford, College Is Possible
will be primarily be evident in Uni
versity publications.
Stanford Magazine and Stanford
Report have made tentative commit
ments to cover the campaign, and the
University's annual report will be
dedicated to the cost and value of a
Stanford education.
Stanford also has already been
going to schools informing students
about college costs and financing, not
nessarily specific to Stanford.
Chesley emphasized the cam
paign's relevance to the mission of
Jane and Leland Stanford.
"ITie legacy of the Stanfords was
to make sure it was affordable for
everyone. Today, Stanford remains
committed to need-blind admission,"
Chesley said.
