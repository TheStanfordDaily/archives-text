## Prostate prospects New technique aids survivors 
### Caroline Seydel 
October marks the first annual National Breast Can
cer Awareness Month. Although this has placed
national focus on breast cancer, many Americans are
not aware that another silent killer is on the rise.
Prostate cancer jeopardizes more than 150,(XX) men in
our country each year.
Prostate cancer, the most common form of cancer
among men, claims some 40,(XX) lives each year in the
United States. Those fortunate enough to survive the
disease may be faced with unpleasant side effects.
Located just below the bladder, the prostate gland is
a walnut-sized organ which secrets seminal fluid. Due
to the prostate's sensitive location, survivors of prostate
cancer surgery are frequently left impotent and some
times incontinent.
Hope is on the horizon, however. A surgical tool
being tested in 21 medical centers nationwide holds
promise for the retention of erectile function following
radical prostatectomy, or removal of the prostate. The
new tool, called the ('aver Map Surgical Aid, assists sur
geons by generating a map of critical nerves around the
prostate which contribute to an erection.
Knowing the location of such nerves will allow sur
geons to avoid damaging them during prostate removal,
according to Stanford urologist James Brooks. Brooks
is the only physician in Northern California who is using
the device, which received FDA approval last year.
The device works by delivering a low-level electrical
stimulus to the nerves around the prostate and then
measuring the erection response. The surgeon uses a
flexible wand to deliver the electrical impulse, while a
fluid-filled ring placed around the penis, detects any
erectile swelling in response to the stimulus. A map of
the relevant nerves, which are not visible to the naked
eye, is then generated by the device. Doctors can use
this map as a guide during surgery.
There are no known side effects from using the elec
trical device, said Dr. Brooks. Nerve stimulation has
been performed in other parts of the body with no side
effects, and the low amperage of the device assures that
there is no tissue damage resulting from its use.
Surgery remains the most reliable treatment for
prostate cancer, giving patients the best long-term sur
vival rate among available treatments such as radiation
therapy. Many urologists use a technique called nerve
sparing radical prostatectomy, developed in l l )K4 by
Patrick Walsh. Brooks and Walsh worked together for
nine years before Brooks came to Stanford last year.
Walsh had determined that the nerves which control
erectile function do not pass directly through the
prostate, as originally thought. Instead, these nerves
pass alongside the organ, allowing it to be removed
without directly affecting potency.
Results of Walsh's nerve-sparing technique vary
greatly, however. Success rates range from 11 to 86 per
cent preservation of sexual function, depending on the
surgeon, the age of the patient and other factors.
In comparison, a recent I Jniversity of Toronto study
suggests use of the CavcrMap may allow consistently
good results in nerve preservation. According to the
study, 16 of 17 men — 1 )4 percent — retained erectile
function following prostatectomies involving the
('aver Map. Surgery is usually enough to eliminate the
entire cancer, without additional treatments such as
radiation.
The new tool is not a guarantee. Even if all the
nerves are spared, sometimes the change in blood flow
due to the removal of the prostate can cause impotence
as well.
But Brooks has already used the nerve-finding
device during surgery on three patients since Septem
ber. And although it is too soon to tell whether the men
have retained sexual function, tests showed that the
critical nerves remained intact following the surgery in
each case.
"At the very least we can preserve people's quality
of life while curing their cancer." Brooks said.
