# Not just Mario and Luigi any more
## Video gaming technology continues to evolve

Video game systems can be found in almost every
dormitory on campus. You can't go anywhere without
seeing someone tapping away fiercely to save the
earth, score a touchdown or hit a grand slam, with all
the psychological benefits of being a hero.
Ryan Krug, a junior majoring in mechanical engi
neering, said. "I play video games around live hours a
week. I wish I could play more, and have bigger
screens and virtual games, but it's Ji'l fun to get to
control little men."
With the industry booming and the end nwwheie in
sight, gaming giants such as Sega. Sony, Nintendo and
even Microsoft are scrambling for an edge in an indus
try that is gaining membership with each passing holi
day season.
A wide range of video game systems are available.
Older systems — the original Nintendo, the Sega (ien
esis, and even the Atari 2600 — offer a veteran player
some video game nostalgia. On a more powerful and
modern level, there is a huge class of 32-bit or higher
systems, including minor players such as the Atari
Jaguar and the Sega Saturn. The most popular
machines on the market right now, though, are
undoubtedly the Sony Play Station (PSX) and the Nin
tendo 64 (N64).
The PSX is heralded for its powerful CI) interface
that delivers greater color and ( D-quality sound. I he
games feature real-time audio-video feeds and the sys
tem can display digitized video images at 60 frames per
second, comparable to a movie display. Finally, the
PSX has a storage capacity that blows the N64 out of
the water, with 675 megabytes of memory compared
to N64's 32 megabytes.
Mikel Tabaniag, an employee at the Internet cafe
Cybersmith and an avid PSX fan, said, " The N64 is just
a kid's system. The graphics are too cartoony."
I lowever, avid N64 fans claim their system's graph
ics are purely better. There is no waiting time between
levels or lights or innings, a frustrating problem with
the PSX due to its relatively small RAM. (ireater
RAM allows faster processing. The PSX has 256 kilo
bytes of RAM. while the N64 has four megabytes. On
top of that, the N64 uses cartridge technology, like the
two Nintendo systems before it. Fans prefer the
durable and reliable familiarity of the cartridge over
the CD. ;is well as the classic Nintendo system design
for speed — resulting in crisper graphics.
The latest news in video games will again raise the
stakes in the industry. (iraphics technology is about to
change dramatically, with the newest age in video
gaming being released this November in Japan. The
Dreamcast, Sega's 12N-bit dreamboat, is proving again
what happens when smart programmers get together.

The project is a joint venture among a number of huge
high-tech companies. Sega designed the graphics,
Microsoft provided the operating system, NEC con
tributed the Power VR graphics card, Yamaha sup
plied the sound card and Hitachi designed the central
processing unit. This project conies after Sega's last
failure, the Sega Saturn, a system whose poor perfor
mance led the company to a 30 percent cut in its work
force.
Dreamcast was designed to be "Sega's bridge to
worldwide market leadership for the 21st century,"
according to a press release from Bernard Stolar, pres
ident ol Sega Corporation of America. In another
press release, the Dreamcast's design team said it
wanted "to make the best system for the best games
and capture more than 50 percent of the next-genera
tion console market."
Utilizing Microsoft's C++ 5.0 should help Sega
attract more designers. The versatility of the C++ lan-

guage allows a variety of algo
rithms, or sequences of steps used
in computer programming. This
gives programmers a better
chance of making a great game in
less time. The universality of the
language also attracts more pro
grammers and allows for greater
discussion between them — bet
ter communication will lead to
more rapid solutions to bugs. The
move has worked for Sega. The
company has signed on over 400
programming groups for the pro
duction of games, including
perennial giants Capcom and
Konami.
In addition, the I litachi SI I
-4 CPU runs at 200 megahertz.
Although speed is not the end-all
and be-all of these machines, it
still shows how dominant the
machine is compared to the N64
and PSX, which have 93.75 MHz
and 33.8 MHz, respectively. Per
haps the most impressive feature
is that the SH-4 has been recon-

figured to run 1.4 billion floating point operations per
second — four times faster than the Pentium 11. The
CPU performs 360 million instructions per second,
with a bandwidth estimated at roughly 8(X) megabytes
per second. With that instruction rate, in can produce
graphics which far surpass most arcade graphics.
The Dreamcast is a godsend for all videophiles,
incoporating many of the best parts of the video-gam
ing and PC world into one machine. The Dreamcast
comes with an optional modem, mouse and keyboard
that can provide users Internet access.
Internet access will allow for network gaming, a
feature that PSX touched upon with its Combat Cable.
Network gaming, as conceived by the creators of
Dreamcast, is going to be a completely immersive
world in which players will be talking and interacting
with other players from all over the country and even
the world, all connected in a completely virtual world
displayed on the screen.
Sega has already commissioned a design group in
Westwood. Mass. called Turbine Entertainment Soft
ware to make "Asheron's Call," an online game that
promises to offer hundreds of thousands of square
miles to roam and explore. In addition, Sega recently
performed a survey and predicts that over 9 million
American households should have online gaming by
the year 2(KK).
Dreamcast will also have something called VMS, or
visual memory system, a memory card with an LCD
screen and also the smallest game card in the world. It
is an eight-bit processor reminiscent of a small Game
Boy-type device that plugs into any Dreamcast control
pad. It will allow players to save and modify personal
features. For example, they will be able to save a
favorite football play, or save the complete statistics of
their favorite character. Two VMS cards can be con
nected. providing new methods of interaction.
The short history of the video game industry is
filled with instances of amazing technical revolutions
in graphics, memory and interface capabilities. The
Dreamcast is another one of these great moments for
video gaming. 1 lowever, no one knows whether or not
its release will be another short-lived blaze of glory
with no lasting power, following in the footsteps of the
Sega Saturn. Inevitably, though, something better
always seems to come along.

In addition, the I litachi SI I
-4 CPU runs at 200 megahertz.
Although speed is not the end-all
and be-all of these machines, it
still shows how dominant the
machine is compared to the N64
and PSX, which have 93.75 MHz
and 33.8 MHz, respectively. Per
haps the most impressive feature
is that the SH-4 has been recon-

figured to run 1.4 billion floating point operations per
second — four times faster than the Pentium 11. The
CPU performs 360 million instructions per second,
with a bandwidth estimated at roughly 8(X) megabytes
per second. With that instruction rate, in can produce
graphics which far surpass most arcade graphics.
The Dreamcast is a godsend for all videophiles,
incoporating many of the best parts of the video-gam
ing and PC world into one machine. The Dreamcast
comes with an optional modem, mouse and keyboard
that can provide users Internet access.
Internet access will allow for network gaming, a
feature that PSX touched upon with its Combat Cable.
Network gaming, as conceived by the creators of
Dreamcast, is going to be a completely immersive
world in which players will be talking and interacting
with other players from all over the country and even
the world, all connected in a completely virtual world
displayed on the screen.
Sega has already commissioned a design group in
Westwood. Mass. called Turbine Entertainment Soft
ware to make "Asheron's Call," an online game that
promises to offer hundreds of thousands of square
miles to roam and explore. In addition, Sega recently
performed a survey and predicts that over 9 million
American households should have online gaming by
the year 2(KK).
Dreamcast will also have something called VMS, or
visual memory system, a memory card with an LCD
screen and also the smallest game card in the world. It
is an eight-bit processor reminiscent of a small Game
Boy-type device that plugs into any Dreamcast control
pad. It will allow players to save and modify personal
features. For example, they will be able to save a
favorite football play, or save the complete statistics of
their favorite character. Two VMS cards can be con
nected. providing new methods of interaction.
The short history of the video game industry is
filled with instances of amazing technical revolutions
in graphics, memory and interface capabilities. The
Dreamcast is another one of these great moments for
video gaming. 1 lowever, no one knows whether or not
its release will be another short-lived blaze of glory
with no lasting power, following in the footsteps of the
Sega Saturn. Inevitably, though, something better
always seems to come along.
