# Center contemplates the ethics of science
## 
### Cindy Lin 
Imagine yourself going to the
doctor to find out whether you are
genetically predisposed for
Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease
based solely on a simple blood test.
Although a positive test could allow
you to take proper preventative
measures, if your insurance compa
ny found out, you might be left
without a health plan.
The Stanford University Center
for Biomedical Ethics investigates
such issues through research, educa
tion, community outreach and clini
cal ethics consultation.
Co-founders Tom Raffin and
Ernie Young of the Medical School
co-direct the center with Barbara
Koenig. a medical anthropologist.
The center was founded in 1989
to consider issues in biomedical
ethics — including life support, ani

mal research and fetal research
and to foster the teaching of ethics
in the medical school.
"Ethics is such an important field
in medicine, and we wanted to
make sure that it is adequately rep
resented in the Medical School,"
Young said. He added that the idea
behind the ethics center was to
"consolidate what was being done
in this field and give greater visibili
ty and importance to it."
Within the SCBE is the Stanford
Program in Genomics, Ethics and
Society, which was started in 1995
with a gift from SmithKlinc
Beecham Corporation. This pro
gram serves as a forum for a collab
oration between Stanford faculty
and members of the biomedical
industry. These cooperative efforts
focus on the social, ethical, legal and
political implications of advances in
human genetics.

Each year, a group of approxi
mately 40 members comes together
at PC iES to form a working group of
health professionals, students, com
munity members and representa
tives from the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries. The
working group develops a "white
paper." which examines emerging
issues in genomics and makes rec
ommendations on how to address
them.
"Our most recent project dealt
with the idea of the increasing ease
of genetic analysis and the implica
tions of this on day-to-day medical
care," Greely said.
"Testing won't be done only for
rare genetic diseases, but also for
the genotype of pathogens that
affect the normal immune system."
he said. "We examined the implica
tions of this on medical care, com
mercialization of this technology.

race and the privacy of individuals."
I he results of this research were
presented at a conference titled
"Individual Genetic Variation:
Implications of the Coming Trans
formation of Medicine," held at
Kresge Auditorium on Oct. 17.
PC iES Senior Research Scholar
Sally Tobin, a molecular geneticist,
is heading a major project to pro
duce a multi-media, interactive CD
ROM for the continuing education
of physicians.
"This project has grown out of
my past experience teaching medi
cal students basic genetics, recombi
nant DNA technology and biomed
ical issues," said Tobin.
"Most physicians don't know
enough about molecular genetics to
do genetic testing or to interpret
these tests properly when they use
them because the field of molecular
biology has emerged so recently,"

she said.
The CD-ROM is intended to
provide physicians with a back
ground in genetics — from tech
niques and interpretation of genetic
testing to the implications of the
testing on families and health care,
Tobin said.
She hopes that the CD-ROM
will be finished in the next two
years.
The Center for Biomedical
Ethics also provides clinical ethics
consultations. Young deals primari
ly with these duties, conducting con
sultations and monthly rounds in
intensive care units and teaching
medical ethics courses.
"Ethical consultations typically
involve a situation where there is a
difference of opinions, or uncertain
ty for what the best approach is for
the patient within the treatment
team, or within the family," Young

said. "Typically it involves an end
of-life decision, and I provide an
objective analysis of the situation
and facilitate a consensus."
The educational divison of the
center is not just intended for medi
cal students and physicians. Medical
ethics courses are offered within the
human biology major, and Young
teaches a sophomore seminar in this
area
The center also organizes free
monthly seminars open to the pub
lic and a symposium each quarter.
Today at 3 p.m. at the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital, Anne
Fadiman, winner of the National
Book Critics Circle Award, will
speak on her work, "The Chal
lenges of Cultural Competence" in
biomedical ethics.
The directors hope the center
will continue to be a national leader
in the field of bioethics.
