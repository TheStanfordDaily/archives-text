## Male attacker in his 20s, 6-feet, white 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
An unidentified white man attacked a 21-
year-old Stanford woman around 1:30 a.m.
yesterday near Roble Field, according to the
Stanford Police.
The woman suffered minor injuries,
though she was not sexually assaulted, police
said. The man did not use a weapon.
The attacker approached the woman from
behind after she left a trailer near Roble
Field, where she had been working on a pro
ject. The man forced the woman to the south
east corner of the field, where he demanded
her pants and underwear, according to police.
After attacking the woman, the man tied
in the direction of the parking structure on
Via Ortega with the woman's underwear.
A statement from police Capt. Raoul

Niemeyer described the assailant as "in his
early 20s, about 6 feet tall, medium build,
clean shaven with short, dark hair... wearing
a dark baseball cap and dark clothing."
Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo said that the incident serves as an
unfortunate reminder that even at Stanford,
students are vulnerable to criminal activity.
"I have to emphasize that the University
cannot guarantee a crime-free environment
since we literally do not restrict access to our
campus," Camarillo said. "It is open to the
community."
Camarillo explained that Res Ed works to
alert students of security risks on the campus
and alerts resident associates to crime pre
vention resources.
"What we need is the cooperation of stu-
dents as community members to
protect and look out for each other,
use the resources that are there for
students and solicit support from
the Stanford Police when they have
questions or observations of vulner
abilities to crime that we could cor
rect," she added.
At the same time Camarillo ac
knowledged that sometimes taking
safety precautions infringes on stu
dents' freedom.
"The student who was attacked
did nothing wrong," Camarillo said
in an e-mail.
"She was victimized by an inhu
mane and criminal act and person.
No one should have to take precau
tions to ensure personal safety
when traveling home on a residen
tial campus.
"We, however, must face the re
ality that when we leave our campus

open, we do assume more of a risk
and must take action to control our
own safety."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
commented that though the Uni
versity is very concerned about the
incident, for the most part he be
lieves that Stanford remains a safe
campus.
University programs, resources
and services — such as SURE Es
cort Service, the blue-light emer
gency safety phones and self-de
fense classes — help to promote
safety even further, Wais pointed
out.
"The incident serves as a re
minder that we are not insulated
from such events," Wais said. "In
and of itself it serves as a warning to
students and the entire University
community that we need to be vigi
lant regarding personal safety."
The attack occurred less than a
week after "Take Back the Night,"
a march to promote student safety
at night to combat assault.
