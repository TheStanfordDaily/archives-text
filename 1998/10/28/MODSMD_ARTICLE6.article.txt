# So long 'Good Life'
## Annual Stanford guide on hiatus this year 
### Christy Zenner 
Stanford students may live the good life, but
this year they won't have a guide.
" The Guide to the Good Life: Stanford,"
published and distributed annually until this
year, complied comprehensive information on
Bay Area restaurants, cafes, recreation, enter
tainment. shopping, careers and travel into one
potent package of non-academic information.
This year the guide has been noticeably ab
sent from dorm shelves across campus. Peter
Massik. a Graduate School of Business alum
nus and a co-founder of the guide, runs Good
Life Publications. The company, according to
Massik, has expanded its repertoire to encom
pass guides to many other Bay Area attractions.
"We've been busy on other projects and
haven't had time to get to Stanford. 'Good Life:
Stanford' is something of an orphan project; it is
our only publication with advertising," he said.
"It's more interesting, and more profitable,
for [Good Life] people to do new projects than
to keep doing Stanford," he added.
"'Bv delaying Stanford, we've been able to dou

blc our production schedule of other books."
Publishing the Stanford book is a "labor-in
tensive project,'" Massik said, because it re
quires soliciting advertisers. But Massik hesi
tates "to say that it'll never happen again... it's
sort of a legacy." The guide was Massik's first
publication and served as a catalyst for devel
oping Good Life Publications.
The guide's absence this year has left a no
ticeable void, according to Erie Toscano, direc
tor of the Stanford Directory. His publication
provides yellow-page style information on area
businesses but isn't a comprehensive guide
book to the Hay Area.
"We do compete with the 'Guide to the
Good Life' for advertisers," Toscano said. But
"if the 'Guide to the Good Life' is officially fin
ished here at Stanford, there will certainly be
new opportunities for the Directory."
Massik. however, isn't throwing in the towel.
"The bottom line is, I'd still like to find a
way" to publish a guide for Stanford. Ideally, he
said, he'd like to form a partnership with enter
prising Stanford students to continue the tradi
tion.
