It you have something to say
about dining services, the ASSU
wants to know.
At last night's meeting, the sen
ate voted unanimously to create a
dining task force that will prepare a
report 011 the subject for the sen
ate's next meeting.
"We're attempting to do some
thing the ASSU hasn't always suc

The senate also voted to create a
salaried Web projects director po

The ASSU has recently redone
its Web page and created an online
course guide.
"It's become apparent that to

Web projects director," President
Maren Norton said.
Junior Patrick Coffman, the
new Web projects director, has
served the ASSU "in an unofficial
capacity for the past two years,"
said Vice President Santos Marro
quin. "He's really dedicated â€” he's
done hundreds and hundreds of
hours of work for the ASSU."
"Every year, more and more
things are Web-based," continued
Marroquin, stressing the impor
