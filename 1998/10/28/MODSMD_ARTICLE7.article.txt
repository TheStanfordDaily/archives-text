## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl 
It you have something to say
about dining services, the ASSU
wants to know.
At last night's meeting, the sen
ate voted unanimously to create a
dining task force that will prepare a
report 011 the subject for the sen
ate's next meeting.
"We're attempting to do some
thing the ASSU hasn't always suc
ceeded in doing: providing realistic
solutions for problems that stu
dents have," said Deputy Senate
Chair Mike Levin, a sophomore
and an author of the task force bill.
The task force will distribute
surveys Thursday under student
doors in residences with dining
halls. The goal is to get as much stu
dent input as possible, so the com
mittee can present a report to Din
ing Services that addresses student
concerns, according to Levin.
"We're going to produce an in
credible report," said Levin. He
stressed that it was "imperative"
that the task force get feedback
from students. Once they receive
the surveys, the task force will com
pile the data this weekend.
Students frequently express
concerns about food service, ac

cording to Levin. Although the
ASSU wants to respond to those
concerns, he cautioned, dining ser
vices is a business, and there is a
limit to what the ASSU can do.
"We're not the be-all, end-all to
li\ everything, but we're trying to
make reasonable conclusions on
specific things," he said.
The senate also voted to create a
salaried Web projects director po
sition and to provide for the selec
tion of a Web projects develop
ment team.
The ASSU has recently redone
its Web page and created an online
course guide.
"It's become apparent that to
keep this going, we need to have a
Web projects director," President
Maren Norton said.
Junior Patrick Coffman, the
new Web projects director, has
served the ASSU "in an unofficial
capacity for the past two years,"
said Vice President Santos Marro
quin. "He's really dedicated — he's
done hundreds and hundreds of
hours of work for the ASSU."
"Every year, more and more
things are Web-based," continued
Marroquin, stressing the impor
tance of the ASSU Web site.
"We need to institutionalize the
importance of Web-based technol
ogy" by allocating money for a paid
director position.
The senate also created a new
opportunity for freshmen yester
day evening.
The Presidential Council con

sists of 10 freshmen who have al
ready been selected though an ex
tensive application process. The
goal of the program, according to
Marroquin, is "to bring freshman
representation into the Office of
the President."
The members of the council
help keep the president informed
about general issues on campus
and work on specific projects such
as the Introduction to the Humani
ties curriculum.

Marroquin referred to the mem
bers of the council as "our agents."
He hopes that this committee will
provide the freshmen with valuable
ASSIJ experience.
Finally, the senate voted to ap
propriate Program Board funds for
fall quarter.
The funding recommendations
had already been reviewed by the
board and the Appropriations
Committee and were approved last
night after a short debate.
