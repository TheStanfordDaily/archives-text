ast year Stanford Ice Hockey goalie Nick
Flores proved he was both a versatile and
valuable asset to the club. When his team
was short on position players, Flores played for
ward and scored the game-winning
goal against Oregon. The position
change worked so well for Flores
| that he will play forward again this
season in addition to sharing the
time in goal with Canadian Olympic
I team member Sammie Joe Small.
Flores, who grew up playing
hockey in Minnesota, is the pres
ident of Stanford Ice Hockey, one
of the most respected clubs on the
West Coast. The team was second in the Pac-10
last year after coming in first the previous two
years and going to the Club Hockey National
Tournament in St. Louis in '97. In addition, Stan
ford defeated Cal in their last six meetings and
beat the weenies in "Big Skate"
last year. Flores promises
more of the same when the V
