How Do
You Measure
the Growth
of A Child?,
Unfortunately for
children living in
some of the poorest
countries in the world,
it takes more than fading
marks on a wall.
Childreach, one of •
the oldest and largest ;
child sponsorship <
organizations,
measures growth by
the number of hospitals,
wells for clean water,
and self-help programs
we build in partnership
with the proud families
and communities
where our sponsored
children live.
So when you become
a Childreach sponsor
and receive pictures
and letters that speak of
hope, you'll know that
you have helped to make
a real difference in the
lives of a needy child,
family, and community
