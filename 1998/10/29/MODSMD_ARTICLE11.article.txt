Oi-ONDON (AP) —The High Court ruled
Wednesday that Augusto Pinochet is immune
frixn prosecution in British courts and ordered
the British government to pay the former
Chilean dictator's legal costs of $56().(KK).
, .The court threw out two Spanish arrest war
rants, acted upon by British authorities. The
warrants sought Pinochet's extradition to face
charges of murder, kidnapping and torturing
political opponents during his 17-year dictator
ship.
In his ruling. Lord Chief Justice Thomas
Bingham said it was "a matter for acute public
concern that those who abuse sovereign power
crimes against humanity should not
•£"st<rpe trial and appropriate punishment."
-"But nothing, including the charter that
established the International War Crimes Tri
bunal at Nuremberg in 1945, invalidated the
principle "that one sovereign state will not
impugn another in relation to its sovereign

acts," Bingham said.
In Madrid, lawyers trying to extradite
Pinochet to Spain criticized the British court
but said they remained hopeful that an appeals
court would eventually overturn the ruling.
"We were surprised by the ruling," said Vir
ginia Diaz, who has worked closely on the case.
She argues that international law clearly rules
out immunity in cases of crimes against human
ity. "We are not talking about a little bit of cor
ruption. but the killing, torture and disappear
ance of thousands of people."
To the joy of Chilean exiles, however, the
court ordered that Pinochet remain in custody
until an appeal by British prosecutors to the
1 louse of Lords.
Lawyers for the Spanish magistrate had
alleged that Pinochet was responsible for up to
4,(KK) murders, including at least one in the
United States, and had sent agents to Spain to
kill opponents there.
