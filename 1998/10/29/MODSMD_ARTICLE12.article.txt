# Democrats protest Republican ads
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats lashed out Wednesday
against a $10 million Republican ad campaign that makes an
issue out of the Monica Lewinsky scandal even as party leaders
struggled to raise money for a counterpunch.
Undeterred and flush with cash. Republicans planned to add
another TV spot to their arsenal, this one accusing President
Clinton of hiding behind "legal mumbo jumbo" in the Lewinsky
case.
Clinton complained at a news conference that Democrats are
"being very badly outspent" by Republicans, but he passed up a
chance to criticize their strategy. Republicans can "make the
election about whatever they want to make the election about,"
he said.
Said Vice President A 1 Gore: "Attacking the president and
investigating the president has apparently become an obsession
with the Republicans."
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in a confer
ence call with reporters, called the ads "a sign of what they
intend to do if we leave them in charge of the Congress, and that
is continue an open-ended, non-ending impeachment investiga
tion."
Republican Party spokeswoman Mary Crawford replied:
"The president is the head of their party. We strongly disagree
with his ideas and their party's ideas. This election is about their
ideas versus our ideas, and that's what these ads are about."
The National Republican Congressional Committee
launched 29 ads tailored for specific congressional districts plus
three multi-district ads. Those three ads blend talk of GOP
achievements with subtle but clear references to the Lewinsky

affair.
"For seven months he lied," a woman in one ad says. After a
discussion about GOP accomplishments, an announcer says,
"Republicans are the balance we need." Another ad running in
just three Southern congressional districts says, "Reward Bill
Clinton. Or, vote Republican." The most widely aired ad, the
most subtle of the three, includes an image of Clinton wagging
his finger at cameras as he denied the affair.
Republican strategists who helped produce the ads say the
campaign is not designed to make the election a referendum on
Clinton, who faces impeachment proceedings in November.
Instead, they hope to use the omnipresent scandal to amplify
their broader message: A Republican Congress is a check against
a Democratic president who can't be trusted.
"I'm very pleased that the Democrats are reacting as strong
as they are," said Rich Galen, head of GOPAC, a conservative
political action committee, and close to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. "It shows that these spots hit exactly the nerve
that reminds" Democrats that voters have concerns about Clin
ton.
Yet the strategy struck other GOP operatives as risky.
"I think people who are going to vote Republican because of
their distaste for the personal conduct of the president probably
made that decision some time ago," said GOP consultant Ralph
Reed.
In an Associated Press poll of 1,010 people from Oct. 21-25,
more than 60 percent of likely voters said Clinton would not be
a factor in their voting. More than half of Republicans registered
to vote said Clinton is not a factor.
