CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) —
The stakes are higher than ever for
NASA as it counts down the final hours to
John Glenn's heralded return to orbit on
Thursday, and the man in charge of space
flight knows it.
"As a person responsible for this mis
sion, 1 feel an awesome responsibility and
apprehension that everything goes well.
This is special," Joe Rothenberg said after
having lunch with the 77-year-old Glenn
on Wednesday.
As always, Rothenberg said, NASA
has done everything possible to ensure the
safety of space shuttle Discovery and its

seven-member crew. But the fact that one
of them is Glenn, the first American to
orbit the Earth and a senator for the past
24 years, has upped the ante if anything
goes wrong.
"Would it be any different from any
mission? Sure," Rothenberg said.
"Because like having a teacher on board,
it really has got very high visibility and an
awful lot of people would look at it as
something happening to an American
hero and we were part of the process."
Glenn was so beloved by America after
his 1962 flight, in fact, that President
Kennedy reportedly instructed NASA not

to fly him again — he didn't want to risk
the astronaut's life. Glenn never got to ask
Kennedy if this was true; the president
was dead by the time Glenn heard about
it.
Schoolchildren around the country will
be watching Glenn's return to space, just
as youngsters watched on Jan. 28, 1986,
when schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe
soared aboard Challenger. She and the six
others on board were killed when the
shuttle blew up 73 seconds into flight.
Up to a quarter-million people are
expected to converge on the area for a
glimpse of the launch.
