Notifying parents of alcohol
abuse will not change student
behavior or risk of injury

Undoubtedly, president
Clinton had our best interests in
mind when he signed the Higher
Education Act on Oct. 7. The bill contains
legislation that permits the University to
notify parents if students violate its alcohol
policy. However, we seriously question
whether reporting on students' activities
will have any effect on alcohol use on cam
pus.
Serious, life-threatening incidents result
ing from alcohol abuse have recently caught
public attention, and universities are facing
pressure to make sure students are respon
sible with alcohol. But the threat of having
one's parents briefed on weekend activities
is a weak deterrent to drinking.
More importantly, the parental notifica
tion threat would have done absolutely
nothing to prevent Michael Howard from
falling from a balcony. Nor would it have
saved the lite of the University of Michigan
student who fell from a window.
Parental notification is also not a univer
sity's best friend. Sooner or later, an angry
parent is going to sue an institution that
tails to exercise its ability to tell them about
their son's underage drinking ticket.
Ultimately, there is very little a universi
ty can do to stop students from drinking
enough Id hurt themselves. Dry residences
won't stop people from leaving and drink
ing elsewhere or just living somewhere

drinking is allowed. Cracking down on alco
hol at parties just pushes the problem
underground, and individuals in dorm
rooms can do just as much damage as a
huge group draining a keg. Mandating a
harsh alcohol policy could chase students to
bars off campus, increasing the risk that
someone will get seriously injured while
driving under the influence.
Drinking is not a new phenomenon on
college campuses. Some of our parents
went to college, too; it is hard to believe that
none of them ever touched a drop while
they were students. They probably don't
like to think about it, but our activities are
usually no worse than theirs were. And
they're probably glad we're away at college
so they don't have to witness us doing the
same kinds of things they did. How many of
them actually want to hear about their
daughter's drinking binges? They can repri
mand her, but that's probably not going to
stop her.
We must remember that students go to
universities in part to learn how to be
responsible adults. Our academic records
are restricted, and nobody calls our parents
if we're failing classes. This is because the
University believes our academic choices
are our own, and we must deal with the con
sequences of those choices. Similarly, we
make our own choices about alcohol, and
we must also deal with the consequences of
those choices. Suffering from alcohol poi
soning may be a far more serious conse
quence than failing Chem 35. But sooner or
later, we will all leave Stanford and the cau
tious supervision Congress would like to
create. Who will tell us then when we've
had too much to drink?
