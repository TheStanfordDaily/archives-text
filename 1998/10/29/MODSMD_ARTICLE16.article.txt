# John Davi
## An English lesson in tolerance 
### 
I'M CERTAINLY not
the world's most toler
ant person. God
knows I try to remain
understanding and accept
ing of different convic
tions and beliefs, but —
I'll finally admit it — I'm

not the perfect human being. I'm really not.
You heard it here first.
They say acceptance is the first step
toward rehabilitation, so it appears I'm fast
on my way to flawlessness. Before I reach
that state, however, I'm using this space to
announce my shortcomings. To expound
upon my narrow-mindedness. To reveal
the prejudice that shapes my very being. In
this column I will open my heart with the
hope that I will be accepted despite my
imperfections. Please be merciful.
I, John Davi, have a bad English intoler
ance. Not for the Bad English headbangers
of the 1980s, but for the grammar mistakes
that plague every day speech. Like most
Stanford students, I bristle at inappropriate
sentence structure or mismatched modi
fiers, but my intolerance goes beyond the
basic rule violations. I have a deep hatred
of incorrect colloquialisms that overuse has
somehow made acceptable. Let me high
light some examples for you.
Sherbet
Are you familiar with this popular
frozen dessert? Of course you are. In this
era of increased health awareness, every
one knows that sherbet is nature's low-fat
alternative to full-blown ice cream. But
how do you pronounce it? Go ahead, say it

out loud — I'll wait. Did you say "sherbet"
or "sher-bert"? I bet you said the latter,
adding an extra "r" where it clearly didn't
belong. Look at the spelling and try it
again. Correctly pronounced, "sherbet''
sounds like "hermit," "Kermit" or "Go
ahead and pet the skunk, John. You won't
disturb it." The wildly incorrect "sherbert"
only further hastens the steady dumbing
down of America. Let's get our heads out
of our asses, okay?
Gummi Bears
I'm going to lose a lot of support with
this one, but here goes. Originally a prod
uct of Germany, these confectionery
delights have had their name bastardized in
the English translation and are often
labeled "gummy bears." Furthermore,
according to German — the official lan
guage of Germany — "gummi" is pro
nounced so as to rhyme with "roomy" or
"sock it to me." In nearly every English
pronunciation of these loveable candy
creatures, however, Americans display
their cultural ignorance by rhyming with
"yummy" or "crummy." Crummy, indeed.
"I'm Done" vs. 'Tm Finished"
"I'm done" is commonly heard through
out campus and the world. "Have you
worked on your problem set, Sarah?" I'll
often ask my friends (usually the ones
named Sarah). "Yes, John," they'll
respond, "I'm done." "Oh," I say. "Damn."
Homework jealousies aside, the phrase
"I'm done" is grammatically incorrect. This
is according to my grandmother, a veritable
Jedi of the English language. As she so elo

quently puts it, "Food is done, but people
are finished." Think about it. Cook a roast
for three hours, and the roast is "done." It's
fully cooked. Do your problem set a week
early and you are "finished." The problem
set is done, but you are merely finished.
You, yourself, are not done (and you can't
blame this one on Stanford s lack of dat
ing).
Before I sicken myself with further illus
trations of our society's bad English, I
digress. By no means am I proud of my
intolerance. My time at Stanford has taught
me the importance of diversity and accep
tance, but I have been unable to apply tjhis
learning to my own prejudice. I simply can
not hold my tongue when these above
examples emerge. I become enraged, sick
at the sound of our collective ignoraijce. I
am the living, breathing incarnate of intol
erance.
Despite the baring of my soul, I hope
you will accept the somewhat intolerant
man that I am. Though my spoken English
may be on a higher plane of existence than
the rest of the world, 1 am but a simple
human with obvious imperfections. If you.
however, cannot bear to endure my intoler
ance, at least you can relish in one truth:
you have reached the end of my column.
Finally, I'm done.

John and his grandma (hi Gram), both intol
erant of bad English, find much solace in
talking only to one another. They point out
that "sherbet" is misspelled at the Tresidder
Jamba Juice. John is a senior majoring in
public policy.
