Save Toyon eating clubs
1 he Stanford Eating Clubs (SEC) have
been scheduled lor oblivion. In 2001, its
buildings will be demolished and its lease
will expire. To save the Eating Clubs, we
need to make a case for the SEC that our
administration will understand.
Only to protest will not achieve our
goals. We must understand that our
administration has a vision of Stanford
University that transcends the needs of
individuals. I may bitch in 1999, we may
moan in 2001. but in 2(X)5 we will all be
gone. I'his distant-sighted vision gives our
administration the flexibility to move for
ward with changes it feels are in the long
run interest of the University. In some
ways, this is a good thing. But it makes our
task more difficult because we must make
empathetic arguments for our causes. Wc
must reach out and persuade our adminis
tration with its own language. To achieve
our goal, we must convince our adminis
tration that our goals are also its goals.
Fortunately, preserving the eating
clubs is a goal we all should share. Stu
dents love the SEC because it provides an
excellent dining environment, social activ
ities. and rewarding leadership opportuni
ties. The administration should love the
SEC because it provides an invaluable
choice for students. Within the heart of
everv administrator, I am sure, is an inner

economist who knows that quality variety
spells value. It is a rule of economics: if we
ever have two successful institutions serv
ing the same function (dining) but in very
different contexts or in very different
ways, we will be better off with the quality
variety. Some consumers (students) will
prefer the first, others will prefer the sec
ond. But if we have choice, we will all be
better off. To merge the institutions or to
force one to transform its practices would
callously disregard a source of value.
For the sake of choice and value, the
eating clubs deserve to survive. If we
make this message clear, I am confident
that we will change the mind of our
administration. Sometimes that adminis
tration may seem unapproachable or
hardened in a cause against our own. But
within the heart of hearts of every admin
istrator, I am sure, is an inner economist.

Student athletes succeed
After reading the letter written by
Audrey Leung in last Thursday's Daily, I
was discouraged to see that yet again,
someone focused on the negative minority
instead of the overwhelmingly positive

influence the Athletics Department has
on the Stanford community.
During my years as a Stanford student
athlete, I observed situations such as the
defacing of the "Gay Liberation" statue
with disppointment. Stanford is diverse.
With any group on campus, a certain
minority is bound to make poor choices.
Regardless of the punishment received by
these athletes, Stanford student athletes in
no way get to "play by their own rules."
I am not going to try to convince Leung
of the unique challenges faced by Stanford
student athletes. Undoubtedly, she would
remind me of the many outstanding stu
dents who face different challenges. How
ever, in her haste to condemn the Athlet
ics Department over one decision and the
ill-advised actions of a few, Leung ignores
the tremendous contributions the depart
ment makes to the University community
and that most athletes make to the aca
demic circles in which they travel.
I am sorry Leung never interacted with
or heard about the Rhodes scholar nomi
nees, the world-class athletes without the
full scholarships, the athletes who use
their athletic fifth year to get an addition
al degree, or the sharp rise in applications
enjoyed by the University following the
success of its teams. I wish she had the
chance to see athletes studying as hard as
she did, but with a national championship
final in two hours, or the Olympic medal
ists she probably did not even knew com

peted because they were so well adjusted
nto her residential community.
My four years of athletic participation
alongside a long list of outstanding indi
viduals only enhanced my appreciation for
he quality of students here.
For every "embarrassment" Leung feel
he Athletics Department brings to Stan
ord, I urge her in the future to pay atten
ion the assets it provides to the communi
y from which she too has benefitted.

Take disorders seriously
I am writing in response to Brittney
Jensen's column, "Repeat after me: Are
you fat? Just say no," in yesterday's Daily.
The column's title and its final message
encourage women to have a positive body
mage, but the rest of it takes a dangerously
casual stance on what is an important issue
at Stanford, and everywhere else.
Jensen is more concerned with fitting in
with her friends than worrying if they might
have a problem. She is worried that her
riends will not like her unless she partic
pates in putting down her own body. She
says she has witnessed eating disorders in
dancers and concentrates on the supposed
glamor and competition involved. She sug
gests that without having an eating disorder,

one cannot enjoy Mademoiselle and Cos
mopolitan. And she excludes Stanford from
the world of anorexia saying, "Fortunately,
Stanford seems too intelligent to embrace
the celebration of self-destruction "
The truth is that anorexia and other eat
ing disorders are a huge issue at Stanford,
only they are ignored. It is not an issue of
Stanford's "intelligence;" eating disorders
are often found among the most intelligent
and ambitious women. Stanford's students
and administration have continually
ignored the issue of eating disorders. The
Daily also can be included in this pattern —
there was a small, unresearched article last
week hidden on page 12.
The main message I got from Jensen
was, "Whine about being too skinny and
other girls are more likely to be annoyed
than sympathetic." What about putting
annoyance aside and helping out your
friends? People have eating disorders on
this campus, and they need help.
Jensen brought up an important issue
and then dismissed it, without taking a
responsible position on eating disorders.
Bringing up the quality of the SAEs for the
third week in a row may be interesting to
some, but perhaps the Daily could find
columnists who write responsibly on the
topics they choose, something Wednesday's
column made no serious attempt to do.
