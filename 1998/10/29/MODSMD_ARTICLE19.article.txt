						six-figure education with no answers

Vanessa Bartsch

A SEA OF chaos with no relief in
sight. Flesh pressing flesh. Flashy
tables tended by identically
dressed duos peddling their gimmicky gilts
sized packets of numbers
and'figures with glossy covers and shiny
gold leafing.
<IVly bicycle and l rammed our way
•through the Career Fair on the way to the
only morning class I attend. Again, on my
foaV'home for lunch, I shivered as l wove
my'way in and out of the well-dressed
seniors giving it their all.
• 'It wasn't just the throng of people con
suming all available space that made me
uneasy. It was the suffocating feeling of the
cftfomity known as senior indecision gnaw
'mg'at my toes. The feeling that for the first
tftne'at this school. I didn't belong.
1 stopped by the Bookstore and grabbed
a'-rmtp of the event to see what was out
Blah Blah Technologies, Sum a me
Srtd Surname Consulting, Old Guy Sneed
leV Investments all laid neatly out over
White Plaza.
■ ' And very cleverly divided, may 1 add. I
baiVkinu, and consulting bv the missing

Thinker. The service jobs, both of them, at
the bottom. And technology jobs consum
ing the other four acres.
After 10 minutes of hearty deliberation,
I stopped and U-locked my vehicle to a
brimming recycling bin stuffed with reject
ed opportunities.
I thought for another 10 minutes before
I decided to descend and actually take on
the fair, 10,000 to 1. But. unlike all those
"don't-sell-outers" who claim they only go
to get free shit. 1 am woman enough to
admit that I did not go to collect those free
sparkly cups for my house. I did not go
because I was out of pens. I did not go to get
nutty about slinkies and squishv logo toys.
1 went because I am 21. Because 1 am a
senior about to embark on a new path.
Because I wanted to explore my options.
Because 1 don't have a job.
But unlike my dressed-to-impress
friends who were cavorting around with
boxes of resumes, there was just me in my
jeans and flip-flops.
I quickly bypassed 75 percent of the fair
because I can barely use the Macintosh I
typed this column on. Then 1 lost the next

bunch in the investment world to the fact
that I am almost failing my math DR. (Of
course, that could have something to do
with the fact that the class is at 9 a.m.. but
let's not go there.)
Then I was left with consulting. Or the
military, but 1 really don't take orders well.
So I stood in the middle of the tables
looking around. Everyone else there had a
mission. People bee-lined from one table to
the next knowing exactly what they wanted,
which companies shine with prestige, where
to get the most money.
Hut not me. I just stood there, unable to
uproot my feet from the safety of anonymi
ty. 1 could just picture the ugly scene:
"Hi there! So you are interested in
Father and Grandfather Consulting! Good
GPA. Young, energetic and clever. Yes,
yes! Willing to work hard! Oh we love that!
Here is our informa .. . wait ... oh
dear ... oh my ... excuse me, you are a
what? Oh. dear I am so sorry about the mis
understanding. but we just don't take your
kind here. 1 mean we can't. We don't. You
see, we just have no use for a music major.
But good luck ... and here's a pen."

This career fair, this event created to give
a graduating senior a hopeful vision of what
is to come, didn't even hold a glimpse for
me. Nothing but frustration and even a bit
of envy for those that know what it is that
they want to do to make their money, build
their career, find their fulfillment.
Still, I thought, what about me? What do
I do? I am passionate about music. Playing
it, studying it, and especially writing it make
me feel alive. I don't want to do it just for
fun. Or on Sundays. Or after 60 hours a
week. But no one is standing behind a table
just waiting for me to approach.
I've looked everywhere for answers. The
CDC can't help me. My department posts
fellowships and grad schools, but grad
school isn't my next logical step. Not after
16 years of sitting in classes, going to work
or practice, managing my personal life and
at the end of every 10 weeks frantically
scrapping it together for one more quarter.
But the people whom I have ferreted out
for advice tell me there are only four
options. You take a job with a Big Three
company: technologies, banking, or consult
ing. Or, you go to grad school in an attempt

to figure out what you want to do, and then
find a job. Or if you are not ready after your
master's, you just plow on through, get a
doctorate, become a professor and thereby
remain immersed in what ever it is you love
to study and eventually get paid for doing it.
But for me, school, school and more
school without a break leaves very little
time to live. Here, at Stanford, at this mecca
of beautiful sun and beautiful people, I
can't seem to manage to find time to even
sleep enough. This pace is no way to spend
a lifetime.
So there must be another answer. But
even after this six-figure education, I still
don't know what it is, which makes me won
der what I have been doing for four years.
It's making me wonder where am 1 going to
go, making me wonder why I didn't listen to
my high school music teacher and either
major in economics or learn how to weld.

who loves her parents, but is apprehensive
about what sort of roommates they might
make.
