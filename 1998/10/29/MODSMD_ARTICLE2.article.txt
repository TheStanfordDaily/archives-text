# New Dining Services policies deplete SPOON's food supply
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Due to changes in dining services
policies. University Dining Services,
which donated the bulk of Spoon
Hunger Relief Network's food, is no
longer participating in the program.
As a result, the 250 meals per week
that Spoon used to provide for the
Urban Ministry program have been
greatly cut down.
"We found out that they were
stopping out dorm by dorm," said se
nior Phoebe Grow, volunteer coordi
nator of Spoon. "We did pick-ups at
Wilbur and Stern at the beginning of
the year, and all of them participated
over the summer, but all of a sudden
we were told that they were not par
ticipating in the program anymore
and it was a University-wide policy."
Dining Services stopped its partic
ipation in the Spoon program be
cause it is implementing many new
programs to cut down on the amount
of waste produced by individual
kitchens in order to save money.
Until this year. Dining Services
used to donate all of its unrecyclable
waste to Spoon, a campus organiza
tion that collects unused food from
dining halls around campus and
brings it to a shelter for underprivi
leged members of the Palo Alto com
munity.
Spoon, which has existed on the
Stanford campus since 1987, provid-

with 9() percent of the food it serves at
its daily "breaking bread" meals. Ac
cording to the Spoon handbook, "last
year, Stanford eating establishments
donated over 25,(XX) pounds (approx
imately 24,(XX) meals) of f00d... the
majority [of which] came from large
dining halls like Flo Mo, Wilbur,
Stern, Lagunita and Ricker."
In regards to the Spoon program.
Executive Chef Rafi Taherian said,
"Our missions are actually very close.
We both want to control the waste of
food. But our objective at Dining
Services is to do this in order to con
trol the cost of our operations.
"In the past. Spoon was an ongo
ing program and so this created an
environment of expectations for our
managers. It created the assumption
that there should always be left
overs." Dining Services no longer
wants this to be the case.
Instead, it has started many new
programs in dining halls to help re
duce waste by reusing uneaten food.
The new policy is to not produce mas
sive amounts of food before Dining
Services sees how many students
have shown up to eat a meal. The
amount of cooking is based upon de
mand, not estimated and then pre
prepared. Dining Services wants to
produce small amounts of food closer
to eating times for "better quality and

freshness of food and because it is a
good way to control waste," Taherian
said.
The individual managers of each
dining hall are instructed to use as
much of the leftover food as they can
to make new and exciting entrees for
the students. "Any animal-based
product should be used to make
soups," Taherian suggested.
He also mentioned that the chefs
have begun an exhibition cooking
program where the food is cooked
to-order right in front of the stu
dents.
Any excess that is produced by a
dining hall will be attributed to the
manager. "There will be staff that
purposely produces more food for
charity, but, in these cases, the man
agers will be held responsible," Asso
ciate Director of Housing and Dining
Services Shirley Everett said. Dining
Services greatly discourages their
management from cooking any more
than is necessary to feed students, she
said.
These programs are designed to
accomplish Dining Services' new
mission. "Our mission is to serve the
students on our meal plans," Everett
said. "In that way, we have to ensure
that Stanford students receive the
best quality of food possible and that
our practices are the most fiscally re
sponsible. We minimize waste be
cause, if we can reuse food, then we
will do that as opposed to throwing or
giving it away."
She stressed that Dining Services
is in no way opposed to assisting char
itable organizations. "Spoon is a
great organization, I applaud them
for their efforts," she said, "but, on

the other hand, charitable organiza
tions should understand the mission
of Dining Services as well. It is our
objective to best serve the students,
our customers, and it would be wrong
of us to meet the needs of charitable
organizations by sacrificing the qual
ity of the service we provide to the
students."
Grow understands that Dining
Services is making a lot of changes
that will affect the amount of food
that is available for donations to
Spoon. "These changes will take
time. There is a limit to what they can
do right now," she said. "There is still
food available for us. If there's no
food — fine, we just won t have any.
But, I suspect there is more food out
there than they're letting on."
Grow emphasized that Spoon will
take any donation whatsoever.
"Urban Ministry is dependent upon
us and everything helps. Dining Ser
vices serves hundreds of people every
day, and we only feed 50. They
should be able to do something.'"
Spoon does receive food from
other places. The Faculty Club, Spe
cial Events, Toyon Eating Clubs and
the Row have all been regular con
tributors to Spoon. Grow was very
pleased with the participation of indi
vidually run student dining establish
ments and encouraged greater in
volvement. "It's especially important
for every house that can to partic
ipate in this intermediate time when
we're not getting food from Dining
Services," she said.
Spoon amasses over 100 volun
teers yearly who help collect and de
liver the food to the Urban Ministry.
Narnia kitchen manager Katie
Caldwell described her previous ex
periences with Spoon as very worth
while. "It definitely was incredibly
useful for two reasons. One, it's nice

to donate food and it solves a Iqlo,
the space issues that we have iqnpUr

Hunger Relief Network's food, is no
longer participating in the program.
As a result, the 250 meals per week
that Spoon used to provide for the
Urban Ministry program have been
greatly cut down.
"We found out that they were
stopping out dorm by dorm," said se
nior Phoebe Grow, volunteer coordi
nator of Spoon. "We did pick-ups at
Wilbur and Stern at the beginning of
the year, and all of them participated
over the summer, but all of a sudden
we were told that they were not par
ticipating in the program anymore
and it was a University-wide policy."
Dining Services stopped its partic
ipation in the Spoon program be
cause it is implementing many new
programs to cut down on the amount
of waste produced by individual
kitchens in order to save money.
Until this year. Dining Services
used to donate all of its unrecyclable
waste to Spoon, a campus organiza
tion that collects unused food from
dining halls around campus and
brings it to a shelter for underprivi
leged members of the Palo Alto com
munity.
Spoon, which has existed on the
Stanford campus since 1987, provid-

Ed the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto
with 9() percent of the food it serves at
its daily "breaking bread" meals. Ac
cording to the Spoon handbook, "last
year, Stanford eating establishments
donated over 25,(XX) pounds (approx
imately 24,(XX) meals) of f00d... the
majority [of which] came from large
dining halls like Flo Mo, Wilbur,
Stern, Lagunita and Ricker."
In regards to the Spoon program.
Executive Chef Rafi Taherian said,
"Our missions are actually very close.
We both want to control the waste of
food. But our objective at Dining
Services is to do this in order to con
trol the cost of our operations.
"In the past. Spoon was an ongo
ing program and so this created an
environment of expectations for our
managers. It created the assumption
that there should always be left
overs." Dining Services no longer
wants this to be the case.
Instead, it has started many new
programs in dining halls to help re
duce waste by reusing uneaten food.
The new policy is to not produce mas
sive amounts of food before Dining
Services sees how many students
have shown up to eat a meal. The
amount of cooking is based upon de
mand, not estimated and then pre
prepared. Dining Services wants to
produce small amounts of food closer
to eating times for "better quality and

freshness of food and because it is a
good way to control waste," Taherian
said.
The individual managers of each
dining hall are instructed to use as
much of the leftover food as they can
to make new and exciting entrees for
the students. "Any animal-based
product should be used to make
soups," Taherian suggested.
He also mentioned that the chefs
have begun an exhibition cooking
program where the food is cooked
to-order right in front of the stu
dents.
Any excess that is produced by a
dining hall will be attributed to the
manager. "There will be staff that
purposely produces more food for
charity, but, in these cases, the man
agers will be held responsible," Asso
ciate Director of Housing and Dining
Services Shirley Everett said. Dining
Services greatly discourages their
management from cooking any more
than is necessary to feed students, she
said.
These programs are designed to
accomplish Dining Services' new
mission. "Our mission is to serve the
students on our meal plans," Everett
said. "In that way, we have to ensure
that Stanford students receive the
best quality of food possible and that
our practices are the most fiscally re
sponsible. We minimize waste be
cause, if we can reuse food, then we
will do that as opposed to throwing or
giving it away."
She stressed that Dining Services
is in no way opposed to assisting char
itable organizations. "Spoon is a
great organization, I applaud them
for their efforts," she said, "but, on

the other hand, charitable organiza
tions should understand the mission
of Dining Services as well. It is our
objective to best serve the students,
our customers, and it would be wrong
of us to meet the needs of charitable
organizations by sacrificing the qual
ity of the service we provide to the
students."
Grow understands that Dining
Services is making a lot of changes
that will affect the amount of food
that is available for donations to
Spoon. "These changes will take
time. There is a limit to what they can
do right now," she said. "There is still
food available for us. If there's no
food — fine, we just won t have any.
But, I suspect there is more food out
there than they're letting on."
Grow emphasized that Spoon will
take any donation whatsoever.
"Urban Ministry is dependent upon
us and everything helps. Dining Ser
vices serves hundreds of people every
day, and we only feed 50. They
should be able to do something.'"
Spoon does receive food from
other places. The Faculty Club, Spe
cial Events, Toyon Eating Clubs and
the Row have all been regular con
tributors to Spoon. Grow was very
pleased with the participation of indi
vidually run student dining establish
ments and encouraged greater in
volvement. "It's especially important
for every house that can to partic
ipate in this intermediate time when
we're not getting food from Dining
Services," she said.
Spoon amasses over 100 volun
teers yearly who help collect and de
liver the food to the Urban Ministry.
Narnia kitchen manager Katie
Caldwell described her previous ex
periences with Spoon as very worth
while. "It definitely was incredibly
useful for two reasons. One, it's nice

to donate food and it solves a Iqlo,
the space issues that we have iqnpUr
kitchen. And two, it's nice to $Hpv\
that edible food is going somevffif'rc

"At each meal, a hall the of
