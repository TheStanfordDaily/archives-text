# New Dining Services policies deplete SPOON's food supply

Due to changes in dining services
policies. University Dining Services,
which donated the bulk of Spoon
Hunger Relief Network's food, is no
longer participating in the program.
As a result, the 250 meals per week
that Spoon used to provide for the
Urban Ministry program have been
greatly cut down.
"We found out that they were
stopping out dorm by dorm," said se
nior Phoebe Grow, volunteer coordi
nator of Spoon. "We did pick-ups at
Wilbur and Stern at the beginning of
the year, and all of them participated
over the summer, but all of a sudden
we were told that they were not par
ticipating in the program anymore
and it was a University-wide policy."
Dining Services stopped its partic
ipation in the Spoon program be
cause it is implementing many new
programs to cut down on the amount
of waste produced by individual
kitchens in order to save money.
Until this year. Dining Services
used to donate all of its unrecyclable
waste to Spoon, a campus organiza
tion that collects unused food from
dining halls around campus and
brings it to a shelter for underprivi
leged members of the Palo Alto com
munity.
Spoon, which has existed on the
Stanford campus since 1987, provid-

Ed the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto
with 9() percent of the food it serves at
its daily "breaking bread" meals. Ac
cording to the Spoon handbook, "last
year, Stanford eating establishments
donated over 25,(XX) pounds (approx
imately 24,(XX) meals) of f00d... the
majority [of which] came from large
dining halls like Flo Mo, Wilbur,
Stern, Lagunita and Ricker."
In regards to the Spoon program.
Executive Chef Rafi Taherian said,
"Our missions are actually very close.
We both want to control the waste of
food. But our objective at Dining
Services is to do this in order to con
trol the cost of our operations.
"In the past. Spoon was an ongo
ing program and so this created an
environment of expectations for our
managers. It created the assumption
that there should always be left
overs." Dining Services no longer
wants this to be the case.
Instead, it has started many new
programs in dining halls to help re
duce waste by reusing uneaten food.
The new policy is to not produce mas
sive amounts of food before Dining
Services sees how many students
have shown up to eat a meal. The
amount of cooking is based upon de
mand, not estimated and then pre
prepared. Dining Services wants to
produce small amounts of food closer
to eating times for "better quality and
