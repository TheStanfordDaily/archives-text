## Fourth and inches Phoenix Five not quite 'Immortal' 
### 
Gil Lopez

It's a sad day on the Farm. The
Stanford Free — the costume, not
person, just in case you've
Ipeen living under a rock — is sup
posedly in the hands of a group of
from UC-Berkeley who
calling themselves the
1 Phoenix Five."

Yet another chapter has been
added to the long and storied tra
dition that is the Stanford-Cal ri
yalry. By the time this whole kid
napping situation is over, the
Phoenix Five will he to Cal what
the Immortal 21 are to Stanford.
! We 11... not exactly,
j Cal can beat us in many ways.
When it comes to thievery, brute
savagery and idiocy, they take the
title every time. Just look at last
year's attack on our goalpost or
19%'s mutilation of the Tree cos
tjume if you don't believe me.
i But there is one arena in which
Cal can never top Stanford: a bat
tle of wits. (Actually, they also
have yet to prove to me that they
£an beat us on the football field,
but that's a story for another col
umn.)
1 The Phoenix Five couldn't be
I
happy with just having the cos
tume. They could have gone down
in the history books as legends of
bear lore. Their photos could
I

have run with the caption "We've
got the tree — anyone got an
Axe?"
But that wasn't enough. They
had to try and be creative. They
had to draw attention to them
selves by releasing press state
ments and photos of a blindfolded
Tree. They had to steal the spot
light.
In order to try and humiliate
us, they stated that they actually
liberated the Tree, and that he's
happier in the East Bay.
According It) the Daily Cali
fornian, Cal's student newspaper,
the Tree claims that he "has
learned the value of work, diversi
ty and spirit while on the UC-
Berkeley campus." The Tree also
allegedly "asked" one of the
Phoenix Five why Cal students'
"skins are different colors."
Don't worry. Tree. Now that
the University of California has
axed affirmative action, skin
tones should become more ho
mogenous in the coming years.
After all, diversity may be impor
tant, but they'd hate to level the
playing field for people who grew
up underprivileged academically.
(God knows Stanford could
use more diversity. I'm actually
white. The name "Gil Lopez" and
the mug shot were stolen from
files at Chico State.)
And if you want spirit, Cal's is
definitely resilient to say the least.
If I had to spend the past 107 years
in Stanford's shadow, my spirit
would have broken long ago.
Maybe a stay at Cal is actually
what the Tree needs. The poor


Gil
Lopez
guy has spent his entire life within
the realm of Stanford Athletics. A
vacation in Berkeley can open his
eyes to new experiences, such as
excessively large doses of failure
and a character-building inferiority
complex.
But now the Phoenix Five are on
the horns of a dilemma. UC-Berke
ley Chancellor Robert Berdahl has
stated that Oski, the Cal "Bear,"
would not be allowed to appear at
Saturday's Cal-Oregon football
game if the Tree wasn't returned to
the Farm by midnight last night.
Personally, I hope the Tree de
cides to extend his trans-Bay visit
through November. That way at
Big Game we'd be spared from the
presence of Oski, who's about as
animated and entertaining as one
of the Cal marching band's half
time shows. Come on Tree, do it for

your school. Deliver us from having
to put up with that goose-stepping,
groundhog-looking fleabag.
But I digress. The important
thing here is the nature of this theft.
It was not cool and calculated. It
wasn't the work of a criminal mas
termind. As the Phoenix Five put it,
it was a "crime of opportunity."
This is Cal-speak for "We got
lucky."
In 1930, the Immortal 21 had to
plot and plan for the retaking of the
Axe, which Cal brought out of its
vault about as often as Halley's
Comet appears. Disguised as re
porters, members of the 21 were
able to convince Berkeley students
to pose for a photo with the Axe,
and other members snuck into the
shot, pretending to be Cal fans.
After explosions of flash powder
and tear gas, the Axe was back at
Stanford and Big Game history was
forever changed.
In direct contrast, the Phoenix
Five came to Stanford lookinp for

"signs or banners" that they could
take — a mission of destiny if I've
ever heard one — and saw the Tree
head to the Band Shak after Cardi
nal Chaos on Oct. 16. After break
ing into the Shak — which has all
the security measures of a hamster
cage — they had moved from petty
larceny and vandalism to felony
theft. Not exactly the stuff of leg
ends.
Now I'm not endorsing the use
of tear gas — mind you, I'm not
condemning it either — but while
the taking of the Tree is a great
strike against the Farm, the
Phoenix Five have failed in trying
to make it the glorious victory it
could have been for Cal.
And if rumors that the costume
has already been incinerated are
true, they're just plain buffoons.
You don't destroy a trophy, you put
it on display. But I guess Cal's ex
perience with trophies falls far
short of Stanford's, so I can under
stand the confusion.

But I must commend Cal for
what it has pulled off. Some people
would consider it childish and crim
inal; I think it's just a harmless
prank in a long tradition which has
seen much worse acts. And it defi
nitely is a "W" for the Cal side.
If I had a hold of Oski, I'd march
around campus with his head on a
pike. I'd have students throughout
the campus come out and join in a
1984-esque "Two-Minute Hate"
and remember that while Cal stu
dents are people too, a big part of
the Stanford experience is celebrat
ing our athletic superiority over the
Bears.
It's sophomoric and it's childish.
But it's not hurting anyone and it's
all in good fun.
After all, there's a new Tree cos
tume every year. There's only one
Axe.

"Gil Lopez" will give his basketball
press pass to anyone who brings him
Oski's head on a silver platter.
