## Fourth and inches Phoenix Five not quite 'Immortal' 
### 
Gil Lopez

It's a sad day on the Farm. The
Stanford Free — the costume, not
person, just in case you've
Ipeen living under a rock — is sup
posedly in the hands of a group of
from UC-Berkeley who
calling themselves the
1 Phoenix Five."

Yet another chapter has been
added to the long and storied tra
dition that is the Stanford-Cal ri
yalry. By the time this whole kid
napping situation is over, the
Phoenix Five will he to Cal what
the Immortal 21 are to Stanford.
! We 11... not exactly,
j Cal can beat us in many ways.
When it comes to thievery, brute
savagery and idiocy, they take the
title every time. Just look at last
year's attack on our goalpost or
19%'s mutilation of the Tree cos
tjume if you don't believe me.
i But there is one arena in which
Cal can never top Stanford: a bat
tle of wits. (Actually, they also
have yet to prove to me that they
£an beat us on the football field,
but that's a story for another col
umn.)
1 The Phoenix Five couldn't be
I
happy with just having the cos
tume. They could have gone down
in the history books as legends of
bear lore. Their photos could
I

have run with the caption "We've
got the tree — anyone got an
Axe?"
But that wasn't enough. They
had to try and be creative. They
had to draw attention to them
selves by releasing press state
ments and photos of a blindfolded
Tree. They had to steal the spot
light.
In order to try and humiliate
us, they stated that they actually
liberated the Tree, and that he's
happier in the East Bay.
According It) the Daily Cali
fornian, Cal's student newspaper,
the Tree claims that he "has
learned the value of work, diversi
ty and spirit while on the UC-
Berkeley campus." The Tree also
allegedly "asked" one of the
Phoenix Five why Cal students'
"skins are different colors."
Don't worry. Tree. Now that
the University of California has
axed affirmative action, skin
tones should become more ho
mogenous in the coming years.
After all, diversity may be impor
tant, but they'd hate to level the
playing field for people who grew
up underprivileged academically.
(God knows Stanford could
use more diversity. I'm actually
white. The name "Gil Lopez" and
the mug shot were stolen from
files at Chico State.)
And if you want spirit, Cal's is
definitely resilient to say the least.
If I had to spend the past 107 years
in Stanford's shadow, my spirit
would have broken long ago.
Maybe a stay at Cal is actually
what the Tree needs. The poor
