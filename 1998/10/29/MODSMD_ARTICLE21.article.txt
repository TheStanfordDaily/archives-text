"It would be great to get a lot of
fans," said head coach Wally Good

know that admission is free."

MEN'S GOLF
■ Tomorrow-Sunday: The Nelson
all day. Stanford Golf Course.

Those who venture out to the
Stanford Golf Course for the Nelson
Invitational will see a Stanford squad
that has recently entered the top 25
after finishing in the top four places
in each of its first three tournaments.
The Cardinal is coming off its sec
ond straight fourth-place finish at the
Wolfpack Classic two weeks ago and
is playing well. Stanford also finished
fourth at the Windon Memorial
Classic on Oct. ft. Although the Car
dinal faltered in the final round of
both tournaments after strong per
formances in the opening rounds, se
nior captain Joel Kribel sees reason
to be optimistic about this year's
squad.
"The team's doing a lot better
than last year. Each tournament
we've had a chance to win but we
haven't quite got it done," said Kri
bel.
Much of the Cardinal's success
this year is due to the tact that its top
four golfers have consistently turned
in solid performances.
"Last year, we had to take a lot of
high scores in with our team total.

This year, our top four have played
really well," said Kribel.
Stanford has been paced by se
nior and two-time All-American
Kribel, who has finished in the top 10
in each of the team's tournaments.
But Kribel is not the only Cardinal
golfer who has turned in an impres
sive season.
Sophomore Jimmy Lee has
emerged as a force for the Cardinal
and looks to be the next great Stan
ford golfer. Lee has finished in the
top 17 in each of Stanford's tourna
ments and turned in his best perfor
mance of the year at the Wolfpack
Classic by finishing in a tie for 12th
place.
Junior Dusty Brett has been a
solid performer for the Cardinal.
Brett is looking to regain the form he
displayed in winning the first tourna
ment of the season, the Husky Clas
sic on Sept. 28-29. Brett could not
duplicate his winning ways at the
next two tournaments but still man
aged to finish in a tie for 28th and a tie
for 31st at the Windon and Wolfpack
Classics, respectively.
Sophomore Eric Dahlberg has
been a key performer for the Cardi
nal so far this season. Dahlberg has
continued to improve during the
course of the fall season and looks to
make a major contribution for Stan
ford at the Nelson and in the spring.
Dahlberg posted his best showing of
the year at the Wolfpack Classic by
finishing in a tie for 19th place.
"Eric Dahlberg has improved a
lot since last year," said Kribel. "He
worked on his game a lot over the
summer and has been a big part of
our team's success this year."
Stanford will be looking to capi
talize on its knowledge of its home
course. But Goodwin does not think
that there is a true "home-course ad
vantage."
"It's more difficult to play in a

tournament that we're hosting be
cause we're hosting,"said Goodwin.
"We're not together for an evening
in a hotel and we have to worry about
all logistics of running the tourna
ment. But, there is some serenity in
knowing what's out there."

The 18-team tournament is sched
uled to begin tomorrow at 8 a.m. and
will run until Sunday. Stanford is
paired with Duke and Northwestern
on Friday. Saturday's round will also
begin at 8 a.m. and Sunday's final
round will be a shotgun start at 8 a.m.
