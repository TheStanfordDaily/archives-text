# Closing time
## Field hockey hosts UC-Davis 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
After having been named the
Northern Pacific Athletic Confer
ence league champions, most teams
would rest their top players, ease
their practices, sit back and enjoy
the ride.
The women's field hockey team,
however, has different plans.
Stanford (10-5, 5-0 NorPac)
clinched the title of league champi
ons nearly three weeks ago alter
beating Pacific, 4-1, and emerging
from NorPac play with an unblem
ished record.
Now with two regular-season
games left, the Cardinal is deter
mined to accomplish the goals the
team set at the start of the season.
Fifteen games later. Stanford finds
itself within reach of doing just that,
but can't iest just yet
"We still have two goals," sopho
more goalie Meg Crowley said.
"()ne of them is to improve our
record from List year (lh-6). Our
other goal [is] to win the conference.
That means thai we need to play
strong and win oui next two games.
I think we can do both."
I he team's final home g«.me ol
the regular season, a critical step to
tackling its objectives, is against I 'C-
Davis'club squad on Saturday. In its
home-field finale. Stanford should
pose a serious threat lor Davis.
This year the Cardinal has out
shot its opponents 258-67 and gives
up an average of less than one goal
per game at home. Last weekend
against Pacific. Stanford's defense
allowed |ust two shots, both in the
second half. The Cardinal's accom
plishments are quickly helping them
become the standard by which other
NorPac squads are judged.
"I think at this point in the season
the team is well bonded." Johnson
said. "They trust each other and

they know what to expect from each
other."
Last year, Stanford played Davis
flawlessly, easily defeating the Ag
gies 6-0. Three of the five Cardinal
players that scored in that game
have returned and will face Davis
again this year. One of those players
is senior Monique Leroux, who will
try to lead her team to victory again
this weekend.
Earlier this season Davis was de
feated by recent Stanford victim Pa
cific, 1-0. at home. More recently
Davis was pounded by (California. 6-
0, but was without the help of its
starting goalie, who was absent for
the match.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Saturday: Stanford (10-5) vs IJC
Davis. 12 p.m. Varsity Hockey As
troturf Field.

(living the Cardinal home-field
advantage won't help Davis get
back on the winning track. Stanford
is currently 5-0 on its home turf and
hopes to finish its inaugural season
on the Varsity Hockey Athletic
Field undefeated.
While the game will mark an
achievement, the team will un
doubtedly be sorry to say good-bye
to the field that head coach Shervl
Johnson believes is the "best field in
the nation."
Despite the significance of the
game, apparent mismatch and confi
dence of already having 10 wins
under its belt, the Cardinal is main
taining its focus on defeating Davis.
"We want to be conference
champions so we have to finish
strong." Johnson said.
Johnson should have little to
worry about; finishing strong has not
been a problem for Stanford so far
this season. In fact, the team has yet
to lose a match after establishing a
first-half lead.
