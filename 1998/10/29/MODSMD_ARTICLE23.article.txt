# Men's lacrosse looking bright
## 
### Jonathan Stull 
After coming off of a 3-9 year,
most teams aim for respectability.
Some aim for a .500 record. A few
aim for the playoffs. The men's
club lacrosse team is aiming much
higher.
"I'm very excited," coach Pete
Bijesse said. "We could win the
league and win Nationals."
Although senior co-captain
Brian Puskas was not yet ready to
put the national championship in
Stanford's sights, he said he is sim
ilarly optimistic.
"I think [the national tourna
ment | is a definite possibility, but
we are realistically looking toward
finishing in the top two of the
league," he said.
This talk of possible glory is
tempered by two realities:
•The Cardinal has yet to play a
game this season.
•The history of Stanford men's
lacrosse is. as Bijesse described it,
"abysmal."
According to senior co-captain
Benton Williams, this Saturday's
tournament at Chico State will be
the team's first true opportunity to
find out whether or not it can over
come its past.
"It should be a confirmation
that we are a lot better than we
were last year," he said.
The regular club lacrosse sea
son begins in February, making
this tournament basically a presea
son event with little effect on the
season's final results.
"It doesn't really count. I don't
really care. We're shooting for
April, we're shooting for the play
offs." Bijesse said.
Most of the teams in the tourna
ment arc similarly insignificant,
according to senior co-captain
Brian Auld.

Although the lineup is not yet
finalized, Chico State, Sacramento
State and Santa Clara are expected
to compete.
Chico State and Sacramento
State are in the lower division of
the West Coast Lacrosse League,
while Stanford competes with
Santa Clara in the upper division.
However, Santa Clara is not ex
pected to pose a problem for the
Cardinal.
"We definitely expect to win
this tournament," Auld said.
Williams said he expects similar
results.
"Coach says you always get in
vited back to this tournament until
you kill everyone there," he said.
"So, our goal this year is to not get
invited back next vear."

MEN'S LACROSSE
■ Saturday: Tournament at Chico
State, all day.

Part of the team's optimism
stems from a strong influx of talent
that should vastly improve the de
fense.
According to Puskas, the defen
sive captain, and Bijesse, freshmen
Webb Long, Nick Webb and twins
Paul and Tim Sargen and sopho
more Stan Shu, who did not play
last year, should help the defense
by bringing in new talent.
"We have some real good fresh
men." Puskas said. "But, they're a
little skinny.
"1 think that over time they'll
learn the definition of the word
"tuff." Not 'tough,' but 'tuff.' "
Bijesse said the Sargens, among
others, will have a definite impact
this season.
"They are really quick and have
great skills. Thev have a lot of tal
ent," he said.
Even with the brand new addi
tions to the squad, there is no guar
antee that the team will measure
up to its potential, according to Bi
jesse.
"We're very young. Every
thing's new. We don't know who
has heart, who plays smart, who
has a shot under pressure. It's all
new," he said.
While some may view having a
young, inexperienced team as a
problem instead of as an advan
tage, it is also the main reason Bi
jesse and others are so optimistic.
Coming off of a 3-9 season, "all
new" is "all good."
In the past, "there was a core of
guys who were really committed,
but the talent level hasn't been
there," Bijesse said. "But now.
we're pretty good. And, we're just

going to get better. That's the ter
rifying part."
With the promise of a good
team this season, Bijesse said he
sees the possibility of more fans
coming out to attend the team's
games.
"I think we're going to be fun to
watch. 1 couldn't have said that the
past few years but I think it'll be
fun this year. Good lacrosse is fun
to watch and we should be good,"
he said.
Good or bad, another 3-9
record or one more national cham
pionship to add to Stanford's col
lection, the season could go either
way. This weekend should be the
first indication of how it will shape
up.
Potential is only potential until
it is applied.
"The potential here is huge,"
Puskas said. "But, we don't know
about the intangibles yet. We've
only been practicing. We've got to
get out and play some games."
