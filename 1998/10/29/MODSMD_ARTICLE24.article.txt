### Beth Robinowitz 
The School of Medicine's new fac
ulty compensation plan unifies the
basic salary structure for all Medical
School faculty, including basic sci
ence faculty, those in the Medical
Center line and those in the Universi
ty tenure line.
Controversy hung over the two
year development of the plan, due to
the plan's possible imposition on aca
demic freedom and on the amount of
administrative control it may create.
Based on faculty feedback at de
partmental meetings, the plan was re
vised last March. The plan, which will
be phased in over a two-year period,
was approved by all department
chairs last June at the Executive Ses
sion. Faculty paychecks will be affect
ed starting in the fiscal year 2(HX).
One of the new plan's main fea
tures is the implementation of a sys
tem which annually reviews faculty
member performance according to
criteria set by each department, with
in established guidelines. The evalua
tions will measure the contributions
of each faculty member in the areas
of teaching, research, patient care
and administration or service to the
institution.
The new evaluation system's ef
fect on academic freedom remains an
issue.
"A long-standing tradition of
Stanford and of academic freedom is
that the faculty is self-governing, and
this system goes outside that system,"
Pediatrics Prof. Raymond Hint/said.
Hint/ said he fears that having a
basis of pay connected with perfor
mance may negatively affect faculty
members' behavior. "I see the neces
sity of the plan, I just wish their was
more faculty participation in it,"he
added.
At the first medical faculty senate
of the year, held Oct. 14, Medical
School Dean Eugene Bauer ex
plained the driving force behind the
new plan, presented an overview of
the plan and answered questions.
"Despite our health as a school,"

Bauer said, "we continue to face... a
clinical marketplace that is indiffer
ent to academic medical centers, to
say the least."
The plan's necessity derives from
many sources, including the need to
adapt to reduced federal reimburse
ment, increasing financial pressures
of managed care, tightening research
money and other market forces. In
addition, school officials felt the need
to reduce the pay distinctions be
tween Medical Center line and
tenure line faculty.
"There are IKS regulations that
govern not-for-profit institutions that
demand that we provide certain
mechanisms for dealing with com
pensation." Bauer said. "And that, in
turn, forces us to develop a certain
kind of rigor in our compensation
plans within the school that perhaps
is greater than what we've had be
fore."
Stanford's Medical Sch(X)l is not
alone, according to information from
surveys conducted by the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges.
The surveys indicate that throughout
the United States, academic medical
centers are altering their processes of
evaluation and compensation.
Schools are increasingly relating their
pay levels to productivity.
IJnder the new plan, three compo
nents — a fixed base, a variable com
ponent and a bonus — determine the
compensation of faculty in clinical
departments. The base is set at
$66,(MX) for an assistant professor,
$X4,(XX) for an associate professor
and $1 K).(KK) for a full professor.
Clinical faculty members whose
base salaries are higher than the
plan's will have their base frozen at
the current level.
The new plan will determine the
base salary of any clinical faculty
hired or offered positions after Sept.
1, 1998. A clinical faculty member's
specialty and his own contribution to
the department will decide the vari
able component. There are five pay
ranges, based on market data to re
flect competitive salary opportuni

ties, which encompass both base and
variable salary.
An individual's base will only
change if he or she moves up in rank.
Based on individual performance
and the department's financial re
sources, the combined base and vari
able portion may increase or de
crease by as much as 10 percent each
year.
Unlike the previous compensa
tion program, the revised plan in
cludes the basic science faculty, creat
ing uniformity throughout the school.
Although the salaries of basic sci
ence faculty will be set in a similar
way, the chairs of basic science de
partments voted that their depart
ments will not be eligible for bonuses.
Compensation for basic science fac
ulty will be based on only two com
ponents: a fixed base plus a variable
component.
The three ranges of the basic sci
ence structure all correspond with
faculty rank; the range for an assis
tant professor is between $66,(XX) and
$90,(XX) a year; for an associate pro
fessor, between $X4,(XX) and $ 115,(XX)
a year; and for a full professor, be
tween $1 KMXX) and $2(X),(XX).
The Compensation Board, a mix
ture of faculty and staff, will inspect
the salary structure annually, aligning
it with market pay levels. The board
will also discuss revisions to the struc
ture at least every three years and will
oversee the review process, examin
ing each department's faculty evalua
tion system.
The Compensation Board con
sists of individuals appointed by the
administration and is designed to
represent the broad range of school
interests. Concern over the increase
in administrative control, voiced by
the senate, prompted Bauer to re
spond that he is open to the idea of
changing the size of the board and
having some members elected rather
than appointed. However, he em
phasized the need for consistency in
membership to provide consistent
implementation of the plan from
year to year.
