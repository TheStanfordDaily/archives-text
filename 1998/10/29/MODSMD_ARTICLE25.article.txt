## 
### Meredith Rowe 
University President Gerhard
Casper will address students and fac
ulty in his annual State of the Univer
sity address today at 4:15 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
The President will announce a
new initiative, review the past year
and discuss faculty grievances and co
hesion, among other subjects, accord
ing to University Communications
Director Terry Shepard.
Last year, subjects of the speech
included the Stanford Band's half
time antics and the Sand Hill Road
project. In prior years, topics covered
were alumni contributions, the intro
duction of Sophomore College and
the importance of fund raising.
Casper will address faculty griev
ance procedures in his speech. In Jan
uary, during a Faculty Senate meet
ing, Provost Condoleezza Rice pro
posed that faculty grievances be put

through a speedi
er system.
"Time plays a
role in the fairness
of the grievance
process," Casper
said in January.
Before the ad
dress, a Faculty

Senate meeting will take place and
discuss the 1997-98 annual report
from the Committee on Undergradu
ate Admission and Financial Aid.
Last year, Stanford received
18,885 freshman applicants, an all
time high. Of this pool, 13 percent
were admitted. Approximately 24
percent of admitted students were
admitted through Early Decision.
The Senate will also discuss this
year's approval of the Science, Tech
nology and Society program.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies has recommended that
the STS program be approved for

one year.
Interdisciplinary programs such as
STS and Human Biology are re
viewed periodically. Without ap
proval, programs lose their degree
granting authority and effectively die.
Two years ago, the Faculty Senate
was considering dropping STS' status
as a degree-granting program, flow
ever, at the time, STS majors orga
nized a campaign in support of the
program and succeeded in rescuing
the program with the help of a peti
tion sporting 2,3(K) signatures.
The STS program recently named
two new chairs. History Prof. Paula
Findlen and Industrial Engineering
Prof. Robert McGinn.
At the State of the University ad
dress, Frances Conley, last year's
Senate chair, will present last year's
senate report.
The address will be held as part of
an Faculty Senate meeting, but all of
the Stanford community is invited to

attend, including faculty and stu
dents.
Ilie address will provide a chance
for Casper to show his willingness to
be open with students, senior Kavitha
Krishnan said.
"I think this is a really positive
thing," she said. "It's good in that
those who might not even be that in
touch with the University will be able
to hear the address and learn what is
going on at Stanford."
Those planning to go to the ad
dress say they look forward to the
event as one that will further their
knowledge of what is currently im
portant at Stanford.
"I'm definitely going to attend
President Casper's State of the Uni
versity address," freshman Alec De
twilersaid.
"I feel it's important for us, as stu
dents, to be constantly aware of and
updated on the issues that affect this
university," he added.
