Fadiman stressed that cultural
competence improves patient out
comes in a speech to a beeper
laden audience of medical students
and medical center employees at
the Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital yesterday.
Fadiman said her own experi
ence when she studied a Laotian
refugee epileptic child in Merced,
Calif, for her book, "The Spirit
Catches You and You Fall Down,"
taught her "that not only is bio
medicine a culture, it is really a for
eign culture."
According to Fadiman, biomed
icine has its own set of taboos, tra
ditions, hierarchies and language

that are at least as intricate as Laos'
Hmong culture.
The Hmongs, refugees from
Laos, were considered "noncom
pliant" by physicians and were frus
trating doctors with their taboos
against surgery and spinal taps and
their refusal to take certain pills be
cause the colors were seen as un
lucky.
The parents of the child Fadi
man studied believed that a malev
olent spirit was attacking their
daughter. The title of her book is
the English translation of the
Hmong phrase for epilepsy.
Fadiman only intended to write
a short magazine piece on the situ
ation, but her interest resulted in
eight years of research. Her book
won the National Book Critics Cir
cle Award.

Because the parents did not un
derstand the complex medical in
structions, the doctors accused
them of child abuse in an attempt to
save the child's life. Child Protec
tive Services placed the girl in a fos
ter home, where the physicians
could be sure she was receiving
proper care.
In this case, Fadiman said the
doctors' idealism caused them to
"apply the golden rule literally."
They treated the child as they
would treat their own â€” even
though the parents couldn't read
the directions on the medicine, the
child didn't like the pills and the
family didn't understand the side
effects.
If there is a "one size fits all" so
lution to cultural challenges, Fadi
man suggested that it is to "see the

illness from the patient's point of
view."
Fadiman's experience also
taught her the value of good inter
preters. She attributing her good
relationship with the Hmong fami
ly to her interpreter, a "cultural
broker," and emphasized how
much she gained by speaking with
the interpreter after the patient
left.
She also encouraged learning
about the patient's culture, ac
knowledging the humanity of the
patient and asking what the patient
thought might be the cause of the
illness.
However, she said that she un
derstood that "if one felt fully for
every patient encountered, one
would spent the entire day in tears
and retire after a month."

Fadiman added that her ideas
were not necessarily new. "Some
times things that are obvious need
to be expressed because, particu
larly in medicine, respect goes to
things that are difficult, not things
that are easy," she said.
She also advocated practicing
joint treatment of both traditional
medicine and Western medicine.
"I don't think you need to be
lieve that a Hmong shaman ... re
ally cures illness," she said, point
ing out that building an atmosphere
of trust and collaboration between
the doctor and parent mattered
more.
Pointing out how tightly knit
many Hmong clans are, she urged
the audience to remember that a
doctor is not treating just one pa
tient, he is treating the community.
