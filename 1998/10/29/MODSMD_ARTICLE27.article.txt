# Bertolucci unplugged
## Filmmaker speaks to Stanford-in-Florence students 
### Marisa Maclennan 
FLORENCE, Italy — "When I
make a film, it always feels like the
first time, hut worse." This was one
of the many insights Italian film
maker Bernardo Bertolucci shared
with a group of students at the
Stanford in Florence Program on
Oct. 24.
Bertolucci, a personal friend of
Stanford in Florence Director
Linda Campani, and the subject of
her new book, "L'Anticon
formista," came to speak with the
program's film students.
Film lovers, communication ma
jors and personal fans packed into
a small classroom and those who
couldn't get in stood outside the
door in hopes of hearing Bertoluc
ci speak. His visit was an intimate
and rare chance to hear what he
had to say about his films when the
recorders were off.
Bertolucci, dressed casually in a
blazer and sneakers, sat between
Campani and Franco La Polla, a
professor from the University of
Bologna. He listened quietly while
being introduced, but joked with
the students during his talk and
mixed English and Italian when un
sure of his metaphors or expres
sions.
The son of a poet, Bertolucci
began his creative pursuits in poet
ry. When he realized he couldn't
beat his father in creative writing,
he channeled his interests toward
lit in.
Bertolucci grew up in the Italian
countryside. Going to the cinema
was a literal escape to the big city of
Parma, as well as an escape to the
world of the images of westerns
and war movies. His interest in
pursuing a career in filmmaking
began when he saw Federico Felli

ni's movie "La Dolce Vita." He
was intrigued by the use of multiple
languages and the voice of Fellini's
directions in the background.
At 16, he had made his first
short home movie, "La Teleferi
ca," using a friend's camera. At 19,
he had the opportunity to work
with the then-unknown director
Pier Paolo Pasolini. His family,
which had relocated to Rome, lived
in Pasonlini's apartment building,
and it was through this chance
meeting that Bertolucci met his
mentor.
He found himself assisting the
director on "Aecattone," Pasolini's
first film. A year later in 1962, he
made his first film, "The Grim
Reaper" ("La Commare Secca").
He felt he was able to assist and
witness the invention of cinema by
working with Pasolini, who became
a longtime friend.
36 years and 19 films later,
Bertolucci has found himsell where
he loves to be — seeing the fruits of
his labor in a new film. Bertolucci
said that the challenge is to rein
vent, or rediscover cinema each
time he makes a film. His newest
film, "Besieged," was shown re
cently at the Toronto Film Festival,
and will come out in Italy next Jan
uary.
He strongly believes in learning
about film through the creative
process itself. A self-professed
"cinephile," Bertolucci stressed
this love of all types of film as fur
thering his career.
"If you want to learn film, don't
go to film school, go to films," he
said
Among the many personal
anecdotes and stories Bertolucci
shared with the students was his re
count of the making of "Last Tango
in Paris" (1972). Originally, the

movie was to be filmed in Milan
and Bertolucci planned to call it
"One Day and One Night and One
Day and One Night."
But Bertolucci liked the sound
of "Last Tango" better and thought
that the words "in Paris" would
complete the title.
"You couldn't call it 'Last
Tango in Milan,' " Bertolucci said.
The crew working on the movie
moved filming to Paris accordingly.
Bertolucci then began searching
for actors. Several turned down the
offer to work on the film because
they thought that it was borderline
pornographic. It was Marlon Bran
do, who has since become a good
friend of the director, who eventu
ally accepted the offer and made
the film.
After "Last Tango," Bertolucci
recognized his success, and his ca
pability to do bigger productions.
He began making the epic "1900,"
starring Robert DeNiro and Ger
ard Depardieu, which was made in
the spirit of "Gone With the
Wind."
Released in 1976 and rarely
seen by viewers in the United
States, " 19(H)" gained international
acclaim.
In 1986, he made the first of his
"eastern trilogy," "The Last Em
peror" which earned nine Acade
my Awards, including Best Picture
and Best Director. The movie was
followed by "The Sheltering Sky"
(1990), and "Little Buddha"
(1993).
Bertolucci was critical of the
younger generations lack of film or
cinema "memory." He also criti
cized the big-budget productions
made in Hollywood today.
"There's nothing special besides
the special effects, and they aren't
even special," he said.
