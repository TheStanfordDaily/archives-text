## Gene study finds higher mobility for women

"Sisterhood is stronger than
brotherhood," said Stanford scientist
Eric Minch.
According to a recently-released
scientific study, women have traveled
eight times more than men over the
course of human history.
Marx Seielstad of Harvard Uni
versity, Minch and Genetics Prof.
Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford have
been working on this project for the
past two years. They have recently
published their findings in "Nature
Genetics."
"This study proves that there are
more similarities between distant
populations of women, and they are
genetically closer than men are,"
Minch said. This new genre of sci
ence, molecular archeology, helps
scientists understand more about
human roots by examining present

day genes.
The group tested genetic samples
from around the world. They focused
on Y-chromosomes, passed on only
by fathers, and mitochondrial DNA,
or mtDNA, passed on only by moth
ers. The variations in the Y-chromo
somes tended to be more localized
and the variations in mtDNA were
more diverse, signaling that men did
not migrate as much as women.
This study is "counter-intuitive,"
according to Minch. One would think
that men would be the travelers since
they are traditionally associated with
hunting, warfare and trade, whereas
women are associated with gather
ing. But men have undertaken treks
only in recent history, whereas
women haven been moving across
continents from the beginning of
human civilization.
The similarities between distant
populations of women may be caused

by trans-generational movemenljae
cording to the researchers.
"This movement — the distSjSfc
traveled between one's place of birth
and the place where one bearsyhil
dren — can be explained by paffilo
cality," Minch said.
Patrilocality, in which men inherit
the family land, is prevalent in 70 per
cent of the world's population and
has been in practice for the last 10,00(3
years. This social structure fofces
women to relocate to the homes of
their husbands. , r
Another possible explanation is
women's ability to partake in "inter
class mobility." Society frowns;kss
upon women who move up to hisfc[pr
social castes through marriage: ac
cording to Minch.
The team's study refutes tradi
tional archeology because it proves
that women, more than men, led tp
the diversification of the gene pool."
