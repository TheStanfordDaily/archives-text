### Hasan McGee 
On Jan. 6. Hua Di, a Chinese mis
sile expert and senior research associ
ate at the Center for International
Security and Cooperation at Stan
ford. was arrested in Beijing for al
legedly revealing state secrets.
Information on the arrest was not
made public until this week.
A permanent resident of the Unit
ed States, I lua went to Beijing 10 at

tend memorial services for his moth
er. father, and brother-in-law, all of
whom died during Hua's nine-year
stay in the United States.
Hua had been at Stanford work
ing with the center since IWJ. The
center is a consortium of scholars and
former policy makers from the Unit
ed States and many foreign countries
who conduct unclassified research on
current global security problems.
Emeritus Prof. John Lewis of the

Institute for International Studies
said in a statement that Hua "went to
China with full assurances from the
Ministry of State Security that he
would be OK. He was well aware of
the possibility of charges being lev
eled against him while he was in the
United States, so he went to Hong
Kong in September last year and was
given a thorough clearance by the
Ministry of State Security."
Hua has authored several articles
on Chinese security policy regarding
such topics as China's ballistic missile
program. He also worked with
Lewis, head of the center's Project on
Peace and Cooperation in the Asian-
Pacific Region, on a history of
China's missile program, which was
published in 1992.
Many of Hua's colleagues have
written the Chinese government re
questing his immediate release and
arguing Hua's innocence.
According to a statement released
by Provost Condoleezza Rice, "Pro
fessor Lewis has provided evidence
of the fact that the source materials
for publications written by him and
Mr. Hua all either were provided by
approved Chinese authorities or al
ready were available through the
Stanford University library."
Scott Sagan, the co-director of the

center, expressed his view that Hua's
research has. in fact, increased in
ternational security and cooperation.
"In my personal judgment, he has
helped through his writings explain
the evolution of Chinese security pol
icy," Sagan said. "I believe that en
hanced understanding has done
nothing but help Chinese national se
curity."
Hua, 63 years old and suffering
from cancer, returned to the United
States for treatment before attending
the memorial service in Beijing.
Lewis said that Hua was "one of
three people authorized at the high
est levels in China to give me materi
al on the history of the strategic
weapons program." He said that Chi
nese military officials were "very
complimentary [of the report] and
saw it as helping China's position to
be understood in the West."
Hua has not seen a doctor or his
family since his arrest, Lewis said, but
has recently been assigned a lawyer.
Lewis has produced a number of doc
uments to help Hua's legal defense.
