# Opera Review
## Love and death in Cornwall A 						review of 'Tristan und Isolde' 
### 
Rarely have such strong words been used in
reviewing a San Francisco Opera production
as those in the San Francisco Chronicle
recently— "a train wreck... an occasion for gloom
and despair" — clearly, the reviewer had an axe to
grind. However, my point here is not to draw swords
with someone whose only line of attack seemed to be
to dive head first into Roget's Thesaurus, but to shed
a little less hostile light on the Wagnerian addition to
the 1998 / 99 season at the War Memorial Opera
house — that is, "Tristan und Isolde."
"Tristan" is always a popular addition to a pro
gram for several reasons. For the Wagner aficiona
dos, it offers some of his most stirring music and
rich orchestration, and culminates in the magnifi
cent "Liebestod" of the heroine, Isolde. For the reti
cent Wagner-follower, contemplating his or her first
or second attempt at wrestling with this most idio
syncratic of 19th-century German composers,
"Tristan" is not laden with nationalist (later read as
proto-Nazi) sentiment.

In fact, set in ninth-century Cornwall, and featuring a
clash between the Irish and other Celts, "Tristan" has a
distinctly non-Teutonic flavor. For the novice, of course,
"Tristan" is only one of the most famous love stories of all
time — rivaling "Romeo and Juliet," though much
older — which assists flagging concentration. A word of
caution, however. Wagner operas are never short.
Unlike Wagner's "Ring Cycle," a lot of the action in
"Tristan" has already happened before the opera begins,
and the audience members have to have their wits about
them. A Cornish knight, Tristan (Wolfgang Schmidt),
sails from Ireland after slaying the Irish King Morold, and
brings with him Isolde (Elizabeth Connell) as the new
wife for his king (Victor von Harlem). On board, Isolde

tries to convince her maid, BrangSne (Violetta Urmana,)
to help her commit suicide. Unbeknownst to Isolde, her
maid prepares a love potion instead.
When Tristan and Isolde drink what they both believe
to be poison, they fall instantaneously and rapturously in
love. The two secretly, but not secretly enough, continue
their love affair in Cornwall. The maid tries to warn
Tristan that he is about to be betrayed by his friend Melot
(John Robert Autry), but singing the famous "love duet,"
the lovers ignore her protests. Kurwenal (Tom Fox)
arrives too late to keep their secret hidden from the king.
After a brief scuffle with Melot, during which Tristan
throws himself upon Melot's lance, Tristan lays dying.
Later, in Brittany, Tristan hopes desperately for Isolde's
arrival. After some tense moments and false alarms, she
arrives, but too late to save him. The King, now aware of

the love potion, arrives shortly after, and to his horror
realizes he has lost his finest servant. Isolde laments,
and her final song is one of transfiguration, in which
the two lovers are united at last in death.
With a brilliant orchestra and accomplished mae
stro at the helm, no "Tristan" can sink. Under the
baton of Donald Runnicles, Michael Hampe's produc
tion is cogent and compelling. However, there are still
blips of imperfection — some of the staging by
Mauro Pagano is downright foolish. One should think
that long gone are the days when artists are forced to
huddle on carpet-covered stairs, and the audience is
compelled to imagine a forest floor. Hampe could also
have ironed out some of the clumsiness between
Schmidt and Connell in the same scene (whose differ
ent heights posed more than a few problems when
kissing on the steps), and earlier too, as swords were
unsheathed. Thomas Munn's lighting is never a disap
pointment, but in the first scene, when it is combined

with a oddly-clad chorus in raincoats and galoshes, one
could be forgiven for expecting a moment of singing sea
farers from "Peter Grimes."
But there is no overwhelming reason to miss this per
formance and every reason for me to recommend it.
Elizabeth Connell, stepping late into the role of Isolde,
was a powerful presence. Though Wolfgang Schmidt
sounded a little distant in the first act, by the second and
certainly the third he was in almost true form. Violetta
Urmana's U.S. debut was stunning. And Victor von
Harlem successfully stole the final scene of Act Two.
"Tristan und Isolde" is playing in repertory until Nov. 6.
