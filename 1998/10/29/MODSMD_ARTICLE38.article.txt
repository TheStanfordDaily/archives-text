# Interview
## Space Ghost! A
						superhero opens up 
### Stan Karas Editorial Staff 
After conquering the evil villains of outer space
on his Hanna-Barbera show on CBS in the
'60s, Space Ghost had a lot of spare time on
his hands. Luckily for us, he tuned into TV transmis
sions from Earth and decided that he wanted a talk
show. He pitched the Cartoon Network with his idea
of hosting his own talk show from outer space, and
they bought it.
Now, not only has Space Ghost been on the air for
over five seasons, he has also released two CDs on
Rhino Records. The latest, a follow-up to the successful
"Musical Bar-B-Que," is "Space Ghost's Surf & Turf."
Recently, Intermission had a chance to interview this
noted cult figure, whose talk show has entranced many
a Stanford student.
Intermission; Hello, Space Ghost!
Space Ghost: Hello young Americans!
h The question on everyone's mind is why Moltar is
not on this CD.
SG: That's a good question.Well, he had eaten some
Thai food that day before recording, and let's just say,
that Multar was "indisposed." Oh boy, Space Ghost
opens with a bathroom joke.
I; Your new album shows some parallels with the
work of such bands as Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin.
SG: Yes, well, we are all about values. We love the
rock 'n' roll. And as long as it's in the public domain
we'll cook up the peppiest sounds we can muster.
I: Are there any plans for a galactic tour behind this
record 112
SG: It will be called the Bald Guy In a Hotsuit Lip
Synch Tour. And, yes, there will be merchandise. We
have them marketing geniuses working on this right
now. Watch for the Space Ghost turkey baster.
I; Do you feel a lack of imagination in other singers
and musicians out there?
SG: Yes, totally. They are all hacks, especially when
they are selling double platinum while I am struggling
to get to that gold foil they use to wrap candy in. But, I
admire these people. I admire anyone who can sell a
record.
I; My girlfriend wants a Spank Ray. How would one
go about getting onet
SG: She wants a Spank Ray, does she? In this case,
the first thing you have to ask her is if she was a bad girl.
And then you'll probably have to give it to her the old
fashioned way, if you catch my drift. (By the way, this is
the side of Space Ghost that the censors usually get to
first!)
1: What happened to Jace and Jan (characters on
the Cartoon Channel show]?
SG: As we say in entertainment business, they got

the home version of the game. It's just kind of like when
you come back from vacation and you have some "extra
baggage." Basically, we just didn't really need them
around.
I; How does it feel to outlast the critics' expecta
tions?
SG: Well, its been five and a half seasons. It's just
amazing. Eventually thanks to fine Americans such as
yourselves, we built up a little grass roots following and
built our little empire. Kids like you will make Space
Ghost old, fat and successful someday.
I: How often do you change your tights, Space
Ghost?
SG: You must change them every day. You wash
them with Lemon Fresh Tide. Although actually, the
one responsible for Space Ghost's laundry is Zorak. He
is what we call my laundry mistress. He takes care of the
matters of the laundry: "Here, this is soiled â€” take care
of that."
I: Do you think Zorak will ever enter therapy to
work out all those deep-seated problems of his?
SG: Maybe. But Zorak is bipolar, you know. He's
been both to the North and the South Pole.
I: Who is your target audience? What is your goal?
SG: Anybody with money and world domination.
Our mission is to entertain the youngsters of the world.
We just love entertaining the kids.
I: Do you have a girlfriend? Are you eligible?

SG: Space Ghost is what you call on your planet a
sweet available beast.
I: Do you know any other famous ghosts Uke
Casper, Beetle juice, Patrick Swayze, for example?
SG: Well, of course. We all go to conventions and
everything.
I: So you are not a superhero, but a ghost?
SG: I am a real ghost. Just a little dead boy who grew
up to be a big dead boy with big firm squeezable mus
cles. A boy who can open a can using just his hiney
muscles.
I: You've done music and TV; are you planning to
expand into other media?
SG: I want to break into face-painting.
I: Are there any guests that you would really like to
have?
SG: Oh boy, I would love to have David Letterman
on the show. Wouldn't that be fun?
I: How is your relationship with your mother?
SG: Oh, it is very nice, very pleasant indeed. We get
along just fine. 1 communicate with her through the
dinnerware. She'll pick up a fork and I go "Hey Mom!"
Scares the bejesus out of her when she eats salad.
I: Finally, what are you going to be doing fin-
Halloween?
SG: I'll be handing out chickpeas as usual. There is
nothing kids like more than getting a big glob of chick
peas for Halloween.
