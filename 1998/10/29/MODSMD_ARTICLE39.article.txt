# Still Boogie Chillen
## Intermission interviews John Lee Hooker 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
There are relatively few remaining original blues
giants. 8.8. King is still touring, but his live show
has been watered down with a little too much of
his "when-a-man-loves-a-woman" shtick. Billy Boy
Arnold was never really the blues great his publicist
would have you believe, and Junior Wells' death this past
January thinned the population that much more.
John Lee Hooker remains.
With over 75 albums, live releases and reissues, his
body of work is immense. He's played with everyone,
from Carlos Santana to Canned Heat, from Sonny Boy
Williamson to Van Morrison. Hooker even joined Eric
Clapton and the Rolling Stones on stage for a rendition of
his "Boogie Chillen" on the last stop of the Stones' Steel
Wheels tour in Atlantic City in 1989.
In the spirit of such collaboration, last week he
released a 50th anniversary CD entitled "The Best of
Friends." The new release features the best of Hooker's
collaborations over the past decade from CDs such as
199 l's "Mr. Lucky" and 1995's "Chill Out" in addition to
three new duets and a solo version of "Tupelo." Artists
included on the disc include Clapton, Ry Cooder, Bonnie
Raitt, Santana, Robert Cray, and Van Morrison; not
exactly your typical four-guys-named-Mo backup band.
It doesn't matter. Even with the mini-galaxy of stars sur
rounding him, even when his backup band has more
household names in it than the song they're playing has
chords, Hooker steals the show.
At the age when most of his contemporaries are retired
or long gone, Hooker continues to crank out award-win
ning albums. Include "Best of Friends" and you've got six
albums in the last decade — how many other 81-year
olds can lay claim to that? The side men have changed,
but at the heart of it all are still Hooker's eerie delta blues
licks and raspy, gut-wrenching vocals.
Master of the endless one-chord boogie, Hooker tells a
story of pain and loss and redemption with every mut
tered phrase, every stinging double stop, every hoot and
howl. And he is no Bob Dylan — through all the bour
bons, scotches and beers, his voice hasn't lost a shred of
the virtuosity it displayed on his first hit, "Boogie
Chillen." His easy-rolling, hypnotic boogie shuffles, vio
lently punctuated by the occasional dissonant lead fill,
have been imitated but never quite duplicated by blues
guitarists like George Thorogood and Stevie Ray
Vaughan. He is of the last surviving blues greats. He is a
legend in his own time. He is, as he told Intermission, the
Boogie Man.
Intermission: You've influenced a lot of bluesmen
across the years. Who was your greatest influence as a
developing musician?
John Lee Hooker: Oh boy, you mean in the past. It
was my stepfather. He started and now today it's the only
influence I got. The only influence on me now is people
in the blues, and young people. A whole lot of things had
a great influence on me — blues and a great talent of
people. It's just a thing that's from God, a great influence,
it's just a lot of things.
I: What do you consider your greatest musical accom
plishment?
JLH: I would say, making the people happy. It has a
great influence on me. It's gotta be in you, in your heart
and soul.
I: What do you listen to in your spare timet
JLH: The blues and the boogie. That's the blues. It's all

music, now, don't get me wrong, but my great influence
is the blues, people like Albert King, Freddie King, Muddy
Waters. The blues is what I listen to. I like soulful jazz, you
know, that funky jazz, but the blues is the thing 1 really
listen to, I mean, really, really listen to.
I: Who is the greatest harmonica player you have
ever played with 112
JLH: Little Walter. He was the greatest. He brought
harmonica back when it was almost gone. He brought it
back to the top, to that modern sound. Anybody who
pick up a harmonica sounds like Little Walter.
I: What do you see as the harmonica's role in bluesf
JLH: Oh, I love harmonica players. It's one of the
greatest sounds, the blues harmonica. The harmonica is
by-and-by with the guitar with the blues. Harmonica is a
great, great instrument. Little Walter's blues harmonica,

there's no kind of jazz or rock harmonica that sounds like
a funky blues harmonica. It's the greatest thing — like the
guitar.
I: You were in the original Blues Brothers movie. A
lot of blues fans have claimed that the Blues Brothers
have done more to hurt the blues than to help it How do
you feel about thatf
JLH: I don't think so. "The Blues Brothers" was a great
movie, it was a great great movie. The new one — I don't
know. I haven't even seen it.
I: What relationship did you have with Big Walter
Hortonf
JLH: I knew him so well. So good. That man was a big
favorite of mine next to Little Walter. Even told me him
self out of his mouth, he said Little Walter was a big
favorite of his. And he said Walter was a great favorite of
his — I'll never forget that.

I: Can you talk about your collaborations with
Canned Heat in the late '60s?
JLH: It was a great rock group —we did some great
music. They did the boogie. I enjoyed working with them
so much. Most of them went on or passed on, like the
great Alan Wilson, but they were great and they are still
going.
I: Could you tell us about your memories of Alan
"Blind Owl" Wilson?
JLH: Oh, boy, I loved him, to me he was the greatest.
He could play harmonica, guitar, and piano. On that
record he played, when we were on the boogie, I think
piano, the track I'm thinking of right now, "On Campus."
He was a great harmonica player.
I: Did you ever meet or play with Jimi Hendrix?
JLH: I didn't never know him.
I: What was it like joining Eric Clapton and the
Rolling Stones onstage at the end of the Stones' Steel
Wheels tour?
JLH: That was a great, great feeling for me and for
them too. It was a great feeling for them and a great feel
ing for me. All of us enjoyed each other so much. The
crowd loved the blues all the weeks and months and go by
and they talk about Eric, and the Stones, when was that,
New Years? Where was that?
I: Atlantic City.
JLH: Yeah, we talk about it all the time.
I: Could you talk about your relationship with Keith
Richardst I know he played on a track off your "Mr.
Lucky" album a few years back.
JLH: We very close, every time he arrive he come to
see me or call me. Me and Keith are very close. Never did
thought we would be but we are. He call me, wonder how
I'm doing. Just talk, you know.
I: In the '60s, the blues greats were sort of rediscov
ered by white audiences while the popularity of the
blues waned in the black community. Could you com
ment on the changed identity of blues fanst
JLH: Well, the white community's been more greater
than the black community, to be honest with you. I want
ed to bring more black into it with the white, deep into
the white, but the white were so deep into it And they
young blacks is into rap, you know, disco, and stuff like
that, more than they was into the blues. But they was so
deep into the blues, the whites was. Wherever I played,
that's all I see, is white audiences. And that's the way it is.
I: What's your impression of rap music?
JLH: My impression is, it's not the blues. I don't go out
for rap, I got nothing against it but it ain't my style. 1
wouldn't want to play it, to me, it's just — its got no feel
ing for me. I can't feel it at all. But 1 don't put it down, but
I don't pick it up. I just don't feel it
I: What is your advice to young blues men?
JLH: My advice to them is to hang in there, not every
one gonna be 'round forever. One of the big things is to
have all the music, to have all the soul. Of all music, it's
the number one of all music, it's just a great feeling. It's a
great story. It's to stay with the blues, to hang with it,
cause it's the greatest Greatest feeling.
I: How do you see the blues as it relates to the current
music scene?
JLH: I mean, it ain't goin' never die, if that's what

you're sayin'. It's high, as high as it goes, it's goin', it ain't
never goin' down, it's gonna forever be here it's obviously
the blues. It'll never, never, never die, it'll be here. Like me.
When I'm gone — I'm the blues. I will never die, because
of the blues. The body will die, but the blues will never
die. They're the blues, they're here to stay, forever.
J: Could you talk about your relationship with two
prominent musicians that have joined you in the past on
your albums, Charlie Musselwhite and Carlos Santanaf
JLH: And Van Morrison. Carlos is one of the greatest
guys ever picked up a guitar. Carlos Santana, he's right in
with what I'm doin' It ain't the blues, but it's strong. It's
not the blues, but we get together. I love him, and he loves

Charlie Musselwhite, he one of the deepest, deep deep
fellas I'm talking about. He is the blues fella, well he did
play the blues, he can play the blues great, that's how deep
he is. He's a deep friend of mine. We're very close. Van
Morrison, which you forgot about him but I'm gonna tell
you about him. He is so great. He is so good. He sings as
good the blues, he plays the blues guitar, he sings the
blues — it's all around, he as good John Lee Hooker ever
been. He comes over to my house, have dinner — they're
just great people. I can't say enough about them. 'Cuz
they following the roots of the blues.
I: You've been all around the world from Clarksdale,
Miss. You're one of the most popular blues singers alive,
and you've won four Grammy awards. What do you have
to say about the length of your career and all the success
you've enjoyed?
JLH: I was really surprised I had great success. 1 never
thought I would be this big, this high, that I would be
known as a blues man. I never thought 1 would be the
number one blues singer in the world. I never thought
that's my style.
I can't say nothing about myself. Whatever I said it's
true, I'm not bragging on myself, I'm not patting myself
on the back. But that's just the way we are, that's the way
I go on the road with the name John Lee Hooker —
which is me.
1 never thought I'd get that high. But I'm proud of it. I
love small clubs, playing in small clubs. Better than a big,
big concert. Good money, don't get me wrong, but in a
small club people are right there. They can see me, they
close to me, they can touch me. I like that, because I don't
need the money 'cuz I got the money. It's me, and it's
them, and my blues, in small clubs they around me. Two
hundred, three hundred people, that small. They can
reach out, touch me, hear the blues.
Big, big concert, two thousand, three thousand people,
that's OK, but you don't get to play them like you would
a small club. Though the money's there, you can make the
big money, but that don't move me, that just don't move
me. What moves me is the people in the world that love
the blues. People who are down to earth. Small people,
poor people, people I can shake their hand, have a drink
with them when I do drink, I don't drink that much, not
any more. Whatever, whatever they want. That's all I got
to say.
I: Do you have anything else you'd like to say to blues
fans across the world?
JLH: Yes I would. Keep going, hanging, hang in there,
with the blues, keep working with the blues. And I'm
gonna keep on bringing you the blues as long as I can. I
know you love it, because if they didn't, I wouldn't be
where I'm at now standing, so I'm going to keep on try
ing, trying to get 'em to you. Just hang on out there, with

John Lee coming to you with the Blues. I am the Boogie
Man. I am the blues man. I love you.
John Lee Hooker will be performing at the Dinkelspiel
auditorium on Oct. 30 at 8:00 p.m.
