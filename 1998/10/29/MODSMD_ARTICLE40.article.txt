## For cryin' 'Out Loud' Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah are 'Living' 
### 
CC -y iving Out Loud," a kind of romantic comedy
starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and
Jl J Queen Latifah, is sometimes charming,
sometimes amusing, sometimes even touching, but ulti
mately fails to satisfy. The film follows Judith Nelson's
(Hunter) emotional re-awakening after her 16-year mar
riage to a wealthy, unfaithful doctor falls apart.
Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese, the
screenwriter for"The Bridges of Madison County" and
"The Fisher King," "Living Out Loud" suffers from an
overdose of generic maturity. Light jazz floats through
nearly every scene, flashbacks are filmed in a hazy glow
(reminiscent of dream sequences on "Growing Pains")
and even minor characters have easily-summarized "bro
ken dreams" that they will share with you at the drop of a
taxi fare.
Taxi fare? Yes, the film takes place in New York, so all
the characters must display their sassy, sophisticated New
York variety of disillusionment.
The film is saved from sentimental mediocrity by sev
eral fantasy sequences in which LaGravenese breaks
through the jaded forty-something haze and plays with
the audience's expectations. Many of the fantasies are
laugh-out-loud funny, pointing out the differences
between what Judith wants and what she is actually
doing.
In general, "Living" gets better whenever LaGravenese
abandons the light jazz air, as when Judith takes ecstasy
for the first time, goes to an all-women's dance club and
starts hallucinating.
Both Hunter and DeVito, as Pat Francato, the door
man of Judith's apartment building, give wonderful per
formances. After his first few scenes, the audience is even
willing to accept DeVito as a romantic lead. The chem
istry between Hunter and DeVito makes their characters'
slightly odd interactions completely believable.
But despite its many redeeming elements and the per
formances by Hunter and DeVito, in the end, the film
simply isn't very interesting. Picture "As Good As it Gets,"

but with far less entertaining characters.
LaGravenese borrowed elements from two Anton
Chekhov short stories, "The Kiss" and "Misery." The key
eponymous scene in the former story also plays a key role
in "Living," and illustrates both the best and worst about
the film.
The scene takes place when Judith is at the light jazz
night club where Queen Latifah's well-played, if slightly
one-dimensional, character Liz Bailey sings. Judith acci
dentally walks into a storage closet where a stranger grabs

her and kisses her by mistake. He thinks she is someone
else.
This kiss is the beginning of Judith's emotional trans
formation. It could have been a simple, great scene, but
LaGravenese clutters it up by having the stranger solilo
quize about the ex-lover for whom he mistook Hunter. If
LaGravenese had created fewer broken dreams, we might
have cared more about the ones that mattered.
