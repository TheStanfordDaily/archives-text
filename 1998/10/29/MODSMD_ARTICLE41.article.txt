# How glam was my valley
## 'Velvet Goldmine' has more glimmer and shimmer than a disco ball 
### 
Superficiality was the name of the game, and both teams wore lipstick and fur. The
decade was the 70s, the movement was glam, and director Todd Haynes' ("Safe")
latest film, "Velvet Goldmine," may be the closest many of us will ever get.
"Goldmine" tells the story of a David Bowie-esque rock star, Brian Slade, played with
disturbingly effective nonchalance by Jonathon Rhys Meyers ("Michael Collins").
Half the fun of "Goldmine" comes from decoding many disguised pop culture ref
erences. Ewan McGregor pulls off a surprisingly believable American accent as the Iggy
Poppish Curt Wild, and yes, once again gives us the full monty (see "Trainspotting" and
"The Pillow Book" — is this part of his contract?). Haynes also provides us with a
Brian F.no character, a scene from "A Clockwork Orange" and a gay love scene between
Barbie dolls (possibly a reference to Haynes'"Superstar. The Karen Carpenter Story,"
which was acted entirely by Barbie dolls with voice-overs). There are many other refer
ences as well. The point is that "Goldmine" succeeds by imitating rather than innovat
ing, just like the glam movement. If you like one, you'll probably like the other.
The structure of the film as a whole comes from "Citizen Kane." A reporter played
by Christian Bale ("Little Women") is assigned to write a story about Slade on the tenth
anniversary of his mysterious "disappearance." In doing so, he must piece together
Slade's life through the words of his friends, lovers and wife, played by Toni Collette
("Emma") in one of the film's less convincing performances. Colette bounces back and
forth between British and American accents without ever explaining why. Sometimes it
was amusing, but other times it distracted from the main thrust of the film.

Even if you lack a penchant for men in make-up and love songs about space aliens,
"Goldmine" has much to offer. Haynes plays around with a huge array of film stock
footage, zooms and odd camera angles, even throwing several kitschy mock music
videos and concert scenes into the mix. One of the film's highlights is McGregor's
manic impersonation of Iggy Pop in concert.
"Goldmine" also attempts a massive plot twist involving Slade's disappearance,
though I felt it was one of the weaker elements in the movie. Haynes never fully devel
ops it. None of the characters seems care after the truth is revealed. I left the theater
feeling that a twist of this magnitude should have been dealt with more completely.
Also unsatisfying was "Goldmine" 's gratuitous series of references to the great
grandfather of glam, the currently übiquitous Oscar Wilde. Though intellectually it
makes sense to include Wilde, the texture of those scenes never mixed with the rest of
the film.
The plot twist and the Wilde sections barely detract from the overall texture of the
film, if only because they take up so little space For all of its camp and gimmicks,
"Goldmine" also has several very human, very touching scenes, in particular a few
flashbacks showing Bale's reporter during the height of glam, torn between attraction
to his idol, Brian Slade, and his repressive parents. All in all, "Velvet Goldmine" is just
that — a veritable mine of all the decadence that was glam culture.
