y fs the second weekend in a row when a movie about Nazism opens, Jjf
I and New Line's American History X n does one better than but week's
X tense drama "Apt Pupil" Ed Norton shines as fervent neo-Nazi Derek
Vinyard, a man who reforms himself and tries to do the same for his down
trodden family A mesmerizing and fascinating look at race relations,
"American History X" deserves considerable attention both from movie
goers and Academy members alike.
The film's title takes root from a special high school course taught sole
ly for Danny Vinyard (Eddie Furlong, Terminator 2"). Danny, Derek's
younger brother, has been a bad boy. After Danny writes a report on "Mein
KampfT principal Avery Brooks (Bob |weeney of "Star Trek: Deep Space
Nine") saves him from expulsion by meeting with him daily in lieu of his
tory class. Danny's first assignment? He must turn in a paper about his
reactions to Derek's criminal behavior and subsequent prison sentence.
The film opens with Derek's crime — perhaps one of the most vicious
homicides in cinematic history. And Danny was there to watch every
moment, of it I don't quite know how I would have reacted if I had seen
such a jristy; murder live, but I can tell you that Derek definitely deserved
to go to jail.
Meanwhile, Doris Vinyard (Beverly DAngelo, "Vegas Vacation") has led
the life of a single mom ever since her husband was gunned down under
mysterious circumstances. She has developed a smoking habit, and has
struggled to make ends meet in her apartment in Venice, Calif. Doris does-

n't want Danny to follow the same downward spiral as Derek, but she has
little power to prevent Danny from talking to white supremacists like
Cameron (Stacy Reach), the local ring-leader.
But things change while Derek is in prison for over three years. The
swastika may still be tattooed on his chest, but his hair has grown out and
his'mind-set has changed dramatically,, Racism no longer consumes his
thinking or his actions.
The crucial question of the film is whether Derek can save his family
from further suffering. It was haunting and difficult to sit through the var
ious misadventures of the Vinyard family. 1 did not have a clue about what
direction the story was taking, but 1 remained entranced at the proceed
ings. Were they going to make it? Were there going to be any repercussions
from Derek's transformation?
First-time movie director Tony Kaye gets some veteran help from exec
utive producer Steve Tisch ("Forrest Gump"), among others, to manufac
ture a challenging look at a disparate family. Flashbacks, shown for the
most part in black and white, are used with great effect to show the
Vinyards' background and history. If nothing else, this film is a painstak
ingly vivid study on racism which people should watch and discuss after
wards. But as long as you can stomach the racial epithets and bone-jarring
violence "American History X" is both a must-see film and a painful
remainder about the powers to hate and to accept.
