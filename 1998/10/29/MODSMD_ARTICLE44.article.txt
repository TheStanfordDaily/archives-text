# Outkast
## 'Aquemini' 
### 
Known for its lyrical knowledge, humor, fast-talking southern twang and drawling sing-song cho
ruses, Outkast is a group whose third album, "Aquemini" (LaFace Records) does not disappoint.
Outkast continues its traditions with "West Savannah," a song reminiscent of The Pharcyde's
style on "She Keeps on Passin' Me By," "Liberation," a song featuring funk and soul queen Erykah Badu,
and "Skew It on the Bar-B," a new rendition of classic old-school hip-hop featuring Chef Raekwon of
Wu-Tang Clan. Yet, Outkast adds a lot of twists and spins to traditional hip-hop, as well as adding a few
new elements to southern hip hop on "Aquemini."

Named for rappers Big Boi's and Dre's astrological signs, Aquarius and Gemini,
the title song,"Aquemini" reaffirms the group's tight relationship through all

types of uncertainty: "Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually
die / Horoscopes often lie / Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain,

nothing lasts forever / But until they close the curtain, it's him and I,
Aquemini."

Although the group's music is primarily upbeat, modern
and urban, the hook on the "Rosa Parks" track has a Civil
Rights era blues-country feel to it. Harmonicas are accompa
nied by knee slaps, hand claps and a crowd's background excited
cheers. Outkast uses the track "Rosa Parks" as a hip-hop

metaphor and a reminder to keep producing ever-new quality
music. Dre tries to explain the challenge for artists to keep mak
ing new music rather than lazily relying on their old hits: "I met

a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game / To stimulate
then activate the left and right brain / Said baby boy you're

only as funky as your last cut / You focus on the past your
ass'll be a has-what."

Parliament member George Clinton is featured on the
track "Synthesizer." On this cut, simple bass rhythms, kick
drum and reverb combine into a robotic cyber song.
Outkast's and Clinton's joined voices fade in and out over
the electronic music as they sing about cosmetic surgery,

genetic cloning, computer viruses, fertility drugs and "psycho-

sodomy."

From songs about the problems of the modern world to phat old-school
beats, there's a lot worth listening to on Outkast's third album, "Aquemini
