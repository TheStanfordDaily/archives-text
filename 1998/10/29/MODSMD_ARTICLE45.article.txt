# Jay-Z
## 'In My Life, Vol. 2' 
### 
Who is Jay-Z? Is he the man known as Shawn Carter, Jay-
Hovah or just simply Jigga? Is he the man who excited the
hip-hop world with his venomous lyrics on his debut
album, "Reasonable Doubt," or is he the man who shocked us with his
dramatic-yet-awkward shift to a new mainstream sound on his
sophomore album, "In My Lifetime Vol. 1"?
Jay-Z's third album has brings us a compromise. "In My Lifetime
Vol. 2: The Hard Knock Life," his best album to date, shows a new ver
satile Jay-Z fulfilling his potential. Hip-hop purists will be impressed
by the plethora of lyrics and flows, yet the album should get consider
able airplay with a number of radio-friendly tracks. The self-pro
claimed "King of New York" hits Broadway with one of the year's
finest tracks by sampling the musical "Annie" on a street anthem, "The
Hard Knock Life." Cameos from hip-hop superstars DMX and Too
Short on "Money, Cash, Hoes" and "A Week Ago" enhance the impres
sive list of tracks.
The key factor that distinguishes this album from Jay-Z's earlier
work is the extraordinary production. With an A-list of producers
including Erick Sermon, DJ Premier, Timbaland as well as Jermaine
Dupri, Jay-Z flows uncompromisingly over the fierce beats on this
album. Club fiends will be satisfied with the hit singles, "Money Ain't
a Thang" and "Can I Get a...
The album reaches its pinnacle with three songs: "If I Should Die,"
"Ride or Die," and "Reservoir Dogs." The first two display Jay-Z's lyri
cal gunfire, while the last song samples the theme song to "Shaft" and
lets Jay-Z collaborate with The Lox, Beanie Siegal and Sauce Money.
No one is perfect, however, and the wonder-mic from the Marcy
Projects has his share of flaws. The glaring defect on the album sur
faces with the overabundance of guest appearances. Every song with
the exception of "Ride or Die" has a guest vocalist, many of whom are
no-name rappers on Roc-A Fella Records, which produces a rather
watered-down result. However, one of these artists shines; Memphis
Bleek proves to be Jay-Z's heir. Whatever the album's shortcomings,
Jay-Z has cleverly created one of the year's best hip-hop albums.
