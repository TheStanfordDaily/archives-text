# Symposium
## 'On the Outside' 
### 
If you wanna talk about chick magnets, Symposium has all of the right things going
for it. The members of this five piece pop-punk band hails from West London, giv
ing them the perfect British accent. The band also has youth on its side, with the
oldest member of the group checking in at 21, and has a mainstream sound that one
can imagine hearing on Live 105 in between Blink and MxPx.
Unlike the straightforward SoCa] punk rock sounds of "Dammit," however,
Symposium is far from London's answer to Green Day, as British Billboard Magazine
has labeled it. Newly signed to Red Ant Entertainment on Mercury Records, the band
now has major label backing for its first full length LP, "On the Outside," after a string
of singles and EP releases in the UK. Originally a cover band started in 1994 by singer
Ross Cummings, the addition of bassist and chief songwriter Wojtek Godzisz allowed
Symposium to be more than just a bunch of teenagers with instruments and amplifiers.
With Cummings doling out a characteristically British high-pitched edge in his
voice, the album starts off with three mid-tempo songs in"The Answer To Why 1 Hate
You," "Bury You," and "Impossible." Guitarists Hagop Tchaparian and William
McGonagle provide most of the musical drive behind these and other songs occupying
the first half of the album that have a sound typical to the genre commonly referred to
as post-punk. Symposium maintains much of this feel throughout "On the Outside,"
kind of like Supergrass on pot—a mellower style of punk that has the same energy as
its fellow countrymates, only not the same tempo.
There are, of course, notable tracks that stray from this sound, such as the power-bal
lad-like "Blue" spanning over five minutes, an almost unheard of length of time for an
alleged punk song, or the British single "Drink the Sunshine," which is catchy as singles
tend to come, but contains weak lyrical offerings such as "A, B, C, D, E, F, G / Hurry chil
dren don't you dare be late."
Overall, Symposium's lyrics are not exactly the type that make you ponder the mean

ing of life, but they go mostly unnoticed as the album comes to a close and the music
picks up the pace, especially on the tracks "Farewell to Twilight" and "Stay On the
Outside." Keeping in mind that this band is so young, "On the Outside" offers a lot of
potential for the group to grow as musicians and songwriters, and in the meantime, you
can still pop this puppy into your stereo, light up a fag, and pretend you're right there
in the pit.
