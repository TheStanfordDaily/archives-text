# Mudhoney
## Tomorrow Hit Today' 
### 
I grew up in Washington state, not far from Seattle,
and the very first "grunge" band I heard about was
Mudhoney. The group sounded punkish and brutal,
! but it possessed that mysterious legitimacy that can be
i so appealing to teenagers.
Record executives then descended upon Seattle and
• made superstars out of Pearl Jam, Nirvana,
! Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. Mudhoney was the
I band for the type of people who liked to talk about the
i "real" grunge scene.
However, now that the grunge movement has run its
! course, Mudhoney is still doing what it has always done,
! making solid punk-rock flavored with a warped pop
• sensibility. Their latest album, "Tomorrow Hit Today,"
j (Warner Bros. Records) is proof of the band's continued
: vitality.
i On the opening track, "A Thousand Forms Of Mind,"

the lead vocalist Mark Arm declares, "At least my lungs
are still breathing / At least my heart still beats / At least
my brain is still thinking / At least that's what I believe,"
a powerful statement considering the self-destructive
nature of many grunge bands. When he screams "Get
behind me / Stand back all you devils," one can believe
his conviction. More importantly, the song bases itself in
a strong groove, which matches the lyrical resolve beat
by beat.
The rest of the album maintains this intensity level
with stylistic variations. "Try To Be Kind" and "Real Low
Vibe" feature a shuffle beat which suggests Mudhoney
has taken a few successful lessons from the country
punk movement. "I Have To Laugh" is a strong, straight
ahead rocker, proving Lou Reed was right when he said
that one chord is fine and two is pushing it.
On "This Is The Life," the group reasserts its anti-cor

porate stance: "Walked the forty-million miles of strip j
malls / And I painted the sky with aerosol / Plugged the i
hole in your pocket from credit cards / And clouded j
your eyes with sit-coms." The song maintains an itchy, i
organic pulse reminiscent of the Stooge's caustic "Fun j
House" album. Arm sounds almost as frightening as Iggy i
Pop did, and the band proves its allegiance to punk's j
roots. Unlike their grunge cousins, Mudhoney was not i
just reworking '80s metal to sound like punk; the band j
always stayed squarely within punk's proud tradition. i
"Tomorrow Hit Today" is not a perfect album—the i
relentless energy level could leave a few listeners feeling j
queasy. Nonetheless, true punk, if that ideal has ever i
been achieved, demands no compromises, and not a sin- j
gle compromise exists on Mudhoney's latest album.
