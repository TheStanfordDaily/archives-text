# Vanilla Ice
## 'Hard to Swallow' 
### 
America's favorite mock-icon, Vanilla Ice, has transformed himself into an angry
industrial rocker and the end result is not pretty. You'll place Ice's "Hard to
Swallow" in your CD player expecting some light-hearted, meaningless, white
boy rap that is fun to laugh at and fun to dance to. What you'll receive, though, is messy,
abrasive white-boy noise that is impossible to laugh at and, well, probably pretty dan
gerous to dance to.
The Iceman has re-created his image, stealing ideas and attitudes from all over the
rock world. Ice tries to pull off the pure anger of Rage Against the Machine. He tries to
duplicate the haunting beats of Prodigy. He attempts the industrial sounds of White
Zombie. Unfortunately, each of these experiments fail, sounding only like cheap rip
offs. Well, at least that's one thing that's remiscent of his "Ice, Ice Baby" days.
"Hard to Swallow" feels like nothing less than a violation. It is difficult to accept that
this angry, confused rock was produced by the same fellow who brought us the light
hearted "Ice, Ice Baby." Sure, the original Vanilla Ice is the most lampooned rapper ever;
he has been a constant joke since junior high school. All I know is that at the junior high
dances, Ice's song was the only song silly enough to break me out of my adolescent dis
comfort and get me a-dancin*. "Swallow" garners no such reaction. Vanilla Ice is no

longer even allowing you to laugh at him. The noise pushes you away, before you can
even formulate any sort of mock appreciation.
At first, it seemed Vanilla was prepared to embrace the criticism of his past releases,
accept it, and move on to making some real music. One of the early tracks, featuring an
unprintable title, ends with a voice saying some harsh words about Ice's earlier work,
particularly "Ice, Ice Baby." Apparently, though, these angry words were only included
to explain Ice's vengeful rage.
Another track, "Too Cold," shows that Ice has not moved on and is still hopelessly
wrapped up in the hit single that resulted in both his fame and his disrepute. "Too
Cold" is an uninteresting, industrialized version of, you guessed it, "Ice, Ice Baby."
With "Hard to Swallow," Vanilla Ice has definitely tried something new. The question
remains as to why he so unsuccessfully attempted to tackle the sounds of Rage Against
the Machine and Prodigy, and why his record label allowed him to make the attempt.
Vanilla Ice's new CD is certainly hard to swallow And let me tell you, it tastes even
worse coming back up.
