## SCHMUCK AND PUTZ 'L.A. Story' presents L.A. with a twist of lemon 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Veteran Los Angelenos Schmuck and Putz craved a cultural
experience that reflected their beloved City of Angels with
true accuracy. After considering such classics as "Sunset
Boulevard," "Day of the Locust" and "Chinatown," they settled on
what was suprisingly an enjoyable experience for both of them.
Schmuck suggested that they "do lunch" to discuss the flick "L.A.
Story." Here's what they had to say:
Putz; Rarely does one find himself at home in a motion picture.
But, Schmuck — Steve Martin's witty film is chock-full of moments
that make me homesick. The nose jobs, the cell phones, the
implants, and the Double Decaf Half Caps With A Twist of
Lemon — I'm salivating just thinking about it all. Martin, who
wrote the script and plays weather man Harris Telemacher, deftly
explores the notion of L.A. as an intellectual-free zone by quoting
various philosophers every chance he gets. There's even a graveyard
scene & la "Hamlet" that couldn't be a better homage to Shakespeare.
What results is the portrait of a man too smart for his surround
ings — the exact opposite of you, Schmuck. Harris falls madly in
love with the British gal Sara, smartly played by Victoria Tennant
(whatever happened to her?), who's trying to patch things up with
her ex, a perfectly snooty Richard Grant (what's he up to? Smarmy
British movies?).
True, it isn't hard to poke fun at Beverly Hills, but under the
detailed direction of Mick lackson (anything lately? Maybe some
porno flicks ), Martin scores big with scenes that still give me
endless hours of uproarious laughter. It's also a treat to see Sarah
Jessica Parker in her best role so far — SanDeE (spelled precisely
like that with a little star at the end and a heart around it). Her
spunk and overwhelming energy might rank her performance as
one of the best dit7.y portrayals ever. SanDeE aspires to be a hand
model, and she's taking classes to learn the proper gestures. Her idea
of a good date is a visit to the California Colonic Institute. When
Harris and SanDeE finally get together, Harris says "SanDeE, your
breasts feel strange," to which she replies, "That's because they're
real," with a perfectly nonchalant and innocent attitude. That's L.A.
for you.
Schmuck: I agree; it's the details in "L.A. Story" that make it
stand out as one of the best. When Martin jumps in his car and dri

ves next door to go to his friend Ariel's house, you can relate,
Putz — you hop on your bike to go to the dining hail.
If you want to check out LA.'s most chic, shallow, plastic surgery
ridden restaurants, "L.A Story" is for you. As Steve Martin enters the
cafc to meet some of his "best friends" (people he can't stand being
around), you're hit with the true fakeness of the people. Everyone
kisses on the cheek, stands up and hugs, so that it takes nearly five
minutes for them to just sit down — not to mention that they all
show up nearly an hour late. Putz, isn't it great that when Martin
and his "best friends" order coffee, everyone has to have a different
type of overly-specialized drink? I can't even remember one of the
coffees' names. While they're sipping their decaf half caps with non
fat milk, an earthquake shakes up the scene. Tables slide, chairs fall
over. But hey, in LA. it's just another earthquake. Does anyone stop
talking or enjoying their delicious coffees? Of course not!
The second restaurant scene is even better. Remember,
Telemacher has to be personally interviewed just to get into this
place. Finally, after lots of begging and pleading he is allowed to
order "the chicken" because it's the only thing he can afford, accord
ing to his bank statement. Unfortunately, the first opening for a
table isn't for eight weeks.
Putz: I know restaurants like that — for God's sake, Schmuck,
you practically have to do unmentionable favors for the maitre d' to
get a reservation.
Some of Martin's subtle humor turns out to be his best in the
film. You probably missed a lot of the intellectual jokes, Schmuck,
but one of my favorites is the fact that the restaurant you just talked
about was called "L'idiot."
Much of this film's success comes from the way in which Martin
strays away from broad humor. His moments with the wisdom-dis
pensing traffic sign on the freeway are so clever — nay, ingenious —
because they make us laugh without resorting to the common tech
niques we find so often recycled from film to film.
Schmuck: Putz, I can't live with any more of your abuse. I'm just
as interilectual as you are, so shut up. But let me tell you that Martin
brings home the gold with this one. "L.A Story" typifies some of his
most clever and witty material ever.
The bottom line:
Schmuck and Putz agree (for once): It's better than drinking a
half cap in the tanning salon.
