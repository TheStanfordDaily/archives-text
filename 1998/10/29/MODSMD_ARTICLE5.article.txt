# Early Decision II dead
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Due to the University's decision
to consolidate Early Decisions I and
11, this year's admission's process will
be the first with only one round of
early decision.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Admission and Financial Aid
found that three consecutive rounds
of admissions, Early Decisions I, II
and regular, put an unnecessary
strain on administrators.
"We get about twice as many ap
plicants for the first round of early de
cision than for the second. Applicants
from the first pool tend to be stronger
academically, and around twice as
many are admitted," stated commit
tee chair Margaret Brandeau, a pro
fessor of industrial engineering.

Three rounds of admissions de
manded enormous amounts of work,
especially when combined with last
year's record number of applications,
roughly IK.WX). "The admissions of
fice was completely swamped,"
Brandeau said.
The committee found that Early
Decision 11 was not serv ing its intend
ed purpose. Both rounds were insti
tuted in 19% by then-Dean of Ad
missions and Financial Aid James
Montoya to encourage a larger por
tion of admitted freshmen to enroll.
"We were losing students to
schools we wouldn't otherwise be
cause of early admissions policies,"
stated Montoya in 1994.
Brandeau said that Early Deci
sion II was especially meant for
"schools which aren't feeders to
Stanford." and was designed to at

tract "geographically targeted mi
norities," who perhaps have had less
opportunity to talk to guidance coun
selors and are less sure of where they
want to go. However, more minori
ties were being admitted through
Early Decision I and regular admis
sion than through Early Decision 11.
Stanford was one of the only col
leges to have two rounds of early de
cision. Bob Kinnally, current dean of
admissions and financial aid. said the
duplicate rounds were often "confus
ing for students." Kinnally found that
guidance counselors from around the
country agreed it would be fine to re
move Stanford's second round.
Of the 2.505 students accepted to
Stanford last year, 611 were early de
cision applicants and only 2(K) of
these were from the early decision II
pool.
