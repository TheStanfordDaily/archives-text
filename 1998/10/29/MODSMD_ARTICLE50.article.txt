## Free Sexx So forlorn without my porn 
### Roxy Sass 
The sun is high in the sky as you return from
classes. You park your bike and skip up the steps
into your dorm. A quick walk brings you to your
door, which swings soundlessly open when you
turn the handle. There, in the room, sits your
roommate. She's leaning back in her chair,
absorbed in what she is doing on her computer.
Nothing unusual here.
Now imagine that your roommate, who
seemed so normal earlier in the year, is naked as
she sits at her desk. The computer screen in front
of her is filled with neither term paper nor uS
program, but rather pictures of more naked peo
ple, carousing around like buffaloes in April. The
amount of flesh in the room would make Traci
Lords blush.
The story sounds like an urban legend invented
to make frosh everywhere thank their lucky stars
that their roomie's only quirk is a love of bossa
nova. But it was the eye-popping reality for an
acquaintance of Miss Sass. Forty dollars for an in
room connection (those were the days) had
opened up a world of down-loadable movies and
air-brushed pictures, and apparently the roomie
planned to get her money's worth. Miss Sass*
friend put in for a transfer.
Which leads a person to ponder: What about
this cyberporn? Since the advent off the World
Wide Web, the porn connoisseur has a whole new
industry catering just to him or her. Anywhere
from 50 to 75 percent of the content of the Web
reportedly consists of nudie pics, which is a fact
you can relate to if you've ever tried to search for
sex or health info and instead been barraged with
'Helga's Hooters Home Page.' Even paper news
stand titles like 'Swank,' 'Yank' and 'Crank' now
have electronic versions floating about in the
ether.
And it doesn't stop there. Have you heard of the
site that displays your daily stock quotes alongside
artfully arranged naked women? One knows the
How Jones isn't the only thing rising. Or, there is
the site that promises naked celebrity pics, though
whether it actually is Kathy Lee Gifford in the
nurse's outfit is questionable. And how about a
page full of Kitty Porn? That's rightâ€”cute, little
cats shown in all manners of compromising posi
tions. There seems to be a little something for
everyone.
Dear reader, Miss Sass can read your mind.
You're thinking, what does this mean for me, an
intelligent and generally mainstream Stanford
student? Sure, you say, I've bumped into the occa
sional porn site while innocently surfing for
library hours. Did I search on keyword "jugs," you
ask? I wanted some information on kitchenware.
Maybe you'll even admit to having been lured into
clicking on the deceptive "Free Pics" link (which
does, in fact, get you free pics of all the thingsHftfr
advertisers want to sell you). Maybe you won't. |
Either way, Miss Sass knows you're curious and
she thinks you should humor that notion. While
cyberporn does provide some unfortunate fuel for
immodest roommates, it is also a great venue for
the porn novice. In the privacy of your room (or
computer cluster if you're daring), you can find
out what titillates, what tempts and what troubles

you. Just a few words of advice to get you started,
excerpted from Miss Sass's own recently released
"Cyberporn for Dummies":
Keep an open mind, but don't be afraid to close
an image that offends you. Even the most liberal
thinker is bound to stumble onto a site that makes
his or her milk curdle.
"Don't have too many windows open on your
desktop at the same time. Porn sites love little
pop-up advertisements and even whole pages. But
if you let enough of those suckers pile up,
Netscape will pass out.
"Pesky passwords can stop a Web surfer cold.
To get around them, you can (a) get a trial mem
bership that is free for a month, and then cancel it,
(b) actually subscribe to a system like Adult
Check, which is a no-fail way to gain access, and
isn't too expensive if you split the cost with sever
al like-minded friends, or (c) try to guess the user
name and password to a site. This third option
actually works sometimes, if you let a sixth grade
mindset control your guessing; Most of the
name/password combos are rather sophomoric,
and many you'd find in bathroom graffiti."
Additionally, keep in mind that potholes in the
online porn parade do exist. No 2-inch by 2-inch
computerized movie will ever look the same as a
full-screen film. Depending on the computer, the
small, pixilated picture may play so haltingly that
it looks more like a break dancing promo than a
porn (lick. You may also miss that tinny disco beat
that marks a true porno since the cyberporn often
lacks a soundtrack. Plus, there is that certain
ambiance that only a darkened theater provides.
But for many, cyberporn is a great way to dip
one's figurative toes into the porn pool. The
advantages of privacy and your comfy, clean desk
chair mustn't be undereniphasized. Take it from
one who knows. Your very own Miss Sass went to
a porno flick with her dormitory during her fresh
man year (in a lapse of good R.A. judgment, 1
might add). As if the idea wasn't odd enough, the
movie showing was of the 3-D ilk, complete with
cardboard glasses. Needless to say, dear reader,
having an enormous penis swoop out just above
one's head rather damages a girl's psyche. (Note:
the evening was most damaging to the sweet Utah
boy who won a blow-up sheep just for sitting in
the right place.) Though on the whole the experi
ence broadened our group's horizons, a quiet
night of cyberporn would have been a far better
choice.
