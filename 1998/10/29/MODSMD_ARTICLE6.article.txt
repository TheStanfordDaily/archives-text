# Lungren scrambles for votes in California's governor race
## 
### Tyrone Prather 
The stakes are high for Attorney
General Dan Lungren in the race for
governor of California.
With a victory over Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis on Nov. 3, the Republican can
didate can continue the agenda of the
outgoing administration of Gov. Pete
Wilson and share a measure of con
trol over the state's political future
with the Democrat-controlled As
sembly and Senate. Also, the incom
ing governor will have oversight of
crucial redistricting plans, as well as
the appointment of members to the
state Board of Education and the ju
diciary after 2(XX).
But with an Oct. 25 Los Angeles
Times poll putting Davis in the lead
by 11 points, Lungren will be hard
pressed to make up ground by Elec
tion Day. To do so, he will need to

sway the undecid
ed 10 percent of
California's vot
ers.
"It's hard to
see what | Lun
gren] could do to
change people's
minds if he hasn't

already done it by now," said Stan
lord Political Science Prof. Paul Sni
derman.
In his gubernatorial campaign,
Lungren has focused on his record as
attorney general to present himself to
voters as an experienced crime fight
er. Crime has dropped 30 percent in
California during Lungren's tenure,
to its lowest levels in 30 years. He was
a strong advocate of the 1993 "Three
Strikes" crime legislation and a pro
ponent of a state law that created a
phone number that citizens can call

to learn the identities of convicted
child molesters released from prison.
1 .ungren has also said he will push
for revision of the state education
code. He is in favor of school choice
vouchers and student and teacher
standards testing. For higher educa
tion. Lungren supports public-pri
vate partnerships between industry
and universities to provide students
with valuable skills and training.
"If we are going to march into the
next century with confidence in our
vision of the future, we need a well
educated workforce," Lungren de
clared on his official Web site,
http://www.lungrenforgovernor.org.
Lungren. a graduate of the Uni
versity of Notre Dame in I%X and
Georgetown University l.aw School
in 1971, dove into politics early. He
