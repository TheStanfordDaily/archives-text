# Lungren scrambles for votes in California's governor race
## 
### Tyrone Prather 
The stakes are high for Attorney
General Dan Lungren in the race for
governor of California.
With a victory over Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis on Nov. 3, the Republican can
didate can continue the agenda of the
outgoing administration of Gov. Pete
Wilson and share a measure of con
trol over the state's political future
with the Democrat-controlled As
sembly and Senate. Also, the incom
ing governor will have oversight of
crucial redistricting plans, as well as
the appointment of members to the
state Board of Education and the ju
diciary after 2(XX).
But with an Oct. 25 Los Angeles
Times poll putting Davis in the lead
by 11 points, Lungren will be hard
pressed to make up ground by Elec
tion Day. To do so, he will need to

sway the undecid
ed 10 percent of
California's vot
ers.
"It's hard to
see what | Lun
gren] could do to
change people's
minds if he hasn't

already done it by now," said Stan
lord Political Science Prof. Paul Sni
derman.
In his gubernatorial campaign,
Lungren has focused on his record as
attorney general to present himself to
voters as an experienced crime fight
er. Crime has dropped 30 percent in
California during Lungren's tenure,
to its lowest levels in 30 years. He was
a strong advocate of the 1993 "Three
Strikes" crime legislation and a pro
ponent of a state law that created a
phone number that citizens can call

to learn the identities of convicted
child molesters released from prison.
1 .ungren has also said he will push
for revision of the state education
code. He is in favor of school choice
vouchers and student and teacher
standards testing. For higher educa
tion. Lungren supports public-pri
vate partnerships between industry
and universities to provide students
with valuable skills and training.
"If we are going to march into the
next century with confidence in our
vision of the future, we need a well
educated workforce," Lungren de
clared on his official Web site,
http://www.lungrenforgovernor.org.
Lungren. a graduate of the Uni
versity of Notre Dame in I%X and
Georgetown University l.aw School
in 1971, dove into politics early. He


Lungren
started as an aide to U.S. Sens.
George Murphy and Bill Brock from
1969 to 1971. Lungren represented
his hometown of Long Beach in the
House from 1978 to 1988.
He was elected attorney general
in 1990 and won reelection in a land
slide in 1994.
Lungren is viewed as an ally of
commerce in the Bay Area. Earlier
this month, Lungren picked up the
endorsement of 80 Silicon Valley in
vestors and executives, largely be
cause of his opposition to Proposition
211, a failed 1996 securities measure
that would have made it easier for in
dividuals to sue companies that dis
tributed financial information that
the individuals felt was false, mislead
ing or incomplete.
He supports relaxation of envi
ronmental regulations in order to
promote economic growth, but in

sists that this does not make him an
opponent of environmentalism.
"I do not believe that if you are
pro-environment you are anti-busi
ness, and if you are pro-business you
are anti-environment," Lungren said
in a position paper. "It is a false di
chotomy. California cannot afford to
be divided into two hostile camps —
environment versus business."
Stanford junior Ryan Parks, co
chair of Stanford College Republi
cans, said his organization sees Lun
gren as the common sense choice for
governor and said that Davis' posi
tions on crime, taxes and education
are harmful to both the state and the
University's future.
"If you look at the two records
side by side, and if this [undecided] 10
percent votes their conscience, they
can't vote for anyone but Lungren,"
Parks said. "He's really going to take
the state in the right direction."
In a debate on Oct. 15, Davis ar
gued that Lungren would "take us
backward on a woman's right to

choose, backward on education,
backward on human rights and even
on smoking."
Lungren, an opponent of the Roe
v. Wade decision, has softened bis
abortion stance in recent months,
saying he would allow abortion in
cases of rape, incest or threat to a
woman's life.
"As a practicing Catholic, I be
lieve very deeply in the sanctity of in
nocent life and its protection as a mat
ter of societal good," Lungren saifl in
a statement. "Therefore, I come t,o
my pro-life position based upon my
religious, moral and ethical convjc
tions."
In 1996, Lungren was chosen bv
Time Magazine as one of 10 "Rising
Republicans" in the country.
Lungren, 52, lives in Sacramento
with his wife of 29 years, Bobbi. They
have three children — Jeff, 25; Kelly,
23; and Kathleen, 22.
