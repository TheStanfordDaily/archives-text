# Hospital workers may be unionized
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
A service employees union trying
to organize at Stanford Hospital and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
held its first informational meeting
with workers yesterday, three weeks
before the IJSIX) workers will vote on
whether or not to join the union.
Fifty to 60 employees came to
hear leaders from the Service Em
ployees International Union as they
held meetings at the Lucie Stern
Community Center in Palo Alto. The
room was so packed that latecomers
and their children had to sit on the
floor.
Workers have been organizing
since Stanford and UCSF merged a
year ago, saying they are overworked
and underpaid.
The union vote, to be held Nov. 19
and 20, will involve janitors, mainte
nance workers, dietary food service
employees and nursing assistants.
Stanford nurses already belong to a
different union, and 1,100 other Stan
ford employees belong to the service
employees' union.
"We're understaffed and over
worked," said support service aide
Juan Robinson. "My main concern is
having a voice, having a say in patient
care."
The efforts to unionize started
when Stanford University Medical
Center and the UC-San Francisco
Medical Center merged a year ago.
In June, hospital workers circulat
ed a petition on unionization. Once a
majority of the employees were in
terested in unionizing, they went
through the process of filing with the
National Labor Relations Board to
ask for recognition.
"I think it goes beyond the merg
er," said Lou Eleby-Williams, a unit
secretary at the Medical Center. "It's
years of not getting correct informa
tion and having promises broken. As
an older employee. I feel it's impor
tant to have a decent retirement
plan."
Union leaders agree that employ
ee organizing would give the workers

a louder voice in hospital affairs.
"A lot of people in the Stanford
community can relate to farm work
ers, but when it comes to people or
ganizing in their back d00r... people
in the Stanford community can be
very concerned about helping people
in Guatemala and Mexico, but not
next door. It's a contradiction in
America," said Warren Mar, an
AFL-CIO coordinator in Oakland.
Stanford officials in the Provost's
Office and in the Medical School
could not be reached for comment.
According to UCSF-Stanford
Health Care spokesman Mike Las
siter, the workers don't need to join a
union. USHC contends that its work
ers are paid more than comparable
ones at unionized hospitals.
The union, however, argues that
unionized nurse aides, orderlies and
attendants make up to 43.1 percent
more than non-unionized employees
throughout the industry.
"In terms of wages, we are very
competitive with unionized hospitals
in the area," Lassiter said. "We did a
comparison with 19 job classifica
tions, and ours are the highest pay
levels."
I'his year, Stanford Hospital em
ployees received, on average, a 3 per
cent raise plus a 1 percent bonus com
ing in November.
The workers' mood at the meet
ing was questioning yet confident.
When asked if he thought the major
ity of the workers would vote to join
the union, Robinson said yes.
"There's a lot of support, especial
ly judging from the turnout today,"
Robinson said. "A lot of employees
are afraid that they'll get fired for
voicing their opinions. But yesterday
1 wore my 'For our patients, our com
munities, ourselves' sticker, and I
didn't get fired."
The drive to unionize, unanimous
or not. has garnered opposition from
UCSF-Stanford Health Care.
"Stanford as an entity has done
what it can to prevent workers from
aiming together," said Lisa Hub
bard. a union spokeswoman. "They
hired the Burke Group... to conduct
meetings in the guise of training."
The Burke Group is a Malibu
based management consulting firm
hired by Stanford, which also oper
ates under the name Labor Informa
tion Services.
Lassiter offered a different expla
nation for the firm's hiring. "The
Burke Group is a consultant organi

zation we've hired to help us inform
our employees about the National
Labor Relations Act and the Nation
al Labor Relations Board so that our
employees can make informed deci
sions."
The Burke Group has conducted
several meetings for Stanford-UCSF
health-care workers.
"They've summarized the Nation
al Labor Relations Board bylaws,"
Robinson said. The meetings were
"somewhat informative, but when
we asked questions, they didn't really
answer them."
Stanford was represented at yes

terday's forum only by a photograph
of Peter Van Etten, head of IJSIIC,
propped up next to Brian Perkins
from Assemblyman Ted Lempert's
office, who could not attend.
"We made it clear to the union
that we'd be pleased to [come to the
meeting]," Lassiter said. "But we
didn't want to violate any rules. It's
not from lack of wanting to partic
ipate."
Under the National Labor Rela
tions Act, according to Lassiter, a
union is free to say whatever it wants
in such a meeting.
Most parties present at the meet

ing disagreed with Stanford's deci
sion not to attend. "Their absence is
not based on grounds we consider
valid." said Fr. (Jcne Boyle of the San
Jose's Roman Catholic diocese.
"That's not the case at all."
Perkins reinforced Boyle's state
ment. "We're disappointed that
Stanford is not here," he said.
"If we could have gotten it in writ
ing from the NLRB that we could
have participated, we would have,"
Lassiter said.
Overall, most people at the meet
ing were confident that the workers
would vote to unionize.
