# Butler talks ethics of nuclear weapons
## 
### Dan Zlatnik 
In his long military career, Cien.
Lee Butler, former commander in
chief of the Strategic Air Command,
has passionately dealt with ethics as it
applies to nuclear weapons strategy.
In the speech he delivered Wednes
day at Lane History Corner, his
stance was emphatic and absolute.
Without a doubt, nuclear weapons
strategy is a major ethical issue.
Butler advocates eliminating nu
clear weapons and thus suffocating
the nuclear age, a time whose infancy
was marked by confusion, fear and
paranoia, and fed off of our "primal
urge to destroy completely."
Nuclear weapons are grossly mis
understood. according to Butler. He
charged that they are not even
weapons but are "insanely damag
ing" tools whose utter destruction
lingers for generations and genera
tions.
Butler's views are based on expe
rience. He commanded armed nu
clear weapons sites on lull alert, took
part in negotiations with Russia dur
ing the Cold War, and served as a
chief advisor to the president on nu
clear strategy.

He claimed that decisions during
the Cold War were made without un
derstanding the risks and conse
quences involved. When he inherited
the Nuclear Weapons Strategy Plan,
he found it to be "the most intellectu
ally and morally bankrupt docu
ment" he had ever seen. What had
not been considered enough was
that, when dealing with nuclear
weapons, the stakes encompass not
only the nations involved, he said,
but also "the fate of mankind."
The United States still has thou
sands of tons of nuclear weapons
poised and ready to tire, he said. But
ler said he believes we have become
accustomed to nuclear warheads'
"hideous presence," and he finds this
"incomprehensible and morally in
tolerable."
He urged the elimination of these
weapons and an end to the use of nu
clear weapons as a measure of world
power.
Beyond the military and technical
matters, however, Butler ultimately
stressed the ethical heart of the mat
ter. As a society, he said, the issue
comes down to the simple decision to
be either brash and destructive or
"civilized and decent."
