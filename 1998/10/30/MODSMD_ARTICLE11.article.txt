## Swift response to bombing Arafat places Hamas leader under house arrest

GUSH KATIF JUNCTION. Gaza Strip
(AP) — It took only a second for Israeli sol
diers escorting the school bus to realize some
thing was terribly wrong. Within moments,
two people were dead. Within hours, Yasser
Arafat launched an unprecedented crack
down on Islamic militants.
Arafat put Sheik Ahmed Yassin under
house arrest Thursday after his militant
Islamic group. Hamas, claimed responsibility
for the bombing that targeted the red-and
white bus full of elementary school children.
The 40 students on board were saved —
not a single one was hurt — but the car bomb
killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a 19-year
old immigrant from Ukraine now being
praised as a fallen hero.
Political reverberations from the explosion
the first suicide attack against Israelis in six
months — were swift. Coming only six days
after the signing of a land-for-security agree
ment in Washington, it was a destabilizing
new factor in what is already a highly delicate
prelude to implementing the accord. That
process is to start next week.
Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of
Hamas, which bitterly opposes any peace with
Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
As the bus from Kfar Darom. an isolated
Jewish settlement in the heart of the Pales

tinian-controlled Gaza Strip, passed a busy
intersection Thursday, a car with Palestinian
plates tried to cut into the convoy and ram it.
The lead army jeep, one of two escorting
the bus, rushed to block the car's path — and
took the brunt of a blast so powerful it flipped
the jeep like a toy.
It was a suicide blast; the car's driver died
too. Six others — three Israelis and three
Palestinians — were hurt. Israeli troops
quickly sealed off the Gaza Strip, preventing
any Palestinians from leaving.
In response, Arafat's Palestinian Authori
ty took one of its strongest steps ever against
Hamas: it placed Yassin, the group's spiritual
leader, under house arrest.
The house arrest was a stunning move by
Arafat, who in the year since Yassin's release
from Israeli jail has bent over backward to
avoid open conflict with the Hamas leader.
Yassin. who has relatively small but
extraordinarily devout following, customarily
disavows direct knowledge of actions by
Hamas' military arm and tries to play down
any rivalry with Arafat. Earlier in the day, he
said the group did not want a bloody con
frontation with the Palestinian Authority.
The claim of responsibility came in a call to
Israel radio, and the caller hinted more vio
lence was in the offing. "It's a revolution until
victory." he said.
