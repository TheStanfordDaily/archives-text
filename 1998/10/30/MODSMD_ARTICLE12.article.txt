# Neuron growth found in adults

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have shown
for the first time that adults grow new brain
cells, even in their 60s and 70s.
lip to now. it was generally believed that
once you lost brain cells as an adult, they were
gone forever. The finding raises a distant hope
for treating brain diseases or damage by getting
the brain to fix its broken circuitry.
The new neurons were found in one small
part of the brain — the hippocampus, a deep
brain structure that's important for learning and

memory.
The discovery contradicts the traditional wis
dom that adult human brains do not make new
neurons, even though that ability had been iden
tified in rat brains some 30 years ago.
"It's not providing an answer or a cure at this
point in time for any particular disorder, but it's
a very exciting discovery," said Ira Black, head
of neuroscience and cell biology at the Robert
Wiwkl Johnson Medical School in Piscataway,
N.J.
