CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)-
John Glenn rocketed back into orbit yes
terday on a mission of science and senti
ment, returning as the world's oldest
astronaut to the high frontier he pio
neered for America 36 years ago.
"Let the wings of Discovery lift us on
to the future," said launch control in its
final words to the seven-member crew
before liftoff.
"Liftoff of Discovery with a crew of six
astronaut heroes and one American leg
end," added launch commentator Lisa
Malone.
Discovery rose majestically from its
seaside launch pad. riding the roaring
flame of its five rocket engines through a
cloudless blue sky. The craft quickly
gained speed, arced toward the east and
slowly faded from view, gaining orbit 8
and a half minutes after liftoff.
"America is very, very proud of you
today," President Clinton told NASA
engineers at the launch control center.
Glenn's journey began 19 minutes
late â€” a lot better than his first trip to
orbit in 1%2, when he had to endure 10
postponements over two months.
The countdown had proceeded flaw
lessly until about 10 minutes before the

scheduled 2 p.m. launch, when an alarm
sounded inside Discovery's cockpit, trig
gering a nine-minute delay. Shortly after
the count resumed, it had to he held again
briefly when a plane intruded into the
restricted area. NASA said later it was a
private pilot jockeying for a good view,
and an Air Force plane escorted him out
of the zone.
One small problem did occur during
liftoff. NASA said at a post-launch brief
ing. A panel that may be the door cover
ing a drag chute used during landing
jarred loose during liftoff and may have
hit one of the main engines. Officials were
studying video of the craft but said the
incident was unlikely to have any impact
on the mission or landing.
Glenn, 77, was the first American in
orbit in 1%2, on the third U.S. manned
mission. He returned to space on the
nation's 123 rd manned mission.
Clinton called it "a great day for Amer
ica and a great day for our senior citizens."
Besides the president and his wife,
Hillary, many members of Congress and
some Hollywood celebrities were on hand
at the Kennedy Space Center area for a
fleeting glimpse of history, roaring into
space.

Veteran observers said the launch fren
zy rivaled that of missions to the moon
and far exceeded most recent shuttle
nights.
