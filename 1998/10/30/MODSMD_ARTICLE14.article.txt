# New anti-cancer drug approved

WASHINGTON (AP) —In a land
mark decision, the government cleared
the powerful drug tamoxifen on Thursday
as a way for healthy women at very high
risk of breast cancer to cut their odds of
getting a tumor. The decision could affect
millions of women.
But the pills also can cause life-threat
ening side effects, so the Food and Drug
Administration demanded that doctors

carefully consider which women really
need the drug — and urged anyone con
sidering it to get all the facts first.
"For the right patient... this repre
sents a very good option," said FDA Act
ing Commissioner Michael Friedman, a
cancer specialist. "But it is not universally
beneficial and shouldn't be misused."
The FDA's action makes tamoxifen
the first medicine to win formal govern

ment approval as a way to reduce the risk
of cancer. "That makes it a monumental
decision." said Dr. Kathy Albain of Loy
ola University Medical School, an inde
pendent adviser to the FDA.
But it also will require healthy women
to weigh the pros and cons of taking a
side effect-prone drug every day for up to
five years to ward off a frightening dis
ease they may. or may not, ever get.
