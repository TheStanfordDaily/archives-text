Interest focused solely on
mainstream bands keeps
campus music life stagnant

THE DAVE MATTHEWS Band
was in town last night, and many
Stanford students went to the show
in San Jose. It was probably an entertaining
concert, and it's encouraging for those who
want to see a little more excitement in the
Stanford student body.
The fact remains, however, that most
students in attendance at the Dave
Matthews show probably won't be at the
John Lee Hooker concert on campus on
Friday night and probably will attend, at
most, one or two more concerts during the
rest of the quarter. This is a sad commen
tary on the level of musical appreciation
among some of the smartest young adults
raised in the era of MTV and in-your-face
pop culture.
1 am well aware that Stanford attracts
some of the most talented and musically lit
erate students from across the world. We
have several excellent campus bands, trios,
a cappella groups and jazz and string quar
tets. I have met people with hundreds of
recordings of innovative bands and creative
genres of music that I had never encoun
tered before. But I also know people who
happily agree when you jokingly say. "Van
Morrison was a lot better when he was in
I he Doors."
Stanford's reputation as a happy,
immaculate university where mainstream
values and tastes predominate holds true in
the musical world as well. You can hear a
lot of Dave Matthews and Counting Crows
softly emanating from Aiwa three-disc

mini-systems if you walk down hallways in
Lagunita or Stern. It appears that many stu
dents listen to certain groups just because
they are popular and have catchy lyrics like,
"If I had a million dollars!"
This trend in rock V roll appreciation is
especially disturbing considering the rich
musical environment in which we live.
Many talented bands pass through the Hay
Area, and many venues offer some form of
student discount.
While it is easy to stay on the Farm and
take the short walk over to Green, it's dif
ficult to put problem sets and midterms
aside and drive to the Warfield to see
Widespread Panic. You'd have to wait a
long time in line at the Fillmore to see the
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. But the
extra effort can yield remarkable and
unanticipated joy. I recently read an article
in a prominent psychology magazine
which cited a study that indicated people
who attend two or more theatrical or musi
cal events a week live longer and happier
lives.
Campus music life still has plenty of
untapped potential. We've asked for more
concerts at Frost Amphitheater for years,
but the last prominent show at Frost was
David Spade in May. KZSIJ could also
advertise more extensively to make stu
dents aware of their excellent programming
and easily accessible concert venues. They
should also promote on campus talent and
work with the Concert Network to bring
even more interesting bands to campus.
A good band can make any night more
enjoyable. Instead of eating a fro yo by the
Co I lo next Thursday, perhaps you should
grab a few friends and check out the Moe
show in San Francisco.
