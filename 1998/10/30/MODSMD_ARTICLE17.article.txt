## Working toward a novel goal 
### 
WHY
didn't I pick a
-1- major that
easy?" grumbled a friend
of mine as he glared across
his copy of "Physics Made
Slightly Less Painful" at
my copy of "Daniel

Deronda." i should have gone with
English. I'm tired of working."
I explained to him that there is no edition
of "Daniel Deronda, Made Slightly Less
Painful," and that I had two remaining days
to complete the original, which is 850 pages
long.
I explained to my mother that I had
abandoned my career path as the prospec
tive Secretary General of the United
Nations because I was going to write the
Great American Novel. Her other two
daughters would be senators, really they
would.
I explained to my dormmates that I
wasn't attending the Career Fair in White
Plaza because I had a poetry slam scheduled
at the same time, and I genuinely preferred
writing sonnets and eating Ramen to earn
ing lots of money and wearing a suit.
This explanation is for all of them, and
for everyone else.
I do not plan to revolutionize the com
munications industry. 1 do not plan to

restructure the American system of govern
ment. I do not plan to develop Doritos that
are crunchier than ever before. I do not plan
to change the world. Right?
1 am generally capable of laughing off my
friends' contentions that I have the easiest
life they have ever seen — that somehow,
because I'm a writer rather than a pre-med
or pre-law student. I'm unwilling to attempt
or incapable of doing "real" work. I've
laughed for three years, and I'm finally get
ting angry.
I would have a difficult time coding my
friends' CS programs. They would be just as
hard-pressed to write a well-informed liter
ary critique. 1 don't point and laugh at peo
ple who can't identify synecdoche. Should
they condescend to me because I never tcx)k
trigonometry?
My last all-nighter was 48 hours of noth
ing but poetry. Easy, right? If I had a "real"
major. I would have spent that time wrestling
with algorithms or writing a program that
would do my taxes and save my soul. Instead.
I was eulogizing a friend from high schcx)!
who committed suicide a few weeks ago.
Those hours of composition left me an emo
tional and physical wreck. I think I'm justi
fied in contending that I did "real" work.
Rest assured that I intend for this "real"
work to change the world. Writing may not
be a marketable skill in a traditional

sense — there are no corporate representa
tives jostling each other to meet me. My
resume* is no more impressive than it was
when I graduated from high school. My
study of English, however, has given my lile
added significance in a way that a degree in
chemical engineering or political science
couldn't.
Writing —my own, and Allen Gins
berg's, Sylvia Flath's, William Shakespeare's
— yanked me from a cycle of depression
that nearly left my friends to eulogize me. 1
study as I do, hammer away at my unim
pressive communication skills, because 1
want to make a difference for someone else
as my heroes have made a difference tor me.
To do so is worth more than money, and it is
worth more than fame. It is the only sort of
success I value at all.
Here I sit. "Daniel Deronda" (still) in
hand, noting that George Eliot is cooler than
I am ever likely to be and wondering if my
rampant idealism will buy me a sandwich it 1
fall short of the Great American Novel, or
the Great American Poem, as it were. I'll
probably never know, as I plan to read my
nobody-work in nobody-cafes for a very
long time. More importantly, I'll probably
never care.
