Assault happens here
Jane Camarillo's comment in the Oct.
28 Daily regarding the woman attacked on
Roble Field is outrageous: The University
does "not restrict access to our campus. It
is open to the community." Clearly
Camarillo is implying that the clean
shaven white male in his early twenties
wearing a baseball cap is not a member of
the Stanford community. I probably ran
into at least 50 Stanford students who
match this description just biking around
campus today.
( amarillo, along with much of the Stan
ford campus, is obviously in denial that
sexual assault happens in our safe Stanford
bubble and that Stanford students are the
assailants as well as the survivors.
As a self-defense instructor, I educate
members of the Stanford community on
facts about sexual assault. In case you
have not attended one of our workshops,
here are the basic stats: Three-fourths of
all women will be sexually assaulted in
their lifetime. Eighty percent of women
assaulted knew their assailants. This statis
tic is even higher for college students:
Ninety percent of college women knew
their assailants, and according to the IW3

Cowell Student Health Needs Assess
ment, 95 percent of Stanford students
knew their assailants. A final stat: One out
of three Stanford undergraduate and grad
uate women have experienced sexual
coercion: over half of these incidents were
at Stanford.
What we are talking about here is rape,
mainly date rape. Hut just because there is
"no dating" here at Stanford, that does not
mean there is not date rape at Stanford.
Most strong, independent Stanford
women would never identify a sexual
encounter without consent as rape even
though these acts meet the legal defini
tion, especially when one is unable to
legally give consent due to the intoxicating
effects of alcohol.
I urge you all to open your eyes and rec
ognize that Stanford is not a safe bubble
from the problems of the real world. Sexu
al assault is more common on college cam
puses than in the outside community. It
occurs at Stanford and at every college
campus, probably on a weekly basis. And
although there are instances of drunken
frosh engaging in nonconsensual sex at frat
parties, you cannot blame the fraternities
for every incident. Incidentally, if it was
thought the assailant was from a member
of the outside community, whv were some

fraternity members rolled out and inspect
ed for scratches by the campus police?
The best way to protect yourself from
sexual assault is to know your own sexual
boundaries and communicate them. For
the guys (the overwhelming majority of
assailants are male), realize that there is a
line line between sex and date rape, espe
cially when alcohol is involved because it
breaks down the communication.
To be on the safe side, always ask. Just
because she didn't say no does not mean
she said yes.

Prop. Five is improper
Even from a distance it is easy to see that
something is missing in the Proposition
Five debate in California. Interestingly,
while TV commercials blare the benefits
or detriments of Prop. Five, and while var
ious interests bicker about whether certain
advertising is misleading, nobody seems
willing to tell the people clearly enough
what they need to know before the elec
tion on Nov. 3.
Proposition Five is an improper use of

the initiative process in California. This is
because the initiative process itself sources
in the California constitution as a means
to effectuate laws for the people of Cali
fornia. Yet, the objectives of Prop. Five
are about something else.
Prop. Five is about people and interests
who elect not to be governed by the laws of
California. Prop. Five is about asserted fed
eral powers and federal status of Indian
tribes; it is not about state law or state pow
ers. Meaning, for example, that Prop. Five
purports to give what states cannot give: It
is an alleged state law that actually con
cedes jurisdiction and oversight of Indian
gambling in California to federal interests,
including federal courts. It is not customary
for states to give away things to entities that
are not the state or its citizens; it is also not
customary for states to accede control over
matters voted on in elections to persons
and entities that do not answer to the state.
Something is terribly wrong in Prop. Five in
these basic, fundamental ways.
Thus, Prop. Five is using state initiative
process to defeat the state and the inter
ests of state citizens, whether tribal or
non-tribal. Whether any of us from time to
time might want to "defeat" the state as to
some matter or another, the fact is, as con
stitutional matter, the state initiative pro

cess is not designed to be used to defeat
the state and its structure of government.
The people of California are not permit
ted to "defeat" themselves this way. Has
anyone mentioned that?
Imagine, for a moment, if an interest
group or an industry in and of the state of
California moved onto tribal ground in
California and proceeded to get involved
in tribal elective process (with the aid of
the federal government). Further, imagine
if this group or interest asked the people
of the tribe to divest themselves of power,
land and jurisdiction, without actually
telling the tribe, in clear and direct terms,
what was going on. And, the way this was
accomplished was by asking the people of
the tribe to vote on something that was
not explained to them adequately, so that
they did not know that they were actually
voting to give away their structure of gov
ernment. Would there be an outcry then?
Would the abuse of the "structure of gov
ernment" be clearer if the interests and
governments in Prop. Five were reversed?
Why are Californians not asking these
same sorts of questions in light of the clear
and improper purposes of Prop. Five?
