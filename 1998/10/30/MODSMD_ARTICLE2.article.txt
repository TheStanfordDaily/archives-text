## President allots $5,000 for each asst. professor 
### Elise Lipkowitz Senior staff writer 
In his annual State of the Uni
versity address. University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper announced
a five-year pilot program to offer
Presidential Research Grants to
junior faculty teaching in Earth
Sciences, Engineering and Hu
manities and Sciences, the three
schools that offer undergraduate
degrees.
"Undergraduates come to
Stanford to pursue a degree in a
research-intensive university,"
Casper said. "It is to their benefit,
as well as to the benefit of the fac
ulty. that the University strength
en research support to junior fac
ulty.".
Starting this year, every assis
tant professor will receive a
$5,000 unrestricted research
grant at the time of appointment.
The professor will receive anoth
er grant at the time of reappoint
ment. typically three years after
hiring, and if awarded tenure, an
additional $ K).(KK) research grant.
All current junior faculty in
the three schools will receive
$5,000 this year.
"The contribution will be very
helpful to faculty members, both
in their teaching and their re
search as young scholars," said
Franklin Orr. dean of the School
of Earth Sciences.
"The toughest money to raise
for any faculty member is money
where the faculty member has
discretion to use it,"he added.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Malcom Beasley echoed
Orr's sentiments.
"A few thousand dollars can do
a lot of good and I think it will be
interesting to see what young faculty
do with these funds," Beasley said.
This funding comes on the heels
of a record year of alumni donations,
during which Stanford raised
$319,410,838.18.
The primary focus of the address
was Casper's concern with the trend
toward faculty grievances and facul
ty-initiated litigation both broadly in
academia and at Stanford.
Noting that in the past year 10
faculty grievances reached the
Provost's Office in comparison to
two to three grievances annually
from 1990-95, Casper condemned
"an excessive and overreaching legal
system" and urged streamlining of
the University's procedures for deal
ing with grievances.
"Our estimate is that the handling
of a grievance that is complex and ap

pealed through the various levels will
take from 350 to more than 500 hours
of staff time," Casper said. "Attor
neys are not free, and I would remind
you that every dollar spent defending
the University against lawsuits is
taken away from much more produc
tive academic uses."
Casper also spoke of the difficult
position of the University president
in such disputes, which often origi
nate at the departmental level.
"Because the 'plea bargaining'
takes place behind closed doors, as it
must, and usually includes an agree
ment not to discuss the matter, the
president cannot even make appro
priate contributions to the articula
tion of university rules. Instead, in
terested parties spread their ver
sions of what the president did. while
the president is condemned to si
lence," Casper said.
"These days, and for the first time
in my life, I myself am mostly a client
and a victim of lawvers," said

Casper, a constitutional lawyer by
training as he captured the irony of
his position.
Although Casper said there was
little Stanford can do about an over
reaching legal system, he empha
sized that the University could re
fine its internal procedures for ad
dressing grievances to avoid leaving
grievants, respondents and the Uni
versity in a prolonged state of uncer
tainty. He announced the creation of
a task force comprised of faculty to
study grievance procedures and
offer any proposed changes to the
Faculty Senate.
"My point does not pertain to
rights, or asserting rights, but to the
manner in which wc adjudicate
them," Casper said.
While acknowledging that ten
sions are inevitable due to the hetero
geneity of the University, genera
tional differences and evolving com
munity standards, Casper stressed in
stitutional cohesion and civil it v

among the faculty. Quoting sociolo
gist Edward Shils, the president
spoke of the obligation of University
faculty to sustain the institution from
which they receive sustenance.
Both Beasley and Statistics Prof.
Brad Efron, who chairs the Faculty
Senate, stated the need to understand
the cause for rise in grievances.
Orr. although endorsing efforts
to streamline grievance procedures,
cautioned the community not to be
alarmed about the state of faculty
cohesion.
*'It is not as bad a problem as it
seems to be when we think about
grievance procedures," Orr said.
Among other highlights of the
past year, Casper mentioned the
fruition of the Stanford Introductory
Studies Program, the opening of the
Teaching Center and Sequoia 1 fall in
the Science and Engineering Quad,
the initial year of UCSF-Stanford
Health Care and the Alumni Associ
ation merger.
