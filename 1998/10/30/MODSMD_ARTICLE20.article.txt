# A 						View from the Hill
## In search of the voice for our generation 
### 
Matthew Blumenstein

THE DREAM OF becoming a writer
today is an uncommon and wild one.
Bestseller lists are aged and unim
pressive, the "classics" are stagnant, and
there is silence where youthful discussion of
literature might be. The legacy of the
engaged literary spokesman has been aban
doned.
From F. Scott Fitzgerald to Hunter S.
Thompson, from the Beat Generation to
the Me Generation, writers have always
been essential providers of cultural com
mentary and criticism. In recent years, how
ever, a poor book market and alternate out
lets in media have smothered the usual
replenishment of upcoming authors and left
us looking elsewhere for artistic reflections
of the times in which we live.
If you tell your parents you want to write
books when you graduate from Stanford,
chances are they'll panic. The prospect of
becoming a successful writer is treated with
as much optimism as a child's declaration
that he will one day be an astronaut. One
reason for this is economics. Books are not
selling well. Exceptions come in the forms
of formulaic thrillers, supermarket

romance novels and the occasional quality
work by a well-established author. Tom
Clancy, John Grisham, Stephen King, Toni
Morrison — these are our successful writ
ers. By shocking coincidence, these are also
our successful tilm writers, and so we stum
ble upon one way writers make their
money.
I here aren't many other ways. In times
past, writers would live off of book royalties
as well as proceeds from shorter efforts.
Magazines such as the Saturday Evening
Post, Esquire and H.L. Mencken's Smartset
used to nurture aspiring young authors with
empty stomachs and thoughts burning to be
told. Some magazines like this, such as
Atlantic Monthly, Harper's Bazaar and the
New Yorker, still exist. They do not pay
well. Also, they are virtually absent from
youth culture. Never in my life have I heard
two kids discussing a new short story they
had read voluntarily.
When Fitzgerald published " This Side of
Paradise," he was an instant celebrity and
cultural figurehead. Across the country peo
ple discussed his work and the world it
described so well. A modern-day equivalent

is unthinkable. Popular idols are to be
found on movie screens and music videos,
not writing novels.
An aspiring Stanford graduate hoping to
make his way writing fiction would be
thrilled to sell a story or two to the same
magazines that young people won't read. A
published book might follow, but its unlike
ly as publishers have started consulting the
"mega-bookstores" before they print new
works. If it won't sell, they won't publish it.
Concern for quality and originality becomes
secondary. If the book is finally published,
the real jackpot won't hit until it becomes a
movie. Then everyone will run to the book
stores to buy the book with the Hollywood
stars on the cover.
One possible explanation for the vanish
ing concern with literature aimed at the
young is that it has switched mediums.
Think of a profound, especially meaningful
verse of a song written in the last two years.
Think of a really cool segment of dialogue
in a recent movie. It's not hard.
There are more spokesmen for our gen
eration in hip-hop alone than in the entire
literary world put together. We've been

memorizing Beastie Boys songs for over 10
years. The sorts of things musicians sing
about — religion, urban life, drug use,
love — are the same themes about which
writers have always written. A songwriter is
certainly a poet, but why are most modern
poets songwriters?
Quentin Tarantino may well have been a
bestselling author. His screenplays are hys
terical, even on the written page, and he has
an uncanny ability to describe a cool, semi
real culture with real-world implications.
Jon Favreau's "Swingers" struck a chord
with America's youth and now the terms
"money," "beautiful babies" and "it's on"
permeate conversation.
It makes sense that the more complex
medium of movies should draw young tal
ent, as in them are several forms of expres
sion being used simultaneously. The written
word alone is, I suppose, boring in compar
ison.
The ability to describe the world in a way
to which youth can relate was the very
essence of youth literature and those who
excel at this seem to have switched profes
sions. Author Gertrude Stein named the

Lost Generation at a gas station in Europe.
If someone were to name us (I wholeheart
edly reject the title Generation X), I doubt
he or she would be a writer.
Tom Wolfe is releasing a new book for
the first time in over a decade. Book lovers
are excited, because Wolfe has been sizing
up the culture around him since the sixties
sand he has yet to disappoint. In"The Bon
fire of the Vanities," he had his go at the
greed and corruption of the 1980s. What
will he say about us in the late 19905?
It will be interesting to find out, but at
the same time, I wish we had a young voice
to complement Wolfe's. I wish we had a
voice from our own generation, like that of
Wolfe's when he explained the sixties or
that of Hunter S. Thompson used to
describe the seventies. 1 hope there will
soon come a voice intriguing enough to
draw the attention of the millions of young
Americans who have yet to learn that liter
ature concerns their lives.
