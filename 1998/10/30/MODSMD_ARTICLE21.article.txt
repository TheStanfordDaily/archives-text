# DÃ­a de los Muertos draws to a close
## 
### Valerie Crowell 
Tomorrow night, many students
will don masks, glitter and other cos
tumes to dance the night away when
the ghosts and goblins come out. But
for the last week, another group of
students has been celebrating the
dead in their own way as a part of the
Mexican holiday known as Di'a de
los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead.
As part of the week's festivities,
students gathered Tuesday night for
"Metamorphosis: Una Noche de
Pelucas, Bijotes, y Maquillaje," or "A
Night of Wigs, Mustaches and Make-
Up."
During the workshop, senior
Angel Fabian shared drag make-up
techniques. Gender-bending, of
which drag is a component, is one of
the main principles behind "Los
Viejitos," a dance performed as a
part of the celebration.

"I think what intrigues people
from the U.S. is that [death] isn't a
morbid notion [in the Mexican tradi
tion]," Fabian said. "Death was a
part of life. You celebrated life,
therefore you celebrated death."
Fabien also said that the holiday is
significant to Mexicans and Chicano
communities because it is very much
about "reclaiming lost traditions."
At Stanford, El Di'a de los Muertos is
a chance for the Mexican and Chi
cano communities to come together
in celebration of their ancestry, and
an opportunity for others to learn
about another culture.
Fabien said, "It's a pretty large
turnout, especially if it doesn't coin
cide with Halloween."
El Dia de los Muertos, whose ori
gins are significantly different from
those of Halloween, combines ele
ments of the indigenous and Catholic
traditions, reflecting the cultural mix

that characterizes the history of
Mexico. In the Catholic calendar,
Nov. 1 and 2 are All Saints' Day and
All Souls' Day, respectively. In most
of Mexico, Nov. 1 is dedicated to re
membrance of deceased infants and
children, known as arigelitos, or little
angels. On Nov. 2, those who died in
adulthood are honored.
Celebrants believe that during
the holiday, dead ancestors come
back to feast and celebrate with their
living family and friends. Partici
pants visit the cemetery, where they
build altars and leave treats, such as
food and drink, toys, flowers and cig
arettes for their ancestors to enjoy.
On Wednesday night, Stanford
students gathered at Casa Zapata to
make pan de muerto (bread of the
dead) and sugar skulls, offerings tra
ditionally left at the altars. Students
molded the sweet bread dough into
shapes, baked it, and coated it with

an orange glaze. The sugar skulls
decorated with a food dye paste, and
left out to harden.
Marisela Gonzalez, a junior ma
joring in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity, said, "This is a
typical thing to put on altars. They're
edible but mainly used for decora
tion."
Ricardo Rodriguez, an elemen
tary school student who participates
in Stanford's Barrio Assistance pro
gram, attended with senior Lindsey
Rinder to participate in the night's
baking and molding activities. "It's
fun. Sticky too," Rodriguez said.
An altar was installed last night,
and the week's festivities will culmi
nate tonight in a blessing and pro
cession from Old Union Courtyard
to Casa Zapata. A variety of artists,
including Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford and Danza Azteca , from San
Jose, will perform.
