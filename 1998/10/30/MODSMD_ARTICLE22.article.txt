UCLA Bruins (12-2. 4-0) on Satur
day. at noon, at the Rose Bowl pool.
On Sunday, the Cardinal travels to
USC to face the No. 1 Trojans (15-1.
4-0).
" This is absolutely the toughest
weekend in the regular season .that
we can have," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
Last weekend. Stanford defeated
No. 7 Pacific on Saturday, only to fall
to UCLA in a 0-4 decision on Sun
day. It was the Cardinal's second loss
to UCLA. Earlier this season. Stan
ford lost to the Bruins in an 8-7 over
time decision in the semi-finals of the
Northern California tournament.

Now that Cardinal has had two
opportunities to see what the Bruins
can do, the team is adjusting its strat
egy in preparation for this weekend.
"We know what UCLA is going
to do." Dettamanti said. "We played
better the second time. We took bet
ter shots, but they weren't going in.
So we've been workingon shot selec
tion, hitting the corners and cross
cage shots. And we've been working
on shooting quick because UCLA is
really good at field blocking."
The Stanford team has also been
working to improve its man-up of
fense.

"We're trying different combinations

I he team, which h;is been suffer

few weeks, should be back up to full

"For the first time in three weeks
everybody will be healthy."
Dettmanti said.
And the coaching staff is banking
on being able to use the entire bench,
as well as the starters, to give Stanford
an edge over the competition.
"We're going to use |sophomore)
l odd [Snider) and [freshman] Onno
|koelman| more. I'hey have a mxnl
counter attack and good speed." Det
tamanti added. "We're going to play
all 12 players against I J( I .A."
I he ( ardinal offense is lead by ju
nior Brian Heifferon. who has 33
points on the season. Close behind
arc seniors Lavne Beaubien. with 27
points and Arturo Rtxlclo, with ."'Z.
"Those three guys are scoring, but
we need other euvs to score." Delta

manti said. "Having (senior hole-set|
David Hay back at lull strength is
going to help. But right now only
three players [are averaging at least]
one goal per game. We really need
the other guys to come through and
do some scoring for us."
On defense, senior goalie Chris
Aguilera has racked up 157 saves.
The All-American goalie has been
the foundation of Stanford's defense
throughout the season.
Aguilera [lias been playing great.
I Ic's really been saving us." said Det
tamanti. "The guys are counting on
him too much sometimes. But they
have a habit of looking back to see if
he made the block and with Aguilera
in the goal, they don't have to do that.
We've been working on reacting to
the shot and beating the other team
down the pool."
II practice makes perfect. Stan
ford's efforts to prepare for this
weekend should help them turn the
tables on UCLA.
Although IJSC is the top team in
the nation, the game against UCLA
is the most critical match this week
end because it is an MPSF league
game. Stanford's record in the league

will determine its seeding in the
MPSF tournament. The team with
the best record and the team that
wins the tournament will travel to na
tionals in December. Stanford's best
chance at winning the MPSF and
making it to NCA As is to deal losses
to lICLA and USC in the remaining
league games.
"I told the guys on Monday that
we still have a great chance." Detta
manti said. "Everybody is capable of
winning or losing. There arc eight
great, solid teams (in the MPS! ]. We
only have two league games left.
Both games this weekend are impor
tant. but UCLA is slightly more (im
portant) because it's a league game."
Stanford's final league game is a
week from Saturday, when the Cardi
nal hosts USC at deGuerre ptx>l.
With the next three games pitting
Stanford against the top two teams in
the country and the regular season
winding to a close, the Cardinal can't
afford any mistakes.
"It's the last third of the season."
Dettamanti said. "It's time to start
getting healthy, start tapering and
start peaking. Now is the time to get it
going."
