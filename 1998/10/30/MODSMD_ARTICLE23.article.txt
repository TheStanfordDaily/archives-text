### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Although it is hard to call any
game do or die for a team with five
regular season matches left, the
next two-games for the Stanford
men's soccer team may be as close
as it could come.
This weekend the team travels
across the bay for the Cal-Adidas
Classic, in which it will play No. 10
St. Johns (9-3-3) tomorrow and
Rider (10-6) on Sunday at IJC-
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium. Al
though not Mountain Pacific-
Sports Federation matches. No. 11
Stanford (11-4. 4-2 MPSF) is fully
aware of the importance of the
weekend.

"This would he a tremendous
weekend to come up with double
victories." said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. "All I ask at
this point in the season is to be in
contention. That gives you some
thing to plav for. It is in our own
hands and that is exciting."
The team was in contention at
this time last season, but it was at
this very tournament that Stan
ford's season took a nose dive.
"At this time last year our sea
son came apart. People remember
these things and we don't want to
let that happen again." said senior
defender Jamie Clark.
Currently, the Cardinal is look
ing to regain its winning ways after
a 1-0 loss last Sunday to Cal Polv-

San Luis Obispo. While the Cardi
nal dominated the game, outshoot
ing the Mustangs 15-4, Cal Poly
scored on a penalty kick for the
game's only goal. And though satis
fied with its play, the Cardinal real
izes it needs to turn its solid perfor
mances into victories and is hungry
to do so.
"Everyone is itching to get back
out there," said senior captain A.J.
Sauer. " The loss puts everything
back in perspective and we will try
to turn it into a step forward. We
need the feeling of rolling off some
wins."
Sophomore forward Corey
Wool folk elaborated on Sauer's
sentiments.
"Last weekend was an eye
opener.'" he said. "We were sailing
for a little, but the loss shifted our
focus. We now realize that the tour
nament isn't automatic and our
goal has to be getting into the tour
nament."
Victories this weekend would

put the team hack on the right track
and also keep it in contention for a
post-season berth. The Cardinal
can not afford many more losses if
it hopes for a place in the tourna
ment.
"We can't afford to lose more
than one more game an expect to
make the tournament," Jamie
Clark said.
"We need to start a streak be
fore the tournament and get some
momentum," he added.
But the St. John's Red Storm
will not make it easy for the Cardi
nal.
The 1996 NCAA champions,
the Red Storm is having yet anoth
er strong season, led by senior mid
fielder Stefani Miglioranzi.

dem of Simon Elliot and Shan
Ga\v, who are both having ex
tremely strong seasons, will be
