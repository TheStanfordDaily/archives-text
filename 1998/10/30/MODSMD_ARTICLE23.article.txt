## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Although it is hard to call any
game do or die for a team with five
regular season matches left, the
next two-games for the Stanford
men's soccer team may be as close
as it could come.
This weekend the team travels
across the bay for the Cal-Adidas
Classic, in which it will play No. 10
St. Johns (9-3-3) tomorrow and
Rider (10-6) on Sunday at IJC-
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium. Al
though not Mountain Pacific-
Sports Federation matches. No. 11
Stanford (11-4. 4-2 MPSF) is fully
aware of the importance of the
weekend.

"This would he a tremendous
weekend to come up with double
victories." said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. "All I ask at
this point in the season is to be in
contention. That gives you some
thing to plav for. It is in our own
hands and that is exciting."
The team was in contention at
this time last season, but it was at
this very tournament that Stan
ford's season took a nose dive.
"At this time last year our sea
son came apart. People remember
these things and we don't want to
let that happen again." said senior
defender Jamie Clark.
Currently, the Cardinal is look
ing to regain its winning ways after
a 1-0 loss last Sunday to Cal Polv-

San Luis Obispo. While the Cardi
nal dominated the game, outshoot
ing the Mustangs 15-4, Cal Poly
scored on a penalty kick for the
game's only goal. And though satis
fied with its play, the Cardinal real
izes it needs to turn its solid perfor
mances into victories and is hungry
to do so.
"Everyone is itching to get back
out there," said senior captain A.J.
Sauer. " The loss puts everything
back in perspective and we will try
to turn it into a step forward. We
need the feeling of rolling off some
wins."
Sophomore forward Corey
Wool folk elaborated on Sauer's
sentiments.
"Last weekend was an eye
opener.'" he said. "We were sailing
for a little, but the loss shifted our
focus. We now realize that the tour
nament isn't automatic and our
goal has to be getting into the tour
nament."
Victories this weekend would

put the team hack on the right track
and also keep it in contention for a
post-season berth. The Cardinal
can not afford many more losses if
it hopes for a place in the tourna
ment.
"We can't afford to lose more
than one more game an expect to
make the tournament," Jamie
Clark said.
"We need to start a streak be
fore the tournament and get some
momentum," he added.

will not make it easy for the Cardi

the Red Storm is having yet anoth

nior forward Pablo Budna leads St.
John's with eight goals and 20
points.
Several players on St. John's
have had their share of success with
a national championship, but the
Cardinal has refused to shy away
from any opponent this season.
"Several players on their team
have tasted success and want to re
peat that success," Bobby Clark

said. "But our team doesn't fear
anyone."
This confidence is echoed by his
players.
"We have the attitude that if you
send anyone at us, we can give
them a game," Woolfolk said.
While tomorrow's challenge is
expected to he the tougher of the
two, Sunday's game against Rider
is also critical.
The Broncos are riding a live
game winning streak and senior
forward Craig Wieken is ranked
eighth in the country with 16 goals
and 39 points.

Looking to stop this potent of
fense is Stanford's defense, which
is currently ranked second in the
country. While the Cardinal hasn't
been scoring many goals lately, the
defense has held off the opponents.
Goalie Adam Zapala has recorded
10 shutouts in his 15 games, and
boasts a .59 goals-against average.
The defense, however, does not
just consist of Zapala and his four
defenders.
"Our whole team contributes to
the defense," Bobby Clark said.
" The defense starts with the strik
ers and everyone plays their part.

()ur style gets everyone involved."
This defense, however, will have
to undergo a face lift for the rest of
the season.
With the loss of sophomore
midfielder Sean Sylvis to a broken
leg, suffered last weekend,
Bobby Clark plans to move ju
nior Gerard Davis from defense up
to the midfield in Sylvis' place.
Freshman defender Lee Morrison
will slide from the center to the
flank and redshirt sophomore
Chris Gores will slot into the center
of the backfield alone side Jamie
Clark.
