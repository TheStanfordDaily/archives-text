Rally the troops, because championship
time is here again.
Tomorrow's Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship meet in Eugene, Ore. will he the
first in a series of post-season challenges for
the Stanford cross country team in its quest
for a third-straight national championship.
Winning the previous two conference
championships appeared to be almost effort
less for the Cardinal, but this year Stanford
will have to defend its top ranking against
No. 3 Oregon and No. 5 Arizona.
Start lists are yet to be released, but head
coach Vin Lananna previously stated that the
Pac-10 meet would mark the first time in the

season that he would run a complete squad.
That probably means that senior All
Americans Brad and Brent Mauser, who
placed fourth and 12th at last year's meet, re
spectively. will lead the Stanford charge.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY

â–  Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford will compete in
the Pacific 10 Championships at Alton Baker
Park. Eugene. Ore.
Sophomore Jonathan Riley, who placed
eighth in last year's meet and has raced only
once this season, is also expected to run.
Other likely starters include seniors Jason
Balkman and Jon Weldon and sophomores
Thomas Murley and Ciabe Jennings.
Set to be contested at Eugene's Alton

Baker Park, the meet marks the first time in
25 years that the conference championship
will be held outside of ('alilornia and the first
time in 15 years that Stanford has not played
host.
Though the Pac-10 meet will not have di
rect NCAA implications for the Cardinal,
there is a lot of pride on the line.
Competing on the Stanford golf course
last year, the Cardinal harriers outdistanced
the Ducks of Oregon by scoring a mere 33
points, compared to the No from the ()regon
Ducks.
This year's course, which tours eight kilo
meters of mulch and grass trails, is purported
to be extremely fast.
This should play right into the hands of
the Stanford men. whose proven track speed

will be a great asset.
I lowever. the strength and volatility of the
Pac-ll) will ensure that the C Cardinal will have
to work to come out on top.
I he Duck squad, skippered by legendary
coach Bill Dellinger in his final season, lias
already shown that it can contend with Stan
ford on the trails. Oregon placed second in
the Oct. 10 pre-nationals in Lawrence, Kan.,
scoring 103 points as compared to the Car di
nars 80.
Operating with the help of junior transfer
Steve Fein, a former Wisconsin star, the tra
ditional distance powerhouse will look to se
nior All-American Matthew Davis to set the
pace for the Ducks.
