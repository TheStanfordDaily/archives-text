### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Rally the troops, because championship
time is here again.
Tomorrow's Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship meet in Eugene, Ore. will he the
first in a series of post-season challenges for
the Stanford cross country team in its quest
for a third-straight national championship.
Winning the previous two conference
championships appeared to be almost effort
less for the Cardinal, but this year Stanford
will have to defend its top ranking against
No. 3 Oregon and No. 5 Arizona.
Start lists are yet to be released, but head
coach Vin Lananna previously stated that the
Pac-10 meet would mark the first time in the

season that he would run a complete squad.
That probably means that senior All
Americans Brad and Brent Mauser, who
placed fourth and 12th at last year's meet, re
spectively. will lead the Stanford charge.
