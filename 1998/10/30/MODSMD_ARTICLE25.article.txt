# Could be trouble Bruin
## Football to face No. 2 UCLA in Pasadena 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
One might say that today's trip
to Los Angeles to take on No. 2
UCLA couldn't come at a worse
time for a struggling Stanford loot
hall team. ()ne might also make the
case that there is no good time to
take on this year's unbelievable
UCLA team during Stanford's 1-6
season.

FOOTBALL

■ Tomorrow; Stanford (1-6 overall.
0-4 Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 2
UCLA (6-0.4-0) 3:30 p.m.. RADIO:
KZSIJ (90.1 FM). KTCT (1050
AM). TV: F/X Network Live.
"I don't know that we can [slop
UCLA]." said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "I don't know that

anyone lias. Maybe if we're lucky
they'll all get sick before the
game."
It would take an outbreak of the
plague to reduce this made-to
order rout to even money. The
heavily favored Bruins have won a
school-record 16 straight games,
and have averaged 43.5 points per
game in its domination of the Pacif
ic 10 Conference this year.
Leading the UCLA charge is
Hcisnian-candidate quarterback
Cade McNown, who in his senior
year, has already shattered school
records for career completions,
passing yards, touchdowns and
total offense. Add to McNown the
running of sophomore tailback Jer
maine Lewis and Danny Farmer's
deep threat capability at the wide
out position, and you have one of
the most talented skill position sets

in Division-I football.
"This is a great football team
and the opportunity to just line up
and play them is exciting,"' Willing
ham said. "We just have to bring up
our level of play. We need to put a
complete game together."
Unfortunately, Stanford will
have to put that complete game to
gether without a complete team.
I lie ('ardinal backfield has been
decimated by injuries to starters
Coy Wire and Maxwell Stevenson,
and to backup fullback Byron
(ilaspic. While Cilaspie is likely to
return against UCLA. Wire and
Stevenson arc questionable for the
rest of the season. Further compli
cating matters is the hand injury to
Wire's backup. Juan-Carlos Lacey,
who is also dav-to-dav. The short
age of hacks has forced Stanford to
use an unusually high number of
one-back formations. In the sec
ondary, freshman cornerback
Brian Taylor may return from his
hand injury to platoon with Ruben
Carter, who gave a good account of
himself and even picked off a first
quarter Chad Elliott pass at Ari
zona State before getting smoked
for the game-winning score in
overtime.
One positive the Cardinal can
take from the loss at ASIJ is the
success Willingham and offensive
coordinator Hill Diedrick had ro
tating starting quarterback Todd
Husak with sophomore backups
Randy Fasani and Joe Borchard.
Against the Sun Devils, I lusak and
Borchard threw two touchdown
passes apiece, while Fasani caught
a pass for 32 yards.
"I think our three quarterbacks
provided good leadership," Will
ingham said. "Any quarterback
wants to get ;ill the snaps, of course.
I think you'd want that from any

player on your team. We're just try
ing to utilize their different skills."
Switching things up might he the
only chance Stanford has against
UCLA's defense, which has speed
to burn and a penchant for the ball.
The Bruins have enjoyed a plus
1.67 turnover ratio per game,
thanks to McNown's precision and
the defense's heavy hitters.
"You don't want to give away
your game plan before you even
show up to play the game, but we'll
try to exploit their weakness,"
Willingham said. "Just use your
imagination."
Willi six losses, a bowl bid and
winning record is impossible lor
the Cardinal, but Willingham in
sists there are still goals to be met
for the remainder of the season. Se
niors Jeff Allen, Doug Brown,
Brian Donoghue, Andrew Kroek
er. Kevin Miller and Cieoff Wilson
will be graduating this year and
there's still time to salvage their
final season.
"I think it's important we send
our seniors out well. There are a lot
of things you can point to. What we
need to do is just be consistent,."
Willingham said.

winner in quarterback Cade McNown, as the Cardinal travels to UCLA.
