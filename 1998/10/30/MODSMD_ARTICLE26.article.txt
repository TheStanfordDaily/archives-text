# Stanford looks for third consecutive title at Pac-10s
## 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
Head coach Vin Lananna
doesn't expect any surprises for his
No. 2 women's cross country team
this Halloween.
At Alton Baker Park, at the
University of Oregon, his team will
suit up in its Cardinal costumes
with the aim of bringing home
prized loot, its third straight Pacific
10 Championship title.
While this is the first year that
the Pac-l()s will he held outside of
California, their will be no shift in
the level of competition. Standing
in the Cardinal's way will be a
small, but competitive nine-team
field including No. 6 Arizona, No.
12 Washington, No. 15 Arizona
State, No. lb Oregon and No. 23
UCLA.
The size and quality of the field
don't concern Lananna.
"I think that we will do well in
this kind of setting and environ
ment," Lananna said. "Our women
are well prepared for whatever is
thrown at them, whether it's a field
of 63 runners or 363. I don't think

the size of the field has any effect
whatsoever.
"I think that our women will run
well. They're prepared to run well.
We have with us some momentum
coming off the pre-nationals and
we've been relatively healthy."

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

â–  Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford will
compete in the Pacific 10 Champi
onships at Alton Baker Park, Eu
gene, Ore.
The Cardinal lineup will most
likely include all five of its top fin
ishers from Oct. lOth's pre-nation
al meet which the women won. In
that meet, sophomore Julia
Stamps, junior Sally Glynn, fresh
men Caroline Annis and Malindi
Elmore and senior captain Mary
Cobb helped the Cardinal total less
than half of the points of its nearest
opponent, Arizona. The sixth and
seventh spots on the Cardinal
squad will be rounded out from a
pool which includes Courtney
Adams, Mary Huang, Elena Vil
lareal. Alyssa Pagon and Colleen

Flaherty.
Assistant coach Beth Alford-
Sullivan is happy to be in a situa
tion where she has depth at the bot
tom of her lineup.
"If there is somebody that needs
a weekend off or there is someone
challenging for a back spot, then
that gives us the flexibility to switch
up the lineup." Sullivan said.
"We'll travel nine this weekend
and we'll run seven," Sullivan
added. "We want to provide the ex
perience at a championship level
for the kids who travel as alter
nates."
If the Cardinal women run as
they have all season, the real race
will be for the top individual spots.
The top six finishers from last
year's race will all be on the line to
morrow including three-time
champion Amy Skieresz from Ari
zona. Skieresz has been phenome
nal all season long and seems to
have helped freshmen teammate
Tara Chaplin blossom into another
outstanding Arizona harrier.
Chaplin was second, only to
Skieresz, at the pre-nationals in
Lawrence, Kan.

The crowd favorite will without
a doubt be Oregon's Marie Davis,
who last year edged out Stanford's
Stamps for second place. Their ri
valry was furthered this year when
Stamps returned the favor, edging
Davis by one second at Lawrence.
All five of the Cardinal's top
runners have legitimate shots at
finishing in the top 10 Cobb and
Glynn both look to improve on
their finishes last year, fourth and
fifth respectively.
Priscilla Hein, the lone upper
classman in Arizona State's lineup,
along with Sophomores Jennifer
Smith and Kara Syrdal of Washing
ton will also fight for top ten hon
ors. Other possible contenders in
clude twin sisters Elissa and Lori
Riedy of California along with
Megan Maynard of Washington
State.
All of this competition, com
bined with the fact that the NCAA
West Regional Championships
aren't for another two weeks,
should provide for a fast race in
which there is no holding back.
The meet will begin, tomorrow,
at 11:00 a.m.


All eyes will be on sophomore sensation Julia Stamps as the No. 2
Cardinal competes at the Pac-10 Championships in Eugene, Ore.
