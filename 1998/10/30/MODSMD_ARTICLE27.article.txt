### Will Hemming Staff writer 
Barely removed Irom his play
ers' first set of midterms and more
than a month away from the start of
the NCAA Tournament. Stanford
women's coach Don Shaw recog
nizes that he and his players are
right in the middle of the slowest
part of the year.
After yesterday's practice. Shaw
went so far as to call these last cou
ple weeks of ()ctober "the dog days
of the season."

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Tonight: No. 5 Stanford (17-2 over
all, 11-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at
Washington (5-9,4-6), 7 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at Washington
State (8-8, 5-5), I p.m.
I here is so much good news sur
rounding the team right now, how
ever. that if these are the dog days,
the good ones should be some
thing.
Not only does No. 5 Stanford
(17-2 overall. 11-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) hit the road to Washing
ton rolling with a two-match con
ference lead. Shaw will shoot for
his 400th career victory tonight
against the I luskies (5-9, 4-0).
"It is a milestone ol longevity,"
said Shaw, who boasts the highest
winning percentage in NCAA
women's volleyball history. "I have
been very fortunate to he here at
Stanford mv whole career. You

couldn't ask for a better place to
work. I have been surrounded by
great players and coaches through
out my career."
One of those coaches, assistant
head coach Denise Corlett, has
been with Shaw for lOof his 14 sea
sons and played a big part in turn
ing the Stanford program into such
a national powerhouse.
"Denise deserves as much cred
it as anyone," Shaw said of his long
time and assistant. "She has been
with me for 10 years now and done
a wonderful job with the team."
Shaw did not get his first 399
wins by looking past any oppo
nents. so he and his Cardinal team
will be ready to face the Huskies
tonight.
"We know Washington will be
better prepared to play us than last
time at Maples," said Shaw, refer
ring to his team's three-game
sweep of the Huskies at Maples
Pavilion.
"Road matches in the Pac-10 are
very difficult," Shaw added.
"Maples can be a very intimidating
place for other teams to come play,
with our record there and the ban
ners and the whole atmosphere. So
when they get us in their place, they
are really looking for revenge,"
Stanford will get a big-time
boost from Jaimi (iregory, who re
turns tonight from knee surgery
that has kept her sidelined for the
past seven matches. Phe junior out
side hitter stabilizes the Cardinal
defense and will bring invaluable
veteran experience to the floor.

"It will be great to have Jaimi
back out there," Shaw said. " The
defensive presence, ball control
and enthusiasm she brings out
there are all things we can use at
this point."
On Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m.,
Stanford will face Washington
State (K-K,5-5), a team that is much
weaker after the loss of star outside
hitter Jennifer Stinson, the team's
senior leader, to an ankle injury.
"Stinson is obviously a big loss
for them," Shaw said. "But they
didn't play that badly without her
last weekend against Washington.
This is the type of thing that could
be a rallying point for them, and
some of their younger players
could step up in her absence."
One of those younger players is
freshman Kristen Johnson, who re
sponded to Stinson's absence with
17 kills and 11 digs in the Cougar's
heartbreaking five-game loss to
Washington last Friday.
While the Cougars look for of
fensive answers, Stanford is more
than happv with its current produc
tion from younger players, as the
Cardinal freshmen are quickly
learning the system and putting up
big numbers.
And it is safe to say that the
older players are doing their jobs as
well.
Junior outside hitter Kerri
Walsh was named Pac-1() Player of
the Week, after leading the Cardi
nal to three victories last week, hit
ling withkills.4sdigs, I S;is
sisls mikl I I blocks.
I ;isi week was the second time
\V;ilsh Ikis received the honor tins
season, and the tilth in her career.
Walsh joins former Stanford
stai Uev ()den as the only player to
receive the honor live limes. Only
three players remain above Walsh

on the career total list, and she
needs three more to tie for the all
lime lead.
Shaw applauds Walsh's perfor
mance. but. true to form, is focused
on the tough road trip ahead.
" The second half of the season
is always tougher." Shaw said.
"We are nearing the stretch run.
and just need to take it one day at a
time. If we do that, we have a great
chance to win the conference." he
added.
