■ Today: Stanford (7-6-2 overall.
1-4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at
Washington State (5-8-3. 3-2-1), 2
p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford at Washington
(9-6-1,5-1), Noon.
Despite beginning the season
with an impressive 6-1-2 record,
Stanford has dropped five of its
last six games. Stanford's strong
start, however, against its oppo
nents indicates the caliber of play
of which this team is capable.
The Cardinal has suffered from
an inability to finish off its oppo
nents. especially during the critical
overtime period. Four of the Car
dinal's games this year have en
tered overtime play, however.
Stanford has been unable to attain
a victory in any of these games.
"We can't give up." said senior

midfielder Traeye Lawyer. "We
have been having a lot of bad luck
and losing a lot of close games. We
need to push hard through the end
of the season."
The Cardinal, however, has
only four games remaining on the
regular season schedule to change
its current dismal playing streak,
beginning with two in the state of
Washington.
"We want to come back with
two wins." Lawyer said.
The Cardinal return to Pac-10
competition this afternoon against
the Washington State Cougars (5-
8-3,3-2-1).
The Cougars are returning to
the field after a tough road trip to
the Arizona schools last weekend.
Washington State dropped a 2-1
decision to Arizona State before
playing to a 0-0 double-overtime
draw against Arizona.
Washington State has also had
its share of problems with the Car
dinal. Stanford dominates the se
ries between the two schools. The
Cardinal has a 6-1-0 record against
the Cougars Last year, it defeated
them. 1-0.
After today's game against
Washington State. Stanford faces
a more formidable opponent on
Sunday when the team battles the
Washington Huskies (9-6-1.5-1).
Washington has repeatedly

stepped up its level of play with
(he start of Pac-1() games and this
season is no exception. The
Huskies continue their quest to
obtain an at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament for the third
time in four seasons.
Stanford received an automatic
entry to the tournament in both
1995 and 1996.
Although the Cardinal remains
undefeated in eight games against
Washington, this year the Huskies
have dominated Pac-1() play. They
have won their last five games and
have a 7-1-1 record in the last nine
games.
Stanford will aim to shut down
the scoring capabilities of Wash
ington sophomore forward Tami
Bennett. Bennett was voted the
conference's player of the weekon
Monday lor the second time this
season. The sophomore has been a
consistent offensive threat
throughout the season and has ac
cumulated nine goals and one as
sist. In addition to these accolades,
Bennett tallied the game-clinching
goal last weekend during the
Huskies' overtime victory against
Arizona.
If the Cardinal is to achieve its
goal of returning from its final
road trip with two wins, it will need
to step up its aggressive play, espe
cially early on in each game.
