# Alumnus offers $5,000 reward for Tree
## Two mascots may take their rivalry to the realm of zambonis 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Oski may not be confronting the
Tree in this year's Big Game, but if
Tim Harrington has his way. the rival
mascots will race zambonis clown the
streets of San Francisco Nov. 11.
Harrington, a Stanford Business
School graduate and C EO of Sport-
Site.com. proposed a Big (lame
Zamboni race between Oski and the
Tree to reduce tensions between IJC
Berkeley and Stanford stemming
from the theft of the Tree costume.
Harrington's company ;ilso of
fered a $S.(XK) reward for the safe re

turn of the Tree.
"In the interest of good sports
manship â€” and the welfare of trees
everywhere - we want to help free
the Tree," 1 farrington said.
The reward would not benefit the
Tree's captors, the self-proclaimed
"Phoenix Five." a group of students
at IJ(-Berkeley. Upon return of the
Tree, the $.\(XH) reward would be
paid to The Guardsmen's annual
Christmas I ree Drive, which raises
funds to send disadvantaged May
Area children to summer camp.
"We live sports and love competi
tion," I farrington said, "and we sup
port the Big (iame rivalry as much as

anyone, but this has gone too far."
Stanford free Chris Henderson
supports the idea of a reward and is
excited about the prospect of a zam
boni challenge.
"I am definitely up for it." Hen
derson said. "I have always dreamt of
driving a zamboni down the streets of
San Francisco. I am willing to take on
()ski in any arena."
It is unclear who would provide
the zamboni lor the Big (iame chal
lenge. Harrington's company boasts
that it sells "everything in sporting
gear from A to Zamboni," and does
indeed offer zambonis for $9,950.
Tax, duty and freight are extra.
