SEXUAL FEELINGS
Curious about your sexual
fantasies, attractions, and
behavior? Interested in intimacy?
We all are. being sexually attracted
to another person is an exciting
experience that can be sensual,
physical and/or emotional. It
embodies a wide range of feelings
including affection, tenderness,
love, pride, possessiveness, jeal
ousy and fear.
Attitude
Our attitude toward sex is often
influenced bv messages we
received growing up. Consider:
■ Mow adults expressed emo
tional and physical affection
around you
■ The way adults differed in their
sexual behavior based on their
gender
■ What early messages you
received about sex (verbal
and non-verbal)
■ The position of your religion
and attitude of your culture
toward sex
Differences
lust as we all had different
experiences growing up, we also
approach sexuality differently.
Preferences for how, when, and
with whom we want to be sexual
vary, as does what turns us on
and turns us off. So does our
level of desire: some people are
easily aroused and would like to
have sex more; others less. People
also attribute different meanings
to sexual thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors, and what we consider
"normal" varies significantly.
Sexual Fantasy
Fantasy is a common, normal
psychological process. It also
serves a purpose: it enables us to
Hi
. ■* *j
Have you been contemplating a
romantic walk in the hills?
Stanford students have done so
for over a century.
explore things internally that we
may decide not to act upon.
Sexual fantasies:
■ Are a means of exploration
■ Help us escape from the
frustrations of daily life
■ Fnable us to rehearse situ
ations, and so can boost our
self-confidence
■ Are useful in solitary situations
■ Can enhance an intimate
relationship
Recognize that your fantasies
may cause you some discomfort.
They may conflict with esta
blished values, seem outlandish
or exaggerated when viewed
rationally, or they may represent
just one part of yourself (but one
that is important not to ignore).
When Sex Isn't
Rewarding
At one time or another (and
sometimes often), you may have
difficulty enjoying yourself in an
intimate sexual relationship.
This can occur for a variety of
reasons, such as:
■ Having difficulty feeling
good about yourself or your
partner
■ Being troubled bv the
circumstances of the sexual
experience
■ Drugs and alcohol: they can
have side effects that affect
your sexual interest or
performance
■ Sex can be painful (if you
have physical discomfort
during sex, consult a
physician)
Common Concerns
If any of the following issues are
on your mind, a therapist at
CAPS is available to discuss
them with you.
■ Confusion about your sexu
ality, and/or sexual attractions
■ Sexual thoughts that trouble
you or make you feel
ashamed
■ Having sex with someone
though you didn't want to
■ Being attracted to people
who hurt you, or to people
you don't like
■ Feeling a need to consume
drugs or alcohol before
having sex
■ Concern that your sexual
behavior is different from
others of your age or gender
■ Feeling uncomfortable
talking about your sexuality
when you would like to
■ Having difficulty setting
limits when you have sex
■ Feeling like you're not really
there when you have sex
■ Troubled by unpleasant
sexual experiences in the past
