Stanford Skin Picking Study
Are you Preoccupied With Imperfections in Your Skin?
Do you pick at your skin and create blemishes, only to feel regretful, depressed or anxious later?
If skin picking is a serious problem for you, you may be eligible to receive FREE treatment with medication at Stanford University.
The Department of Psychiatry is conducting a research study designed to reduce skin picking and allow for skin healing.
