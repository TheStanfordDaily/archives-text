## No. 2 UCLA holds off Cardinal 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Entering Saturday's Stanford-UCLA game, the Bru
ins' (7-0, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) season had been sto
rybook; the Cardinal. Brothers Grimm.
That's what made Stanford's (1-7, 0-5) upset such a
compelling story, a David-and-Goliath type tale that
would redeem the struggling Cardinal's disastrous season
— until the Big Bad Bruins stomped all over a Stanford
10-point lead and ruined the plotline. Instead, the Titan
ic sank and Stanford headed home with another stinging
loss.
"We played a very good team," head coach Tyrone
Willingham said. "But coaches aren't interested in moral
victories."
Though no Stanford coaches or players admitted it
after the game, holding UCLA to 28 points and knocking
them out of second place in the national coaches' poll
could be considered a victory of sorts. Favored by 28 and
a half points, the No. 2 Bruins overlooked the scrappy
Cardinal squad for three quarters before playing like the
powerhouse they are.
"They are a very good football team, but maybe they
had their sights set somewhere else." Willingham said.
Defensive coordinator Bill Harris voiced similar sen
timents.
"They are the best-ranked team in the country," Har
ris said. "There's no doubt. [UCLA senior quarterback
Cade McNown) threw two interceptions on the same
drive — now how often is he going to throw two inter-

ceptions on the same drive? You
know there's something not right.
We played good, but they also played
bad."
Stanford's previously disastrous
defense stood up right from the start,
setting up a Stanford drive that ended
in junior tailback Juan-Carlos
Lacey's one-yard touchdown on an
option pitch left.
The Bruins quickly tied the game,
capitalizing on the latest Cardinal
special teams catastrophe. This time,
Kevin Miller's punt was blocked and
recovered by Bruin free safety Tod
Mcßride at Stanford's 33. On the
very next play, UCLA tailback Keith
Brown sprinted to the sideline and
just outran everyone in red for his
fifth touchdown of the year.
"You don't talk about lack of
speed [on our part)," Harris said. "If
thev were slow, vou could talk about

lack of speed. Those suckers are
fast."
The Cardinal caught a break
when a McNown touchdown pass
was called back for holding and it
then held the Bruins to a missed field
goal attempt. On its next drive, Stan
ford senior outside linebacker Don
nie Spragan swooped out of lazy zone
coverage to pick off McNown's offer
ing. but committed the cardinal sin of
failing to protect his newfound prize
and fumbled the ball back to
UCLA's Rvan Neufeld.

Fortunately, McNown took just
three plays to switch targets to red
shirt junior safety Tim Smith, who
made a fantastic leaping catch to
squelch the Bruin drive for good.
Junior quarterback Todd Husak
then engineered a go-ahead touch

down drive, the lion's share coming
when wideout Deßonnie Pitts
burned his man on a quick out and
then broke a tackle to rumble for 35
yards. From UCLA's 23, Husak hit
sophomore Dave Davis on a deep
slant for a touchdown.
It took just four plays for the
downtrodden Stanford defense to
diddle themselves to the tune of a 53-
yard touchdown pass to UCLA's
Brian Poli-Dixon.
"The defense played well," Harris
said. "They played 72 plays, four of
them bad. Just four big plays. You
can't complain about that."
Stanford started the second half
with the ball, and Kevin Miller gave
them an improbable 17-14 lead on a
36-yard field goal. Davis snuffed
UCLA's bid to tie on the next posses
sion with a swat of Chris Sailer's 50-
yard field goal attempt, setting up
redshirt freshman quarterback
Randy Fasani's three-yard touch
down lob to tight end Russell Stew
art. Miller's extra point gave the Car

dinal a 10-point lead entering the
fourth quarter, causing stirs on
teleprompters and score tickers
everywhere.
And then, the levee broke.
Perhaps awakened by the sudden
two-possession deficit, UCLA
scored touchdowns on both of its
next two drives, setting the score at
28-24 in favor of the Bruins.
Tragedy then struck the Cardinal,
as Husak corralled an impossible
drive to go ahead. Converting third
downs of seven, 19 and six yards,
Stanford made it to the UCLA 34 in
thrilling fashion, overcoming a sack
and two penalties in the process.
Husak hit senior backup Hanker
Jeff Allen on an in-and-up at the
UCLA five. Allen had slipped
through a seam in the UCLA zone,
and Husak found the envelope to
perfection. Allen reached up for it,
tucked the ball away, turned, saw the
promised land — and was stripped by
Bruin cornerback Marques Ander
son at the one-yard line.
