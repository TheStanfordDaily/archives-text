## Iraq refuses cooperation with U.N. 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq sent a defiant mes
sage to the United Nations on Sunday, declaring it will
not renew cooperation with U.N. weapons inspec
tors — even if threatened with military action — unless
the Security Council begins moving to lift devastating
trade sanctions.
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said "there
will be no cooperation before Iraq's demands are met."
*Not even a threat of force would make Baghdad back
down, he said.
* The statements were the first Iraqi response to the
y'U.N. Security Council's condemnation of Baghdad's
. decision Saturday to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country.
In Washington, National Security Council
I spokesman David Leavy called the Iraqi action "a seri
ous threat to the international community." He said
'President Clinton's national security advisers were

reviewing the situation and "all options remain on the
table."
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who canceled a
weeklong Asian tour to return to Washington for strat
egy discussions, said the United States prefers to act
with its allies to resolve the latest standoff with Iraq, but
retains the option of unilateral military action.
Earlier this year, the United States rushed warplanes
to the Persian Gull and threatened military strikes
against Iraq il Baghdad retused to fully cooperate with
the weapons inspectors. I hat crisis was defused when
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled to Bagh
dad in February and secured an Iraqi pledge of cooper
ation.
On Sunday, Ramadan told reporters in Baghdad
that "Iraq does not fear the threat of the United States
because it has been threatening Iraq for the past eight
years."
