# Arafat warned of 'fires of revenge' after crackdown
## Hamas threatens mideast peace 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) —The mil
itary arm of the radical Islamic
group Hamas made an unprece
dented threat Sunday against Yass
er Arafat, demanding that the
Palestinian leader halt a crackdown
against it or face violent vengeance.
The threat, in a leaflet faxed to
news organizations, cast a pall over
this week's efforts to begin imple
menting the Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement, but as of Sunday,
both sides still were pledging to
move ahead as scheduled.
In recent days. Arafat's security
forces have rounded up more than

1(H) Hamas activists, detained some
of its top political leaders and put its
ailing, charismatic founder. Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest.
That crackdown—and the
Hamas demand to halt it — marked
a spectacular smashup of the
uneasy peace that had prevailed
between Arafat and Hamas over
the past 14 months, ever since
Yassin was released from Israeli
prison and returned to his faithful
following in the Gaza Strip.
Until now, in deference to
Arafat's role as a symbol of Pales
tinian unity. Hamas had stopped

short of direct threats against him.
Hut the leaflet — signed by Hamas'
Izzedine al Qassam brigades —
accused the Palestinian leader of
having "reached the point of trea
son" by moving against Hamas.
It called for an immediate end to
the crackdown to spare Palestinians
"the horrors... of civil war" and
Arafat's camp the "fires of
revenge."
Palestinian security officials took
the warnings seriously. Police com
mander Gha/i Jabali said, "We are
going to take all measures to con
trol the situation."
