## Editorial Vote for Gray Davis 
### 
Lt. Governor's views on
education, environment and
social policy work lor state

IN THE CALIFORNIA gubernatorial
race, our choice is clear. Democrat
(iray Davis, the mild-mannered lieu
tenant governor, is the best candidate to
lead the world's eighth largest economy
into the next millennium. At the same time,
many positions of his Republican oppo
nent. Attorney General Dan Lungren, are
far to the right of ours and of this state.
Years of experience at the highest levels
of California government have prepared
Davis to take the helm. Prior to his term as
lieutenant governor, he served as chief of
stall to Gov. Jerry Brown, as a member of
the assembly and as state controller. Davis
emerged with an intricate knowledge of
California politics and a widely acknowl
edged reputation for coalition-building.
Not surprisingly, education is a key issue
in this election and our primary concern.
Davis is proposing a series of important
measures to strengthen the role of the state
in improving California's public schools. In
addition to an increase in the state's per
student spending, he supports peer evalua
tion and enhanced credentialing require
ments for teachers.
Lungren. in contrast, prefers to hand key
district decisions to parent-dominated
councils. He also supports school choice
through a voucher program. Instead of
spending taxpayers' money on vouchers.

Davis proposes an increase in the number
of California's charter schools. We agree
with this position.
The candidates also have conflicting
positions on Proposition 209, which abol
ished affirmative action in higher educa
tion. Like Davis, we oppose this policy.
Social issues, particularly abortion, are
playing a significant role in this gubernato
rial race. Davis' steadfast support of a
woman's right to choose is in line with our
values. Lungren opposes abortion rights
and voted against abortion in Congress. By
seeking to unseat two California Supreme
Court justices who struck down a law
requiring parental consent for an abortion
as a violation of privacy, Lungren is sacri
ficing judicial independence to his social
agenda.
In addition, Davis shares our commit
ment to the environment by supporting a
permanent ban on offshore drilling and
applying scrutiny to several state projects
with possible adverse impacts. While Lun
gren is in favor of extending the moratori
um on offshore drilling, he voted against a
permanent ban as a Congressman.
Moth candidates for California governor
are accomplished politicians who currently
hold state offices. Lungren is perhaps better
at articulating the changes he would like to
bring to the state. I lowever. we largely dis
agree with the direction of his policy pro
posals.
With his tremendous skills at building
consensus and at bringing opposing views
to the table, Davis is the right leader for
California. We endorse his vision and his
candidacy.
