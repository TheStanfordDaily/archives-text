## Oh, the soft curve of a beer belly 
### 
Hey, brittney
Jensen, 1 am
"skinny enough
and happy with my body
the way it is." I love my
body because my head
works, my lungs breathe
and my heart beats. Some-

time after a copy-edit we
should go out for carrot sticks and low-fat
cottage cheese and discuss some of this
body image stuff. Since we both have slight
builds, we could bond over what it's like to
have your friends give you the clothes they
outgrew in junior high, or to be mistaken for
an adolescent boy, or to buy bras in the chil
dren's department (uh ... I think those last
two are all me).
But seriously, Brittney, you've got me
thinking about some of the issues that sur
round body image. Bodies of every shape
and size seem to attract various degrees of
unwanted attention. Fat girls get fat jokes.
Skinny girls get accused of being anorexic.
Curvaceous girls get whistles and stares,
attracting men interested in their bodies
and not their brains. It's hard for us to mind
our own business and let everybody's body
be its own body.
There have been psychology papers, fem
studies speakers, comm movies, photo pro
jects, dorm discussions and support groups
on female body image. It's heavy, emotion
al-psycological stuff, and I think it's good
that we have safe spaces where we can talk
about it. There's also a whole other realm of
interesting, heavy, emotional-psychological

stuff that it isn't yet acceptable to discuss:
male body image.
Spend some time in women's public
restrooms and you're bound to meet a
woman doing a full-body once-over in the
mirror. When she sees you watching her,
she'll say something in an explanatory, con
versational manner like, "Gosh. I really
need to lose 10 pounds" or "1 need to work
out more. These jeans make my butt look
really big." The same shopper who avoided
eye contact across the rack of blouses at
Nordstrom's is suddenly sharing personal
information about her self-esteem and her
body with you, a total stranger.
Men, for the most part, don't talk about
body image (their own. I mean). Hut you
know that somewhere between junior high
locker rooms and the pages of GO maga
zine, males here and there have compared
their bodies to those they've seen, in public
or in the media, and felt bad about the way
their bodies match up.
Newspaper and magazine articles
describe the phenomenon of men becoming
more interested in their appearance as sort
of a silly, lighthearted joke. May's issue of
GO tells men how to give themselves mani
cures. "Do it in front of the boob tube, dur
ing halftime, between handfuls of chips. It
won't seem so girlish." But even if men
aren't talking about body image issues,
they're acting on them.
More and more men are flocking to
salons, personal trainers and plastic sur
geons, causing Mindelle Jacobs of the
Toronto Sun to remark, "Be it the mucli

bemoaned crisis of m. le identity in the
wake of feminism or advertising executives
simply looking for anot jr area to exploit,
men have now fallen vie m to the cult of
the perfect body." The more men start giv
ing themselves facials and looking at them
selves in those magnifying makeup mirrors,
the greater the danger of criticizing what
they see. Do TV sitcom jokes about beer
bellies and penis size resonate louder than
the laugh track responses they receive?
As difficult as it is to rem nd myself, I
have to keep in mind that strij, 'd down to
the core, my body's purpose is to keep my
mind functioning. The assumptions made
about who we are based on how we look are
secondary. If we're going to examine our
bodies with magnifying glasses, we need to
start looking for things to appreciate rather
than deprecate.
Men. if you're going to start pondering
your pudge and pores, this is your chance to
change the way we look at ourselves, seek
ing out quirks, not critiques, compliment
ing, not criticizing. Why is it so hard to stop
seeing pudgy tummies as gross and see
beauty in a soft curve? Why can't we see
small breasts as delicate rather than defi
cient? A lot of women who haven't figured
this out yet are probably reading this
month's issue of Cosmo, which asks, "Are
vou suffering from labia envy?"

Even after reading the November issue of
Cosmo, Rachel Hutton has no idea how her
labia stack up against those of other women.
She is a senior majoring in product design.
