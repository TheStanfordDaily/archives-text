Double standard harms
the athletics program
In my Oct. 22 letter, I never claimed
that the Athletics Department steals
scholarships from Stanford's need-based
aid program, nor was I unaware that the
department is financially independent.
Nor did I ever claim that the Athletics
Department should be scapegoated for all
of Stanford's problems. How could any
one with a shred of intelligence believe
that all athletes are guilty of the crimes I
listed? Pick up a ball or jump in a pool and
voild, you become a violent, stupid troll.
Please.
In her Oct. 28 letter. Alii Henry won
ders if I've met "some" quality athletes
during my time here, and defends "many
athletes" as earning good grades despite
their rigorous travel schedules. Did I not
state specifically that "there are certainly
many athletes among us who are bright
students and good citizens"? Could I have
been any clearer? We seem to agree that
the majority of athletes can hold their own
academically, but Henry manages to write
an entire letter arguing as if we do not.
I believe strongly that a subset of ath
letes at Stanford does not deserve to hold
Stanford diplomas. How is one to write
about a problem that needs to be
addressed without being accused of
stereotyping? That's what a disclaimer is

for!
No one is saying that athletes are less
worthy than other people; hut athletes
who cannot meet the same high academic
standards that everyone else must meet
should absolutely not be admitted simply
because the football team needs starters.
These students would never be admitted
except for the unfairly large role the Uni
versity allows the Athletics Department to
play, directly or indirectly, in the admis
sions process. It's also true that some peo
ple who aren't athletes also might not
meet those academic standards, but that
Stanford might have another corrupt
admission policy doesn't make athletic
preferences justifiable.
What is at issue here is the double stan
dard that the Athletics Department
exploits for its coaches, finances and stu
dent conduct. If President Casper must
divulge his earnings, what justification can
a football coach give for hiding his? Many
Stanford students spent their time becom
ing outstanding poets, musicians, and
artists, or earning science and mathemat
ics awards, but they don't get scholarships
based on those achievements and skills.
If athletes (and other students) are
tired of the stereotypes, they should join
me in demanding that the Athletics
Department hold its students up to the
same standards non-athletes are judged
by, both academically and otherwise. This
means an end to merit-based scholarships.

This means an end to disparate academic
standards, of bringing in even one football
player who can't write in full sentences
(and at least one has been here because I
lived next door to him). This means that
anyone, including athletes, who damages
property and commits acts of blatant crim
inality is punished seriously, regardless of
his or her value as an athlete. This means
that the Athletics Department divulges
the salaries of its coaches. This means that
no matter how much money athletics
brings to Stanford, they live by the same
rules and ideals as the rest of us. Is this too
much to ask?
If we truly believe that the majority of
athletes are capable students, then remov
ing those who are not shouldn't be too
much trouble. In the end, their presence
hurts all of us — perhaps most of all. the
athletes who deserve the prestige of being
full-fledged Stanford students.

authors and left us looking elsewhere for

artistic reflections." Then he proclaims
that song lyrics and screenplays are the

however, neglects to mention the greatest
revolution in communication this century:
the Internet.
Maybe we don't read The New Yorker,

superior medium which allows a dynamic

Ops page lacks relevance
I've never been a big fan of the Daily,
because I've found it to be largely fluff.
However, I must say that the opinions
page is one of the least relevant portions
of the whole paper. It's become a platform
for a bunch of egoists to spout off on top
ics which concern no one but them. Occa
sionally in the past I've seen some really

good articles addressing actual issues in
the world or on campus. The one about
the post office was a great example of this.
That was something that any student on
campus could relate to. The correct way to
pronounce "sherbet" is not.
When I see an article about a frat boy
whining about the loss of his house, it
doesn t move me. As to the multiple arti
cles relating to the fact that none of the
writers will get a job because they don't
want to "sell out." I also don't care. The
opinions page should not be a forum for
people to shout their insecurities or how
they re being mistreated by the world.
Opinion articles should be thought-pro
voking. but thus far they just provoke a
vaguely uncomfortable feeling for the
poor person who wrote them.
I o sum it all up, please encourage these
people to stick to topics which are of gen
eral (and not just personal) interest.
