# Where we are
## Ditching the office for the skeeball life 
### 
David Stein

Tomorrow being election
day, I suggest we all take a collective
patriotic deep breath and think hard
for a moment about the one issue that has
been plaguing the candidates day and night:
how to make bucketfuls of cash.
Now, I detest as much as the next guy the
fact that Congressional votes can be bought
or sold for a can of Pringles, but this is not
the place to discuss finance reform.
Because, like I said, election day is tomor
row, and the one thing furthest from any
good American's mind is the discussion of
serious political issues. We, the people,
don't want liberty: we want money.
You might think that as seniors, I, along
with my hardworking peers, have sublimat
ed our desire for money into the search for
a job. However, despite the rabid, freeze
tag like hunt for employment ("Hey, Bob!
Is that a job hiding behind that tree? Go get
it!") no truthful senior actually wants a job.
We all pretend that we want to don the
cloak of responsibility, but we also know
that this cloak is heavy and uncomfortable
and often clashes with the latest styles. And
if you don't believe me, trap some seniors as

they trudge off from the career center and
ask them. It might take them a while but
they'll eventually break down and admit
that instead of spending 5()-plus hours a
week in an office, they'd rather be playing
skeeball. at least until they win enough tick
ets to buy the Super-Cool Radio (i.e. forev
er).
The problem is that without a job, it's
quite difficult to make money, which you
need to buy the tokens to play skeeball. Of
course, some people don't have to worry
about making a living. For example, there
are those out there whose great-grandfa
thers discovered some very useful product
such as coal and now can live off the divi
dends until the end of the world. And who
can forget the rare few who possess that
strange and wonderful talent of hitting a
small, leather orb about four hundred feet
over a wall with a wooden bat and whose
most pressing financial decision will be
whether to have their vacation homes in
Paris or Vail?
Then there are the rest of us â€” short on
athletic ability and inheritance. But we
shouldn't despair because we have Stan

ford-trained minds, we have creativity and
we have hope. And some of us, meaning
myself, have a slew of Million-Dollar Ideas.
I conceived of my first Million-Dollar
Idea about two years ago when I realized I
couldn't hit a baseball out of the infield, and
since then, I've developed scores of them. I
would like to present a few here for you to
look at because if there's one thing a Million-
Dollar Idea Person needs, aside from a com
plete mental evaluation, it is venture capital.
And luckily for me, the Stanford community
has more venture capital than a sorority girl
has tank tops. For your consideration:
The Un-Button: Let's stay you've just
stumbled into an elevator, perhaps after a
little too much to drink, and while you want
to go to the eighth floor, you also press the
button for the fourth, fifth, sixth and sev
enth floors. Now, instead of having to stop
on the in-between floors, you can press the
Un-Button and erase those floors from the
elevator's computerized memory. This
device would work extremely well with
skyscrapers, as well as sober people. And
just think of all the unemployed elevator
operators who would now have jobs!

The Nacho Warmer Plate: Nachos are
great, hut after about three minutes, that
velvety sheet of cheddar cools and congeals
into a blanket of orange leather. T his plate
will contain a built-in heating device that
will keep the nachos constantly warm, while
it will remain cool to the touch. It could also
be used as a Spaghetti Warmer Plate and
Waffle Warmer Plate, but we could sell
those separately to increase profits.
The Microwave Gun: 1 understand that
this invention would probably require
major Congressional legislation, but it could
have serious implications for our law
enforcement officials and make me a ton of
dough. First, all guns manufactured in the
United States would be required to have a
small microchip embedded in them which
would somehow allow the gun to fire. How
ever, police officers would have the
Microwave Gun that would emit special
microwaves that would blast the little
microchip and turn the gun off. That way, in
case the cops are in a hostile situation, they
would be safe from enemy gunfire. There
are some technicalities still to be worked
out, but I've already shipped a whole case of

Pringles to my local Congressman and got
ten the green light.
The Kar Alarm Clock: Since 1 began liv
ing in a single last year. I've come to love the
concept of roommates, but I know some of
you hate them and their whiny alarm clocks.
Now. with the Ear Alarm Clock, their
wake-up wails will only be heard by them,
as this state-of-the-art clock will actually fit
inside their ears. Originally, the clock was
going to be surgically implanted in the knee
(and elsewhere), but, you're right, the ear's
the best place.
I would like to warn everyone out there
that stealing one of these ideas is strictly
prohibited, although 1 have yet to get
patents on any of them. Nevertheless, I will
prosecute any theivery to the fullest extent
of the law. assuming that I can get some
time off of work next year to go to the court
house.

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, wants all potential future employ
ers to know that he was kidding about not
wanting a job and will actually work for
doughnuts.
