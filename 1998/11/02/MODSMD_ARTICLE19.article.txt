## Cross country dominates Pac-10 championships Stamps takes second individually 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
In its usual display of dominance,
the women's cross country team
plowed through the cold and rain at
Alton Baker Park in Eugene, Ore. to
claim its third straight Pacific 10 Con
ference cross country championship.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
â–  Saturday: No. 2 Stanford places
first at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

Totaling 53 points, the Cardinal
was never really challenged by the
nine-team field. Its closest competi
tor, 13th-ranked Washington,
seemed more concerned with hold
ing off sixth-ranked Arizona than
with catching No. 2 Stanford. Wash
ington succeeded in capturing sec
ond place with 74 points to Arizona's
92.
In perhaps the Cardinal's best dis
play of depth this season, all seven
Cardinal runners placed under 27th
place. As usual, the tone was set by
sophomore standout Julia Stamps.
Stamps went out front early and
maintained her position to earn a sec
ond-place finish in 17 minutes, 24 sec
onds behind Arizona's Amy Skieresz
(16:59). Skieresz's victory was her
fourth straight at the Pac-10 meet.
Behind Stamps, or rather at her
side, was Stanford junior Sally
Glynn. After coming off an impres
sive sixth-place finish at the pre-Na

tional meet in Kansas two weeks ago,
Glynn stepped it up another notch to
finish just a step behind teammate
Stamps.
Both Stamps and Glynn credit
each other for their stellar perfor
mances.
"1 think that it was very beneficial
because we did have a pack right next
to us." said Stamps. "We were able to
work together in order to make sure
that the runners behind us wouldn't
pass us. It definitely was encouraging
to have Sally right beside me."
"The race went out a little slower
than it has in the past," said Glynn. "1
moved up a little bit each mile and a
had very good ending and it was basi
cally all because of Julia. She really
motivated me and pulled me through
a really strong last half mile, especial
ly the last 4(X) meters of the race. She
ran to the line really well and it pulled
me along to finish third. I was really
happy with it."
Next across for the Cardinal was
captain Mary Cobb in 13th. followed
by Courtney Adams in 16th and
Mary Huang in l l )th. While Cobb has
had strong finishes all season long,
this marks the first time this year that
Adams and Huang finished in Stan
ford's top five in a major competition.
Head coach Vin Lananna was
pleased with Adams and I luang.
"I thought our team really re
sponded to today's challenge, espe
cially at our fourth and fifth posi
tions," Lananna said. "This was the
