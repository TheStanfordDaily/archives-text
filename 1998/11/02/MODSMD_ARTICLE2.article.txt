Stanford sports fans and nature lovers every

been returned.
An unidentified person returned the un
harmed Tree costume to the IJC-Berkeley

Chancellor's Office at 4 p.m. on Friday. A
UCPD officer immediately escorted the Tree to
the Stanford Police Station, where it remains,
under armed guard, in the evidence room. The
costume's owner and wearer, junior C 'litis I len
derson. will reclaim the Tree in time for Tues
day's women's volleyball game.
A representative for the Phoenix Five, the

group of Cal students claiming credit tor the
theft, called the Cal Chancellor's office Friday
afternoon to determine whether charges would
still be pressed if they returned the Tree imme
diately. Cal officials consulted the Stanford Po
lice. who agreed to drop all charges upon the
safe return of the Tree.
