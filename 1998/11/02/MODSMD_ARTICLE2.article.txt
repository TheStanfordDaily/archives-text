### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Stanford sports fans and nature lovers every
where ean breathe a sigh of relief: the Tree has
been returned.
An unidentified person returned the un
harmed Tree costume to the IJC-Berkeley

Chancellor's Office at 4 p.m. on Friday. A
UCPD officer immediately escorted the Tree to
the Stanford Police Station, where it remains,
under armed guard, in the evidence room. The
costume's owner and wearer, junior C 'litis I len
derson. will reclaim the Tree in time for Tues
day's women's volleyball game.
A representative for the Phoenix Five, the

group of Cal students claiming credit tor the
theft, called the Cal Chancellor's office Friday
afternoon to determine whether charges would
still be pressed if they returned the Tree imme
diately. Cal officials consulted the Stanford Po
lice. who agreed to drop all charges upon the
safe return of the Tree.
The man who returned the tree
was apparently not a student and
was "of parental age," according to
Cal spokesman Jesus Mena.
The Phoenix Five stole the Tree
on the early morning of Oct. 17
from a locked cage in the Band
Shak. The group claimed responsi
bility for the heist a week later by
sending a letter and a photo of the
blindfolded Tree to The Daily Cali
fornian, Cal's newspaper.
Last week, Cal Chancellor
Robert Berdahl issued a statement
calling for the return of the tree and
declaring that Oski, Cal's mascot,
would not appear at Cal events until
the Tree was returned.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, Cal spokesman Jesus
Mena and Stanford Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais all stated that the
police and the schools consider the
matter to be closed, and none will
seek punishment for the Phoenix
Five.
In the last several days, the po
lice had been hot on the trail of the
Phoenix Five, according to Niemey
er.
"We had one guy identified, and

it was only a matter of time [until
the others were discovered],"
Niemeyer said.
"We stopped their car at 4:30 of
the morning in question [Oct. 17]
and the driver was interviewed and
released," he added. After the theft
was reported, "our detectives went
up to Berkeley and talked to him,
but he wasn't cooperative. We
could tell by his body language that
he was being less than honest."
Neither Stanford nor the police
is taking any further measures to
protect the Tree in the future.
"I have all the confidence in the
world that the truly incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band will take all mea
sures necessary to prevent a similar
incident from reoccurring," said
Wais.
Now that the Tree is back, "I'll
be excited to see both mascots per
form at the 101st Big Game," said
Wais.
Mena added that "We hope to
return to the rivalry where all the
hard hitting will be on the field."
Henderson is just relieved that
his costume has been recovered.
"It's bittersweet. I'm happy that
it's back; I'm sad it's been contami
nated by being on the Cal campus
for two weeks."
