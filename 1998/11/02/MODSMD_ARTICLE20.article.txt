EUGENE, Ore. — Amid drenching
Oregon rains and sponge-like course
conditions, the No. 1 Stanford men
found a way to successfully defend
their Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship on Saturday.
Led by the fourth-place finish of
senior Brad Hauser. the Cardinal
edged No. 3 Oregon by two points,
48 to 50. capturing its third consecu
tive conference championship. Ari
zona. ranked fifth nationally, was
third with 90 points.
"It was a very close meet." said
head coach Vin Lananna. "I think
our first four runners had brilliant
races, but we had a little difficulty in
the five through seven spots.
"1 assure you, we'll have that
fixed by NCAAs," Lananna said.
The Cardinal contingent ap
peared to be dominating early, as all
seven Stanford runners were repre
sented in the lead pack through the
one-mile marker.
Abdi Abdirahman of Arizona
and Washington State's Bernard
Lagat established themselves as the
front-runners soon thereafter and
only seniors Brent Hauser and Jason
Balkman and sophomore Jonathan
Riley joined Brad Hauser in the
chase pack.
Racing from behind, the Oregon
Ducks took I he Cardinal to task.
Duck senior Ail-American Matthew
Davis passed Brad Hauser near the
third-mile marker and Oregon ju

nior Steve Fein moved up to
Riley, Balkman and Brent Hauser/
Abdirahman cruised to victory in
23 minutes. 23 seconds, followed by
Lagat (23:33), Davis (23:37) and
Brad Hauser (23:41).
Then things got interesting.
Charging the finishing stretch.
Riley blasted past Fein to capture
sixth place (24:(X)) and was tailed
closely by eighth-place Brent Hauser
(24:12) and Balkman in ninth
(24:12).

MEN S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford places
first at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

An Oregon deluge followed. The
Ducks squeezed their next live run
ners. the remainder of their squad,
before senior Jon Weldon, the final
Stanford scorer (21st place. 24:30).
Stanford junior Jake Maas was
22nd in 24:34 and freshman Gabriel
Jennings, who has recently been
hampered by shin pains, was 44th
overall in 25:32.
Riley's late charge may have been
the key to the Cardinal's victory.
Had Fein held onto his lead through
the finish stripe. Stanford and Ore
gon would have been locked in a 49-
point tie for first.
A tie-breaker in this situation
would go to the teams' respective
sixth men, where Oregon had the
upper hand with Lincoln Nehring's

19th-place showing (24:27).
"Jon [Riley] is a great competi
tor," Lananna said. "I think he's on
the rise, and he'll get better as the
season progresses."
The eight-kilometer course,
which toured the grass and bark

trails of Eugene's Alton Baker Park,
was soggy and slippery at race time,
and hay bails spanning parts of the
trail added an extra measure of diffi
culty to the race.
"I think when you're not used to
something like [the race conditions],
it can he a little difficult," said Lanan
na. "But overall, I don't think the
weather was a big factor for us
today."
