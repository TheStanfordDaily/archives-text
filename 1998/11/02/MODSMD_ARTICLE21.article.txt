WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 5 Stanford (19-2,
13-0 Pacific 10 Conference) d.
Washington State (9-9,6-6), 15-10,
15-12,15-9.
■ Friday: Stanford d. Washington
(5-10,4-7), 15-13,15-5,15-13.

Early on in Friday's match, it
appeared as though Washington
(5-10 overall, 4-7 Pac-10) was play
ing a pre-Halloween prank on the
Cardinal (19-2,13-0), disguised as
a completely different team than
the Huskie squad that bowed to
Stanford a month ago at Maples
Pavilion.
Washington got out to an 11-5
lead early, but fortunately the Car
dinal unmasked the weaker
Huskies and took the first game
15-13.
After dominating play in a 15-5
game-two rout, Stanford had to
battle in the final game, and even
tually scored the match sweep
with a 15-13 win.
Pac-10 Player of the Week
Kerri Walsh led the Cardinal with
18 kills and 15 digs, continuing her
outstanding play since returning
from shoulder surgery.
Freshman outside hitter
Michelle Chambers added a dou
ble-double, her third of the sea
son, with 11 kills and 12 digs.
Sophomore middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer tallied 12 kills
and led all Cardinal defenders
with seven blocks.
The Huskies were led offen
sively by Lisa Underhill. who had
11 kills on the night. Leslie Tu
iasosopo and Kristina Laffling,

Washington's two main weapons,
were held to just 10 kills each.
Friday's win marked Stanford
coach Don Shaw's 4(K)th career
victory.
In his 14 years on the Farm.
Shaw has led the Cardinal to four
national titles and has amassed the
highest winning percentage in
NCAA history.
After the tight three-game de
feat of Washington on Friday
night, the Cardinal hit the road
and spent Halloween night in Pull
man.
On Sunday morning at Beasley

Coliseum, however, there was no
way to trick anyone that Washing
ton State was in any condition to
compete with the rolling Cardinal.
And the resulting three-game
sweep was anything hut a treat for
the Cougars.
Walsh was the key figure in the
Cougars' nightmare, as she led
Stanford to victory with 10 kills
and digs. Over the past five
matches, the two-time All-Ameri
can has four double-doubles and
one triple-double.

defeated in conference play with a sweep of the Washington
schools.

a potent offensive weapon for the
Cardinal in the middle, posting 13

before crossing the Bay to take on
