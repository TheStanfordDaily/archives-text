### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
With a tournament title coming
off two crucial victories, the No. 11
Stanford men's soccer team (13-5) is
building momentum ;it just the right
time of the season.
With Saturday's 1-0 upset victory
against No. 10 St. John's (10-4-3)
and yesterday's 2-0 defeat of Rider
(10-7-1), Stanford matched last sea
son's win total with three regular
season games left.
Stanford did not let last week
end's loss take it off its course, and
the team was able to keep its intensi
ty up against Rider after the vital St.
John's battle.
"This really puts us back on
track." said senior captain A.J.
Sauer. " I he victory over St. John's
puts us in the prime time."
Entering the game ranked one
higher than the Cardinal, and with
the confidence of a 19% NCAA
championship. St. John's battled
Stanford to the final horn.
Stanford went up 1-0 in the first
half, and managed to hold on for the
victory.
"It was a good performance
against a very good team," said Stan
ford head coach Hobby Clark. "I've
seen us play better, but against a
good team, you aren't going to get
your way all 90 minutes."
Cardinal senior defender Jamie
Clark scored the game's only goal
during the 26th minute of the game.
Redshirt junior T.K. Inbodv set the
play up on a corner kick to the near
post, and redshirt senior Shan Ciaw
took a shot that was blocked and de
flected to Jamie Clark, who put it in
for his fifth goal of the season. I he
assist went to (law, also his fifth.
While Stanford controlled much
of the first half, the solid St. John's
squad, featuring Ail-American se
nior midfielder Stefani Miglioranzi,
couldn't be silenced until the final
horn.
"Duringthe first half things for us
were calm, but the second half got
away from us a little." said (iaw. who
marked Miglioranzi. "We forced
ourselves to work a lot harder, and
didn't make it as easy as we could
have."
As expected, the game was pri
marily a defensive battle. The Red
Storm outshot Stanford 6-4. Stan
ford created several scoring oppor
tunities throughout the game, but

was unable to turn them into shots
on goal, managing only one shot in
the second half.
The Cardinal's defense, ranked
second in the country, allowed only
one legitimate scoring opportunity
the entire first half, but redshirt
sophomore goalie Adam Zapala
challenged St. John's junior forward
Medufia Kulego and came up with
the save. I he Red Storm's next best
scoring opportunities didn't come
until late in the second half.

■ Yesterday: California Tourna
ment Championship game. No. II
Stanford (13-5) 2. Rider (10-7-1) 0.
■ Saturday: Stanford I. No. 10 St.
John's (10-4-3) 0.

The best attack for St. John's
came as Miglioranzi drove a shot
from 15 yards out that Zapala tipped
up and off the crossbar. The week
end's shut-outs were his 11th and
12th of the season.
But Zapala credits his team
mates.
"We play so well defensively as a
team, from the forward back, and
once in a while I will have to make a
save," Zapala said.
And it was again the entire team
defense that stepped up again in yes
terday's 2-0 victory over Rider.
After the crucial win Saturday, Stan

lord did not allow the letdown.
"It was important to have a
strong game after Saturday's big
game." said redshirt sophomore
Chris Gores.
While the game remained score
less in the first half, the team kept its
composure, showing the maturity it
prides itself on.
"They had to be patient." Bobby
Clark said. "I was a little worried
that they were getting frustrated, but
they settled down nicely."
The first goal came in the 63rd
minute of the game. On a long throw
in by freshman Lee Morrison, C lores
flicked the ball from the near post to
the far post, where Suaer was wide
open. Sauer headed the ball in for
the goal, his fifth. Assists went to
C lores and Morrison.
"It is great for A.J. to get his scor
ing touch back." said Bobby Clark.
"That really got us off the ground."
The second goal came only five
minutes later. Junior midfielder
Gerard Davis sent a through ball to
Sauer, who made a late run around
the defense. 'Though he had the
keeper one on one. Sauer used his
composure to draw the goalie out
and pass the ball to senior Aaron
Jones, who had made a supporting
run. Jones easily slipped the ball into
the net for the Cardinal's second
goal of the match. Sauer took the as

Whereas the team's intensity
trailed off at the end of the St. John's
game, the Cardinal maintained its
play until the end against Rider.
"Wc really put on a clinic over the
last minutes," Hobby Clark said.
The Cardinal was also forced to
utilize its depth this weekend. Hue
to injuries, and in an attempt to con
serve energy for the back-to-back
games, the Cardinal lineup was jug
gled all weekend.

Sophomore forwards Matt
Moses and Luke Rust started both
games, a combination the Cardinal
had not vet seen all season. Due to a
thigh contusion, senior forward and
regular starter Adam Siegman was
sidelined all weekend.
In the backfield, it was Gores
who earned the start, and Davis
moved from defense to the midfield
in place of sophomore Scan Svlvis.
who is out for the season with a bro
ken leg. Freshman Derek Shanahan
also saw a lot of time.
The juggled lineup "makes a big
difference," Gaw said. "You can go
over it as much as vou want, but it

takes getting used to."
Though the lineup was slightly
out of sync against St. John's, it set
tled in against Rider.
"Moses stepped into the shoes of
Adam very well and contributed a
lot in the second half [against
Rider]," Bobby Clark said. "Gores
also had a tremendous weekend."
For their efforts, Jamie Clark,
Claw, Zapala and senior Simon El
liott were named to the All-Tourna
ment team.
In the tournament's other match
es, Rider and California battled to a
scoreless tie, while St. John's beat
Cal in double overtime.
