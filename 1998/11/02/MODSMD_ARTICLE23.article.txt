## Card wins at USC 
### Jonathan Stull 
The women's swimming team has
a lot going for it. It is the defending
national champion, it lost lew impor
tant team members and it gained an
impressive freshman class.
Despite this. Cardinal swimmers
talk little ol the season-ending
NCAA championships, the most im
portant meet of the year. The meet is
always in the back of their minds but
they say that at this point, training is
the most important thing. And vet.
so early in the season, with so little on
the line, many of the Cardinal turned
in record times.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford finishes
first at the USC Swimming Invita
tional.

At this weekend's USC Swim
ming Invitational at the McDonald's
Swim Stadium Friday and Saturday,
three Stanford swimmers won two
events each. Junior Catherine Fox
won the 100-yard freestyle and KM)
backstroke, junior Ciabrielle Rose
won the 200 freestyle and 200
breaststroke and freshman Shelly
Ripple won both the 2(H) backstroke
and 2(H) butterfly. Ripple's time of
2:(K).()8 in the butterfly automatical
ly qualified her for the NCAA
Championships.
Also, Fox, Rose, sophomore
Misty Hvman and freshman Jessica
Foschi set a pool record in the 8(H)-
freestyle relay with a time of 7:23.68.
"It's really early in the season and
1 think we were really tired going in.
but we swam really well," said Smith,
one of the team's co-captains.
Stanford competed against USC.
UC-Irvine. Cal State-Bakersfield
and UC-Santa Barbara at the meet,
but USC was the Cardinal's main
competition.
Faring so well against the Tro
jans, one of the Cardinal's main com
petitors for both the Pacific 10 Con
ference and NCAA titles, was im
portant as it gave the team an early
comparison to the Trojans.
"It was really good to see where
they are and where we are compared

to them." Smith said. "We have a lot
of really good sprinters, and they
have a lot of long-distance swim
mers. We're a little different, but we
swam really well."
The team was especially happy
with its performance because it has
yet to go through November, the
hardest month of training. Accord
ing to senior co-captain Elin
Austevoll, coach Richard Quick
turns up the intensity and the dis
tance of each workout, packing more
yards into every practice.
"Now the hard part of our season
really starts." she said. "Hard
weights, hard workouts, more yards.
Everything is turned up."
Many said the team aspect of col
legiate swimming is crucial as the in
tensity of these workouts increases.
" Team dynamics are really im
portant." Smith said. "When you
have to get up so early and train so
hard, it can be tough if you're just
doing it lor yourself."
Especially true for freshmen, who
are used to swimming for individual
results only, the team concept is a
new. and refreshing, idea.
"We have the greatest team."
Ripple said. "In the middle of a real
ly tough workout, when we're all in a
lot of pain, everyone is really encour
aging. 1 just go out to workout with a
smile on my face. I've never had so
much lun before."
Many are hoping that Ripple and
the rest of the highly touted fresh
men swimmers keep having so much
fun and keep swimming so last. On
top ol Ripple's success, Foschi won
the 4(H) individual medley in 4:20.63,
a time that Foschi said was the best
she's had in a non-season race.
"We've been swimming really
well and we've been contributing a
lot." Foschi said.
The freshmen, and the rest of the
powerful Cardinal team, are going to
have to continue to swim well as the
season progresses to be ready for the
NCAAs.
"It's going to be a really good
championship [meet) this year," Fos
chi said. "There's some really good
competition. I'm looking forward to
it."
