MEN'S GOLF
■ Yesterday: Stanford finishes
fourth at the Nelson with an 871.

This weekend at the Nelson Invi
tational Tournament at the Stanford
Golf Course, the Cardinal proved
once again that it is a talented team
by earning a fourth-place finish for
the third straight tournament. Yet,
once again, Stanford's inconsistency
and lack of depth was its undoing and
the Cardinal came away from the
tournament disappointed.
"We're disappointed not to win
[the Nelson], but the team is proba
bly where I'd hope we would be,"
said coach Wallv Goodwin. "We're
not a pushover but we're not great.
"We've had to count too many
high scores, the 77s and 78s just kill
us. Also, we're not good at the No. 5
position and that puts a lot of pres
sure on the other four guys to do
well," said Goodwin.
The Cardinal was unable to capi
talize on its knowledge of its home
course and finished the three-dav

tournament at 19-over-par (871).
Stanford ended the tournament 11
strokes back of champion Colorado
State (860), who won the tournament
for the second year in a row.
"It's disappointing," said senior
Joel Kribel. "We all thought that we
could have won this tournament. I
think that we might have put too
much pressure on ourselves to do
well because it was our home
course."
Kribel was again Stanford's best
golfer, but his best was not good
enough for a victor)'. Although his
seven-under-par (206) tied the old
tournament record, Kribel finished
in second place, one stroke back of
Northwestern sophomore Luke
Donald who broke that record with
an eight-under-par 205.
"I scrambled really well today. 1
wasn't hitting the ball very well but
my short game kept me in it. It was
definitely a little disappointing to
bogey on the second-to-last hole,"
said Kribel.
Kribel's performance kept the
Cardinal in contention for the tour
nament as no other Stanford golfer
finished among the top 25. Besides
Kribel, the only Cardinal golfer to
crack the top 40 was walk-on sopho
more Eric Dahlberg, who finished
tied for 37th with a 222. Dahlberg en
tered the final round tied forl3th
place but dropped to 37th with a
seven-over-par 78 on Sunday.
