# Men's swimming repeats victory against Longhorns
## 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swim team
went down to No. 3 Texas hoping for
a repeat of last year's victory. The
Cardinal returned to campus having
achieved its goal of conquering Texas
once again.
No. 1 Stanford barely overtook
the Longhorns hv a score of 122-121.
Alter the first three events at the Ja
mail Texas Swimming Center, Stan
ford led 35-20. Texas won the next
two events — the 50- and 2(X)-yard
freestyles — keeping the meet close.
Each place in each event was impor
tant. but the fate of the meet rested
on the last relay, which Stanford won.
The fact that the meet was so close
was actually beneficial for Stanford.
"On the whole, the one-point
margin of victory was the best-case
scenario," said sophomore Adam
Messner. "The meet opened our eyes
to what needs to be improved, what
races need more depth. [11 ] helped us
discover our strengths and our weak
nesses."
Stanford won six of 13 events and
placed at least one person in the top
three in each event except in diving.
Sophomore diver Lucas Brower
placed fourth in both the one- and
three- meter diving competitions.

The Cardinal won both the 4(H)-
yard medley relay and the 4(X)-vard
freestyle relay. The 400 medley team
(3:15.87) of seniors Tate Blahnik.
Blake Holden. Dod Wales and Justin
Ewers and the 400 freestyle team
(2:57.53) of Ewers, Messner, Wales
and junior captain Glen Counts both
triumphed with NCAA considera
tion times.
Two other Stanford swimmers
also attained NCAA consideration
time. Adam Messner swam a 1:38.42
to win the 2(X) freestyle. He also
gained consideration time in the S(X)
freestyle, but placed second. Tate
Blahnik also won his event and swam
a consideration time of 1:45.20 in the
2(X) backstroke.
Other Cardinal winners include
Wales in the 1(X) freestyle (45.(X)) and
Holden in the 200 breaststroke
(2:02.35). Stanford had the top two
finishers in the 2(X) breaststroke, with
sophomore Rob Canales (2:03.63)
placing second behind Holden.
Actual times did not really matter
as the meet wore on. The Cardinal's
aim was to just place as high as possi
ble in each event to win the meet
overall.
"We were not really swimming for
time," Blahnik said. "We were just
trying to win or place second or third.
What was great was that the times

ended up being so fast."
The fact that many of the swim
mers did attain NCAA consideration
times takes off any added pressure to
the season. The team members can
concentrate on "the little things"
such as flip turns, details in stroke,
starts, turns and relay exchanges in
order to attain an even higher level of
skill and competitiveness.
"What B-cuts [consideration
times] means is that many of the
swimmers will automatically be
picked up for NCA As." Blahnik said.
"We don't have to worry about trying
to make cuts later and can focus on
trainini> now."

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 122,
No. 3 Texas 121.

The meet proved to Stanford that
it has a greater challenge this season
than it did last year and that it must
work even harder to repeat last year's
NCAA championship victory.
"The meet showed us that we still
have work to d 0... in order to step it
up to the next level. We're not going
to walk through the rest of the season
(like we can't he beaten]," Messner
said.
Texas provided Stanford with its
best challenge of the young season.
