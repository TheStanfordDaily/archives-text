# Hackers invade Leland system
## 
### Danielle Chang 
The FBI is investigating a hacking
incident discovered Monday in
which S,(KK) Leland computer system
passwords were stolen. It was the first
major break-in on Stanford's Leland
system, officials said.
The Leland system is perhaps best
known as the hub of student e-mail
accounts.
The break-in took place on Oct.
11, but, it wasn't until two weeks later
that officials discovered the presence
of a "sniffer," a software program
that can intercept login names and
passwords in two Leland Systems
workstations on the second floor of
Sweet Hall.
The hacking connection was
made directly from Sweden to Stan
ford. "(The fact that] there are sever
al addresses in Sweden and a ma
chine in Canada, combined with
other factors, led us to believe these

individuals are in Sweden," said
Stephen Hansen, computer security
officer.
Stanford, which is taking no new
action to improve its network securi
ty in response to the incident, has
turned the case over to the FBI.
According to Dennis Michael,
manager of Leland Systems, hacking
is a very serious felony.
"It's a crime to use somebody's
password without their permission,'
he said.
Over the preceding two weeks,
4,5(X) Leland account passwords,
along with 250 non-SUNet II) pass
words and 250 off-campus pass
words, had been compromised. The
accounts affected are mostly student
accounts. Only 5 to 10 percent of the
accounts involved are those of stall
and faculty, said Hansen.
So far the hacker has used only

one out of 5,000 accounts. The Web
sites and home pages associated with
the stolen passwords have not been
affected by this incident, said
Hansen.
The only way to hack into the Le
land system is by actually logging into
a machine on campus, according to
Hansen. Two original "sniffers"
broke into the system in the Storke
Publications Building and intercept
ed the password there to hack into
the workstations in Sweet Hall.
"The system on the second floor
[of Sweet Hall] is the most secured on
campus," said Hansen. "It's really
just bad luck that they found this ma
chine that is vulnerable."
Michael attributed the vulnerabil
ity of the two workstations to human
error. Mistakes made during routine
maintenance were not corrected,
leaving the workstations susceptible
to hackers.
"The person responsible did not
check it carefully," said Michael.

"Our system is only as strong as the
weakest machine on campus, that
shows how interrelated things all
are."
Officials have already notified all
on-campus account holders whose
passwords were compromised and
are in the progress of notifying those
with off-campus accounts.
The cost of correcting any hacking
incident is "extraordinarily expen
sive," said Michael, in terms of time
spent by University staff.
Similar hacking incidents have
happened to other computer systems
on campus. In June 19%, an un
known hacker logged into the Du
rand Building and captured numer
ous email passwords. Again in the
Durand Building, hackers seized 240
e-mail passwords early last April.
This past June, a hacking incident left
3,(XX) researchers paralyzed without
Internet service for a week.
Hansen pointed out there is
roughly one "sniffer" incident a
month at Stanford.
Hansen emphasized that, despite
the spate of recent hacking incidents
at Stanford, the University's system is

no more susceptible to hacking than
any other university's. "It's not out of
line," said Hansen.
Officials urged students who re
ceived security alert e-mails to
change their password immediately.
When a password is not encrypt
ed, it is sent over the network in a
clear text format. To prevent similar
incidents from happening, officials
recommend that students encrypt
their passwords using Kerberos, an
encryption software program known
at Stanford as PC-Leland or MacLe
land.
This easy-to-install software can
be downloaded from Stanford's site
licensed software Web site. For Mac
intosh software, the address is
http://www.stanford.edu/group/itss/
macstanford/download/single.html.
For PCs, the address is
http://www.stanford.edU/group/itss/p
cstanford/download/single .html.
All MacLeland and PC-Leland
sessions are encrypted, with the ex
ception of file transfer protocol ses
sions. Some security solutions should
be available for FTP by September
next year, Michael said.

Netscape and Eudora both have
passwords transmitted over the net in
clear text format. Officials are cur
rently testing an encryption software
for Netscape and are hoping to have
solutions by this coming January.
Stanford officials do not plan to
mandate an encryption program on
all electronic sessions because some
old computers do not run Kerberos
and the University's computer ad
ministration is very decentralized, ac
cording to Hansen.
Taking a "carrot rather than a
stick" approach, according to
Hansen, officials are making encryp
tion software free for students to
download.
"We emphasize security [here in
Sweet Hall]. If it could happen to us,
it could happen to anybody," added
Michael.
Compared to the officials' alert
sense of the seriousness of this hack
ing incident, students are taking it
lightly.
"I am not extremely concerned,
just changed my password, that's
enough," said Sheryle Stepley, a
coterminal student in psychology.
