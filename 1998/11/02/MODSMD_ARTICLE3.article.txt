The FBI is investigating a hacking
incident discovered Monday in
which S,(KK) Leland computer system
passwords were stolen. It was the first
major break-in on Stanford's Leland
system, officials said.
The Leland system is perhaps best
known as the hub of student e-mail
accounts.
The break-in took place on Oct.
11, but, it wasn't until two weeks later
that officials discovered the presence
of a "sniffer," a software program
that can intercept login names and
passwords in two Leland Systems
workstations on the second floor of
Sweet Hall.
The hacking connection was
made directly from Sweden to Stan
ford. "(The fact that] there are sever
al addresses in Sweden and a ma
chine in Canada, combined with
other factors, led us to believe these

individuals are in Sweden," said
Stephen Hansen, computer security
officer.
Stanford, which is taking no new
action to improve its network securi
ty in response to the incident, has
turned the case over to the FBI.
According to Dennis Michael,
manager of Leland Systems, hacking
is a very serious felony.
"It's a crime to use somebody's
password without their permission,'
he said.
Over the preceding two weeks,
4,5(X) Leland account passwords,
along with 250 non-SUNet II) pass
words and 250 off-campus pass
words, had been compromised. The
accounts affected are mostly student
accounts. Only 5 to 10 percent of the
accounts involved are those of stall
and faculty, said Hansen.
So far the hacker has used only
