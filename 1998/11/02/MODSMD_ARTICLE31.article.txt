# Water polo splits in South
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
The key to being a nationally
competitive team is to win the games
that count. And that's just what the
Stanford men's water polo team did
this weekend.
After suffering two consecutive
losses to die No. 2 UCLA Bruins.
Stanford left the Rose Bowl Aquat
ics Center with a 7-5 victory on Sat
urday. The win put the Cardinal at 6-
1 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and 15-4 overall. UCLA
falls to 12-3 and 4-1 in the MPSF.

MEW'S WATER POLO
■ Yesterday: No. 1 USC (17-1)7,
No. 4 Stanford (15-4) 5.
■ Saturday: Stanford (15-3, 6-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) 7, No. 2 UCLA (12-3,4-1) 5.

"We won the game we had to
win." said Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "That puts us in
a tie for second in league."
At halftime, the teams were tied
at four apiece. Stanford's offense
broke the game open in the third
quarter, outscoring the Bruins 3-1.
Neither team was able to convert
any of its fourth-period opportuni
ties.
Once again, the Cardinal offense
was led by senior Layne Beaubien
who scored twice, including a four
meter penalty shot. Senior Jeremiah
Rohison and juniors Brian Heilfer
on, Michael Lipinski, Andy Wal
burger and Sean Joy each added one

point. Senior goalie Chris Aguilera
tallied five saves in the match.
"We had six players score seven
goals," Dettamanti said. "Balanced
scoring was really a key. We scored
the last two goals of the third quarter
and that sealed it and we hung on at
the end to win."
Each team has only eight MPSF
league matches in the season, so only
one of the Stanford-UCLA games
counts in the league record. And
Stanford won the match that matters
most — the victory that decides
league standing and seeding for the
MPSF championship tournament.
"It's pretty typical of this group of
guys that when we play a better
team, if we lose the first game
[against them), we win the second or
third," Dettamanti said. "We seem
to figure them out."
Alter figuring out how to defeat
the No. 2 team in the nation, Stan
ford traveled to the McDonald's
Swim Stadium at USC for a non
league match against the top-ranked
Trojans on yesterday.
Stanford junior Jonathan
Skaalen, who led the team with two
points, scored the first goal of the
game. But USC" answered back to tie
things up at 1-1 at the end of the first
quarter. Skaalen scored his second
goal just 27 seconds into the second
period to give the Cardinal the lead
again. But the Trojans answered
with three straight goals to end the
half with a 5-4 lead.
Stanford went scoreless in the
third quarter, while USC scored
once. Each team scored once in the
final period, but the Cardinal offense

was unable to put away any more
shots despite a big opportunity to tie
things up near the end of play. The
Cardinal offense had a man-up fast
break when USC intercepted and
scored on the counter.
"That was a key play of the
game," Dettamanti said. "Instead of
tying, we ended up down by two."
Aguilera collected eight saves in
the match and seniors Jeremiah Ro
bison and David Hay and sopho
more Pasi Dutton each contributed
one goal. But Stanford had some
glitches in its offense that cost the
Cardinal some scoring opportuni
ties.
"We had trouble with our front
court offense," Dettamanti said.
"We concentrated more on [prepar
ing for] UCLA last week. This week
we'll concentrate more on USC. We
were having trouble solving their de
fense."
USC now stands at 17-1 overall.
The MPSF league match between
the Cardinal and the Trojans is this
Saturday at deGuerre pool.
"[The loss] doesn't hurt our
league record," Dettamanti said.
"Hut USC still has the best record.
We need to shoot for the second best
record."
In order to receive a berth in the
NCAA tournament, Stanford must
either win the MPSF tournament or
have the best record in the league. If
Stanford can defeat USC in next
weekend's match, the Cardinal will
have a shot at one of the top seeds in
the tournament. However, with
eight strong teams in the MPSF,
every game will be a challenge.
