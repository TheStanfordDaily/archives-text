# Card ends season with win
## 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
If there was a remedy for losing
three straight matches on the road
trip to Boston two weeks ago, it was
for Stanford's women's field hockey
team to come back and win the final
three games of the season.
It is now safe to say that the Car
dinal is cured.
This weekend Stanford (11-5)
finished its regular season by de
feating California (10-7). 1-0, yes
terday, and UC-Davis, 8-0, in a non
varsity match on Saturday.
The Cardinal continued the
school's revenge against the mas
cot-stealing Bears by sneaking into
enemy territory and returning to
Stanford after snatching Cal's hopes
of finishing the season with a victo
ry and remaining undefeated at
home.
However, like recent matches
between the rival schools, the game
was anything but a blowout. Stan
ford, already having beat Cal 3-0
earlier in the season, knew that it
would take a strong showing to de
feat the Bears.
"Being over there we knew it
would be a tough game," head
coach Sheryl Johnson said. "Cal
usually plays their toughest against
us, and we knew that."
The first half left the teams riuht

where they started as the Bears
were unable to get a shot-on-goal
and Stanford was unable to send
any of its seven shots past Cal goalie
Sarah Hoehn, who had two saves in
the period.
F.ven the opening of the second
half did not provide relief from the
deadlock. While both teams were
playing aggressively, the score
board remained stuck at zero.
Coach Johnson saw a number of
Stanford's scoring opportunities
pass by without result.
"[CaPs] goalkeeper had an out
standing game," Johnson said.
The break, arriving much later
than typical Stanford offensives, did
not come until there were just over
three minutes left in the match. Se
nior forward Monique Leroux, fin
ishing the season much as she had
started it. put the Cardinal up 1-0
with an unassisted goal.
Despite Cal's final effort to lie
the game after time had expired
with a penalty corner, Stanford de
flected the shot and returned home
having swept the Bears in 1998.
Senior forward Sarah Medeiros
recognized the significance of the
match.
"Any game against Cal is always
huge," she said, "especially going
into the conference championship."
The win was preceded by a victo
ry over Davis on Saturday, 8-0, in

which seven of Stanford's players
joined in the scoring festivities
against the Aggies.
Medeiros, win) has been side
lined with an injury for the majority
of the season, got the Cardinal off to
a quick start with two goals in the
first eight minutes. After scoring her
first goal of the season during last
weekend's match against Pacific,
Medeiros was determined to finish
the season strong by recording her
second and third goals in the last
two games. Her aggressiveness set
the tone for the match.

fornia (10-7)0.

"I think we knew we could beat
Davis but we definitely went into
the game [thinking] that we weren't
going to take it lightly." she said.
Medeiros was then joined by
Leroux. Carey Cloyd and Lissy
Goralnik, whose first-half goals
gave the Cardinal a commanding 5-
0 half-time lead.
Senior forward Cloyd was glad
that the match gave the younger
players an opportunity to play with
the team's veterans. The Cardinal
was also given an opportunity to
fine-tune its play for the upcoming
Northern Pacific Conference Tour
nament.
