# Boxer hits big issues in reelection campaign
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Tomorrow. Barbara Boxer seeks
reelection to the United States Sen
ate.
She was originally elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1992, and has served
California for the past six years pass
ing legislation in areas which include
an amendment to the Clean Water
Act and protecting women from vio
lence when they try to enter abortion
clinics.
Senior Steve Macias, a member
of the Stanford Democrats, said
"Senator Boxer's race is so impor
tant. not only because we are decid
ing whether or not to return a great
fighter for California to the Senate,
but also because we will be deter
mining whether or not Californians
approve of the horribly mismanaged
Republican-controlled C ongress."
Boxer and her opponent. Matt
Fong, disagree on many of the
toughest issues addressed in this
year's election.
" The momentum is definitely on
our side at the moment. 1 think on
election day California voters will re
alize that Senator Boxer has the right
stands on the important issues. I be
lieve they will also see that Matt
Fong is too extreme with his views on
guns, choice, the environment,
health care and education," Macias
said.
Boxer is a leader in the Senate in
the fight to ban "junk guns" — inex
pensive, easily concealable hand
guns. Senator Boxer introduced leg
islation in 1996 and 1997 that would
require American-made handguns

to meet the same quality and safety
standards as imported guns.
She is also a proponent of child
safety locks on handguns, and sup
ports the Brady Bill and the assault
weapons ban that was part of the
1994 crime bill.
Boxer is also an advocate for a
child's right to get the best education
possible. Her campaign literature
says that she "believes that educa
tion is the key to every child's future
success."
Boxer has passed legislation to in
crease the opportunity for all Cali
fornia students to receive a college
education. Nadim Elshami, a repre
sentative for Boxer, said that she
worked hard to pass the Higher Ed
ucation Act "which gives all college
students a 1 percent reduction in
their student loan interest rates and


Boxer
allows for a forgiveness of $S.(KK) in
the repayment of those loans. She
has also worked to improve repay
ment plan options."
Boxer has worked to ameliorate
problems in the quality of education
at the elementary and high school
levels as well. She introduced the
After School Education and Safety
Act of 1997, which "provides safe
learning environments for children
during the after-school hours when
most crimes committed by and
against juveniles occur," according
to her campaign literature.
Boxer also pushes hard for envi
ronmental protection. She worked
to increase protection of vulnerable
groups, such as children and the el
derly, from environmental hazards.
In the "Vulnerable Subpopulations"
amendment to the Safe Drinking
Water Act, she required that the En
vironmental Protection Agency
drinking water standards consider
the health effect of contaminants on
such populations.
She also introduced the Califor
nia Ocean Protection Act, which
"provides permanent protection for
the California coast from the ad
verse effects of ... harmful ocean
dumping [and other polluting acts)."
as is stated in her campaign litera
ture.

Boxer is one of nine women in the
U.S. Senate. "A few years ago there
was one woman senator, now there
are nine. Her work in the Senate has
been very effective... and she wants
more women in the Senate with
her," said Elshami.
Boxer has also been a strong sup
porter of women's rights. She
worked on the Family Planning and
Choice Act of 1997 which prohibited
a congressional restriction on abor
tion.
She also advocated including
contraception, prenatal care and
abortion in the president's health
care plan.
A former stockbroker. Boxer
began her political career in 1976
when she was elected to the Marin
County Board of Supervisors. She
went on to become the board's first
woman president. In 1982, she was
elected to the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives, and in 1992 was elected to
the Senate. In that historic election,
California became the first state to
be represented by two female sena
tors at the same time.
Many supporters are optimistic
about Boxer's chances.
"There's no doubt that it will be a
close race. However, if Democrats
do all they can to get their voters out.
Senator Boxer will be returning to
Washington," said Macias.

publican opponent, Matt Fong.
