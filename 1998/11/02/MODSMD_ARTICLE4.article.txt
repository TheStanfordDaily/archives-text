Tomorrow. Barbara Boxer seeks
reelection to the United States Sen
ate.
She was originally elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1992, and has served
California for the past six years pass
ing legislation in areas which include
an amendment to the Clean Water
Act and protecting women from vio
lence when they try to enter abortion
clinics.
Senior Steve Macias, a member
of the Stanford Democrats, said
"Senator Boxer's race is so impor
tant. not only because we are decid
ing whether or not to return a great
fighter for California to the Senate,
but also because we will be deter
mining whether or not Californians
approve of the horribly mismanaged
Republican-controlled C ongress."
Boxer and her opponent. Matt
Fong, disagree on many of the
toughest issues addressed in this
year's election.
" The momentum is definitely on
our side at the moment. 1 think on
election day California voters will re
alize that Senator Boxer has the right
stands on the important issues. I be
lieve they will also see that Matt
Fong is too extreme with his views on
guns, choice, the environment,
health care and education," Macias
said.
Boxer is a leader in the Senate in
the fight to ban "junk guns" â€” inex
pensive, easily concealable hand
guns. Senator Boxer introduced leg
islation in 1996 and 1997 that would
require American-made handguns

to meet the same quality and safety
standards as imported guns.
She is also a proponent of child
safety locks on handguns, and sup
ports the Brady Bill and the assault
weapons ban that was part of the
1994 crime bill.
Boxer is also an advocate for a
child's right to get the best education
possible. Her campaign literature
says that she "believes that educa
tion is the key to every child's future
success."
Boxer has passed legislation to in
crease the opportunity for all Cali
fornia students to receive a college
education. Nadim Elshami, a repre
sentative for Boxer, said that she
worked hard to pass the Higher Ed
ucation Act "which gives all college
students a 1 percent reduction in
their student loan interest rates and
