In light nt the Rohle Field attack of a Stanford
woman last week by an assailant still at large, the
University is planning to increase awareness of its
safety programs. Meanwhile, one of its main pro
grams, the St IRE Escort Service, hopes to im
prove its consistency and reliability by purchasing
two new golf carts.
According to Dean of Students Mare Wais, the
t Jniversity is "in the process of formulating a pro
grammatic response which would be University
wide and would also be sensitive to the women's
community."
The University's goal is to spend "more time
and effort to make people aware of the available
programs and services, such as St JRE. self-defense

classes and the blue-light emergency system,"
Wais added.
While police have not yet apprehended the at
tacker. efforts to pursue him continue, and com
posite sketches of the suspect have been posted
across campus.
Meanwhile, Wais stressed that "the I Jniversity
is very concerned with the welfare of the victim.
We are utilizing all of our resources, programs, and
services to support her at this point in time."
()ne of the I Jniversity's hopes is that students
take better advantage of St IRE, the escort service
which is available seven days a week from 7 p.m. to
2 a.m. 1 lowevcr. concern has arisen regarding the
service's reliability.
According to senior Nathaniel Boswell, SURE
manager. "We have two carts running every night

provided there is no maintenance trouble." On .
lew occasions, however, SURE has been unable t>
provide the golf cart escort due to trouble with tlv
carts. In these instances, the service offers n wall
ing escort instead.
Boswell said that the service's efforts have beer
plagued by the carts not working. "They gel a lot <
wear and tear, and there has been a problem will

In an effort to address this issue. Director of St u
dent Activities Nanci Howe says that the service,
plans to buy two new golf carts, including one thai
