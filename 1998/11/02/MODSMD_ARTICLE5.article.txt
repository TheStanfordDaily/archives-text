# Safety awareness stressed after attack
## SURE Escort improves cart service 
### Anuj Gupta 
In light nt the Rohle Field attack of a Stanford
woman last week by an assailant still at large, the
University is planning to increase awareness of its
safety programs. Meanwhile, one of its main pro
grams, the St IRE Escort Service, hopes to im
prove its consistency and reliability by purchasing
two new golf carts.
According to Dean of Students Mare Wais, the
t Jniversity is "in the process of formulating a pro
grammatic response which would be University
wide and would also be sensitive to the women's
community."
The University's goal is to spend "more time
and effort to make people aware of the available
programs and services, such as St JRE. self-defense

classes and the blue-light emergency system,"
Wais added.
While police have not yet apprehended the at
tacker. efforts to pursue him continue, and com
posite sketches of the suspect have been posted
across campus.
Meanwhile, Wais stressed that "the I Jniversity
is very concerned with the welfare of the victim.
We are utilizing all of our resources, programs, and
services to support her at this point in time."
()ne of the I Jniversity's hopes is that students
take better advantage of St IRE, the escort service
which is available seven days a week from 7 p.m. to
2 a.m. 1 lowevcr. concern has arisen regarding the
service's reliability.
According to senior Nathaniel Boswell, SURE
manager. "We have two carts running every night

provided there is no maintenance trouble." On .
lew occasions, however, SURE has been unable t>
provide the golf cart escort due to trouble with tlv
carts. In these instances, the service offers n wall
ing escort instead.
Boswell said that the service's efforts have beer
plagued by the carts not working. "They gel a lot <
wear and tear, and there has been a problem will
funding," he said.
In an effort to address this issue. Director of St u
dent Activities Nanci Howe says that the service,
plans to buy two new golf carts, including one thai
offers wheelchair access. While the SURE servicc
has the resources to pay for the standard cart, th
funding and availability of a cart with disability ;u
cess has proven to be more difficult.
Still, Howe hopes that the service will
have purchased both carts by the end

of the quarter.
Another problem which has ham
pered SURE has been abuse of the
service by some students, who use it
to simply get a ride across campus.
Boswell said, "SURE is an escort and
safety service, not a taxi service. If the

carts aren't working, it shouldn't mat
ter, because we will always provide an
escort of some sort."
Staffing has also been a difficulty
for SURE. The service generally has
three employees on staff each night:
two escorts and an operator.

Although the service is used most
by students on Friday and Saturday
nights, SURE has been unable to add
an extra worker on those nights. De
spite offering increased wages on
weekends, Boswell said, "People still
just don't want to work on a Friday or

Saturday night."
SURE has no plans to step up its
service in light of the Roble Field at
tack, and Howe does not see a need
to extend the hours of its service.
Howe hopes that the incident will
serve to increase awareness and use

of the service. She said, "The risk of
assault on campus exists 365 days a
year. Our responsibility is to provide
that service until 2 a.m. during the
academic year regardless of the inci
dent. We're concerned about elimi
nating the risk."
