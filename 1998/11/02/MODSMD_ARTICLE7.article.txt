# 21 Terman fellows named
## 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
Twenty-one young Stanford scientists have been sc
lected as the IWX-99 Frederick E. Terman Fellows,
triple the number chosen last year.
The Terman Fellowships will allow each assistant
professor selected to work with $ 1 (K).(H K) in unrestrict
ed funds annually for three years.
The purpose of the fellowships is to provide young
scientists with opportunities — such as establishing
their own laboratories and recruiting graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows — which they may not have
had otherwise due to increased competition in recent
years for federal grants.
"It's a big help in terms of getting things off the
ground," said recipient Karlene Cimprich, a molecular
pharmacology assistant professor. She wants to use the
nionev to study the mechanisms that underlie genome
instability in hopes of increasing the
understanding of the processes that
lead to cancer.
Asst. Biology Prof. David Acker
ly plans to apply his Terman award
to detailing the climatic niches of
plants to the flora of California and
later to Mexico. He said that the
guaranteed funding that comes from
the University over several years is
invaluable.
Another advantage of the fellow
ships is their flexibility, which gives
the recipients freedom to conduct
research without having to adhere to
strict guidelines.
The Terman Fellowships were
first awarded in 1994 when William
I lewlett and David Packard provid
ed $25 million to launch the pro
gram. I lewlett and Packard, both
alumni of the Electrical Engineering
Department, attributed their success
to I erman, University provost from
1955 to 1965. They endowed the fel
lowships as a tribute to him.
Junior faculty members in the sci
ence departments of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Engineering are eligible
for the fellowships annually, while

junior faculty in the Schools of Earth
Sciences and Medicine are eligible
for the awards on a rotating basis.
Members of these schcx)ls fill out ap
plications and are nominated for the
awards by their department chairs.
They are then selected by the deans
of their respective schools for the
award.
The remaining fellows, all assis
tant professors, for this year are,
from the School of Medicine, Pehr
Harbury of biochemistry and Jen
nifer Raymond of neurobiology.
From the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the fellows are
Hongjie Dai of chemistry, Judith
Frydman of biology, Kathyrn Moler
of applied physics, Gigliola Staffilani
of mathematics and Jeffrey A.
Willick of physics.
The fellows from the School of
Engineering are Diane Bailey and
Pamela Hinds of industrial engi
neering, Stacey Bent of chemical en
gineering, Christoph Bregler, Daw
son Engler, Armando Fox and
Daphne Koller of computer science,
J. Christian Gerdes and Juan Santia
go of mechanical engineering, Balaji
Prabhakar of electrical engineering,
Claire Tomlin of aeronautics and as
tronautics and Benjamin Van Roy of
engineering economic systems and
operations research.
