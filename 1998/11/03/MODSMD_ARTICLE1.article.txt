## Scholars criticize attack on 'constitutional order 
### Anuj Gupta 
In a bokl declaration against the movement to im
peach President Clinton, nine Stanford professors signed
their names to a list of more than 4(H) historians who took
out a full-page advertisement in last Friday's New York
limes under the banner "Historians in Defense of the
Constitution."
The advertisement contained a six-paragraph state
ment. which opened "we deplore the present drive to im
peach the President," stating that an impeachment would
"have the most serious implications for our constitutional
order."
Calling the theory behind the current impeachment ef
forts "unprecedented," the historians asserted, "The new
processes are extremely ominous for the future of our po
litical institutions. If carried forward, they will leave the
Presidency permanently disfigured and diminished, at the
mercy as never before of the caprices of any Congress."
One of the Stanford history professors signing the
statement. Jack Rakove, will also be involved with the im

peachment proceedings firsthand. He is traveling to
Washington next week to testify at a hearing of the Con
stitution Committee, a sub-committee of the House Judi
ciary Committee.
He explained his role at the hearings as "having to do
primarily with explaining the relationships between de
bates about impeachment with larger discussions about
the creation of the Presidency."
The advertisement was the brainchild of Sean Wilentz,
a historian at Princeton University, and Arthur
Sehlesinger. Jr., from the City University of New York.
Wilentz and Sehlesinger sent out e-mails early last week
to history professors around the country, including Stan
ford's George Fredrickson and Rakove.
Both Fredrickson and Rakove supported the adver
tisement. agreeing to add their names to it. They forward
ed the e-mail to other professors in the History Depart
ment.
Fredrickson explained his support for the document:
