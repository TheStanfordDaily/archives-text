## Scholars criticize attack on 'constitutional order 
### Anuj Gupta 
In a bokl declaration against the movement to im
peach President Clinton, nine Stanford professors signed
their names to a list of more than 4(H) historians who took
out a full-page advertisement in last Friday's New York
limes under the banner "Historians in Defense of the
Constitution."
The advertisement contained a six-paragraph state
ment. which opened "we deplore the present drive to im
peach the President," stating that an impeachment would
"have the most serious implications for our constitutional
order."
Calling the theory behind the current impeachment ef
forts "unprecedented," the historians asserted, "The new
processes are extremely ominous for the future of our po
litical institutions. If carried forward, they will leave the
Presidency permanently disfigured and diminished, at the
mercy as never before of the caprices of any Congress."
One of the Stanford history professors signing the
statement. Jack Rakove, will also be involved with the im

peachment proceedings firsthand. He is traveling to
Washington next week to testify at a hearing of the Con
stitution Committee, a sub-committee of the House Judi
ciary Committee.
He explained his role at the hearings as "having to do
primarily with explaining the relationships between de
bates about impeachment with larger discussions about
the creation of the Presidency."
The advertisement was the brainchild of Sean Wilentz,
a historian at Princeton University, and Arthur
Sehlesinger. Jr., from the City University of New York.
Wilentz and Sehlesinger sent out e-mails early last week
to history professors around the country, including Stan
ford's George Fredrickson and Rakove.
Both Fredrickson and Rakove supported the adver
tisement. agreeing to add their names to it. They forward
ed the e-mail to other professors in the History Depart
ment.
Fredrickson explained his support for the document:
"I agreed with it. I think that in the
perspective of history. President
Clinton has not committed an im
peachable offense. [The Constitu
tional standard) 'treason, bribery,
and high crimes and misdemeanors'
does not refer to what he did."
History Prof. David Kennedy,
who also signed the document,
added, "I've long thought that the
case for impeachment is so weak as
to constitute an abuse of the im
peachment process."
According to Rakove, the adver
tisement was funded partly by a pri
vate liberal foundation known as
People for the American Way and
partly by the professors listed in the
advertisement, who were requested
to make a monetary contribution.
The professors helped draft the
final statement. Several Stanford
professors found the first version of
the statement "too partisan," accord
ing to Rakove, who suggested
changes to the document.
Kennedy said, "1 was slightly un
comfortable with an early draft that I
saw. but 1 thought the final version
was appropriate and that it substan
tially reflected my views."
According to Fredrickson, the
final paragraph of the first draft
"urged people to vote a certain way
on Election Day," which many pro

les is felt was inappropriate.
In the final draft, the concluding
paragraph is neutral, urging citizens
to oppose the impeachment theory
"whether you are a Republican, a
Democrat, or an Independent."
The professors' statement has al
ready been criticized. In a column in
Sunday's Washington Post, com
mentator David Broder wrote that
when academics "plunge in heedless
ly" to "raging political debates," they
run the risk of looking "ridiculous."
Broder said he believes that the
decision of impeachment should be
left to the House and wrote, "This
tenured trashing of Congress for
meeting its responsibility says more
about the state of the history profes
sion than about the law of the land."
Rakove admitted that not all his
torians are comfortable offering
opinions on political issues: "Many
historians are somewhat nervous
about it. They may have felt it's im
proper to cross the line between
being a scholar of the past and taking
positions on current issues, and that's
a position I understand."
However, he said he believes that
the historians' strong statement on a
divisive issue is justified. He ex
plained the professors' position from
an academic standpoint. "When you
know something about the back
ground of an issue, you have an oblig
ation to try to explain it in the most
intelligent and articulate way you
can," he said.
