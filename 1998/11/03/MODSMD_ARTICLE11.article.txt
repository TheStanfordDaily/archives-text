# Special fee refund rates released
## 
### Virginia Yang 
Students who aren't happy with
where their special fee money goes
have had their chance to get it hack.
As of yesterday, the ASSIJ had
mailed out all of this quarter's spe
cial-fee refund checks.
This year, 3.64 percent of under
graduates and 8.82 percent of grad
uate students requested a complete
or partial refund of their special
fees.
A total of $8,789.69 was refunded
to undergraduates and $13,599.08
was refunded to graduate students.
The group which had the most re
quests for refunds from undergradu
ates was Masque, an art and litera
ture magazine focused on the Stan
ford lesbian / gay / bisexual commu
nity, with 3.43 percent of students re
questing a refund of the $0.88 in spe
cial fees. From graduates, the group
with the most special-fee refund re
quests was Club Sports, which had
8.45 percent of graduates refund
their $4.77 special fee.
Each year, student organizations
with funding requests above $6,000
can apply for an ASSIJ special fee. If
approved, the group's request is
placed on the ballot for the spring
general election.
II 15 percent of the student body
votes, and a majority of those who
voted support the organization, then
the ASSIJ grants money to that or
ganization out of a pool of money
supplied by a total fee that appears
on I Jniversity bills.
Students are entitled under the
ASSI J constitution to a refund of the
special fees. This quarter's ASSIJ
fees were $50 for undergraduate stu
dents and $26 for graduate students.
This is about the same as last year lor
undergraduates and represents a
slight increase for graduate students.
During last year's spring elec
tions, only one organization on the
ballot, the Undergraduate Weenie

Roast, did not receive funding.
The amount of funding the orga
nization receives from each student
varies each year depending on the
number of registered students, and
the amount of funding the organiza
tion requested.
This year, special-fee allotments
per student ranged from $0.28 for
Spoon Hunger Relief Network to
Club Sports' $4.28.
In order for students to receive to
refund of the special fees, they had to
fill out a request form available on
the ASSIJ Web page within the first
three weeks of fall quarter.
Matt Garlinghouse, financial
manager of the ASSIJ, who is in
charge of handling the refunds, com
ments that "these refunds have no
effect on the day-to-day operations
of the organizations since most of
them have a buffer for the refunds."
The "buffer" is an amount of
money student groups leave in their
budgets to allow for refunds.
To publicize the refund policy,
the ASSIJ takes out ads in The Stan
lord Daily and also through e-mail to
all the dormitories. However, many
students still have no idea what the
refund policy is.
Senior Anne Kari commented
that "I don't think I would go
through all the trouble of requesting
a refund of such a small amount of
money."
Lindsey Kinder, a senior and a
coordinator of Barrio Assistance,
one of the programs receiving spe
cial-fee funding, said that the pro
gram relies on special-fee funding
for its operational expenses.
She says that "it is important for
students to have the option of re
funding part or all of their special
fees, but I have never and would
never request a refund of my special
fees."
Barrio Assistance receives a
$1.35 special fee, and 2.72 percent of
undergraduates had it refunded.
