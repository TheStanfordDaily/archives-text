## Iraq blames U.S. for conflict 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP)—lraq
blamed the United States on Mon
day for forcing Baghdad to sever
contact with arms inspectors by
blocking any reference to lilting
sanctions in a review of Iraqi compli
ance with U.N. resolutions.
Nizar Hamdoon. Baghdad's
ambassador to the United Nations,
said Iraq still wants a "comprehen
sive review" that offers the prospect
that sanctions will be lifted or eased
it the Security Council finds Saddam
Hussein's government has eliminat
ed its weapons of mass destruction.
"I think the ball is in the Security
Council and the secretary-general's
court,"he said in an interview with
I he Associated Press and Dow
Jones Newswires.
President Clinton left open the
possibility of a military response to
Baghdad's announcement Saturday
that it was cutting off all dealings
with U.N. weapons inspectors. He
sent Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Monday to consult with
European and Persian Gulf allies,
saying "no options are off the table."
"Saddam Hussein's latest refusal
cooperate with the international
weapons inspectors is completely
unacceptable," Clinton said shortly
after meeting with Cohen and his
other top national security aides.
Richard Butler, the chief IJ.N.
arms inspector, called the decision
the "worst confrontation" by Iraq
with the United Nations since the
end of the IWI Gulf War. The sanc
tions were imposed shortly after
Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in IWO.
In Baghdad, Iraq's Parliament
unanimously endorsed the govern
ment's decision to halt the work of
U.N. arms inspectors, and Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz branded

the monitors as a "threat to Iraqi
security."
The comments by Iraqi officials
came as Security Council members
begin discussions on a draft resolu
tion that would reiterate, in a legally
binding document, the council's
demand that Iraq reverse its deci
sion.
The sticking point, council
sources said, would be whether the
council would simply repeat its state
ment Saturday that Iraq was in fla
grant violation of U.N. resolutions or
was in "material breach" of the reso
lutions— language that could give
the United States and its allies the
green light for military action.
The Security Council sent a letter
Friday to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan outlining the framework
of a "comprehensive review" of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolu
tions.
Hut the letter did not meet Iraq's
demand that a review should men
tion the possibility of lifting sanc
tions. And when Baghdad received
"the political message" that the
United States was responsible for
blocking any reference, it responded
by banning all dealings with IJ.N.
weapons inspectors, Hamdoon said.
The Iraqi ambassador called on
the secretary-general to become per
sonally involved in attempts to
resolve the crisis.
"The ball right now should be in
the secretary-general's court because
he is the man who has the trust of
Iraq, and he should be also the man
who has the trust of the Security
Council," Hamdoon said.
Annan played a key role in defus
ing the last major crisis with Iraq,
which flared in February when the
Iraqis refused to let inspectors enter

the Iraqi president's palaces and
other sensitive sites. Annan flew to
Baghdad and reached an agreement
with the Iraqis allowing inspections
to resume.
But Annan's spokesman Fred
Eekhard stressed that Annan would
follow the Security Council's instruc
tions in trying to resolve the current
crisis.
"It is primarily the council's
responsibility," he said. "He does
not see it as a matter of his credibili
ty"
Annan met Butler on Monday
and was told that technicians from
the U.N. Special Commission, which
is charged with eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, were
being allowed to maintain surveil
lance equipment.
"But this in no way constitutes an
adequate monitoring function, so
monitoring activities are effectively
blocked," Eekhard said.
Annan called Iraq's announce
ment that it was cutting off all deal
ings with U.N. weapons inspectors
"a total breach of Security Council
resolutions," and noted the council's
demand that Baghdad resume coop
eration immediately.
"1 think the council as a whole has
spoken very clearly and they are
going to remain engaged," Annan
said.
Meanwhile in New York, crude
prices fell Monday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as
traders anticipated that the latest
Iraqi standoff with the United
Nations was not likely to interrupt
oil How.
In the past, tensions between Iraq
and the United Nations have caused
oil prices to jump as traders worried
about tightened oil supplies.
