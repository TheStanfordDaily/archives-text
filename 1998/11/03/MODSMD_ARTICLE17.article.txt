HAILED AS THE most watched
election race in the country, the
California Senate race between
Democrat Barbara Boxer and Republican
Matt Fong is likely to end a close one.
Incumbent Boxer's narrow lead over
State Treasurer Fong in recent polls, how
ever, does not reflect the qualifications
that clearly put her ahead of her oppo
nents.
In the Senate, Boxer has supported ini
tiatives to protect abortion rights, the
environment and affirmative action. She
has also championed gun control and
signed a crime law that boosted Califor
nia's police force by 9,000.
Her approach has consistently been
one of preparation rather than reaction.
Fong may focus on the same issues, but his
solutions advocate programs that correct
the symptoms rather than the disease.
For instance, while both major candi
dates now support the death penalty,
Fong supports a blanket death penalty for
offenders of any age. He also seeks to
eliminate parole for violent offenders.
Keeping criminals in prison for a longer
time and executing juveniles does not
make up for the crimes that have already
been committed. Boxer excludes execut

ing juvenile offenders and seeks to reduce
crime through more committed police
action on the streets rather than solely in
prisons.
Boxer advocates improving the quality
of schools by limiting class size, setting
higher academic standards and funding
more after-school programs. Fong hopes
to improve schools through the use of
vouchers and the creation of more magnet
schools. However, vouchers leave poor
schools in their current state, ignoring the
need to provide immediate funding for
upgrades. Fong calls for increased spend
ing in one major area â€” the military.
Fong has some catchy ideas that will
appeal to voters. He calls for the replace
ment of the IRS with a flat tax. We believe
this will burden the middle class, which
will no longer get cherished tax breaks
such as mortgage-interest deductions.
This Senate race has not been without
unnecessary mud-slinging. Fong has
labeled Boxer a political extremist. Boxer
responded by calling him an out-of-touch
extremist. Fong has criticized Boxer's
"hypocritical" silence over the Clinton
scandal. Boxer has condemned his 1994
donation to the Traditional Values Coali
tion, which promoted a ban on same-sex
marriages.
Tension is high because the stakes are
high. Barbara Boxer, however, has proven
through her voting record that her inter
ests lie with the interests of all Californi
ans who seek a safer, cleaner and better
educated state.
