# Vote for Anna Eshoo
## 
### 
Democratic Congressional
candidate has experience,
effective policy ideas

IN lIIE RACE for U.S. Representa
tive in District 14, we endorse Anna
Eshoo over her three contenders. We
endorse Eshoo not because of her six-year
Congressional incumbency, but because
of her priorities.
One of Eshoo's goals is coordinating
education efforts among federal, state and
local governments. Eshoo's Republican
opponent, Chris Haugen, is co-founder
and vice principal of The King's Acade
my, a private Christian school in Moun
tain View. As an educator, Haugen also
considers education a top priority. He
believes schools should be run with mini
mal interference from state and federal
governments and cites his own school as
an example of the good work that strong
parental involvement can provide.
While a parental involvement model
may work in private schools and wealthy
areas, where well educated parents have
the time and money to commit to school
systems, parental involvement has little
chance of saving schools with crumbling
infrastructures. Eshoo's focus on keeping
schools integrated into a larger standards
and funding system could do more to help
struggling schools than leaving the burden

of reform to parents and teachers.
Eshoo and Haugen also agree that
Social Security money should he saved.
Hut they differ on the question of health
care. While Eshoo sees reforming man
aged care as a top priority, Haugen has no
stated position on how he would reform
health care, except that he opposes natio
nalization of the system. Eshoo is pro
choice and cites women's health as an area
that needs legislative attention, while
Haugen opposes federal funding for abor
tion and needle-exchange programs.
In the foreign policy arena, Eshoo
argues that we should continue to work
through trade with developing and indus
trialized nations and participate in multi
national groups to resolve conflicts. Hau
gen, in contrast, would like to see the
United States take unilateral action to
resolve conflicts, with every military
action aimed at a clear, defined objective.
Eshoo also views environmental issues
as a top priority; she has been endorsed by
the Sierra Club and has earned a 98 per
cent lifetime rating from the California
League of Conservation Voters.
We support Anna Eshoo because we
agree with her efforts to reform schools
and revamp health care. We also think a
multinational approach to foreign policy
is more likely to result in long-term con
flict resolution than unilateral action. We
hope that Eshoo will continue to vote to
protect the environment if re-elected
today.
