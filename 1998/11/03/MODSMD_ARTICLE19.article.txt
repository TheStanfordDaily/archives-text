## Getting to the heart of the matter 
### 
WELL, IT'S Elec
tion Tuesday, so
I thought it
appropriate to address an
issue threatening our
democracy. Over the past
four years there's been a
coup d'etat, although

incompetent, to oust our twice-elected pres
ident from office. These people didn't like
losing in the 1992 or 1996 elections; they are
somewhat reminiscent of the kid who
doesn't get his way and takes his ball home.
They would rather see Ozone Man at the
helm (God knows why, because that would
actually give Gore a chance to win in 2(XX)).
But for whatever reason, they want Clinton
out.
This cabal began its quest in earnest in
1994, prodding Paula Jones to file a sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. It
has since been continued by the fumbling
Linda Tripp, accidentally aided by the hap
less Monica Lewinsky and kicked home by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who is
about as independent as the y-axis.
First, we need to look at the Jones law
suit, which is the source of any "substantive"
claim against Clinton. Does the lawsuit have
merit? If not, then it certainly appears more
like an opportunity to embarrass the presi
dent than to redress a serious wrong. And
there are some reasons to believe that Clin
ton is innocent. For one, Paula couldn't
identify the "Whoop whoooop yee
haaawww!" presidential mating call. Then
there's the matter of a certain facial
appendage which I hesitate to discuss in its
post-mortem state.

Hut no one is really sure what happened
in that hotel room. So let's assume that
Jones is telling the truth; granted, she is the
only one who really "nose" what happened
(I'm guessing that Clinton, if lueky, has suc
eessfully repressed the alleged meeting).
And, in fact, this is exactly what the judge
did. The lawsuit was dismissed under sum
mary judgment: this means that the facts, as
alleged, were assumed to he true. Jones did
not show that she suffered a tangible job con
sequence as a result of rejecting Clinton's
alleged advance and also failed to prove the
formation of a hostile work environment
resulting from severe and pervasive miscon
duct. Thus, the case, judged by the standards
in effect at the time, was fruitless — it had no
place in a court of law. While a recent
Supreme Court decision that allows for cer
tain sexual harassment suits despite the
absence of a tangible job detriment may give
Jones' case more teeth, it still doesn't change
the fact that those bringing the lawsuit did so
knowing that doing so was legally wrong.
Legally wrong, but maybe politically
right. The lawsuit provided a chance to focus
on alleged sexual improprieties, and,
undoubtedly to the delight of Clinton's
accusers, an affair with a White House
intern. If anything, a consensual affair in the
Oval Office may, with a hit of imagination,
prove a pattern of misconduct. But remem
ber. the Jones lawsuit was not dismissed
because she couldn't prove her version of
the story — again, the judge said she
couldn't meet the standard definition of sex
ual harassment.
So the real question is this: Would the
issue have materialized had the question

been posed out of office? Was the presi
dent's behavior a pure abuse of power or
simply a "rational" response to an over
reaching. inappropriate probe into the realm
of his private life? Clinton was asked an
embarrassing question; as a private citizen,
he could have answered yes, but not as a
president.
So Clinton lies under oath, Starr calls foul
and now we're in the midst of impeachment
hearings. Granted, we're also in the midst of
an investigation of Starr's investigation, a
million-dollar payoff to Paula Jones for
finally leaving the country alone and, if
lucky, a Tripp indictment for violating
Maryland wiretap laws.
1 doubt that anyone actually condones
the President's behavior, but this misses the
even greater issue: We live in a democracy
where the person with the most votes wins.
Why has the country put up with manufac
tured attempts to remove our twice-elected
leader from office?
Some will say that legal definitions are
irrelevant; the president did wrong and
should be punished. What's more important,
though, is that under the accepted standards
of sexual harassment at the time the case
had no merit. Why. I wonder, was a case
without merit heavily funded? Why did a
claim of harassment surface three years after
the alleged incident, coincidentally in an
election year? The fact is that if we're a dog.
we've been wagged.

Dan Geyser apologizes to those looking for
his usual drivel, which should return next
week. He is a senior majoring in political sci
ence.
