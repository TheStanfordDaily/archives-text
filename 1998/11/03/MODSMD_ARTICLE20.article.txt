Athletics boost University
You know, I wish Audrey Leung would
eite some of her sources. Which athletes
committed acts of blatant criminality? And
though I'm sure not many members of the
offensive line will win Pulitzers, I'll need
more than Leung's "because I lived next
door to him" before I call on the adminis
tration to purge our university of these
sociopathie cretins.
It recently came to my attention that we
have several chess masters on campus. I'm
glad they picked Stanford. But I'm fine with
the fact that we give the football team,
which they could academically beat about
the head, financial aid while we give them
nothing. Fair or not, football brings in more
money. How much did Stanford benefit last
year, in terms of national profile and school
pride in addition to the bottom line, when
our basketball team made the Final Four?
The fact remains that if Stanford truly
did disregard academic standards, we
would have even more championships than
we do now. Do we hold athletes to the same
academic standard as the rest of the student
body? Not really. And why should we?
There's more to a person than his or her
CiPA or the amount of research he or she

gets published. If that's the only standard
the Admissions Office judged a prospective
student on, Stanford would be the Cornell
of the West.
I'm not sure I'd prefer pedantic whining
to the occasional kegger in the basement. I
know I'd prefer one less than brilliant ath
lete to 1(H) "normal" students who lack our
athletes' passion for success. At least in the
former case, we'd win Big Game.

Response missed the point
In no way did Brittney Jensen's column
on Oct. 28th dismiss the importance and
relevance of serious eating disorders. How
ever, Seth Weisburst's response to the piece
was both ignorant and insensitive.
It seemed quite obvious to me that Weis
burst considers himself expert an on the
topic of eating disorders. Perhaps his life
was at some time personally touched by the
epidemics of anorexia and /or bulimia.
What always surprises me, though, is the
vehemence and cruelty some people use in
spouting their litany of "you're insensitive."
I find it ironic that he showed so much
anger towards Brittney's opinions.

As it this weren't enough, Weisburst also
managed to show that he hadn't taken the
time to completely grasp what was said by
Brittney, or do any of the research that he
felt Daily columnists owe their readers.
Let me clarify, if I may. Men and women
suffering from bulimia, anorexia, bulimo
rexia. binge eating or compulsive overeat
ing do not ask their friends if they look fat.
1 hey do not show people their bulges and
thus, they are not the group Jensen was
referring to. Eating disorders are rooted in
control and attention issues. True sufferers
will not draw attention to what they are
doing to their bodies, for fear that someone
will try to intervene to stop them.
Jensen wrote about the many of us who
fish incessantly for affirmation and compli
ments about how we look. Even when we
get the ou look so thin!" it sounds emptv
because we will never know if it is genuine.
We will never be able to believe another
person s acceptance of our body until we've
accepted ourselves. Jensen's article touched
me, reminded me to love the gift I was
given â€” a healthy and strong body com
plete with muscles, bones and fat.
