## The 						rapid pace of medieval cathedrals

II WAS A gray Paris Sunday, the kind
when the rain comes down in sheets and
beats the Seine and everything around
it into a blurred, cloud-colored mass. Monet
in black and white. A Bogart movie with an
all-ballad soundtrack. And a perfect day to
visit Notre Dame de Paris, one of the most
colorful cathedrals in the world.
1 hat's what 1 thought, anyway, walking
from the subway stop to 12:30 p.m. mass,
my best slacks darkening with every falling
drop. Hundreds of tourists thought so, too;
when I arrived (10 minutes early), the
church was packed with damp bodies mov
ing among candle-lit shrines in a great cir
cular migration, cameras flashing, voices
murmuring.
1 he actual worship area was nearly
empty when I sat down in a wicker chair in
the back row and bowed my head to pray.
But concentration was difficult amidst the
buzz and the flashes, and I decided to wait

for a more quiet time during the service. It
never came.
Throughout the hymns, the sermon,
even communion, the crowd pressed
around the nave, cameras whirring, people
laughing and pointing. It was like worship
ping in a zoo. "Look. Harold, that man is
making the sign of the cross. (let a picture,
with that stained glass window in the back
ground, if you can. Kids, come over and see
this."
The service was about as holy as a trip to
the supermarket. And it underscored the
strange and intricate relationship that
Europe, a largely secular continent with a
wealth of religious history, has with its
cathedrals.
On one hand, cathedrals are often
viewed like museums. They house ornate
statues and stained glass windows and are
themselves architectural wonders. T heir
beauty appeals to people regardless of re I i -

gion. You don't have to be Catholic (I'm
not) or C hristian or even religious to enjoy
and appreciate them.
But unlike chateaux or art galleries,
cathedrals still support congregations who
gather to worship on a weekly basis. They
draw pilgrims along with sightseers, people
who pay 10 francs to light a candle next to a
statue of Mary and sit for hours in prayer
under the high arches. These people find
that in cathedrals, their paths to God are
somehow shorter or more direct.
In two months of touring more than my
share of European Gothic and
Romanesque masterpieces, I've come to
see myself as somewhere in the middle. I'm
wary of placing too much importance on
stone structures: I believe, after all, in a God
who professes not to dwell in houses made
by human hands.
At the same time. I can't accept the
notion that such grand structures built in the

name of God have lost all religious signifi
cance. The spiritual void 1 felt at Notre
Dame, while troubling, was not representa
tive of my European church experience. 1
have felt the presence of God here, in the
"minor" cathedrals of Paris and the French
countryside, when 1 walked in from the loud
street and the world simply fell away behind
the closing door.
There is an elusive peace to be found in
the simple chairs of those lavish interiors. It
comes from the sudden jolt of silence after a
day of city noise. It comes from the radiant
color of the rose windows, the ornamenta
tion of the altar and the simple assurance of
dozens of tiny flames lighting a woman cast
in marble. It comes from an awe of the
devotion that moved people to work life
times to construct these monuments to their
(iod.
It is this peace that makes cathedrals
holy to me â€” the peace that was missing on

that gray day in Notre Dame. My faith is
based on a personal relationship with God.
one that I find easier to cultivate away from
the distractions ol daily life. The unique
peace of those cathedrals offers one of the
greatest escapes from those distractions that
I have ever known.
And so I accept these great churches as
both secular and religious monuments,
places that tourists and people of faith can
all admire lor different reasons. It is not
always a perfect coexistence, but it is a nec
essary one. I lie next time I go to Notre
Dame, it will he with a camera. The next
time I go to mass, it will he at St. Jean-Bap
tiste de Belleville, just down the street from
my neighborhood fish market.
This time. I'll know what to expect.
