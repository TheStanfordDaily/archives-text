# Prospective RFs apply for slots
## 
### Amber Johnson 
Finding housing for next year
isn't on the mind of most under
graduates, given that Draw is still
months away. But as the resident
fellow application process begins,
faculty members, senior staff and
graduate students are vying for po
sitions in campus residences.
It will not be known until Janu
ary which slots will be vacant for
the 1999-2000 school year. Current
RFs are not required to declare
their intention to remain RFs until
that time. However, applicants
must apply now to express general
interest.
Resident fellows, in coordina
tion with resident assistants and
other campus resources, "promote
the intellectual tone of the resi
dences by sharing their teaching
and research interests, by involving
their faculty colleagues in resi
dence programs, by encouraging
discussion of important issues, and
by serving as mentors to students,"
according to the position descrip
tion.
"We hear of benefits expressed
by faculty in gaining insight into an
undergraduate's life at home," said
Jane Camarillo, director of Resi
dential Education.
And this position comes with an
added bonus — free housing.
As compensation for selecting
those thought-provoking summer
reading books, baking brownies
for finals and tackling everything
from homesickness to alcohol is
sues, the University provides every
RF with a tax-free apartment or
cottage adjacent to student resi
dences.
Thanks to the extraordinary
cost of living on the Peninsula, the
incentive of free room and board
makes the program competitive,
attracting especially lower-paid ju
nior faculty.
Review of applications, includ

ing a resume, essay questions and
references, will begin on Nov. 15
by the selection committee.
Interviews will be conducted by
Camarillo, along with an associate
director of Res Ed. a current RF,
an RA, a resident dean and other
Res Ed staff.
Camarillo and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs James Montoya
will offer positions in January to
those selected.
While the initial term of ap
pointment is two years, all appoint
ments are subject to yearly review
based on job performance and pro
grammatic need.
Homeless graduate students
will probably not find inexpensive
shelter in the RF program, howev
er.
With preference given to faculty
and teaching staff, graduate stu
dents find the competition particu
larly stiff.
" The goal behind preference for
faculty is that we want to take ad
vantage of our residential system
to bring faculty closer to students
in the informal setting of the resi
dence," Camarillo said.
Greg Farber, a returning RAin
Arroyo, cites the "significant age
difference between the RA and the
RF" as critical to the success of the
dormitory staff.
He also feels that parenting
skills are beneficial in being a suc
cessful RF.
'if you're a parent, you have
more experience picking up on
things and controlling things," Far
bersaid.
Dylan Stewart, the 12-year-old
son of the Arroyo RFs, prefers the
family arrangement for different
reasons.
'it's pretty cool because you gel
to meet lots of students, you get to
experience college when you're 12
years old, and it's a good resource
if you need help on homework," he
said.
