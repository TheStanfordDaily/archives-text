## Cardinal earns respect over weekend Women's soccer team gets conference wins at Washington, Washington State 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
Only two wins would satisfy the Cardinal,
a team hungry to be victorious after dropping
its last six games. Those wins, this past week
end, finally satiated Stanford's desire for re
spect within the Pacific 10 Conference.

WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ Friday: Stanford (9-6-2 overall, 3-4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) defeated Washington State (5-9-3,
3-3-1), 1-0 (OT).
■ Sunday: Stanford defeated Washingon (10-7-
1.6-2), 1-0.
The Stanford women's soccer team (9-6-2
overall, 3-4-0 Pac-10) returned to its presea
son winning ways with two key conference
victories against the Washington schools.

A disparity exists between the Cardinal's
impressive preseason record and its recent
dismal performance during conference com
petition. Stanford dropped only one game in
its first eight matches, however, until this past
weekend's success, the Cardinal attained
only one victory in five conference games.
On Sunday afternoon, Stanford complet
ed a sweep of the Washington schools, before
more than 1,000 spectators in Seattle, when it
upset the Huskies, 1-0.
Washington's (10-7-1.6-2) loss caused the
Huskies to fall from their prominence in the
Pac-10 standings and broke their six-game
winning streak.
Stanford's junior midfielder Ronnie Fair
scored the game's sole goal in the 59th
minute of plav off a 22-yard free kick. Fair's
shot caromed off the crossbar before landing
inside the Huskies' goal.
"We have been rather unlucky lately, but

today things worked out well for us," said
sophomore goalkeeper Carly Smolak.
Stanford outshot Washington 9-0 during
the half.
A scoring shot by Washington freshman
Caroline Put/, which officials nullified due to
an offside call, and a 12-yard shot, which
landed one foot wide of the Stanford goal, by
sophomore Tami Bennett comprised Wash
ington's only offensive threats of the game.
The Cardinal started the weekend with a
1-0 overtime win against the Washington
State Cougars (5-9-3, 3-3-1) on Friday,
demonstrating the aggressive playing style
characteristic of preseason games.
Stanford junior forward Kelly Adamson
scored the winning goal in the 99th minute of
play.
Stanford aimed to impose its style in the
first half of the game and outshot the
Cougars, 10-2. during this half.

"We had a burst of energy to play well this
weekend and definitely dominated the first
halt," said sophomore forward Christy
Arnold.
A scoreless second half failed to indicate
Stanford's continued domination of the
game.
Although the Cardinal outscored the
Cougars 10-5 in the second half and had six
corner kick opportunities, Stanford could
not capitalize.
Although the Cardinal has played five
overtime games this season, the game at
Washington State is the only overtime game
in which Stanford has emerged victorious.
Stanford's schedule includes only two re
maining regular-season games before the
start of the NCAA tournament.

ning the Pac-10 title are over, the
team remains confident in its quest
to attain one of the at-large bids
awarded by the NCAA tourna
ment selection committee to its
tournament.
"It's out of our hands, which is
kind of frustrating" Smolak said.
"If the committee selects us. then
we'll enter the playoffs with a clean
slate."
The two victories during the
weekend were critical in preserv
ing Stanford's postseason ambi
tions. however.
"Basically, it was down to the
wire," Smolak added.

"We had to win. If we lost, we
would be shooting ourselves in the
foot," Smolak said.
Because of its lackluster Pac-10
performance, the Cardinal will rely
on its preseason record, to obtain
the coveted NCAA tournament
bid.
During this time, Stanford had
four victories over top-25 ranked
teams.
In addition, Stanford must
emerge victorious in both of its re
maining home games to sustain
any chance of obtaining a tourna
ment bid.
"Basically, we want to end on a
good note and get into the tourna
ment," Arnold said.
