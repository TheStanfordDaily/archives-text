WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: Stanford defeated
Army, l )4-75.*
The Cardinal, which was playing
without lone senior Regan Freuen
and blue-chip freshman Lindsey
Yamasaki, both injured, overcame
its youth to dominate Army for most
of the second half.
"They [the Cardinal players]
were so excited out there," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "There
are so many young players, it got
wild."
Sophomore center Carolyn
Moos led the way for the team with
a dominating 25-point, nine-re
bound and two-block performance.
She was complemented in the post
by 6-foot-7 freshman forward Cori
Enghusen. who tallied a team-high
11 boards while also adding two
blocks.
Moos saw action in 21 games last

year, but never started and averaged
just over six minutes a game. After
spending much of the offseason in
the weight room working on in
creasing her strength, she had her
way in the paint throughout the
game.
"I'm excited for Carolyn." Van-
Derveer said. Since last year "she's
gained 30 pounds and 30 points of
confidence. She knows it's her turn
and she's going to take advantage of
it.
"I'm really happy with Cori. She
has a presence in there. When you
have Carolyn and Cori in there to
gether. that's pretty big."
The team, which has only three
players who have consistently seen
significant playing time in the past,
showed its inexperience early. Army
gathered 14 first-half steals as the
Cardinal turned the ball over 16
times in the opening period.
Despite the turnover-riddled
half, the Cardinal still went into in
termission with a 36-31 lead.
It then exploded early in the sec
ond hall for a 14-0 run and a 16-point
advantage. Sophomore forward
Karesa Granderson and freshman
guard Lauren St. Clair combined for
12 points during that key stretch.
