# Just a bit outside
## Bragging, bashing and phone calls, oh my

Brian Eule

Whenever Stanford plays
UCLA. I know what fol
lows. Either call or be called.
While the Cardinal's rivalry
with California is about pride, the
Axe, stealing mascots and vandal
ism. among other things. Stan
ford's rivalry with the Bruins
means only one thing to me. Brag
ging rights with those who remain
in my hometown of Los Angeles.
Immediately upon walking
into my room, after the Cardinal
lost to UCLA in football last year,
my phone rang. 1 dreaded picking
it up.
There were too many of my
high school classmates celebrating
the Bruin victory on the streets of
Westwood. There was the entire
athletic department where I had
spent many summer days wink
ing. There was my mother.
"Mom??" I said. "Why are you
calling?"
I heard a vicious laugh
"Oh. just wondering how the
game went," she responded.

My own mother. A die-hard
Bruin fan who could not resist the
temptation.
Where I grew up, there were
the L.A. fans who loved the Bru
ins and hated I JS(and then there
were the losers. My family chose
the former.
We cheered on J.J. Stokes and
the football team and we Hocked
to see Ed O'Bannon. Tyus Edney
and the IWS NCAA Champion
basketball team. UCLA was the
standard by which all others were
judged.
Hut as I grew older. I realized I
was a bit different.
(We are talking abend in terms
of being a die-hard Brain /<///,
nothing else, so cut out the wise
cracks!)
I began to notice new and ex
citing things â€” a very bouncy tree
with wobblv eyes, a band that
looked like it was having far more
fun than any formal marching
band and a women's basketball
program that actually attract'd
more than three fans.
(OK, so UC I.A women \s hoops
is big now, but things were a bit dif
ferent back then.)
Now. don't get me wrong. It is
possible to cheer tor the Bruins as
long as they are playing another
university (especially when they
play Cal), but when it comes down
to the Stanford-UCLA games. I
bleed a Cardinal red.

My mother, on the other hand,
that's something else. She refuses
to convert when it comes to foot
ball and basketball. With one child
on the Farm, and one a recent
graduate from UCLA, it is no
wonder she feels torn.
And while there is little doubt
she loves Stanford to death, this
past Saturday she made the mis
take of sitting in the Bruin section
of the Rose Bowl.
Along with her on that side of
the field were all the friends who
had made far too many phone
calls last week, before the game
even took place. There were too
many friends of mine, it seemed,
who needed to rub in the fact that
t heir school was number two in the
nation and ours, well, urn, wasn't.
1 knew it would come back to
haunt them on this 1 lalloween.
When the ('ardinal jumped out
to a 7-0 lead early in the first quar
ter. 1 was ecstatic. When it was still
leading late in the fourth quarter, I
reached for the phone.
The band. I heard, was even
more jubilant.
Its members were posing for
pictures at the request of some of
UCLA's musicians, including
those whosnuck into the Cardinal
section to join Stanford in a tune
or two. A chant of "overrated"
slowly, but surely, filled the sec
tion.
And then came a UCLA
touchdown. And then. Stanford's
fumble in the end /one. And then,
the sack. Oh, I felt the pain.
As Stanford's quarterback
Todd I lusak went tumbling down
on that final play of the game, so
went my hopes of bragging to all of
those who had called, e-mailed,
written, signed, telegraphed,
faxed, semaphored and sent
smoke signals about how the Bru
ins would crush my not-so-mighty
Cardinal.
Yet. there was a certain satis
faction in throwing the undcleat
ed Bruins off course. UCLA had
entered the game overlooking
Stanford, and the Cardinal had
caught it by surprise.
1 have a hunch that Stanford's
band had the same feeling of satis
faction.
As the Bruins left the field,
gasping for breath after having
more than their share of a I lal
loween scare, a new chant arose
from the Stanford section of the
Hose Bowl.
"We beat the spread. We beat
the spread."

Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly columns appear every
Tuesday, would like to remind each
and every Brian fan of the Maples
Massacre. ()h, and if you think you
are t'oing to be able to make one
phone call up here during basket
hall season to do some bragging,
think again.
