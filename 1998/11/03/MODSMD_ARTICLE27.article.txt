# Westbrook speaks on fencing, racism, poverty
## Biracial Olympic fencing medalist rose out of ghetto, now helps others find a way out 
### Joanna Corman 
As a child. Peter Westbrook
watched Zorro, the swashbuckling
Latino superhero, avenge his foes
on TV. On the streets, Westbrook
couldn't tight his battles with a
sword. He never pictured himself
wielding a blade like the masked
avenger for sport, let alone for
medals. Hut fencing saved him.
Through fencing, he gained insight
and love enough to give back to the
kids who have taken his place in a
continuous cycle of racism.
Westbrook, 46, spoke recently
at the Stanford Bookstore about
his fencing career and his lifelong
struggles depicted in his book,
"I larnessing Anger: The Way of an
American Fencer," as part of the
Program in African and Afro-
Ameriean Studies' fall lecture se
ries.
"Fencing saved my life," said
Westbrook. "It touched and saved
my life."
With his friends heading to jail
and dying all around him, and with
the support his single mother and
mentors along the way. Westbrook
fenced his way out of the ghetto,
winning 13 U.S. National Men's

sabre fencing championships, a
bronze medal at the 1984 Los An
geles Olympics and three gold
medals in the Pan American
Games.
His life, he said, was full of strug
gles. His mother left her abusive
husband, raising two kids on her
own. He missed his father, who
moved to Florida without a good
bye note when Westbrook was 14.
Most recently he buried his mother,
who was murdered three years ago.
"Struggle is beautiful," West
brook said. "Struggle builds char
acter. Struggle builds depth of per
sonality. Hut I didn't know that."
It was his Japanese mother, who
came from a line of Samurai war
riors, who introduced him to fenc
ing, trying to win him away from
gangs in the Newark. N.J. housing
project he grew up in. She knew of
the mental discipline, agility and
speed fencing requires. She knew
fencing would open his world. She
gave him $5 for one lesson.
"I told my mother, 'Are you
crazy?' " But he took the money
and fell in love with the sport that
opened a gate out of the ghetto.
"I often think about the kids
from mv neighborhood, how they

never had a chance," he wrote. "I
would say that 90 percent are dead.
8 percent are in jail and I have no
idea what happened to the remain
ing 2 percent."
It's unusual — and was even
more so in the fifties — for a black
kid to compete in a predominately
white sport.
Hut he stuck with it. despite the
racism. It was the anger, he said,
that fueled his desire to excel.
The anger came, in part, from
discrimination Wcstbrook encoun
tered in the projects as well as in the
fencing world. He faced constant
taunts from neighborhood kids
about his biraeial heritage. It was
hard living with a mother who
didn't look like anyone else in his
world, said Wcstbrook, whose fa
ther is African-American.
"You can imagine living with a
Japanese mother in the projects in
Newark. N.J.," he said. "It's kind of
tough. I didn't feel good that my
mother didn't look like everyone
else. "
Westbrook's mother would
mend his shoes with cardboard. I le
asked the audience how long card
board would last.
"A dav," someone ventured.

"Try three to four hours and
your feet are touching the ground."
he said. "I felt ashamed of myself."
When he fenced, Westbrook felt
good.
"People were telling me I had
potential." he said. "A lot of poten
tial. things about myself I wasn't
used to hearing. I started feeling I
was somebody."
Soon, Westbrook was winning
state championships. New York
University offered him a full fenc
ing scholarship. He took it.
Westbrook is a sabre fencer,
akin to "modern dance," he said.
It's "more freestyle" and faster
than foil or epee fencing. In sabre
fencing, opponents can only strike
above the waist cutting with the
blade or jabbing with the point.
Epee and foil is more like ballet
and points are scored only with the
tip on any part of the body.
While fencing is a predominate
ly white sport, Westbrook is chang
ing that. In 1991, he started a foun
dation to support a fencing pro
gram for inner city children in New
York City.
When he started the Westbrook
Foundation, people didn't think
black children would fence. ""Black

kids fencing,"' they asked him.
"'Are you crazy?'"
But he proved them wrong. He
started out with six children, and
now over 1.0(H) children have gone
through the program.
"You have to give back," West
brook said. "If you have been given
a lot in life, then you have to give a
lot more."
"We teach mostly black inner
city kids a sport traditionally prac
ticed by elite members of society,"
he wrote.
"I want to teach these kids life
skills, how to win. and how to lose,
deal with stress and control their
emotions."
Every Saturday from September
to June, SO to 100 children study
fencing under the caring and exact
ing auspices of their instructor.
They also get help with school work
through the tutoring and mentor
ship programs.
These kids are into "drugs,
credit card scams, everything," said
Westbrook. "They stop that and
become real good kids." They also
win. competing in the national ju
nior and senior fencing champi
onships.
"God is sending me some super

stars." he said.
To 12-year-old Caddie Heddle
son, who has participated in the
Stanford fencing camp for three
years, hearing Westbrook talk was
inspiring.
"It was inspiring that even
though he was poor as a child, he
was able to rise up and do so well in
a sport that is not really common,"
she said.
To Lisa Milgram, assistant
coach of Stanford's women's fenc
ing team, it meant a lot to hear
Westbrook. someone who has
done so much for the sport.
"He's kind of the zenith of giv
ing back." she said.
Elbert Mitchell and his wife
Dorothy of East Palo Alto came to
the talk for a different reason. El
bert Mitchell, a retired cartograph
er, is black and his wife is Japanese.
They came to learn about West
brook's biracial background and
perhaps bring some wisdom to
their grandchildren who grapple
with their multiracial identity.
"He uses [his story] as a vehicle
to help youngsters rather than ex
ploit them." Mitchell said. "I like
his philosophy of using sports as a
reason to make a whole person."

state championships. New York
University offered him a full fenc
ing scholarship. He took it.
Westbrook is a sabre fencer,
akin to "modern dance," he said.
It's "more freestyle" and faster
than foil or epee fencing. In sabre
fencing, opponents can only strike
above the waist cutting with the
blade or jabbing with the point.
Epee and foil is more like ballet
and points are scored only with the
tip on any part of the body.
While fencing is a predominate
ly white sport, Westbrook is chang
ing that. In 1991, he started a foun
dation to support a fencing pro
gram for inner city children in New
York City.
When he started the Westbrook
Foundation, people didn't think
black children would fence. ""Black

kids fencing,"' they asked him.
"'Are you crazy?'"
But he proved them wrong. He
started out with six children, and
now over 1.0(H) children have gone
through the program.
"You have to give back," West
brook said. "If you have been given
a lot in life, then you have to give a
lot more."
"We teach mostly black inner
city kids a sport traditionally prac
ticed by elite members of society,"
he wrote.
"I want to teach these kids life
skills, how to win. and how to lose,
deal with stress and control their
emotions."
Every Saturday from September
to June, SO to 100 children study
fencing under the caring and exact
ing auspices of their instructor.
They also get help with school work
through the tutoring and mentor
ship programs.
These kids are into "drugs,
credit card scams, everything," said
Westbrook. "They stop that and
become real good kids." They also
win. competing in the national ju
nior and senior fencing champi
onships.
"God is sending me some super

stars." he said.
To 12-year-old Caddie Heddle
son, who has participated in the
Stanford fencing camp for three
years, hearing Westbrook talk was
inspiring.
"It was inspiring that even
though he was poor as a child, he
was able to rise up and do so well in
a sport that is not really common,"
she said.
To Lisa Milgram, assistant
coach of Stanford's women's fenc
ing team, it meant a lot to hear
Westbrook. someone who has
done so much for the sport.
"He's kind of the zenith of giv
ing back." she said.
Elbert Mitchell and his wife
Dorothy of East Palo Alto came to
the talk for a different reason. El
bert Mitchell, a retired cartograph
er, is black and his wife is Japanese.
They came to learn about West
brook's biracial background and
perhaps bring some wisdom to
their grandchildren who grapple
with their multiracial identity.
"He uses [his story] as a vehicle
to help youngsters rather than ex
ploit them." Mitchell said. "I like
his philosophy of using sports as a
reason to make a whole person."
