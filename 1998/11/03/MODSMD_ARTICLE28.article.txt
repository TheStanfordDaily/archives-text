# Magma plumes formed Africa, say researchers

Although Geophysics Prof.
Norman Sleep has never been to
Africa, his new single-plume
magma model may shed light on
the formation of geographical fea
tures in north and central Africa.
Sleep, along with Cindy
Ebinger, a lecturer in geophysics at
the University of Leeds in the
United Kingdom, recently pub
lished their findings in the Oct. 22
issue of the scientific journal "Na
ture."
According to a general magma
model, huge plumes of hot rock
rise to just below the Earth's sur
face to form hot spots. The hot
rock eventually melts into lava,
which builds up and periodically
rises and punctures the Earth's
upper crust.
Although the hot spot may not
move, the movement of the earth's
floating tectonic plates results in
varying locations of the resultant
volcanic activity.
Sleep drew an analogy between
the model's explanation of plumes
and the heating of a thick soup.
"When you heat thick soup in a
pan, blobs of thick soup from the
bottom come up. which are hotter
than the surrounding soup," he
said.
Despite this discovery, scien

lists continue to be divided over
the accuracy of the theory that
giant magma plumes have played a
large role in determining the
earth's landscape.
Even Sleep initially expressed
doubts regarding the theory. "I
originally rejected the idea of
plumes. It became evident, howev
er. that the lateral flow of plume
material could explain a lot that
had bothered me," he said.
Sleep says that there is a group
of scientists who "would agree
plumes shaped Hawaii, but per
haps not Africa."
Currently, the most convincing
evidence for the plume theory is
the volcanic nature of the forma
tion of the 1 lawaiian island chain.
Other critics of the theory argue
that several small plumes, instead
of one giant plume, could also ex
plain the spectrum of African geo
logical features.
Sleep finds this possibility un
likely.
"Convection from below usual
ly has upwellings spaced compara
bly to the depth [of the heated ma
terial]," he said. "Many closely
spaced upwellings typically do not
occur."
Sleep and Ebinger are planning
to extend their plume model be
yond its current two dimensions to
further test its accuracy.
