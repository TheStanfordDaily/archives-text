tie. This poll result contrasted with
one released by the Field Institute on
Friday that showed Boxer with a
nine-point lead over Fong.

"These are surprising results, consid

of Stanford's campus. We're glad
that people are thinking about the
candidates and expressing their
choices on a ballot. Hopefully, stu

political enthusiasm on Tuesday."
The candidate on the GOP ticket
has been endorsed by Stanford Col
lege Republicans. Ryan Parks, co
chair dI the organization said. "The
Stanford College Republicans en
dorse Matt Fong because he's for less
government in people's everyday
lives. This includes his support of
lower taxes, balanced environmen

talism, and a social security system
that would allow individuals to invest
their own money themselves."
Among his accomplishments as
State Treasurer, Fong states that he
saved C 'alifornians $24<) million hy in
creasing efficiency at the office, put
$4<) million in loans to encourage
banks to loan money to small busi
nesses, helped California college stu
dents continue their education
through tax-exempt financing, sold
$3.76 billion in bonds to build more
schools and "revitalized inner cities"
with $3 million in enterprise bonds.
Fong and Boxer differ sharply on
many of the central issues of the elec
tion,
Fong's priorities in education are
ensuring that "Every child graduat
ing from high school can read, write
and speak English fluently." I le be
lieves the federal government's role is
to encourage "more rigorous acade
mic study."
Fong also supports lowering the
capital gains tax because of his belief
that it "hinders small to midsize busi
nesses and cripples the entrepreneur
ial spirit."
On the question of Social Security
and its possible reform, Fong
wants to protect Social Security for
"today's recipients." He also sup
ports allowing individuals to invest
some of their retirement funds for
themselves.
Fong notes Boxer's "F" grade
from the non-partisan National Tax
paver's Union. He personally be
lieves the tax code should simpler.
According to Project Vote Smart,
Fong is in favor of legal abortion
within the first trimester, and in cases
of rape and incest thereafter. He op
poses partial-birth abortion, public
funding for abortions or organiza
tions that counsel about abortions,
and supports parental consent laws.
I le opposes the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance reform bill.
Fong calls Boxer an environmen
tal extremist. His points out Boxer's

on offshore oil drilling and protecting
the redwood forest.
He supports reforming the En
dangered Species Act, and "will fight
to ensure that any California
landowner deprived of his or her land
because of this act be justly compen
sated."
Fong argues that Barbara Boxer's
positions undermine the American
military, keeping U.S. forces "unpre
pared, under-supplied and under
trained." He points to his experience
in the U.S. Air Force Academy and
five years active duty. He states that
the major threats to American
"strength" are "dangerous rogue na
tions."
Fong supports strong penalties
against using firearms while commit
ting a crime.
Another Stanford College Re
publican, junior Brian Karimzad.said
of the candidate, "Fong is an outsider
we can trust, far removed from the
troubles that have embroiled all par
ties in the Beltway. He supports the
fiscal policies necessary to foster
growth in a world of escalating eco
nomic troubles."
