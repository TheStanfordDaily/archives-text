# No rest for the weary
## No. 5 Stanford hosts Fresno St. tonight 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
As if the weekend trip to Wash
ington was not long enough for the
Stanford women's volleyball team,
heavy fog on Sunday night post
poned the team's flight, and it did
not return home until late yester
day afternoon.
Hut there is no down time, as
the Cardinal (19-2 overall, 13-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) has to turn
right around and face the Fresno
State Bulldogs (15-5 overall)
tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavil
ion.

■ Tonight: No. 5 Stanford (19-2
overall, 13-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
vs Fresno State (15-5 overall), 7
p.m.. Maples Pavilion. RADIO:

Fresno State could certainly
make the match longer than Stan
ford coach Don Shaw would like
for his tired players, especially if
Stanford is unable to clear its head
and leave the fogginess in Wash
ington.
Fortunately, the forecast for
tonight inside Maples is clear.
And even if the match does
drag, the Cardinal proved over the
weekend that it is capable of scrap
ping and finding a way to win any
game.
" The play was sloppy on both
sides of the net," Shaw said. "Nei
ther of the Washington schools are
real good ball control teams, and I
think they kind of dragged us into
that kind of match. Luckily we
were able to play well enough to
win.
"There were a couple games
that I had no idea we had a chance
to win," Shaw said, referring to
game one of the Washington
match and the second game
against Washington State.

"We hung in there and got
steadier throughout those games,
whieh was niee to see," he added.
Friday night's match was the
first time in several weeks that
Stanford brought a fully healthy
lineup to the floor, as junior out
side hitter Jaimi Gregory returned
from a knee injury and provided
great hack-row play.
"Having Jaimi back in there
was really nice," Shaw said. "She
made some big digs against Wash
ington, and helped us out defen
sively."
On the whole, the Stanford
passing game and service-receive
improves dramatically with Gre
gory in the lineup, making it much
easier to set up an effective offen
sive attack.
On the subject of offensive set
ting, sophomore Lindsay Kagawa
came in for regular setter Robyn
Lewis in both of the weekend's
matches and provided an invalu
able lift.
"I felt good about the way Lind
say performed," Shaw said.
"Robyn's knees were bothering
her, and she was struggling a little
bit. Lindsay did a good job coming
in and sparking us. She picked us
up and changed the pace and pat
tern of our offense."
Overall, Shaw was pleased with
his team's ability to combat lack
luster play and emerge with a pair
of three-game sweeps.
"We moved the ball around
pretty well and caused some prob
lems with our solid service game,"
Shaw said. "It wasn't a great week
end. but we blocked fairly well and
had good statistics defensively."
With little time to prepare for
Fresno State, Stanford will have to
count on its superior talent and
flexibility to deal with a strong
Bulldog squad.
"I don't know much about
them, except that they are 15-5 and
have played some matches against

pretty strong teams," Shaw said.
"We just have to get out there and
be ready to play. The most impor
tant thing is for us to take eare of
things on our side of the net and we
will he fine.
"Lindv Vivas, their eoaeh. used
to he at Washington, and I have
known her for a long time, back to
when she was a player," Shaw
added.
"She is a tough, defensive
minded coach. So I am sure they
will he aggressive on defense, and

we have to be ready to counter
that," he said.
After tonight's match, the Car
dinal will have some time away
from competition for the first time
in what seems like an eternity.
With just a single-game series at
California next Friday, Stanford
will have a light weekend.
"It seems like we have been
gone for a week," Shaw said. "It
will be nice to get through
[tonight's] match and have some
time at home."
