# Getting off the track
## '96 Grad takes the long route past investment banking 
### Martin Yeung 
I ended my Stanford experience
much the same way I had started
it, not knowing what the future
had in store for me. As I stepped
up to claim my diploma last June, I
desperately pondered what lay
ahead for a jobless Stanford gradu
ate and what 1 had done wrong to
not be among the ones ascending
the ladder to corporate nirvana.
It seemed an utter travesty, that
having gone through the motions
of getting decent grades and
padding my resume with the req
uisite internships and activities
that I, of all people, had no job at
graduation.
It was not for lack of trying. In
the mad dash senior economics
majors endure that is winter quar
ter interviewing, I must have
racked up enough frequent flyer
miles to send me to Mars and
taken enough time out to make my
classmates wonder it I hadn't start
ed working already.
No, for some odd reason I
became the Stanford version of
Svsiphus, except instead ot pushing
a rock up a hill forever, I was con
demned to go on endless rounds of
interviews without ever landing a
job.
So it must have been fate, or a
sheer act of desperation, that I
decided to run away from my
troubles. I sold my car and used
the monev to fly to New York and
share apartment in the East Village
of Manhattan.
I arrived in possibly the worst
time to hunt for a job. Most com
panies had finished recruiting for
the year. That meant I was stuck
knocking on doors of alums, going
to agencies, essentially I was meat
for the grinder hoping to find
something that someone decided
not to take.

There were a lot of rejections, a
bunch of false leads... hey, wasn't
this supposedly one of the best job
markets in decades? I finally did
land a job at a major bank only to
have the offer rescinded because I
wanted an extra week to decide.
1 hesitated because another
bank was dangling an even better
prospect in front of me. That fell
through too. It felt like I was dat
ing scumbag boyfriends who
wanted me on retainer just in case
their first choice at a partv got too
drunk to do the deed.
With cash running low and the
utterlv unacceptable final solution
of going home to South Dakota to
live with my parents looming, a
turning point was reached in my
life. It turned out that my new
roommate's old roommate was
forming a technology start-up with
his best friend.
In my mind it was an accept
able alternative; I was paid a pit
tance and irregularly, but at least it
was cool and hip, va? And for the
first few weeks it was.
But soon the glamour of meet
ing with potential backers and dis
cussing concepts gave way to the
actual drudgerv and misery of
maintaining a start-up once it
starts up. "Baptism bv fire," as my
new business partner called it.
The foray into the world of a
technology start-up was a far cry
from the investment-banking ana
lyst's cube I thought I was going to
occupy. Instead of calling up tech
support and going for coffee every
time the programs or equipment
failed, I had to painstakingly go
through lines of code or haggle
relentlessly with suppliers for
assistance.
Instead of sleek offices and a
personal assistant, I was the CCX)
/ office gopher who sat on a com
puter box for three months

because we couldn't get the money
to buy me a chair. I think even heat
was a luxurv at times. And instead
of that cute flat in Soho 1 dreamed
of, I ended up with a sofa in a
threadbare apartment that housed
the company's personnel â€”
myself and the two founding part
ners.
Summer turned to fall and then
into the winter of my discontent.
With each passing day 1 felt more
and more like the peon I was in a
lonesome corner of the world. The
funny thing was that several of my
friends who had gone into invest
ment banking felt the same way,
but at least they were being well
compensated for it. 1 learned more
about T-l lines and how to sweet
talk-creditors threatening to shut us
down to give us just one more
extension.
But that's not the point of why
I'm telling you what happened in
past year and a half after Stanford.
To sum up how I managed to keep
my sanity, I quit the start-up and
went on the interview circuit while
holding down a bunch of odd jobs,
mostly manual labor such as mov
ing furniture and also doing book
keeping for local businesses.
It wasn't as bad as I thought, in
fact, it humbled me to learn how to
change the oil in a car and put in a
long day's labor with someone
who barely graduated high school.
So what if I graduated Stanford? If
I couldn't work with or get along
with people and learn from them, I
was screwed. And 1 found out that
they have lives too, something that
I never knew about or found out
about while I was at school.
Most of all, 1 wanted to say that
the world is not as scary as you
would think, that life outside the
Stanford bubble is a lot different
because things don't matter too
much if you're not happy. The

attrition rate for investment
bankers is awful, and most of mv
friends who've managed to stay in
it are just counting down the days
until they're off to grad school or
doing something else.
But perhaps the greatest, most
important thing of all was realiz
ing that the Stanford dream hadn't
failed me, but that 1 had failed it
but morphing into the lemming
that we so eloquently said we were
not in our applications. Figuring
that out restored my faith that the
admissions committee didn't just
pick my file randomly out of the
stack.
1 looked deep within. I found
new friends in what everyone
derided as a cultural backwater. 1
found out 1 could survive without
handouts from my parents. And
perhaps the most surprising thing
was that I found it within myself
that even while 1 was flat broke, I
somehow scrounged up the
money to fly to England in the
dead of winter to profess my love
for one of the most beautiful and
special people 1 know.
Unfortunately, my affections were
rebuffed (oh yeah, my life was
going great that year).
And I learned to let go of thai
bizarre dream that becoming an
investment banker was the end all
to be all, that it was the only logical
point of progression from
Stanford.
You see, in the end, I landed at a
research and consulting firm in
Washington, D.C. that pays less,
but 1 wouldn't trade the people I
work with and the experience I'm
getting to toil in M&A at Goldman
or Morgan Stanley.
Perhaps that is what 1 am most
grateful for, that I found out my
idea of nirvana was a chimera
before I was totally and utterly
engulfed by it.
