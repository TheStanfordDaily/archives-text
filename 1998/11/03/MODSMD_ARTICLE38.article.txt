"What are you going to do when you gradu
ate?"
This question haunted me for months as my
graduation from UC-San Diego approached.
Everyone — my parents, professors, friends —
was asking me what my plans were. It seemed mv
entire life up to that point had been reduced to
"what are you going to do when you graduate?"
This wouldn't have been so bad if I had even the
remotest idea what my post-graduation plans were.
But as a sociology major, there was no directly relat
ed job to slide into. The doors were wide open and
having been in school almost my whole life, the
absence of that kind of structure was unsettling.
So I spent one last blissful summer in San
Diego and gentlv tried to wean myself from col
lege life and prepare for whatever 1 was going to
do next.
I knew I wanted to go to grad school, but 1 felt
that I needed some practical experience first, so
when summer was over, I started looking for a job.
1 wanted something flexible that would allow me
to travel, but I also wanted something that I'd gain
meaningful knowledge from. I needed something
new. Something that would expand mv hori/ons.
So 1 started scanning the classifieds religiously,
calling job hotlines and calling companies. I was
looking for my dream job, but was getting few
responses and was becoming somewhat desper
ate. Not long after, I got my first interview.
Post-college job #1: Telemarketing. Mated it. I
still don't know what I was thinking when I took
this position. I'd always thought that telemarket
ing must be one of the most heinous jobs on the
planet, but I think I was going through a phase
where 1 felt 1 might gain some wisdom by doing
things I didn't like. Anyway, it paid well and the
hours were flexible, so I forced myself to stay for
two months until, finally, 1 couldn't take it any

more and quit. I remember telling my boss (who
was also the owner of the company) that the job
just wasn't for me, and she said, "Julie, you've got
a lot of soul-searching to do." (Why? Because I
didn't want to waste away in that hole day after
day??)
The search continued.
Post-college job #2: Free-lance writing for a
newsletter. This was more my speed and along the
lines of what 1 wanted to do. In fact, 1 really loved it.
but they only needed one article a month from me,
so I figured I'd better find something to supplement
this.
So, in spite of getting grief from my parents, I
started waitressing, as I'd done through college. It
was the only thing that would give me the flexi
bility I wanted and as long as 1 was also doing
something else, I could justify it.
Between these two jobs, I still had time on my
hands, so I kept an eye out for additional oppor
tunities.
Post-college job (sort of) #3: Marketing intern
ship at a non-profit organization. My project was
to create a press kit, and I had to do a lot of inter
viewing and writing. I had a lot of independence
in terms of how 1 wanted to structure the project
and felt satisfied with my work.
When my internship ended, a friend and I
backpacked through Europe. This was by far one
of the best experiences of my life — we saw
ama/ing sights, met incredible people, and had
phenomenal experiences, but most importantly, I
had plenty of time to think about what I really
wanted to do.
I traveled some more after returning from that
trip, but I knew the time would come when I'd
eventually have to commit to something full-time.
I think I put it off for so long because I felt a lot of
pressure, as if the career decision I made would
dictate the rest of my life. I waited as long as pos
sible, but when my coverage on mv parents' health
insurance ran out, I knew I had to take the plunge.

Post-college job #4: Full-time marketing assis
tant. 1 originally took this job because it was very
close to home, paid well and had great benefits.
But it turned out to be a gold mine. 1 had a lot of
autonomy, got deeply involved in a lot of projects
and worked with incredibly dynamic people. 1 was
eventually put in charge of producing the compa
ny's weekly internal newsletter, which involved
writing, editing and desktop publishing.
Less than a year later, I felt like I'd exhausted
what I could learn in that position, so I started
examining other options.
In trying to make some sense of niv work
related experiences, I thought about two intern
ships I had in college, one in advertising and one
in broadcast journalism at the local NBC affiliate
1 also considered my undergraduate research —
as a sociology major, I had the opportunity to do
several independent research projects which
involved a great deal of intensive interviewing.
These experiences combined with the writing and
desktop publishing I'd been involved with for the
past few years geared me towards journalism.
But because 1 had little formal experience in
the field, I decided I wanted to go to grad school
and develop a strong foundation. I began
researching schools, studying for the GRE and
working on applications.
Now I'm here at Stanford in the journalism
master's program.
The point of all this blather is that it can take a
long time and a lot of trial and error to tigure out
what you want to do. Yes, there are the chosen few
who seem to have known all their lives what their
destined field would be, but that's more the excep
tion than the rule. It's highly unlikely that your fate
will depend on any single choice, so if you're not
sure what vou want to do, trv as many things as
possible — the experiences you hate will tell you
just as much as the experiences vou love. And if
you pav attention, eventually you'll end up in the
right place.
