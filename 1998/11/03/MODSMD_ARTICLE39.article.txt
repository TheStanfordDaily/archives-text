### Jim Luh 
You have 93.5 square inches that
must simultaneously serve as an auto
biography. a sales pitch and a writing
sample. You have to adhere to a com
mon format, but you also have to
express your creativity.
Writing ;i resume is intimidating.
Alter all. together with your cover let
ter. your resume will play a large part
in answering the paramount question
of your post-Stanford existence
known in business circles as the
Mckinsey-MeDonalds toss-up.
"Your resume and your cover let
ter—that is your first contact, your
first impression," said Veda Jeffries, a
career counselor at the Career
Development ( enter. "That is what is
going to get you your first interview."
You can still have an impressive
resume even if you haven't had much
formal work experience. Jeffries said.
"Students have a tendency to leave
out really important things because
they feel 'Oh. tliis is not really impor
tant." or 'This is not really a status kind
of position." or 'This is not really a pro
fessional kind of thing'." she said.
Before preparing a resume.
Jeffries said, you should make a list of
all your employment, academic or
extracurricular activities, no matter
how irrelevant they may seem.
Some of these may unexpectedly
turn out to be extremely marketable
resume items.
Ciroup projects often show team
work skills, and work in extracurricu
lar organizations can show leadership
skills: overseas experience can show
independence.
Perhaps the most important part of
writing a resume is finding maintaining
coherent organization and presenting
information in a manner that is both
visually appealing and easy to follow.
For most students just leaving
school. Jeffries said, a chronological
format — that is. listing qualifications
in order, with the most recent first
is better than a functional format —
grouping qualifications into different
skill areas.

"Usually, a person with a 112 unction
al resume has been out in the job
market for a while." she said.
As you list your qualifications, take
advantage of boldface type, capitaliza
tion. bullets and white space to sepa
rate and highlight different elements
and ideas. Keep the writing style clear
and concise and use vivid active verbs.
Including some details about your
experience can certainly help, but it is
more important to ensure that your
resume gets your main qualifications
across quickly and effectively.
Your resume should be laser-print
ed on high-quality resume paper in an
easy-to-read font. An increasing num
ber of companies are now scanning
resumes electronically, according to
Jeffries.
As electronic scanning grows
more widespread. Jeffries said,
resume writers should be more war\
of using graphical elements, unusual
symbols, dingbats, horizontal rules
and italicized or underlined text
elements that may snarl equipment.
Jeffries recommends that most job
seekers keep their resumes down to a
page or less for most purposes.
However. Ph.D. graduates' resumes
might spill over on to a second page,
she said.
("ertain things should not be placed
on a resume. Jeffries said. She recom
mends leaving out irrelevant charac
teristics such as age. sex or religion.
"You don't want to show any kind
of inference that could cause some
kind of discrimination." she explained.
Placing a statement of your
employment objective near the topol
a resume is optional. Jeffries said.
Jeffries also recommends leaving
references off a resume. Hie names
of specific co-workers or supervisors
should be omitted unless they are
nationally recognized figures.
Above all. you should make your
resume an accurate representation of
yourself, one that you are comfort
able and familiar with because when
all is said and done, it's you who has to
go to the job every day. And your
resume — it's just a niece of paper.
