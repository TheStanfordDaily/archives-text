### Jim Luh 
You have 93.5 square inches that
must simultaneously serve as an auto
biography. a sales pitch and a writing
sample. You have to adhere to a com
mon format, but you also have to
express your creativity.
Writing ;i resume is intimidating.
Alter all. together with your cover let
ter. your resume will play a large part
in answering the paramount question
of your post-Stanford existence
known in business circles as the
Mckinsey-MeDonalds toss-up.
"Your resume and your cover let
ter—that is your first contact, your
first impression," said Veda Jeffries, a
career counselor at the Career
Development ( enter. "That is what is
going to get you your first interview."
You can still have an impressive
resume even if you haven't had much
formal work experience. Jeffries said.
"Students have a tendency to leave
out really important things because
they feel 'Oh. tliis is not really impor
tant." or 'This is not really a status kind
of position." or 'This is not really a pro
fessional kind of thing'." she said.
Before preparing a resume.
Jeffries said, you should make a list of
all your employment, academic or
extracurricular activities, no matter
how irrelevant they may seem.
Some of these may unexpectedly
turn out to be extremely marketable
resume items.
Ciroup projects often show team
work skills, and work in extracurricu
lar organizations can show leadership
skills: overseas experience can show
independence.
Perhaps the most important part of
writing a resume is finding maintaining
coherent organization and presenting
information in a manner that is both
visually appealing and easy to follow.
For most students just leaving
school. Jeffries said, a chronological
format — that is. listing qualifications
in order, with the most recent first
is better than a functional format —
grouping qualifications into different
skill areas.
