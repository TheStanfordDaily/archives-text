# Students and faculty report to Medical Fac Sen
## Medical school facilities labeled as 'antiquated' 
### Beth Robinowitz 
Stanford Medical School is facing
serious facilities problems, accord
ing to three presentations given by
faculty and students at the Oct. 28
Medical Faculty Senate meeting.
According to the presenters, the
recent report by the Liaison Com
mittee for Medical Education,
which reviews medical schools for
their accreditation, criticized the
Medical School for problems with
the infrastructure and facilities in
the library and classrooms. The re
port also attacked the school for fail
ing to make a serious effort to cor

rect such deficits, even though the
last three LCME surveys, the first in
the early 1980s. cite similar prob
lems.
Michael Ennen and Jean Drouin,
two Medical School students, gave
the first presentation, followed bv
Ted Shortliffe. professor of medi
cine, and Thomas Rindfleisch, di
rector of the Lane Medical Library.
Comparing the Medical School
with other schools and using the ob
servations of students, faculty and
consultants, the presentations col
lectively argued the negative impact
of the Medical School's inadequate
facilities on both the quality of edu

cation and its ability to recruit stu
dents. All three presentations
placed the highest priority on ame
liorating the dreadful condition of
Lane Library.
"Educational facilities are anti
quated. primitive and unbecoming
of a school of Stanford's historical
reputation ... (Medical School] of
ferings are no longer competitive
with leading schools," Ennen said.
