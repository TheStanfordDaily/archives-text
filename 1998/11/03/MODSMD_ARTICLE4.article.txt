# Students and faculty report to Medical Fac Sen
## Medical school facilities labeled as 'antiquated' 
### Beth Robinowitz 
Stanford Medical School is facing
serious facilities problems, accord
ing to three presentations given by
faculty and students at the Oct. 28
Medical Faculty Senate meeting.
According to the presenters, the
recent report by the Liaison Com
mittee for Medical Education,
which reviews medical schools for
their accreditation, criticized the
Medical School for problems with
the infrastructure and facilities in
the library and classrooms. The re
port also attacked the school for fail
ing to make a serious effort to cor

rect such deficits, even though the
last three LCME surveys, the first in
the early 1980s. cite similar prob
lems.
Michael Ennen and Jean Drouin,
two Medical School students, gave
the first presentation, followed bv
Ted Shortliffe. professor of medi
cine, and Thomas Rindfleisch, di
rector of the Lane Medical Library.
Comparing the Medical School
with other schools and using the ob
servations of students, faculty and
consultants, the presentations col
lectively argued the negative impact
of the Medical School's inadequate
facilities on both the quality of edu

cation and its ability to recruit stu
dents. All three presentations
placed the highest priority on ame
liorating the dreadful condition of
Lane Library.
"Educational facilities are anti
quated. primitive and unbecoming
of a school of Stanford's historical
reputation ... (Medical School] of
ferings are no longer competitive
with leading schools," Ennen said.
Citing Washington University's
new medical school. Harvard Med
ical School's brand-new student
center and Yale Medical School's
new library, Drouin said that "all of
our major competitors have made
significant investment in medical ed
ucation facilities, and you see that
when you go on the interviewing cir
cuit."
Rindfleisch emphasized what he
called the school's historical lack of
response to repeated student and
staff complaints.
"We have been 20 years at this
business of trying to figure out how
to make the education and library fa
cilities at Stanford better. It has clear
effects in terms of recruiting and hin
ders the delivery of services. Hut
there has been no response from the
school," Rindfleisch said.
Major improvements needed
Ennen and Drouin contended
that an integrated medical school fa
cility should include an inspiring li
brary, biomedical informatics, con
sumer-driven student services and a
modern teaching infrastructure.
To achieve this they stressed the
need for the integration of student
services, the renovation of class
rooms and labs, construction of sem
inar rooms for group-based learning,
the expansion of computers and in
formation technology and the cre

ation of a student social space.
"From the students' perspective,
you know, we sort of feel that maybe
it's time that rather than just having
two hallways in the corner of a med
ical complex, that we have an actual
proper medical school," Drouin said.
Rindfleisch described the
abysmal library conditions: "No stu
dent group space. Our staff are sit
ting literally in each other's laps
Networking and computing infra
structure is an embarrassment
No bathrooms and air conditioning.
For some people, that's important.
Leaks from facilities upstairs."
Rindfleisch mentioned that sev
eral students have said, "I would
complain about Lane not being open
24 hours a day it I could stand to be
there."
l ed Shortliffe spoke on behalf of
the ( lassroom and Library ('ommit
tee, composed of faculty, staff and
students, which he chairs. Shortliffe
cited the committee's most recent
report, which calls for the doubling
of the si/e of Lane Library. The re
port suggests either the creation of a
new library or major renovation of
the existing site to include improved
space for personal study, small
group study areas, bathrooms and
air-conditioning.
Options presented
Ennen and Drouin presented five

options, ranging from a very modest,
partial renovation of the library to
option five, which builds a complete
ly new medical education facility, lo
cated perhaps across from the Gates
Computer Science Building.
They mentioned that they under
stand the University's monetary and
spatial constraints, however, they
feel that improving the Medical
School facilities should be a top pri
ority. The two proposed that half of
the tuition taken in by the school
over the next 10 years, around $60
million, be used to cover the cost of
option five.
Ennen said, "If we ask for an in
vestment of one-half of 10 years* tu
ition. we're not saying that we want
to break the bank."
Option five requires approxi
mately 152,(XX) square feet. Ennen
addressed the issue of the general
use permit, the allowable building
square footage in Santa ( lara Coun
ty. "At the moment, there's 4(X),(XX)
square feet left in the current [per
mit]. If the University is completely
opposed to us having any ol those
square feet, well, then there s a new
one signed in 2(X)1. That gives us the
option of construction over the next
three years. (In) 2(X)4. the door is
open." he said.
Current facilities improvement
An enthusiastic Phyllis Gardner,

senior associate dean for education,
spoke after the presentations, giving
hope to the presenters.
Recently, permission has been
given to begin upgrading several
Medical School teaching facilities,
including Munzer Auditorium, and
parts of the Alway Building includ
ing all of the MUX) series lecture
halls and the Fleischmann Labs, to
make them all capable of video cap
ture and transmission. The goal is to
have full capacity for recording for
continuing education and distance
based learning.
Twoso-person classrooms will be
set up in the new Center for Clinical
Sciences Research.
Also, Gardner said student ser
vices — advising, admissions and fi
nancial aid — are being moved to
the Edwards Building.
According to the presenters, al
though upgrading the classrooms
and reorganizing the student ser
vices is a step in the right direction,
the Medical School has a consider
able way to go, especially in regard
to Lane Library.
The current plans, which do far
less than the least significant of the
options proposed by the presenta
tions, will only give 8,000 more
square feet to Lane.
That space will be gained by mov
ing the dean's office to Edwards and
converting the former office into
small interactive classrooms.
