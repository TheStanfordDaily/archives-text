# The
						CDC: more than just job listings
## 
### Adam Kemezis 
You're almost done with your
degree. In a lew short months
you'll have the piece of paper,
and you've already got most of
the knowledge and experience.
However, as every senior knows,
knowledge plus experience plus
piece ol paper does not automat
ically turn into a job.
lis up to you to cast the spell
that turns an education into a
career, hut a lot of the basic
ingredients that help you with
that spell can be found at the
Career Development Center,
until recently known as the
Career Planning and Placement
('enter.
According to the center's direc
tor. Robert Thirsk. the function of
the center is "to provide under
graduates and graduate students
and alumni with services and
resources to assist them with their

lifelong career development."
These services include a lot
more than just job listings,
numerous though those listings
are. Also to be found at the cen
ter are counseling services, work
shops on everything from intern
ships in Washington. D.C. to jobs
on the Internet and a library of
books geared to the job search in
every field.
The center also runs an on
campus interviewing service pro
viding prospective graduates with
a chance to interview with visiting
companies, as well as career fairs
and other special events.
Students can also place
resumes in the center's database
and open a file for reference let
ters. as well as visiting the center's
Web site, which contains a great
deal of information about specific
job opportunities as well as links
to potential employers and other
employment sites on the Internet.

All of these are supposed to be
tools for job seekers who are
ready to sieze the initiative them
selves.
According to Thirsk. the name
change was motivated by a desire
to emphasize "development,"
which to him is an "active, dynam
ic process that students take
responsibility for themselves." as
opposed to the more passive sense
of students being found places.
Given a student who's pre
pared to be proactive, said
Thirsk. the center can provide
resources, help clarify goals and
provide opportunities to meet
employers and to establish net
works with alumni.
Based on a recent survey of
graduates, Thirsk estimated that
at least 85 percent of undergrad
uates will participate in CDC
activities of some kind while they
are at Stanford, at least to the
extent of attending a career fair

or workshop. He also estimated
that between 65 percent and 70
percent of students will at some
time use the more in-depth
resources.
In a typical year, the CDC's
on-campus recruiting service will
arrange more than 1 (),()()() inter
views with about 400 employers.
A little over half of these will tvp
ically be in technical fields. These
interviews will involve about
1.700 students, and the center
estimates that one-fifth of them
will find jobs as a direct result.
Given these numbers. Thirsk
emphasized that the center can
help you no matter what kind of
a job you want.
He cited a "perception prob
lem" about job opportunities for
graduates, namely that invest
ment banking and management
consulting are the best and most
heavily emphasized career paths
after Stanford.
According to Thirsk. the cen
ter contains resources for every
career field and "we don't cater
to any particular one."
He noted Stanford's "rich
background and history of public
service." and noted that the pub
lic service is an area in which the
CDC is very well positioned to
help job seekers, including
through co-operation with the
Haas Center for Public Service.
Thrisk said he thought the
over-emphasis on banking and
consulting was due to the high
profile those recruiters are able to
maintain through recruiting
events and advertising.
Typically, said Thirsk. the kind
of organizations that hire liberal
arts students and others interest
ed in public service don't recruit
on Stanford's campus or on cam
puses in general, but. he noted,
the CDC can do a lot to bring you
to those employers.
