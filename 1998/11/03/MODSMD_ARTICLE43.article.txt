# ‘So tell me about yourself...’
## Interviews don't always follow the right script. Sometimes it's more like a comedy of errors. 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
Being nestled in the academic comfort of
Stanford protects many from the troubles of
the notorious and mythic "real world."
However, there comes a time when the
enchantment ends and students must venture
out into a forest of job interviews, prospective
employers and chaos.
Sometimes the path through the forest is
clear. Other times, there are hobgoblins that
pose a barrier to the occupational success stu
dents expect to achieve upon graduation.
The job interview hobgoblins are particu
larly fascinating. Because job interviews
involve people, not to mention their foibles,
expect to be surprised. The most common
word that comes up about a unusual job inter
view is "stunned." as the interview takes an
unexpected and sometimes unwelcome turn.
Shain Strnod, Class of '85. encountered an
interview where the "top technical person" at
a company gave her "a quasi-IQ test, akin to
a set of Zen koans."
"1 was so stunned and self-conscious, that I
didn't perform too well." Strnod said. "In one
case, he gave me a piece of blank paper and
asked me to create some perfect three-dimen
sional geometric figure simply by folding! I
couldn't do it, and so he impressed me by
doing it himself."
According to Strnod, the interviewer also
asked questions such as. "Why are manhole
covers round?" and "Why is the sky blue?"
Strnod later learned from his girlfriend that
manhole covers are round because, she said, if
"they were rectangular or square, the covers
could be rotated 45 degrees, and turned up on

edge, where they could fall through the rec
tangular or square hole remember the
Pythagorean theorem?"
Barring any demands to replicate the proof
for Fermat's Last Theorem or to perform a
series of cartwheels across I lie office carpet,
surprise questions should not he too daunting.
Of course, the one piece of advice all intervie
wees are given by their friends and advisors is
to "know yourself and who you are."
Dan Colman. who received a doctorate, in
modern European history in 1997 before turn
ing to the corporate world, knew who he
was... even when a prospective employer
highly recommended he forget.
"I contacted the head of a research divi
sion in an investment bank." Colman said.
At the interview, "lie explained why he
wouldn't hire someone with a I'll.I) — salary
expectations too high, not enough experience,
bored too easily... I then asked him what
advice he could give me. His suggestion: 'take
your Ph.D. off the resume.' "
Colman kept his Ph.D. where it was and
happily went on to a desired position at a
small consulting firm.
Adventurers in the forest of the "real
world" are reminded that all is not what it
seems when it comes to job interviews.
Rebecca Strait graduated in 1997 with a
master's in biology. She had three interviews
with a San Francisco ecological consulting
firm, including two extensive visits to their
offices in Southern California.
The vice president, who had been conduct
ing the interviews, said several times that the
third visit — an on-the-job interview — was a
final confirmation of what Strait already
knew: they would make her an offer before

she left.
Strait said, "'1 was sent home with no offer
and told that 1 would be called with it. In the
meantime, I took the VP at his word and
turned down my one other firm job offer, as
that position looked less appealing than the
one I was sure to be offered any day."
Unfortunately for Strait, several days went
by before the company finally called, only to
tell her they had decided to look for someone
with more experience.
"Never assume you have an offer until you
can hold it in your hand," she warned.
Although some interview mishaps may
leave the job-seeker feeling unfairly treated,
some others reflect basic personality differ
ences between interviewer and interviewee.
Julie Lynthcott-llaims. Class of '89. was a
first-year law student when she was inter
viewing for a summer public interest legal
job. During an interview for a prison assis
tance program, the interviewer asked a ques
tion designed to get a sense of her personali
ty. She responded with "some declaratory
statements about my bubbly, service-oriented
personality."
Maims, however, was not satisfied that her
response was truly insightful and proceeded
to depict an analogy for her interviewer:
"If I were a bus driver. I would say a
friendly hello' to everyone, help people who
were lost, and wait for people running to
catch the bus."
According to Haims, "The interviewer sat
stunned. I stammered. It turns out they didn't
want a bus driver, they wanted a lawyer, and I
didn't get the job. Hie moral? Sometimes cre
ativity can leave them thinking you're a
wacko."
