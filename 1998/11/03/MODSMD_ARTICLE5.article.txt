# Elect an actor to the presidency?
## Student says 'Vote Harrison Ford" 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
As voters go to the ballots today, many may wonder whether elected
politics is really anything more than a large-scale popularity contest. Is
winning about who looks the best in televised political debates? Who has
the most charisma? Who knows the most voters?
Sophomore Dan Hsia wonders how much popularity affects a candi
date's likelihood to win as well. And it was in that spirit that he created a
"Harrison Ford for President" Web page.
"There are two things that I have a passion for and that I don't study:
politics and movies," Hsia said. "This was a good way to combine them."
The page is a candidate parody with fake press releases and commen
tary speculating on Ford's likelihood to run for and win the presidency.
"The idea for it came in a government class I took in high school," Hsia
said. "We were talking about the possibility of a candidate's success based
purely on popularity."
Although the class was dis
cussing likelihood of Colin Powell
as a successful presidential candi
date, Hsia began to think of other
famous and well liked public figures
who would make good candidates.
And Ford came to mind.
"Everyone seems to like Harri
son Ford . .. he has a very broad ap
peal," I Isia said.
Hsia created the first parts of the
page several years ago, but he
didn't add much new information
to the page until this summer. It was
then that he decided that the idea
was amusing to enough people that
he should continue to update the
site.
I he Web page, which contains
numerous disclaimers about the
truth ol the information contained
on it. is a parody of the political sys
tem. I Isia. who is a self-proclaimed
liberal, found candidate parodies
on the Web urging all sorts of peo
ple to run for office, including Mr.
Burns from"The Simpsons."
l he similarities between Hsia's
joke and this year's real-life story of
Vermont resident lied l uttle are
striking. I utile, who began Ins cam
paign after starring in an indepen
dent film in which he ran for Con
gress. defeated his opponent in
Vermont's (i( )P primary, and then
promptly handed his support to in
cumbent Democratic Sen. Patrick
Leahy.
I Isia pointed out that the Amer
ican public has also elected an actor
president. I le joked that ford could
do a better job than Ronald Reagan
did.
I he Web page claims: "What the

country lacks, and has been lacking
for the past few administrations, is a
person toward whom Americans
can look for courage, leadership,
and integrity. Ladies and gentle
men. I believe it would be nearly
impossible to dispute that the right
person for the job is I larrison Ford.
I le has repeatedly demonstrated
his charisma and leadership ability
to the American public, and he can
continue to do so. But the question
remains: Will he run?"
I Isia tries to update the site peri
odically so that people who visit the
site will have something new to read
and laugh about. He has received a
number of responses about the idea
of Ford as president.
"I've gotten some feedback from
people, and some people just don't
have any idea that I'm joking," 1 Isia
said.
In the upcoming months, as can
didates begin to declare their inten
tions to run for the presidency,
Hsia plans to have a press release
on the page declaring Ford's inten
tion to run. He also plans to run
opinion polls on who likely vice
presidential running mates would
be. Someone who responded to
I Isia's site has suggested "wookie."
This is perhaps a reference to
( hewbacca. the charismatic wook
ie of few words but many grunts
who co-starred in all three "Star
Wars" films.
()f course, a disclaimer to the de
claration will be attached.
" I he last thing that I want is a
lawsuit on my hands," I Isia said.
Hsia said that although Ford
tries to distance himself from parti
san politics, he does seem to have
some political leanings. Ford, along
with his wife, Melissa Matheson,
has been especially active in the

promotion of the Tibetan Freedom
movement.
"Ford sees his role in popular
culture as an entertainer, not as
someone to stand on a soapbox,"
I Isia said. "But at the same time, he
seems to have some political lean
ings in the movies that he has made
and the causes that he cares about."

l Although Hsia is not an official
member of any Harrison Ford fan
r club, he did say that Ford is his fa
s voi ite actor. According to 112 Isia, of
ficial Web pages dedicated to Ford
have picked up on his page and cre
ated links to his site. The site ad
dress is www.stanford.edu/
