# Elect an actor to the presidency?
## Student says 'Vote Harrison Ford" 
### Lauren Phillips Editorial staff 
As voters go to the ballots today, many may wonder whether elected
politics is really anything more than a large-scale popularity contest. Is
winning about who looks the best in televised political debates? Who has
the most charisma? Who knows the most voters?
Sophomore Dan Hsia wonders how much popularity affects a candi
date's likelihood to win as well. And it was in that spirit that he created a
"Harrison Ford for President" Web page.
"There are two things that I have a passion for and that I don't study:
politics and movies," Hsia said. "This was a good way to combine them."
The page is a candidate parody with fake press releases and commen
tary speculating on Ford's likelihood to run for and win the presidency.
"The idea for it came in a government class I took in high school," Hsia
said. "We were talking about the possibility of a candidate's success based
purely on popularity."
