# Textbook maker sued for unfair pricing
## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Book publishers, including
many university presses, are com
ing under lire for charging college
bookstores more than other retail
ers for the same books.
Last year the National Associa
tion of College Stores, a non-profit
trade association with over 3,(KK)
member stores — including Stan
ford Bookstore — filed a lawsuit
against three publishers: Addison
Wesley Longman, Oxford Univer
sity Press and Cambridge Universi
ty Press.
At issue was the way publishers
sell their books to retailers. Publish
ers of specialized, academic books
often use a two-tiered discount sys
tem based on the quantity ordered
by a retailer.
College bookstores that order
texts in great quantity, usually for
classroom use, receive one dis

count. while other, less specialized
retail outlets are often eligible to re
ceive a higher discount for buying
the same book in fewer quantities.
According to John Zotz, deputy
director of finance and operations
for the nonprofit Stanford Univer
sity Press, university bookstores
have built-in customers for special
ized books because they are re
quired for courses.
For other bookstores, Zotz said
"there is no guarantee that [a spe
cialized) book will 5e11... the high
er discount is to offset risk."
"It's not fair." said Peggy
Mendelson, president of the Stan
ford Bookstore, calling the dispute
a "major issue." The Bookstore is
also run on a nonprofit basis
Only the litigation against the
Cambridge University Press is still
pending. The other two publishers
have agreed to modify their meth
ods ol discounting books and set
tled out of court.

Cambridge, one of the largest
university presses in the world,
maintains an office on campus in
exchange for distributing books
from Stanford University Press and

other arrangements.

lawsuit.
Zotz emphasized that the Stan
lord Press maintains its own pricing
system and is not directly affected
by the lawsuit. Hut Zotz did say
Stanford Press was reviewing its
discount policies in response to the
lawsuit. The Press does currently
offer the two-tiered discount sys
tem.
"We look forward to a simplified
price system," he said, adding that
he expected a decision to be soon
on the issue.
Zotz said that, in general, college
bookstores normally receive a 20
percent discount off list price, while

I he ( hronicle of 1 ligher Education
reported that other retailers may
receive a discount as high as 45 per
cent.
Although the Stanford Hook
store does have a large general-in
terest book section, Mendelson ex
plained that the store was unable to
buy large quantities of specialized
books for its general section.
The presses typically allow a
store to purchase only a few copies
of a given book it it wants to qualify
for the larger discount.
"We can sell 10 in our store
We were told, 'That's too many,'
[ The bookbuyer] would have to
order four. It kept us from selling
the books we wanted on our trade
floor," Mendelson said.
She said that the store would

continue to carry a wide variety of
academic books, despite the lower
profit margin that would likely re
sult.
She noted that many publishers
have already eliminated the two
tiered discount policy, and called it
"a matter of time" before Cam
bridge relented.
Zotz warned students, saying,
"no discount policy change has ever
resulted in a discount price for con
sumers."
Mendelson agreed, saying "It
won't change the price of text
books."
She did express concern about
the effect the ruling would have on
the finances of academic presses,
most of which are nonprofit.
"1 think its going to hurt faculty

and graduate students," she specu
lated. explaining that fewer outlets
for books would likely mean a
smaller press run and a higher cost
per book.
"We don't even break even,"
said Zotz. "We barely survive as an
entity."
The Press does receive a subsidy
from the University, but is working
to become self-sufficient, said Zotz.
Nevertheless, he remained opti
mistic that the final outcome of the
situation would be good for both
publishers and booksellers. Jerry
Huchs, director of public relations
for the college stores association,
said that the group will look at the
settlements to date and decide in
December what action should be
taken.
