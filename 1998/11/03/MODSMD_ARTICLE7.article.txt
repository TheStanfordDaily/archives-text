# Textbook maker sued for unfair pricing

Book publishers, including
many university presses, are com
ing under lire for charging college
bookstores more than other retail
ers for the same books.
Last year the National Associa
tion of College Stores, a non-profit
trade association with over 3,(KK)
member stores — including Stan
ford Bookstore — filed a lawsuit
against three publishers: Addison
Wesley Longman, Oxford Univer
sity Press and Cambridge Universi
ty Press.
At issue was the way publishers
sell their books to retailers. Publish
ers of specialized, academic books
often use a two-tiered discount sys
tem based on the quantity ordered
by a retailer.
College bookstores that order
texts in great quantity, usually for
classroom use, receive one dis

count. while other, less specialized
retail outlets are often eligible to re
ceive a higher discount for buying
the same book in fewer quantities.
According to John Zotz, deputy
director of finance and operations
for the nonprofit Stanford Univer
sity Press, university bookstores
have built-in customers for special
ized books because they are re
quired for courses.
For other bookstores, Zotz said
"there is no guarantee that [a spe
cialized) book will 5e11... the high
er discount is to offset risk."
"It's not fair." said Peggy
Mendelson, president of the Stan
ford Bookstore, calling the dispute
a "major issue." The Bookstore is
also run on a nonprofit basis
Only the litigation against the
Cambridge University Press is still
pending. The other two publishers
have agreed to modify their meth
ods ol discounting books and set
tled out of court.

Cambridge, one of the largest
university presses in the world,
maintains an office on campus in
exchange for distributing books
from Stanford University Press and

other arrangements.
Alan Harvey, manager of the of
fice, declined to comment on the

Cambridge University Press, which co-operates with Stanford's
press, is involved in a dispute over its pricing schemes.
