# Phone problems hit over weekend
## 
### Hasan McGee 
Stanford's conncction to the out
side world was limited more than
usual this weekend when on-campus
locations were unable to receive in
coming telephone calls.
Every Stanford phone number
was probably affected at some point
during the weekend.
According to Assistant Director
of Communication Services Mau
reen Trimm, the problem was first re
ported on Friday morning when Sys
tem Control received complaints of

callers being unable to get through to
campus phones.
Despite Pacific Bell's attempt to
fix the problem on Friday afternoon,
it got worse on Saturday, until il was
finally resolved Saturday afternoon.
Callers affected by the problem
heard a "fast busy" tone, or got a Pa
cific Bell message saying all circuits
were busy.
"When calling later, the callers
were able to get through to the Stan
ford telephone they wanted to
reach." said Trimm.
The problem,Trimm said, was iso

lated to Pacific Bell lines carrying in
bound calls to Stanford. Pacific Bell
representatives were unavailable.
The problem affected Stanford and
other businesses in the Palo Alio
area, but not local residences.
According to Trimm. the problem
may be due to a switch upgrade by
Pacific Bell on Wednesday
" Telephone switches are basically
large computers, and like all comput
ers. need to have their software up
graded on a regular basis." Trimm
said. "This is usually transparent to
callers due to redundancy in the svs

tem. In this ease, Pacific Bell reset
some of the settings.. .and did not re
alize they had a problem until callers
started [complaining.]"
Trimm added that detective tele
phone lines between switches, known
as trunks, could have helped cause
the problem. "Without the full com
plement [of trunks] working ;is they
should, some callers got a busy mes
sage." she said.
Problems have ceased for now.
Trimm said, but as ;i preventive mea
sure. System Control is closely moni
toring traffic on incoming trunk lines.
