# Dems win historic mid-term victory
## On-campus precincts record decent turnout 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
At 9:23 p.m. last night, as election
results rolled in on CNN. the televi
sion lounge in Toyon Hall was con
spicuously empty.
Despite extensive efforts by cam
pus political groups to encourage vot
ing, Stanford students showed a mod
erate turnout at the polls yesterday.
In four mostly undergraduate
precincts - those voting at Wilbur,
Kimball. Florence Moore and Yost -
646 students took part in the process
which included hotly contested sen
ate and gubernatorial races.
In 1994, the last off-year election,
585 students voted in these precincts.
Stanford In Government, a non
partisan group, was visible all week in
White Plaza, where they provided
sample ballots, candidate informa
tion and friendly coercion.
"We've been here for a week but
it's picking up today," junior Nikki
Love, SIG campus awareness co-di
rector, said yesterday.
In addition, SIG has provided a
social forum for debate and informa
tion in the past few weeks.
"We started doing voter educa
tion with the Political Coffee Hour,"

Love said. "About 15 or 20 students
came and talked about how impor
tant it is for young people to vote."
SIG members displayed enthusi
asm for the democratic process.
"We're given all this stuff and if we
don't vote, it's very ungrateful," Love
said. "People take democracy for
granted, but things might go wrong if
you don't keep it in check."
Campus Green Vote, a nation
wide campus voter education organi
zation that emphasizes environmen
tal causes, was active in encouraging
Election Day activities. Yesterday,
the group checked registered voter
turnout throughout the afternoon by
taking count at student precincts.
With regard to poll watches,
"we're putting most of our focus on
undergrad housing," said Leila
Salazar, campus organizer for Cam
pus Green Vote. "Our goal is to get
students out to the poll and support
the environment when they vote, and
[the turnout was] pretty good consid
ering all the stuff that's happening in
Washington."
Campus partisan groups were
equally involved in encouraging stu
dent voting. Stanford Democrats

were optimistic about the turnout, al
though they did not maintain exact
counts.
"It's looked pretty good from
what I've seen," said sophomore
Krista Glaser, director of communi
cations for Stanford Democrats.
"()ur efforts have been to really get
out the vote."
(ilaser was particularly interested
in stressing the importance of voting
since the majority of registered Stan
ford students with party affiliations

arc Democrats.
No representative of College Re
publicans was available for com
ment.
When asked why they didn't get
to the polls, student non-voters re
sponded with various reasons, rang
ing from not receiving their absentee
ballots in time to general apathy.
"I didn't vote because I'm irre
sponsible." said senior Myrna Tron
coso.
Others cited the heavy workload
of midterm season.
"I had classes and then I was tak
ing a nap because I had hardly any
sleep last night," said sophomore

Michelle Sheene.
One issue of concern for upper
classmen especially was confusion
about where to vote. Since most stu
dents relocate each year, many are
often sent on Election Day to vote at
a different campus location.
"People move from place to place
every year, so there should he a cross
reference at the Stanford polling
places," said one Yost House poll
worker who noticed some student
frustration.
Junior Andrew Carhart was one
of those voting students who experi
enced the confusion. "They did has
sle me about where 1 lived." he said.

While some students managed to
finally get to the right place, others
were still searching at midday.
"I live in Cowell Cluster, and I
didn't know where to go." said senior
Karrie Cesario, who eventually did
find out where her polling place at
"SCRA" was.
Luckily, a positive spirit was visi
ble to offset the difficulties some stu
dents faced.
"I voted by absentee ballot," said
freshman Kimberly Sandler. "1
turned 18 on Oct. 7 and I was so ex
cited. Some people think their vote
doesn't count but I've always thought
it does."
