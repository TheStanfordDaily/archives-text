# Biologist Gould will give presidential lecture tonight
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Stephen Jay Gould, world
renowned evolutionary biologist and
prolific writer, will speak at the Sci
ence and Engineering Quad, Room
2(X) tonight at 7 p.m.
Gould is the second speaker this
year in the Presidential Lectures and
Symposia Series and will address the
"Interactions of Art and Science, and
the Largely Arbitrary Nature of Aca
demic Boundaries."
Gould, who is the Alexander
Agassi/. Professor of Zoology and
Professor of Geology at Harvard
University, has written extensively
on the intersection of biology and pa
leontology, the study of fossils.
He "used the Burgess Shale to
present the [idea] that if the clock
started all over again, evolution
would end up with a whole different
set of life forms. [He] has made
everybody think about evolution in a
different way," said Asst. Biology
Prof. Elizabeth Hadly, who special
izes in evolutionary ecology.
According to Hadly, Gould, the
author of nearly 20 books, is known
for introducing macro-evolutionary
concepts into scientific discourse.

"Specifically, he kx)ks at large
scale patterns in the paleontological
record and describes what processes
aren't described at the micro-evolu
tionary level. [His work is] important
in thinking about pattern and process
in evolution," she said.
"He's made paleontology an inte
gral part of ecology, evolution and
the understanding of life through
time in the [evolutionary biology)
field," Hadly said.
In his 1989 book, "Wonderful
Life: l*he Burgess Shale and the Na
ture of History," C jould writes of evo
lution, "What did happen makes
sense; our world is not capricious.
But many other plausible scenarios
would have satisfied any modern
votary of progress and g(x>d sense."
In addition to his contributions to
invertebrate paleontology, (jould
has worked to make science accessi
ble to the public.
"He can speak to a large audience
at Stanford. [There is| no other hu
manist whose work has been so ap
pealing to scientists," said Compara
tive Literature Prof. Hans Gum
brecht, coordinator of the lecture se
ries.
"Gould is read so widely. He has
overcome the [boundary of the]

'ivory-tower academic.' " Gum
brecht said.
In "Wonderful Life," Gould urges
readers to rethink the "objective
value" of scientific conclusions with
out dismissing their force: "We un
derstand that biases, preferences, so
cial values, and psychological atti
tudes all play a strong role in the
process of discovery. However, we
should not be driven to the opposite
extreme of complete cynicism â€” the
view that ... scientific conclusions
are just another form of aesthetic
preference."
Gould remains engaged in public
life not only through his scientific
writing and social commentary, but
also through his involvement in mu
seums. Gould is curator of inverte
brate paleontology at the Harvard
Museum of Comparative Zoology.
" I he pedagogy of museums is a
hot field. More people than ever be
fore are visiting museums," Gum
brechtsaid.
Gould's versatility and presence
in American popular culture is per
haps most striking in his guest ap
pearance on "The Simpsons." In the
episode, Gould provided the voice
for the curator at the museum of nat
ural history.
