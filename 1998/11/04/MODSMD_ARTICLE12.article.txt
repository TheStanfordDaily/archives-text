## Abortion law barred in Wisconsin 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Wisconsin was barred Tuesday by a federal
appeals court from enforcing its ban on a type of late-term abortion while
the state and opponents of the law battle in court.
The 3-2 ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was a victory for
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and six physicians who challenged the
new law.
"When states enact legislation like this, they are taking risks with
women's lives and health." said Roger Evans, a New York attorney for the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
Jim Haney, a spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle
Jr., said the state had not decided how to respond to the ruling.
"We are still prepared to make the strongest arguments possible in
defense of the law," Haney said.
The law approved in April bans so-called "partial-birth abortions" in
which a fetus is partially delivered vaginally and destroyed, then the deliv
ery completed.

Under the law. doctors who perform the procedure risk the same penal
ties as persons convicted of murder. Wisconsin does not have the death
penalty, but doctors could face life imprisonment.
Planned Parenthood and the physicians, who perform abortions, con
tend the new law restricts women's options. They also claim the law unfair
ly punishes doctors.
A trial is pending before U.S. District Judge John C. Shaba/ in Madison.
Wis. Shabaz had refused to grant a temporary order.
In the majority appeals decision granting such an order. Chief Judge
Richard Posner attacked the Wisconsin law on three grounds:
— It contains no exception for cases in which the fetus could not survive
outside the mother's body.
— It contains no exception for cases in which the procedure is necessary
to preserve the mother's health.
— It is too vaguely worded and might make doctors afraid to perform
legally permissible abortions.
