Accused Nazi guard ordered deported
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal immigration court ordered depor
tation for an Illinois man accused of participating in a massacre of Jews at
a Nazi slave labor camp, the Justice Department announced Tuesday.
Bronislaw Hajda lost his U.S. citizenship earlier this year when a feder
al appeals court affirmed a lower court's finding that Hajda served as an
irmed guard at SS Training Camp Trawniki and the Treblinka labor camp
in Nazi-occupied Poland from 1943 to 1945.
The court also found that Hajda lied about his World War II record and
Nazi ties when applying for U.S. citizenship in 1950. His past would have
made him ineligible to enter the United States and ineligible for citizen
ship.
Immigration Judge Carlos Cuevas of Chicago ordered the deportation
Friday. Hajda will be deported either to Poland, where he was born, or to
Germany, where he lived before entering the United States.
Hajda, 74, a retired factory worker living in Schiller Park, 111., denied the
allegations at a federal trial last year, declaring, "I never killed anyone."

Scrabble slip up in ad calls for department store
apology
NORWALK. Conn. (AP) — How many points is the word "OOPS"
worth in Scrabble?
The Caldor department store chain apologized Tuesday after 11 mil
lion copies of an advertising circular showed two smiling boys playing
Scrabble around a board with the word "RAPE" spelled out.
Caldor said it does not know who did it or how it got past the proof
readers.
The discount chain learned of the problem late Friday when a cus
tomer called to complain about the advertisement, which appeared in a
44-page toy-sale insert that was distributed over the weekend in 85 news
papers in the Northeast, where Caldor operates 145 stores.
The word "RAPE" is spelled vertically on the board. At least two
other words on the board are nonsense words.
"Obviously, it's a mistake," said Caldor spokeswoman Jennifer
Belodeau. "It's not something that we would ever have done intentional
ly. While we do proofread these things very carefully, with the volume on
that particular page, that was something that was missed."
