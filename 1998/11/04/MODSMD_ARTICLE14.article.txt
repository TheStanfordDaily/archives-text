# U.S. warming proposal shelved
## Cool reception

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
(AP) â€” A U.S.-hacked proposal
urging the developing world to take
a bigger role in combating global
warming has gotten a cool recep
tion at a IJ.N. climate summit.
Developing nations led by China
blocked efforts to discuss "volun
tary" quotas for poorer nations at
the conference, the biggest since a
landmark global warming agree
ment was reached last year.
"That item is no longer on the
agenda," said Michael Williams, the
IJ.N. spokesman. "Although it
could come up in some informal
discussions."
Delegates at the two-week sum
mit have now turned their attention
to other issues concerning develop
ing countries, Williams said.
On Tuesday, discussions on
changing land use and forestry,
along with how to help poorer
countries better develop emissions
fighting technology dominated the
day's talks.
The issue of how poorer nations
participate in stopping global
warming is one of the thorniest.
Some nations, such as China and
India, balk at the idea of reducing
greenhouse gases, saying the rise in
emissions results from efforts to
sustain basic human needs.
Spurred on by China, the 163
nations decided by consensus Mon
day to block the issue from even
reaching the agenda as they kicked
off their two-week conference.
Debate on other issues was con
tinuing Tuesday as the delegates
sought to flesh out the 1997 treaty
protocol agreed to in Kyoto, Japan.
"To say the least, we are disap

pointed that it appears that coun
tries will not have an opportunity to
explore this matter in any detail,"
U.S. negotiator Melinda Kimble
told the delegates.
History was made last Decem
ber in Kyoto when governments set
2012 as the deadline for cutting
back on greenhouse gases in the
United States, Japan, the 15-nation
European Union and 21 other
industrial nations.
Although the, cuts currently
apply only to those 38 nations,
greenhouse emissions in India and
China are expected by 2015 to
exceed those of the biggest polluter,
the United States.
Many scientists believe Earth is
gradually warming because of five
gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from
power plant and automobile con
sumption. Critics say dire warming
scenarios remain unproved and
don't warrant potentially costly
shifts away from fossil fuels.
The United States is not among
the 38 signatories of the accord so
far, and the Senate remains skepti
cal. absent greater efforts by the
developing world.
Yet many developing countries
argue their economies can't assume
costly greenhouse gas reductions
that quotas would require. They
point out industrialized nations in
the North loaded the atmosphere
with carbon dioxide to begin with.
The Kyoto accord would require
the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and
other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States
by 7 percent and Japan by 6 per
cent.
