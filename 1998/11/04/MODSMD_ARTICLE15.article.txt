## Editorial Co-chairs boost STS

Appointment of Findlen
and McGinn is good for all
interdisciplinary studies

MOSI CURRENT undergradu
ates were in high school when the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences committed to finding a head for the
program in Science, Technology and Soci
ety rather than dismantling the entire
department.
We applauded that decision when it was
made in September IW6, and we applaud
its result, the appointment of Assoc. Histo
ry I'rof. Paula lindlen and Industrial Engi
neering I'rof. Robert Mc(iinn as co-chairs.
In spring l l )%, when it appeared the pro
gram was to be phased out, everyone was
surprised to find supposedly apathetic Stan
ford students up in arms to have the pro
gram saved. A very active campaign fol
lowed. including a petition signed by more
than 2,<><H) students.
Although the School ol Humanities and
Sciences insisted, as ever, that student
protest was not the reason the program was
saved, it was gratifying at the time to see
how far the students were prepared to go
for their academic priorities.
It's been equally gratifying to see the
program regain and keep up a high level of
student interest. I his is something Stanford
students want to study.
Hy agreeing to head up the program,
l indlen and Mc( iinn are making great indi
vidual efforts to make sure that students
here will be able to study subjects that
engage them and bring out their best work.
In addition. S I Sand several other interdis
ciplinarv programs make up one of Stan

ford 's lesser known but most valuable aca
demic features.
The amount and the range of interdisci
plinary opportunities at Stanford gives our
undergraduate curriculum a unique flavor
and encourages people to consider the full
dimensions of what they study even when
some of those dimensions may not fit into a
neat category.
S I S is remarkable, and valuable, in the
degree to which it straddles the boundary
between traditionally "techie" and "fuzzie"
realms. Paradoxically, this has in the past
created problems for the program in that it
didn't seem entirely to belong either in its
original home, the School of Engineering,
or its current home, the School of I lumani
ties and Sciences. It was very unfortunate
that this ambiguous status contributed to
the program's near-demise. The whole
notion of interdisciplinary programs is
going to create this kind of ambiguity, and
the University must be prepared to imple
ment original solutions unless it wants a
drop in the quality of interdisciplinary
study.
If interdisciplinary programs were to
decline at Stanford, it wouldn't make the
national news, but the University would be
truly diminished. The Stanford undergradu
ate experience would become less distinc
tive.
However, far from declining, S I'S has
proved remarkably resilient in spite of its
lack of a permanent head. Student interest
revived quickly after the program was given
a new lease on life. This interest certainly is
owed to McC iinn's work as interim chair
and Findlen's efforts on the S TS Program
Committee. Given the good health of the
program, continuity into the future is
promising.
