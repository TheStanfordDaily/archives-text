## Living the absurd: a movie of my life 
### 
IN SPITE OF myself. I
have decided to suc
cumb to peer pressure
by embracing the first
principle of columnist
writing: talking about
mvself.

Wir\l Despite what most peo
ple say, I am convinced that 1 am a person
of great significance. Not having done much
with my life does little to upset this self
image. Deep within my bosom lies the firm
conviction that I am an Extraordinary Per
son.
As such. 1 am anxiously awaiting the
inevitable attention reserved for only the
most celebrated of celebrities. My memoirs,
simply entitled Eugene!, will surely be pub
lished in the near future — ghost-written, of
course, by magical realist Gabriel Garcia
Marque/. He will poorly mimic my style of
writing, but his biography will be fairly
accurate — except that my mother was not
born with a mystical clairvoyance and my
father was never a South American prosti
tute.
As great as this milestone will be in my
life, it will merely serve as a stepping stone
for much greater and much more extraordi
nary things. In particular, this best-selling
book will finally provide the opportunistic
Hollywood producers and the visionary
independent directors with the inspirational
basis for the movie of my life. "The kids will
love it,"the studio executives will insist.
In an attempt to appeal to the proper
demographic, the writers and producers
negotiating the deal will demand that the
movie of my life include a rocking sound

track featuring the hottest musical talents;
every MTV poster child from the past
decade will be represented. In one touching
yet hauntingly anachronistic scene, my
character will have his first kiss during the
big "End of the '80s" junior high dance,
while Marilyn Manson croons his heartfelt
ballad "Cake and Sodomy."
The strategic use of contemporary tunes
on the soundtrack will anticipate the '90s
music revival that will inevitably occur after
the standard two-decade incubation period.
"It's retro before retro is retro," the studio
executives will explain cryptically.
While the soundtrack will be superb, the
script will be ingenious. It will impeccably
capture the experience of growing up in my
generation. Throughout the movie, there
will be references to some defining
moments from my childhood: the pizza
delivery revolution, the invention of home
video games and the Lazer-Tag gift craze
from Christmas 1985.
The script's strength will be augmented
by the director's clever cinematic devices.
As an Extraordinary Person, my thoughts
are always lucid and profound. To convey
this fact to the audience, my inner mono
logue will be done as a voice-over delivered
with a sophisticated British accent. In the
Spanish version,jEugenio!, the voice will be
dubbed by Latin legend Ricardo Montal
ban. The mismatch between my character's
voice and the voice-over will not confuse
audiences. No, it will make perfect sense.
Of course, to avoid publicizing any
events that may besmirch my extraordinary
character, my agent will insist that we
rewrite some scenes from the screenplay.

According to the censored script, my unfor
tunate mishap at the Beta House will be
blamed on the "stomach discomfort"
caused by drinking too much seltzer water
from the keg — that keg of seltzer water the
Beta House always had at its parties. In this
version of my life, my undergraduate cours
es were a breeze, my freshman year was a
non-stop joy ride and my first sexual experi
ence was a meaningful act of love — the
kind of love that comes with drinking too
much seltzer water.
In the early stages of post-production,
there will be two versions: the feel-good
summer comedy and the three-hour epic.
Test audiences will prefer the epic; it will
omit the comically grotesque footage of my
various birthmarks and moles.
The finished product will be an instant
hit. Awards will be won, and money will be
made. The real profit source, however, will
be the merchandising inspired by the movie.
Every kid from here to the Atlantic will be
carrying Eugene lunch boxes, wearing
Eugene Underoos and playing with Eugene
action figures like "Action Eugene with
Kung-Fu Grip" or "College Eugene with
Enormously Large Ego."
In the end, the fame and fortune will
become too much of a burden, driving me
to a hermitic lifestyle in rustic Maine. Con
tent with a simple cabin and a stash of
microwaveable burritos, I will disappear
into total anonymity, living life the only way
I know how — as an Extraordinary Person.
