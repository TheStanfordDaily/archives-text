Requirements are easier
I think Lauren Oster misunderstands
me in her Oct. 30 column. As a techie, 1
don't for ;i minute believe that English
isn't "real work." On the contrary, the
most painful classes I've taken at Stanford
have been creative writing classes, and for
me at least, producing a working program
is quite a bit easier than producing a
decent poem, a piece ol fiction or a really
good literary critique.
That said, there are some very tangible
reasons techies think fuz/.ies have it easy.
I he difference isn't necessarily in the sub
ject matter, but rather in the majors them
selves. Ihe English major requires 11
classes; a creative writing emphasis ups
that to 12. Computer science requires 18,
plus five quarters of math and four of sci
ence. Even the six classes that Al' credit
can chop off leaves 21 classes, nearly twice
Oster's major.
Oster may work hard in English class
es. but how often does she need to take
four or more classes or as many as 20 units
in a single quarter just to stay on track in
her major? Techies face that all the time.
Beyond all that, Oster seems to misun
derstand why many techies choose their
majors. Sure, there are people influenced
by the availability of jobs where we earn
lots of money, just as there are fuzzies who

chose their majors because of the relative
ly small number of classes required. There
are also those of us who. like Oster, chose
our majors because we're doing what we
love. We may not be as artistically inclined
as she, but we do have intellectual pas
sions and our academic choices are our
path to fulfilling them.
Computer science challenges and stim
ulates my mind and occasionally allows
me the satisfaction of a difficult problem
solved. It might even be the means by
which I'll change the world. Oster does a
beautiful job of defending herself and her
passions against those who trivialize them,
but I caution her against trivializing the
interests of the rest of us along the way.

Avoid rape hysteria
The recent assault at Roble Field
prompts us to think again about campus
safety but in no way warrants a new wave of
rape hysteria. Danielle Rees' Oct. 30 letter
precariously flirts with the latter.
According to the known evidence, last
week's incident was not a case of sexual
assault. Stealing or stripping off someone's
underpants is still a robbery.

II Rees "probably" ran "into at least 50
Stanford students who matched this
description just biking around campus
today," then she should immediately call
the police and help apprehend them.
Nothing on the outcome of her detective
inspiration is indicated in her letter. The
museum of stereotypes is filled to capaci
ty-
In regards to the basic statistic: "Three
fourths of all women will be sexually
assaulted in their lifetime." How can you
be so cruel to your fellow female stu
dents? Who gives you the right to use this
"will be," as if communicating the will of
an enraged deity? If rape is inevitable,
then your role is futile, if not discredited.
Rees should be more considerate with
your choice of tense or else you are date
raping (or date-raped by) fatalism and
defeatism.
"To be on the safe side always ask,"
expertly advises Rees. Hut that's a bureau
cratic manual guideline that ignores the
very real world Danielle urges us to open
ourselves to. It contradicts the everyday
reality that most people perform sex
because they need to escape the "safe"
side of life — that of rationalism, hierar
chy, tight schedules, etc. I know of no
form of sexual contact that doesn't include
the element of body friction (do you?),
which even in consensual sex is still a form
of violence. Sex is "violent." That's why

it's exciting and that's why most people
like it. This realization complicates sexual
assault and blurs boundaries between
proper and improper behavior.
I absolutely agree that Stanford is a
"bubble," and that small, conservative
communities can breed both assailants
and victims. And she would, no doubt,
agree with me that to "know thyself" is
always the best preventive for any form of
improper behavior. My difference with
Rees is that while I applaud her dedica
tion to her mission, I think it should
remain informative and preventive
instead of turning apocalyptic and thus
damaging the good will that sustains it.

Athleticism is valuable
I read in Monday's Daily that "athletes
who cannot meet the same high academic
standards that everyone else must meet
should not be admitted." Am I the only one
outraged by this? Stanford academics has a
long career of thumbing its nose at the ath
letic community, without cost, it seems.
While many students among us are ath
letically gifted, I can think of several who
are a far cry from the "well-rounded" indi

viduals Stanford purports to admit. Many of
them are unable to heneh press a piddly 40
lbs. These students are snotty, uninterested
in life in general and often quite dull.
Some things I have known such students
to do are: camp out for hum bio section
sign-ups, frequent the 24-hour study room,
fail to go out on Saturday nights, and other
fun, exciting and constructive activities.
No one is saying that bookworms are less
worthy than other people. But those who
are unable to interact with average people
should not be admitted simply because the
ehem lab needs another test-tube washer.
These students would never have been
admitted except for the unfairly large role
academics play in the admissions process.
Where did this notion of academic supe
riority come from anyway? The Athletics
Department, despite being burdened by
high academic admittance requirements,
has been ranked number one for four
straight years. The academic ranking has
recently had trouble entering the top five.
Don't lose hope, Ms. Leung. The place
you dream about does exist. A place where
academics are held on a pedestal and
human interaction is kept to a minimum. A
place where life is drab. It's called Harvard.
Perhaps you should look into it.
