# GOP loses House seats, governorships, battles to stand-still in Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defy
ing history. Democrats battled Re
publicans to a standstill - and per
haps better - yesterday in mid-term
elections likely to bolster support
for President Clinton on the eve of
congressional impeachment pro
ceedings.
Resurgent Democrats won the
single biggest prize of the night
when Gray Davis was elected gov
ernor of California.
The GOP held control of the
Senate but Democrats ousted two
vigorous Clinton critics - Alfonse
D'Amato of New York and Lauch
Faircloth of North Carolina. Demo
crat Carol Moseley-Braun, the Sen
ate's only black member, lost her
bid for re-election in Illinois.
In the House, where GOP lead
ers scheduled impeachment pro
ceedings to begin later this month.
Democratic gains made it possible
that the GOP would lose part of
their 11-seat majority. In that event.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
party leaders could come under
challenge in the GOP caucus.
A GOP majority would mark the

first time in 70 years they had held
the House three straight terms. But
any Democratic inroads would con
tradict a post-World War II trend of

an average of 27 losses in mid-term
losses for the party of a sitting presi
dent. Not since 1 V>34. when Franklin
Roosevelt was president, has the
party in the White House won seats
at mid-term.
Davis aside, Democrats celebrat
ed other statehouse victories, oust
ing a pair of Southern governors and
electing a governor in lowa for the
first time since 1%6. Democrats said
they were taking legislative cham
bers from the GOP, too.
In a dynastic triumph with impli
cations for the 2000 presidential
race, GOP (iov. George W. Bush
won a Texas-sized re-election. His
brother Jeb added the Florida state
house to the Republican column.
And Republicans held big-state
governships in Illinois, ()hio, Michi
gan and New York, and took Neva
da away from the Democrats.
Democrats countered in South
Carolina, where Jim Hodges top
pled first-term (iov. David Beasley,
ironically the chairman of the Re
publican Governors' Association.
Alabama Republican Gov. Fob

James was defeated as well.
Democrats also kept the Georgia
governorship in their hands, when
Roy Barnes won his race to succeed
Zell Miller.
The most intriguing race of the
night was in Minnesota, where for
mer pro-wrestler Jesse Ventura,
running as a Reform Party candi
date, won a shocking victory over his
two major party rivals in the race for
governor.
In one of the nation's most close
ly watched Senate races. Republican
Rep. Jim Bunning edged out Demo
cratic Rep. Scotty Baesler in a long
count in Kentucky.
Democratic Sen. Harry Reid led
for a new term in Nevada in a close
race with Rep. John Ensign.
With the polls still open in the
West, the leaders of both parties
sought to claim success in the final
midterm election of the Clinton
presidency.
Gingrich and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott said that when all
the seats were decided. Republicans

would pad their majorities in both
the House and Senate. However,
Senate Whip Don Nickles acknowl
edged tersely, ''It's not as good as
some hoped."
Steve Grossman, co-chair of the
Democratic Party, said a late-cam
paign series of GOP commercials
reminding voters of Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky was "an ab
ject failure .... This was not only a
colossal waste of money on the part
of the Republicans, but it also
caused something of a backlash," he
added.
Asked in an interview about the
impact of the returns on impeach
ment proceedings, I louse Democra
tic Leader Dick Gephardt said, "I
think this was a cry from the people
to get on with their agenda and I
hope the Republicans will."
In a closely watched Senate race,
McCain's partner in campaign re
form, Democrat Russell Feingold
won his race for re-election.
Two Clinton foes tasted defeat.
In strongly contested Senate races.

D'Amato lost his bid for a fourth
term to Rep. Charles Schumer in
New York. Faircloth fell to John Ed
wards in North Carolina.
Winning first terms were Demo
crat Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas
and Republican Mike Crapo in
Idaho, both of whom were succeed
ing lawmakers in their own party.
The trend in House races was
overwhelmingly favorable to incum
bents in both parties. With nearly
300 of the House's 435 races settled,
only a handful had been denied a
new term. Only one Democrat, Rep.
Jay Johnson of Wisconsin, was
among them.
That left the main battle for the
34 open seats.
In South Carolina, veteran De
mocratic Sen. Ernest Hollings - long
viewed by party strategists as one of
the most endangered incumbents on
the ballot - triumphed in his bid for a
6th full term.
As expected two Senate seats
switched from one party to the
other.
