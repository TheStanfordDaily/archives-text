# Deep Thoughts
## UCLA sucks and we win on the social front

WATCHING THE UCLA-Stan
ford football game on TV last
Saturday. I had a brief moment of
Bruin envy. As I witnessed the UCLA foot
ball players foul their way to undeserved
victory and the 90-pound song leaders do
hoochie dances under the glorious Pasade
na sunshine, I thought, "Wow, I could have
been there."
I went through a phase in high school
when 1 really wanted to go to UCLA. For
tunately, my best friend I future roommate
didn't get in, and I figured Stanford would
do more for me in the long term. A lot of
students here had this dilemma: Go to a
state school with your high-school friends,
save $ 12(),(KK) and rage out of control, or go
to Stanford and be really smart. Is it true
that State Schools = Tons of Fun while
Stanford's Social Scene = Lame?
This summer I lived in an apartment in
Westwood and observed the Bruin social
scene. And I'm so glad I'm here. Although
Stanford has many social problems, such as
people studying / watching Star Trek / play
ing Warcraft on weekend nights, 1 think
Stanford parties in the best possible way, at

least compared to UCLA.
The L.A. social scene is lively, but plastic
and artificial. It has an abundance of plastic
boobs, plastic faces and an artificially con
structed social scene due to the prevalence
and nature of the Greek system.
At UCLA, joining a fraternity or sorori
ty is more a requirement than an option,
and the whole system is a little psycho.
Freshmen rush before classes start, before
they meet anyone on their own terms.
Instantly people are given labels that deter
mine their social life for the next four (or
five, or six, depending on how affected their
major is and how much beer they drink)
years.
My two roommates this summer
belonged to an anonymous UCLA sorority,
which is purportedly the most diverse and
low-key of the institutionalized cliques —
the Theta Delt of UCLA sororities. But
when I examined their classified rush book
let, I almost cried.
The girls already in the sorority come a
week early to prepare to choose their new
best friends. For the first Sunday through
Friday, they follow a grueling nine-to-five

schedule that includes dress check, conver
sation workshops and the crucial hour of
song practice. Then comes the most impor
tant step in preparing for your social year —
shopping!
Most of the 30-page rush booklet was
devoted to answering the key question of
what to wear for rush. Each day had a dif
ferent theme, from sophisticated and sassy
to sporty / casual. The prose was inspira
tional:
Our sorority is the only way to go! What
else could the rushees possibly think with the
house completely decorated, smiles on our
faces and the cutest outfits on the row for the
first day!
The booklet described in painful detail
what to wear every day of the one-week
process. Also included were pictures of
appropriately dressed models singing car
toon-bubble sorority songs, helpful fabric
swatches and J. Crew catalog page numbers.
Please buy clothes that are flattering for
your body! Don't wait until the last moment
to buy rush clothes. You will be sad if you
end up with not-so-cute outfits and every
body else looks hot!

In one short week, through five-minute
conversations and a discerning fashion
sense, a Bruin determines whom he or she
will live and associate with for the rest of his
or her college career. The school is so big
that most girls only know their sisters and
members of brother fraternities. For the
greater social good, some poor rush dress
chair spent hours constructing a dress code
guaranteed to lure in the best girls.
OK girls! If you follow these guidelines
then you will be lookin' good! We just want
everyone to look their absolute best to give a
great impression to the rushees! Don't worry
about wasting money — just think of it as an
excuse to go shopping!
At least one of my roommates in L.A.
this summer was fairly sane. She's one of my
best friends from high school, and she is
usually a down-to-earth girl. Although she
doesn't take her sorority all that seriously,
it's where she's made almost all of her col
lege friends. And she spends several hun
dred dollars each summer shopping for
rush.
I love my seven drawmates at Stanford,
most of whom I didn't know until mv

sophomore or junior year. The ones I did
meet during freshman orientation I initially
thought were sketchy whores. I'm glad I got
a chance to get to know a lot of people and
decide for myself which ones I want to
spend my free time with based on their per
sonalities and not the sassiness of their out
fits.
Perhaps Stanford has a high percentage
of antisocial freaks more interested in doing
physics equations on the dorm dry-erase
board than hanging out. But there are also
plenty of people looking to play as hard as
they work. And unlike UCLA and most
state schools, we're given the freedom to
explore the social scene on our own terms,
mostly without superficial labels. And a
lucky, immoral four-point victory is not
going to change the fact that UCLA is arti
ficial and lame.

Brittney Jensen is a senior majoring in
English with a focus on film and theater.
She hopes our football team beats (JSC this
weekend, so she doesn t have to write a col
umn making fun of them. It would be too
easy.
