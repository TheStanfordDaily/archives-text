Following its methodical three

an hour signing posters for fans.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Saturday: No. 5 Stanford (20-2) d.
Fresno State (15-6), 15-8, 15-6.15-8.

Memo to the 1,167 devoted fans
who stood in line for autographs:
hold on to those posters — they may
hold a piece of history.
For. with each match, the young
team appears to be maturing into a
serious national title contender and
priming itself for a run at a third-con
secutive NCAA championship.
Stanford (20-2) acted like a cham
pionship team last night, simply over
powering a weaker Fresno State (15-
6) team with a balanced offensive at
tack and impenetrable blocking, 15-
8, 15-6,15-8.
Fresno State coach Lindy Vivas
praised the Cardinal team and gave it
credit as a national power.
"I thought we played really well,
considering we were without two
starters," she said. "We did all we
could on our side of the net. The
hardest thing about playing a great
team like Stanford is that you have to
play a lot better than you usually do.
"We were able to play well in
spurts, but to beat Stanford you have
to play at a high level for the whole
match, which is extremely difficult."
Vivas credited the Stanford de
fense for frustrating the Bulldog hit

ters and making a Fresno State win in
Maples almost impossible.
"They played great defense for
the entire match," Vivas said. "Some
of the balls Stanford dug would have
gone down in the last 13 matches we
have played. When they play that
well defensively, it makes it even
more of a struggle to make it a
match."
One major reason that the Cardi
nal defense made such an impression
on Fresno State was the invaluable
play of junior outside hitter Jaimi
Gregory, who was playing in just her
third match after being sidelined with
torn knee cartilage.
Prior to the game, Stanford coach
Don Shaw emphasized the pivotal
role that Gregory plays in the back
row for the Cardinal.
"I didn't see how much she meant
to us until she was gone," Shaw said.
"Having her back in there makes me
realize how valuable she is to our
team. She gets to balls that other
players on our team can't handle."
Gregory, a veteran leader, who al
ways seems to put the perfect per
spective on every situation, is just
happv to be back on the floor con
tributing for this Stanford team.
"1 feel so fortunate to do my fa
vorite thing in the world every day,"
Gregory said. "When I got hurt,
something was missing in my life. At
the same time, I had so much confi
dence in the people who were out
there filling in for me, which made it
a lot easier to be on the sidelines.
"1 feel so fortunate to be able to
run and jump and be out there with

the joy of team competition is at the
heart of her passion for volleyball. "I
am so grateful and thankful that my
knee has healed so that I can be back
on the court doing what I love."
