"We'll take the split," said junior
center Gabe Miller. "They are defi
nitely our No. 1 competition for Na
tionals."
Stanford came out strong in Fri
day's 4-3 win. jumping to a 1-0 first
period lead on a goal by graduate
student winger Juha Yrjanheikki.
In the second period, Stanford
added two goals. Senior defenseman
Paul Heneman scored on a power
play goal from outside, and graduate
center / forward Eric Mastroianni
followed with Stanford's third goal.
"It was a breakaway four-on-four
because of matching penalties,"
Mastroianni said. "I cut up the mid
dle, took it [the puck] and beat the
goalie below the glove."
The Bruins, however, equalized
the score at 3-3 heading into the third
period.
Midway through the third period,
Stanford took control of the match

on a game-winning goal by Miller.
" The momentum was completely
going their way," Miller said.
"[After the goal] the momentum, if
not the game, definitely went our
way."
UCLA then pulled its goalie, sub
stituting an extra winger for him. "At
the end they really started peppering
the goalie," Miller said.
Senior goalie Sami Jo Small con
tinued her strong play, shutting out
UCLA for the rest of the game.
"1 thought we had control of the
game all along and one of the things
that let us step it up was Sami," said
head coach D.J. Nader.
"The goaltending on our part was
just phenomenal," said Miller.
"They doubled our [number of]
shots."
On Saturday, Stanford came out
strong, getting an early goal by se
nior center Tom Terbell from the
outside.
Yrjanheikki, however, suffered
an injury at the end of the first peri
od, causing Stanford to lose its mo
mentum.
"Juha was taken out with a knee
on-knee hit," said Nader. "[lt] pretty
much took him out for the second
period."
Stanford suffered mentally from
Yrjanheikki's injury.
"The whole second period we
were just completely unorganized
and gave up a lot of chances," Mas
troianni said." I lie second period re
ally told the tale for that game."
I)( LA quickly capitalized, going
up 4-1 in the second.

"They got a power-play goal and a
couple of back-to-back goals," Miller
said. "It took the wind out of our
sails."
Late in the second period, Miller
scored on a two-on-one breakaway,
bringing Stanford within two goals.
"1 shot a blind shot by the left
sk;ite of the goalie," Miller said. "I le

didn't even see it."
"[Following the goal] we had
some momentum." Ileneman said.
"With seven seconds left they had a
face-off in our /.one and they got a
good clean shot off."
Stanford recovered from this mo
mentum change in the third period,
but was unable to score, making the

final score 5-2.
Stanford enters another critical
week for a berth into the national
championships.
