Rugby: The Stanford rugby team got
the pre-season off to a start as the
Cardinal matched up against the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness team. The Business School
outscored a young Stanford team,
but not without a very diligent effort
from the Cardinal.

The game held last Saturday on
Maloney Field was a good chance to
allow this year's intercollegiate line
up to face its first competition. The
format of the game was run in four
quarters rather than two longer
halves in order to allow the team
more coaching and substitution op
portunities, yet still providing game
like pressures and opposition much
more intense than an intersquad
scrimmage.
This year, the team is looking to
continue a long tradition of excel
lence that has recently led the team
to three consecutive trips to the final
four tournament.
The Stanford team was starting
several players in their first A-side
game, a mark of inexperience of
which the Business School took ad
vantage. The Cardinal's scrum-half,
fly-half and inside center are all first
year players. The team's ability to
move the ball forward will improve
as these players learn to come to
gether in one style.
"For a first game / scrimmage, we
felt that our team defense and tack
ling was good, and that the intensity
and excitement level was high." said
senior lock Karl Wente. "We are
young and aggressive, but lack expe
rience. We hope that time and good
coaching will bring everybody
along."
Polo: The Stanford polo squad has
gotten off to a very quick start this
season with a 2-0 record.
Last weekend at UC-Davis. the
men's team won bv a score of 13-8,
