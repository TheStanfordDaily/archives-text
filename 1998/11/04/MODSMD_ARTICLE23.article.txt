# Teams enjoy successes
## 
### Bobby Blunt Staff writer 
Rugby: The Stanford rugby team got
the pre-season off to a start as the
Cardinal matched up against the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness team. The Business School
outscored a young Stanford team,
but not without a very diligent effort
from the Cardinal.

CLUB SPORTS
The game held last Saturday on
Maloney Field was a good chance to
allow this year's intercollegiate line
up to face its first competition. The
format of the game was run in four
quarters rather than two longer
halves in order to allow the team
more coaching and substitution op
portunities, yet still providing game
like pressures and opposition much
more intense than an intersquad
scrimmage.
This year, the team is looking to
continue a long tradition of excel
lence that has recently led the team
to three consecutive trips to the final
four tournament.
The Stanford team was starting
several players in their first A-side
game, a mark of inexperience of
which the Business School took ad
vantage. The Cardinal's scrum-half,
fly-half and inside center are all first
year players. The team's ability to
move the ball forward will improve
as these players learn to come to
gether in one style.
"For a first game / scrimmage, we
felt that our team defense and tack
ling was good, and that the intensity
and excitement level was high." said
senior lock Karl Wente. "We are
young and aggressive, but lack expe
rience. We hope that time and good
coaching will bring everybody
along."
Polo: The Stanford polo squad has
gotten off to a very quick start this
season with a 2-0 record.
Last weekend at UC-Davis. the
men's team won bv a score of 13-8,
and the women's team by a margin of
10-5. The games were played in Davis
and presented a bit of a technical dis
advantage for the Stanford players in
the exchange of horses. Stanford was
forced to ride eight of the Davis hors
es.
"We ended up playing mostly
Davis horses, so riding is always a
challenge, but the horses were great
and we gained another strong confer
ence win to make us 2-0." said
Brandy Moses.
Next weekend, Stanford has its
first home game with the men playing
IJSC on Sunday at (T'ETA horse
park off of Sandhill road at 10 am.
Equestrian: The equestrian team is
very close to qualifying for regionals
after a strong performance this past
weekend in the team's English dou
bleheader. Several of the team's rid
ers provided excellent rides among a
very strong field of competition.
Fresno State's team captured the top
honors for the weekend, and Stan
ford was the reserve high-point team
both days.
In the Saturday competition,
Mandy (iillett was the individual re
serve high-point rider, (iillett com
peted in both tne open Hat and the
open fences categories, finishing first
and fifth, respectively. Also perform
ing extremely well for the Cardinal
on Saturday was team captain Vanes
sa Bartsch. who captured first place in
both the intermediate Hat and fences
divisions.
Sunday's show found other ('ardi
nal team members performing well.
Karen Hoffman was the high-point

rider for the day and Jennifer Stewart
was co-reserve high-point rider.
Christina Greene placed first in the
advanced Walk, Trot, Canter, which
qualified her for the novice division.
Greene has now compiled a total of
35 points in the advanced WTC cate
gory, the requirement to advance to
the next bracket.
Also of note was the strong effort
by first-time English rider Bo White.
"Bo White donned his first pair of
britches and rode in the English clasc.
I lis trip around the ring was his first
time in an English saddle. It was quite
a sight, he was an amazing sport,"
said Bartsch.
The team will again be in action
this weekend with a Western-only
doubleheader at Reedley College.
The Western team needs to make up
a gap of four points in order to move
up to second place in the league.
Moving into the second spot would
also secure the Cardinal a place in the
regional competition later this year.
Mountain Biking: The Stanford
mountain biking team has shown this
past weekend that although only two
years old as an organization and with
many less experienced riders, they
are legitimate contenders.
The Cardinal mountain team
went into the weekend's hiking
ranked fifth in the league thus far.
After the dust had settled at San
I )iego Suite's home track, the C ardi
nal's 15 riders had not only captured
second place for the weekend, but
had scored enough points to jump
three spots to second in the division.
I he racing this weekend in San
Diego was the league finals, and
therefore points accrued were count
ed double in the final league stand
ings. These points were added to the

total amassed over the previous races
this season and Stanford was able to
finish with a season total of 830
points. Retaining first place was Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo with 1 .(MM)
points.
In order to make up so much
ground in the league standings during
the championships this weekend
there were many riders who provided
outstanding performances for Stan
ford. Captain John Bilderbeck and
Jordan Mac Donald worked together
for the majority of their cross-country
race, pushing each other to a faster
finish time. Forest Ray pushed on in
his race despite a nasty crash that left
him with a cut on his chin.
After the cross-country races the
Cardinal was holding onto the sec
ond-place spot overall for the week
end. But the next event, the downhill,
had been a major stumbling block for
Stanford in every race so far this sea
son. In a truly ama/ing performance
the Cardinal captured second in the
downhill as well.
Erin Kassoy captured first place in
the women's A division. Kassoy lias
pressed in the downhill before, but
was always plagued with some sort of
setback.
On the men's side of the downhill.
Jordan Mac Donald finished in third
place. I lis time beat the course aver
age by over two minutes.
The Sunday races in the criterium
proved to be the final step in Stan
ford's amazing weekend. Again the
team was lead by a second-place fin
ish by Kassoy.
"The efforts of our racers on Sun
day were quite possibly the most sig
nificant. Racing through the pain of
the day before, with tapped reserves,
yet still giving it their all was really an
inspiration to our team. I his week

end our squad really gave all their
hearts to their races," Bilderbeck
said.
While the efforts of every single
rider were imperative to the outcome
of the team in the league season the

year, the women's team riders were
able to help amass a large portion of
the overall team points. Now as the
team prepares to continue in the Na
tional races in Reno, the team will
continue to need to work together.

on Saturday was team captain Vanes
sa Bartsch. who captured first place in
both the intermediate Hat and fences
divisions.
Sunday's show found other ('ardi
nal team members performing well.
Karen Hoffman was the high-point

rider for the day and Jennifer Stewart
was co-reserve high-point rider.
Christina Greene placed first in the
advanced Walk, Trot, Canter, which
qualified her for the novice division.
Greene has now compiled a total of
35 points in the advanced WTC cate
gory, the requirement to advance to
the next bracket.
Also of note was the strong effort
by first-time English rider Bo White.
"Bo White donned his first pair of
britches and rode in the English clasc.
I lis trip around the ring was his first
time in an English saddle. It was quite
a sight, he was an amazing sport,"
said Bartsch.
The team will again be in action
this weekend with a Western-only
doubleheader at Reedley College.
The Western team needs to make up
a gap of four points in order to move
up to second place in the league.
Moving into the second spot would
also secure the Cardinal a place in the
regional competition later this year.
Mountain Biking: The Stanford
mountain biking team has shown this
past weekend that although only two
years old as an organization and with
many less experienced riders, they
are legitimate contenders.
The Cardinal mountain team
went into the weekend's hiking
ranked fifth in the league thus far.
After the dust had settled at San
I )iego Suite's home track, the C ardi
nal's 15 riders had not only captured
second place for the weekend, but
had scored enough points to jump
three spots to second in the division.
I he racing this weekend in San
Diego was the league finals, and
therefore points accrued were count
ed double in the final league stand
ings. These points were added to the

total amassed over the previous races
this season and Stanford was able to
finish with a season total of 830
points. Retaining first place was Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo with 1 .(MM)
points.
In order to make up so much
ground in the league standings during
the championships this weekend
there were many riders who provided
outstanding performances for Stan
ford. Captain John Bilderbeck and
Jordan Mac Donald worked together
for the majority of their cross-country
race, pushing each other to a faster
finish time. Forest Ray pushed on in
his race despite a nasty crash that left
him with a cut on his chin.
After the cross-country races the
Cardinal was holding onto the sec
ond-place spot overall for the week
end. But the next event, the downhill,
had been a major stumbling block for
Stanford in every race so far this sea
son. In a truly ama/ing performance
the Cardinal captured second in the
downhill as well.
Erin Kassoy captured first place in
the women's A division. Kassoy lias
pressed in the downhill before, but
was always plagued with some sort of
setback.
On the men's side of the downhill.
Jordan Mac Donald finished in third
place. I lis time beat the course aver
age by over two minutes.
The Sunday races in the criterium
proved to be the final step in Stan
ford's amazing weekend. Again the
team was lead by a second-place fin
ish by Kassoy.
"The efforts of our racers on Sun
day were quite possibly the most sig
nificant. Racing through the pain of
the day before, with tapped reserves,
yet still giving it their all was really an
inspiration to our team. I his week

end our squad really gave all their
hearts to their races," Bilderbeck
said.
While the efforts of every single
rider were imperative to the outcome
of the team in the league season the

year, the women's team riders were
able to help amass a large portion of
the overall team points. Now as the
team prepares to continue in the Na
tional races in Reno, the team will
continue to need to work together.
