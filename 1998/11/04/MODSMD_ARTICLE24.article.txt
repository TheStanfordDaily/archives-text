# Men's soccer program keeps on rising
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
There are some sports programs
that have always been great, such as
Duke men's basketball or North
Carolina women's soccer, where
winning championships is natural
and even expected. Other programs
take time to come into their own and
establish themselves as perennial
powers. These other teams need a
base to spring from, to gather mo
mentum si) they, too, can eventually
become a dynasty. At Stanford,
sports teams are expected to win and
win consistently, season after season.
Stanford men's soccer head coach
Bobby Clark came to the Farm from
Dartmouth on April <S, 19% and in
just three years, turned a lagging, un
noticeable men's soccer team into a
nationally respected top-10 program.
It could be the beginning of some
thing bigger on the Farm for men's
soccer.
History The Stanford men's soccer
program started back in 1911. Harry
Maloney, whom the current soccer
stadium is named after, coached the
varsity team for the first 30 years,
amassing a 104-60-40 record but fail
ing to bring home a national champi
onship or even a league title. The
program plugged along for the next
50 years, never reaching notoriety,
never winning a conference title and
only reaching postseason play in
1 962 and 1978.
In the *Sos and early " l X)s. soccer
gained popularity throughout the
country and Stanford started to feel
the heat of soccer fever. In 1991, the
team, coached by Colin Lindores
(1990-95, 50-51-18) and led by Kyle
Krpata and Randy Mann, '92. quali
fied for the NCAA tournament for
the first time in 13 years. They lost in
the first round 6-3 to IJSF, the even
tual national champion.
In 1992. Stanford had another
quality year and finished second in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. its highest finish ever, and qual
ified for the NCAA tournament
again, losing in the first round to the
University of San Diego. It was the
first and only time a Stanford men's
soccer team had ever made back-to
back appearances in the tournament.
After the two solid years, things
went downhill and the team strug

gled for the next three seasons,
reaching its lowest point in 1995 —
the first season for this year's senior
class — when the team finished sev
enth out of 10 teams in the MPSF
after winning only two conference
matches.
Bohhy Clark, on the scene Enter
Clark, a former New Zealand Na
tional Team coach (1994-96) and for
mer head coach at Dartmouth (1985-
94. 82-42-13). who took over the
reins from Lindores in 1996.
" The time came to make a change
and Bobby was the perfect person
for the job." said Mann, who served
as assistant coach under Lindores
from 1994-95 and then served as as
sistant to Clark in 1996.
Clark had a winning reputation
and had previously worked with
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Le
land while at Dartmouth. With the
arrival of Clark, a new spark had
been lit and things started to look up
for the (Cardinal almost immediately.
"A few of us looked to go to Dart
mouth out of high school because
Bobby was coaching [there]. He had
a reputation for winning." said senior

Adam Siegman. the Cardinal's third
leading scorer this season and who
was recruited by Lindores.
Fifth-year senior Eric Vande
velde, a defender who is out for the
year with a broken leg. agreed with
Siegman.
"There are certain people in life
who are winners and Hobby is one of
them," said Vandevelde. "There's
just something about him. He em
bodies the team. He embodies confi
dence."
The first two seasons In his first year
at the helm in 1996. Clark took virtu
ally the same team that had finished
seventh in conference the previous
year and led it to a 10-4-4 record (1 -2-
1 MPSF) for a fourth-place finish in
the league. For his efforts, Clark was
named MPSF Co-Coach of the Year
for the Mountain Division.
Integral to that first season's suc
cess were the crucial additions of se
nior defender Jamie Clark, who
transferred from North Carolina,
and junior defender Gerard Davis
from New Zealand. Both came be
cause of Clark's arrival.
"Bobby came with a fresh ap

proach and new positive attitude,"
said Mann. "He had a new style and
his fresh perspective was conta
gious."
Last season, the Cardinal clinched
the MPSF title for the first time ever
and qualified for the NCAA tourna
ment for the first time since 1992.
The team also climbed as high as No.
2 in the nation before its 15-game un
defeated streak was snapped by top
ranked Indiana.
The team left in the first round
after losing a heartbreaking double
overtime game to Washington. 2-1.
The team finished the season ranked
15th. the highest ever finish in Stan
ford men's soccer history, and Clark
was named MPSF Mountain Divi
sion Coach of the Year.
Individual Stanford players also
excelled under the new leadership
and last year more players than ever
in Stanford history were recognized
for their talents.
On the field "I read the situation and
the boys were hungry to work hard,
to be successful." Clark said. "They
had had a tough time in previous
years and were looking for a positive

situation.
First on C lark's list was to instill
discipline in the Stanford players.
"The minute Bobby showed up
there was no question who was in
charge," said senior forward A.J.
Sauer. the captain of this year's
squad. "It was a 180-degree change
from freshman year. We knew we
had tc) be 1 (K) percent dedicated to be
on the men's soccer team — we had
to get fit and be disciplined in our
lives."
In ("lark's first spring on the Farm,
the team spent the bulk of its time to
gether regaining its cardiovascular
base. That summer. Clark outlined a
detailed running program.
The players soon realized that
things were going to be different for
good.
Now, before every practice the
players suit up together, go over the
outline for the day's practice and
then walk over to the field as a team.
"Bobby runs practice the way the
professional club teams in Europe
are run," said Sauer.

community, in his three-year tenure on the Farm.
