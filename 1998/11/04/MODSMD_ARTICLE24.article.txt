# Men's soccer program keeps on rising
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
There are some sports programs
that have always been great, such as
Duke men's basketball or North
Carolina women's soccer, where
winning championships is natural
and even expected. Other programs
take time to come into their own and
establish themselves as perennial
powers. These other teams need a
base to spring from, to gather mo
mentum si) they, too, can eventually
become a dynasty. At Stanford,
sports teams are expected to win and
win consistently, season after season.
Stanford men's soccer head coach
Bobby Clark came to the Farm from
Dartmouth on April <S, 19% and in
just three years, turned a lagging, un
noticeable men's soccer team into a
nationally respected top-10 program.
It could be the beginning of some
thing bigger on the Farm for men's
soccer.
History The Stanford men's soccer
program started back in 1911. Harry
Maloney, whom the current soccer
stadium is named after, coached the
varsity team for the first 30 years,
amassing a 104-60-40 record but fail
ing to bring home a national champi
onship or even a league title. The
program plugged along for the next
50 years, never reaching notoriety,
never winning a conference title and
only reaching postseason play in
1 962 and 1978.
In the *Sos and early " l X)s. soccer
gained popularity throughout the
country and Stanford started to feel
the heat of soccer fever. In 1991, the
team, coached by Colin Lindores
(1990-95, 50-51-18) and led by Kyle
Krpata and Randy Mann, '92. quali
fied for the NCAA tournament for
the first time in 13 years. They lost in
the first round 6-3 to IJSF, the even
tual national champion.
In 1992. Stanford had another
quality year and finished second in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. its highest finish ever, and qual
ified for the NCAA tournament
again, losing in the first round to the
University of San Diego. It was the
first and only time a Stanford men's
soccer team had ever made back-to
back appearances in the tournament.
After the two solid years, things
went downhill and the team strug

gled for the next three seasons,
reaching its lowest point in 1995 —
the first season for this year's senior
class — when the team finished sev
enth out of 10 teams in the MPSF
after winning only two conference
matches.
Bohhy Clark, on the scene Enter
Clark, a former New Zealand Na
tional Team coach (1994-96) and for
mer head coach at Dartmouth (1985-
94. 82-42-13). who took over the
reins from Lindores in 1996.
" The time came to make a change
and Bobby was the perfect person
for the job." said Mann, who served
as assistant coach under Lindores
from 1994-95 and then served as as
sistant to Clark in 1996.
Clark had a winning reputation
and had previously worked with
Stanford Athletic Director Ted Le
land while at Dartmouth. With the
arrival of Clark, a new spark had
been lit and things started to look up
for the (Cardinal almost immediately.
"A few of us looked to go to Dart
mouth out of high school because
Bobby was coaching [there]. He had
a reputation for winning." said senior

Adam Siegman. the Cardinal's third
leading scorer this season and who
was recruited by Lindores.
Fifth-year senior Eric Vande
velde, a defender who is out for the
year with a broken leg. agreed with
Siegman.
"There are certain people in life
who are winners and Hobby is one of
them," said Vandevelde. "There's
just something about him. He em
bodies the team. He embodies confi
dence."
The first two seasons In his first year
at the helm in 1996. Clark took virtu
ally the same team that had finished
seventh in conference the previous
year and led it to a 10-4-4 record (1 -2-
1 MPSF) for a fourth-place finish in
the league. For his efforts, Clark was
named MPSF Co-Coach of the Year
for the Mountain Division.
Integral to that first season's suc
cess were the crucial additions of se
nior defender Jamie Clark, who
transferred from North Carolina,
and junior defender Gerard Davis
from New Zealand. Both came be
cause of Clark's arrival.
"Bobby came with a fresh ap

proach and new positive attitude,"
said Mann. "He had a new style and
his fresh perspective was conta
gious."
Last season, the Cardinal clinched
the MPSF title for the first time ever
and qualified for the NCAA tourna
ment for the first time since 1992.
The team also climbed as high as No.
2 in the nation before its 15-game un
defeated streak was snapped by top
ranked Indiana.
The team left in the first round
after losing a heartbreaking double
overtime game to Washington. 2-1.
The team finished the season ranked
15th. the highest ever finish in Stan
ford men's soccer history, and Clark
was named MPSF Mountain Divi
sion Coach of the Year.
Individual Stanford players also
excelled under the new leadership
and last year more players than ever
in Stanford history were recognized
for their talents.
On the field "I read the situation and
the boys were hungry to work hard,
to be successful." Clark said. "They
had had a tough time in previous
years and were looking for a positive

situation.
First on C lark's list was to instill
discipline in the Stanford players.
"The minute Bobby showed up
there was no question who was in
charge," said senior forward A.J.
Sauer. the captain of this year's
squad. "It was a 180-degree change
from freshman year. We knew we
had tc) be 1 (K) percent dedicated to be
on the men's soccer team — we had
to get fit and be disciplined in our
lives."
In ("lark's first spring on the Farm,
the team spent the bulk of its time to
gether regaining its cardiovascular
base. That summer. Clark outlined a
detailed running program.
The players soon realized that
things were going to be different for
good.
Now, before every practice the
players suit up together, go over the
outline for the day's practice and
then walk over to the field as a team.
"Bobby runs practice the way the
professional club teams in Europe
are run," said Sauer.
Clark's system of hard work and

community, in his three-year tenure on the Farm.
discipline incorporates all of the play
eis on the team, down to the last man
on the bench. Hach player is involved
and everybody is invested in the suc
cesses and failures of the team.
•Whether it's the first player or
the 24th, everyone is on the same
page, doing the same thing as the
starters." said Sauer.
Mann echoed Salter's sentiments.
He made the players believe in
ih -inselves again," Mann said. "He
nave them a clear, defined system of
pla\ and mentally convinced them
thev were good enough to win."
Strategy wise, Clark emphasizes
defense Stanford plays a /one, team
defense and is mainly a counterat
tacking team when playing offense.
I lis line npsare consistent from game
to game and he avoids making drastic
position s\vitches.
"We liase had the same style of
pl iv since Day One." Sauer said.

"There's one system and everyone
believes in it. We know where we
stand with Bobby, there are no ran
dom position changes and no matter
who we play, we always play our
game."
Off the field While Clark added an el
ement of discipline, he did not com
promise the fun aspect of the game.
His players describe the team as a
family, and many look up to Clark as
a father figure.
"I lis style is interactive on and off
the field," said Siegman. "Itsa family
like atmosphere — his wife even
makes us pancakes on game days.
Hobby has helped me mature as a
player and a person."
Most associated with the program
attribute the team's success not only
to Clark's coaching, but his holistic
approach to sports as a lifestyle.
"I lard work, discipline and perse
verance can be used in all walks of
life," said ( lark. "Success doesn't just
happen and there will be setbacks
alonu the way. It there weren't, then

success wouldn't be fun. It's impor
tant to overcome the down times."
Changes within the program In 1995-
96, under Lindores, the soccer team
had only two scholarships at its dis
posal, which severely hampered the
recruiting process. Before the pro
gram was allotted more funding from
the Department of Athletics, most
players came to Stanford because of
its excellent academics — not be
cause of its soccer program.
"I knew Stanford was losing but I
came anyway because of the acade
mics," said Sauer. "Now that the pro
gram is doing well. Stanford will be
that much easier to sell. Every top
notch player in the country wants to
come to Stanford now."
This year, the team has 6.6 schol
arships divided between 10 players
and will receive even more in future
years. The Athletics Department's
confidence in Clark was directly
linked to the increase in the funding
men's soccer received.
"( The Athletics Department] has

faith in Bobby Clark, Stanford soccer
and the potential it has," said Stan
ford Director of Intercollegiate
Sports Earl Koberlein. "Bobby's
knowledge of the game is unbeliev
able and he is a great visionary for the
sport."
This increase has already helped
to recruit the top student-athletes in
the country, like blue-chip freshman
Lee Morrison, who was one of the
highest recruited soccer players in the
country and is now a starter on the
Stanford squad.
Also new to the soccer program
this year is New Maloney Field, the
revamped soccer stadium which has
had lights added. Because games are
now played at night, student atten
dance is up and community support
for the team has skyrocketed.
"It makes Friday nights a special
place," said Bobby Clark. "It gives
students a place to gather — it gives
the local people the opportunity to
come out and see the games. There's
no question that the crowds have
grown since my first year. It's not

even close."
The future of Stanford men's soccer
This year, the pressure is on for
Clark's team to become the first Stan
ford men's soccer team ever to ad
vance to the second round of the
NCAA tournament. So far, the Car
dinal looks on track and is currently
ranked 10th in the nation. The squad
avenged last year's tournament loss
by beating the Washington 2-1 and
also beat then-No. 9 Creighton 2-0.
Reflecting on his time at the Farm,
Clark (105-51-19 career, 23-9-6, .684
at Stanford) is not surprised at the
success of the past seasons. However,
he is not caught up in winning or
records, and he avoids setting specific
goals such as clinching the M PSF title
or winning a national championship.
Instead, his goal each season is always
the same: for each team to play to its
full potential. If his teams do this,
Clark is happy.
"People ask me what season I en
joyed the most at Dartmouth and
they expect me to say the years we

won the Ivy League or the years when
we were the most successful," said
Clark. "But my first year, the only
year I was below ,S(X), was as much
fun because the boys played to their
potential as much as any team had. 1
can't ask for anything more."
Clark wouldn't mind eventually
winning a national championship, but
right now, things are looking pretty
good as they are. His team is doing
well, the Stanford community is be
hind him and most importantly, his
players are happy.
"I don't think we would find a
team in the country who would speak
more highly of their coach than we
do," said Siegman.
One can only imagine what the fu
ture will bring to the Stanford men's
soccer team.
"The future is limitless," said Van
develde. "We have a strong founda
tion and we are the highest-ranked
team in the country with [four] losses.
Bobby Clark has [helped Stanford
gainj the respect of the country after
only three years."
