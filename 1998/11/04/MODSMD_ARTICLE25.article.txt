# Boxer wins after battle
## Matt Fong vows to return 
### Anthony Chiu 
After an intense, heated cam
paign, Democrat Barbara Boxer
scored a relatively easy victory over
Republican challenger Matt Fong
to win re-election to the U.S. Sen
ate.
The campaign had been a hard
fought one throughout the fall, as
Boxer and Fong disagreed on al
most all important issues, including
abortion and gun control.
Polls done close to the election
showed Boxer overtaking Fong in
the final days, leaving them in a sta
tistical dead heat. "It's a close con
test, but we expect to win," Steve
Schmidt, Fong's chief spokesman,
said yesterday afternoon.
However, exit polls allowed
CNN to project Boxer's victory mo
ments after the polls closed at K p.m.
Boxer confirmed this result two
and a half hours later when she
made her way to the podium ac
companied by James Brown's "I
Feel Good."
Once there she praised the state
that decided to keep her in power.
"1 love the California spirit," said
Boxer. "We sometimes disagree,
but what unites us is this beautiful
state of California."
Boxer also addressed her

doubters, who were numerous as
she trailed Fong during the fall.
"They said we couldn't do it, that I
was a fluke of history. They said that
I was too progressive ... too sup
portive of our president ... too
feisty," Boxer said.
"One eolumnist even wrote that
I was too short. But they all missed
something. They missed the deep
support I have in this, the greatest
state in the union. I have this sup
port because we stand together on
the issues. And I am going back to
Washington to work on these is
sues."
A teary-eyed Fong conceded his
defeat about an hour later in a short
speech at around 11:30 p.m. "You
have heard me say throughout this
campaign that it is not important
that we accent our differences but
more important ... that we are all
proud to be Americans."
"It is important that tonight after
these elections that we are not Re
publicans and Democrats, but that
we are Californians and Ameri
cans," said Fong.
Although the state treasurer was
defeated, he pledged not to stay
down for long.
"Tomorrow in America is anoth
er day. Watch out, we're coming
back."
