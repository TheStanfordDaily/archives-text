Voters from all over the state
made their voices heard on Election
Day yesterday. They want Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis to be the next governor
of California.
The Democrat Davis handily
beat his Republican opponent Dan
Lungren, the current attorney gen
eral. In results returned late yester
day evening. Davis received 58 per
cent and Lungren 39 percent of the
vote, with 60 percent of precincts re
porting at 12:15 a.m.
Davis is California's first Democ
ratic governor in 16 years.
"It doesn't get any better than
this," said the governor-elect in his
victory speech from Los Angeles last
night. "Many thanks to all the voters
who put their trust in me at the
polls."
Davis also outlined his vision for
California's future.
"Today we begin a moderate
path to a moderate future," he said.
"We will bring all of the people of
this great state together towards a
common goal."
The Lungren camp also offered
its response to the election results.
"I would like to congratulate
Gray Davis on winning the elec
tion," said Lungren in his concession
speech from Newport Beach yester

day."It is a tremendous achieve
ment of which he should be proud,
and I wish him well over the next
four years."
However, Lungren pointed out
that he will continue to work to
wards the goals he has been fighting
for.
"Our dream does not die just be
cause we lost one fight," he said.
Davis and Lungren had made
their positions well known in a heat
ed campaign that began moments
after the statewide open primary last
June.
"We founded this campaign on
the issues that Californians care
about," said Michael Bustamante,
press secretary for the Davis cam
paign.
Davis built his campaign on the
promises of public school improve
ment, government reform, attacks
on the tobacco industry and a stop to
offshore oil drilling.
He is known for being both pro
choice and pro-death penalty.
Lungren, on the other hand,
stressed family values, the need for
the appointment of judges to en
force street and school safety laws,
education reform and lower taxes.
After votes from all precincts
have been tallied and Davis has been
confirmed as governor-elect, he will
take the oath of office in mid-Janu
ary.
