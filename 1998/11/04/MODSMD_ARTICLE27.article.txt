# Law School alum re-elected to represent Stanford in Assembly
## Lempert trounces Atherly, Bryant 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
With 70.1 percent of the vote as of
midnight. Democratic candidate Ted
Lempert won re-election to the 21st
District of the State Assembly last
night.
Lempert's opponents, Republi
can party member Laverne Atherly
and Natural Law party member Mar
ilyn Bryant received 27.5 percent and
2.4 pcrcent of the total, respectively.
This victory was foreshadowed by
the support shown in the June prima
ry. Lempert said. Statistics show that
he held 6K.6 percent of the vote then,
well ahead of Atherly's 27.7 percent
and Bryant's 3.7 percent.
"I've been working hard to keep
in touch with the district," he said.
"Also, the fact that I received a strong

percentage in June has led to this
being a campaign that wasn't very
hotly contested."
After what campaign manager
Chris Shultz also called a "low-key
campaign," Lempert, Stanford Law
School class of 86, said he will now
have time to focus on the goals he val
ues most, including his primary con
cern: mending public education.
"I'll be continuing the work I've
done over the past couple of years,"
Lempert said. "We'll push for more
support in the area of K through 12
public education, including contin
ued reforms such as the charter
schtx)l bill and improving the current
teacher shortage problem."
Lempert added that though not all
Stanford students arc from this state,
he hopes they would be interested in
improving local education as well.

"Whether the voters are from Cal
ifornia or not, I hope that everyone
would be interested in ensuring the
quality of publie education," he said.
"It affects everyone."
Other areas of concern for Lem
pert include protecting the environ
ment and passing key bills relating to
the Silicon Valley economy, such as
the Internet Tax Freedom Act. which
is designed to guarantee that no new
taxes will be placed on products
bought over the Internet.
Additionally. Lempert chairs the
Higher Education Committee, which
deals with making California colleges
and universities affordable for stu
dents.
"This is an issue of direct interest
to Stanford students," he said.
"Something we work with is the Cal
Grant, which provides support for

students in both private and public
schixils."
Other projects Lempert supports
affect Stanford students indirectly as
well.
"I work to make changes that will
affect the quality of life on campus,
including housing issues, the local en
vironment and transportation."
Atherlv, an employer benefits
consultant, planned to work on es
tablishing a transportation district in
the Bay Area to alleviate some of the
traffic problems, had he been elected.
"I didn't anticipate winning," he
said. "All of the Democrats would
had to have stayed home. I'll just stay
in business as I am now."
These next two years will be the
last chance Lempert has to serve in
the State Assembly due to term lim
its.
