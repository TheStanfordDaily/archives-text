### Erica Platt Contributing writer 
Many people predicted that the
congressional race between incum
bant Democrat Anna Eshoo and
Republican Chris Haugen would
prove to be an easy win for Eshoo.
It was little surprise then, that
Eshoo was re-elected to the House
of Representatives, garnering a
sweeping 69 percent of the votes
over Haugen's 28 percent, with 87
percent of precincts reporting at
12:15 a.m.
Members of the Stanford De
mocrats agreed that Eshoo would
be a clear winner.
"We weren't really worried
about the Eshoo race. It was a pret
ty safe bet she would win," said
Stanford Democrats member
LaNitra Walker, a senior. "People
around here know her policies and
trust her. Instead of worrying
about her race, Eshoo has been at
Democratic headquarters helping
out with Senator Boxer's cam
paign."
Eshoo wants to continue to
work on issues that came before
members of the 105 th Congress,
especially campaign finance re
form and issues concerning man
aged health care. Eshoo worked to
pass the Shays-Meehan reform bill
which would have banned "soft
money," the unlimited and unreg
ulated contributions from corpora

tions, labor unions and wealthy in
dividuals to political party organi
zations.
"The biggest failures of the
105 th Congress were not fully ad
dressing campaign finance reform
and HMO reform," Eshoo told the
lobbying group Common Cause.
"The system is broken, the Ameri
can people know itand we must re
form it. I'm going to go right back
at this issue when the next Con
gress convenes."
Haugen is co-founder and vice
principal of The King's Academy,
a private Christian school in
Mountain View. A mathematics
teacher rather than a career politi
cian, Haugen has strong views on
education.
He believes vouchers should be
available for poor and minority
families who decide the local pub
lic school is unsafe or inadequate.
According to Haugen, parents
should not be forced to put their
children in inferior public schools.
Yesterday, Haugen said that he
would continue his work at The
King's Academy if he was not
elected.
"We're having a big celebration
at The King's Academy tonight
with all the people that helped out
with the campaign," he said. "My
plans for the future really depend
upon what happens at the polls.
Tomorrow, though, I'll certainly
be teaching my classes."
