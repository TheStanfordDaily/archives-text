# 'Governor Body'
## Ventura, Bushes win statehouses 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Bush brothers were elected gover
nor in Texas and Florida Tuesday,
giving the Republican Party con
trol of two of the nation's largest
states, and a former professional
wrestler body-slammed the com
petition in Minnesota.
Jesse "The Body" Ventura,
running under the Reform Party
banner, upset the Republican
mayor of St. Paul, Norm Coleman,
and a Democratic scion. Attorney
General Hubert "Skip"
Humphrey 111.
"Never thought that 'body
slam' would become a literal
phrase in politics," said White
House press secretary Joe Lock
hart.
Calling himself "Governor
Body," Ventura told a rally of sup
porters, "In 1998, the American
Dream lives on in Minnesota as we
shocked the world."
Gov. George W. Bush, a son of
former President Bush, cruised to
re-election in Texas, sure to fuel

talk of a presidential candidacy in
2(NX). Jeb Bush avenged his loss to
the Democrats in 1994, winning the
governorship of Florida.
"Good going, brother," said
George W. Bush.
Two brothers haven't held gov
ernor's offices simultaneously
since Nelson Rockefeller was gov
ernor of New York 1958-73 and
Winthrop Rockefeller was gover
nor of Arkansas 1967-71.
And with George W. Bush lead
ing the nation's second-largest
state and his brother in charge of
the 4th-largest, one of every eight
people in the nation will have a
Bush as governor.
Heading into Tuesday's voting,
the GOP already held the gover
norship in 32 states.
Both parties traded several
seats, especially in hard-fought
contests for open seats.
The current Republican majori
ty is almost the opposite of the
party's gubernatorial strength a
decade ago.
