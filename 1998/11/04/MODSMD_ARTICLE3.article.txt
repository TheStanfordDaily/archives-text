# Liver patient drops injunction request
## 2 months to live; denied a spot on Stanford 's transplant list after positive test for drugs 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
After questions about continued drug use. a
liver patient who was denied a place on Stanford
Hospital's list of eligible donor recipients has
dropped his request for a preliminary injunction,
according to David Scheuerman, the hospital's
lawyer.
Jonothan Harris, who has had an on-and-off
history of drug abuse dating to the 197()5. filed suit
against UCSF-Stanford Health Care last month
after being denied a spot on the waiting list for a
transplant, because d(Ktors were not convinced
he had discontinued his drug use.
Harris, a genealogical historian, lives in Moun
tain View with his wife Karen, who works at Stan
ford, according to court records.
In 1993, doctors diagnosed Harris with liver
disease. Harris' condition has deteriorated and
without the transplant, doctors estimate that Har
ris has less than two months to live, according to
court records.
"We are trying to respect the patient's confi

dentiality as much as we can under the circum
stances," Scheuerman said. "But at the same time
we need to defend the hospital. I larris tested pos
itive for methadone use in one tox screen and an
other one indicated that as late as September of
1998 he was still using. The view expressed by
Harris and his attorney portrays him as a recover
ing addict, which is not true."
In order to enter into the liver transplant pro
gram, Harris was required to sign an abstinence
contract, in which he promised he would "never
again use alcohol or any other drug or im "ca
tion" that had "not been prescribed or appi\ ed
by a Liver Transplant Team physician." I he con
tract further stipulated that "failure to comply
with these recommendations may result in ... re
moval from the list as a transplant candidate."
Harris signed this contract in Max 199<X and,
according to court papers, admitted to doctors on
at least two subsequent occasions that he had
been using drugs.
Harris' attorney, Robin Pou. attempted to
frame Harris' case as matter of dis
crimination. In a complaint filed
with the Santa Clara County Superi
or Court. Pou argued in that Stan
ford "discriminated against [Harris]
due to his past illicit drug use and ad
diction."'
Pou classified drug abuse as a
mental disability and argued that
Stanford violated healthy and safety
codes that prohibit "a hospital from
determining an ultimate recipient of
an anatomical gift based on poten
tial recipient's physical or mental
disability."
Scheuerman stated that Stanford
is not in violation of any regulations
regarding transplants. He also
pointed out that whether drug abuse
is a mental disability or isn't be
comes irrelevant, if Harris is still
using the drugs.
A patient with another life
threatening illness would be
deemed ineligible for a liver trans
plant, Scheuerman explained, and
drug addiction is no different.
" There are a lot of sick patients
and a shortage of organs," Scheuer
man said
Emmet Keeffe, medical director
of the Liver Transplant Program at
Stanford, was unable to comment
on the specifics of the case due to pa
tient confidentiality.
"We afford extensive evaluation
and consideration to each and every
patient who is brought to our atten
tion for transplantation, and we are
obviously very disappointed when
any of our patients or their families
have difficulty accepting the out
come of this sensitive and important
process," Keeffe said in a statement
yesterday.
According to court documents,
an official hearing is scheduled for
February, but Scheuerman said he
thinks it unlikely that 1 larris and his
attorney will pursue the case.
