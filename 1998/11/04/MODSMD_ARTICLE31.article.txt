## The 						ever-changing ecosystem of Stanford's own lake 
### Joanne Wu 
In the midst of the hectic bustle of college life, stu
dents can still find solace in nature right here on cam
pus.
Nestled in the southwest corner of Stanford, Lake
Lagunita provides a setting that inspires recreation,
relaxation and contemplation. Yet heneath its seren
ity, the lake harbors a busy ecosystem of its own.
The man-made lake was originally built by Leland
Stanford to provide irrigation for his vineyards.
Today, one of the major purposes of the lake is to col
lect rainwater that runs off from the foothills in the
winter and spring.
As associate vice provost of facilities, Chris
Christofferson helps oversee the maintenance of
campus grounds.
"The lake is an example of something that started
as a human artifact, but has been in place so long that
it has developed an existing ecosystem that is almost
natural," Christofferson said.
One important inhabitant of the lake, the Califor
nia tiger salamander, is a threatened species that has
been studied at Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology since 1993.
The Big Game Bonfire, which had been a Stanford
tradition since the early 1900s, was voluntarily dis
continued in 1994 by the Axe Committee in order to
protect the safety of the tiger salamander and pre
serve its habitat. Since then, the little creature has

garnered the most attention of any of the Lake Lag
flora or fauna.
Tiger salamanders are usually found in the Central
Valley and the coastal grasslands. They require a cli
mate of cold, wet winters and hot. dry summers, and
their life cycles require a water level that fluctuates
with the seasons. Lake Lag fits the bill.
Rainwater begins to fill Lake Lag in early winter,
when the tiger salamander breeds. The salamander
larvae require an aquatic environment to survive dur
ing their first months of life.
Before the issue of tiger salamander habitat arose,
facilities would allow the lake to dry out naturally in
late spring. In unusually dry seasons, the water level
would be supplemented to make sure the campus
grounds remained in top condition for commence
ment. The salamander's threatened status forced
facilities to adjust its management of the water levels.
Lake Lagunita is kept full through early summer
with water diverted from San Francisquito Creek and
water pumped from wells. This ensures that the sala
mander larvae have time to complete metamorphosis,
which begins in the spring, before the lake dries up.
After metamorphosis, the salamanders can leave
the lake and live terrestrially. In the summer season,
tiger salamanders live in burrows or crevices in the
foothills, emerging again at the next late autumn's
rain.
When it is lull, the water level of Lake Lagunita is
usually maintained at about nine feet at its deepest

part. In earlier years, the lake was kept at higher levels.
Eventually the level had to be lowered to protect the
nearby residences of Roble Hall and Lagunita Court
from flooding. The embankment around the lake was
weakened by the burrowing of ground squirrels, and a
lower water level was required to ensure safety.
However, there is still enough water to allow wind
surfing and wildlife to flourish, at least in the winter
and spring.
Urbanization has further endangered the tiger
salamander population. Many are run over by cars,
washed down storm drains and trapped in utility
boxes and behind barriers such as curbs and side
walks. University land management has become
aware of the problems and has altered practices to
protect the future survival of the threatened species.
"The tiger salamanders are not endangered yet.
but if they do become endangered, it will definitely
limit Stanford development in the lake area, and if
one is killed, it will be a very big deal," said senior
Phoebe Grow, who took a civil engineering course on
Lake Lag last year.
"So they are doing all they can now to protect
them," Grow said.
One example of the current projects involves
bright green pipes used as salamander fences. The
salamanders are too small to crawl over the pipes, so
this keeps them off the parking lots where they might
get run over bv cars.
Christofferson said, "We are involved in measures

77
to try to facilitate the salamander's life cycle-, and we
try to make ihe environment friendly for them."
During the dry season, the bottom of the lakÂ£ bed
used to be plowed to get rid of weeds. Now, due to
concern over salamanders which may still be living in
the soil, the lake bed is mowed instead.
"The management of Lake Lagunita is a complex
issue," said Christofferson. "We try to protect the
salamanders while still allowing a reasonable amount
of recreational use and at the same time maintain a
level of attractiveness."
Research on the tiger salamanders continues at
Stanford in hopes of formulating a long-term conser
vation plan. The impact of weather and reservoir
management practices on the salamander population,
as well as their migration patterns, will be examined
by the Center for Conservation Biology.
New breeding ponds are also being added in the
foothills to encourage the salamanders to breed there
rather than having to cross Junipero Serra Boulevard
to reach the lake. If the California tiger salamander
should become listed under the Endangered Species
Act, then a "Habitat Conservation Plan" would be
adapted from the original plan.
Lake Lagunita, home to animals and humans
alike, has provoked a special fondness in many stu
dents.
Grow said. "I've lived [in housing] near the lake
for three years, and the lake's the only reason 1 keep
coming back."
