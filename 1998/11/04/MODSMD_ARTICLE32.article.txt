## Breast cancer survivors speak from the heart 
### Deanne Corbett 
The message to medical students who gathered to
hear breast cancer survivors tell their stories last Fri
day was clear: Listen to your patients and treat the
whole person with compassion and respect.
Seven women, led by surgeon M. Ellen Mahoney,
co-founder and medical director of the Palo Alto
based Community Breast Health Project, spoke as
part of a regular lecture series offered at the Medical
School.
The lecture series, called "Women and Health." is
in its 23rd year and is open to both graduate and
undergraduate students.
The women shared their stories to educate the
future doctors in the room about the impact a diag
nosis of breast cancer has on a woman's life.
"Breast cancer strikes a woman on every level of
her life. It strikes body image, your future dreams,
your athleticism, sexuality, enjoyment of food, life,
sex. love, and it threatens relationships," said
Mahoney in her opening comments. She was explain
ing the reason the Community Breast Health Projeet.
now in its fifth year of operation, was created. The
project has 2,(KK) members, a $500,000 operating bud
get and more than 170 regular volunteers.
As a surgeon. Mahoney said she perceived her
patients' needs went beyond what she could offer
them. Women with breast cancer need counselign
referral services and information on how to cope with
caring for a family while recovering from chemother
apy. Working women need to know how to deal with
job discrimination and employers who aren't sympa
thetic to a patient's treatment needs.
"All these things were not medical, yet they were
all things my patients needed to get well," said
Mahoney.
The Community Breast Health Project was the
solution, and is now a place where patients and fami
lies can go for counseling and information about the
services they need. The project also offers a program
that provides funding for low-income women under
40 who are uninsured for breast cancer screening.
Friday's speakers all volunteer at the Community
Breast Health Project. They were a diverse group
ranging in age, occupation and cultural background.
Jane told of her agonizing struggle to make her
doctor listen to her concerns about the lumps and
other changes she noticed in her breasts. She felt that
the more she pushed for treatment, the more he
pushed back.
"He told me that 1 was overreacting. The whole
experience taught me that I was wrong," she said.
Darlene spoke about choosing a course of treat
ment after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She
commented on the irony of having to make an irre
versible. life-changing decision based on a mere l H)
minutes of consultation with doctors.
The Community Breast Health Project is current
ly looking for more volunteers. For more informa
