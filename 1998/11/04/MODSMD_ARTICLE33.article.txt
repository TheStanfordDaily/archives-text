## Study investigates effect of media on teen drinking 
### David Lin 
Television may be introducing more than just vio
lence into teenagers' lives. A team of Stanford
researchers has shown that teenagers who watch more
television and music videos are more likely to drink
alcohol.
Released Monday by the American Academy of
Pediatrics, this study was the first of its kind published
in the United States. By demonstrating a key link
between media portrayals of alcohol and alcohol use
among teens, the report may intensify the current
debate over the media's effects on teen behavior.
Data was collected over 18 months between 1994
and 1996. The federally funded study followed the
drinking habits of high school freshmen and measured
their exposure to four types of media: television, music
videos, videotaped programs and video games.
The study found that for every additional hour of
television that a teenager watches per day, he or she is
9 percent more likely to begin drinking alcohol. Every
additional hour of music videos watched resulted in a 31
percent increase in risk. On the other hand, additional
exposure to videotapes correlated with a 11 percent
decrease in risk per hour watched, while exposure to
computer games had no effect.
According to Thomas Robinson, assistant professor
of pediatrics at the Stanford Medical School and co
author of the study, the study was unique because it pre
sented the first evidence for a cause-and-effect relation
ship between media and teenage drinking— a relation
ship that has been long suspected but never proved.
Researchers first began measuring the levels of
drinking and media exposure among high school fresh
men in October 1994. Researchers then returned 1S
months later to determine if there were any changes.
By measuring levels of teen drinking at two different
points in time, the study tried to establish what Robin
son termed a "temporal sequence" of events. This is
analogous to the proverbial riddle of determining which
came first, the chicken or the egg. By determining the
order in which they occurred, one could look for a pos
sible cause fleet relationship between the chicken and
the egg. Likewise, the study attempted to determine
whether high media exposure preceded the onset ol
teen drinking or vice versa, and whether a cause-and
effect relationship between media and drinking was
p» tssible.
In addition, researchers found that while media
exposure is linked to teens beginning to drink, there is
not necessarily a link between media exposure and con
tinued drinking. These data agree with behavioral theo
ries that predict that teens with no prior drinking expe
rience would be more influenced by media portrayals of
alcohol than teens who had already begun to drink.
Robinson cautioned that the evidence is not conclu
sive proof that the media encourages teenage drinking.
"Without conducting an experiment, we can never
prove it in humans." he said.
Helen Chen, another co-author of the study, added
that the data only supports "a significant association
between television and music video viewing with the
onset of drinking. It's just one factor [influencing teen
drinking], and it's by no means the only factor."

C hen noted that the next step would be to set up a
study to how the media affects underage drinking —
whether it is the alcohol portrayal itself or media expo
sure in general that leads to teen drinking.
The results of this study are likely to intensify the
current debate over how to curtail teen alcohol use in
the United States, which many consider to be a serious
public health issue.
According to data cited in the study, 25 percent of
eighth-grade students report drinking alcohol in the
past month, as well as 39 percent of l()th-graders and 51
percent of 12th-graders.

Robinson argues for action to reduce the impact of.
the media on teens. "It disappoints me that the hard|
liquor industry is starting to advertise," he said in refer-j
ence to the industry's recent repeal of its voluntary ban;
on television advertising. He called it "a step in the
wrong direction."
Robinson, a former Stanford undergraduate and
medical school graduate, led the study team, which also*
consisted of Chen, now with the Stanford Learning Lab.<
and Joel Killen, associate research professor at the.
Stanford Medical School and the Stanford Center fori
Research in Disease Prevention.
