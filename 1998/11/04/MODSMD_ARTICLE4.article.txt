## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
The legal voting age may be 18, but last night
thousands of children nationwide had the chance
to take part in the 1998 election by participating in
Kids Voting, an initiative that Stanford In Gov
ernment volunteers helped to facilitate in Palo
Alto.
Kids Voting is a national, non-profit, non-par
tisan, grassroots organization founded on the
premise that an informed electorate is an effective
electorate, according to Sigrid Pinsky, head of the
steering committee for the League of Women
Voters in Palo Alto.
The League of Women Voters, under the lead
ership of co-director Mary Cottrell, took on the
Kids Voting project in full force for the first time
this year in hopes of "encouraging parents to
bring their children with them when they vote,"
Pinskv said.

At present, forty states and the District of Co
lumbia participate in Kids Voting, an initiative
that began over 10 years ago. As well as the mock
vote, the program brings local politicians into
schools.
" The purpose is to educate America's youth
about their important role in democracy, while in
stilling in them a fundamental awareness that will
make them lifetime voters." Pinsky said.
Pinsky coordinated the SICi volunteers with
the help of junior David Felman, an assistant di
rector of SlCi's Community Outreach Commit
tee.
Amitav Misra, co-director of SKi's Communi
ty Outreach Committee, was one of the volun
teers last night.
"I think this is a really great way to promote
civic awareness and engagement." Misra said.
Twenty-seven SIC i members helped to run the
Kids Voting polls yesterday at vari
ous Palo Alto elementary schools
and churches.
Kids Voting participants ranged
from ages live to 17 nationwide.
Among them was six-year-old
Matthew Nass.
"That was fun," said Nass after
filling out his ballot. "Now I'm gonna
go help my dad vote."
"I think (the Kids Voting pro
gram] is great," said Communication
Prof. Cliff Nass, Matthew's father.
"The research says it really does have
effect," Nass said, after explaining to
his son which candidate was "actual
ly the good guy" and that a governor
is someone who wants to be "the boss
of that state."
Matthew fell in the first age cate
gory for voting, kindergarten
through third grade, which asks the
kids to vote for governors given a pic
ture and the name of each candidate.
Children in grades three through six
vote for governors, senators and con
gressman. while grades seven
through 12 filled out the full ballot.

"It's really a positive experience
for kids to get excited about going
into the real election place on the real
day," Pinsky said.

According to Pinsky, 300,(XX) kids
in Santa Gara County participated in
the 1996 Kids Voting election. The
results are tabulated this week.
