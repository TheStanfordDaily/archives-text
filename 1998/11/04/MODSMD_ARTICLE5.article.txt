## Centers add new programs 
### Sylvia Lin 
Matching new developments in the
Merlin and Kyoto programs, four over
seas studies centers are implementing
new changes and improvements.
The programs in Paris. Oxford, Flo
rence and Santiago have announced re
forms in an attempt to enhance the stu
dent experience alnoad for the next aca

domic yenr including adding new class
es. new activities and new quarters.
Paris center looking ahead to 1999
Estelle Halevi. director of the Paris
program, is looking forward to three
major changes. First, for the first time
the center will offer courses on theater,
especially the works of the great French

authors Moliere and La Fontaine.
Second, all course work including
written assignments will he in French.
"Up until now. Professors have
taught in French, hut students have been
able to submit their papers in English,"
said Halevi. "We are certain that stu
dents will rise to the challenge and will
benefit from the experience."
Third, on Jan. 1, 12 European
countries, including France, will be
united by a single currency.
"This event will have not only
major economic consequences for
France and the other participating
countries, but social, political and
cultural ones as well," Halevi said.
"Students will be able to witness
first-hand this revolutionary devel
opment" through two new courses,
one 011 the economics and another
on the political and social issues of
the change.
Oxford will offer fewer classes
Despite being the most popular
program, enrolling close to 90 stu
dents in the autumn, Oxford pro
gram director Geoffrey Tyack isn't
expecting any new courses to be
added to the curriculum despite
the growing interest in the Oxford
program.
"We've been asked by Overseas
Studies to reduce the number of
our classes for the 1999-2(XX) acad
emic year," Tyack said.
Some classes have too few stu
dents to justify continuing them, he
explained, while other, more popu
lar classes on art and theater lure
most of the students.
Aside from classes, Tyack is
hoping to see numbers grow in the
internship division.
"We offer human biology in
ternships, but so far no student has
done them. I'd like to expand this
part of our program in the future if
possible," said Tyack.

The attraction of studying at
Oxford draws twice as many appli
cants as there are spaces. Tyack,
however, would prefer to admit
fewer students, hut have them stay
for two quarters.
Multiple quarter stays, he said,
would provide a richer experience
and open up longer-term research
opportunities.
Stephanie Buell, a sophomore
hoping to go to Oxford next year,
can't understand the eagerness of
students to return hack to the
home campus.
"I'd stay for two quarters, so I
can really allow myself to sink into
the culture. I'd also like to give my
self time to travel around England
and Europe."
Tyack would also like to im
prove the residential situation at
Oxford.
Currently, students live in one
house with all other Stanford in
Oxford students. He said he hopes
to integrate Stanford and Oxford
student housing.
"I think there are definite pros
and cons to this situation. First,
with the British students, it would
he great to compare the novelty of
the experience," Buell said. "It's
fun, though, to he with Stanford
students whom you know that you
have a common background with
and whom you can go back to the
home campus with and share this
common bond."
Florence announcing new activities
The increasing number of appli
cants to the Stanford in Florence
program has been one of the main
reasons Overseas Studies has been
expanding rapidly in recent years.

Linda Campani, director of the
Florence program, reported that
over 50 applicants apply each quar
ter and usually, only 30 to 35 are ac
cepted, an increase from the 15 to
20 applicants five years ago.
Maisie Tsui, a sophomore cur
rently taking classes in Florence,
raved about the interests and expe
riences that Florence has to offer.
For this quarter, the program has
added course offerings in cooking
and art, as well as hiking ;ind biking
day trips and athletic classes at the
University of Florence.
Tsui stated that one of the most
popular extracurricular activities
recently implemented in Florence
allows Stanford students to teach
English to Italians, ranging in age
from 20 to 65 years-old.
"Not only does the experience
allow students to meet Italians and
learn the language better, but it
also allows students to better grasp
the fundamentals of English," said
Tsui.
Santiago expanding
Growing steadily since the
opening in 1990, the Stanford in
Santiago program is expanding
from two to three quarters.
This expansion "creates new,
exciting opportunities for students,
since for the first time it will be pos
sible to attend courses at some of
the best Chilean universities, to
gether with Chilean students," said
Edmundo Fuenzalida, director for
the Stanford in Santiago program.
Before this expansion, conflicts
in academic calendars did not per
mit the interaction between the
C hilean students and Stanford visi
tors.
