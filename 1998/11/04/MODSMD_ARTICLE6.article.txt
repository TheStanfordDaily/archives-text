### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
John I.e ('ai re, formei y and best selling novel
ist,shared his dark perspective of human nature and
the Cold War with the Stanford community in a
Monday evening reading and a colloquium held yes
terday morning.
Le Carre opened the reading with a brief bio
graphical sketch.
"If childhood is the balance of the writer, then 1
was born a millionaire. I just had a bottomless well
of wonderful experiences," he said.
Le Carre attending boarding schools in England
between the ages of five and 16. and then traveled to
Germany. He next entered military service in Eng
land. where, as a result of his language abilities, he
was placed in what he referred to as "the bizarre
world of military intelligence."
11 is stint in the secret world influenced the type of
novels that he would come to write.
"I was a fly on the wall of the secret world," he
said. "Once inside the loony bin [of the secret ser
vice] you develop inside-out thinking, which is won
derful for a novelist."
Le Carre is famous for his spy novels set during
the Cold War. "My thesis." said 1 jc Carre of his nov
els, "is how much can you do in protection of a de
cent society and ensure that the society remains
worth protecting?"
"I believe," he said, "that secret
institutions reflect the unconscious
of a nation."
Le Carre's critical view of human
nature, reflected in his work, was ev
ident during the colloquium. "I be
lieve," he said, "that relationships
are false and transitory. There is no
such thing as a full and frank ex
change of views without blows."
Le Carre said that his similarly
dark view of the Cold War was con
firmed by his visit to the Soviet
Union in 1987.
"The first thing I noticed was that
the country didn't work. I'm certain
that they were never able to conduct
the type of war that the CIA credit
ed them with. In far more ways than
we realized [the Cold War] was a
war of conflicting illusions."
Shifting from the underlying
message of his work, Le Carre ad

mitted that his literary characters are
inspired by real people. "One
doesn't actually use people, at least
not in the raw form that you find
them. You must charge them with
your own humanity, bitterness "
he said.
Le Carre said his personal experi
ence on the night the Berlin Wall
was constructed gave him the neces
sary vision to write "The Spy That
Came in From the Cold."
Le Carre was in Germany on the
night when barbed wire was first
raised across checkpoints in occu
pied Germany. He said that it was a
"crazy time" during the days imme
diately after the raising of the wall.
"I didn't sleep for two days, and
we roared around trying to get peo
ple out while they could still get out."
As a result of these experiences
Le Carre said, "I had an absolute vi
sion in which I wanted to dramatize
the ramparts of the new Cold War
being formed in the ashes of the old
war and express a kind of ideological
despair at this new war."
