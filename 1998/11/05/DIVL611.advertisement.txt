We believe for the Information Age to make a genuine difference, it has to spark
the next generation. From Belfast to the Belgian Congo to Buenos Aries, computers
must be universally accessible if the world is to be a universally better place.
We also believe that the Internet changes everything. That's why we developed
Oracle 8/ - Internet technology that's changing everything!
Come change with us.
