# A 						"buzzing and blooming" world
## Gould speaks on mixing disciplines

The reinforcement of arbitrary
boundaries between academic disci
plines has hurt both art and science,
evolutionary biologist and paleon
tologist Stephen Jay Gould told an
audience of over 1 .(MX) at the Science
and Engineering Quad last night.
Faced with what philosopher
William James called the "buzzing
and blooming" of the world around
us, we proceed to categorize the
chaos, said Gould, the Alexander
Agassiz Professor of Zoology and
Professor of Geology at Harvard
University.
"Academics do the same catego
rization by departments... [lending
them) an eternal status. These cate
gories are false, arbitrary and detri
mental; [yet], we need to justify
these categories once we make
them," he said.
The need for justification com
pels people to search for a kind of
"naturalness" to the boundaries
they create.
Gould said that we have yet to
complete the Darwinian Revolu
tion.
He quoted Freud in saying that
scientific revolutions not only recon
struct the physical universe, but also
"knock human arrogance off one
pedestal after another."
By persisting in the belief that
evolution is the storv of linear

progress and increasing complexity,
we haven't yet come to terms with
the Darwinian Revolution. Gould
said.
"We [cling to] that comfort
again. We don't complete Darwin's
revolution." he said.
Gould suggested that most peo
ple find comfort in certainty, and
that this affiinity for certainty could
be diminished by promoting inter
disciplinary studies.
"Paleontology should have
begun in the history departments."
Gould said, emphasizing the role of
historical contingency in providing
intellectual tools with which to
"smash pedestals."
Recalling physicist Ernest
Rutherford's epithet that paleontol
ogists "are a bunch of stamp collec
tors," Gould said that if it is believed
that nature presents us with ready
made distinctions, then it is quite
true that the role of a taxonomist
"couldn't be duller."
However. Gould said, the tax
onomer is a collector and an origina
tor of theories of order that may be
right or wrong—nature's categories
do not surface naturally.
Gould used five examples from
history to demonstrate the ways in
which arbitrary categorization has
hindered problem-solving.
Gould presented an example

text of science to be resolved." Gould
explained that Edgar Allen Poe,
known for "Fall of the House of
Usher" and"The Raven," among
other works, also wrote a hook on
mollusks. Poe described both their
shells and their soft bodies. Previous
ly, the English taxonomy of mollusks
had focused exclusively on describing
shells.
Poe's motivations for writinu a

book on the taxonomy of mollusks
battled scholars for decades, yet it
turns out that Poe was commissioned
to write the book because descrip
tions of mollusk soft bodies were
found in French, and he knew that
language.
Thus the mysterious fact of Poe's
scientific writing can be explained by
knowing the history of taxonomy.
