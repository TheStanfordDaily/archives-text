## Republicans talk of quicker impeachment hearings 
### 
. WASHINGTON (AP) —Blindsided by midterm election setbacks.
Hou>t; Republicans talked Wednesday of quickly wrapping up impeach
ment proceedings against President Clinton and raised the prospect of chal
lenges to Speaker Newt Gingrich or other party leaders.
; "L,pok, I'm the speaker, so I'll take responsibility." Gingrich said at a
morning-after news conference as the names of potential challengers began
to circulate. "We should probably have aggressively pushed cutting taxes
and saving Social Security much harder than we did this year."
> A], the same time, the Georgia Republican spoke dismissively of any
challenge to his own leadership. I think the people who normally are quot
ed" in This are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower base

with fewer members," he said.
House Democrats held a pep rally at which they depicted Tuesday's
returns as a step on the road to reclaiming a majority in two years.
" This is a repudiation of trying to run a campaign without issues and
their obsession with impeachment." said Dick Gephardt, the House Demo
cratic leader. "They spent $110 million more than we did and still lost."
Gingrich sidestepped a question of whether the House should be called
into special session to consider the impeachment issue, or wait until the
106 th Congress is sworn in next year.
But Rep. David Dreier. R-Calif., the incoming chairman of the House
Rules Committee, said the likelihood of completing action on the issue this

year is "very very great... I think the election has played a role in ensuring
that," he said in an interview on CNN.
Another Republican House member, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the election pushes the issue toward a resolution that
Clinton can live with — such as "some 'censure-plus' punishment."
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to begin hearings this
month, and the panel's chairman. Illinois Rep. Henry Hyde, issued a state
ment saying, "Our duty has not changed because the Constitution has not
changed." Public opinion polls, including one taken of voters yesterday,
showed widespread disapproval for congressional handling of the impeach
ment issue.
