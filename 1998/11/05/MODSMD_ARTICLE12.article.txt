,-iCHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) — Ten-year
old, Norlan Javier Ocejo screamed in pain as a nurse
lifted him onto his hospital bed. The open wounds

slide in northwest Nicaragua packed a hospital in C'hi
naudega after being rescued from the region where as
piafw as 2.(KX) people were killed when soggy earth,
trees and rocks came crashing down the side of a vol
cano.
"Part of the 4.610-foot C'asitas volcano's crater eol-
Japised, and water from its swollen lake cascaded down
the face. About 30 square miles was transformed into
an'eerie desert-like landscape, strewn with rotting
corpses caked with mud.

0f.400 bodies found in a village called La Flor. said I )i.
Juan Jose Guadamuz, who tended to the injured in a
Sesame seed packing house transformed into a shelter
in Posoltega. 10 miles southeast of C hinandega.
■■j Guadamuz said the rescue workers told him 30 vil
lagers were still alive and had survived by eating dogs
and pigs, which were feeding on human bodies. I lie
slirvivors told rescuers they did not want to leave their
homes for fear that what little they had left would be
stolen.
'•' Rescuers went out again Wednesday to search for
stirvivors. but hope was running out for anyone left
aliVe after five davs without food or water.

Central American officials say more than 9,000

LONDON (AP) — A block of postage stamps
thought to be among the world's oldest is for sale in
Britain for $4.5 million.
Ihe 4<S mint-condition Twopenny Blues, which
bear the image of Queen Victoria, were issued in IS4O.
But they were forgotten for more than a century until
the Duke of Buceleuch's staff discovered them in 1945
inside an old leather writing set.
Dealers say the price is the highest ever asked for
stamps. A single Swedish postage stamp, dating from
1X55. was sold <n an auction in 19% for $2.2 million,
making it the most expensive stamp ever sold, accord
ing to the (iuinness Book of Records.
But that could be eclipsed h\ the Twopenny Blue,
which is extremely rare in large blocks.
As the largest-known block of the world's first issue
of postage stamps, the set should attract collectors,
investors and speculators, said Andrew Norris, man
aging director of Argyll Etkin. a stamp dealer.
Ii is thought the set was originally bought by the
late Walter Francis. Duke of Buccleuch. to use on his
household mail. The stamps were issued May 6. IS4O
and have since become a great gem of philately. The
second largest block of Twopenny Blues is owned by
Queen Elizabeth 11.
