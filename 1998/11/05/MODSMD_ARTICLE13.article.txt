# $5-million bounty for terrorist
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —Exiled
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden
was charged Wednesday with mas
terminding the embassy bombings
in East Africa and authorities
offered a record $5 million reward
for his capture.
A federal indictment charged bin
Laden and Muhammad Atef. the
military commander of bin Laden's
alleged terrorist organization, with
conspiracy in the Aug. 7 bombings
at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dares Salaam, Tanzania.
Twelve Americans were among the
224 people killed.
The indictment portrayed bin
Laden as the director of a powerful
terrorist organization with roots in
several countries. His influence
even reached a Brooklyn office that
provided aid to refugees from the
war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, it
said.
The conspiracy charges filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan
alleged that the embassy attacks
were the culmination of a terrorist
campaign that had escalated since
1992.
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White
said bin Laden kept increasing his
hateful rhetoric until February

when he directed Muslims "to kill
Americans anywhere in the world
they can be found."
"In a greater sense, all of the cit
izens of the world are also victims
whenever and wherever the cruel
and cowardly acts of international
terrorism strike." White said. "And
it is up to the authorities of the
world to respond vigorously and
unrelentingly to such terrorist acts."
Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant direc
tor in charge of the FBl's New York
office, said the men were being
tracked down by the largest contin
gent of agents his agency had ever
sent abroad to investigate a crime.
Hut he conceded that everything
the FBI could do along with the $5-
million reward — the largest ever
offered by the State Department
might not be enough to track down
bin Laden, who is believed to be liv
ing in Afghanistan.
"There's no doubt he has the
resources to stay hidden." Schiliro
said.
If convicted, bin Laden and Atef
could face the death penalty.
U.S. law provides for the trial in
the United States of those charged
in terror attacks against American
citizens, even if carried out on for

eign soil. Two other suspects in the
bombings were sent to the United
States because Kenya was wary that
a trial in the African nation might
invite new terrorist assaults.
I he indictment also charges four
other men with participating in bin
Laden's organization.
Bin Laden's targets allegedly
included members of the U.S. mili
tary in Saudi Arabia and Somalia as
well as Americans employed at the
two bombed U.S. embassies in
Africa.
The indictment alleged that bin
Laden and his terrorist group, al
Qaeda, forged alliances with repre
sentatives of the government of
Iran, with the National Islamic
Front in Sudan and with an Iranian
terrorist group, Hezbollah.
Prosecutors say bin Laden's
organization acted on its own as well
as through other terrorist organiza
tions operating under its umbrella.
Prosecutors identified the other
terrorist organizations as Al Jihad,
an Egypt-based Islamic group led at
one time by Sheik Omar Abdel-
Rahman. and a number of Al Jihad
groups in other countries, including
the Sudan, Egypt. Saudi Arabia,
Yemen and Somalia.
