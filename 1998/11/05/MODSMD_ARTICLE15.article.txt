## Editorial Less food, less waste

Students should consider
the real-world impact of
their dining-hall habits

UNIVERSITY DININC Services'
plans to cut costs by preparing less
food ;it meals will bring much
needed efficiency to the dining halls. With
out a commitment from students, however,
the spirit of the effort will result in little
change.
I Inder the new program, cooks will pre
pare quantities depending on the numbers
ol students who actually show up at meals
rather than estimating numbers. I his strat
egy, by avoiding excessive amounts of wast
ed food, makes sense economically and
ecologically. Stanford students will also
benefit directly through the controlled cost
of meal plans.
I he change, however, will also result in
reducing the number of meals Spoon
Hunger Relict has historically provided to
the underprivileged members of the Palo
Alto community through the Urban Min
istry. Ihe massive quantity Spoon collected
last year, over 25,000 pounds of food, testi
fies to the difficulty university kitchens have
had in accuratcK predicting the appropriate
amount ol food to prepare.
We agree with Assoc. Director ol 1 lous
ing and I )ining Services Shirley Everett that
Dining Services has a commitment to serve
its students on meal plans. It would be
wrong to meet the needs of a charitable
organization such as Spoon by "sacrificing
the quality of the service" provided to Stan
lord students.
At the same time, this situation illumi
nates the disparities so evident between the
Stanford lifestyle and that outside. A signif
icant source ol the waste that produced in
the dining halls is the consequence of stu
dents taking too much food and then throw
ing it awav.
According to Dining Services' research,
at each meal, a dining hall comparable to

Wilbur throws out about 320 pounds of
food — enough to feed a family for a
month.
Students clearly should play their part in
helping to minimize dining waste by taking
only wh;it they need. We always have the
opportunity for seconds. In addition, stu
dents should adhere to the limits of their
meal plans and not "steal" food from halls.
By doing this, kitchens will better be able to
accomodate their patrons. From a self-serv
ing perspective, doing so will also keep
board bills down and food quality high.
Dining Services also plans to reduce
waste by reusing uneaten food. While some
students will no doubt complain about find
ing elements of Monday's main dish in
I uesday's soup, there are clearly more
important issues at hand. Students should
understand that Dining Services takes qual
ity into account. Its new program aims to
improve food quality and freshness by
preparing smaller quantities closer to serv
ing time. And while this may require
reusing a few ingredients, student coopera
tion will result in an overall improvement at
mealtime.
Dining Services will continue to donate
whatever leftovers are available, but the
bulk of surplus food donations will now
shift to the individually operated food ser
vices of the Faculty Club, Special Events,
loyon Eating Clubs and the Row. We
encourage the kitchens that have not yet
joined the Spoon program to commit to
participate now that Stanford's main dining
halls will no longer be able to help as exten
sively.
Finally, while before the consequences
of Dining Services' extravagance provided
students a passive means to perform public
service, there are many other ways to sup
port local people in need.
We encourage greater active participa
tion in service organizations such as Spoon,
Habitat for Humanity and the numerous
other groups working through the Haas
Center. And we challenge Stanford stu
dents to consider each day the impact of
their lives on the world beyond Palm Drive.
