## Instant Messenger and me 
### 
I'M A BIG fan of the
Internet. Though I
wasn't one of the first
to get on the Information
Superhighway (I didn't
have e-mail until senior
year of high school), when
I finally jumped into

cyberspace, I leapt. I vaulted into a new
electronic consciousness that has since
defined my very being. With the Internet, I
went in search of information, recreation
and communication; instead (blare of trum
pets). I found myself.
Okay. Enough is enough. Honestly. I still
don't know what the heck I'm doing here.
I'm as lost as I was the day I moved into Flo
Mo freshman year. I haven't found the
meaning of life in the Internet — yet. But I
do have Instant Messenger!
You've all seen Instant Messenger. You
may know it as ICO or y-talk (for those of
you UNIX fiends hunkered in Sweet Hall),
but it's the same basic principle: live chat
ting with your "buddies" via the Internet.
It's a beautiful concept for a beautiful
world. And I'm in on the ground floor,
baby.
Instant Messenger is comprised of a tiny,
annoying little window that sits in the cor
ner of your computer desktop. You delin
eate "buddies" (presumably people with
whom you would occasionally like to chat)
and are notified when they come on line. In
a best-case scenario, you and a far-off
buddy, on line at the same time, enter a pri
vate chat and go hog-wild at your respective
keyboards, maintaining effective communi
cation despite your physical separation.

More often that not, you find yourself
trapped in a chat with your neighbor down
the hall, engaged in deep, probing conversa
tions littered with phrases like, "What's
up?" and "So ... done your problem set?"
It's a far from ideal use of Instant Messen
ger, but much like e-mail, it's less treacher
ous than risky, real-life interaction. So, chat
away, my Stanford friends. Relish in the
ease of non-committal interaction.
I admit that I'm a fan of chatting. I
taught my family how to use Instant Mes
senger before I left home and often find
Mom or Dad on line. "Hi, Mom," I'll some
times write, "How are you?" "Hi, sweetie,"
she responds, "Fine."
We quickly tire of this, and proceed to
ignore each other until she logs off, but the
brief moment we spend together is made
possible only because of the Internet and
Instant Messenger.
You may remember Gram, my grand
mother, from last week's column. Though
she readily admits to a technological igno
rance (well, she probably wouldn't admit to
it, but I will on her behalf), she too, has
entered the Instant Messenger fray. She
always logs on with Mom at her side, but the
Internet conversations she and I share are
unique and heartwarming.
"Hi, Gram," I'll write, "How are you?"
"Fine. Johnny," she responds, "Just check
ing stocks. Talk to you soon. Love, Gram."
Meaningful family interaction aside.
Instant Messenger is perhaps at its best
when used in its primary capacity: pure
recreation. With my friends and family log
ging on nearly all the time, there is little else
for me to do but sit at my computer and

wait for the next message to arrive. As I
drum my fingers on the desk, aching for that
pop-up window and the reinforcing "beep"
of a new message, I cannot help hiit thank
Instant Mess :nger. Since paying off the $80
in-room connection fee, I have lowered my
phone bill, protected my vocal chords and
improved my typing speed, all in the'name
of effective, worthwhile conversation.
Remaining indoors, glued to my npjpitor, I
have avoided the dangerous effects of
unprotected sun exposure (and unprotected
anything else, for that matter). Begjuse of
you. Instant Messenger, I've becowfri bet
ter man. »"•
V
They say most college learning Comes
not from lectures but from midnight con
versations with friends. I couldn'f agree
more. My Stanford experience has truly
been defined by those times I've stayed up
late, neglecting homework to sit in the hall
with my laptop and chat with Instant Mes
senger buddies. As we've created incredible
conversations in our 240-character message
limit, we have also established online rela
tionships that will stand the test of time
(Instant Messenger's unique account sys
tem guarantees screen names for life).
I've been blessed with many things in
college, among them a Stanford education,
beautiful surroundings, and a few pleasant
acquaintances. But I'm luckier still with the
buddies I've made via my in-room connec
tion. Oh thank you. Instant Messenger.
