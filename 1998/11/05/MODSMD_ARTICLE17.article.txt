Candidates not pro-child
In the Nov. 2 Daily articles on Sen. Bar
bara Boxer and then l.t. Ciov. (iray Davis,
both candidates were shown to support a
wide variety of measures to improve the sit
uation of citizens, especially of young peo
ple: child safety locks on handguns, protec
tion of the environment, funding for ele
mentary and higher education. A quote
from Boxer's campaign literature said that
"education is the key to every child's future
success."
Reading further into the articles, I was
caught short by what semed to be a contra
diction: both candidates also advocated
abortion on demand. Was this consistent
with their concern for peace, justice and
"every child's future success"?
On the same evening as the country pre
pared for Election Day. Serrin Foster of
Feminists for Life came to Stanford to dis
cuss the inherent contradictions of such a
platform.

A growing number of women are begin
ning to question the tacit assumptions of the
women's movement and work toward a
feminism based on non-violence and abso
lute respect for the human person, whether
male or female, born or unborn.
Pioneering feminist Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, writing under the shadow of the
American slave trade, was opposed to abor
tion tor just this reason: "When we consider
how women are treated as property, it is
degrading to women that we treat our chil
dren as property to be disposed of as we see
fit."
Since the passage of Roe v. Wade 25
years ago. one out of every three children
has had his or her life deliberately ended. I
find it particularly poignant that half of all
abortions kill young women. Where are the
ones who would be fighting for equal pay?
(As I write this in late 1998. a woman still
earns less than 75 percent of a man's wage
for an equivalent job.) Where are the ones
who would be finding a cure for breast can

cer and other diseases neglected by the
medical establishment?
Where are the ones who would be bring
ing a much-needed voice to the academic
world? Where are the poets, the singers, the
quantum physicists, the saints?
Society is still marked by the exploita
tion of women and children, and this has
hardly changed for the better since the
advent of abortion on demand. Mahatma
Gandhi and countless civil-rights activists
have shown that violence, no matter how
heinous and widespread, can never be
stopped with further acts of violence. The
tragic events of the past weeks have made
that clear: young lives taken by an abortion
ist, who is in turn killed by a fanatical dis
penser of vigilante "justice," who is in turn
threatened with the death penalty by angry
citizens.
Our generation, the two-thirds of our
generation still living, must break this pat
tern if humanity is to survive intact. Femi
nists must give a resounding "no" to vio

lence and death in all its guises.

UCLA more fun, diverse
I went to UCLA for a year before trans
ferring to Stanford, so I must stand up for it
and point the fallacies in Brittney Jensen's
Nov. 4 column. Fewer than 30 percent of
students are in the Greek system, and
there's plenty of social stuff going on out
side of it. Being in a fraternity or sorority is
not a "requirement," unless your only con
ception of social life is a homogeneous
white blob.
I was a social king and had plenty of fun
without being in a fraternity. The vibrancy
and span of things going on at UCLA —
from speakers and concerts to films, from
rallies and parties to an enormous and
diverse student body — puts this quiet little

campus to shame. Prospectives, don't make
the mistake I did of thinking that academics
are more important than experience and
having fun. Go Bruins!

Senior, history
Ops page necesssary ;
Thomas Robertson's letter in Monday's
Daily was completely unwarranted. The
Daily is a forum for student discussion.
Robertson may not find this discourseinter
esting or relevant to him, but that does not
make the authors "egoists." In fact, if any
thing, it is Mr. Robertson who is the egoist
here, calling on others to screen their Views
to suit his taste. The Daily must remain,
"fluff and all, the voice of the people.
