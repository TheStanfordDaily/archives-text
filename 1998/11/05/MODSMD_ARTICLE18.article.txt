AS A CALIFORNIA table grape worker. I urge all Stan
lord students to vote lor grapes in their residence halls and
reject the boycott.
â–  *
farm workers oppose the boycott because an effective one
would threaten our jobs and the businesses of farmers. Farm work
ers also believe that the I Jnited Farm Workers. MLChA and other
aqUxist organizations have misled the general public about our
working and living conditions for many years.
.} am treated well by my employer; 1 make a good wage, and 1
health insurance. Many farm workers own their own homes,
tfcejr own cars and have kids in college. ( alifornia law requires that
we have clean, sanitary portable toilet facilities at the ratio of one
per. 20 workers in the field. We also have clean hand-washing facil
ities and drinking water at or exceeding legal levels.
, , It is important to understand that the UFW does not actively
pursue the boycott any more and has not organized grape workers
in California for several years. In fact, the UFW has only one con
tract in the table grape industry representing less than one percent
of the industry's total work force of over 50,(XX).
In California, union organizing in agricultural fields is governed
by the Agricultural Labor Relations Act and administered by the
Agricultural Labor Relations Board. Under the ALRB, farm
workers have the right to choose for or against unionization
through certified secret ballot elections.
Any union can call for an election to become certified on a given
farm as a collective bargaining representative for the workers once
they have received signed authorization cards from 50 percent plus
one of the employees during peak employment periods. Lhe
ALRA specifically forbids employers from negotiating with a
union before an election is held. I his is to prevent "sweetheart
deals" between an employer and a labor union.
Before a union can gete access on farms to organize farm work
ers, they must petition the ALRB. J he UFW has not filed any peti
tion to obtain access to organize grape workers for several years.
Instead, the UFW has focused on other campaigns including tar
gets such as 7-Up. Sunkist. Best Foods, RC Cola, roses, citrus,
mushrooms, apples, strawberries, lettuce, wine grapes, asparagus,
rappini. broccoli, cauliflower and eggs.
Stanford students also need to understand that the boycott did
not originate as a protest against working conditions or pesticides.
The UFW called for the boycott in 1984 because of the I Jnion's dis
satisfaction with then-Gov. George Deukmejian's appointments to
the ALRB.
The UFW later announced that they were targeting five pesti
cides for elimination. These pesticides include dinoseb. parathion.

phosdrin. methyl bromide and captan. All of these pesticides have
either been eliminated or are scheduled to be banned. California
farm workers are protected by the most stringent pesticide regula
tions in the country.
The UFW boycott is against any table grapes that do not bear
the UFW label. It is not particular to pesticides. If pesticides were
really the issue, then why does the UFW boycott organic grapes?
Over the last 14 years, many religious bodies, governmental
agencies, universities, colleges, news media outlets and community
leaders have not endorsed the boycott, including former New York
governor Mario Cuomo.
Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, who
marched with Cesar Chavez and the UFW, does not support the
boycott because farm workers are protected under the ALRA.
( "ardinal Mahony served as the first chairman of the ALRB.
Religious groups that studied and then refused to support the
UFW's current grape boycott include the Methodist Church, the
Disciples of Christ, the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. and the Cali
fornia Council of Catholic Bishops.
Former UFW officer Marshall Ganz was quoted as saying that
the UFW is "trying to create the boycott with smoke and mirrors,
with words, not substance."
Last December. 1 larvard students voted to drop their five-year
old boycott in the dining halls and serve grapes again. Thousands
of students voted in a special referendum supervised by the Har
vard Dining Service. Student voter turnout was among the highest
in the university's history. Harvard does not plan to vote on the
issue again this year.
I am deeply disappointed in Stanford because the University has
chosen to "institutionalize" the boycott just to satisfy a couple of
student activists. Through its Crapes Education Committee, Stan
lord essentially forces each residence hall to vote on the boycott
every year.
It is wrong for Stanford to force students to vote on any issue
that they are not interested in. But more importantly, it is a dis
criminatory act against grapes.
Why not form a committee for every item on the menu in each
dining hall? How about a vote on every product that Stanford
buys? Are there committees studying other politically divisive
issues such as abortion?
College students are no longer interested in the issues. Stanford
is the only university in the country who will vote on the boycott
this year.
The UFW has clearly moved on to other campaigns. Why
should students support a boycott that the UFW is not even active
ly pursuing?
It is time for Stanford to move on and end this discrimination
against our product. II students really want to help farm workers,
they should vote in favor of grapes.
