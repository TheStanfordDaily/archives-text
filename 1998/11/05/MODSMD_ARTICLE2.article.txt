# Russia conference to be held this weekend
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Tonight marks the beginning of a
weekend-long conference at Stan
ford titled "Russia at the End of the
Twentieth Century: Culture & Its
Horizons In Politics & Scx'iety."
The most-talked-about event is
the keynote speech and question and
answer session by Strobe Talbott,
U.S. deputy secretary of state. His
speech is titled "Russia in the Global
Order" and will take place from 4:30
p.m. to 5:30 p.m. tomorrow in the

Tresidder Oak Lounge.
" This is a one-of-a-kind confer
ence," said Gregory Freidin, chair of
the Department of Slavic Languages
and Literatures. The conference cov
ers everything from Russian arts to
politics and economics. "Confer
ences of this sort are very rare. I don't
know when another one like it has
ever occurred," Freidin said.

The conference is especially im
portant because there has been such a
profound revolution in Russia over
the past 10 to 15 years. "To under
stand anything about Russia, you
have to think about the politics, the
economy, the geopolitics" and the
culture, Freidin said.
Freidin said he expects Talbott's
speech to mirror this synthesis.
"He will be giving a very elaborate
and extensive statement on Ameri
can foreign policy with respect to
Russia," he said. "1 le will present his

expectations for the future conditions
of the country." But. whether these
expectations will be positive "re
mains to be seen," he conceded.
Other speakers will include
Vladimir Mau from the Institute for
the Economy in Transition in
Moscow, Natalya Ivanova — the edi
tor of "Znamya", a well-known liter
ary magazine in Moscow — and
many other notable Russian figures.
The conference also offers the op
portunity to screen and discuss a re
cent Russian feature film, V toistraw

("In That Country"), directed by
Lydia Bobrova. The film has English
subtitles, and will be shown in Cub
berly Auditorium from 8:30 to 10:30
p.m. on Friday.
"We have done everything we can
to attract attention," Freidin said.
"Indeed, [it| is now the talk of
Moscow and Washington, D.C."
