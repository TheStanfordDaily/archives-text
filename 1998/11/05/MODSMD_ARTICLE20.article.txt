# Support workers in the fields

IN 1994, four Chicanas and one Chicano
went on a hunger strike with over 200
individuals supporting them. The students
had four demands, one of them being a boy
cott on grapes. It is beeause of their concern
and the concern of other students who once
worked in the fields themselves that we now
have a chance to vote on grapes. This week
you will vote on whether or not to boycott
grapes.
SEAS and Stanford MEChA have joined
together in support of the grape boycott for
numerous reasons. The health of farm work
ers is one of the primary reasons for our sup
port. According to a 1992 report by the Cali
fornia Department of Food and Agriculture,
more pesticides are used on grapes than on
any other agricultural product.
Although progress has been achieved by
the elimination of three of the five most harm
ful pesticides used in fields, captan and methyl
bromide are two extremely harmful chemicals
still used in fields today. Methyl bromide was
originally scheduled to be phased out by the
year 2001, but recent industry efforts are
aimed at pushing back this date indefinitely.
Until then, thousands of workers and their
children will continue to have a high probabil
ity of chronic health problems due to their
severe exposure to the chemicals mentioned
above.
A recent study reported in The Gate
described the occurence of 21 childhood can
cers of various kinds in one agricultural town
alone. Children in agricultural areas have
been disproportionately exposed to pesticides
compared with adults due to their greater
exposure and susceptibility. During our stu
dent lives we have the opportunity to directly
affect the health of these individuals from
methyl bromide bv banning grapes in our res
idences.
We also support the boycott due to the
unnecessarily low wages earned by farmwork
ers. During the peak season, which lasts
around three months, grape workers receive
roughly $5.75 to $6.75 per hour. This includes
both hourly wages and piece-work incentives.
During the other five months of a year that
they work, the pay is lower. Sometimes, dur
ing the off season, especially when they work
for labor contractors, people being paid by the
piece rate earn below the state and federal
minimum wage.
Many farms don't follow labor regulations
due to the lack of enforcement. The U.S.
Labor Department's first in-depth investiga
tion into working conditions faced by the state
grape industry's field workers reveals that 77
percent of growers and labor contractors have
violated farmworker protection laws.
While California's Agricultural Labor
Relations Act is supposed to protect workers
and their right to organize, this does not
occur.
Growers illegally threaten workers who

Seth Newton
SEAS Co-Coordinator
support the UFW during union representa
tion elections. Many growers have refused to
bargain in good faith for union contracts, even
after their workers have voted for the UFW.
Many workers who were protected by UFW
contracts have lost their jobs after growers
engaged in "corporate re-shuffling." Growers
have gotten rid of the UFW by claiming that
they are going out of business and then
reemerging as new corporate entities, this
time employing non-union work forces.
The UFW has helped farm workers gain
various rights for decades. The union was
founded by farm workers, primarily grape
workers, and it continues to advocate the
rights of all farm workers. The union is com
prised of farm workers and their elected rep
resentatives. Their gains have not only bene
fited its members but have also brought
changes across the board to non-union farm
workers. One gain has been the creation of
UFW label grapes such as those of Sun Power
(Nash de Camp).
A grape boycott can put pressure on the
bigger grape firms to begin producing UFW
label grapes. In the competitive market, other
big grape firms would be forced to produce
UFW label grapes unless they could afford
losing customers and profits. If this cycle con
tinues we could feasibly have UFW label
grapes on campus in the future.
Allegations are often made that the issue
of grapes is a dead issue and the current issue
is now strawberries. Grapes continue to be an
issue for UFW. farm workers and the Stan
ford community.
Last month. Mark Grossman, director of
the UFW's press division and Cesar Chavez's
press secretary from 1475 to IW3. stated, "It
would be well for people to remember the
abuse of betrayal of grape workers by this
industry that led to the grape boycott, since
those abuses and that betrayal continue."
Strawberries are also an important issue
and similar abuses occur in both industries.
However, the negotiation process is still in
progress for strawberries and has not gotten
bad enough to come to a boycott. This
emphasizes the dire situation of grape work
ers and the need for a boycott as their last
opportunity to gain better wages, health con
ditions and human rights in general.
We would like to put the issue into the
broader context of labor to help you deter
mine your vote. Workers are forced to live in
conditions which are inhumane both on and
off the fields.
Our concern about pesticides and low
wages reflect the systematic neglect of work
ers by industry across the board. Grape work
ers face particular peril. No matter which way
the situation is viewed, it is undeniably a
human rights issue. The one question that we
would like to leave you with is this: Would
you choose to work in these fields?
This week you will make a statement con
cerning human rights. Vote no on grapes.
