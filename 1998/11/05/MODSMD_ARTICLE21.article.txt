WOMEN'S GOLF

■ Tomorrow-Sunday: No. 7 Stan-
compete in the Golf World /
Palnftetto Dunes Invitational, Hilton
Head*, S.C.

N£(. 7 Stanford will compete
against 11 other teams from both
the East and West Coasts, provid
ing tfie Cardinal with its biggest
challenge of the quarter. All six
teams ranked above Stanford in
the national poll will participate in
the aVent.
The Cardinal will be up against
powpfhouses such as No. 1 Duke,
No. £ Arizona and No. 3 Arizona
Stat£
Stanford competed against both
Aria Ana and ASU in the Cardinal's
*
pasUJournament at the Stanford
GolfjCourse on Oct. 23-25, placing
second behind Arizona by two
strokes while defeating ASU,
whiih eventually placed 13th in the
tourTiement.
"This is a phenomenal tourna-
said head coach Caroline
O'Connor. "This is the best field
we will play in until nationals. The
teams here are the best of the East
and West."
Stanford does not get many op
portunities to play teams from the
East-Coast, so this is a welcome op
portunity to see many of the chal
lengers that it will face when it
plays at the NCAA championships
in May.
"Playing against eastern schools
will let us see how we measure up
to different teams," said Stanford
sophomore and All-American
Stephanie Keever. "This will show
us how much work we have to do."
The competition at this event
will give the Cardinal a chance to
glimpse at the full package for
NCAAs because it had a chance to
play on the championship course at

an earlier tournament this season
in Tulsa, Okla.
"We will basically be facing the
same teams as we will in NCAAs,"
said sophomore Jessica Belskis.
"But we do take every tournament
as an individual tournament and
will go into nationals with a clean
slate, not taking anything for grant
ed."
Besides having the top-ranked
teams, eight of the top 10 national
ly ranked individuals will play in
the tournament. Last year's cham
pion, Chrissy Register of Arizona,
will return to defend her title. Stan
ford's own Keever is ranked sev
enth in the nation and Hilary
Homeyer is ranked just below the
top 10 in the 11th spot.
The team members had a collec
tive goal of improving their putting
consistency in between their last
tournament and this one. While the
team has been working on putting,
it is difficult to reproduce the actu
al pressure that comes along with
key puts during a tournament.
"We have been learning more
from each round of each tourna
ment," Belskis said. "We have
been concentrating more on our
short games and are more confi
dent in [them]."
The Cardinal has implemented
a new statistics program for each
tournament, giving the team a bet
ter idea of what needs improve
ment between each tournament.
The team is keeping track of more
applicable statistics for each team
member such as how many fair
ways and greens each hits, the
number of putts shot and how far
away a putt is when the ball hits the
green. This allows comparisons be
tween tournaments.
This tournament is very impor
tant for the Cardinal because it is
its last tournament of the academic
quarter. Play resumes in February,
which is the most important part of
Stanford's year-round season. The
Golf World tournament is also im
portant because it could lead to a
favorable bid for the Cardinal to
NCAA Regionals.
As with every tournament, the
team wants to finish this tourna
ment on top. Last year, Stanford
placed third overall.
"We would like to win the tour-
