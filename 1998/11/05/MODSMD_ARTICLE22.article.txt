# Card aims for conference title
## They're a tight unit 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
To clear up any confusion, if you happened to see
a white Mustang gliding through the campus streets
last Saturday morning, it was not an alumnus in mid
life crisis. Rather, it was the seven seniors of Stan
ford's field hockey team reliving an old game-day
tradition.
Perhaps the embodiment of Stanford's heralded
"work hard, play hard" ethic, the group can be seen
driving "the White Pony" while dancing to the
soundtrack of "Flashdance" in their off hours.
But when the whistle blows, the music stops.
The 1998 women's field hockey team finished its
regular season on Sunday and will began play for the
Northern Pacific Conference championship this
weekend in St. Louis. For seniors Monique Leroux,
Sarah Medeiros, Carey Cloyd, Jordyn Kramer,
Stephanie Finkelstein and Justina Williams, it will
be their final game together. The women, who have
helped lead their team to an NCAA postseason ap
pearance and continual success in the NorPac, now

decision. A great decision.
Four years ago, these seven se
niors arrived at the Farm, hailing
from across the country, blending a
mix of California with the Midwest,
East and the state of Texas.
An unusually large class, it didn't
take long for these freshmen to find
their groove amidst the other play
ers on the team as well as with each
other.
"We were somewhat overwhelm
ing," Williams joked.
The Class of 1999 brought to the
team an intensity and vision that
would propel the Stanford field
hockey program to new heights in
the ensuing years.

really serious about field hockey,"

the group started for the Cardinal,
establishing a leading presence on
and off the field. By sophomore

year, each of the seven was starting.
Since that point, "the unit" has
helped the Cardinal achieve a record
of 37-14 and a .725 winning percent
age — a noticeable improvement
over the program's career percent
age of .557.
Unsurprisingly, the seniors'
biggest challenges have come off the
field.
Although the longest-running
varsity sport at Stanford, the team
has felt that the attention its success
and tradition warrant has been ab
sent. An extremely supportive net
work of parents, friends, family and
alumni, however, has picked up the
slack.
In addition, due to Stanford's ge
ographical location, the Cardinal is
unable to compete regularly with the
top-ranked teams in the nation
which are almost entirely located on
the East Coast. Rather than play
these teams a few times throughout
the season, the Cardinal has been
forced to settle with just one crack at
a few nationally recognized teams.
This year, despite a number of close
games, that single opportunity was
not enough.
On the field, one of the few disap
pointments for these seniors was
that they haven't been able to steer
the team back to the NCAA tourna
ment.

Despite the array of awards and
trophies the team will collect from
play in the NorPac Conference, cap
tains Leroux and Williams hoped to
take the team to the next level.
"We have these expectations but
we haven't gotten those key wins."
co-captain Williams said.
The group's sole appearance in
the NCAA tournament came in
1995, and the seven seniors have
been unable to return .
"I think our trip to Boston was
very disappointing," Leroux added.
"Our number one goal was to make
it back to the NCAA."
Still, as the players look back at
their four years and look ahead to
one final conference championship
tournament, they are all smiles.
"We [always knew| we weren't
going to play professional field
hockey," Cloyd said. "But [we kept
at it| because we all seriously enjoy
playing our sport and seriously enjoy
each other."
When this group leaves Stanford,
it will be packing a suitcase of mem
ories that will have largely defined
the "Stanford experience."
The stories are plentiful. Creating
an aquarium fit for 11 fish out of a
hotel bathtub, dressing in more out
fits than crossed the closets of the
'7()'s and occasionally serenading
head coach Sheryl Johnson on air

planes, the seniors have built rela
tionships with their coaches and fel
low players based on care and
humor.
"We got the last laugh," Leroux
joked.
The strength of these relation
ships has withstood both pain and
pleasure.
Last Saturday, before the match
against UC-Davis, Finkelstein was
hit on the forehead during warm
ups. Despite the injury, she re
mained on the field with her friends
to be able to start her final game at
Stanford and participate in the se
nior's farewell ceremony.
She was then taken to the hospi
tal for stitches.
Despite the tight friendships
within their class, these seven are
still very focused on the team as a
whole, expecting that the contribu
tions they have made will continue
with subsequent groups.
"The closeness we have extends
to the whole team," Williams said.
This weekend the final whistle
may blow for this unit. Still, these
seven look forward to any future op
portunities to be together.
And if you happen to see a white
Mustang cruising down Palm Drive
early one Saturday morning, you'll
know they are not done flashdanc
ing together just yet.
