The long and winding road of
Stanford's women's field hockey
season is about to reach its apex.
After two full months of practice,
play and travel, the team's fate will
be largely determined by the up
coming Northern Pacific Confer
ence Tournament, this weekend at
St. Louis University, where it will
attempt to defend its title.

FIELD HOCKEY

■ Saturday: Stanford (11-5) will
play in the Northern Pacific Confer
ence Tournament, St. Louis, Mo.

As Stanford's opponent will not
be determined until late tonight
when other conference teams have
completed their seasons, the Cardi
nal must remain focused on its own
game. Fortunately, the picture
looks bright.
By most accounts, the Cardinal
can feel satisfied with an incredible
season. The 1998 squad has a sea
son of shutouts and blowouts to
look back on. Although having
played five fewer matches, Stanford
is just three points shy of last year's

mark of 109 points.
It is not this statistic, however,
that the team is concerned with.
Rather, the Cardinal is focused on
improving on last season's overall
record of 16-6. To do this, Stanford
will have to emerge from the Nor-
Pac Tournament unscathed.
Fulfilling the team's other pre
season goal depends on emerging
from the tournament without de
feat as well.
Already named the NorPac
League champions, assuming Stan
ford advances it will play for the
conference title on Sunday.
As has been the theme since
September, the Cardinal has little
reason for concern.
After watching her team play
soundly all season against the rest of
the conference, head coach Sheryl
Johnson is not fazed by the identity
of the team's ultimate opponent.
"I actually don't care who we
play," Johnson said. "Right now
our team is playing so well."
Senior forward Carey Cloyd,
who will be playing in her final
games as a Cardinal, is also confi
dent.
"I think we're more than pre
pared," she said. "We're at our best.

We've got our game down. We're
all familiar and comfortable with
each other. I feel good about it."
Having defeated each of the
teams in the tournament, the cham
pionship title might appear rightful

lv Stanford's. Cloyd. however, be
lieves that despite a season of
achievements, there is still a step
missing.
