## Remembering why I'm here 
### 
Gil Lopez

I feel ashamed. Last weekend I came to the realization
that 1 was losing sight of everything 1 had been work
ing for at this newspaper.
This job was becoming routine. Each night that I am
in the office. I come in and just try to put together the best
section I possibly can. Now, I don't think this is a short
coming. but I realized that I was forgetting about what
brought me to this point in my life: my genuine love for
everything athletic.

Then something happened Saturday evening. Be
tween shots of vodka and planning for that night's Hal
loween festivities, the football team was doing the un
thinkable on my television screen.
~J(t was beating No. 2 UCLA.
,»Jt wasn't supposed to be anything like this. The Bru
iils*and quarterback Cade McNown, UCLA's Heisman
poster boy, were supposed to romp. The Cardinal didn't
stdnd a chance.
• 'But it was happening right there on the tube. We were
beating them. And through ups and downs, high fives
and cursing under my breath, I watched until the bitter
emJ. A fumble and a sack ended the upset bid.
;•] was a fan again.
/It was a reminder of what I love about sports, espe
cially on the collegiate level: the constant fight, the never-
attitudes.
l lSure, in the end it was another loss, and the team may

be upset that it let the game slip away, but it was inspira
tional for everyone watching.
I remembered what made me love writing. I used to
get up at home every Sunday morning and open up the
Los Angeles Times sports page, scan right to the late,
great Jim Murray's column, and let him make me feel
something.
That's the thing that was missing for a little while. I
was becoming a spectator. I forgot that the greatest thing
about my job is that I sometimes get the chance to see the
emotion behind the plays. A good story lets you know
everything that happened in the game in a clear, concise
manner. A great story lets you know not only what
everyone is thinking, but what everyone is feeling.
Since being at college, I remember reading about nine
national championships, a women's basketball heart
breaking Final Four loss in 1997 and a shocking first
round upset in 1998.1 remember a Stanford team that al
most felled California, the Goliath of college rugby, last
March and a men's track team that came up one event
short of shocking the nation later that spring.
And those are just some of the events I didn't have the
good fortune to be present for.
There's something about college athletics the beck
ons to a triumph of body and spirit. Athletes aren't cur
ing cancer or saving lives — at least not on the playing
field — but they're overcoming obstacles and realizing
dreams.
I remember two ecstatic cross country teams my
freshman year, bringing the Farm its first national titles
in that sport. There were high fives and hugs and team
cheers everywhere. I saw Vin Lananna, an ebullient
coach who had finally accomplished the one feat that had
eluded him throughout his much lauded career.
I recall a2l -20 Big Game victory for our football team
last fall. Cal was driving in the red zone, threatening to

take the win away, when an intercep
tion by linebacker Chris Draft sealed
the victory for us. I jumped like a ma
niac on the sideline, losing any sign of
professionalism. Flayers erupted, and
a five-game losing streak was ended

and overshadowed by one win.
And I best remember a great
comeback at last year's men's basket
ball Midwest Regional Final. "The
Miracle Minute," we still call it. I can
still see head coach Mike Mont
gomery and his family after the game,
tears of joy tlowing down their faces.
I remember point guard Arthur Lee
on his teammates 1 shoulders, finally

alone in the spotlight after being
thrust by national media into the
shadow of his All-American prede
cessor, Brevin Knight. And I remem
ber small forward Peter Sauer on top
of press tables, waving the giant
school Hag in front of the Stanford
fans' section. I've never scene a photo
of that image, but I don't need to. The
image is marked indelibly in my

mind.
So this is a thank you to all of the
athletes who have pushed themselves
to the end. All those who never gave
up. even in obvious defeat. And
thank you to the football team, for re
minding me why I'm here.

Ciil l.opcz promises the rest of liis
columns won V be this mushy.
