out the day."

MEN'S LACROSSE
■ Last Weekend: Stanford won the
Chico State Halloween Tournament
with its three victories.

The Cardinal started the day
with a close 3-2 win over the Chico
State Alumni.
Stanford then began showing its
strength with a 6-3 win against
Sacramento State, followed by a 9-
2 whipping of the Cardinal's host,
Chico State.
The team took a while to get
warmed up, according to Stanford
senior co-captain Benton Williams.
"We just got off the bus and
warmed up for about 20 minutes
before we played the [Chico State]
Alumni," he said.
"The close score kind of belies
how well we were playing Satur
day. The Chico State game is much

more representative of how we
were playing," he added.
The defense was a strength for
the team, according to Williams.
With the exception of fast breaks,
only one goal was scored on the de
fense during the entire tourna
ment.
"The defense played really
well," Williams said. "They were a
little weak in transition defense,
hut once they were settled into
their defense.
"They did great."
Sargen also felt the defense was
key throughout the tournament,
helping Stanford keep possession
of the ball.
"We cleared the ball out of the
zone well so we really didn't have
to play much set defense." Sargen
said.
"(Sophomore) Stan [Shu| got a
lot of groundballs for us. He helped
us out a lot," he added.
While Stanford head coach Pete
Bijesse credits Shu with being the
team's most valuable player, it was
sophomore middie Brian Dunagan
who starred in the first game
against the Chico State Alumni
team.
Dunagan netted all three goals,
as Stanford squeezed out a tight
one-goal victory.
However, in the last two games,
the whole offense got into the act
with multiple players putting
points on the board.
During the final came, even the

defense was able to slip a goal by
Chico State. Senior defensive cap
tain Brian Puskas put the exclama
tion point on the rout with an em
barrassing mid-game goal.
Saturday's success starts Stan
ford on the right track for what it
hopes to be a championship sea
son.
Bijesse and many of the players
talked openly about how they think
the Cardinal, which finished 3-9
last year, can win the West Coast
Lacrosse league and possibly, the
national championship.
However, much of this was
based on untested expectations for
the team's many new talented play
ers.
Before Saturday, many ques
tions remained regarding how the
team would incorporate these play
ers and perform as a unit.
Saturday's performance cleared
many of those questions up for the
team's members.
"We got a good sense of each
other playing in competition," said
senior co-captain Brian Auld.
"It took us a while to get used to
each other, but by the end we were
dominating our toughest competi
tion," he added.
"I still don't think anybody is
going to be scared of us. They beat
us by a lot last year and they don't
know about our new guys or our
new attitude. But. this tournament
showed everyone how good we can
be."
