# Frosh writing gains range of instructors
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Thanks to additional funding
from the office of the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, graduate
student instructors in the Writing
and Critical Thinking program will
be selected from a wider range of
academic backgrounds.
The Writing and Critical Think
ing program teaches 154 courses at
Stanford which instruct students in
analysis, effective argument and
writing skills. Of the 22 graduate
students who teach Writing and
Critical Thinking classes, all but
seven come from the English De
partment, the Comparative Litera
ture Department, or the Program
in Modern Thought and Litera
ture. The Writing and Critical
Thinking program is seeking
greater variety among the disci
plines of its graduate student in
structors.
In an effort to attract instructors
from a wider range of disciplines,
the office of the Dean of I lumani
ties and Science instituted the
Wheeler Fund two years ago. The
fund pays the salaries of writing in
structors who are not from English,
Modern Thought and Literature or
Comparative Literature. Although
the fund received only two appli
cants its first year, last year seven
graduate students applied and re
ceived funding.
Ronald Rebholz, di rector of
Writing and Critical Thinking, said
he feels diversifying the disciplines
of graduate student instructors
helps to "bring different perspec
tives to bear on the teaching of
writing."
Since the main focus in all class
es is learning how to construct an
effective argument, graduate stu
dents from different disciplines
may choose a variety of texts for
students to analyze, giving atten
tion to aspects of writing relevant
to their field.
Other than scholarship money,
positions as teaching assistants and
writing-class instructors are the
main sources of financial support
for graduate students.

Although monetary compensa
tion for the two positions is rough
ly equivalent, being a writing in
structor demands much more time.
E:nglish and Modern Thought and
Literature are the only depart
ments or programs that require
their doctoral students to teach
writing for a year. Most graduate
students outside of the two depart
ments opt for TA positions rather
than teach writing.
Bruce Lidl, a former Wheeler
Fellow and history graduate stu
dent, taught the standard English
1-2 writing sequence last year. "It
was definitely a rewarding experi
ence," he said. "It gives you a great
deal of autonomy — you get to de
sign the syllabus, choose the read
ing and are responsible for all the
grading. You can tailor the class to
your own strengths."
I lowever, l.idl said he feels that
the added time which teaching
writing entails deters graduate stu
dents from doing so. "The time
commitment for teaching is great
and revolves around grading pa
pers." he said " The downside of
being in charge is that you are in
charge."
Lidl suggested that shrinking
class si/e would encourage more
graduate students to teach. There
are 15 to 17 students in each writing
class, and each student writes ap
proximately 5.000 words per quar
ter for English I -2.
By contrast, benefits of TA po
sitions include close interaction
with professors in your field and
teaching upperclassmen. "You get
to work very closely with older
scholars and learn a lot from
them," Lidl said.
Other than the Wheeler Fund,
Rebholz said he does not know
what else the Writing and Critical
Thinking program can do to recruit
more graduate students from dif
ferent disciplines.
Nevertheless, he is happy with
what seems to be a growing re
sponse to the fund.
He is currently busy training a
nev\ group of graduate students to
teach during the winter and spring
quarters.
