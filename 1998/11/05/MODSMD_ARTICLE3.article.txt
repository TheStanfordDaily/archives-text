# Small crowd for Draw discussion
## 
### Kitten Hsieh 
Just six undergraduates showed
up at an open forum to discuss the
proposal for a three-tiered under
graduate draw system Wednesday
night.
Of the six students, three were
student representatives for the
Residential Programs Implemen
tation Group. At a similar forum
held last year, just two students
participated — one was a RPIG
student representative.
"I don't know how to read this
situation," said Keith Guy, director
of housing and dining services, who
led the discussion. "I don't think
it's that people don't care, but that
they don't care tonight. They'll
care in the spring when they don't
get what they want."
The predominant feeling is that
the three-tiered system would be
more fair than the current two
years preferred / one year unpre
ferred system, according to Guy.
The proposed system would
create three "tiers" of draw num
bers: a top tier from one to 1,000, a
middle tier from 1,001 to 2,000, and
a bottom tier from 2,001 to 3,000.
Students would be allowed to
choose when they would partic
ipate as a member of the "top tier"
and would be restricted to the re
maining tiers in the other two
years.
This would reduce the disparity

between the "luckiest" and "un
luckiest" students, resulting in a
more equitable assignment
process, according to Guy. But the
major problem is how and when to
implement a change that will main
tain the programming and diversity
in houses.
"It's good to get equity, but we
have to create a mechanism to
make sure you don't get stratifica
tion within houses," said Paul Bod
nar, a senior majoring in political
science and classics. "You don't
want to end up with row houses
where 75 percent of the occupants
are seniors."
Kathleen Bransfield, manager
of Housing Assignment Services,
said she is concerned with raising
student expectations. "When you
make changes, you raise the
stakes," she said. "We don't want
people to be significantly more dis
appointed because they thought,
'this is my one and only year— it
better work for me.' "
Since changing everything at
the same time could be problemat
ic, the forum participants discussed
the possibility of implementing
minor changes rather than a major
shift for the coming year's Draw.
The discussion revolved around
finding ways to increase the
amount of information given to
students about where their num
bers stand in the Draw so that they
can make more informed deci
sions.
While a student may be as
signed a number of 500, the num
ber of students ahead of him or her
is likely to be far greater due to va
riety in Draw group sizes. One sug
gestion was to alter the computer
program so that when students
apply they are notified of where
they fall in relation to people who
have applied already.
"It would be ideal, in our view
at least, that any changes coincide
with the implementation of the
new computer system in a couple
of years," (iuy said.
The subcommittee for the
Draw is meeting this morning to
formulate a recommendation
which will be made in the after
noon to the full committee, includ
ing Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs James Montoya and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldivar.
"I think the draw is something
that people deeply care about,"
said senior Boris Bershteyn. a stu
dent representative to the commit
tee.
"I'd like to believe that it's the
popularity of Stephen Jay Gould
that's to blame lor the poor
turnout tonight."
