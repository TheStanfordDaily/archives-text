hypnotic." Tickets are $12, $6 for students. The performance is at 8 p.m. at the Campbell
Recital Hall; call 725-2787 for tickets and details.

Enter the mind of a great composer. With three actors, the Prazak Quartet illuminates the
written and spoken word behind Leos Janacek's "Quartets." Begining with theatrical readings,
musical excerpts and slide projections, each quartet is interpreted as a multimedia produc
tion. Then the entire quartet is played magnificently in traditional concert fashion by the
award-winning Prazak Quartet. Tickets are $22 to $28, with half-price tickets for Stanford stu
dents. The performance is at 2:30 p.m. at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Auditorium.

Theater
THUR/5 — SAT /14
Stanford's Drama Department presents "Venus," a play by Suzan-Lori Parks. The play is
loosely based on the true story of Saartjie Baartman, a.k.a. The Hottentot Venus, a young
black woman from South Africa who is taken to Europe for display in the early 19th century.
Upon Baartman's arrival in Europe, she is submitted to racial, sexual and scientific exploita
tion due to her (reportedly) enormous posterior. Exposed in freak shows, she becomes the
object of desire of an obsessed and scandalized public and the objectified darling of a
famous French anatomist. Tickets are $10, $5 with SUID; seating is limited and reservations
are recommended. Call 725-ARTS. The performance is at 8 p.m. at Memorial Auditorium
(stagehouse).
TUES/10 — JAN/8
Berkeley Reperatory Theater presents "Antony and Cleopatra." Star-crossed lovers? Not
bloody likely. These two grown-ups have barged down dramatic history as Shakespeare's
most theatrical creations, characters who in inventing themselves also become agents of
their own opulent, well-spoken fate. Obie-winning Lisa Peterson has previously directed the
world premiere of Tony Kushner's "Slavs!" among numerous other works. We include this
event chiefly to quote the Rep's promotional slogan: "Sometimes denial IS a river in Egypt."
Tickets are $35 to $45, with half-price student and group tickets available. The performances
are Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. at the Berkeley
Repertory Theater, 2025 Addision St. (at Shattuck), Berkeley. Call (510) 845-4700 or see
http://www.berkeleyrep.org for tickets and information.

Stanford's Dance Division presents "Stars of the Silver Screen," a ragtime ball and jitterbug
jam. Featuring live dance music by The Swing Solutions Big Band and swing dance exhibi
tions by the Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble, the performance benefits student scholar
ships. Classy dress of the '30s ilk is suggested; for those who want to go all out, style your
self after a star (Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, Boris Karloff) or a film character (Flash
Gordon, Snow White, Cleopatra). Tickets are $25, $15 for students; tickets are available in
