# Performance Review
## Three of a kind Trio Voronezh gives a choppy, but charming, performance for Lively Arts 
### 
The up-and-coming Trio Voronezh played to an enthusiastic audience at
Dinkelspiel as part of Stanford's Lively Arts series last Saturday. Trio members
Vladimir Volochin, Sergei Teleschev and Valerie Petruchin performed spirited
renditions of pieces by composers ranging from Bach to Piazzola.
Hailing from Voronezh, Russia, the group was first discovered in 1994 while play
ing in a subway in Frankfurt, Germany. Spotted by the director of the Oregon Bach
festival, the group was invited to come to the states and perform at the next festival.
The group has since parlayed its experience into numerous concert appearances
throughout Europe and the United States. Just last week, the group was featured on
NPR's "A Prairie Home Companion," hosted by Garrison Keillor.
At Saturday's concert, the trio performed a number of popular works by Vivaldi,
Prokofiev, Stravinsky and others — but each piece was delivered in the group's dis
tinctive style. All works were adapted to be performed on the traditional Russian folk
instruments that the trio uses: the double-bass balalaika (a large triangular-shaped
instrument), the bajan (a button accordion) and the domra (a short-necked lute).
Audience members caught glimpses of the musicians' puckish sense of humor: A
Russian two-step was greeted with chuckles from the audience, and the finicky deliv
ery of a Shostakovich piece brought appreciative laughter.
The group exhibited an enviable sense of interplay. Playing solely from memory,
the members took their cues from one another, creating a conversational give-and
take within the music.
The trio's youth and naivit£ was evident. Rather than setting a program in advance,
each piece was prefaced by an announcement of the composer and title by bajan play
er Teleschev; after each piece, the trio would stand and take two bows. As many of the
pieces were less than five minutes long, this created a choppy effect which somewhat
hampered the audience's ability to become immersed in the concert as a whole.
But what lacked in professionalism was gained in charm. At the concert's end, the
group was coaxed back onto stage for a lively two-piece encore that had the audience
clapping along. The delicacy of the musical renditions and the trio's dynamic range
created a refreshing preview of a group on its way to greater recognition.
