## Singing emperors, Batman! The 						Savoyards do The Mikado' 
### Dina Leytes Contributing writer 
The Stanford Savoyards present Gilbert
and Sullivan's opera "The Mikado, or
The Town of Titipu" at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, Nov. 6, 7,13 and 14 at 8 p.m. and
Nov. 15 at 2:30 p.m. Gilbert and Sullivan took
their inspiration for the show from the popu
larity of all things Japanese which abounded in
Britain in the mid 1880s, said "Mikado" director
Liz Palfreyman. The show was an immediate
hit, premiering at the Savoy Theatre in London
in 1885. The show's initial run lasted for 675
performances, more than any of the other 14
Gilbert and Sullivan shows.
The action takes place in a mythical Japan of
Gilbert's devising, where Ko-Ko, formerly a tai
lor and now lord high executioner of the town
of Titipu, wants to marry his ward, Yum-Yum.
Meanwhile Yum-Yum loves the wandering min-

strel Nanki-Poo, actually the son of the Mikado — the emperor of Japan — in disguise.
The often-ridiculous events of "The Mikado" sometimes parallel real life in Gilbert
and Sullivan's time. Shortly before Crown Prince Fushimi of Japan came to Britain in
1907, the Lord Chamberlain announced an indefinite ban on all performances of the
opera on the grounds that it was offensive to the Japanese. In fact, a 'The Mikado' is
actually quite popular in Japan because it pokes fim at the Brits," said Palfreyman.
Ironically, the opera became so well-known that its music was in the regular repertoire
of the bands of the Imperial Army and Navy by 1907, just as it was banned in Britain
for fear of giving offense.
Clearly the opera is not meant to present a realistic vision of Japan, said Palfreyman.
"It's a spoof and pretty far from the real thing."
The show opened in the United States on Aug. 19,1885, just five months after the
London opening. The opera was so popular that on one evening in 1886 there were said
to have been 170 separate performances across the States, including at least one in the

city of Mikado, Mich., which was named after
the show that year.
"Gilbert and Sullivan have developed some
thing of a cult following. The shows are witty
enough that they always apply generation after
generation," Palfreyman said. "The shows have
to do with everything — politics, human
foibles. Their wit cuts through the superficial
stuff."
The Stanford Savoyards have been have been
producing traditional Gilbert and Sullivan
shows at Stanford since 1973. The group takes
its name from the Savoy Theatre, built in
London in 1881 by impresario Richard D'Oyly
Carte specifically for the staging of Gilbert and
Sullivans productions. The Savoyards is an offi
cial student group affiliated with the ASSU,
comprised of students, alumni, faculty, staff and
members of the community. All participants are
volunteers and the shows are paid for entirely
from ticket proceeds.

"There's a mutual symbiosis between students who have energy and life and com
munity members who have experience. The two feed off of each other," Palfreyman
said.
In this production, the Mikado and all of the leading female roles are played by
Stanford students, including George Hoffman, Holly Goodliffe, Jennifer Lay Shyu,
Juliana Liu and Lisa Anfield. Graduate students Christopher Tin and Kristofer Jennings
are music director and producer, respectively. Undergraduate Timmy Yuen is the assis
tant director and recent graduate Jeremy Henrickson is assistant music director.
Last year, the Savoyards presented two productions — "The Zoo" and"The
Gondoliers" — both also directed by Palfreyman, at the Berkeley portion of the Fourth
International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. "The Gondoliers" was praised as one of the
best productions at the festival by The Wall Street Journal last July.
Tickets for"The Mikado" ($l3 adults, $8.50 seniors and $6.50 for students and chil
dren) are available at the door or at the Stanford ticket office at 725-ARTS.
