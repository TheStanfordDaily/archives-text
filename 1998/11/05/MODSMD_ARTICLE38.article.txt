# Dave Matthews crashes into the Bay Area
## at the San Jose Arena Concert Review 
### 
It started at the beginning. Leroi Moore, the Dave Matthews Band sax player, was
opening the group s San Jose show last Thursday. He was wailing the first stTains of
"Seek Up." And two high-school girls in jeans and tight tops were running up the
steps. But they weren't running to be in their seats when the group started jamming. They
were doing two steps at a time in almost complete darkness, jousting for the seat next to
a guy they both evidently wanted. A yard back, the black-haired girl knocked her friend
down from behind and snuck in.
Something was off Thursday at San Jose Arena, where the Dave Matthews Band played
to an almost sold-out crowd. 1 think most of it had to do with the venue. The ceiling was
stories high. The stage was as big as White Plaza. And nothing got better when the tools
in front of me started throwing popcorn off the balcony. The arena's blinding chrome,
too-cushy seats and copious advertisements for multi-billion dollar companies (not to
mention light beer sold with a straw) created an incongruous place for the band's lyrics
like those in "Don't Drink the Water": "Upon these poor souls / I'll build heaven and call
it home."
"Repent or die" evangelists picketed the show. They didn't know who Dave Matthews
was. One of them told me, "I do this all the time." Weddings, reunions, bar mitzvahs, you
name it. V
Even aside from the garish venue, though, the show was a musically mixed bag. Most
of the time, I had the feeling Matthews wanted out, ending songs abruptly and rarely
segueing from song to song. An exception was the opener, when the band jammed from
"Seek Up," slowing to "Pantala Naga Pampa," then shifting to "Rapunzel." The latter song
had the crowd on its feet, rocking in cadence and loving every step of Matthews' post
modern Running Man.
I found "Stay" forced, and it was nothing short of cheese when the mob cheered

Matthews' repeated proclamation, "Makes me want to stay." I thought things would
improve with Moore's haunting flute opening of "Say Goodbye," but it struck me as
somewhat plastic and, disappointingly, the song ended on a dime. The show only got
worse with "Warehouse." Though this song is amazing when Matthews performs it in his
closed-eyes fullness, his rendition of it in San Jose's was as metallic as the arena itself.
Choppy chords aad staccato drum beats were interspersed with a nuclear-powered ver
sion of a Pink Floyd light show that killed my corneas with every explosive flash.
Thankfully, things got better with the back-to-basics "Minarets" and the mournful
"Lover Lay Down," although I wanted its denouement jammed to sustain the mood. Nor
was I disappointed with "The Dreaming Tree," off the band's new release, "Before These
Crowded Streets." It was focused, raspy and rhythmic and had the diehards' heads nod
ding to the beat.
"Dont Drink the Water,""Crowded Streets'"s single, was rightly creepy. "Crush" was
even better, propped by Boyd Tinsley, who had the crowd pleading for more fiddling, and
by Tim Reynold's bluesy guitar solo at the song's end. Mob madness returned with "Too
Much" as the pubescent segment of the crowd sang (read: screamed) the lyrics and
Matthews danced, his hands in the air. The last song of the set was the crowd-pleaser
"Ants Marching," a version that became moving when Tinsley took center stage, his
dreads and busted violin bow strings gyrating wildly.
After a long, insulting wait for an encore, Matthews grooved "Two Step." For me,
despite the fact that the real ending was a nice, bluesy "Tripping Billies," I prefer to
remember the nearly flawless "Two Step" as the real ending. After nearly two hit-and-miss
hours, Matthews' chanted "Life is short but sweet for certain" meandered with just the
right rasp from baritone to falsetto, as his voice amplified his lyrics.
