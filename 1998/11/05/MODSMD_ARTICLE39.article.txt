## Stanford from other shores International students on the Farm

Feeling brave because you're going overseas for a
quarter? It can be pretty intimidating, with the lan
guage barrier, the culture barrier and the no-juice
bars barrier.
Now imagine you're doing this for your entire college
career. Several hundred courageous souls from all over
the world are facing the challenge of completing their
higher education in a foreign country — namely, here.
We wanted to know what the United States and Stanford
are like from another point of view, so we hunted down
some international students and asked them to talk about
their experiences.
We got quite a diverse selection. For example, Majda
Muhic, a freshman originally from Sarajevo, spent two
years of high school in Atlanta and was pleasantly sur
prised to discover that Stanford is very different from
Georgia. Huat Chye Lim, on the other hand, was born in
Malaysia, educated in Brazil, and is now a prospective CS
major.
Despite their myriad cultural backgrounds, most of
the students we interviewed agreed that their interna
tional experiences have left deep impressions and helped
shape who they are today, the kinds of Stanfordites that
they are.
High expectations
"I expected the perfect idyll of everyday life, curious
people who knew Penny Hardaway, lots of NBA games."
Muhic admits to being "naive" and optimistic when she
moved to the United States two years ago. As a refugee
from the war in Bosnia, she moved all over Europe in the
span of a few years. When she learned she was leaving
Germany to move in with relatives in Atlanta she was
intensely excited, conjuring up Hollywood's image of the
"land of the free." Atlanta and American public schools,
however, were not at all what she expected.
"1 faced complete disappointment. Most people did
not show any signs of curiosity or desire for knowledge.
To be ignorant was common and normal. It was accept
ed," Muhic said.
Fortunately, she discovered an entirely different world
when she arrived at Stanford, where she says she is having
the time of her life. "I am so glad that I have finally found
out that Georgia does not equal United States."
Waleed Ojeil, a second-year master's student in electri
cal engineering, had a dissimilar experience, although not
an overwhelmingly negative one.
"When I came to California, the people were not like I
expected," Ojeil said. Having lived his whole life in
Lebanon, the only image he had of California was from
the media — pictures of frolicking blondes on beaches
and so on. Needless to say, the Bay Area surprised him.
The graduate student scene wasn't exactly what he had
in mind, either; the Electrical Engineering Department is
comprised of mostly international students. Ojeil had
hoped to meet more Americans than he has so far: "I still
don't understand a lot of things (in American culture]."
He also felt "deceived" by many touted Stanford insti
tutions, such as the Co Ho. Ojeil, Muhic, and German
sophomore Nurith Amitai agree that there should be
more varieties of coffee houses or cafes in the area. Ojeil
does, however, like the music the Co Ho plays.
"My taste in music hasn't changed since coming here,"
Ojeil said. "I'm a '60s guy, also anything from New Wave

to alternative to psychedelic Dylan, The Cure, Depeche
Mode, Stones, Floyd."
Muhic and Amitai both became big Ani DeFranco fans
after hearing her music in the United States, and both
pretty much listen to anything but country.
"Currently I enjoy the swing revival tremendously,"
Amitai added. "This trend has not reached Germany at
all"

Cultural differences
After the reality of the United States and Stanford set
tled in, the students are more than adept in noticing how
life here compares with that of other countries they have
lived in. For instance, Yung Liu, a junior and
biology / classics double major who grew up in both
Taiwan and Turkey, feels that differences in standard of
living are an issue.
"You have better consumer competition here so you
get the best stuff," Liu said. "People end up living in the
United States 'cause that's where the best stuff and com
petition is."
Huat Chye Lim agrees with Liu, citing that in Brazil,
Seinfeld arrived months after airing in the United States.
If Brazil is late getting American TV shows, then Taiwan,
according to Liu, is behind by a decade in music.
"It's either Celine Dion or late '80s," he said, not look
ing all that enthusiastic at the thought. "Taiwan is a very
'80s kind of place. For instance, Richard Marx is popular,
whereas nobody knows Green Day, although this is all
slowly changing." lan Mak, a sophomore from Singapore,
adds that all songs there are eventually reborn in techno
versions.
What the United States does lag behind many coun
tries in is fashion. Oya Tabag, a junior from Turkey, and
Mak both state that Americans dress casually. Mak thinks
because school uniforms are required in Singapore from
elementary to high school, students tend to be "more
decked out" after shedding school threads.
"1 think people here in the United States are more
friendly," Mak also said, but added, "The girls back home

are prettier." It is no surprise then that he has a girlfriend
there, and he feels that Singaporeans compared to
Americans are more serious about relationships.
"I also miss the food back home," Male said. "Here it's
just meat and big portions. But what's great here is the
squirrels. We don't have them in Singapore, or much
wildlife at all."
If Mak likes having squirrels on campus, what Amitai
can see less of is root beer.
"How can a civilized country produce anything as vile
as root beer? And how can Americans drink it?" she said.
As "an avid soccer fan," Amitai is sad to see the sport
neglected in the United States. "There is a rumor that
during soccer games in the United States, some parts of
the audience actually cheer when the ball is shot over the
goal because they think that's a goal, too," she lamented,
adding that that's "the bad influence of American foot
ball."
Life at Stanford
For a lot of the international students, Stanford life is
different from the typical college experience in their
home country or countries. The kicked-back atmosphere
and diversity of this campus are frequently citcd.
"Stanford is more informal, with the Band, Full Moon
on the Quad, stuff like that," Huat Chye Lim said. "I think
it's pretty good, makes for more interesting experiences."
He is also happy with the computing resources, but the
worst for him is being so far away from parents and
Malaysian culture.
"I like that here you can do anything you like. You
don't feel pressure," Mak said. "What's best is all the
opportunities here, career-wise, classes, activities." Mak is
thinking of joining the Flying Club and checking out rifle
ranges. He feels involved and integrated in Stanford
already, but states that he is always still learning about the
United States.
Muhic was especially impressed by the support and
resources for international students here. She and her fel
low foreigners still see each other often, getting together
for coffee to discuss politics and global issues — "some
thing you can't do with a lot of Americans," she notes.
"International orientation was the best thing that hap
pened to me here." As a graduate student, Ojeil's take on
the international community is rather different: There
isn't one." Everyone at Stanford recognizes the stereotype
that grad students have no social life; Ojeil verifies it.
"I come from a place where everybody knows every
body. When I came here, I discovered that people are kind
of closed; everyone has their own life. I don't know my
neighbors," he said of living in Escondido Village. He
realizes that the situation is different from that of under
graduates. "Here, graduates are more focused on their
work, but maybe more than they should be." Ojeil is in
favor of more campus hangouts; he tries to spend time at
the Co Ho every day, just to relax and maybe meet some
new friends.
Like one of the international undergraduates Ojeil
mentioned, Robert Hsieh, an electrical engineering
junior born in Brazil and educated in Hong Kong and
Beijing, feels integrated and enjoys it here. Even so, he is
more than ready to point out why it is tough for him as
an international student at Stanford. It is difficult for him
to work off campus because he is allowed only one year of
work time, and he has basically no options for long-dis
tance calling outside of Stanford's "monopoly."
Hsieh also feels less flexibility to experiment; because
