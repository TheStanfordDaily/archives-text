## Stanford from other shores International students on the Farm 
### Essan Ni Chaney Rankin Contributing writers 
Feeling brave because you're going overseas for a
quarter? It can be pretty intimidating, with the lan
guage barrier, the culture barrier and the no-juice
bars barrier.
Now imagine you're doing this for your entire college
career. Several hundred courageous souls from all over
the world are facing the challenge of completing their
higher education in a foreign country — namely, here.
We wanted to know what the United States and Stanford
are like from another point of view, so we hunted down
some international students and asked them to talk about
their experiences.
We got quite a diverse selection. For example, Majda
Muhic, a freshman originally from Sarajevo, spent two
years of high school in Atlanta and was pleasantly sur
prised to discover that Stanford is very different from
Georgia. Huat Chye Lim, on the other hand, was born in
Malaysia, educated in Brazil, and is now a prospective CS
major.
Despite their myriad cultural backgrounds, most of
the students we interviewed agreed that their interna
tional experiences have left deep impressions and helped
shape who they are today, the kinds of Stanfordites that
they are.
High expectations
"I expected the perfect idyll of everyday life, curious
people who knew Penny Hardaway, lots of NBA games."
Muhic admits to being "naive" and optimistic when she
moved to the United States two years ago. As a refugee
from the war in Bosnia, she moved all over Europe in the
span of a few years. When she learned she was leaving
Germany to move in with relatives in Atlanta she was
intensely excited, conjuring up Hollywood's image of the
"land of the free." Atlanta and American public schools,
however, were not at all what she expected.
"1 faced complete disappointment. Most people did
not show any signs of curiosity or desire for knowledge.
To be ignorant was common and normal. It was accept
ed," Muhic said.
Fortunately, she discovered an entirely different world
when she arrived at Stanford, where she says she is having
the time of her life. "I am so glad that I have finally found
out that Georgia does not equal United States."
Waleed Ojeil, a second-year master's student in electri
cal engineering, had a dissimilar experience, although not
an overwhelmingly negative one.
"When I came to California, the people were not like I
expected," Ojeil said. Having lived his whole life in
Lebanon, the only image he had of California was from
the media — pictures of frolicking blondes on beaches
and so on. Needless to say, the Bay Area surprised him.
The graduate student scene wasn't exactly what he had
in mind, either; the Electrical Engineering Department is
comprised of mostly international students. Ojeil had
hoped to meet more Americans than he has so far: "I still
don't understand a lot of things (in American culture]."
He also felt "deceived" by many touted Stanford insti
tutions, such as the Co Ho. Ojeil, Muhic, and German
sophomore Nurith Amitai agree that there should be
more varieties of coffee houses or cafes in the area. Ojeil
does, however, like the music the Co Ho plays.
"My taste in music hasn't changed since coming here,"
Ojeil said. "I'm a '60s guy, also anything from New Wave

to alternative to psychedelic Dylan, The Cure, Depeche
Mode, Stones, Floyd."
Muhic and Amitai both became big Ani DeFranco fans
after hearing her music in the United States, and both
pretty much listen to anything but country.
"Currently I enjoy the swing revival tremendously,"
Amitai added. "This trend has not reached Germany at
all"

Cultural differences
After the reality of the United States and Stanford set
tled in, the students are more than adept in noticing how
life here compares with that of other countries they have
lived in. For instance, Yung Liu, a junior and
biology / classics double major who grew up in both
Taiwan and Turkey, feels that differences in standard of
living are an issue.
"You have better consumer competition here so you
get the best stuff," Liu said. "People end up living in the
United States 'cause that's where the best stuff and com
petition is."
Huat Chye Lim agrees with Liu, citing that in Brazil,
Seinfeld arrived months after airing in the United States.
If Brazil is late getting American TV shows, then Taiwan,
according to Liu, is behind by a decade in music.
"It's either Celine Dion or late '80s," he said, not look
ing all that enthusiastic at the thought. "Taiwan is a very
'80s kind of place. For instance, Richard Marx is popular,
whereas nobody knows Green Day, although this is all
slowly changing." lan Mak, a sophomore from Singapore,
adds that all songs there are eventually reborn in techno
versions.
What the United States does lag behind many coun
tries in is fashion. Oya Tabag, a junior from Turkey, and
Mak both state that Americans dress casually. Mak thinks
because school uniforms are required in Singapore from
elementary to high school, students tend to be "more
decked out" after shedding school threads.
"1 think people here in the United States are more
friendly," Mak also said, but added, "The girls back home

are prettier." It is no surprise then that he has a girlfriend
there, and he feels that Singaporeans compared to
Americans are more serious about relationships.
"I also miss the food back home," Male said. "Here it's
just meat and big portions. But what's great here is the
squirrels. We don't have them in Singapore, or much
wildlife at all."
If Mak likes having squirrels on campus, what Amitai
can see less of is root beer.
"How can a civilized country produce anything as vile
as root beer? And how can Americans drink it?" she said.
As "an avid soccer fan," Amitai is sad to see the sport
neglected in the United States. "There is a rumor that
during soccer games in the United States, some parts of
the audience actually cheer when the ball is shot over the
goal because they think that's a goal, too," she lamented,
adding that that's "the bad influence of American foot
ball."
Life at Stanford
For a lot of the international students, Stanford life is
different from the typical college experience in their
home country or countries. The kicked-back atmosphere
and diversity of this campus are frequently citcd.
"Stanford is more informal, with the Band, Full Moon
on the Quad, stuff like that," Huat Chye Lim said. "I think
it's pretty good, makes for more interesting experiences."
He is also happy with the computing resources, but the
worst for him is being so far away from parents and
Malaysian culture.
"I like that here you can do anything you like. You
don't feel pressure," Mak said. "What's best is all the
opportunities here, career-wise, classes, activities." Mak is
thinking of joining the Flying Club and checking out rifle
ranges. He feels involved and integrated in Stanford
already, but states that he is always still learning about the
United States.
Muhic was especially impressed by the support and
resources for international students here. She and her fel
low foreigners still see each other often, getting together
for coffee to discuss politics and global issues — "some
thing you can't do with a lot of Americans," she notes.
"International orientation was the best thing that hap
pened to me here." As a graduate student, Ojeil's take on
the international community is rather different: There
isn't one." Everyone at Stanford recognizes the stereotype
that grad students have no social life; Ojeil verifies it.
"I come from a place where everybody knows every
body. When I came here, I discovered that people are kind
of closed; everyone has their own life. I don't know my
neighbors," he said of living in Escondido Village. He
realizes that the situation is different from that of under
graduates. "Here, graduates are more focused on their
work, but maybe more than they should be." Ojeil is in
favor of more campus hangouts; he tries to spend time at
the Co Ho every day, just to relax and maybe meet some
new friends.
Like one of the international undergraduates Ojeil
mentioned, Robert Hsieh, an electrical engineering
junior born in Brazil and educated in Hong Kong and
Beijing, feels integrated and enjoys it here. Even so, he is
more than ready to point out why it is tough for him as
an international student at Stanford. It is difficult for him
to work off campus because he is allowed only one year of
work time, and he has basically no options for long-dis
tance calling outside of Stanford's "monopoly."
Hsieh also feels less flexibility to experiment; because

of time restraints, he cannot stop out or go abroad.
Tabag also feels that she would have more freedom if going to college in Turkey
because instead of being trapped on campus, she would be living off campus, as com
muting is the popular way to go there.
Nonetheless, she finds a lot of opportunities to get involved in Stanford, joining the
Band, community service organizations, being a focus assistant for Lantana. She also
works a lot with Turkish students and with their association on campus.
She notes how students and dorms here do things that would be considered "child
ish" in Hirkey, such as going to Chuck E. Cheese. At first she also thought such activi
ties were "dorky," but she has come to see how they can be considered fun.
An activity that was at first puzzling to Liu was"the whole naked deal," meaning
escapades such as streaking. In his New Jersey boarding school, there was a tradition of
romping in the snow and serenading girls in less-than-warm attire.
"This is the only country I know where people in school get naked together in
groups," he said.
Even if students here are more comfortable with revealing more than their personal
ity, Liu asserts that "people in Taiwan date like rabbits. There's just more lovin' than
here." Because students work so hard during high school, he states, they relax more at
college.
"Hooking up in Taiwan is easier; college means hook up as much as study," he said.
"All the pop songs there are love songs. People here work harder and harder as they go
along. College students there don't believe me when I tell them there's no dating in
Stanford."
Romance or not, Amitai enjoys spending time with other international students and
hearing about their experiences. "Generally, though, my group of friends is from very
many different backgrounds: fellow bio majors, people active in Hillel, people living in
my co-op, ex-SLE students, Band members, LGBCC members, Amnesty activists," she
said.
As for night life, many of the interviewed students miss the party scene back home.
Ojeil asserts that Palo Alto is a terrible and boring location for a university because one
needs a car to do anything.
"Stanford for me is like trapped in paradise," he said. "And 1 hate how clubs close at
1 a.m."
Muhic says that European parties rage from midnight to 7 a.m., so that "here when
you're ready to have fun it's over."
Both do, however, enjoy San Francisco. Muhic feels that the City has a lot of
European characteristics such as the availability of art and film. She loves Haight-
Ashbury, which remindes her of parts of Amsterdam.
Amitai, a guitarist and pianist, also likes the City and appreciates how big perform
ers make the Bay Area a regular tour stop. A big music fan, she has also recently joined
the Stanford Band, "where I pretend to drum."
For the simple pleasures of life, the beach is a huge hit with almost everyone. Mak

likes to go anywhere where there is sun or water or both.
"We should have a beach here, or at least a wave-making machine," he said.
In addition, Muhic finds the view from the Hoover Tower inspirational.
"I am completely in love with the ocean, so I was immeasurably happy to catch a
glimpse of the Bay from up there," she said. Enjoying other gems of Stanford life, she
and her friends "take three-hour long walks in the middle of the night to breathe the
fresh air, admire the campus, feel free and alive, ponder about how we got here, discuss
life, sing and dance in the middle of the Main Quad."
Identity, issues, and international viewpoints
Mak, Tabag, and Lim all say that being in the United States makes them appreciate
their home countries more than before. Mak and Tabag also feel more idealistic or ener
getic to improve things when they go home.
"Being here I get the opportunity to see things differently so I can provide a different
point of view," Mak said. "When I saw a team teaching kids football, I thought we can
do that in Singapore, build a stronger community."
Another effect of being an international student is the opportunity to try new things.
"I'm not easily shocked; I've seen a lot," Hsieh said. Til eat anything. I've tried scorpi
on in China and alligator in Brazil."
Liu has built up a tolerance to culture shock and also tends to distance himself from
situations. He is used to being an "outsider," and that makes him more objective.
"It's like watching a movie — you don't want to look at one pixel but the whole pic
ture. You're able to learn the best and worst of each situation," he said. "As an outsider,
you're used to looking at things as if they're not so relevant to you, so maybe it's just less
emotional."
Lim also feels like a visitor all the time but considers it a positive thing that allows
him to juxtapose cultures, to "compare and contemplate." Even though he has been
overseas most of his life (Brazil, Thailand, and elsewhere), he still considers Malaysia his
home.
Liu and Hsieh are like Lim in that they also lived in many different countries, but nei
ther feels that he belongs to any one place, including the United States. Liu feels that it
is easy to do as the natives do but that deep down, he is not American but an outsider.
"For me, home is where I grew up, and that's both Turkey and Taiwan," Liu said. "I'm
not just Taiwanese even though my parents are both from there." He feels that each place
played a huge part in shaping him. Even though he never got to speak the language in
Turkey, he suggests that he really knows the culture. "I can sing the commercial songs. I
even know how much oil [Turkey) produces," he said.
The Turkish part of Liu does not help him escape from Asian stereotypes, however.
Even in the American schools in Turkey, he felt that the teachers pushed him toward
math. He adds that he also took advantage of his Asian features when he was mugged
in Trenton, New Jersey. "I played on cultural stereotypes and pretended I was big in
martial arts," he said.
Ojeil is concerned about the stereotypes Americans have of his country. "It's a very
lovely country. I would really like to have people know about it. What you see here is the
bad image which is always given by the media," he said. When he went home last sum
mer, he was expecting political upheaval in the country, as it had been reported by some
American media. When he got there, nothing at all was going on.
"People ask me if there's hamburgers, newspapers or camels in Tbrkey," Tabag said.
"Or, 'Did you hear the sound of bombs from the Gulf War?' " She feels welcome here
but observes that people may live together but not really integrate, clumping instead by
ethnicity or race. As Hsieh puts it, "Stanford is very uniform even though it's full of
diversity."
The sense of cultural difference carries over to interracial dating, according to Tabag,
who feels that culturally, it's natural that Americans and Turks don't get together. "When
you like another American boy he's not going to like you 'cause it's not the French
accent," she joked. Since she grew up in a homogeneous society, the idea of interracial
couples was far from Tabag's mind until now. Even though she does have a Turkish
boyfriend, she finds guys of other races attractive, sometimes even more so.
With all the issues of stereotypes and diversity, the bottom line is perhaps that any
international experience, whether a quarter abroad or a lifetime of world travel, serves
to enrich one's life in various ways. Every country has its good and bad sides, but as a
love song (Taiwanese or not) may croon: No matter the ups and downs, the experience
is worth the ride. It's good to know that there's lovin' worldwide.

Is that Intermission in you pocket
or are you just happy to see me?
