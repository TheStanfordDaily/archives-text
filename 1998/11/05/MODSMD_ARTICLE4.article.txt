A year ago the University intro
duced Cardinal Care, a new student
health insurance plan, and many
students say it's working wonderful

Cardinal Care is a year-round, world
wide health plan. When students go
abroad or return home for vacations,
they remain covered.

cases of hospitalization, ambulance
transportation and emergency room
care.
"We have been getting feedback
that students are much more satis

were with the prior plan." Friedman
said.
Compared to the former health
insurance plan offered hy Stanford,

Cardinal Care covers more pre
scription drugs and offers reduced
rates for some Cowell services, such
as physical therapy and allergy
shots.
In addition, students covered
under Cardinal Care pay only $10 to
see specialists at Stanford Medical

Cowell. If students choose to see a

mental health fees, up to a maximum
of $1,500.

health insurance plan to cover them
in emergencies.
