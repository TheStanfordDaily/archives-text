# Revised student health plan popular after one year
## Cardinal Care insurance well liked 
### Kara Chalmers 
A year ago the University intro
duced Cardinal Care, a new student
health insurance plan, and many
students say it's working wonderful
ly-
Last year, more than 6,(XX) stu
dents were enrolled in the health in
surance plan, co-sponsored by Blue
Cross of California and Stanford. En
rollment in Cardinal Care has grown
an additional 5 percent this quarter,
according to Ira Friedman, director
of Cowell Student Health Service.
Geared toward student needs.

Cardinal Care is a year-round, world
wide health plan. When students go
abroad or return home for vacations,
they remain covered.
With a quarterly cost of $194, stu
dents are 1 (K) percent covered in
cases of hospitalization, ambulance
transportation and emergency room
care.
"We have been getting feedback
that students are much more satis
fied with Cardinal Care than they
were with the prior plan." Friedman
said.
Compared to the former health
insurance plan offered hy Stanford,

Cardinal Care covers more pre
scription drugs and offers reduced
rates for some Cowell services, such
as physical therapy and allergy
shots.
In addition, students covered
under Cardinal Care pay only $10 to
see specialists at Stanford Medical
Center if they have a referral from
Cowell. If students choose to see a
physician not affiliated with Cowell
or Blue Cross, they must pay addi
tional costs.
Mental health and substance
abuse treatment for Cardinal Care
members are covered separately by a

mental health provider service called
Value Behavioral Health. Cardinal
Care covers 50 percent of out-patient
mental health fees, up to a maximum
of $1,500.
Most services at Cowell Student
Health Center, such as annual physi
cals and counseling services, are free
to registered students. All Stanford
students must have a comprehensive
health insurance plan to cover them
in emergencies.
The only change for Cardinal
Care members since last vear has
been the addition of a $150 de
ductible at the Cowell pharmacy —
last year there was no deductible. But
there is a $2(X) deductible when using
any other pharmacy. After the de
ductible, 80 percent of the cost of
drugs is covered.
"We did this because the costs of
pharmacy coverage for the plan as a
whole was going up too fast," Fried
man said. " The change will keep the
cost down for everyone who is a sub

scriber."
Friedman said there have been no
problems with Cardinal Care,^ and
the University does not plftriMo
change the overall structure.
"We are open to improving the
benefits, but this will always be limit
ed by what can be offered at Cardinal
Care's premium rates, which are low
compared to employee health
plans," he said.
