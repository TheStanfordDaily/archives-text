## Bloodsuckers just wanna have fun 'Vampires' is good 'n' gory 
### 
If you're getting tired of the
new breed of movie-vampires
from films such as "Blade" and
"Interview with a Vampire," "John
Carpenter's Vampires" traditional
grittiness is sure to please.
Jack Crow (James Woods) is on
a permanent assignment from the
Vatican to eradicate vampires all
over the world. Together with his
band of slayers, he kills entire nests
of vampires using crossbows and
battle-axes. Guns are only used to
keep vampires at a distance and to
amputate the occasional limb.
Crow's preferred method of killing
the shrieking bloodsuckers is to
hook them up to a winch operated
by his sidekick, Montoya (Daniel
Baldwin), and pull them into the
sunlight where their bodies burst
into flames.
This killing method is not the
only unconventional thing about

this film. Another unusual twist is _ , , ,
, , Suck on this, you undead meaniesl
that the priesthood is continuous
ly ridiculed. The band of hunters likes to drink and party with hookers after every assign
ment. The 60-year-old priest accompanying them parties right along while wearing his
collar. At one point Crow also makes fun of other vampire movies when he claims that
he is after the real deal — not sissy Eurotrash vampires who turn into bats and can be
held at bay with crosses.
The ultimate example of Crow's complete dedication to his mission is when he must
clean up a recent killing field by hacking off the heads of 19 recently undead people —
most of whom were his friends. While the special effects leave much to be desired, "John
Carpenter's Vampires" doesn't take itself too seriously. The point is not to make an artis-

tic statement about vampires or their
killers, but to make a good low-bud
get horror movie.
The slayers' troubles start when a
600-year-old vampire, Valek (Thomas
lan Griffith), shows up and slaughters
the team, leaving only Crow and
Montoya alive. It turns out that Valek
is the original vampire, and now he is
looking for the mythical Beziers
Cross. With this cross, he will be able
to complete the reverse exorcism that
will allow vampires to walk in the
daylight.
If this happens, the human race is
doomed. With the help of Valek's lat
est victim, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who
has not yet turned into a vampire,
Crow and Montoya are able to track
down Valek, who has built up an army
of vampires in a deserted New Mexico
town. There, the battle between good
and evil reaches its surprising climax.
By this point, Crow and Montoya also
have the help of a new priest, Father
Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), who

puts aside his inhibitions and joins in the carnage.
Overall, "John Carpenter's Vampires" is a good flick. The combination of gritty
humor, traditional horror and cheap gore make this an unusual vampire film, but a good
one. Instead of making a traditional vampire movie, John Carpenter has made a western
in which the good guys are bounty hunters and the bad guys are vampires. At times, it is
even hard to say which side is more badass than the other. While the vampire theme has
been treated in this unusual fashion before, this film's lack of inhibition makes it well
worth seeing.
