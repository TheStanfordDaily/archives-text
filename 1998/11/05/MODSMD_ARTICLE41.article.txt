# An R-rated family film
## The
						Celebration' is brutally honest, funny and disturbing

Some movies are good to watch because they have
intricately woven plots that make you guess what's
going to happen next. Other movies are good to
watch because they have famous actors who you like, who
create characters that form permanent impressions. As
much as I hate to admit it, however, there are some movies
that are just plain fun, the ones where the action is non
stop and the star beats up 25 punks at once. These are what
I call "testoserone movies." But once in a while, a movie
like "The Celebration" comes along, one that does not fit
into a category, but makes you think about what you saw
long after you leave the theater.
The movie begins with three children of a wealthy
Danish aristocrat returning home for their father's 60th
birthday. The old man has an enormous mansion full of
servants and rooms. For some unknown reason, the
youngest son, Michael, is full of anger and resentment and
is constantly fighting with his wife. The older brother,
Christian, is more reserved and less confrontational.
Perhaps he's still recovering from the recent death of his
twin sister. Helene is the last sibling, a strong woman firm
in her beliefs and in her love for her family.
The birthday dinner finally arrives, and everything is in
place. The toastmaster gets the event started, and the first

entree is served. The long tables combine to form a "T,"
with the patriarch at the head of the table. All the players
are there: Great-grandparents, great-grandchildren,
uncles, aunts, members of high society and the three chil
dren. Toasts begin, and Christian has the privilege of being
the first flatterer.
As he begins his speech we see that he has a nervous
sense of pain about him. He's clearly tryng to express
something difficult. From the original context clues, we
assume it's because he's still grieving for his late twin sis
ter. Suddenly, he sarcastically thanks his father for having
sex with him and his twin sister when they were younger.
Just like that, we are slapped in the face and forced to
engage these people.
The rest of the movie shows Christian exposing details
about the sexual abuse he and his sister suffered by their
father and the reactions the dinner guests have to these
powerful accusations. Members of the party try to silence
him, at times resorting to physical violence in their
attempts. Michael even joins in one of these brutal
attempts at silencing him. The climax comes when
Christian gets his hands on a mysterious note left by his
late sister and reads it to the guests. She was very sick
before she died, and talked about how she felt like her

father was "having her again," at least in her dreams.
This movie isn't easy to watch. It will make you squirm
in certain scenes. We see how maintaining formalities in
this rich family (hell, they have a toastmaster for dinner)
drives them to dysfunction. It is both eye-opening and dis
turbing to see everything you've heard about the effects of
sexual abuse transformed into an on-screen event.
Director Thomas Vinterberg subscribes to a new ideal
of filmmaking called Dogma 95, which "desires to purge
film so that once again the inner lives of the characters jus
tify the plot." This is evident in"The Celebration" in the
way the actors bring humor to truly painful situations.
There is always an honesty to the production, as if we were
watching a documentary. There are scenes that mirror real
life by showing how we sometimes use humor to cope with
tragedy.
"The Celebration" is not a date movie, nor is it a movie
for escapism (who'd wanna escape to a place like that?). It
is even difficult to understand the film's ultimate point.
But ultimately, "The Celebration" is truly gripping, in its
style, performances and subject matter. It's about seeing
the truth, whether you want to, and I highly recommend
it.
