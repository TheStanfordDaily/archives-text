# Movie Review
## The 						'Beautiful' and the damned 'Life' holds joy even in pain in Benigni's newest film 
### 
Roberto Benigni reportedly took the title of his lat
est film from Trotsky, a Russian revolutionary,
who wrote at the bleakest moment of his life —
trapped in a bunker in fear of Stalin's hit men — that he
still thought "life is beautiful." That sentiment is the
theme and title of "Life is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella)," the
superb new film from Italian writer-director-actor
Benigni.
The film takes place in a dire situation similar to
Trotsky's. Guido, a Jewish man in fascist Italy, is sent to a
concentration camp. Guido (Benigni) is a Chaplin-esque

clown with an incredible zest for
life, who pursues happiness in
romance and family admist the
horrors and uncertainties of
World War 11.
The film charts two stories:
Guido's courtship of the beauti
ful schoolteacher Dora, played
with charm by Nicoletta
Braschi, and Guido's determina
tion to ensure his son's survival
when they are sent to a concen
tration camp a few years later.
The two stories are entirely dif
ferent in tone and visual style,
but they are linked by Guido's
exuberant presence. Benigni
achieves the demands of the
film's title and theme by show
ing how to find joy and wonder
in whatever the situation may
be.
The first half of the film is
romantic comedy, following

Guido as he arrives in a new
town in Tuscany. Much of this humor is purely slapstick,
including his initial meeting with Dora. His car has
crashed into her farm, and she falls from a window into
his arms. He greets her by saying, "Good morning,
Princess!" which becomes the standard greeting of their
relationship. They are instantly attracted to each other,
but Dora is already engaged. In fact, her fianc£ is a fascist
official who prevents Guido from acquiring the bookshop
which is his life's ambition. Guido quickly finds a job as a
waiter through his uncle, which provides more humorous
moments involving Benigni's superb talent for physical

comedy — gracefully tripping over chairs, dropping trays
and suffering other pitfalls of food service.
As might be expected, Guido wins Dora's heart and
hand. His pursuit of her is touched with magical coinci
dences and flamboyant gestures of adoration. At Dora's
engagement party, he manages to have the cake that
arrives in front of her say, "Good morning, Princess!" This
part of the film gushes with genuine romance through the
force of Benigni's and Braschi's performances.
As they walk off together into his uncle's garden, the
film cuts to five years later. Guido and Dora are now mar
ried with a son, Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini), and living in
bliss. Suddenly, Guido and Giosue are taken away to a
concentration camp. Dora almost finds out too late; since
she is not Jewish, she does not have to go, but she insists
on going so that their family will stay together.
The remainder of the film is set in the concentration
camp and tracks Guido's attempts to shield his son from
the horror of the war and the camp by convincing him it
is all a game. Even this part of the film has funny
moments, since Guido maintains his clownish charm,
"translating" the German rules of the camp into non
sense. But I could not help but feel the tension of the
Holocaust. The film manages to find strength of spirit
without being too flippant about the inhuman horror of
the Holocaust.
The ending of the film is not a typical happy ending,
but the film still fulfills the promise inherent in its title.
The set design and acting reinforce the classic theme by
being just theatrical enough to support the structure of
the story as a fable. "Life is Beautiful" is a stirring work
about humanity that manages to avoid cynicism or senti
mentality.
