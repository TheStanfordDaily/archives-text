## SCHMUCK & PUTZ 'Showgirls' and the feminine mystique 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
During a weekly cocktail party in their humble
abode, Schmuck and Putz overheard a com
ment that infuriated them. To avoid offending
the fine readership of the Daily, this cultur-

ally illiterate statement, which criticized
Paul Verhoeven's seminal film "Showgirls",
will not be repeated. Sickened and mad
dened beyond disbelief, Schmuck and Putz
knew that they had to set things right. They
would dedicate their next week to the cause
of Elizabeth Berkeley et al.; they would be
missionaries spreading the good word. The
following is an excerpt from their soon-to
be-published critical analysis on the film
that rocked the nation.
Putz: In an age of senseless violent films,
it's truly refreshing — nay, inspiring—to
find a work like "Showgirls," a film with so
much substance. Joe Esterhaz's clean and
simple script distills the human condition
down to a remarkable 131 minutes. His
economy of words and terse language
beckon comparisons with David Mamet
and Ernest Hemingway. The circular struc
ture, whereby the beginning and end meet,
has appeared in many films, from "Citizen
Kane" to "Saving Private Ryan," but never
quite so effectively.
Esterhaz is a master foreshadower. He
weaves several subplots together while
never losing touch with the inspiring cen
tral plot of Nomi Malone: Prostitute comes
to Vegas, gets robbed, becomes a stripper,
sleeps with important man, maims star,
makes out with star, becomes star. Nomi, in
the end, is an immortalized cultural icon,
arguably the first female Don Juan intro
duced to American culture. I specify
American culture because the Russians and
French latched onto this idea far earlier
with such works as "Belle de Jour," "Lolita,"
and selected prose by Pushkin and
Chekhov.
From a purely feminist standpoint, we
are faced with quite a quagmire. Do we

admire Nomi for what she does because her actions
secure herself a place of prominence in society? Or do
we condemn her to hell, as Mozart chose to do in his
opera "Don Giovanni"? Though evidence in the film
supports the former viewpoint, neither Esterhaz nor
Verhoeven place any judgments on Nomi. We must
admire them for leaving their inhibitions at the door

and showing it like it is.
Schmuck: Putz, for once I must agree with your
incredible insight into this very deep film. The decon
structionist model of communication and Marxist
principles present themselves time and time again
throughout the footage. This movie is about power —

who has it and what lengths people will go to get it. Zack
(Kyle MacLachan) expresses the true essence of power
while he receives a sensuous lap dance at the Cheetah,
while Cristal (Gena Gershon) looks on from the side.
Normally, the adult entertainment arena would prohib
it any onlookers, but since Zack has a rich endowment,
he gets whatever he desires.

Another fascinating motif in the film's structure is
the Christ-like representation of the character Nomi. As
she spreads herself out in the pool, lashing back and
forth, I felt the presence of God entering into my soul.
As Julius Caesar eloquently stated, "I came, 1 saw, I con
quered." Verhoeven brilliantly manipulates his audience

as he opens their eyes to a baptizing scene.
The pool symbolizes God's holy water, and
as Nomi lashes back and forth, submerging
her head under water, she is continuously
reborn.
Definitely Oscar-quality in its writing,
directing and acting styles, this film is for
the intelligent viewer who is attracted to
subtle artistry. History shall surely place
Esterhaz in the pantheon of such fine con
noisseurs of words, with the likes of
Shakespeare, Proust, Joyce, Melville,
Rousseau and the guy who wrote the
medieval morality play "Everyman."
Putz: It's interesting that you bring up
"Everyman," because by its nature,
"Showgirls" is very much a morality play
updated to the 20th century with a nudist
twist.
Verhoeven's choice to add nudity to the
profound work only serves to highlight its
intense relationship to human history.
Nomi's nude dance segments are akin to
the orgies of the Romans. Even the most
stimulating moment of the film, the pool
scene, takes place in water, a traditional
symbol for life. Notice that her first job is
at "The Cheetah," appropriately the most
ferocious beast in nature. Indeed, Nomi's
struggle with the human condition could
not be more relentless.
Schmuck: Along with the hardships of
humanity, I might add that the tightly
choreographed patent-leather-and-chain
dance sequence represented a mechaniza
tion of love in the age of technology. We
are no longer human beings making love;
we have become machines that exchange
data. Esterhaz brings about a level of social
awareness that matches Anna Dcavere's
Smith's "Twilight."

The bottom line:
Thought-provoking, pathos-imbued, profound
and deft portrayal of soul-bending angsL Bravo!
Bravo!
