## R.E.M. 'Up'

R.E.M. it not a band that is given to sudden change# inartistic direction.
With the exception of 1995'# appropriately titled, grungy embarjitssment
"Monster," R.E.M.'s albums fall along the same creative arc, each new record
pushing the band a little further. This is what makes ltE.M.is new record "Up" so
surprising. Instead of exploring it* tentative interests in glam and soul that spiced
up die band's recent albums, the ballad-laden, *i*d sorrowful "Up" is a throwback
to 1993's "Automatic for the People,' if not R.kM's '80s albums. It Is «asy to
attribute this move to the recent departure of R.E.M.'s long-time drummer Bill
Berry, whose restrained percussion could not be replaced by "Up m s drum
machines, guest drummers and cliche electronic bleeps. Yet, whatever the case may
be, "Up" gives us a more thoughtful and vulnerable R.E.M. The songs on this
album are more character-driven, less personal — call this "Fables of the
Reconstruction '98" — and "Up" is all the better for it
If there is a theme that unifies this album, it is loneliness. From "Wendell Gee"
to "Everybody Hurts", Michael Stipe's lyrics gave us a glimpse into the lives of the
pensive loners and their personal pain. Even R-E.M.'s shiny happy people seemed
to have a child abuse story to tell. This tendency did not alwa/a works at best Stipe
could be poignantly poetic ("E-Bow the Letter"), at worst overbearing ("Everybody
Hurts"). This time around reworking this theme works for R.E.M., if just because
for the first time the lyrics suggest that loneliness is an essential part of urban life.
M Up"s cast of characters includes a Dilbertesque office drone on "Daysleeper" the

'ft *•
shy, penitent title character o( "Sad Professor" as well the hopelessly fashionable
heroine of "Hope" who would not be out of place in "Bright lights, Big City."
Think "OK Computer" but without a hope that the aliens will swoop down and
take you away in their spaceship,
Vet, all Is not just gloom and doom and Valium. "Up" is perhaps the first R.E.M.
album to feature an honest-to-God love song. Stipe's earlier songs inevitably
shirked such sentimental sentiments; always careful to be just above the action, the
songs' narrators never got personally involved. On "At My Most Beautiful," how
ever, Stipe touchingly warbles "I count your eyelashes, secretly / with every one, y
whisper I love you" On "Diminished" Stipe implores "I will give my best today/I
will give myself away... / Does she know I loved you?" Characteristically, the
object of Stipe's affection is demurely androgynous — in the age of Marilyn
Man sons garish plastic boobs, this understated gender-bending is both old-fash 4
ionedand affecting.
It is easy to shrug off "Up" by saying that we have heard all of this stuff before;,
Musically as well as lyrically, R.£.M.'s new album does not break any radically new
ground. But, then again, R.E.M. never was about pioneering new territories. "Up"
is a multilayered album without any instant classics such as "Losing My Religion"
or "Electrolite" Instead, this record seems designed for multiple listenings, and this
is precisely what it deserves.
