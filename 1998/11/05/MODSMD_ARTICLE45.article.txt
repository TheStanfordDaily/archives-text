'Hey, wait, I've got a new
complaint.'

Back when Take 6 released its self-titled
first album, a cappella fever had not yet
swept the country. That album, sung
entirely without instruments, incorporated ele
ments of jazz, gospel, Christian contemporary,
doo-wop and R & B.
Now, 10 years later, Take 6 is one of the most
acclaimed and influential groups in pop music,
and many credit the group with the increase in
popularity of a cappella. Though Take 6 hasn't
had any big radio hits, the group has been praised
by Stevie Wonder and Boyz II Men, and has per
formed with such diverse artists as Ella
Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Don Henley, James
Taylor, Patti Austin, Randy Travis, Branford
Marsalis, Beße & CeCe Winans and Quincy
Jones. Take 6 has come a long way from the days
when it used to practice in the dorm bathroom
(because of its good acoustics). Although subse
quent albums have not been sung entirely a cap
pella, Take 6 has amassed fans in essentially every
genre.
Take 6's sixth album, "So Cool," takes the
group back to its a cappella origins. With the
exception of some percussion here, an instru
mental flourish there and a full band on
"Everybody Ought to Know,"the album consists
solely of the members' voices. "So Cool" is a well
rounded mix of swing, jazz, pop, and gospel.

The group has been criticized for limiting itself
to gospel and Christian contemporary, but just by
listening to this album, you'll discover that isn't
the case. Although the music is grounded in
gospel and the prevailing theme is a steadfast
faith in God, the varied rhythms and harmonies
consolidate several genres. "Fly Away," begins as
an African chorale and has a distinct gospel feel.
"Wings of Your Prayer" draws from '50s doo
wop, while "Love and Harmony" is set against a
backdrop of R & B. Take 6's music is far from
limited.
This album showcases the remarkable talent of
all six members of the group; each of the mem
bers takes turns singing lead. "Evermore" exhibits
the ability of the group to its voices to imitate
instruments, while the final track, "A Few More
Miles," features a more reverent and hushed tech
nique. My favorite song, "Sonshine," draws a par
allel between the relationship of the Son (God),
to a sense of well-being. That sense of well-being
characterizes "So Cool," an album that is over
whelmingly upbeat and positive.
If you are a fan of a cappella, jazz, R 8c B or
gospel, "So Cool" is a must. Rarely does a group
with such a sense of melody and rhythm grace
the music store shelves.
