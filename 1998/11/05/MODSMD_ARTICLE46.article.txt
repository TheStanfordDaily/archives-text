'Let's Kill Saturday Night' by Robbie Fulks.

« A lternative country" may sound like an oxy
moron, but with rock disappearing and main-
JL Jl stream country reaching new depths of self
parody, the genre bears the promise of something in short
supply today — relevance.

Just as the alternative rock explosion found its roots in a little-appreciated, short
lived but hugely influential band called the Velvet Underground, alternative country
traces its source to a singer / songwriter named Gram Parsons. Parsons died young and
unknown, but created the seeds of a new form of music with the Byrds and the Flying
Burrito Brothers and in his own solo work.
The music Parsons made was country-rock, a mix which could be painfully beauti
ful and convincingly caustic. However, country-rock could also be pedestrian and
cliched, as the Eagles proved. The emergence of punk effectively killed this breed of
overproduced Californian country-rock, and the genre diappeared from the main
stream.
Nonetheless, the emergence of punk also instigated what is known today as "alterna
tive country." Punks like the Mekons, Social Distortion and Jason and the Scorchers
began playing country, and although their efforts found virtually no audience at the
time, their efforts laid the groundwork for alt-country's full flowering in the '90s. Some
of the decade's best albums have been released by Emmylou Harris, Maria McKee, Steve
Earle, Lucinda Williams, Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Wilco and the Jayhawks, all giants in
the field.
Thus, the movement has finally gained some critical momentum, and two new voic
es trying to carry the music to commercial success are Robbie Fulks and Whiskeytown.
Fulks is a Nashville reject, too spirited for such a conservative environment. Indeed,
his last album contained an awkward diatribe, "Fuck This Town," castigating the coun
try capital. His new album, "Let's Kill Saturday Night," contains a little less bile, but his
outlaw stance gets him into trouble for other reasons.
"God Isn't Real," most notably, comes as a real shock. The message contrasts sharply
with the song's traditional country sound. Unfortunately, Fulks has penned a very
clumsy atheist hymn whose lyrics refuse to believe that God could allow Stalin to
slaughter millions of his own people. Why atheists often point to human frailty as proof
that God doesn't exist is a bit of a mystery, but most people have a right to wince at
Fulks' dime-store philosophy.
Fulks aims his album at a country audience, which leads to other problems. "I Can't

Win For Losing You" shamelessly steals a page from Dwight Yoakam's songbook. Other
tracks, such as "You Shouldn't Have," contain all the elements of country music which
made most people hate the genre in the first place: mannered singing, trite lyrics and a
generic sound.
Nonetheless, when Fulks steers clear of cliches and "statements," his music can be
quite affecting. The title track is an efficient rocker, and his duet with Lucinda Williams,
"Pretty Little Poison," is soulful enough. On "Night Accident," a tone poem about sin,
redemption, and death on the railroad tracks, Fulks even achieves a small amount of
catharsis.
Still, Fulks' writing is far too derivative and his voice is too weak to give "Let's Kill
Saturday Night" any real relevance.
In contrast, Whiskeytown owes homage to an entirely different lineage within alter
native country. The North Carolina group sounds like country punk with a strong
affection for the Replacements' mix of noisy trash and vulnerable ballads. The lead
singer and primary songwriter, Ryan Adams, obviously owes much to Paul Westerberg's
whiskey-and-cigarettes vocals.
Whiskeytown achieved critical success last year with its beautifully crafted major
label debut, "Strangers' Almanac" — enough success that its independent debut,
"Faithless Street," has been rereleased on the band's new label with nine bonus tracks.
The group's sound is one of aching beauty and resigned loss. "Midway Park,"
"Mining Town" and "Black Arrow, Bleeding Heart" are all powerful, quietly moving
tracks which cast Adams as the hero in a story so romantic that pain is noble. Moreover,
Caitlin Cary's vocals provides plaintive companionship on beautiful duets like
"Desperate Ain't Lonely" and "Lo-Fi Tennessee Mountain Angel."
Conversely, the band rocks with convincing abandon on tracks like "Revenge" and "If
He Can't Have You," showcasing the band's versatility. "Hard Luck Story" even main
tains the same energy level in a much more traditional atmosphere, making Adams
sound like the "fast-talking, hell-raising son of a bitch" that, say, Hank Williams Jr.
always wanted to be. The bonus tracks fits seamlessly with the original tracks, even pro
viding some interesting sketches for some of the best songs from "Strangers' Almanac."
However, the heart of "Faithless Street" is the gorgeous title track, a country ballad
with an alternative heart. Adams reveals that his heartache fuels his music: "So I started
this damn country band / Because punk rock was too hard to sing." Whiskeytown
addresses the contradictions between "alternative" and "country" directly, which is to
say that its music is so beautiful the listener will not question these contradictions after
listening to the music.
