# Fat Joe
## 'Don Cartagena' 
### 
On "Don Cartagena," (Atlantic Records) the third release by Bronx-born Joe Crack (a.k.a Fat Joe), one
of the music industry's most noteworthy Puerto Rican rappers tells it like it is, flexes his lyrical mus
cles and features some of the major players in the current hip-hop scene.
For the most part, "Don Cartagena" is an album about keeping it real. This album features a mock wed
ding ceremony between Fat Joe and hip-hop, strengthening his commitment to the lifestyle. He threatens
others to do the same and keep it real on his track "The Crack Attack": "Take these words home and think
it through / Or the next rhyme I write might be about you!" Fat Joe lives up to his hip-hop promises. "Don
Cartagena" successfully follows in the footsteps of his debut album, "Represent," his sophomore album,
"Jealous One's Envy," and underground hits "Bronx Tales" and "Dedication."
Fat Joe also raps about growing up in the South Bronx and hustling on "Don Cartagena." He raps about
getting past living the trifling life and moving up in the world without necessarily moving away from one's
roots and environment.
The self-titled single "Don Cartagena," featuring Puff Daddy, goes beyond the typical Puffy-esque talk of
getting that paper and riding in Mercedes. Like a true Don, Joe talks about wanting people to wear "Fat Joe
gear," but he also says,"Let's choose what life you'd rather live / on the streets stabbing kids / or living in mad
lavish cribs?"
Two members from Fat Joe's growing Terror Squad, Big Punisher and Armageddon, are featured on
"Triplets," "My World," "My Prerogative" and the tight jam "John Blaze." Puff Daddy, Nas, Raekwon the
Chef, and Layzie and Krayzie Bone of Bone Thugs 'N' Harmony are also featured on "Don Cartagena," mak
ing this album a resplendent mixture of different styles.
"Don Cartagena" shows that Fat Joe is still hardcore, but now he's also saying much more.
