## MISSION QUESTIONNAIRE Vice Provost James Montoya 
### 
Who at Stanford does not know James Montoya?
Currently the Vice Provost for Student Affairs, he is prob
ably the one who signed your admission letter and the
one making fun of himself at Gaieties. In this interview
Dean Montoya tells us about his admissions coups
(Danny Pintauro!), his taste in bowling attire and his
grudge against Miyake. Unfortunately, he still won't tell
us what the deal is with the bow tie. Maybe next time.
Intermission: What is your favorite thing about
Stanford?
James Montoya: Oh, please ... Gaieties. How often
does the (former) Dean of Admission have the opportu
nity to stand on stage wearing a tutu dressed as the devil
or dance the Macarena with Gerhard Casper?
I: Least favorite?
JM: The fact that so few people wear bow ties. Not
even the Tree wears a bow tie.
I: Which one of all of your accomplishments here are
you most proud of?
JM: At February's Viennese Rail, I participated in the
wait/ contest. Alice, the then-frosh who asked me to be
her partner, didn't really care that I did not know how to
waltz. Nor did she mind my stepping on her toes. We had
a terrific time until the "tap" on the shoulder came. All
hopes of a side career as an Arthur Murray dance instruc
tor were shattered at that moment.

That aside, I am still proud of the fact that 1 made it
around the dance floor with my head up and two feet on
the ground.
I: What is one thing that you don't think you'll ever
get to do?
JM: Hair commercials.
I: What are your favorite qualities in people?
JM: The ability to laugh and the ability to cook.
I: Least favorite?
JM: I find people who wear coordinated outfits to the
bowling alley just a little too pretentious for my taste. I
understand the matching purple speckled ball and bowl
ing shirt "look," but when the purple extends to pants,
socks, and we 11... let's just leave it at that, 1 find it sim
ply too much. It sends the message, "You'll NEVER be the
bowler lam ... Never." It hurts. It really, really, hurts.
I: What is the best and worst thing about Stanford
students?
JM: They were born in the '70s and '80s.The worst is
that their parents are my age.
I: What book changed your life (if any)?
JM: Why do I feel as if I am completing the Stanford
admission application? "Important Book"? That's Doris
Lessing's "Prisons We Create for Ourselves." In a won
derful collection of essays, she writes that .. what will
amaze people when they look back at us is how much we
know about ourselves and how little we use this informa
tion."
I: Favorite song or album?
JM: I listened to the Gypsy Kings this morning before
my early-morning run. I hope my upstairs neighbors like
them as much as I do.
I: What's your favorite film and why?
JM: "Harold and Maude" is right up there. It is twisted
and charming at the same time. More important, it
embraces the notion of being free-spirited and living life
to the fullest. "Hairspray," featuring the late Divine, is a
close second. I was introduced to John Waters' filn.j as an
undergraduate at Stanford. I'm still hooked.

I: Favorite actor or actress?
JM: Fred Savage, Reese Witherspoon and Danny
Pintauro, of course. I admitted them to Stanford.
I: Who's your favorite artist?
JM: In my home I have two lithographs of Carmen
Lomas Garza, one entitled 'Tamalda," the other
"Cumpleanos." Her work captures my own experience
growing up in a Chicano household. Architects also fall
into my category of artists. During my undergraduate
years, I studied the work of Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The Art Nouveau movement continues to capture my
imagination.
I: If you could meet any personality, dead or alive,
who would it be and why?
JM: That's easy. Saint Francis of Asissi. His generous
spirit and commitment to serving others guides me.
Similarly, Mary Tyler Moore.
I: What person, book or movie is most overrated?
JM: How about a local overrated restaurant, instead?
Miyake. I just buy sushi at Tres Ex and yell at myself.
I: Describe what you consider to be a perfect day?
JM: The perfect day includes a run in the morning,
chorizo con huevos for breakfast, a nap sandwiched
between reading the Sunday New York Times and cook
ing dinner for friends.
I: What is your one weakness?
JM: I am a Jack in the Box junkie. The habit started as
an RAin Flo Mo, and despite several attempts to kick the
habit, including moving to upstate New York for six years,
1 keep returning to El Camino Real. Help me!
I: Who was the most important person in your life?
JM: Other than my family, Fred Hargadon, the former
Dean of Admissions at Stanford, is the most important
person in my life. Dean Fred signed my letter of admis
sion and gave me the opportunity to attend this great
place. Yep, he's quite The Man.
I: Do you have a motto?
JM: "Think big and think with a big heart."
