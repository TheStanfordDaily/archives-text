* /% iss Sass was sitting in section
\j 1/ % the other day (yes, she does go
11 % to class, occasionally) and her
mind was wandering. What, yours truly wonders,
could make this not-so-interesting class seem
more exciting? If only Miss Sass was doing her
TA — the secret glances and promise of things
yet to come (pun intended) would make any sec
tion seem a bit brighter.
Now, Miss Sass realizes that scoring with these
sometimes-robotic slave drivers may not be for
everyone. But trust someone who knows — the
rewards can be copious. Your TA, or section
leader, has a wealth of resources for an ingenious,
horny undergrad like yourself to take full advan
tage of, including: (1) a car, (2) he/she is single,
(3) experience and maturity (ladies, you know
what I mean) and (4) your grades.
With these, and other numerous benefits in
mind, an astute and libidinous reader might be
wondering how one would go about breaking the
student-TA barrier. Well, read on, because Miss
Sass is going to disclose her four easy steps to
making your section leader into your section sex
toy, err ... partner.
First, you may ask, "How do 1 know this
untapped sexual well would be interested in a
poor, innocent undergrad like me? I thought that
the requirement for grad school was to have the
sexual libido of Darth Vader," you ponder. Well
dear reader, Miss Sass would like you refer you to
Jammix and Bechtel parties alike — both over
flowing to the brim with concupiscent graduate
students. Men, remember that the sexual peak for
women does not occur until between the ages of
25 to 33. Also, the increased graduate workload
means less time to concentrate on social items,
but it also means more pent-up sexual energy,
and less competition for you.
Well, now that you know your TA is a bundle
of sexual energy waiting for release, the next step
is to narrow down your options, in order to focus
your energies on a single target (or two or three,
if you are one of those overachieving types). The
cardinal rule: Go for what turns you on. Perhaps
you dream of a woman who can discourse till
your head spins, or maybe it sends shivers down
your spine to know that he can recite "The
Odyssey" backwards. And perhaps rings don't do
it for you — especially rings residing on a certain
finger. Maybe they do.
Another good rule to keep in mind: If he or
she brought in a seating chart the second day and
conspicuously put that stereotypically beautiful
Stanford player in opportune viewing position,
then there is a good chance that you may not
want his / her kind anyway. (If you are that said
player, then it is unlikely that you need to be
reading Miss Sass' advice — more power to you.)
No, what Miss Sass would recommend is that
somewhat quiet, reserved TA who has a mysteri
ous sexual pull all his or her own. Miss Sass
always likes a challenge, and remarks that those
quiet ones are sometimes savants in wild, innov
ative, spell-binding sex.
But how to go about getting that first date?
Studies have shown time and again that no one

ever goes to office hours; therefore you can have
no fear of being interrupted there. Dressing,
ahem, nicely, could be a good start. Try to find
something that the two of you have in common
(besides sexual gratification) that would lead to a
satisfying first date. It helps to find something
besides what you are studying in class to break
the student-TA barrier. Office hours are great for
this, as you can bring up unrelated topics; for
example, what things do you do outside of class.
Maybe your prospective partner is a dancer, or
likes to ride horses (a definite plus, in Miss Sass'
opinion). Rest assured that even TAs have lives
outside of school, and are likely to have hobbies,
interests, and sexual fantasies just like the rest of
us.
Once you have ignited the conversation, and
have drifted away from class talk, you can easily
propose an "innocent" outing to get to know
each other better. Maybe you haven't gotten the
chance to ride (horses, that is) in a while, and
would like to brush up. Or you could keep it real
ly simple, and just have coffee together.
The last consideration ishow not to get caught.
The first rule in not getting caught is that there is
no such rule. Contrary to popular belief, there is
no law against two adults dating, even if one hap
pens to be subordinate to the other — subordi
nation and domination are half the fun of dat
ing!
That said, there are principles and rules of
workplace ethics in place, even here at fun-lov
ing, sex-filled Stanford. Going at it full-steam on
the table before section starts is not such a great
idea, especially if your section contains that one
freshman who still thinks he or she needs to
arrive five minutes early to "prepare" for section.
Neither is bringing up grades. Assume that vour
lover will be unbiased. Otherwise it will lead to
petty fighting (when you could be more produc
tively occupying your time, say, with that new
position you read about in Cosmo). It is also wise
not to accompany your playmate to meetings
with the professor. (Scoring with professors is left
to another, lengthier column).
As long as you follow these easy steps and let
your imagination and motivation be your guides,
Miss Sass assures you section will never be boring
again.
Yours informationally,
Roxy Sass
