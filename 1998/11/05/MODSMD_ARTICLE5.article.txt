In the wake of Tuesday's elec
tions. a seldom-heard phrase buzzed
about TV newsrooms: "the Latino
vote." According to visiting History
Prof. Pedro Castillo, "The commen
tators (Tuesday] night were talking
about the Latino vote in California.
You haven't heard that before."
Castillo, a history professor at
I JC-Santa ( ruz, spoke yesterday to a
crowd of 30 as a part of the El Centro
Chicano Speakers Series. In his
speech titled, "The Latinization of
the U.S.: Immigration. Culture and
the Transformation of America,"he
discussed the recent election and is
sues affecting Latinos and their influ
ence on the United States.
Castillo highlighted the growing
political power of Latinos in Califor
nia, particularly "the dramatic elec
tion of Gray Davis (for governor] by
a significant percentage, with a large-
Latino vote." He estimated that 85 to
90 percent of Latino voters cast a bal
lot for Davis.

"For the first time since the 19th
century, there is a Latino elected to
state office." he said, referring to
State Treasurer Phil Angelides.
Castillo presented census data to
demonstrate the changing demo
graphics of the I J.S. population. Cur
rently. the population breakdown by
ethnicity in the U.S. is 74 percent
white, 12 percent African American,
11 percent Latino, 3.5 percent Asian
American, and less than I percent
American Indian.
By 2050, the census bureau pro
jects that the percentage of white
Americans will fall to 53 percent, and
the percentage of Latinos will rise to
25 percent, making them the largest
minority group.
" These changes will have a dra
matic impact on public policy issues
such as health, education, employ
ment and housing," Castillo said.
Currently, 10 percent of the U.S.
population is foreign-born, and over
half of these people come from Mex
ico, Latin America, South America
and the Caribbean. A large portion

— 25 percent — of foreign-born resi
dents of the U.S. live in California.
"The United States is a nation of
immigrants," Castillo said. "We will
have to rethink the whole issue of im
migration in years to come."
According to Castillo, the mass
migration to the U.S. resulted from
the boom in the U.S. economy, which
created many employment opportu
nities.
"Given the [financial] crisis in
Mexico since the 198()s, we see a lot of
migration from Mexico to the U.S."
he said. "But we also see migration
from Central and South America for
political reasons."
Castillo also noted a growing
trend in migration to other areas of
the U.S. Common destinations in
clude Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, North
and South Carolina and even Alaska
and Hawaii.
He cited the high cost of living in
California, urban crime and anti-im
migrant sentiment as factors that
