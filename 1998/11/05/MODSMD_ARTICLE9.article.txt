# Med students promote herbal healing
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
Hey, everybody, it's time to get
sick. If you haven't already gotten
your fall flu or an early winter cold,
don't worry, it's coming.
Hoping to avoid the annual sick
ness season? First of all, think about
getting a flu shot. They're offered at
Cowell on Tuesday afternoons. Sec
ond, you might want to join the pa
rade of people lining up to try out al
ternative medicines, sometimes
called "complementary" medicines.
Herbal remedies, homeopathy,
aromatherapy, yoga and mediation
aren't just for hippies anymore.
Beyond Jamba Juice's marketing
of wheat grass, many people who
grew up with the ideology and tech
nology of Western medicine aren't
aware of the benefits or even the ex
istence of natural remedies and
health supplements.
Rebecca Leibowitz, a third-year
student at the Medical School, is
president of Alternative Medicine
Interest Group of Stanford. The
group works with the Medical
School community to expose stu
dents and faculty to the benefits of
alternative therapies.
"The point of the group is to edu
cate ourselves," Leibowitz said. "As
medical students, many of our pa
tients will be using herbal remedies
that will affect the rest of the health
care. Understanding alternative
medicine means more of a holistic

approach."
Alison Yager, fourth-year med
ical student and past president of the
group, became involved with alter
native medicine when she spent a
year of college in Ecuador and
learned about indigenous medicine.
"When I got to med school I got
involved with AMIGOS, which al
ready existed," she said. "We have
no contact with alternative medicine
in the formal curriculum. We bring
in speakers on a range of topics:
homeopathy, ethnobotany, tradi
tional Chinese medicine, acupunc
ture."
She said she believes that people
turn to alternative medicine because
of their dissatisfaction with Western
practices and concerns about the
overuse of certain pharmaceuticals.
Yager also points out that herbals
are "cheap, easy and accessible."
"Americans want the most they
can get." Leibovitz said. "They take
it to the extreme of wanting to do
everything they can to stay as
healthy as possible. In other coun
tries the concern is often about a
minimum of health rather than a
maximum."
She said she believes American's
desire for health and youth con
tribute to the increasing use of
herbals and alternative medicines in
the United States.
"I think it would be good if there
were fewer classifications — con
ventional versus alternative. Doc
tors minds' often shut off when thev

hear people mention alternatives,"
Leibovitz said. "I think it helps if
people can think of it as complemen
tary medicine rather than alterna
tive medicine. It's not that you don't
believe in Western medicine, it'sjust
that you're open to whatever might
work."
If you grew up on Tylenol and
I riaminic, and chicken noodle soup
was a sweet symbolic gesture but not
actually curative, all these natural
medicines may seem suspicious.
Here's a quick rundown of the
more popular herbal remedies and
health supplements with some of the
reported benefits and active ingredi
ents, courtesy of the Herbal Infor
mation Center at http://www
.kcweb.com/herb/herbmain.htm.
Echinacea, derived from a
flower, contains polysaccharides —
complex sugar molecules — that
stimulate the cells of the immune
system, including white blood cells.
Echinacea also assists in the produc
tion of interferon, an important part
of the immune response. Echinacea
has been shown to boost the im
mune system.
Ginseng, native to Asia and parts
of North America, is most often
used as an adaptogen. It standard
izes physical conditions depending
on individual needs. For example, it
will lower high blood pressure, but
raise low blood pressure. The main
active ingredients of ginseng are the
"ginsenosides" — glycosides. These
are similar to steroids and seem to

provide the adaptogenic properties
of the herb that enable ginseng to
balance and counter the effects of
stress. They appear to act on the
adrenal glands, helping to prevent
excess corticosteroid production in
response to physical, chemical or bi
ological stress.
Bee pollen is made up of the male
gametes of plants found as small
dust pellets in the stamen of flowers
as well as digestive enzymes from
the bees. It is a source of antioxi
dants and contains many vitamins
and amino acids.
Ginkgo biloba is also an antioxi
dant and can be helpful in clearing
blood vessels and preventing blood
clots. It can also be helpful in con
trolling allergic inflammation, ana
phylactic shock and asthma. Ginkgo
has two groups of active substances:
flavonoids and terpene lactones.
Finally, there is garlic. Garlic con
tains the amino acid allicin and sul
fur-containing compounds which are
the source of its therapeutic values.
Garlic acts as an antibiotic, blood
thinner, anticoagulant and a general
immune-boost.
The supplements mentioned
above is just a drop in the herbal
bucket.
Talk to your doctor if you have
any concerns about your general
health or the effects of herbal reme
dies.
Most herbal remedies are not reg
ulated by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
