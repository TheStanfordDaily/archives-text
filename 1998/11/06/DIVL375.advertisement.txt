From: Condoleezza Rice, Provost
I am writing to inform you about our progress in planning for the construction of new hous
ing for graduate students on campus, and on other related developments. I met recently with a
small planning group that includes both graduate student representatives and campus administra
tors to review these developments, and we agreed that it would be useful to update the entire
campus community.
By the end of last academic year, a plan to create 480 new spaces for graduate students had
become firm. We have identified five sites in Escondido Village in which these units will be con
structed. Two of these sites are presently open space. The other three sites involve the demolition
of existing low-rise units to make way for larger, more efficient buildings. The 480 units are the
net number of units provided after all demolition and construction has been completed.
As many of you know, we operate under a General Use Permit from Santa Clara County
that sets limitations on the amount of building we may do on campus. During the summer we
investigated the possibility of seeking an exemption from these limits for purposes of building
new housing. While we remain convinced that such an exemption would be appropriate given the
overwhelming demand for housing in the area, we concluded that the likelihood of being granted
the exemption was low. We have therefore decided to proceed with the new construction under
our current limited entitlements, in recognition of the high priority we have placed on the gradu
ate housing issue.
An architectural competition was held over the summer and in September President Casper
chaired an architectural selection committee. A firm headed by Daniel Solomon, from San
Francisco, was selected and has begun developing the designs for the buildings. In addition, we
selected Rudolph & Sletten, an experienced construction firm, to work directly with the architects
and our team of facilities personnel to efficiently plan the construction activities.
Further analysis of the construction schedule for these projects has led us to conclude that it
is prudent to construct the buildings in two phases rather than one. Thus, instead of attempting to
open all 480 units in September, 2000, we will now plan to open roughly half of those units. The
second phase of building will follow immediately and we expect to open the remaining units by
the fall of 2001. In the interim, to assure that the total number of units available to graduate stu
dents is not diminished, we will maintain the subsidized off-campus leases we have secured in
Sharon Green, Oak Creek and other buildings — or in equivalent buildings — until the remain
ing units are opened.
On November 12, County Supervisor Joseph Simitian will hold an open meeting in the
Annenberg Auditorium at 7:30 PM to discuss the housing situation at Stanford in preparation for
the permitting process required for the planned on-campus housing construction. I encourage you
to attend this meeting and share with Supervisor Simitian your stories and views.
Beyond this, we will continue to work with Housing Office staff to find ways to relieve
crowding in Cruthers Hall and Cruthers Memorial over the next three years and we welcome
your input on this matter. In part, our ability to reduce crowding will depend on local market con
ditions and demand.
We are also continuing our investigation of additional off-campus housing. Given the
demand not only from graduate students, but also from post-doctoral students, medical residents
and faculty, we will continue to explore all options to alleviate the housing situation.
In summary, we are making good progress on the housing problem, although much hard
work remains to be done. We appreciate the close collaboration we have had with graduate stu
dents from the Graduate Student Council and the Graduate Housing Advisory Committee,
Stephanie Toering, Robert Rudnitsky, Harris Shapiro and Karin Wahl-Jorgensen. Vice-Provost
Jim Montoya, Associate Dean Tom Wasow and Vice-Provost Geoff Cox are all available to
answer questions about these developments, as of course am I.
