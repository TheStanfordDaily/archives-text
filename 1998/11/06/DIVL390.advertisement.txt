Thanks to you, recycling is work
ing! The proof is that the paper,
plastic, steel, aluminum, and
glass that you've been recycling
is now made into all sorts of
everyday products and packages.
There's just one thing left to do:
Buy them!
Why is "Buy Recycled" impor
tant? It's simple. In order for the
materials that have been collect
ed through the local recycling
programs to have value and get
used in the manufacturing of
products, there needs to be a
demand for those new recycled
content products. You create that
demand by purchasing products
made and/or packaged with recy
cled paper, steel, aluminum,
glass, and plastic.
