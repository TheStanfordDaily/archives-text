## Starr will testify at impeachment hearings 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee
announced today that prosecutor Kenneth
Starr would be his only major witness in
impeachment hearings, and he asked Presi
dent Clinton to formally "admit or deny"
allegations about his conduct with Monica
Lewinsky.
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., said he was
sending the president a letter today asking
him "to admit or deny certain facts that
appear to be established bv the record" put
together by Starr. While the president is
"free to dispute whatever he wants," his
agreement to those allegations would "allow
us to narrow the issues and bring this matter
to a close more quickly."
Presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart
said Clinton's lawyers were still digesting
Hyde's letter and had no immediate com
ment.

On talk of expediting the inquiry. Lock
hart pronounced the streamlined hearings a
mostly positive development, but suggested
the White House wanted to wait and see
Hyde's words turn to action. "The track
record to date isn't good on this particular
issue," Lockhart said.
Starr, who has been sought more by
Democrats seeking to focus on the prosecu
tor's conduct, would testify Nov. Hyde
told Republican committee members
Wednesday that he also was considering
calling an expert witness, who would help
the panel decide whether Clinton committed
perjury.
Clinton, commenting today on the
inquiry, said, i want these hearings to be
constitutional, fair and expeditious," adding
that election results backed up his view. Vot
ers are "tired of seeing Washington focused
on politics and personalities," Clinton said.
