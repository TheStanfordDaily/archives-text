# Scientists grow 'master' cells
## Breakthrough research could lead to tissue replacement 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Researchers have isolated and grown
human embryonic master cells in a laboratory, a key step toward
possibly someday creating heart, kidney and other tissue to replace
diseased parts of the body.
Reaching a goal sought by hundreds of scientists for years,
researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore independently cultured human
stem cells, the foundation source of cells that during gestation form
all of the body's parts.
The scientists also demonstrated that the cell lines would trans
form into specific cell types, with specific functions, such as muscle,
bone or nerves.
"It opens the possibility for some dramatic new transplantation
therapies," said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of Wis
consin.
The research demonstrates for the first time that it's possible to
culture human cells that have the ability to develop into a wide
variety of human tissues, said John Gearhart.of Johns Hopkins,
author of a study to be published in the Proceedings of the Nation
al Academy of Sciences.
"For the first time we can start considering this as a source of
cell or tissue types for transplant." Gearhart said.
Although researchers long ago isolated stem cells from mice and

other laboratory animals, work on human stem cells has been
slowed by controversy. Some anti-abortion groups oppose human
embryo research because they consider such an embryo to be a
human life.
Although it may be a decade or more before any patient bene
fits from the work, Gearhart and Thomson said that stem cells
potentially could be used for a wide variety of treatments.
Thomas Okarma. research vice president of Geron Corp., a
drug research company, said his company hopes to use stem cells
to regenerate failing tissues.
"Because these cells do not age, they could be used to generate
virtually limitless supply of cells and tissue for transplantation,"
Okarma said. His firm helped to pay for some of the stem cell stud
ies.
Both Thomson and Gearhart said using their discovery to treat
patients is years away, but they argue the work could progress
faster if the government lifted its ban on financing human embryo
research.
"Within my lifetime there will be therapies based on this work."
said Thomson. "(With) public funding, it would come a lot sooner."
Neither Thomson nor Gearhart were able to direct what type of
cells developed. The transformation was random, and what causes
some cells to become muscle and others nerve is still unknown.
