GOP picks Philadelphia for convention
WASHINGTON (AP) — Philadelphia will be the site of the Republican presidential convention in 2(XX),
beating out four other finalists.
The GOP selection committee picked Philadelphia over Indianapolis, New Orleans. New York and San
Antonio. Three other cities, Chicago, Minneapolis and Charlotte, N.C., were dropped earlier in the process.
"The first president of the next millennium will be nominated in the cradle of liberty," Republican Party
Chairman Jim Nicholson said in a statement.
The choice has historic meaning for the GOP, because in 1856 Philadelphia was the host of the first Repub
lican convention. In 1948, both the Republicans and Democrats held their conventions in Philadelphia, nom
inating Thomas Dewey and Harry S. Truman.
The decision must be formally approved by the RNC membership in January, but officials said the matter
was settled for all practical purposes.
Meanwhile, officials close to the decision-making process said today that Los Angeles is almost certain to
be the Democratic convention site. Officials say party leaders are strongly leaning toward Los Angeles
because vote-rich California is critical to Democratic presidential campaign strategies.
The Democratic National Committee's site-selection committee is expected to announce its decision later
this vear.
