## Editorial Notebook Scientists as celebrities 
### 
Gould and Hawking serve
as reminders that science
holds mainstream appeal

WAS ANYBODY TRULY sur
prised that over 1,000 people
showed up to hear Stephen Jay
Ciould speak on Wednesday night?
Gould is a popular author, a renowned
scientist and one of the 20th century's most
engaging thinkers. Like others in the Presi
dential Lecture series, Gould has star
appeal. Perhaps even more so; Gould is
famous in science and humanities circles
alike.
That's why it was incredibly disappoint
ing that the facilities for Gould's talk were
so inadequate. Many of us didn't even get
the privilege of watching Gould speak on a
video screen.
Wednesday night's planning fiasco was
eerily reminiscent of another visit last year
from Stephen Hawking. Mawking's lecture
was unpublieizcd and was originally intend
ed to be an event for the physics communi
ty alone. Ushers tried valiantly to clear stu
dents from the Science and Engineering
Quad lecture hall aisles, but most of us were
allowed to stay. Wednesday night, the same
lecture hall that 1 lawking spoke in was inac
cessible to many. Students, professors and
community members spilled from the room
into the hallway, craning our ears to hear
bits of C iould's speech.
Evidently, the organizers of (iould's talk
did not realize that scientists are celebrities
too. Journalists already know this; science
covers sell consistently well at national news
magazines. Television networks know this;

programs that claim to investigate unex
plainable phenomena are lucrative
favorites. Advertisers have known it for
years; consumer products from pro-vitamin
shampoos to foot massagers claim scientific
legitimacy to lure potential buyers.
Science is such an integral part of our
culture that it is difficult to distinguish the
pseudo-science from the real stuff. Will vita
mins in shampoo strengthen your hair?
Probably not. because hair is made of long
dead cells. But do daily mega-doses of vita
min (' prevent colds? And is it true that nat
ural selection creates perfection? These are
fuzzier questions. Whether we want to stay
healthy or just want to satisfy our curiosity,
we want answers. And even if science can't
give us those answers, it offers us a frame
work in which to discuss them.
That's why it was so encouraging that the
Presidential Lectures included a visit from a
thinker with at least one foot lodged firmly
on scientific ground. For those of us who
couldn't see Gould's lecture in person, it
was also heartening to read that he spoke
on the necessity of cross-disciplinary collab
oration.
The futility of drawing distinctions
between science and the humanities is a
much-loved topic and probably doesn't
need more air time here.
What does need to be said is that regular
folks are interested in understanding how the
world works. We may not all be scientists,
but some of us want to know how planets are
born and whether genes determine our per
sonalities. Wednesday night should be a
wake-up call for those who think science
attracts a narrow crowd. Bring us more biol
ogists, physicists and explorers. But next
time, try booking a larger auditorium.
