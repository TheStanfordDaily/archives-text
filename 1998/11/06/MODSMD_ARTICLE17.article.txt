## It's not us, babycakes, it's you 
### 
WHEN I WAS a
senior in high
school, my psy
chology teacher subjected
the class to a two-week
marriage simulation.
Thanks to the chance
bowl, I married a guy

named Robin who expected me to pay his
way through medical schtxil, stay at home to
care for our IS hypothetical children, and
shuttle them to Bible study every week. Our
wedded bliss lasted for two days, at which
point I ran off with the marriage counselor
assigned to help us through our "difficul
ties."
My new husband seemed ideal — I'd had
a crush on him since freshman year—until
the chance bowl struck again and his coun
seling practice sent him to Denver. I, in turn,
was relocated to a diplomatic post in Dji
bouti.
Jason and 1 tried our hardest, but our
make-believe love was doomed to failure.
My "husband" left me for Colorado, and I
convinced the girls in my honors class to
abandon their spouses and join my witches'
coven for single women. We all agreed that
our marriages would fare better in reality.
Three years after the dissolution of the
coven, I'm no better at conquering the
chance bowl. I intended to devote this
week's column to the merits of a hometown
honey; the Dating Gods didn't agree, and I
now find myself in prime position to resur
rect the singles' club. The second Jason in
my life, my erstwhile boyfriend from South
ern California, cited "personal reasons" like
the good musician he is and disbanded, well,
us.

Agh. Boys are stupid.
Let me amend that. Boys aren't stupid;
they're miserable failures at making them
selves undersUxKl by their loved ones. Iron
ically, 1 actually believe that Jason is having
an identity crisis and wants to know who he
is and what he wants to do with his life
before he can properly address The Girl
friend. What I fail to grasp is the notion that
"all self, all the time" is the best means of
approaching relationships.
My male friends assure me that I'm in the
wrong, and that "it's a guy thing. We need to
do that sometimes."
lih-huh. My female friends, on the other
hand, assure me that his skull is lodged deep
in an orifice where it doesn't belong (didn't
that phrase clean up nicely?). They, and I,
contend that people should support their
partners through problems like his.
Friends, and boyfriends and girlfriends,
should be allies, not enemies. They offered
me the same argument last year when my
boyfriend of two years left me to "join a frat
and get smashed a lot" — I love X-chromo
some loyalty.
Female support doesn't get me very far,
though. I remain dumped, and Jason
remains firmly in the fetal position. Why, I
ask, can't men be logical, like women? Most
of the men I know are firm believers in his
philosophy that relationships come after
everything else. This is well and good, but
for the fact that adult life entails much more
than where one works, how much money
one makes and which sock one puts on first
in the morning.
One of my intended roles in life, in addi
tion to Confessional Poet and Wearer of Big
Shoes, is the Supportive Spouse. It's difficult

to imagine myself fulfilling that role with a
man who crunches up like a wounded spider
when his existence isn't perfect — and I
have yet to meet one who doesn't. Maybe I
should cackle over a cauldron instead of
wasting good lipstick on schmucks.
Then again, my mother always told me
that boys mature more slowly than girls.
Even spiders have the good sense to untan
gle themselves and start crawling around
again; I suppose I can entertain the possibil
ity that I've judged men unfairly, and that
their "guy things" have merit that I can't
grasp. If I demand exhaustive justification
for Jason's behavior, he might start asking
me why I take my five closest friends to the
restroom, or why he needs to write me a
long letter after we've just spent three hours
on the phone. Some things are best left
unexplained.
If men and women completely under
stood one another, moreover, we would
have nothing to complain about. Thousands
of marriage counselors would lose their jobs;
my high school husband, wherever he is,
would be destitute in Denver. Though he
jeopardized my psychology grade, I can't
wish that fate upon him.
It remains, then, for womankind to curb
our righteous indignation and endure the
occasional "it's not you, it's me" speech with
dignity. Jason, I suppose, can look me up
when the fetal position gets uncomfortable.
I'll be in the ladies' room with my five clos
est friends.
