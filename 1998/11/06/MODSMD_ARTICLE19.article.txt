Ciould talk poorly planned
Planners of the Presidential Lecture
Series showed a remarkable lack of fore
sight hv scheduling Stephen Jav Gould's
Nov. 4 talk in the Science and Engineering
Quad leaching Center. To think that a sci
entist as prominent as Gould would draw
fewer than 4(K) listeners (for an interdisci
plinary lecture, no less) is astonishing. Hv
6:45 p.m., both the main lecture hall and the
video-linked overflow room were full, and
hundreds of people left in frustration or had
to be turned away. Meanwhile, just a few
blocks down the street Memorial Auditori
um was vacant. I commend the President's
Office for bringing speakers such as Gould
to campus. However, in the future, better
steps need to be taken to ensure that all who
wish to participate are accommodated.

Spoon efforts hurt by changes
While I appreciate and agree with the
sentiments expressed in yesterday's editori
al. "Less food, less waste," I would like to
clarify some points made in that editorial
about Sp<x>n.
First, the editorial stated that "Dining

Services will continue to donate whatever
leftovers are available...This statement
is to my knowledge absolutely untrue. This
year all of the major dining halls on campus
have discontinued their participation in the
Spoon program, ending an 11-year relation
ship between Dining Services and Spoon.
Dining Services management now offi
cially discourages dining hall cooperation
with Spoon. Dining Services feels this deci
sion compliments its efforts at reducing
waste and costs. Even if Dining Services'
new policies are completely successful (and
I sincerely hope that they are), they will not
be able to eliminate food waste entirely.
Every day. Dining Services must esti
mate how many people will show up for a
meal and what those people are likely to
eat, not knowing which dorms are ordering
pizza or whether three-bean chili has sud
denly gone out of vogue. Spoon exists to
make sure that that chili doesn't end up in
the garbage can and is eaten by homeless
and low-income people in our community.
We provide this dunipster-lightening ser
vice free of charge. We only ask that Spoon
volunteers be allowed to come into the
kitchens after meals and collect leftover
food they cannot reuse.
It is important to realize that a donation
to Spoon is not a donation in the sense of
most donations of money or time to charita
ble organizations. The food that we collect

has no value to the dining hall.
While Spoon wholeheartedly supports
any efforts to reduce food waste, we do not
believe that Spoon subverts these goals in
any way. As I understand it, one of the pri
mary reasons that Dining Services has dis
continued its relationship with Spoon is that
the management feels that they need to
make it uncomfortable for their employees
to produce excess food. I believe that elimi
nating Spoon is completely contrary to this
goal.
Rather than enforcing a wasteful system.
Spoon highlights the importance of conserv
ing food. Over the years, many Spoon vol
unteers have commented on how working
with Spoon has taught them a greater
respect for food, a respect which yesterday's
editorial so rightly emphasized in encourag
ing students to think carefully before filling
their plates. Being involved with Spoon has
made me more conscious of food as a
resource, and a limited one at that. Without
Spoon, food is thrown away, out of sight,
out of mind.

Leg-shaving a social pressure
I would like to raise the not-much-talked
about issue of leg-shaving for which there is

not much of a forum for discussion. Or per
haps I should specify that it is not shaving
one's legs that is talked about so little.
I don't shave my legs. However, social
coercion stares me straight in the face (and
at my legs). My experiences have been that
aside from the usual media barrage, day-to
day occurrences with people attempt to rein
force this social norm. Not shaving my legs
was one issue which led to my break-up
with a boyfriend. Women and men, both
strangers and acquaintances, have taken the
liberty to rail on my preference.
For me it is a two-pronged issue. First,
shaving one's legs if female is a cultural phe
nomenon which until recently has been
restricted to the United States. In an effort
to copy Americans, it is becoming more
common in Europe for women to do so, too.
I grew up without this cultural ideal
because my parents are European. So I view
shaving / not shaving in many ways to be a
cultural diversity issue about different con
ceptions of female beauty. However, 1 have
found that the lip-service we Americans pay
to cultural diversity stops here and diversity
in female beauty is not easily tolerated.
The second aspect is that leg-shaving is
part of a double standard. Women ought to
be Barbie dolls, and hair on our legs (a nat
ural part of the human body) is too "real."
The implication is that real women are too
much. As such, leg-shaving is a manifesta

tion of patriarchy to keep women in their
place by telling them what is and what is not
acceptable for them to look like.
If it were as easy to shed pounds as it is to
use a razor to shed hair, much of the Amer
ican female population would be anorexic. I
am not advocating that all women drop their
razors and allow their leg hair to grow. 1
bring this up because shaving legs in our
society is not a matter of personal prefer
ence such as growing beards is for men.
Ihe problem is that un-shaven legs on
any woman is considered "disgusting,"
"revolting," "unsightly." (how often have I
heard this!), rather than a matter of person
al opinion. It is, quite frankly, condemned
and this makes women feel that with hair on
their legs, they aren't sexually desirable nor
should they dare to feel that they are.

Pressing issues besides grapes
I am very tired of all this discussion of
grapes. I do not care. No one I know cares.
We care about more pressing issues. Unless
grapes are being thrown at bikers from
Hoover Tower, it is not an issue worthy of a
huge full-page spread in the Daily.
Whether they serve grapes in the dining
halls is irrelevant. I do not need grapes to
survive. Heek, I could probably even sur
vive without fruit. While I haven't lived in a
dorm since freshman year, I do believe

Wilbur Dining serves other food, possibly
even other fruits, besides grapes.
Also what about raisins. Does this mean
we need to watch videos and have elaborate

discussions about (hem too? I learned in
one of my Communication classes that
raisins are really just dried grapes.
My advice is simple. Dining Service

should serve kiwis instead; the Daily should
focus their attention on real news that
affects people, like a meeting that draws six
people; and the Marguerite should stop in

front of the Deke house

For me it is a two-pronged issue. First,
shaving one's legs if female is a cultural phe
nomenon which until recently has been
restricted to the United States. In an effort
to copy Americans, it is becoming more
common in Europe for women to do so, too.
I grew up without this cultural ideal
because my parents are European. So I view
shaving / not shaving in many ways to be a
cultural diversity issue about different con
ceptions of female beauty. However, 1 have
found that the lip-service we Americans pay
to cultural diversity stops here and diversity
in female beauty is not easily tolerated.
The second aspect is that leg-shaving is
part of a double standard. Women ought to
be Barbie dolls, and hair on our legs (a nat
ural part of the human body) is too "real."
The implication is that real women are too
much. As such, leg-shaving is a manifesta

tion of patriarchy to keep women in their
place by telling them what is and what is not
acceptable for them to look like.
If it were as easy to shed pounds as it is to
use a razor to shed hair, much of the Amer
ican female population would be anorexic. I
am not advocating that all women drop their
razors and allow their leg hair to grow. 1
bring this up because shaving legs in our
society is not a matter of personal prefer
ence such as growing beards is for men.
Ihe problem is that un-shaven legs on
any woman is considered "disgusting,"
"revolting," "unsightly." (how often have I
heard this!), rather than a matter of person
al opinion. It is, quite frankly, condemned
and this makes women feel that with hair on
their legs, they aren't sexually desirable nor
should they dare to feel that they are.

Pressing issues besides grapes
I am very tired of all this discussion of
grapes. I do not care. No one I know cares.
We care about more pressing issues. Unless
grapes are being thrown at bikers from
Hoover Tower, it is not an issue worthy of a
huge full-page spread in the Daily.
Whether they serve grapes in the dining
halls is irrelevant. I do not need grapes to
survive. Heek, I could probably even sur
vive without fruit. While I haven't lived in a
dorm since freshman year, I do believe

Wilbur Dining serves other food, possibly
even other fruits, besides grapes.
Also what about raisins. Does this mean
we need to watch videos and have elaborate

discussions about (hem too? I learned in
one of my Communication classes that
raisins are really just dried grapes.
My advice is simple. Dining Service

should serve kiwis instead; the Daily should
focus their attention on real news that
affects people, like a meeting that draws six
people; and the Marguerite should stop in

front of the Deke house
