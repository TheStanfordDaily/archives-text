### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
The arrest and detention in
China of Stanford scholar Hua Di
may affect the prospects for a Stan
ford overseas program in Beijing,
but the Overseas Studies Program
is continuing as planned to develop
a proposal that will soon he consid
ered by the administration.
According to Terry Shepard, di
rector of University Communica
tions. University President Ger
hard Casper thinks Hua's impris
onment complicates the center's
future. Casper expressed his "wari
ness" at last Thursday's Faculty
Senate meeting in reference to a

Stanford-in-Beijing program.
"It may be worthwhile to keep
talking about [the campus], but
when decision-making time comes,
I don't know what will happen with
that," Shepard said.
Russell Berman. director of
Overseas Studies, has said that the
Hua situation will not affect the
proposal outlining plans to estab
lish a Stanford-in-Beijing campus.
"We are continuing to prepare a
proposal for a program in Beijing,
and we hope to submit it to the
Dean's office soon." said Berman.
"When we submit a proposal, it is
based on the expectation that we
can provide a high-quality academ
ic experience for Stanford stu
dents. Any other issues pertinent
to the University are handled else
where."
Hua, who is a missile expert and
senior research associate at the
Center for International Security
and Cooperation at Stanford, was
arrested on Jan. 6 in Beijing, where
he was attending a family memori
al service. This information was
not made public until last month.
Hua'scolleagues have been lob
bying the Chinese government.

urging his release, but so far, to no
avail. Concern for Hua not only
centers around his detention but
also his health. Hua suffers from a
rare form of male breast cancer
and requires consistent medical
treatment, which he was receiving
in the United States.
"[llua| suffers from malignant
cancer and should be permitted to
return to his treatment in Califor
nia." Casper said in the Palo Alto
Weekly.
Last week, Hua's case was re
ferred to the West District Peo
ple's Proeuratorate for procedural
reasons. A trial date has not been
set.
University administrators have

not responded publicly to this re
cent motion, but individual faculty
members are continuing to send
letters to the Chinese government
expressing their protest.
"It is pretty hard to tell what
kind of influence the University
would have [on the case)," said
Assoc. Provost Ann Fletcher.
"This is pure speculation on my
part, but in terms of a university
and a country, I don't know how
much influence we'd have."
The issue of the Beijing campus
was brought up by members of the

be further discussed at their up
coming meeting this Tuesday,
which Casper will attend.
