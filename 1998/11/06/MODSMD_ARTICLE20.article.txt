WHEN MY REVOLUTION
comes, I'll climb up to the adver
tising billboards in Times Square
and with a giant roar from the crowd below,
topple those lying rectangles once and for all.
Of course, my revolution will never hap
pen, and only an idiot would object so
strongly to something that pays for free tele
vision. But advertising pays for a vast major
ity of what we see and hear. In the late 20th
century, it should be remembered that tele
vision doesn't exist to provide you with
entertainment; it's there to sell you, the view
ers, to the advertisers. They have made you
into a product, and all you did was sit on your
couches for three hours every evening.
Advertising is nothing like propaganda.
Propaganda has the decency to be untrue;
even if it is fabrication, at least it leaves the
facts alone and unmolested. Advertising, on
the other hand, will warp the fabric of truth

before it stoops to tell an honest lie.
One of the best recent examples is
Apple's latest ad campaign. Dead people —
Ghandi, John Coltrane, Lucille Ball — have
their pictures placed underneath the caption,
"Think Different."
What twisted necromancy is this? Ghan
di spent most of his life resisting technology's
hollow progress, and now that he's dead he
suddenly supports user-friendly operating
systems. Are we to presume that were Ghan
di still alive, he wouid drop all his previous
concerns over imperialism and hunger strike
until Microsoft uncoupled its World Wide
Web browser from Windows 98?
Obviously, these ads are meant to remind
us that Apple is a rebellious institution.
Ghandi was a rebel because he managed to
liberate an entire subcontinent from Imperi
al tyranny. And why is Apple rebellious?
In case you've forgotten, it's because

Apple developed the mouse. In advertising's
hands, rebellion is no longer a matter of
storming the Bastille. It becomes a matter of
buying Pepsi rather than Coke or remember
ing to yell when you drink Surge.
But ' Think Different" doesn't lie, no
matter how ungrammatical it is. It rewrites
history by ripping the past out of context and
manipulating it like a puppet dangling on a
string of inference.
And. worst of all. I fall for it every time.
Whether I buy their products or not. adver
tising explains to me that I'm better off living
in a world where amazing gadgets are avail
able, where phones are mobile, soft drinks
more caffeinated, detergent kinder to colors
and teeth whiter than white. 1 can forget
about all the usual indicators of well-being,
quality, democracy and freedom, just so long
as I remember that the pursuit of happiness
is exactlv the same thing as buving it.

Adbusters, a Canadian group, promoted
a "Buy Nothing" day last year with an ad
showing a guzzling pig and some frightening
statistics about U.S. over-consumption. NBC
and CBS refused to run the ad, despite the
fact that Adbusters had enough cash.
According to the Wall Street Journal,
NBC wouldn't run it because it was "inimical
to our legitimate business interests." CBS
carefully explained that the concept of buy
ing nothing was"in opposition to the current
economic policy in the United States." In
Victorian times consumption was like
cholera — you were meant to die from it.
Now it's the backbone of economic policy.
The final twist, of course, is that advertis
ing is impervious to assault. If you become
cynical about ads, ads happily join you in
your cynicism: "Oh veah, ads are stupid. Buy
our product." You can fight the system all
you want. If you look good doing it, the sys

tem can still use you to sell their products.
Hence, Ghandi's newfound love of software.
Similarly, when the St. Mark's Bookstore
in New York was confronted with a rather
anti-capitalist quote on a promotional poster
for the "Communist Manifesto" re-issue, the
store solved the dilemma by simply replacing
the word "workers" with "shoppers" —
"Shoppers of the world unite you have noth
ing to lose but your chains." United shoppers
— now there's an untroubling thought.
Meanwhile, in Latin America, millions
fight against tyrannies supported by U.S. cor
porations and have sacrificed their lives for a
small hope of dignity. And all for what? So
that a chihuahua dressed as Che Guevera
can tell you that Taco Bell is staging a "revo
lution" in Mexican fast food.
