# A 						View from the Hill
## Smear ads are a part of dirty democracy 
### 
Matthew H. Blumenstein

THE ELECTION IS over but you can
still smell the stench. The recent cam
paigns were dirty, nasty affairs domi
nated by smear ads and negative campaign
ing. This has become a trite observation in
my short experience with American politics,
but this election was the worst I've seen yet.
Watching campaigns unfold over the last few
months has put into sharp focus many of the
reasons politics has become a dirty word and
our flag-bearing democracy seems to be trip
ping over itself.
I will admit that I have not been the coun
try's most active voter. Television ads. news
paper headlines and the occasional leaflet
furnish most of my information. This makes
me no different than most all of our voting
public, which consists of less than 50 percent
of our nation's eligible citizens.
Certainly the best remedy for our democ
racy is active participation by the electorate.
I am part of the problem. I should read bills
and voting records. I should seek out unbi
ased statistics regarding issues that are
important to me. I should contact candidates
and ask for all the info they've got. I don't,

though, and few people do.
Widespread active participation in gov
ernment is a great normative solution
removed from the more immediate reality.
The immediate reality is smear ads and neg
ative campaigning.
In the months preceding the election, I
learned that Dan Lungren opposes school
lunches and education for the handicapped.
He likes machine guns, too. Matt Fong takes
dirty campaign money. Barbara Boxer is too
damn liberal to represent California — plus,
she's a racist. There's more dirt I could give
you. but you've probably already heard it.
Enemy candidates are portrayed at their
worst moments with sensational imagery.
This trash illustrates and perpetuates many
of the problems our democracy faces. Politi
cal television advertising is one such prob
lem.
Watching television is a notoriously mind
less occupation. A viewer immersed in an
episode of "The Simpsons" or "Seinfeld" can
hardly be expected to shoot upright and pay
attention to a political ad. The more likely
scenario has the viewer staring blank-eyed at

the screen, reaching for another Dorito.
Advertisers know this. They shoot for unfa
vorable impressions and associations border
ing on unconscious. They apparently believe
that informative ads regarding their candi
date will have little impact compared to sen
sational smearing of the opposing candidate.
The last thing they want is to awaken the
viewer's intellect. If that happens, he'll real
ize what a sleazy ad he's watching.
Advertising costs money. To really smear
someone well, utilizing all of the latest
research in psychology and communications,
you need to lay down the big bucks. The can
didate with more money gets more negative
ads produced by better advertising firms.
And an overwhelming number of people get
political information from these ads.
In the 1994 and 1995, a combined 90 per
cent of California elections were won by the
candidate who raised more money. Most of
that money went into television advertising.
Most of the ads I saw this year were neg
ative. Considering the amount of money
coming from special interest groups, this is a
doubly disturbing trend. Special-interest

groups finance politicians who resort to neg
ative campaigns. Campaign finance reform
seems essential, but there are intricate legal
issues involved. A constitutional amendment
is among the only ways to implement drastic
reform.
Even with reform, it's possible our politi
cal climate would still be inundated by nega
tivity and finger pointing. Campaigns might
still be run not to promote a candidate but to
destroy another. People might still vote
against candidates instead of voting for can
didates.
No wonder the political profession holds
a horrendous connotation these days. Candi
dates' lives are viciously dissected and dis
torted in front of millions.
It has become easier to believe negative
attacks than positive stands. It was powerful
to hear Bush declare "Read my lips, no new
taxes." It was more powerful to see Clinton
debunk him. It was comforting to hear Clin
ton assure us there was no relationship; it was
horrifying to watch him exposed. We face
campaign promises with skepticism and
attacks with a gossipy eagerness. Politicians

paint each other as liars and crooks, and we
see them all that way.
How do we get out of this rut?
The obvious answer is for candidates to
take the moral high ground. They could steer
clear of negative ads, campaign for what they
believe in.and. most importantly, not tell lies
or double-talk. Special interests dictate cam
paign strategies because they have the
money to fund television ads that are pre
dominately negative. Morally conscious can
didates may fight this formula, but I don't see
many profiting from it.
Despite my superficial information, I am
very assured in my choices for office. Invari
ably, it's because I dislike the other candidate
more. In a sense then, this current system
leaves one satisfied if the lesser of two evils
wins. Campaigns run on smear ads and neg
ativity, however, ultimately contribute to dis
enchantment with the government and its
methods.

Matthew Blumenstein, a junior majoring in
psychology, wishes he could have voted for
"Governor Body" in Minnesota.
