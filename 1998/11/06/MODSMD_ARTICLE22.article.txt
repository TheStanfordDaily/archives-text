## SOCCER — SENIOR DAY Men try to claw to top of MPSF 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Another weekend and yet another pair of cru
cial games.
The No. 8 Stanford men's soccer team (13-4,
4-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will play
its final home games of the regular season against
UC-lrvine (8-9,2-4) tonight and No. 14Cal State-
Fullerton (12-4-1,5-1) on Sunday.
As the regular season winds down, the Cardi
nal is trying to secure itself a postseason berth
and a possible playoff game at home. The confer
ence champion receives an automatic tourna
ment invitation, but the other teams must receive
at-large bids.
"These games are critical to getting to the
playoffs, but also to gaining a home advantage.
They are vitally important for those two rea
sons," said Stanford head coach Bobby Clark.
Although currently riding a five-game home
winning streak. Stanford finds itself fourth in the
MPSF due to its two conference losses coming
against UCLA and Cal Poly-San Louis Obispo.
On top of the conference are Washington,
UCLA and Fullerton, each with one loss. All
three cannot finish the season with only one loss
as the Bruins and Huskies have yet to meet, so
the Cardinal needs to stay on pace.
And as these are the last regular-season home
games, they are conceivably the last games the
squad's seven seniors will have on the Farm. The
seniors, who will be honored in a ceremony prior
to Sunday's match, hope this won't be the last
home game.
"What the seniors would like most of all is to
have a few more games at New Maloney field,"
Bobbv Clark said. " They have had a fabulous

four years and what they would like best is to ex
tend this."
If Stanford can duplicate its play from last
weekend, Irvine and Fullerton will have their
hands full. The Cardinal regained its momentum,
capturing the Cal-Adidas Legacy Classic title
with solid victories over then-No. 10 St. John's
and Rider. 1-0 and 2-0, respectively.

MEN S SOCCER
■ Tonight: No. 8 Stanford (13-4,4-2 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) vs. UC-lrvine (8-9,2-4), 7
p.m. New Maloney Field.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. No. 14 Cal State-Fullerton
(12-4-1,5-1), 3 p.m. New Maloney Field.

"We have been playing well and got a couple
of results that we wanted last weekend. If we
keep doing things right, we can get a couple more
results," said senior midfielder Simon Elliott,
who was named to the all-tournament team
along with fellow seniors Shan Gaw, Jamie Clark
and redshirt sophomore Adam Zapala.
It was defender Jamie Clark, who was named
to the Soccer America team of the week, provid
ing the heroics with the only goal in the 1-0 upset
against St. John's. Senior captain A.J. Sauer con
tributed with a goal and an assist in the Rider
game. Jamie Clark, Elliott and Sauer currently
lead the team with live goals apiece. Elliott and
Gaw each have five assists.
Exemplifying the depth of the squad, with the
assist hv redshirt-sophomore Chris Gores on
Sauer's last goal. 14 of the 18 players who have
seen game time have contributed points.
And while the offense has been spread
throughout the squad, the defense has also been

a total team effort. Stanford possesses the No. 2
defense in the country, having allowed seven
goals all season. Zapala has recorded 12 shutouts,
and the defense in front of him has caused him to
make only 38 saves all season. In comparison, the
Cardinal has forced opposing goalies to make 60
saves.
Stanford's defense will he matched up against
the potent offense of Fullerton's Titans on Sun
day. The Titans have the MPSF's second- and
third- highest goal scorers in junior forward
Colbv Jackson (14) and sophomore Art Ramirez
(13).
Fullerton provided one the nation's biggest
upsets earlier this season, defeating then-No. 2
UCLA 2-1. This game turned heads around the
country and threw the Titans into the MFSF con
ference title race and national rankings. Fullerton
also lost a close match to No. 7 Washington 2-1.
Even though the Titans are a more highly
touted team than the Anteaters, Bobby Clark
stresses that his team will not look past tonight's
match.
"The Irvine game is the one to focus on. The
[Fullerton] game will look after itself," Bobby
Clark said.
Irvine is led by senior Pat Lee, who has 10
goals, and 11 other members of the team have
scored. The Anteaters have played tough games
against both Washington and UCLA, losing each
by only a goal.
No matter the opponent, however, Bobby
Clark articulates his goals more broadly.
"Our goal is to put in a complete performance.
We have put in some good performances, but not
for the full 90 minutes. This is a test for us. to re
ally concentrate and take the game for the full 90
minutes," Bobby Clark said.
