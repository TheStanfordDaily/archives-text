# Women hope for Nationals berth
## 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team, a squad that has endured three
exhaustive road trips in the past
three weekends, wraps up its regular
season competition at New Maloney
Field this weekend.
The Cardinal (9-6-2, 3-4 Pacific
10 Conference) takes on the un
ranked Oregon schools in games
that will precede both of the men's
soccer games this weekend.
Stanford finds itself in a similar
scenario as last year: the team must
win all of its games in order to main
tain its NCAA tournament ambi
tions. A tie with Arizona last year in
the Cardinal's final game of the sea
son ended Stanford's prospects of
obtaining a bid via the NCAA tour
nament selection committee.
"We have no option but to win
both of our games," said senior mid
fielder Christy Stoffel. "ltd be a
shame if our season ended after this
weekend."
The Cardinal, traditionally a Pac
-10 powerhouse, now faces the possi

bility of a losing conference record
unless the team emerges victorious
in both of its matchups this weekend.

WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Tonight: Stanford (9-6-2, 3-4 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. Oregon
State (6-10-1, 1-6), 5 p.m. New Mal
onev Field.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Oregon (5-2-
2,3-4), I p.m. New Maloney Field.

Stanford enters this series with
renewed confidence due to its two
victories last weekend against Wash
ington and Washington State. The
Cardinal defeated the Huskies, who
then sat atop the Pac-10 standings,
showing the playing caliber that
Stanford is capable of.
To obtain success this weekend,
the Cardinal must play aggressively
for both halves and not allow the
playing intensity to diminish.
"I'll be satisfied if our team plays
hard for 90 minutes," said head
coach Steve Swanson. "I'm very
confident we will be successful."
This weekend. Stanford must

mirror the aggressive playing style it
demonstrated during the Washing
ton game in which the Cardinal out
shot the Huskies 9-0 in the first half.
"We have been moving well and
getting chances," Swanson said. "We
must be a little more intense, a little
more forceful. This weekend, it is im
portant to play hard and not leave
anything at the end of the day."
The Cardinal returns to competi
tion at 5 p.m. this afternoon against
the Oregon State Beavers (6-10-1.1-
6), a team which has its own strug
gles in Pac-10 competition.
Swanson also asserts the impor
tance of not looking beyond today's
game.
"Every game counts," Swanson
said. " This one just happens to be at
the end of the season. The last game
gets so much attention, but the other
games are no less significant."
Two days later, Stanford will
square off against the Oregon Ducks
(5-2-2, 3-4). The Ducks, who also
enter their final games of the season,
will compete with increased motiva
tion as they also strive to obtain a
coveted tournament invitation.

season games when they host the Oregon schools.
