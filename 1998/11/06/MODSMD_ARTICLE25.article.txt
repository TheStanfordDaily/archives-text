# Swimming aims for speed

After competing against one of its
biggest challengers of the season, the
top-ranked Stanford men's swim
team returns to the water today. The
Cardinal will swim against two Divi
sion II schools, ( ;il State-Bakersfield
and San Francisco State at 2 p.m. at
deGuerrc pool. This is Stanford's
first three-way meet of its young sea
son, but it is the last scored meet of
the fall.
Last weekend. Stanford swam
against No. 3 Texas, beating them by
one point. Texas provided a great
challenge to Stanford, forcing them
to race for places and points rather
than times.
Swimming against two schools
that are not as competitive as Texas
will give the Cardinal swimmers an
other kind of challenge and goal for
the meet: concentrating more on
their individual times rather than on
winning the meet, since it should be
an easy victory.
"We are going to be racing our
selves and racing the clock at this
meet," said junior breaststroker
Steve Ronson. "The meet will be an
opportunity for us to gauge our train

ing."
Not only arc Cal State-Bakers
field and San Francisco State not in
the same division and thus less com
petitive. but this meet will be the first
dual meet of the season for both
teams.
The Cardinal has been undergo
ing the hardest part of its season and
some grueling practices, as well as
enduring dry-land training. Many of
the team members are broken down
from the arduous exercise and there
fore do not have as competitive of
times as thev would if they were in
top. tapered form.
"We are gauging [ourselves]
against previous meets of the season
and comparing these times to the
times we got at this point last sea
son." said sophomore sprinter An
thony Robinson.
The improvements that Stanford
is working on are based not only on
swimming technique, but also on the
fine points of racing.
"We are looking for a racing envi
ronment," said freshman Zac Mof
fat. "You cannot emulate the intensi
ty of meets in practice and we are try
ing to work on refining the points of
swimming."
For the Cardinal, everv race is an

other chance to improve and work
toward the final goal of winning the
NCAA Championships in March.
"The key [in races] is starts and
turns. When we get to NCAAs it is
what you do going into and coming
off of the walls that really makes the
race," Moffat said.

â–  Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford vs. Cal
State-Bakersfield and San Francisco
State, 2 p.m. DeGuerre Pool.

Training-wise, the team goes
through many stages. The team
members are currently in the phase
of working themselves to their maxi
mum potential. The way that they
prepare for both the conference
championships and nationals is by
cutting back on yardage and dry-land
training in order to conserve energy
and use it to swim faster times.
"Every meet is like a practice for
the NCA As. Every time wc have the
opportunity to race, it prepares us for
the final meet of the year." Robinson
said
"The team is ahead of pace and
the team is in good shape. We are
ready to commit for another NCAA
championship," Robinson said.
