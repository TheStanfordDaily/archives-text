Cat Burglar Hits Toyon
Early Sunday morning, an unidentified burglar stole a computer, jewelry
and other gixxls from a rcx)m in Toyon.
The theft occurred while the victims were home, according to Stanford
Police Lt. Del Bandy. After the victims went to bed in the inner room, the sus
pect climbed into the outer room through a window cracked open for venti
lation.
"It takes a different personality to climb in and steal things while people
are there," said Bandy.
The suspect climbed on a construction A-frame barricade to enter the
room.
()nce inside, the burglar emptied out one of the students' backpacks and
loaded it with various items including jewelry, CDs, and a calculator. He also
stole one computer which was not locked. The suspect attempted to steal an
other computer, but because it was secured, he could not remove it.
"The community should be aware that security measures work, some
times," said Bandy.
Although the suspect remains at large, police recovered fingerprints and
the case is still under investigation.
"This could be a crime of opportunity," said Bandy. According to Bandy,
police do not want to give the public the impression that there is a serial cat
burglar.
The case does not appear to be related to the computer theft at Toyon sev
eral weeks ago which involved a suspect still at large who was discovered
stealing a computer and was later chased by the victim.
Pedestrians Injured in Car Accidents
Within the past two weeks, two pedestrians have been struck by cars on
campus.
Around ft p.m. Monday evening, a jogger sustained moderate injuries
after being hit by a vehicle at the corner of Campus Drive and Galvez Street.
The jogger, a postdoctoral fellow who prefers to remain anonymous, was
taken to Stanford I Jniversity Medical ( enter by Palo Alto Fire Department
paramedics and treated for a hip injury and other abrasions.
She remarked that the driver was not at fault.

The jogger is taking a few days oft work and encouraged students "to be
careful after dark."
Ilie incident comes less than two weeks after a bicyclist was hit in front of
Florence Moore Hall on Mayfield Avenue.
The victim, freshman Kevin Lim, was transported by paramedics to Stan
ford University Medical Center for treatment and was released.
"According to witnesses, the driver blew a stop sign at 15 miles per hour,"
said Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy. The stop sign, which is between Tresid
der and Florence Moore Hall on Mayfield, was new to campus at of the be
ginning of fall quarter. Before the stop sign, students crossed in an uncon
trolled crosswalk.
According to the University Planning Office, no prior accident prompted
the installation of a stop sign; rather, students voiced a concern to make the
crossing between Tresidder and Flo Mo safer.
"We wanted to make the crosswalk there as safe and obvious as it can be,"
said Roger Whitney, director of Student Housing Services.
Whitney also said that the crosswalk was designed so that drivers know
the stop sign is coming and pedestrians have clear visibility. However, "stu
dents should always be looking both ways."
"I believe the stop sign is pretty visible and the bumps in the road do alert
drivers," said freshman David Fidler. who arrived on the scene before the fire
department.
Fidler and a friend, who happened to be an emergency medical techni
cian, both treated Lim upon arrival.
" The patient was stable when we got there," Fidler said. They monitored
Lim's condition until the fire department arrived.
Stanford Police is sending the case to the district attorney's office to de
termine whether charges should be filed against the driver, a University em
ployee who was driving with a suspended license.
Students Receive Threatening Calls
Three female students received threatening phone calls from an uniden
tified man between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Friday. The victims, who are all se
niors, prefer to remain anonymous.
The first victim said that the caller threatened to sexually assault her and

her friends. The suspect identified her and her Iriends by name.
"He knew things about me," she said. "He wouldn't give his name and was
really evasive. Then he began naming some of my friends."
She hung up after the suspect said he wanted to rape her and two of her
friends.
The caller then phoned the second victim, who is in the same sorority as
the first. After the second call, both victims called Stanford Police.
The suspect then phoned a third victim. After saying, "Do you recognize
my voice," the caller said, "I'm going to come over there and fuck you.'
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy said Stanford Police is classifying the calls
as "threatening" and not "annoying," "primarily because of the obscene
speech," he said.
Stanford Police are actively investigating these cases.
Burglary at Bookstore
Last Friday, four thieves stole more than $50(3 worth of merchandise from
the Stanford Bookstore. Stanford Police detained four suspects including
two juveniles and one temporary employee of the Bookstore.
According to Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy, the temporary employee
pretended to ring up merchandise for friends and relatives.
Peggy Mendelson. Stanford Bookstore president, attributed their quick
capture to the Bookstore's security staff and cameras.
"We're pleased that we have security staff and employees that were able
to help right away," said Mendelson.
Karen Park, Bookstore marketing manager, stressed that the Bookstore
does not have a serious problem with theft.
Mendelson said that it is "quite unusual" and "very rare" for an employ
ee to be involved in theft at the bookstore.
The temporary agency through which the employee was hired was re
sponsible for the pre-screening of this employee, not the Bookstore.
Stanford Police recovered all of the stolen property, mostly clothing.
"We're still following up to see if there are additional thefts and addition
al suspects," said Bandy.
