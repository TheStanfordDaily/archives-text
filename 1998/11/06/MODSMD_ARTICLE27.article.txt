# Football team looks for first conference victory
## Cardinal hopes to continue improvement vs. USC 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
There are as many reactions to a 1-7 start as there are
players on the Stanford football team: despair, disap
pointment. and frustration all make appearances in the
postgame press conferences.
And sometimes, resolve.
"It's time we start winning games. We've been close so
many times. 1 want to come to the locker room knowing
we outscored an opponent."

FOOTBALL
■ Tomorrow: Stanford (1 -7,0-5 Pacific 10 Conference) vs.
USC (6-3, 4-2). 3:30 p.m. Stanford Stadium. TV: KICIJ
(SCTVCh.36). RADIO: KTCT(IISO AM),KZSU(9O.I
FM).

So said Stanford (1-7,0-5 Pacific 10 Conference) quar
terback Todd 1 lusnk after last week's demoralizing loss to
No. 2 IJCLA. Moments earlier, Stanford was just two
yards away from pulling the biggest upset of the decade
when Bruin linebacker Marques Anderson stripped the
ball away from C ardinal flanker Jeff Allen. I he ball was
recovered by the Bruins in the end zone, sealing the
squeak-by victory for I J( 'LA.
Stanford will try to rebound from that crushing blow
and win its first conference game of the year tomorrow
against USC' (6-3, 4-2). The Trojans face tough games at
UCLA and against Notre Dame after their visit to Stan
ford Stadium, and need one more conference win to be
come bowl-eligible.
USC will try to exploit the same speed matchups that

plagued the Cardinal on its trip to Eugene. In that game,
Oregon tailback Reuben Droughns and the Duck re
ceivers ran circles around the slower Stanford defense for
over 600 yards of total offense.
"I don't think it's any secret that [USC's] a very good
football team," said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "They're fast."
Of particular concern to the peaking Stanford defense
is junior flanker R. Jay Soward, who has averaged a touch
down every six times he touches the ball at USC.
"He runs by people. He runs through people," said
USC coach Paul Hackett. "He's just a marvelous football
player. It's not just the talent. It's the energy he creates on
the football field and how that permeates the rest of the
team. (Jetting the ball in R. Jay's hands is a priority."
Soward has terrorized the Pac-10 for 20 plays of 40
yards or more and six games with over 200 all-purpose
yards. His best effort this season occurred against San
Diego State, as he racked up 256 all-purpose yards and
three touchdowns on just nine plays.
"Soward may be the most explosive athlete in this con
ference, and that's saying something because this confer
ence has a lot of darn good athletes," Willingham said.
Another worry for the Stanford defense is freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer, who shined in last week's
start against Washington, going 18-for-31 for yards
and a touchdown.
"Once lie found out where his classrooms were and
where his dormitory was, he was able to do better and bet
ter with concepts and with his teammates," Hackett said.
"After the ()regon game, I felt it was time for him to be the
starter. So we made the change. The change will be in
place for the rest of the season."

Fortunately, the Cardinal defense has improved mea
surably in its last three games. Though winless in that span,
Stanford has allowed 5.6 fewer points per game than it had
in its first five games, including holding No. 2 UCLA to 28

points, its lowest total of the season.
"I'm very proud of our football team's improvement,"
Willingham said. "Our football team has been strong, and
it's stayed intact."
