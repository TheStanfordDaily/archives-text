■ Tonight: No. 3 Stanford vs. Tai
wan National Team, 7:30 p.m.
Maples Pavilion. Inhibition.

In its lirsl appearance since Car
dinal ( liaos. Stanford will play the
first of ils two exhibition games
when il serves as the third host on
the laiwan National team's tour,
tonight at 7:30.
After returning all five starters
from the Cardinal's l inal Four
team of last season, Stanford has
had more preseason hype than ever
and expectations are high.
"It's a nice problem to have,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We have to avoid
everybody else's expectations
|though| and deal with our own."
Perhaps Montgomery's greatest
problem tonight will come in terms
of figuring out what kind of rotation
would best benefit his star-studded
team and experienced players.
"It's going to be the first time

they're going to be looking at how
the playing time works itself out in a
40-minute game," Montgomery
said. "It's really different from prac
tice where we are playing five-on
five and 10 guys get to play every
day. That's going to be a rude awak
ening.
"We've got some guys that are
really playing well and all deserve
to play. But maybe there is not
going to be the time that they would
think they might get to play. I've got
real good players that won't start."
In addition" tonight's game will
serve as a test of what Stanford
needs to work on in the remaining
week before the Preseason NTT
Tournament.
"You need to get a gauge of
where you are, what you need to
work on, how you react in front of a
crowd and how kids come off the
bench," Montgomery added.
Another aspect that Mont
gomery will be trying to gauge
tonight is the progress of redshirt
freshman center Jason Collins's re
habilitation of his knee. While
frayed meniscus cartilage kept him
on the bench last year, Collins
should play a crucial role for Stan
ford this season should his knee
hold up.
"We've got to gel him ready to
play but I don't want to push the
knee beyond the point it is ready to
go," Montgomery said. "We're still
trying to find a formula that will
work for him in terms of how much
he can accommodate."
