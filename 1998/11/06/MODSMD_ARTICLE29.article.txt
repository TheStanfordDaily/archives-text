## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
With just one game standing in the
way of a first-place finish, the No. 2
Stanford men's water polo team is
ready to get clown to business.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal (15-5, ft
-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) hosts the No. 1 USC Trojans
(17-1, 5-0) in Stanford's last MPSF
match of the season. After downing
then-N0.2 UCLA 7-5 last weekend,
Stanford is in a three-way tie for sec
ond place with UCLA and UC-
Irvine.
But if the Cardinal can defeat the
Trojans. Stanford is guaranteed to at
least a share of first place in the
MPSF.

MEN S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (15-5,
6-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. No. 1 USC (17-1, 5-0), 12
p.m. DeGuerre Pool.

"We need to beat USC so we're at
least guaranteed a tie for first," said
Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti. "1 low they break the tie will
be determined later" when the seed
ing for the MPSF championship tour
nament begins.
Even if Stanford doesn't end up
on top, the squad needs to have the
best possible record to give it a shot at
the second slot at the NCAA tourna
ment. which is based on the teams'
final records. Stanford also still has a
shot at the first spot, which will go to
the winner of the MPSF tournament.
Last weekend. Stanford lost to
USC 7-5 in a non-league match in

Southern California.
"Last week we had to prepare for
UCLA," Dettamanti said. "We
spent probably HO percent of our
time on UCLA and only about 20
percent on USC. This time, it's l (X)
percent USC."
One of the biggest obstacles in

playing against the I ISC squad is hav
ing to adjust to the Trojans' distinctly
European style of play.
"We had a hard time with our 6-
on-5 because they play a European
defense which is different than all the
other teams," said redshirt sopho
more Sean Joy.

"They're very strong in all phases
of the game," Dettamanti said. "One
of their strengths is their outside
shooting and they have a lot of good
countering experience with the Eu
ropeans."
