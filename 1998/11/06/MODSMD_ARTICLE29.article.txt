# No. 2 Polo in showdown vs. No. 1 USC
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
With just one game standing in the
way of a first-place finish, the No. 2
Stanford men's water polo team is
ready to get clown to business.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal (15-5, ft
-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) hosts the No. 1 USC Trojans
(17-1, 5-0) in Stanford's last MPSF
match of the season. After downing
then-N0.2 UCLA 7-5 last weekend,
Stanford is in a three-way tie for sec
ond place with UCLA and UC-
Irvine.
But if the Cardinal can defeat the
Trojans. Stanford is guaranteed to at
least a share of first place in the
MPSF.

MEN S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (15-5,
6-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. No. 1 USC (17-1, 5-0), 12
p.m. DeGuerre Pool.

"We need to beat USC so we're at
least guaranteed a tie for first," said
Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti. "1 low they break the tie will
be determined later" when the seed
ing for the MPSF championship tour
nament begins.
Even if Stanford doesn't end up
on top, the squad needs to have the
best possible record to give it a shot at
the second slot at the NCAA tourna
ment. which is based on the teams'
final records. Stanford also still has a
shot at the first spot, which will go to
the winner of the MPSF tournament.
Last weekend. Stanford lost to
USC 7-5 in a non-league match in

Southern California.
"Last week we had to prepare for
UCLA," Dettamanti said. "We
spent probably HO percent of our
time on UCLA and only about 20
percent on USC. This time, it's l (X)
percent USC."
One of the biggest obstacles in

playing against the I ISC squad is hav
ing to adjust to the Trojans' distinctly
European style of play.
"We had a hard time with our 6-
on-5 because they play a European
defense which is different than all the
other teams," said redshirt sopho
more Sean Joy.

"They're very strong in all phases
of the game," Dettamanti said. "One
of their strengths is their outside
shooting and they have a lot of good
countering experience with the Eu
ropeans."

Junior Sean Joy and the No. 2 men's water polo team will look to upset No. 1 USC and jump to the top
of the MPSF standings.
Although two of USC's interna
tional players are among the leading
scorers in the MPSF, Stanford's of
fense can counter with Brian Heif
feron and Layne Beaubien, who are
also among the top 10 in the league
in scoring.
But Stanford's greatest strength
these days is found in its defense. Se
nior goalie C'hris Aguilera leads the
league in the least number of goals
allowed per game and is in the top
three for overall saves as well.
"We've played good defense all
year, especially with Chris in the
goal," Dettamanti said. "We've
been holding the other teams down
really well. [Aguilera's record] Ls
partly a reflection of him, but also of
our team defense."
Unfortunately, Stanford's of
fense hasn't been quite as solid. The
Cardinal has been unable to convert
many of its scoring opportunities,
which has resulted in the losses of
some crucial games. Most frustrating
of all is the fact that most of Stan
ford's losses have been by a one- or
two- goal margin.
"We're leading the league in de
fense but the problem is we need to
score more goals," Dettamanti said.
"The team that scores on the 6-on-5
and scores on the counterattack and
doesn't make simj j mistak. lat
allow easy goals is the team that's
going to win the game."
In spite of last weekend's loss to
USC, th ■ team is still optimistic
about its chances.
"We played well in our last game
against them," Joy said. "I really felt
like we had them, until that one
goal" which USC scored after inter
cepting a pass from a Stanford coun
terattack that could potentially have
tied the game up in the last quarter.
After having made a strong
showing in its first match against the
Trojans, Joy feels that the team will
"have a lot confidence coming into
the next game".
The match will be held tomorrow
at noon at deGuerre pool.
