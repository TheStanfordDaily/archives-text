UCSF-Stanford Health Care an
nounced this week that during its first
year as a merged organization it in
creased patient care by 6 percent and
is projected to meet its first-year tar
get of a $20-million operating return
on revenue of $1.5 billion.
"The merger has made us
stronger and allowed us to focus on

what we do best, translating cutting
edge research into improvements in
patient care," said Peter Van Ettcn.
president of IJCSF-Stanford Health
Care.
"At the one-year mark, we have
made significant progress in integrat
ing our operations and have built an
infrastructure that is allowing physi
cians to collaborate on improving
clinical services."
The IJC-San Francisco and Stan

ford medical centers merged a year
ago in the hopes of ensuring financial
stability for the two centers, as well as
creating economies of scale.
The merger faced opposition
from unions representing IK SI
workers. I Inions feared that merging
with heavily non-union Stanford
would hurt their job and wage securi
ty.
Janitors, maintenance workers,
food service employees and nursing
assistants at Stanford have been
working to organize since the merger
occurred. In two weeks, 1,500 work
ers will vote on whether to form a
union.
According to Daniel Berman,
news director for UCSF-Stanford
Health Care, the move to unionize
began before the merger.
"It's an evolutionary process,"
said Berman. "The focus is on how to

best integrate the facilities."
UCSF-Stanford Health Care op
erates four acute care hospitals:
UCSF Medical Center, UCSF/
Mount Zion Medical Center, Stan
ford Hospital and the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital at Stan
ford. The UCSF and Stanford med
ical schools have remained indepen
dent, but UCSF-Stanford does draw
on the clinical expertise of the
schools' faculties and provides sup
port to the schools.
An example of the success which
the merger has enjoyed is in cancer
care. A coordinated UCSF-Stanford
Clinical Cancer Program has en

abled collaboration between the 150
physicians that specialize in cancer
care at UCSF and Stanford.
Construction is underway for a
new state-of-the-art cancer treat
ment center at UCSF / Mount Zion,
and funds have been secured for a
multi-disciplinary Stanford facility.
In addition to improved health
care, the merger resulted in $38 mil
lion in savings.
"Considering the difficult health
care environment in which public
and private payers are feeling pres
sure to cut costs, we will need to con
tinue improving efficiency," said
Van Etten.
