## Volleyball aiming to sweep rival Cal 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
When one thinks of Stanford ver
sus California. images of a deep-root
ed rivalry and a history of hotly con
tested competitions come to mind.
For the No. 5 Stanford women's
volleyball team, however, playing
Cal doesn't carry quite the same
emotion.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 5 Stanford (20-2, 13-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) at Califor
nia (6-17. 2-11), 7:30 p.m. RADIO:
k/SU (90.1 FM).

The problem?
Well, a rivalry tends to lose its al
lure when one team almost always
wins and wins easily.
That has been exactly the case for
Stanford, which leads the all-time se
ries 41-3. The last Golden Bear victo
ry came in 1982.
Tonight's match at Cal figures to
be another episode of ( ardinal dom
ination. as Stanford (20-2 overall, 13-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) is riding a
19-mateh winning streak and quickly
assuming the form of a serious na
tional title contender.
( al on the other hand, has lost five
straight matches, and hasn't won a
game in its last three contests.
The Bears (6-17.2-11) will also be
without their primary offensive
weapon, junior outside hitter Brook
( oulter.whoislost for the remainder
of the season with a stress fracture in
her left tibia.
Sophomore middle blocker Kelly
Meyer is also suffering from a stress
fracture, hers in her left fibula, and
her status is day-to-day.
Despite these and other factors
that point toward a Stanford sweep
this evening, Stanford coach Don

Shaw will have his team prepared for
a tough match, as he always does.
"II we play well against Cal, we
shouldn't have trouble coming away
with a win," Shaw said last week be
fore his team left for the Washington
matches. "Hut you never know what
can happen in any Pac-10 match, es
pecially against a rival like Cal. So we
will be prepared and focused for the
match."
At Maples Pavilion in early Octo
ber. Stanford handed the Bears a
three-game sweep, 15-4,15-6,15-6.
Since that cold welcome to the
Farm, things have not gotten a whole
lot better for Cal, as the team is 3-10
under Maes.
In the October meeting, Stanford
was without junior outside hitters
Kerri Walsh and Jainii Gregory, both
sidelined with injuries. The two vet
eran leaders are now back and play
ing as strong as ever, anchoring a
young Cardinal squad that is matur
ing with each passing day.
The younger Stanford players,
who carried the team in the absence
of the two juniors, are emerging as re
liable performers. Freshman middle
blocker Sara Sandrik, last year's high
school player of the year, has put up
impressive numbers on both sides of
the net. She led all players with seven
blocks against Fresno State on Tues
day.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Detmer continues to be a domi
nant force at the net, leading the Car
dinal in blocking. She paced the team
with 12 kills against the Bulldogs.
Stanford holds a comfortable two
game lead in the Pac-10 with just five
conference matches remaining head
ing into tonight. With a win at Cal and
a pair of victories at home against the
()regon schools next weekend, Stan
ford would secure at least a tie lor its
tilth consecutive conference title.
