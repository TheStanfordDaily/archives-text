Members of the Black Student
Union and Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford will join

other local activists tomorrow to
protest the appeal denial of death
row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. The
protest will be held outside of the fed
eral building in San Francisco's Polk
Street and will be one of many sched

uled to occur around the country to
morrow.
Abu-Jamal. the black journalist
who was sentenced to death in IMS 2
tor killing a police officer, was denied
an appeal for a new trial by the Penn
sylvania Supreme ( 'ourt last week,
and the international community is in
an uproar.
The BSIJ is one of the first student
groups on campus to respond to the
decision and has started its campaign
to educate students about the case.
"We would like to see justice
brought to a fundamentally unjust
case." said junior Brian Rikuda. pres
ident of the BSI I.
Abu-Jamal was granted a stay of
execution in IWS, which, with the de
cision of Pcnnyslvania's Supreme
('ourt. has now expired. A death war
rant is expected to be signed soon by
(iov. I om Ridge, but ;i appeal to fed
eral court will likely be filed and an
other stay issued.
The BSD had an information ses
sion about the case at its meeting on
Monday, followed by a screening of
the documentary "Mumia Abu-
Jamal: A Case for Reasonable
Doubt." which was also screened on
campus by the Stanford Film Society
last December. Members wrote let
ters to Ridge while watching the
mo ie.
Ridge could conceivabK grant
Abu-Jamal another sta\ ol execution
or clemency. Ihe latter would lake
him off death row and possibly allow
for a new trial on the case.
Abu-Jamal. prior to the disputed
killing, worked as a journalist to ex
pose instances of police brutality and
