Members of the Black Student
Union and Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford will join

other local activists tomorrow to
protest the appeal denial of death
row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. The
protest will be held outside of the fed
eral building in San Francisco's Polk
Street and will be one of many sched

uled to occur around the country to
morrow.
Abu-Jamal. the black journalist
who was sentenced to death in IMS 2
tor killing a police officer, was denied
an appeal for a new trial by the Penn
sylvania Supreme ( 'ourt last week,
and the international community is in
an uproar.
The BSIJ is one of the first student
groups on campus to respond to the
decision and has started its campaign
to educate students about the case.
"We would like to see justice
brought to a fundamentally unjust
case." said junior Brian Rikuda. pres
ident of the BSI I.
Abu-Jamal was granted a stay of
execution in IWS, which, with the de
cision of Pcnnyslvania's Supreme
('ourt. has now expired. A death war
rant is expected to be signed soon by
(iov. I om Ridge, but ;i appeal to fed
eral court will likely be filed and an
other stay issued.
The BSD had an information ses
sion about the case at its meeting on
Monday, followed by a screening of
the documentary "Mumia Abu-
Jamal: A Case for Reasonable
Doubt." which was also screened on
campus by the Stanford Film Society
last December. Members wrote let
ters to Ridge while watching the
mo ie.
Ridge could conceivabK grant
Abu-Jamal another sta\ ol execution
or clemency. Ihe latter would lake
him off death row and possibly allow
for a new trial on the case.
Abu-Jamal. prior to the disputed
killing, worked as a journalist to ex
pose instances of police brutality and

prosecutorial misconduct in
Philadelphia. He and thousands of
supporters allege that his initial trial
in 1982 was racially biased, Iraught
with political innuendoes and other
wise unjust.
For example, supporters allege
that the presiding judge in the case
was strongly pro-prosecution, disal
lowing subpoenas of crucial evi
dence. Evidence of witness coercion
by police has also surfaced, while
eyewitness testimony exonerating
Abu-Jamal was discounted during
his trial.
"We feel that this is very political
ly motivated, that he is a political
prisoner," said sophomore Mariama
White-Hammond, co-chair of the
BSU task force that organizes the
group's political actions. "I hope the
case will bring up for many people a
re-examination of the death penalty
as a form of punishment, as well as
the prison system."
Support for Abu-Jamal's cause
has come strongly from the interna
tional community. Well-known sup
porters include Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
African-American activist Angela
Davis and Danish Supreme Court
Justice Per Walsoe. South African

President Nelson Mandela, the Eu
ropean Parliament and Amnesty In
ternational have also shown their
support.
Despite a huge backing for Abu-
Jamal in the international commu
nity, White-Hammond said student
reaction has not been strong
enough.
"There hasn't been enough re
sponse from the black community."
she said. "A lot of people just don't
know enough about the case."
SEAS coordinator Tim Donaghy
said that the case "all too clearly ex
poses the racist power structures in
the country and the clear harm that
is being done by executing this
man."
Although SEAS is not planning
its own campaign regarding the case,
some of its members are planning to
attend tomorrow's protest.
The governor is required by
Pennsylvania law to sign a death war
rant within 30 days, setting an execu
tion date within 6() days.
"We're afraid that this is going to
happen really soon," said Stanford's
Amnesty International President
Parveen Parmar.
Amnesty International is focus
ing its work this quarter on human
rights violations in the United States.
This issue is part of its overall cam
paign against the death penalty and
prison violence. The group is also
continuing its letter-writing efforts.
