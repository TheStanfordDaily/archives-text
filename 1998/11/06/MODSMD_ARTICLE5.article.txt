## Stanford ranked eighth 
### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
Stanford ranked eighth in the nation's colleges in
the amount spent on lobbying to federal, state and
local governments as reported to the Internal Rev
enue Service for the 1997 fiscal year.
Stanford spent in excess of $330,000 for lobbying
efforts that year, according to an article published in
the <)ct. 23 edition of Ihe Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation. Boston 1 1 ni versity topped the list by spending
more than $800,000.
In addition to the statement to the IRS. nonprofit
organizations have been required to submit their
total spending on lobbying under the Lobbying Dis
closure Act. which only accounts for federal lobby
ing. In this report, Stanford approximated that
$240,000 was spent.
Stanford's disclosure report indicated six cate
gories of lobbying to the federal government, related
to topics ranging from energy and water appropria
tions to biomedical research funding.
Larry Morton, director of government and com
munity relations, stated that "most of Stanford's lob
bying involves student aid or matters related to re
search."
When asked why Stanford ranked so highly in
lobbying costs last year. Morton explained that the
forms are "so complex, and you can till them out very
differently. Some universities that have Washington
offices didn't file reports."
In fact, only 75 of the 475 colleges that the Chron
icle questioned admitted to any spending on lobby
ing. since technicalities often allow for underreport
ing.

Horton maintained that Stanford did not choose
the underreporting route. "We are very conserva
tive," he said. "We err on the side of overreporting."
Horton explained that university lobbying occurs
any time school officials communicate with congres
sional members or their staff about funding.
"If you go and say federal support for education is
good, that's lobbying." Horton said. "These defini
tions lire set out by law." 1
Besides the federal lobbying associated with the
Lobbying Disclosure Act. the University spent
money on state and local lobbying, which accounts
for the extra amount submitted to the IRS.
Morton said that Stanford's local spending was
