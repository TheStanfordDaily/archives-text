# Meteorite lands in Branner
## NASA researcher Carl Allen speaks on Martian rock 
### Anthony Chiu 
Carl Allen, the principal scien
tist for NASA's Mars Research
Program, addressed a group of
about <S() students last night in the
lounge of Branner Mali with a me
teorite from Mars in tow.
"I think that within our life
times. we will know that we are no
longer alone," Allen proposed yes
terday in his presentation. "The
Search for I ife on Mars."
Allen displayed an actual mete
orite fragment from Mars that had
come from a larger sample discov
ered in Antarctica.
I hat sample was one ol 12 mete
orites found in 19% that were com
pletely different from the majority
of meteorites in that they were
both young and volcanic in origin.
"No one will ever get this close
to the meteorites, except for the

NASA folks that work with them."
said freshman Sam Abrams. who
worked with Allen in I louston and
invited him to speak at his resi
dence.
After the discovery of the mete
orites. the NASA team heated
them and examined the gases that
were produced. They found that
the resulting mixture of gases pre
cisely matched the atmosphere of
Mars.
Next, the team consulted Stan
ford Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare.
who used lasers and a mass spec
trometer to analyze the organic
compounds in the rock. The discov
ery of minerals in the rock that were
produced by bacteria — in addition
to scanning electron microscope
images of the rock — pointed to the
possibility of bacterial life on Mars.
Complete confirmation of this
work will probably come when ac

tual samples from Mars are sched
uled to return in 2008.
Unlike the previous samples,
these will be more helpful because
they will be uncontaminated and
taken from a site whose features
NASA has studied.
Until then, scientists investigat
ing the samples have several tasks,
which, according to Allen, include
addressing "the ethics of bringing
back samples from other planets
where life exists into the terrestrial
biosphere."
After a slide presentation that
detailed the research process, the
audience engaged Allen with ques
tions and comments.
"It was very fascinating because
of the extraordinary possibilities
... especially since space is an area
in which we have limited knowl
edge," said senior Patrick
Domingucz.
