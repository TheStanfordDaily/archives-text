# Interview:
## Gould shares thoughts on science 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Many children grow up with a
keen interest in fossils and di
nosaurs, but few, like evolutionary
biologist Stephen Jay Ciould, make
it to the ranks of a world-famous
paleontologist.
"I was fascinated bv dinosaurs
as a kid even at the age of five or
six. I went to museums," Ciould
said.
That childhood interest in fossils
has lead to a multidimensional ca
reer for Gould, who has written al
most 20 books and teaches at Har
vard University where he is the
Alexander Agassi/ Professor of
Zoology and Professor of Geology.
"I'm internally motivated. [My
work | is not an issue of social pur

pose," he* said. "It may sound indul
gent, hut (there's a need] to do
within — there's a fire inside that
keeps burning in creative people.
"Most people go into academic
life for a whole set of reasons; they
are often motivated by fairly ideal
istic beliefs — and I mean that in
the best way."
Gould's work extends beyond
the bounds of academic writing
into social commentary.
In 1994, Ciould wrote a critical
review in The New Yorker of " The
Hell Curve," a book by Charles
Murray and Richard Herrnstein.
(iould attacked each of the book's
premises, decrying the use of "bio
logical determinism as social phi
losophy."
Ciould objects to the use of bio
logical determinism as a social phi-

losophy, not out of a distrust of de
terministic theories in general, but
because determinism is inappropri
ate when applied to the issue of
human intelligence.
"1 don't distrust deterministic
theories. I have no problem with
celestial mechanics, but that ap
proach to human intelligence is
wrong for a whole set of reasons."
Gould also rejected the idea that
understanding evolution at the
micro-level discounts a broader un
derstanding of evolutionary
processes.
There's no trade-off between
the two levels of understanding, he
said.
Commenting on the stereotype
of the sciences as a source of an
alytically rigorous predictive tools,
Gould maintained the convention

of valuing prediction over explana
tion has its roots in history.
Initial discoveries in physics and
astronomy by Sir Issac Newton
proved highly successful, and from
these early successes grew an in
creasing fixation on prediction and
predictive tools, Gould suggested.
"Laplace, the great determinist
said of [math and science], these
are easy subjects — human behav
ior, now that's difficult," Gould
said.
Gould's resume includes a now
famous guest-appearance on "The
Simpsons."
Gould agreed to work on the
episode because the script was "in
teresting," and it only took 10 min
utes, he said.
"I didn't see it initially until the
day it was shown," he said.
