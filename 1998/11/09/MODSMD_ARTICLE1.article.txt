The fate of Russia and the United
States may largely depend on how
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
deals with reviving his nation's econ
omy to maintain the unity of the
state, according to U.S. Deputy Sec
retary of State Strobe Talbott.
Talbott delivered a lecture titled
"Russia in the Global Order" on Fri
day. as the keynote speaker for a
three-day conference focusing on
Russian culture and politics at the
end of the 2()th century.
"The violent breakup of Russia
wouldbe immensely dangerous,"
Talbott said. "The horror that has un
folded over the past several years in
the Balkans may be replayed across
11 time zones, with 3().(HK) nuclear
weapons in the mix."
The United States has been com
mitted to helping Russia become a
democratic state in order to guaran
tee long-term U.S. security interests,
according to Talbott.
As Russia works its way out of the
current economic crisis, its "choices
will have a lot to do with what kind of
world we Americans live in. how safe
we are and how much we have to
spend on our safety," Talbott said.
Criticism of Russian policy
Talbott heavily criticized what he
called the "Russian way" of recent
economic policy.
"Primakov's team is operating
with neither a realistic budget nor a

reliable and sensitive means of col
lecting taxes," he said.
The International Monetary
Fund has already shown its disap
proval with Russia's economic plan.
It has refused to give the $4.3 billion
in aid it had promised in June, be
cause it sees Russia as shifting away
from a free market economy.
"It has become all but impossible
for the IMF to help arrest and reverse
the slide," Talbott said. "Money from
outside is no good if it pauses only
briefly in Russia on its way to Swiss
bank accounts and Riviera real es
tate."
Without IMF financing, the Russ
ian government is left with unattrac
tive choices, one of which is to print
more rubles to meet payrolls and to
keep bankrupt enterprises afloat.
Whatever the government choos
es, Russia's economic situation is
likely to deteriorate, and "economic
decline carries with it the danger...
or the possibility of political drift, tur
moil, or even crack-up," Talbott said.
"The point here is that the eco
nomic rules that the custodians of the
Russian economy seem bent on defy
ing are not so much Western rules as
they are a matter of simple arith
metic," Talbott added. "Since the
numbers don't add up, intended
remedies only aggravate the dis
ease."
