## 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Beginning Jan. 1, the Rev. Dr.
Kelly Borhaug-Denton, an or
dained Lutheran minister since
1989 and an associate dean for reli
gious life for the past two years, will
become acting dean of religious
life. She will fill the position while a
committee searches for a perma
nent dean.
The need for a replacement
arose due to the fact that Robert
Gregg, current dean of religious
life, will leave his position at the
end of this year to resume his full
time academic post teaching in the
Department of Religious Studies.
According to Denton-Borhaug,
"The most important part of the
role is to provide for continuity,
strength and support of religious
life at Stanford during this interim
period of the search for a new
dean."
Denton-Borhaug has had many
past experiences she will be able to
draw from to help her in this role,
including serving as pastor in two
Lutheran congregations in San
Francisco from 1988-1996.

"In both parishes, I worked with
religious and non-religious peo
ple," she said. "I baptized, married
and buried parishioners and non
parishioners, did community orga
nizing, supported interfaith activi
ties, developed programs for un
derprivileged neighborhood chil
dren, facilitated women's groups,
encouraged relationship-building
with Lutheran parishes in El Sal
vador. addressed bias against gay
and lesbian people in my own
church body and more."
Her other credentials include a
doctorate in theological ethics
from the Graduate Theological
Union in Berkeley and a Masters of
Divinity from Pacific Lutheran
Theological Seminary in Berkeley.
Denton-Borhaug acknowledges
that her colleagues will also be in
strumental in her efforts to contin
ue giving the same guidance to
Stanford's religious community
that she has over the past years.
"During the interim, I and my
three colleagues, Rev. Maurice
Charles, Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann and Imam Ebrahim
Moosa will continue in the initia
tives and tasks which characterize

our roles here on campus: encour
aging students, staff and faculty in a
multitude of religious and spiritual
matters," she said.
In addition to their involvement
in religious activities, Denton-
Borhaug explained that the group
has been active in many other as
pects of student life. The team's ef
forts have ranged from participat
ing in race dialogues and other
Residential Education programs to
chairing the committee to name a
new director of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
and serving as sexual harassment
advisors.
Jacqueline Wender, assistant to
the president, said that Denton-
Borhaug's experiences and creden
tials makes her an excellent choice
for the position of acting dean.
"We're very pleased with Rev.
Kelly Denton-Borhaug," she said.
"Her strength in this position
means that the committee will be
able to carry out a search until the
best replacement is found."
The committee, which is co
chaired by Provost Condoleezza
Rice and Political Science Prof. Lu
cius Barker, has alreadv initiated

its national search for a replace
ment for Robert Gregg, the current
dean for religious life.
Gregg said he is confident the
committee, composed of students
nominated through the ASSIJ, fac
ulty recommended by the Faculty
Senate Committee on Committees
and others suggested by the dean of
religious life, will succeed in find
ing a worthy replacement. The
committee also includes students
who are active in their respective
religious communities.
"In my opinion, the committee
members are excellent in that they
have both knowledge of religious
life and institutions and also under
stand universities and their partic
ular character," he said.
"One thing that is heartening
about the search is the enthusiasm
by every member of the committee
for their work," Wender said.
According to Wender, Denton-
Borhaug will assume the duties as
dean for "as long as it takes" to find
a suitable replacement for Gregg.
Denton-Borhaug plans to honor
Ciregg in January for "everything
that [he] accomplished during his
tenure."
