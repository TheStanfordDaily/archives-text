# Former Italiana manager's trial delayed
## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
The trial of former Casa Italiana
financial manager Jeremy Smith
was postponed again Friday morn
ing and will begin on Jan. 14.
Smith appeared before a prose
cutor and judge in Palo Alto Supe
rior Criminal Court for the third
time to assess the charges pressed
against him and to schedule a date
for a pretrial hearing.
Smith is facing felony embezzle
ment charges for allegedly usurp
ing $2(),()(M) to $23,(K)() in house

funds. The trial, already delayed
once because the investigating offi
cer was on vacation, had been
scheduled to begin on Friday.
Due to unspecified confusion on
the part of the prosecutor, the trial
could not go forward. Instead, the
judge was forced to move the first
significant all-day pretrial hearing
to Jan. 14 at 8:30 a.m.
The judge had wanted to start
the trial earlier, but could not be
cause Smith said that he would be
out of town during winter recess.
Smith no longer attends Stanford;
he has transferred to another insti

tution.
Most of the action took place in
a sidebar called by the prosecutor
as she attempted to explain and
take responsibility for the schedul
ing confusion.
Because Smith's lawyers were
not present, court-appointed pub
lic defender John Bridenthal spoke
on behalf of Smith during the side
bar.
The prosecutor, judge and
Bridenthal discussed the possibili
ty of lowering the charges levied
against Smith to misdemeanors.
The prosecutor took serious

issue with this proposition, com
plaining, "It's just because he was a
Stanford student. They always get
preference. II he went to San Jose
State, this wouldn't even be an
issue."
The consensus of the sidebar
was that the charges were highly
unlikely to be lessened, as the
amount of money involved is sig
nificant and the alleged crime was
not an isolated incident, but oc
curred over a long period of time.
Smith appeared unfazed in the
hearing. He answered the judge's
questions quietly and calmly.
