WASHINGTON (AP) —The Republican leader
ship battle took to the airwaves Sunday as candidates to
replace departing House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
his lieutenants sought support from colleagues who
want the GOP to show a friendlier, more effective face.
Momentarily interrupting their fevered phone cam
paigning lor a parade through the Sunday talk shows,
the GOP contenders differed less on policy issues than
011 whether to work with Democrats next year in a nar
rowly divided House. A common campaign platform
seemed to be. "I'm not Newt."
Rep. Bob Livingston. R-La.. hoping to succeed (iin
grich. spoke of working with Democrats to produce leg
islation on which a broad majority can agree.
"I intend to reach out and bring anybody who wants
to together to formulate the legislation that we need."
Livingston said on ABC's "This Week with Sam Don
aldson and Cokie Roberts."
His only opponent thus far, Rep. Christopher Cox.
R-Calif.. proposed a cooperative agreement with the
Republican Senate — something seldom seen under

Gingrich — and promised to keep social policy issue*,
out of basic spending hills, a legislative tactic that often
tied the House in knots.
"This is not just about who is going to be the next
speaker of the House, it's about the direction of the
country," ( ox said on ( BS's "Face the Nation."
A third House Republican who was weighing a run
for speaker. Rep. James Talent, of Missouri, withdrew
his name and threw his support to Livingston.
Two additional potential candidates for a House
Republican leadership position may also make a move.
Rep. Jennifer Dunn. R-Wa.. is giving renewed con
sideration to challenging Rep. Dick Armey. R Texas,
the House majority leader. Dunn's announcement
could come as early as Monday, said GOP sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Rep. Dennis Hastert was also considering entering
the fray, according to a source close to the Illinois
Republican. That would make it a four-way race for the
No. 2 House post; Rep. Steve Largent. R-Okla.. has
already declared his interest.
