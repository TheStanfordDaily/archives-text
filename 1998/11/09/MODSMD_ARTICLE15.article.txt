## 
### 
BONN, Germany (AP) Sixty years
ago, Nazi thugs set lire to hundreds of syn
agogues, looted thousands of lewish luisi
nesses and attacked Jews in Germany and
Austria in a night of terror that presaged
the I lolocaust.
Germany's remembrance of the Nov. 9,
1938, rampage the "Night of Broken
Glass" or "Kristallnacht" comes amid
fresh debate on the nation's relationship
with its past triggered by the government's
return to Berlin, the prewar capital where
Adolf 1 filler ruled.
Already, the leadei of (icrmany's Jew
ish community has bitterly voiced concern
about a new "intellectual nationalism."
But a newly elected, younger govern
ment due to move to the city next year is
trying to lighten the burden of association
that Berlin still carries.
Gerhard Schroeder, the first chancellor
with no personal memory ol World War 11.
embodies the shift in attitudes toward the
Na/i legacy by a generation that wants

(iermanv to be seen as a normal country.
Schroeder stressed that point in a recent
I V interview when the host noted that
some of the Berlin government buildings
had been used by the Nazis.
"One must know that we have to stand
for 'never again.' But it would be com
pletely wrong to allow yourself be so bur
dened as to make it impossible to bring a
new spirit to those hallways." he said.
"Mv way of making politics, of dealing
with people, doesn't change when I enter
some strange building."
In a statement Sunday marking the
anniversary. Schroeder said Nov. 9 would
remain linked to unprecedented crimes
and immense suffering. But "sixty years
later we look forward, without forgetting
the past." he said.
President Roman llerzog. Germany's
head ot state, will share Monday's main
remembrance ceremony in Berlin with
Ignatz Bubis. the head of Germany's Jew
ish community.

Some of the nation's 70.000 Jews will
commemorate Kristallnacht with street
marches for the first time, a sign of leaders'
concern that less visible forms of remem
brance are ineffective. The main proces
sion is through central Berlin.
In Dresden, the city's small Jewish com
munity will break ground Monday for a
new synagogue to replace the one burned
by the Nazis.
Several other big-city synagogues are
being rebuilt only as computer models for
now. Students in Darmstadt have been
working on the project since summer,
recreating the buildings from blueprints,
photos and descriptions by survivors.
Intended as a gesture against rising
extreme-right violence in Germany, the
reconstructions are being posted on the
Internet.
Bubis recently said he is so upset with
the national mood that he was considering
stepping down as leader of the Jewish com
munity.
