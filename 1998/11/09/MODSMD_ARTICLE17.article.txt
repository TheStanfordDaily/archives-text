Password heist reminds us
to take necessary security
steps when using network

IN I HIS MODERN world, Internet
technologies like e-mail and the World
Wide Web have certainly enhanced
daily life, simplifying and speeding written
communication while delivering vast
amounts ol interconnected information to
the desktop. But a cautious optimism is still
a virtue in the electronic age.
Two weeks ago, 4.500 account pass
words were potentially compromised by a
serious breach of security in the I.eland
computer system.
(bmmendably. the break-in elicited a
quick response from the Stanford I Iniversi
tv Network Security learn, which alerted
at-risk users to immediately change their
passwords.
When such a dangerous incident occurs,
we are forced to reflect on our digital
dependency. We must think about how we
can become more aware of computer secu
rity issues and then take the appropriate
measures to ensure immunity from prying
eyes,
I he University is taking a few extra pre
cautions. Computer security officer Steve
Hanson cites the automatic password
strength checking that has been in use for
over a year. 1 his program ensures that
I.eland account passwords are not easy to
guess.
Additionally, the Stanford University
Network Security I'eam monitors outside
Internet users who seem suspicious or who
might be scanning for weak points in the
network. In case of any system problems
from hackers or otherwise, "Everything
stored on the Sweet Hall servers is backed
up each night and then stored for a year,"

says Hanson. These backups include any e
mail or personal files that are kept on the
server.
Most importantly, the University has
made password encryption software avail
able to all users of the Leland system. When
using an e-mail client without the Leland
security software, the password is sent in
plain text format over the network. With
Mac- or PC-Leland, passwords and e-mail
are made secure using Kerberos encryption
before being sent over the network by
Hudora or MaeSampson.
Such security, however, is only in effect
when students actually use the software
when logging in. It is critical that users
install and consistently use the encrytion
software.
The I Jniversity is also talking with third
party developers such as Netscape in hopes
that their programs can be used more
securely over the network. Such work to
add security features to commonly-used
applications like Netscape's Communicator
package deserves high priority since so
many students, faculty and staff use them
frequently.
According to I lanson, "The biggest hole
is file transfer protocol because we current
ly do not have a secure client or server."
Although FI P use may not be widespread,
it is still important for users to be aware that
information sent over FIT is not currently
secure.
I lanson noted that the network will soon
be "upgraded to a new version of Kerberos,
which should add further security features
and provide some type of secure FIT." Any
type of upgrade to prevent future security
breaches or password theft is a welcome
measure.
With the great dependence on e-mail for
both academic work and extracurricular
correspondence, all students should use
Mac- or PC-Leland and remember to
change their passwords periodically.
