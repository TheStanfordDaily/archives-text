## Meeting our campus celebrities 
### 
THE GREAT thing
about being a senior
is that you finally
start getting to know all
those "campus figures"
who stand out in crowds in
White Plaza, the lines at
the bookstore and the

computer cluster at Meyer.
I want to be careful with my language. I
don't want to connote freaks or weirdoes,
but just people who seem to draw attention.
They're striking. They look interesting, like
they have stories. And they do, but you
don't know it. So you make them up.
You don't know their names, so you
christen them.
It began with "short guy," a blond guy
who bought his tie dye T -shirts in bulk. Then
there was "angst chick." "Braid girl."
"Vegan action boy." "Santa Glaus." The
girls who created their outfits with a Good
will bin and a couple of staple guns. "Pat."
"Pink hair." The mean guy at the post office.
The blonde in Talisman.
After naming them, I make up histories
and interests and speculate about their mar
ital status and political affiliation.
Let's take the "bearded, batik-wearing
guy" dancing at co-op parties. I profiled him
as a modern thought and literature grad stu
dent. Grateful Dead aficionado who was not
currently seeing anyone (1 don't think grad
students have time for that kind of stuff) but
was active in the Grassroots Party.
The "suit guy." I recently became aware
that this is a universal identifier for this man.
reaching beyond the bounds of my circle of
friends. I guessed he was a furniture-maker
from an Amish community. He was proba
bly married and talked politics from a
Socialist perspective.

The super-tall guy with the black Sixties
glasses who works at Terman library. I
thought he could be a lacrosse player who
lived in Lantana, had a long-term girlfriend
and voted strictly party-line Republican.
But maybe catching a glimpse of "beard
ed, batik-wearing guy" talking on a cell
phone tipped me off that all my hypothesiz
ing was a little off the mark.
These days, that bearded guy's my land
lord, "suit guy" is my editor and the guy with
the cool glasses is my housemate. My land
lord eonsults for the computer industry and
is good at hanging pinatas, "suit guy" is a
classics major who can read ancient Greek
and Latin, and my housemate went out for
Halloween as Snow White in a yellow
miniskirt. Never would've guessed.
So how about the people you don't end
up meeting through the natural course of
events, like "Org" and the outstandingly
attractive woman in upper-level CS classes?
How do you go from zero to friend in under
10 seconds? How are you going to discover
their unexpected secrets? Stop wondering
and start asking.
Now 1 know this is difficult, since you've
already had numerous eye-contact-averting
moments with these people and have long
since passed what I term the "critical win
dow" for social interaction. The critical win
dow is the time frame appropriate for intro
ducing yourself or starting conversation.
I first identified it while riding the city
bus. If you don't sit down and launch off a
"Nice weather we're having" or something,
you can't wait 40 blocks, turn to your seat
mate and then ask. "So, how about those
49ers?" Or, for example, if reuniting with a
long-lost friend from summer camp, you
can't wait until you finish reminiscing about
the gross bathrooms, sneaking out at night
and gossiping about your favorite counselor

to ask, "What's your name again?"
So although the critical window blew by
two months ago, you can still combat social
awkwardness and introduce yourself.
I've tried it a couple times, and it's
worked out okay. There was one guy who
had been in one of my classes, but differen
tial equations had never given us cause for
introduction. Four I-sort-of-know-you-but
not-really-so-I'm-not-saying-hi encounters
later, I came across him working in the
machine shop. I sucked it up and introduced
myself, saying something sort of dumb like,
"Hey, I've seen you around a lot, but 1 don't
know who you are or what your deal is." I
think I just wanted to meet him because he
was working on an "insulatory beverage
cooler." a.k.a. a keg refrigerator to replace
garbage cans and ice.
And then there was the guy who I saw
around so much that his dark hair and white
V-neck T-shirts were permanently imprint
ed on my retina. Finally, 1 just stopped my
bike and accosted him, saying, "Hi, I'm
Rachel and I'm introducing myself because 1
see you everywhere, and I thought I'd ask
your name so next time I can say 'hi' instead
of a weird half-smile and dodgy eye-con
tact."
One more thought on all this: If you have
your collection of mystery people, there's a
good chance you're in someone else's col
lection. Are you the monopolizer in hum bio
section or the girl who looks like my cousin
from St. Louis?
I think I'd better go take a shower, put in
my contacts and take off this ridiculous
marshmallow hat before I become "spastic
glasses girl."

design, wants to know if she's "spastic glasses
