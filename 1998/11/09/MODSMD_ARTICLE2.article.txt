# Administrators confirm:
## Alcohol law will have little impact 
### Julie Chai 
In discussions with resident fel
lows and resident assistants last
week. Stanford officials confirmed
that new national legislation will
not have a major effect on Stan
ford's alcohol policies.
Officials held the meetings with
RFs and RAs to solicit any con
cerns about alcohol use and abuse
at Stanford. The discussions were
spurred in part by the Collegiate
Initiative to Reduce Hinge Drink
ing. which recently became law.
The initiative recommends sev
eral projects to institutions of high
er education to deal with alcohol is
sues. These include creating a task
force to examine policies and pro
grams dealing with alcohol and
drug-related problems and provid
ing students with the option to live
in alcohol-free environments and
engage in alcohol-free activities.
Colleges and universities are
also advised to enforce a "zero tol
erance" policy on illegal alcohol
consumption and discipline those
who break the rules.
"The idea that the vice provost
[of student affairs, James Montoya]
and others have is to look at the is
sues so that thev can tweak and

make incremental changes to the
system â€” nothing radical," said
Marc Wais, dean of students.
"We're holding these discus
sions to get a sense of what the is
sues are," said Montoya. "We want
to give the RAs and RFs the oppor
tunity to talk about what the legis
lation means and offer suggestions
as to what we can do better.
"We're in the process of fine
tuning our alcohol-related policies
and practices," said Montoya. "It
seems to be an appropriate time to
do it (given)... recent incidents on
campus and across the nation."
Last month, a Stanford student
fell from a balcony in an alcohol-re
lated accident and required inten
sive care for a week. This, along
with alcohol-related deaths at the
University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor and Rutgers University last
month, has made campus alcohol
policies a national issue.
Some RAs and RFs expressed
concern that policy changes at
Stanford might make them respon
sible for enforcement of campus al
cohol rules that are currently han
dled by Stanford Police, but cam
pus officials stated that this is not
something that is being considered.
