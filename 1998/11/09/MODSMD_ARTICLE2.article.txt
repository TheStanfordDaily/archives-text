# Administrators confirm:
## Alcohol law will have little impact 
### Julie Chai 
In discussions with resident fel
lows and resident assistants last
week. Stanford officials confirmed
that new national legislation will
not have a major effect on Stan
ford's alcohol policies.
Officials held the meetings with
RFs and RAs to solicit any con
cerns about alcohol use and abuse
at Stanford. The discussions were
spurred in part by the Collegiate
Initiative to Reduce Hinge Drink
ing. which recently became law.
The initiative recommends sev
eral projects to institutions of high
er education to deal with alcohol is
sues. These include creating a task
force to examine policies and pro
grams dealing with alcohol and
drug-related problems and provid
ing students with the option to live
in alcohol-free environments and
engage in alcohol-free activities.
Colleges and universities are
also advised to enforce a "zero tol
erance" policy on illegal alcohol
consumption and discipline those
who break the rules.
"The idea that the vice provost
[of student affairs, James Montoya]
and others have is to look at the is
sues so that thev can tweak and

make incremental changes to the
system — nothing radical," said
Marc Wais, dean of students.
"We're holding these discus
sions to get a sense of what the is
sues are," said Montoya. "We want
to give the RAs and RFs the oppor
tunity to talk about what the legis
lation means and offer suggestions
as to what we can do better.
"We're in the process of fine
tuning our alcohol-related policies
and practices," said Montoya. "It
seems to be an appropriate time to
do it (given)... recent incidents on
campus and across the nation."
Last month, a Stanford student
fell from a balcony in an alcohol-re
lated accident and required inten
sive care for a week. This, along
with alcohol-related deaths at the
University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor and Rutgers University last
month, has made campus alcohol
policies a national issue.
Some RAs and RFs expressed
concern that policy changes at
Stanford might make them respon
sible for enforcement of campus al
cohol rules that are currently han
dled by Stanford Police, but cam
pus officials stated that this is not
something that is being considered.
The discussions also concentrat
ed on the roles of the R As and RFs,
as well as the importance of their
relationships with students.
"It's important that students
don't see us as enforcers so that
they feel comfortable coming to
us," said Steve Stedman, an RF in
Larkin. "If students view us as en
forcers, there will be no trust, no
confidence and no basis for RAs
and RFs to be mentors. The rela
tionship with students would be
come antagonistic and adversari
al."
"An RA wants to be someone
students can come to with prob
lems, like a friend who knows
where the resources are and has ad
vice," said senior Kyle Weaver, an

RAin Griffin. "The best RAs keep
things on an informal level with stu
dents. This is the best way to keep
in touch, to take the pulse of the
community."
In regard to concerns that Stan
ford may become a dry campus,
Wais commented. "I haven't heard
any conversation in which the uni
versity is considering going dry."
A large part of the discussions
focused on the distinction between
alcohol use and alcohol abuse.
"Basically, we're fact-finding
about student alcohol use and how
we can better help students who
may have problems with alcohol,
who are developing problematic
drinking behavior or who already
have problematic drinking behav
ior." said Troy Gilbert, assistant to
the vice provost of student affairs.
According to Gilbert, figures
show that Stanford students drink

less than those at other institutions.
"From what 1 understand, the
consensus is that the overwhelming
majority of Stanford students who
drink do so responsibly," added
Wais. "The discussions are focusing
on students who put themselves at
risk and adversely affect the com
munities in which they live."
"The big picture is that Stanford
is interested in helping educate
people about alcohol," said Eddie
Atwood,an RF in Lantana. "I think
it's a deep concern for students."
Montoya plans to hold similar
discussions with students leaders
and other selected groups of stu
dents this week.
"To be effective as the vice
provost of student affairs, it's im
portant to me to talk — and more
importantly, to listen — to students
about these important issues," said
Montoya.
