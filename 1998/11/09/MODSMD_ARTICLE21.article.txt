Ashamed of Stan ford fans
lo the Stanford fans and band, I am so
disappointed in you. I was at the
UCLA / Stanford game Oct. 31, and your
behavior was shameful.
1 spent my first years of life at Stanford
Village when my father was working on a
master's in education and mv mother was a
nurse at your hospital. My brother went to
your school on a track scholarship, and I
was always proud to wear your Stanford
sweatshirt and my children, your Stanford
caps. I was born on Big Game day. You are
deeply woven into my psyche.
1 settled in Los Angeles after attending
I 'CI A. another wonderful school. I am not
a fanatic about school loyalty, but I always
secretly rooted for Stanford.
That Saturday, my children, husband
and I went to your game. We were excited
to get close to the field and talk with and
encourage your team as well as the UCLA
boys. Spirit, fun and competition were in
our hearts.
Then your fans yelled in our faces,
"UCLA sucks." My children and husband
had UCLA shirts on. lin front of us. one of

your students started a fight with a UCLA
elderly man. Your band gave the finger in
time to the UCLA fight song. As we were
leaving the game, an unruly Stanford stu
dent lunged at my nine-year-old son.
You were ugly, vicious and an embar
rassment to your beautiful school.
I won't be wearing my Stanford sweat
shirt with the same pride, and that's sad. My
son won't aspire with the same vigor to
attend your school and that's sad. It was an
afternoon of many ugly displays of poor
sportsmanship and low-class behavior. You
should be ashamed of yourselves.

No ambiguity with rape
I doubt I am the only person disturbed
by the bizarre chain of reasoning in I lias
Chrissochoidis' Nov. 4 letter. "Avoid rape
hysteria." Chrissochoidis seems profoundly
confused about the relationship between
friction, violence and sexual excitement.
According to Chrissochoidis, because
sex involves body friction, "sex is violent."

He asserts: "That's why it's exciting, and
that's why people like it."
First, the definite equation of body fric
tion with violence is a tenuous one. The
author might benefit from a massage while
he considers this.
Second, even if friction does render sex
"violent," it does not necessarily follow that
violence is what makes sex exciting.
Finally, let us contend with the proposed
theory that, because sex is "violent," (and
that this is what makes it exciting), "this
complicates sexual assault and blurs bound
aries between proper and improper behav
ior." Even if we indulge the author and
regard sex as violent escapism, there are no
blurred boundaries regarding the propriety
of any sexual behavior. If either party is
unconsenting, continued action qualifies as
improper behavior. It's that simple.
Most importantly, sexual assault is not
"complicated," even if we believe that sex
involves violence, because sex crimes are
not about a need for sex. They are about a
need to exercise power and control.
Should Chrissochoidis ever be forcibly
relieved of his underwear. I hope he is one
of the few who relishes the friction
involved.

State schools gat a bad rap
We is mad. Brittney Jensen use too
many big word/ in collum. That make head
hurt. We from state skools, and not smart
like Brittney say Stanford students be. We
"rage out of control" for four years and now
most our brain cells dead. Poor cells.
Jensen's Nov. 4 column is imbued with
that brand of Stanford arrogance that char
acterizes many opinions in the Daily and
the attitudes we encounter on campus.
After reading her contribution, one would
think, "Is there another decent school any
where on the planet?" Nope. Stanford is it,
a shining academic beacon, a unique refuge
for the intelligent and intellectual.
Quite a few items in Jensen's column
merit our taking offense, but we find the
implication that "really smart" people are
nowhere to be found on the campuses of
this nation's public institutions the most
egregious. We all attended public universi
ties for our undergraduate work, where the

academic climate didn't permit us to
"party" for four years. IJp against bright
students in competitive atmospheres, we
were denied the privilege of grade inflation.
We know how wonderful it is to graduate
from elite undergraduate engineering pro
grams without incurring tens of thousands
of dollars of debt. (Not everyone can afford
Stanford's lofty price tag.) We still had
social lives, and the Greek system had noth
ing to do with them.
We have met very few (if any) under
graduates here who enjoy playing with
physics equations on dry-erase boards.
Most graduate students, on the other hand,
are entrusted to discharge the duties that
garner Stanford academic departments the
top rankings they deserve. So let us and the
faculty do the work that gives Stanford its
reputation. Ms. Jensen, while you prepare
yourself for the big bad world of manage
ment consulting or investment banking.
