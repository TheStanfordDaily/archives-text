# Where We Are
## The 						hazy line between us and the real world 
### 
David Stein

OUR MOST FAVORITE Stanford
pastime, aside from purchasing
futons, is to refer to the land
beyond Palm Drive as the "real world." Not
a day goes by without someone lamenting
over our quaint, isolated university and
praising the rigors and supposed purity of
the "real life" outside academia.
Yet, what do we actually mean when we
say the "real world?" Are we suggesting
that we all lead unreal lives, that the pain
and pleasure we feel on the sports fields or
in our dorms are merely imaginary? Any
one who has pulled an all-nighter, experi
enced unrequited love, or eaten a bad meal
at Wilbur knows that campus phenomena,
while not always hugely significant, have
their own special place in reality.
Perhaps when we say "real," we really
mean "common." But while we like to think
of ourselves as wonderfully unique, there
are several institutions around the world
that boast such worthy attributes as intelli
gent people and beautiful surroundings.
Besides, describing ourselves as uncommon
and somehow superior to those who don't
take part in university life contradicts the

shame we feel when we admit that our days
are spent studying and playing rather than
in more obviously meaningful work.
Maybe we mean that life outside Stan
ford is just a lot more difficult. And. frankly,
it usually is. Here, we get to study whatever
we please, eat three square meals a day and
play innertube water polo while the hill is
footed by our parents or anonymous bene
factors. Our biggest concerns are classes
before nine a.m. in the morning, a scarcity
of gym space and an inefficient post office.
The University is the only place, as Prof.
David Kennedy said, that people, namely
professors, are paid to actually care about
what we say or write.
However, we also know that life here can
be quite challenging, that the work can
overwhelm us. And we also know that life
outside Stanford isn't all paying bills and
slaving over a hot stove; even those in the
"real world" have their share of fun — and
often quite a bit of it. too. The easy / difficult
divide doesn't seem to hold up.
Maybe we can safely say that the "real
world" is just something external to us.
However, there is a constant interchange

between the Academy and the "outsiders":
we lend them our discoveries, particularly in
the sciences and engineering, and they give
us fodder (i.e.. politics and literature) for
our studies. We move so often between the
Academy and the "real world" that the line
separating what is internal or external It)
our lives is blurred, if nonexistent.
What then separates us from the "real
world." assuming that there truly is a differ
ence, or at least a strongly perceived differ
ence. between the two? I would suggest that
this difference doesn't concern the difficulty
or isolation of our lives here, but rather the
nature of what we do at the University —
namely, study — and more specifically, the
course our studies are taking.
Right now is an exciting time in
academia. Barriers between disciplines are
falling away, subjects are examined from
multiple perspectives and natural phenome
na are no longer viewed as resulting from a
single factor. And as this critical multiplicity
continues, we come closer and closer to a
richer, truer picture of the world we live in.
But the search for truth has become
more daunting than ever. In the study of lit

erature, the aesthetic lies on its deathbed
while we attempt to reassemble the histori
cal and political environment of a particular
text and account for the infinite subjectivi
ties that contributed to its publication. In
the sciences, ideas of chaotic behavior are
upsetting all traditional notions of nature,
something as simple as the motion of a pen
dulum can no longer be taken for granted.
As the story goes, a butterfly flaps its wings
in China and we have a hurricane in Texas.
If, for example, we now want to discuss
why a child is aggressive, we can't just point
to the facile paradigm of "nature vs. nur
ture." Instead, we have to discuss genetics,
neurophysiology, biochemistry, endocrinol
ogy, social and class structures, psychology,
the role of the media, gender relations and
perhaps even religion and evolution. The
search for truth requires an understanding
of the infinite, which that remains unfath
omable to a single human mind.
And so life in the Academy is becoming
one of inadequate grasping. We might make
an important discovery, but it will only be
one of the million pieces of the puzzle; we
become one more footnote to the annals of

life. The big picture is composed of scores of
tiny little pictures. True, academia as a
whole will still provide us with the answers
to make our world more intelligible, but the
individual academic's life —as the
paradigm slips further away from a solid
concept of Truth with a capital "T" — slow
ly moves into inconsequentiality.
In the "real world," though, simplified
albeit incomplete — explanations of reality
remain. Children are aggressive because
they watch too much TV. Shakespeare's a
damn good writer and that's that. A hurri
cane happens because there's too much rain
and wind. And because life in the "real
world" is still viewed as "cause and effect,"
people's actions "out there" seem to have
more consequence. What they do, matters -
even if it really doesn't.
The great, comforting distinction
between black and white still functions out
side of academia, and that's why I'd argue
we'll never be part of the "real world."
After all, we exist in gray.
