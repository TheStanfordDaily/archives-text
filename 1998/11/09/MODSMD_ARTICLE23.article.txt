## Card returns as NorPac champs 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
It was a tale of two teams.
For the majority of the regular
season. Stanford's field hockey
team demolished its opponents, fre
quently holding them to fewer than
five shots while at the same time
pestering their goalies with constant
offensives.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ Sunday: Stanford defeated South
west Missouri State 3-2. for the Nor-
Pac C onfernce ("hampionship.

Riding on the waves of victories
Stanford traveled East to tackle
some of the top-ranked teams in the
country, including Boston College.
During the trip, the Cardinal lost
its steam and the explosiveness that
had begun to characterize its of
fense. Losing games by one goal, the
team returned to Stanford, leaving
hopes of an N( AA appearance be
hind in Boston.
I lowever, all was not lost.
With three regular-season games
left to play and a conference cham
pionship tournament looming near,
Stanford returned home to its Varsi
ty Hockey Astroturf Field ready to
rebound to the level of play that had
propelled it through the first half of
the season.

After making victims of Pacific,
IK -Davis and California. Stanford
traveled to St. Louis last Thursday
to begin play in the Northern Pacif
ic Conference championship tour
nament.
Three days later, it returns, this
time as champions.
Yesterday, Stanford (13-5, 5-0
Northern Pacific Conference) faced
Southwest Missouri State in the
NorPac Championship game. De
termined to retain the crown of Nor-
Pac Conference champions, the
Cardinal followed the path it has
trod since the beginning of the sea
son by defeating SMSI J, 3-2.
However this match did not
come as easily as matches have in
the past for Stanford.
Through the first half, the cham
pionship game remained dead
locked at 0-0 with the Cardinal of
fense being limited to just a handful
of shots.
Then, as the second half began to
tick down, SMSI I did something
that no other team has done against
Stanford since that East Coast trip.
With 2~V2(i left in the game. SMSIJ
took the lead, 1-0.
For the next live minutes Stan
ford was behind. But it was not to
last. Stanford, who had shutout
SMSI J in its fourth game of the sea
son, was not content to be behind.
Senior forward and team co-cap
tain Justina Williams sent an assist
from fellow senior Carey Cloyd into
the goal, tying the game at 1-1.
Williams, who finished the regular
season with seven points, demon
strated why she was named the Nor-
Pac Player of the Year by giving her
team the spark that had been so elu
sive during the first half.
Three minutes later the Cardinal
struck again. Recording her second
assist of the game, Cloyd sent a pass
to the team's leading scorer, senior
forward Monique Leroux. Leroux
capitalized on the assist by scoring
Stanford's second goal of the game.
SMSU was undoubtedly frustrated
by Leroux's success against its de
fense, as the Cardinal had recorded
three points in Stanford's regular
season match against it in Septem
ber.
Anxious to get in on the action,
senior sweeper Lissy Goralnik
scored Stanford's final goal of the
game unassisted. Goralnik had live
goals during the regular season.
Down 1-3 with just over one
minute left. SMSU pieced together a
final offensive, cutting the Cardinal's
lead to one.

Stanford, however, held on to the
lead and finished the game as the
1998 NorPac Conference champi
ons. After the match, Cloyd was rec
ognized as the tournament's Most
Valuable Player for her two assists in
the championship game. Cloyd had
five assists and six goals during the
regular season.
When the final whistle blew,
Stanford had taken just 14 shots, far
fewer than its season average, but
still three more than SMSU's total.
Accordingly, sophomore goalie Meg
Crowley finished with two fewer
saves than did Missouri's goalie.
The game was a fitting end to the
season. This year will see the depar
ture of a large class of seniors that
have been a major factor behind the
team's continued success. As if to
enjoy their final match together, the
squad engineered each of Stanford's
scoring drives.
Unsurprisingly, three seniors
were named to the All-Conference
Team yesterday for their contribu
tions to Stanford's success. For the
second consecutive season, Goral
nik, Leroux and Williams will be
honored by joining the ranks of the
All-NorPac squad.
To make all this possible, the Car
dinal shut out St. Louis University
on Saturday, 3-0, advancing to Sun
day's championship game. Earlier in
the season, Stanford had defeated

St. Louis 4-0 at Cal.
In ensuing seasons, the NorPac
Conference Champion will have an
opportunity to play in the NCAA
postseason tournament. However,
for this year's seniors, the change
will be made one year too late.
At the start of the season, the
team set three goals for itself — to
reach the NCAA tournament, to
better last season's record of 16-6
and to repeat as conference champi
ons.
To be considered for the NCAA
tournament, the team would have
had to go virtually undefeated, win
ning its toughest games against the
field hockey powerhouses of the
East Coast.
While the team fell just short of
that goal, the others were far from
out of reach.
Completing the season 13-5,
Stanford accomplished its aim to im
prove on last season's record, losing
one less game than the 1997 Cardi
nal.
Yesterday the Cardinal achieved
its other goal as it was named the
1998 NorPac Conference champi
ons.
Champions for another year,
Stanford will have a chance to rest
before preparation begins for anoth
er season.
And another shot at the
NCAA's.
