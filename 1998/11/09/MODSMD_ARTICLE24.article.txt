Although the Stanford women's
soccer team (11-6-2 overall, 5-4 Pa
cific 10 Conference) has struggled
through less than ideal perfor
mances in its midseason games, all
aspects came together this weekend
to create the consummate conclu
sion to an otherwise turbulent sea
son — two home games, two 4-0 vic
tories and an NCAA tournament in
vitation.

4 Pacific 10 Conference) defeated
Oregon State ((Vll -1.1 -7). 4-0.
■ Sunday: Stanford defeated Ore
gon (11-6-2,3-6), 4-0.

Last night at 6:30 p.m., the
NCAA tournament selection com
mittee ended Stanford's anxiety sur
rounding its post-season ambitions
and announced that the Cardinal
was one of 48 teams offered an invi
tation to the tournament. Stanford is
one of five Pac-10 teams who will
compete in the tournament along
with Washington, USC, California
and UCLA. Competition begins on
Wednesday when Stanford travels

eighth NCAA tournament appear

ford's playoff opportunities.
Last year, despite an 11-7-1 over
all record and a 6-2-1 conference
record, the NCAA did not offer the
Cardinal an invitation to the tourna
ment.
"Last year. I thought we would
make it in.and then we didn't." said
senior midfielder Christy Stoffel be
fore yesterday's announcement.
Stanford relied on the team's per
formances in its last four matchups,
strength of its schedule as well as its
preseason victories over top-20
teams to attain a tournament bid.
"I'm very confident," said Cardi
nal head coach Steve Swanson.
"This team deserves to go to the
tournament."
The two victories this weekend
were critical in maintaining Stan
ford's post-season aspirations. The
Cardinal defeated the Oregon
Ducks (11-6-2, 3-6) yesterday and
the Oregon State Beavers(6-11-1,1-
7) on Friday to extend its winning
streak to four games.
After Friday's victory, the team
did not expect the ambiguous status
of its tournament invitation to affect
its concentration and performance
in Sunday's matchup.
"This team is experienced
[enough] not to look too far for
ward," Swanson added. "We know
what we have to do. We have to han

take care of itself."
Yesterday, Stanford carried the
momentum from its upset win over
Washington hist weekend and came
out with an invigorated, aggressive
playing style.
" The team looked dangerous in
its attack." Swanson added.
The Cardinal outshot the Ducks
17-1 during this half. Despite these
shot opportunity disparities, the

Cardinal only managed one goal
during this half. Stanford junior for
ward Kelly Adamson seored in the
2()th minute of play off a header
from teammate and sophomore for
ward Christy Arnold.
Stanford's scoring more closely
correlated with its offensive domi
nance during the second half. Junior
midfielder Ronnie Fair scored just
three minutes into the second half to
establish the Cardinal's lead for the
remainder of the game. Junior for
ward Catherine Bernard scored less
than 12 minutes later. Adamson also
added her second goal of the game.

Despite the shutout victory, im
ages of the Cardinal's midseason
games in which the team did not im
pose its style for the full l X) minutes
resurfaced.
"We are still trying to gel the full
90 minutes of effort," said Swanson.
"OSU didn't create too much and
we needed to develop our rhythm."
As with Adamson's two-goal
performance during yesterday's
match-up. she was an essential asset
to Friday's victory.
"Kelly Adamson made a big dif
ference," Swanson said. "She has
the ability to defeat people in the

one-on-one situations.
Freshmarrforward Erin Maurer
contributed two goals to Stanford's
victory. The first goal occurred
during the third minute of play and
