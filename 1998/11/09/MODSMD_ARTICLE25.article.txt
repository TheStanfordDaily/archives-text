■ Friday: No. 5 Stanford (21-2 overall, 14-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) defeated California (6-19.
2-12). 15-4. 15-9, 15-2.

At times in Friday night's match between
No. 5 Stanford and ( al. it was more than just
the atmosphere surrounding the court that re
minded the <S5O tightly packed fans of high
school volleyball.
In the end. however, Stanford (21-2 overall,
14-0 Pacific 10 ( onference) battled through its
10 service errors and extended its winning
streak to 20 with a three-game sweep of the

scrappy C iolden Hears, 15-4. 15- 1 ). 15-2.
In the absence ol its primary offensive
weapon, junior captain Brook Coulter, and
three other starters. (a I (ft-1 L K 2-12) was forced
to send a younger and smaller lineup on the
floor against the towering Stanford front line.
As it turned out. the ( 'ardinal also looked to
its younger players for most of its offensive
production. Junior outside hitter Kerri \Y;ilsh,
the team's leader in hitting percentage, had no
kills in only five attempts.
Freshman Michelle ( hambers was more
than able to pick up the slack on the outside
and finished with a match-high 15 kills, hitting
.520. Junior Sarah ( lark, plasing the third hit
ter position for Stanford, was also a huge con
tributor. adding 11 kills.
"I was really happy with how I played."
Chambers said. "Hut the way I look at it. I
missed four serves, and I need to work on
that."
('a I sui pi ised the ('ardinal in the first game
by jumping out to a.VI lead. 1 lie Hears held on
to the lead foi a while, repeatedly siding out at

3-2. Fventually, however. Stanford went on a
V 0 run to finish off the Hears.
I lie second game proved to be California's
best effort. After falling behind 7-2. the Hears
went oil a run and closed the gap to within two,
at 7-5. Cal continued to battle throughout the
second and found itself down just three late in
the game. I2- I >. Stanford dashed Cal's hopes
for a game victory with three quick points to
close the door.
(ianie three featured the type of Stanford
blowout that many had anticipated heading
into the match. I he Cardinal rolled to an easy
15-2 victory, hitting .4ft2 and holding Cal to a
dismal negative .120 mark.
For the match. Stanford out hit the Golden
Bears, .443 to .044.
I lie final game also gave Shaw an opportu
nity to make some popular substitutions.
Sophomore outside hitter Alex Newell and ju
nior Katherine kuchenbecker both made late
appearances in game three, and Newell tallied
point number 14 for Stanford with a service
ace.

Tara Conrad also made the most of her
playing time, as the freshman middle blocker
posted five kills on six attempts, good for an
.833 hitting percentage — ;i new career high.
In the end. the trip across the Bay was suc
cessful for the C ardinal, as it racked up yet an
other win and moved one step closer to the
Pac-10 title.
Perhaps more importantly, Stanford once
again proved that it can win without Walsh
swinging at full strength.
"We know Kerri's shoulder is hurting her
right now." Chambers said. "And we also
know that her sheer presence on the court,
with the defense and blocking that she gives us,
is incredible. Without heron the court, there is
a hole out there."
Chambers, in particular, elevated her game
and carried the Stanford offense.
"Of course I was happy with the win."
( hambers said. "We were glad to get out of
there in three games. We definitely need to
work on our serving, but overall, we passed
pretty well and worked together as a team."
