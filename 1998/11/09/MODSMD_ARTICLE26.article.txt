MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. I I ISC' (I<S-1 overall,
6-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) defeated No. 3 Stanford (15-6.
6-2). 15-13.

Nevertheless, the No. 3 Stanford
men's water polo team (15-6 overall.
6-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) gave the crowd an exciting and
action-packed game against the top
ranked 11S(' Trojans (18-1. 6-0) on
Saturday before suffering a heart
breaking 15-13 loss. And the ( ardi
nal earned a lot ol respect for bat
tling back after falling behind 5-0 in
the first quarter.
"You've got to give the guys cred
it for coming back from a 5-0 deficit
against the top team in the nation."
Dettamanti s;iid.
The Trojans got four quick goals,
one of which was a two-point shot, in
the first four and a half minutes of
the game. Stanford's first goal of the
game was also a two-pointer, shot by

senior Jeremiah Kobison with 2:00
left in the quarter. But less than 30
seconds later. I !S(' scored on a man
up opportunity to end the first peri
od 6-2.
"You can't let a team get up by
five goals and expect to beat them af
terwards," said Stanford assistant
coach Ben Quittner. "It's hard when
you're so fired up and you gel tight
and then you can't do any thing."
Stanford did manage to loosen up
and came out fighting in the second
quarter, scoring the first three goals
of the quarter on shots from juniors
Andy Walburger and Brian Heiffer
on and senior Layne Beaubien.
Once again. I JSC capitalized on a
six-on-live advantage at 2:02 in the
second quarter. The Cardinal an
swered back in the last l<S seconds
with a skip shot goal by Heifferon,
who leads the Stanford squad with
36 points this year. I leifferon's goal
came off an assist from senior goalie
Chris Aguilera, who collected eight
saves in the match, to bring his sea
son total to 179.
Beaubien, who currently is sec
ond on the team in scoring with 32
points on the season, started off the
third quarter with a man-up goal to
tie the game at 7. Stanford took the
lead at 3:07 with a sweep-shot from
senior hole set Arturo Rodelo. But
the I rojans tied things up again on a
six-on-five opportunity and recap

lured the lead less than a minute
later when the Cardinal defense
failed to mark an open I JS(' player.
Walburger scored again for the Car
dinal with O:4S left on the clock and
once again, the teams were tied.
Stanford was nil set to head into the
final quarter with a tie. but in the
last second of the third period I JS(
scored a two point shot to take an
11 -9 lead..
" The guys didn't panic when we
got behind." Dettamanti said
Kodclo closed the gap with a
man-up goal in the first 1:20 of the
last period.
But yet another two pointer and
a six-on five goal for I 'S( increased
the Trojans' lead to 14-10.
Heaubien scored his third goal of
the game on a four-meter penalty
shot, but USC converted another
man-up opportunity to increase the
score to 15-11.
Even though the Cardinal was
now down by four. Stanford contin
ued to battle.
With 27 seconds left in the game,
junior Michael Lipinski scored a
two-pointer.
"We continued to build momen
tum there at the end," Walburger
said. "I'm proud the we continued to
fight.''
Stanford made a final effort to tie
things up with a two-point shot by
Aguilera from half-court in the last

four seconds of play, but I 'SC' goalie
Richard Mcl voy blocked the shot
and I ISC came away victorious.
"It's ironic that I've been talking
about how we need to score more

and the time we have the most goals
in the season, we still lose." Detta
manti said.
"It was a classic water polo game
with lots of scoring and fans going

crazy and two of the top teams in the
nation playing.
"The guys played out of their
minds. It was just a few mental laps
es that lost us the game," he added.
