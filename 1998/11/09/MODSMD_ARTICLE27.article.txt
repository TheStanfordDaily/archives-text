Following up on the campus-wide
grapes education and vote, the
Coalition lor Labor. Dignity and Jus
tice is presenting "Week of the
Workers," a series of programs that
w ill focus on labor issues.
"The goal of the week is to in
crease student awareness on labor is
sues." said sophomore Seth Newton,
the co-coordinator of Students lor
Environmental Action at Stanford.
"Most people know the grapes vote
was [last| week, but this is building
awareness for other movements."
The week's activities serve as a se
quel to last year's "Labor Week ol
Action." which was also staged by

the coalition, a joint effort of SEAS
and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino
student group.
The highlight of the week will he
on Thursday night when Dolores
Huerta, the co-founder of the United
Farm Workers, will speak at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium. She will address
organizing efforts that the HEW has
been involved with, including the
strawberry and grapes issues.
()ther events begin today at noon
with poetry readings and a perfor
mance of Guerrilla Theatre in White
Plaza.
"(iuerrilla Theatre isa form of so
cial protest drama that is constructed
so it can be presented on the streets
or in different contexts," Newton
saiil. It will address living conditions

and pesticide use in the strawberry
fields and is a shorter version of the
"moving theater" performance that
will be appearing at various locations
across campus on evenings through
out the week.
Tuesday's event is entitled
"Workers Speak Out" and will also
take place at noon in White Plaza. It
will feature a former organizer for
the United Farm Workers and a cur
rent organizer from the Stanford
I lospital. whose employees will vote
on Nov. 19 on whether to unionize.
The organizers "will speak out
about issues that laborers face when
they attempt to unionize, such as the
injustices and prohibitive factors,"
said junior Genevieve Aguilar, the
co-chair for MEChA.

Laborers from the strawberry
fields and the hospital are also sched
uled to speak. "We want to bring
workers to Stanford so students can
directly hear their point of view."
Newton said.
The week concludes on Friday
with a performance at noon in White
Plaza by Quetzal, a contemporary
Latin band.
"They are going to do movimien
to musicâ€”it correlates with activism
in the past," Aguilarsaid. "It talks of
the struggle for justice and inspires
people to keep working for their
cause."
In addition, UFW organizer
Sarah Flocks is scheduled to talk
about unions in general and how
they relate to students at Stanford.
