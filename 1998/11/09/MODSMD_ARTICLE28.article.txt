# Sales on Web site fund charities

### Chien Si Harriman 
Consumers who choose to buy
products over the Internet now have
a chance to shop and save not
only a few dollars but quite possibly
the world.
According to business school
graduate Scott Dunlap, what began
as a Web site for "notes and stuff"
has now developed into a network
designed to give consumers the op
tion to purchase products with a por
tion of the proeeeds donated to
charity.
Dunlap. the founder and owner
of the charity Web site,
http://www.4eharity.com, said that
this project has become a "labor of
love" since its inception in Decem
ber IW7.
At that time, Dunlap was still a
graduate student in Stanford's busi
ness school where he got the inspira
tion to do the site. "At first the site
was a free rider, with other members
of my classes going on to post class
notes and questions."
Dunlap said the site provided "a
cohesive community" for his class

mates, which "lit into the Stanford
business school ethic of teamwork in
the workplace."
I he charity aspect of the site's
development began out of a Pac-10
business school competition called
Challenge for Charity. Dunlap
turned his page into a site selling
textbooks at a reduced price to stu
dents through the popular Internet
bookstore Amazon.com.
Dunlap struck a deal with Ama
zon.com to donate a portion of the
profits to the Special ()lympics.
People began Hocking to the site
based on word of mouth only, many
of them non-Stanlord-students,
Dunlap said. Although the site was
successful, Dunlap said sales went
down at the Stanford Bookstore and
some authors became upset, person
ally contacting him and complaining
that they counted on Stanford's
book sales to make money and at the
reduced prices, they were losing out.
The criticism achieved little in
terms ol weakening Dunlap's spirit,
he said. When he graduated in IWS,
Dunlap decided to maintain the
Web site through the creation of

http://www.4charity.com. Although
he had a regular job. he kept his
charity network online through late
nights of coding.
Today the site offers at least 12
vendors, including Amazon and
Music Boulevard, as well as eToys
and Beyond.com, a software ven
dor. While all of these sites still exist
independently, by going to the char
ity site first, proceeds from a pur
chase are donated to charity at no
additional cost to the consumer.
()n arriving to the site, a shopper
registers and selects one of six chari
ties — the Lance Armstrong Foun
dation promoting urological cancer
awareness, The American Red
Cross, the Special Olympics, the
World Wildlife Fund, the Kapiolani
Health Foundation supporting chil
dren's health programs in Hawaii
and Cure Autism Now. Proceeds
vary according to the company from
which the purchases are made.
According to Dunlap, the site has
become a powerful tool "to change
the way that people look at charities
and giving money to charities."
Carl Anderson, a current busi

ness school student, said that the site
makes charitable works a part of
everyday life, challenging the tradi
tional notions of philanthropy.
Whereas once an occasional check
was put in the mail, now people can
make donations every time they
shop, he said.
Dunlap said that people really
like feeling good about donating
money to a charity while shopping
and recent registration figures show
the membership is nearly doubling
in size weekly.
Both Dunlap and Anderson see
the potential for business growth,
but they are more concerned with
the differences the site is making.
"I don't care if this site is not
around in a couple of years. As long
as the spirit of 4charity continues,
and every company is donating to
charities, then I have won," Dunlap
said.
"What a difference it would
make if everyone took that extra
click and came to our site," Ander
son said. "Think of what would hap
pen if every CD in America were
bought through us."
