# One win, one tie and quite a rough battle
## No. 8 Stanford men's soccer team defeats UC-Irvine, ties with Cal State Fullerton 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
With a win and a tie this weekend, the No.
8 Stanford men's soccer team (14-4-1, 5-2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) kept
alive its hopes of hosting a tournament
game. A 3-1 victory over UC-Irvine (8-11,2-
6) and a 1-1 tie against No. 13 Cal State-
Fullerton (13-4-2, 5-1-1) already gives the
Cardinal a better record than last season
with one game left to play.
The matchup against Fullerton was sig

nificant for both teams trying to claw to the
top of the MPSF. The Titans, who upset No.
1 UCLA earlier this season, have only lost
one conference game,a 2-1 defeat at the
hands of No. 2 Washington. And it was clear
from yesterday's intensity that both teams
had a lot riding on this game.
In a hard fought, double-overtime battle,
Stanford emerged with its first tie of the sea
son. Although a frustrating result from a
game the Cardinal controlled, outshooting
the Titans 12-7, the team kept its positive at
titude after the game.

"We are disappointed that we didn't get
the win, but a tie is better than a loss," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark. "I sup
pose we are due a tie this year."
The Cardinal has outplayed several of its
opponents this season, but has not been able
to covert all the convincing performances
into victories.
And again yesterday, Stanford outplayed
its opponent but was unable to come up with
a win.
"It is hard to keep doing what you are
doing and not get results. It is a matter of us

being patient," said senior midfielder Shan
Gaw.

■ Friday: No. 8 Stanford (14-4-1 overall, 5-2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) defeated
UC-Irvine (8-11.2-6). 3-1.
■ Sunday: Stanford tied with Cal State-
Fullerton (13-4-2.5-1-1), 1-1 (20T).

Stanford went on top with a goal in the
26th minute bv freshman Lee Morrison.

Gaw started the play with a nice pass to se
nior defender Jamie Clark who was up in the
box. Jamie Clark avoided his defender and
sent a cross to Morrison, who put the ball in
from two yards out. The goal was Morrison's
third and second of the weekend.
The Titans equalized less than five min
utes later for the game's only other goal.
Titan star Colby Jackson, who put pressure
on Stanford's defense all game long, con
verted the goal off an assist by Art Ramirez.
The play was contested by the Car
dinal. which believed three Titan
players to be offside, but the goal re
mained legitimate. Jackson leads
the MPSFwith 16goals.
Both teams created scoring op
portunities through the game but
neither was able to convert a goal.
The l itans had the overtime's best
opportunity as Stanford goalie
Adam Zapala was forced to make a
strong, diving save in traffic.
The game was a physical battle
from the start, as a total of 43 fouls
occurred and four yellow cards were
issued. Both squads saw numerous
players go down with injuries, but
none is expected to miss a game.
The Cardinal, who normally
plays a very composed style, was
forced into the more physical play of
the Titans.
"At times we got involved (in the
physical play] and that detracts from
what we are trying to do. Hut that
isn't why we tied," (Jaw said.
Friday night's 3-1 victory over the
UC-Irvine Anteaters was a much
calmer match.
Stanford came out slow in the
first half, but scored at the 33-minute
mark. Sophomore Matt Moses put
the Cardinal on top using his speed

to beat his defender to a pass from
senior midfielder Simon Elliott.
Moses eonverted the pass into the
first goal of his Stanford career. El
liott now leads the team with six as
sists.
The Anteaters, however, retali
ated less than four minutes later
with a goal on a Stanford defense
lapse.
After a misplayed head hall, Za
pala was caught out of the goal, and
no defender dropped back into the
goal. Irvine's Michael Mucino
turned the opportunity into the
Anteater's only goal of the night,
chipping the ball over Zapala.
I lie backfield. however, kept its
composure and held Irvine scoreless
the rest of the match.
"What was nice was that Zapala
and the rest of the defense really
kept their composure," Hobby
Clark said.
A different squad, however,
came out in the second half for the
Cardinal, and Irvine was never in
the game.
" The second half was magic. We
felt really good out there." said
freshman midfielder Derek Shana
han.
As the Fullerton game was the
last regular-season home match for
the Cardinal, the eight seniors were
honored in a ceremony before the
battle began.
