# One win, one tie and quite a rough battle
## No. 8 Stanford men's soccer team defeats UC-Irvine, ties with Cal State Fullerton 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
With a win and a tie this weekend, the No.
8 Stanford men's soccer team (14-4-1, 5-2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) kept
alive its hopes of hosting a tournament
game. A 3-1 victory over UC-Irvine (8-11,2-
6) and a 1-1 tie against No. 13 Cal State-
Fullerton (13-4-2, 5-1-1) already gives the
Cardinal a better record than last season
with one game left to play.
The matchup against Fullerton was sig

nificant for both teams trying to claw to the
top of the MPSF. The Titans, who upset No.
1 UCLA earlier this season, have only lost
one conference game,a 2-1 defeat at the
hands of No. 2 Washington. And it was clear
from yesterday's intensity that both teams
had a lot riding on this game.
In a hard fought, double-overtime battle,
Stanford emerged with its first tie of the sea
son. Although a frustrating result from a
game the Cardinal controlled, outshooting
the Titans 12-7, the team kept its positive at
titude after the game.

"We are disappointed that we didn't get
the win, but a tie is better than a loss," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark. "I sup
pose we are due a tie this year."
The Cardinal has outplayed several of its
opponents this season, but has not been able
to covert all the convincing performances
into victories.
And again yesterday, Stanford outplayed
its opponent but was unable to come up with
a win.
"It is hard to keep doing what you are
doing and not get results. It is a matter of us

being patient," said senior midfielder Shan
Gaw.
