"When you have a real young
team, it's good to get in game rou
tines," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "It helps to iden
tify things [we need] to work on."
This will be the Cardinal's sec
ond and final test before the com

petition gets exponentially
tougher at the Nike Four in the
Fall tournament this Friday and
Saturday. Three of the nation's
elite teams, fourth-ranked Duke,
No. 18 Arkansas and No. 3 Con
necticut. will be present at the pre
season tournament.
Last Monday, in its first match
of the season, Stanford made
quick work of the Armed Forces,
beating the team 94-75. Sopho
more center Carolyn Moos led the
Cardinal with 25 points, nine re
bounds and two blocks. Freshman
forward Cori Enghusen also
played well and had a strong first
Stanford showing with 11 re
bounds and two blocks.
"We have kids that expect to
win and are practicing very hard,"
VanDerveer said.
VanDerveer was able to test

most of her forces as 11 of the 13
Stanford players saw action on
Monday. The team played without
the experience of lone senior
Regan Fruen and blue-chip fresh
man Lindsay Yamasaki. Both sat
out for the Cardinal's first exhibi
tion game after suffering injuries
in a practice on Oct. 22.
With only one senior, Van-
Derveer will rely on several young
and inexperienced players this
season. Yamasaki is an important
factor in that equation.
"We're hoping she won't miss
any games," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal, selected to finish
second, this season to UCLA in a
preseason media poll, is not the
only Pacifc 10 Conference team to
be in the Associated Press top-25
poll. UCLA is ranked sixth and
Arizona is ranked 21st.
