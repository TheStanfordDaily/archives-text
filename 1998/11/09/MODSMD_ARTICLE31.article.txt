MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: Stanford defeated Cal
State-Bakersfield and San Francisco
State.

The Cardinal dominated the
pool, placing first and second in
every event except for the 100-yard
backstroke and the 2(X) freestyle
relay. Two Stanford swimmers
placed first in two events. Senior
Casey Ketterling won both the 200-
yard individual medley (1:55.90) and
the 1 (X) breaststroke (1:00.72). Ju
nior Kurt Spencer was the other
swimmer placing first twice, winning
the 50 (21.50) and l(X)-yard (47.24)
freestyles.
"The meet was about us learning
that we could maintain a high level

of racing intensity week in and week
out," said senior and defending
NCAA 200-meter butterfly champi
on Matthew Pierce.
Scoring was different than usual
due to the fact that three teams com
peted. Stanford beat both San Fran
cisco State and Cal State-Bakers
field with scores of 135-59 and 126-
76 respectively. Bakersfield tri
umphed over San Francisco State
171-31. Both of Stanford's competi
tors at the past meet were Division 11
schools.
Times were not as fast as usual at
this meet for two reasons. First, Bak
ersfield and San Francisco State are
not as competitive as other schools
against which Stanford competes.
Secondly, the team is in the hardest
part of its season in terms of training
and conditioning, making the team
members more tired and slowing
them down in the water.
"It was a good meet overall which
was impressive because of our bro
ken-down conditions and a rough
workout week [the week before the
meet]," said junior co-captain Glen
Counts.
Despite the less-than-competi

tive conditions, the meet still accom
plished a lot for the Cardinal. It gave
the team a chance to gauge its poten
tial.
"We will clearly he much faster at
the end of the season, but everyone
knows where they need to be,"
Pierce said. "But in practice and in
meets, we are at the level to be
NCAA champions again."
Due to the fact that the two teams
were not as competitive, the lineup
for each event was much different
from the one seen at other, more
competitive competitions. Stanford
swimmers participated in events that
they did not usually swim in. giving
them more experience all around
and allowing them to score in events
they usually do not.
Swimming different events "pro
vided another training experience,"
said Counts.
For each event, there were two
heats — one officially used for scor
ing and one unofficial, primarily just
for the experience and to give more
people a chance at competing in
more events. This also gave the

swimmers a greater opportunity to
participate in many different events.
Overall, the meet was a chance for
Stanford to be in another racing sit
uation.
"The meet was a chance to do all
the little things right," said freshman
distance swimmer Rcid Ciustin. "It
was also an opportunity to have a
good time racing."
Both Cal State-Bakersfield and
San Francisco State did not neces

sarily show Stanford what it needed
to improve and work on to he the
most eompetitive team when it ar
rives at March's NCAA champi
onships. However, the two teams
did show the Cardinal team mem
bers what could be improved in
terms of stroke technique and racing
aspects of swimming such as starts
and turns, relay exchanges and fin
ishing strong at the end of a race.
I'his meet was Stanford's last
scored meet of the season. The Car
dinal swimmers will host rival Cali
fornia on Nov. 19 at 2 p.m. in a dou
ble-distance exhibition meet.
