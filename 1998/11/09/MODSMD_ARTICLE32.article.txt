# Thinking about sexuality
## Workshop on sexuality a latex-filled success 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Anyone walking by the Women's
Center last Tuesday night might have
thought it was dosed. The entrvway
was dark and inside the lights were
oil Inside the building near the
couches, a small group of people sat
in an imperfect circle on the carpet.
The overhead lights indeed were off.
but the glare of the fluorescent lights
above would have created a sterile,
uncomfortable, scrutinizing environ
ment.
Instead, tapestries covered the
television and stereo system, and the
only light source came from a small
table lamp and numerous lit candles.
Welcome to the second workshop on
sexuality at the Women's Center.

Female Sexuality Series, for fun,
food, and free latex!!! Did you know
that it's against the law to own more
than sixdildos in Arizona and Texas?
I'll Women's Center presents 'Dil
dos, Dental Dams, and Decoutage:
('reating a ( anvas of Pleasure.' "
At the workshop, a closer look to
the center of the circle revealed a
mountainous pile of what seemed
like every possible kind of condom
ami lubricant. In addition, one could
spot female condoms, dental dams, a
couple of dildos, latex gloves, scis
sois. leaves, glitter, Elmer's glue, and
nail polish.
In attempt to create a "Canvas of
Pleasure," all of the 13 women and
the one man present used construc
tion paper as their own canvas and all
t he supplies in the middle of the circle
as their paint. This canvas was sup
posed to express ideas or feelings
ah tut sex, sexuality, or sexual identi
ty
" The purpose of this activity was
to open up a dialogue and extinguish
taboos," said Jenny Asset, program

assistant at the center.
"We wanted to do something with
safer sex, but something interactive,"
she added. " The canvases gave us
something to talk from."
And while they painted their can
vases, the participants passed around
the lubricants and tasted the plethora
of flavors: cherry, passion fruit, kiwi
strawberry, guava, orange-mango,
and cinnamon. There were also non
flavored lubricants and ones with or
without spermicide. The group
talked about the uses of lubricants
and about which lubricants are better
for what.
The program coordinator of the
Women's Center, Shel Tejamo, com
mented on the hands-on experience.
"These workshops create a new
forum for people to touch and see
things that they otherwise wouldn't
have."
The participants tore into the con
doms, unrolling and feeling them:
there were textured, and non-tex
tured condoms, lubricated and non
lubricated, and even mint flavored —
Kiss-o-Mint condoms — for oral sex.
Before long, they had a big, slimy,
thought-provoking mess all over
their hands and canvases. This end
result was the exactly the intention (if
the exercise.
These workshops, which will be
held twice monthly, were established
to explore topics of sex and sexuality.
The original idea was to get a dia
logue started on female sexuality.
" These workshops focus primari
ly on a woman's perspective, and not
just the heterosexual perspective,"
Asset' said.
The first workshop was organized
around the arrival and introduction
of Gwendolyn Dean, the new direc
tor of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
( omm unity Center. The primary ac
tivity that night was a general chat
among the group in order to get a feel
for what needs to be discussed.

For the second workshop, though,
Assef commented that "it was good
to have (the canvases] to focus on."
The discussion after the creation
of the canvases was tangential. Assef
started the conversation by asking
whether anyone had experienced
anything new or uncomfortable
while making the canvases. Soon the
conversation turned to how medical
risks involved in sex affect how peo
ple feel sexually. The participants
talked about their parents' roles in
discussing sex during their childhood.
Then the conversation moved
from discussing the reality of living
with an STD to the logistics of sexual
acts, to initiating foreplay and sex, to
thinking about who wants it more —
men or women — to orgasm to the
mythology surrounding multi-orgas
mic women.
From the variation in the content
of the conversation it was obvious
that the participants determined the
course of the discussion.
"It's the Women's Center," Assef
stressed. "The program belongs to
the people who attend. It's grassroots
in the sense that anyone who's been
to the events can also lead a future
workshop."
Sophomore Casey Ward, the
head of counselor education at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Cen
ter. attended the second workshop
and contributed the dildos to the pile.
Ward thought it was important to
have these discussions on campus.
"They make people feel more
comfortable with their own choices,"
she said. "The hands-on experience
with latex and to know what it feels
like before you're in the heat of the
moment is awesome."
" There is an American cultural
issue of not being comfortable with
sexuality, particularly female sexual
ity," Ward remarked.
"College is the time to explore
these topics."
