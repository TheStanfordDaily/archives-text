## Bohrer to speak 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Karl I leinz Bohrer, renowed Ger
man journalist, professor and cultur
al critic, will speak tonight as part of
the Presidential Lectures and Sym
posia Series.
Bohrer, considered by many as
one of Germany's most provocative
cultural experts, will speak on "With
out Future: What does Poetic Ni
hilism mean for Interpretation, The
ater and State?" ;it 7 p.m. in the Lan
guage Corner.
In an interview. Bohrer explained
his concept of the separation be
tween politics and aesthetics.
"Politics and art are things which
don't go together," he said.
Bohrer acknowledged the con
vention of speaking of literature and
politics in tandem, but he argued that
aesthetic experience should not be
tied to politics.
"Literature has something to do
with society. Since Sartre ... politics
and literature [have gone] together. I
see the gulf." Bohrer said.
"The language of literature be
longs to some kind of imaginative
sphere which is not determined by
the end of politics, practical life.
| There lies| the infinity where every
thing is allowed, even unethical
thoughts," he said.
Politically motivated art is some
times useful, Bohrer said, but only
when its purpose is very clear.
In an example of art with a clear
political purpose, Bohrer recalled the
BBC using Beethoven during World
War II to promote British national
ism.
"Its purpose was obvious. It is
dangerous when no one exactly un
derstands that this is art. It will be
cleverly used propaganda. I think ...
this is very dangerous," he said.
"Where I protest is when art loses
its own dimensions in order to seduce
somebody," Bohrer added.

One of the questions that Bohrer
will address in his lecture is whether
and to what extent it is possible to
promote aesthetic experience
through lectures or other forms of in
struction, said Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Hans Gumbrecht.
Gumbrecht noted that Bohrer's
concept of "aesthetic nihilism." un
like the conventional use of "ni
hilism," refers to the idea that aes
thetic experiences are sudden and in
tensely personal.
Gumbrecht said in an essay titled
"The Bohrer Challenge" that Bohrer
is the most vehement of all critics and
philosophers about the "autonomy
of the aesthetic experience."
In Bohrer's concept of "sudden
ness, the aesthetic experience just
happens — a moment in this lighten
ing structure. There's no yield. It's
just an isolated experience," Gum
brecht said.
Bohrer spent much of his early life
as a journalist and cultural critic.
In the early 1980s, he turned to
academia, joining the University of
Beilefield as a professor of Modern
German Literary History.
Arguing that the academy is a
"place of discussion," Bohrer said the
role of the academic is to not speak in
cliches.
"As a result of not speaking in
cliches ... there is a chance to find
some concept of non-ideological
truth.
"An academic is not a man who
talks about esoteric stuff; he should
be very interested in politics."
"As an academic, one is forced to
argue and not to speak in terms of
power play The academy is not a
place of power, it is a place of discus
sion — this in itself is political." he
said.
()nly one of Bohrer's books, titled
"Suddenness," has been translated
into English.
Thus, his ideas are not familiar to
most Americans.
