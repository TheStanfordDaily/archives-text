# Card can't get conference win
## USC shuts down Stanford, 34-9, in frustrating loss on the Farm 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
One week after putting the col
lege football world on its ear with a
near upset of No. 2 UCLA, the Stan
lord football team (1-7 overall. 0-6
Pacific 10 Conference) couldn't
avoid a letdown Saturday against
unranked USC (7-3,5-2). The Cardi
nal's lackluster performance con
trasted sharply with last week's emo
tional roller coaster, as Stanford
came out flat against a superior Tro
jan team,was frustrated on both
sides of the ball and losing the game,
34-9.
'It's hard whether to say we took
a step back today." said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "It
wasn't the performance we were
looking for."
Continuing what has been a dis

turbing trend in the Cardinal's six
game losing streak. USC won the
toss and immediately scored on Pet
ros Papadakis' one-yard blast on
third and goal. R. Jay Soward. the
Trojan's prime offensive weapon,
left the game on the drive, but the
beleaguered Stanford defense might
have preferred he stay in, as it found
no way to stop his replacements at
wideout for the rest of the game.

FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: I 'S(' (7-3 overall. 5-2 Pa
cific 10 Conference) defeated Stan
ford (1-7.0-6). 34-9.

In what was perhaps the lone
bright spot in the Cardinal's long
day, freshman tailback Brian Allen
provided the offense with its first
spark in the running game since last
season. Allen ran strong on the first

drive, picking up 17 yards on five car
ries, and finished the day with 7K
yards on 20 carries.
" This was a defense that played
with a front seven and didn't go to as
many eight-man fronts as other
teams we've faced." Willingham
said. "We thought we could run. In
fact, we knew we would have to run.
I think Allen improved. He's getting
smarter and he keeps improving."
Ironically, Stanford could get
nothing going in the air to comple
ment its newfound running game.
Stanford's usually potent receiving
corps of Dave Davis, Troy Walters
and Deßonnie Pitts were held to a
combined total of 86 yards on 10
catches.
Walters did not play after half
time, as he may have aggravated the
nagging ankle injury that kept him
out of three games earlier this sea

son.
In Walters' absence, quarterback
Todd Husak suffered his worst game
of the season, throwing two inter
ceptions and fumbling twice. The
turnovers led to 17 points, seven of
which came on a fumble caused by
blitzing linebacker Zeke Moreno.
Moreno blindsided 1 lusak. stripping
the ball, and defensive tackle Aaron
Williams scooped up the prize and
lumbered IX yards for a backbreak
ing score.
"It felt like the ground caused
[the fumble] but these split-second
type things are tough to call," Husak
said. "For me to come out and play
that poorly is inexcusable. I take a lot
of credit for this loss. I didn't execute
well enough for Stanford to win the
game."
Stanford had a chance to crawl
back into the game, at the end of the
first half, when a Ruben Carter in
terception set the Cardinal up at
USC's 45-yard line. With 10 seconds
left, 1 lusak hit Davis on a 11 y pattern
in the back of the end zone, but
Davis couldn't hang on and Stanford
went into the locker room trailing
17-7.
I lusak came out in the third quar
ter playing much better than he had
in the first half, going eight for 12 for
95 yards, but after an Adam Abrams
field goal gave USC a 13-point lead,
it was too little too late.
"If I play in the first and second
quarters like 1 did in the third, we
might have had a chance." Husak
said. "It's frustrating. They were
good. I give them a lot of credit. We
don't see that much zone, because
pretty much everyone in the Pac 10
plays man [defense]."
To Husak's credit, the I ISC sec
ondary smothered the Stanford re
ceivers long after he had been re
placed by redshirt-freshman quar
terback Joe Borchard.
"As a whole, this is the best sec
ondary we've faced," Pitts said.
"They have a nose for when the re
ceiver is going to break and I think
they have confidence in their ability
to close oil the receiver."
Twisting the knife, the Trojans
punched in a meaningless touch
down as time ran out, making the
final score 34-9. The win made I ISC
eligible for a bowl and almost
squeaked it into the top 25.
