MEN S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: No. 3 Stanford defeated
the Taiwan National Team, 83-35.

"We're starting the procedure
of getting the guys to understand
that minutes are going to be key."
said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We need to find the cri
teria we're going to use to see how
minutes are going to be done."
Junior power forward Mark
Madscn led the way for the bal
anced Cardinal attack with 14
points and eight rebounds, while
senior small forward Peter Sauer
added 13 points.
But it was a promising night for
the Cardinal all around.
Redshirt freshman Jason
Collins, w ho sat out last year after
undergoing surgery to repair
frayed meniscus cartilage in his
knee, returned to game action with
a strong 11-point, five-rebound
night.
The knee "feels OK," Collins
said. "It was fun to be out there. It
was fun to play with the guy*."
The year away from game ac
tion has also given the reserve cen
ter a new perspective on the game.
"I was seeing things from the
sideline with the coaches. 1 became
more ofa fan of the sport. 1 love the
game as it is. but this was different."
he said.
"It was nice to see Jason Collins
back," Montgomery said. "It was

nice to see the pros of sitting Jason
out" last year.
Sophomore Jarron Collins,
Jason's twin brother, also had a
productive night, chipping in eight
points and seven rebounds for
Stanford.
In all, 13 Cardinal players saw
time on the floor. The only one not
in action was freshman guard Kyle
I .ogan. who is still unsure whether
he will opt to redshirt this year.
Exhibitions games hurt the pos
sibility of redshirting in the same
way as regular-season games, so
the team decided it best he sit out in
order to buy more time.
"It's something we would con
sider or should be considerate
about," Montgomery said. His not
playing the exhibition "gives us a
little more time to see how this
thing works out."
Logan's status lor Tuesday's ex
hibition against Marathon Oil is
still uncertain.
Senior point guard Arthur Lee
had a quiet night, missing all three
of his shots from the floor and only
scoring two points, but his team
high seven assists helped spread
the scoring around the rest of the
squad.
"1 was happy to get out there
and play a little bit." Lee said. "It's
good to see where we're at. We're
()K. but we always want to be bet
ter."
The Cardinal dominated the
much smaller Taiwan team, outre
bounding its opponent 51-15.
The rebounding margin trans
lated into a 24-3 second-chance
point advantage for Stanford.
Taiwan was led by Cheh Chili
Lung with nine points. Chu-Chih
Ching led with five rebounds.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
2()-point halftime lead, then blew
things open even more with a 31-4
run early in the second half.
