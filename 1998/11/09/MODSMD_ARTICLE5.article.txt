# Student group continues to serve despite fewer resources
## A 						day of Spoon Hunger Relief

Broiled fillets of fish and grilled vegetables arc uncere
moniously dumped into plastic bags. They're taken to a
large freezer behind the Haas Center, where they're stored
with more bags, the contents of which are identified with
yellow tags.
A week later, volunteers of the Urban Ministry of Palo
Alto dish out the same fish and vegetables in a church base
ment to a line of patient people. Some are homeless; others
have run out of money for food.
But the days of this windfall of cooked food for the hun
gry people of Palo Alto seem numbered, as University Din -
ing Services announced last week that it has stopped con
tributing regularly to the Spoon Hunger Relief Network,
the student-run organization that has been collecting left
over food from various eating establishments on campus
since 1987.
Snoon's mission statement asks participating parties to


Deanne Corbett Daily
Volunteers for Urban Ministry of Palo Alto serve food to hungry res
idents of Palo Alto.
"understand that Spoon does not at
tempt to feed community members
by increasing costs, but rather chan
nels the unused food leftovers to
those who need it." But Dining Ser
vices wants its kitchens to control
costs and re-use food as much as pos
sible, leaving managers viewed as vil
lains keeping food from the hungry.
Whatever the case, all of a sudden
lots of people are very interested in
something most of us toss into
garbage cans without a backward
glance — excess food.
A bountiful day at the Faculty Club
There's a lot of food produced at
Stanford every day, especially at the
Faculty Club, where professors linger
over lush buffets piled with tempting
offerings. Spoon has been counting
on pick-ups from the Faculty Club to
keep their freezer full since Dining
Services curtailed its participation in
the program.
On a recent and unusually bounti
ful collection day, Jaime Galvez,
head chef at the Faculty Club, greets
Spoon coordinator Nathan Luther
and two other Spoon volunteers with
a wide smile, motioning them to a
stainless steel counter laden with
dishes of unserved food.
Amid the clatter of clean-up activ
ity, the three Spoon volunteers work
quickly to place the food in the cus
tom-ordered thick plastic bags.
Today, there is pasta salad, grilled
chicken, gourmet pizza, creamy soup
and more keeps appearing as
kitchen staffers bring trays of food to
the bagging counter.
Galvez looks forward to Luther's
visits.
"We always like to help with a
good cause," he says.
According to Galvez, Spoon is
welcome to stop by the Faculty Club
every day of the week.
"We offer a buffet, and it has to be
full until 1:45 every afternoon,"
Galvez explains. "There's always
good quality food left over."

Unlike Dining Services, the Facul
ty Club doesn't often re-use food.
"It's a health hazard" in his opin
ion, says Galvez.
When they are done, Luther and
his crew have 15 bags of food, weigh
ing approximately 127 pounds. Total
time spent in the kitchen: 20 minutes.
"This was a good day,"says
Luther.
He and the others load the bags
into the trunk of a car for the short
trip over to the Haas Center. When
they open the freezer, there are only
three other bags inside. After adding
today's contribution, the volunteers
are free to go. They won't be there
when the Urban Ministry's recently
donated van drives up to empty the
freezer and distribute its contents to
church kitchens all over Palo Alto.
Feeding the hungry
Beneath the United Methodist
Church on Hamilton Avenue, Soren
Stejer, a food director with the Urban
Ministry, helps volunteers prepare a
lunch of vegetable soup, bread, salad,
and cake. Unlike campus dining
halls, almost no food prepared here
goes to waste after it is served to a
crowd of anywhere from 80 to 120
people.
"Food here gets pretty much used
up." said Stejer. "We're doing the
best job we can."
Stejer was able to sum up his reac
tion to Dining Services' new policy
restricting donations to Spoon with
one word.
"Shock," he said. "When 1 go over
to the Haas Center and look in the
freezer, to see nothing there is my
worst fear."
Meanwhile, an orderly line is
forming at the serving table. People
sit at tables set with paper mats and
plastic cutlery. Friends greet each
other, and soon there is a hum of con
versation in the air.
Priscilla Duff, a homeless resident
of Palo Alto, sometimes brings her
friends with her to lunch, but today
she came alone. She watches the ac
tivity in the room with a sharp gaze
between bites.
Duff knows the volunteers who

are working today, some of them by
name.
"They're really nice people," she
says. "They listen to us and treat us
like human beings."
The volunteers are part of the rea
son why Duff likes coming to the
"Breaking Bread" meals — them,
and the food, which is "not just good,
it's excellent."
"Plus it's free," she says."And
you can't get better than that."
Not everyone who eats the food
provided by the Urban Ministry is
homeless.
T here's a lot of low-income peo
ple living in Palo Alto who use the
program because it's so expensive to
live here," says junior ArturTreyster.
a Spoon volunteer who also works
closely with the Urban Ministry.
"There are also a lot of elderly people
on Social Security. Their checks are
enough to cover the rent, but not
meals."
The Urban Ministry doesn't turn
anybody away, nor does it ask about
people's individual circumstances.
"If people want to talk to you,
they'll talk," said Treyster. "But if
they're hungry, give them food. It's a
chance for them to feel that they're
not homeless for a while."
Spoon used to be able to con
tribute around 4<SO pounds of cooked
food per week to the Urban Ministry.
Spoon can now only donate between
a quarter to a third of the amount it
did in the past.
Same mission, different methods
Before Dining Services' Universi
ty-wide policy prohibited scheduled
Spoon pick-ups, kitchen staffers in
dining halls around the campus were
helpful and enthusiastic about donat
ing their leftovers to the organization
— maybe too enthusiastic.
According to Dining Services
Head Chef Rafi Taherian, regular
visits from Spoon volunteers discour
aged kitchen staff from thinking of
large amounts of waste as a problem.
Instead, there was a sense that it was
okay to have leftovers, because they
wouldn't be thrown away — they'd
go to Spoon.

Taherian says that this attitude is
not in keeping with the mission of
Dining Services to keep costs down
while providing students with top
quality meals. But in trying to adhere
to these goals, Taherian feels Dining
Services has been unfairly criticized.
"We're not evil people." he said.
Taherian likes to see food that
would otherwise be wasted go to peo
ple who need it. He's even taken food
such as fresh lettuce and gallons of
milk — items that Spoon doesn't col
lect — to local churches rather than
throw it away. But he stands behind
Dining Services' new food prepara
tion policy because, as he says, "we
want to get away from a routine of
scheduled Spoon pick-ups, as that
creates an expectation that it's OK to
produce waste."
Ideally, at the end of a meal, there
shouldn't be the kind of leftovers that
can only be thrown away. But if there
is. Taherian says that kitchen man
agers are still free to call Spoon, or
any other charitable organization.
Spoon head coordinator Phoebe
Grow says this option was not dis
cussed with her in a previous meeting
with Taherian. She doubts that the lo
gistics of such an arrangement would
work, and says that scheduled pick
ups are only meant to make the
process of donating food easier on
the dining halls.
Taherian wishes more attention
would be paid to the food waste he
sees coming back on student's trays.
Cirow agrees that food waste by
students is a serious problem, but
feels that despite changes in Dining
Services' cooking methods, there's
still food going to waste.
Spoon and University Dining Ser
vices are currently planning a meet
ing to discuss the new policy. I he out
come will likely affect Spoon's efforts
to alleviate hunger in Palo Alto.
The Urban Ministry will continue
its work even if Spoon can no longer
contribute as much as it used to. ac
cording to Treyster. But that will
mean a decrease in the quality of food
people receive.
"Our program will still be there
without Spoon," he said. "But people
will eat better with Spoon."
