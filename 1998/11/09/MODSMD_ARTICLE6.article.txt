# Holbrooke to talk about Balkan peace
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Richard Holbrooke, U.S. special envoy to Yu
goslavia. is speaking today at 8.(X) p.m. in Kresge Audi
torium. Holbrooke's visit to Stanford was originally
scheduled for last month but was canceled when he was
called to negotiate peace talks in the Balkans.
Holbrooke was the chief U.S. negotiator of the 1995
Dayton peace talks and arrived in Belgrade this year on
Oct. 5 as the United Nations was preparing air strikes
against Serbian forces in Kosovo.
NATO is threatening air strikes in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia where 90 percent of the inhabitants
are ethnic Albanians. Belgrade has come in for wide
spread international criticism as Serbian forces have
launched a brutal attack against the Kosovo Liberation
Army and civilians, looting and destroying towns and
causing more than 25(),(KM) Albanians to flee.
In the midst of this crisis. Holbrooke managed to ne
gotiate a treaty by which Milosevic has agreed to pull
back some forces. To ensure peace, a
team of 2,(XX) human rights activists,
aid workers and civilians will survey
the area to verify that peace agree
ments are being followed.
"Holbrooke is a hell of a negotia
tor in an impossible situation —
This is a problem for which there is
no solution, and if you can do some
thing where less people get killed
that's a plus," said Stephen Krasner,
a professor at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
William Perry, former U.S. Secre
tary of Defense and current profes
sor at lIS, said he agrees with Hol
brooke that only diplomacy backed
by credible force can stop Kosovo
from becoming another humanitari
an tragedy, like Bosnia.
As of Oct. 21. the presence of Ser
bian military personnel had been sig
nificantly reduced so that between
15,(XX) and 35,(XX) Albanians were
able to return home from their
refuge in the freezing mountains.
However, many more refugees re
main.
Holbrooke's peace agreement is
still fragile. NA TO is threatening to
take action if Milosevic does not fol
low through on his side of the deal;
the presence of 2,(XX) unarmed civil
ian monitors may create problems if
the combatants use them as hostages.
Milosevic was not forced to specify
exactly how many soldiers and po
licemen he will pull out of Kosovo,
and critics wonder whether the au

tonomy Milosevic promises will sat
isfy angry Albanians.
Despite the tenuous state of his
peace agreement, the success of Hol
brooke's recent negotiations may
point to promotion. In June, the
Clinton Administration nominated
Holbrooke to be the U.S. represen
tative to the United Nations.
The nomination, however, was
postponed in the Senate after the ad
ministration received an anonymous
letter stating that Holbrooke had ha 4
illegal contacts with State Depart
ment officials while Vice-Chairman
of Credit Suisse First Boston in 19%.
An investigation has since begun.
In light of his recent achievements
in the Balkans and the quick and
thorough defense Holbrooke and his
powerful friends provided, rumors
are spreading in Washington that
Holbrooke's nomination will pass.
Senior lIS Research Fellow Coit
Blacker is optimistic as to what Hol
brooke can bring to U.S. foreign pol
icy. "He's patient, tough, smart, he'll
keep talking as long as it keeps the
guns from starting.... He's an excel
lent appointment." In regards to the
investigation, Blacker said he sus
pects it was politically inspired.
This past year Holbrooke pub
lished a book, "To End a War," on
his experience as chief U.S. negotia
tor at the Dayton talks. The book
tells of how three of the four mem
bers of Holbrooke's negotiating
team were killed in their first attempt
to reach Sarajevo, and gives vivid ac
counts of 24-hour negotiating
/ screaming sessions between Balkan
leaders and Americans.
