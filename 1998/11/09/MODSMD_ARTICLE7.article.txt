# Students upset over characters
## 'Siege' meets protest 
### Tyrone Prather Contributing writer 
Islamic students from Stanford
joined forces with local organizers
as part of a nationwide effort to
protest the portrayal of Arabs and
Muslims in the movie "The Siege,"
which opened Friday at area the
aters.
Student members of the Islamic
Society of Stanford University
handed out leaflets detailing what
they viewed as false stereotypes of
Muslims and Arabs in the film to
moviegoers Friday at the Century
Cinema 16 in Mountain View and
the AMC Mercado 20 in Santa
Clara.
"Moviegoers who may not have
previously known about Islam will
realize that Muslims in America arc
not 'the other,'" said ISSU Presi
dent Salim Yusufali. "This movie
attempts to answer the question,
'Who is a Muslim?' There are two
answers to this question: the Holly

wood answer and the real thing."
The movie, starring Denzel
Washington. Bruce Willis and An
nette Bening, details a rash of ter
rorist attacks on New York City
carried out by members of Arab
and Muslim extremist groups.
The film explores issues of dis
crimination and civil rights, as mar
tial law is declared on the city and
military forces carry out a mass ar
rest of American Muslims and
Arab-Americans in response to the
attacks.
"It's a good movie at its core,"
said Ali Asadullah. Class of '93. "It
sends a powerful message about
civil rights and civil liberties in this
country. However — and this is a
big however — there's a lot of
stereotypes and imagery of Islam
used without a lot of explanation in
the film. It basically links terrorism
to Islam."
Across the country Friday, Mus
lims and Arab-Americans turned
out at theaters, distributing leaflets
and carrying signs, according to the
Associated Press. At the Mercado,
Stanford students were joined by
members of the Muslim Students
Association of Santa Clara Univer
sity.
ISSU members said they would
continue their "informational and
invitational" campaign throughout
the weekend.
" This is a way to filter out truth
from falsehood," said freshman
Randa Serag.
Abdussalam Chouia, head of the
Northern California Council on
American-Islamic Relations, whose
group is organizing the Bay Area
campaign, said the film unfairly ties
the religion of Islam to terrorism.
"The problem is all the charac
ters in the movie that are either
Muslim or Arab are all pure evil.
They are cardboard characters with
no redeeming qualities whatsoev
er."
The producers of the"The

Siege," after meeting with repre
sentatives of Arab and Muslim
groups, re-edited the original trailer
of the film shown in theaters. Direc
tor Edward Zwick, who also co
wrote the film, refused earlier sug
gestions to recast the villains in the
film as American militia groups
rather than Arabs or Muslims, argu
ing that the movie speaks against
prejudice and treats the Islamic
community fairly.
According to Chouia. the movie
portrays even its most positive Is
lamic characters, such a Muslim FBI
agent, in a superficial way.
"Even that person, according to
our views, displays un-Islamic be
havior," Chouia said. "This is the
character that the director argues is
the only good guy in the movie."
Some Stanford students who
planned to see "The Siege" ques
tioned the impact of the leafleting
campaign.
"I think it'll backfire and actually
create more interest in the movie,"
said sophomore David Regelmann.
"It would constrain me to want to
see it more. I guess I could see how it
could trouble them. But it's a Holly
wood film."

Regelmann said he was not
aware of the protest or of the nega
tive portrayals of Muslims and
Arabs described in the ISSU's
leaflets. Still, he planned to see the
movie.
"I don't see how it would make
me not go see it,"he said. "Even if it
were offensive. I would still want to
see it, then I could say, 'Wow, it was
offensive.""
ISSU members said their intent is
not to keep people from seeing the
movie, but to inform ticket buyers
about the film's stereotypes.
"It's okay to see, as long as peo
ple understand it's just a movie,"
said sophomore Narjes Mishergi,
the ISSU's fund-raising commis
sioner. "Basically (the movie] says
Muslims are terrorists. That's the
image ... and I wouldn't be doing
my part if I wasn't here."
Members of the Islamic commu
nity stressed that their campaign is
designed to combat the offensive
nature of "The Siege" and other re
cent films like it.
Local protest organizers have
also invited the public to attend an
open house on Nov. 14 at a mosque
in Santa Clara.
