Poetic nihilism, or the idea
that aesthetic experience is sud
den and temporal, is incompati
ble with politics and theater, Karl
Heinz Bohrer told an audience of
more than 150 last night.
Bohrer, professor of Modern
German Literary History at the
University of Bielefeld in Ger
many, spoke on "Without Fu
ture: What does Poetic Nihilism
mean for Interpretation, The
ater, and State?" as part of the
Presidential Lectures Series.
In his critique of literary schol
arship, Bohrer asked whether the
interpretative disciplines, such as
history or philosophy, can deal
with the literary imagination de
scribed by poetic nihilism.
"Literary scholarship is sub
ject to the nonsense of analogiz
ing. [It has become] closely allied
with the social sciences," Bohrer
said.
