# Aesthetics and social science, politics incompatible in literary, artistic scholarship, says philosopher
## Bohrer speaks about temporal world of art

Poetic nihilism, or the idea
that aesthetic experience is sud
den and temporal, is incompati
ble with politics and theater, Karl
Heinz Bohrer told an audience of
more than 150 last night.
Bohrer, professor of Modern
German Literary History at the
University of Bielefeld in Ger
many, spoke on "Without Fu
ture: What does Poetic Nihilism
mean for Interpretation, The
ater, and State?" as part of the
Presidential Lectures Series.
In his critique of literary schol
arship, Bohrer asked whether the
interpretative disciplines, such as
history or philosophy, can deal
with the literary imagination de
scribed by poetic nihilism.
"Literary scholarship is sub
ject to the nonsense of analogiz
ing. [It has become] closely allied
with the social sciences," Bohrer
said.

German philosopher Karl Heinz Bohrer speaks on the relationship
between art and politics yesterday.
Bohrer argued that poetic ni
hilism. in contrast, is anti-historical
and emphasizes transience instead
of eternity. It rejects continuity and
teleology. These qualities, Bohrer
suggested, resonate with Niet
zsche's description of the
"Dionvsian principle."
Bohrer recalled the three fea
tures of Nietzsche's Dionvsian prin
ciple: abruptness, terror and the dis
solution of the principio ituiividuo

nis, or consciousness.
This dissolution of consciousness
leads to ineffability, or an experi
ence that cannot be communicated,
Bohrer said.
Virginia Woolf questioned
whether or not her encounters with
ineffability revealed a "secret Pla
tonism at work," but she eventually
concluded that the ineffability was
the "self-reference of her own lan
guage," Bohrer said.
It was not until the late Roman
tics, Bohrer said, that artists under
stood that detail only signified itself,
not something higher.

According to Nietzsche, Bohrer
said, the test of intellectual charac
ter was to refuse "historical illu
sions" — the test of poetic nihilism,
then, is for it to not surface in philo
sophical discourse.
"Poetic negativity is opposed to
philosophy. Under the pressure of
institutions, the humanities have no
future as aesthetic scholarship,"
Bohrer said.
"When one speaks of arts and
humanities, one really isn't speaking
of art at all. The concepts of arts and
humanities reside in different dis
courses." he said.
