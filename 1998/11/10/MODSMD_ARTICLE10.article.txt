# Rats, squirrels, spiders, oh my!
## Pests overrun residences; El Nino to blame 
### Julie Chai 
Stanford's on-campus housing
comes with quite a few perks. Many
residences are fully furnished, with
ethernet connections, stylish window
treatments and wall-to-wall carpet
ing.
But some students arrived this
year to find an unwanted extra in
their abodes — rats.
A representative from Stanford's
Housing Facilities and Services sent a
mass e-mail to residents in a number
of dorms and apartments last week
warning that they may be "experi
encing higher than usual problems
with rodents and other pests this
year."
The increase in rodents and pests
— which includes armies of ants, and
scavenging squirrels — can be partly
attributed to El Nino. The rains pro
duced an abundance of food for Stan
ford's furry foes and insect invaders
and, with the year's wet season ap
proaching, "rats, mice, squirrels, ants,
etc. are looking for food and homes,"
the e-mail said.
Brian Burke, a sophomore living
in Yost, arrived this year to find rat
traps throughout his kitchen. And
when he and his roommate went to
sleep at night, they heard rustling in

their rtx)m and later found rat drop
pings on the floor. They contacted
Facilities Operations who gave them
a rat trap, and they were able to evict
their rodent roommate.
The pest problem is a seasonal
concern.
"The weather is changing — the
rain is coming and the little critters
that are outside want to come inside,"
said Chonna Delaney, Zone I) facili
ties manager.
The residences near Lake Laguni
ta are especially attractive to rodents
and pests. As the autumn rains begin
to fill the lake, rodents will head to
ward higher ground.
Kara Dose, a sophomore living in
the Suites, said that she has found
squirrels inhabiting her back porch.
One squirrel was so hungry that it ate
through the lid of an outdoor trash
can to get the goods.
After coming home one day to
find a squirrel sitting on the table.
Dose said she has become particular
ly careful about keeping the doors
closed.
"If the door is open a crack, they
come in," she said.
Justin Wayne confirmed that the
vermin are not shy about inviting
themselves in. Wayne, a sophomore
who lives in the Suites said that he

came home one day to find an unex
pected visitor in his second-floor
suite.
"I walked in and two feet in the
door, there was this squirrel, just
chillin'," said Wayne.
Campus residents were advised in
the e-mail to take extra preventative
measures against uninvited guests.
These measures include keeping
doors and windows closed, making
sure that food and trash do not huild
up and reporting any structural prob
lems such as holes and gaps to Facili
ties.
Peter Ozorio, senior pest control
technician on campus with Crane
Pest Control, said that they use "Inte
grated Pest Management" when re
sponding to complaints about pests.
In the process, technicians first
modify the environment before using
a more extreme method of eradica
tion. "For example, if rats are climb
ing up the ivy and into residences,
they will cut down the ivy. Or if ro
dents are entering residences
through holes in the building, techni
cians will patch the holes," said Ozo
rio.
Using chemicals and pesticides is
a last resort. "With any problem we
approach, we ascertain if it's going to
be a health concern." said Ozorio.
