## Woodside senior 'running' for Stanford admission 
### Amy Reeves 
All of us at Stanford know what it feels like to fill
out a college application and wait helplessly while the
Admission Office determines our fate. One Stanford
hopeful, however, has decided to do more than just
wait.
Tyler MacNiven. a senior at Woodside High
School, launched a "Tyler MacNiven for Stanford Stu
dent 1999" campaign yesterday afternoon in front of
Bowman Alumni House.
He arrived in his old Cadillac painted red with the
Stanford logo on the trunk and a miniature tree em

blem on the roof, surrounded by bullhorns. Eight fel
low Woodside students came along to wear sandwich
boards bearing his likeness and parade the campus.
"I have a deep passion to be here," said MacNiven.
MacNiven has already turned in his application for
early admission, showing an impressive 4.02 GPA, stu
dent body presidency, musical and athletic abilities
and community service work. But he felt that he need
ed to make an additional statement.
"1 don't just propose, I follow through," he said.
"And I always have fun."
After a 'press conference' yesterday, MacNiven
and his followers walked through White Plaza, calling
"Tyler MacNiven for Stanford student" to baffled on
lookers. They stopped by the Old Union, where
Woodside sophomores Kent Markhani and Jessica
Harmon slipped into the Undergraduate Admission
Office and strolled along the sparsely populated hall
way.
Yesterday's activities were only the beginning of a
week-long schedule of parading and leafleting culmi
nating in a tailgate party at the football game on Sat
urday. MacNiven plans to set up a 30-foot tipi in front
of the stadium entrance and hopes to drive his car onto
the field at half-time.
MacNiven emphasized, however, that he doesn't
want to be a pest. "My first rule is, 'Don't make Stan
ford mad,' " he said.
MacNiven's father, Jamis MacNiven, founder of
the Sand Hill Challenge soapbox derby and Tyler's
campaign manager, agreed that this should not be seen
as a "pressure play."
"He has very little chance of getting in," said the
elder MacNiven. citing the tight competition for spots
in next year's class. "But by campaigning he might get
noticed, said MacNiven, "and he'll have fun regard
less."
When asked if he would be embarrassed if he were
rejected after all this publicity, Tyler MacNiven said,
"The word embarrassment is not in the MacNiven vo
cabulary."
"There are good universities, there are great uni
versities, and there's Stanford," he said. "And I'm
equal to the task."
If accepted, MacNiven plans on majoring in — you
guessed it — political science. He makes no bones
about the fact that the White House is in his future
plans. "Truman, Cleveland, Kennedy and Clinton all
said they'd be president in high school," he pointed
out.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Robert Kin
nallv had no comment on MacNiven's activities.
