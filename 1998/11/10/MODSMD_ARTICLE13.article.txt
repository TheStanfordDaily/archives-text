► (AP) — Overwhelmed by disaster,
1 grim-faced Central American lead
* ers gathered Monday to appeal for
more aid in recovering from Hurri
* cane Mitch even as a growing army
j of rescue workers struggled to help
112 hundreds of thousands of victims.
Honduran President Carlos Flo
res Facusse called his country's $4.2
billion debt "unpayable" after one
of the worst natural disasters of this
century in the Americas.
"In 72 hours, we lost what we
had built, little by little, in 50 years,"
he told a news conference following
the summit.
Some European leaders already
were proposing to help, echoing a
plan made last week by former
President Jimmy Carter. French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Monday called for a moratorium on

debt payments owed by countries
hit by Mitch.
German Foreign Minister Josch
ka Fischer also urged that some
debt be forgiven. In addition to the
billions owed by Honduras,
Nicaragua owes $6 billion, mainly to
international lending institutions.
Government and independent
relief organizations from around
the world were trying to rush aid to
tens of thousands in Honduras and
Nicaragua isolated by ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too
few helicopters.
Honduran ambassador to the
United States Edgardo Dumas
Rodriguez said the region "urgently
needs a massive aid program" simi
lar to the Marshall Plan that helped
Europe recover from World War 11.
Hundreds of people swarmed
around three U.S. Army Chinook

helicopters that delivered 32,000
pounds of food and medicines Mon
day to a soccer field in Yoro. about
80 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
The town and surrounding area
of 100,000 people lost electricity,
water and sewer systems to flooding
of the Rio Jalegua. Landslides cut
access to the rest of the country by
land.
"We are suffering in this town.
We are incommunicado," said
farmer Raymundo Reyes. 50, as
dozens of cheering children
mobbed a chopper pilot giving out
gum and candy bars.
Many areas were still receiving
their first aid, more than a week
after the storm disappeared.
Former President George Bush,
visiting the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa, said Sunday that aid
might be needed for years to come.

"The devastation is appalling," he
said.
In Honduras alone, 7(X),(XX) peo
ple will need food for the next
month, U.N. World Food Program
representative Giuseppi Lubatti
estimated.
Canada began sending troops to
the area on Monday. Britain said it
had some 1,400 Royal Navy and
Royal Marines helping with relief
efforts in the region.
In Washington, U.S. Army Sec
retary Louis Caldera said the army
is considering altering the tasks of
some 3.000 National Guard soldiers
scheduled to travel to Honduras
next year. The troops could be used
to help rebuild infrastructure.
U.S. military engineers were
helping repair roads, bridges and
water systems while moving relief
supplies into the country.
