# Court won't shield Lindsey
## Advisor could testify 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
Supreme Court refused on Monday
to shield President Clinton's closest
adviser, Bruce Lindsey, from being
questioned about his conversations
with the president in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. House impeach
ment investigators immediately
weighed whether to call Lindsey.
The justices declined to hear a
White House appeal that Clinton's
conversations with Lindsey should
be protected by attorney-client
privilege, a claim already rejected
by two lower courts.
Lindsey testified four times
before the grand jury investigating
the Lewinsky matter but refused to
answer certain questions, including
those about his conversations with
Clinton, because the president
invoked the privilege.

In a separate case, the high court
ref used to shield Secret Service offi
cers from having to testify in the
Lewinsky case about information
they learned while protecting the
president.Both cases were rejected
by 7-2 votes.
At least 30 Secret Service per
sonnel have already testified in the
Lewinsky probe, making the
Supreme Court action largely moot.
Expressing disappointment, the
White House said Clinton's discus
sions with Lindsey needed to be
confidential because of the threat of
impeachment.
Lindsey's conversations with
Clinton about Ms. Lewinsky started
last December when her name
showed up on a witness list in the
Paula Jones lawsuit accusing Clin
ton of sexual harassment.
