Three-tiered system is most
fair way for all students to
secure preferred housing

THE DRAW MAY still be half a year
away, but that hasn't kept it out of
the news. Potential changes to the
system could revolutionize housing. Unfor
tunately, student interest this time of year is
minimal and is destined to peak only after
Draw numbers are actually released.
Student apathy was evident when a
grand total of six undergraduates attended
a discussion on potential changes to the
Draw on Nov. 4. We all love to gripe about
the Draw, but it seems few really want to do
something to fix it.
If you had attended the meeting, you
would have learned about the three-tiered
proposal. This new set-up would guarantee
every student a "super-preferred" year,
thus reducing the substantial number of stu
dents who never have the luck to live in a
place they really desire. We encourage the
Residential Programs Implementation
Group to adopt and implement this three
tiered system in time for this year's Draw.
Under the three-tiered system, the two
preferred years students are currently guar
anteed would be replaced with one unpre
ferred, one preferred and one super-pre
ferred year.
The super-preferred year would mean a
guaranteed number in the top third, below
I,(XX). In the remaining two years, students
would receive one number between 1,(X)1
and 2.(XX) and another between 2,(X)1 and
3,(XX).
'This system would close the gap
between the lucky and unlucky among us.
Under the present system, the luckiest stu
dents could boast a combined Draw num
ber of 2,(X)2 over three years, while the
unluckiest could garner 7,(XX). The three
tiered approach cuts the potential disparity
to 3,(XX).
The choice of year to draw within a par
ticular tier would be left to each Draw
group. A possible undesirable consequence

could stem from this flexibility. Everyone
might decide, for instance, to save his or her
super-preferred year for senior year, mak
ing it impossible to meet demand and
ensure class diversity in each house. Imag
ine, for instance, the grim prospects of a
Row composed completely of seniors disin
terested in residential programming.
However, this homogeneity would prob
ably not happen. The system as it stands
today could face the same issue of too many
people drawing preferred for their sopho
more and senior years. There has been no
evidence, however, of this occurring.
Further, it is unlikely that seniors in their
super-preferred year would want to live in
the Kairos quint or in 553's cramped one
room doubles.
Luckily, the variety in dorms and houses
with singles will act to disperse upperclass
men throughout the campus. All-freshman
and all-sophomore housing will also take up
the residences least desirable to those draw
ing super-preferred.
RPIG's survey indicates that undergrad
uates are not enthusiastic about major
changes to the priority system. For this rea
son, the transition from the status quo to
the three-tiered system should be immedi
ate and swift. If the three-tiered system
works, it would be best to implement it all
at once so students won't need to worry
about unpredictable changes in number
trends or new rules each year.
Perhaps an improved online notification
would ease the anxiety during the process,
but students are most concerned with the
final results, not the procedure. As dis
cussed at the Nov. 4 housing meeting, a
computer program that provides immedi
ate notification of each student's place
ment relative to those who have already
entered the Draw would be helpful but not
necessary.
Individual and collective concerns about
the Draw abound. Upperclassmen who
have already drawn poorly could stand to
lose out with a change to a three-tiered sys
tem. We encourage those most concerned
to attend the next housing forum sponsored
by the Task Force. By spring, it will be too
late to do anything but complain.
