## Griping about the grapes debate 
### 
LAST WEEK, many
of you participated
in an interesting
campus tradition: the great
grape debate. I remember
three years ago sitting in a
Donner house meeting
and hearing about the

impending vote on whether dining service
should serve "gropes." I had only been at
Stanford for a few months, but I thought of
those busy hands and figured that maybe
Dining Services (or any other campus orga
nization, for that matter) should just stick to
food. Gropes? Thanks, but we're all fine
over here.
Grapes, though, are an entirely different
issue. As you all should know by now, the
"Grape Boycott" (a misnomer that should
read the "Grape Ban") was initiated at the
"request" of students participating in a
hunger strike. This issue was important to
them and they felt it should be important to
the University. They were hungry, and they
thought everyone else should be hungry
too.
So the University, after some delibera
tion, started down the errant path of resi
dential voting to determine which dining
halls would have grapes. While good
natured, this was a poor idea. Stanford has
one singular obligation; to provide a forum
for ideas. Not all of these ideas are right,
and many are unpopular. But nevertheless,
they deserve to be heard. Not everyone will
like what they hear and see, but that's part
of learning.
The educational aspect of the program

was just grape (oh, that's bad), successfully
making people aware of the issue. The vote,
however, was not. Voting for the ban is not
a statement on human rights; it is a state
ment on fascism. The real message is that
we care about this issue and you will too.
The fact is that I would gladly sign a peti
tion supporting the rights of farm workers,
and even make a personal pledge not to eat
grapes until conditions are improved. But
would I force someone else to sign this peti
tion simply because 50 percent plus one
agree? Of course not. Doing so violates the
very idea of a petition. If you agree, you
sign; if not, you don't.
Should you be forced to sign a petition
declaring yourself to be an idiot simply
because half the campus thinks its GPA is
higher than your 10? The inherent unfair
ness of such a system should be apparent.
But maybe this ignores the proper stan
dard. Maybe this is too inclusive; while you
may be an idiot, no one is paying for you to
be an idiot. However, people are paying for
Dining Services to buy grapes.
So it is possible that the standard
employed looks to see where individuals
have a personal stake, namely, where one's
funds are used. But this is a dangerous stan
dard. Hell, by that means, we could and
should vote on which departments receive
funding. And this would eliminate every
major in the humanities because we all
know those majors are entirely useless.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but reading a bunch of
books written a few thousand years ago,
sometimes in other languages, is worthwhile
how? So you can sit around in a black turtle

neck with a matching leather jacket sipping
an Evian to wash down your triple latte? 1
don't think so. Get over yourself. (And with
a single blow, many fewer majors to go — )
The point is that a certain group of stu
dents should not be able to restrict the
actions, thoughts, beliefs, practices or deci
sions — whether unimpeachably correct or
glaringly wrong — of fellow students by a
mere majority vote. Not by the vote of a
super majority. It is simply not within the
University's function.
Should the University curtail its efforts
to educate students on the issue? Of course
not. But instead of a binding vote, con
cerned students should have the option of
telling Dining Services what to buy. And
this need not be done formally, especially
now that food service is on its kick of fiscal
responsibility. If half the students stop eat
ing grapes, half the grapes will be bought.
Coupled with organized letters and cam
paigns, this would carry the same, if not
more, weight than a coercive dorm vote.
But what if this does not work? What if
enough people just don't care and want to
eat grapes anyway?
Well, then that's just the way it goes.
They deserve that right just as much as any
one else.
And there's some food for
thought... well, as long as it's not a grape.

from Hoover Tower.
