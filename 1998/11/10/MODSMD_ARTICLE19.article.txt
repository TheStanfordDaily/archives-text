Arriving early pays off
First, I would like to express my sup
port of Charles Donovan's request for
larger facilities when academic celebrities
come to Stanford. However, I should
point out that this community is not unfa
miliar with competing for limited
seating â€” who can possibly have forgot
ten the men's hoops ticket craze of a few
weeks back? Granted, both situations
were poorly managed to some degree, but
those of us who wanted in knew the num
bers from the start in both cases.
As a general rule, if you want a place,
you get there early. I'm not suggesting that
Maples City be reconstructed in front of
the SEQ Teaching Center (unless there's
foosball, that is). In fact, I arrived less than
one hour before the lecture began and sat
second row dead center, easily part of the
Presidential Lecture Series Sixth Man
Club.(The good Dr. Gould even signed

my Anthro CIV course reader after
wards.)
Moving future lectures to Mem Aud
may indeed solve the seating problem, but
what about the enthusiasm problem? We
here at Stanford have both the best bas
ketball team and the best guest lecturers
in the country. Why don't we care as much
about both?

Freshman, undeclared
Ops needs better debate
In his letter on Nov. 6, Dion Monstavi
cius critiqued Thomas Robertson's Nov. 2
letter. Robertson's call for self-censorship
was right on, however. Just take a look at
what has happened to the opinions page
this year: A columnist publishes a view
point. A reader responds with a complaint
and perhaps a personal attack. A second

columnist responds in her column, anoth
er reader responds and the cycle contin
ues. One has to have read the last week of
Dailies for today's to make any sense at
all.
Monstavicius missed all that, however,
when he decided to ignore substantive
issues and label Robertson an "egoist."
No one needs to read this kind of drivel,
and it goes right to the heart of the matter:
Although we enjoy freedom of speech in
this country, we also have a responsibility
to respect the opinions of others. Let's
stop the pettiness and start using the opin
ions page for its true purpose: the intro
duction of new and different ideas.

Terrorist should not speak
I was distressed to read in the columns

of the Daily on Oct. 23 that the Stanford
Muslim Organisation has invited a speak
er from the Kashmiri All Parties Hurriyat
Conference. The reason for my anguish is
that funds drawn from Stanford students
were used to pay for a extremist / terrorist.
The Kashmiri All Parties Hurriyat Con
ference is nothing more than a front group
that disemmenates the propaganda of, and
collects the funds for Pakistan-trained ter
rorists.
These murderers are no different from
the Taliban, proteges of Bin Laden and
ideological brethren of the World Trade
Center bombers and Hamas. Stanford and
the ASSU have a moral responsibility to
all victims of terrorism and to the student
body at large (including us alums) to
examine how such an individual was
allowed to use its facilities, to examine if
any student funds were donated to the
group and to ensure that such indirect
sponsorship of terrrorism does not recur.

If such an examination is not conducted,
the blood of the many victims of Pakistan
sponsored terrorism in Kashmir will soon
be on the hands of the Stanford student.
