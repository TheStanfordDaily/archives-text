Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy
to Yugoslavia and nominee for
U.S. representative to the United
Nations, spoke at Kresge Auditori
um last night on the importance of
U.S. engagement in world politics.
Since the end of the Cold War in
1992, Holbrooke has sensed a
growing belief in America that
U.S. involvement in foreign affairs
is over.
"After three major wars, paid
for in trillions of dollars and a fear
ful toll of lives, people had
enough," he said.

Holbrooke emphasized, howev
er, that clue to growing economic
globalization and the United
States' responsibility as the world's
only superpower, foreign policy is
more important now more than
ever.
Using his experience negotiat
ing peace in Kosovo this past
month to explain why the United
States cannot isolate itself diplo
matically, Holbrooke stated that
United States has strategic, politi
cal and humanitarian obligations in
world politics.
"It is inexplicable to me that if
we can make a difference, we
should sit back and do nothing and

let people slaughter eaeh other,"
said Holbrooke.
Holbrooke emphasized the ne
cessity of U.S. leadership in Eu
rope in particular, due to the re
gion's inability to create coherent
policy because of vast cultural and
geographical differences.
"The new world comes in to re
dress the problems of the old," said
Holbrooke, alluding to the four
times the United States has inter
vened in Europe during this past
century.
In 1991, European and Ameri
can policy makers agreed that Eu-
ropean powers would handle con
flict in Bosnia.
As more than 250,000 people
were killed between 1991 and
1995, and war ended only after the
United States intervened, Hol
brooke said that he deeply regrets
that the United States did not take
action sooner.
Although it only took three to
four months for the United States
to intervene in Kosovo this past
October — as compared to three
to four years for Bosnia, Hol
brooke still wishes action had
been taken sooner.
Supported by political figures
such as U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Holbrooke
pushed for action last spring, but
Russia's veto in the United Na
tions' Security Council prevented
intervention.
Holbrooke said that the United
Nations' authorization of bomb
ings in Kosovo marked a change in
international policy, legitimizing
the use of military force against
abuses in a sovereign state.
"This is a new precedent for in
ternational relations. History is
being re-written," said Hol
brooke.
The talk was sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
