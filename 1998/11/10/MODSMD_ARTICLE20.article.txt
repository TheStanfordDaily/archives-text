## Finding a fair way to remember a World War

VETERAN'S DAY IN America
isn't exactly a banner holiday.
School kids get the day off, the
American Legion lines the streets with
stars and stripes, hometown papers print
heartwarming stories of infantrymen
reunited some 50 years after they liberated
Bordeaux. The popularity of Robert
Mitchum videos, and this year, "Saving
Private Ryan" enjoy a one-day surge.
The Stanford post office will close, but
students will still sleep through class and
take midterms as they do on any other
Wednesday. Maybe November is too full
of days off; maybe the holiday isn't as
important as Presidents' Day or Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. Maybe we're sup
posed to get our fill of war remembrance in
May with Memorial Day. Or maybe the
University administration realizes that
Americans don't care about mid-week hol
idays.

In France, where "II Faut Sauver le Sol
dat Rvan"' opened to mixed reviews a
month ago, Nov. 11 is still important. With
no Thanksgiving and a weak-at-best obser
vance of Halloween, Armistice Day is the
only real French celebration between
Bastille Day (July 14) and Christmas.
Don't be fooled: Tomorrow, all of
France will not turn out for military
parades or rush to lay flowers on the
graves of fallen soldiers. The country will
shut down for the day, prestigious universi
ties included, but those students on break
will be in no hurry to hear their grandfa
thers talk about fighting with de Gaulle.
There is a strong movement here, especial
ly among the young, to leave war memo
ries where they "belong": in the past.
The paradox is striking. On one side of
the Atlantic, where World War II is still a
large source of national pride, bordering
on obsession, Nov. 11 is a second-tier holi

day recognized less and less each year. On
the other side, where people would just as
soon forget that German troops ever
marched under the Arc de Triomphe, it's
the most celebrated day of the autumn.
My French friends are amazed at that
American desire to cling to wartime mem
ories. "I saw an American on a subway
once, obviously a veteran," a 19-year-old
French university student told me last
month. "He asked me a question, and I
answered him and started to walk away.
He was offended, like he deserved some
sort of respect or a thank you for some
thing that he did 50 years ago. I don't owe
him anything like that."
That attitude runs directly against the
lessons of my rural Oregon childhood. I
grew up respecting my grandfathers and
the men who acted as surrogate grandfa
thers when mine were gone serving in
World War 11. I never missed a chance to

hear their stories.
I saw "Saving Private Ryan" this sum
mer in a small northern California town
with my younger brother, his girlfriend and
a theater full of retirees. 1 nearly cried in
the first 10 minutes of the film, before the
battle scenes even started, just looking at
the rows of stars and crosses in the Ameri
can Cemetery at Normandy. When it was
over I wanted to stand at the door and
shake the hand of every 70-year-old who
passed.
Perhaps the French youth who are so
eager to forget the war would benefit from
a mandatory screening of the movie and a
field trip to Omaha beach. Maybe then
they might see that the debt the world
owes to the men buried under those stars
and crosses is one that can never be repaid.
And perhaps it's time for young Ameri
ca to move on. Our grandparents, and even
our parents, are too tied by personal expe

rience to let go of the great wars. But ours
is the first U.S. generation this century not
to come of age under the shadow of a draft.
The end of the Cold War and economic
union in Europe make the prospects of
another globalized conflict unlikely. Are
we holding on to history, like we always
say, to avoid repeating it? Or are we just
feeding our national ego?
At the moment, we're all hypocrites.
The Americans revere their war heroes but'
won't grant them a day of work or classes
because the month is too full of holidays,*
or the time off can't always be worked into
a three-day weekend. The French glorify a
day of remembrance for events they would
rather forget. And we all owe "them"
something.
