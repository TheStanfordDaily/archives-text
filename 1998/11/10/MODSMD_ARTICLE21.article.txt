## Just a bit outside Redshirting for the sake of the future 
###

When Kyle Logan realized
how much work it would be
to learn all that the 12 returning
members of last year's Final Four
men's basketball team already
knew, he must have been terri
fied.
Or so one would expect.
While the Stanford rookie is
the only member of the team born
in the 1980s, Logan conducts him
self with the poise of a veteran. A
tad soft-spoken, it appears as if he
thinks each thought out with care
ful planning before articulating it.
So he must have been thinking
about this one for a while.

"It was my decision and I went
up to the coaches and told them I
was thinking about it," Logan said
on the possibility of redshirting
this season.
It's hard to imagine wanting to
sit out a season in which Stanford
is not only ranked the highest in
the Cardinal's history, but also re
ceiving an abundance of national
attention.
But it makes sense.
"I feel like I am playing a lot of
catch-up," said Logan, who will
make his final decision by Satur
day's season opener with UC-
Davis.
By sitting out this year, Logan
would not only reserve his four
years of eligibility, but he would
also be able to work hard in the
weight room, run extra drills be
fore and after practice and still
have the 12 veterans peering over
his shoulder.
"The guys are real person
able," he said. "A lot of the older
guys have helped me adjust to this
whole new setting."
Adjusting to new settings,
however, is nothing new for the
Maryland native.

After averaging 21 points per
game during his junior year at St.
Maria Goretti High School in
Hagerstown, Md., Logan trans
ferred to Mercersburg Academy
in Pennsylvania for his senior sea
son. He found himself in a new
state and on a new team where he
was once again forced to learn
how things work. And he found
himself gaining all-state honors.
"It takes time," he said. "When
I went into my senior year of high
school. I had to make an adjust
ment. I just have to do the same
thing here."
He pauses and contemplates.
"I'm pretty confident that
sometime soon I'll come around."
According to Stanford's stu
dent section, however, Logan is
already here.
In the middle of Cardinal
Chaos, Stanford's version of Mid
night Madness, Logan had the
crowd on its feet with spectacular
dunks from the free-throw line
and cheesy smiles from halfcourt.
On Friday, they chanted his
name in an effort to get head
coach Mike Montgomery to put
him in the game.
Logan, however, didn't want to
take that chance. With playing in
but one game, even an exhibition,
needed to remove any possibility
of redshirting. he would not have
his decision made for him prema
turely.
"He came up to me and said,
'Coach, I just feel so lost out
there.' " Montgomery said. "I
know for a fact that every fresh
man in that locker room felt that
same way at one point. There's
just so much stuff being thrown at
him right now.
"It's paralysis by analysis," he
added.
Sitting the year out. however,
might make more work for
Logan, while relieving the pres
sure and allowing for improve
ment.
"When you are relaxed, you
play better," he said. "Redshirting
would be rigorous [but] it is some
thing I want. I want to improve."


Brian
Eule
While he says he has adjusted to
the academic intensity of Stanford,
there is still something to be said
for a freshman on a varsity sport.
"I feel like a regular student but
with [a limited amount of time) I
can dedicate. 1 guess it is like any
student-athlete."
Hearing Stanford's Sixth Man
section chant, "We want Logan,"
on Friday brought a smile to my
face. The kid has character. He is
quick and has enormous potential
to be a basketball star.
The Sixth Man section already
has Logan, and if he makes this de
cision, it can have him for four
more years.

Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly columns appear on Dies
days, attempted to redshirt at the
Daily. Too hail nobody is chanting
"We want Eule."
