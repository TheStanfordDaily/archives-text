## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
With four Cardinal players
among the eight quarterfinalists,
the Stanford women's tennis team
seemed primed to dominate the
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion Regional Championships this
weekend.
Only freshman Marissa Irvin
managed to make it past the quar
terfinal round, however, and even
she was stopped by the eventual
champion, sophomore Anita
Kurimay of California, in the
semifinals.
While the team displayed its
depth at the rain-plagued tourna
ment, much of which took place at
Taube Tennis Center's sole in
door court, the Cardinal failed to
walk away with a winner's trophy.
Nonetheless, both head coach
Frank Brennan and the Cardinal
women were proud of the week
end's results.
"We didn't set the world on
fire, but I'm happy with it." said
Brennan. "1 got to see the fresh
men play, and they really im
pressed me. It's a real learning
time right now."
After all. the ITA Champi
onships is only the second tourna
ment of the year. In addition,
many members of Stanford's
young squad had never played a
collegiate match before.

One such newcomer, freshman
Keiko Tokuda, took advantage of
the opportunity. Tokuda
squashed her first opponent, 6-1,
6-1, enjoyed a walkover in the sec
ond round, posted another 6-1, 6-
1 victory in the third round and
upended 12th-seed Claire Curran
of Cal in three sets before falling
to Kurimay, 6-2, 7-6 (7-0), in the
quarterfinals.
"I definitely had nothing to
lose," said Tokuda, who had been
recovering from an illness for sev
eral weeks, "It was just so much
fun to have people cheering for
you. I was really excited for each
match."
Freshman and 14th-seed Lau
ren Kalvaria also made an impres
sion. winning three rounds before
bowing out in the fourth round to
fourth-seed Kristina Kraszewski
of Washington, 6-2, 6-2.
"The support was great." said
Kalvaria. "There were a lot of
people from my dorm. I could've
played better. Then again, it's my
first college tournament."
Freshman Gabriela Lastra was
not about to be overshadowed by
classmates Irvin, Tokuda and
Kalvaria. In reaching the quarter
finals, Lastra, the 16th seed, re
ceived a bye in the first round,
proceeded to lose a mere two
games in her next two matches
