## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
With four Cardinal players
among the eight quarterfinalists,
the Stanford women's tennis team
seemed primed to dominate the
Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion Regional Championships this
weekend.
Only freshman Marissa Irvin
managed to make it past the quar
terfinal round, however, and even
she was stopped by the eventual
champion, sophomore Anita
Kurimay of California, in the
semifinals.
While the team displayed its
depth at the rain-plagued tourna
ment, much of which took place at
Taube Tennis Center's sole in
door court, the Cardinal failed to
walk away with a winner's trophy.
Nonetheless, both head coach
Frank Brennan and the Cardinal
women were proud of the week
end's results.
"We didn't set the world on
fire, but I'm happy with it." said
Brennan. "1 got to see the fresh
men play, and they really im
pressed me. It's a real learning
time right now."
After all. the ITA Champi
onships is only the second tourna
ment of the year. In addition,
many members of Stanford's
young squad had never played a
collegiate match before.

One such newcomer, freshman
Keiko Tokuda, took advantage of
the opportunity. Tokuda
squashed her first opponent, 6-1,
6-1, enjoyed a walkover in the sec
ond round, posted another 6-1, 6-
1 victory in the third round and
upended 12th-seed Claire Curran
of Cal in three sets before falling
to Kurimay, 6-2, 7-6 (7-0), in the
quarterfinals.
"I definitely had nothing to
lose," said Tokuda, who had been
recovering from an illness for sev
eral weeks, "It was just so much
fun to have people cheering for
you. I was really excited for each
match."
Freshman and 14th-seed Lau
ren Kalvaria also made an impres
sion. winning three rounds before
bowing out in the fourth round to
fourth-seed Kristina Kraszewski
of Washington, 6-2, 6-2.
"The support was great." said
Kalvaria. "There were a lot of
people from my dorm. I could've
played better. Then again, it's my
first college tournament."
Freshman Gabriela Lastra was
not about to be overshadowed by
classmates Irvin, Tokuda and
Kalvaria. In reaching the quarter
finals, Lastra, the 16th seed, re
ceived a bye in the first round,
proceeded to lose a mere two
games in her next two matches
and stunned top-seed Amanda
Augustus of Cal, 6-3, 7-6 (14-12),
in the fourth round.
"I'm really excited about the
way she's playing," said Brennan.
"She has a great temperament
and is a great athlete."
While the freshmen made the
most notable impact on the draw,
the veterans didn't disappoint. Ju
niors Teryn Ashley and Jennifer
Heiser, along with sophomore
Julia Sherbakov, all posted strong
results.
Sophomore Sarah Pestieau,
feeling unwell most of the week
end, bowed out in the second
round.
Brennan was pleased with
Sherbakov's showing. In her first
year as a starter, Sherbakov
fought through to the third round
in both singles and doubles.
"It's a great showing for her,"
said Brennan. "Her hard work is

paying off."
The most thrilling match of the
tournament was the Kurimay-
Irvin semifinal, a three-set tussle
featuring Irvin's powerful
groundies against Kurimay's
quiek feet and crafty slice hack
hand. Kurimay prevailed, 6-4,6-7,
6-4, and claimed her third Stan
ford scalp in a row. having beaten
Tokuda and Ashley in the previ
ous two rounds.
"She's very good," said Kuri
may of Irvin. "I was up in the sec
ond set. I nearly choked. I was
very happy to come back in the
third."
Kurimay then beat teammate
Karoline Borgerson, 6-4. 6-2, in
the final. Cal also produced both
finalist doubles teams.
"This may be Cal's best team
ever," said Brennan. "We've
done well with them in the past,
but they're a worthy adversary.
They had a great showing this
tournament, but it's a long time
until March when we play them
again."
