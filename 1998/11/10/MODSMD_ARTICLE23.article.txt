# Women's golf fourth at tourney
## Cardinal reaches as high as second place on board before falling back into pack of strong competition 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
Two days gave out a glimmer of
hope for victory for the Stanford
women's golf team, but as the third
day of the Golf World / Palmetto
Dunes Invitational came to a close,
the hope faded.
The No. 7 Cardinal held second
place for two days behind No. 4 USC
before falling to fourth on the last day
of the tournament in Hilton Head,
S.C., at the par-72 Arthur Hills Golf
Course.
At the end of the event, Stanford
was in good company in the top five,
behind No. 2 Arizona in first place,
USC and No. 1 Duke, who beat the
Cardinal by only one stroke. Fifth
ranked Tulsa rounded out the top
five, finishing one stroke behind
Stanford.
"You can't let the fourth-place
finish deceive you," said head coach
Caroline O'Connor. "It was an unbe
lievably close tournament: there
were five teams within four strokes of
each other. We had a great score for
that course."
Sophomore Hilary Homeyer, one
of Stanford's best golfers, was the
Cardinal's top finisher at the tourna
ment, placing 10th with a three-day
total of a seven-over-par 223. Sopho
more Stephanie Keever tied for 13th
(225). Also scoring for Stanford was
junior Jae Jean Ro who tied for 15th
with a 10-over-par 226, sophomore
Jessica Belskis in 27th place (230) and
senior Michelle Sperrv at 35th with a
16-over-par 232.
Last year's champion, Arizona's
Krissie Register, ended up in a four
way tie for sixth. Jennifer Rosales of
USC. Pacific 10 Conference champi
on from 1997. triumphed in the event
with two-under par 214.
This tournament hosted the best
teams from both the East and the
West Coasts. This gave the Cardinal a
chance to see how it fared against
some of the most competitive colle
giate golf teams in the country. Stan
ford has not had many opportunities
to compete against Eastern teams,
the teams that will be challenging
Stanford and the rest of the Pac-10 at
the NCAA Championships in Tulsa,
Okla.
Of the five Eastern collegiate

teams that were at the tournament,
Stanford triumphed over four of
them.
"We were beaten by Duke and
they are a very strong Eastern team,"
said Homeyer. "At the top of the
tournament were the teams from the
West and we played well against
them again. [The tournament] was a
good way to see different competi
tion."
The glimmer of hope that the
team saw during the first two days of
this past tournament can now carry
over into the rest of the season, show
ing the Cardinal that it is even closer
to its goal of winning May's NCAAs.

"There are legitimately five or six
teams that have the possibility of win
ning Nationals and we are one of
those teams," O'Connor said.
The possibility of an NCAA title
"looks better now at this point in the
season than it did when we started
off," Sperry said. "We peak late,
which is good because it gives us the
confidence that we can beat some of
the teams we saw at this tourna
ment."
The glimmer of hope for an
NCAA Championship must be
nursed for the next three months as
this tournament was the last one for
the team until February. The Cardi
nal is going to take some time off to
relax. When it resumes practice, the
team will review stats, make any nec
essary swing changes and work on its
short game.
"We will work on any swing
changes now. so we don't have to
worry about it affecting our play,"
Homeyer said. "What we really need
to improve on is our consistency."
The way for the team to be more
consistent in its level of competitive
play is to keep a positive frame of
mind and continually improve on its
game.
"We can stay consistent by keep
ing confidence throughout the tour
nament." Sperry said. "We have to
believe in ourselves every single day
and on every single hole."
