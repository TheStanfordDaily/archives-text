# Repatriation, education among concerns to be considered
## Native American events kick off 
### Rebecca Sullivan 
As part of a program to promote
awareness of Native American is
sues at Stanford, several groups are
sponsoring educational discussions
and events.
One of the current local issues is
"repatriation," or the re-burial of In
dian remains that have been re
moved from their original sites.
Winona Simms, program director of
the Native American Cultural Cen
ter on campus described it as a "very
serious ceremonial event,"and

added that, despite the rather small
size of the Ohlone community near
Stanford, "they really want to do this
properly."
Denni Woodward, assistant di
rector of the center, demonstrated
the continuing relevance of repatria
tion negotiations. Construction
around Stanford has dislocated re
mains that were buried as recently as
the 19305. "This could be your
grandmother.... It's pretty emo
tional when you stop and think ...
when they bulldoze in the name of
expansion and building."

Campus archaeologist Laura
Jones will speak about Ohlone repa
triation Wednesday at noon at the
Native American Cultural Center.
Students are faced with other
concerns regarding their cultural
heritage.
To many Native Americans, "ed
ucation means assimilation," said ju
nior Lanita Matthew. Hut in fact, she
added, "we are still maintaining our
cultural heritage," even with de
grees of assimilation.
Simms said she frequently re
ceives calls from people in the Stan

ford community, asking "interesting
questions about Indians."
"I was surprised to know that the
community is interested to know
what we're doing," she said.
There are other activities
planned to educate and entertain
participants, including a discussion
of the "Pan-American Indian Move
ment," to he held tonight at Muwek
ma-Tah-Ruk, the Native American
theme house, and a Friday night
field trip to San Francisco's Palace of
Fine Arts for a presentation of Na
tive American film and video.
