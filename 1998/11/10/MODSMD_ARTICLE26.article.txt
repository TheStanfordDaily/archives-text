# Senior Class seeks unity on Web site
## 
### Anne Becker 
Last week, officers of the Class of
1999 launched the first official Se
nior Class Web site, in collaboration
with the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
The creators intend the site to
consolidate information pertaining
to the senior class to increase senior
class unity. It features a "Class of '99
Events Calendar" to keep seniors
informed of class activities, and pro
vides a link to e-mail the Senior
Class presidents.
Additionally, it contains a list of
ways for seniors to help with plan
ning class events, and a "networking
opportunities" link that connects to
the Stanford Career Network, Ca
reer Development Center, Job
Track and other career sources.
"I want people to really find this
site useful as a supplement to the e
mails that the class presidents
send," said Senior Class president
Nate Brown. "I want people to
bookmark this site."
Brown thought to create the site
over the summer and consulted
with senior Karlyn Adams, who vol
unteered to write the code for the
site.
"Throughout my four years at
Stanford, I felt like there was a lack
of communication." Adams said.
"There would be events, and I'd
find out a week later. I thought 1
could be a part of doing something
about it."
To encourage communication
within the Senior Class, the site fea
tures links which allow seniors to
suggest commencement speakers,
and senior gilt ideas, and post pic
tures of "senior life."
Though last year's Senior Class
tried to set up a Web site, this is the
first one to be affiliated with the
Alumni Association. The associa
tion has provided technical sup

port. Brown, however, did not be
lieve this affiliation was a direct re
sult of the Alumni Association's
merger with the University in Sep
tember.
"Working with the Alumni As
sociation is a good way to let stu
dents know it's out there and to start
the connection early on," Adams
said.
In an effort to promote the site,
Brown and the other Senior Class
presidents sent e-mails to the Class
of 1999. They also hope students
will hear of it through word of
mouth.
Seniors who have begun to visit
the site have had generally positive
reactions.
"It's nice that there's now one
place where you can consistently
find information on senior events
and other information pertinent to
the senior class," said senior Ted
Leng.
Senior Tushar Ranchod agreed,
but expressed concern over
whether seniors would actually visit
the site. "Some of the ideas are real
ly cool, but I'm a little skeptical that
it will succeed," he said. "It is diffi
cult to make a Web site people will
visit on a regular basis."
Both Adams and Brown assert
ed that the site was still in its prelim
inary stages and asked that seniors
get involved in improving it. They
hope to increase awareness of the
site through features such as "Se
nior Focus" which, each week, puts
the spotlight on a senior who has
made a significant contribution to
the class or the University as a
whole.
All work on the site, so far, has
been voluntary. Any future finan
cial support will be provided by the
Stanford Alumni Association.
The site's address is http://sun
site 1 .dc.stanford.org/SOLAR/Page
