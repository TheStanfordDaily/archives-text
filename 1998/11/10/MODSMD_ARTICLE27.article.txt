# Students talk filmmaking
## New film workshop targets undergraduates 
### Julia Beeson Contributing writer 
While some students' only expo
sure to film is their weekly outing to
Flicks, new efforts from the Stan
ford Film Society are trying to give
them a somewhat wider perspec
tive.
A new workshop will provide
undergraduates with a forum to dis
cuss, present and learn about a vari
ety of film-related interests.
The workshop agenda is still in
the planning stages and open to stu
dent suggestion. Proposed areas of
study include cinematography,
screenwriting, film theory, criticism
and history and production.
Sophomore Beth Robinowitz,
co-president of the Stanford Film
Society, has been working to estab
lish the workshop, which will pro
vide undergraduates with a "less es
oteric, and more participation
based" understanding of film.
Robinowitz said that the work
shop is a response to the graduate
workshops already offered on cam
pus.
"Currently, there is no under
graduate film program in which stu
dents with different experiences
and interests in film can come to
gether and share their knowledge
and learn from other students,
while gaining hands-on experience
in various aspects of film," said
Robinowitz.
The workshop will be held every
Friday, alternating between an in
formal and formal setting.
The formal meetings will consist
of presentations by professors,
graduate and undergraduate stu

dents and alumni on a specific area
of interest in film. In addition, the
workshops will offer exercises in
different aspects of film such as
screenwriting and field trips.
According to Robinowitz, Asst.
Art Prof. Scott Bukatman, who
teaches Art 140, the introductory
film studies course, will be among
the featured speakers. Graduate
students from the documentary film
program will also be invited to
speak on various film-related top
ics, as will Stanford alumni in the
entertainment industry.
The field trip component of the
workshop is intended to give stu
dents technical, hands-on experi
ence in film.
One tentative outing is to the
Aquarius Theater in downtown
Palo Alto for a first-hand lesson in
professional film projection equip
ment.
The informal meetings will give
students a chance to view films and
discuss them in a comfortable set
ting.
Students are also encouraged to
break off into smaller groups within
the workshop setting, so that those
with shared interests in film can
focus on a specific topic and learn
from one another.
Junior Pauline Samson likes the
"student-directed" agenda of the
workshop. "The idea of a complete
ly undergraduate-driven workshop
that caters to such a wide spectrum
of interests and activities within
film is very appealing," Samson
said.
She also anticipates a comfort
able, relaxed workshop atmosphere
in which students will not feel in

timidated, but free to "share their
diverse interests and opinions with
other film aficionados."
The workshop will be funded by
the Film Society, which provides
opportunities for film screenings
and film-related discussions. The
Film Society believes that film not
only moves individuals emotional
ly, but also alters everyday lives as
an impetus for the study and criti
cism of history and society.
The Film Society Website serves
as a forum for discussion on film-re
lated issues. Students can post film
related questions and receive an
swers, and announce upcoming film
events on campus and in the Bay
Area, such as film screenings, festi
vals and lectures by industry profes
sionals.
The Film Society recently co
hosted the United Nations Film
Festival on campus, an event that
few undergraduates attended.
Through the workshop, Robi
nowitz wants to have greater under
graduate awareness and involve
ment in the film culture at Stanford.
She also stresses the importance
of having a diverse understanding
and appreciation of film for those
who envision a future career in the
film industry.
Any undergraduates interested
in the workshop are encouraged to
attend the Friday meetings at 4 p.m.
in Room 2 of the Cummings Art
Building. And students are encour
aged to join the Stanford Film Soci
ety at their Sunday meetings at
noon in the Xanadu lounge or visit

mation.
