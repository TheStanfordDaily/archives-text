# No. 19 women breeze past Sweden
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team beat Sweden 94-65 last
night in an exhibition match at
Maples Pavilion despite a heartfelt
performance by former Stanford
standout Molly Goodenbour.
It was fitting that Goodenbour,
still wearing the No. 3 — the same
number she played with when she
played for Stanford — led Sweden
with 19 points, 12 of which came
from 3-pointers. Goodenbour grad
uated in 1993 and was an integral
part of winning national champi
onships in 1992 and 1990.
"We played well," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer, in her 13th
season on the Farm. "We're trying a
new offense so it's good to get the
game experience."
Sweden grabbed an early 8-2
lead but was unable to hold on to
any sort of advantage for the dura
tion of the game. At the half, the
score was 59-37.
Even though the intensity pe
tered off during the second half,
Stanford still maintained at least a
2()-point lead over Sweden the en
tire game. At its highest point, with
7:35 left in the second half, the Car
dinal led by 30 points.
A sweet surprise addition to the
starting line-up was highly touted
freshman Lindsey Yamasaki, who
played for 23 minutes. Yamasaki
tore the lateral meniscus in her right
knee in practice on Oct. 22 and had
missed Stanford's first exhibition

game against the Armed Forces.
She played with confidence and
chalked up seven points and six re
bounds.
"It was great having Lindsay
back," said VanDerveer. "For only
having practiced three times, she did
very well. It was good for her to get
in the flow and play with the other
people."
Sophomore Carolyn Moos con
trolled the post and proved she will
be a force to be reckoned with this
season. She ended the game with a
team-high 24 points, 10 rebounds
and one block.

"We played much better than
last week," said Moos. "We had
only four turnovers in the first half,
which made a huge difference and
we slowed it down."
Moos was aided by teammates
sophomore Sarah Dimson, fresh
man Lauren St. Clair and sopho
more Karesa Granderson, all of
whom scored in double figures.
Senior Regan Freuen suited up
and went through warm-ups with
the team and is expected back for
Friday's game against Arkansas.
Freuen sprained her foot on Oct. 22
and has made a speedy recovery.
Freshman center Cori Enghusen sat
out after suffering a knee injury on
Saturday. The extent of her injury is
unknown. She will have an MRI
today.
