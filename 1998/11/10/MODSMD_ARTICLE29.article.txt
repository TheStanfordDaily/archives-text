# No. 3 Card ready for last exhibition
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Upon hearing the name
Marathon Oil, one is more likely
to think of a Texas petroleum
franchise, not of a competitive
men's basketball team.
But a name is just a name, and
Marathon is in fact a talented
group of former college players
with professional basketball aspi
rations. The touring team will
bring its show to Maples Pavilion
to face No. 3 Stanford tonight at
7:30.
Tonight's game, the final pre
season warmup for the Cardinal,
figures to be another easy win for
Stanford.
True to form, however, the
Cardinal is not expecting anything
to come easily, and will treat
tonight's exhibition with the inten
sity of a regular-season game.
"I expect them to be a good
team," said senior point guard Art
Lee. "We are going to treat this as
a normal game. We have to go out
there and play good defense, and
execute on the offensive end. This
is just a good opportunity for us to
see where we are at this point."
In its first exhibition game,
against Taiwan, Stanford's bal
anced attack was led by junior for
ward Mark Madsen, who scored
14 points and grabbed eight re
bounds.

Madsen was recently named to
Dick Vitale's preseason "All-
Rambo Team," recognizing his
unparalleled hustle and leader
ship.
Heading into tonight's game,
the 6-foot-9 forward is primed to
lead Stanford into a legitimate test
that will feature a back-and-forth
style of play.

"I definitely expect it to be a
game," Madsen said. "I am sure
we will play a lot of guys, and it will
be up and down. We don't know
much about them, but you can bet
it will be high-scoring."
The Cardinal put 83 points on
the scoreboard on Friday in its
domination of the Taiwan Nation
al team, and will almost certainly
put up similar numbers tonight.
Redshirt freshman Jason
Collins has been the pleasant sur
prise of the preseason, returning
from the knee injury that kept him
sidelined all last season and having
an immediate impact on the Car
dinal offense.
Collins and his Stanford team
mates should have no trouble fin
ishing the preseason tonight on a
high note — just as long as
Marathon Oil doesn't catch fire.
