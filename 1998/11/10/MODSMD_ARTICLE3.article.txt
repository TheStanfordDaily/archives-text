# Voter turnout low
## Democrats dominated in Stanford campus voting; tallies show 6 to 1 margin for Davis 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
The victors have been decided
and the losers have gone home. An
other general election in California
has come and gone and yet again,
Stanford students' attendance at
University polling places has been
dismal.
In results obtained from the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters office, only 36 percent of reg
istered voters on campus voted at a
Stanford polling site for governor in
last Tuesday's election.
Of those who voted. 77 percent
voted for Democrat Gray Davis and
13 percent voted for Republican
Dan Lungren.
In the 14th Congressional Dis
trict election, SI percent voted for
incumbent Democrat Anna Eshoo
compared with 12 percent for her
opponent, Republican Chris Hau
gen.
The results from the Barbara

Boxer — Matt Fong senatorial race
were unavailable.
"We'd like to emphasize the low
voter turnout across the board," said
Elma Rosas-Martinez, a spokes
woman for the Registrar's Office.
Precincts on campus averaged a
49 percent voter participation rate in
the last 1996 general election.
Turnout tends to be higher in presi
dential elections such as that of 1996.
Nationally, 72 percent of college
students registered to vote and of
those, 48 percent voted, according to
the National Student Campaign for
Voter Registration.
Turnout among all registered
voters in the country was a mere 36
percent.
"Your political persuasion
doesn't matter," said ASSU Presi
dent Maren Norton earlier this year.
"That you're voting is key."
Over the past several weeks, a
number of campus organizations
have taken it upon themselves to get
students to the polls. Among these

groups are Stanford in Government,
Stanford Democrats, Stanford Re
publicans and Campus Green Vote.
"Each group [had] its own agen
da, but we [were] all working togeth
er to register students as a whole,"
said Leila Salazar, Campus Green
Vote field organizer.
Salazar said that Campus Green
Vote "led strong 'get out the vote'
efforts." Students were encouraged
by groups through phone calls,
posters, door hangers, Internet post
cards and e-mail reminders to vote.
Those groups, concedes Salazar,
were fighting an uphill battle be
cause so many Stanford students
who voted did so in their home states
with absentee ballots, instead of
changing their registration.
"We [did] encourage students
vote locally as most students will be
living here for the next four years,"
said Salazar.
The participation this year was
not surprising to University students.
"I'm not surprised by the low
voter turnout this year," said Steven
Macias, director of Stanford De
mocrats. "I was here in 19%, and
there was much more excitement
about the election. I would expect
something similar in 2(XX)."
Rvan Parks, director of Stanford
College Republicans, agreed.
"There was a low voter turnout be
cause neither party really gave peo
ple a reason to vote."
Others view the election in a dif
ferent light.
" Thirty-six percent is not a bad
turnout for a midterm election," said
Krista Glaser, a sophomore and di
rector of communications for Stan
ford Democrats. "I know that's kind
of pathetic, but that's the reality
we're forced to accept."
The future of elections is not
bleak, however.
Under recently passed amend
ments to the Higher Education Act,
colleges and universities will be re
quired to distribute voter registra
tion forms to each of their students,
beginning with the presidential elec
tion in 2(XX).

According to the National Stu
dent Campaign for Voter Registra
tion, this new law will potentially de
liver more than 15 million voter reg
istration forms to students during
the fall of 2(XX). This, in their opin
ion, will lead "to greater student
voter registration and will increase
the likelihood of record student
voter turnout during what is expect
ed to be a hotly contested election."
In an election night poll of college
students around the nation conduct
ed by the National Student Cam
paign for Voter Registration, stu
dents cited "education" and "finan
cial aid" as their top issues. Taxes,
abortion and the environment also
ranked high in the poll.
Of those who participated in the
poll, 26 percent felt that candidates
adequately and 48 percent some
what adequately addressed the is
sues of greatest concern to students.
Eighty-one percent said that their
vote was not affected by the events
involving President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky.
Senior Elizabeth Pianca, chair of
Stanford in Government, comment
ed on efforts increase student voting.
"Stanford in Government has al
ways worked on voter registration,"
she said. "It should be a collabora
tive effort."
