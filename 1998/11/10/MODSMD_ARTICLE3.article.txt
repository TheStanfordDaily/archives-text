# Voter turnout low
## Democrats dominated in Stanford campus voting; tallies show 6 to 1 margin for Davis

The victors have been decided
and the losers have gone home. An
other general election in California
has come and gone and yet again,
Stanford students' attendance at
University polling places has been
dismal.
In results obtained from the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters office, only 36 percent of reg
istered voters on campus voted at a
Stanford polling site for governor in
last Tuesday's election.
Of those who voted. 77 percent
voted for Democrat Gray Davis and
13 percent voted for Republican
Dan Lungren.
In the 14th Congressional Dis
trict election, SI percent voted for
incumbent Democrat Anna Eshoo
compared with 12 percent for her
opponent, Republican Chris Hau

The results from the Barbara

Boxer â€” Matt Fong senatorial race
were unavailable.
"We'd like to emphasize the low

Elma Rosas-Martinez, a spokes

Nationally, 72 percent of college
students registered to vote and of
those, 48 percent voted, according to
the National Student Campaign for
Voter Registration.
Turnout among all registered
voters in the country was a mere 36
percent.

"That you're voting is key."
Over the past several weeks, a
number of campus organizations
have taken it upon themselves to get
students to the polls. Among these

groups are Stanford in Government,
Stanford Democrats, Stanford Re
publicans and Campus Green Vote.
"Each group [had] its own agen
da, but we [were] all working togeth
er to register students as a whole,"
said Leila Salazar, Campus Green
Vote field organizer.
Salazar said that Campus Green
Vote "led strong 'get out the vote'
efforts." Students were encouraged
by groups through phone calls,
posters, door hangers, Internet post
cards and e-mail reminders to vote.
Those groups, concedes Salazar,
were fighting an uphill battle be
cause so many Stanford students
who voted did so in their home states
with absentee ballots, instead of
changing their registration.
"We [did] encourage students
vote locally as most students will be
living here for the next four years,"
said Salazar.
The participation this year was
