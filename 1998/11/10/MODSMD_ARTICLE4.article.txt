# Grad housing finalized
## 200 units by 2000, rest by '01, says admin 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Stanford will have only 2(H) of its
480 new graduate student housing
units ready for the fall of 2(XX). The
remaining units will be ready the fol
lowing fall.
To compensate for the lost
spaces, the University will maintain
its current leases on 150 apartments
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park
through the 2000-'Ol school year.
"It was a question of feasibility,"
said Tom Wasow, associate dean of
graduate policy. "The contractor
told us that getting them all up by
2000 wasn't realistic."
The contractors Stanford hired
to complete the project told the
University that they could either
have all of the units built by the mid
dle of the '00-'Ol school year or half
by fall 2000 and half by fall 2001.

The University
chose the latter
option, because
having a large
number of hous
ing units become
available in the
middle of the
school year does

not fit with student housing needs.
"It basically was a combination
of bottlenecks ranging from a short
age of labor in the Bay Area to a
bottleneck of getting permits ap
proved," said Graduate Student
Council member Harris Shapiro.
Members of the GSC felt that ex
tending the lease on the off-campus
apartments was an adequate re
sponse to the construction delay.
"Effectively, the net number of
spaces isn't changing, so we're
happy," said Robert Rudnitsky, a
doctoral student in applied physics.

Rudnitsky's worry was not about
University response, but about
community response.
"People in the community have
been writing nasty letters to the edi
tor complaining about the construc
tion," he said.
Fellow GSC member Karin
Wahl-Jorgensen agreed.
"We want the community to see
Stanford not just as a big corpora
tion. but as a community of individ
uals," said Wahl-Jorgensen, a doc
toral student in communications.
To this end, Rudnitsky hopes
that many graduate students attend
Thursday's town hall meeting to dis
cuss the housing situation. The
meeting, at 7:30 p.m. in Annenberg
Auditorium, will be conducted by
Santa Clara County Supervisor
Joseph Simitian.
