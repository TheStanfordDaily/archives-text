# Grad housing finalized
## 200 units by 2000, rest by '01, says admin 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Stanford will have only 2(H) of its
480 new graduate student housing
units ready for the fall of 2(XX). The
remaining units will be ready the fol
lowing fall.
To compensate for the lost
spaces, the University will maintain
its current leases on 150 apartments
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park
through the 2000-'Ol school year.
"It was a question of feasibility,"
said Tom Wasow, associate dean of
graduate policy. "The contractor
told us that getting them all up by
2000 wasn't realistic."
The contractors Stanford hired
to complete the project told the
University that they could either
have all of the units built by the mid
dle of the '00-'Ol school year or half
by fall 2000 and half by fall 2001.

The University
chose the latter
option, because
having a large
number of hous
ing units become
available in the
middle of the
school year does

not fit with student housing needs.
"It basically was a combination
of bottlenecks ranging from a short
age of labor in the Bay Area to a
bottleneck of getting permits ap
proved," said Graduate Student
Council member Harris Shapiro.
Members of the GSC felt that ex
tending the lease on the off-campus
apartments was an adequate re
sponse to the construction delay.
"Effectively, the net number of
spaces isn't changing, so we're
happy," said Robert Rudnitsky, a
doctoral student in applied physics.

Rudnitsky's worry was not about
University response, but about
community response.
"People in the community have
been writing nasty letters to the edi
tor complaining about the construc
tion," he said.
Fellow GSC member Karin
Wahl-Jorgensen agreed.
"We want the community to see
Stanford not just as a big corpora
tion. but as a community of individ
uals," said Wahl-Jorgensen, a doc
toral student in communications.
To this end, Rudnitsky hopes
that many graduate students attend
Thursday's town hall meeting to dis
cuss the housing situation. The
meeting, at 7:30 p.m. in Annenberg
Auditorium, will be conducted by
Santa Clara County Supervisor
Joseph Simitian.

The meeting is not to ask any
thing of the county, but simply to
discuss issues and concerns, accord
ing to Larry Morton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
for Stanford.
The University had considered
asking for an exemption from its
general use permit in order to build
the housing, but decided against it.
The general use permit specifies
how many square feet the Universi
ty is allowed to build in a given time
span.
"Right now, we're really not ask
ing the county to do anything specif
ic," said Vice Provost for Institu
tional Planning Geoff Cox. "We
didn't think [the exemption! would
receive enough support."
The University worried that peti
tioning for the exception to the gen
eral use permit would slow the pro
ject's pace. Morton said.

"The Palo Alto City Council was
100 percent opposed," he said. "The
chairman of the planning committee
refused to sign an exemption under
any reason."
The two buildings scheduled to
be built by 2000, one behind Mir
rielees and the other at the corner of
Campus Drive and Bowdoin Street,
will contain between 200 and 250
units, according to Wasow.
Wahl-Jorgensen claims that even
the entire 480 slots will not provide
enough space.
"Ideally we would have 1,000
new spaces by 2(XK), but we feel that
the University, under the circum
stances, is doing the best it can," she
said. "We're just glad they're taking
the housing issue seriously.
In May, more than I,(XK) gradu
ate students protested the lack of
housing with a rally in the Main
Quad. The University unveiled a
three-part housing plan this sum
mer, the first stage of which is the
building of these 480 graduate stu
dent apartments.
