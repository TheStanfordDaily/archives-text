History Prof. Jack Rakove testified before
the House Subcommittee on the Constitution at
the Capitol yesterday in an attempt to establish
the definition of an impeachable offense.
Rakove gave a prepared statement to the
committee, a subcommittee of the House Judi
ciary Committee, which is currently conducting
the preliminary impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton.
In all, 19 academics and lawyers gave state
ments at yesterday's hearing, which was held in
an effort to define the nature of impeachable of
fenses and determine for what use the framers
of the Constitution intended impeachment.
Rakove, who won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize in
history for his book on constitutional history,
opened his statement by thanking the commit
tee for the opportunity to testify, saying, "(His
torians] rarely have the chance to contribute to
a debate potentially as momentous as this com
mittee's proceedings promise to be."
He then proceeded to discuss in great detail
the history of impeachment in the Constitution.
He focused on the crucial Constitutional phrase
"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and mis
demeanors," which defines impeachable of
fenses.
He said, "For better or worse, 'other high

crimes and misdemeanors' is one of those many
tantalizing phrases than entered the Constitu
tion without adequate discussion; its addition
was more than an afterthought but something
less than a decision taken only after careful ef
forts at definition had been scrupulously under
taken."
Rakove also detailed how the process for im
peachment was developed and modified at the
Constitutional Conventions more than 2(H)
years ago. He explained how the terms used to
define an impeachable offense went through
numerous revisions.
What began as "malpractice or neglect of
duty" became "treason, bribery, or corruption."
The word corruption was first replaced by "mal
administration" and then "attempts to subvert
the Constitution," before the framers decided
on "other high crimes and misdemeanors."
Rakove concluded his statement to the com
mittee by stating his opposition to the current
impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton. He told the committee members to ask
themselves, "What Constitution do we want to
have when this controversy has ended?" Final
ly, he said, "a decision to proceed with impeach
ment in this matter would enlarge the impeach
ment clause well beyond its current boundaries
and in ways that threaten to distort
the original constitutional design."
In light of last Tuesday's Congres
sional elections. Political Science
Prof. Doug Rivers, an expert on
American elections, described the
chances of impeachment proceeding

much further as "slim to none."
Democrats performed surprising
ly well in the elections, gaining five
seats in the House and not giving up
any seats in the Senate. Many experts
had predicted strong Republican
gains due to Clinton's troubles and a
historical pattern of midterm losses
by the President's party.
Rivers said. "It was very unusual
for the President's party to pick up

seats for the House in the midterm
elections I think what it means is
that the Democrats see very little risk
in defending President Clinton."
Rivers, who joined Rakove on a
teach-in panel to discuss impeach
ment last month, gave his full support
to his colleague's involvement in the
hearing: "If they want to know about
the history of the Constitution I can't
think of a better person than Jack."
