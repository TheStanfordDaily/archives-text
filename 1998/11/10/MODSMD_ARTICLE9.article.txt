# Black journalists discuss impeachment
## 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
The Trotter Group, consisting of
several leading African-American
journalists, said last night that most
of them do not believe that Presi
dent Clinton should oe impeached,
and that, while Clinton's policies
have not been ideal, they are better
than the Republican alternative.
The group addressed a large in
terracial audience last night in a pub
lic symposium titled "Why African

Americans are Bill Clinton's Bridge
Over Troubled Water."
The group meets annually to dis
cuss important issues that affect the
African-American community.
Moderator Belva Davis brought
up Clinton's recent scandal and
asked the group whether or not he
should stay in office, evoking a vari
ety of responses.
Referring to Clinton's "absolute,
total, irreversible immunity to
shame," Pulitzer Prizewinner Les
Payne said Clinton would not resii>n

and said he saw Congress' current
efforts to impeach the president as
an undermining of the decision the
American people made at the polls.
Veteran columnist Vernon Jar
rett asked. "What would Frederick
Douglass do?
Douglass "was one of Lincoln's
sharpest critics, but he never joined
the Confederacy," he said.
The panel reached a consensus
that Clinton has had both a positive
and negative effect on the African-
American community and that.

while not ideal, he was chosen as
preferable to his adversaries.
Clinton's positive aspects, ac
cording to the panelists, include the
fact that unemployment among
African Americans has dropped sig
nificantly while salaries have risen.
In opposition, Derrick Jackson of
the Boston Globe said. "The gap be
tween rich and poor has widened ...
He has been a very good president
for the one-third of African Ameri
cans who are middle income," but he
has not helped the poorer majority.
