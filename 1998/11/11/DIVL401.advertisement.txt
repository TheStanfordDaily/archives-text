Meet the editor, Lissa Smith
Thursday. November 12. at 7 pm
This dynamic anthology documents the athletic achievements of female athletes during the late-nineteenth and twenti
eth centuries. Separate chapters written by noted sports journalists (Grace Lichtenstein, Michelle Kaufman, Karen
Karbo) cover such disciplines as basketball, soccer, baseball, swimming, horseback riding, tennis, golf, and hockey,
among others. Athletic pioneers and superstars are given their due in articles that trace the historical and cultural signifi
cance of such memorable events as Billie Jean King's triumphant tennis match with Bobby Riggs, Florence Griffith
Joyner's record-breaking four medals at the 1988 Olympics, and ice skater Tonya Harding's fall from grace. The impact
of Olympians Babe Didriksen Zaharias ("greatest all around female athlete"), Wilma Rudolph, Joan Benoit Samuelson,
Nadia Comaneci, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Suzy Chaffee, and others are placed in historical context. Immensely readable,
this deserves a spot in all sports collections.
