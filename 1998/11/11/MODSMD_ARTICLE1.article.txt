# PBS analyst falsely claims Stanford Ph.D

Robert X. Cringely, a best-selling
author, PBS television personality
and Silicon Valley pundit, has been
passing himself off as a former Stan
ford professor and doctoral degree
recipient for years.
Records in the Registrar's Office
and the Communication Depart
ment indicate, however, that Cringe
ly— who used his given name, Mark
Stephens, while at Stanford — never
held a title more prestigious than
teaching assistant. Cringely complet
ed his master's degree in September
1979 but never received any higher
degree.
Questions about Cringely's cre
dentials arose this week after a story
in Monday's San Francisco Chroni
cle erroneously referred to Cringely

as a former Stanford professor. In
past articles, the Los Angeles Times
described Cringely as a Stanford pro
fessor on two separate occasions. In
addition, Cringely's PBS web page
refers to him as a "sex symbol and
former Stanford professor." Scores
of other newspaper articles pub
lished about Cringely since the early
1990s refer it) his Stanford affiliation.
In both the hardback and paper
back editions of Cringely's best-sell
ing book, "Accidental Empires," he
is described as a former Stanford pro
fessor as well.
Although Laura Evenson, the re
porter who researched and wrote the
story for the Chronicle, had doubts
about Cringely's affiliation with
Stanford, the story ran with the ques
tionable passage.
