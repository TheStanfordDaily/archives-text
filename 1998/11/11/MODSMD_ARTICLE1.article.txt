# PBS analyst falsely claims Stanford Ph.D
## 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Robert X. Cringely, a best-selling
author, PBS television personality
and Silicon Valley pundit, has been
passing himself off as a former Stan
ford professor and doctoral degree
recipient for years.
Records in the Registrar's Office
and the Communication Depart
ment indicate, however, that Cringe
ly— who used his given name, Mark
Stephens, while at Stanford — never
held a title more prestigious than
teaching assistant. Cringely complet
ed his master's degree in September
1979 but never received any higher
degree.
Questions about Cringely's cre
dentials arose this week after a story
in Monday's San Francisco Chroni
cle erroneously referred to Cringely

as a former Stanford professor. In
past articles, the Los Angeles Times
described Cringely as a Stanford pro
fessor on two separate occasions. In
addition, Cringely's PBS web page
refers to him as a "sex symbol and
former Stanford professor." Scores
of other newspaper articles pub
lished about Cringely since the early
1990s refer it) his Stanford affiliation.
In both the hardback and paper
back editions of Cringely's best-sell
ing book, "Accidental Empires," he
is described as a former Stanford pro
fessor as well.
Although Laura Evenson, the re
porter who researched and wrote the
story for the Chronicle, had doubts
about Cringely's affiliation with
Stanford, the story ran with the ques
tionable passage.
"I started thinking: wait a second,
this person says he's a former Stan
ford professor, but why would he give
up a life as a Stanford professor for an
uncertain life as a free-lance writer?"
Evenson said.
Evenson attempted to verify
Cringely's status by checking with the
Stanford News Service, she said.
News Service was unable to check
Cringely's status with the Registrar's
Office in time for Evenson's dead
line. Evenson wrote the story anyway
and referred to Cringely as a former
Stanford professor, attributing the in
formation to the PBS Web site.
In interviews with Cringely, Even
son said he told her he had been a
professor at Stanford.
" This is a good example of how
bad journalism begets bad journal
ism," said Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser. "Attribution is not a justifi
cation for inaccuracy. We teach that
to students here, and I can't imagine a
newsroom in the country where that
is not taught as well."
When asked about his connec
tions to Stanford and his claims to
have been a professor here, Cringely

told the Daily yesterday that he
would be happy to show his diploma
but felt it unnecessary.
"I don't care about this, and why
should I bother to show you my
diploma?" Cringely said. "I worked
for 31 years as a reporter and I don't
care about your story."
Later, however, he released a
statement in which he apologized to
the "faculty, students and administra
tion of Stanford University."
At Stanford from 1977 to 1983,
Cringely said that he finished his
course work in 1981 and stayed on to
teach. According to the Registrar's
Office, Cringely enrolled at Stanford
in 1977 and worked on his master's
until 1979. From 1979 to 1982, ac
cording to the Registrar's Office,
Cringely worked toward a doctorate.
"To the best of my knowledge, I
was doing so with the title of acting
assistant professor," Cringely said.
Communication Department
Chair Steven Chaffee, however, em
phasized the difference between a
teaching assistant and a professor.
"It would be like a medical stu
dent passing himself off as a doctor,"
Chaffee said.
Cringely explained that he did not
finish his dissertation, though he
claims to have completed the course

work and oral examinations neces
sary to receive the degree.
"That puts me in a category with
thousands of people teaching at uni
versities across America who have
precisely my qualifications," Cringe
ly said. "They have done everything
but those final touches on the disser
tation. They are called 'professor'
and 'Dr.' and nobody questions it.
Now somebody has questioned it."
Adding that he felt that he had
done the work necessary to earn his
doctorate, Cringely said he hopes to
eventually return to Stanford.
"[A] new fact has now become
painfully clear to me: you don't say
you have the Ph.D unless you RE
ALLY have the Ph.D," Cringely
said. "Moreover, I should have fin
ished the work. And if Stanford will
allow me to, I will."
"I don't know what the University
can do," Chaffee said. "I suppose the
University could get a cease and de
sist order, but I think that would be a
lot more trouble than it's worth.
There are a lot of cases out there of
people claiming a closer affiliation
with Stanford than they actually have
His is an extreme form."
