## Livingston meets with Gingrich 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, House speaker
in-waiting, met with Newt Gingrich to dis
cuss a transition to power on Tuesday as
competition for other Republican leader
ship posts swirled around him.
Livingston told reporters he would be
"taking notes," but otherwise made no
comment as he arrived for his first meet
ing with Gingrich since his emergence as
the next leader of House Republicans.
Several GOP sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Rep. C.W.
"Bill" Young, a 67-year-old veteran law
maker from Florida, was in line to suc
ceed Livingston as chairman of the pow
erful Appropriations Committee. Young,
elected last week to his 15th term in the
House, has been serving as chairman of
the defense subcommittee on the panel.
These officials said he is likely to be suc
ceeded in that post by Rep. Jerry Lewis of
California.
Young, who is the senior Republican
on the panel, did not immediately return
a phone call seeking comment on his like
ly ascension to chairmanship of the
Appropriations Committee. Ironically,
Gingrich passed over him four years ago

when he named Livingston to head the
panel.
Livingston worked in his office much
of the day, although a late-afternoon ses
sion was set with Gingrich in the speak
er's offices in the Capitol.
One official said the 55-year-old
Louisianan was focusing part of his atten
tion on the makeup of the Republican
steering committee, the group that makes
committee assignments before the begin
ning of each Congress. The speaker has a
large measure of influence over commit
tee assignments, and the task must be
handled carefully, given the rival claims
often staked by individual lawmakers to
preferred committee slots.
This official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Livingston was also
continuing to talk by phone with the
Republican rank and file in advance of
the vote next week on a candidate for
speaker.
The list of items calling for attention
was a long one, including filling dozens of
staff jobs in the speaker's office, taking a
hand in freshman orientation for the
newly elected members next week, over
seeing any revisions in the Republican

proposal for House rules changes and
considering any changes in committees
where the speaker has unilateral authori
ty to make GOP appointments: Rules,
Oversight and Intelligence.
One source also said Livingston has
made it clear privately he won't intervene
in the competition for majority leader or
other leadership positions.
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas
is seeking a new term as No. 2 in the
Republican leadership, but faces chal
lenges from Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Wash
ington and Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
Outwardly, Armey's staff projected confi
dence during the day, and Largent issued
a statement declaring that Armey's claim
of 1(X) or more votes is greatly exaggerat
ed.
For her part, Dunn made calls to col
leagues after an early morning appear
ance on television. "I think we have a
bright opportunity right now to rearrange
the top leadership of the House of Repre
sentatives, to pull in somebody like me
who has been a leader, who understands
teamwork, who is a communicator and
can touch base with a lot of folks out
there," she said on CNN.
