### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
World Bank said Tuesday it was
making $2(X) million available from
existing projects to assist Central
American nations devastated by
Hurricane Mitch.
The multilateral lending institu
tion said it was working on mea
sures to prevent debt servicing from
constraining the ability of
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador
and Guatemala to meet their emer
gency needs.
"The World Bank has teams in
all four countries working hand-in
hand with the authorities to assess
the damages and establish the prior
ities," said World Bank President
James Wolfensohn. "We have
authorized the release of funds
from existing projects and we are
preparing emergency assistance for
those countries that will need addi

tional assistance."
The International Monetary
Fund said Michel Camdessus, its
managing director, will visit Central
America next week to study the
most efficient way to provide IMF
assistance with the most pressing
and immediate problems, an IMF
spokesman said.
He said the IMF is "considering
various ways in which it can best
help the affected countries," includ
ing using existing loans or activating
special contingency funds.
In a related development. Tipper
Gore, wife of Vice President A 1
Gore, announced in Honduras that
the United States will provide
another $10 million to help people
in the region deal with the devasta
tion caused by the hurricane.
"The world must know that the
tragedy in Central America is one

of biblical proportions," said Mrs.
Gore, who noted that the United
States already had announced a $70
million relief package.
The $10 million will be used for
road repairs so relief supplies can
reach people, as well as for sanita
tion efforts.
Mrs. Gore said President Clinton
had asked Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew
Cuomo and the U.S. Agency for
International Development to send
experts to Central America to
assess how housing can be recon
structed and infrastructure devel
oped.
At least 10,000 people are
believed to have died after Central
America's worst natural disaster,
which has brought the threat of
cholera and malaria and caused bil
lions of dollars in damage.
