ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Jesse
Jackson appealed to Nigeria's ruler
on Tuesday to put the country's
authoritarian past behind and push
ahead toward democracy.
"Things are now happening for
the better in Nigeria," said Jackson,
the Clinton administration's special
envoy to Africa. He spoke to
reporters after meeting for closed
door talks with Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar.
Jackson said the main thrust of
his meeting was to encourage
Abubakar about the positive steps
he has taken as head of state, such
as scheduling presidential elections
for February. But he added that he
also warned of obstacles still
remaining.
"I have a tremendous sense of
hope about the elections next year,
but I also think we will do well to
warn Nigerians and to challenge

them to look beyond the elections
to what the real challenges are in
economic and other fields." he said.
Nigeria, hobbled by mismanage
ment. waste and rampant corrup
tion, remains an economic cripple
despite producing 2 millions of bar
rels of oil a day. The world's sixth
largest producer of oil cannot even
refine enough gasoline for its own
use, and poverty is rampant.
In addition. Nigeria suffers from
bitter ethnic disputes and a political
class viewed as thoroughly corrupt.
Abubakar has dramatically
altered Nigeria's political course
since coming to, power in early
June, after the sudden death of dic
tator Gen. Sani Abacha. In addition
to scheduling presidential elections,
he has vowed to step aside in May.
Although many analysts believe
the military will find a way to hang
onto at least some of its power, few

question Abubakar's resolve to
shift Nigeria's direction.
"Things are happening now for
the better in Nigeria," said Jackson,
who returned to the commercial
capital, Lagos, late Tuesday for
meetings with politicians, including
relatives of the late opposition lead
er Moshood Abiola.
Jackson also submitted to
Abubakar a list of concerns given to
him by representatives of the Ogoni
ethnic minority of southeastern
Nigeria. The Ogonis, who remain
mired in poverty despite living in
the oil-rich Niger River delta, have
long felt uegitclcd r by the, central
government.
Jackson did not detail their con
cerns but said that Abubakar
promised to discuss them with the
Ogoni leaders and described the
general's response as "enormous
and sensitive."
