# Tobacco foes target impotence

Are you willing to give up your sex life
for cigarettes?
For years, scientists have been warning
that smoking can contribute to impotence
as well as fertility problems in men. Now
anti-smoking forces have seized on that
finding as a potentially powerful new way
to get people to kick the habit.
In California, a $21 million campaign
includes a commercial showing a cigarette
drooping limply. The message:
"Cigarettes. Still Think They're Sexy?"
In Thailand, the health ministry
ordered the nation's tobacco monopoly to
print a warning on cigarette packs:
"Cigarette smoking causes sexual impo
tence."
In England, public health activists are
lobbying for a similar warning label.
The impotence risk — and strategy —
are attracting media attention, too. Last

Sunday, CBS's "60 Minutes" devoted a
segment to the subject.
Statistician Steven J. Milloy, who regu
larly contradicts what he regards as "junk
science" and frequently sides with the
tobacco industry, said anti-smoking forces
are distorting a 1994 study by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention that
concluded that smokers are twice as likely
as nonsmokers to be impotent.
Milloy adjusted the CDC data to con
sider blood vessel disease, hormone
imbalances and other risk factors. As a
result, he said, the link between smoking
and impotence became statistically
insignificant.
The impotence-and-smoking message
has been boosted, in part, by the runaway
popularity of Viagra.
Pfizer Inc. reported that three of four
men who participated in its clinical trials

for Viagra were smokers. And, Pfizer
found, 21 percent of men with erectile dys
function have underlying conditions such
as high blood pressure, heart disease and
diabetes — all of which can be caused or
complicated by smoking.
Urologists say smoking can diminish
erections by reducing blood flow in the
penis, just as it can clog blood vessels to
the heart.
In studies published since 1989,
between 39 percent and 82 percent of the
men suffering from vascular impotence
were smokers. Smoking can also reduce
fertility in men, too.
Clive Bates, director of the London
based Action on Smoking and Health,
said the warnings about smoking and
impotence are shockingly effective
because cigarettes are so often associated
with the after-sex experience.
