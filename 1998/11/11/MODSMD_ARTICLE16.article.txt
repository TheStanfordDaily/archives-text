# Health care spending growth slows
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The nation's
health care bill grew by less than 5 percent last
year, the smallest increase on record, the gov
ernment said Tuesday.
The growth of managed care in the private
sector has kept health care spending increases
low since the mid-19905. Now cost controls in
Medicare are beginning to slow the pace of
growth in that massive program, bringing the
overall increase in 1997 to just 4.8 percent.
That's the smallest increase since 1960,
when the government began tracking spend
ing in comparable terms. ,
The growth was 4.9 percent in 1995 and in
1996. It has slowed steadily from the peak
year, 1990, when spending increased by 12.2
percent.
Overall, health care spending in 1997
totaled $1.1 trillion, with an average of $4,000
spent per person, according to the annual
report by the Health Care Financing Adminis
tration.
Still, the government predicts that spending

soon will begin to accelerate again, nearly
doubling to $2.1 trillion by 2007. Premiums
will increase, analysts predict and private pay
ments may rise as insurance companies look
to compensate for cost controls in Medicare.
Each year's spending is primarily a product
of two factors: spending in the private sector
and government spending, primarily Medicare
and Medicaid.
Private health care spending grew at an all
time low rate of 2.3 percent in 1994, but last
year, it also grew slowly: by just 3.2 percent.
Meanwhile. Medicare spending lor the dis
abled and elderly grew by 7.2 percent, down
from 12.2 percent growth in 1994.
Analysts said the Medicare slowdown
came largely because costs grew more slowly,
including medical prices and payments to doc
tors and hospitals. They also credited more
careful billing by providers in the wake of
fraud and abuse crackdowns and a "small-but
steadv" decline in growth of people served by
Medicare.
