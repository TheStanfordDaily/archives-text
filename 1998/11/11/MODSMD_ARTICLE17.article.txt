A seven-and-a-half ton, 74-foot Norway spruce is suspended from a crane in
front of a home in Ohio after it was cut down yesterday. The 75-year-old tree will
be headed for Rockefeller Center in New York for the annual display during the
holiday season. The tree was found during a helicopter search conducted by
the Rockefeller Center.
