Suspect in homeless slashings arrested
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A man suspected of slashing
four homeless people was arrested Tuesday with a bloody knife
in his pocket just blocks from where the latest victim had his
throat cut as he slept.
Police believe Joshua Rudiger, 21, cut the throats of three
homeless men and one homeless woman in the last three weeks.
The woman died. Rudiger considers himself a vampire, a police
source told KCBS radio.
He was arrested shortly after the latest victim was found
staggering about near Chinatown.
Asian characters or symbols were written in red liquid at
three of the four crime scenes. Police had not determined if the
symbols were written in blood or what they meant.
Although a suspect in all four slashings. Rudiger has been
charged in the latest attack only.
Before the arrest, advocates for the homeless said police
were not treating the attacks as seriously as they should have.
"If a rash of tourists were stabbed over several days, there'd
be a major response," said Paul Boden, head of the nonprofit
Coalition on Homelessness.
Police Chief Fred Lau called the charge "absolutely untrue."
The first attack came Oct. 16 when a sleeping man has his
throat cut. Hours later, a homeless man approached police and

told them a man had come up to him and slashed his throat
without warning. Both are recovering. The latest victim was in
stable condition.
Shirley Dillahuntv. 48, died after she was slashed while sleep
ing on a sidewalk in the city's Mission district on Oct. 2 l ).

with the cartoon.

performed by a four-camel band called the Hard Pack.
