Presidential Grants help
junior and tenured faculty
devote time to students

IN HIS RECENT State of the Universi
ty address, President Gerhard Casper
announced a new program that will give
Presidential Research Grants to all junior
faculty who teach undergraduates. We
commend this move, which demonstrates
the University's commitment to supporting
those in key pedagogical positions and to
attracting fresh, new teaching talent.
As stated in President Casper's address,
every assistant professor will receive $S,(KK)
at appointment with the guarantee of an
additional $1(),(KK) grant if awarded tenure.
All current junior faculty will receive $S,(KK)
this year. Franklin Orr, Dean of the School
of Earth Sciences, said that raising this type
of research funding is notoriously difficult
for faculty.
Maintaining the delicate balance
between teaching undergraduates and car
rying out demanding research is often chal
lenging, and, thus, it is our hope that the
Presidential Research Grants will effective
ly lighten this burden. Without the need to
apply for as many research grants, the
junior faculty will be able to focus more on
teaching within the larger sphere of our
research-intensive university. Furthermore,
since the advancement of junior faculty to
higher, tenured positions depends heavily
on innovative research, these grants could
provide precisely the support assistant pro
fessors need for promotion.
In comparison to other universities,
Stanford's program stands out as a pioneer.

For example, at Yale, junior faculty have
trouble getting any university funding at all
and often find advancement nearly impossi
ble; most searches to fill tenure positions
consider only candidates from outside of
Yale. Over the past few years, several assis
tant professors from different departments
have left Yale and other universities,
believing that they will not be offered
tenure at their institutions.
One minor worry for Stanford, however,
is that the Presidential Research Grants will
allow assistant professors to take on too
many additional research projects with
their new funding. This potential may most
benefit professors working on less costly
humanities research. And more projects
and studies could also entail more research
assistant positions for students. Thus, we
encourage junior faculty to apply their
grants in a way that will allow them to keep
interaction with students a top priority.
Clearly, the Presidential Research Grants
show that Stanford supports its junior facul
ty. However, the University can also show its
support by aiding junior faculty with other
problems. Consider, for instance, the high
cost of living in the Bay Area. Programs at
other universities such as Ohio State give
new professors money towards purchasing
housing close to campus. Considering the
relatively high real estate prices in Palo Alto,
creating a similar program for new Stanford
professors would undoubtedly help recruit
ment and supplement the atmosphere of the
academic community.
We welcome President Casper's bold
decision to implement the Presidential
Research Grants. The grants give junior
faculty more flexibility and open further
avenues for the advancement of teaching
and research.
