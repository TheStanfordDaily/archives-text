# Casper addresses ASSU
## President answers questions on grad housing, safety, parking 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
University President Gerhard Casper spoke
at the ASSU Senate meeting last night on a va
riety of issues, ranging from Big Game and
graduate student housing to campus safety and
parking.
Casper made his quarterly appearance to an
swer questions from senators, the most lengthy
of which dealt with the status of plans for future
graduate student housing.
According to Casper, the plans for 480 units
in Escondido Village have been approved, an
architect has been chosen and Stanford has ap
plied for a Santa Clara County building permit.
In addition, Casper said that Stanford "hopes to
open at least half of the 480 units by September
of 2(XX). with the remaining to be completed by
fall 2001."
Some existing two-story units will be demol
ished to make way for the larger structures.
To raise funds for the project, Casper said he
has begun negotiations with possible donors,
but "the process is not easy." However, he said
he was quite optimistic that Stanford "will be
able to raise a substantial portion for graduate
student housing."

In answer to the ASSU's concerns regarding
campus safety, Casper highlighted the current
and future improvements to campus security.
ASSU President Maren Norton and various
University officials have cooperated to extend
Marguerite hours on Friday and Saturday night.
The free shuttle will operate from Palo Alto
until 2:30 a.m. both days, providing service for
passengers arriving on the last Caltrain.
According to Casper although the service
expansion is important, "extending Marguerite
shuttle service is not itself the answer to safety
concerns."
He said other safety initiatives include ex
tending SURE Escort Service hours, increasing
the number emergency blue light phones to 47,
adding 30 more by this summer and encourag
ing residences to be locked 24 hours a day.
Stanford has invested a lot in campus securi
ty, but even in light of recent safety concerns it
will remain "an open campus," he said. "There
are limits to what [Stanford] can do."
Senators also asked Casper about the on
campus parking crunch.
He noted that the University will add 9(X)
new "C" spaces in two lots. Five hundred will be

located in the existing lot off Cam
pus Drive at Stock Farm Road. The
others will be in a new lot near the in
tersection of Arboretum and Quar
ry Roads. In addition, the Track
House lot has added 12K new spaces.
Due to environmental con
straints, however, the university will
not be able to build more in the near
future.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, speaking at
Casper's request, said "we'll have to
reconceptualize how we think of stu
dent parking," as well as what Stan
ford can do about the number of cars
on campus to make it safer for bicy
clists and pedestrians.
Casper was also asked about fac
ulty using their Stanford affiliation in
making public political statements.
Last week, nine Stanford history
professors signed a joint statement
from hundreds of academics printed
in The New York Times, urging
Congress to end its impeachment in
quiry of President Clinton.
Casper responded that although
in their role as citizens, political ac
tivity is commended, it is "an obnox
ious habit" to include one's associa
tion with Stanford when making po
litical statements. But he conceded
that listing one's academic affiliation
is necessary to give credibility to
such statements.
