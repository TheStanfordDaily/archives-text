## Re(de)fining yourself as you go 
### 
IN AN ERA when a
box of Twinkies can
figure into an effective
legal defense, the notion
of responsibility seems to
have lost its common
sense meaning.
Simple intuition tells us

that if some success or mistake is a conse
quence of an intention of mine, I am usual
ly held responsible and receive the appro
priate credit or blame.
Strangely, we have often felt the need to
complicate this simple story of responsibili
ty by introducing exotic entities of causal
import. The arrangement of the stars or the
whims of divine beings are some well
known examples, but there have been other
proposals as well.
Some great thinkers have believed that
humans are born with innate features that
ultimately determine our abilities — for
instance, that the congenital constitution of
one's soul determines social rank or that the
membership in a race determines one's
intellectual capacity. On these views, each
individual has some sort of essence that
completely prescribes the limits of her
human possibilities.
Although our modern sensibility dis
misses such essentialist claims as mytholo
gy, nowadays we fall prey to more natural
ized superstitions. "I can't do that because
I'm a left-brained person," explains the
unartistic analyst, while the belligerent bully
offers the excuse, "I get my temper from my
father — I can't help it."
While statements about hemispheric
dominance and genetic predispositions are
carefully worded in the scientific literature,
their misuse in popular discourse is a cause
for alarm. Sloppy interpretations of scientif
ic findings have allowed us to shift the
blame from ourselves to factors that are out

of our control.
But how did the popular psyche that
proudly embraces the empowering ideals of
individualism take interest in the restrictive
doctrines of biological determinism? Here
is a whimsical attempt to explain the appar
ent paradox.
During our formative years, we receive
the simple advice, "Be true to yourself." As
straightforward as this axiom seems, it can
convey a confusing message. The maxim
assumes that there is an already existent,
well-formed self to which one may be true.
If we conceive of this self as a body of
beliefs and preferences that influence our
decisions, then the adage advocates that we
make choices that are roughly consistent
with our previous ones. In a strict interpre
tation, the adage encourages a person to
continue on the same trajectory that charac
terizes her past choices and actions.
Unfortunately we sometimes take this
advice to an objectionable extreme. For
instance, some of us feel obliged to mock
those people who veer off the paths that
their histories define.
"That guy's a total poser," declares the
punk rock girl who learns that one of her
cohorts went to a prep school; similarly the
humanist proclaims, "What does she
know — she's a paleontologist," as though
her official area of expertise precludes her
from saying anything intelligent about
works of literature.
In short, the simple maxim may drive
one to believe that everyone should be held
to some standard of authenticity. This
encourages individualism but assumes that
an individual has a fixed, authentic essence;
that is, you should be different from others,
but you should not be different from your
self — whatever that "true" self happens to
be. Thus, by holding a certain kind of indi
vidualism, we find ourselves stuck with a

form of neo-essentialism.
What the misinterpreted evidence from
neuroscience and genetics provides is a way
to make the existence of authentic essences
more palatable to our modern, scientific
minds. A person is essentially analytic or
essentially ill-tempered because these facts
purportedly follow from his biology, and
what better candidate for an essence is
there than one's biological composition?
If we accept this view, we are denying
that people can evolve over time or that they
can alter their trajectories in spite of the
direction of their momenta. However, the
fact is that a person is continuously changing
and building her character, and the constan
cy of this growth and development reduces
the idea of essences into a useless concept.
When we note that various studies demon
strate that "predisposed" is a far cry from
"predetermined," the neo-essentialist view
becomes even less appealing.
What's more, modern science informs us
that the brain restructures itself as a part of
the learning process; new connections
between neurons can appear, and the
strengths of the connections change with
use. The brains of the young and old alike
exhibit this malleable, plastic nature.
The plasticity of the brain hints at the
plasticity of mind, which in turn suggests a
plasticity of ability and behavior. But we
never needed modern science to propose
this possibility; we have known for centuries
that our habits are never fixed, that our
skills are not innate and that we always have
the freedom to change the way we act, the
way we think, the way we are.
And so finally we get back to common
sense.
