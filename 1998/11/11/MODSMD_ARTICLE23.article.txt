Criminalizing abortion
offers no advantage
Ms. McCarthy's Nov. 4 letter advocates
the repeal of a woman's right to choose
presently (and precariously) protected in
the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe vs.
Wade. She argues that "feminists must
give a resounding 'no' to violence and
death in all its guises" by forbidding abor
tion.
What Ms. McCarthy fails to acknowl
edge, however, is that senseless violence
and death will not come to an abrupt halt
if abortion becomes a criminal act.
The simple principle of supply and
demand states that as long as there is a
demand for abortions, they will occur,
legality notwithstanding. Criminalizing
the procedure will only serve to drive
women to return to resurrected back alley
clinics to procure abortions illegally.
According to the most recent edition of
"Our Bodies, Ourselves," before Roe vs.
Wade legalized a woman's right to choose,
one out of every 3,000 women died in
these unsanitary and hazardous back-alley
abortions. Countless others lost their abil
ity to ever bear children in the future. This
horrific death toll radically dropped once
abortion became legal.
Currently, the abortion mortality rate

is 0.8 deaths per 1(X),(MX) procedures per
year. Since 1974, there has been an aver
age of fewer than five deaths per year
from abortions.
Contrast that with the mortality rate of
carrying a child to term — 14 deaths per
100,000 births.
Ms. McCarthy, don't you see that crim
inalizing abortion will by no means "give a
resounding 'no 1 to violence and death"?
Rather, it will only cause millions of
women to place their lives and bodies at
risk in the hands of illegal abortionists.

Stein fails with subtlety
David Stein's Nov. 9 column,"The hazy
line between us and the real world" begins
promisingly but retreats into inexact gen
eralizations by its end.
Through the first few paragraphs. Stein
treads with caution, rejecting simplistic
interpretations of the "real world," Stan
ford's often-invoked, mythical antithesis.
He points out that members of the Stan
ford community have just as much a right
to consider their experiences "real" as
anvone. And he sees that life at Stanford,

cushy in some ways, has its rigors.
But Stein goes astray when he offers up
his own explanation of what makes Stan
ford unique.
Although Stein says that "the differ
ence doesn't concern the difficulty ... of
our lives," he seems to be arguing that we
do have it very hard here, despite all
appearances to the contrary. More impor
tantly, our troubles, according to Stein,
don't consist of piles of unread books and
unfinished problem sets, but of something
much deeper.
We may enjoy the comforts of "three
square meals a day"and the joys of inner
tube water polo, but we live a life stripped
of all reassuring categories. And Stein
hints that this phenomenon is not only
unique to Stanford but historically
unprecedented.
The story Stein tells casts academics
and their students in an attractively heroic
light. He writes, "Right now is an exciting
time in academia. Barriers between disci
plines are falling away, subjects are exam
ined from multiple perspectives and natu
ral phenomena are no longer viewed as
resulting from a single factor."
Literary scholars must face the fact that
"the aesthetic lies on its deathbed"; chaos
theory wreaks havoc on traditional sci
ence.
While members of academia wrestle
with these demons, those beyond Palm

Drive cling happily and ignorantly to their
illusions.
I won't deny some truth to Stein's
claims, but he paints his picture with too
wide a brush — ironic in one advocating
subtlety.
For a start. Stein does considerable
injustice to the past. I doubt if many scien
tists worthy of the name ever viewed all
natural phenomena as "resulting from a
single factor." Moreover, although I am no
physicist, I question whether chaos theory
poses any more of a threat to existing mod
els than Copernican cosmology or quan
tum theory did during their times. As far as
I can tell, science has been more or less in
a state of upheaval since its inception.
And finally, if the aesthetic lies on its
deathbed, 1 can only conclude that
overzealous academics have driven it
there. Such a notion deserves to be cri
tiqued, not murdered.
Granted, Stein may be giving the past
some credit; perhaps he is simply arguing
that the rate of knowledge acquisition has
increased, and the intellectual difference
between academia and the world outside
continues to widen.
Maybe so (although there are plenty of
special cases of rigorous thinking off-cam
pus and of simplicity within universities).
But one can tentatively allow Stein the
point and still question how this difference
affects quality of life.

Those outside of Stanford may naively
believe in cause and effect (which Stein
goes so far as to put in quotation marks),
but the members of the "real world" also
face a more complex, less polite society.
Intellectual contemplation is a burden, but
it is also a luxury.
I urge Stein not to fall into the traps he
himself describes. By all means, one
should avoid easy distinctions — as Stein
did in the first half of his column, but not
in the second.

medicine
In response to the Nov. 5 article, "Med
students promote herbal healing," I am
astonished and dismayed at the extraordi
nary gullibility and uncritical advocacy of
scientifically questionable benefits of
herbal remedies and "health" supple
ments by the Alternative Medicine Inter
est Group of Stanford.
As scientists — and I always believed
we are training physician-scientists at
Stanford — we should be as critical in
