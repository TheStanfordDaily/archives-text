Remember in high school
when you were really smart?
Everyone knew your SAT score,
one of the highest in school history, and
you were the unchallenged valedictorian.
But then you came to Stanford, and at first
you felt like a little fish in a big pond. In
the real world, people still gasp in intellec
tual wonder when you gravely tell them
that you attend (dramatic pause) Stanford
University, hut on the Farm all your class
mates and housemates think they're just as
smart and talented as you.
Do you miss your glory days of aca
demic prowess? Of course, you are still the
smartest person alive — you just need to
work harder to make sure everybody else
knows it.
Dropping your SAT score or vast
Advanced Placement units into casual
conversation ("Oh look, we're having
coconut chicken for dinner. That reminds
me of what. 1 ate for dinnei the night
before I got a 5 on my AP ehem test") will
only work for the first few months at Stan
ford. Being in SLE gives you condescen
sion rights for only a year. Displaying

intellect requires a little more savvy to
carry you through until graduation.
Talk a lot in section. Talk even more in
big lectures. Your questions should not be
designed to elicit information from your
professor, but to display your vast knowl
edge of all subjects. Make random infer
ences, such as "Post-modernism as an art
form reflects the fragmentation of society;
therefore all of Einstein's theories are
bogus." Bring up questions about the
meaning of life at 10:50 in a 10 a.m. class.
Don't worry if you don't know what
you're talking about or even if you haven't
done the required reading. Your insights,
even if you pull them out of your butt, will
be more valuable then your ignorant class
mates' simple utterings. Just because your
TA is getting his Ph.D. in Japanese feudal
ism doesn't mean he knows more about
the subject than you do from seeing a
samurai movie in seventh grade. Just keep
talking; everyone loves the sound of your
voice.
Use big words when you're talking in
class or in social situations (remember, life
is really just one big section). If you can't

think of any appropriate vocabulary, make
some up. If someone asks you exactly what
"interstationarism" means, just cast him or
her a contemptuous look. Recite quotes in
foreign languages, preferably obscure or
dead ones, like Latin or hieroglyphics.
Sing Hungarian operas to prove your
point; you have a beautiful voice.
Join any argument you overhear and
insist on winning it. Tell other people their
opinions result from bourgeois brainwash
ing. Make up random statistics to support
your theories, such as, "Two out of three
people in insane asylums have integrity." If
someone successfully counters your argu
ment. he or she is lying or misinformed. You
know more than other people about their
religions or cultural backgrounds and you
have every right to condemn their thoughts.
Cite obscure sources, whether or not
they're relevant. Example: "While I was
translating ancient Greek manuscripts this
summer, 1 discovered why Stanford keeps
losing football games." In lecture, cite
essays your professor wrote. Whether or
not you want to pass them off as your own
thoughts is up to you.

Pick your major carefully. English,
communication and other majors requir
ing close to 60 units belong to lazy people.
Econ is a sell-out, although it's not as
pathetically corporate as lE. Hum bio and
mechanical engineering require a lot of
hard work, but they are too vocational.
Major in religious studies; then you can
condemn other people's beliefs as well as
their intellects. Even better, scorn the sor
did realism of the established majors and
create your own course of study that ordi
nary mortals can't even understand. Major
in Circular Studies or EESTSIE (don't
worry what the initials stand for — all
those letters sound impressive).
Get close to your professors. In lecture,
sit in the front row, within spitting distance
of the podium. If anyone sits in your
claimed seat, bite his head off. Monopolize
office hours to discuss your latest astro
physics-based literary theory. Invite your
teacher over for dinner at your residence
so he or she can listen to you talk about
yourself and your high Advanced Place
ment test scores along with the rest of your
dorm. Correct your professor's grammar

in lecture. Give him or her written feed
back on the inadequacy of the assigned
readings. In casual conversation, refer to
professors by their first names; for
instance, "Bob and 1 were playing with the
sheep in the lab the other day."
Always remember that everyone is
dumber than you. Athletes got into this
school solely through their physical
prowess and are illiterate meatheads. It is
impossible for intellectual greatness and
coordination to coexist. Anyone with any
relative that goes to Stanford is automati
cally a dimwitted legacy. Members of the
Greek system breed stupidity in each
other, and Dollies are the dumbest.
People might call you arrogant and
rude, but they are merely jealous of your
magnificent mind. Sometimes it's lonely at
the top. Don't worry — you will own them
all someday.
