## Men's tennis on top Players triumph at ITA regionals 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
Sometimes, when you're on a
roll, things just can't go wrong.
Freshman K.J. Hippensteel had one
of those marquee weeks last week
â€” not only did he capture the dou
bles title with senior Ryan Wolters
at the ITA Regional Champi
onships, he also managed to pick up
the singles title along the way.
In a draw consisting of players
from Pacific 10 Conference schools
Washington, Oregon and Califor
nia, as well as other Division I
teams, Stanford's singles players
competed to advance to the Rolex
National Indoor Championships in
February.
Hippensteel and Wolters have
earned a berth into the main dou
bles draw in the Indoor Champi
onships and Hippensteel is guaran
teed a spot in the main singles draw.
With the Cardinal taking up four
of the top five seeds, prospects
looked good for overall team suc
cess, and many players played well
to score wins.
"I was pleased with how the guys
did. Everyone had some good mo
ments in the tournament," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
Stanford occupied three of the
four singles slots in the semifinals.
Wolters played junior Geoff
Abrams in the semifinals, eventual
ly defeating him 7-6,6-4.

"In this tournament, Geoff and
Ryan played the best tennis I've
seen them play since they've been
here," said Gould
In the other semifinal, Hippen
steel defeated Oregon's Memo
Carter, the eighth seed, in two quick
sets, 6-4,6-1.
When Hippensteel and Wolters
met in the finals, competition re
mained close, but Hippensteel
pulled out the win in two sets, 6-4,7-
6, winning the tie-breaker 7-5.
"I was disappointed I didn't
win," Wolters said. "But it helped
that I lost to my teammate and my
doubles partner."
Hippensteel and Wolters both
said they felt prepared going into
the tournament with plenty of time
to work on their games. They
agreed that it was a close match but
was simply an off-day for Wolters.
"It was just one of those days
where he was making all the shots
and I wasn't," Wolters said.
"Wolly just had an off-day," Hip
pensteel said. "It was lucky on my
part and bad lupk on his part. Usu
ally in practice, Wolly whips me. It
was a big accomplishment to win
against Ryan."
In doubles, two Stanford teams
fell to Washington pair Robert
Kendrick and Nick Quattrochi.
Sophomores Scotty Scott and Ali
Ansari lost to the Husky duo 8-3 be
