### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team (11 -6-2) returns to
the field with a clean slate this afternoon as the team
squares off in the first round of NCAA tournament com
petition against the 14th-ranked Brigham Young
Cougars (18-4) in Provo, Utah.
"BYU is a very strong team," said head coach Steve
Swanson. "It will be a big challenge for us, but we are
very excited to play this team."
This game marks Stanford's eighth NCAA appear
ance. The Cardinal had qualified for the tournament for
seven straight years. However, last season the team
failed to meet the criteria of the NCAA tournament se
lection committee. In its tournament appearances, Stan
ford has compiled a 4-6-2 record.

■ Today: NCAA First Round — Stanford (11-6-2) at
BYU (18-4), 5 p.m.

Uncertainty did exist regarding Stanford's post-sea
son aspirations. The team's 5-4 Pac-10 record and fifth
place conference standing prevented any possibility of
attaining an automatic berth to the tournament. Other
factors, such as the Cardinal's wins over top 25 teams as
well as the strength of its schedule, contributed to Stan
ford's tournament invitation.
Despite an impressive season start in which Stanford
earned a decisive 3-0 victory over then-No. 15 Texas
A&M and played then-No. 2 Santa Clara to a tie, the
Cardinal struggled through many of its October games.
The BYU game was the first of five October losses for
Stanford.
Lingering animosity exists between the teams as the
Cougars handed the Cardinal its first home loss of the
1998 season on Oct. 5, a 3-2 overtime decision. Stanford
