# Women's swimming to host Nevada
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
November is the biggest training
month for Stanford's women's
swimming team. Every day the Car
dinal's Olympic-caliber swimmers
go to deGuerre Pool and find longer,
harder workouts in colder, darker
weather. Even an early-season
home dual meet against No. 21
Nevada will have little effect on the
team's training schedule.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 21
Nevada, I p.m. DeGuerre Pool.

Although the Wolfpack looks to
provide more of a test than it has in
the past, Stanford will be treating
this Friday's meet as little more than
an afternoon practice.
"Friday morning we're going to
do our normal workouts and weights
and everything we normally do,"
said senior co-captain Elin
Austevoll. Head coach Richard
Quick "will tell us to go out and
swim our best, but he doesn't want
us to go overboard."
For the more important dual
meets early next year, the team will
tone down the workouts closer to
meet days in order to ward off ex
haustion and keep swimmers fresh.
However, at this point in the season,
the benefits from training are more
important than blowing away the
competition.
"The focus of our week is not this
Friday," said senior co-captain

Chantal Rawn. "The focus is in
creased training, looking forward to
later in the season."
Although the Nevada meet is not
the highest priority for the Cardinal,
the Wolfpack could provide a good
bit of competition.
Although Nevada is not normally
considered a swimming power, the
team greatly improved itself with a
few new swimmers from China. The

Wolfpack upset No. 8 California 72-
68 on Oct. 30 and has a 4-0 record in
meets this season. According to
Rawn, many knew about Nevada's
new swimmers, but they had no idea
exactly how fast they would be.
"But, in looking at their results
against Cal, they look a lot stronger
than most of us had expected," she
said.
According to Austevoll, many of

the times for Nevada's new swim
mers are as good as, and in some
cases better than, Stanford's best
times in the same events.
"They're swimming pretty fast,"
she said. "A few of us might have to
push it a little bit."
However, Stanford, rated No. 1
by the College Swimming Coaches
