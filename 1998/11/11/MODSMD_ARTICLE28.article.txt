■ Friday: USC 4, Stanford 1.
■ Saturday: USC 4, Stanford 1.

"The goal came right off the first
face-off, really on a clear that de
flected off a defenseman's stick and
surprised the goalkeeper," senior
center Tom Trebell said.
Graduate winger Bill Elersick

followed with his first goal of the sea
son to make it 2-0.
"Bill banged in a rebound shot
under the extended goalie," said se
nior goaltender Sami Jo Small.
"We were thinking we were going
to have to score quickly and then
play even," junior center Gabe
Miller said. "We definitely were
coming in knowing we were the un
derdogs."
Stanford, however, lost its mo
mentum in the first period when
Miller dislocated his thumb. He re
turned to the game only to have his
thumb broken in the second period,
keeping him out for the next two

games.
Utah State came roaring back to
tie it at 2-2 by the end of the second.
In the third period, Stanford raised
its level of play after giving up a goal
early in the period to make it 3-2.
"We got our mental side back,"
said Trebell. "We caught on one of
those [confidence] streaks and didn't
get broken by their goal."
With seconds left in the third pe
riod, graduate winger Edo Waks
scored to tie the game at 3-3 and
force sudden-death overtime.
"We were just shooting on the
goalie and they were panicking,"
said Miller. "The keeper just kept
coughing [the puck) up."
Stanford continued its strong
play into overtime, but yielded a
goal late in the period to lose 4-3.
The team returned Friday night
to face USC and quickly fell behind
2-0. Graduate defenseman Filip
Ronning cut the deficit to 2-1 with a
second-period goal.
"He brought the puck all the way
down, outhustled them [the de
fense] and put it in," said senior de
fenseman Paul Heneman.
IJSC, however, countered with
another goal to make it 3-1 before
Stanford suffered another setback,
losing junior forward Phil Enan with
a separated shoulder.
Stanford returned for the third
period buoyed by the return of grad
uate winger Juha Yrjanheikki from
a knee injury sustained last week.
"[YrjanhcikkiJ was definitely
controlling the game," said Small.
"But the timing was off, the puck
just didn't go into the net."
Stanford gave up a late goal after

pulling its goaltender for an extra
skater.
Stanford struggled from the be
ginning in the third game, falling be
hind 3-0 by midway into the third pe
riod. Stanford was forced to play
with a depleted group of forwards,
due to the loss of Miller, Enan and
Yrjanheikki, who was unable to re
turn after the second game.
"We came to the ice with a new
team," said Trebell. "It's hard to de
lineate what we've done when we
have new lines."
Stanford managed a lone score
on a breakaway goal by Trebell.
"Eric passed it up to [TrebellJ
and he put on the afterburners,"
Small said.
The combination of mental and
physical weariness led to Stanford's
disappointing showing against I JSC'.
"It's unusual to play three games
on three consecutive days," Hene
man said. "It was a hard-fought
emotional game against Utah State
[and we] didn't have the stamina to
keep up with USC."
Stanford now faces an uphill bat
tle to qualify for Nationals.
"We'll be underdogs the rest of
the season," Small said. "From here
we can't lose anymore."
