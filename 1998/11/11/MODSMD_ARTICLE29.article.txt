MOUNTAIN BIKING: Still elated
over its dramatic advance in Western
Collegiate Cycling Conference final
rankings, the Stanford mountain bik
ing squad traveled to the NCAA na
tional race in Reno this past weekend
and finished sixth overall.

CLUB SPORTS

Over 40 different schools had rid
ers present at the national race in
Reno. The Stanford squad was only
seven people strong, as compared to
some of the other schools which had
as many as 44 riders entered into the
competition. Despite its small num
bers, the Cardinal was able to amass
257 points. The Cardinal's sixth-place
finish was the highest among any of
the teams that had 20 or fewer riders
in the race.
The first-place squad on the week
end was Fort Lewis College, which
narrowly edged out Colorado-Boul
der by a score of 377-366. Lindsey
Wilson College of Kentucky, Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and Northern
Arizona rounded out the top five.
The competition, which was origi
nally scheduled to be a two-day
event, was compressed down to a sin
gle day of competition on Sunday. In
clement weather in the altitudes of
the Sierra Nevada not only forced
competition into one day, but also ne
cessitated that the competition move
to a lower elevation to the east of
Reno. Even then, as the competition
was closing, snow flurries dusted the
course.
The Cardinal sent four riders
from the men's team and three from
the women's squad. Freshman Bob
Ryskamp finished 19th out of 215
riders in the 23-mile cross-country
race. Craig Litherland reached the
quarterfinals for Stanford in the
dual slalom race out of a field of 200
riders.
Cardinal standout Erin Kassoy
from the women's squad suffered
several mechanical setbacks in her
race. In the end, she finished 35th
after having to endure and work
through several equipment failures, a
crash and a punctured tire.

Also helping to add to the team
point finish was first-year rider
Anona Dutton. Dutton placed 18th
in the cross-country race and tallied
enough individual points to finish
ninth in the women's individual na
tional omnium title.
EQUESTRIAN: Despite a wet and
cold weekend, the Stanford equestri
an team proved that it is very capable
in the western-style competition.
Stanford ended the morning compe
tition of the doubleheader as first
overall in team points.
"I was impressed that everyone on
the team rode so well. Each member
delivered a solid performance and
the combined efforts helped us win in
the morning, despite the rain and
cold," said team captain Vanessa
Bartsch.
Not all went smoothly for the Car
dinal, though. Riders Steve Smith
and Jana Cain were both drawn to
ride a horse that would not cooperate
and refused to reach a lope. The
judges, though, decided that Cain de
served a re-ride and she was able to
ride through the meet a second time.
The success in the morning com
petition was based on the individual
finishes of Cardinal riders. In the
open-reining division, Kathleen
Gilbert finished in first place and Jen
nifer Stewart came in second.
Bartsch finished first in the Ad
vanced II division. This qualifies
Bartsch to compete in regionals and
also to move up into the open division
for upcoming competitions.
Rounding out the top finishers for
the morning were Shannon Keisling,
Shandra Christenson and Bo White,
who all finished second in the Inter
mediate I and Beginning classes.
Keisling also advanced to the next
level and will compete now in Inter
mediate 11.
The afternoon show proved not to
go as well for the Cardinal. Worn
from the morning's event, Stanford's
riders did not repeat as the high-point
team. (Tiristenson finished first in the
Intermediate I division. Keisling and
Bartsch both had a chance to com
pete in their new brackets, having
moved up due to their riding in the
morning, and finished fourth and
fifth, respectively.
