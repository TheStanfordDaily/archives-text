# Reilley speaks on Doctors Without Borders
## Doctors to the rescue 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Volunteers from Stanford are re
sponding to public health emergen
cies in places that include some of the
world's most troubled and war-torn
countries.
Their efforts are coordinated
through an international nonprofit
organization called Doctors Without
Borders, often known by its French
name, Medecins Sans Frontieres.
Yesterday evening, as part of Pot
ter House's weekly seminar series on
global health perspectives, students
and faculty gathered to hear Brigg
Reilley talk about his work in Russia.
Reilley is the Head of Missions for
MSF in Russia.

Reilley lectured on the current
state of Russia's health-care system.
In particular, he discussed the grow
ing prevalence of HIV and common
communicable diseases among the
18- to 22-year-old age group due to
sexual transmission and intravenous
drug use.
"The situation in Russia is be
coming increasingly worse," said
Reilley. "We needed to do our part
as humans to help."
As part of his 18-month tour of
duty in MSF's Moscow bureau, Reil
ley and his team worked to educate
young adults on the dangers of such
activity and its consequences, in a so
ciety where unsafe drug use is com
monplace.
"Working with Doctors Without

Borders was a great experience,"
said Evelyn Hsu. a sophomore who
volunteered in MSF's Los Angeles
office last summer. "It gave me a bet
ter overall perspective."
Hsu is scheduled to serve in the
Moscow bureau this summer.
"I'm looking forward to my time
in Russia," she said. "I think that it
will be very rewarding to be able to
serve on missions while I'm there, if
possible."
MSF was founded in 1971 by a
small group of French doctors who
wanted to respond rapidly and effec
tively to public health emergencies
as an autonomous organization, in
dependent from established coun-
tries and political powers.
Today, MSF employs more than
2,(XX) doctors, nurses and other med
ical professionals and logistics work
ers. They represent 45 nationalities
and work in more than 80 countries
worldwide.
"We are by nature an organiza
tion unable to tolerate indifference,
and we believe that it is both possible
and necessary to take action," said
Rony Brauman, co-founder of MSF,

in publicity materials.
MSF is, according to Reilley,
often the first relief organization to
arrive at the scene of an emergency.
The volunteers usually work in the
most remote or dangerous parts of
the world, dedicating as much as six
to 12 months at a time.
The organization, however, is
both private and nonprofit, relying
on public and corporate donations
for its operating expenses.
"Streaks of humanitarianism are
important to our society. Doctors
Without Borders is an integral part."
said Hsu.
