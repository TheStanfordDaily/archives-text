## Doctors to the rescue 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Volunteers from Stanford are re
sponding to public health emergen
cies in places that include some of the
world's most troubled and war-torn
countries.
Their efforts are coordinated
through an international nonprofit
organization called Doctors Without
Borders, often known by its French
name, Medecins Sans Frontieres.
Yesterday evening, as part of Pot
ter House's weekly seminar series on
global health perspectives, students
and faculty gathered to hear Brigg
Reilley talk about his work in Russia.
Reilley is the Head of Missions for
MSF in Russia.

Reilley lectured on the current
state of Russia's health-care system.
In particular, he discussed the grow

communicable diseases among the
18- to 22-year-old age group due to
sexual transmission and intravenous
drug use.
"The situation in Russia is be
coming increasingly worse," said
Reilley. "We needed to do our part
as humans to help."
As part of his 18-month tour of
duty in MSF's Moscow bureau, Reil
ley and his team worked to educate
young adults on the dangers of such
activity and its consequences, in a so
ciety where unsafe drug use is com
monplace.
"Working with Doctors Without

Borders was a great experience,"
said Evelyn Hsu. a sophomore who
volunteered in MSF's Los Angeles
office last summer. "It gave me a bet
ter overall perspective."
Hsu is scheduled to serve in the
Moscow bureau this summer.
"I'm looking forward to my time
in Russia," she said. "I think that it
will be very rewarding to be able to
serve on missions while I'm there, if
possible."
MSF was founded in 1971 by a
small group of French doctors who
wanted to respond rapidly and effec

as an autonomous organization, in
dependent from established coun-
