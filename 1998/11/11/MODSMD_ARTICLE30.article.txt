## Searching for Martian life on a meteorite 
### Wade Henning 
Two years ago, a team of scien
tists from NASA's Johnson Space
Center, lead by David McKay,
along with the research group of
Stanford Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, reported evidence of organic
material in a meteorite believed to
be from Mars. In August 19%,
their Science paper caused a sensa
tion .
Today, in 1998, the Mars mete
orite is still an object of intense
study.
While the sensation has worn
off, the debate about life elsewhere
in our solar system, which original
ly seemed doomed to arrive at a
negative conlusion, has become a
vigorous and booming new field of
research.
In 1976, NASA's two Viking
landers on the Red Planet reported
that the surface soil was completely
sterile. This observation stood until
1996, when McKay and his coau
thors opened a new chapter in the
Mars debate.
Last week, a group of scientists
from around the country gathered
at NASA's Ames Research Center
in Sunnyvale to establish a new or
ganization called the Astrobiology
Institute.
Carl Allen, a Planetary Scientist
from the space center, spoke last
Thursday in Branner I hill about his
involvement in the Mars meteorite

research and the Astrobiology Insi
titute.
"It's a very tough issue to try to
define life," Allen said. "We don't
know what's out there."
One of the tasks at the inaugural
meeting of the institute was exactly
that â€” to define what is meant by
astrobiology.
Zare illustrated the difficulty of
pinning down a definition for life
with an ad hoc definition.
"I could say life is a self-replicat
ing, self-organizing system that
obeys the laws of thermodynamics.
And do you know what I've just de
scribed? Fire, and even stars," Zare
said.
Immediately following their an
nouncement, the team comprised
of members from the space center
and Stanford called upon the scien
tific community to monitor the fee
back.
"They funded about 30 research
groups," Allen said.
The response was reminiscent of
the fervor that came in the wake of
their paper. In March of 1997, 20
papers were presented at the Lunar
and Planetary Science Conference
in Houston in response to the
team's claims.
The Martian meteorite they an
alyzed, named ALHB4OOI, con
tains the mineral carbonate in pan
cake-shaped globules along frac
tures in the rock. The hypothesis is
that water penetrated these fissures

and helped form both the carbon
ates and microbial life.
"Carbonate does not belong in
an igneous rock," Zare said. "This
is what we call secondary mineral
ization."
Much of the debate over the me
teorite centers on the temperature
of formation of the carbonate.
Teams have reported formation
temperatures of up to 700 degrees
Fahrenheit, and as low as 70; there
is still a wide disagreement. The
highest temperature survivable by
any known microorganism on
Earth is about 150 degrees Fahren
heit.
Another issue is the size of the
worm-like objects seen on scanning
electron micrographs of the car
bonate surfaces. At about 200
nanometers in length, these objects
were originally dismissed as too
small to hold the apparatus for a
cell. They are at least 10 times
smaller than any known bacteria
fossil on Earth.
But since 19%, scientists have
found objects in a sample called the
Columbia River Basalt, a similar
mineral to the basalt of ALHB4OOI.
These objects, also about 200
nanometers long, are virtually
identical to those seen in
ALHK4OOI. However, they have
not yet been identified as fossil
nanobacteria.
Zare noted that his method of
analytical chemistry, rapidly vapor-

I/ing samples with a high-powered
laser, cannot take samples from
these objects directly.
Space center researcher Kathie
Thomas-Keprta has made progress
in identifying magnetic mineral
crystals called magnetites in
ALHB4(H)I, which probably have a
biological origin.
"Birds have magnetite, bees
have magnetite. You can mess up
the way bees fly by holding a mag
net to a bee hive," Zare said.
Allen explained in his talk how
the magnetite grains may be used
by bacteria to sense vertical orien
tation. Bacteria on Earth are
known to produce similar grains of
magnetite.
In January 1997, the Seripps In
stitution of Oceanography and the
University of Arizona reported
that most of the organic material in
ALHB4OOI comes from Earth.

They studied concentrations of ra
dioactive carbon-14 (Cl 4), used for
age determination, in two key or
ganic molecules in the rock: amino
acids and polycyclic aromatic hy
drocarbons.
The surrounding carbonate had
no CI4, but the hydrocarbons and
amino acids did. Therefore, the hy
drocarbons were young, while the
carbonate was very old. contradict
ing earlier research.
The Scripps group also found
that most of the amino acids in the
meteorite had a property called
left-handed chiralitv, a fingerprint
of Earth organisms. They did, how
ever, find unexplained amounts of
right-handed alanine, which is
highly unusual in terrestrial life.
Zare and his students are em
barking on their owri search for
amino acids and paraffins in the
sample.

"A side project of mine is to look
for amino acids using capillary elec
trophoresis," said Tania Mahajan,
a doctoral student in chemistry.
Mahajan explained that the ap
paratus used to find polycyclic aro
matic hydrocarbons in the mete
orite could not be used to find other
kinds of organic molecules.
So far, researchers have only
been able to find molecules they
have made a deliberate attempt to
find. ALHB4OOI may contain all
kinds of substances that no one has
had the time or money to look for
yet.
"The possibilities are limitless,
so the only things we can work with
are the things we know," Mahajan
said.
Mahajan agreed with Zare that
ALHB4(X)I alone would not pro

Two photos of the ALHB4OOI meteorite found
Dec. 27, 1984. Prof. Richard Zare's study re
vealed that this meteorite may contain organic
J material which would signify life on Mars.

The Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. The apparatus collected information and images
and performed chemical analyses on the rocks at the surface of the planet. This photo is one of the im
ages it returned.
