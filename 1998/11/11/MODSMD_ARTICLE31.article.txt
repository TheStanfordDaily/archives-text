# Relieving the pain
## Determining the effect of drugs on different arthritis sufferers 
### Joanne Wu 
The risk of stomach bleeding
from non-steroidal anti-inflamma
tory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen
and naproxen has deterred people
with arthritis from using them for
decades. These people arc forced to
live with the arthritic pain. Howev
er, recent research done at the
School of Medicine has uncovered
new information and formulated a
questionnaire that can help weigh
the risks of such side effects.
Gukirpal Singh, clinical assistant
professor of immunology and
rheumatology, discovered that the
type of arthritis a person has influ
ences the risk of bleeding. Singh pro
posed that the difference in the oc
currence of lhis side effect reflects
the interaction between the medica
tion and the disease process.
"We have shown that the diagno
sis of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid
arthritis directly correlates with
stomach bleeding." said Singh in an
earlier statement. "But we had
never documented precisely what
the effects were and how much
[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs] people could take before
they were at risk."
The drug-related bleeding is
about 50 percent higher in rheuma
toid arthritis patients than in os
teoarthritis patients. Approximate
ly two million Americans suffer
from rheumatoid arthritis, the more
severe form of the disease, which in
volves a defect in the immune sys
tem. Osteoarthritis is the more com
mon form of arthritis, affecting ap
proximately 22 million Americans.
To measure the individual risk of
drug-related bleeding, Singh and his
colleagues have devised a simple
questionnaire, the SCORE test. The

questionnaire, which calculates the
risksand the benefits of the patient's
use of drugs such as aspirin, is based
on the case studies of 6,387 rheuma
toid and osteoarthritis patients.
"Millions of people throughout
the world are willing to take some
risk if it means relief from severe,
disabling pain. We need a risk / ben
efit system, and that's what we've
done," said Singh.
The test inquires about the pa
tient's age, overall health, type of
arthritis, previous history of gas
trointestinal bleeding, previous non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
side effect and length of time on
prednisone, a steroidal medication
prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis.
"Treatment strategies can be tai
lored to an individual's personal
needs and risk profile," Singh ex
plained.
Even using recommended doses
of over-the-counter non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs may cause
gastrointestinal bleeding in arthritic
people, Singh's studies confirmed.
He stressed that awareness is the
best protection against side effects.
"There has been much confusion
about [non-steroidal anti-inflamma
tory drugsj. Some people mistaken
ly believed that because they were
taking an over-the-counter dose,
they weren't at risk of side effects,"
Singh said.
As an alternative to non
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
for those with high risks, Singh rec
ommended different kinds of pain
relief such as acetaminophen. How
ever. this medication does not allevi
ate pain in everyone, and many
arthritis patients may have to con
tinue* using non-steroidal anti-in
flammatory drugs until new and ef
fective relief is found.
