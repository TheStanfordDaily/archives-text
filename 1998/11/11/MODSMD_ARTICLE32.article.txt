# Study adds up costs of fish farming
## 
### Jane Morril 
Americans consume thousands
of pounds of shrimp and salmon
each day, yet few stop to consider
the cost to nature for providing
these foods. An interdisciplinary
study released last week in the
journal Science analyzed the global
impacts of shrimp and salmon
farming on the environment.
"One of the main points the
study was trying to convey was that
shrimp and salmon aquaculture
was thought to be a good solution
to increasing food supply," ex

plained Stanford economist Rosa
mond Naylor, lead author of the
study. Aquaculture is the cultiva
tion of water plants and animals for
human use.
"However, at the scale at which
it now exists, we can no longer
manage the environmental conse
quences. These fish farms are hav
ing huge costs on the environ
ment," she said.
It is a common misconception
that fish farms add to the world's
food supply and prevent the deple
tion of ocean resources. Although
fish farms supplement the fish in

dustry by producing fish separate
from the ocean habitat, the report
found it to have a negative effect on
the ocean's ecosystem
The fish raised in the fish farms
are fed diets containing large
amounts of fish oil and meal, ex
tracted from fish caught from the
wild. Fish inputs fed to the farmed
salmon and shrimp measure any
where from two to four times the
volume of fjsh outputs — the actu
al shrimp and salmon produced
from the farms.
This shrimp and salmon aqua
culture is also having unforeseen
ecological consequences, accord
ing to the study. Conversion of
coastal ecosystems to fish farms de
stroys the environments that sup
port ocean fisheries. The shrimp
and salmon aquaculture destroys
coastal waters with a discharge of
pesticides.
In addition, the introduction of
foreign species of fish, particularly
salmon — which have been known
to escape from fish farms to the
ocean — can have harmful effects
on these ecosystems.
"Interbreeding with escaped
farmed salmon may lead to genetic
degradation of wild salmon popu
lations. especially since wild popu
lations have genetic characteristics
specific to the rivers where they
spawn," the report stated.
While developed countries reap
the benefits of shrimp and salmon
production, developing countries
bear the burdens of the costs, ac
cording to Harold Mooney, Stan
ford biology professor and a major
contributor to the study. Most
farmed shrimp are produced in de
veloping countries and exported to
industrialized countries in East
Asia, North America and Europe.
These industries provide food pri
marily for industrialized countries
without generating long-term in
come growth in poorer countries.

the study explained.
Despite the rapid growth of
shrimp aquaculture, the industry
has fallen into a boom-and-bust
pattern of production. In Taiwan, a
record-breaking 1986 shrimp crop
was followed by an utter collapse in
yields the next year. These same er
ratic production tendencies have
occurred in China, Thailand and
Indonesia.
"The fish farms in these devel
oping countries are struck by dis
eases, causing a boom-and-bust
cycle," said Naylor. "In the short
run, the countries receive foreign
exchange, but in the long run, their
ocean resources are being de
stroyed."
The report calls for economic
and political regulations on shrimp
and salmon to improve efficiency
and reduce the environmental im
pacts of this fish farming. Pollution
taxes, trade regulation and a reduc
tion of existing financial subsidies
on production are needed to re
duce environmental costs.
In addition, changes in trade re
strictions would help manage the
consequences of shrimp and
salmon aquaculture. Current trade
regimes allow restrictions on trade
for political reasons, but trade can
not be blocked due to the method
of production.
I he researchers hope to inform
the scientific community that aqua
culture is not a panacea for the
world's food supply. They also
hope to extend this knowledge to
consumers, who they hope will
help in the fight to reduce fish
farming.
"( onsumers see decreasing
salmon and shrimp prices and think
that aquaculture is a good thing,"
Naylor said. "We're hoping to get
much more awareness, particularly
on the consumer side. We want
consumers to act with their voices
and their votes."
