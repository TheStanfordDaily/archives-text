# Card burns past Marathon Oil
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
The preseason is a time of practice
for the Sixth Man Club, too.
The Stanford basketball student
section used last night's 90-82 exhibi
tion victory against Marathon as its
final warmup before the season.

■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford 90,
Marathon Oil 82. Exhibition

The Sixth Man Club ended last
night at a fever pitch, hanging around
to cheer and celebrate until the final
buzzer.
The problem?
They were cheering for a
Marathon player, former West Vir
ginia guard Sheldon Jefferson.
Jefferson, who led all scorers with
19 points, capped off an evening of
good-spirited "conversation" with
the Stanford students with the ulti
mate response — he drained his final
three pointers of the evening, each
time turning to the bleachers to taunt
the black-clad fanatics.
The amusing scenario was the
perfect way to end an otherwise unin
spiring Stanford win.
The Cardinal came out flat in the
first half, unable to crisply execute its
offense, and mustered just a two
point lead at the half, 37-35.
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery started the second half with a
group of five reserves, who promptly
stretched the lead from two to 17 with
seven minutes of hustle and solid of
fensive execution.

The starters eventually came back
to the floor, and once again seemed a
little distracted. Marathon rode solid
bench play to put the game's out
come in doubt late in the second half.
But the end, the C ardinal's depth
and overall team performance was
simply too much for Marathon.
But for the No. 3 team in the coun
try, the outcome was disappointing.
"We need to play a whole lot bet
ter than that to succeed this year,"
Montgomery said. "We had one
group of players that did not play
very well, and another that played re
ally well. Our timing, distribution and
effort were not consistent through
out the game. But we did have some
good performances off the bench."
In particular, junior forward Ryan
Mendez had 12 points, six rebounds
and three steals off the bench.
"I felt pretty comfortable sh(X)t
ing the ball tonight," Mendez said.
"In the first half, we were just going
through the motions. The second live
was a little bit hungrier, and played
real well."
The substitutes were not the only
ones who had success against
Marathon, as senior center Tim
Young led all Stanford players with
17 points and nine rebounds.
"I am not concerned with statis
tics," Young said. "I was mentally
and emotionally in the game, and
that is what I care about."
Junior forward Mark Madsen
added 12 points and five rebounds
for Stanford, while senior point
guard Arthur Lee chipped in 10
points and four assists.
