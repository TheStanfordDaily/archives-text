# Post office will stay put
## 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Representatives of the Univer
sity and the U.S. Postal Service are
finalizing negotiations on a long
term lease extension that, when
signed, will keep the post office in
its current location.
Ever since the 35-year lease be
tween Stanford Management
Company and the post office ex
pired in 1995, both groups have
been operating under a month-to
month agreement.
"When the lease extension is
signed, the post office will remain
in the same location," said Leonie
Batkin. manager of property ser
vices for Stanford Management

The Stanford Post Office will remain in its existing building in White
Plaza when a new long-term lease is signed in the near future.
Company. Batkin represents the
University in the negotiations.
The campus branch has been in its
current location since 1960. Howev
er, the student body had grown in
size, which is creating greater de
mands on the post office, according
to Glen Kwan. the Postal Service's
real estate specialist for the San Fran
cisco district.
"Stanford needs to respond with
an alternative facility to meet our
needs." Kwan said in 1996.
While the more urgent priority is
to sign the lease for the current loca
tion, the Postal Service's long term
goal is to move to a new site chosen
by the University that will augment
its service to the community and the
working conditions for its employ
ees. said Norma Jellison, real estate
manager of the Pacific Facilities Ser
vice Office. The firm deals with leas
es and acquisitions for all post offices
in California and Hawaii.
While Jellison noted that very few
universities even have post office
branches on campus, Stanford stu
dents continue to be dissatisfied with
the quality of service that the current
branch is providing.
In a 1997 Daily survey on quality
of service, over half of the students
polled ranked the post office as
"below average."

t is unfortunate that students
h to v jit so long for service," said
Eric Biown. a freshman.
"Students here don't have unlim
ited quantities of time to throw
around." he added.
Some students are less passionate.
"The line is not that bad," said
Sandy Jung, a freshman. "At Stan
ford. we don't have to wait in lines
too much."
Angry students held a protest two
years ago in response to the "poor
service here at the post office," said
Relief Jones, a senior at the time.
They cited inconsistent delivery, long
lines and poor customer service
among their chief complaints.
While the post office has been a
frequent target for criticism, some
students have had positive experi
ences there.
"My first experience with the post
office was great," said Brandon Fi
danque, a freshman. "I got my pack
age early and without any hassle."
But Batkin is unsure what the
ramifications of the lease will be for
service.
"Our negotiations do not include
operational changes. [The post of
fice] may be making some changes,
but we have no details on those plans
at this time." she said.
Because federal regulations pro
hibit on-site employees from issuing
statements, officials at the post office
were unavailable for comment on
the lease or its effects.
