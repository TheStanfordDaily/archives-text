# Educating educators
## STEP prepares tomorrow's teachers 
### Amber Johnson 
Look out — the days of dry lectures and ap
athetic students may be numbered. With the
help of Professor Linda Darling-Hammond
and the Stanford Teacher Education Program,
education is receiving a facelift.
"Teachers who are coming into the profes
sion can't just be looking at maintaining schools
the way they are," said Darling, a recent arrival
from the teachers' college at Columbia Univer
sity and the new faculty sponsor for STEP. "We
have to prepare teachers to be change agents as
well."
And change is happening fast. STEP, a 12-
month master's program in secondary educa
tion. became part of the School of Education in
1959. Recent work by Darling-Hammond and
others have helped the program gain national
attention.
"Now that Linda-Darling Hammond is
here, a lot of ideas ... can be put in motion,"
said Sylvia Garcia, Program Coordinator of
STEP.
Increasing diversity within STEP is one of
the program's highest priorities. "We want to
increase the minority enrollment and diversity
because [the current enrollment] doesn't re
flect what's in the schools." said Garcia. "It just
makes for better teachers."
Accord to Darling-Hammond, in the next
generation, the California secondary school
population will be 50 percent minority.
"It is very important for teachers to be pre

pared to understand cultures and language
backgrounds that children bring with them ...
if they're going to be successful in the class
room," she said.
In addition to helping teachers understand
cultural issues, STEP also encourages research
about learning styles and effective teaching.
"We're looking at the work of very success
ful teachers that have been successful with all
kinds of students," said Darling-Hammond.
"The program is very much focused on helping
prospective teachers gain a really deep under
standing of how students learn and how to use
the most effective methods within a subject
area."
While attending classes and specializing in a
single subject area. STEP students also partic
ipate in one-year student-teaching experience
under the supervision of practicing high school
teachers and scholars.
Many students teach locally at Gunn, Los
Altos, and Palo Alto schools, while other stu
dents prefer to travel out of the area. "A lot of
times STEP teachers choose not to do their stu
dent teaching in Palo Alto where the students
are predominantly white." added Garcia.
Darling-Hammond hopes to add another
component to the STEP program: board certi
fication. Until recently, teaching had no profes
sional board organizations. With the recent cre
ation of the National Hoard for Professional
Teaching Standards, in which Darline-Ham-
mond played a major role, teachers
can now undergo assessment and re
ceive certification.
It is estimated that fewer than half
of the California teachers who take
the test this year will pass. However,
Darling-Hammond hopes "to create
an expectation on the part of STEP
students that this is ... part of their
career paths."
Darling-Hammond, as director of
the National Commission on Teach

ing and America's Future, has also
defined other standards for educa
tion reform. The commission, in a
comprehensive report, recently out
lined recommendations for over
hauling the teaching profession.
Thirteen states, including California,
are currently implementing these
recommendations.
STEP alumni from around the
state will speak on Monday, Nov. 16
in Ujamaa and Tuesday, Nov. 17 in
El Centro Chicano. An open house
and recruitment will follow on Nov.
23 in the Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford at 7 p.m.
