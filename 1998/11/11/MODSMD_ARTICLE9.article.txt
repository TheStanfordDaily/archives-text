# Stanford aids Mitch victims
## Doctors, medicine and food flow to Central America 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Relief efforts to aid Cenral
American victims of Hurricane
Mitch have mobilized people
throughout the Stanford community
in efforts to provide food and med
ical care.
Maria-Cristina Urruela, a native
Guatemalan and a lecturer in the
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment, is raising money from mem
bers of the Stanford community for
flood relief. The funds will be used to
buy pharmaceuticals that will be
shipped to Guatemala.
"There are 19 Stanford doctors
who are going to Guatemalan cities
and they are going to bring some of
those pharmaceuticals with them,"
said Urruela. The medicines are
used primarily to vaccinate against
cholera, malaria and hepatitis,
which are running rampant due to
the flooding in Central America.
To date she has raised more than
$1,500. Children's Hospital Pharma
cist Robert Poole, who can buy
drugs at greatly reduced prices, will
use that money to buy a variety of
medical products that will by
shipped for free by Taca Airlines
later this week.
"There is a plane leaving [tomor

row] and another on Saturday," she
said. "It costs the airlines $15,000 in
fuel to do this so it is a great gift for
them to give."
Yarnil Saenz, a veterinary techni
cian in the Department of Compar
ative Medicine, pointed out that
these diseases are amplified in these
areas because "the flood waters
have killed the iguanas which eat the
mosquitoes, and the mosquitoes are
now multiplying and carrying a lot of
malaria and other diseases."
Saenz, a native Nicaraguan and a
trained veterinarian, plans to return
to his country later this week to pro
vide flood victims with medical care.
He plans to work out of a tent and
dispense vitamins, foods that are
easy to cook and medications for
malaria.
Last week Saenz approached the
Stanford Hospital, hoping the Office
of Human Resources would be in
terested in somehow aiding the re
lief effort. The hospital said it
"didn't want any publicity for help
ing Central America, because then
when there is a hurricane in Florida
or other disasters they will have to
help them, too," according to Saenz.
So, like other members of the
Nicaraguan community, Saenz will
coordinate his plans through con
tacts in his home country.

Elisa Vanini, a senior public poli
cy major, has also worked with the
Nicaraguan community on campus
and in the Bay Area.
"I have been going to San Fran
cisco twice a day to volunteer at the
consulate," she said. "They needed
help from people who were bilingual
and who had good organizational
skills."
Vanini says she is very pleased
with other Stanford students' reac
tions to the flood relief efforts.
"People don't have that much
time because this hit at a bad time
schedule-wise with midterms and
everything," she said. "But time is
the most precious donation that
people here can give. Overall I have
been very impressed."
Vanini stressed the idea that the
need for disaster relief will not end
soon.
"I am afraid that once media cov
erage ends people will forget. This
will have repercussions for years.
People need to keep volunteering
and keep checking on what is going
on," she said.
Food, monetary donations and
medical supplies are still being col
lected at Bechtel International Cen
ter. Urruela plans to ship all of the
donations that are received by to
morrow by plane.
