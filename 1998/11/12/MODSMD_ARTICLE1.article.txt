# Hum Bio short on cash flow
## 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
The number of Human Biology
majors has increased 46 percent and
enrollment in Human Biology class
es has increased 41 percent since
1991, but funding has not kept pace.
With such program expansion, a 9
percent increase in budget over the
same amount of time is inadequate,
according to program director Rus
sell Fernald.
Fernald noted the program's in
creased enrollment while conduct
ing an in-depth study, required of all
interdisciplinary programs. The re
view process, which does not apply
to regular departments, includes a
self-study report every five years.
Today, these findings will be re
ported to the Faculty Senate, which
will likely decide to continue the pro
gram by renewing its degree-granti
ng authority. However, funding
problems remain.
Human Biology's major problem
Simply put, "a 9 percent increase
in response to this huge increase in
student demand has been a problem.
" Fernald explained.
Human Biology is the second
largest major in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, graduating
about 12.5 percent of the school's
students.
"It's been hard for us to sustain
this effort with this small budget. If
you just took a 4 percent increase in
the budget each year [since 1991],
there would have been an increase of
31 percent." he said. "We haven't
even had an ordinary increase that
looks like inflation. The problem
with that is we are put in a real bind."
According to Biology Prof, and for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy, one of the founders of the
program, "although the endowment
has grown, we haven't gotten addi
tional support except two half billets
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences in the '705."
Human Biology would like to in
novate. but this move requires re
sources.

According to Fernald, the Web
based problem sets that started last
spring are an example of such inno
vation. "We would like to be com
puter savvy â€” use the computers in
ways that really help students and in
crease communication." he said.
The program also recently estab
lished three new tracks: health poli
cy. environmental policy and health
and human performance. "Those
tracks require finding people to
teach," Fernald said.
Finally, the Human Biology Pro
gram just launched a Service-Learn
ing Internship Program to help
under-served clinics in the area. This
program also requires financial sup
port.
"So every time we innovate,
we're up against the problem of how
you find the funds to do it," Fernald
said.
Original funding sources
In 1970, Human Biology was
founded with the financial support of
the Ford Foundation and several
Stanford donors. This substantial en
dowment was large enough to pay
for four half-time professors. At the
time, these were each worth
$4(X).(XX). In contrast, the funds re
quired to endow a professorship in
Human Biology today range be
tween S3 million and $4 million.
"The endowment was established
so that there could always be four
faculty members linked to the pro
gram," Kennedy said. "We wanted
to get secure commitments from se
nior faculty members to maintain a
primary commitment to the pro
gram,"
Founders wanted a firm commit
ment from outside faculty, but be
cause they were not establishing a
department, they were also worried
about securing future resources.
And. according to Fernald, their
fears were warranted. Funding has
not grown to match the program's
growth.
In 1991. the endowment support
ed 30 percent of the total operating
