# Hum Bio short on cash flow
## 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
The number of Human Biology
majors has increased 46 percent and
enrollment in Human Biology class
es has increased 41 percent since
1991, but funding has not kept pace.
With such program expansion, a 9
percent increase in budget over the
same amount of time is inadequate,
according to program director Rus
sell Fernald.
Fernald noted the program's in
creased enrollment while conduct
ing an in-depth study, required of all
interdisciplinary programs. The re
view process, which does not apply
to regular departments, includes a
self-study report every five years.
Today, these findings will be re
ported to the Faculty Senate, which
will likely decide to continue the pro
gram by renewing its degree-granti
ng authority. However, funding
problems remain.
Human Biology's major problem
Simply put, "a 9 percent increase
in response to this huge increase in
student demand has been a problem.
" Fernald explained.
Human Biology is the second
largest major in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, graduating
about 12.5 percent of the school's
students.
"It's been hard for us to sustain
this effort with this small budget. If
you just took a 4 percent increase in
the budget each year [since 1991],
there would have been an increase of
31 percent." he said. "We haven't
even had an ordinary increase that
looks like inflation. The problem
with that is we are put in a real bind."
According to Biology Prof, and for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy, one of the founders of the
program, "although the endowment
has grown, we haven't gotten addi
tional support except two half billets
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences in the '705."
Human Biology would like to in
novate. but this move requires re
sources.

According to Fernald, the Web
based problem sets that started last
spring are an example of such inno
vation. "We would like to be com
puter savvy â€” use the computers in
ways that really help students and in
crease communication." he said.
The program also recently estab
lished three new tracks: health poli
cy. environmental policy and health
and human performance. "Those
tracks require finding people to
teach," Fernald said.
Finally, the Human Biology Pro
gram just launched a Service-Learn
ing Internship Program to help
under-served clinics in the area. This
program also requires financial sup
port.
"So every time we innovate,
we're up against the problem of how
you find the funds to do it," Fernald
said.
Original funding sources
In 1970, Human Biology was
founded with the financial support of
the Ford Foundation and several
Stanford donors. This substantial en
dowment was large enough to pay
for four half-time professors. At the
time, these were each worth
$4(X).(XX). In contrast, the funds re
quired to endow a professorship in
Human Biology today range be
tween S3 million and $4 million.
"The endowment was established
so that there could always be four
faculty members linked to the pro
gram," Kennedy said. "We wanted
to get secure commitments from se
nior faculty members to maintain a
primary commitment to the pro
gram,"
Founders wanted a firm commit
ment from outside faculty, but be
cause they were not establishing a
department, they were also worried
about securing future resources.
And. according to Fernald, their
fears were warranted. Funding has
not grown to match the program's
growth.
In 1991. the endowment support
ed 30 percent of the total operating
costs, whereas now it covers 8() per
cent of the costs.
" That means we are 80 percent
paid for entirely by independent
funds," Fernald remarked.
Faculty billets
As Kennedy explained, each of
the Human Biology positions is a
half-professorship, also called a half
billet. Like all other interdisciplinary
programs, the program has no full
faculty billets.
Each of the Human Biology fac
ulty members spends half of the time
teaching in the Human Biology Pro
gram and the other half in the home
department.
The Human Biology endowment
covers half of the professor's salary.
The rest of the endowment goes to
wards operating costs.
As professors stop teaching and
give up their chairs, other faculty
members drop down to half-billets in
their home departments and take
over half-billets in the Human Biolo
gy Program.
Without the funding, though, it is
difficult to hold on to faculty.
"You can imagine the reality: I
am teaching both in psychology and

in Human Biology. There's the sense
that psychology isn't getting enough
of me, so [I] feel drawn between
these two commitments," Fernald
said. "And all of us who have en
dowed chairs have research enter
prises, so it's a challenging thing to
keep your balance."
Although the program has raised
other funds, these funds were estab
lished for specific purposes. For ex
ample, the Bingham Fund supports
innovative Human Biology student
projects.
Currently, Human Biology also
benefits from volunteer teaching.
"Volunteer in the sense that they
are working for less money than they
could make in the real world," Fer
nald clarified.
At least four faculty members
"volunteer" for the program.
Kennedy, the last of the orginal
founders still teaching, is not paid at
all by Human Biology, though he
teaches the core in the spring.
"He is essentially free to us," Fer
nald said. "But when he retires, we'll
have to replace him with somebody,
and we need a new half-billet to do
that."
University Aid
Fernald suggested that the School
of Humanities and Sciences could
start by designating half-billets in de

partments such as psychology, biolo
gy, economics, sociology and other
disciplines that integrate natural sci
ences and social sciences. Then, dur
ing a faculty search, these depart
ments would be able to kx)k for peo
ple willing to do half their teaching in
Human Biology.
However, Fernald said he recog
nizes the possibility of departmental
resistance because the department
would no longer have all of the facul
ty member's teaching time.Fernald
said the school could also help
Human Biology raise funds in order
to endow more chairs. A chair would
provide security for incoming facul
ty-
"An endowed chair is the only
way to pry someone loose from their
departmental commitment and say,
'Please now come and join the pro
gram,' he said. "And there are facul
ty members who would like to do
that. It's not a problem of interest."
General funds
Twenty percent of the program's
budget comes from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. According
to Assoc. Dean Hans Andersen, the
school determines monetary alloca
tions to programs by looking at the
previous year's budget and the in
crease of the budget given to the
school by the Provost.

"But then we are constantly mak
ing adjustments in response to fluctu
ating needs and special funding op
portunities," Anderson said.
Anderson explained that a num
ber of considerations affect the deci
sion to increase funds to a depart
ment or program. When making
funding decisions, the school consid
ers its fundamental mission, a com
parison of program needs, trade-offs
and other financial options.
'Hie main factors in funding are
the number of majors and number of
enrollments, said J uni Kim, acting di
rector finances at the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
" The money doesn't follow the
students in some sense, and one
might argue maybe it should," Fer
nald said. "Maybe there should be
some kind of reflection. Biology and
Human Biology together have 25
percent of undergraduate majors.
That's pretty remarkable."
Human Biology's status is some
what different, however, because it is
a program, not a department.
"It's hard to compare a depart
ment with a non-department," Kim
said. "Faculty reside in departments
only and are budgeted in depart
ments."
Furthermore, he said, "If money
is going to one larger area, then it
must be taken out of many smaller

units.
The school recognizes Human Biol
ogy's plight.
"Human Biology is our largest in
terdisciplinary program," Kim said.
"In the last six years, the program has
graduated an average of 150 stu
dents.
"Endowments aside. Human Bi
ology should get their fair share of
the budget,"he said.
Fernald said that Human Biology
should be treated differently from
other interdisciplinary programs be
cause of its size and course offerings.
"Other interdisciplinary pro
grams are much smaller," he said.
"They have no sustained core
course. And that's a big part of our
expense.
"The core course is a very large
enterprise, with six five-unit classes
over the course of a year, many fac
ulty and 10 course assistants," Fer
nald said. "There aren't any other in
terdisciplinary programs that have
that."
Fundraising
Programs can raise funds, but the
University makes no distinction be
tween money from endowments and
money from general funds. This
leads to a disincentive to raise funds,
according to Fernald. Moreover, de
partments and programs must get

permission to raise funds.

development for the School
manities and Sciences, explainecfthe

setting process based on a program's

The number of Human Biology
majors has increased 46 percent and
enrollment in Human Biology class
es has increased 41 percent since
1991, but funding has not kept pace.
With such program expansion, a 9
percent increase in budget over the
same amount of time is inadequate,
according to program director Rus
sell Fernald.
Fernald noted the program's in
creased enrollment while conduct
ing an in-depth study, required of all
interdisciplinary programs. The re
view process, which does not apply
to regular departments, includes a
self-study report every five years.
Today, these findings will be re
ported to the Faculty Senate, which
will likely decide to continue the pro
gram by renewing its degree-granti
ng authority. However, funding
problems remain.
Human Biology's major problem
Simply put, "a 9 percent increase
in response to this huge increase in
student demand has been a problem.
" Fernald explained.
Human Biology is the second
largest major in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, graduating
about 12.5 percent of the school's
students.
"It's been hard for us to sustain
this effort with this small budget. If
you just took a 4 percent increase in
the budget each year [since 1991],
there would have been an increase of
31 percent." he said. "We haven't
even had an ordinary increase that
looks like inflation. The problem
with that is we are put in a real bind."
According to Biology Prof, and for
mer University President Donald
Kennedy, one of the founders of the
program, "although the endowment
has grown, we haven't gotten addi
tional support except two half billets
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences in the '705."
Human Biology would like to in
novate. but this move requires re
sources.

According to Fernald, the Web
based problem sets that started last
spring are an example of such inno
vation. "We would like to be com
puter savvy â€” use the computers in
ways that really help students and in
crease communication." he said.
The program also recently estab
lished three new tracks: health poli
cy. environmental policy and health
and human performance. "Those
tracks require finding people to
teach," Fernald said.
Finally, the Human Biology Pro
gram just launched a Service-Learn
ing Internship Program to help
under-served clinics in the area. This
program also requires financial sup
port.
"So every time we innovate,
we're up against the problem of how
you find the funds to do it," Fernald
said.
Original funding sources
In 1970, Human Biology was
founded with the financial support of
the Ford Foundation and several
Stanford donors. This substantial en
dowment was large enough to pay
for four half-time professors. At the
time, these were each worth
$4(X).(XX). In contrast, the funds re
quired to endow a professorship in
Human Biology today range be
tween S3 million and $4 million.
"The endowment was established
so that there could always be four
faculty members linked to the pro
gram," Kennedy said. "We wanted
to get secure commitments from se
nior faculty members to maintain a
primary commitment to the pro
gram,"
Founders wanted a firm commit
ment from outside faculty, but be
cause they were not establishing a
department, they were also worried
about securing future resources.
And. according to Fernald, their
fears were warranted. Funding has
not grown to match the program's
growth.
In 1991. the endowment support
ed 30 percent of the total operating
costs, whereas now it covers 8() per
cent of the costs.
" That means we are 80 percent
paid for entirely by independent
funds," Fernald remarked.
Faculty billets
As Kennedy explained, each of
the Human Biology positions is a
half-professorship, also called a half
billet. Like all other interdisciplinary
programs, the program has no full
faculty billets.
Each of the Human Biology fac
ulty members spends half of the time
teaching in the Human Biology Pro
gram and the other half in the home
department.
The Human Biology endowment
covers half of the professor's salary.
The rest of the endowment goes to
wards operating costs.
As professors stop teaching and
give up their chairs, other faculty
members drop down to half-billets in
their home departments and take
over half-billets in the Human Biolo
gy Program.
Without the funding, though, it is
difficult to hold on to faculty.
"You can imagine the reality: I
am teaching both in psychology and

in Human Biology. There's the sense
that psychology isn't getting enough
of me, so [I] feel drawn between
these two commitments," Fernald
said. "And all of us who have en
dowed chairs have research enter
prises, so it's a challenging thing to
keep your balance."
Although the program has raised
other funds, these funds were estab
lished for specific purposes. For ex
ample, the Bingham Fund supports
innovative Human Biology student
projects.
Currently, Human Biology also
benefits from volunteer teaching.
"Volunteer in the sense that they
are working for less money than they
could make in the real world," Fer
nald clarified.
At least four faculty members
"volunteer" for the program.
Kennedy, the last of the orginal
founders still teaching, is not paid at
all by Human Biology, though he
teaches the core in the spring.
"He is essentially free to us," Fer
nald said. "But when he retires, we'll
have to replace him with somebody,
and we need a new half-billet to do
that."
University Aid
Fernald suggested that the School
of Humanities and Sciences could
start by designating half-billets in de

partments such as psychology, biolo
gy, economics, sociology and other
disciplines that integrate natural sci
ences and social sciences. Then, dur
ing a faculty search, these depart
ments would be able to kx)k for peo
ple willing to do half their teaching in
Human Biology.
However, Fernald said he recog
nizes the possibility of departmental
resistance because the department
would no longer have all of the facul
ty member's teaching time.Fernald
said the school could also help
Human Biology raise funds in order
to endow more chairs. A chair would
provide security for incoming facul
ty-
"An endowed chair is the only
way to pry someone loose from their
departmental commitment and say,
'Please now come and join the pro
gram,' he said. "And there are facul
ty members who would like to do
that. It's not a problem of interest."
General funds
Twenty percent of the program's
budget comes from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. According
to Assoc. Dean Hans Andersen, the
school determines monetary alloca
tions to programs by looking at the
previous year's budget and the in
crease of the budget given to the
school by the Provost.

"But then we are constantly mak
ing adjustments in response to fluctu
ating needs and special funding op
portunities," Anderson said.
Anderson explained that a num
ber of considerations affect the deci
sion to increase funds to a depart
ment or program. When making
funding decisions, the school consid
ers its fundamental mission, a com
parison of program needs, trade-offs
and other financial options.
'Hie main factors in funding are
the number of majors and number of
enrollments, said J uni Kim, acting di
rector finances at the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
" The money doesn't follow the
students in some sense, and one
might argue maybe it should," Fer
nald said. "Maybe there should be
some kind of reflection. Biology and
Human Biology together have 25
percent of undergraduate majors.
That's pretty remarkable."
Human Biology's status is some
what different, however, because it is
a program, not a department.
"It's hard to compare a depart
ment with a non-department," Kim
said. "Faculty reside in departments
only and are budgeted in depart
ments."
Furthermore, he said, "If money
is going to one larger area, then it
must be taken out of many smaller

units.
The school recognizes Human Biol
ogy's plight.
"Human Biology is our largest in
terdisciplinary program," Kim said.
"In the last six years, the program has
graduated an average of 150 stu
dents.
"Endowments aside. Human Bi
ology should get their fair share of
the budget,"he said.
Fernald said that Human Biology
should be treated differently from
other interdisciplinary programs be
cause of its size and course offerings.
"Other interdisciplinary pro
grams are much smaller," he said.
"They have no sustained core
course. And that's a big part of our
expense.
"The core course is a very large
enterprise, with six five-unit classes
over the course of a year, many fac
ulty and 10 course assistants," Fer
nald said. "There aren't any other in
terdisciplinary programs that have
that."
Fundraising
Programs can raise funds, but the
University makes no distinction be
tween money from endowments and
money from general funds. This
leads to a disincentive to raise funds,
according to Fernald. Moreover, de
partments and programs must get

permission to raise funds.

development for the School
manities and Sciences, explainecfthe

setting process based on a program's
