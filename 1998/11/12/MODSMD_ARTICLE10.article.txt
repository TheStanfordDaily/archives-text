# Newt Gingrich for President?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” On his way out of
Congress, Newt Gingrich is promising to explore
"many avenues for a public life," a phrase that has trig
gered speculation that he might be heading for the road
to the White House.
Gingrich isn't saying whether he will run for presi
dent in 2(MX). His closest advisers say he won't decide
for weeks or months. But as he ponders his future, pick
ing up the pieces from disappointing midterm elections,
Republicans are debating whether Gingrich could be a
serious contender.
Supporters argue that Gingrich is still a top party
fund-raiser and a leader with "big ideas" who energizes
audiences like no other Republican, including poll-top
ping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
"I'm a big fan of George W. Bush, but it's a long way
to go between now and ... 2(MK)," said longtime Gin
grich adviser Rich Galen.
Gingrich "has such incredible energy and intellect
that he would have the ability to drive the race by his
very presence," said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire
party leader who is helping former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander position for the 2(MK) race.
But others say Gingrich is too scarred by the wars of
Washington to make a serious run.
"It would defeat everything he's achieved with his
graceful exit from the House," said Republican media
consultant Alex Castellanos of Alexandria, Va. He said
Gingrich has been the GOP "point man" for too long.
"The good news is the point man gets to blaze the
trail. The bad news is you get shot full of bullet holes
doing it," Castellanos said.
Exit polls on Nov. 3 showed that nearly six of every
10 voters nationwide viewed Gingrich unfavorably.

Even in his home state of Georgia, he could muster
only a 47 percent favorable rating.
"His negatives are just too high." said Tom Slade,
chairman of the Florida GOP. though he called Gin
grich the party's most articulate spokesman and fund
raiser.
Gingrich's chances also might be hurt by perceptions
among conservatives that he capitulated too often in
negotiations with President Clinton.
"I think Newt did a lot of good things early on but as
a leader he got away from our message and that result
ed in what happened in the elections," said Tim Lam
bert of Texas, a leading conservative voice among
Republican National Committee members.
As for the midterm elections, Steve Grubbs, chair
man of the lowa Republican Party, said, "I think the
loss of five House seats was a very serious setback for a
Gingrich presidential run There is a lot of disap
pointment among the rank and file."
Yet critics and supporters alike say Gingrich's
chances might be helped by his decision to leave the
House. He could soon begin retooling his political
image, free of the bickering that helped cement his rep
utation as a Washington firebrand.
"The run is easier, if he decides to make it, by not
being burdened with the responsibility of speaker,"
said Slade, the Florida GOP chairman. "But the fact
that he had to resign as speaker in order to prevent a
very divisive situation in the House kind of speaks for
itself He's a polarizing figure."
Said Gingrich ally Galen: "He's got more time to
think about what he wants to say and how he wants to
say it because he's not spending 18 hours a day in meet
ings .... in the Capitol."
