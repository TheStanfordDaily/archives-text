# Tech gaffes abound in trial

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Per
haps Microsoft attorney John War
den explained it best: "There are a
few of us, including myself, who still
use fountain pens and legal pads."
And boy, does it show at the big
antitrust trial in Washington.
A case that's lull of technical jar
gon like ISPs, OEMs, NTs, and
CPUs may seem no place for tech
no-neophytes. Yet some key play
ers in the Microsoft trial sometimes
seem just that.
Could it be that Warden, Justice
Department attorney David Boies
and U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson are showing their
age when they stumble over tech
nology's lingo, seemingly less famil
iar with it than the average Bth grad
er?
The signs were apparent from
the beginning.
Take, for example, Boies'
repeated references to "American

Online," known to most people as
AMERICA Online, the world's
leading online service provider.
Then there was the day Boies
questioned a witness about a
"LOW-jin."
"Log in?" the witness offered.
"L-o-g, i-n?"
"Yes," Boies replied, realizing
his mistake.
"You're going fine," reassured
the witness, one of the nation's top
technology excecutives, Netscape's
James Barksdale.
"I was just testing to see whether
you were paying attention," Boies
said.
To be sure, the case is a compli
cated one for both the average per
son and the judge overseeing it
without a jury. And Jackson's unfa
miliarity with some of high-tech's
terms has been clear throughout.
"How do we know this is from
Microsoft?" he asked once, when

Warden introduced an e-mail note.
"Where it says, 'From:
Microsoft.com.' That's Microsoft,"
Warden explained.
"OK," the judge said, satisified.
More common, though, has been
this type of exchange: In a closed
meeting, Jackson urged Microsoft
attorney Warden to speed up his
cross-examination of a witness.
According to the transcript,
Warden said he would try hut he
wasn't as far along with the witness
as he had hoped.
The judge: "Well, he's not being
evasive."
Microsoft attorney: "Sometimes
he doesn't seem to understand [my
questions], but that's in good faith."
The judge: "Sometimes I don't
understand them, either."
Microsoft attorney: "Sometimes
I may not understand them myself."
With that, the judge said: "Let's
take a 10-minute recess."
