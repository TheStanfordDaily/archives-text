# Tension builds in the Gulf
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Clinton laid out
his case Wednesday for a possible attack on Iraq as the
Pentagon began a major buildup of American war
planes and troops in the Persian Gulf.
Allowing Saddam Hussein to flout the will of the
United Nations by rejecting weapons inspections
would only embolden him to "act recklessly." Clinton
said in a Veterans Day speech at Arlington National
Cemetery.
"We continue to hope — indeed, pray — that Sad
dam will comply," the president said. "But we must be
prepared to act if he does not."
Meanwhile, U.S. warships headed toward the Gulf
and Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered dozens
of Air Force fighters and bombers, additional Patriot
air-defense missiles and 3,(KX) soldiers to the area,
roughly doubling U.S. firepower.
"Nowhere is our vigilance more urgent than in the
Persian Gulf, where Saddam Hussein's regime threat
ens the stability of one of the most vital regions of the
world," Clinton said in a speech that suggested he was
still weighing his options.
Adding to the crisis atmosphere, the State Depart
ment withdrew as many as 2(X) nonessential personnel
and their families from embassies in Israel and Kuwait,
citing the mounting tensions since Iraq on Oct. 31
stopped cooperating with weapons inspectors of the a
U.N. Special Commission. The department also sug
gested private U.S. citizens in Kuwait should leave.
The United Nations withdrew several hundred
weapons inspectors and other U.N. staff from Baghdad
in light of the possibility of American airstrikes. The
U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting as
Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to Saddam to
immediately resume cooperation with inspectors.
Annan said he was "saddened and burdened" by Iraq's

defiance.
The Security Council passed a resolution this week
condemning Iraq's noncooperation, but it did not
include an explicit go-ahead for military action. The
Clinton administration contends that earlier resolu
tions on Iraq give it the right to use force, although
some U.N. members dispute that.
The timing of any possible U.S. action was unclear.
Clinton spent the afternoon on the golf course, and his
aides said he still planned to travel to Malaysia on Sat
urday for a meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooper
ation nations, although that trip probably would be
scrapped if airstrikes were ordered. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright put off her departure for Malaysia
from Thursday to Friday, spokesman James Rubin
said, to give her another day in Washington to deal with
the Iraq issue.
Clinton, in his speech, issued no explicit threat to
attack Iraq but made clear he believed that failure to
enforce the U.N.'s demands for arms inspections would
be a costly mistake.
"If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect
sites or monitor compliance at known production facil
ities, they may as well be in Baltimore, not Baghdad,"
Clinton said. " That would open a window of opportu
nity for Iraq to rebuild its arsenal of weapons and deliv
ery systems in months — I say again, in months — not
years.
"A failure to respond could embolden Saddam to
act recklessly, signaling to him that he can with impuni
ty develop these weapons of mass destruction or threat
en his neighbors," the president added.
White House officials said Clinton has decided that
he should publicly make the case that Iraq's behavior is
intolerable, while putting the onus on Saddam to fore
stall a possible military conflict.
