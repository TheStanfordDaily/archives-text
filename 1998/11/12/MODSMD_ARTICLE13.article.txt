# Israel passes peace agreement

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” The
Israeli Cabinet narrowly ratified the
peace agreement with the Palestini
ans today after a two-week delay
and some U.S. prodding, setting the
stage for a troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank by the
end of January.
The accord was approved by
eight of the 17 ministers after a
seven-hour debate. Five ministers
abstained and four voted against in
what appeared to be a political
blow for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who had expected
broader support.
Over the past two weeks, with
Netanyahu postponing Cabinet
debate four times, the United
States urged Israel to try and stick
to the original time table of the
land-for-security agreement.
President Clinton spoke with
Netanyahu on Tuesday night about
the deal and about the current U.S.
showdown with Iraq over weapons
inspections.
An Israeli official said the Unit
ed States has let it be known that its
policy of being tough on Iraq was
encountering problems in the Arab
world because Israel had not
moved forward on its implementa
tion of the agreement.
Saying that it was difficult to
"part with even one square cen
timeter" of the land, Netanyahu
attached four stipulations to the
agreement that could cause new
disruptions.
Under one of the conditions,
Netanyahu said he would bring
each stage of the phased pullback
over the next three months to the
Cabinet for separate approval. Min
isters will be asked to determine
whether the Palestinians have met
their security obligations under the
accord, he said.
Netanyahu also demanded that

the Palestine National Council hold
a formal vote by mid-December to
revoke clauses in the PLC) founding
charter that call for Israel's destruc
tion.
The third stipulation said Israel
reserved the right to annex areas of
the West Bank if Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat went ahead with
plans to unilaterally declare a Pales
tinian state in May, at the end of the
five-year autonomy period.
In a fourth clause, Netanyahu
said that in an additional pullback
to which Israel committed itself last
year, the Palestinians would receive
no more than 1 percent of the West
Bank.
Despite the new conditions,
Netanyahu pledged to go ahead
with implementing the agreement.
Israel has already fallen behind in
the 12-week time table negotiated
at least month's Mideast summit.

Netanyahu said he would permit
the opening of the Palestinian air
port next week and would also
begin releasing Palestinian security
prisoners at that time.
Another key Israeli commit
ment. to withdraw from 2 percent
of the West Bank by Monday, will
likely not be carried out on time,
said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-
Illan.
The troop redeployment cannot
take place until parliament as
approved the deal Tuesday and will
likely be carried out a week late.
Palestinian negotiator Hassan
Asfour said he believed Netanyahu
attached new conditions to please
Israeli hardliners.
"We appreciate the Cabinet
approval, but we will close our ears
and eyes to the conditions because
they are for them and not for us,"
Asfour told The Associated Press.
