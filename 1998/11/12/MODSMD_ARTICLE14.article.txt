New cigarette tax approved
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A ballot measure by actor-director
Rob Reiner increasing state cigarette taxes by 50 cents per pack to 112 und
children's programs was approved Wednesday on a count of late ballots
from the Nov. 3 election.
In one of the closest races of the general election, the initiative to help
finance various health care and education services for children was
approved by a margin of 57,070 votes among more than 7.6 million ballots
counted.
About one-third of the estimated 850,000 late absentee and provision
al ballots remain uncounted. But the initiative's lead has been growing
steadily since the election night count concluded with it leading by just
13,000 votes.
The tax increase from 37 cents to HI cents per pack takes effect Jan. 1.
The measure imposes proportional increases on other tobacco products.
The additional 24-cent-per-pack federal cigarette tax remains unchanged.
Critics said the measure would create a new bureaucracy and could
take away from programs now funded by existing cigarette taxes by cut
ting cigarette sales.

Bacterial infection found in brains of Alzheimer's
patients
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Infection of a person's brain cells by a type
of bacteria commonly found in the sinuses and lungs may raise the risk of
Alzheimer's disease late in life, researchers suggested Wednesday.
Scientists who examined brain tissue of Alzheimer's patients after they
died found a bacterium called Chlamydia pneumoniae had gotten into
cells in regions where Alzheimer's damage is detected.
The presence of the bacterium was unexpected, because it meant the
germ had to penetrate the protective blood-brain barrier.
Brian J. Balin, a researcher at Allegheny University of the Health Sci
ences in Philadelphia, presented the findings at a meeting in Los Angeles
of the Society for Neuroscience.
A top Alzheimer's expert called the findings exciting.
"I think that it's something that's really worth taking seriously because
of the issue of what's triggering the degeneration process," said Zaven
Khachaturian, a consultant to the Alzheimer's Association and former
director of the Office of Alzheimer's Disease Research at the National

Institutes of Health in Washington.
Invisible supernova?
Astronomers have discovered evidence that hundreds of years ago a
star exploded closer to Earth than any other known supernova. They just
can't figure out why no one back in the 13th century seems to have record
ed the blast, which should have been a spectacular sight.
The mystery suggests, among other things, that the astronomic records
are incomplete or that scientists have come across a new celestial phe
nomenon: invisible supernovas.
The supernova should have appeared for a year or more as the bright
est object in the night sky, except for the moon, around the year 1250.
Presumably, the great astronomers of the Orient should have been
able to see it just above the horizon, sometimes even during the day,
according to Bernd Aschenbach. one of the chief researchers.
But they made no known observations of it.
The explanation may be that the explosion of superheated gas and
radiation may not have given off visible light.
