Elected officials should
fulfill promises they made
to students and the country

WHILE MANY STANFORD stu
dents did not vote in last week's
elections, the results of the elec
tion are promising for students and the state
of California. II the candidates stick by their
campaign promises, students can benefit on
several different fronts.
In an election-night poll of college stu
dents around the nation conducted by the
National Student Campaign for Voter Reg
istration, students cited "education" and
"financial aid" as the issues they cared most
about. Taxes, abortion and the environ
ment also ranked high in the poll.
California Governor-elect Gray Davis
emphasized educational reform throughout
his campaign. Davis favors increasing the
states' role in public education through
increases in per student spending and
enhancing peer evaluation and teacher cre
dent ialing requirements.
California public schools will definitely
need more funding over the next few years
as technology improves and more students
enroll in already overcrowded schools. If
Davis is serious about using more state
funds to benefit local school districts, par
ents and universities throughout California
will benefit.
Davis also expressed concern about off
shore oil drilling projects during the cam
paign. We strongly urge Davis to follow
through on his commitment to support a
permanent ban on offshore drilling.
In the national realm. Sen. Barbara

Boxer also focused on educational and
environmental issues. During her previous
term. Boxer supported the Higher Edua
tion Act, a bill that reduces student loan
interest rates by 1 percent and allows for a
forgiveness of $5,500 in the repayment of
these loans. We urge her to continue to
keep college students in mind as university
tuitions continue to rise and the next
Congress decides how to allocate predicted
budget surpluses
Boxer also sponsored an amendment to
the Safe Drinking Water Act which
required the Environmental Protection
Agency to conduct in-depth studies of the
health effect of trace water contaminants
on children and the elderly. Boxer should
continue to assist vulnerable groups in a
political climate dominated by a weak pres
ident and a Republican Congress.
Across the country, the election of more
Democrats signaled the publics frustration
with Congressional hangups over President
Clinton's actions and the lack of Republi
can policy reform in the Congress. We look
forward to a new Congress characterized by
clear policy objectives and a recognition of
the public's interest in cooperation rather
than partisan bickering.
We also hope students maintain an inter
est and sound their voices in the political
debates that will emerge over the next two
years. While it often seems that voting or
expressing an opinion doesn't have any
impact, collective participation does influ
ence political decisions, and it is only
through such participation that our repre
sentatives will continue to push for reform
in issues of concern. In an era of mass
polling and instant media coverage, politi
cians will fight hardest for those who
promise their consistent and vocal support.
