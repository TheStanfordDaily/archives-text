## How to become a nicer person 
### 
ARE YOU A nice
person? Think
about it. I'm not
sure if there's really an
easy answer to that ques
tion. Sure, we're all fine
and dandy — perfect
human beings and blah

blah blah — but are you really nice?
"Nice" is one of those words you're not
supposed to use past second grade.
Remember when it was the only adjective
in your vocabulary? "How was school,
honey?" "Nice." "Do you like Mikey?"
"Yes, he's nice." "How many fingers am I
holding up?" "Nice."
With so much use and abuse, it's no sur
prise that we've banished the word from
any sort of formal speaking. Ever since our
elementary school teachers told us that
"nice" loses its effect when used in every
other sentence, we've been in search of
replacement adjectives. "School was tolera
ble. Mikey is friendly. You're holding up
four fingers, Mom." We've certainly
learned a lot, haven't we? (Insert collective
sigh )
Regardless of eight-year-olds' overuse of
the word, the principle of "nice" remains
the same. It's the whole Golden Rule thingy
balled up into four letters. You remember
the Golden Rule. Treat your neighbor as
you would like to be treated, right? How
about "Be nice"? Pretty simple, eh?
Being nice isn't as easy as defining it,
though. It takes a lot of effort to truly be
nice. You have to smile most of the time.
Sometimes you have to act charitably, or at

least unselfishly. Occasionally you have to
respect others. You can't really smack peo
ple, even when they're out of line. At least
not hard.
It's a tall order, isn't it? Clearly, we can't
all be perfect. If we could, there would be
no war, no final exams and no LSJUMB.
We'd have a completely different existence.
We can, however, make slight attempts at
being nicer. I don't think Saddam will join
the Peace Corps, and the Band probaby
won't start to march like the bands at other
boring colleges (phew), but our world may
be a little better if we adhere to the follow
ing rules. I'll try if you will. Pinky swear?
Bike on the right-hand side of the road,
especially around the Clock Tower. Try not
to cut in line at the salad bar (if you do by
accident, smile sheepishly and say you're
sorry). Wait until the end of lecture to close
your notebook, or close it quietly if you
absolutely have to. Leave your loose change
in "tip" jars. Wipe the Stairmaster down
after you sweat all over it. Skip class for a
friend. Don't make fun of a cappella (Oops!
Never mind. I didn't say we had to be per
fect.).
Tell people when they have food in their
teeth or boogers in their nose (subtly).
Scoot over to make room on the couch,
even if it's already packed. Sit in the middle
of a row instead of at the end. Introduce
people. Don't really "screw" your room
mate (in terms of his or her date, for those
of you with gutter minds). Hide your cross
word puzzle from the professor. Vacuum
someone else's room, as long as you have
the vacuum cleaner out. Make faces at

babies but don't frighten their mothers.
Turn the bass down after midnight, even if
it is your favorite song. Pick up a piece (dr
pieces) of trash.
Bring a leftover tray back into the dining
hall. Clap a little louder than you think you
should. Listen for a while before givihg
advice. Lend your best friend your car when
he or she finally gets the nerve to ask some
one out. Share the excitement of someone
else's "A," even if the test absolutely rocked
you. Fold the random laundry you firtd in
the dryer. After you sneeze, don't pretend
you didn't just shoot snot all over your
hands — wash them. Write something
funny on the cover of your blue book. Stop
for pedestrians. Tell someone not to worry
about his or her GPA. Finally, keep finding
ways to be nice.
Are you a nice person? Sure, everybody
is. We go to school at Stanford, after all.
Despite this near-perfection, though, no
one (even at Stanford) is without need of
niceness training. There are countless other
ways in which we can become warmer indi
viduals, better human beings and friendlier
to animals. All of us. I don't think anyone
can say they follow all of the above rules, so
let's get cracking. Just like in second grade,
I'll answer the usual question with the usual
answer. • *.
What do I want to be when I grow up?
Nice.

policy. He warns you against saying "nice"
aloud over and over again. Pretty soon it
won't make sense any more.
