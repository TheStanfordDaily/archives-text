Letter hurts Muslims
On Nov. 10. a letter was published in the
Daily accusing the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network, incorrectly referred to as the
Stanford Muslim Organization, of sponsor
ing a "terrorist" speaker at Stanford. The
author, Krishna Mahesh, was referring to
MirWaiz Umar Farooq, leader of the Kash
miri Muslims, whose talk at Stanford last
month was sponsored by MSAN as well as
Pakistanis at Stanford. For the record, Mir-
Waiz Umar neither asked for nor received
any money from these organizations.
This hateful and biased letter has caused
great pain in Stanford's Muslim community.
Muslims do not condone terrorism. Indeed,
they are commanded to reject it by the Holy
Our'an.
We invited MirWaiz because the All-
Parties Hurriyat Conference, which he rep
resents. advocates a peaceful political solu
tion to a conflict, based on the right of the
Kashmiri people to self-determination. The
AI'HC does not represent Pakistan. If the
author had actually attended the talk which
he criticizes so harshly, he would know that
the APHC includes Hindus and other non-
Muslims in its ranks and does not envision a
Muslim state in Kashmir. He would know
that, in a state where the militarv unleashes

gang-rape squads against Kashmiris and
tortures thousands, there is a difference
between terrorism and self-defense. Unfor
tunately, all Mr. Mahesh can do is recite the
Indian government's Web page propagan
da and popularize Islamophobia.
The author goes on to compare the
AI'HC with Hamas and the Taliban, groups
which have nothing in common except that
they consist mostly of Muslims. This kind of
labeling underscores the need for organiza
tions like MSAN to provide a forum for
oppressed, unrepresented groups like the
Kashmiris to present their cause.
Mr. Mashesh was totally out of line.
Muslims reject all violence against innocent
people. We hope that this dangerous letter
will not damage the positive image of Mus
lims that prevails at Stanford.

UCLA fans harsh too
I would like to address Mrs. Foster-Dub
bins letter entitled, "Ashamed of Stanford
Fans." which appeared in the Nov. 9 Daily.
According to Mrs. Foster-Dubbin's letter,
those of us who attended the UCLA / Stan

ford football game were "ugly, vicious, and
an embarrassment to our beautiful school,"
and we "should be ashamed of ourselves."
Mrs. Foster-Dubbins is obviously not fully
informed of every action of every single one
of the thousands of UCLA fans who also
attended the game.
While weaving our way through a sea of
UCLA tailgate parties on our way into the
football game, the defenseless island of
Stanford students was greated with com
ments like, "Stanford sucks! You guys
drove all the way down here to lose by 28
points!", "Go home!", and "We're going to
kick your ass."
During the game, we were harassed by
UCLA fans, and horribly outnumbered.
Regardless of whether they won or not, our
team beat incredible odds. When Stanford
started winning the football game, we were
victorious. Of course Mrs. Foster-Dubbins
noticed the few instances of unruly Stanford
behavior; there were only a few hundred of
us in a huge stadium of sulking UCLA fans.
I cannot account for the actions of all
Stanford students who went to the game,
but what I saw was just a lot of enthusiam
for the underdog. The fact that we drove
along scenic Interstate 5 for six hours to be
outnumbered and harassed by UCLA fans
on the enemy territory of a team that was
supposed to have an effortless victory says a

lot about our school spirit. Maybe our
ecstatic behavior annoyed the thousands of
gloating UCLA fans who told us before the
game not to waste our money watching our
team get smashed. I would hardly call our
behavior a "disgrace to our beautiful"
school. Wouldn't it have been more dis
graceful if no one had even showed up to
support our team?

Vote was democratic
I was disturbed by Dan Geyser's Nov. 10
column which equated majority rule with
fascism. Both the government and the Uni
versity "restrict students' actions and prac
tices" all the time. The unique thing about
the way in which the grapes vote restricts
student action is that it is democratic.
For once, the students have a direct say
in the policies that govern them. I would
prefer majority rule to normal University
decision-making (remember Alpha Sig?)
that does not listen to student voices.
While I admire Geyser's ideal of grape
education without the vote, it is a little
naive. Stanford students tend to be apathet
ic if they think an issue doesn't affect them.

By forcing an explicit, rather than implicit,
decision, the grape vote teaches that neither
individuals nor institutions can avoid poli
tics. For Stanford, as an institution, to allow
dining halls to serve any grapes is in§tjju
tionally to reject the boycott and de fafto
support the growers against UFW. The
grape vote forces students to learn outside
of their classes; consider it a GER with sig
nificance. t ♦
Geyser paints a picture of a slippery
slope of students instituting vote£ on
whether to eliminate the humanities, but his
argument trivializes the struggles of both
the farm workers and the students Who
went on a hunger strike to get the grapes
vote. Students went on strike
lations of workers' rights are a life-jlhd
death issue. And while it is unlikely'that
enough students would be committed
enough to go on a hunger strike for najuiy
other issues, I welcome the opportunilj'to
further democratize University decision
making and make students truly educate
themselves about other political .
In the meantime, I hope to see Geyser at
the Dolores Huerta speech on Thupijay
night, living up to his ideal of learning tftJout
labor issues without coercion.
