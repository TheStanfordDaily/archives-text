# Shuttle to run Friday and Saturday nights from 8 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
## Marguerite hours extended 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Friday will mark the beginning of the Marguerite Mid
night Express — a new route designed to provide the
Stanford community with free weekend transportation
around campus and Palo Alto from 8:(X) p.m. until 2:30
a.m.
The move to extend the Marguerite shuttle service to
Friday and Saturday nights was announced at an ASSU
Senate meeting earlier this week as part of an initiative to
improve campus safety.
According to ASSU President Maren Norton, the idea
to expand the free transportation service has been in the
works since last spring. She is pleased that this year's
ASSU is able to deliver on what was a major platform
issue in last year's elections.
Norton thinks the new service will provide a safe trans
portation alternative for those students who socialize off
campus. and may even tempt some Palo Alto businesses
to stay open later.
"Palo Alto may not be the be-all and end-all of social
scenes, but there are bars and restaurants for students to
go to." Norton said. "If we can provide access to them.

there may be an incentive for own
ers to keep things open later.'
The Midnight Express also
meets a need for students who use
Caltrain to get back and torth to
cities such as San Francisco. Stops at
the Caltrain station have been
planned to correspond with train ar
rivals, with the last pick-up sched
uled for 2:(X) a.m.
"I think that's great," said Tsitsi
Jaji, a first year graduate student in
comparative literature. "If you ar
rive back from San Francisco at
night, you always have to decide if
you're going to walk home in the
dark or pay for a cab, which can cost
as much as the train ticket to San
Francisco."
Jaji added that, as a woman, she's
particularly relieved this service is
finally being offered.
"I think it's very important, espe
cially because of recent events on
campus," she said, referring to the
assault of a woman near Roble Field
last month.
The launch of the new service has
been timed to coincide with this
year's Freshman Formal, which will
take place on Friday. Because
Transportation Programs expect a
higher number of passengers this
weekend, two shuttles will circle the
new route.
Normally, only one bus with
seating for 30 to 35 people will be in
service, with stops every half-hour
at the Stanford Shopping Center,
the Caltrain station, the Medical
School, West residences, Tresidder
Memorial Union, Rains Houses and
Escondido Village, among other

stops.
The Midnight Express will be
run as a pilot project for the remain
der of the academic year. A Special
President's Account administered
by James Montoya, vice provost for
student affairs, will cover costs in
curred by the initial phase tft.the
project, according to Norton.;-;*
The ASSU is still looking at ways
to fund the late-night service in the
future. Currently, funding for the
regular Marguerite shuttle service
comes out of faculty parking permit
fees.
Norton said that one option for
funding the Midnight Express is to
take a percentage of student park
ing permit fees. This could result in
an increase in next year's fees. How
ever. Norton said that any increase
would be small.
"It'd be a couple of dollhrt —
nothing major," Norton said.
Susan Law, the administrative
services manager at Facilities Oper
ations, says that besides increasing
campus safety, the new service may
also address another problem on
campus: parking.
"If we can provide better service,
perhaps we can convince some stu
dents that they don't need a car on
campus, and they can leave their
cars at home," Law said.
And if more students use the
Marguerite than drive, that would
represent a positive step towards
improving air quality. Law said.
The new route is the realization
of one of many ideas to improve and
expand Stanford's shuttle service.
Another idea is to include alroute
that would stop at the Safeway in
Menlo Park at "student-frjejKlly
hours," said Norton. "But we have
to take it one step at a time." ,
