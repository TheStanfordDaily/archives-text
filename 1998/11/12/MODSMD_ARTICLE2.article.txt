## Marguerite hours extended 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Friday will mark the beginning of the Marguerite Mid
night Express — a new route designed to provide the
Stanford community with free weekend transportation
around campus and Palo Alto from 8:(X) p.m. until 2:30
a.m.
The move to extend the Marguerite shuttle service to
Friday and Saturday nights was announced at an ASSU
Senate meeting earlier this week as part of an initiative to
improve campus safety.
According to ASSU President Maren Norton, the idea
to expand the free transportation service has been in the
works since last spring. She is pleased that this year's
ASSU is able to deliver on what was a major platform
issue in last year's elections.
Norton thinks the new service will provide a safe trans
portation alternative for those students who socialize off
campus. and may even tempt some Palo Alto businesses
to stay open later.
"Palo Alto may not be the be-all and end-all of social
scenes, but there are bars and restaurants for students to
go to." Norton said. "If we can provide access to them.
