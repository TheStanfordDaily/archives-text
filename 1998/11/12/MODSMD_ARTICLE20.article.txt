# Good, clean fun
## â€˜To have a little salt in your pumpkin'

I AM DEFINITELY an old dog strug
gling with the famous "new trick." And 1
am not entirely sure that is a good thing.
,_ .1 remember being a little thing, maybe
Jivw or six years old. I joyously bounded
from school one day glowing from ear
to ear. In gym class that day I had mastered
Forward Roll.
is far as 1 was concerned, with my new
was pretty much Mary Lou Retton.
Autl so 1 rolled. All day. I convinced my sis-
roll with me. Out on the lawn, until we
.jryuiJe ourselves sick, we rolled down the hill.
, , Naturally, the moment my father pulled
in|Jl}e driveway, I ran over, pulled open the
dgjjj- and dragged him out. "Look!" And
Jnere 1 was. rolling away, utterly unstop
pable. rolling here, rolling there, completely
'eijgrossed in my dizzy little world.
1 thought Dad was pretty darn impressed.
Perhaps too impressed, because after I fin
ished my Olympic-caliber rolling floor rou
ting, he clapped and clapped, certainly
pleased with the amazing skill and grace of
/ his voungest daughter. It was then that I
decided that he too should know the beauty
offhe Forward Roll. I shared this idea with
ii io

my sister and she uncategorically agreed.
We went scampering up to the house,
nearly shaking with anticipation. As we
plowed through the door. Dad was hit by a
mass of unbridled energy. We explained
what we meant to do, and speculated on his
potential. Somehow, swept up in our
moment, he agreed to give it a try.
So here begins a very scary scene: Two lit
tle girls, under the age of 10, at the peak of
flexibility, malleability, and excitability and
one nearing middle-aged man, admittedly in
good shape and as lean as a greyhound (a
trait not necessarily passed on by genetics),
but with slightly failing levels of elasticity.
None the less, I proceeded with The Plan,
completely oblivious to the small whiff of
danger in trying to get my dad's long, skinny
frame rolled up small enough to fit under the
dinning room table.
To spare you the details of The Accident,
I'll just say this: Men over forty should not
ever try to learn gymnastics.
Nature had delivered a cruel punishment
for age and over-ambitious activities involv
ing flexibility. And dad. though a trooper,
didn't have it in his heart to just say no.

This left me convinced at a very young
age that there are some things you get too old
to learn.
Now, at the ripe old age of 21, this
prophecy has come back to haunt me.
I am finishing my last year at this
esteemed institution so 1 may "get on with it"
and begin The Real Stuff. This is a year
meant to be smooth sailing. Minimal classes,
all within my major, my last quarter just
working on my honors project.
Then all of a sudden, about a week a go, I
found myself enrolled in 21 units, working
like a dog and getting my ass kicked. Not
only was I not taking a single class in my
major, I decided to take my math DR and a
language of which I had no previous knowl
edge.
I took high school calculus, but any
predilection towards numbers and Greek let
ters had been completely lost during fresh
man year. Statistics was finally dropped, to
be retaken at a time TBA.
But even after my merciful wiggle out of
the realm of factorials and summations, I am
still left with Italian 1. Beginning Italian.
Sounds easy enough.

I am afraid not. This old dog has never
worked so hard at something and done so
poorly! And I really try. I do my homework,
go to every class, watch Italian videos, listen
to Italian music, but to no avail. 1 have the
language propensity of a bran muffin.
What makes it even worse is that, for
whatever banal reasdti, I took five years of
high school Latin. And you know what? It
ain't helping squat.
Yesterday in class, as we were circling
about completing a verbal exercise, my turn
landed on a question about the marriage of
"/c engine delta nuima." I asked why in the
world someone would marry the "kitchen of
the mother." The class laughed. At me.
My teacher gently broke it to me: la cuci
na means "the kitchen," la cugina means
"the cousin."
He asked me about una lavagna and I said
"lo mango." I eat it. Unfortunately for me,
lavagna sounds an awful lot like lasagna. One
is a tasty pasta treat. The other is a chalk
board.
1 didn't have a clue. On a recent quiz, we
watched a video about three people, includ
ing one named Marriane, speaking incredi

bly quickly on a train, going somewhere,
coming from somewhere, confusing the hell
out of me. In the subsequent quiz, question
four read, "Come sono i capelli di Mari
anne?"
1 wrote "Marrianne put her bags over
head." When the quiz was returned with a
dismally low grade, there written in big red
letters was, "Actually, the question reads
'What color is her hair?' "
Brown. The answer was brown.
So here I am, trying as hard as my dad all
those years ago: trying to be flexible. Staring
in wonderment at endless irregular conjuga
tions. Utterly confused about objects and
prepositions which I am not sure I totally
understand in English.
But for this cane vecchio, old dog, I am
trying. I'm marking the difference between
penne and pent in big red letters. I'm trying
to be flexible but I'm ending up dangerously
near the edge.

Vanessa is a senior majoring in music who
wants to graduate. Ha poco sale in zucca, but
that's never stopped her before.
