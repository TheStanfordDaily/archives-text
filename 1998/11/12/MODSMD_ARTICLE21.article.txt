# Student takes Mtn. View council seat

There is no shortage of people
with high-minded political aspira
tions at Stanford, and many students
likely will go on to serve their com
munities and nation by seeking elec
tion at the local, state or national
level.
One Stanford student decided not
to wait.
Sally Lieber, a senior Political Sci
ence major, was elected to the seven
member Mountain View City Coun
cil on November 3. The council
meets every two weeks, and mem
bers must serve on committees that
meet separately to target specific is
sues in the community. The council
also appoints people to city boards.
"Community service is the dri
ving force in my life," said Lieber.
"Deciding to run was a natural out
growth of that."
For the past several years, Lieber
has been active in a variety of com
munity organizations. She tutors
adult learners at the Mountain View-
Los Altos Adult School and coordi
nates a mentoring program at Alta
Vista High School. Lieber also is
president of the Alliance for a New
Moffett Field. In 199N, the Mountain
View Voice and the Chamber of
Commerce awarded her the 1998
Outstanding Community Leader
Award.

Lieber, who is 37, came to Stan
ford two years ago after transferring
from community college. Before
that, she owned her own business.
Lieber said that she feels she has
gotten more out of Stanford as an
older student, and that her political
life off-campus has enhanced her
academic one. She said she tries to
set priorities in order to balance fam
ily, community service and Stanford.
She said, "Stanford can be really
overwhelming. [But) a lot of times
my life outside of Stanford gives me
a perspective on my studies, and vice

versa."
Lieber said her in
terest in politics
began when she
was very young.
"As a kid I kept
elaborate charts of
who served on
congressional
committees. I was

obsessed with politics All of my
heroes were political figures."
For many years, Lieber was active
in statewide political campaigns.
When she decided to run for local of
fice several years ago, Lieber says
she read everything she could find
about the topic. She also attended a
political training session given hy the
National Women's Political Caucus.
By early summer, Lieber and her
campaign staff began studying the

views and concerns of Mountain
View's voters. Based on previous
elections, they decided how many
votes they would need to win and
which precincts they should visit.
Lieber says she then began
"precinct walking," going door-to
door to introduce herself to regis
tered voters, explain her platform,
and learn which issues mattered
most to the community.
In her campaign, Lieber focused
on youth issues, sustainable growth
in Mountain View and the future of
Moffett Field.
As Silicon Valley continues to ex
pand, much local political discussion
has focused on the benefits and costs
of this growth. Lieber said that con
cerns abound regarding the lack of
affordable housing and increased
traffic levels.
In her campaign, Lieber advocat
ed redoing Mountain View's general
plan for growth and linking housing
density to mass transit to encourage
the use of public forms of transporta
tion.
Lieber worked with 10 core cam
paign volunteers and one campaign
manager. She says her manager, a
friend of hers, was indispensable dur
ing the campaign process.
"[None of my previous work] re
ally prepared me for my own cam
paign. It's just a huge commitment
There are just so many decisions

every day."
Lieber said that many of the orga
nizations which endorsed her sent
lengthy questionnaires asking about
her views on a variety of issues. Fill
ing out paperwork such as this was a
time-consuming endeavor, said
Lieber.
She and six other candidates,
three of whom were incumbents,
competed for three Council posi
tions. Lieber was the top vote-getter,
capturing 53 percent of the votes.
Terms last four years, with a two
term limit.
Presently, Lieber is working on an
honors thesis under the guidance of
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, whom Lieber says inspired
and encouraged her to run for office.
"He's been the number one positive
influence on me at Stanford," she
said.
In the future, Lieber said she
hopes to return to Stanford for a
master's degree, probably in educa
tion policy.
"I've always believed that no mat
ter where I was, I could improve
[that] place," said Lieber.
"I think that something that
comes up all the time at Stanford is
the power of one. I'm proud to be
part of Stanford because that's part
of the tradition â€” that each person
can make a contribution to better the
lives of others."
