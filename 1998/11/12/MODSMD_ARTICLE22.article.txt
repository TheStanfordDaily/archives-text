WOMEN'S SOCCER
■ Yesterday: No. 14 BYU defeated
Stanford, 6-1.

Although the Cardinal expected
a challenge in its first appearance in
NCAA tournament competition
since 19%, Stanford did not antici
pate the magnitude of this task.
The Brigham Young Cougars
(19-4) ended the Cardinal's NCAA
tournament ambitions in the first
round with a 6-1 rout in tempera
tures which hovered near freezing.
Although Stanford pressed the
Cougars to overtime during a pre
season matchup, yesterday's game
w£s a different scenario.
Bigger stakes and challenging
playing conditions differentiated

this game from that preseason
match.
BYU's home-field advantage,
however, coupled with Stanford's
lack of experience in harsh weath
er, created a distinct advantage for
the Cougars.
After BYU secured a 4-0 half
time lead, it was evident that spec
tators would not receive a repeat
performance of that October pre
season battle.
The Cardinal failed to silence
BYU's threatening scoring trio of
Shauna Rohbock, Maren Hender
shot and Sara Reading.
Cougar sophomore Reading's
early goal in only the fifth minute of
play established BYU's momen
tum for the remainder of the game
and frustrated the Stanford squad.
Reading scored on a header off a
direct kick from teammate mid
fielder Karen Robbins.
In her final season playing for
the Cougars. Rohbock, an AU-
American forward, leads the team
in points with 51 and goals with 21.
Yesterday's performance was

on par with her standard as she
scored twice within the first 25 min
utes of play.
Hendershot's goal in the 41st
minute of play, her 19th of the sea
son, provided yet another safety
goal for the Cougars.
BYU demonstrated its assur
ance with its lead in the second half
by substituting less experienced
players for its starters.
This opportunity enabled two
BYU players, Janet Jensen and
Kristy Detton, to score their first
goals of the season.
Despite these substitutions, the
Cardinal only managed one goal
during this half.
Senior midfielder Tracye
Lawyer, who leads the Cardinal in
goals, scored her 11th of the season.
She got this goal during the 76th
minute of play, when she nailed a
header on a corner kick for Stan
ford's only goal of the game.
Despite the overwhelming five
goal margin of victory, BYU and
the Cardinal attained similar shot
opportunities as Stanford outshot

BYU, 14-12.
BYU will continue in the second
round of the NCAA tournament
with action on Saturday when the
team competes against the UCLA
Bruins.
Stanford, on the other hand,
must wait until next season to
avenge the sting of this defeat.
The Cardinal's season has been
tainted by cyclical patterns of suc
cess and struggles. Although the
team began the season with an im
pressive 6-2-1 start. Stanford accu
mulated five losses in the month of
October.
A string of victories, including a
win over Pacific 10 Conference
powerhouse Washington late in the
season, suggested that the Cardinal
was returning to its early season
prosperity.
Because of the importance
which teams place on the NCAA
tournament, yesterday's defeat was
even more tragic to a Stanford
team struggling to retain its esteem
both within the Pac-10 and on the
national level.
