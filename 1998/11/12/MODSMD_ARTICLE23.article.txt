When thinking of the
prospects for the 1998-99 Stan
ford men's basketball season, vi
sions of a late March afternoon in
evitably creep into one's mind.
On that memorable day in the
Alamo Dome in San Antonio,
Tex., the Cardinal came within
one point of the national champi
onship game, falling in an over
time heartbreaker to eventual
champion Kentucky, 86-85.

But of all the numerous emo
tions or captivating moments
,Kom that national semifinal
game, the one that sticks out more
-than any came at the very end of
Stanford's roller-coaster ride
through the NCAA tournament.
As the Cardinal stars walked
pff the floor of the Alamo Dome
on that spring evening in San An
tonio, they held their heads high
and displayed a mysterious, al
most eerie, glow of satisfaction in
i&eir eyes.
As they left college basket
ball's most prestigious stage,
Stanford's players' confidence
sent a clear message to the 40,000
fans — this was just the beginning.
They'd be back.
So now it is six months later,
three days before the start of an

other four-month journey toward
college basketball's Holy Grail —
the national title.
With all five starters returning
from last year's team, the
prospects for this season are ex
tremely bright.
Ranked No. 2 in the preseason
coaches poll and No. 3 in the AP
rankings, Stanford is also the
unanimous favorite to win its first
ever Pacific 10 Conference title.
Although it will be difficult for
the Cardinal to live up to the
hype, the team seams extremely
comfortable with the high expec
tations.
"I am very pleased that people
think we have enough ability and
that Stanford can have that kind
of a basketball program," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "It has to be pleasing to
have the opportunity to compete
for a conference title."
Three Stanford players are
preseason candidates for All-
America honors: senior point
guard Arthur Lee, senior center
Tim Young, Stanford's all-time
leading shot blocker, and junior
forward Mark Madsen.
Madsen. who averaged 15.2
points and 12.2 rebounds per
game during the NCAA Tourna
ment, is also a candidate for the
John Wooden Award, given an
nually to the nation's best player.
"We like there to be high ex
pectations," Madsen said. "We
are pleased to be in this position.
But we also know that we can't get
caught up in the hype or underes

Mark "Mad Dogg" Madsen and the No. 3 Stanford Cardinal have high expectations for
this season.
timate any of our opponents.
" The Pac-10 title is a major goal
for our team. It symbolizes a lot for
us."
Stanford's other two starters, se
nior forward Peter Sauer and se
nior guard Kris Weems, the Cardi
nal pair of deadly three-point
shooters, are both candidates for
numerous honors.
"Nothing really changed as far
as our preparation," Sauer said.
"There is a lot of excitement sur
rounding the season and I am look
ing forward to having fun out there
[and] doing the same things we did
in the past to try and win a national
championship."
A major obstacle facing Stan
ford this season, however, is its
schedule — one of the most diffi
cult in school history.
The Cardinal will play in the
Preseason Nil tournament, which
features many highly-ranked
teams, including North Carolina,
St. John's, Georgia, Massachusetts
and Purdue.
In December, the team will trav
el to Washington D.C. for the
BB&T Classic, and will face Mary
land in the first round of the tour
nament that also features DePaul
and George Washington.

And Stanford's marquee out-of
conference game will take place in
February at Maples Pavilion when
the Cardinal will host No. 2 Con
necticut.
"We have a very difficult sched
ule, with nine teams in the presea
son top 12," Montgomery said. "So
it is pretty clear that we are going to
lose a game along the way. The
question will he how we react to
that."
Along with its talented starting
live, Stanford has one of the deep
est benches in the nation and will
look to as many as 12 players to
make serious contributions
throughout the season.
David Moseley, Ryan Mendez,
Jarron Collins and Michael Mc-
Donald all return for the Cardinal
after having a major impact last
season.
"We have a great group of guys
in the locker room," Montgomery
said. "We really are a basketball
team. We have a lot of good players
in the absence of a superstar.
"We will take advantage of the
fact that we have such great
depth."
Stanford was also blessed with a
talented group of newcomers,
headed by redshirt freshman Jason
Collins and guard Tony Oiovachin
ni.
"In the short time that we have
had Jason, he appears to be a guy

that could have an impact," Mont
gomery said. "II he can stay healthy
and give us minutes, he allows us to
stay hig when we bring Tim
| Young| out."
The veteran members of the
Stanford front line agree that the
addition of Collins could be huge
for the frontcourt.
"Jason gives us a second pres
ence at the five spot," Madsen said.
"He has had practices where he
dominates the paint. Jason should
be extremely significant to our
frontline."
All things considered, it is easy
to see why the preseason voters
placed Stanford in the upper eche
lon of college basketball. The Car
dinal clearly has all the tools to win
a national championship, and ap
pears to have the confidence and
maturity to do just that.
Hut there is a long season ahead
and by the time March rolls around
the preseason rankings will be long
removed from memory.
"We can go as far as we want
this year," Lee said. "We pride our
selves on improving every day, so
that we can reach our ultimate goal
— to be the best team in the nation
at the end of March."
Stanford will begin its campaign
with a team that was in fact the best
team in the country last year, UC
Davis, which is the defending Divi
sion II National Champions.

The Aggies finished last year
with a 31-2 record, and capped off
the season with a 83-77 win against
Kentucky Wesleyan to win its first
ever national title. •
UC-Davis lost six players to
graduation, but return three
starters to the floor against the Car
dinal.
With so much hype surrounding
the beginning of the season, it is
difficult for Stanford to stay fo
cused on the Aggies.
But that is what the Cardinal
must do every day. It must forget
about the future and work to suc
ceed in the present.
"We have to play a high-level
game every day," Montgomery
said.
"What made us successful last
year will absolutely have to be in
place again.
We know this is going to be
tough. If we set our whole system
that we have to make the Final
Four or win the national champi
onship. we are setting ourselves up
for failure," he added.
"On the court, things are no dif
ferent for us this year. We have to
do our job, and that is to build a
good basketball team. The founda
tion we lay in the first six weeks is
so critical. The goal is to not focus
on the destination as much as what
you're doing every day," Mont
gomery said.
