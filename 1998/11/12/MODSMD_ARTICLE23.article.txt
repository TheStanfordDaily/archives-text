But of all the numerous emo
tions or captivating moments
,Kom that national semifinal
game, the one that sticks out more
-than any came at the very end of
Stanford's roller-coaster ride
through the NCAA tournament.
As the Cardinal stars walked
pff the floor of the Alamo Dome
on that spring evening in San An
tonio, they held their heads high
and displayed a mysterious, al
most eerie, glow of satisfaction in
i&eir eyes.
As they left college basket
ball's most prestigious stage,
Stanford's players' confidence
sent a clear message to the 40,000
fans — this was just the beginning.
They'd be back.
So now it is six months later,
three days before the start of an

other four-month journey toward
college basketball's Holy Grail —
the national title.
With all five starters returning
from last year's team, the
prospects for this season are ex
tremely bright.
Ranked No. 2 in the preseason
coaches poll and No. 3 in the AP
rankings, Stanford is also the
unanimous favorite to win its first
ever Pacific 10 Conference title.
Although it will be difficult for
the Cardinal to live up to the
hype, the team seams extremely
comfortable with the high expec
tations.
"I am very pleased that people
think we have enough ability and
that Stanford can have that kind
of a basketball program," said
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "It has to be pleasing to
have the opportunity to compete
for a conference title."
Three Stanford players are
preseason candidates for All-
America honors: senior point
guard Arthur Lee, senior center
Tim Young, Stanford's all-time
leading shot blocker, and junior
forward Mark Madsen.
Madsen. who averaged 15.2
points and 12.2 rebounds per
game during the NCAA Tourna
ment, is also a candidate for the
John Wooden Award, given an
nually to the nation's best player.
"We like there to be high ex
pectations," Madsen said. "We
are pleased to be in this position.
But we also know that we can't get
caught up in the hype or underes
