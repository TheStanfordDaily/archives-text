I can feel the anticipation in the air. It's
been two weeks now. Professional bas
ketball caught me off guard by actually
canceling part of the season.
I thought it was an idle threat. I
thought it would never happen. I thought
this deadlock was just a silly bluff by two
sides of pampered millionaires.
Now it's time for the NBA to pay.
College basketball has arrived once
main, and on this campus the frenzy for it
is stronger than ever. While the NBA s
factions play their power games, the eyes
of the nation will focus on the men and
women who make the real sacrifices —
those who play at the collegiate level.

I've always loved the college game

NBA season? Not many. And how many
of those involve Michael Jordan? Most of

Conversely, the NCAA tournament is
the ultimate highlight reel. And it's not
only national powerhouses that leave
their imprints. The NBA lacks one major

and the league doesn't want it. NBA com
missioner David Stern would roll over
and die if the Golden State Warriors or
Toronto Raptors had somehow marched

into the finals last year. There's no money
in Cinderellas. so they couldn't possibly
help the NBA in any way.
The NCAA — while still looking to
make a quick buck — has always em
braced its overachievers. No one in last
year's March Madness was more cele
brated than Homer and Bryce Drew, the
father-son team from Valparaiso.
Just close your eyes and recall "Pacer."
the full-court set play that launched the
Crusaders to a 70-69 upset of Mississippi
in the first round of the tournament. That
victory was the beginning of an unthink-
