I can feel the anticipation in the air. It's
been two weeks now. Professional bas
ketball caught me off guard by actually
canceling part of the season.
I thought it was an idle threat. I
thought it would never happen. I thought
this deadlock was just a silly bluff by two
sides of pampered millionaires.
Now it's time for the NBA to pay.
College basketball has arrived once
main, and on this campus the frenzy for it
is stronger than ever. While the NBA s
factions play their power games, the eyes
of the nation will focus on the men and
women who make the real sacrifices —
those who play at the collegiate level.

I've always loved the college game
more than any other sport. Yeaj; in and
year out, names and images and plays
sneak into our minds and hearts forever.
Face it, how many truly memorable
moments can you recall from last year's

NBA season? Not many. And how many
of those involve Michael Jordan? Most of
them.
Conversely, the NCAA tournament is
the ultimate highlight reel. And it's not
only national powerhouses that leave
their imprints. The NBA lacks one major
factor that can be found in every college
basketball tournament: Cinderellas.
There can never be a Cinderella in
professional basketball. The best-of
seven playoff format would never allow it
and the league doesn't want it. NBA com
missioner David Stern would roll over
and die if the Golden State Warriors or
Toronto Raptors had somehow marched

into the finals last year. There's no money
in Cinderellas. so they couldn't possibly
help the NBA in any way.
The NCAA — while still looking to
make a quick buck — has always em
braced its overachievers. No one in last
year's March Madness was more cele
brated than Homer and Bryce Drew, the
father-son team from Valparaiso.
Just close your eyes and recall "Pacer."
the full-court set play that launched the
Crusaders to a 70-69 upset of Mississippi
in the first round of the tournament. That
victory was the beginning of an unthink-

able Sweet 16 run for the team. They
eventually fell to Rhode Island,
which wasn't exactly the team to beat
when March Madness started.
And of course, the women lack no
drama either. Remember Harvard?
The Crimson did the impossible
when they knocked the Cardinal out
of the tournament in the first round
last season. Sure, the Stanford
women were without their top two
scorers, but it was still David bringing
down Goliath.
The list could go on for pages: the
UCLA women being robbed against
Alabama; Richard Hamilton's
buzzer-beater to carry Connecticut
past a Washington upset; the Stan
ford-Kentucky overtime thriller in
the Final Four; and Arizona's and
North Carolina's humblings at the
hands of Utah are just a few exam
ples. And all these were just last year.
I'm not knocking Michael Jordan
or anything, but I've grown a little
tired of watching the Bulls coast
through every postseason on their
way to another title ring. We sit back
and are happy that the latest Western
Conference champion was able to
take Michael and company to six
games in the championship.
And I'm not setting myself up and
saying that I've thrown off the NBA

forever. After growing up and wfltth
ing Magic Johnson and Kafetm
Abdul-Jabbar lead the Lakers to five
titles in the '80s, to do so would be
sacrilegious. I'll admit it. I'm a sucker.
I'll plop down 30 bucks for my ttftse
bleed seats at the Forum. *' r
But give me a choice and I'd
rather attend either one of our team's
games instead of the Lakers'. Thtse
people go out and play for the love.
No salary, no shoe contracts.
And the tournament is wherffrall
comes to a head. It's win or yoto're
out. There isn't a series of game's to
cover your butt if you slip up in Game
1. Somehow, the Cardinal m£n's
team's victory against Rhode Island
wouldn't have been as dramatic if
everyone was thinking, "Oh well,
there's only a minute left. We'll just
get them in Game 2."
So forget the pros for a while.
Come on out to Maples on Saturday
night and catch the men beating up
on UC-Davis.
Or better yet, drive down to San
Jose for the women's Four in the Fall
tournament.
College basketball action, it's
faaaantastic.

Gil Lopez still tears up every time CHS
plays "One Shining Moment" and
shows the highlight reel at the end of
the men's basketball tournament. And
he still cringes at Mark Madsen's
"dance."
