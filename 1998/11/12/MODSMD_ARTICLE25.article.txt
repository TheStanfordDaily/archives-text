## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
Take the sweats off, put your headgear on. and get
ready to put it all out on the mat because the 1998-99
Cardinal wrestling season is underway.
The Cardinal team is coached by Chris Horpel in his
20th year, assisted by Tod Surmon, Steve Buddie and
Dan Chaid. Buddie, in his first year, is a former Stanford
All-American and Pacific 10 Conference champion and
will help coach the middle and upper weights.
The team returns 10 lettermen, including four Pacif
ic 10 Conference place winners and three NCAA quali
fiers, and hopes to improve upon last year's sixth-place
finish in the conference and its 2-10 dual-meet record.
Despite the loss of veteran experience in B.J. Sanchez,
Scott Chapman. Doug Bardsley and NCAA qualifier
Jeff Grant, the team looks to be solid with seasoned
leadership.
The captains for this year's squad are junior Zach
Zimmerer (133 lbs.) and senior Beau Weiner (157). who
look to lead the team on a strong 1998-99 campaign.
Zimmerer. who was second in the Pac-1() last year, seeks
to improve on his two-straight appearances at the
NCAA meet and contend for All-America honors. He
is currently ranked first in preseason Pac-10 polls.

WRESTLING
■ Saturday: Stanford opens its season at the California
Open at Cal State-Fullerton.

"We are headed into the season healthy and we pro
gressed better in the offseason than last year" said Zim
merer. "Our team has a new atmosphere to it.and I
think everyone is aware of what we can do this year."
Weiner is coming off a fifth-place finish in the Pac-10
and is looking to return to the NCAA tournament this
year after narrowly missing it last year. He is ranked
fourth in the preseason and will make a run at the Pac
-10 title.
"This year we are led by three returning qualifiers: ju
nior Rudy Ruiz, junior Zach Zimmerer and senior Beau
Weiner." Horpel said. "In addition, juniors Warren
McPherson and Tim Kendall are expected to plav lead
ership roles and help improve upon last year's sixth
place finish in the conference. Our dual-meet strength
should be much improved with redshirt freshman
heavyweight Andy Hunter filling in there."
The rest of the team looks to be solid and in con
tention in all the weights. Leading the lighter weights is
Ruiz, who is also a 1998 NCAA qualifier and is coming
off a fourth-place finish in the Pac-10 last year. Ranked
second in the preseason Pac-10 rankings, he looks to re
turn to the tournament this year. Combined with Zim
merer, the Cardinal has a tough opening tandem in the
lower weights.
In addition to these veterans is true freshman Kenji
Arai who placed fourth and sixth in the California State
Tournament his senior and junior years in high school,
respectively, and should make an immediate impact.
"We really have a lot of tough freshmen who could fit
in the lineup and do a fine job." said Zimmerer about
Arai and freshmen Andy Hunter and Chuck Fairbanks.
"It is important that our freshmen are tough and.from
what I have seen, they are."
Joining Weiner in the middle weights are returning
lettermen junior Frank Ruiz (149) and McPherson
(165). Ruiz is looking to crack into the Pac-10 rankings
and McPherson is coming off a 12-5 record last year. He
is ranked No. 4 in the preseason Pac-10. He is also look
ing to defend his title at this weekend's California Open
at Cal-State Fullcrton in which he won in the 142-pound
weight class.
The upper weights bring back two veterans and in
troduce two rookies. Kendall (184), a junior, and se-
nior Shane Cross (174) lead the way
for the upper weights. Kendall was
sixth in the Pac-l()in 1997 and had a
rough season last year at 197. Now,
at a lower weight, lie should be able
to score some important team
points and is ranked fourth in the
preseason I'ac-K).
Cross is coming off an 11-16 sea
son and is also ranked fourth in the

preseason polls. Rounding out the
upper weights are true freshman
Fairbanks (197) and Hunter
(heavyweight), a redshirt fresh
man. Fairbanks won last year's Ne
braska State Championship and is
looking to make a quick impact this
year. Hunter, who finished second
and fifth in two separate California
State Tournaments is going to be a
key element at the heavyweight
spot that lacked on last year's
squad.
Horpel is enthusiastic about this

year's team and believes it will be
successful and improve on last year's
marks in the Pac-10 and number of
qualifiers for the NCAA tourna
ment.
The new season kicks off Satur
day at the California Open at Cal
State-Fullerton. Horpel sees this as
an important test for the team and
will help solidify the lineup.
"The California Open will be a
great opportunity to measure our
program in the early going. It is a
tournament where evervone on the

team is able to compete, so we will
hring most of our 31-man roster. I
will use this competition as a tool to
determine our 10 starters for our
first dual meet (on) Nov. 24."
In addition to regular season compe
tition. Stanford will host the Pac-1()
Championships Feb. 28 and 29. This
will bring the best from around the
conference to compete for NCAA
qualification. The last time Stanford
hosted the Pac-lOs was in 1991,
when the Cardinal produced two
league champions.
