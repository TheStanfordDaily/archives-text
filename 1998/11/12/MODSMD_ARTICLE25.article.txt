## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
Take the sweats off, put your headgear on. and get
ready to put it all out on the mat because the 1998-99
Cardinal wrestling season is underway.
The Cardinal team is coached by Chris Horpel in his
20th year, assisted by Tod Surmon, Steve Buddie and
Dan Chaid. Buddie, in his first year, is a former Stanford
All-American and Pacific 10 Conference champion and
will help coach the middle and upper weights.
The team returns 10 lettermen, including four Pacif
ic 10 Conference place winners and three NCAA quali
fiers, and hopes to improve upon last year's sixth-place
finish in the conference and its 2-10 dual-meet record.
Despite the loss of veteran experience in B.J. Sanchez,
Scott Chapman. Doug Bardsley and NCAA qualifier
Jeff Grant, the team looks to be solid with seasoned
leadership.
The captains for this year's squad are junior Zach
Zimmerer (133 lbs.) and senior Beau Weiner (157). who
look to lead the team on a strong 1998-99 campaign.
Zimmerer. who was second in the Pac-1() last year, seeks
to improve on his two-straight appearances at the
NCAA meet and contend for All-America honors. He
is currently ranked first in preseason Pac-10 polls.

WRESTLING
â–  Saturday: Stanford opens its season at the California
Open at Cal State-Fullerton.

"We are headed into the season healthy and we pro
gressed better in the offseason than last year" said Zim
merer. "Our team has a new atmosphere to it.and I
think everyone is aware of what we can do this year."
Weiner is coming off a fifth-place finish in the Pac-10
and is looking to return to the NCAA tournament this
year after narrowly missing it last year. He is ranked
fourth in the preseason and will make a run at the Pac
-10 title.
"This year we are led by three returning qualifiers: ju
nior Rudy Ruiz, junior Zach Zimmerer and senior Beau
Weiner." Horpel said. "In addition, juniors Warren
McPherson and Tim Kendall are expected to plav lead
ership roles and help improve upon last year's sixth
place finish in the conference. Our dual-meet strength
should be much improved with redshirt freshman
heavyweight Andy Hunter filling in there."
The rest of the team looks to be solid and in con
tention in all the weights. Leading the lighter weights is
Ruiz, who is also a 1998 NCAA qualifier and is coming
off a fourth-place finish in the Pac-10 last year. Ranked
second in the preseason Pac-10 rankings, he looks to re
turn to the tournament this year. Combined with Zim
merer, the Cardinal has a tough opening tandem in the
lower weights.
In addition to these veterans is true freshman Kenji
Arai who placed fourth and sixth in the California State
Tournament his senior and junior years in high school,
respectively, and should make an immediate impact.
"We really have a lot of tough freshmen who could fit
in the lineup and do a fine job." said Zimmerer about
Arai and freshmen Andy Hunter and Chuck Fairbanks.
"It is important that our freshmen are tough and.from
what I have seen, they are."
Joining Weiner in the middle weights are returning
lettermen junior Frank Ruiz (149) and McPherson
(165). Ruiz is looking to crack into the Pac-10 rankings
and McPherson is coming off a 12-5 record last year. He
is ranked No. 4 in the preseason Pac-10. He is also look
ing to defend his title at this weekend's California Open
at Cal-State Fullcrton in which he won in the 142-pound
weight class.
The upper weights bring back two veterans and in
troduce two rookies. Kendall (184), a junior, and se-
