# Wide receiver Pitts provides offensive punch
## A 						bright spot in Cardinal's season 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
j Caught in the quagmire of a 1-8
season, one of the few bright spots
that Stanford football fans can look
.• to. is the play of the Cardinal wide
, i receivers.
Entering the season, the Cardi
, nal knew it would have to replace
. two-year starter Damon Dunn with
someone to complement junior
flanker Troy Walters. With 889
on 64 catches, Deßonnie
Pitts has stepped up to provide that
, offensive punch.
, , ri| "I definitely learned a lot from
guys like Damon Dunn and Brian
Manning," Pitts said. "Not just
about sports, but about life and
stuff off the field."
Pitts, a junior majoring in com
munications, has showed maturity
all season long, emerging, along
with sophomore Dave Davis, to
provide Stanford with a much
needed deep threat.
When Walters went down with
an ankle injury against Arizona,
Pitts was thrust into the starting
'r'6le and hasn't stopped producing
ever since.
- ' ""It's a challenge, I guess, but I
Ipok at it more as an opportunity to
, show what I have [and] to show
people what I can do," Pitts said.
■~ He's done just that, to the tune
of. 7.11 receptions and 98.8 receiv
ing yards per game — good for
ninth and 18th in the nation, re
, spectively. Perhaps even more im
pprtant, Pitts has provided leader
ship for one of Stanford's youngest
te;ams in years.
Last year, the Saginaw, Mich,
native played primarily in three
and four receiver sets, finishing the
season with 13 catches for 195 yards
v 3nd a 17-yard touchdown at Ari
, zona.
, ~ "I'm playing a lot more [than

last year] and I'm kind of in more of
a leadership role," Pitts said. "I'm
supposed to make sure all our guys
are on the same page with what the
coaches are trying to do."
Meanwhile, Pitts has shined in
dividually.
He supplied one of the more ex
citing plays of this year's generally
depressing season, during Stan
ford's 30-23 home loss against Ore
gon State. A split second before
being devoured by a Beaver nose
tackle, quarterback Todd Husak
swung the ball out to a well-covered
Pitts in the right flat.
Unable to pull the ball in, Pitts
nonetheless had the presence of
mind to tip the ball three times into
the hands of a waiting Cardinal
Dave Davis, who sprinted for a 31-
yard gain.
"I had a deep hook and Deßon
nie had an over," Davis said. "I saw
[Husak] throw the ball, [and] saw it
juggled. Deßonnie made a great
play tipping it to me."
The play was actually atypical of
Pitts' season, not only because he's
more accustomed to catching the
ball himself than passing it off to
someone else, but also because it
featured him on a quick out. Pitts
has feasted off the Pacific 10 con
ference's strong safeties with his
deep crosses, one of which he con
verted to a touchdown against Ore
gon.
"I like deep crossing routes," he
said, and "getting behind the line
backers."
So, Deßonnie, ever worry about
pulling in one of those deep crosses
and finding a free safety with rage
in his eyes about to plant his helmet
right underneath your face mask?
"Nah," he laughs. "1 feel like I'm
tough enough to take any hit
they've got."
Pitts finished that game with
nine catches for 124 yards, one of

five 100-plus-yard-receiving days
he's had on the season. Of greater
importance to him, however, is the
team's success in the win and loss
columns.
"We've been getting better, but
we're not complacent with almost
beating teams," he said, spitting the
word "almost" like a mouthful of
sour milk. "Though we're young,
we feel like we can compete with

and beat some teams. We just need
to put it all together."
Truly impressive is the fact that
Pitts has been able to put up such
numbers in the face of opposing
teams' absolute domination of the
Cardinal running game.
Entering this week's home clos
er against Washington State, Stan
ford is averaging a paltry 80.8 yards
on the ground each game, good for

109 th in the nation out of 112 teams
in Division I football.
"Of course, the running game
has been a concern," Pitts said.
"We feel that we can run the ball,
though, and open up some things
down the field."
Furthermore, Pitts and the rest
of the offense have had to operate
constantly knowing that they could
put up nearly 40 points and still

lose, as they did at Arizona State.
Fortunately, Pitts has avoided
demoralization by the defense's
104 th overall ranking.
"We're not worried about our
defense," he said.
"I'm confident in the defense.
We just need to put it all together in
one game, both sides of the ball, of
fense and defense. When we can do
that, we'll win," he added.
