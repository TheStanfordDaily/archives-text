# Fac Sen to address copyright rules
## 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
At this afternoon's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, the Committee on Re
search will present a revised ver
sion of the University's copyright
policy that Senate Chair Brad
Efron, professor of statistics, pre
dicts will spark a lively discussion.
Depending on the length of the
discussion, Efron said, there is a
good chance that the senate will not
vote on policy at today's meeting.
"1 am looking forward to the de
bate," Efron said. " The copyright
policy is something that has come
up again and again and there is al
ways a lot of debate about it. There
is a long history of Stanford profes
sors who write their own work even
though they are at Stanford.
"With emerging technology,
patents are more restrictive and
faculty have to share their money
with the University. But it's not
clear where to draw the line be
tween writing and creating some

thing— say teaching material on
the Web."
The new copyright policy, Efron
said, is not significantly different
from the old one. but rather it is
more clearly articulated. The copy
right policy aims to allow profes
sors creative freedom while making
sure the University is compensated
when its resources are used.

the line between writing and
creating.'

The extent to which Stanford re
sources contributed to the creation
of the material lies at the heart of
the copyright policy debate.
In its report, the research com
mittee emphasized its effort to pre

serve "the academic tradition that
popular nonfiction, novels, text
hooks, poems, musical composi
tions, unpatentable software or
other works of artistic imagination
remain the property of the origina
tor. provided no more than inci
dental use of Stanford resources
has been made in the creation of
work."
When that report went to the
senate Steering Committee last
week, the committee members
found the concept of "no more than
incidental" problematic.
The steering committee
changed the phrase from "more
than incidental" to "significant,"
according to Efron.
"In some ways we are mincing
words," Efron said. "But we felt
that 'more than incidental' was
dangerously loose." Efron ac
knowledged that the phrase "sig
nificant" was also vague, but said
that the committee felt it was a
clearer term.
Also at today's meeting, the

Committee on Undergraduate
Studies will recommend a five-year
renewal of the Human Biology pro
gram.
Efron called the renewal rou
tine. though the committee decided
on a five-year rather than the max
imum eight-year renewal.
Efron pointed out, however,
that it is particularly important to
keep a eye on popular programs.
Committee Chair Rob Robin
son, professor of German Studies,
emphasized that the five-year re
newal in no way represents a lack of
confidence in the program.
"It is a wonderful program, ab
solutely one of the best at Stan
ford." Robinson said. He added
that in five years he expects to find
the program running "swimming
ly" well.
Robinson explained that the
shorter renewal of the program
comes as a result of the approach
ing retirements of key figures and
founders of the Human Biology
program.
