MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford
(15-6) vs. UC-Davis (3-22), 10:30
a.m., deCiuerre Pool.

"It's [not only] our last home
game of the season," said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti, but
"it's also the last game at Stanford
for the seniors."
According to Dettamanti, the
five seniors will all start in the Davis
game.
" This is the last chance for people
to see them play at home," Detta
manti said.
Stanford and UC-Davis faced in
the opening game of this season, in
which the Cardinal came away with
a rousing 14-4 victory.
Saturday's meeting is a non
league match. Because the Aggies
are currently not ranked in the top
20 teams in the nation, while Stan
ford is vying for one of the top seeds,
the Cardinal is focusing more on the

conference championships than on
this weekend's game.
"We're not really going to point
for this game," Dettamanti said,
"We're going to practice hard
through the whole week. This is a
great week to play Davis because we
can work on peaking so that we peak
towards the conference."
Last year, UC-Davis was one of
the four teams that competed at the
NCAA championships. The teams
are selected based on the winners of
the three leagues in the country,
which include the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, the Western
Water Polo Association .and the
East Coast league. One additional
team is selected to take the fourth
spot and that seed usually goes to a
team in the MPSF as it is the
strongest league. UC-Davis is part
of the Division II WWPA.
"It's funny that we have never
lost to Davis and they got to go to
NCAA and we didn't," Dettamanti
said.
liut the Aggies graduated some
of their best players last year and are
redshirting some of their top players
this year.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
coming off of a strong showing
against top-ranked I JSC last week
end. Junior Brian I leil feron current
ly leads the Cardinal in scoring with
36 points. Beaubien is close behind
with 32, followed by Rodelo with 24.
Aguilera has collected 179 saves in

the cage. With both strong offense
and defense, Stanford just needs to
bring it all together when it counts.
And right now the entire team is fo
cusing on doing everything it can to
get ready for the MPSF tournament.
"We're mainly conditioning to
try to get in the best possible shape
for conference [championships],"
Dettamanti said.
Depending on how the rest of the
teams in the MPSF finish their con
ference games, the Cardinal may
have a chance at gettinti the No. 2

position going into the tournament.
"Right now, we're finished with
conferenee at 6-2 and California fin
ished at 4-4. hut everyone else still
has games." Dettamanti said. "We
did the best we could and now we're
waiting for the other teams to finish
the season to find out the plaeings."
Saturday's game begins at 10:30
a.m. at deGuerre pool. Stanford's
next match is against Cal on Nov. 21
The MPSF tournament will he held
in Newport Beach over Thanksgiv
ing weekend.
