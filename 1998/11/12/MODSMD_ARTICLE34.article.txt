Twyla Tharp Dance and ODC / San Francisco prior to forming his own company in 1995.

NOW to DEC / 1
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presents "Alexander Calder: 1898-1976." The
only West Coast presentation of nearly 250 works by this master of Modernism, the
exhibit features Calder's mobiles. "Why must art be static?" Calder asked. "The next step
in sculpture is motion." Calder's early work was with children's toys, and his later works
display a deft and whimsical use of color and form. Tickets are $10, $4 for students with
ID. The museum, open Friday through Tuesday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Thursday 11 a.m. to 9
p.m., is at 151 Third St. (between Mission and Howard), San Francisco; call (415) 357-
4000 for advance tickets and information. The museum is accessible by Caltrain; take the
4th & King stop.

SAT/14
Under the direction of Stephen Sano, The Stanford Chamber Chorale will present "The
Rune of Hospitality" this Saturday. The concert's title is taken from one of the works to be

presented. About it, Sano said, "I was taken by this piece's timeless quality and beautiful
architecture. The concept of a rune, defined not only as a poem, but as mystery and
magic, is attarctive — even provocative. This piece embodies all these features in a truly
inviting aesthetic." Also featured are works from the English School, including Thomas
Tallis and Charles Villiers Stanford. Tickets are $8, $4 students. The performance is at 8
p.m. at Memorial Church; call 725-2787 for tickets and information.
MON/16
The ever-loved violinist Midori takes the stage with Robert Macdonald as part of the San
Francisco Performances series. One of history's most celebrated child prodigies, Midori has
established herself in recent years as an even more remarkable artist in maturity. A Berlin
newspaper writes, "She has solved the problem of how to improve on perfection; she is,
indeed, amazingly imaginative and profound." The program will include Mozart's Sonata in A
Major, Corigliano's Sonata and Brahms Sonata No. 1 in G Major, with more to be announced.
Tickets are $15 to $55. The performance is at 8 p.m. at the Davies Symphony Hall, Grove
Street (between Van Ness and Franklin), San Francisco; call (415) 392-2545 for tickets and
information.

Landmark's Palo Alto Square continues its Saturday Matinee Classic Film Series with

Cad! Go, go. Tickets are $4.50. The film starts at noon at Palo Alto Square, 3000 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto; call 32-MOVIE for information.
