# Performance Reviews
## Four from Prague The
						Prazak Quartet at Lively Arts 
### 
The Prazak Quartet delivered a thoroughly satisfying performance of Leos
Janacek's string quartets last Sunday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Eschewing a
more traditional format, the concert was a combination of theater and music,
ably revealing the influences which formed the foundations for each quartet.
The first piece, entitled the "Kreutzer Sonata," was inspired by Tolstoy's short story by
the same name. Janacek wrote, "I had in mind a miserable woman suffering, beaten,
wretched, like the great Russian author Tolstoy wrote about in his Kreutzer Sonata." In
the story, the narrator gives the details of his marriage, culminating with his murder of
his wife.
The audience was ominously promised a "multimedia introduction" to the story.
What transpired, however, was a suitably spare dramatic monologue detailing the
mounting jealousy that led to the murder, delivered bv actor Brent Gibbs. On both sides
of Gibbs were screens onto which were projected black-and-white images of deserted
streets, bridges and graveyards in Prague, creating a haunting effect that was consonant
but not irritatingly complementary. Intermittently, the story paused to allow a brief ren
dering of a theme by the quartet, which played a few minutes worth of music before the
story continued.
When the tale was completed, the quartet played the "Kreutzer Sonata" in toto and
played it beautifully. For the audience members unfamiliar with lanacek's work, the ear
lier musical interludes had the additional benefit of previewing the main themes of the
piece, granting an added power to the sum of the parts.
The second piece, "Intimate Letters," drew its inspiration from Janacek's passion for
Kamila Stosslova, a married woman 38 years his junior, to whom Janacek wrote over 700
letters. The piece began with actors Harold and Maedell Dixon playing the parts of
Stosslova and Janacek, as they read out loud from Janacek's letters. "My love is constant
as a wide field with a sun above at night just as during the day," wrote Janacek.
"Intimate Letters" itself formed the subject of a number of the letters, as Janacek
dwelled on his efforts to compose a score equal to his ardor. Near the end, he believed his
work a success, pronouncing his notes to "glow, to float like steel while it's hot. I imagine
the music's speed, and your amazed silence. It's a work carved out of living flesh."
Such statements up the ante, and one briefly wondered if the work would deliver. But
when the quartet played the entire piece, the vigor and poignancy of the music swept
doubt away. The players' technique deftly handled the music's range, conveying the quar
tet's alternating delicacy and vitality.
By juxtaposing the inspiration for and the realization of the artist's vision, the music
had an immediacy which the abstract medium of music sometimes lacks. The Prazak
Quartet and its accompanying actors ensured the audience's connection to the work was
as much emotional as aesthetic, creating a wonderful afternoon of music.
