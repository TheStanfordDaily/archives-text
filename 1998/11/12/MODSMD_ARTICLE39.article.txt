# 'The Mikado'
## The
						Savoyards have a success 
### 
As the cast of "The Mikado" took yet another bow
amidst eager applause on opening night, it was
clear that the Stanford Savoyards' first opera of
the season was a hit.
The show begins with a lively overture. Nanki-Poo, the
son of the Mikado, has fled his father's court and the
unwanted amorous attention of the hideous Katisha.
Nanki-Poo is now a musician in the Titipu town band.
While in Titipu, he has fallen in love with Yum-Yum, a
resident of the town. Sadly, although she returns his love,
Yum-Yum is betrothed to her guardian, the town tailor,
Ko-Ko.
As the show opens, Nanki-Poo hears that Ko-Ko has
been convicted of flirting, an offense punishable by
death. Simultaneously, Ko-Ko has been made Lord High
Executioner, which allows him to control who is to be put
to death. This devastates Nanki-Poo because it leaves Ko-
Ko free to marry Yum-Yum. Ko-Ko reasons that he can't
kill himself, because that is, after all, a "capital" offense.
With the arrival of the Mikado, seeking his wayward son,
and the formidable Katisha, the plot becomes more com
plicated still.
Although the theme of ill-fated lovers is certainly
familiar in opera, placing the action in a mythical Japan
of W. S. Gilbert's own devising offers some new twists.

Moreover, the intricate plot frequently diverges from
focusing on Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum to poke fun at the
British, particularly through the character of pompous
Pooh-Bah, Lord High Everything Else, with his snotty
British accent and stereotypically stiff manner.
Appropriately enough, the pompous Pooh-Bah sings at
one point, "I can't help it, I was born sneering.''
Flavored abundantly with Gilbert's dry wit, the dia
logue and lyrics are clever, amusing and occasionally even
insightful. Particularly memorable is the song "I've Got a
Little List" about people who should be put to death, in
which modern lyrics say "televangelists," and "apologetic
statesmen...you may put them on the list and they'd
none of them be missed." Add colorful costumes, an
effective, if minimalist, set and a high-energy cast, and
the three-hour production stays engaging all the way
through.
The show opened at Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Friday, Nov. 6. Upcoming performances are Nov. 13 and
14 at 8 p.m. and Nov. 15 at 2:30 p.m. Tickets ($l3 adults,
$8.50 seniors and $6.50 students and children) are avail
able at the door or at the Stanford ticket office, 725-
ARTS.
The Stanford Savoyards have been producing tradi
tional Gilbert and Sullivan shows at Stanford since 1973.

The group, comprised of students, alumni, faculty, staff
and members of the community, is affiliated with the
ASSU. Look for its production of Gilbert and Sullivan's
"Princess Ida or Castle Adamant" in the spring.
