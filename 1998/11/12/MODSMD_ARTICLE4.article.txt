The current generation bears the
responsibility of producing political
leaders to fight ecological destruc
tion. said Timothy Wirth. president
of the United Nations Foundation.
Wirth addressed a crowd of over
3(X) at Kresge Auditorium yester
day afternoon in a talk titled. "De
spair or Determination." He em
phasized that present atmospheric
conditions are at risk due to over
population and the growth of the
human capacity to generate waste.
" The course we are currently on
is unsustainable," he said. "The
numbers are staggering. We should
approach the population problem
with a high sense of urgency."
Over the last 100 years, the
earth's population has quadrupled,
from 1.5 billion to 6 billion people,
and the size of the world economy
has grown 20-fold, said Wirth, who
obtained his doctorate in education
at Stanford in 1973.
However, he argued, the despair
stemming from impending ecologi
cal disasters can be mitigated by a
determined leadership. The chal
lenge is to convey this sense of de

spair while working to solve prob
lems, he said.
"We cannot engender despair."
Wirth said. "One billion people try
to live on $1 a day .... Two billion
lack sanitation."
If world leaders do not agree on
plans of action, the "global fabric of
stability" will be pulled apart by a
"sea of desperate people." Wirth
said.
The main contributor to the
world's ecological crisis is not popu
lation growth in developing coun
tries, but the "appetites of affluent
consumers" in the richer nations, he
said.
The damage done by burgeoning
populations and high consumption
and waste manifests itself in the
form of climate change. Wirth ex
plained. Increased carbon dioxide
emissions exacerbate global warm
ing trends. The pre-industrial level
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
was 260 parts per million, while
today, that concentration is more
around 36() parts per million, he
said. The atmosphere is serving as a
"trash barrel."
