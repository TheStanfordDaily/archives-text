# Wirth warns of ecological damage from developed world
## Former Senator talks environment 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
The current generation bears the
responsibility of producing political
leaders to fight ecological destruc
tion. said Timothy Wirth. president
of the United Nations Foundation.
Wirth addressed a crowd of over
3(X) at Kresge Auditorium yester
day afternoon in a talk titled. "De
spair or Determination." He em
phasized that present atmospheric
conditions are at risk due to over
population and the growth of the
human capacity to generate waste.
" The course we are currently on
is unsustainable," he said. "The
numbers are staggering. We should
approach the population problem
with a high sense of urgency."
Over the last 100 years, the
earth's population has quadrupled,
from 1.5 billion to 6 billion people,
and the size of the world economy
has grown 20-fold, said Wirth, who
obtained his doctorate in education
at Stanford in 1973.
However, he argued, the despair
stemming from impending ecologi
cal disasters can be mitigated by a
determined leadership. The chal
lenge is to convey this sense of de

spair while working to solve prob
lems, he said.
"We cannot engender despair."
Wirth said. "One billion people try
to live on $1 a day .... Two billion
lack sanitation."
If world leaders do not agree on
plans of action, the "global fabric of
stability" will be pulled apart by a
"sea of desperate people." Wirth
said.
The main contributor to the
world's ecological crisis is not popu
lation growth in developing coun
tries, but the "appetites of affluent
consumers" in the richer nations, he
said.
The damage done by burgeoning
populations and high consumption
and waste manifests itself in the
form of climate change. Wirth ex
plained. Increased carbon dioxide
emissions exacerbate global warm
ing trends. The pre-industrial level
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
was 260 parts per million, while
today, that concentration is more
around 36() parts per million, he
said. The atmosphere is serving as a
"trash barrel."
"Disease vectors will move to

temperate climates. Glaciers are
receding. We've experienced the
warmest years ever during the last
few years. This is what we know
and see," Wirth said, emphasizing
that much of the ecological damage
and possible changes in climate are
still unknown.
"We're now in the middle of a
mass extinction," Wirth said, not
ing that one happened 65 million
years ago, when dinosaurs became
extinct.
"We think of catastrophic
events as a force of nature. We are
the source," he emphasized.
Wirth maintained that endan
gered species are an important con
cern for humans because "these
species compose the ecological sys
tems of the world. They supply us
with food, filter our water, clear our
air."
Wirth said that the United

States would have to decrease car
bon dioxide emissions by 70 per
cent if emission levels are to stabi
lize. In the 1993 Kyoto Treaty on
climate change, the agreed level of
reduction was only 7 percent by
2010, he said.
For those who support environ
mental protection, but fear the eco
nomic consequences, Wirth said,
"Living off our ecological capital is
a bankrupt policy."
Wirth, who represented Col
orado in the U.S. Senate from 1987
to 1993, was one of the pioneers of
the tradable permits scheme that
utilizes market forces to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
"Good analytic work [in eco
nomics] has led us to understand
true costs," he said. "The market
place can no longer assume no cost
for polluting the air."
Wirth criticized the Clinton ad
ministration for failing to send
Congress a description of the eco
nomic justifications for the Kyoto
Treaty.

"I would be remiss if I didn't say
that the Treasury has done every
thing to kill those studies [on cli
mate change]," Wirth said. The ad
ministration needs to show Con
gress what the options are before it
can expect the treaty to be ratified,
he said.
According to Wirth, politicians
have a responsibility to bring ur
gent environmental issues to the
political table. "The environment
has significant political currency
[these days]," he said.
Global consensus on problem
solving is not unrealistic, Wirth sug
gested.
"At the Cairo conference [on
population control] in 1994, every
one agreed on the need to empow
er women ... to further [their] po
litical and economic engagement,"
he said. "Like so much else, we
want to stick to the program and
make it work."
"I trust that each of you will har
ness this effort, wisdom, and deter
mination [and take action]," Wirth

said.
The United Nations Foundation
was founded earlier this year by
media mogul Ted Turner to sup
port the United Nations' causes
and strengthen their institutions.
Wirth's talk was the inaugural
speech for the Robert Minge
Brown Memorial Lecture. The lec
tureship will be awarded annually
by the Law School's Environmen
tal and Natural Resource Law and
Policy Program to an outstanding
scholar, policymaker or lawyer for
his or her innovative and effective
approaches to addressing environ
mental issues, according to a flyer
distributed by the Law School.
The lectureship was established
by the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation in memory of Robert
Minge Brown, Class of 1931 and
former member of Stanford's
Board of Trustees. Brown attended
Stanford Law School for a year be
fore finishing his law degree at Ox
ford as a Rhodes Scholar. He died
in 1994.
