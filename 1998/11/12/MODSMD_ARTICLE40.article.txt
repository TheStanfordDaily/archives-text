# Interview
## Two men. a mike and a camera 'The Cruise' shows off New York City with some help from a homeless tour guide 
### Laura Norton Contributing writer 
Many filmmakers contend that every documen
tary is a record of relationships. With "The
Cruise," director Bennett Miller ventures into
the life of a homeless New York tour guide, Timothy
"Speed" Levitch. Although Miller disappears into the fab
ric of the film, his influence is everywhere — the film is
truly a collaboration between the filmmaker and his sub
ject. Miller creates a filmic space where Speed wanders
through the urban corridors, challenges the audience's
understanding of the city and "couch surfs," Speed's cre
ative endeavor to find a place to sleep every night.
In"The Cruise" the city becomes a layered space of
historical interpretation, a meshing of information, inter
pretation and desire. With laser-sharp accuracy, Speed's
words cut through our preconceptions of the city and the
guide himself. The tour as a form of entertainment and
information is re-imagined for us.
The Cruise is the name of a philosophy in which
Levitch, and by extension Miller, operates. To oversimpli
fy, the Cruise is a reevaluation of life as a journey.
Intermission had the chance to ask Miller and Levitch to
explain the film and the philosophy themselves.
Intermission: Is the film an effective representation
of what happens during a tour?
Timothy Levitch: Oh yeah. I always thought of the
tour as living theater. It certainly is a theatrical happening
and the audience was an infinity of reactions every time.
I: It seems throughout the film that the facts weren't
always as important as the inner truth of the moment.
TL: That's right on. The emotions were always true.
The history was subsequent.
Bennett Miller: That's true with the film, too. The film
was totally unconcerned with the biographical informa
tion of [Levitch'sJ life. We don't go into the fact that he
was a middle child or what was so wrong with the way his
mother treated him. It's much more about what his pres
ence communicates.
I: Was that your intent for the film when you started
shooting?
BM: Definitely. That's why there's no voice-over or cin
ematic techniques designed to shepherd you through a
certain understanding, or to explain to you what you're
seeing. There is no tour guide of Speed himself. Hopefully
by not really controlling and interpreting the work and
what you're looking at, it sensitizes you to all of the infor
mation.
I: How did the film start to take shape as you were
shooting it?
BM: I think the first really noticeable development was
the dissolving away of self-consciousness and the bring
ing up of Speed's spirit and my cinematic relationship to
it. I think we shot about 70 hours of footage that were
ultimately thrown out before we got to the point where

we were really in sync enough that Speed's self-con
sciousness was so fatigued that it let its guard down
enough to let him out of the box.
I: What was it like getting used to that camera being
theret Did you actually at a certain point forget that it
was there?
TL: It was a specific craft. For a long time I was a walk
ing rough draft. Well, in many ways I still am. But specif
ically in terms of that craft, to turn to an actual camera
and to start babbling is really an exciting opportunity to
surrender to the chaos that is the 20th century — to sur
render myself, to give up my life, and to really carry my
own personal rages, emotions, self-orchestrated purgato
ries and flaunt them in front of a camera.
It took a long time to find these places where I would
come to, where I no longer cared what my brain was
thinking. And my way of doing it, chemically, in the blur
between my mind and my reality, was understanding
eventually that the camera was my lover. I spoke to it lit
erally as a woman that I was falling in love with.
I: So you were speaking to the camera and not really
to Bennett?
TL: Well, of course what is interesting is that the cam
era was an extension of "The Bennett." Bennett and the
camera were some sort of ongoing phantasm and object.
There was certainly an intercourse going on between me
and Bennett.
I: The film suggests you may feel certain alienation
toward society. How has the film affected your relation
ship to other people?
TL: I would say that I am not as alienated as society is.
I have always tried to disassociate from it as much as pos
sible. To be what society calls an outsider, of course, is not
to be outside of the world as much to be outside of soci
ety. You either embrace the world or you reject it. Most of
the misery I know in my own life and I see in other lives
is when we're getting constantly caught up in this vacu
um between those two drastic actions. And I think that
[the philosophy of] "The Cruise" is an understanding
that it's far more courageous, perhaps more insane and
certainly more exciting to embrace the world entirely as it
is, rather than rejecting it.
The film has been a great benevolence and a beautiful
gift from the human race since the greatest ecstasies of
my life have always been connections with human beings.
I: How do you feel now that as a result of the film you
may become a known, recognizable figure?
TL: I would be totally psyched about that, because that
would give me further possibilities to fall entirely into
humanity. And in terms of discussing the Cruise —
which is this strategy for living, which is really just a dis
cussion of joy— I think that we only exist when we're
actually contributing to each other's lives. It reminds me
of a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was cer
tainly cruising. He said, "What is being successful?" Being
successful is when one life on this planet breathes easier
because you're on it.
I: Can you talk about your relationship to documen
tary as portrait — a way perhaps to communicate a lot
of ideas but most powerfully to do it through one figure.
BM: I always found that I've learned things through
individuals, not just information that they have to share
but through their whole being. And so I think that there
is a tremendous amount of depth that can be achieved
through something as limited and small as the portrait.
Like Picasso said, and like Da Vinci said before him,
every portrait is a self-portrait. I think that this kind of
work provides the opportunity to really adventure back
to yourself. As absolutely different a person as Timothy is

from me outwardly — the elements, the components and
the circumstances of our lives — I still identify with him
and with his place in this world.
I: How did you work with your editor?
BM: I worked with a great editor named Michael
Levine. Really, it was a matter of becoming intimate with
the footage, seeing what spoke to us and realizing what
the arc of this thing was going to be, which is a peeling
back of layers, the process of getting intimate with an
individual over 76 minutes.
Our start point is where Speed is a total curiosity, an
oddity. You don't know what to make of him. Here is an
outsider with a lot of passion getting no credit from the
life and civilization around him. Looking at that with
some bit of affection was the ultimate end and anything
that spoke to that found its way into the film.
I: Where did you learn about the cityf
TL: My approach to history was similar to the way
Charlie Parker approached a standard song — it is a riff.
It is an understanding that the song is a launching pad
into further realms, but not a destination. It's a bebop
equation' where he's using those notes to take him to a
new place. That's what I do with history.
History is not a destination on my tour. It is a launch
into the next and further realm where the deeper issues of
our lives really reside. So for that reason I think it became
pretty easy for me to amass information and knowledge.
I'm really good at memorizing stuff like that because I
have such an innate disrespect for it. I picked on histori
cal knowledge so I could molest it, so that I could play
with it. It was like the clay for the sculpture that is the
tour.
BM: Sometimes I honestly feel like Speed just has an
innate knowledge and just needs to be reminded of the
history once somebody mentions it I've been on a walk
ing tour with him where he'll be talking about something,
and somebody on the tour will have some bit of infor
mation that Speed was not familiar with. And then the
next time we are in that neighborhood, Speed will bring
it up with an authority that this person never possessed.
I: Was there ever a concern about misrepresentation?
BM: I think literally that one of the only concerns that
Speed had was that he wanted included somewhere in the
film the fact that he purposely molests the history of New
York City.
What we did include was this one shot where he's talk
ing about the parameters of New York geographically and
population-wise and he mentions that the population is
2.4 million people. And then he clicks off the mike and he
turns towards the camera and says, *T learned recently
that that it's 1.4 million people, but I don't care." I think
if you're paying attention, the film is filled with little indi
cators. To me when you see that you realize that every
thing that he's said to this point, everything that he's
going to say after is like, give or take .7 million
TL: I am not an addict of meaning. I don't need mean
ing to enjoy an afternoon.


Hey, pal, look at me when I'm talkin' to youl


Kumbayah, kumbayah...
