## A 						night in the life of Stanford fear and loathing in Los Angeles A 						savage journey into the heart of Pasadena 
### Chaney Rankin Contributing writer 
Stanford does not have a reputation for a raging social life. (We sneeringly leave that distinction to Cal State Chico.) In an attempt to explore thai stereotype, we at
asked four ol ow writers to tell us how they spent a particular Saturday night. They spared no details, however gruesome or potentially embarrassing. Call this Real World: Stanfor<i

Author's note: Everyone in this
story is, of course, a law-abiding
citizen and therefore 21. Especially
the freshmen.
10:37 p.m.: I am riding towards the
Band Shak on my bike at breakneck
speed, mainly because it's all downhill
from the Women's Center. I have just got
ten off work and I am preparing to
embark on 48-plus hours of mad revelry,
extreme drunkenness, and possibly a
football game. It's L.A. Roadtrip weekend,
and 1 am a member of that group of poor
lost souls known as the Stanford Band.
Everv year we accompany the team to
L.A. when it plavs either UCLA or USC.
It's been going on so long that we've
developed traditions for almost every
thing we do. Frankly, if you've been on
one road trip, you have been on them all,
but somehow it never stops being tun.
10:40. p.m.: Upon stepping inside the
Shak, 1 am greeted by the usual sketchy
Shak smell mingled with the odor of alco
hol. We're going on four buses, divided up
more or less by sexion. I'm on the good
bus — Drumz (that's me), Tenrz (as in
saxophones) and accessories (Dollies,
Tree and various yell leaders). We have
already given $18 each to our, ahem, sup
pliers for the evening and are prepared to
consume, over the weekend, about 55 gal
lons of yummy mixed drinks.
10:48 p.m.: I realize that, for the third
year in a row, 1 have forgotten to pack my
lovely Dining Services mug. 1 think Fate
keeps trying to stop me from drinking,
but I foil her evil plans by securing a
Fruitopia bottle. Upon discovering that
the Tenrz have got a nice cooler full of
Cosmopolitan, I officially begin my
evening.
11:00.p.m.: Last year, I was drunk
before the buses even left the Shak. This
year, I realize, 1 am drunk before the buses
have even arrived. Awww yeah.
11:29. p.m.: The buses are finally here.
We pile on as fast as possible in order to
get good seats that we won't use since
we'll all just crowd into the aisle anyway.
12:19 a.m.: Three nanoseconds after
the bus begins to move, the Tree and I
howl "ROAD TRIIII1IIP!!!" at the tops of
our lungs. Our trip has begun.
12:20 to 3:00 a.m.: The raging lasts for
a few hours. A Dollie discovers that the
cooler spout in the luggage rack above her
seat is prone to leakage, and when we stop
at McDonald's at 5 a.m., she has to wash
the Electric Kool-Aid out of her hair. An

orgy forms briefly in one seat while every
one else looks on with undisguised inter
est.
4:53.a.m.: We arrive at a McDonald's
in Buttonwillow that opens at 5 a.m. We
crowd around the doors and harass the
opening staff until they let us in. Our
drum major climbs up on the roof.
6:23 a.m.: 1 wake up once and realize
that our bus is clinking. Upon reflection,
1 realize that it's the sound of dozens of
used whippets rolling around on the floor
every time we turn.
8:05.a.m.: We are awakened by a loud
drummer waving a bottle of Jim Beam in
everyone's faces. A disturbingly large
number of people accept.
9:00.a.m.: We have finally arrived at

the Century Wilshire in Westwood, the
only hotel that still accepts reservations
from us. We shower the thin layer of slime
off of ourselves.
3:09 p.m.: Time for the Band's most
time-honored L.A. tradition: We appear
en masse at Fatburger, a local greasy burg
er joint. Mmmm, hangover with cheese.
4:18 p.m.: A few of us stick around to
watch five guys attempt to prove their
manhood by doing the Duff. This consists
of a Double King Egg Chili Cheeseburger
with bacon, a large order of Chili Cheese
Fries, and a large diet Coke. This year, a
former Tree, Matt Merrill, gets it down in
11:45, but a trumpet astounds us all by
finishing in 10:55. For the rest of the
night, none of the five wants to hear
another word about food.
The rest of the night: A few of us wan
der the halls of the hotel looking for gath
erings. We start a game of "I never" in one
room but it gets broken up by the man
agement, a process that is oft-repeated
throughout the night. We end up smok
ing out and watching a horrible soft-core
lesbian porn mafia thriller movie.
Sometime later: One person has

already been kicked out of my boyfriend's
room so I can stay there. Another of his
roommates wanders in to find his bed
occupied as well. He swears for a while
and then wanders off to find an empty
bed. I laugh. Then I find out they weren't
just sleeping over there. I shudder.
Sunday, 12:00 p.m.: We drag our sorry
selves out of bed and down to the court
yard for beer and doughnuts, only to dis
cover that the bus drivers all went to the
stadium without us. I'm mad because we
could have slept for another hour.
1:30.p.m.: The bus drivers come back
for us. We immediately commence drink
ing.
3:30 p.m.: Kickoff.
3:41 p.m.: We arrive at the stadium.
Oops.
The rest of the afternoon: We watch
tne game and are stunned to discover that
we aren't immediately losing. At halftime,
1 m Keeping an eve on our stuff in the
stands, and I have to stop a drunken
Stanford frat boy trom stealing my drum
and attempting to take the field with the
rest of the Band. He spills my Coke, the
bastard.
Unsurprisingly, the game is not the
highlight of the trip. I pretty much lose
track of time at this point. After the game
we get back on the buses and go to In-n-
Out. We sprint (or in my case, hobble
really fast) and most of the drummers
make it to the front of the line. This too is
a time-honored tradition. Even though
there are now two In-n-Outs near cam
pus, we still behave as if we only get to eat
it once a year.
We get back on the buses and settle in
for a night of raging. No sleep 'till
Stanford, right? (This never actually hap
pens.) I join a group of people in the mid
dle of the bus who feel like singing, and
we run through everything we can think
of, including Madonna, Paul Simon and
the Beastie Boys. Having lost my
Fruitopia bottle long ago, I have to use an
open cup to drink my screwdriver. This
backfires when some asshole from up
front decides to start a game of bus rugby.
We all hate him and I spend the rest of the
trip wearing my drink. This does not stop
me from fixing another one.
We sing into the wee hours, long past
the point of tolerance from the front of
the bus. One by one people drop off until
it's just me, another girl and an extremely
macho guy from my sexion who astounds
me by being a huge Indigo Girls fan. We
sing every song from "Rites of Passage,"
but even I pass out finally, and fall asleep
to the sound of the back of the bus play
ing Truth or Dare.
