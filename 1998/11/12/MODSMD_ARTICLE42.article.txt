# Homecoming

Note: Not for the weak of heart.
It's not the normal way I spend my
weekends. I'm back from Stanford jour
nalism school for my college homecoming
in Boston and the girl to my right is talk
ing about how the guy she's seeing never
gets an erection. Forget orgasm. Erection.
It's striking me as funny that this girl is
sharing such insanely personal informa
tion with me, a guy she met a half hour
ago. Then again, I am massaging her foot.
I remember how I got there. I was at a
club, actually. Okay, I was at a party in the
Tufts University cafeteria. The early '90s
rap was pumping like a fighter jet and I
was packed in with people I could split
into three categories: those I was psyched
were there; those I was not psyched were
there; and those I didn't know. With those
in the first category, I exchanged hugs and
shouted conversations over wailing
Hammer. Mutual snubbing with those of
the second. Scamming on the females in
the third.
I had arrived that morning on a redeye
from San Francisco and by the second
hour of this party my head throbbed. Four
of us decided to go to a friend's house off
campus. The friend happened to be a for
mer girlfriend of mine. Like it did on
overnight trips in eighth grade, the talk
became instantly sexual. Hence the sordid
details of flaccidity and the debate over
whether this guy had reverse priaprism.
This girl's eyes narrowed as she looked at
me. I was thankful she wasn't just tired
when a de-shoed foot suddenly landed in
my lap.
I was grateful for my health but started
to sweat over whether there was an inverse
correlation between the size of this man's
member and his overall build. I was think
ing he might have the violent tendencies of
Marcellus Wallace. I was also thinking,
"Why does this pretty girl with her lovely
white-socked feet not turn on her
boyfriend?"
We exchanged what 1 thought were
seductive "come-up-to-my-room" glances
and I gradually ignored the rest of the peo
ple in the conversation. Then, a turn for
the worse. Dialogue suddenly, mysterious
ly, turned to thoughts on one-night hook
ups. I winced. I was back to San Francisco
the next afternoon.
"Not into them. Will never have them,"
she said, getting up to go to bed. Goodbye,
foot.
The next morning we were friendly at
the football game. I noticed she was drink
ing a 40-ounce Bud Light in a narrow,
elongated can. Any connection?
