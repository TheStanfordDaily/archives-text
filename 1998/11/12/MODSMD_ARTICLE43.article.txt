# Hanging by the phone
## The 						truth about a quiet evening at home 
### Courtney Lake Contributing writer 
The dance beat pumped in the background and all heads turned as I entered the
room. I remember hearing Sister Sledge's "He's the Greatest Dancer" as our eyes
met. He was a tall dark handsome type with chiseled features and a mop of black
hair that fell over his right eye. His pants clung tightly to those "key areas" and his pecs
rippled under the thin white cotton shirt he was wearing. He sauntered over to me and
asked if I was there alone. I coyly looked up and said yes. I was mesmerized by his brown
eyes with flecks of gold and taken aback by. the way the light danced on his moist lips.

As he leaned forward to kiss me, I shut my eyes and realized
that I was not at the Cafe chatting with my hunky demi-god but
instead staring blankly at my sociology notes waiting for Mr.
Dreamboat to call.
Now begins the process that I have become oh-so-good at:
waiting. So I wait. I practice this new dance move I saw in the
most recent Janet Jackson video and finally get it down to a
level of proficiency that would surely get me a spot on her next
tour. I wait some more. I now pretend to be a Broadway star
and start to lip-sync "Rent." I decide that I would make a pret
ty good angel and make a mental note to find a "Santa's Helper"
costume and a pair of go-go boots. I go and check the phone to
see if it is working. The dial tone is still there and the operator
says my line is clear.
"OK," 1 think, "He has gotten into an accident and now is a
bloody heap on the side of the road." Then 1 realize he lives
across campus and that I have yet to see bloody corpses piled
high along the curb during my four years here. Just before I am

about to lose cool points and call him, the phone rings.
"Yes!" I yell as 1 run to the phone and wait for it to ring a second time, to make it look
like 1 am not really desperate for a date with a cute guy but have been busy with my
homework or feeding needy children in Third World countries. So 1 prepare myself to
answer the phone on the second ring and it doesn't ring again. "What the hell! God
damn freakin' phone is a piece of shit," I cry as I pray to the gods for the phone to ring
again.
1 pick up the receiver and hear the all-too-familiar dial tone. "1 hate life. I need to
become a chaste monk." Then I realize that would mean no more J. Crew and I make
another mental note that 1 have to look at the clearance catalog.
Feeling dejected and bitter, clearly a winning combo on a Saturday evening, I lay into
my roommate's Haagen Daz mango sorbet. Fifteen minutes later, the pint is empty and
I realize that a pint of anything, unless it is Guinness, is a bad thing. So now 1 am being
stood up, have a stomachache, and am contemplating becoming an alcoholic.
"I hate men," I say out loud. "I should just date women from now on. They are so
much nicer to me. They compliment me. They dress so much better than guys and they
smell like flowers." I decide at that moment that I will give up my previous desires and
now only date women.
Then I realize that they whole gay thing might get in the way. Having a desire for "cer
tain equipment" and all can really place a damper on intimate moments. But then,

strap-ons could be an option. I mean, I think I could be happy if my boyfriend had
breasts and a strap-on. It might take some getting used to, but it is worth the
Fortunately, I am jangled out of my really twisted and sick psychoanalysis of poten
tial lovers by the phone. I run over to the phone, say "Fuck you" to being coy and answer
it on the first ring. Then I hear his voice and he asks me what I am doing, and I melt.
All the stinging and biting remarks that I had prepared to insult him and his family
lineage with are forgotten and replaced by a simple, "Oh, nothing much."
"Wanna watch a movie?" he says.
I weigh my options and decide that I don't want to delve back into my "lover with a
strap-on scenario" and say, "Sure".

"Have you eaten?" I ask.
"Not yet," he responds.
"Wanna come over for dinner?" I ask, trying to figure out
where my Stanford vocabulary has gone, considering I am now
reduced to words like "wanna."
"Sure," he says. We make plans for 7 p.m.
"1 tortured myself for a three-minute conversation," 1 think.
"God, I am a loser. You should have told him how you really
felt. You are a sucker," my inner conscience says.
"But," retaliates my inner devil, "He is a sucker who is going
to get some tonightl"
1 mentally give the little red dude a high five and go about
trying to figure out how to work the oven. Remember, I am
cute, not domestic. I glance at the clock and see that it is 6:15
p.m. OK, 1 have 45 minutes to shower, shave, dress, cook din
ner, set the table and look like Martha Stewart during the
whole process.

6:17 p.m. I go upstairs and run through the shower, making sure to wash those areas
that might receive extra-special attention.
6:25 p.m. Which outfit to wear? Cheap and easy? No. Trendy and chic? No, too many
buttons. Artsy and cute? Yes, black is always a good color for me. Plus, it hides wrinkles.
6:35 p.m. Dinner. What to cook? I open the refrigerator and I see a bell pepper, an
onion, a bottle of something brown and chicken fillets. Out of this is born "chicken and
peppers." (Which, FYI, turned out damned good!)
6:57 p.m. The table is set, complete with a bottle of wine, and the chicken is simmer
ing. The sounds of Ella Fitzgerald are wafting through the apartment and my outfit is
still intact. Mind you, I still have three minutes to spare.
As I remove the apron, I hear a knock at the door and he arrives. He smiles and gives
me a kiss on the cheek as he steps inside and comments on how wonderful everything
looks and smells.
1 laugh and say it was just a little something that 1 threw together. He asks me how my
day has been so far, and 1 reply to him, "Oh, you know, same oP same oP."
