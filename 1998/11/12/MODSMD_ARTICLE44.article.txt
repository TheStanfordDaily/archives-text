# A 						date at Stanford
## It happens 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
Saturday afternoon, driving around
campus, I asked Dave, "So, do you
want to go out to eat with me
tonight?"
A date? At Stanford? A boy and a girl
leaving campus alone to have dinner?
After months of doing this with the same
cute guy, the idea and the actual event is
still exciting and strange to me. Exciting
because eating out is always a luxury
(especially with a hot date), and strange
because no one else here seems to do it.
But there we were on Saturday night,
driving down University Avenue with no

clue about where to eat. He suggests
California Pizza Kitchen because I love
the place — so close to Stanford, always
satisfying ... Oh, wait, I'm not writing a
restaurant review.
So on with the night. We finish dinner
and get ice cream cones in downtown
Palo Alto before heading off to the bowl
ing alley. 1 was under the assumption
that we would spend the night bowling
with a mixed group of his friends, but
instead I find myself sharing a lane with
six hyper male graduate students.
And, despite the fact that I couldn't
hold a finger to their bowling skills, I sur
prisingly had fun at the Palo Alto Bowl.
On Saturday nights after 10 p.m., they

turn down the lights and turn up the
music, making it a lively place to hang
out and relax with friends.
After bowling several games we walk
across the street to Lyon's, where as usual
the service is slow, the food terrible, and
the conversation questionable. Some
thing about foreskin and lettuce — I
swear I wasn't listening to these boys
match wits with each other.
By that time, it wasn't Saturday night
anymore, so I suppose I'm not permitted
to talk about the remaining three hours
before I went to sleep.
Too bad.
