## Schmuck & Putz Dehydrated 'Waterboy' could use a few more drinks 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Schmuck and Putz made a breakthrough this week in their 12-step-program. After
being held down for four weeks by their ruthless slavemaster Kong, who force-fed
videos that nobody cares about and told them to analyze the cultural implications
of "Showgirls," they were finally allowed out of their padded cages. They went to the
movies.
"The screen is so big," remarked Putz in amazement. "And look, there are other peo
ple in the theater tool" commented a drooling Schmuck. It's an experience that they'll
remember for the rest of their lives: their first time at the cinema...

Putz: Kathy Bates must feel so proud of herself.
After snatching an Academy Award for her magnifi
cent performance in "Misery," she's now been
reduced to the mind-numbing antics of Adam
Sandler. And it's not a pretty sight. Director Frank
Coraci and co-writers Sandler and Tim Herlihy have
Bates (playing a ridiculously overbearing mama to
Sandler's moron Bobby Boucher) serving up scorpi
on and squirrel, all the while craving attention in the
background of some potentially funny scenes. What
a waste.
On the whole, Sandler's latest effort is a mixed
bag. It's a big step up from the uninspired lunacy of
"Billy Madison," but doesn't even come close to the
heartfelt, tender comedy of "The Wedding Singer."
The script here is funny, but its writers might as well
have been on crack. Scratch that. This script was def
initely written under the influence of something, or
by a four-year-old. Scratch that. I meant toddler.

The highly complicated plot follows: Bobby Boucher lives at home with his mother
at the age of 31 and has never kissed a girl. When the opportunity arises to serve as
waterboy for South Central Louisiana State University, Boucher grabs the ball and runs,
discovering his hidden talents for tackling along the way. Bobby becomes a football sen
sation overnight, unbeknownst to his mother, who claims that everything from "foos
ball" to "girls" is the devil.
There are certainly moments of promise interspersed in the confused footage.
Boucher gets enough hilarious mileage out of his whole profession: There are pH tests,
suggestion boxes and even a cute little outfit with water tanks strapped to his body. It's
when Boucher gets psycho that the whole film goes awry.
Schmuck: I think you're the psycho one here. OK, it's good to know that you're even
a bigger putz than your name suggests. I think I'm going out on a limb here, but who
cares? You're a flat-out prick.
"Waterboy" is the best comedy of the year. An unbelievably hilarious story, this movie
is led by the "champion of morons" — Adam Sandler. This man rules!

Movies need some more mentally challenged heroes. Adam Sandler is at the top of
my list for "Waterboy" followed by Tom Hanks for "Forrest Gump," and last but not
least, Adam Sandler for "Billy Madison." These are heroes that we can aspire to and actu
ally become. Forget Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. They are too good
looking and too cool, but Adam Sandler and Tom Hanks — I can be like them.
Sometimes I just feel like I'm not up to snuff with the Stanford crowd; I feel like I don't
belong — but Bobby Boucher says that I can be someone.
In "Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks made major ground in the heroic quest of an absolute
moron, but in"The Waterboy," Sandler surpasses him in ways he could only dream of
aspiring to. I feel confident to say that absolute moronism is beautifully achieved in
"Waterboy." As an absolute moron, I feel Adam Sandler brings my fellow audience mem-

bers and me to his level. For once, I can relate to
what's happening on the screen. Putz, don't tell me
that you don't have fears of one day waking up and
being 31, living with your mom and being a gimp
for the football team.

Putz: I'm charmed to see that Hollywood is final
ly catering to your type. But I cannot extend the
same warmth to Sandler. "The Waterboy" just miss
es the mark of Farrelly-brother type humor. While
Fairuza Balk ("The Craft") plays Bobby's girl Vicki
with a helluva lot of piss and vinegar, she's no
Cameron Diaz — at least not in my book. For you,
Schmuck, it probably wouldn't matter since you'd
take any girl you could get your paws on.
Henry Winkler is out of his element here as the
insane coach of the team. To say that he overacts is
an understatement. Frankly, "Happy Days" should
be his only days.

On a more positive note, it was nice of the film's publicity team to give us free hats
and cups at the screening. But who are they kidding? Not even a Tickle-Me-Elmo could
get me to praise this film.
Schmuck: The funniest part of this movie was when the bugs gathered together in a
rebellion against the cockroaches. Then that big she came down and tried to stomp on
all the ants, but everything turned out okay because that lovely Randy Newman song
came on, and saved the day. This is what made the film in my eyes.
Putz: What are you, a moron? That was the preview for "A Bug's Life" before the
movie.
Schmuck: Oh.
The Bottom Line:
Schmuck: Kill for tickets.
Putz: Maim for them if you're really drunk.


This feels real good if you get it in the right spot!
