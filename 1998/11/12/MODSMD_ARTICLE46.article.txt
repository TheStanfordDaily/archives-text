## Terror in the hearts of men 'The Siege' is a striking look at the effects of modern terrorism 
### 
Edward Zwick's "The Siege" is a commendable film — commendable because it
shows us both sides of modern terrorism, not only the "Let's go out and get us an
A-rab" mentality of movies such as "True Lies" and "Air Force One."
The plot goes a little something like this: There are three bloody World Trade Center
style bombings in New York and the FBI isn't able to keep up with each new terrorist
bombing group. The CIA is involved, but not being helpful (ah, big government at
work), so the president declares martial law in New York and the army moves in to find
the last bombers before they strike.
The movie offers a striking perspective on the issue of terrorism by giving us a scene
in which all Brooklyn men of Arabic descent are herded into Yankee Stadium for ques
tioning. We see civil backlash to martial law and some coming together of Brooklynites
to protest the Army's presence in New York. There is an FBI agent of Arabic descent on
the good side of the ball (Tony Shaloub, best known from the TV show "Wings") who
must choose between his country and his heritage when the U.S. government jails his
child. Is Hollywood trying to atone for some of its previous racism? At least it's trying,
in my book.
But "The Siege" is also a good movie for its analysis of the problems of racism in ter
rorism. Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) is the FBI man-in-charge, Elise Kraft
(Annette Bening) is the CIA representative and General William Devereaux (Bruce
Willis) is the final heavy hitter from the Army. All three actors give very good perfor

mances of three powerful people and their attempts to solve a growing terrorist crisis of
epic proportions. Hubbard and Devereaux go head to head, leaving the mysterious CIA
agent Kraft to choose sides in the war for liberties.
Tony Shaloub transcends his previous comedic acting and gives a very convincing
performance in his dramatic role. Bening's rumpled CIA agent is probably the best per
formance on the screen. She starts off mysterious and in charge and ends up close to
the viewer's heart as a woman trying to atone for past mistakes. A romantic spark
between her and Washington exists in the movie, but it's never pursued, keeping the
movie on a straight and serious path about terrorism and the loss of civil liberties.
Many Hollywood movies overdo the gore, but this film's use of blood and guts is lim
ited and very effective. One of the most powerful shots in this movie is one of a lady
walking out of a bombed theater, looking unscathed but dazed. As she passes out toward
the screen, the bloody stump of her arm becomes apparent, and the juxtaposition of her
beauty and her injury really hits home.
Overall, this movie is definitely worth going to see. It's not an action flick like some
of the big names in it may suggest, but rather a serious look at the loss of freedom that
comes with terrorist danger. The Denzel vs. Bruce theme is the crux of this movie
because of their different methods of crime-fighting and problem-solving, and they are
possibly one of the most interesting on-screen duos I have seen in a while.
