# Brad is a 'Black' beauty
## He plays no ordinary 'Joe' (But he is a stallion) 
### 
The essential and unnerving lesson in "Meet Joe
Black" is the inevitability of death. From nearly
the first scene we understand that Anthony
Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish, will die. When the
Reaper, in the form of, yes, Brad Pitt, comes on the scene,
we are reminded of this fact again and again.
Throughout the movie you'll think, "Hey, this is a movie,
he won't die." But he does. That's not a spoiler. It's a part
of life that this movie treats with great respect and con
sideration.
In short, this film is about the persona of Death, a.k.a.
Joe Black, who comes to earth on a "holiday" with the
intention of learning about the modern world and the
people who inhabit it. For his guide, he chooses Bill
Parrish, a kind and worldly media magnate with two lov
ing daughters. Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) apparently
plans parties for a living. Susan (Claire Forlani) is a doc
tor.
Now, if you have to go up to the Pearly Gates, you

could have worse escorts than Brad Pitt. He's amazing.
We all think he's cute when he's not doing weird things
to his hair. But in parts of this film, the strange innocence
of a character who does not really know the world, com
bined with his incredible face, is almost too much.
Despite the fact that death brings thoughts of hideous
decay and putrefaction, in this film, Death wears a face
from heaven. It softens the blow for Bill Parrish and
brings luminescence to a movie that could otherwise be
so shadowed.
Inevitably, there is a romance, and this one effectively
convinces us that it is one of those timeless true loves. It
can't be anything else — Death probably doesn't have
flings. Forlani is wonderfully fragile and human, and
more importantly she has a wonderful truthfulness
about her. She's not just an actress acting, but a real per
son in the midst of experiences that are almost incom
prehensible.
The film has some of that icky Hollywood quality

where every scene, room, and restaurant is perfect, shiny
and bright, slaved over by some set designer. This world
of the incredibly rich grates a bit. The final scenes are set
at a party that is unfortunately reminiscent of the party
scenes in the recent Harrison Ford flick "Sabrina." It's a
world of fantasy that doesn't play in real life. When it's
blown up 100 times larger on screen it's far too much to
take.
The last five minutes of the film are "Meet Joe
Black" 's only failing. One senses the influence of test
audiences and focus groups. Sometimes people don't
know what's good for them. In this case, what's supposed
to be a kind of happy ending compromises ihe integrity
of the rest of the film. The attempt at feel-good is not at
all comforting and it demeans the love between the enti
ty that is Death, and his girl, a lovely lady doctor from
New York.
