## furslide 'Adventure' 
### 
The alternative movement was a response to technically capable bands with little
inspiration and songs which were ultimately boring. Bands such as Nirvana and
Pavement, though not comprised of excellent instrumentalists, brought imagi
nation and originality back into pop music and paved the way for the hit bands of today.
Furslide's new album, "Adventure," (Virgin) reminds one of those bands the alterna
tive artists replaced. Nearly perfect technically, it is largely devoid of the inspiration one
would expect from a '90s rock band.
Furslide is fronted by Jennifer Turner, who played guitar and sang background on

Natalie Merchant's solo debut, "Tigerlily." It is clear that she
is the leader of Furslide. Her voice and writing dominate the
proceedings. She does have quite a voice; the problem is that
it isn't terribly distinctive. Although at times it is reminiscent
of Joan Osborne or Meredith Brooks, there's nothing partic
ularly interesting or unique about it.
The record is produced by veteran producer Nellee
Hooper, whose other credits include U2, Madonna, Tina
Turner, Tracy Chapman and Bjork. The music starts out as
typical '90s rock — not as soft as most of the female-led
music played on the radio, but not ground-breaking. The
experience of the band and the producer results in the album
sounding wonderful, but cannot overcome the mediocre
material.
Things get better as the album progresses and trip-hop
beats emerge over the rock 'n' roll which comprises the early
part of the album. One of the more unusual songs on the
album is "Faith," a slow, string-drenched number. The lyrics
are also more engaging: "I try to hold on and I try to rise
above and I try too hard / Sometimes faith is not
enough / But faith's the only saving grace I face / Everything's
in its place." Even in this song, though, the minor key with
major bridge seems a bit too obvious and calculated.
. Another notable song is "Postcard," a coy song featuring
acoustic instruments and computer-generated sounds over a

steady beat. The lyrics are more abstract: "The sweetness of
my freedom was buried and the breeze spreads the dust like disease." But these lyrics
ultimately work well in the context of the song.
Unfortunately, these better moments are rare, and I can recommend no other song
on the album. There's just nothing else that unexpected. The band has potential, but
does not have what it takes to write an innovative album. If this record were on a friend's
stereo, I wouldn't ask them to take it off. It's just that 1 wouldn't mind if they did.
