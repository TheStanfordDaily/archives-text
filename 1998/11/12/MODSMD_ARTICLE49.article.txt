## The
						Ponzi Scheme' 
### 
Firewater's new release, "The Ponzi
Scheme," is not necessarily the kind
of album you'd expect to come
from Tod Ashley. As the ex-lead singer
and bassist of the early '90s band Cop
Shoot Cop, a metal-and-industrial-influ
enced noise group, his musical sound was
usually aggressive and often innovative.
When Cop Shoot Cop broke up in 1995,
Ashley moved on to form Firewater,
more of an extension of his own vision
than a traditional rock band.
Firewater's first release, "Get Off the
Cross," in 1996, demonstrated a mix of
folk and straightforward rock in songs
that often tried to explore new territory
for Ashley and the rest of the band. The
rest of the band, however, did not make it
to Firewater's latest, "The Ponzi Scheme,"
on Universal Records. With only Ashley
and violinist Flahn Rowe as the returning
members on the new album, there is a
definite change in style and feel from
Firewater's first effort, mostly coming in
the form of Oren Kaplan on guitar,
George Javori on drums and Tim Otto on
sax.
"The Ponzi Scheme" starts out with an
instrumental track, "Ponzi's Theme,"
which plays like a theme from an old TV
show and demonstrates Ashley's respect

for '60s film and television. The next two
songs have a sound that's part Stone
Temple Pilots, part generic alterna-rock,
and part '60s pop. The dark and often
cynical lyrics on the album include such
lines as "Says he's feeling fine / But that's
just the drugs he's on." (Indeed, there are
points in this album when you think
Firewater has been doing serious drugs
during the recording sessions.)
"El Borracho," a track that sounds like
some sort of twisted Irish jig thanks to a
girls' marching band providing the
instrumental background, contrasts
greatly with "Knock 'tin Down" and its
gospel-style melody. "So Long Super
man" uses an organ to bring across its
repetitive bassline and power-pop feel.
The last track, "Drunkard's Lament," and
its Latin-influenced cabaret rock, seems
to sum up the entire album: markedly
strange to listen to, sometimes intriguing,
and definitely different if not exactly
enjoyable. Ashley's deep voice spawns a
sorrowful sound throughout all of the
songs, which might be a perfect comple
ment to a depressive mood.
Play this CD when you're feeling down
and want to stay down. But if you listen
to it any other time, it probably won't
make much sense.
