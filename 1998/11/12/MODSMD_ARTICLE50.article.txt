## 'Bay Area's Greatest Hits' 
### 
(( represent the Yay Area," E-40 so proudly proclaims in many of his songs. The
[ Bay Area has developed a reputation for having a unique style of West-Coast
JL hip-hop. "4080," a hip-hop magazine which has remained the dominant rap
publication in Northern California, attempts to capture the essence of this music with
its first volume of "Bay Area's Greatest Hits." This compilation of hip-hop's finest
include MCs that have always represented the Bay Area to the fullest The list includes
the Luniz, Dru Down, IT the Bigga Figga, Souls of Mischef, Digital Underground, E-40
and Too Short.
Unfortunately, only one new track is included on this album; old anthems that
remind us of the good old days dominate throughout. The album has some flaws, for
the publishers of the magazine accidentally threw in a few names that only embar
rassed the Bay Area past. Why would the magazine with such strong street credibility
want to include the Oakland black sheep MC Hammer?
The pimp mentality of the Bay Area emerges as Dru Down recites his legendary
"Pimp of the Year," Too Short complains about the "Girl (Cocaine) That's Your Life"
and Digital Underground tells us about the "Freaks of the Industry." The players rep
resent on tracks such as "Game Recognize Game" by IT the Bigga Figga and "Captain
Save a Hoe" by E-40 and the Click. The Souls of Mischief bring us the most lyrically
sharp track of the compilation with "93 'til Infinity." The highlight of the compilation
is the Luniz's "I Got Five On It," possibly one of the most memorable recordings to
emerge from the Bay Area. Yukmouth recites, "Player / Give me some brew an' I might
just chill / But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill / I'm steal
doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it I got some bucks on it / But it ain't enuff on
it / Go get the St. Ides / Never the less I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette / So
pass it 'cross the table like Ping Pong I'm gone / Beatin' my chest like King Kong / It's
on."
The album concludes with the collaboration of Dru Down, B Legit, Richie Rich,
Shock G, Numskull, Rhythm & Green, Mac Mall, Dwayne Wiggins and Danesha on
"Worldwide," capturing the overall taste that dominates throughout the album in one
song. This compilation does a nice job giving props to all the people from the Bay Area
that made significant contributions to the hip-hop community.
