## Straight out of St. Louis Son Volt's country rocks San Francisco 
### 
It's a sold-out Wednesday at the Fillmore Auditorium. Trendy twenty-somethings in
Polartec and leather crowd the galleries and the chandeliered UtuKc tbor s
own Andrew Duplantie delivers the obligatory Angst-with-Solo-Guitar opener,
through endless rounds of pollfe applause and "This-ain t-no-Coliseum" bottled
designer beer. And then, at the stroke of nine, the stage lights come up. Four scruffy guys
stroll out, throw on instruments, and launch into their first tune with all the pomp and
bravado of a frat party backup band. But wait... there's something oddly familiar about
this sound. Driving, acoustic-y guitars, peppy drums, dour, understated vocals. The
crowd nods and sways. Here and there, an actual smile breaks out. Because hey, wait,
isn't this the Gin Blossoms? Well, actually, no. But at $18.50 a head, on a weeknight in
1998, probably close enough.
This latest pretender to the Alt-Country throne is in fact Son Volt, in town to pro
mote its new album, "Wide Swing Tremolo." It is actually the band's third release, fol
lowing 1995's "Trace" and 1997's "Straightaways." Of course, unless you happen to hail
from the Midwest yourself, you've probably never heard anything off either of those
records. Son Volt's debut was critically acclaimed but popularly snubbed on the coasts,
and the follow-up was simply sophomoric. Lead vocalist Jay Ferrar, guitar brothers Dave
and Jim Boquist and drummer Mike Heidom are clearly hoping the third time's the
charm, and their upbeat, eclectic compilation may be just the ticket to national recog
nition.
This isn't Ferrar's first strfb at fame. Folk-country fans will remember him from music
critics' darling Uncle Tupelo, which split over "internal differences" shortly after the
release of 1994's "Anodyne." Way back when such acts as Counting Crows were domi
nating the national airwaves, Son Volt and fellow Tupelo offshoot Wilco were busy tak
ing St. Louis and being optimistically hailed as the Next Big Alternative Thing. Then
mainstream alternative fell out of fashion, and Son Volt was left in trend limbo. Today,

listening to "Wide Swing Tremolo," it Is hard to i tc feeling that Son Volt is less
lnuxuUHiin actual experimentation than in jttst covering the bases.
If the new album marks a stvli.Ttlc from "Straightaways" and "Tracerit is
mainly in the slnse that it replace ole (aaimtusdly successhdffifeulaJkth several oth
ers. There are some promising numbers such as the sparse, acoustic "Carry You Down"
and the slow, bluesy "Streets that Time Walks," but the album as a whole feels scripted.
It is also ironic, given the band's efforts at redefinition, that Son Volt's most innova
tive and compelling efforts were so feebly represented in Wednesday's 90-minute, 23-
song set. The emphasis was on midtempo, guitar-heavy alt-pop that was lyrically clever
but instrumentally uninspired. Son Volt's richer, more varied folk- and country
inspired numbers were relegated to a five-song interlude in the middle of the show and
the two extended encores. Were they saving the best for last, or just filling in with set
list rejects? At worst, the members of Son Volt have questionable taste in their own
music. At best, they lack the confidence and live experience to showcase their very best
work. Either way, the results are disappointing.
"Sounds like 1963, but for now sounds like heaven," croons Ferrar in "Windfall," a
single off Trace and one of the high points in Wednesday night's set. The best songs on
"Wide Swing Tremolo" are those that don't stray too far from Son Volt's old-school folk
and country roots.
Unfortunately, the band's "new" sound seems rooted in a more recent and decidedly
less compelling brand of nostalgia. If 1993 still sounds like heaven to you, Ferrar and
Co.'s latest effort may be just the ticket. Of course, before you head up to the register
with "Wide Swing Tremolo," you might just want to make Tower hasn't got "New
Miserable Experience" on sale.
