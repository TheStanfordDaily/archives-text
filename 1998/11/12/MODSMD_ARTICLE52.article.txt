### Roxy Sass 
. 112) our roommate gave you the greatest of gifts
LA single for the weekend. She even had the|:d6d
]/ grace to tell you in advance. What she forgot to
mention was that she was returning a bit eariff. Tolarfl
completely by surprise, it slipped your mindio flean
up a few choice items which had wandered your
room, such as the handcuffs lying on the dn(jk, the
whip under the bed and the leather garmfnjts sti#
strewn about in the closet.
Now perhaps your roommate is a an understanding
person, or a very unobservant person. Maybe she too
has experienced the joys of a dominating partner or a
submissive mate. If none of the above apply, tpm Miss
Sass is going to help you out, with a few general point
ers that serve as great introductions (for you and your
roommate) into the wonderful wide world of kinky
sex.
Miss Sass would first like to point out that you do
not have to go to any sex shops in San Francisco, or
even to the costume shop in Palo Alto, to have a little
extra fun in bed. No, a multitude of potential toys and
props can be found in your very own dorm. Not only
will these impromptu ideas be cheaper and more
accessible, but they are less likely to arouse suspicion in
your roommate, your nosy neighbor or your RA.
(Although Miss Sass suggests Jetting your RAin on
your games — RAs have a wealth of ideas and experi
ence... i
Did you ever play hide-and-seek when you were a
little kid? Have you played hide-and-seek tn the last
two months? Miss Sass highly recommends it.
Blindfolds are often overlooked as a potentially
thrilling experience. And a blindfold is such a simple
toy. Almost any dark piece of cloth will do; Tie around
partner's head in such a fashion that the cloth
obstructs your partners vision, And voiia, instant
blindfold.
Now leave your blindfolded partner in the room for
a minute and run downstairs (clothes help here). Go to
the kitchen. Among other things, be sure to get a few
ice cubes (if you wantfto be sneaky, pretend you are

getting a glass of water $.. and
maybe an ice cream stuulae).
Ice cubes can be quite elotic if
used correctly. Since your part
ner cannot see you, deliberately
slow, teasing movements do
wonders here. Do not rush —
unless your roommate is
returning in five minutes.
The stereotypical item in
every bondage dream is the set
of handcuffs. Miss Sass believes
all humans should have a pair
under their bed# at all times.
However, If you happen upon
the rare occasion when you do

not have a pair at your disposal, ybu will be pleased to
note that many everyday item* tdo he substituted. Any
long piece of doth works, as domost bras, belts, and
ethernet cables. Remember, it is not a good idea to
leave your partner in a compromising position with
out supervision. It is an equally bad idea to "wait" for
your lover to arrive in your bedroom to find you all
tied up. A« fun as it sounds, tying yourself up leaves
vou, well, fairly vulnerable and in a possibly embar

■atile toys. Not only do they make great
fs; they also make wonderful whips,
ile the belt is, the better suited it is for
ss Sass recommends an extremely
playful us| of whips. Although pain can be arousing,
Miss SasmWfet to find much fun with the use of the
rnntrtgftd or the belt. Be careful not to leave marks.
% tou ars still lacking in entertainment, put that
Drama 20 llass to use. Dressing up and role-playing
csti liven up any bondage session. Haven't you always
wanted to have a little fun with the Stanford Sheriff?
Or maybe you really like a certain Marvel Comic
hero(insJ. Perhaps you dream about your RA, RCC, or
other persons of authority (always a good theme wher
ever bondage is involved).
Dressing up can also be a way to fulfill otherwise
ignored fetishes. Do collarless shirts turn you on? High
heels and garters? Dark goth and black trench coats?
Adam and Eve? This is a great opportunity to share a
fevv fantasies with your partner. It works best to tell
one of your fantasies, and then hear about your part
ner's fantasy Give each fantasy a chance —at least
seriously listen, even if you decide that particular sce
nario is not for you. Fantasies are some of our best
kept, deepest secrets, laughing at your partner s fanta
sy does nothing for his or her self-esteem, and lessens
the chance that he or she will be that open with you
again. Also, do not be offended that your partner fan
tasized about, for example, his or her RA. The mere
fact that she wants you to be her "RA' says that she is
unlikely to run off to that single down the hall anytime
soon.
Bondage and S & Mare not bad words. Tying your
lover up with permission does not make you a weirdo,
a future stalker or a criminal. Whips, handcuffs and
even d reeling up as a nun do not make the list of orig
inal sin. (You probably will end up in Hell for having
entirely too jhuch fun when you could have been
studying Dante or Milton). However, there are rules to
keep in Hpid when partaking in S & M. Do not rush
112 J* into something new. Take your

time to make sure it is what
your partner wants. Before
doing anything that puts one of
you into a submissive role,
agree upon a code word that
signifies that you want to stop.
A good friend of Miss Sass
remarked once, "There is a dif
ference between feeling over
powered and feeling trapped."
Being overpowered can be
extremely sexy and arousing.
An average lovemaking session
contain* a great deal of sub
miasiveness, aggressiveness.

and role-playing. yW partner does not feel trapped
because he or she t!Npi you, If there i$ no fru«t, over
powered turns into trapped, and sex turns into rape.
And there is absolutely nothing sexy or arousingabout
rape.
Bondage is not so much anbut fulfilling your own
fantasies as it is about coming up with new» fun ways
to make your partner more aroused than ct# before.
So be creative, be sexy and have fun.
