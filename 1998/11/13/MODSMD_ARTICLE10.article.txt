### Alex Tung Staff writer 
A group of 10 anthropologists and
researchers from different universi
ties spoke in a conference on "Cul
ture, Ecology and Conservation in
Amazonia" in Annenberg Auditori
um yesterday afternoon.
Prof. William Durham, event or
ganizer and Anthropological Sci
ences Department chair, began the
conference with a brief introduction
of the topic.
"What's important," he said, "is
that indigenous people can be key al
lies, if we work with them, to promote
biodiversity in the region."
Hosted by the newly formed De
partment of Anthropological Sci
ences, the conference consisted of
three separate panels covering the
themes of "Indigenous Peoples and
Conservation: The Problems
Today," "Conservation and Man
agement of Biodiversity by Indige
nous Peoples" and "Indigenous Peo
ples and the Future of Amazonia."
Each panel ended with a question
and-answer session, with Durham
giving final remarks at the end of the
conference.

The conference presented insights
on current cultural practices of in
digenous groups in the region of the
Amazon River and analyses of their
relationships with various habitats.
Speakers from Oxford University,
U( -Berkeley, Ohio University,
Pennsylvania State University and
others talked about their research ex
periences in different parts of South
America, touching on agricultural,
economic and ecological systems in
the Amazon region.
In the first panel, three professors
tackled the issue of problems cur
rently facing peoples in the Amazon.
Included in these problems are the
question of the rights of indigenous
peoples to claim ownership of land
and resources, according to Prof.
Darrell Posey of Oxford.
Prof. William Vickers of Florida
International spoke about the influx
of big oil industries into the tropical
rainforests of Ecuador and the cul
tural changes that their presence has
brought to the region.
During the second panel, re
searchers discussed alternatives to
current harmful agricultural prac
tices brought from outside to places
such as Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela.

"Agricultural development in
Amazonia has been environmentally
destructive and socially a failure,"
said Prof. Emeritus William
Denevan of the University of Wis
consin.
They also talked about strategies
being used by indigenous peoples
that are not destructive, and some
times helpful, to the environment.
The third panel focused on eco
nomic and social changes that have
brought cultural transformations and
market pressures to the peoples of
the Amazon basin. Panelists dis
cussed the future of the region and
how its people will deal with change.
Stanford Prof. Dominique Irvine
said the people in the region are
"finding new ways to organize them
selves" and are working on "increas
ing their political clout."
"I thought the most interesting
thing was that they had a wide variety
of speakers," said freshman Nina
Robertson. "It's good to get those
different opinions."
The conference was first in a series
of three to be organized by the de
partment this year in commemora
tion of the 50th anniversary of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
