# U.S. Deputy Secy. of Education speaks
## Marshall talks K-12 reform 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Marshall S. Smith, acting deputy
secretary for the U.S. Department
of Education, spoke on K-12 school
reform last night at the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford.
Smith, a former dean of the
School of Education, focused on
three main points: school achieve
ment and its recent outcomes, policy
changes and California's current ed
ucation system.
Experts have come to realize,
Smith said, that there is a strong rela
tionship between academic achieve
ment and future social mobility. This
presents a problem due to a gap be
tween the academic achievement, as
measured by standardized test
scores, of whites and blacks.
"Symbolically, as a nation, we be
lieve everyone should have an equal
chance to succeed," he said. "How
ever, there is one group that doesn't
do so well. If we don't find an expla
nation for this, then we have failed as
a society. We must keep trying."
The gap began closing from 1970
to 1989, Smith showed with charts.
During this time, blacks' test
scores increased, with nearly a 50

percent jump in reading in all of
three targeted age ranges and a 33
percent increase in math skills.
However, over the past few years,
the gains have started to level off.
"Recently, poverty has begun to
increase again, and desegregation is
over," Smith said. "Competency
testing is dying out and being re
placed with a quality emphasis. This
is jeopardizing the improvements
that have been made, and the gap
may open up."
Competency testing for basic
skills in reading and math must be
stressed even more now to further
achievement, Smith said.
"One of the things that happened
in the area of competency testing is
that in schooling there was a coher
ence in policy and practice," he said.
"Basic skills were pushed for gradu
ation."
Smith suggested that challenging
state standards be set for all stu
dents, that resources be aligned and
that local flexibility be maintained in
order to select the best instructional
strategies.
These practices were put into
place in Texas and North Carolina,
two states that showed tremendous
improvement between 1992 and

1996, with 6 percent and 9 percent
increases in basic skills, respectively.
California suffered a large shock
in 1992 and 1994, Smith said, when
statistics showed a decrease in
fourth graders' skills, an area in
which the state already lagged far
behind the nation.
"Texas particularly is extraordi
narily like California," he said. "The
demographics and growth rate are
similar, and there is actually greater
poverty in Texas. However, while
Texas is making gains, California is
falling behind."
In order to repair this situation.
Smith recommended establishing a
common policy framework, feeding
the system slowly with more money
for resources and grabbing the pub
lic's attention.
Improvements must be made
soon, Smith stressed, before more
children fall behind.
"Roughly 40 percent of kids in
the United States don't read at the
basic level," he said. "A substantial
number don't learn by fourth grade,
and if you don't learn by then, you
won't be taught. We can overcome
that. If we don't, as a nation we are
no better today than we were 150
years ago."
