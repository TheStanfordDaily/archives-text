# Pressure mounts on Iraq

WASHINGTON (AP)— Buoyed by
Arab criticism of Iraq, the Clinton admin
istration said Thursday that Saddam Hus
sein had isolated himself and must reverse
course. "We're not playing games," said
Defense Secretary William Cohen as U.S.
military preparations proceeded.
Eight Arab foreign ministers issued a
statement in Qatar saying that Iraq's con
tinuing refusal to submit to U.N. weapons
inspectors could have serious conse
quences for the Arab country.
Citing the statement as evidence of
"near unanimity" in the Arab world. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said, "The U.S. feels this is a pretty good
indicator of where the key Gulf countries

stand on the latest crisis."
Rubin dismissed a demand by Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., that President Clin
ton seek Congress' approval before order
ing any attack on Iraq.
The president has "inherent authority"
to use force and also was authorized by
Congress' past approval of I J.N. Security
(Council resolutions bearing on Iraq's con
cealment of weapons, Rubin said.
Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said
military strikes were likely. He encour
aged the administration to consider a fol
low-up campaign to remove Saddam from
power — a plan that probably would
require U.S. ground troops.
And if Saddam cannot be removed

without targeting and killing him? "I sus
pect, then, he will have to be killed,"
Lugar replied.
There was no direct reaction from the
administration. Rubin said only that "any
use of force would be to degrade his
capacity to develop weapons of mass
destruction and to threaten his neigh
bors."
In another development, Deputy Sec
retary of State Strobe Talbott hinted that
if Clinton decided to use force there could
be a series of attacks on Iraq.
"We have thought well beyond hour
one, day one and week one," he said dur
ing an appearance at the Brookings Insti
tution, a Washington research group.
