The arrest of a Stanford
scholar clouds the propriety
of a program in Beijing

LESS THAN TW() weeks alter it was
announced that Stanford was con
sidering opening a center in Beijing,
we learned that Una l)i. a missile expert
and senior research associate at Stanford's
Center for International Security and
Cooperation, had been under arrest in his
native China since January.
I he timing of these two events makes it
inevitable that Una's situation will affect
the possibility of a Stanford-in-Beijing pro
gram. When the idea of a center in Beijing
first came up. the Daily was enthusiastic
about the academic possibilities but had
reservations regarding academic freedom.
Our enthusiasm has not changed, and can
celing plans for the center would only be
justified by real concerns for the safety of
Stanford students and faculty and the
integrity of their work.
Hua suffers from cancer and needs
treatment in the United States. We hope
for his release and applaud the I Jniversity's
support of his defense. I lua's situation may
indicate that there is no way to build a cen
ter in Beijing with reasonable standards of
academic freedom. If so. Stanford cannot,
should not and, we are confident, will not
build a center there.
The Chinese government has charged
Hua with revealing state secrets. The cen
ter for which he works does not conduct
classified research and his colleagues
maintain that Hua's work was based on
sources that were either publicly available

or provided by the Chinese government.
In addition, according to his colleagues,
Hua, who was attending a family memori
al service, went to China with guarantees
from the government that he would not be
arrested.
While we don't know all the circum
stances. what we do know may indicate
that a Stanford researcher can be thrown in
jail in China for doing legitimate Stanford
related work. This imprisonment could be
completely arbitrary, in spite of any guar
antees the Chinese might provide. If that's
the case, then Beijing is not a safe or suit
able place to build a Stanford center.
However, preventing situations such as
Una's is the only correct criterion to use in
this case. If. for any reason, Hua's case is
exceptional and would clearly not apply to
other Stanford students and teachers work
ing in Beijing, then the University has no
call to halt its plans on account of recent
developments.
Inevitably, some people will attach
political significance to the University's
decision to build a center in Beijing, or
claim that the University should make a
political statement by refusing to do so. We
do not agree. Refusing to properly study a
country for political reasons leads to igno
rance. and even future political develop
ments become ill-informed.
Stanford's current administration has a
track record of seldom allowing political or
social considerations to influence its aca
demic decisions. We have not always
agreed with this policy, but in this case we
do. The University has steered a correct
course thus far with the Beijing program by
focusing on what it can contribute to our
research and teaching mission. We hope it
stays on that course.
