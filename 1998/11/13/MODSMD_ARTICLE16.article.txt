## Life as an accidental hedonist 
### 
I STRONGLY consid
ered writing my obli
gatory "Stop and
Smell the Roses" article
this week. Next to the
popular "Column About
Columns," it is the most
trite-yet-tempting subject

that comes to mind. I would have headed
my piece with a Ferris Bueller quote, of
course, and made pithy observations
about how college should be the best four
years of my life, your life and your dog's
life.
Matthew Broderick, though he holds a
special place in my heart, doesn't phrase
things nearly as well as Ani DiFranco
does. "When I look around," she sings, "I
think this, this is good enough / And I try
to laugh at whatever life brings." Ani
sounds a lot more like me: "Cuz when I
look down /1 just miss all the good stuff,"
she concludes, "And when I look up /1
just trip over things."
Those lyrics have been running through
my head quite a bit lately. I've criticized a
friend of mine for more than a month now
because she is counting the days until her
boyfriend returns from overseas. I
stopped when I realized that I've started
counting the days until I go home and
pack for my two quarters at Oxford. What
miserable hypocrisy.
This — what I am doing this quarter.

tonight, this second — should be good
enough. Nonetheless, I spend most of my
visits to my parents' house trying to resur
rect the social circles I ran with in high
school, and I spend an inordinate amount
of my time at Stanford waiting for whatev
er I'm doing to end. Neither the past nor
the future is now; what's my problem?
I don't mean to imply that my friends
and family aren't important; I care about
them very much. It is a bit ridiculous, how
ever, to continue to talk about senior
prom in order to avoid discussing my best
friend's college graduation and her
upcoming (gulp) wedding. Likewise, my
parents can't expect me to come to dinner
every night, nor can they expect to protect
me from the big bad world. I'm not a little
girl any more.
I don't mean to imply, moreover, that
the future doesn't concern me. ] am fully
aware that I should distinguish myself at
Stanford if I expect to be employed some
day, and I know that the "buffer zone" it
represents will only exist for another year.
Harsh as that reality may be. the doorti —
or whatever it is — isn't here yet.
I need to stop regarding myself as "in
between" anything — and so, I think, do
most of the people I know. It is frighten
ingly easy to forget to "laugh at whatever
life brings." Contentment, the idea that
"this is good enough," has earned a very
poor reputation in contemporary society.

Everyone is undervalued, misrepresented,
overworked and undersexed. The world,
of course, is infinitely flawed. Is this quar
ter, tonight, this second, worthwhile if it
doesn't get any better than this?
To be honest, 1 couldn't care less about
whether or not my time at Stanford will be
the best four years of my life. If 1 am
unhappy right now. I am doing something
wrong. I wholeheartedly reject the notion
that my existence is some sort of advent
calendar, and that every day is a kitschy
little door hiding a holiday surprise. How
can I be expected to quantify my past as
though it were a series of banalities lead
ing to some indistinct bliss? What great
event should I be anticipating? I am not
blind to what is coming or what has come
before; nevertheless, I can't afford to
undervalue today. Today is, and should
be, the best day of my life.
As I maintained that I wouldn't write
the much-maligned "Stop and Smell the
Roses" column, I suppose I have to eat my
words. Now that I think about it, 1 suppose
1 should eat the roses, too — they're a
hackneyed metaphor. Screw the hyper
cliched "Stanford Experience"; this, what
1 have, is good enough. This is all there is.

Lauren Oster, a junior majoring in English,
notes that Stanford students like this one,
photographed in IS9S, have eaten dead
metaphors for over a century.
