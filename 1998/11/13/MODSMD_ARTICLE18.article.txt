Injustice looms over state
If (iov. Wilson refuses to grant clemen
cy. a Thai national and former Buddhist
monk named Jaturun Siripongs will be exe
cuted one minute after midnight on Nov.
17. I find it bitterly ironic that California
will be executing its first Buddhist and its
first condemned inmate of Asian descent
only a few weeks after Stanford opened its
new center for Buddhist Studies and nearly
no-one on this campus knows this is hap
pening.
Four months ago, I stood in the death
chamber viewing room at San Quentin and
watched as the state murdered Tom
Thompson, one of my oldest and dearest
friends. Nearly every newspaper in the state
printed editorials against the execution,
because Tom was widely believed to be
innocent of the 1 1 ><X| murder for which he
faced execution. Jay Siripongs was a good
friend of Tom's and a man I came to know
through my visits with Tom at San Quentin.
Jay's case also leaves much doubt as to
whether he actually committed murder,
though he has always freely admitted to
being involved in the store robbery during
which the murders took place. There is
much forensic evidence which indicates the
possibility that another or others committed
the murder, including the lact that Jay had

several knife wounds on his hands at the
time of his arrest which have been identi
fied as defensive wounds by forensic
experts. In other words, he may not only be
innocent of murder, but may have actually
tried to act to prevent it. Further, two of the
original jurors now feel they would have
voted differently had Jay's lawyer present
ed evidence that others may have commit
ted the murder, and the spouses of both vic
tims, also Buddhists, have asked that Jay
not be executed but given life in prison.
Jay is a very gentle and spiritual man and
a talented artist. Over the years in San
Quentin. he provided help to many of the
prisoners in developing their artistic skills.
The former warden of San Quentin and a
San Quentin guard have testified in support
of clemency on the grounds that Jay has not
only had a flawless prison record but also
has been proactive in keeping the peace on
the row.
The government of Thailand has also
entered a plea with Gov. Wilson to spare
Jay Siripongs' life. It has offered to extra
dite Jay and incur the costs and responsibil
ities of imprisoning him for life without pos
sibility of parole. Jay has been denied access
to other legal aid offered by the Thai con
sul, and this is a blatant violation of the
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
of l% 1 ). In many other counties in the state,
he would not have even been tried for cap

ital murder, but in Orange County during
the 1960s and 1970s there was rarely justice
for ethnic minorities.
Jay's case has international implications,
particularly for students who plan to travel
abroad. The right to access your consul or
embassy is crucial should you ever
encounter legal problems in another coun
try. It is critical that the United States
respect this right if foreign countries are to
be expected to reciprocate.
It is not too late for concerned citizens to
let the governor know that they support
clemency for Jay Siripongs. For more infor
mation, you can visit the Death Penalty
Focus or Amnesty International Web sites.
The execution I witnessed in July is seared
into my brain and my heart. I do not intend
to stand by and watch while another traves
ty of justice is committed by the state. You
can still register your opinion with governor
by faxing him at (916) 445-4633, but act
now; time is running out.

Column fit only for sages
How is it that Eugene Park's Nov. 11 col
umn didn't get the "Deep Thoughts" head
ing? Or did the boy mistakenly turn in one
of his philosophy papers? If there's a wor

thy use of "neo-essentialism" in an opinion
column, I doubt this is the one. And what
the hell are "exotic entities of causal
import" anyway? I must, however, say 1
found comfort in learning that "an individ
ual has a fixed, authentic essence." That's
nice.
I knew I was coming out to an intellectu
al community, hut damn! Even the newspa
per columns are downright sagacious. Not
wanting to miss a learning opportunity, I
whipped out my thesaurus and a few
Kierkegaard texts and tried reading the col
umn again. And again a third time.
Conclusion? I'm not sure if he even had
a point, especially since he left out some of
the crucial elements of the demystification
of hieroglyphic stability.

Library cries for upgrade
Let me first say that I am a very happy
student, who loves to study in Green
Library because it has such a nice relaxing
environment.
Now, having said that, I would like to
express my sincere displeasure with Green
Library. I am at a loss to understand why
I must have my bags checked every single
time I leave that library, whether I check

books out or not. What is the problem?
There are millions of books in that
library, and I am just unclear as to why
there is no security system being imple
mented, other than hiring workers to
search through the bag of every student
who exits the library. One would think
that the cost of implementing such a sys
tem will only increase as time moves on.
So, why is Michael Keller, the director of
University libraries, not spending the
money?
We pay $3(),(KH) a year to go to this uni
versity, and we can't even get a decent
security system to detect if an unautho
rized book is being taken from the library.
This is Silicon Valley, and technology is
abundant. To be honest, me and a couple
of my buddies could probably design a
system in 20 minutes that would be better
than the one being used. I guess Mr.
Keller is either too lazy, doesn't care that
he is offending the patrons of the library,
or just too cheap to spend the money to
bring Green even up to the 1980s stan
dards of Terman Library. This is really
sad. The next time someone in Green
Library reaches for my bag, I just may
have to call the police because that consti
tutes a search without probable cause.
