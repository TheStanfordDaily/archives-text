## Binge drinking can't be curbed by politics 
### 
Matthew H. Blumenstein

CONGRESS IS TALKING about us.
The horrible storm of alcohol-relat
ed tragedies on campuses across the
country has given rise to countless con
cerned voices demanding we curb the flow
of liquor pouring down college students'
throats. It is the sense of the Senate and the
sense of almost everyone else that Ameri
can college kids drink entirely too much.
Binge drinking is hailed as college campus'
No. 1 sickness and everyone is scrambling
for a remedy.
The government thinks it has one. The
"Collegiate Initiative to Reduce Binge
Drinking" is its new effort to help colleges
shake the stigma of alcohol abuse. It lays
out six measures designed "to change the
culture of alcohol consumption on college
campuses."
Trying to change college culture through
legislation is a dubious undertaking. While
the government's decrees are rational and
informed, it is doubtful that they will have
any significant impact. Congress' initiative
outlines ways to fight binge drinking in its
manifestations, but it fails to address its
societal, or cultural causes.

The six measures reveal three themes:
University initiative, stringent discipline
and reduced supply.
Congress has recommended that colleges
form task forces to "make recommenda
tions for a broad range of policy and pro
gram changes that would serve to reduce
alcohol and other drug-related problems."
It insists that colleges "should provide max
imum opportunities for students to live in
an alcohol-free environment and to engage
in stimulating, alcohol-free recreation and
leisure activities."
Translation: Figure it out yourselves.
With these recommendations the govern
ment has admitted that the best legislators
are the colleges themselves. A national res
olution should provide good impetus for
universities to face facts and make changes.
Because there is great variance in lifestyles
across universities, it is logical for Congress
to distribute responsibility to individual
schools.
Stanford officials have responded non
chalantly. They apparently believe, as I do,
that binge drinking is not a pervasive prob
lem at Stanford and no drastic policy

changes are necessary. There are numerous
organizations on campus, analogous to
these "task forces," which are continually
assessing campus drinking habits and stu
dent health. It is impressive that this nation
al alarm has not caused an unnecessary
frenzy of concern on the Farm.
The initiative does more than delegate
responsibility to individual colleges.
Congress is calling for " 'zero tolerance' on
the illegal consumption of alcohol by its stu
dents." In Congress' opinion, colleges
"should vigorously enforce ... disciplinary
sanctions for those who violate campus
alcohol policies."
These measures will do nothing to change
the college drinking culture. Our high
national drinking age fosters abuse. This
coercive attempt to keep students from
drinking will increase dissent and an us
against-them mentality. It will increase
arrests and expulsions. It will not, however,
make college students want to drink less.
These sanctions have little bearing on
Stanford, mainly because we have few alco
hol policies to "vigorously enforce." We
have a wet campus. Freshman dorms throw

keg parties. Despite this, binge drinking on
our campus is rare and concentrated. As
long as that is the case, Stanford has no rea
son to change these policies and can essen
tially ignore Congress once again.
Finally, Congress's initiative attempts to
stem the supply of alcohol on campuses.
Congress wants schools to "adopt a policy
eliminating alcoholic beverage-related
sponsorship of on campus activities," and
"curtail illegal student access to alcohol."
They seek to dry out colleges by eliminating
alcoholic parties and running shady alcohol
providers out of town.
While well-intentioned, these decrees will
still do little to curtail drinking culture and
may in fact make it more dangerous. Dry
campuses are notoriously susceptible to
drunk driving. There is little reason to think
that college students will stop drinking if
they are not permitted to do so on campus.
A more likely result is that they will drink
elsewhere.
An attempt to remove illegal alcohol dis
tributors may have an effect. Clinton's war
on tobacco has made it much harder for
young people to obtain cigarettes. If a kid

wants cigarettes, however, he can still get
them. Likewise, while it may become hard
er for underage college students to buy
alcohol, they will still get it. If binge drink
ing is such an ingrained behavior in college
culture, the need for better IDs will not
change anything.
My recurring objection to this resolution
is that it seeks to "change the culture of
alcohol consumption on college campuses,"
and yet it addresses culture not at all. All of
these sanctions may make it more difficult
to obtain alcohol, hut they will not effect
students' desire to do so.
It may be the case that, in the long run,
these sanctions will change college atmo
spheres to the degree that drinking is not a
priority. I doubt it, though. The causes of
binge drinking are more complicated than
this initiative assumes. Binge drinking is a
societal behavior learned early, and from
what I've seen of the upcoming youth, col
leges can expect to see plenty more of it.
