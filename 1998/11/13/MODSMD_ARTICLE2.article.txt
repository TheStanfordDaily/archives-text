### Bruce Wang Staff writer 
More than 450 students, faculty,
administrators, staff and local resi
dents gathered in Annenberg Audi
torium last night to weigh in on the
new graduate student housing plan.
The meeting was called by Joe
Simitian, a Santa Clara County su
pervisor, to improve communication
between Stanford and the surround
ing communities as the University
prepares its three-part response to
the recent housing crunch.
Larry Horton, director of govern
ment and community relations,
began the meeting with a presenta
tion on the new housing plans. The
first part of the plan, and the only one
that is currently being proposed, is to
build 480 single student units in Es
condido Village.
According to Horton, the project
will be completed in two phases. Half
of the 480 units will be completed by
fall of 20(X) with the rest of the units
ready by fall of 2001.
The other two parts of the plan in

clude building up to 250 family units
on West Campus and building up to
200 units near the intersection of
Quarry and Arboretum roads for
hospital residents.
After the presentations, Simitian
opened up the floor for comments.
Several graduate students com
mented on the adverse living condi
tions they faced off campus. "It's ei
ther a choice between unaffordable
housing at reasonable living condi
tions or affordable housing at unrea
sonable living conditions," said one
economics doctoral student.
Some people emphasized the im
portance of graduate students to the
University. "Production and trans
mission of knowledge is the primary
goal of this University, and graduate
students play an essential role in
this," said Tom Wasow, associate
dean for graduate policy.
Local residents and organizations
also voiced support for more gradu
ate housing. A member of the
League of Women Voters of Palo
Alto said. "This action will help ease
local housing demands and reduce

student traffic through local commu
nities."
Other attendees raised concerns.
Several faculty members voiced
concerns over the plan to possibly
build on 20 sites within current facul
ty neighborhoods. "Open spaces
both in the foothills and in the green
belts on campus are key parts to at
tracting new faculty," said one Grad
uate School of Business professor.
Many residents from neighboring
communities raised concern over the
lack of a long-range plan on the part
of Stanford. A member of the Com
mittee for Green Foothills urged the
school to "come up with more innov
ative plans instead of waiting until the
last minute."
In response to this comment. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya pointed to the construction
of Lyman Graduate Residence and
Schwab Residential Center.
Members of the Palo Alto school
board raised concerns over the pro
jected 500 new K-12 students that will
enter the school district as a result of
the overall housing plan.
