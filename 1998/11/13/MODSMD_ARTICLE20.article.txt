WOMEN S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: Season Opener: No. 19
Stanford vs. No. IK Arkansas at the
Four in the Fall Tournament, 8:30
p.m., San Jose Arena

Five seniors graduated last
year, including leading scorers
Kristin Folkl. Vanessa Nygaard
and Olympia Scott, and all were
drafted into the ABL or the
WNBA, the two women's profes
sional basketball leagues.
Now, the No. 19 Cardinal finds
itself with a young and inexperi
enced team. And for the first time
in 10 years, Stanford's team is not
slated to win a Pacific 10 Confer
ence title — No. 6 UCLA is.
A women's basketball power
house year in and year out, Stan
ford now gets a little taste of what
it is like to be the underdog.
The team made a shocking first
round exit in the N('AA tourna

ment, losing to Harvard 71-67.
Folkl and Nygaard both suffered
knee injuries in the week leading
up to the game, putting Stanford's
top players on the bench and leav
ing the Cardinal high and dry as
the Crimson took the floor.
"When the heart of your team is
taken out. it's really hard to keep
going and do what you would like
to do," VanDerveer said.
Stanford is hoping for a differ
ent ending this year, however, and
it comes from a much different
starting point. Nonetheless, all
around campus basketball is in the
air and the Cardinal looks to capi
talize on its youth and show its crit
ics up.
"We're excited to be playing,"
VanDerveer said. " The team is
very young, very hungry and most
ly healthy."
Youth will be both Stanford's
secret weapon and its weakness.
With only two starters returning,
the underclassmen will be forced
into a producing role right away.
Looking to head the offense is
junior point guard Milena Flores.
Flores started in all but one game
last year and led both the team and
the conference in assists. Flores
will most likely be paired with ju
