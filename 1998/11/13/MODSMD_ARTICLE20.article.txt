WOMEN S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: Season Opener: No. 19
Stanford vs. No. IK Arkansas at the
Four in the Fall Tournament, 8:30
p.m., San Jose Arena

Five seniors graduated last
year, including leading scorers
Kristin Folkl. Vanessa Nygaard
and Olympia Scott, and all were
drafted into the ABL or the
WNBA, the two women's profes
sional basketball leagues.
Now, the No. 19 Cardinal finds
itself with a young and inexperi
enced team. And for the first time
in 10 years, Stanford's team is not
slated to win a Pacific 10 Confer
ence title — No. 6 UCLA is.
A women's basketball power
house year in and year out, Stan
ford now gets a little taste of what
it is like to be the underdog.
The team made a shocking first
round exit in the N('AA tourna

ment, losing to Harvard 71-67.
Folkl and Nygaard both suffered
knee injuries in the week leading
up to the game, putting Stanford's
top players on the bench and leav
ing the Cardinal high and dry as
the Crimson took the floor.
"When the heart of your team is
taken out. it's really hard to keep
going and do what you would like
to do," VanDerveer said.
Stanford is hoping for a differ
ent ending this year, however, and
it comes from a much different
starting point. Nonetheless, all
around campus basketball is in the
air and the Cardinal looks to capi
talize on its youth and show its crit
ics up.
"We're excited to be playing,"
VanDerveer said. " The team is
very young, very hungry and most
ly healthy."
Youth will be both Stanford's
secret weapon and its weakness.
With only two starters returning,
the underclassmen will be forced
into a producing role right away.
Looking to head the offense is
junior point guard Milena Flores.
Flores started in all but one game
last year and led both the team and
the conference in assists. Flores
will most likely be paired with ju

nior Christina Batastini or junior
Yvonne Gbalazeh, both of whom
played frequently last year.
On the wing. Stanford has both
experience and a strong option with
senior Regan Freuen. Freuen saw
action in all but one of Stanford's 27

games last year and VanDerveer la
bels her the emotional leader on the
floor. Also on the wing will be
sophomore Naila Moselv, freshman
Lauren St. Clair or freshman Lind
say Yamasaki.
Yamaski is arguably this season's
most exciting addition to the team.
Highly recruited in both volleyball
and basketball, Yamaski has the
confidence and poise of a well sea
soned college player.
Besides having a pretty little
jump shot, she moves the ball well
and brings energy to Stanford'
game. While Yamaski tore the later
al meniscus in her right knee on Oct.
22. she has made a speedy recovery
and was well enough to start in
Monday's exhibition match, where
she added seven points and six re
bounds to the Cardinal's campaign.
After losing Folk!, Scott and
Heather Owen, though. Stanford's
young fronteourt will have to learn
quickly.
"This team is on a steep learning
curve," VanDerveer said. "We
haven't played together [and] we're
not experienced but I think we will
see some nice things from different
people."
Through hard summer training,
the post players look much im
proved. especially sophomore for
ward Carolyn Moos. Standing at 6-
foot-3. Moos is stronger and fitter

than last year and is able to run the
court well. In Stanford's two exhibi
tion games. Moos led the Cardinal
in both shooting and rebounding.
Also expecting a large amount of
minutes are sophomores Keresa
Granderson and Sarah Dinison.
both of whom played last year. In
addition. Stanford will also look to
newcomers Bethany Donaphin and
Enjoli Izidor for help on the inside.
"We have a great time together.
We have chemistry," Flores said.
"The youth brings energy and it's
great to come to practice with
them."
The vastly remodeled Stanford
team has its work cut out for it and
the road to the Final Four will be dif
ficult every step of the way, even
with the added incentive that Stan
ford hosts the Final Four this season
in San Jose Arena.
"The worst thing to do is think
about the end." VanDerveer said.
"Everything is so very fragile. It's
here and gone so quickly. What I
want as a coach and what I want my
players to do is to enjoy each day.
We take the fun out of it when all we
do is look at the end instead of en
joying the process."
Despite all the doubt, Stanford is
still hungry for that short trip to San
Jose come March.
"Just because we're young
doesn't mean you change your stan

dards and expectations," Freuen
said.
Stanford, however, will get one
chance to play in that San Jose
Arena before the Final Four.
Tonight.
The Cardinal will kick off its sea
son at the Nike Four in the Fall tour
nament in San Jose where four top
-20 teams will be showcased — No. 3
Connecticut, No. 4 Duke and No. IS
Arkansas join the Cardinal at this
tournament. After that obstacle
Stanford will face No. 25 Illinois,
No. 6 Purdue and top-ranked Ten
nessee before the Pac-10 opener on
Jan. 2 against Oregon State.
"It's good to play a tough sched
ule." VanDerveer said. "I hope to
not break people's confidence and I
expect us to do well. It will help us
out more in the long run."
In its first true game of the season
and the second match of the Nike
Four in the Fall tournament, Stan
ford faces Arkansas tonight.
Arkansas surprised all with its
Cinderella-esque run at the national
championship last season. After a
slow start to its year, Arkansas beat
Hawaii and Harvard to advance to
the West Regional, where it beat
Kansas 79-63. In the Elite Eight, the
Lady Razorbacks managed to upset
Duke 77-72 and become the first un
ranked team in the Final Four. They
bowed out to eventual champion

Tennessee, 86-58.
Because Arkansas was in the
West Region with Stanford and was
on the West Coast for two weeks
last year, Stanford is very familiar
with the Lady Razorbacks' style of
Play-
Arkansas returns three starters
from last year's squad. Head coach
Gary Blair, however, will start
freshman Amy Wright at guard
along with senior Carrie Satterfield.
"We know we're going to have a
lot of pressure put on us because
when you have a young guard that's
what you should do," Blair said. "At
the same time, our game is all about
pressure."
Scrappy defense and a lot of hus
tle may be Arizona's game but Blair
has to look to his guards to lead the
offense as Arkansas' true weakness
lies inside the paint.
With Arkansas' tallest players
standing at only 6-1, Stanford has an
overwhelming height advantage
with Moos at 6-6, Granderson and
Donahpin at 6-2 and Yamaski at 6-
i.
"We have a lot of kids that can
score. Our problem is going to be
defending and being able to guard
the post play," Blair said.
On Saturday, Stanford will either
play Connecticut or Duke in either
the consolation game at 1:30 p.m. or
the championship game at 4 p.m.
