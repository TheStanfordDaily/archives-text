# No.7 Stanford off to face Cal Bears
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Calling Sunday's battle against
California the "Big Game" might be
an understatement.
This Sunday, the No. 7 Stanford
men's soccer team (14-4-1, 5-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) travels across the Bay to take
on the Bears (7-10-1.4-4) in a I p.m.
showdown.
The Cardinal is trying to secure
itself a playoff berth and a win would
all but assure this.
In addition, Stanford is shooting
for a home game in the first round of
the tournament, and needs a win at
to make this a realistic possibility.
"We can't take for granted that
we are in the tournament," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark.
"Wo have had a solid season, but do
not want to leave the decision to any
politics. A win Sunday would make
a strong case to get a home bid."
The players are also fully aware
of the importance of the match.
"This game is huge. Each game
just keeps getting bigger. We need
to keep winning," said redshirt
sophomore Chris Gores. "It is not
pressure, we just know how impor
tant it is to come out ready each

time.
Heading into the most important
time in the season, the parts are
coming together for Stanford.
"We have been playing well and
have grown with the season," Bobby
Clark said. "We have a quiet confi
dence and determination."

MEN'S SOCCER
â–  Sunday: No. 7 Stanford (14-4-1
overall, 5-2 Mountain Pacifc Sports
Federation) at California (7-10-1. 4-
4), 1 p.m.

Key to the improvement the
team has made is a combination of
individual hard work and team
chemistry.
"The seniors are working harder
than ever because it is getting to the
end for them," Gores said. "They
are putting it all on the line."
And while the seniors have
stepped up their play, the under
classmen have held their own as
well.
Freshman Lee Morrison con
tributed two goals for the Cardinal
last weekend, including the game
winning goal against UC-Irvine.
Morrison garnered MI'SF player of
the week honors for his efforts.

Sophomore M;itt Moses scored the
first goal of his career in the UC-
Irvine game.
Moses, who has lound playing
time recently due to the injuries of
his teammates, stepped into his own
during the game against Irvine.
"Without the injuries, we possi
bly wouldn't have discovered Matt."
Bobby Clark said.
But Moses is quick to divert the
attention to his teammates.
"Although I was on the end of a
lot of plays, it takes a lot of building
to get there," Moses said. "It looks
like I finished the plays, but it takes
a lot of good passes to set it up. The
credit goes to all the people behind
me."
The Bears will have their hands
full on Sunday, as Stanford has
taken advantage of only playing one
game this weekend and resting up.
Although the Bears' have strug
gled to record wins this season, four
of their matches have been forced
into overtime. Four other losses
were defeats by a single goal.
Junior John Mac Donald sits atop
the scoring charts for the Bears with
five goals and five assists.
Sophomore Kendall Simmons is
second with four goals and four as
sists for California.
