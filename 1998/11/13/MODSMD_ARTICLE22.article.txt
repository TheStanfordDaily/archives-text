The rest of the Pacific 10 Conference had better
pray for a miracle now.
For with two wins at Maples Pavilion against the
Oregon schools this weekend, the tourth-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball team (21-2 overall, 14-0
Pac-10) will clinch at least a tie for a fifth consecutive
Pac-10 title.

■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Oregon State (12-14, 2-13), 7
p.m.. Maples Pavilion. RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM)

Considering the Cardinal's 39-match conference
winning streak, the rest of the conference is in des
perate need of divine intervention of some sort.
Of course, Stanford head coach Don Shaw and his
players realize that the Pac-1() title is far from being
wrapped up and they will he focused and ready to
play Oregon (7-19, 2-13) tonight at 7 p.m..
After Stanford's victory at California last Friday,
the Cardinal had some time away from competitive
volleyball to get refreshed before the stretch run.
"It will be very nice to have a little time off," said
freshman outside hitter Michelle Chambers after the
Cal win. "These last couple of weeks have been pret
ty intense, and it will be good to get the chance to get
caught up in everything. The time off will be very
healthy."
The thought of a healthier Cardinal squad, which

has won 20 in a row, has to frighten
the Oregon schools.
The Ducks are tied with cross
state rival Oregon State for last
place in the Pac-10, and have only
beaten two ranked opponents in
the last four years. Stanford has
won the last 18 matches with Ore
gon, going all the way back to 1989.
Earlier this season in Eugene,
Stanford pulled off a three-game
sweep of the Ducks, 15-11, 15-1,
16-14, and leads the overall series,
27-2.
Oregon State, on the other
hand, has never beaten the Cardi
nal in 27 matches. The Beavers (12-
14, 2-13) will face the Cardinal in
Maples, where Stanford has won
24 straight matches, on Sunday at 1
p.m.
Stanford cruised to a 15-4, 15-
10, 15-8 sweep of the Beavers a
month ago in Corvallis.
The past week has given junior
outside hitter Kerri Walsh time to
rest her tender right shoulder. The
Stanford star had no kills in only
five attempts against Cal.

The Cardinal's balanced attack,
however, has been able to pick up
the offensive slack in the absence
of a fully healthy Walsh. Five Stan
ford players have tallied at least
200 kills, led by sophomore middle
blocker Jennifer Detmer, who has
281 for the season.
Stanford averages 3.95 blocks
per game to lead the nation, as
Detmer leads the Pac-10 with 1.67
blocks per game.
The Cardinal moved up a spot
to No. 4 in the AVCA Coaches
poll, because then-fourth-ranked
BYU dropped a five-game heart
breaker at Hawaii last week.
With each win, Stanford im
proves its standing on the national
scene and the move into the top
four increases the chances that the
Cardinal will host a regional in the
season-ending NCAA tourna
ment.
"We have a shot to host a re
gional," Shaw said before the Cal
match. "We will definitely host a
sub-regional, and have put in a bid
to host the next two rounds. But
what happens with that is out of
our hands. All we want to do is win
the rest of our matches, and every
thing else will take care of itself."
