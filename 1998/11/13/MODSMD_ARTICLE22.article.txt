The rest of the Pacific 10 Conference had better
pray for a miracle now.
For with two wins at Maples Pavilion against the
Oregon schools this weekend, the tourth-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball team (21-2 overall, 14-0
Pac-10) will clinch at least a tie for a fifth consecutive
Pac-10 title.

Considering the Cardinal's 39-match conference
winning streak, the rest of the conference is in des
perate need of divine intervention of some sort.
Of course, Stanford head coach Don Shaw and his
players realize that the Pac-1() title is far from being
wrapped up and they will he focused and ready to
play Oregon (7-19, 2-13) tonight at 7 p.m..
After Stanford's victory at California last Friday,
the Cardinal had some time away from competitive
volleyball to get refreshed before the stretch run.
"It will be very nice to have a little time off," said
freshman outside hitter Michelle Chambers after the
Cal win. "These last couple of weeks have been pret
ty intense, and it will be good to get the chance to get
caught up in everything. The time off will be very
healthy."
