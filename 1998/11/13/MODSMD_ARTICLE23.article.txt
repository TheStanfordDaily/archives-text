In an attempt to put a positive
ending tin the sucking chest wound
that has been the IWB season, the
Stanford football team (1-8 over
all, 0-6 Pac-10) will take on fellow
conference cellar-dweller Wash
ington State (3-6, 0-6). The Cardi
nal finds itself mired in a six-game
losing streak and will try to pick up
its first conference victory against

the similarly winlcss Cougars.
Last week, the Cardinal came
out flat against a much superior
USC team and was diddled to the
tune of a 35-9 rout.
The Cougars, however, are
equally atrocious.
Washington State's three non
conference wins were against Illi
nois. Boise State and Idaho — not
exactly big-time names in Division
I football. It gave up 51 points to
Oregon and was trounced at Ari
zona and again at home against
use.
In three Pac-10 road games.
WSU has been outscored 114-38.
Furthermore, its scoring defense is
lOKth in the nation, which might be
even more encouraging for Stan
ford fans if their own Cardinal
weren't l()9th.
The downtrodden Cougars are

caught up in their own six-game
losing streak and are vulnerable to
the big play. Moreover, the WSU
defense has been weak against the
run and so might allow Stanford's
fledgling running attack, built
around freshman Brian Allen, to
continue its improvement.
"I think Allen improved
[against USC]," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "He's
getting smarter and he keeps im
proving."
Allen will need to continue his
improvement for Stanford to pick
up a win tomorrow, as the Cardi
nal's running game had been
nonexistent until its matchup with
the Trojans.
Cardinal quarterback Todd
Husak. meanwhile, has piloted the
passing attack to eighth in the na
tion at 323 yards per game.
That passing attack may come
in handy if the WSU game turns
into a shootout.
The Cougars have the nation's
top kickoff returner in senior Dee
Moronkola, a defensive back who
also has eight breakups and two in
terceptions on the season.
Moronkola has scored twice on
runbacks while averaging more
than 34 yards per carry for the
Cougars.

That doesn't bode well for Stan
ford's woeful special teams, which
essentially lost the OSU game and
continued to look shabby against
Arizona State, UCLA and USC.
For Stanford seniors Jeff Allen.
Brian Donoghue, Andrew Kroek
er, Kevin Miller. Donnie Spragan
and Geoff Wilson, tomorrow's
game will be their last chance to
win before the home crowd and
maybe salvage a the disastrous sea
son in some small way.
As terrible as 2-8 is, beating
WSU would give the Cardinal
some confidence in its ability to
outscore opponents going into the
101st Big Game.
