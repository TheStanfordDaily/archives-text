In an attempt to put a positive
ending tin the sucking chest wound
that has been the IWB season, the
Stanford football team (1-8 over
all, 0-6 Pac-10) will take on fellow
conference cellar-dweller Wash
ington State (3-6, 0-6). The Cardi
nal finds itself mired in a six-game
losing streak and will try to pick up
its first conference victory against

the similarly winlcss Cougars.
Last week, the Cardinal came
out flat against a much superior
USC team and was diddled to the
tune of a 35-9 rout.
The Cougars, however, are
equally atrocious.
Washington State's three non
conference wins were against Illi
nois. Boise State and Idaho — not
exactly big-time names in Division
I football. It gave up 51 points to
Oregon and was trounced at Ari
zona and again at home against
use.
In three Pac-10 road games.
WSU has been outscored 114-38.
Furthermore, its scoring defense is
lOKth in the nation, which might be
even more encouraging for Stan
ford fans if their own Cardinal
weren't l()9th.
The downtrodden Cougars are

caught up in their own six-game
losing streak and are vulnerable to
the big play. Moreover, the WSU
defense has been weak against the
run and so might allow Stanford's
fledgling running attack, built
around freshman Brian Allen, to
continue its improvement.
"I think Allen improved
[against USC]," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "He's
getting smarter and he keeps im
proving."
Allen will need to continue his
improvement for Stanford to pick
up a win tomorrow, as the Cardi
nal's running game had been
nonexistent until its matchup with
the Trojans.
Cardinal quarterback Todd
Husak. meanwhile, has piloted the
