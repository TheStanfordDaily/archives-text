# CROSS COUNTRY REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
## Stanford looks to regain No.1 spot 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Stanford's harriers will take the opportunity
for one final tune-up tomorrow at the NCAA
Western Regional Championship meet at
Woodward Park in Fresno, Calif.
Coming only 10 days before the NCAA
championships in Lawrence. Kan., the meet will
provide the Cardinal with the opportunity to so
lidify its final lineup and perhaps regain the No. 1
position it recently relinquished in the polls.
The No. 2 Cardinal was displaced from the top

spot last week for the first time all season by
perennial rival Arkansas, which obliterated its
competition in the weaker Southeastern Confer
ence.
Tomorrow's Regional field will be comprised
of the teams from both the Pacific 10 Conference
and the Big West Conference.
In preparation for the 10-kilometer NCAA
championship race, the Regional meet will also
be contested at 10 kilometers, a departure from
the eight kilometers raced throughout the sea
son.
Stanford enters the meet slightly favored over
No. 3 Oregon, which gave the Cardinal its first
big scare two weeks ago at the Pac-10 meet.
There, the Cardinal ran strong up front but
faded in the fifth through seventh positions and
barely squeaked by Oregon with a score of 48
points to the Ducks' 50.
Stanford also defeated the Ducks at last year's
Regionals, scoring 50 points compared to Ore
gon's 83.
"The competition at the Regionals will be
fierce and it should be a close race," said Stanford
head coach Vin Lananna. "W£ have been train
ing all season to race well in championship meets
and I am confident that our athletes are well pre
pared for the 10-kilometer course."
The top two teams at each of the nine Re
gional Championship meets will earn automatic
bids to the NCAA meet, and the top four indi
viduals not from either team will also be invited
to compete at nationals.
Also, 13 other teams from around the nation
will receive at-large invitations to the NCAA
meet.
Though starting lineups will not be known
until race time, it is likely than Lananna will shuf
fle the Cardinal's shifty five-through-seven spots.
Seniors Brad and Brent Hauser and Jason
Balkman are likely to head up the attack for

Stanford along with sophomore standout
Jonathan Riley.
Redshirt freshman Gabe Jennings, who was
hampered at the Pac-10 meet by shin problems,
is unlikely to race.
Other probable racers are senior Chris Lund
stron, sophomore Thomas Murley and redshirt
freshman Jamey Gifford, while senior Jon Wel
don and junior Jake Maas are question marks at
this time.

"We'll put a great team on the starting line [to
morrow] morning that is prepared to compete
well," Lananna said. "We are very fortunate to
have many athletes that have positioned them
selves to be real players at the NCAA Champi
onships."
The lead pack should nearly replicate that of
the Pac-10 meet, where No. 7 Arizona's Adbi
Abdirahman and Washington State's Bernard
Lagat were chased by Brad Hauser and Oregon's
Matthew Davis.
The team race will also be nearly identical, as
no squad in the Big West is ranked nationally.
Arizona will look to clean up behind Stanford
and Oregon, while Utah State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo present the biggest threat from the
Big West.
Nevertheless, Stanford is not looking past the
Regional meet quite yet.
"We will approach the Regional Champi
onships as we approach every race and that is by
trying to put ourselves in a position where each
member of the team races well and we have a
shot at winning," Lananna said.
