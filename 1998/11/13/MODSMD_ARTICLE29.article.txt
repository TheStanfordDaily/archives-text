Nothing.
That is what the Stanford women's cross country
team has accomplished this year that will help it qualify
for the NCAAs at tomorrow's NCAA West Regional
Championships held in Fresno, Calif.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford competes in the NCAA
West Regional Championship, Fresno, Calif.

When the 32-school field gets on the line for the 10
a.m. race, each team will essentially have a clean slate.
It doesn't matter that Stanford won the prenational
meet this season or that it handily won the Pacific 10
Conference Championship's two weeks ago in Eugene,
Ore.. The women will not be thinking about the past.
They will only be thinking of qualifying for the NCA As
in Lawrence, Kan. on Nov. 23.
There are several ways of qualifying. The first two
teams across the line automatically qualify, but because
the Western region is so competitive it is possible that
four teams will head to Lawrence. This is the result of
at-large bids which will be granted from a total of 13
spots.
So while second-ranked Stanford is the heavy fa
vorite to win this meet. No. 9 Washington, No. .11 Ari
zona and No. 14 Arizona State all have good chances of

advancing. Additionally, at least four individuals whose
teams do not qualify will advance with a shot of earning
the individual title at the NCAAs.
Stanford head coach Vin Lananna is confident that
his team will advance without a scare.
"The athletes are very well prepared," Lananna
said. "They have done all of the rigors that need to he
done and taken the steps that need to be taken in-order
to prepare for the NCAAs. It's just a matter of now
going out and doing it."
Despite the success of the Cardinal at Pac-lOs, the
lineup this weekend is likely to differ from that of two
weeks ago.
"We will make a couple of changes on the women's
side," said Lananna. "1 don't think that any of those
changes will necessarily weaken our team at all. 1 actu
ally think that we have the potential to have even a
stronger team than we had at the Pac-lOs because I
think we can run better."
Like at the Pac l()s, Stanford's top runners Julia
Stamps and Sally Glynn, the second and third-place
finishers at Eugene respectively, will likely be pushed
by the 1996 NCAA champion and this year's Pac-10
champion. Amy Skieresz of Arizona.
Expect Tara Chaplin, Skieresz's teammate, to also
contend for the No. 1 spot despite a 12th-place finish in
Eugene where she suffered from hypothermia.
While Lananna certainly is not overlooking this
meet with thoughts of the NCAAs, he is not overly con
cerned with the competition this weekend.
"You just got to do what you got do to to qualify. It
doesn't make a difference what the other teams do."
