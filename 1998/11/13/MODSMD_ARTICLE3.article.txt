## Fac Sen wants new copyright standard 
### Elise Lipkowitz Senior staff writer 
In its meeting yesterday after
noon, the Faeulty Senate took steps
toward ereating a new academic
guideline to address the increasingly
blurred lines of copyright guidelines
in the technological era.
Following an hour-long debate,
the senate adopted a resolution sup
porting a change to the University's
copyright policy. According to the
resolution, creators of a copy
rightable work who in the process
make "significant use" of University
resources must give copyright own
ership to the University and share the
royalties with it.
The issue was brought to the sen
ate bv the Committee on Research.

which spent most of the past academ
ic year discussing the copyright issue.
The discussion at yesterday's
meeting was part of an ongoing de
bate at universities nationwide about
the rights institutions may have to
creations by their faculty using uni
versity equipment or personnel.
Although traditional academic
custom defines an academic's use of
university-owned personal comput
ers and the libraries as non-signifi
cant uses of University materials, the
line of significant as opposed to non
significant material blurs when com
mercial creations result from the use
of costly University materials or
emerge from technological research.
Much of the senate's debate fo
cused around the issue of defining
"significant use" and whether the
vague language of the resolution was
a blessing or a curse.
Advocating the need to further
define "significant use," Ross
Shachter, associate professor of engi
neering-economic sciences and oper
ations research, inquired, "Is the use
of a half-time programmer for a quar
ter significant use? If we test out a ma
terial for a class, is it significant use?"
Others, noting the diversity of the
research fields, emphasized that it

was impossible to provide specific de
finitions for "significant use." Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
made the analogy between the policy
and the concept of common law by
noting that its traditions and uses
would be defined over time.
Noting that the resolution's lan
guage is necessarily vague given the
inability to predict future technolo
gies, Economics Prof. Roger Noll im
plied that this issue has no solution
because there is no certainty.
"The resolution provides for a
short time frame with oversight," said
Noll, highlighting that the provision is
being given a trial period of three

years and that faculty will be appoint
ed to monitor implementation, to
mitigate concerns about uncertainty.
The resolution will go to the office
of Dean of Research Charles Kruger
and will ultimately be brought to the
Board of Trustees for approval.
"The discussion touched on a
number of the issues and we got feed
back from a breadth of interests from
the University," said Senior Associ
ate Dean of Engineering Joseph
Goodman, who chaired the Commit
tee on Research last year.
1 n other business, the senate unan
imously renewed the degree-granting
power for the Human Biology Pro

gram for eight years, the maximum
length a program can be renewed.
Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra
Satz offered an amendment to renew
the program for eight years. The
Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies had recommended a five-year re
newal because of the anticipated re
tirements of key figures and founders
of the program.
Satz's proposal followed com
ments by Noll who said that renewals
require substantial expenditures and
take a lot of time in preparing reports.
"I see no evidence given the histo
ry of the program that they are going
to have any problem," Noll said.
