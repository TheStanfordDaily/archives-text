At an hour when many students
are dancing the night away, a few
will brave the elements outside
Safeway this weekend in an effort to
better the community.
Members of Sigma Nu fraternity
plan to hold a food drive by sleeping
out in front of Menlo Park Safeway
this weekend. The event will sup
port Second Harvest National Food
Bank of San Mateo, a nonprofit
group that provides food to more
than 100,000 people every month.
The sleepout will run from 4 p.m.
today to 10 a.m. Sunday, and it will
be staffed by fraternity members
around the clock.
Sigma Nu's community service
chair, junior Andy Lam. arianged
much of the event's groundwork
after hearing about a similar event at
another school.
"When he was at a fraternity con
ference \ndy saw that some people
had don a marathon in Seattle."
said Susan Williams, who coordi

nates food drives for Second Har
vest. "He decided that we could do
that here and took the initiative to
plan everything."
Safeway manager Dominic Ran
cadore called the event a "win-win"
situation.
Fraternity members also empha
sized the partnership between Uni
versity students, the community and
Menlo Park Safeway.
"We tried to do an event that was
very integrative of the entire com
munity in that we could benefit from
the generosity of not only the Stan
ford community, but the Menlo
Park and Palo Alto communities as
well," Lam said.
Fraternity members were enthu
siastic to begin the marathon, which
has a goal of 1 ,(XX) to 2.000 pounds of
food.
"The homeless are on the street
24 hours a day." said Sigma Nu Pres
ident Joe Siedel. a senior whose shift
to sleep out is from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m.
"We want to be out there supporting
them and not pack up shop just be
cause it's Fridav night."
