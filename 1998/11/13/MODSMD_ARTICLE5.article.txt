# UFW leader Huerta gives speech
## 'Social activism is as important, if not more so, than studying' 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Dolores Huerta. co-l'ounder of
United Farm Workers, called for stu
dent action in eliminating injustice in
American society, in a speech deliv
ered last night in Kresge Auditorium.
An ethnically balanced crowd of
more than one hundred students lis
tened to Huerta speak out against
racism, sexism and anti-union prac
tices.
"Racism still continues in our soci
ety." Huerta said. "In our schools, we
still teach that Columbus was a hero,
not a mass murderer. We don't teach
the contributions of people of color."
Huerta also spoke out against sex
ism. "Women are not sex objects. No
one owns a woman's body but her
self.'"
Drawing from her past with the
union. Huerta condemned agribusi
ness for what she perceives as anti
union practices and use of toxic pesti
cides.
"It is an ongoing fight." Huerta
said. "We have to keep fighting, so
people know pesticides and
why they are dangerous."
While she believes injustice still
exists in American society, she con
ceded that important steps have been
taken against it. Huerta said that
many major grape growers are be
coming organic and that the union re

cently negotiated its first contract
with an organic strawberry grower.
Huerta was also filled with opti
mism about the recent elections. She
was especially excited about the elec
tion of two Latinos from the San
Joaquin Valley to the state assembly
and the election of the first Latino to
a state office.
Yet Huerta believes that gains still
need to be made.
"Even with the victories and new
people, women are only 12 to 14 per
cent of Congress and 5 percent of the
Senate. And the only African-Amer
ican woman in the Senate was defeat
ed," Huerta said.
Huerta praised Stanford students
for their activism. "Social activism is
as important, if not more so, than
studying," she said.
"All change comes from the bot
tom," Huerta explained. "Look at
the civil rights movement, it was stu
dents like yourselves. Think of the
Vietnam War. Who ended the war?
Students like yourselves.
"Students like yourselves are the
chosen ones and the great leaders of
the future. If vou don't do it, no one
will."
"She is amazing," said junior Mar
isha Banister, who attended the
speech. "This event was definitely
under-attended. We need more of
this type of energy on the Stanford
campus."
