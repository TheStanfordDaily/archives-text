## 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Beginning on Jan. 5, Tresidder
Union will be the new home of Ad
venture Travel Agency.
It will occupy the space formerly
held by the American Express travel
agency and the adjacent Alder
Room on Tresidder s second floor.
"We are very excited about hav
ing Adventure Travel come to cam
pus." said Dean of Students Marc
Wais. "It is our hope that it will be a
convenient, cost-efficient resource
for students, faculty and staff."
The decision to invite this partic
ular business was made by Wais in
conjunction with the Tresidder Stu

dent Advisory Board.
The board had to sift through the
20 to 25 organizations under consid
eration.
In September, the committee
unanimously voted for the move.
"Everything from a laundromat
and a CD store to another food ven
dor and small mini mall were consid
ered." Wais said. "This particular
travel agency was.in our opinion,
the best fit for the campus."
Wais said that /vdventure Travel
"is known as a very aggressive, full
service" travel agency that "the folks
at Bechtel [International Center]
rave about."
Under the terms of the five-year
lease, the agency will move from its

current University Avenue location.
American Express' office has moved
to a site in Palo Alto.
"Our office is eagerly anticipating
serving the Stanford community,"
said Susi Lindley. manager of the
Adventure Travel office that will
move to Tresidder. "We bring a lot
of experience in the travel market."
"The decision to invite Adven
ture Travel as opposed to other busi
nesses was based on several factors
including the space available, stu
dent response and overall need."
said ASSIJ President Maren Nor
ton. who serves on the Tresidder ad
visory board.
"They are designed to cater to
and serve a student population." as

opposed to the departed American
Express, she said."They have agree
ments with airlines for discounts for
students, faculty and staff."
Students are generally positive
about the move.
"I think that it's a great idea to
have a travel agency on campus,"
said Justin Donnelly, a freshman.
Others represent a slightly differ
ent perspective.
"While I think that it's a good
idea. I'm concerned how much
money the services will cost," said
senior Max Erdstein.
Adventure Travel will begin its
move within a few weeks and should
open in its new location sometime in
earlv Januarv.
