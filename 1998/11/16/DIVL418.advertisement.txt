"...a week that lasts a lifetime."
The Alternative Spring Break Scrvice/Lcarning Projects (ASB) expose students to a wide range of pertinent social/envi
ronmental issues through an intensive week of service and learning in the hopes of transforming student concern into a long
term commitment to public service. The program believes that education and exposure are crucial components in trans
forming students into advocates of social, economic, and political issues. If you want to have one of the best experiences at
Stanford, join ASB!
