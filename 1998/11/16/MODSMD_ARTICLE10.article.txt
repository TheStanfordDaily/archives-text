questioning at Stanford among stu
dents as to how we can create a
more academic and intellectual
committee where people engage is
sues outside of the classroom," ex

of the new debate series.
This three-week-old program
presents a multi-partisan forum to
make academics not just seem like

couraging discussions on campus
about important issues", said on
