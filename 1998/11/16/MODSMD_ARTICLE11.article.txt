## Iraq declares itself victor 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) —
After backing down over U.N.
weapons inspections — and nar
rowly avoiding an American missile
strike — Iraq in typical fashion
Sunday declared itself the victor in
the dispute.
Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan told state-run television
that Iraq had been able "to prove to
the whole world that our views are
correct" and that the Americans
were misguided.
"This is the foundation and the
basis of our victory," he declared.
It was the first official reaction to
the weekend's tumultuous events,
and the rhetoric obviously was for
local consumption in a country
weary of U.N. sanctions and of
being isolated, even from its Arab
neighbors.
The newscast made no mention
of President Clinton's warning Sun
day that if Iraq does not abide by its
promise to allow U.N. weapons
teams to come back and work
freely, it will suffer a military attack.
"Iraq has backed down," Clin
ton declared in a news conference
at the White House. "But that is not
enough. Now Iraq must live up to
its obligations."
He said U.S. forces would stay in
the Gulf and warned: "We remain
ready to act."
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz criticized Clinton's vow that
the American government is com
mitted to replacing Saddam's
regime in Iraq.
"I have to condemn strongly the
statement of Mr. Clinton, the plans
of his government to overthrow the
government of Iraq," Aziz said in
an interview on CNN. "This is a fla
grant violation of the Security
Council resolutions as well as

international law."
Iraq will allow the U.N. arms
inspectors to do their normal work
under Security Council resolutions
and the understanding that Aziz
signed in February with U.N. Secre
tary-General Kofi Annan, the
deputy prime minister said.
"Iraq does not accept any fur
ther conditions," he added, hut the
resolution and agreement with
Annan appeared to cover Clinton's
demands for complete access for
the inspectors and full Iraqi cooper
ation with them.
Later Sunday, Richard Butler,
the chief of the U.N. weapons
inspection team, said he was order
ing the inspectors to return to Iraq
on Tuesday.
"I'm going upstairs now to order
our people hack." Butler said as he
left the Security Council chamber
after the body finished its meeting
on Sunday to discuss Iraq's offer to
resume cooperation.
Annan, however, warned that in
a future crisis, military force might
be the only way out.
The United States and Britain
began building up their forces after
Iraq suspended cooperation last
month with the IJ.N. Special Com
mission, which is charged with over
seeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq on Saturday notified Annan
that it had reversed its decision. But
the United States — which called
off an attack at the 11th hour to
study Iraq's statement — did not
accept it until Sunday, when Wash
ington was assured by the Iraqi
regime that there were no condi
tions attached.
Doubts about Iraq's uncondi
tional commitment to inspections
arose, however, when Aziz told

CNN on Sunday that "Iraq is only
committed to the contents of the
letter" he sent to Annan on Satur
day.
The comments caused the Secu
rity Council to delay its meeting
while Deputy U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh, the council's presi
dent. sought to clarify whether Aziz
was suddenly repudiating Ham
doon's assurances.
Aziz quickly clarified his posi
tion in a telephone conversation,
saying his reference to the "letter"
included the three letters of clarifi
cation from Hamdoon to the Secu
rity Council.
I J.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said a note taken from that tele
phone conversation stated that Aziz
had authorized Hamdoon's letters
to the council, and that the letters
"formed part and parcel of his let
ter."
The note was given to the Secu
rity Council for review.
The sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1 WO invasion of Kuwait, limit
the sale of oil and have devastated
Iraq's economy.
The Security Council has said
they will not he lifted until the
weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has eliminated all proscribed
weapons.
Eric Fait, spokesman for U.N.
humanitarian programs, said he
expected 150 relief workers evacu
ated to Jordan to return soon but
added that no date had been set yet.
He earlier had told reporters
that food supplies were adequate to
ensure that Iraq's 22 million people
received a full ration this month.
Hut he said that there were not
enough supplies — especially of
staples like wheat and rice —to
guarantee full rations next month.
