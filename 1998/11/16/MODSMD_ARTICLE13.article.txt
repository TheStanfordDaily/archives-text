# Starr to make case Thursday
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —For
the first time in his tour-vear inves
tigation. Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr will publicly lay out
his case against President Clin
ton — in a congressional forum
riven with partisan politics.
Starr's motives and tactics, as
much as the president's actions, will
he the focus of the I louse Judiciary
Committee hearing set for Thurs
day.
Democrats plan to portray the

independent counsel as a right-wing
prosecutor on a rampage against
Clinton in concert with the presi
dent's political opponents. For
Republicans, the hearing represents
the best opportunity for Starr to
make his case forcefully against
Clinton.
In his impeachment report to the
House. Starr accused the president
of 11 offenses that he considers
impeachable and alleged a pattern
of lies bv Clinton and his loyalists in

the Monica Lewinsky case.
Former Iran-Contra prosecutor
Lawrence Walsh, a critic of Starr for
pursuing the Lewinsky allegations,
said, "1 think his actions deserve all
the scrutiny he's getting, but I'm not
at all sure Starr won't do well.
"The sympathy of the public
during a televised hearing is with
the witness .... 1 think of the
appearance of Oliver North, who
ran away with the congressional
hearing in Iran-Contra."
