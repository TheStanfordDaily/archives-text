PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) â€” Gerardo Bedoya exposed drug
traffickers through the opinion pages of a Colombian newspaper. Jairo
Elias Marque/ criticized politicians in his weekly magazine.
Another investigative journalist, Aristeu Guida da Silva. exposed sus
pected corruption in northern Brazil. And Zaqueu de Oliveira probed the
ruling elite in his Brazilian community of 10.(KK).
All four journalists carried out their work in the provinces and sec
ondary cities of troubled parts of South America, and all paid for their ded
ication with their lives.
Ana Arana, a researcher for the Inter American Press Association, told
its convention Sunday that practicing investigative journalism can be far
more dangerous in small-town South America than in the capitals, simply
because of the various risks that are involved and the lack of law enforce
ment.

"Both in Brazil and Colombia, reporters working for major dailies have
more working space and are safer, but journalists working in the provinces
are more at risk," she told IAPA's 54th general assembly.
Arana said that while journalists in Bogota used bodyguards and took
other measures to protect themselves in 1997, journalists like Bedoy and
Marque/ did not take similar steps.
Bedoya. 56, was shot dead in Cali, Colombia, on March 21. 1997. Mar
quez. 42, was shot on Nov. 20, 1997, in Armenia. 190 miles west of Bogota,
the Colombian capital.
"They did not understand that living in the provinces made them more
vulnerable," Arana said.
Bedoya, a tough editorial writer for the newspaper El Pais in Cali.
Colombia, was apparently killed on orders of the Cali drug cartel, said
Arana.

Guida, 38. was killed in 1995 in Sao Fidelis, where he owned the Gazeta
do Sao Fidelis. He had amassed evidence of local corruption, Arana said.
Zaqueu de Oliveira, 28, published a newspaper in Barroso, a town of
K).(KK) in Minas Gerais, Brazil, where he repeatedly criticized local officials
and government inattention to problems like bad roads and health care.On
March 21, 1995, he was shot in Barroso's town square. No witnesses
stepped forward although the killing occurred in daylight.
David Lawrence Jr., chairman of the lAPA's subcommittee on impuni
ty in crimes against journalists, said Arana's investigation was an important
step forward. "[T]he lAPA has given these cases momentum and has put
the spotlight on authorities... for failing to fulfill the basic duty of protect
ing lives," he said.
More than 2(X) journalists have been killed in the Western Hemisphere
in the past decade and most of the cases have gone unsolved, he said.
