Japan aims to ease out of economic crisis
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Cabinet approved a record economic stimulus
package worth more than $188 billion Monday in an attempt to pull the
country out of its worst recession in decades.
The approval comes after the government outlined a plan last Thursday
for $149 billion in new spending and tax cuts, which was immediately
panned by critics as insufficient.

Apparently shaken hy the criticism that the plan would not he enough to
resuscitate the economy, officials began dropping hints the next day that the
package would likely be bigger, so that the plan would be expected.
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi sees the package as his best change to stop
the economy from contracting for a third consecutive year a key pledge
made after taking office in July. He feels that this may be. at this point, one
of Japan's primary solutions in changing its economic state for the better.
"We must do all we can to cut the vicious cycle of recession in order to

put the nation's economy back into recovery," Obuchi told reporters after
the Cabinet decision, saying the package was aimed at providing economic
growth within one or two years.
Obuchi said the package would include more than $139 billion in spend
ing projects and more than $49 billion in tax cuts.
Japan has come under strong international pressure to pull its economy,
the world's second largest, out of a prolonged slump and to help battered
Asian economies get back on track.
