The Internet may change
the way we learn — and
cut out some life lessons
WHETHER WE LIKE it or not,
the Internet is changing the way
people learn. Universities and
students should ensure that online materi
als actually enhance education, and they
can start hv asking some fundamental ques
tions about how learning takes place.
Today, Stanford students use the World
Wide Web to register for classes and check
grades. A number of faculty members also
use the Internet to post syllabi, visual
images, assignments, lecture notes and
sometimes the lectures themselves. The rise
of information technology raises questions
about its role in undergraduate education.
Online courses could indeed prove more
convenient and flexible. With geography no
longer an obstacle, students from all over
the world could lake classes offered on the
Web by Stanford professors. If students can
choose when to download a lecture or take
an exam, then they have more opportunity
to combine undergraduate study witli pro
fessional and family life. In short, online
education has potential to create a global
Stanford brand away from the Stanford
campus.
At the same time, the "Internetization"
of college might undermine its value as an
intellectual rite of passage. Maybe technol
ogy can eventually support online office
hours and discussion sections, but it can
never replicate the late-night chatter of
dorms. Besides, some courses — social

dance comes to mind — will simply be less
effective on the Web.
Technical capability is clearly not the
only issue. At stake are basic questions
about the value of being a Stanford stu
dent. We need to examine our link with the
University's physical campus. We need to
ask whether effective communication
between students and faculty depends on
being at the same place at the same time,
and whether direct personal interaction
with peers is an essential aspect of educa
tion.
These questions' are particularly perti
nent at Stanford, one of the first institutions
to pioneer distance learning in the '60s. A
founding member of the California Virtual
University, a clearing house of online
courses, Stanford remains committed to
leveraging technology in higher education.
Yet traditional teaching methods still thrive
alongside cutting edge advances.
In some cases, information technology
has enhanced the way Stanford delivers
education, particularly in certain graduate
courses and industry partnerships. E-mail
messages also help to facilitate access to
faculty, especially for shy undergraduates.
At the same time, the much acclaimed pro
liferation of introductory seminars high
lights the value of direct personal interac
tion with professors.
Such examples are hardly paradoxical,
and they reveal an essential lesson. Tech
nology can be an enhancement, but it is not
a panacea. While online education can
prove useful at times, its value must ulti
mately support intellectual inquiry, aca
demic research and excellent teaching.
Besides, the Sixth Man Club would not
be the same on line.
