"Actually, I didn't bring
any, I just assumed some
body else would."
"Did you two bring tooth

"Uh, nope."
"No. I figured that at least one of us
would bring it."
A camping trip with some of my best
friends made the subtle point that there's
something to be said for diversity. There's
some value that people who think different
ly from you can add to a relationship, and
I'm not just talking about tartar control.
Last year, we hosted a sleepover with 10,
count them 10, fourth-grade girls. When
Margo, my America Reads tutoring part
ner, suggested the idea, I'll admit that I was
the skeptical one.
I had this vision of little girls everywhere,
jumping on the mattress in the nookie
room, eating fist-fulls of chocolate chips
straight out of the 20-pound box, rolling toi
let paper down the hallway, dancing on the
pool table and blowing up the condoms in
the bathroom like they were balloons. The
next scene was angry Synergites locking 20
fourth graders in the basement and throw
ing Margo and me headfirst into the com
post. The premise of the sleepover had
some risks, but I knew that Margo's idea
was a good one. A couple hours each week,
we'd tortured the girls through phonics, and
so the least Margo and I could do now
would be to help set it up.
So 10 million ghost stories and bowls of
ice cream later, (and thankfully only one
short-tempered attack on my parenting

skills) we declared the sleepover a success.
It was fun. And another reminder that you
learn about yourself by experiencing a per
spective on life that you wouldn't encounter
in your usual course of events.
It is generally agreed that the ability to
accept, interact with and learn from people
who are different from you, is good. You
learn more about this crazy world and how
you fit in it through dialogue and friend
ships with people who come from a differ
ent background. You can better understand
a 22-year-old single white woman with a
vice for potato chips through some kind of
contrast and comparison with a 40-year-old
Native American man with a wife and two
kids and a secret video game addiction.
Diversity is good. But how do we get it?
How do we make friends with people who
are different from us when we grow up in
neighborhoods identified by uniformity of
home value or skin color? Is it by cramming
80 freshmen in each section of the Wilbur
motel?
A friend went to an interview at George
town University. The interviewer, noting
that my friend a) lived in the suburbs and b)
wasn't involved in any structured communi
ty service projects reprimanded her, saying
something like "Georgetown is a very com
munity-service oriented school. You should
really go and get involved serving soup in a
kitchen downtown and see how the other
half lives."
When I heard about this, I got mad.
I was mad at the interviewer's assump
tion that the best way for my friend to learn
about people who had less money than her
was to give them soup. The interviewer
assumed that the way to understand a
woman from a different class was to hand

her a week's worth of groceries. Was the
interviewer aware that my friend and the
woman who took the groceries attended the
same church and they played soccer togeth
er?
Creating diverse relationships through
community service projects is tricky; how
do you break down barriers by setting more
up? Providing soup or clothes or housing
has a place. The power structure, the labels
of server and served, do not. Community
service programs orchestrate learning about
people who are different from you, but it
seems these relationships would be more
genuine if you were to skip the intermediary
step and have people form the same friend
ships outside the umbrella of a service struc
ture.
I think America Reads is a great pro
gram, but I wish we didn't need it. I wish
that tutors from Stanford didn't have to fall
out of the sky twice a week to make friends
with 10-year-olds who live in East Palo
Alto. Why am 1 neighbors with a 70-year
old French woman but not with first gener
ation Mexican-American fourth-graders?
Newborns don't choose whose womb
they come out of, nor do junior high school
kids have much clout in convincing theii
parents to sell the house and move to a
more racially, economically diverse neigh
borhood. Maybe we have to start by asking
ourselves what kind of neighborhoods the
wombs are living in.

Youth Group from Rhode Island hasn't
volunteered to drive out to Minnesota and
paint her house.
