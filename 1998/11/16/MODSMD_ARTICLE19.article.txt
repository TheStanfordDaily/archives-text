Fight the Big-Time syndrome
Student responses to Ms. Leung's Oct. 22
letter challenging the Athletics Department
have been rambling, sophomoric, and of
such specious logic that they probably help
explain why the Athletics Department con
siders itself an ethic apart from the Universi
ty-
The issue of the Athletics Department's
arrogance in refusing to reveal the salary fig
ures that even the University president was
obliged to do, was obviously about conceal
ing the true grandiosity of the athletic budget
in major income-producing sports.
Here are some salient facts: The 1998-99
Athletics Department total compensation
expense is $13,498,862.00. Knowing that the
second coaching iteration of Bill Walsh's
tenure guaranteed him a compensatory
package obscenely twice that of the Univer
sity president, we can surmise this season's
salary structure. Incidentally, according to
the Sept. 21 San Jose and Silicon Business
Journal, the total athletic budget approaches
$40 million dollars.
Leonard Koppett, New York Times
sports editor emeritus and current lecturer at
Stanford, wrote a couple years ago that when
it came to all-out national football recruiting
expenditure, only Notre Dame exceeded
Stanford. Stanford's endemic ailment is that
it aspires to be both a Notre Dame athleti
cally and a Harvard academically, seemingly

ignorant of the fact that to be one prevents
any chance of being the other.
Non-athlete and athlete academic equiva
lency is another questionable claim. Proba
bly for 95 percent of athletes, academic
achievement is comparable. But for a certain
key number of athletes, primarily in the
largest income-producing sports like foot
ball, it is untrue. According to the March-
April 1997 "Stanford Today," "Stanford
looks for a minimum SAT score of l(XX)" for
athletes. Stanford's all-student 1998 SAT
average is at least 1440. A USA Today tabu
lation two years ago listed Stanford football's
SA'F average as 1069 contrasted with its all
student SAT average of 1367.
Further academic / athletic discrepancy
involves graduation rates. A 1996 USA
Today's analysis of all NCAA Division 1A
schtx)ls showed all Stanford students gradu
ating at a 92 percent rate, yet all Stanford
athletes graduating at an 83 percent rate and
football players at a 77 percent rate.
Until about five years ago, football home
game programs at Stanford always listed
beside each player's photo his academic class
and major. No longer. Why? Would we see
weak-kneed courses of study or too many
"Senior so-and-so. Major undeclared" that
we used to joke about when checking the
USC player photos? If we all ascribe to this
vaunted student-athlete concept, why hide
the student half of the equation?
Perhaps a defining insult to the premise
that Stanford football is, of and for the stu
dents is the moronic early season game

schedule which this year had thiee home
games before any Stanford student was on
campus! Precisely who are the players and
Athletics Department playing for? And
what about the Athletics Department dis
placing the Stanford student rooting section
in order to re-sell those prime 50-yard-line
seats to full-paying non-students?
Ms. Leung, you have only exposed the tip
of the "Big lime Athletics" conundrum at
Stanford. Persevere. Lest this be dismissed as
the polemic of some anti-jock, anti-Stanford
dyspeptic, let me say I was offered a pro
baseball contract upon graduating, am a life
time member of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation and a 12-year ticket subscriber.

Congratulations and many thanks to the
ASSIJ and the Vice Provost's Office for find
ing a way to run the Marguerite downtown
on weekends! This is the coolest administra
tive decision that Stanford has seen in years.
Finally someone made a common-sense
choice and put the students' interests first.
One thing to emphasize that the Nov. 12
Daily article didn't mention: This decision
curbs drunk driving risks. We can all feel bet
ter knowing that there will be fewer intoxi
cated students driving back on campus roads

late Friday and Saturday nights.

Don't dismiss what works
In response to the Nov. 11 letter express
ing dismay at the Alternative Medicine
Interest Group's advocacy of herbal healing,
I ask whether consumers of alternative
medicine believe in its "magical healing pow
ers" more than consumers of conventional
medicine. Patients who seek treatment from
both modalities seek the same result — heal
ing. Categorization of healing arts as "con
ventional" or "alternative" is a waste of time.
Would the advocacy and use of toxic
calomel by l ( >th century physicians be con
sidered "conventional" or "alternative"?
Hippocrates first prescribed aspirin not as a
pill but as the bark extract from willow tree
in the sth century B.C. Hippocrates did not
draw upon molecular truths, but a multitude
of anecdotal truths. The ancient and starry
claims made about Gingko Bilboa have been
verified after some 400 scientific studies.
The relevant information to seek is "what
works," whether it is mantra chants or tran
scriptase inhibitors. Certainly there should
be rigorous evaluation of claims made by
non-conventional medicine. However, this
evaluation is often motivated by an intent to
discredit what is not part of the established

body of knowledge. The idea that a cheap
herb growing in the yard can allay illness bet
ter than an extensively researched synthetic
drug threatens an inherently cumbersome
and expensive pharmaceutical process.
Skepticism and ridicule of alternative
medicine is understandable. A few
unscrupulous alternative therapists taint the
entire body of non-conventional medicine.
However, it is inappropriate to infer an
analogy between non-conventional modali
ties of medicine and voodoo or alien body
snatchers. This is reminiscent of the resis
tance that Copernicus faced when revealing
that the Earth is not the center of the uni
verse. Patients with chronic illnesses such as
cancer often turn to alternative medicine
after conventional medicine has failed.
Alternative medicine is no joke for these
patients and offers a last glimmer of hope
based on anecdotal accounts. One such anec
dotal account about alternative medicine is
my father being cured of a debilitating sciat
ica through acupuncture.
It is important to evaluate alternative
medicine without bias. Preconceived notions
of alternative medicine hinder the discovery
of medical advances from this source of
knowledge. For the sake of the ill, alternative
medicine should not be dismissed.

works," whether it is mantra chants or tran
scriptase inhibitors. Certainly there should
be rigorous evaluation of claims made by
non-conventional medicine. However, this
evaluation is often motivated by an intent to
discredit what is not part of the established

body of knowledge. The idea that a cheap
herb growing in the yard can allay illness bet
ter than an extensively researched synthetic
drug threatens an inherently cumbersome
and expensive pharmaceutical process.
Skepticism and ridicule of alternative
medicine is understandable. A few
unscrupulous alternative therapists taint the
entire body of non-conventional medicine.
However, it is inappropriate to infer an
analogy between non-conventional modali
ties of medicine and voodoo or alien body
snatchers. This is reminiscent of the resis
tance that Copernicus faced when revealing
that the Earth is not the center of the uni
verse. Patients with chronic illnesses such as
cancer often turn to alternative medicine
after conventional medicine has failed.
Alternative medicine is no joke for these
patients and offers a last glimmer of hope
based on anecdotal accounts. One such anec
dotal account about alternative medicine is
my father being cured of a debilitating sciat
ica through acupuncture.
It is important to evaluate alternative
medicine without bias. Preconceived notions
of alternative medicine hinder the discovery
of medical advances from this source of
knowledge. For the sake of the ill, alternative
medicine should not be dismissed.
