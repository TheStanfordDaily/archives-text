# Week of education focuses on Stanford Hospital, strawberries
## Protest concludes 'Week of the Workers'

(iiant cardboard strawberries, a
huge dancing Cesar ( have/, and the
inspirational notes of L.atin
movimiento music helped members
of the Coalition for Labor, Dignity
and Justice celebrate their continuing
fight for workers' equality and right
to unionize Friday in White Plaza.
Members of the Coalition, a joint
effort of Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford and MEChA, cir
culated postcard petitions to passing
students to send to strawberry work
ers who have faced harassment over
their efforts to unionize.
They also collected signatures for
a letter to be sent to the CEO of
UCSF-Stanford Health Care urging
him to let hospital workers organize
freely.
Leaders of the coalition felt that
these signatures added to the overall
success of the week.
"We got over 1.000 signatures just
on the postcards," said junior
Genevieve Aguilar, co-chair of
MEC h A."()ur main goal was to help
the workers, and with these signa
tures we can do that."
Friday's celebration lasted for one
hour. Some students involved in the
coalition wore white masks to repre
sent strawberry workers being
sprayed with pesticides. Others
danced around White Plaza handing
out the petitions in a Cesar Chavez
costume, to remember the co
founder of the United Farm Workers
and his work in starting grape boy
cotts.
The celebration marked the end
of the Coalition's "Week of the
Workers." which focused on labor is

sues. The week included a speech by
another co-founder of the United
Farm Workers, Dolores Huerta.
"Overall, our goal was to get a lot
of people to raise their awareness of
issues facing farm workers and get
students active in campaigns," said
sophomore Seth Newton, co-coordi
nator of SEAS.
"Some students still will not let
themselves he aware of what these
workers go through."
Though a contemporary Latin
band. Quetzal, was scheduled to per
form live on Friday, they canceled at
the last minute.
IJFW organizer Sarah Flocks was
also scheduled to speak at the event,
but did not attend. A member of the
coalition attributed these cancella
tions to scheduling conflicts.
Though the Coalition for Labor,
Dignity and Justice was a temporary
union between SEAS and MEChA
formed specifically to fight against
the mistreatment of strawberry
workers, some of its members are
forming a permanent club to focus on
other labor issues.
1 lie club is tentatively named the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition and
will "participate in labor movements
in the Bay Area, the United States
and the world." according to its mis
sion statement.
"We want to get involved in mak
ing links between students and work
ers to get overall better working con
ditions." said Ethan Kaplan, a doc
toral student in economics involved
in founding the permanent coalition.
"We will focus on wider campaigns
than just the strawberry issue."
The "Week of the Workers," ex
panded campus debate on labor is

sues beyond the traditional grapes
debate.
A vote taken last week revealed a
drop in student interest in the grape
boycott issue, as measured by low

voter turnout.
And campus-wide among those
who voted, the number of those vot
ing to support the boycott and voting
against it were even.
