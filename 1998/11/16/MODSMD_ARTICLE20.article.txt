# Where We Are
## Do you mind answering a few questions?

A PLEASURE TO meet you as well.
Of course, let me take a seat. No
problems at all finding the office:
the directions were perfect. And the drive
over was quite pleasant. Who could ask for
better weather?
Why, yes please. My throat is a little dry.
Nothing like a good cup of coffee to start the
day off right. Thank you. Of course, let's
begin.
I was considering other schools, but Stan
ford was definitely my first choice. It's a pre
mier institution — great teachers, great class
es— but more than that, it was the people
there. Who could ask for better people?
Everyone's just so friendly. And the mixture
of academics and athletics really sets Stan
ford apart.
No, I don't play varsity athletics, per se,
but I'm a big supporter. I try to attend as
many games as possible.
Actually, one. I've only been to one game.
Women's volleyball. At the beginning of the
quarter. But a girl in my dorm plays for the
soccer team, and I talk to her quite often dur
ing meals. About sports.
That's correct: I'm an English major.

In fact, I don't plan on going into teaching.
I'm always asked that question, as if English
were the only subject being taught these
days. Don't they need biology majors to
teach science, or political science majors to
teach social studies? Sometimes it's quite
unnerving. Hut more than that. 1 don't think
I'd find teaching that challenging or intellec
tually stimulating. You know, catering to the
needs of prepubescents all day could be a lit
tle tedious.
Of course, teaching, as a whole, is a won
derful profession. It gives a lot back to the
community. A very admirable profession,
indeed. I'm sure your wife is wonderful at her
job.
I would definitely have to say the Chicago
Bears. I can still remember when they won
the Super Howl in '86.
Oh. do I myself enjoy working as part of a
team? Of course. Ever since AYSO, I've
realized the importance of teamwork in
achieving a certain goal. Oh. that was pretty
terrible. The goal. AYSO, you know. Excuse
me. Really. I'm often much funnier around
my friends. Not that 1 don't consider you my
friend. It's just that we've met onlv a minute

ago.
You're right. I was talking about team
work. Teamwork. I feel, is essential to look
ing at questions from many different view
points. or, in other words, crucial in examin
ing concerns from various perspectives.
I would usually see my role in the team as
the leader. I like to impose structure and pro
vide direction to others. Not that I see myself
as domineering in any way; I always allow
each member of the team to make his contri
bution. Excuse me, his or her contribution.
Not that I'm a pushover either; I stand reso
lute in my convictions. That is not to say that
I would not defer to my superiors if they had
better ideas than my own. Of course, this in
no way implies that I'm merely a follower. Or
that my ideas are inferior.
Yes. I guess you could say that my role in
a team is complex. That's a good way to put
it. Would it be possible to get another cup of
coffee?
That's OK. 1 shouldn't have too much caf
feine anyway. It gets me a little worked up.
My internship lasted about 10 weeks. And
you're right, when I wrote that I was a "criti
cal element in the implementation of a

transnational communication network" that
certainly entailed faxing. But, of course,
there was a lot more than that.
Well, such as the maintenance of the fax
machine — changing the toner, replacing the
paper — but also a significant amount of
photocopying. And e-mailing. And I became
a top-notch Web user.
Usually, just CNN and Sportszone.com,
but if you were to give me the URL of any
site on the Web, I'm sure I could get to it.
No, I think my bosses liked me. They
never told me otherwise.
Well, Microsoft Word. And I can find
myself around Excel, if 1 had to. But, you're
correct, I have no experience in computer
modeling.
If when you say "leadership," you mean
the potential for leadership, I definitely fit
the mold. Only last year. I ran for a position
in my house, and while 1 don't know the exact
results. I heard through the grapevine that I
came in second. If 1 had been elected. I feel 1
could have made some impact on how things
are done. I feel I have the drive and work
ethic that could inspire others.
There might have been onlv two candi

dates. There might have been more.
Sorry. I don't know a whole lot about the
Asian financial crisis. I do hear it's quite bad.
though.
No, I didn't know that it might pose a
threat to the entire world economy. That's
kind of frightening, isn't it?
I can't think of any questions right now.
but I'm sure some will come into my head.
Wait, there is one. Do first-years get their
own offices, or do they get one of the cubicles
in the middle of the floor?
No, I wouldn't mind sharing a cubicle.
Office space is getting tighter and tighter. I
would get my own coffee cup. though,
wouldn't I?
Well. I do have a few at home. I could
always bring one to work. That wouldn't be a
problem.
Once again, it was a pleasure. When, may
I ask. will I be hearing from you about my
status?
That soon.
