## Out of the basement Card nabs first Pac-10 victory 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
As time ran out in Saturday's con
test against Washington State (3-7,0-
7 Pacific 10 Conference), fullback
Emory Brock managed to avoid the
prying eyes of the opposing Cougar
players, his coaches and what was left
of the 30,418 fans who had shown up.
Entering the huddle, he glanced
around, and just at the end of the cho
rus of "All Right Now," he joined the
surprisingly large student body
crowd in a jump on the downbeat.

FOOTBALL

â–  Saturday: Stanford (2-8, 1-6 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) 38, Washington
State (3-7,0-7)28.
It wasn't a big jump, overly
demonstrative, but a jump nonethe
less, perhaps symbolic of the leap
that the beleaguered Stanford foot
ball team (2-8,1-6) took in the fourth
quarter against the Cougars.
Brock was celebrating Kevin
Miller's 32-yard field goal, which had
iced the Cardinal's first conference
victory of the year. For once, the
team could go into the locker room
knowing it had outscored an oppo
nent, that it wasn't the worst team in
the Pac-10, that there was joy in
Mudville at last.
"I don't want to make more of it
than I should,said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "I'm

proud of the character that our young
men displayed in coming back. It's
been a long time coming in getting to
this point of being able to come back
and win one. I think it just kind of fi
nalizes all the things that we've been
working toward all year but were not
able to obtain."
Willingham pushed all the right
buttons in a fourth-quarter come
back that saw Stanford reel off 24
unanswered points in the final frame
to win 38-28. Even after the backlield
corps and defensive line were both
decimated by injuries, Willingham
plugged the holes time and again,
sparking the Cardinal rally.
"You're sitting on the sideline, try
ing to figure out who do you go to
next," Willingham said. "You take
Willie Howard, who's been our start
ing tackle and move him outside. If
you get one more injury, you don't
know where you're going to go; you
might have to put a linebacker d()wn."
By far the most interesting re
placement Willingham made came in
the opening moments of the fourth
quarter. Third-string tailback Brian
Allen had rushed well in the first half,
carrying 16 times for 63 yards, but
suffered a slight concussion and felt
woozy on the sideline.
With the Cardinal down 28-14
with the ball on the WSIJ 43-vard
line, Joe Borchard, in to replace a
struggling Todd Husak at quarter
back. handed off to running back Jon
Eide. who burst off tackle for 11
yards. Two plays later, Eide took an
other handoff and rumbled un
touched for an 11-yard touchdown.
The 5-foot-5 Eide finished with 31
yards on six carries. What doesn't
show up in the stat columns, howev
er, is the way his performance clearly
inspired the Cardinal team.
"You could see everyone on the
sidelines get fired up when he ran it
in," said safety Tim Smith. "It's just
one of those feelings. He's a hard
working guy; he's not very big. When
he scored, it really lifted everyone's
spirits."
The touchdown drew the Card
within 7 with 12 minutes left to play,
but more importantly, may have con

vincetl Stanford it had a chance to
pull one out.
"It feels really good," Eide said. "I
was waiting for any time they needed
me. [ 1 was] a little nervous. But on my
first play 1 had to pick up the middle
linebacker who was blitzing. I cut
him. That pretty much woke me up."
Later in the quarter, Borchard
found Troy Walters on a beautiful
over-the-shoulder catch down the
right sideline, which Walters took
into the end zone.
The Cougars collapsed entirely
on their ensuing possession. Quarter
back Steve Birnbaum completed his
second interception of the game to
Tim Smith, the safety's third of the
game, and Stanford immediately
went 34 yards to take its first lead of
the game on freshman quarterback
Randy Fasani's second rushing
touchdown of the game.
