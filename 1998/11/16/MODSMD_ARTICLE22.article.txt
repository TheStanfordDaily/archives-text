# Pac-10 crown stays on Farm
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Heading into the 1998 season, the Pacific 10
Conference's women's volleyball coaches
picked Stanford to finish second in the confer
ence behind USC.
The Pac-10 media guide claimed that "the
challenge of Stanford is to maintain the level of
excellence it has established, despite having one
of the nation's most inexperienced squads."
With a pair of convincing three-game sweeps
of the Oregon schools this weekend, the Cardi
nal (23-2 overall, 16-0 Pac-10) answered that
challenge and secured at least a tie for its fifth
consecutive conference title.
Yesterday at Maples Pavilion, No. 4 Stanford
came out focused and battled through solid early
play by Oregon State. The Beavers kept the first
game as close as 8-6 before the Cardinal took off
and rolled to a 15-7 victory.
From then on, it was all Stanford.
The Cardinal held Oregon State (12-16,2-15)
below a . ICK) hitting percentage in the final two
games and allowed the Beavers to score only
four more points in the entire match.
The final scores were 15-7,15-3,15-1.
"For the first game and parts of the second,
there was some great volleyball being played out
there," said Oregon State coach Jeff Mozzachi.
"The difference in the end was Stanford's expe
rience, and their ability to stay focused. They
wore us down, especially mentally. They are one
of the most difficult opponents we have faced all
year."
Freshman middle blocker Sara Sandrik led a
balanced Stanford attack with 13 kills, while ju
nior outside hitter Kerri Walsh chipped in 11
kills and a .556 attacking percentage.
Junior Sarah Clark had a phenomenal offen
sive afternoon, posting eight kills on 13 attempts,
good for a .615 hitting percentage — a new ca
reer high. Sophomore setter Robyn Lewis
dished out 26 assists, including the 1 .(XX)th of her
career.
In the final game, freshman middle blocker

Tara Conrad came in and racked up five kills on
as many attempts.
"Obviously my goal is to prove to coach that
I deserve to be out there," Conrad said. "1 just try
to do my best every time 1 get a chance."
Yesterday also marked the second consecu
tive match in which Walsh was able to take full
swings and be a key part of the offensive strate
gy. Constantly hampered by a nagging shoulder
injury, Walsh has often been forced to take it
easy in the second match of a weekend series.
"My shoulder felt really good today," Walsh
said. "It is so good to be able to play a couple
games and take full swings."

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford (23-2, 16-0 Pacific
10 Conference) def. Oregon State (12-16,2-15),
15-7,15-3,15-1.
■ Friday: Stanford def. Oregon (8-20,3-14), 15-
2,15-3,15-3.
On Friday night at Maples, Stanford took
only 67 minutes to dispose of Oregon (8-20, 3-
14) 15-2,15-3,15-3, in front of a crowd of 2,444.
Freshman outside hitter Michelle Chambers
led all Stanford players for the second consecu
tive match with 13 kills.
The Ducks were only able to score eight
points in the entire match, their lowest offensive
output of the season. The Cardinal held Oregon
to negative hitting percentages in the first two
games, -.026 and -.095.
Stanford used solid blocking to contain
Madeline Ernst, the Ducks' main weapon, tojust
three kills.
In particular, Lewis showcased her skills as a
blocker, finishing with four rejections to go with
her 30 assists.
At weekend's end, Stanford head coach Don
Shaw allowed himself to relish in his young
team's success in the Pac-10.
But not too much.

Sophomore setter Robyn Lewis recorded her
I,oooth career kill yesterday against Oregon State.
"It is nice to have a share of the
Pac-10 locked up," Shaw said. "An
automatic bid to the NCAA Tour
nament is important, but what hap
pens next weekend in L.A. will be
more important.
"From here on out. it is all about
tournament seeding, so every match
will be extremely important."
In speaking of next weekend.
Shaw was referring to Stanford's
road trip to play UCLA and USC,
who trails Stanford in the confer
ence standings by two games.
"One of our goals is to win the
Pac-10, and it is nice to have at least
a share," Shaw added. "But I'd
rather have it outright, and if we
beat UCLA next Friday, we can do
that."
And Shaw is not the only one
who would love to pick up a pair of
wins in Southern California.
"Next weekend is huge," Walsh
said. "We can't afford to lose those
matches at the end of the year. But
we are so focused that we will be
hard to beat. We have been waiting
for those matches for a long time."
