# CROSS COUNTRY WESTERN REGIONALS
## Both squads lock up bids for National meet Men's team clinches fourth-straight West Regional crown in Fresno 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
Take seven supremely condi
tioned Stanford runners, add
some of the nation's most chal
lenging competition and a touch
of head coach Vin Lananna's sage
cross country savvy, and the out
come is inevitable.
The Cardinal formula for suc
cess came through like clockwork
Saturday, as the No. 2 Stanford
Machine rolled to its fourth
straight Western Regional cham
pionship, scoring a mere 37 points
to nearest competitor Oregon's
65 in a 23-team field.
Arizona's Abdi Abdirahman
was the individual champion in 30
minutes, six seconds.
In what was predicted to be an
other barn-burner in the style of
the Nov. 2 Pacific 10 Conference
meet, where Oregon and Stan
ford ran neck-and-neck to the
tune of a 48-50 Stanford victory.

the Cardinal ran away from the
competition early and never
looked back.
Led by the strength of senior
standout Brad Mauser, who
toured the 10-kilometer course in
a second-place time of 30:12. the
Cardinal made a convincing case
for the No. 1 spot in the nation,
currently held by Arkansas, and
sent a message to the nay-sayers:
this team is for real.
Seniors Brad and Brent
Hauser and Jason Balkman ran
strong from the gun. as the lead
pack crossed the mile marker in a
blistering time of 4:33.
The pack thinned out soon
thereafter, with Brad Hauser in
hot pursuit of leaders Abdirah
man and Washington State's
Bernard Lagat.
Brent Hauser and Balkman
worked together in a chase pack a
bit further back with senior Jon
Weldon tailing close behind.
As the race wore on. the corn

petition began to fade and sopho
more Thomas Murley, who had
gone out conservatively with se
nior Chris Lundstrom and fresh
man Jamev (Jiffotd. worked with
his teammates to move up into
the top 25 places.

■ Saturday: No. 2 Stanford takes

"We wanted to tempo the first
four miles and lie in a position to
push the last two if we needed to,"
saiil I ananna. "We had several
cues we were looking for and we
knew if we were all in the top 25
positions, we were all right."
Brad Mauser closed magnifi
cently. passing I agat and outlast
ing Oregon's Matthew Davis,
who had bested Mauser in the
Pile-10 meet.
Balkman (30:42) and Brent
I lauser (30:44) were close behind.

finishing fifth and sixth, respec
tively.
Weldon, a pleasant surprise
for the Cardinal, was 10th in
31:03, and Murley rounded out
the scoring for Stanford in 14th
place with a time of 31:12.
Clifford crossed the line in
31:25 for the 21st spot, and Lund
strom finished 25th (31:33).
Both Stanford and Oregon
earned automatic invitations to
the Nov. 23 NCAA Champi
onships in Lawrence, Kan., based
upon Saturday's outcome.
Lananna was pleased with the
Cardinal effort.
"Throughout the season,
we've worried less about the out
come of any particular race and
more about how we run the race
as individuals and as a team,"
Lananna said. "Overall. I think
the guys ran exceedingly well
today."
Saturday's effort does not bode
well for Stanford's competitors in
next Monday's NCAA meet, es
pecially since the Cardinal ran
without the strengths of sopho
more star Jonathan Riley or fresh
man Gabe Jennings, who has been
nagged by shin injuries of late.
Lananna said there was no par
ticular reason for keeping Riley
out of the race, stating only that
"we needed to get some things
fixed without Jonathan or Gabe in
the line-up."
Though Jennings' status for
Nationals is unknown at this
point. Riley is certain to be a con
tender and a key player in the Car
dinal's bid for team victory.
