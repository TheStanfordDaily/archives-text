# Arizona keeps women from winning third-straight Western title
## 
### Barry Cooper Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's cross
country team advanced to the
NCAA Championships as expect
ed this Saturday at the West Re
gional qualifier. What was unex
pected was the lack of dominance
that the team has shown most of
this season.
While the foliage at the ab
solute picturesque Woodward
Park in Fresno, Calif., was at its
peak autumn color, Stanford was
clearly not at the top of its game.
The Cardinal was edged for first
place by No. 11 Arizona by two
points, 78-80.
After the results had been tal
lied, head coach Vin Lananna re
iterated what he had said prior to
the meet.
"We were less concerned
about the outcome today than
with prepping for the NCAAs."

Lananna said. "It was a foregone
conclusion that we were going to
qualify. We won the |Pacific 10
Conference championship]. 1 hat
was really what we were trying to
win. At this one we were just try
ing to qualify."
Stanford, which has won this
meet the past two years and had
defeated Arizona relatively easily
this season at the Pac-10 meet and
the prenational meet, did not run
its best lineup on Saturday. Assis
tant coach Beth Alford-Sullivan
decided to play with the lineup a
little, giving freshmen Laura
Turner and Colleen Flaherty
their first appearances in ;i major
race.
Arizona, third-place Washing
ton and fourth-place Oregon all
ran their top lineups.
"I think that they were in a dif
ferent position in that they need
ed to run well, while we had some
luxury of being able to go in and

gel the job done without having to
tax our kills." Sullivan said.
Liven il the team had finished
third or fourth, il would in all like
lihood still have advanced to next
Monday's NCAA meet in
I awrenee. Kan.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

â–  Ssilurdav: No. 2 Stanford takes
seeond at the Western Regionals.
Despite the laid-back ap
proach towards the meet, sopho
more Julia Stamps had her best
performance of the season with a
sizzling second-place finish be
hind the first-ever four-time fe
male West Regional champion.
Amy Skieresz of Arizona.
Stamps, who has never beaten
Skieresz in cross country since
coming to Stanford, came closer

than she ever has on Saturday.
Skieresz went though the
slightly downhill first mile at 5:01
eompared to Stamps' 5:09 and ap
peared that she would widen that
gap as she usually does.
Yet Stamps never lost contact
with her and went on to finish a
very respectable seven seconds
behind Skieresz's 16 minutes, 26
seconds.
Next Monday will be Stamps'
last chance at defeating Skieresz.
"The gap is totally closing be
tween Amy and I and it will be in
teresting to see what happens at
Nationals," said Stamps.
The second Cardinal across
the line was Sally Glynn in eighth,
followed bv captain Mary Cobb in
15th.
Glynn by no means had a
poor race, pulling ahead of
Magan Maynard of Washington
State just before crossing the
line in 17:12. Yet, it was certain
ly not as solid as her Pac-10 per
formance two weeks ago in
which she finished third, right
behind Stamps.
For Cobb the meet provided
one more opportunity to tune up
for her final NCAA meet, where
she had her best performance as a
freshman, finishing fifth in 1995.
Caroline Annis and Mary
Huang rounded out the Cardinal's
top five as the 24th- and 31st-place
finishers, respectively.
Last year, the Cardinal domi
nated this meet, tallying only 37
points before going on to be upset
by BYU at NCAAs.
