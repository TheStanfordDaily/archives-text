# Fall at the 'Four'
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
At the women's basketball Nike
Four in the Fall tournament this
weekend, Stanford went 2-0 in the
timeout sumo wrestling competition
but failed to have quite as good a re
sult in true tournament play, as the
team went 0-2 in its games against
Arkansas and Duke.
The young and inexperienced
team found out they could play with
best in the country, but have a lot to
work to do if they want to beat those
teams.
On Friday night, the 19th-ranked
Cardinal (0-2) lost to the No. 18
Arkansas Lady Razorbacks (1-0) 76-

71, which placed them in the consola
tion match Saturday against No. 4
Duke, who had fallen to No. 3 Con
necticut 104-74 earlier in the night.

■ Saturday: No. 4 Duke 77 (1 -1). No.

■ Friday: No. 18 Arkansas (1-0) 76.
Stanford 71.
On Saturday, even though Stan
ford was up by one point at halftime,
the young and inexperienced Cardi
nal was unable to pull through and
was routed by the Blue Devils 77-57.
"We have a long way to go," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We

Fall tournament in San Jose.
have a lot of things to work on, but
again this is a very young team. These
are the pains of being young."
Sophomore Carolyn Moos
proved she can hang with best big
players in the country and had an out
standing weekend.
She led the Cardinal with a career
high 22 point and 10 rebounds on Fri
day night. Despite getting into foul
trouble early on Saturday, Moos still
managed to contribute 16 points, all
of which came in the second half, and
three rebounds. Surprising fans and
players alike. Moos even managed to
score a three-pointer.
"Carolyn Moos is exceptional,"
said Duke head coach Gail
Goestenkors. "You saw the fire in her
eyes. She showed us what a repertoire
she has in the last two days. 1 think she
might be the most improved player in
the country."
Indeed, Moos scored a total of 33
points all last year. This weekend
alone, she tallied 38.
Unfortunately, Stanford point
guard junior Milena Flores came up
cold all weekend, shcx)ting 0-12 on
Friday and 1 -11 on Saturday from the
field. Flores gave up four turnovers
on Saturday and seven on Friday.
Despite its growing pains, Stan
ford gave its fans two exciting games
to watch, especially Friday's game,
which went right down to the wire.
Stanford retained a lead over
Arkansas, who made it to the Final
Four last year, for most of the first
half, but with a little over 10 minutes

left to play, the Lady Razorbacks
went on a 14-1 run.
Just as Arkansas was about to
begin its slaughter, freshman
Bethany Donaphin (10 points, 10 re
bounds) sparked the Cardinal of
fense. Within seconds of coming into
the game, Donaphin followed up a
blocked shot with a fast break lay-up,
spring-boarding Stanford's come
back.
Freshman guard Lindsey Ya
masaki added three treys to cut the
deficit to seven. In her first collegiate
basketball match, Yamasaki had 16
points and six rebounds.
The second period was an even
battle as the two teams countered
each other basket for basket.
Arkansas stepped up its defensive
pressure, however, with a full-court
press, forcing Stanford to commit
nine turnovers in the second half. In
pressing, Arkansas took away Stan
ford's ability to run, forcing the Car
dinal to execute its set offense, which
is far from being polished.
Ultimately, the game came down
to the final two minutes.
After Arkansas had led the entire
second half. Moos sunk two free
throws to tie the game at 68-68 with
1:53 left to play. At 1:35, Arkansas
sophomore Wendi Willits, who had
been stale all night, sank a 20-foot
rim-rattler, giving Arkansas the 71 -68
lead.
With Arkansas leading 74-71 with
22 seconds on the clock. Lady Razor
back senior Tennille Adams missed
both of her free throws, giving Stan
ford the ball and a chance to tie up the
game with 19 seconds left.
Arkansas clinched the win when

Flores' late three-pointer fell short.
"We finally caught a couple
breaks," said Arkansas head coach
Gary Blair. "This was a good basket
ball game and we kept it fast and ugly.
This is the first game of the year,
we're all struggling for continuity
right now."
On Saturday, Stanford came out
gunning and looking for a win.
IT\e Cardinal led the entire half
even though Moos only played for
seven minutes because of early foul
trouble. Yamasaki led Stanford with
nine first-half points and Dimson
pitched in six. After a solid effort,
Stanford led 29-28 at the half.
Things didn't go so well for the
Cardinal after the locker room chat
and Duke stepped it up a notch while
Stanford struggled.
Duke grabbed the lead after just
30 seconds into the half and never lost
it. The Blue Devils went on a 20-5 run
in an eight-minute span and then
scored eight straight points to up their
lead to 20.
Stanford did an excellent job of
shutting down Duke guards Hillary
Howard and Nicole Erickson, who
combined for a total of only five
points.
Instead. Duke looked inside the
paint and senior post Michelle Van-
Gorp picked up the slack and then
some. VanGorp stands 6-6, like
Moos, and had a big night with a
team- and career-high 28 points and
seven rebounds.
"I think Stanford is a very good
team and they're going to beat a lot of
people and they're going to continue
to progress," said Duke coach Gail
Goestenkors after Saturday's game.
