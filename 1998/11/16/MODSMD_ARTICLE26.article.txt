# New program takes students to China to teach technology to kids
## Students take their skills abroad 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
Next summer five Stanford stu
dents will have the opportunity to
travel to Beijing as part of the pilot
program of the Stanford Asia Tech
nology Initiative. Students participat
ing in the program, which is run by the
Stanford Society of Asian American
Engineers, will teach a group of 10
specially selected high school stu
dents about technology and its practi
cal applications during an eight-week
program.
"Anyone can learn HTML or
Java on their own. What's really fun
damental is the mind-set to be entre
preneurial, to think differently," said

senior Zheng Yu Huang, the presi
dent of the Stanford Society of Asian
American Engineers. "That's what
we think Stanford students are good
at communicating. It's not only about
teaching technology but using it in
new and creative ways."
The initiative is working in con
junction with the Overseas Studies
Program, which is currently consider
ing the possibility of adding a Stan
ford-in-Beijing center. SATI hopes
to extend its reach even further.
"SATI was founded with the en
tire Asian region in mind to benefit
students in Asian countries with an
interest in technological savvy and
the spirit of entrepreneurship," said
Richard Tan, a junior and project co

ordinator. "Hopefully it will comple
ment OSP and also expand to other
countries."
However, the project must first
begin on a smaller scale. "We're
proving to ourselves and the adminis
tration that it is feasible that we can
send teams to countries," said Huang.
The group is also limited by funds,
as the Stanford student team's ex
penses are estimated at $40,000.
These costs have been somewhat off
set by $l(),(XX)from the School of En
gineering in addition to donations of
computers and support from Hewlett
Packard.
"1 feel this kind of initiative is
good; that is why I support it not only
on the company level but personally

too," said Lee l ing, a vice president
and the managing director of Geo
graphic Operations for HP. "Hope
fully the pilot initiative will be suc
cessful."
SA TI is currently accepting appli
cations from the entire Stanford com
munity for the five-member team.
"It is very important that every
student can play a definable role,"
said Tan, who listed skills such as
"technical knowledge, Chinese lan
guage and cultural sensitivity, teach
ing experience, and teamwork and
leadership experience" as necessary
components of the team. Applica
tions are available in the Office of
Student Affairs in R(x)m 208 of the
Terman Engineering Building.
