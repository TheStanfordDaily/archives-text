### Jessica Tucker-Mohl 
Maurinc Buma, university asso
ciate controller emerita, died Nov.
4 in San Francisco of pancreatic
cancer. She was 79.
Buma, one of the first female se
nior administrators at Stanford, re
tired in December 1984, after
working for 38 years in the con
troller's office.
During her time here, this
much-loved woman designed Stan
ford's accounting system so that
the University was equipped to
deal with the increased demands of
an expanding academic institution.
In 1985, Buma received the
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson Award
for exceptional service to the Uni
versity.
"She really was an extraordi
nary person," said Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy, the former Uni
versity president who presented
Buma with the award.
"I know of very few staff mem
bers who garnered such unanimity
of respect from the faculty. The

people she trained just adored
her."
Other University administrators
agree.
"Mrs. B. was one of a kind," said
Marjorie Caldwell, office adminis
trator in the Bursar's Office. "She
was understanding. She was bright.
She was ahead of her times."
In his citation for Buma's Cuth
bertson Award, Kennedy praised
her dedication to Stanford and
called her the "principal architect
of the accounting system that sup
ported the great epoch of this I Jni
versity's growth."
Buma came to The Farm in
1944, as the University was just be
ginning to emerge from an anti
quated accounting system and was
feeling the first stirrings of its fu
ture as a world-class academic in
stitution.
Although she possessed mas
ter's degrees in accounting and
economics from the University of
Utah and was awarded a fellowship
at Stanford, Buma took a job with
the University instead when her

husband Harold returned home
from the war.
He was pursuing his Ph.D. as
well, and as Buma said in a IW4 in
terview, "We couldn't afford for
both of us to go for a Ph.D."
Despite her superior creden
tials, including several years as a se
nior accountant with firms across
the country, Buma began at Stan
ford with the title of budget clerk
and received a salary of $165 per
month.
"Just about the time I started,"
said Buma, "Stanford received our
first contract from the federal gov
ernment; it was for training U.S. of
ficers in languages in preparation
for the invasion of Japan."
The growth of federal grants
and contracts motivated Stanford
to improve its accounting system,
and Buma played a key role in this
transformation.
"We had to develop our systems
and take on more stall," she said in
l l )K4. "But remember that in those
days we had to do everything by
hand ... we had only manual type

writers, and the few calculators we
had clunked through each opera
tion."
Buma lost her job when she was
pregnant, as was customary, but
she returned after her son, Harold
Jr., was born. Buma eventually
worked her way up to the position
of senior accountant of the Univer
sity.
Buma spoke about discrimina
tion against women in the profes
sional world, and expressed feel
ings of regret that she hadn't done
more to support the women's
movement.
"In a way, I have had blinders on
most of my life," she said.
"I was not paid a salary equiva
lent to men's, but at the time it did
not bother me. In fact, I was not
conscious of it."
Buma's husband Harold died in
19K1, and after her retirement, ac
cording to Caldwell, "she got the
travel bug."
Through Elder Hostel, she trav
eled all over Asia and Europe.
"I know of no person more ded

icated to Stanford University," said
Education Prof. John Gardner in
his nomination of Buma for the
Cuthbertson Award.
"Besides having a unique
knowledge of Stanford's financial
affairs, she has gained the admira
tion and respect of all who are as
sociated with her."
She is survived by her daughter,
Celia Burdick, of San Francisco,
her son-in-law C'hris, and grand
son, Aaron; her son, Harold Buma,
of Happy Camp, Calif., and his
wife, Annie.
Buma requested no services.
Her family has suggested that
memorial donations be made to
Cameron House, a mission of the
Presbyterian Church that provides
social services in San Francisco's
Chinatown.
A window in Buma's apartment
overlooked Cameron House's
playground.
Donations should be sent to 920
Sacramento Street, San Francisco,
CA 94108, Attention Claire
Barnes.
