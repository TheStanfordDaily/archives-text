# Hoops pulls away from Aggies in opener
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
It's true that no matter how much
a team practices, nothing can really
simulate a game situation.
And that's just what the No. 3
Stanford Cardinal (1-0) found out on
Saturday night after it needed to
overcome a sluggish start to put away
the UC-Davis Aggies (0-1) 76-49 in
its first game of the season.
"1 think that's exactly why we
scheduled the game," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery,
whose team went into the half with a
10-point lead against the Division 11
Aggies. "I'm not pleased with every
thing we did ... [but] I think that will
really help us."
Playing with a fast and aggressive
UC-Davis team, the Cardinal had to
scramble a bit and didn't immediate
ly find the offensive performance it
was looking for.
"We didn't make as many shots as
we would have liked tonight," said
point guard Arthur Lee, who had
seven points and four assists. "But it is
early. It's expected right now."
Led by junior power forward
Mark Madsen, however, the Cardinal
was able to dominate the boards
throughout the game, out-rebound
ing the Aggies 55-28, and shutting
down UC-Davis' offense, with the
Aggies hitting a poor 15 of 50 shots
from the field.
Madsen finished the game with a
team-high 11 points and 11 rebounds,
the eighth double-double of his ca
reer.
"It was very intense and very fast
paced." Madsen said. "UC-Davis is in

great shape. They are very funda
mentally sound and very quick.
The defending Division II nation
al champions, the Aggies played on
pure adrenaline as they found them
selves in front of a sold-out Maples
Pavilion crowd, facing a top Division
I team and their toughest challenge
yet.
"We were so excited to be able to
play here," said UC-Davis head
coach Brian Fogel. "This is huge for
us. I knew we would come out and
compete."
Pulling away in the second half.
Stanford went on 11-3 and 10-0 scor
ing runs which included a Jason-to-
Jarron Collins dish-and-dunk perfor
mance to the delight of the crowd.
Jarron Collins finished with seven
points and four rebounds while
brother Jason added four points and
six rebounds to the Cardinal's cam
paign. Jason Collins returned for
Stanford after sitting out last season
as a medical redshirt with frayed
meniscus cartilage in his left knee.
With no Cardinal playing for more
than 22 minutes of the game, Stan
ford provided a balanced attack. Se
niors Peter Sauer and Kris Weems
added 10 points apiece to the Cardi
nal cause.
"If you take one thing away from
this Stanford team, they are going to
be able to attack you in another way,"
Fogel said.
Madsen felt the second half was a
much better indication of Stanford's
capabilities.
"We did realize that we can play a
lot better and I think we did that in
the second half," he said.
While Montgomery felt that Sat

urday night's game provided good
preparation for the Preseason NIT
Tournament, which begins this
Wednesday for Stanford, there were
certainly several aspects of the Cardi
nal's game that he felt needed work.
"The best thing [for them] to do to
us right now is foul us," Montgomery
said after watching his team shoot
48.3 percent from the free-throw line.
"I'll bet that we'll come back and
shoot a lot of free throws in these next
practices," Madsen added.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (1 -0) 76,
UC-Davis (0-1) 49.
Stanford also seemed to be feeling
its way around in several other areas
of the game. It's three-point shooting
was below par with normally sharp
shooting junior Ryan Mendez miss
ing all six of his three-point attempts.
In addition, the Cardinal was still
experimenting with some combina
tions on the floor. While the starting
lineup appears to be set, as all five
starters return from last year's Final
Four team. Montgomery was trying
to give both sophomore Mike Mc-
Donald and freshman Tony Giovac
chini time at the point guard position.
McDonald and Giovacchini were
thrown in to back up Lee, as well as
have Lee accompany them on the
floor as an off-guard.
"We have five post guys that all
can play. It's difficult time-wise,"
Montgomery said. "It's a tough deal
and that's the same situation at the
point guard. I don't want to get where
I'm playing [five guys as a] unit."
