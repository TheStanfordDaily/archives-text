# Men's hoops under pressure
## Team's preseason hype leads to postseason hopes 
### Gil Lopez Editorial shift 
After all of the preseason hype
and anticipation, the men's basket
hall team finally stepped out onto
the court and began its long jour
ney to what will hopefully be a re
turn to the Final Four and even a
national championship.
And maybe it was just opening
night jitters, or the kind of early
season problems that every team is
expected to have, but the No. 3
Cardinal showed that there are def
initely some things it needs to work
on for the next four months before
the NCAA tournament.
But it didn't seem to matter much.
The Sixth Man Club was back in
its usual position: loud and rau
cous. Its members opened this sea
son the way they finished the last
one, with a no-holds-barred, in
your-face verbal attack on UC-
Davis and the referees. Just like the
weak kid who always mouthed off,
because he hung out with the
school bully.
But this time it's completely dif
ferent.
A year ago, Stanford's run into
the Final Four was a shock. As
deep and as good as the Cardinal

â€ž was, no one could have expected
that they would have finished just
two points shy of the national
championship game. This year it's
expected they do at least as well, if
not better.
"Maples was nearly packed
tonight," said junior power for
ward Mark Madsen. "There were
all kinds of people around. The
Sixth Man Club was nearly filled. It
wasn't like that this time last year."
Much of the excitement behind
this year's Cardinal team lies in its
extraordinary depth, a point driven
home by the fact that freshman
Kyle Logan will redshirt the sea
son.
Unfortunately, that overflow of
players at each position creates
some problems for head coach
Mike Montgomery.
"I want a guy to feel that he's
able to go in and that the parts are
interchangeable," Montgomery
said.
This juggling of talent led Mont
gomery to use starting point guard
Arthur Lee at the off-guard posi
tion. thus allowing reserves Mike
McDonald and Tony Giovacchini
more time at the team's helm.
Hut. like last year, the team
members seem more concerned

with winning than with who's play-,
ing where or how much.
"I pretty much know my role,"
Lee said of the lineup shifts. "If we
need more than one ball-handler
out there that's fine.
"As long as we're winning, I
don't care [what position I play]."
Of course, the bodies in the
frontcourt are even more numer
ous.
With eight different players who
arc able to fill in at either the for
ward positions or the center spot,
those big bodies are beginning to
crowd underneath the basket.
The constant substituting does
allow for fresher players to remain
on the floor, but the team's consis
tency in preformance could also
suffer with so many players coming
in and out of games so quickly.
Montgomery said one such ef
fect was on the team's shot selec
tion, which was sometimes ques
tionable in the first half.
"We could have used a little bit
better shot selection at times,"
Montgomery said, "but we needed
to get a game under our belt.
"It's a matter of finding the right
combinations of people that play
well together and finding what's a
good shot and what's not."
