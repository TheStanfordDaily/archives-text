# In vote, students show little interest in grape ban
## Support for grapes boycott drops 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Following a newly implemented voting week
to allow Stanford students to decide whether to
support or oppose the United Farm Workers'
table grapes boycott, fewer Stanford students
supported the boycott this year than last.
As many students opposed the boycott as
supported it, with students in Branner, Florence
Moore, Stern and Wilbur Halls and Avanti Eat
ing Club voting for the boycott and students in
Ricker and Manzanita Dining Halls, Roble Hall
and Beefeaters, Bollard. Middle Earth and the
Toyon Eating Clubs voting against it, according
to information released by the Grapes Educa
tion Committee. Voting in the Row houses that
have reported their totals divided evenly on the
issue, and the results from Lagunita are not yet
calculated.
This fall, the University made a greater effort
to educate students about the grapes boycott
than it has in recent years. Yet even with the re
newed educational effort on behalf of the Uni

versity, student organizations — such as Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stanford and
MEChA — continue to play an instrumental
role in reaching out to Stanford students.
At Stanford, the grapes boycott is a particu
larly sensitive issue, dating back to a three-day
hunger strike staged by four students in 1994. A
major reason for that hunger strike was the Uni
versity's refusal to ban grapes from residences.
Both before and after the protest in 1994,
University policy has called for individual resi
dences to vote on whether to serve grapes each
fall. Resident assistants are responsible for their
own dorms and houses, both educating students
and organizing the vote.
MEChA and SEAS leaders expressed disap
pointment with the results of this year's vote,
both with the number of students who partic
ipated in discussions and voting on the subject
and with the actual results.
"It's very disheartening," Aguilar said. "It
angers me the fact that people haven't been

Ux)king outside Stanford to realize
the issue. It's really disheartening."
Sophomore Ryan Renteria,
ME( hA co-chair, said that inconsis
tencies in voting policy make it im
possible to determine what percent
age of the student body actually par
ticipated in the vote. 1 te did say, how
ever. the turnout was low.
"More students should have
voted and more should have been at
the discussions," Renteria said.
Resident assistants were given the
option of allowing MEC'hA and
SEAS representatives to make pre
sentations, Renteria said.
In the interest of making sure pre
sentations remained fair and bal
anced, some RAs said ihey declined
the opportunity to have ME( hA and
SEAS representatives speak to their
residents, choosing instead to show a
video prepared to inform students

about both sides of the grapes boy
cott.
"It's really difficult to find people
who are equally passionate on both
sides of the issue," said senior Eliza
beth Langen, an RAin Cedro.
"That's why we decided to show the
video."
Langen added, however, that the
video did not draw a large crowd and
that many residents left the screening
without watching the whole video.
With a turnout of 30 percent for all of
Wilbur, Langen said, she was disap
pointed.
"The grapes issue doesn't seem
meaningful to students," she said.
Other residences hosted debates
to ensure balance, inviting the
MF.ChA representatives to speak,
but finding residents who opposed
the ban to present the other side of
the issue.
"The presentations tend to be
one-sided and we wanted both sides
to be equal," said Hotter RA Erik
Benson, a senior.
