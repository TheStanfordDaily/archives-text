# Programmers head to world finals
## 
### Julie Chai Contributing writer 
The problem: you have 16 people
who will be dining together for five
days. Each day, you have four tables
of four and you have to make sure
that each person sits with every other
person once during that time frame.
What do you do?
Three Stanford students who
solved this dilemma are on their way
to Eindhoven, The Netherlands, to
compete in the World Finals of the
Association for Computing Machin
ery's International Collegiate Pro
gramming Contest. I*he contest chal
lenges students to work creatively
and efficiently in a team environment
and solve programming problems
under pressure.
David Weekly, Doug Anderson
and led Hwa are the computer pro
gramming team that took second

place at the Pacific Northwest Re
gional level of the contest Saturday in
Chico, Calif. They competed against
26 other teams and received a $1 ,(KK)
stipend to help fund their trek to the
finals.
'ITie team is one of two regional
winners who will go on to the finals.
"I'm psyched to go to the Nether
lands," said Weekly, a junior major
ing in computer science.
"I think they've got a great shot [at
winning the finals] and should make a
good showing," said James Kuffner,
a doctoral student in computer sci
ence who is the local contest organiz
er and coach of Stanford's program
ming teams.
Stanford's two teams at the re
gional placed second and third. A
team from UC-Berkeley took first
place.
The teams, which are usually
made up of two undergraduates and

one first- or second-year graduate
student, had to solve six program
ming problems in five hours.
"We just went in and worked as
hard as we could," said Weekly.
Hwa, a doctoral student in math
ematics, said, "It was pretty intense,
but we had a lot of fun. The team
worked together well."
The 28-year-old contest, currently
sponsored by IBM, is the oldest and
most well-known of its kind. More
than 4,(KX) students from around the
globe participate annually on three
levels: local, regional and the world fi
nals. Students compete individually
on the local level and the top six pro
grammers form two teams of three to
be sent to the regionals.
According to Kuffner, Stanford's
teams have been participating in the
contest almost since its inception and
have won the international competi
tion more than any other team.

"Netherlands or No," a version of
"Netherlands or Bust," was the slo
gan the team used to motivate them
selves, according to Weekly.
The world finals, scheduled to be
held in April 1999. mark the first time
the international contest will take
place outside of the United States.
"[Going to the finals] is really, re
ally exciting." said Hwa. " There are
excellent teams from all over the
world and it will take a lot of practice
to do well."
One of the biggest challenges of
the regional and final competitions is
that programmers compete as a team
rather than individually.
"With three people on one com
puter, it would seem inefficient, but
we've made it work to our advan
tage," said Ken Takusagawa, a junior
majoring in computer science and
economics whose team took third
place.
