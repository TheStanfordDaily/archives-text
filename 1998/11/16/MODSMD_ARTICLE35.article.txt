# Card closes season with tie
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — In its last regu
lar-season match, the day before the
NCAA tournament seeding an
nouncement, the No. 7 Stanford
men's soccer team (14-4-2, 5-2-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
had hoped to send a forceful message
to the tournament selection commit
tee.
A scoreless tie yesterday against
unranked California (8-10-2, 4-4-1
MPSF) was not the message the Car
dinal had hoped for.
After a 1-1 double-overtime bat
tle against Cal State-Fullerton last
Sunday, Stanford was looking to end
the conference season on a positive
note.
"It is disappointing," said Stan
ford head coach Bobby Clark. "It was
definitely half a loaf again. At least
we don't go totally hungry, but it
wasn't a banquet. It was not a great
game."
The game leaves Stanford in the
mix of four MPSF teams vying for a
postseason berth and a first-round

home game in the West region.
Brackets are announced today at 6
p.m.
Although neither team was able
put the ball in the net, Stanford con
trolled most of the game, as evi
denced by its 12 corner kicks to Cal's
one.

■ Saturday: No. 7 Stanford (14-4-2,5-
2-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) 0, California (8-10-2,4-4-1)0.
"It was quite clear that we were
the stronger team," said freshman
defender Lee Morrison. "We took
charge of possession the entire game,
and were just unlucky finishing at the
end."
But while the Cardinal dominat
ed, the team was unable to create
many solid scoring opportunities due
to Cal's defense.
After attempting to come at Stan
ford in the first half, the Bears
changed their strategy for the re
mainder of the game, relying more on
their defense and creating opportuni
ties on the counterattack.

"They tried to take it at us in the
first half and that is when we were at
our best. We'd take the ball off
them," said senior defender Jamie
Gark.
"In the second half they realized
they couldn't and it became an ugly
game," he added.
Ironically, the counterattack is the
Cardinal's weapon as well, and the
Bears didn't allow Stanford many op
portunities.
"We knew Stanford's game com
ing in. We shut down what they do
well — counterattacks," said Cal
head coach Mark Mallon.
The Bears' success in silencing
Stanford came as they packed in their
defense and allowed the Cardinal to
come at them.
Several of Stanford's chances
came off corner kicks. Early in the
second half, Morrison nearly put the
Cardinal on top as he leapt above his
defender and headed the ball just
high of the goal.
As the game turned to overtime,
Stanford continued to control the
ball, but the Bears' managed the best
shot at victory.
