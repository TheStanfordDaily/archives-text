Many Cardinal swimmers had
said earlier that they knew the Wolf
Pack featured many fast swimmers.
However, they were still surprised
by Nevada's performance early on.
The Wolf Pack won the meet's first
two events, the 400-yard medley
relay and the 1,000-yard freestyle
and Nevada junior Limin Liu set a
pool record in the 200-yard butter
fly.
"After the first two events, it was
a little scary," said Stanford junior
(iuhriellc Rose. "We had to come
together as a team and use our
depth."
I or many on the team, this meant
swimming different events than they
had prepared for.
According to senior co-captain
Emily Smith, head coach Richard
Ouiek switched around the lineup
throughout the meet to ensure top
ranked Stanford would stay ahead
of Nevada.

spread most of the workload

which they are not as last. 1 lowever.
because Nevada was swimming so
well, he was forced to insert some of
the team's faster swimmers in events
in which he knew they could score
points.
"Even though they had warmed
up or prepared for a different race, a

few people had to change what they
were doing right before they swam,"
said senior co-captain Elin
Austcvoll. "Hut, no one complained
or whined about it. Everyone
stepped up when they were asked to.
They all came through."
While the meet unfolded differ
ently than the Cardinal had planned,
the changes worked out well for the
team's long-run success, Austevoll
said.
"It's important that we had to act
like we were a team to win," she said.
"Every member of the team has to
feel like they are needed and have to

contribute. This meet reminded us
of that."
Leading the team charge were a
few fine individual efforts.
Austevoll, Rose and junior Cather
ine Fox won two events each and,
between them, recorded five NCA A
provisional times.
Many of the lineup changes were
necessary because Stanford has
been hurt by injuries. Senior co-cap
tain Chantal Rawn did not swim be
cause of a recurrent shoulder prob
lem and sophomore Lauren Thies
was out, and will be for a while be
cause of a fairly serious back prob

lem.
Many of those who did swim, in
cluding Austevoll and Fox, have
missed a number of practices in the
last two weeks because of illness.
While the team was able to fall
back on the coach's quick thinking
and its overall depth against Neva
da, the Cardinal will have to be
healthy to survive in January and
February. The team's next two
meets, Jan. 8 and 9, will be at top-10-
rated Auburn and No. 2 Georgia, re
spectively. Every other team the
Cardinal will face this season is rated
in the top K2O, including No. 3 USC.
