# Team to assess NCAA compliance
## 
### kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
Today the peer review team for
Stanford's Athletics Department cer
tification will descend on campus to
assess the University's compliance
with NCAA regulations.
The job of the peer review team,
which will be here until Thursday, is
to assess the athletic program and see
how it has responded to evaluations
offered by the University Steering
Committee over the past year. The
peer review team is specifically con
cerned with how well Stanford inte
grates athletics and academics and
complies with NCAA rules and regu
lations.

Stanford is not unprepared for this
visit, however. When Mary Edmonds
left her position as Vice Provost for
Student Affairs in 1997, she took over
as chair of the Steering Committee,
which has been conducting a self
study over the past year to evaluate
the overall performance of the Ath
letics Department.
The Steering Committee studied
the Department of Physical Educa
tion. intramural sports and intercolle
giate athletics while evaluating three
main areas.
The committee examined acade
mic integrity, studying how well inte
grated student athletes are into the
academic arena; fiscal integrity, the
process of ensuring that PE classes,

intramural sports, and intercollegiate
athletics receive and disperse proper
funding; and commitment to equity
concerning both gender and minori
ties.
"A self-study has a lot of good
things about it." said Edmonds, 'it
lets us access how well we're doing."
One rule that Stanford has tradi
tionally had problems complying
with is the federal Title IX statute,
specifically its requirement that the
gender ratio in college athletics re
flect the gender balance at the school.
For example, during the 1996-97
school year, 50.1 percent of Stan
ford's student body was female, but
only 42.8 percent of Stanford athletes
were women, which is outside the 5

percent deviation permissible by
Title IX.
Stanford is close to correcting the
problem, according to Athletics Di
rector Ted Leland.
The University has the resources
to create more athletic scholarships
for female athletes to assure that they
are present in the Athletics Depart
ment in the same proportion as they
are represented in the student body.
Fixing the problem will cost Stanford
about $2 million annually, Leland
said.
"The rich have the luxury of being
philosophically committed," said Le
land. "1 think that's sad, but that's the
