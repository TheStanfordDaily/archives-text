# Prof finds fault with 'gender gap' theories

### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
In a recent study published in the
Journal of Labor Economics, Eco
nomics Prof. Anne Royalty found
the traditional explanation for the
gender gap unconvincing.
The large discrepancy between
the salaries of comparably educated
men and women has been conven
tionally explained away by citing the
fact that women have a higher
turnover rate than do men overall,
and are therefore paid less.
Royalty broke new ground when
she decided to separate the data into
statistics for women who had at least
a high school education and those
who had less schooling.
Examining young men and
women in the early stages of their ca
reers, Royalty found that highly edu
cated women behaved indistinguish
ably from their male counterparts,
but were paid almost 20 percent less.
The turnover rates were consistent
between the genders.
Royalty believes that this study of
younger workers shows a trend that
will continue.
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright
found Royalty's study convincing.
"I believe her results are solid,"
Wright said. "The old explanation for
the gender gap appears to fall apart."
Royalty found a different type of
inequality for less educated women.
"It was a two-dimensional disag
gregation," Royalty said. "First. I dis
aggregated between women with a
high school education or more and
those with less education. I also dis
aggregated job turnover, dividing it

between those who left jobs for other
employment and those who left it for
non-employment."
Royalty's findings indicated that
less educated women did have a high
er turnover rate than comparably ed
ucated men. Their rate of job to non
employment turnover was signifi
cantly higher as well.
"From that data, it would seem
that the gender gap in wages for less
educated women would make
sense," said Royalty. "However,
their job-to-job turnover rate was
lower than that of men, so it is still not
justified by the data."
Royalty found that less educated
women suffered an even larger dis
crepancy in wages than highly edu
cated women. They earned an aver
age of 77 percent of what a compara
bly educated man would be paid.
While Royalty's study does much
to facilitate understanding of differ
ences in salary between men and
women, its forecast for the future of
the labor market may be its most im
portant conclusion.
"The gender gap is a historic prob
lem of labor economics," said
Wright. "Prof. Royalty's data, while
indicating that there is unfairness that
is not related to any economic mo
tive. does offer a certain measure of
optimism."
Royalty takes a similarly historical
perspective on her work.
"Though the study is probably
more likely to describe the future
than the past, it is historically rixrted
in the sense that the questions it asks
are rooted in the history of the
women's labor market," said Royal-
