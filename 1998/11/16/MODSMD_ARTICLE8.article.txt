# Panel discusses bilingual education
## 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
If you were a child newly moved to
California from another country,
how would you best learn English?
To search for the answer to this ques
tion, a panel held in Oak Lounge Sat
urday debated the benefits and draw
backs of bilingual education.
The panel was sponsored by Stan
ford Advocates for Children in reac
tion to Proposition 227, an initiative
passed last June in California which
places non-English speaking students
into special English-only classrooms.
"We want to educate and empow
er Stanford students regarding the
implications of Prop. 227 and how
schools are responding to it," ex
plained junior Tammy Lee. "We

wanted to provide a neutral forum
where we could present both sides of
the issue."
Under Prop. 227, students are re
quired to try out English-only pro
grams for 30 days, at which time par
ents have the option of requesting a
waiver to transfer the child into a
bilingual classroom.
The panel was comprised of Edu
cation Prof. Kenji Hakuta; Liz Wolfe,
principal of Adelante Spanish Im
mersion School; former radio-talk
host Rob Roberts and the author of
Prop 227, Ron Unz.
"It is unfortunate that it continues
to focus on the language of instruc
tion as if that will change things by it
self," he added. "We should examine
underlying issues such as socioeco
nomics and the need for more re

sources. There is a lot more to school
development that we need to re
search."
Unz stressed the failure of tradi
tional bilingual education to teach
English, arguing that in practice, stu
dents often get Spanish-only instruc
tion.
"Twenty-five percent of Califor
nia public school children are non
proficient in English. Under bilingual
education, only 5 percent of those stu
dents learned English by the end of
the year, implying an annual failure
rate of 95 percent," said Unz.
Unz favors the replacement of
bilingual education with sheltered
English immersion. "Youngsters not
fluent in English are placed in a sepa
rate classroom in which they are
taught English as soon as they enter

school. Studies have shown that shel
tered immersion is the most effective
means for young children to learn an
other language," said Unz.
Wolfe argued that some systems
of bilingual education are effective,
and should be kept under local con
trol. In Redwood City, where Wolfe
works, they sequentially increase the
use of English instruction from
kindergarten to fifth grade.
Wolfe said, "The long-term effects
of Prop. 227 are devastating. How will
it affect children's self-esteem and
confidence when they are spoken to
in a language they don't under
stand?"
Roberts defended Prop. 227, em
phasizing that in America, "We are
not a homogeneous society. We need
... a glue â€” our common language."
