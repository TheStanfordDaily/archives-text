## Housing at Moffett Field? 
### Amy Reeves 
Graduate students and professors who have been
squeezed by the local housing crunch may soon find shel
ter in the former houses of Navy pilots.
According to Michael Marlaire. spokesman for the
NASA/Ames Research Center, Stanford and NASA
officials have been discussing the possibility of Stan
ford's taking over almost 7(X) residences near the Moffett
Federal Airfield in Mountain View. About half of the
units would still be occupied by military personnel, who
live there now. and the other half would be reserved for
Stanford students and faculty.
The housing will open up as a result of the military's
continuing withdrawal from the base. Moffett Field was
closed as a naval air station in 1994 and taken over by
NASA, with the Shenandoah Housing Complex operat
ed by Onizuka Air Station. Over the next two years,
however, the military units that still operate there will be
further reduced, causing Onizuka to
relinquish all but 111 houses.
NASA, which already has a re
search and development partnership
with Stanford, turned to the Univer
sity with an interest in expanding the
research and development projects
on the field and finding another party
to manage the housing. According to
Marlaire, Stanford expressed an in
terest in using Shenandoah to relieve
its housing crisis.
Larry Horton, Stanford's director
of government and community rela
tions, said that although the Universi
ty and NASA were having "serious
and productive discussions," the idea
is still only being discussed, and no
firm plans have been made about
how or for how long the housing
would be used. He said that even if
the plan goes through it would prob
ably be only a temporary solution to
Stanford's long-term housing prob
lems.

Marlaire said that the plan is still
in the talking phase and will not be
decided upon for a few more months,
hut he said it was probable that the
idea would go through. He said that
NASA is excited about expanding
their aeronautic and information
technology labs with Stanford's ex
pertise, and that using Shenandoah
to relieve Stanford's housing pres
sures would mean that "everybody
comes out happy."
Not everyone would benefit from
the move, however. Linda Forsberg,
Deputy City Manager of Mountain
View, said that the City Council's
stated policy is that the housing
should be retained for military per
sonnel. Forsberg said that there will
still be demand from various military
agencies for the houses.
The city prefers this option be
cause the Whisman School District
receives a federal subsidy for every
soldier's child who attends.
Marlaire will meet with the City
Council tonight to discuss the issue.
He agreed that there is opposition in
the council.
