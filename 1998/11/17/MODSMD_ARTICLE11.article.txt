## Iraq allows U.N. ambassadors to return to Baghdad 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — U.N.
weapons inspectors are to return to
Baghdad on Tuesday in the first test
of Iraq's pledge to cooperate fully
in eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.
The return of U.N. personnel to
Iraq began Monday, as 30 relief
workers who had pulled out in fear
of a U.S. military strike arrived at a
military air base outside the capital,
Baghdad, aboard a special U.N.
plane from Jordan. Another 120
workers were due overnight on a
bus convoy through the Jordanian
desert.
Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan's envoy to
Baghdad, said in an interview that
Iraq was being watched closely to
measure its cooperation with U.N.
inspectors searching for forbidden
weapons.
At the United Nations, chief
weapons inspector Richard Butler
underscored the warning, calling
the latest crisis with Iraq the most
serious since the 1991 Persian Gulf
war. Butler said Iraq had one more
chance to tell the truth about its
weapons programs.
"The material we need exists. It
is in the possession of the govern
ment of Iraq. They can choose to

give it to us or not." he said. "I hope
they're listening because the conse
quences are very severe."
The threat of military action was
averted Sunday when President
Clinton announced the United
States had accepted the Iraqi gov
ernment's pledge to lift its three
month ban on U.N. weapons
inspections.
The U.N. Security Council has
said economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Iraq
will not be lilted until U.N. arms
inspectors and the Vienna-head
quartered International Atomic
Energy Agency certify that Iraq has
eliminated its lethal weaponry.
Diplomats and Iraqi officials
revealed Monday the behind-the
scenes drama that led to Iraq's sud
den announcement Saturday that it
would reverse course and end its
blockade of arms inspectors.
The officials — who spoke on
condition of anonymity —
described the series of secret meet
ings that preceded Saturday's decla
ration.
Late Friday night, the ambas
sadors of France, Russia and
China — Iraq's defenders in the
Security Council — met with For
eign Ministry officials to warn that

the United States was serious about
a strike and to urge Iraq to let the
U.N. inspectors back.
Those contacts preceded by just
hours the appeal by Annan, which
was faxed by Iraq's ambassador in
New York. Nizar Hamdoon, to the
Iraqi leadership in Baghdad at
about 2 a.m. local time Saturday.
Iraq broke its silence 12 1/2
hours later, when Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz telephoned
Shah to say that there would be a
"positive reply" to Annan's letter.
By about 4:30 p.m., Iraq's formal
response was read to Shah's office
for transmission by fax to Annan. A
typed copy signed by Aziz was
delivered later.
The two-paged letter promised
that Iraq would renew cooperation
with IJ.N. inspectors, but Washing
ton viewed an attached annex as
containing unacceptable conditions,
and it was presented as an ultima
tum of sorts.
Later that night, it took repeated
phone calls to Baghdad to produce
Ambassador Hamdoon's three sep
arate "clarifications" that Iraq's
decision was unconditional —
which finally satisfied the Ameri
cans. and made it official that the air
strike scare was over.
