# Cold War lies uncovered

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Cold
War historians say they now know
more about how and why the Sovi
et Union and China fabricated a
campaign in the 1950s to convince
the world that the United States
used germ and chemical warfare in
the Korean War.
New documentary evidence
from Moscow's still-secret archives
suggests that the charge was insti
gated by Chinese field advisers to
the North Koreans. With many
Koreans dying of cholera, the Chi
nese advisers decided U.S. chemical
and biological warfare must have
been the cause.
"It was a huge campaign, waged
through the press and the World
Peace Council, a Soviet-backed
organization with branches in many
countries," said historian Kathryn
Weathersby, a specialist on the
Soviets' role in the Korean War.
"There were public (anti-U.S.)
demonstrations in most Western
European countries and it compli
cated the early years of NATO
because there were demonstrations
against meetings of the Western
alliance because of those allega
tions."
To make the charge stick, the
communists went to extraordinary
measures — infecting North Kore
ans awaiting execution with plague
and cholera so their bodies could be
shown to outside investigators, and
forcing 25 captured American pilots
to sign "confessions."
The undertaking, blessed by
Josef Stalin and backed by Mao
Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, had
some lingering success. The charge,
denounced by U.S. officials from
President Truman down, was
repeated in a 1989 book by two
British journalists, Peter Williams
and David Wallace, and again in a
1990 ceremony staged by Beijing.
In fact, "neither Soviet officials
nor Russian ones have to this day

ever stated that the Korean War
biological warfare allegations were
false," said biological warfare spe
cialist Milton Leitenberg of the
University of Maryland.
Using newly accessible docu
ments, Leitenberg and Weathersby
put together a now-it-can-be
deduced study of the claim and the
unpublicized decision to back off it.
Their research is to be published in
the Bulletin of the Cold War
International History Project of the
Woodrow Wilson Center, a govern
ment-sponsored think tank.
Leitenberg said the documents
"provide explicit and detailed evi
dence that the charges were con
trived and fraudulent."
The new evidence came from
the Presidential Archives in
Moscow, which is still closed to all
but a handful of Russian
researchers. In January, a
researcher was permitted to make
notes — but not photocopies —
from 12 documents. A Japanese
newspaper, Sankei Shimbun, wrote
about the disclosures and made the
notes available to scholars, an
action which brought about these
recent revelations and has caused
many to question what they former
ly thought to be the truth.
The charge was made in 1952, at
the height of the Korean War and
at a time when North Korea con
fronted massive outbreaks of
cholera and plague.
With an armistice only a few
months away, a secret May 2, 1953
resolution of the presidium of the
Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.
backed away from the charge, the
documents show.
"The Soviet Government and
the Central Committee of the
CPSU (Communist Party of the
Soviet Union) were misled," said
the resolution, which has never
before been made public. "The
spread in the press of information

about the use bv the Americans of
bacteriological weapons in Korea
was based on false information. The
accusations against the Americans
were fictitious."
The instigation for making the
claim apparently came from Chi
nese field commanders advising the
North Koreans, the researchers say,
but this was not made known to
others in the field or to the general
public. In fact, this was kept secret
to prevent the backlash that would
undoubtedly occur.
Soviet advisers already had
raised the possibility with their Chi
nese counterparts. The Chinese
advisers, "not wishing to be guilty
of lack of vigilance ... nervously
concluded that the American
planes that dominated the skies
over North Korea and occasionally
overflew Chinese territory were
responsible for the outbreak of
cholera, plague and other infectious
diseases in early 1952," Ms. Weath
ersbv wrote.
They informed Beijing. Chou
and Mao ordered a laboratory
investigation, but then denounced
the United States, without waiting
for results.
On Feb. 22, 1952, North Korea
told the U.N. that U.S. aircraft had
dropped disease-bearing insects in
seven raids. Two weeks later, Chou
charged the United States had sent
448 aircraft on 68 missions to spread
plague, anthrax, cholera, encephali
tis and meningitis. This, apparently,
was not based on facts', but instead
was fictitiously created.
Even after learning the truth,
Ms. Weathersby wrote, Mao —
eager to maintain revolutionary
zeal at home — "was apparently
unwilling to forfeit the domestic
benefits of charging the United
States with using heinous weapons
against Chinese soldiers, not to
mention the propaganda value
internationally."
