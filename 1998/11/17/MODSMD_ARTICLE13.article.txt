MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP)
A junk dealer went to court Mon
day seeking $50 million from the
government, saying his life was
ruined nine years ago when agents
raided his home and business in a
search for a mail bomber.
Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, 55, said
the federal investigation — stem
ming from the mail-bomb slayings of
a federal judge and a civil rights
lawyer in the South — left him ill.
broke up his marriage and forced
him into bankruptcy.
Walter Leroy Moody of Rex. Ga..
later was convicted in the judge's
murder. He has been sentenced to
death in Alabama's electric chair.
Before Moody was charged,
agents believed a typewriter once

owned by O'Ferrell was used to type
letters and mailing labels linked to
the bombings. The typewriter was
never found and experts later said
the typing did not match.
"When I leave here I want to
know that justice has been done. 1
also want to know that God has been
glorified," O'Ferrell said at the start
of a non-jury trial on his lawsuit.
O'Ferrell claims the FBI lied to
get the search warrants and leaked
information to the media to make
him appear to be the prime suspect.
O'Ferrell originally sued the FBI
and the lead agent in the case, seek
ing compensatory and punitive dam
ages totaling $150 million. But when
U.S. District Judge Harold Albritton
dismissed the agent as a defendant in

the suit on Nov. 2, O'Ferrell reduced
his claim to $50 million in compen
satory damages, said William Gill,
O'Ferreirs attorney.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken
Vines said O'Ferrell was never
arrested or detained.
Vines said the trail led to OTer
rell after the FBI determined that a
"unique typewriter" used to address
the mail bombs was also used in
O'Ferreirs court correspondence in
another case.
Before agents went through
O'Ferreirs belongings, dug up his
septic tank and took samples of his
blood, saliva and hair, they gave him
a lie detector test. That test "reflect
ed that he was being deceptive,"
Vines said.
