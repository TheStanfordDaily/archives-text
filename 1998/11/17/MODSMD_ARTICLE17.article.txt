Marguerite's new evening
routes make it easier and
safer to get off campus

A WEEKEND ADVENTURE off
campus just became both easier
and safer.
Marguerite Midnight Express, a pilot
rQyie running between K p.m. and
2:3CLAj(h I p£ Fridays and Saturdays, will
offer free transportation around campus
and to the Caltrain station. By organizing
this much needed route, the ASSU has
made an important tangible improvement
to student life.
It is hardly a shocking revelation that
Palo Alto is not a stereotypical college
town. Still, more students will now be able
to take advantage of what it has to offer,
such as nice (if somewhat expensive)
meals. We also hope that improved trans
portation will give local establishments an
incentive to remain open later.
Moreover, the new route will help stu
dents who do not own cars take advantage
of San Francisco's night life.
Midnight Express is timed to pick up
the passengers of the last Caltrain from the
city. In short, the ASSU has succeeded in
making attractive weekend entertainment
venues available to more Stanford stu

dents.
While a walk to Palo Alto is not as oner
ous as most folks imagine, it can clearly be
dangerous in the dark. Thanks to the newly
inaugurated late service, some students
will no longer have to choose between
night life and personal safety. Advocacy
for a more secure campus has long been an
ASSU priority, and we are pleased to see
that the new administration is continuing
this tradition.
Enhanced transportation cannot be
effective unless students know how uti
lize it. Many students on campus have
never used the Marguerite. The publicity
campaign was excellent, complete with fly
ers and schedules. A number of students,
including freshmen eager to dine out
before their formal, already used the shut
tle last Friday.
No doubt, Midnight Express did not
come without costs. James Montoya, the
vice provost for student affairs, helped the
ASSU with initial funding for the route. If
this extended service pilot succeeds (and
we are confident that it will), a permanent
source of support will be necessary.
Midnight Express is precisely the sort
of project students want the ASSU to take
on — implementation of tangible and tar
geted enhancements in student services.
Providing safe transportation to desir
able venues is an excellent beginning.
What's the next stop?
