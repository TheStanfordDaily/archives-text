THIRTY YEARS AGO, Stanford
students were smoking marijuana
at a fairly high and consistent rate.
The Stanford Daily reported that a sur
vey of Stern Hail revealed that "nearly
two-thirds of the students had experi
mented with marijuana, but only one
fourth used it often or regularly."
Despite high marijuana use, campus
drug dealers were worried about business
prospects for the coming years. One deal
er was quoted as saying, " 'With Palo
Alto police and Richard Nixon going
where they're going, things will get
rougher.'"
This same dealer, however, was excit
ed about exploiting an emerging drug
market among the fraternities on cam
pus. He insisted that there " 'is a new
market in fraternities. While coeduca
tional dorms have always been better
markets, the frats are really turning on!' "
Students described the Stanford drug
industry as a classical decentralized black
market. One student reported making
several "runs" to Mexico, while another
said he got a "small amount" to sell from
a friend off campus. These same dealers
reported prices of " '$15 a lid (an ounce),
but $10-12 for mediocre stuff.' "
The Daily also compared the Stanford
administration's attitudes towards drug
use to those of other universities. Several
students quoted in the article expressed

the view that Stanford was somewhat of a
"sanctuary" from the police. In fact, two
students who were arrested for marijua
na possession escaped prosecution since
they successfully argued that the police
had no warrant to enter the private
Breakers Eating Club.
In discussing the character of students
who had tried marijuana, the Daily noted
that "the majority of sales were to people
who want to 'try it,' but were not anxious
for large quantities for prolonged use."
While some students were reported to be
"stoned all the time," most users viewed
marijuana as a social drug to be smoked
occasionally with friends.
Stanford drug dealers expressed wor
ries about the future direction of drug use
among Stanford students. A significant
"campus pusher" was quoted as saying,
" 'With a new emphasis here on commu
nity action and less interest in introspec
tion, the hard-core drug users are disap
pearing.' "
" 'There will always be a market for
marijuana's sociable aspects, but as a
stepping stone to further usage, it's all
through,'" he concluded.
In other news, two Cal cheerleaders
were kidnapped by a Stanford student
calling himself "Bert Kempert" over the
weekend. The cheerleaders ended up
having an enjoyable time taking pictures
around the Stanford campus.
