## Inside the mind of a dictator 
### 
Another day,
another conflict.
And finally anoth
er "solution." Some people
get their jollies by hiking
near streams. Others enjoy
a nice day at the ballpark.

Then there are those who
get their kicks by ejecting United Nations
arms inspectors from their country.
As most of you are aware, Saddam Hus
sein's latest exercise in brinkmanship ended
this past weekend. A timely Iraqi letter sent
to the United Nations allowed President
Clinton to abort an ordered attack that
would have reached Iraq within the hour.
The result, after some heavy diplomacy,
leaves a hammer poised directly above Sad
dam's head and a concomitant threat that
any further reneging will bring an immedi
ate and exacting punishment.
The fact is, if it weren't for Pope John
Paul 11, who had been praying for peace the
day before, we would have seen more vio
lence in the Persian Gulf. Saddam simply
can't leave the inspectors alone. In again,
out again, in again, out again
But before we criticize Saddam, we
should really look at the world from his
point of view. Not all of us get the chance to
play dictator. To see how it feels, simply wait
for your resident fellow to get near the front
door, then open it and say "Come in!" Then
immediately slam the door with "Don't
come in!" Repeat this a few times. You'll
see that it's actually quite fun.
More than that, each maneuver gives
Saddam another chance to press for removal
of United Nations sanctions. And almost
without fail, these ploys come with little to

no cost. Until now. Don't do it again, Sad
dam. Unlike the time before and the time
before that, from now on we really mean it.
But a question remains: Is this worth the
trouble? Should we Americans really care if
Saddam has weapons of mass destruction?
Can he ever keep the promise to be a good
Saddam? To bring the issue home, the fol
lowing provide a few parallel examples
using local situations.
Professor Saddam: "Hello, class!"
The class answers, "Hello Saddam! We
love Saddam! Allah! Allah! All I wanna do
is praise Saddam!"
"Thank you, class." Saddam uncocks the
trigger. "Now class. The midterm will be
returned tomorrow."
Nerd, who knows he aced it but wants to
see his grade anyway, is angry. "But you said
we would get the midterm back today!"
"I know I did. I lied. But I won't do it
again. The midterms will be returned tomor
row. And I demand that all homeworks now
be typed and printed on Saddam paper, the
one with my face in the background and the
big smile."
Cal football coach Saddam: "This year
we will win Big Game."
Typical generic and diverse Cal student
responds, "But you said that last year! I even
got in my hippie clothes to yell at the yuppie
Stanford elitist-because-they-wouldn't-let
me-in bastards! And then we lost!"
"Yes, yes, but I have since executed three
of my sons-in-law and hired new coaches so
we will win against the great Cardinal Satan.
It will be a river of blood, the mother of all
battles."
Next Sunday: "I lied. We will win next
year. But I demand new football helmets

with the 'Smilin' Saddam' logo."
Art history major Saddam: 'Hello Dad!"
The "root of all evil" answers, "Hello
Saddam. Are you still an art major?"
"Yes Dad."
"Then I will kill you like I killed your
uncle-in-law, your half-brother-in-law and
your three cousins."
"No, wait! I will change my major imme
diately. I will major in Rape with a minor in
Pillage."
Three years later at graduation: "Sad
dam, what the hell are you going to do with
this?"
B.A. in art history Saddam explains, "I
will teach the infidels art, and when they are
not looking, 1 will rape and pillage! And, uh,
it was a printing error on my diploma. I real
ly majored in Jihad and Crushing the Skull
of the Great American Satan!"
It should now be abundantly obvious that
Saddam cannot keep a promise. Instead of
dealing with his nonsense, it may be better
to remove the sanctions and let Iraq — and
more importantly, the people of Iraq —
finally rebuild their lives. Or is this too
much of a risk? I think so — the threat to
Iraq's neighbors, our oil reserves, and even
Iraqi citizens is sufficient.
But if we are going to insist on rules,
these rules should be enforced, and enforced
with a significant threat to ensure complete
compliance. Or we could just keep Sad
dam's attention occupied long enough to
remove him from power. Anyone have a
shiny nickel?

foil while writing this column. It may show.
