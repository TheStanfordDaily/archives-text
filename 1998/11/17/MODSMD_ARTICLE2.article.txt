# EPA project questioned
## 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Stanford students venturing off of Stanford's palm
lined campus will soon be seeing a new East Palo Alto, if
a current redevelopment project goes as planned. How
ever. the effects that the project will have upon the resi
dents and community of East Palo Alto are controversial
and uncertain.
"There is definitely a dual-edged sword of increased
economic development." said kenith Jones, interim ex
ecutive director of EPA Can Do, a community organi
zation. While developers believe the project will increase
economic activity in East Palo Alto, community leaders
fear it will raise land values and make housing less af
fordable for residents.
According to senior Claudia Aranda, a political sci
ence major, the multi-phased redevelopment project in
cludes plans for lour anchor stores, fast-food restaurants
and housing units.
The project is being built near Highway 101. and de
velopers hope that it will lure shoppers from outlying
areas — and their money — into East Palo Alto. Devel-
opers hope to get a supermarket in
the complex, as East Palo Alto cur
rently lacks one.
However, the project calls for the
destruction of existing housing units.
"The big issue is: Where are peo
ple relocating?" Aranda said. "Many
people are not able to find things
nearby. It is very difficult to relocate."
Calvin Whitaker, director of rent
stabilization for the City of East Palo
Alto agrees. "The impact of redevel
opment on housing will be that In
many cases, we will be losing housing
stock and won't regain them."
"There is tremendous demand
[for housing] and supply has not kept
up," Whitaker said. He predicts that
families looking for new housing will
relocate out of the city. Whitaker said
that by the time replacement housing
is finished, within the mandatory
four-year limit, many families will

have already found permanent hous
ing outside the city.
"No one is forced out of their
home," said Monica Hudson, interim
city manager for East Palo Alto.
"People are compensated for leav
ing, and for many people, this is
something that they would otherwise
never be able to afford."
Residents who have been dislo
cated have been advised by volun
teers from the East Palo Alto Com
munity Law Project.
The EPA Law project is a volun
teer program associated with Stan
ford Law School, according to Kevin
Stein, supervising attorney. Volun
teer students from the Law Project
explained the legal rights of relocated
residents and answered legal ques
tions.
"People have questions about
their rights and how the relocation
process affects them," Stein said.
Jones and other community lead
ers fear that redevelopment will in
crease land and housing prices.

"We are seeing increasing land
and housing prices because of specu
lation by investors." Jones said.
"There is a tightening of housing
units as well as a tightening of selec
tion criteria for housing units. A per
son who... would have qualified [for
a home] probably won't now."
"EPA Can Do is pushing to build
more affordable housing." Jones
said.
Whitaker said that he has not seen
housing prices increase in response to
redevelopment. Prices are increasing
"because of the labor market in gen
eral," he said.
"Redevelopment is also a catalyst
[in increasing housing prices] but a
minor one."
As opposed to the old units, the
new units will most likely not be sub
ject to rent control.
"It may lead to an interesting legal
question," Whitaker said. Replace
ment housing, under current rent
control laws is subject to rent control,
while new housing is not.

With residents potentially forced
to relocate from East Palo Alto, and
with potentially increasing land
prices, some people are concerned
that East Palo Alto will lose a sense of
community.
"The concern that the town may
be gentrified will be looked at as part
of the community plan." Hudson
said.
The community plan, developed
in recent meetings, will incorporate
"community plans and values" said
Manuel Herrera, director of volun
teer services for East Palo Alto."The
plan will answer the question: What
would we like East Palo Alto to be
like in 2(XX) plus?" Herrera said.
"The general plan process will
look at economic and physical devel
opment." said Herrera, "and it will be
written with concern for the unique
value of East Palo Alto."
Herrera expects the plan to go
into effect in the first half of the new
year. "Although, this is not to say
things won't happen along the way."
