Bigotry worsens conflict
We are disappointed that Krishna
Mahesh's hateful, offensive, insensitive,
and, above all, factually incorrect letter,
published on Nov 10, found a place in a
respected forum like the Stanford Daily. It
is unfortunate that the efforts made by the
Pakistanis at Stanford and the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network to initiate a
meaningful discussion on an issue that
could be the cause of a nuclear war are
being met with such bigotry.
Even though the Stanford community is
capable of seeing through Mahesh's irra
tional rhetoric, it is important to point out
Pakistan's stance on the Kashmir issue.
Pakistan supports the just struggle of the
Kashmiris against half a century of Indian
occupation. We hope this support will con
tinue unabated until Kashmiris achieve
what has been promised repeatedly by the
international community. India defies U.N.
Security Council resolutions by continuing
to occupy Kashmir with a million-person
strong military force, and continuing to bru
tally suppress Kashmiris who demand the
right to determine their own destiny.
"Pakistan-trained terrorists" are fig
ments of the imagination of propagandists
intent on discrediting the freedom move
ment in Kashmir. Fighting an occupying
military force is not terrorism. Terrorism is
when military force is unleashed on an
unarmed civilian population, as the Indian
military has done for 50 years.

Kashmir deserves justice
It dismays me that someone should con
strue the talk by Mr. Mirwaiz Farooq, a
spiritual leader and founder of All Parties
Hurriyat conference as a terrorist summon
ing students to participate in terrorism. It
seems to me that the author of the letter did
not actually attend the meeting.
For me the presentation was an eye
opener. Mainstream Indians are largely
ignorant or have overlooked the needs and
plight of the Kashmiri people much too
long. And letters like the one printed on
Nov. 10 are instrumental in further alienat
ing the people of Kashmir from India.
When I say the Kashmiri people, I do
not only refer to the people still in Kashmir
who are undergoing an unimaginable
amount of humiliation and terror. I am also
referring to the people who have lost their
homes and lands and had to flee for their
lives to other parts of the country.
Issues are complicated, and the solutions
evasive. But solutions cannot be found in
slander. Solutions can also not be found in
unending proxy wars. And solutions can
definitely not be found by ignoring the
needs and desires of the people in question.
The problem is about a people who love
their land. For time immemorial, India has
considered Jammu-Kashmir to be her
crown, which makes the people of the land
particularly special. It will be ironic if these
people do not get justice soon.
The Indian people have a 5,000-year-old
history of being tolerant and compassionate
people. I can only request them to bear the
same countenance towards this group and
try to help in any way this situation can be

resolved.

Keller attack unjustified
Wow. That's about the only word that
comes to mind after reading Shegan Camp
bell's rude letter to the Daily last Friday.
Not much in this world is perfect, and
Stanford's libraries are no exception. How
ever, this is no justification for the inexcus
able personal attacks that Campbell made
against Michael Keller, Director of
Libraries. Campbell's attacks aren't the
kind of thing the Electrical Engineering
Department is hoping for from one of its
Ph.D. candidates, and he certainly isn't
casting a good reflection on the depart
ment's students. Yes, as an electrical engi
neering graduate student, Campbell proba
bly can design a better library security sys
tem than Green's non-existent one, but I
doubt that all of Stanford is kneeling in ado
ration of this technical brilliance.
I briefly interacted with Mr. Keller on
Stanford's Committee on Academic Com
puting and Information Systems last year.
However, I am confident that Keller is not
lazy, cheap or trying to offend anyone. He
is concerned with improving Stanford's
facilities and services so students and facul
ty can benefit from expanded resources.
