## Questioning our collective scapegoating

MIKE JAHR WAS 1 1 years old
when Saddam Hussein robbed
him of nearly everything he
owned.
On Aug. 2, 1990. Jahr. now a Stanford
junior majoring in symbolic systems, was
aboard a Kuwaiti Airlines jet to Kuwait
City, where his parents were set to begin
work at the American School of Kuwait.
A few hours before the plane's scheduled
arrival. Hussein's invading forces crossed
the Kuwaiti border. As Iraqi troops took
the capital airport and surface-to-air mis
siles tilled the Middle Eastern skv. the
plane diverted to Bahrain.
The Jahr family escaped unharmed, but
all its possessions save five suitcases
shipped a day earlier as a personal favor to
Mike's father were sei/ed by the Iraqi mil
itary along with most everything in the
small desert kingdom. Mike spent the next
year in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. before mov
ing to Pakistan in 1991.
"Obviously. I have no great love for
Saddam Hussein," he said last week at the
Stanford Center in Paris. Though his fam

ily eventually received compensation from
Iraqi frozen assets, "it can never come
close to replacing what he took from us. It
wasn't the monetary value, it was the per
sonal value."
Though for the most part it doesn't
share Jahr's personal experience, the
American public has no problem hating
Saddam.
The Gulf War of 1991 was watched in
the United States like a TV movie based
on a Tom Clancy book, and we all knew
how it would turn out. We tuned in to
CNN every evening to see the cruise mis
siles pound Baghdad and the tracer bullets
light up the night sky. We knew a few sol
diers. tied yellow ribbons around trees in
their yards and bought Whitney Houston's
Super Bowl recording of "The Star Span
gled Banner" by the millions.
It was a war with few consequences for
most of the nation. There was no draft. No
masses of Americans were flown home in
body hags, and the news was full of
almost-funnv stories of Iraqi brigades sur
rendering to TV film crews. We came

away with a swelled sense of national
pride, low gas prices and. most important
ly. a new national scourge.
Saddam Hussein quickly became
American Public Enemy No. 1 for the '90s.
Alter 50 years of rallying against common
national enemies, lirst the Japanese and
Germans, then the Soviets, the fall of the
Iron Curtain left the United States in the
unknown position of not having anyone to
collectively hate. Saddam solved that, first
by having the nerve to invade a country
with oil and then by intermittently thumb
ing his nose at the U.S. government for the
next half-decade. He was a sore loser and
a pain in the neck, and many Americans
wondered aloud why we didn't just nuke
him back into the Stone Age.
The world picked up on our obsession.
Each time that Iraq threw UNSCOM
nuclear and chemical / biological weapons
inspectors out of the country and the U.S.
began threatening military action, the
international press wondered why Ameri
ca cared so much about Saddam and how
he ran his country. Even last week, when

the entire world seemed to line up behind
a possible American strike in the Gulf,
several French politicians went on TV
questioning U.S. motives.
There is a lot to dislike about Saddam
Hussein. Most notably, he has saerificed
the well-being of his people by his contin
ued efforts to thwart UNSCOM inspec
tors, essentially trading any chance for the
U.S.-led trade embargo to be lifted for his
own dreams of weapons of mass destruc
tion. What bothers the rest of the world is
that Americans seem to detest the man
and the anti-American icon that he has
become without any real mention of his
actions.
Jahr agrees. "Of course he's a scape
goat. It's really distant when you're in the
States," he said. Americans "hate him
because they're led to hate him."
Not that the nation is ignorant of Sad
dam's track record. We just choose not to
focus on it. Why? Because it's easier to
hate Public Enemy No. 1 than to hate the
class of human rights abusers into which
the Iraqi dictator falls. We punish Saddam

for actions which we overlook, or at least
respond less forcibly to, in other parts of
the world.
Americans aren't ready to take on the
role of the world's human rights police
force, especially after the failed peace
effort in Somalia several years ago. At the
same time, our economic interest in the
Middle East is too great to allow a region
al leader who hates the United States to
gain the use of weapons of mass destruc
tion. Focusing our collective hatred on
Saddam Hussein allows us to both justify
that intervention and satisfy our post-Cold
War need for a national enemy.
Mike Jahr doesn't buy that. One of the
few Americans who has seen that
"enemy" in more than just a TV newscast,
he refuses to join the anti-Saddam frenzy.
"I'm ready to move on," he said. "I
wouldn't say I hate him. Hating him isn't
going to do much good."
