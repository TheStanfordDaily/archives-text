MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (16-6)
defeated UC-Davis (3-23), 19-3.

All five Stanford seniors
Chris Aguilera, Layne Beaubien,
David Hay. Arturo Rodelo. and Je
remiah Robison — started and fin
ished their last game at deGuerre
pool together.
"It's been quite a five years for
most of us," said Robison. who
along with all of the seniors except
Rodelo, redshirted his first year at
Stanford.
The game against UC-Davis
"was kind of fun, but it's still kind of
sad that that was it for some of us,"

Rodelo said.
Stanford led the Aggies 5-0 after
one period and 10-0 at halftime.
UC-Davis' first goal of the game
came with 2:20 left on the clock in
the third quarter, which ended with
Stanford leading 17-1. In the fourth
period, the Cardinal scored twice.
UC-Davis retaliated with its sec
ond and final goal, a two-pointer
with 21 seconds remaining.
In an impressive demonstration
of its talented offense, 13 Cardinal
players scored in the match.
Rodelo led the attack, with three
points. Rohison. junior Sean Joy,
sophomore Colin Shaughnessy and
freshman Onno Rodman scored
two a piece. Hay, juniors Brian
Heifferon, Michael Lipinski,
Jonathan Skaalen and Andy Wal
burger, and sophomores Pasi Dut
ton. Glenn Giokaris, and Blake
Mobley each contributed one point.
Giokaris and Mobley's goals were
their first of the season.
"That was probably the most
players I've ever had score in one
game," said Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "I can never,
ever remember having 13

score.
Stanford also had an excellent
defensive game. Aguilera tallied
three saves in the cage during the
first half and in the final 2:30 of the
game, he joined his fellow seniors in
the field and attempted to score his
first goal. But in spite of taking two
great shots, Aguilera was unable to
put one past Aggie goalie Ryan
McLean.
"I'm sad that [Aguilera] didn't
score a goal," Hay said. "Every
body wanted him to score."
After Aguilera left the cage,
Stanford sophomore goalie Arik
Goodman came in and recorded a
career high seven saves in the sec
ond half, representing the future of
the program. Goodman's perfor
mance is especially striking consid
ering the fact that he is currently
suffering from vertigo.
"Arik came in and played well of
the bench," Dettamanti said. "[Due
to the vertigo] he hasn't been prac
ticing much, but he still came in and
made seven saves."
One of the chief advantages of
the UC-Davis game was that many
of the younger players got to see

substantial playing time.
"We got the chance to play a lot
of people who haven't played be
fore," Dettamanti said.
Even though the Aggies were
not the Cardinal's toughest oppo
nents, Stanford continued to play
tough, strong water polo.
According to Dettamanti, "you
have a tendency to play down to

their level [when you're playing a
weaker team.]"
"We tried to play as best we
could," Dettamanti added. "I feel
that if you have the ability to dom
inate a team, you should domi
nate."
Stanford's victory will carry it
into the final game of regular sea
son play. In its next match, Stanford

takes on No. 5 California. Heading
the Cardinal offense will be leading
scorer Heifferon, who has 37 points
on the season, followed by Beaubi
en and Rodelo with 32 and 27 points
respectively. Aguilera, who cur
rently has 182 saves this year, will
head up the defense.
Big Splash begins at 8:30 a.m. at
Diablo Valley College on Saturday.
