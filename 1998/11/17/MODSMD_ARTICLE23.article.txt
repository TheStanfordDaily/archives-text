When the yell leaders chant, "Give 'em the Axe!"
they don't mean that you should literally hand
over Stanford's treasured trophy, the Axe. right then

need to be involved, to wear red and to be proud.
Remember why you came to Stanford. Remember
what it was about this place that made you feel at home.
