When the yell leaders chant, "Give 'em the Axe!"
they don't mean that you should literally hand
over Stanford's treasured trophy, the Axe. right then
and there to the California Bears.
Stanford's football team doesn't give in that easily,
despite its record, and neither should you.
Yes. I am talking to you. the casual reader of the
Stanford Daily.

You are probably in class right now. ignoring some
acclaimed professor.
Yes you. the person most likely snickering at my
cheesy column photo right now. 1 understand your
shock. Usually. I stick to the journalistic norms and
don't address you personally. Well this isn't a normal
week.
Now is your time to step up, my lriend. Now is your
moment to represent.

What time is it? Gametime. Whose house? Your
house. Say it loud, say it proud.
(OK, now sit back down for a minute. Everyone in
your class is staring.)
First, let me state some simple facts â€” Stanford has
not lost a Big Game since 1994. thus Stanford currently
has the Axe. Cal wants the Axe. Cal wants the Axe
badly. Cal could go to a bowl game this season if it beats
the Cardinal. It could bring the Axe if it wanted to.
This is bad.
When you are sitting at home during your winter
break, you don't want to turn on the television and see
those friendly Cal students partying in Hawaii and
making fun of you at their bowl game.
Now, let's discuss your part in all this.
1 am tired of hearing that Cal students are better fans
than Stanford students. No, I am definitely not advo
cating the tearing down of an opponent's goalpost after
that opponent defeats you. What I am saying is you
need to be involved, to wear red and to be proud.
Remember why you came to Stanford. Remember
what it was about this place that made you feel at home.
Need some help remembering? Attend the Big
Game Bonfire Rally on Thursday night.
Let's think of the options here. You could
a) Pretend to be studying, meanwhile checking your

email every two minutes while your
friends are all showing that they have
more sch(x>l spirit than you do.
b) Dance around flickering
flames to the tune of "All Right
Now" after hearing how your Stan
ford forefathers outwitted those
dirty Bears.
It makes you proud to be a Cardi
nal.
Hut even more importantly, what
is the square root of 982,193?
(Just kidding. / jitst wanted to make
sure that you.y ve(e still with me.)
No, really, even more important is
what happens when you leave the
comfort of this nice, protected Farm
and head out into the real world and
onto the streets of Berkeley on Sat
urday.
If somebody yells. "Take off that
red shirt!" simply smile.

Did you ever wonder why all Cal
students love to yell that simple five
word phrase?
Again, we have several options.
a) (Here comes the standard
make-fun-of-Cai joke.) Any phrase
containing more than five words is
too difficult for them to repeat at
football games.
b) They have a secret collection of
red shirts hidden beneath Memorial
Stadium and after each game the Cal
student section races to the pile, puts
on the shirts and parties like it's 1999.
c).Thfey want to intimidate you.
Don't let Don't be intimi
dated. 1 '
Anytime somebody attempts to
intimidate yoik he or she is insulting
Stanford. A/iytime anyone insults
Stanford. 1 take offense. You need to
feel this way too. Stanford is a family.
The*JtuAents are like your brothers
and sisters and the alumni are like
your mother and father.
Don't let them insult your

momma.
I'm not necessarily one for hiss
ing every time the word "Cal" is
mentioned. That seems silly to me.
Hissing never drowned out the
sound of anything. And calling Cal
the "Weenies" makes about as
much sense as calling this campus
"Stanfurd." But 1 arm ope to yell, to
scream and to hold my head'up high
as 1 enter Cat's campus to watch
Stanford's 2-8 squad battle the '5-5
Bears. I am one to say that I don't
want k a singly Bear fan to enter the
Stanford student section. /
The 101st ,Big Game will be a
good game. Big Games always are.
But you need to do part. Help
keep the Axe on the Farm.
Are you still there?
J u i 1 L.

Sports editor Brian'Euk ', whose week
ly columns appear An Tuesdays,
hopes his friends at Cal aren 't bitter
when they realize that records don't
matter in this game.
