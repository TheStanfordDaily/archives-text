### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
For the second year in a row, the
No. 9 Stanford men's soccer team
(14-4-2) was awarded the opportuni
ty to make a run at a national cham
pionship.
The 1998 Division 1 men's brack
ets were announced last night and the
Cardinal was awarded a home game
with a first round match against un
ranked San Jose State (14-5-1). Sat
urday night will be the first time Stan
ford hosts an NCAA tournament
game.
"It is great to be back in the tour
nament two years in a row," said
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark.
The selection show seemed to last
an eternity as the Cardinal's position
was not announced until the final seg
ment of the presentation. As tension
built, team members kept convincing
each other that they would indeed re
ceive a berth.
"For a second, when I started to
see all the West Coast teams, I was
getting a little worried," said redshirt

sophomore goalie Adam Zapala.
The team erupted in applause
when its berth was announced.
"We are really excited," said se
nior captain A.J. Sauer. "We think
we got a well deserved home bid. It
will be gcx>d to play San Jose State,
especially because we all remember
how we felt when we lost to them
early in the season."
The Spartans and Cardinal faced
off in Stanford's third game of the
season, when San Jose State upset
the Cardinal its only home loss this
year, a 2-1 defeat. The Spartans went
on to win the first nine games of their
season.
Stanford has gone undefeated in
its seven home games since that early
season loss.
"We have played them. We know
them. We want them. It is sweet re
venge," said senior midfielder Shan
Gaw.
The West Coast posted a very
strong showing receiving eight of the
32 bids.
Despite finishing fourth in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation,

the Cardinal received an at-large bid
to the field of 32 due to its solid record
and tough schedule. Of the teams
which made the tournament, 16 re
ceived automatic bids as conference
champions and another 16 were se
lected at large.
During the season, Stanford tal
lied a 5-2-1 record against teams
named to the tournament.

tionally names
then places the remaining teams ac
cording to region.
Stanford faced four of the top
eight seeds during the regular season,
and went 2-1-1. The two wins were a
2-1 overtime victory versus No. 4
seed Washington and a 1 -0 topping of
No. 5 seed St. John's. Stanford also
tied No. 7 seed Cal State Fullerton 1-
1. and lost a 1-0 battle against No. 6
seed UCLA. The defending NCAA
champion Bruins, along with Wash
ington and Fullerton are all members
oftheMPSF.
The Cardinal has never made it
past the first round of the tournament
in its previous five appearances.
