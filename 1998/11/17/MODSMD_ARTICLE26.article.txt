WRESTLING
■ Saturday: Stanford had eight place
winners at the California Open.

Since it was an open tournament,
no team scores are kept. Only indi
vidual placers are recorded. This for
mat allows for redshirt freshmen to
get experience without using a year
of eligibility.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
was junior captain Zach Zinimerer,
who finished first overall in the 133-
pound weight class. Zinimerer won
the championship match with a deci
sive 14-6 win.
Warren McPherson also had an
impressive tournament placing third
in the 165-pound class. His only loss
came in a hard-fought battle in the
semifinals which left him on the short
end of a 4-2 decision. McPherson
then went on to win. 9-4, in the third
place match.
Stanford head coach Chris Hor
pel was impressed by both wrestlers'
performances.

"Zach Zimmerer was on fire,"
Horpel said. "He dominated his
weight class with amazing throws as
well as good basic wrestling. Warren
McPherson also looked impressive. I
think his one loss, which was in the
semifinals in overtime, will go the
other way next time."
Other wrestlers also had good
performances for the Cardinal.
Shane Cross (174 lbs.) finished the
day with a 5-2 record and brought
home fourth place. He posted two
pins of 2:37 and 6:58 leading up to the
quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, he
lost 8-1. but fought back to the con
solation finals. In his final match, he
lost a 6-0 decision.
In the lower weights, junior Rudy
Ruiz (125) joined Zimmerer on the
winner's podium, posting a fifth
place finish and a 4-2 record on the
day. After winning his first match 10-
7. he lost in the quarterfinals. 8-2. He
rebounded to win his next two
matches, losing in the consolation
semifinals and then winning his fifth
place match 8-6.
The team had many close match
es but maintained its poise through
out the tournament.
"I was impressed with our condi
tioning in the early going," Horpel
said. "We won countless matches in
the last 30 seconds, which is a great
sign. Our technique looked good too,
although our younger athletes need
to catch up some."
The middle weights had strong
performances by senior captain Beau
Weiner (157) and junior Frank Ruiz
(149), along with McPherson. Wein
er placed fifth and was 3-2 on the day.
Ruiz also came out with a fifth
place finish and a 5-2 record. After
losing his first round match, Ruiz bat
tled back to win the next four match
es before losing again in the consola
tion semifinals and collecting a fifth
place from a forfeit.,
Most surprising in the middle
weights was senior Clay Hackerman
(165). Hackerman, who was not pro
jected to be in the starting lineup by
Horpel. placed fifth behind McPher
son. After winning his first two
matches, he lost a heartbreaker in the

quarterfinals, 3-1. Upon reaching the
consolation semifinals after two
strong wins, Hackerman lost to
McPherson, 3-1, and then proceeded
to take fifth place.
Hackerman exemplified the spirit
of this year's team.
"As a whole, I was very proud of
the heart with which they competed,"
Horpel said.
The upper weights had more trou
ble in terms of place winners. These
weights are more inexperienced and
have a lot of freshmen trying to fill the
roles of last year's departing seniors.
Leading the way was Tim Kendall
(184), who placed fifth and finished
with a 4-2 record. After winning his
first match 9-3, he lost a close semifi
nal match, 8-6. Kendall rallied to win
his next two' before dropping 7-3 in
the consolation semifinals and even
tually taking fifth place.
After Kendall, the team had a
slight letdown in the heavier weights.
The team failed to place in the 197

and heavyweight divisions, along
with the 141-pound class. This
showed some of the weak spots on
the team and will need to be ad
dressed.
"The tournament pointed out
which of our weights need a little
help," Horpel said. "Weight divisions
141, 197 and 285 [heavyweight] all
need to get a little better and start
placing in these open tournaments."
Overall, the team had a strong
showing and leaves the tournament
optimistic for the upcoming dual
schedule and future tournaments.
With eight place winners, the Cardi
nal has higher expectations for future
performances by these wrestlers —
the wrestlers who will be the founda
tion for the team and leaders for the
younger competitors.
"The team continues to have great
team chemistry and is improving
rapidly.
The next Stanford dual wrestling
meet is on Nov. 24 at S.F State.
