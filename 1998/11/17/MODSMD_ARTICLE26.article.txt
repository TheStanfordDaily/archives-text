WRESTLING
â–  Saturday: Stanford had eight place
winners at the California Open.

Since it was an open tournament,
no team scores are kept. Only indi
vidual placers are recorded. This for
mat allows for redshirt freshmen to
get experience without using a year
of eligibility.
Leading the way for the Cardinal
was junior captain Zach Zinimerer,
who finished first overall in the 133-
pound weight class. Zinimerer won
the championship match with a deci
sive 14-6 win.
Warren McPherson also had an
impressive tournament placing third
in the 165-pound class. His only loss
came in a hard-fought battle in the
semifinals which left him on the short
end of a 4-2 decision. McPherson
then went on to win. 9-4, in the third
place match.
Stanford head coach Chris Hor
pel was impressed by both wrestlers'
performances.

"Zach Zimmerer was on fire,"
Horpel said. "He dominated his
weight class with amazing throws as
well as good basic wrestling. Warren
McPherson also looked impressive. I
think his one loss, which was in the
semifinals in overtime, will go the
other way next time."
Other wrestlers also had good
performances for the Cardinal.
Shane Cross (174 lbs.) finished the
day with a 5-2 record and brought
home fourth place. He posted two
pins of 2:37 and 6:58 leading up to the
quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, he
lost 8-1. but fought back to the con
solation finals. In his final match, he
lost a 6-0 decision.
In the lower weights, junior Rudy
Ruiz (125) joined Zimmerer on the
winner's podium, posting a fifth
place finish and a 4-2 record on the
day. After winning his first match 10-
7. he lost in the quarterfinals. 8-2. He
rebounded to win his next two
matches, losing in the consolation
semifinals and then winning his fifth
place match 8-6.
The team had many close match
es but maintained its poise through
out the tournament.
"I was impressed with our condi
tioning in the early going," Horpel
said. "We won countless matches in
the last 30 seconds, which is a great
