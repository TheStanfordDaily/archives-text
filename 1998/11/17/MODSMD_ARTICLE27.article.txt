# Tough training
## Students get rescue experience with San Mateo County Sheriff 
### Danielle Chang 
Equipped with N) pounds of div
ing gear, Ryan Schaper and Ben
jamin Welle hung over the 1,2(X)-foot
cliff on a rope no thicker than a nick
el's diameter. I hey descended to the
ocean below in search of a pistol, a
weapon used in a murder case that is
currently on trial.
This is not "( lilfhanger," hut the
real life workings of the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Volunteer Diver/
C lift Rescue Team.
Schaper, a junior and member of
the Reserve Officer Training Corp.
Navy unit, and fellow junior Ben
jamin R. Welle recently received
their rescue team badges from the
sheriff's office after completing their
training this summer.
While they both joined the team
for its excitement, its spirit of team
work, and the down-to-earth person
alities of their teammates, Schaper
gets an additional bonus in that the
training contributes to Ins required
four-year stint in the Navy after his
graduation.
The team covers coastline stretch
ing from Ano Nuevo State Park to
Pacifica and lower San Francisco. Be
cause the ( oast (iuard does not dive,
team members are called on to help
in search-and-rescue operations.
Although the team is staffed on ;i
volunteer basis, participants have
many hoops to jump through before
qualifying.
"To qualify for the team, you have

to be certified with scuba diving and
have advance over-water certifica
tion and rescue certification." said
San Mateo ( ounty Sgt. Steve Shivelv
of the rescue team. "After attending
several general meetings, the volun
teers are then put through l(X)-plus
hours of rescue course," he said.
The individuals are then sworn in
and receive a palm-sized star-shaped
badge.
"The training is very rigorous, we
worked 30 to4o hours a week, and on
weekends from S a.m. to 6 p.m.." said
Welle. "It's difficult because it's hot
over the summer and we have to
strap the bodies [of teammates or
dummies] on ourselves to bring them
up [the cliff]."
Every month the team members
are required to attend one general
meeting, one eight-hour training ses
sion and work one eight-hour patrol.
In addition, the volunteers must have
quick response time to reply to calls
from the rescue dispatchers at any
time.
It seems a demanding job to take
on, considering that Schaper and
Welle both have the academic de
mands ol Stanford. ;i social life ;it
their Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house and the daily two-hour work
out they do on their own to keep up
with the team.
"We really like doing it. some
times we sacrifice things and some
weekends." said Welle. "We learned
to budget our time really efficiently."
Schaper added that, "We make

time for it. it's important to us. I stay
focused on my goal and try to balance
it where I get everything done."
Sehaperand Welle fell in love with
the ocean at a very young age and
have experimented with surfing,
bungee-jumping, sky-diving, diving
with 110 equipment and cliff-diving
using a rope to get down to the ocean
surface.
"With the type of activity that I
like to do, some risks always come
with them," said Welle. "But they are
all calculated risks."
Schaper grew up in Salinas, a city
located about 70 miles south of Stan
lord. Since the beach is only 15 min
utes from home, Schaper spent "lots
of time 011 the beach and with water."
"I free dove a lot every time I went
to the beach," recalled Schaper.
"And finally my parents let me take a
scuba diving course when I was in
high school."
Welle was born in Winona, Minn,
and learned to dive only five years
ago. "We live nowhere near the
ocean, but we have lots of lakes," said
Welle. "I dove in extremely cold
water with 110 visibility."
Welle grew up watching the Dis
covery Channel and fell in love with
sharks and water. After graduating
Irom high school, Welle lived abroad
for a year in Spain and Costa Rica,
where he "spent a lot of time on the
coast" and realized that he "needs to
spend the rest of [his] life near the
beach." I his desire to be close to the
ocean is hardly a surprise given that

"aqua" was his first spoken word.
Diving is like visiting a foreign
country to Schaper and Welle, espe
cially if it's a diving spot no one else
has yet tampered with. "We used cliff
equipment and ropes to go down to
places no one has seen," said
Schaper. "[lt] adds a lot to your dive
when you know no one's ever been
there."
Welle expressed similar opinions,
"I got to see a world no one else has
seen; everything is just so tranquil."
"I forget about everything above
the water, the surface level of life," he
added. "It's so comfortable under the
water, [you have] the freedom to go
where you want."
This freedom and disconnection
with the world around and above is
best achieved through night diving,
according to them.
"Night diving is the best," said
Schaper. "I like to turn my light off
and just float, with no sense of up and
down."
Welle reiterated the joy of this es
cape from the real world. "All you
hear is the bubbles coming out of
your regulator, you don't know
what's around you."
For Schaper and Welle, joining
the rescue team is an opportunity to
do something they like and to help
others at the same time. Although it is
not required, they are both continu
ing to gain skills to help the team â€”
both are working on becoming diving
instructors and emergency medical
technicians by end of the year.
