### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Gwendolyn Dean, director of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, announced Friday her
resignation, effective Nov. 25. She held the position
for less than four months.
Dean informed administrators and sent an e-mail
to students stating she would be accepting a similar,
full-time position at Cornell University.
Dean of Students Marc Wais called the situation
"highly unusual."
"My sense, in speaking with her, was that she got a
wonderful job opportunity she couldn't refuse," said
Wais.
He said that while he was aware Dean was consid
ering other job opportunities before accepting the
Stanford position, he assumed that once she accepted
the position she was no longer considering other of
fers.
Assoc. Dean of Religious Life Maurice Charles,
who headed the search committee that recommended
Dean for the position last spring said he "will be con
centrating on helping the LGBQT community work
through the inevitable grief that accompanies the loss
of a significant community leader."
Dean, who could not be reached for this story, will
explain her reasons for leaving to a gathering of stu
dents at a closed meeting today.
"What I hope to gain at the meeting is ideas of

Gwendolyn Dean, recently appointed director of the LGBCC, is stepping down to return to Cornell Univer
sity.
where to go from here," said Zack
Allen, a first year master's student
in Latin American studies who
considers himself on "friendly
terms" with Dean.
"I think its going to be interest
ing during the next few weeks,"
said Allen, explaining there would
be some "soul-searching as to what
we want in the directorship posi
tion."
Wais said that the University
will immediately begin a process to
hire a new director for the
LGBCC.
"The process will move quickly
and will be conducted in direct con
sultation with members of the
LOB community," said Wais.
Wais said that while the direc
torship has been established as a
half-time position, other Universi
ty employment opportunities, in
addition to the directorship posi
tion, could become available to
qualified applicants.
Prior to Dean's hire, the LGBCC
was the only community center
without a director. Students submit
ted a proposal for a full-time direc

tor, hut the University only allocat
ed funds for a half-time director.
Dean was employed in another
half-time position as a program ad
visor in the Office of Student Ac
tivities in addition to her post at the
LGBCC.
Allen indicated that Dean had
expressed displeasure at her work
ing conditions while at Stanford.
"She voiced to me ... that it's
hard to do a quality job with inade
quate funding at a half-time posi
tion." said Allen, adding that find
ing suitable housing was also a con
cern for Dean.
"I think its really unfortunate
that she's decided to leave at this
point in time," he added.
Wais responded to the housing
issue by saying the University rec
ognized the economic difficulty of
people moving to the area and of
fers resources to staff members
searching for housing.
He pointed out that the search
for the directorship position was
originally a regional one, only be
coming national after it was adver
tised on line.
Wais said that it is the Universi
ty's intention to name an interim
director until a permanent director
is hired.
