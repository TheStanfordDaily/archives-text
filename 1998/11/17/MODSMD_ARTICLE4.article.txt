# Archaeology club changes objectives
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
Triggered by the split in the Anthropology
Department last spring, the student-run Stan
ford Archaeology Association is changing its
objectives to accommodate the growing in
terdisciplinary nature of archaeology.
The association met for the first time this
year last night. More than SO faculty and stu
dents attended the meeting, including Assoc.
Anthropology Prof. John Rick, Geophysics
Prof. Amos Nur. and other campus archaeol
ogists.
The study of archaeology is experiencing a
resurgence at Stanford. Although Rick be
lieves archaeology has always held an impor

tant place at Stanford, the University has just
recently added new faculty members and im
plemented programs to expand the study of
archaeology to various departments.
There has been enormous growth in ar
chaeology as a field of study as well.
"There were times when 1 was the only ar
chaeologist on campus," Rick said.
"Now. there are many archaeologists on
campus who work in departments that span a
variety of disciplines."
Students can pursue archaeology through
many departments on campus, including ge
ology, geophysics and classics.
The integration of archaeology into these
departments sterns in part from the split of
the Anthropology Department
into anthropological sciences and
social and cultural anthropology.
"It is important for any student of
archaeology to be exposed to all of
these fields in order to understand
the breadth of it all," said junior
Naomi Levin, who is majoring in
both anthropological sciences and
geology.
Nur, also the chair of the Geo
physics Department, is an archae
ologist.
He said he feels that it is best
not to confine archaeology to only
one department.
"I couldn't move from geo
physics to archaeology," he said.
"There are so many applications of
geophysics to archaeology that are
natural to any interdisciplinary
study."
Budding undergraduate ar
chaeologists have found it difficult
to collaborate and find other stu
dents and faculty with similar in
terests without a specific depart
ment.
The association helps students
bridge gaps among departments.
The increased involvement of
undergraduates on campus in ar
chaeology has been beneficial not
only for those who wish to study
the discipline, but also for the fac
ulty on campus.
"Student support of archaeolo
gy is especially important for the
University and faculty because it
gets people together who are like
minded," Levin said.
"Otherwise, the faculty don't

really have a means of communi
cating."
Rick concurs. "It is so fantastic
when students pull together, be
cause it allows the faculty to come
together. "Student energy capital
izes on the additional energy they
can put forth and renews our own
energy."
Nur agreed that "the active in
terest that students show puts a fire
under the faculty to do some
thing."
Faculty want to help students
better define their interests.
One goal of the association is to
allow students and faculty to meet
and discuss various ideas and to
work with each other more closely.
"Some students may be inter
ested in excavation, others in dif
ferent locations all over the globe,
some in historical writing. Whatev
er their interests, we will try to tai
lor a program to each students' in
terests," Nur said.
Sophomore Meagan Eagle, a
geology major, said she appreci
ates the interdisciplinary nature of
archaeology.
"It is great to have an interde
partmental approach to archaeolo
gy because it seems like many
times in the academic world, self
centric spheres evolve, encompass
ing each department."
Rick added that "The Universi
ty was founded on archaeology. If
you had asked little Leland [Stan
ford Jr.] what he was interested in,
you would have realized he was a
budding archaeologist."
The Anthropology Department
split last spring due to academic
differences between advocates of
different styles of anthropology.
