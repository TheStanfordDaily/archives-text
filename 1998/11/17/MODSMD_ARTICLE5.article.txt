# Concern over biological, chemical weapons grows
## 
### Joanne Wu Contribution writer 
Although most Americans are
blissfully unaware of the problem, bi
ological and chemical weapons re
main a major threat to our nation. To
discuss the issue, the I loovcr Institu
tion Conference on Biological and
Chemical Weapons assembled a
spectrum of experts from scientific,
political and medical backgrounds.
Last night. Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency George Tenet
was scheduled to speak on the role of
the intelligence in protecting against
biological and chemical weapons.
However, further emphasizing the
serious danger of biological and
chemical weapons. Tenet was forced
to stay in Washington, D.C. to help
deal with the crisis of Iraq's noncom
pliance with United Nations
weapons inspectors.
John Gannon, chair of the Na
tional Intelligence Council, spoke at
the Faculty Club in Tenet's place.
"We recognize that biological and
chemical weapons are not just a
wartime concern, but a clear and pre
sent danger for us at home and
abroad. America's prestige and high
profile as a global power make us the
world's biggest and most dispersed
target," said Gannon.
Many countries have now at
tained the capacity to build biological
and chemical weapons, and many
others are actively pursuing the tech
nology. "These countries see biologi

cal and chemical weapons as the best
means to counter overwhelming U.S.
conventional military superiority."
explained Gannon.
America also faces the threat of
growing numbers of terrorist groups
with biological and chemical
weapons capabilities. "Many such
groups, like Osama bin Laden's,
have international networks," said
Gannon. "That adds to uncertainty
and the danger of a surprise attack."
Weapons, along with methods of
implementing them, are growing
more potent.
"Rapid advances in biotechnolo
gy will yield new toxins or live agents
... that will require new detection
methods and vaccines as well as other
preventative measures," said Gan
non. "Meanwhile, we are worried
that several countries of concern will
weaponize biological and chemical
warheads for ballistic missiles."
Because biological and chemical
weapons pose such a major danger to
America, the CIA is maximizing its
efforts to protect the nation.
"Intelligence is all about ascer
taining the capabilities — and even
more important — the intentions of
one's adversaries," said Gannon.
But the United States cannot
solve the world wide problem of bio
logical and chemical weapons prolif
eration on its own. "We need to rein
force the message that non-prolifera
tion efforts do not benefit the I Jnited
States alone —they benefit everyone
on the planet Earth."
