# Bookstore wins pricing battle
## 
### Julie Chai Contributing writer 
The Stanford Bookstore was part
of a legal victory last Wednesday in a
price-discrimination lawsuit against
a major university publisher.
Cambridge University Press
agreed in federal court in New York
City to modify its pricing discount
policies, making the same discounts
available to all retailers. This agree
ment ended a lawsuit filed last July
by the National Association of Col
lege Stores, of which Stanford Book
store is a member.
Cambridge Press, which main
tains an office on campus, had a dual
pricing system, with one price scale
for trade bookstores such as Crown
Books and Barnes & Noble, and an
other for university bookstores.
Cambridge Press has traditionally
charged more to college bookstores

than trade bookstores for texts used
predominantly in classrooms, ac
cording to Marc Fleischaker, general
counsel for the association.
The association said it was unfair
that trade bookstores were able to
purchase professional, academic and
course-related books for greater dis
counts than campus bookstores be
cause trade bookstores could then
offer the titles for a lower price.
"Its a legitimate concern of col
lege bookstores that someone's un
dercutting them in price," said John
Zotz, deputy director of finance and
operations for Stanford University
Press.
Publishers' practice of maintain
ing a dual discount system is not new,
according to Peggy Mendelson, pres
ident of the Stanford Bookstore.
College bookstores essentially

have a built-in market lor aeailemic
texts since many of these books are
required for classes. Trade stores,
however, generally have a smaller
market for the more specialized
texts, so publishers would offer a
greater discount on academic books
as an incentive for the trade stores to
carry them.
It is unlikely that Cambridge's re
vised policy will affect the price of
books at Stanford Bookstore.
"My speculation is that textbook
price* won't change." said Mendel
son. "|( ambridge's policy modifica
tion! w '" simply eliminate the dis
count from trade. Our policy is to Irv
to keep the prices the same."
Because trade bookstores will not
receive as great a discount as in the
past, the new policy may mean lower
profits for books sold in the trade sec
tion of the bookstore and, as a result,
influence which titles arc offered.
"We will not raise prices, but we'll

look very carefully at the books sold
in trade," said Mendelson.
"We have to decide carefully if it's
a book our customers want, and if it
is, we'll continue to carry it."
Cambridge plans to implement
the new policy by April IW.
Alan Harvey, manager of the
Cambridge University Press office
on Stanford campus, declined to
comment on the settlement.
Stanford University Press, whose
largest market is on the Hast Coast,
currently has a dual pricing system. It
uses Cambridge University Press as a
major distribution vendor.
"Most non-university presses
have changed [their dual discount
policies), but it's still a big problem
with university presses," said Fleis
ehakef. "We're hoping that Cam
bridge will encourage other universi
ty presses to change.
/ot/said that Stanford I 'diversity
Press is considering changing its pric
ing policy as well.
"We'll probably make (the dis
count system| simpler before the
year ends." said Zotz.
