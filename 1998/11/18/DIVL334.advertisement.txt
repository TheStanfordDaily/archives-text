Do you participate in the Stanford
Dependent Care Spending Account Program?
Is your salary over $80,000 per year?
Are your 1998 benefits being cut because you are a "Highly Compensated Employee"?
You should be aware that if your spouse earns less than $80K a year, there may be
an advantage to you to have your spouse, rather than you yourself, contribute to your
family's Dependent Care Spending Account for 1999. The annual family maximum
contribution is $4992 per year, but spouses may divide this contribution between them
if both of their employers offer participation in Dependent Care Spending Accounts.
Stanford Employees should contact their Benefits Counselor if they have questions.
Counselor names and phone numbers are listed in the Open Enrollment materials you
have received. Remember that all changes to benefit enrollment, AND ALL
ENROLLMENT IN DEPENDENT CARE SPENDING ACCOUNTS FOR 1999,
must be completed by midnight, Sunday, November 22.
Paid for by a concerned Stanford faculty member, and not by Stanford University.

Application materials for the 1998-99
Beinecke Brothers Memorial Scholarships
are now available.
The Beinecke Memorial Scholarship Program offers scholarships to juniors who have demonstrat
ed unusual ability in fields of study they are eager to pursue at the graduate level. The award consists
of an initial grant of $2,000 to be used at the student's discretion in support of the graduate school
application process; followed by a $15,000 stipend during each of the first two years of graduate study.
Nominees should exemplify superior standards of intellectual ability, scholastic achievement and
personal promise. In addition, preference will be given to those candidates:
1 • for whom the awarding of a Beinecke Scholarship would significantly enhance the
likelihood of the student attending graduate school;
2* who are planning to attend graduate school in the arts, humanities, or social sciences;
3 • with demonstrated financial need (i.e., a history of receiving financial aid).
Application materials are available from Jod.i Berardino in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education, Building One, Room 208. Jodi may be
reached for questions at 723-0402 or jodib("leland.
Application materials are due by noon on Friday, February 19, 1999.
