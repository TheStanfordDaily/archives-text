### Betsy Carroll Contributing writer 
David Ross, the new director of the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. spoke last night on the role of art museums in the age
of the Internet.
In his lecture, titled "Between Paradigms: The Art Museum Ver
sus the Digital Age," Ross focused on how museums can maintain
their relevance in an era when artwork can be made available to any
one who is connected to the Internet. He argued that modern muse
ums are fully capable of complementing this trend toward electron
ic art.
Before an audience of 80 people in Annenberg Auditorium. Ross
emphasized the need for museums to recognize Internet art as a valid
medium.
"The artist is not living ahead of their time," Ross said. "The artist
is living in their time. We're the ones who are 15 years behind."
In this vein, Ross said that modern art museums are trying to keep
up with the digital art movement
"The art museum has come to represent forces of conservatism.
Nothing could be farther from the truth,"he said.
Prior to his appointment as the museum's director in June. Ross
served as the director the Whitney Museum in New York City from
1991 to 1998.
He is known as a scholar in the field of video art. a medium that
was controversial in the late 19705.
Ross also said that "the art museum is searching for a future" with
respect to digital art.
An exhibit exploring the connection among art museums, pris
ons. MIT and other universities is currently showing at the museum.
The exhibit is largely Internet-based, with online links that manage
to connect all three types of institutions.
Most audience members seemed pleased by Ross' interest in In
ternet art.
"I think it's great that we have a curator so interested in electron

ic media," said Asst. Art Prof. Enrique Chagoya. "David Ross' lec
tin w was very eloquent on the role of the MOM A in supporting
what's really happening today."
"1 think it's definitely a valid art form." said Peter Thiede, a fresh
man. "Net art is one avenue that is stretching what we include as art."
