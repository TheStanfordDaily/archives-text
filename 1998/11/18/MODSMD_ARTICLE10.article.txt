## Greenspan cuts rates again 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The
Federal Reserve today reduced
short-term interest rates by one
quarter percentage point, acting for
the third time in seven weeks to
inoculate the U.S. economy against
spillover from world financial tur
moil.
The central bank's monetary pol
icy panel voted to move the bench
mark federal funds rate, charged on
overnight loans between banks, to
4.75 percent, from 5 percent. It
announced the change at the conclu
sion of a closed-door meeting.
"Although conditions in financial
markets have settled down material

ly since mid-October, unusual strains
remain," the central bank said in a
statement.
Wall Street reacted immediately.
The Dow Jones average of industrial
stocks shot up after being down 60
points just before the announce
ment. An hour later, it was up about
75 points at 9,090.
Major American banks, including
BankAmerica and Chase Manhat
tan. responded by cutting their
prime lending rates a quarter point
to 7.75 percent. The prime serves as
a benchmark for a variety of con
sumer and business loans..
The Federal Reserve reduced its

largely symbolic discount rate, which
it charges on its own loans, by a
quarter point, to 4.5 percent.
However, signaling that the next
cut will not he automatic, it said with
today's cut, "financial conditions can
reasonably be expected to be consis
tent with fostering sustained eco
nomic expansion while keeping
inflationary pressures subdued."
The federal funds rate reduction,
to the lowest level in four years, was
the third since Sept. 29, when the
Fed cut rates for the first time in
three years. That action was aimed
at calming gyrating markets on Wall
Street and preventing the U.S. econ

omy from lapsing into recession in
reaction to financial turmoil that
struck first in Asia, spread to Russia
and then threatened Latin America.
The first cut wasn't enough to
calm Wall Street, and banks began
pulling back from business lending.
So. in a surprise move, the Fed cut
rates again Oct. 15.
That touched off a nearly 1,500-
point rebound in the Dow average
and economists had begun to specu
late that at today's meeting Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan would
defer a further rate cut until further
evidence of deterioration in the U.S.
economy.
