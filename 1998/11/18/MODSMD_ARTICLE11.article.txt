I .AS VEGAS (AP) â€”Basket-
ball hiid boy Dennis Rodman is mar
ried. Really.
Rodman confirmed Tuesday that
he tied the knot with ex-"Bavwatch"
actress Carmen Electra.
"I love Carmen and am proud to
be married to her," Rodman said in
a statement issued Tuesday through
his publicist.
The two got married in Las
Vegas t>n Saturday, but Rodman's
agent questioned whether the mar
riage was legal, saying the Chicago
Bulls star was drunk at the time.
"Obviously anyone that would
marry somebody that w;is intoxicat
ed to the point that they couldn't

speak or stand had ulterior motives
of some sort," Rodman's agent,
Dwight Manley, told The Associat
ed Press on Monday.
Manley said Rodman, 37, was
taken advantage of by Electra and
people he called "leeches."
But Rodman said he was in love
and apologized "for any false state
ments given on my behalf regarding
my marriage to Carmen Electra."
After getting a marriage license
Saturday morning, the two
exchanged vows at A Little Chapel
of the Flowers on the Las Vegas
Strip.
Rodman and Electra, 26. have
been dating since the spring.
