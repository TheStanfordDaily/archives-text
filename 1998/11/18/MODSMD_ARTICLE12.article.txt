Despite a careful search,
Tresiddefs newest vendor
won't meet student needs

WE STRONGLY FEEL that the
recent decision to fill the vacan
cy in Tresidder Union with a
travel agency is a mistake, considering the
wide variety of other options that would
have better suited students' daily needs.

On campus, Tresidder is the only place
with restaurants, banks, a mini-mart and
other necessities. Since such basic needs
are served exclusively by Tresidder, a first
class student union is essential. With the
scarcity of space in Tresidder for commer
cial stores, such decisions must be carefully
considered to maximize student and com
munity benefit. Although a travel agency is
a nice convenience, it is far from being the
best choice.
As Dean of Students Mare Wais cau
tions. however, this decision should not be
so abruptly dismissed. According to Wais,
the Tresidder Advisory Hoard, which is
composed of members from various parts
of the Stanford community, decided upon
the travel agency recommendation based
on three primary considerations.
First, "space was a major concern when
we considered placing a Hloekbuster [video
store) or lower satellite [music store],"
said Wais. It was deemed unfeasible to
place stores like those in the approximate
ly I,(XX(-square-foot space available. Sec
ondly, Wais explained, "The second-floor
space simply can't provide sufficient 'peo
ple-traffic' and many vendors depend on
high volume." The last reason he cited is
that "many vendors cannot pay the rent."
Lowering rent is not feasible, Wais indicat
ed, because Tresidder needs to be self-suf
ficient and pay for its own operating costs.
Perhaps this heavy emphasis on meeting
financial goals is where the problem lies.
Wais mentioned that alternatives to the

travel agency included a clothing store, a
flower shop, a mini-mall with cards and
gilts, a dentist and an optometrist. Taking
space constraints and the current minimal
foot traffic on the second floor into consid
eration, it still seems like contracting sever
al of these vendors was feasible.
If a travel agency is the only vendor able
to afford a Tresidder office, the University
should consider re-pricing its rent. It is
more important to serve community inter
ests by providing vital services than to
imprudently add vendors because they are
able to pay the rent. Stanford Management
Co., which is responsible for the contract
negotiations with potential Tresidder ven
dors. needs to place the interests of the
community above financial concerns.
Additionally, the rent cut may only need
to be temporary. Popular vendors paying
lower rents will increase second-floor traf
fic. allowing the management company to
charge higher rents to incoming vendors.
In regards to adding another restaurant,
Wais said "We are concerned for our cur
rent food vendors ... [and] we don't want
to damage the existing customer base." An
additional restaurant will not diminish but
expand the current Tresidder customer
base. New eating options would also
increase student traffic at Tresidder. Com
pared to its counterpart at other universi
ties, such as IJC-San Diego's Price Center.
Tresidder has a significantly smaller selec
tion of dining options.
Commendably, many of the alternatives
that Wais and the Tresidder Advisory
Hoard explored were culled from surveys
done over the past three years, according
to Wais. Although such a comprehensive
exploration is a good start, it must be fol
lowed through by aligning the final deci
sion with what students want in Tresidder.
In the future, we hope that vendor alter
natives will be considered primarily on
their contribution to the community. A
reduced emphasis on meeting fiscal goals
will result in a better Tresidder for all Stan
ford community members.
