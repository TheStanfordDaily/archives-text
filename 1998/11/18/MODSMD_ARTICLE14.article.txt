## College kids say the darndest things 
### 
WHILE YOUNG
children say
nonsensical
things because of their
naive understanding of the
world, we college students
often make perplexing
statements without a good

excuse for doing so. The rumblings of small
kids are good for a few laughs, but the non
sense of young adults promises hours of
entertainment. Take a look at some of our
stranger linguistic behaviors.
New adjectives
While walking home from a concert on
campus, I overheard a pair of fans discussing
the quality of the performance. The first
person raved about the band's musical tal
ent and remarked that a particular song was
"the shiznit."
His companion enjoyed the show as well
but described the same song as "the shiznit
tiest." The first speaker reflected on this cor
rection for a while and eventually agreed
that it was a better characterization of the
song in question.
The pair then proceeded to debate the
relative aptitudes of the two guitarists, at
which point I interrupted them and pro
posed that the lead guitarist was"the shiznit
tier" of the two. From their perplexed faces,
1 gathered that only the regular and superla
tive forms of "the shiznit" are acceptable.
Abbreviations
We all agree that Stanford students have
invented ridiculous nicknames for their
campus landmarks and university traditions.
However there are a variety of other odd
ways in which we abbreviate our speech that
are less well-known
For instance, consider the rule of abbrevi
ation that applies to proper names. It states

that a person's name may be condensed by
taking the person's first initial and attaching
the suffix "-dog" to it. In addition, compound
proper names can be reduced by replacing
the first word with the definite article.
Some may doubt that people really con
struct nicknames in this way. But how many
times have you heard a friend propose the
following: "Let's pick up the P-dog. get
some go rdit as from the Bell and chug a cou
ple cans of the Dew"? If you have friends
like mine, you hear this every single day.
Technical jargon
A friend of mine confided in me that
when he has nothing better to say in
response to a comment, he finds great
humor value in expressing his reply in terms
of a purely mathematical concept.
"Marilyn Manson defies classification," I
mused one day."He is the opposite of typi
cal popular music."
"Actually Marilyn Manson is the dual"
my friend corrected. "He's not opposite —
he's perpendicular."
This friend is just one member of a grow
ing gang of mathematically inclined rapscal
lions who are introducing technical termi
nology into the youth vernacular. Some
times you can see these kids roaming cam
pus, wearing leather jackets and talking
tough.
"You'd better watch it,"the scar-faced
logician roars, "or else I'm going to induc
tively define your ass to the wall."
"Hey. bro," replies the hare-lipped set
theorist. "Cool it before I construct a func
tion that maps me onto your mama."
The two then enter into the symmetric
relation of high-fiving one another — all
right!
Reversals
Sometimes when I get myself into heated

arguments, I beeome flustered and defen
sive. My instinctual defense mechanism
involves turning the tables on my adversary
at every possible moment.
i think you have the wrong idea," says
my professor.
"No. I think you have the wrong idea," I
reply.
"Well, you're the one who failed the
exam."
"No, you're the one who failed the
exam."
"I think you had better leave my office
now."
"No. I think you had better leave my
office."
"Please leave."
"OK."
Cryptic subtlety
In certain kinds of conversations, the
rules of social propriety demand that we
communicate tactfully and indirectly.
Unfortunately, there are no set guidelines
that indicate what the appropriate level of
subtlety is.
"Did Pam break up with Jake?"
"Well, let's just say that the cook is in the
oven."
"Does that mean Jake dumped Pam?"
"1 don't want to name any names, but it
rhymes with 'carburetor.'"
"Are you talking about Jake or Pam?"
"Exactly."
In spite of our odd ways of speaking, we
all seem to understand each other well
enough. It is almost as though we all share a
common way of thinking.
So I'll see you all at the Bell later —P-
dog will be there, too.

When divided by "the shiznit, " Etc. tie
Park, a master's student in philosophy, is
equal to unity.
