Residents oppose development
We. the undersigned Stanford homeown
ers. write to express strong opposition to the
I Jniversity's proposal to build housing on
campus residential parks and open spaces —
Mayfield plavfield. Frenchman's Triangle,
C ierona Triangle and sites on Dolores Street
and (ierona /Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Many of our reasons have been set forth in
previous letters published in the Stanford
Report. Such housing has been termed
"infill:" a more accurate name might be "full
build-out" housing.
We argue that: 1) With an influx of new
housing on the horizon, the need for addi
tional housing on campus is unclear; 2) Fur
ther construction would be imprudent with
out a comprehensive, long-range plan; 3)
New housing in the residential area is unlike
ly to be affordable to those who need it; 4)
The handful of homes added would not jus
tify the loss of the last campus open spaces;
and 5) Campus residents should not be
denied a voice in decisions affecting their
neighborhtxxls and quality of life. We elabo

rate on these points and suggest ways to deal
with the shortage of affordable housing.
1) With some 1,500 new housing units
stxm to be built on or near campus, the need
for additional faculty / staff housing on cam
pus is unclear. The Stanford West project on
Sand I lill Road will add (>2B new rental units
plus 3(X) to 400 for-sale senior apartments.
The expansion of Escondido Village will add
another 480 units for graduate students.
These projects alone will free up other types
of housing on and off campus, and may meet,
or even exceed, current demand. In addition,
Stanford proposes to build another 250 hous
ing units suitable for families near Campus
Drive West, and 2(X) rental units for medical
residents at Quarry and Arboretum roads.
2) Additional housing construction on
Stanford lands should be based on a com
prehensive. long-range plan subject to public
review. The Faculty/Staff Housing Han
Stanford submitted to Santa Clara County in
1993 listed sites totaling over 4(X) acres as
suitable for housing. It did not list any "infill"
sites on the core campus other than the now
developed "Hill Site" at Dolores and Cabril
lo. It stated specifically that once this site was

completed, "there are no plans to develop
any similar sites for construction." Stanford
has reported to the county every year since
then that no significant changes have been
made to this 1993 plan. Stanford should he at
least as diligent as other municipalities in
developing long-range plans based on pro
jections of expected growth.
3) The number of housing units that could
be built on the designated "infill" sites, which
together total less than 12 acres, does not jus
tify the loss of valued campus open spaces.
Stanford's August housing brochure
announced the University was identifying
"20 or so individual lots on infill sites within
the core campus" for single-family housing.
This would be only a Band-Aid on a larger
housing problem, but it would do irreparable
damage to Stanford's precious rural charac
ter and the natural beauty of its campus.
Proposed sites are not "vacant lots," but
rather neighborhtxxl parks, play areas for
students and children, green belts and natu
ral preserves. I "hey help to make Stanford a
residential community, not just a university.
Once built over, these areas — and all their
present and future uses as open and recre

ational spaces — will be lost forever. They
should be developed in ways that enhance
their appeal to neighbors and to the Stanford
community as a whole. Improvements that
make the residential community attractive to
new faculty and staff, promote their interac
tion and increase safety are an investment in
the University's future.
4) Single-family homes built on infill sites
are unlikely to provide affordable housing
for newly recruited and tenured faculty and
staff. As Provost Rice wrote in her May 7 let
ter, however, "the most pressing currrent
need is for moderately priced homes suitable
for newly tenured faculty, many of whom
have young families." Campus infill develop
ments are unlikely to meet that need.
In the 2.8-acre Hill Site at Dolores and
Cabrillo, buyers paid Stanford an average of
$450,(MK) apiece for leases on eight 1/4- to 1/3-
acre undeveloped lots. Adding construction
costs. Hill Site homes probably cost $1 mil
lion or more, even though the lots are a frac
tion of the size of surrounding leaseholds.
Stanford prices campus land and housing
at local market rates, which are among the
highest in the country. Given this policy, the

only way to keep the cost of infill homes
down would be to build cheap housing —
i.e., small, inexpensively-constructed units
on small lots. But the Provost assured home
owners in her May 7 letter that the Universi
ty is not considering high-density develop
ments that would dramatically alter the char
acter of existing neighborhoods.
5) Ihe administration has denied campus
residents a voice in plans that could affect
their neighborhoods and quality of life.
Homeowners have had no say in the devel
opment of Stanford's plans for faculty / staff
housing, even though University administra
tors signed an agreement with SCRL
promising to "consult" with residents on
such decisions. Nor were homeowners on
the Housing I ask Force given any role in
developing these plans. Moreover, Stan
ford s August housing brochure reiterated
the proposal to build infill housing, in seem
ing disregard of homeowners' objections.
ITie Stanford residential area should be a
major source of strength and support for the
I Iniversity. By giving homeowners a voice in
decisions affecting their neighborhoods, the
