Residents oppose development
We. the undersigned Stanford homeown
ers. write to express strong opposition to the
I Jniversity's proposal to build housing on
campus residential parks and open spaces —
Mayfield plavfield. Frenchman's Triangle,
C ierona Triangle and sites on Dolores Street
and (ierona /Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Many of our reasons have been set forth in
previous letters published in the Stanford
Report. Such housing has been termed
"infill:" a more accurate name might be "full
build-out" housing.
We argue that: 1) With an influx of new
housing on the horizon, the need for addi
tional housing on campus is unclear; 2) Fur
ther construction would be imprudent with
out a comprehensive, long-range plan; 3)
New housing in the residential area is unlike
ly to be affordable to those who need it; 4)
The handful of homes added would not jus
tify the loss of the last campus open spaces;
and 5) Campus residents should not be
denied a voice in decisions affecting their
neighborhtxxls and quality of life. We elabo

rate on these points and suggest ways to deal
with the shortage of affordable housing.
1) With some 1,500 new housing units
stxm to be built on or near campus, the need
for additional faculty / staff housing on cam
pus is unclear. The Stanford West project on
Sand I lill Road will add (>2B new rental units
plus 3(X) to 400 for-sale senior apartments.
The expansion of Escondido Village will add
another 480 units for graduate students.
These projects alone will free up other types
of housing on and off campus, and may meet,
or even exceed, current demand. In addition,
Stanford proposes to build another 250 hous
ing units suitable for families near Campus
Drive West, and 2(X) rental units for medical
residents at Quarry and Arboretum roads.
2) Additional housing construction on
Stanford lands should be based on a com
prehensive. long-range plan subject to public
review. The Faculty/Staff Housing Han
Stanford submitted to Santa Clara County in
1993 listed sites totaling over 4(X) acres as
suitable for housing. It did not list any "infill"
sites on the core campus other than the now
developed "Hill Site" at Dolores and Cabril
lo. It stated specifically that once this site was

completed, "there are no plans to develop
any similar sites for construction." Stanford
has reported to the county every year since
then that no significant changes have been
made to this 1993 plan. Stanford should he at
least as diligent as other municipalities in
developing long-range plans based on pro
jections of expected growth.
3) The number of housing units that could
be built on the designated "infill" sites, which
together total less than 12 acres, does not jus
tify the loss of valued campus open spaces.
Stanford's August housing brochure
announced the University was identifying
"20 or so individual lots on infill sites within
the core campus" for single-family housing.
This would be only a Band-Aid on a larger
housing problem, but it would do irreparable
damage to Stanford's precious rural charac
ter and the natural beauty of its campus.
Proposed sites are not "vacant lots," but
rather neighborhtxxl parks, play areas for
students and children, green belts and natu
ral preserves. I "hey help to make Stanford a
residential community, not just a university.
Once built over, these areas — and all their
present and future uses as open and recre

ational spaces — will be lost forever. They
should be developed in ways that enhance
their appeal to neighbors and to the Stanford
community as a whole. Improvements that
make the residential community attractive to
new faculty and staff, promote their interac
tion and increase safety are an investment in
the University's future.
4) Single-family homes built on infill sites
are unlikely to provide affordable housing
for newly recruited and tenured faculty and
staff. As Provost Rice wrote in her May 7 let
ter, however, "the most pressing currrent
need is for moderately priced homes suitable
for newly tenured faculty, many of whom
have young families." Campus infill develop
ments are unlikely to meet that need.
In the 2.8-acre Hill Site at Dolores and
Cabrillo, buyers paid Stanford an average of
$450,(MK) apiece for leases on eight 1/4- to 1/3-
acre undeveloped lots. Adding construction
costs. Hill Site homes probably cost $1 mil
lion or more, even though the lots are a frac
tion of the size of surrounding leaseholds.
Stanford prices campus land and housing
at local market rates, which are among the
highest in the country. Given this policy, the

only way to keep the cost of infill homes
down would be to build cheap housing —
i.e., small, inexpensively-constructed units
on small lots. But the Provost assured home
owners in her May 7 letter that the Universi
ty is not considering high-density develop
ments that would dramatically alter the char
acter of existing neighborhoods.
5) Ihe administration has denied campus
residents a voice in plans that could affect
their neighborhoods and quality of life.
Homeowners have had no say in the devel
opment of Stanford's plans for faculty / staff
housing, even though University administra
tors signed an agreement with SCRL
promising to "consult" with residents on
such decisions. Nor were homeowners on
the Housing I ask Force given any role in
developing these plans. Moreover, Stan
ford s August housing brochure reiterated
the proposal to build infill housing, in seem
ing disregard of homeowners' objections.
ITie Stanford residential area should be a
major source of strength and support for the
I Iniversity. By giving homeowners a voice in
decisions affecting their neighborhoods, the
administration can nourish this support.
Conversely, by not working with homeown
ers and refusing to honor previous commit
ments. the University sends a strong signal to
future faculty about the desirability of com
ing to Stanford and living on the campus.
There is mounting pressure from outside
communities for Stanford to be held
accountable for the impacts of its develop
ment. That accountability should begin with
the nearly 900 families who live on campus.
Stanford is a residential university, and its
administration serves as a kind of city gov
ernment for campus homeowners. The Uni
versity collects a form of taxes (ground rent)
and pays for collective needs such as roads,
water, sewage and grounds maintenance. By
maintaining residential parks and open
spaces, the University is functioning as a
municipal government, not a private
landowner. If Palo Alto wanted to erect
housing on municipal parks, city officials
would have to hold public hearings and win
voters' approval. Is it right for Stanford resi
dents to have no voice in such decisions
because they live on a university campus?
We believe the University's accountabili
ty should extend to surrounding towns,
whose residents will also be profoundly
affected by the new housing Stanford plans
to build (not to mention the proposed addi
tional 450 units for faculty, staff and medical
residents). Adding 1,500 residences will pro

duce more congestion, traffic and pollution
and will increase the burden on the schools
and infrastructure of surrounding towns.
True, some Stanford employees who now
drive to work on campus will no longer do so.
But most campus residents find plenty of
reasons to drive on and off campus. Some of
theri spouses will drive to jobs off campus or
shuttle children to school and activities. And
almost all of the roughly 2,2(X)0r more adults
who will move into this new housing will
drive off campus to buy groceries, get gas. eat
out, etc.. The multiple impacts of this dra
matic population increase are of legitimate
concern to all local residents.
In the current climate, the administration
would be unwise to proceed with infill hous
ing construction, even if it is technically
allowable under the current general use per
mit. Such an action would be taken as evi
dence that the University does whatever it
pleases, regardless of what local residents
think. Greatness does not necessarily require
growth. Stanford should undertake no fur
ther construction without a sound master
plan which accounts for future housing needs
and their impacts on quality of life.
We do believe that University officials
should help faculty and staff with the high
cost of housing. We offer three suggestions:
1) Strengthen existing financing, loan and
assistance programs that help eligible faculty
and staff enter the housinu market. The

Provost confirmed in her May 7 letter that
housing assistance programs have often
proven inadequate. They should be
revamped to meet the challenges of today's
housing market. The administration has
taken aggressive steps to help graduate stu
dents with the high cost of housing, including
a special loan program, and securing blocks
of local apartments and renting them to stu
dents at roughly half price. It could take sim
ilar steps for faculty and staff. Stanford
already rents over 1 (X) on-campus housing
units to faculty and staff; it could acquire
additional units and rent or lease them to eli
gible employees at reduced rates.
The 1993 University Committee on
Housing Policies and Programs, chaired by
Prof. Gavin Wright, recommended ways to
strengthen and expand the University's
housing assistance and loan programs. Many
of these recommendations merit further con
sideration. Provost Rice rejected some as too
costly, explaining that she preferred to
"approach the problem of affordable hous
ing for new faculty through a longer term
strategy of increasing the stock of University
housing available on or near campus" (Dec.
9, 1993, memo to her Cabinet).
Increasing the housing stock will not
make this housing affordable under current
market conditions, however, unless enough
units were added to exceed the needs of the
two-thirds or more of all eligible faculty and

staff who currently live off campus — an
increase few would find acceptable.
2) Limit eligibility for housing on Stan
ford land to Stanford employees. Many
forms of housing on Stanford-owned land —
ranging from the 7(H) or more apartments at
Oak Creek to multi-million dollar estates on
Family Farm Road in Woodside — are
occupied by people with no University affili
ation. (The Stanford Management Company
recently renewed the Oak Creek lease with
out changing the eligibility requirements.)
Limiting future eligibility for such housing to
Stanford affiliates as current tenants leave
would significantly increase the pool of hous
ing available to faculty and staff, and it would
reduce commuting traffic through city
streets. Offering such units at subsidized
rates could make them more affordable.
3) Develop a comprehensive, long-range
plan for proposed housing and other devel
opment, and invite residents of the campus
and surrounding towns to review it. This
approach would help rebuild confidence in
the University's candor and intentions. It
might also lead to a better plan.
Filling in open space, parks and playfields
will irrevocably change the nature of campus
neighborhoods, diminish the attractiveness
of nearby homes, and have little if any
impact on the need for affordable housing.
The case has not been made that the benefits
from these few new residences will outweigh

this substantial loss. As the chair of the Fac
ulty Senate recently noted, it would require
several hundred more lots to alleviate the
shortage of affordable housing.
We do not expect to control residential
housing decisions, but we do expect a place
at the table. Stanford's administration serves
as a combination of mayor, city council and
planning commission. If administrators do
not exercise these responsibilities fairly — if
they fail to seek out and address residents'
needs and concerns, and deny them a mean
ingful voice in decisions that affect their qual
ity of life — they deprive homeowners of
essential civic rights and responsibilities. A
residential community in which citizens feel
disenfranchised and powerless is not an
attractive place to live. Though the faculty
has no formal power in these decisions, it
would be a mistake to dismiss faculty opinion
as irrelevant or unimportant.
A recent editorial in the Palo Alto Week
ly called on Stanford to show more respect
and understanding of the concerns of sur
rounding communities. Campus residents
deserve the same.

ing construction, even if it is technically
allowable under the current general use per
mit. Such an action would be taken as evi
dence that the University does whatever it
pleases, regardless of what local residents
think. Greatness does not necessarily require
growth. Stanford should undertake no fur
ther construction without a sound master
plan which accounts for future housing needs
and their impacts on quality of life.
We do believe that University officials
should help faculty and staff with the high
cost of housing. We offer three suggestions:
1) Strengthen existing financing, loan and
assistance programs that help eligible faculty
and staff enter the housinu market. The

Provost confirmed in her May 7 letter that
housing assistance programs have often
proven inadequate. They should be
revamped to meet the challenges of today's
housing market. The administration has
taken aggressive steps to help graduate stu
dents with the high cost of housing, including
a special loan program, and securing blocks
of local apartments and renting them to stu
dents at roughly half price. It could take sim
ilar steps for faculty and staff. Stanford
already rents over 1 (X) on-campus housing
units to faculty and staff; it could acquire
additional units and rent or lease them to eli
gible employees at reduced rates.
The 1993 University Committee on
Housing Policies and Programs, chaired by
Prof. Gavin Wright, recommended ways to
strengthen and expand the University's
housing assistance and loan programs. Many
of these recommendations merit further con
sideration. Provost Rice rejected some as too
costly, explaining that she preferred to
"approach the problem of affordable hous
ing for new faculty through a longer term
strategy of increasing the stock of University
housing available on or near campus" (Dec.
9, 1993, memo to her Cabinet).
Increasing the housing stock will not
make this housing affordable under current
market conditions, however, unless enough
units were added to exceed the needs of the
two-thirds or more of all eligible faculty and

staff who currently live off campus — an
increase few would find acceptable.
2) Limit eligibility for housing on Stan
ford land to Stanford employees. Many
forms of housing on Stanford-owned land —
ranging from the 7(H) or more apartments at
Oak Creek to multi-million dollar estates on
Family Farm Road in Woodside — are
occupied by people with no University affili
ation. (The Stanford Management Company
recently renewed the Oak Creek lease with
out changing the eligibility requirements.)
Limiting future eligibility for such housing to
Stanford affiliates as current tenants leave
would significantly increase the pool of hous
ing available to faculty and staff, and it would
reduce commuting traffic through city
streets. Offering such units at subsidized
rates could make them more affordable.
3) Develop a comprehensive, long-range
plan for proposed housing and other devel
opment, and invite residents of the campus
and surrounding towns to review it. This
approach would help rebuild confidence in
the University's candor and intentions. It
might also lead to a better plan.
Filling in open space, parks and playfields
will irrevocably change the nature of campus
neighborhoods, diminish the attractiveness
of nearby homes, and have little if any
impact on the need for affordable housing.
The case has not been made that the benefits
from these few new residences will outweigh

this substantial loss. As the chair of the Fac
ulty Senate recently noted, it would require
several hundred more lots to alleviate the
shortage of affordable housing.
We do not expect to control residential
housing decisions, but we do expect a place
at the table. Stanford's administration serves
as a combination of mayor, city council and
planning commission. If administrators do
not exercise these responsibilities fairly — if
they fail to seek out and address residents'
needs and concerns, and deny them a mean
ingful voice in decisions that affect their qual
ity of life — they deprive homeowners of
essential civic rights and responsibilities. A
residential community in which citizens feel
disenfranchised and powerless is not an
attractive place to live. Though the faculty
has no formal power in these decisions, it
would be a mistake to dismiss faculty opinion
as irrelevant or unimportant.

and understanding of the concerns of sur

1% campus homeowners
Residents oppose development
We. the undersigned Stanford homeown
ers. write to express strong opposition to the
I Jniversity's proposal to build housing on
campus residential parks and open spaces —
Mayfield plavfield. Frenchman's Triangle,
C ierona Triangle and sites on Dolores Street
and (ierona /Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Many of our reasons have been set forth in
previous letters published in the Stanford
Report. Such housing has been termed
"infill:" a more accurate name might be "full
build-out" housing.
We argue that: 1) With an influx of new
housing on the horizon, the need for addi
tional housing on campus is unclear; 2) Fur
ther construction would be imprudent with
out a comprehensive, long-range plan; 3)
New housing in the residential area is unlike
ly to be affordable to those who need it; 4)
The handful of homes added would not jus
tify the loss of the last campus open spaces;
and 5) Campus residents should not be
denied a voice in decisions affecting their
neighborhtxxls and quality of life. We elabo

rate on these points and suggest ways to deal
with the shortage of affordable housing.
1) With some 1,500 new housing units
stxm to be built on or near campus, the need
for additional faculty / staff housing on cam
pus is unclear. The Stanford West project on
Sand I lill Road will add (>2B new rental units
plus 3(X) to 400 for-sale senior apartments.
The expansion of Escondido Village will add
another 480 units for graduate students.
These projects alone will free up other types
of housing on and off campus, and may meet,
or even exceed, current demand. In addition,
Stanford proposes to build another 250 hous
ing units suitable for families near Campus
Drive West, and 2(X) rental units for medical
residents at Quarry and Arboretum roads.
2) Additional housing construction on
Stanford lands should be based on a com
prehensive. long-range plan subject to public
review. The Faculty/Staff Housing Han
Stanford submitted to Santa Clara County in
1993 listed sites totaling over 4(X) acres as
suitable for housing. It did not list any "infill"
sites on the core campus other than the now
developed "Hill Site" at Dolores and Cabril
lo. It stated specifically that once this site was

completed, "there are no plans to develop
any similar sites for construction." Stanford
has reported to the county every year since
then that no significant changes have been
made to this 1993 plan. Stanford should he at
least as diligent as other municipalities in
developing long-range plans based on pro
jections of expected growth.
3) The number of housing units that could
be built on the designated "infill" sites, which
together total less than 12 acres, does not jus
tify the loss of valued campus open spaces.
Stanford's August housing brochure
announced the University was identifying
"20 or so individual lots on infill sites within
the core campus" for single-family housing.
This would be only a Band-Aid on a larger
housing problem, but it would do irreparable
damage to Stanford's precious rural charac
ter and the natural beauty of its campus.
Proposed sites are not "vacant lots," but
rather neighborhtxxl parks, play areas for
students and children, green belts and natu
ral preserves. I "hey help to make Stanford a
residential community, not just a university.
Once built over, these areas — and all their
present and future uses as open and recre

ational spaces — will be lost forever. They
should be developed in ways that enhance
their appeal to neighbors and to the Stanford
community as a whole. Improvements that
make the residential community attractive to
new faculty and staff, promote their interac
tion and increase safety are an investment in
the University's future.
4) Single-family homes built on infill sites
are unlikely to provide affordable housing
for newly recruited and tenured faculty and
staff. As Provost Rice wrote in her May 7 let
ter, however, "the most pressing currrent
need is for moderately priced homes suitable
for newly tenured faculty, many of whom
have young families." Campus infill develop
ments are unlikely to meet that need.
In the 2.8-acre Hill Site at Dolores and
Cabrillo, buyers paid Stanford an average of
$450,(MK) apiece for leases on eight 1/4- to 1/3-
acre undeveloped lots. Adding construction
costs. Hill Site homes probably cost $1 mil
lion or more, even though the lots are a frac
tion of the size of surrounding leaseholds.
Stanford prices campus land and housing
at local market rates, which are among the
highest in the country. Given this policy, the

only way to keep the cost of infill homes
down would be to build cheap housing —
i.e., small, inexpensively-constructed units
on small lots. But the Provost assured home
owners in her May 7 letter that the Universi
ty is not considering high-density develop
ments that would dramatically alter the char
acter of existing neighborhoods.
5) Ihe administration has denied campus
residents a voice in plans that could affect
their neighborhoods and quality of life.
Homeowners have had no say in the devel
opment of Stanford's plans for faculty / staff
housing, even though University administra
tors signed an agreement with SCRL
promising to "consult" with residents on
such decisions. Nor were homeowners on
the Housing I ask Force given any role in
developing these plans. Moreover, Stan
ford s August housing brochure reiterated
the proposal to build infill housing, in seem
ing disregard of homeowners' objections.
ITie Stanford residential area should be a
major source of strength and support for the
I Iniversity. By giving homeowners a voice in
decisions affecting their neighborhoods, the
administration can nourish this support.
Conversely, by not working with homeown
ers and refusing to honor previous commit
ments. the University sends a strong signal to
future faculty about the desirability of com
ing to Stanford and living on the campus.
There is mounting pressure from outside
communities for Stanford to be held
accountable for the impacts of its develop
ment. That accountability should begin with
the nearly 900 families who live on campus.
Stanford is a residential university, and its
administration serves as a kind of city gov
ernment for campus homeowners. The Uni
versity collects a form of taxes (ground rent)
and pays for collective needs such as roads,
water, sewage and grounds maintenance. By
maintaining residential parks and open
spaces, the University is functioning as a
municipal government, not a private
landowner. If Palo Alto wanted to erect
housing on municipal parks, city officials
would have to hold public hearings and win
voters' approval. Is it right for Stanford resi
dents to have no voice in such decisions
because they live on a university campus?
We believe the University's accountabili
ty should extend to surrounding towns,
whose residents will also be profoundly
affected by the new housing Stanford plans
to build (not to mention the proposed addi
tional 450 units for faculty, staff and medical
residents). Adding 1,500 residences will pro

duce more congestion, traffic and pollution
and will increase the burden on the schools
and infrastructure of surrounding towns.
True, some Stanford employees who now
drive to work on campus will no longer do so.
But most campus residents find plenty of
reasons to drive on and off campus. Some of
theri spouses will drive to jobs off campus or
shuttle children to school and activities. And
almost all of the roughly 2,2(X)0r more adults
who will move into this new housing will
drive off campus to buy groceries, get gas. eat
out, etc.. The multiple impacts of this dra
matic population increase are of legitimate
concern to all local residents.
In the current climate, the administration
would be unwise to proceed with infill hous
ing construction, even if it is technically
allowable under the current general use per
mit. Such an action would be taken as evi
dence that the University does whatever it
pleases, regardless of what local residents
think. Greatness does not necessarily require
growth. Stanford should undertake no fur
ther construction without a sound master
plan which accounts for future housing needs
and their impacts on quality of life.
We do believe that University officials
