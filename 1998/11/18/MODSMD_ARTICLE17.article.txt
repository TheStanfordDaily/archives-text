# Deep Thoughts
## Earning the grade without selling the goods

Brittney Jensen

I WORKED AT a restaurant in L.A.
last summer. For job orientation, we
had to sign numerous forms agreeing
to company policies, such as not using the
restaurant as a tront for drug-dealing or
prostitution. The longest, most detailed
form was the one about sexual harassment.
I signed the two-page description of sex
ual harassment, promising to restrain from
any visual, verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature. As 1 passed my form back to
my late-20's male manager, he grasped my
hand, looked into my eyes and said, "My,
you have a nice smile."
At first I accepted this statement as just
a warm fuzzy welcome to a friendly work
ing environment. This manager, along with
the other single male manager, was plenty
friendly, and then some.
The compliments on the smile turned
into remarks on my legs and butt. My dat
ing status was frequently inquired into, and
one ol the managers instigated discussions
of relative virginity.
The comments were never vulgar, but in
a playful "have you told your friends about
us yet?" vein. There were no physical

advances beyond my manager's request for
a kiss on his cheek in return for my pay
check. There was no pubic hair on soda
cans or stained blue dresses.
So was I a victim of sexual harassment?
Should 1 have asked them to stop or sued
for big bucks?
1 was surprised at the prevalence of sex
ual comments in the post-Anita Hill, late
'90s workplace, but not too upset about it.
I'm ashamed to I admit I sometimes used
the special attention I got to my advantage.
I knew which managers to ask for a free
meal and which ones would give me Satur
day night off for a smile. Perhaps this was
unethical, but it's not like we were making
out in the freezer, and sometimes I really
needed to go to a Beastie Boys concert
when 1 was scheduled to work.
When does flirtatious behavior become
unbearable harassment? The Stanford
Bulletin emphasizes that sexual harass
ment is defined by the "specific facts and
the context" of flirtatious behavior. A spe
cial note is made on consensual relation
ships between "individuals in inherently
unequal positions (such as teacher and stu

dent. supervisor and employee)." The Bul
letin doesn't strictly forbid such relation
ships. but it points out the risks involved. It
warns that student-faculty relationships
may "undermine the real or perceived
integrity of the supervision and evaluation
provided." This is my concern with sexual
harassment at Stanford. Flirtation between
a teacher and student messes with the self
esteem of the latter.
My two friendly managers always told
me 1 was doing a super job as take-out
cashier. I didn't really believe them, since
approximately half the customers found
some reason to throw a fit. Perhaps this
could be chalked up to local attitude (we
were in Beverly Hills), or maybe 1 was
incompetent. A manager reassuring me
while stroking my hair didn't help me dis
cern my actual ability.
Take-out cashiering hopefully does not
figure into my future career plans, so I
wasn't too concerned about my food order
ing skills. But if 1 ever get a job that I actu
ally care about, like free-lance writing or
pole-dancing, 1 would like to be honestly
evaluated on my job performance, not the

tightness of my butt.
At Stanford, I once had a friendly male
teaching assistant. He never invited me to
his apartment for a home-cooked meal or
attached roses to my returned assignments,
as TAs have done to friends, but he was
always hovering on the fine line between
teacherly concern and lasciviousness.
Once he asked me if I was a dancer
because he thought 1 had nice legs. I was
disturbed that my TA was looking at my
legs. The comment could have been inno
cent and non-sexual, but I started having
doubts about his objectivity toward young
females. When I got an A+ on my next
paper, 1 wasn't sure I'd earned it. Maybe it
was a sample of fabulous writing, or maybe
my TA thought I had a nice body. I missed
out on intellectual pride I perhaps
deserved.
In high school, I was one of my sopho
more English teacher's favorite students.
He convinced me I was an excellent writer
and he wrote my college recommenda
tions. Although he was friendly to females,
often resting his hand on girls' shoulders
and complimenting their outfits, he was

probably over 50, unattractive and married
to another teacher. So I dismissed his affec
tion as grandfatherly and believed I had
earned his A's and Stanford-worthy rec
ommendations.
The year after I graduated he was arrest
ed for sleeping with a 16-year-old student.
1 felt very sorry for the girl; I don't know if
she was on crack or very emotionally
needy. Although 1 never came close to
touching the guy, I began to doubt my aca
demic achievements. 1 wondered if I only
got into Stanford through my womanly
charms. At least the SAT proctor didn't
even look at me.
Although it's tempting to flirt with your
TA for an easy A, the results can be
demeaning to both parties. Perhaps sexual
tension is inevitable in young adult interac
tions, but expressions of attraction
between teacher and student should be
saved for after the final.
