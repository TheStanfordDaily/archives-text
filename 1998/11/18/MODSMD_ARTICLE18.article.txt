## No. 3 Cardinal to face a tough field in NIT First challenge of the season for highly touted squad 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
Arthur Lee's stride graces the
cover of Sports Ulustrated's college
basketball preview, released this
week, as the prestigious magazine
named Stanford its top pick in the
nation.
And yet, heading into a Chase
National Invitation Tournament
filled with such big-name schools as
No. 10 North Carolina, No. 15 Pur
due and No. 23 Massachusetts, Stan
ford head coach Mike Montgomery
is a little concerned with the way his
squad has been performing of late.
"We have to play better than we
have, starting pretty soon," Mont
gomery said. "I know that we aren't

playing as well as we were at the end
of last year. Given our schedule, that
concerns me."
This is just the beginning, howev
er, of what is being called the tough
est schedule in school history for No.
3 Stanford, which faces No. 6 Mary
land and possibly No. 7 Temple in
subsequent weeks.
And yet, it might be just what the
Cardinal needs.
"The earlier we start playing
competitive games, the better," said
junior forward Mark Madsen. "I
think we have a lot of room for im
provement. It's [just] a matter of get
ting more games under our belt.
Having a competitive schedule gets
us focused."
With all five starters returning

from last year's Final Four team, ex
pectations are extremely high and
perhaps provide an added pressure
to this team.

"l don't think there is much ques
tion that all of us are a victim of the
hype." Montgomery said. "I know
[though] that if we do the stuff we're
capable of, if we're consistent, we'll
do fine. I think we need to play
against some good teams that are ca
pable of beating you to see how you
will respond."
These next two weeks, Mont
gomery might get that wish.
Stanford opens the NIT tourna
ment tonight with a p.m. game at
Maples Pavilion when it hosts a
young, yet ambitious Southern
Methodist team. A victory would
match the Cardinal with Missouri or
Southwest Missouri on Friday,
where the winner of this game would
travel to New York for next week's
semifinal game in Madison Square
Garden.
Also included in this year's tour
nament are Georgia and St. John's,
two other respected teams.
"It's going to take four really
good games for us to win it," said

Stanford senior forward Peter
Sauer. But if "a group of veterans
with tournament experience isn't up
to it, I think there is a problem."
While significantly younger and
more inexperienced than the Cardi
nal, SMIJ fields a lineup of three
sophomores and two freshmen, led
by point guard Jervl Sasser. Sasser
led the Mustangs as a freshman last
season in three categories with 15
points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists
per game.
"He'll play the point for them
and cause us some problems,"
Montgomery said of Sasser. "He's
good with the ball and he makes
other players better."
While Lee will be assigned to
contain Sasser's offensive produc
tion. it is more SMU'sdefensive play
which concerns Montgomery.
"Mike [Dement] is a good coach
and he's able to mess with the game
with his changing defenses," Mont
gomery said. "They are going to be a
team that will change things around
on you."
"They're really going to be a chal
lenge [but] I like it like that," Mad
sen added.
In addition to Lee, Madsen will
prove crucial to Stanford's play, as
he has already demonstrated the re
bounding ability to give the Cardinal
many second- attempt shots. In just
20 minutes of play in Stanford's sea
