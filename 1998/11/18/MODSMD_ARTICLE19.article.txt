# Stanford's biggest fan
## Defense's veteran is pumped for his final Big Game this week 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Even in Saturday's 101st Big Game, with alumni flying
in from all over the country to cheer on the Cardinal, it
would be difficult to find a bigger Stanford fan than out
side linebacker Donnie Spragan.
My career at Stanford "has been great," Spragan said.
"I thank everyone who got me here, like coach [Tyrone]
Willingham. I have to thank them, because it's been a
blessing.
"When I run into my friends from home, they say I've
become Stanford. You come here and you sort of just be
come Stanford and everything it means to you."
Spragan's affinity for the farm doesn't end with the
football program, either. In fact, the senior even profess
es a love for the marching band uncommon to those in the
Athletics Department.
"Yeah," he laughed. "They're crazy, a little loony. My
mother loves the band, my father and sister love the band,
so yeah, I guess I love the band. You know, last year's
whole Notre Dame fiasco, stuff like that just makes you
fall into Stanford mode, with the band going crazy."
So does "All Right Now" really get Stanford's hottest
pass rusher fired up?
"Uh, is that the one that goes da — da-da-da?" He
said, humming the intro. "What actually gets me more
psyched up is when the band plays "Star Wars" at the be
ginning as we're coming down the tunnel. They sort of got
away from that, but they're doing it again. If that doesn't

work, then "All Right Now".
"It's funny. If you don't go to Stan
ford, you hate the band. You come
here, you love them."
Spragan transferred from Pacific
in January of 19% and hasn't looked
back.
"Sure, there was sort of an adjust
ment period. I had a lot of guys in
front of me, so I didn't play that much
and I just sort of soaked everything
up," Spragan said. "I played a little
special teams before figuring out
what was going on."
Spragan's certainly figured things
out, especially in the second half of
this season. The 6-loot-4, 240-pound
civil engineering major has gone on a
tear in the last four games, roughly
coinciding with the improved overall
play of the Stanford defense.
In the first six games of the season,
Spragan had 1 (i tackles, one tackle for
loss, no quarterback sacks, two inter
ceptions and two pass deflections.
He's more than doubled those num
bers, with 37 tackles, five pass break
ups, three quarterback sacks, eight
tackles-for-loss and one interception.
Against USC, Spragan recorded a
season-high 11 tackles, then topped it
the next week against WSIJ with 13
more, five of which were for a loss.
"Sure, I've improved. We've all
improved." Spragan said.

Going into Saturday's Big Game,
Spragan has 53 tackles, nine tackles
for loss, three sacks, three intercep
tions and seven pass deflections.
Regardless of his individual suc
cess, Spragan insists that a few more
victories would he far more satisfying.
He's one of the few seniors on a
young defense that has earned expe
rience the hard way all year long.
"It's been pretty frustrating,"
Spragan said. "We knew it was going
to be sort of rough. Everything would
have to click, and some things didn't
click just right and that's why we've
come away winless some times. So
sure, it's been tough.
"Hut it hasn't been horrible. I love
playing football, even if I'm not on
the winning side."
That said. Spragan's pleased with
the development of the defense that
has been to some extent under his
tutelage.
"We started out young. Hey,
we're still young," he chuckled. "We
just need to eliminate big plays.
Sometimes it seems like some of the
younger guys have just been a little bit
cloudy and we'll have a breakdown.
We'll stop a team two or three series
in a row. but then give up a long play
that'll just kill us. Hut not tot) many
teams have driven down the field on
us."
Fortunately, a win in the 101st Big
Game would do a lot to salve the
wounds of what has been a painful
season.

"It makes things a lot easier if you
win your last game, no doubt," Spra
gan said.
" You get a short memory. It'll also
mean that we'll have won two
straight, and that'll he g(x>d for the
guys going into the offseason, as well
as for guys like me who are playing
their last game," he added.
The 2-K Cardinal will take on the
5-5 Bears, with one of the prime
matehups oeeurring between Cal's
weak offense and Spragan's inuch
improved Stanford defense. With all
the standard Big Game hype already
begun for fans, students and alumni,
Spragan still insists that the game is
far more important to the players
themselves.
"Mueh more important — 20
times more important when you're
out there," Spragan said. "I'm from
the Bay Area, and so I'll see a bunch
ofCal guys I know on weekends and
it'll make it a lot easier if I can know
we beat them.
" This is pretty much our season, so
it's 1 (X) times more powerful. You de
velop a real dislike for Cal when
you're grunting and sweating and
bleeding with them on the field."
Saturday will be Spragan's last
game in a C 'ardinal uniform before he
attempts to continue his career in the
NFL, and he has but one request for
the Stanford student body.
"Support us at Cal. We need the
noise, we need the energy," he said.
"You know, they stole our tree!!"
