Civil and Environmental Engineering
Professor Jack R. Benjamin, who-taught at
Stanford for 25 years, died on Aug. 26 of a
heart attack and stroke. He was SI.
Known for his innovative and practical
approaches to structural engineering, Ben
jamin played a significant role in applying

probability statistics to the analysis of struc
tural design.
"His primary contributions to science
were developing and promoting the use of
probability and safety theory to guide the tic
sign of structures, in contrast to tradition il
ad hoc ways used in the past." said Allin Cor
nell, one of Benjamin's former doctoral stu
dents. and professor of civil engineering.
Cornell and Benjamin co-authored the text
book "Probability. Statistics and Decisions
for Civil Engineers."
Cornell recalled Benjamin's influeiKc as
a teacher: "He made you keep your eye on
what was important."
Born in in Olympia. Wash.. Ben
jamin received his bachelor's and m islet 's of
science degrees from the IJniwrsih of
Washington, and his doctor, j from Mi l .
After teaching for two years at the Rensse
laer Polytechnic Institute. Benjamin came to
Stanford in 194<X and taught structural engi
neering and probability statistics until his re
tirement in l l )73.
"1 le was extremely unique both in his un
derstanding of structures and in his ability to
convey the notion of how the structures per

formed. 1 le had an absolute gift for under
standing probability statistics," said Martin
McCann, president of Jack R. Benjamin and
Associates. Benjamin had founded the com
pany. which specializes in p iclear safety,
after his' ''rement from Star.iord.
"Each the individual partners was re
sponsible themselves and was not to be
able to take an inappropriate advantage,"
said McCann referring to Benjamin's corpo
rate philosophy. "He took a fatherly role in
helping everyone of us to grow up. He
helped lis to survive on our own."
Benjamin spent much of his retirement
traveling. "He was a tugged individualist, an
iconoclast. I le was into fishing and traveling,
and he liked to not be a burden on those
whom he went to see," recalled McCann,
Benjamin is survived by his son Roy
Bradley, daughters Sue and Kay. seven
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
A memorial service was ' Id Sept. 1 and
i memorial fund has been c ablished in his
honor in the Department of Civil and Envi
ronmental Engineering. Donations can be
made to the department at Terman Engi
neerinc Center, Stanford. CA 9430?-1020.
