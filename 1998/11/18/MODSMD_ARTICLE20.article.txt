POLO
The Stanford women's polo team trav
eled to Cororado this past weekend where
it was privileged to play a very fast and
skilled opposing side. The Cardinal came
away winless on the weekend but with a
great deal of valuable experience that will
allow for improvements as the season pro
gresses.
While in Fort Collins, Colo., the team
played two matches. The first, played on
Saturday, was not a close contest as the
Rams ran away with the match 18-3.
"We got killed." said captain Brandy
Moses, "but learned a lot and improved
for the next day to compete in a very close
game."
Sunday's game did indeed show how
quickly Stanford was able to learn the
lessons from the day before and apply the
necessary changes to its style of play. Up
until the end of the match the game was
only split by two points. At the end of the
period, though. Colorado State broke
away and added three goals for a final

score of 13-8.
"It was the best polo we have seen yet
and at a speed and level far better then we
have played thus far. It was a great experi
ence and the improvement was tremen
dous over the weekend," Moses said.
The Cardinal is excited to play at a fast
pace and to put its new experience to the
test. Both the men's and women's team
will travel to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
this weekend for a set of matches against
the Mustangs.

WOMEN'S RUGBY
The Stanford women's rugby team
was asked to pull double duty this last
weekend. The team had two matches
scheduled â€” one in Oakland and the
other in Monterey. Therefore, two teams
were put together in order to meet both
demands.
Head coach Emile Bruneau took the
first team to Oakland to play the East Bay
Bulldogs club team. Even though the Car
dinal faced a community-based team.

which typically has older and more expe
rienced players, Stanford came away with
a convincing victory by a score of 60-0.
Although the competition may not
have been what the team expected, nor
provided quite the opposition that would
help the team prepare for the upcoming
collegiate league season, this did not
daunt the players enjoyment of the after
noon.
"It was fun to play. Our forwards and
backs hooked up and played together bet
ter than I 've ever seen. We had a couple of
great group games," said club president
Lara Strauss.
The game in Oakland was played with
three periods consisting of 30 minutes
rather than the traditional two periods of
40 minutes. This was to allow some more
changing of personnel and coaching due
to being in the early part of the preseason.
The game began rather slowly, with
Stanford only putting 10 of its 60 points on
the board. The pace quickly sped up,
though, and many of the Cardinal players
scored. The balance of the Stanford at-
tack was seen in the number of dif
ferent position players that scored
during the game.
Strauss led the scoring with
three tries, Lucy Aimers had two
tries and a host of other players had
one try each. Seven different play
ers scored one try each for Stan
ford. Thus, for the day nine differ
ent players contributed points for
the Cardinal.
The rookies in Monterey did not
let their mentors in Oakland down

either. They played a l()'s format
rather than 15's as will be played
during the league season. Stanford
rugby men's head coach and pro
gram director Franck Boivert di
rected the rookie team.
Stanford beat Cal State-Mon
terey 20-0. All of the rookies
showed how quickly they are pick
ing up the game. Several of the
rookies were playing in new posi
tions for the first time as well.
Heather Littlejohn moved from
the backline to play at prop and
Sara Donatelli played hooker. It
shows a tremendous effort to play
well with two new players in the

front row.
Rounding out those playing in
new positions was Sarah C lowes at
the lull hack position.
The team, as a whole, is very ex
cited at the last pace that the rook
ies are developing into seasoned
players. This will prove to be very
valuable as the league season wears
on.
With the change of the national
championship format into just one
tournament of 16 teams, having a
number of reserves that are able to
come into a game and improve the
level of play will help the Cardinal
make a run at the championship.
