## Loving this rivalry

Editor's Note: / asked Ethan Lindsey, a well
respected sportswriter for the Daily Californ
ian, to write a guest column on Big Game from
Cal's perspective.

This is my third year at Berkeley, which
means I have yet to experience the true
thrill of claiming victory in the Big Game. Al
though two years may not seem like a long
wait, it feels like an eternity.
With many friends attending Stanford, it is
hard to boast and brag about the superiority
of my school when it has collapsed, and ulti
mately lost, to Stanford in consecutive years
— including a last-second defeat in the 1 ( X)th
anniversary of the game.

Last year was especially bitter-tasting be
cause of the way in which the Bears lost.
It was right after future NFL draft-pick
Bobby Shaw scored a touchdown with under
five minutes remaining that I got "rolled up"
for the first time. 1 literally body surfed from
the bottom of the bleachers to the very last
row of Stanford Stadium. The feeling was in
credible — and I got back to my seat just in
time to see our elf-si/ed quarterback throw a
game-ending, third-down interception to
Cardinal linebacker Chris Draft. Ouch.
The tradition of this rivalry is too rich to
cover in one column, but I'll give you high
lights from the perspective of a Bears' fan.
First, the television broadcast of ' The
Play" is looped and played 24 hours a day in
the school's student store. Second, the night
before the game there is a huge bonfire in
which old alumni stand up on stage and recre
ate the old "Give 'em the Axe" rally. Finally
there is, of course, that fabled Axe.
I only need to mention "The Play" at the
end of the 19K2 Big Game (which, if my mem
ory serves me right, Stanford ended up los
ing). Plus, the game has been decided on the
last play four times already, more than any
other series in college football.
There are other big rivalries but none
seem as prone to excitement as the Big
Game.
When Ohio State and Michigan clash, it
often decides Big-10 supremacy. The game is
always a battle between two college football

powerhouses. In contrast, the Big Game
sometimes gets played for little else than
school pride, which in the end makes it that
much more important.
The greatness of the Cal-Stanford compe
tition results directly from all the pranks and
hoaxes surrounding it.
This may be especially timely because of
the recent antics surrounding the "Phoenix
Five" and the once-missing Stanford Tree.
The group, who stole the Tree and sent a hu
morous letter about the Tree's experience at
Berkeley, subsequently ended up fugitives.
They were soon running from both the
long arm of the law and the shiny bald head of
Cal Chancellor Robert Berdahl. Granted,
Berdahl has been a Golden Bear for only two
years or so, but doesn't he know that the hal
lowed Axe tradition began in exactly the
same manner?
If you look at it closely, it seems like the
"Phoenix Five" have the right idea. This is di
rection the rivalry should be heading, instead
of ending each Big Game with a mad rush to
see who can kick each other's brains out in
the least amount of time.
Remember the Monday after "The Play"
when Stanford replaced hundreds of copies
of the Daily Cal with papers saying that the
NCAA had awarded the game to the Cardi
nal? That is what this rivalry should be about.
Last year, on that fateful drive that ended
the game, a man calling himself Theodore D.
Kelly tapped into the referee's public address
system and broadcast to the teams, the 85,000
fans, and the television audience, "Penalty.
Excessive Arrogance. Stanford Sucks."
Oski and the Tree dukeing it out by them
selves on the basketball court is one thing, but
thousands of angry Cal fans against one un
armed Tree is just pointless, even if we did
tear the ugly thing to shreds. I'll admit that I
have a piece of the Tree I grabbed in the 19%
altercation. Looking back on that, I realize I
was just a frustrated freshman who didn't un
derstand the rivalry.
I guess my main point is that we got a darn
good thing here. Something better than any
where else. I love this game so much, and as
evidence I am flying for 16 hours across the
Pacific Ocean to arrive in the Bay Area, after
studying overseas, in time for kick-off. Maybe
this year will be another one for the record
books.
And remember, as the game's clock winds
down on Saturday, tell your band to stay off
the field until the game ends.

Ethan Lindsey will he that crazy red head
running around Memorial Stadium on Satur
day. Just smile and nod.
