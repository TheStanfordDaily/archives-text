## Stanford filmmaker contemplates death 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
Maren Monsen thinks about
death — a lot. The physician and
filmmaker, who is also a senior
research fellow at Stanford's Cen
ter for Biomedical Ethics, made it
the subject of "The Vanishing
Line," her latest film. She hopes
that after watching her documen
tary, other doctors will think
about death, too.
In"The Vanishing Line,"
Monsen follows a hospice worker
on his rounds in an effort to get
acquainted with death. The idea
came when Monsen was still in
her residency. It was the first time
she'd had to follow the proce
dures for pronouncing death —
something textbooks touched on,
but didn't deeply explore.
Monsen's film, which is used as
a teaching aid for medical stu
dents, describes the complex
choices patients often have to
make about the end of life. It was
shown at the Medical School sev
eral times last week, in addition to
recent screenings in San Francis
co, in preparation for a talk she
gave Friday on "The Art and
Issues of Dying."
As a physician. Monsen regu
larly found herself resuscitating
patients on the verge of dying.
Resuscitation is often a "grue
some process" involving the
application of enough pressure to
break the patient's rihs, the inser
tion of a large tube into the lungs
and repeated electric shocks
intended to restart the heart.
In the film, Monsen recounts a
personal crisis that happened
when she'd helped resuscitate a
man who had specified that he
didn't want the procedure.
Although he had wanted a natu
ral death, he had accidentally
been kept alive and was on life
support. Monsen realized that
resuscitation is more than hospital
procedure — it is a complex issue
that changes how we die.
"I certainly wouldn't want to
be resuscitated and survive just to
spend the next two months in an
intensive care unit before 1 died."
Monsen said to an audience of
about 50 medical students Friday.
"I started to realize that I was
spending my residency learning to
do things for people that I'd never
want done to myself."
But with this realization came
the need for Monsen to confront
something else — fear of death
and denial of her own mortality.
In"The Vanishing Line," she
documents her journey in coming

to understand death, but it wasn't
an easy process. Monsen felt chal
lenged to "give a topic as pro
found as death and dying the
beauty and poetry it deserves."
The resulting film illustrates
the complexity of choices around
death on a very personal level,
but it is not intended to be
depressing or macabre.
Monsen and her camera crew
follow Jim, a hospice worker
whose comforts patients who
have chosen to die at home. She
marvels at his ability to deal with
death every day — a characteris
tic that resulted from nursing his
terminally ill wife for 12 years.
Jim and his wife wanted some
control over how her life would
end, but weren't prepared for the
difficulty of the moment when it
finally came. Their joint decision
to remove her from life support
was painful, but as he tells Mon
sen, in the end "the experience of
death is not a horrible thing — it's
very sacred, very beautiful."
In the last line of Monsen's
film, she wonders aloud what it
will be like to be a doctor who
doesn't see death as the enemy.
It's a lesson that many in the audi
ence have yet to learn, since as
Monsen says, medical students
are trained to defeat death.
Monsen encouraged the stu
dents gathered before her to
accept the role that death will
inevitably play in their careers as
physicians. She feels it is impor
tant for doctors to inform their
patients of the risks and worst
case scenarios of certain proce
dures, like resuscitation.
"When the cures and the treat
ments run out, we often say that
there's nothing more we can do,"
said Monsen. "I've learned that
there's a tremendous amount
physicians can still do at the end
of life. They can provide comfort
and support, and most important
ly, they can provide guidance [on]
how death might play out."
Chaya Bhuvaneswar, a first
year medical student, found Mon
sen's presentation extremely
helpful. "I was very inspired by
Dr. Monsen," Bhuvaneswar said.
"We have really early clinical
exposure," Bhuvaneswar said. "I
interviewed a patient who was 74,
on a three-times-a-day morphine
drip and who was literally
wracked with pain."
"One of the things we talked
about was how the pain felt, and
it's interesting that we didn't use
the words death or dying," she
said. "I remember feeling really
helpless."
