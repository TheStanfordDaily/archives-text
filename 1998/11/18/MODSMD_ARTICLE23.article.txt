# Drug prevents chronic rejection of transplanted organs
## Keeping organs in working order 
### Greg Miller 
A new study led by Stanford
researchers provides promising evi
dence that a drug called rapamycin
could be used to prevent chronic
rejection of organ transplants.
The research group, which
included 12 researchers from Stan
ford and two from UC-San Francis
co. presented its findings last week
at the annual meeting of the Amer
ican Heart Association.
According to Dr. Randall Mor
ris, professor of cardiothoracic
surgery at Stanford and leader of
the research team, approximately
50,000 organ transplants are con
ducted throughout the world every
year.
Many of these transplants ulti
mately fail because the recipient's
immune system rejects the donated
organ.
The odds that the organ will be
accepted are considerably better if
the donor and recipient are closely
related — identical twins, for exam
ple, have the highest success rate.
However. Morris said, 'in most
people who get an unrelated organ,
from someone totally unrelated, the
organ does fail."
Essentially, the body's immune

system does its job too well when it
rejects organ transplants. The same
immune mechanisms that protect us
from infection attack the transplant
ed organ as if it were an insidious
microbe.
The immune system's assault can
occur immediately after the trans
plant or long afterwards, in process
es termed "acute" and "chronic"
rejection.
Acute rejection results from the
immune system's immediate attack
on the transplanted organ. Without
intervention, this process would
destroy the transplant within weeks.
Fortunately, the development of
drugs that suppress the immune sys
tem has dramatically improved doc
tors' ability to suppress acute rejec
tion.
Chronic rejection occurs over a
more extended period of time.
"The main form of chronic rejec
tion." Morris said, "is injury to the
arteries that go into the organ."
Immune cells in the blood attack
the endothelial cells that line the
arteries that supply blood to the
organ. This kicks off a cascade of
cellular events that leads to a build
up of scar tissue inside the arteries.
Currently there are no drugs
available for treating chronic rejec

tion, Morris said. "No drugs that we
have prevent it. no drugs treat it."
That, in large part, is why the
current study is so important.
Morris and his colleagues creat
ed a form of chronic rejection in 12
monkeys by performing an opera
tion in which a section of the aorta,
the principal artery by which blood
leaves the heart, is transplanted
from one monkey to another. The
research team then tracked the con
dition of the transplanted aorta.
Forty-five days after the trans
plant operation, all 12 monkeys
showed some build-up of scar tissue.
At this point, the group began
administering rapamycin to half of
the monkeys. The other half
received no drugs.
In the untreated group of mon
keys. scar tissue continued to accu
mulate for 60 days. In monkeys that
received rapamycin, however, scar
tissue did not continue to accumu
late. In fact, in some monkeys, the
scarring actually began to shrink.
This study constitutes a number
of firsts, said Morris. "It's the first
study that gives us a test system of
chronic rejection in monkeys." Pre
vious studies of chronic rejection
have been conducted primarily in
rodents.

Unfortunately, drugs that work
well in rodents do not always work
in humans. In the case of transplant
rejection, Morris said, "Monkeys
are highly predictive of what hap
pens in humans, whereas rodents
are not."
Furthermore, he said, this study
is "the first study ever to show a
drug that halts progression of ongo
ing chronic rejection and also
reverses chronic rejection."
Rapamycin may be effective
because it has dual effect. Like
many drugs used to treat acute
organ rejection, it suppresses the
immune system. Unlike these drugs,
rapamycin also interferes with the
cascade of cellular events that leads
to the build-up of scar tissue.
The drug was first discovered in
the 1960s by a Canadian group
searching for soil compounds that
could fight yeast infections.
Rapamycin was named after the
island Rapa Nui, which is the native
name for Easter Island, where the
drug was unearthed in a soil sample.
Further testing must be done
before rapamycin can be approved
for treating chronic rejection in
humans, but Morris said he is opti
mistic that human trials will be initi
ated in the near future.
