# Research team discovers new mutation in HIV virus

A Stanford research team has
found a rare mutation in HIV that
allows it to resist multiple drugs.
Mark Winters, who has a mas
ter's biology from Stanford, led the
research team whose findings were
published this week in the Journal
of Clinical Investigation.
"Now we have data that says you
can add two amino acids to the

[virus], and not only will it still be
functional, it will no longer be sup
pressed by the drugs that regularly
slow it down," Winters said.
Many drugs used to suppress
HIV. the virus that causes AIDS,
work by interfering with an
en/vme —the "machine" of the
virus— made of amino acid building
blocks. However, HIV is notorious
for its ability to develop mutations
that allow it to evade the effects of

these drugs.
Until now, all of the known
changes to the virus have only
involved a substitution of one of the
enzyme's amino acids for another,
called a "point mutation."
The new version of the virus,
identified by Winters' team, is the
first one in which building blocks
have been added to the enzyme.
This action is called an "insertion."
"A lot of people were surprised

to see this because the length of the
protein has never changed before."
said Winters.
The newly discovered mutation
may result in the virus' resistance to
the elass of drugs known as nucleo
side-based reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, according to the study.
Reverse transcriptase is one of
the enzymes that allows HIV to
replicate. The drugs inhibit this
en/vme. stopping the virus from
making new copies of itself.
In the past, mutations in HIV
have typically enabled it to resist
only one of the five currently
licensed anti-HIV drugs
" This is not revolutionary," said
Winters. "[N)ot all patients will be
impacted."
The altered version of HIV
showed up in only about 1 percent
of the patients studied. Winters said
there is probably a set of conditions
under which the multidrug resistant
strain develops, but it is uncertain
what those conditions are.
Although the findings may
appear frightening. Winters sees the
discovery as a helpul one.
"(The mutation] has an unfortu
nate effect, but any information that
will provide better treatment for
patients is a valuable thing," he said.

Most of the data in the study
came from patients whose current
treatment regimens were failing and
whose viral protein sequences were
known.
The development of the HIV
insert is unusual enough not to war
rant a change in initial patient ther
apy. Winters said. Current proto
cols start patients on a "combina
tion" therapy of inhibitor drugs.
In the study, patients who devel
oped the insertion had been treated
with the drug AZT (zidovudine),
typically for several years, and had
gone on to take AZT in combina
tion with either ddl (didanosine) or
ddC (zalcitabine). The researchers
suspect the insert only arises in
patients who have taken these
drugs. Little information is known
about whether other drugs evoke
the mutation.
"Thousands of patients have
been treated like that, and they
haven't developed an insert." Win
ters said. "It's hard to know what
came first — the mutation or the
drug."
There are no guidelines on how
to treat the mutated strain. A class
of drugs that suppresses the virus'
reverse transcriptase enzyme may
be a possible treatment.

A third class of drugs known as
"protease inhibitors" could also be
used to treat patients with the inser
tion. These drugs act on the pro
tease enzyme, a different protein
that is also necessary for successful
HIV replication.
However, it is possible that HIV
could develop resistance to these
other classes of drugs too.
A current study in Stanford labs
is geared specifically towards find
ing out whether new kinds of thera
py will work in patients who have
this new viral strain, according to
Thomas Merigan Jr.. director of the
Center for AIDS Research at Stan
ford and a coauthor of the study.
There is a risk that this new
mechanism of drug resistance will
spread.
"Right now we don't have any
evidence that this will happen, but if
it spreads, it could cause a problem
for more patients on initial infection
when they are first treated." he said.
"The molecule is so flexible that
it can tolerate putting in two extra
amino acids in a part of it.
"This [discovery] is not to make
us concerned," Merigan said, "It's
to make us aware of all the possibil
ities of the virus and the need for
watching it."
