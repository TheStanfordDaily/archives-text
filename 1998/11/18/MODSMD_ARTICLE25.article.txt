■ Saturday: Oregon 8, Stanford 3

Stanford's injury-depleted team
fell 6-3 to Oregon on Friday, after
nearly making a come-from-behind
victory in the second period. The
team returned the next night to face
Oregon State even more short
handed because of injuries sus
tained during Friday's game, and
was blown out, 8-3.
"(The injuries are] making our
third and fourth lines be our first
and second lines," said senior goal
tender turned forward Nick Flores.
"Guys who normally don't see
much time were having to play a
lot," said senior defenseman Paul
Heneman.
In the first game, Stanford strug
gled early against Oregon, giving up
four goals in the first 12 minutes of
play.

"We were really, really flat com
ing out of that game," Heneman
said.
Stanford cut the lead to 4-1 at the
end of the first period on an outside
shot on a power play by Heneman.
The Cardinal turned the game
around in the second period, cutting
the deficit to 4-3 late in the period.
Flores, playing his first game
since suffering a concussion early
this season, scored on the power
play early in the second.
"It was a pretty grubby goal,"
Flores said. "I swiped the goalie's
glove with my stick and knocked
the puck out behind the goalie. We
caught a break because [the goal] is
a real judgment call by the refer
ees."
Right winger graduate student
Bill Ellcrsick followed with a goal
off of a rebound to make the score
4-3.
Oregon, however, countered
with a late second-period goal to
give it a 5-3 advantage.
The third period turned night
marish for Stanford as two key play
ers were forced to leave the game
due to injuries.
Junior center Gabe Miller left
the game after reaggravating an in
jury sustained last weekend and se
nior center and captain Tom Tre
bell will miss three weeks after suf

fering a shoulder injury.
Oregon finished the game with a
late third period goal for the final
score of 6-3.
On Saturday, Stanford played a
solid first period, giving up only one
goal for a 1-0 margin.
The second period, however,
turned out to be disastrous as the
team gave up five additional goals.
"There were 20 shots in the first
period and 20 in the second." Small
said. "Basically, any luck we had ran
out."
"It was just tough because it was
a lot of goals and I just wasn't refo
cussing and the team wasn't refo
cussing," Small added.
Stanford managed to score three
times in the third to cut the lead to 3.
Flores scored on a rebound shot
early in the period.
"Their goalie really was not
strong because he gave up a lot of
rebounds." I lencman said. "Unfor
tunately. we didn't have the fire
power to test him."
Heneman got the last two goals
on outside shots during powerplays
to bring the score to 6-3.
Oregon, however, responded
with two late third-period goals to
make the score 8-3.
Stanford plays a two-game series
against California this Thursday
and Friday.
