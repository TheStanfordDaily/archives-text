# Stanford, Cal officials want peaceful Big Game
## New policies designed to avoid Big Mayhem 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Fearing that the Big Game rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC-Berkeley has in re
cent years turned from friendly to adversari
al. officials from both universities say that
this year they are going to strictly enforce
policies designed to prevent flaring tempers
and violent outbursts.
The Big Game Joint Committee met at
UC-Berkeley yesterday to finalize plans for
Saturday's game. The joint committee in
cludes officials from both universities, repre
sentatives from Stanford's Axe Committee,
UC-Berkeley's Rally Committee and Ath
letics and Police Departments at both
schools.
Dean of Students Marc Wais called the
post-game activities in the past two years
"very troubling" and said that the University
is committed to making sure that this year's
Big Game does not get out of hand.
Two years ago in Memorial Stadium, after
losing the game, a mob of angry Cal fans at
tacked the Tree. Last year Cal fans tore down
one of Stanford Stadium's goal posts after
Cal lost to Stanford.

"There is a much heightened awareness
and concern regarding Big Game this year,"
Wais said. "We do not want either Stanford
or Berkeley or the game itself to be marred
by a tragedy. We are doing everything we can
think of to prevent a tragedy from occurring
at Big Game."
The joint committee has worked to pre
vent harm this year by shortening the post
game celebration from 30 to 15 minutes and
restricting the mascots to their respective
student sections.
In addition the mascots will not be al
lowed to participate in halftime shows, and
the joint committee has taken steps to better
regulate the presentation of the Axe after the
game, according to Axe Committee Chair
Mike Ceballos, a junior.
"Usually the most emotion surrounds the
Tree, the Axe and the Band," Ceballos said.
"It's an attempt to minimize the risk of harm
to those people involved."
Moreover administrators at both univer
sities are meeting with student leaders to
urge them to keep Big Game safe.
Wais said that he and football head coach
Tyrone Willingham plan to meet
with student leaders tonight, in an
effort to help manage activities sur
rounding Big Game.
This is the first time such a meet
ing has taken place prior to Big
Game.
In an advertisement that ran in
the Daily last week and will run
twice more before Big Game, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and UC-Berkeley Chancellor
Robert Berdahl asked members of
both communities to "express their
school spirit, pride and sportsman
ship by celebrating in a safe, posi
tive and friendly manner."
The letter also stated that stu
dents who participate in "incidents
of physical assault or serious prop
erty damage will be ejected from
the game."
The letter said that in such cases
students will be subject to discipli
nary action, including "suspension
or dismissal." These sentiments
were also echoed by Wais.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore, who has represented the
Police Department on the joint
committee for a number of years,
said that he sees the behavior of the
mascots and the parading around
of the Axe following the game as
potential "flashpoints" for post
game incidents.
"We don't want to remove spir
it," Moore said. "But we are look
ing to control the flashpoints."
Moore said that in recent years
the mascots have provoked oppos

ing fans and explained that as a re
sult "fly zones" are going to be en
forced for each of the mascots.
The policy states that if either
mascot leaves the fly zone, that
mascot will be removed from the
"field and / or stadium."
"The fly zone policy has been in
place for a couple of years, but it's
been violated," Moore said. "This
year we really mean it."
When asked whether he intend
ed to remain within the fly zone,
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson, a
junior, said, "I don't intend to be
flying."
Ceballos said that while he sup
ports the enforcement of the fly
zones, he thinks the I ree should be
allowed to participate in the
Band's halftime show.
"1 think that the Tree not being
able to perform is really sad," Ce
ballos said. "It's tradition. The
Tree is the Band's mascot."
"People said they felt it would
infuriate Cal fans more to see the
Tree in the show. I think that the
Cal fans are going to have the same
feelings regardless of whether or
not the Tree performs," Ceballos
added.
Henderson added that he will
be subject to an unprecedented
breathalyzer test prior to the game.
Despite the restrictions, Hen
derson said, "I'll be there, and
they'll tell me what I can and can't
do, and I'll do a little bit of both,
and we'll see how things turn out."
Members of the joint committee
further felt that a quick transition
between the end of the game and
the post-game celebration and a
smooth exchange of the Axe, if

necessary, could help maintain
order.
"In the past there have been de
lays in bringing the Axe out,"
Moore said.
"We want the Axe to be
brought out as quickly as possible.
The [joint) committee has worked
out a plan to facilitate quick entry
of the Axe Committees on to the
field after the game."
Searches at the gates of the stu
dent sections will be more strict
this year, Ceballos said, and water
bottles sold at the game will be sold
without caps.
"You can't throw a hottle with
out a top as far," Ceballos ex
plained.
Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington said that as in previous
years his department has stepped
up patrols on campus this week to
prevent vandalism.

'I think that the Cal fans are
going to have the same
feelings regardless of
whether or not the Tree
performs.'

"The routine is pretty standard
now," Herrington said. "We will
also send a unit to the game to
work under the direction of the
DC-Berkeley Police. They do the
same thing when the game is here."
Herrington added that after the
game he expects that the Stanford
Police will he "protecting the Axe
as it comes back to Stanford."
