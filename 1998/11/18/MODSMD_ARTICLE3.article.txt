## New policies designed to avoid Big Mayhem 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Fearing that the Big Game rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC-Berkeley has in re
cent years turned from friendly to adversari
al. officials from both universities say that
this year they are going to strictly enforce
policies designed to prevent flaring tempers
and violent outbursts.
The Big Game Joint Committee met at
UC-Berkeley yesterday to finalize plans for
Saturday's game. The joint committee in
cludes officials from both universities, repre
sentatives from Stanford's Axe Committee,
UC-Berkeley's Rally Committee and Ath
letics and Police Departments at both
schools.
Dean of Students Marc Wais called the
post-game activities in the past two years
"very troubling" and said that the University
is committed to making sure that this year's
Big Game does not get out of hand.
Two years ago in Memorial Stadium, after
losing the game, a mob of angry Cal fans at
tacked the Tree. Last year Cal fans tore down
one of Stanford Stadium's goal posts after
Cal lost to Stanford.

"There is a much heightened awareness
and concern regarding Big Game this year,"
Wais said. "We do not want either Stanford
or Berkeley or the game itself to be marred
by a tragedy. We are doing everything we can
think of to prevent a tragedy from occurring
at Big Game."
The joint committee has worked to pre
vent harm this year by shortening the post
game celebration from 30 to 15 minutes and
restricting the mascots to their respective
student sections.
In addition the mascots will not be al
lowed to participate in halftime shows, and
the joint committee has taken steps to better
regulate the presentation of the Axe after the
game, according to Axe Committee Chair
Mike Ceballos, a junior.
"Usually the most emotion surrounds the
Tree, the Axe and the Band," Ceballos said.
"It's an attempt to minimize the risk of harm
to those people involved."
Moreover administrators at both univer
sities are meeting with student leaders to
urge them to keep Big Game safe.
