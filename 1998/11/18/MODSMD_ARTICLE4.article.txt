# A 						Hobbes on rye?
## Poli Sci Cafe adds themed sandwiches to menu 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
The meaning is in the meat at the Political
Science Cafe. But ordering a "Rawls' Veiled
Sandwich" from this eclectic eatery means that
the meat is a mystery.
According to 20th century philosopher
John Rawls' theory of justice, a truly just soci
ety is impossible because people will always be
biased. The best way to approximate a just so
ciety is to assume a veil of ignorance.
Rawls' veiled sandwich is a sourdough roll
tilled with the server's choice of meat, cheese
and condiments. Pay first, then find out what's
between the buns.
Rawls' veiled sandwich is but one of seven
new hoagies added last Monday to the menu at
the Political Science Cafe. The hoagies are
called "Machiavelli's Prince." "Rawls' Veiled
Sandwich." "Hobbes' Leviathan," "Aristotle's
Sampler," "Burke's Regular," "Paine's Spe
cial" and "Rousseau's Veggie." It marks per
haps the shrewdest marketing move ever made
by a Stanford lunchroom.
"They're very — philosophical," said Polit
ical Science Prof. Doug Rivers. "It's a clever
marketing ploy."

sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise
piled on a sourdough roll, with pickles and
peperoncini on the side. The contents of the
Rawls' sandwich vary each day.
"Did she ask you if you wanted pickles with
that?" asked Ron Hassner, a doctoral student
in the Political Science Department. "Normal
ly they do. But since this is Rawls' sandwich,
you have no choice," Hassner explained.

sandwiches were introduced, said
Political Science Cafe manager
Linda Minister.
"We've made it easy for [the cus
tomers]," Minister said as a cus
tomer ordered a Burke. "Now they
can just order a Burke's instead of a
bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich
with mayonnaise."
The theme sandwiches are the
brainchild of Steven Kelts. Ron Has
sner. and Gregory Davis, currently
doctoral students in Political Sci
ence, and Naomi Levy, who got her
master's in June.
The four dreamed up the plan last
year as they sat around after a class
on political theory taught by Political
Science Prof. Susan Okin, Senior
Lecturer Elisabeth Hansot and
(iuest Lecturer Norman Jacobson.
The foursome wondered what the
ideal meal for each political theorist
would be.
The sandwiches hlend both the
philosophers' ideas and nationali
ties.
For example, Thomas Hobbes
believed in the power of a large gov
ernment. Therefore, "Hobbes'
Leviathan" is a stout double-decker
sandwich made with traditionally
British elements — roast beef, Ched
dar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes,
sprouts, mustard and cranberry
sauce on dark rye, the latter repre
senting Hobbes' pessimism.
Another British theorist received
similar treatment. "[Edmund]
Burke is a traditionalist," Hassner
said.

"He didn't want England to
change. So if you ask for a Burke's
regular with cheese, you will be re
fused, because that's change."
Conversely, Paine's special is a
modernized Burke's — avocado is
added.
A student and a professor from
outside the political science depart
ment pondered the meaning of
lunch as they stood in line and be
held the new offerings.
The meanings behind the names
of the sandwiches can at times seem
a bit arcane even to a Stanford pro
fessor.
"I can't figure out the linkage be
tween the name and the contents,"
said History Prof. Joe Corn.
"I'm not sure about Rousseau,
but Hobbes' Leviathan' is easy,"
said Sarah Benor. a graduate stu
dent in linguistics. "It's big."
"Rousseau — that must have
something to do with the state of na
ture."
"I laughed when I saw these."
Benor said. "I studied [these
philosophers] as an undergrad at
Columbia."
The Political Science Cafe is not
the only joint on campus to offer
niche-named sandwiches. For ex
ample, Cubberlv Cafe in the School
of Education has been offering
sandwiches named Stanford, Cub
berly, Petaluma, Salinas and Pacifi
ca since it reopened in January after
remodeling.
I he contents of the Cubberly
sandwiches do not, however, reflect
their namesake cities.
"We just made it up." said Cub
berly Cafe employee DaVennia
Washington as she worked the cash

register.
The composition of the Cubberly
sandwiches might not reflect their
nomenclature, but the connections
between the sandwiches and the
philosophers at the Folical Science
Cafe are subtle, yet sensible.
" The Machiavelli. is essentially a
nasty sandwich," Hassner said.
Machiavellian ideology advances
rule by the iron-fisted.
"Machiavelli's Prince" is made of
ham and provolone cheese on an
onion roll, with mustard, onions,
horseradish and hot peppers. Italian
ingredients that nod toward Machi
avelli's heritage.
Whether in spite of or because of
its pungent ingredients. Political Sci
ence Cafe employees said it has
proven to be the most popular of the
new offerings.
When asked what he thought of
the new sandwiches. Political Sci
ence Cafe employee Jose Hernan
dez said, "It's a bit more work, but
the people like them. There are
some things that are different, like
the cranberry sauce."
Another Political Science Cafe
employee, Lupe Perez, who pre
pares many of the sandwiches to
order, agreed.
"Well, they're OK," she said.
"I'm getting used to it."
The sandwiches range in price
lrom $2.70 to $5. The new items
have been successful and will re
main on the Political Science Cafe's
menu indefinitely.
More philosophers may be
added eventually, Minister said.
"If one sandwich seems less pop

another," she added.
