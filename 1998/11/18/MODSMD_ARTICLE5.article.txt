# Group shares passion for space

### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
Instead of sleeping or studying
last night, a handful of members of
Students for the Exploration and
Development of Space met at
Tresidder Union and hiked into
nearby hills to catch a glimpse of this
week's meteor shower.
"I was really excited to be able to
do this," said Kim Winges, the club's
vice president. " This was the biggest
meteor shower in 33 years, quite an
event to watch. I'm fascinated by just
being able to see all of this in the
sky."
The Stanford chapter of SEDS,
led by senior Leland Cheung, offi
cially formed at the end of spring
quarter.
Besides viewing rare events such
as the shower, the club invites guest
speakers to campus, organizes trips
to local space facilities and provides
an opportunity for anyone with a
love of space to meet with others

who share their hobby.
"We started the club, the only o- â€¢
of its kind [on campus), because
there was a large interest in space at
Stanford." Cheung said. "We're
hoping to satisfy that interest."
SEDS is actually an international
organization, witli chapters every
where from the United Kingdom
and the Republic ol Ireland to Rus
sia. The club was founded in I WO a'
MIT and Princeton, and the perma
nent national headquarters is at
MIT.
Membership is open to those who
are enthusiastic about space explo
ration. according to national Direc
tor of Chapter Expansion Mark
Ciotola.
"The goal of SEDS is to educate
students from high schoolers to col
lege graduates," he said.
Three types ol people typically
join the club, Ciotola added.
"First, there are those interested
in astronomy, those who gaze at the
stars in wonder," he said. "Then,

there iire the engineers, who are in
terested in building space-related
objects. Third. there are those inter
ested in the Earth's future and curi
ous about how space can actually
help keep society going."
Once members of the Stanford
chapter, students typically communi
cate using e-mail, sharing ideas about
future trips and plans, Winges said.
"We try to organize anything
space-related 011 campus." she said.
"For instance, we're taking a trip this
weekend to see the Titan launch."
Cheung said one of the biggest
events last spring for the local chap
ter of SEDS was the visit of David
Morrison. d irector of space at NAS A
Ames Research Center, who spoke
011 the impact of asteroids hitting the
earth.
This year the club tentatively
plans to organize a space writing
competition with science fiction
magazines, to hold a model rocket
competition and to invite speakers
from various space-related agencies,
such as NASA and the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
On a broader spectrum the in
ternational SEDS organization sent
a satellite into orbit.

"We launched this satellite on
Oct. 25, literally (Jays before John
Glenn headed into space," Ciotola
said. "This satellite takes images of
the Earth and is also helpful to ham
radio enthusiasts."
Ciotola said that one of the most
exciting things about the club is the
intellectual curiosity of its members.
"We work on ideas like figuring
out how to get people to the moon

and Mars," he said. "A lot of people
have an interest in space other than
watching 'Star Wars,' and those
working on these kinds of projects
really distinguish themselves from
others."
According to ( Tieung, one of the
benefits of being a member is inter
acting with others interested in space
beyond the college environment.
"What's great is the exposure to

the space community outside of
Stanford," he said. "I really learn
more about what's going on in space,
both in exploration and develop
ment. and 1 hope to enter the busi
ness alter leaving Stanford."
Club secretary Felicia Tam
agreed.
"In the future, I'm planning on
going into astronomy," she said.
"This club is a good resource for get

ting to know people in the field."
While many involved in SEDS do
plan on exploring the space field
after graduation, others are involved
simply because they love the idea of
watching the stars and delving into
the unknown.
"I've been interested in space
since seventh grade when I won an
essay contest with NASA," Winges
said. "1 find the star-gazing aspect

fascinating, and I enjoy thinking
about where life originated with re
spect to space."
Winges maintains that SEDS pro
vides her with a way to explore that
which she enjoys most.
"I don't want to be a physicist,"
she said. "That's too constricting for
me. But my greatest passion is as
tronomy. and this gives me an outlet
for my interest."
