Instead of sleeping or studying
last night, a handful of members of
Students for the Exploration and
Development of Space met at
Tresidder Union and hiked into
nearby hills to catch a glimpse of this
week's meteor shower.
"I was really excited to be able to
do this," said Kim Winges, the club's
vice president. " This was the biggest
meteor shower in 33 years, quite an
event to watch. I'm fascinated by just
being able to see all of this in the
sky."
The Stanford chapter of SEDS,
led by senior Leland Cheung, offi
cially formed at the end of spring
quarter.
Besides viewing rare events such
as the shower, the club invites guest
speakers to campus, organizes trips
to local space facilities and provides
an opportunity for anyone with a
love of space to meet with others

who share their hobby.
"We started the club, the only o- â€¢
of its kind [on campus), because
there was a large interest in space at
Stanford." Cheung said. "We're
hoping to satisfy that interest."
SEDS is actually an international
organization, witli chapters every
where from the United Kingdom
and the Republic ol Ireland to Rus
sia. The club was founded in I WO a'
MIT and Princeton, and the perma
nent national headquarters is at
MIT.
Membership is open to those who
are enthusiastic about space explo
ration. according to national Direc
tor of Chapter Expansion Mark
Ciotola.
"The goal of SEDS is to educate
students from high schoolers to col
lege graduates," he said.
Three types ol people typically
join the club, Ciotola added.
"First, there are those interested
in astronomy, those who gaze at the
stars in wonder," he said. "Then,

there iire the engineers, who are in
terested in building space-related
objects. Third. there are those inter
ested in the Earth's future and curi
ous about how space can actually
help keep society going."
Once members of the Stanford
chapter, students typically communi
cate using e-mail, sharing ideas about
future trips and plans, Winges said.
"We try to organize anything
space-related 011 campus." she said.
"For instance, we're taking a trip this
weekend to see the Titan launch."
Cheung said one of the biggest
events last spring for the local chap
ter of SEDS was the visit of David
Morrison. d irector of space at NAS A
Ames Research Center, who spoke
011 the impact of asteroids hitting the
earth.
This year the club tentatively
plans to organize a space writing
competition with science fiction
magazines, to hold a model rocket
