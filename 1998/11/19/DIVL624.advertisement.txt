The only thing better
than an iMac:
An iMac for
$1199
Apple® Computer couldn't make iMac" any easier to set up or use. So they made it easier to buy.
Now, if you're a student, you can get an iMac for less than $29.99 per month; with the first
payment not due for 120 days. For about what you'd spend on a few pizzas, you can have a superfast
computer that can get you onto the internet in 10 minutes right out of the box. You also get a
coupon book with $2,000 in possible additional savings, for things like software, games and accessories.
Come try an iMac for yourself at:
