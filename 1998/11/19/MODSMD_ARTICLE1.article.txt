# LGBCC questions emerge
## Resignation of director leaves a cloudy picture 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
In the wake of Gwendolyn Dean's resignation
from the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
terxlirectorship. the lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity has raised several issues concerning the possible
reasons for her departure.
In comments to LGBCC members at a closed
meeting Tuesday night and in a separate talk with
Dean of Students Marc Wais, Dean asserted that the
strongest factor prompting her to leave was the avail
ablejdirectorship of Cornell University's Lesbian, Gay
Bisexual Resource Center, a position that she was of
fered and has accepted.
The fact that Dean will be leaving Stanford's part
time director position for a full-time occupation with
similar responsibilities has caused concern among
some members of the community, who feel that the
University has not made enough efforts to allocate
funds for a full-time position.
"The Cornell position was a better job than the job
Stanford is offering," said junior Chester Day, who
volunteers at the center. "I feel that a lot of other rep
utable universities have full-time directors [at their
centers], and Stanford should follow that up."
The main hindrance in forming the full-time direc
torship that LGBCC members have been requesting
for several years has been its funding. University offi
cials maintain that there is not adequate funding avail
able for a full-time position.
"While I can justify a need for the LGBCC to have
a full-time director, just as I can justify more staffing
for the Women's Center and the other centers. I am
balancing these important needs across the full range
of needs for student services, ranging from financial
aid to adaptive technology for our disabled communi
ty and to housing for graduate students," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya.
"I am pleased that we were able to take a step to
support the needs of our LGB community last year. I
am disappointed that Gwendolyn didn't stay with us.
Nonetheless, we remain committed to finding the best
possible person to fill that role."
"Right now, this position is pretty much set as a half
time position." added Troy Gilbert, assistant to Mon
toya. " The LGBCC has attracted a number of small
gifts, but it's a big leap to fund something that large."
