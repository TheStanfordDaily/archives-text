# LGBCC questions emerge
## Resignation of director leaves a cloudy picture 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Staff writer 
In the wake of Gwendolyn Dean's resignation
from the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
terxlirectorship. the lesbian, gay and bisexual commu
nity has raised several issues concerning the possible
reasons for her departure.
In comments to LGBCC members at a closed
meeting Tuesday night and in a separate talk with
Dean of Students Marc Wais, Dean asserted that the
strongest factor prompting her to leave was the avail
ablejdirectorship of Cornell University's Lesbian, Gay
Bisexual Resource Center, a position that she was of
fered and has accepted.
The fact that Dean will be leaving Stanford's part
time director position for a full-time occupation with
similar responsibilities has caused concern among
some members of the community, who feel that the
University has not made enough efforts to allocate
funds for a full-time position.
"The Cornell position was a better job than the job
Stanford is offering," said junior Chester Day, who
volunteers at the center. "I feel that a lot of other rep
utable universities have full-time directors [at their
centers], and Stanford should follow that up."
The main hindrance in forming the full-time direc
torship that LGBCC members have been requesting
for several years has been its funding. University offi
cials maintain that there is not adequate funding avail
able for a full-time position.
"While I can justify a need for the LGBCC to have
a full-time director, just as I can justify more staffing
for the Women's Center and the other centers. I am
balancing these important needs across the full range
of needs for student services, ranging from financial
aid to adaptive technology for our disabled communi
ty and to housing for graduate students," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya.
"I am pleased that we were able to take a step to
support the needs of our LGB community last year. I
am disappointed that Gwendolyn didn't stay with us.
Nonetheless, we remain committed to finding the best
possible person to fill that role."
"Right now, this position is pretty much set as a half
time position." added Troy Gilbert, assistant to Mon
toya. " The LGBCC has attracted a number of small
gifts, but it's a big leap to fund something that large."
Individual donations
The principal gift that has come into question has
been one offered bv 1980 MBA Scott Wallace, who is
the president of the Wallace Theater
Corporation and is currently work
ing on funding two fellowships at the
Graduate School of Business.
Wallace said that in December of
1997 he talked to Montoya about
donating $10,(XX) per year for two
years toward funding a full-time di
rectorship at the center. He also sug
gested that Montoya find another
donor to fund whatever difference
should arise.
"I told [Montoya] that 1 would
consider a larger commitment to the
LGBCC after the two-year period,"
Wallace said. "He thanked me for
my offer and said he would get back
to me. I did not speak with him again
until the 199S LGBCC dinner where
we spoke only briefly, but there was
no mention of my previous offer."
Gilbert said that while Wallace's
gift was generous, "S2(),(XX) is not
near the amount it would take to
fund a full-time directorship."
While Wallace feels that there
may be many potential donors in the
lesbian, gay and bisexual alumni
community, Gilbert says that this is
not necessarily the case at the mo
ment.
"It's a matter of building an alum
ni base for the center, which we
don't necessarily have," he said.
"The whole process takes a great

deal of fundraising, and alumni have
to be engaged to give money over a
long period of time."
While LGBCC members do ac
knowledge this, some are concerned
with the administration's failure to
pursue Wallace's offer.
"I personally feel that [adminis
trators] have not acted in good faith
in regards to pursuing funding," said
Day."I don't think people expected
that [the $20,(XX)] was supposed to
be the sole source [for funding the
directorship). But the fact that this
donation was never pursued, the fact
that however small the amount was,
it wasn't accepted toward the direc
torship, makes me wonder whether
[Montoya] looked for sufficient
funds before telling the LGB com
munity that there weren't any avail
able."
Montoya, however, insists the
opposite. In a letter dated Dec. 4
1997, in which he addressed an
LGBCC committee that created a
proposal for a full-time director, he
said that he was looking into a vari
ety of sources.
"Several alumni have been in
touch with me indicating their inter
est in supporting the work of the
LGBT Community Center and the
new director," he wrote. "I will con
tinue these conversations with alum
ni with the hope that additional
funds will be available to support the
Center."
Since then, Montoya says that he

"investigated a number of funding
options for the LGBCC directorship
last year. There are a couple of alum
ni who have expressed interest in
contributing to the position. Howev
er, as supportive as our LGB alumni
are, we have nowhere near the
amount it would take to actually
endow a full-time or half-time posi
tion."
Reasons for Dean's departure
Dean was not available for com
ment concerning her departure, an
action that has evidently caused a
number of reverberating side issues
to arise.
LGBCC members have voiced
concerns that Dean may have left
due to the lack of funding available
to the center, something they hope
to avert when a new director is
found.
"[Dean] voiced to me ... that it's
hard to do a quality job with inade
quate funding at a half-time posi
tion," said Zack Allen, a first-year
master's student in Latin American
studies.
Wais acknowledges the lack of
funding for the LGBCC, but does
not believe that was a factor in
Dean's departure. "Funding was not
an issue," he said. "When [Dean) ac
cepted the position, she knew the
level of funding available, and she
understood the context of the posi
tion and the programmatic budget.

She expected it, so I don't think that
is what caused her to leave."
Finding a replacement
For now, a temporary replace
ment director will be appointed until
the re-hiring process, under Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves, is
complete and a permanent director
is found.
Wais and Montoya said that they
are currently obtaining student feed
back and taking into account some
of Dean's suggestions for the.direc
torship.
Allen Drexel, a Law School stu
dent and chair of OutLaw (Stanford
Law Students for Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Equality), said that in
Dean's short tenure at the LGBCC,
she proved to be "capable, warm,
hard-working and a consistent
source of support."
"[Dean] had plans to do all sorts of
programs here, and it is really unfor
tunate she did not have the chance to
do so," Drexel said. "One of the
things she really wanted to do was
sensitivity training with professors."
Administrators, too, are disap
pointed with the loss. "[Dean] was
the unanimous choice of the search
committee," Wais said. "She came
highly recommended, and we were
very excited about her coming here.
It's an extreme disappointment that
her tenure here was so short."

time position." added Troy Gilbert, assistant to Mon
toya. " The LGBCC has attracted a number of small
gifts, but it's a big leap to fund something that large."
Individual donations
The principal gift that has come into question has
been one offered bv 1980 MBA Scott Wallace, who is
the president of the Wallace Theater
Corporation and is currently work
ing on funding two fellowships at the
Graduate School of Business.
Wallace said that in December of
1997 he talked to Montoya about
donating $10,(XX) per year for two
years toward funding a full-time di
rectorship at the center. He also sug
gested that Montoya find another
donor to fund whatever difference
should arise.
"I told [Montoya] that 1 would
consider a larger commitment to the
LGBCC after the two-year period,"
Wallace said. "He thanked me for
my offer and said he would get back
to me. I did not speak with him again
until the 199S LGBCC dinner where
we spoke only briefly, but there was
no mention of my previous offer."
Gilbert said that while Wallace's
gift was generous, "S2(),(XX) is not
near the amount it would take to
fund a full-time directorship."
While Wallace feels that there
may be many potential donors in the
lesbian, gay and bisexual alumni
community, Gilbert says that this is
not necessarily the case at the mo
ment.
"It's a matter of building an alum
ni base for the center, which we
don't necessarily have," he said.
"The whole process takes a great

deal of fundraising, and alumni have
to be engaged to give money over a
long period of time."
While LGBCC members do ac
knowledge this, some are concerned
with the administration's failure to
pursue Wallace's offer.
"I personally feel that [adminis
trators] have not acted in good faith
in regards to pursuing funding," said
Day."I don't think people expected
that [the $20,(XX)] was supposed to
be the sole source [for funding the
directorship). But the fact that this
donation was never pursued, the fact
that however small the amount was,
it wasn't accepted toward the direc
torship, makes me wonder whether
[Montoya] looked for sufficient
funds before telling the LGB com
munity that there weren't any avail
able."
Montoya, however, insists the
opposite. In a letter dated Dec. 4
1997, in which he addressed an
LGBCC committee that created a
proposal for a full-time director, he
said that he was looking into a vari
ety of sources.
"Several alumni have been in
touch with me indicating their inter
est in supporting the work of the
LGBT Community Center and the
new director," he wrote. "I will con
tinue these conversations with alum
ni with the hope that additional
funds will be available to support the
Center."
Since then, Montoya says that he

"investigated a number of funding
options for the LGBCC directorship
last year. There are a couple of alum
ni who have expressed interest in
contributing to the position. Howev
er, as supportive as our LGB alumni
are, we have nowhere near the
amount it would take to actually
endow a full-time or half-time posi
tion."
Reasons for Dean's departure
Dean was not available for com
ment concerning her departure, an
action that has evidently caused a
number of reverberating side issues
to arise.
LGBCC members have voiced
concerns that Dean may have left
due to the lack of funding available
to the center, something they hope
to avert when a new director is
found.
"[Dean] voiced to me ... that it's
hard to do a quality job with inade
quate funding at a half-time posi
tion," said Zack Allen, a first-year
master's student in Latin American
studies.
Wais acknowledges the lack of
funding for the LGBCC, but does
not believe that was a factor in
Dean's departure. "Funding was not
an issue," he said. "When [Dean) ac
cepted the position, she knew the
level of funding available, and she
understood the context of the posi
tion and the programmatic budget.

She expected it, so I don't think that
is what caused her to leave."
Finding a replacement
For now, a temporary replace
ment director will be appointed until
the re-hiring process, under Assoc.
Dean of Students Morris Graves, is
complete and a permanent director
is found.
Wais and Montoya said that they
are currently obtaining student feed
back and taking into account some
of Dean's suggestions for the.direc
torship.
Allen Drexel, a Law School stu
dent and chair of OutLaw (Stanford
Law Students for Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Equality), said that in
Dean's short tenure at the LGBCC,
she proved to be "capable, warm,
hard-working and a consistent
source of support."
"[Dean] had plans to do all sorts of
programs here, and it is really unfor
tunate she did not have the chance to
do so," Drexel said. "One of the
things she really wanted to do was
sensitivity training with professors."
Administrators, too, are disap
pointed with the loss. "[Dean] was
the unanimous choice of the search
committee," Wais said. "She came
highly recommended, and we were
very excited about her coming here.
It's an extreme disappointment that
her tenure here was so short."
