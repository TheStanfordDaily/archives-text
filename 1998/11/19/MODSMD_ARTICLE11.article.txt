' WASHINGTON (AF) — Prosecutor Kenneth Starr
was given leeway Wednesday to reach beyond the Mon
ica Lewinsky matter in making his case at presidential
impeachment hearings as Republicans moved it) sum
mon the president's private lawyer and closest confidant.
House Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde
said majority Republicans probably would vote Thurs
day on subpoenas lor White House deputy counsel
Bruce Lindsev, the president's most trusted adviser, and
tor attorney Robert Bennett, who represented ('linton in
the Paula Jones lawsuit.
The committee also plans to question Daniel Gecker,
tlje lawyer for Clinton accuser Kathleen Willey, and
Nathan Landow. a Maryland Democrat who had con
tacts with Mrs. Willey. She has accused the president of
a sexual advance inside the White 1 louse.
, The Republicans also showed a belated interest in
t'und-raising allegations against the president.
Hyde asked the Justice Department for a prosecu
tor's memo that provided a detailed argument for
appointing an independent counsel to take over the
criminal investigation of Democratic fund-raising abus
es. a committee official told The Associated Press.
The official, speaking only on condition of anonymi
ty. said the Justice Department was weighing the
request. Attorney General Janet Reno currently has
three separate inquiries under way to determine whether
an independent counsel should be named to take over
the fund-raising investigation.
As for Starr's appearance as the leadoff witness in
Thursday's hearing, Hyde said: "He's the one person
other than the parties themselves who knows the most
about this. I le spent a long time and lots of money. We'd
like to know just what he found."
With Republicans and Democrats readying for a par
tisan fight, Starr prepared a presentation that would por
tray the I .ewinsky matter as the core of a pattern of lying
and obstruction of justice.

Clinton himself was thousands of miles away on a trip
to Asia.
Hyde. R-111., has afforded Starr two hours to give his
evidence to members of the committee. Starr's presenta
tion will he followed by questions from committee inves
tigators, lawmakers and — lastly — Clinton private
lawyer David Kendall.
Starr's appearance, at only the third presidential
impeachment inquiry in the nation's history, "won't be a
straight recitation"' of his written report submitted in
September, said his spokesman, Charles Bakaly.
The independent counsel, who recommended 11
grounds for possible impeachment, will "try to give some
historical context to the allegations," Bakaly said.
Democrats were infuriated that Starr was given
authority by Hyde to delve into matters such as the
Whitewater real estate transactions, misuse of FBI files,
firings at the White House travel office and payments to
presidential friend Webster Hubbell.
" This is an impeachment in search of a crime," com
plained James Jordan, spokesman for Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee.
The Clinton administration, given 30 minutes to
cross-examine Starr, assigned Kendall — who has
accused Starr of leaking grand jury material and has
relentlessly pursued a contempt of court motion against
him.
Hyde was both conciliatory and unbending in an
impromptu news conference. Asked whether he would
place limits on Starr, he responded, "Why should I?"
The chairman promised, however, to be "liberal"
with Kendall's half-hour time limit. "If they're on a line
of questioning and they need more time, I will grant
them more time. I wish to control the time. They're not
being mistreated at all."
On Tuesday, Hyde wrote the White House that Clin
ton's lawyer wouldn't be allowed to question Starr about
the various controversies surrounding his investigation.
