# Livingston named Speaker
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Bob Livingston col
lected unanimous Republican backing Wednesday to
become House speaker and quickly pledged action in
the new Congress to cut taxes and preserve Social Secu
rity. i.C. Watts, the only black among 223 GOP law
makers, won a leadership post, too.
"There are some who insist the Republican era is
over," Livingston, R-La., told fellow GOP lawmakers
still reeling from the loss of seats in this month's elec
tions. "But that's like saying the American dream is over.
It isn't true, and they know it."
He pledged cooperation with the Democrats, then
added, "We will do so to advance Republican princi
ples" of less government.
Livingston. 55, a pragmatic conservative and chair
man of the Appropriations Committee with a history of
working with Democrats, was nominated without oppo
sition tii succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker. Gingrich
bade farewell to the Republicans whom he led to power
four years ago, handed a gavel to Livingston to signal the
shift in power, then left Washington with his wife for a
Florida vacation.
"Bob Livingston is totally in control right now," Rep.
Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y. declared in the corridor out
side the meeting room, even though Livingston's formal
ascension won't occur until Congress convenes on Jan. 6.
Livingston's victory was sealed nearly two weeks ago
when Gingrich stunned Republicans with a decision to
step down. The Louisianan had already begun cam
paigning for votes, and he quickly cleared the field of
opponents.
But there were lively races for other leadership posts
as Republicans sought to retool for the congressional
session over the next two years, and the elections in 2000.
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas was re-elect
ed, but needed three ballots before vanquishing Reps.

Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Jennifer Dunn of Washing
ton and J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the chief deputy
whip whose name was offered by other lawmakers in a
draft effort. Armey's margin of victory was 127-95 over
Largent on the final ballot, after the low vote recipient
dropped off following previous rounds.
Rep. Tom DeLay, the GOP whip, was re-elected
without opposition.
Watts' victory as new chairman of the GOP confer
ence, or caucus, came at the expense of Ohio Rep. John
Boehner, who was seeking his third term. Watts, a tele
genic former University of Oklahoma football star, tri
umphed. 121-93, a victory made sweeter because it fell
on his 41st birthday. Whatever his formal leadership
duties. Watts is likely to become a familiar face on tele
vision and before Republican audiences around the
country as the party seeks to broaden its appeal.
"I think it's good for the Republican Party for Amer
ica to know that the Republican Party — that we're a
party of men and women, and red. yellow, brown, black
and white Americans," he told reporters.
Rep. John Linder of Georgia, whom Gingrich had
tapped to head the campaign committee, was also swept
from office by Republicans seeking new leadership. Rep.
Tom Davis of Virginia toppled him, with a strong assist
from DeLay. Hastert retained his leadership post.
"People were ready lor a change," said Rep. Matt
Salmon of Arizona after Watts' victory.
They got it. too, beginning at the top. where Liv
ingston has pledged a more businesslike, less revolution
ary political style than Gingrich practiced.
In departing. Gingrich — who frequently struggled to
hold a fractious rank-and-file together — said Liv
ingston's success will "depend in large measure on
whether the people in the room stand united," according
to Republican Ray LaHood of Illinois.
