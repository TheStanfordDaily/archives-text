# Population could shoot up by 50 percent over next 50 years

WASHINGTON (AP) — By
2050, the United States population
will grow to 394 million, some 50
percent more than at present, the
Census Bureau projects in a new
population profile.
And this population will he
older, on average, than now and will
contain a larger share of minorities.
The elderly are expected to dou
ble their share of the population in
more than one-third of the states,
and the fastest rates of growth for
minorities are expected for Hispan
ic, Asian and Pacific Islander popu
lations.
California is expected to contin
ue rapid growth, adding 17.7 million
people between 1995 and 2025, the
agency said. Texas is expected to
grow by 8.46 million in that period
and Florida will add 6.54 million.
The new projections are con

taincd in a wide-ranging new profile
of the nation by the numbers.
Compiled from census and gov
ernment survey data, the profile
contains sections on national and
state population trends and projec
tions, geographic mobility, school
enrollment, educational attainment,
households and families, marital
status and living arrangements, fer
tility, child care arrangements and
dozens of other topics.
Already the country's popula
tion has grown nearly 18 million
since the 1990 census, the report
notes, but the rate of increase is
slower now than it was in the early
19905, falling from 1.02 percent in
1990 to 0.88 percent in 1996.
That's because fewer people are
being born and more dying as the
population ages.
In particular, the massive Baby

Boom generation born in the years
following World War II is moving
into its less fertile years.
On Jan. 1. 1997, there were
27,090,000 women in the prime
childbearing ages of 15 to 29. That's
1,637,000 fewer than in 1990.
There were 4.15 million births in
1990. compared with 3.85 million in
1996.
At the same tirnd. the number of
deaths rose from 2.16 million in
1990 to 2.35 million in 1996.
The report also found that the
nation's 273 metropolitan areas
contain nearly 80 percent of the
population as of 1996. with a total of
211.9 million of the 265.3 million
Americans. Between 1990 and
1996. the nation's population
increased 6.7 percent while
metropolitan areas grew by 6.9 per
cent.
