KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
(AP) â€” The skyscrapers are half
empty here, and the jobs are disap
pearing. Compare that to America,
where the stoek market lias
bounced back and unemployment is
at historic lows.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's description of the
United States as an "oasis of pros
perity" in a troubled world doesn't
even begin to describe the huge gulf
between America's good times and
inanv other nations' hard times.

In all. 40 percent of the world is
in recession, and this region is
ground zero of the suffering.
Indeed. Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea have
gone beyond recessions to outright
depressions, rivaling America's
Great Depression of the 19305.
The disparity is causing prob
lems as officials try It) come up with
solutions to help the countries in
trouble.
For two decades, the Asian tiger
nations'eeonomies grew faster than

any others. Symbols of that past
growth were everywhere as leaders
of the Asia Pacific Economic Coop
eration summit met here to discuss
the global economic crisis.
Vice President Al Gore met with
other leaders at an opulent hotel,
just one of many added to a Kuala
Lumpur skyline that boasts the
world's tallest skyscrapers, the twin
Petronas towers.
But many of the big office towers
now stand half empty. Construction
cranes are idle, food staples such as

Hour and oil have been in short sup
ply and unemployment has doubled
in a year.
In Thailand, 250,000 children
have been taken out of school
because their families can't afford
tuition. In South Korea, 2.2 million
workers have been laid off as the
country's once mighty corporate
giants face painful futures.
The economic upheaval will
plunge 50 million people back into
poverty, wiping out decades of
progress in raising living standards.

the World Bank estimates.
Economic output already has
fallen 17 percent in Indonesia and
around 7 percent in Malaysia. South
Korea and Thailand. In the United
States a decline of just 0.9 percent in
the last recession was severe
enough to prompt voters to turn
President Bush out of office.
And today, in stark contrast to
Asia, the U.S. economy is roaring
through its eighth consecutive year
of economic growth, a peacetime
record.

That doesn't mean the United
States has been untouched. In
Washington, the government
reported Wednesday that the U.S.
trade deficit so far this year is run
ning at a record annual rate of $166
billion, a whopping 50 percent high
er than last year.
The growing deficit reflects
Asia's troubles. American farmers
and factories have lost valuable
export markets as the steep Asian
recessions have cut into demand for
U.S. products.
