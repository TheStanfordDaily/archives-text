Scientists claim to find doomsday rock fragments
The evidence is no larger than a match head. Yet, if scientists are right,
it hears witness to the cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs.
Geophysicist Frank Kvte of the University of California at Los Ange
les has found what he said is the first known fragment of the gigantic,
rocky asteroid that scientists believe slammed into Earth 65 million years
ago.
The fragment contains high concentrations of iridium, a rare metal, as
well as iron, nickel and chromium at levels peculiar to extraterrestrial
objects. Kvte said the most reasonable explanation is that it came from the
asteroid.
Other scientists said the geochemical analysis shows that the rock chip
probably did originate from space. But whether it was shed from the aster
oid that doomed the dinosaurs remains open to debate, they said.
An analysis of the fragment was published in Thursday's issue of the
journal Nature.
The coarse-grained fleck was pulled from the floor of the Pacific Ocean
in a thin layer of the planet's crust known as the K / T boundary. Scientists
believe the layer formed from the debris that settled back to Earth after
being blown into the atmosphere by the asteroid.
"This is the first object recovered from the K / T boundary that is unar
guably meteoric," Kvte said. "My personal interpretations will be subject
to review. Hut in the end we will learn more about one of the worst days
in the historv of the Earth."

Doctors confounded by attention deficit disorder
WASHINGTON (AP) — Doctors still don't know the best way to
treat or even diagnose attention deficit disorder in children — even
though more than a million children now take powerful drugs to control
their hyperactive behavior, according to the National Institutes of Health.
In a report issued Wednesday, a panel of experts selected by the NIH
called attention deficit disorder a "profound problem" that may affect 3
percent to 5 percent of all American schoolchildren and costs schools
more than $3 billion.
But a consistent, proven method of diagnosing and treating the disor
der remains elusive, the experts said.
"There is no current validated diagnostic test for"the disorder, said
Dr. David J. Kupfer. a University of Pittsburgh psychiatry professor and
chairman of the panel.
Some treatments are effective in the short term — principally drugs
such as Ritalin — but no studies have examined their effect on children
who take them for more than 14 months. Kupfer said.
Attention deficit disorder, or ADD. also known as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, usually is diagnosed in school-age children, often
as the result of a child's disruptive behavior.
Symptoms include the inability to sit still for reading, study or even to
watch television.
Panel member Donald A. Berry of Duke University Medical Center
said he thought Ritalin and other powerful, mind-altering drugs are pre

scribed too often for children, criticizing the lack of studies on the drugs'
long-term effects.
Bush brothers may be the future of the GOP
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — George W.. the governor of Texas, and
Jeb, the governor-elect of Florida, stole the show at the Republican Gov
ernors Association's opening day Wednesday. "They are our future." said
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
For nearly 30 minutes, the Bush brothers held forth on the Republican
Party's future and their future as America's latest political dynasty.
They were self-confident, bordering on cocky in the case of George W.
Asked if he believed he would make a good president, the Texas gover
nor smiled his father's slanted smile and said. "You know ric well enough
to know the answer is yes."
He didn't answer the Big Ouestion: Will he run for president?
"I haven't made up my mind yet and I'm going to make it up later on."
said Bush, elected to a second term Nov. 3 with 112t 1 ) percent of the vote.
Bush said his main concern is the impact of a presidential campaign on
his family. He is expected to decide by April whether he wants to try to
be the first child of a president to win the White House since John Ouin
cv Adams. His father served from 1989 to 1993.
For now. George W. says he is focused on his legislative agenda in
Texas and has no national agenda. It would come together quickly if he
ran for president, he said.
