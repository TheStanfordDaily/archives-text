Men's basketball team
shakes student body and
brings media onslaught

WHILE BIG GAME has been
grabbing our attention all week,
the men's basketball team has
definitely become this year's rallying point
for the Stanford student body. The
onslaught of media coverage and incredi
ble expectations that emerged out of last
year's Final Four appearance has impacted
every student â€” even those unfamiliar
with the rules of basketball.
Why should another potential national
championship at a school which consistent
ly wins multiple NCAA titles draw so much
attention, energy and excitement? The
answer is rooted in people's perception of
Stanford as well as the unique character of
our basketball team and student body at
large.
A recent article previewing the team in
the San Francisco Chronicle described
three key Cardinal players. "They've got
ten there with a center (Tim Young) who is
deeply into the work of Beat Generation
writer Jack Kerouac; a small forward (Pete
Sauer) who offers mutual-fund tips to his
dad ... and a power forward (Mark Mad
sen) who spends most of his waking hours
on the Internet checking his portfolio," the
Chronicle wrote. This is hardly what the
public expects college basketball stars to
dt> during their free time.
While Stanford's numerous high-caliber
NCAA teams bolster the school's reputa
tion, college basketball is second only to
college football in media coverage and

game attendance. For some sports fans, the
college basketball season and March Mad
ness are the most exciting times of the year.
Given that the Cardinal has not won a
conference title since 1963, and has not
won one outright in 57 years, it comes as no
surprise that the media attention was sud
den and strong. Don't be surprised if you
go home for winter break and spot a mid
die-school or high-school student sporting
a cardinal jersey with No. 45 "Mad Dog"
Madsen's name on the back.
There's much more to the story of Stan
ford basketball, however, than just its
unexpected leap to the top of the polls.
The intense excitement of the students
who camped out for tickets has spread
throughout the student body, and even the
busiest graduate student probably took a
peek at the game last night on television,
or at least asked someone if he or she
knew the score.
Former professional basketball player,
Rhodes Scholar, U.S. Senator and possible
presidential candidate Bill Bradley credits
the Stanford men's basketball team as the
inspiration for his latest book, "Values of
the Game." It is fitting that Bradley, the
epitome of the successful student athlete,
saw the Cardinal squad as an inspiration
and a model for successful teamwork.
Every player on the team struggles to live
up to the demands of Stanford academics
and championship expectations.
We are excited by the new acclaim for
Stanford and the pride it has engendered in
the student body. Seeing an intensely
focused Art Lee on the cover of Sports
Illustrated and a proclamation that "Stan
ford is No. 1" reminds us that Stanford is
the ultimate academic and athletic power
house.
