## Defending my humble convictions 
### 
Bearing in mind
the title of this
newspaper section,
I guess I'm supposed to
have an opinion on some
thing. This "something" is
entirely up to me, which
makes things fairly

straightforward, but lemme tell you: It's
hard as heck to have a defendable, readable
point of view every week. It's like a tiny
CIV paper due every Thursday, only fewer
people are reading it.
It's harder still to focus on only one spe
cific idea. I much prefer the wayward ram
blings that normally litter my natural con
versation. So, my Stanford friends, today we
shall buck the opinions page tradition.
Instead of one giant, mega-important opin
ion (like "frats suck," "the post office
sucks" or "women suck"), what follows are
a bunch of "mini-convictions": concise,
often irreverent opinions in neat little pack
ages. Clip and save them in your wallet for
later reference!
Boxers vs. briefs
We'll start short and sweet with this typ
ical source of contention. There's lots of
room for debate surrounding male under
garments, but not in my column. The
answer is clear-cut: briefs all the way. You
can argue about comfort, appearance, even
body temperature, but there's only one
thing that matters: leakage control (if you
need to ask, don't).
Stanford University
How do you characterize the entire Uni
versity in a few sentences? Easy. Just like
with any decision, calculate the pros and
cons. Ready? Stanford's location: pro. High
tutition: con. Grade inflation: pro. Cardinal

football: con. Huge phallic symbol in the
center of campus: pro. That's a three-to-two
victory. In short, Stanford University gets a
big thumbs up (you sure that's a thumb?).
"Guiltless" food
I have to admit that I'm a fan of the
"guiltless" concept. I don't think I felt guilty
before fat-free items emerged on the mar
ket (even with my Catholic upbringing), but
I feel pretty innocent nowadays. Those of us
who are nutritionally "absolved" now have
guiltless ice cream, guiltless meat and even
guiltless lettuce. We can eat what we want
without any of the negative side effects of
food intake like energy, taste or natural
ingredients. We can even eat twice as much,
knowing that calories don't count when
food is fat-free. It's a difficult, flavorless life
without full-Hedged food, but it's worth it.
We suffer, but we suffer in slimness!
Mark IMadsen
Never met you, Mark, but I've heard a
lot of great things and had fun watching
your crazy arm-wave after last year's play
off slam-dunk. I'm pretty sure I could take
you in one-on-one, though. Spot you five?
Professors
1 like professors. Granted, I've never met
one. but I believe they're inherently good
people with knowledge to share and impor
tant prison experiments to perform. I sim
ply wish more of them could share their
expertise a little more lucidly. Ever sit
through a math lecture at Stanford? Yikes.
I didn't even take a real math class—l
limped through Economics 180—but I was
lost in its presentation. Or should I say,
"translation"? I'm pretty sure I took care of
two requirements in that class: math /sci
ence and my foreign language (though I'm
not sure which language).

The WNBA
Whoa, sorry. Not even going to touch'
this one.
Republicans vs. Democrats
With the exception of Minnesota, we
seem to have a fairly bipartisan population.'
But not at Stanford. Check out the leftist
bent of the Farm: We're students at a uni
versity that makes "a case for liberal educa
tion." The"L" in SLE, my former CIV prcV
gram, stands for "liberal." When I sham
poo. 1 apply the Herbal Essences "liberally"
to my hair, as per the instructions. Coinci*-
dence? Doubtful. Like the societal leaders
at the Stanford Review, we need to over
turn this forced Democratic, Big Brother
esque system of belief. Newt in 2(MM)!
Italian food
Great!
Frat guys
Suck!
This writer
Dead!
Though it can be dangerous (as evinced
in the last two examples), it's much easier to
have short, unfounded opinions rather than
a fully evolved point of view. I'll be com
pletely honest with you: Preparing these
mini-convictions was a piece of cake com
pared to drafting a normal, column-length
opinion. In fact, from now on. instead of
offering a somewhat tenable argument, I
think I'll remain on the surface of all debate
(like most papers I've written at Stanford).
I'll sit on the fence of life, providing flippant
remarks with little insight.
And that's my one cent.
John Davi, hard as he may try, has abso
lutely no opinion on the NBA lockout, biki
nis or the Stanford grapes debate.
