Green security system
violates rights
Although I agree with Michael ("hang
that personal attacks on Michael Keller
are not the appropriate way to address the
issue of the Green Library security sys
tem, Chang's defense of Keller neglects
the importance of the issue that was raised
in Shegan Campbell's letter on Nov. 13.
I also find bag searches humiliating,
and I am surprised and disturbed by the
fact that the Stanford community, with
few exceptions, does not appear to have
any problem with them.
I understand that bar coding every
book in Green may not be feasible or effi
cient.
I also understand that Mr. Keller does
not really want to humiliate me. However,
my understanding does not make the bag
searches less offensive. In fact, I would
prefer being suspected of laziness or
cheapness to being subject to a search.
The "Green security system" actually
keeps me away from the library and forces
me to take the time to drop off my bag
before going to Green to keep my dignity.
If I need to explain why routine bag
searches are humiliating, our campus, for
all its "I'm smart, I'm at Stanford" pride is

in very had shape.
Perhaps nothing can he done ahout the
Green security system at this moment, hut
the library administration should at least
be trying to do something.
Give me a place to leave my bag before
going through the checkpoint, and I'll be
happier. And we as students should stop
being complacent about the situation.
How can we try to be a mildly aetivist
campus if we don't even care about our
own rights?

Geyser's Muslim satire
insulting
I am writing in response to Dan
Geyser's satire of Saddam Hussein.
While I personally disagree with
Geyser's attempt to make light of the
themes of international conflict, liquida
tion and genocide, I understand that it is
his right as a fledgling journalist. In fact, I
should probably admire him; I must admit
that I am simply unable to find humor in
these topics.
The portions that go beyond his edito

rial rights and into blatant journalistic irre
sponsibility are his mention of Muslim
religious figures and tenets in a violent
context.
Now I must admit that I possess a
knowledge of Islam that is superficial at
best, and I certainly do not endeavor to
speak for the Muslim community, but the
portrayed chants of "Allah! Allah!" and
the mention of the concept of Jihad, or
Muslim Holy War, are intolerable. Mr.
Geyser equates these concepts with
"skull-crushing," "raping." and "pillag
ing." In doing so he perpetuates abhorrent
stereotypes about a religion that crosses
geographic, ethnic and political bound
aries.
Though I am not so naive as to think
that religious overtones are completely
absent from this conflict, the proliferation
of unfair generalities is unacceptable. The
Iraqi conflict is first and foremost a ques
tion of international legality. The irre
sponsible proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction threatens the entire interna
tional community; Saddam Hussein
threatens this community as a repressive
dictator, not as a Muslim.
