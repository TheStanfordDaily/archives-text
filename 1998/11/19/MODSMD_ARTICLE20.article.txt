LAST YEAR. STUDENTS for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford clashed
with the Stanford Republicans outside
the Humanities Career Fair. The disputed
issue was one that has divided the left and
right ft>r centuries: the correct way to manu
facture tennis shoes in Vietnam. Business
practices had replaced political ideology.
•'Nike saves lives." one of the Republican's
banners stated.
Economic decisions are the only ones that
the United States seems to care about an
more —what remains of politics is just so
much sound and fury signifying money. The
idea that dollars are politically impartial is a
wonderful modern myth: it allows people to
blame the market for every political decision
they make.
Dollars are admittedly brilliant at certain
tasks, especially those involving problems
like ensuring that the supply of dogs equals
the demand for dogs. But when it comes to
evaluating anything that is actually valuable,
dollars become idiot savants. II confronted
with the shape of a baby or the taste of fresh
air. dollars are left twitching and mumbling
nonsense about value at the margin.

As you find out in Economics I. dollars
ignore a lot. Economists call them externali
ties; normal people use clumsy words such as
pollution, peace or justice.
The dollar in your pocket represents a set
of decisions as political as those made in am
election. The current dollar value of environ
mental quality and social justice is zero point
zero dollars apiece.
If you care about environmental damage,
cars and gasoline cost far more than their
dollar value, which only takes into account
the steel they're made from and the hands
that made them. If you care about working
conditions, Nike shoes are far too cheap
when you consider that, up until last year,
people had to breathe in lung-lulls of car
cinogens in the process of making them. And
if you really care about such issues, then you
have to alter your spending patterns immedi
ately or be guilty of hypocrisy.
As a consumer, you have an economic
vote in the way the country is shaped. It is a
vote that few people use or even acknowl
edge. mainly because it is a vote that incurs
an immediate and obvious expense. Essen
tially, you have to pay for a better environ

mail. It's far more pleasant to think that the
free vote you get at the ballot box is all the
political commitment that is required.
Stanford h;ts many such economic votes.
With a $b.2-billion portfolio, Stanford is
hardK investing, peanuts, and. even if it was,
ii would have 6.25 percent more peanuts in
real terms than it would have had 10 years
■ mo. Market forces have been kind tt> Stan
lord's endowment.
Yet Stanford's trustees, under the guise of
political impartiality, are explicit in using
their power for the sole purpose of getting
the I niversity more money to play with.
"Maximum economic return shall be the
primary criterion for the selection of the Uni
versity's endowment securities" is the Hoard
of Trustees' first commandment. However,
the trustees are kind enough to recognize
themselves as "responsible and ethical
investors." and while they consider social
injury, they rarely act on it.
I he Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility is the body that determines
what constitutes ethical investment. In order
to appear apolitical, it does not recommend
divestment in order to encourage or express

"approval of a company's activities, or. alter
natively. for the primary purpose of placing
the University in a position to contest a com
pany's activities." Instead, SCIR will only
divest when "a desired change in the compa
ny's activities would have a direct and mate
rial effect in alleviating social injury."
I imagine the distinction is there to pre
vent a Marxist from arguing that all corpo
rate activity is harmful and that the trustees
should not invest anything in protest. Divest
ment should occur only when, say. it would
end apartheid. But the distinction is slippery.
It is difficult to determine the point when dis
approval of a company's activities becomes
disapproval of the harms they create.
Gerhard Casper used the distinction
between the political objection and the
"material effect" rather unfairly last year.
"This is the way to destroy a University, to
use it as a political vehicle," he said over tea
and cookies, referring to student protest over
the endowment's investment in Texaco Oil,
which at that point was of great help to a very
nasty regime in Burma. Later that quarter, a
SEAS proposal to set up an alternative
endowment pool with a socially responsible

investment firm was preemptively dismissed
by SCIR. Again. Casper warned of the hor
rors of politicizing the University in a letter
to the Daily.
It is dishonest for the trustees and the
administration to pretend that their financial
decisions are far removed from the dirt of
politics, and that anybody who disagrees with
the trustees' application of their own guide
lines must be a political zealot.
1 understand that SEAS is currently
working with SCIR on creating better guide
lines rather than allowing investment respon
sibility to be the empty phrase that it cur
rently is.
Getting people to consider their beliefs
along with their tastes when spending money
is as important as going to the ballot box on
election day. It is up to you to redefine the
dollar as something that is able to take your
values into account. Boycott firms whose
practices you disapprove of. Money is the
only thing that makes noise any more.
