OK, here it comes, yet another
Big Game column.
But I have to do this. It would be
wrong of me to sit here and write
about anything else, even our illus
trious basketball team, and com
pletely gloss over the single greatest
tradition that Stanford has.

But I don't want to reiterate the
same things that have heen told to
you already. Brian Eule, my co-edi
tor, wrote about participation and
showing school pride, (iuest colum
nist Ethan Linsdey wrote about the
hallowed tradition that is Big Game.
I'm here to deliver my view on
the less glorious aspect of this battle.
Call it the Dark Side of the Big
Game, if you will. I might as well
admit it, I think 1 am the Dark Side
of Big Game.
I'm all for good sportsmanship
and respecting one's opponent. It's
a credo I've always lived by. After
all. who better to empathize with
than someone who's in your exact
position?
Well, all that can go out the win
dow this Saturday.
I'm old-fashioned. I never want
to see the Dodgers lose to the Gi
ants. the Raiders to the Broncos, the
Lakers to the Celtics. I've grown up
with some of the greatest rivalries in
sports.

And now 1 have Stanford-Cali
fornia.
I want our crowd to be obnox
ious and rude. I know I'm just ask
ing for a bunch of upset letters to the
editor tomorrow, but it's not like
I'm asking for blood or even Oski's
head — though the latter would be
nice.
Each year we get a slew of com
plaints about how childish and
harmful both teams' fans have got
ten. Deal with it. Anyone who
thinks that Big Game spectators are
really that bad hasn't ever been to a
major NFL game.
This is the only week each year
that the campus as a whole even
cares about this rivalry. Some peo
ple act as if we've been plotting for
months on end on how we're going
to get back at those Dirty Golden
Bears for tearing down our goalpost
or stealing our Tree. Not so. I don't
want us to stoop to that level.
If you don't think it'd be stoop
ing you obviously didn't see the Cal
students actually using their hands
to dig up our end zone last year.
I want a little emotion. Actually,
check that. I want a lot of emotion.
Granted, for any other game I'd
have settled for your just showing
up. Not this time. This is the big
time. If you can't get riled up for this,
drive a nail through your hand or
something. That'll get you plenty
pissed. Channel that anger against
Cal —just keep it verbal and not
physical.
It's a simple request. And it's one
of only two that I have.
The other is for the football
team. Our glorious gridiron heroes.
