### Brian Rule Editorial staff 
Now this is mure like it.
No. 3 Stanford came out last night and demolished
the Southern Methodist Mustangs 86-51 in the first
round of the Chase National Invitational Tournament.
With four players scoring in double figures, the Car
dinal looked a bit more like the team seen last year bat
tling Kentucky, than the one that had some problems
with UC-Davis in last week's opener.

"That's a little more like the kind of basketball I ex
pect to play," said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "It just shows me it's there. We just have to
continue to dig it up each and every time."
There wasn't the need for much digging on this
night, however, as the Cardinal didn't allow the Mus
tangs anywhere near its lead.
"We came into this game with the mindset that
SMIJ would be pretty tough," said Stanford point
guard Arthur Lee. who finished with 11 points.
"We thought it would be a battle," Lee added. "And
when we approach teams like that, we're pretty tough
to beat."
That's was fairly clear.
Tying a career high, sophomore Jarron Collins
racked up 12 points in addition to 10 rebounds for
Stanford.
Also leading the Cardinal was the dominating play
of senior Peter Sauer and junior Mark Madsen, both
finishing the game with 12 points.
Furthermore, Stanford's defense shut down the
struggling Mustangs, which hit a measly 2.\<S percent of
its shots from the floor.
"We worked really hard and didn't give up any
cheap shots," Montgomery added.
Most of those made field goals, however, were cour
tesy of SMU sophomore guard Jeryl Sasser, who
scored 26 points in the game, just two points shy of
tying his career high 28-point performance against

Junior Mark Madsen had 12 points and six rebounds as the men's basketball team

"Coming in. I'd never seen him
play," said Lee, who guarded Sass
er for much of the game. "He was
good, but it was kind of tough for
him because lie had to" carry the
team tin his shoulders.
Playing the off-guard position
last season, Sasser was filling in at
point guard for the injured Stephen
Woods.
A junior. Woods will miss three
to four weeks of action after hurt
ing his right foot in an exhibition
game.
Although the Cardinal looked
extremely deep. Stanford was play
ing without sophomore Michael
McDonald, out with a sprained
ankle.
McDonald did not suit up for
last night's game, nor will he play in
the second round of the NIT on Fri
day.
"It's not your standard sprain,"
Montgomery said. "We have to be
cautious with it."
Being cautious with McDonald
forces freshman Tony Ciiovacchini
into the spotlight, backing up Lee.
Ciiovacchini played IX minutes in
last night's game, and can expect to
see a fair amount of time in Stan
lord's next game as well.
Senior Mark Seaton added a lit
tle excitement to the ballgame,
after it was already long over late in
the second half, by scoring seven
points in the last four minutes, in
cluding a reverse lay-in on several
Mustangs.
The enthused Sixth Man sec
tion. however, was already chanti
ng "It's all over." bv halftime.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
43-17 lead in the first half, with
Sasser scoring 12 of SMU's 17. He
appeared to be the only Mustang to

show up for the game, hitting six of
10 shots while the remainder of his
team went two for 24 from the field
during the half.
Stanford's first-half perfor
mance was a bit more well-round
ed. as Madsen had 10 points and
Lee and Sauer each had eight.
After only six minutes of play,
an 11-1 run helped secure a Stan
ford lead and prove the Cardinal
wasn't going to mess around with
this game.
With Lee hitting two of two
from behind the three-point line,
one of which was immediately fol
lowed by a Kris Weems three-point
bucket, Stanford didn't give SMIJ
much of a chance to keep up with
the Cardinal.
Earlier in the evening, the
Southwest Missouri State Bears
upset the Missouri Tigers at Mis
souri, 72-6<J. thus becoming the
next opponents for the Cardinal in
the NI T. The Hears will come to
Stanford for a 6:30 p.m. game on
Friday night at Maples Pavilion.
Bears' head coach Steve Alford
returns four of five starters and a
total of eight lettermen from a team
that went 16-16 last season and did

not qualify for postseason play.
Senior forward / center Danny
Moore, who stands at 6-foot-11, re
turns for his final campaign after
leading the team in both scoring
and rebounding the last two sea
sons.
Last year, Moore averaged ]5.7
points and 6.0 rebounds per game
after a sophomore year in which he
averaged 19.5 points and 7.3 re

Moore is assisted by junior
guard Kevin Adult, who averaged

Three of the four semifinalists in
