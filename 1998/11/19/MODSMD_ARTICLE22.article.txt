Now this is mure like it.
No. 3 Stanford came out last night and demolished
the Southern Methodist Mustangs 86-51 in the first
round of the Chase National Invitational Tournament.
With four players scoring in double figures, the Car
dinal looked a bit more like the team seen last year bat
tling Kentucky, than the one that had some problems
with UC-Davis in last week's opener.

■ Yesterday: No. 3Stanford (2-O)N6, Southern Methodist
(0-1)51.

"That's a little more like the kind of basketball I ex
pect to play," said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "It just shows me it's there. We just have to
continue to dig it up each and every time."
There wasn't the need for much digging on this
night, however, as the Cardinal didn't allow the Mus
tangs anywhere near its lead.
"We came into this game with the mindset that
SMIJ would be pretty tough," said Stanford point
guard Arthur Lee. who finished with 11 points.
"We thought it would be a battle," Lee added. "And
when we approach teams like that, we're pretty tough
to beat."
That's was fairly clear.
Tying a career high, sophomore Jarron Collins
racked up 12 points in addition to 10 rebounds for
Stanford.
Also leading the Cardinal was the dominating play
of senior Peter Sauer and junior Mark Madsen, both
finishing the game with 12 points.
Furthermore, Stanford's defense shut down the
struggling Mustangs, which hit a measly 2.\<S percent of
its shots from the floor.
"We worked really hard and didn't give up any
cheap shots," Montgomery added.
Most of those made field goals, however, were cour
tesy of SMU sophomore guard Jeryl Sasser, who
scored 26 points in the game, just two points shy of
tying his career high 28-point performance against
