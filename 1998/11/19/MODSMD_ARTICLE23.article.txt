### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
Things just aren't getting any
easier for the Stanford women's
basketball team.
Following two losses against
top-20 teams — No. 18 Arkansas
and No. 4 Duke — at the Nike
Four in the Fall tournament last
weekend, the team's schedule
won't let up any time soon as Stan
ford hosts 25th-ranked Illinois
tonight and then hosts top-ranked
Purdue on Sunday.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tonight: Stanford (0-2) vs. No. 25
Illinois (0-0). 7:30 p.m. Maples
Pavilion. RADIO: KZSU (90.1
FM).

Both games are big for the Car
dinal as the team was routed in its
opening two games, subsequently
dropping out of the top-25 for the
first time sinee the 1987-8K season.
"Our team can't tolerate medi
ocrity," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, in her lucky 13th season
on the Farm. "We need a great ef
fort from people — it's time to
step up."
Despite its losses, the Cardinal
is optimistic and excited for its up
coming challenges, especially for a
chance to play the No. 1 team in
the country.
Hut before Stanford can focus
on the Boilermakers, who usurped
the top spot from the Tennessee
Lady. Volunteers after snapping
their 46-game winning streak last
Sunday, they must concentrate on
the equally important game
against the Fighting Illini tonight
at 7:30 p.m.
"The first game is mainly for us
to get our confidence back after

our weekend — it's all about
building our team back up," said
freshman Lindsey Yamasaki.
Illinois, like Stanford, is a
young team and has only one se
nior. VanDerveer expects big
things from the Illini's point guard,
junior Melissa Parker, and their
post player, co-captain Alicia
Sheeler, who plays very physically.
Last season, Sheeler led her team
in rebounds and was second in
scoring.
On Sunday at 1 p.m., Stanford
will he looking for a big, no, huge
upset against the Boilermakers.
Purdue has one of the top back
courts in the country, led by se
niors Ukari Figgs and Stephanie
White-McCarty and backed up by
freshman Kelly Komara, and re
turns all 13 players from last year's
squad which made it as far as the
Elite Eight.
"It will be interesting because
they have the burden of being No.
1," VanDerveer said. "Our team
will relish the challenge."
VanDerveer is hoping for two
more big games from sophomore
center Carolyn Moos. Moos had a
breakthrough weekend at the
Four in the Fall Tournament, com
bining for 38 points and 12 re
bounds over two games despite
being limited to 23 minutes on Sat
urday.
Last year, Mo<is scx>red a total
of 33 points in the entire season,
but is now touted as the most im
proved player in the country.
Blue-chip freshman Lindsey
Yamasaki also had a strong week
end, scoring lb points against
Arkansas and 13 against Duke.
Yamasaki showed little signs of
the rookie jitters and in the first
half against Arkansas hit three
