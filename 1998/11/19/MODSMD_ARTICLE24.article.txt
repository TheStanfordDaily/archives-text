It's double the distance and, as
they say on TV. it's double the fun.
Today, the Stanford men's swim
team will compete in its annual ex
hibition double-distance meet
against California at deGuerre
pool, beginning at 2 p.m.

MEN'S SWIMMING

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford vs. Califor
nia, 2 p.m. DeGuerre Pool.

Every event in the meet is twice
as long as events are in regulation
dual meets. There is the 4(X)-yard
race of every stroke — back, breast,
fly and free — as well as the 2,(KX)-
yard freestyle and the <S(X)-vard indi
vidual medley. The meet is not
scored, which gives team members
a chance to swim other events than
they are used to. not necessarily
their best events.
There are two goals for the meet:
to break long-standing records from
previous years of the double-dis
tance events and also for each
swimmer to go where he hasn't
gone before in terms of his level of
competition.
"Several people are looking to
break records." said freshman Mike
O'Neil. "It is physically grueling,
but is also a mental challenge as well
to push yourself, challenge your
self."
The meet for each swimmer is
about pushing himself individually,
setting specific goals and meeting
them physically.
"We would like to swim quick in
season times," said sophomore
Clayton Jones. "This meet will give
us a chance to gauge our endurance
and our readiness to race."
The double-distance meet is one
of the more fun meets of the year for
the Cardinal. It gives Stanford an op
portunity to experience the intensity
of racing without the pressure to win
as a team.
•' This meet is about having fun.
doing something different," O'Neil
said. "It's all in the spirit of Big
Ciame and the Stanford-Cal rivalry."
The meet has taken place for 11
years and is always held on Stan
ford's turf. The Cardinal has consis
tently performed well in this unusual
meet, traditionally breaking at least
one record each year.
Although the traditional Stan
ford-( 'a I rivalry does play a part in

the competition, the real rivalry is
for the records. Team members
match up against one another during
consecutive years and hold personal
rivalries from year to year. Also, an
othei rivalry exists between each
person and the record for his event.
The meet also allows the swim
mers to gauge how they match up
against the Cal members and the
members of their own Stanford
team.
This is also a good opportunity to
be in another racing situation. The
swimmers annually find themselves
in the hardest part of their training at
this point in the season, having long
and intense swimming sets in prac
tices twice daily. Also, with the
events of this meet being longer dis
tances, the events allow the swim
mers to see how workouts, typically
longer swims, translate into a true

racing situation.
"The approach to racing and
working on the fundamentals re
mains the same in terms of intensi
ty," Jones said.
This is the Cardinal's last oppor
tunity for competition until January.
Cal does offer Stanford a good chal
lenge, although it lacks an important
aspect that other competitive teams
have.
"Cal has a lot of good stroke guys
and also some really fast sprinters."
said senior Justin Ewers. "They will
provide some good races and we like
going head to head with them, but
they do not have as much depth [as
our team]."
When Stanford resumes its sea
son. the level of competition will
pick up as it will swim against schools
such as Arizona, USC and Arizona
State.
