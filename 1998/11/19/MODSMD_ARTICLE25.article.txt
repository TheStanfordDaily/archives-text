## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Panelists discussed the extradi
tion and arrest of former ( hilean dic
tator Augusto Pinochet yesterday at
a lunch seminar at the Center for
Latin American Studies.
Panelists, who ranged from
human rights attorneys to advisors of
the Chilean government, held differ
ing beliefs as to what Pinochet's fu
ture should be.
Pinochet was arrested in London
on a warrant from Spain on Oct. 16
and accused of involvement in the
death and disappearance of over
3,(XX) people during his rule from
1973 to 1 WO. Judgment on his case
will be announced in the House of
Lords next Wednesday, also the day
of Pinochets N3rd birthday.
The panel began with Terry Karl,
associate professor of political sci
ence, holding an affidavit with the

names of those who have been rec
ognized as persecuted under
Pinochet's rule.
"Justice is more than welcome,"
said panelist Claudio Duran, a for
mer political exile from Chile and vis
iting scholar who considers himself
lucky to be alive.
Spain charged Pinochet with
crimes against humanity, an allega
tion that gives no legitimacy to statu
tory or territorial limitations. This
concept arose out of events following
World War II and is applicable to all
who violate the United Nations'
charter on human rights.
Panelist Karen Parker, an in
ternational human rights attorney,
stated that Pinochet's trial will test
the survivability of this concept in the
face of a complex international
arena. "Nabbing someone like
Pinochet is the dream of every
human rights attorney." she said.
Parker noted the irony in U.S. cit

izens passing judgment due to Amer
ica's own history of human rights
abuses. The United States is not only
resisting a multinational movement
to create a permanent tribunal but
refused to acknowledge its sentenc
ing after having been found guilty on
15 counts of abuse in Nicaragua by an
international court.
"As Americans we are in
bling situation because we cannot get
our government to comply," Parker
said.
Arguments against Pinochet's ar
rest came from Philippe Schmitter.
professor of political science l , and
Bernardo Naverrete. advisor for the
office of presidency in Chile. Schmit
ter noted the hypocrisy of Spain's be
havior. as Spain itself has not ad
dressed egregious human Rights
abuses committed during and after
the Spanish Civil War. Naverrete ar
gued for Chile's right to exercise jus
tice as a sovereign nation.
