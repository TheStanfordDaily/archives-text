# Union vote at hospital
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
As 1,500 workers at Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital prepared to vote on union
ization, the hours leading up to today and tomorrow's
election were filled with debate on whether its workers
would be better off belonging to a union.
Fe Zaragoza, a nurse's assistant, said that the atmos
phere among workers yesterday was tension-filled.
"You can feel it when you're at work." she said. "You
can even taste it,"
The hospital workers voting include janitors, main
tenance workers, dietary food service employees and
nursing assistants. Stanford nurses already belong to a
different union, and 1,100 non-hospital Stanford em
ployees belong to the service employees' union.
Officials' and workers' opinions differ on whether or
not a majority of workers will vote "yes."
"I think it's nip and tuck," said Peter Gregory, asso
ciate dean for clinical affairs at the medical school. "It's
not clear if it will pass, or if it will not pass. I believe
they're better off without unionizing â€” we looked at
salary scales from other hospitals."
UCSF-Stanford Health Care says that its workers
are paid more than comparable ones at unionized hos
pitals. Their survey compared wages at 21 Kaiser hospi
tals, three Catholic Healthcare West hospitals, plus St.
Luke's Hospital, California Pacific Medical Center and
