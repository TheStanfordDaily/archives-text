# Union vote at hospital
## 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
As 1,500 workers at Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital prepared to vote on union
ization, the hours leading up to today and tomorrow's
election were filled with debate on whether its workers
would be better off belonging to a union.
Fe Zaragoza, a nurse's assistant, said that the atmos
phere among workers yesterday was tension-filled.
"You can feel it when you're at work." she said. "You
can even taste it,"
The hospital workers voting include janitors, main
tenance workers, dietary food service employees and
nursing assistants. Stanford nurses already belong to a
different union, and 1,100 non-hospital Stanford em
ployees belong to the service employees' union.
Officials' and workers' opinions differ on whether or
not a majority of workers will vote "yes."
"I think it's nip and tuck," said Peter Gregory, asso
ciate dean for clinical affairs at the medical school. "It's
not clear if it will pass, or if it will not pass. I believe
they're better off without unionizing — we looked at
salary scales from other hospitals."
UCSF-Stanford Health Care says that its workers
are paid more than comparable ones at unionized hos
pitals. Their survey compared wages at 21 Kaiser hospi
tals, three Catholic Healthcare West hospitals, plus St.
Luke's Hospital, California Pacific Medical Center and
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
to the wages that employees at Stan
lord 1 iospital and ('hildren's Hospi
tal earn.
"The gist of the survey was that
we compared 17 job classifications
between our hospitals and the other
hospitals. Of these, in 12 of 17 classi
fications. our employees have op
portunities to make higher wages,"
UCSF-Stanford Health Care
spokesman Mike Lassiter said. On
average, Stanford nurse's assistants
earn $16 an hour.
In contrast, the union claims that
unionized nurse aides, orderlies and
attendants make up to 43.1 percent
more than non-unionized employ
ees throughout the industry.
Frank Arredondo, who has
worked for the housekeeping de
partment for five years, said, " To
morrow we'll have the opportunity
to organize. Everybody's so positive
we're uoinn to win. I know we're

going to win - for (the sake of] fair
ness and having a voice."
Yet hospital workers concede
that not everyone may be in favor of
unionizing. "There are some work
ers who are concerned about [pay
ing] union dues," said Wanda
Goodwin, who works in medical
records. "Some feel that there won't
be any guarantees [of better condi
tions). And some people are just
scared. I tell [the workers who are
scared] that [the hospital adminis
trators] can get rid of you at the drop
of a hat right now.
"I think if it goes through it will
be better for the people," Goodwin
said. "We'll have a better chance to
get a good contract. Happy employ
ees will do a better job and provide
better care for the patients."
Reports of clashes have little ap
parent affect on voters. The Daily
reported that on Nov. 4. one hospi
tal employee's badge was torn off bv
security guards who detained him
for passing out union information.
Lassiter said he was unfamiliar with
the incident.

If the workers vote "yes," they
will join Local 715 of the Service
Employees International Union,
the nation's largest health care
workers union. Three weeks ago, on
()ct. the union held information
al meetings at the Lucie Stern Com
munity Center in Palo Alto for
workers interested in unionizing.
In June, hospital workers circu
lated a petition on unionization.
Once a majority of the employees
were interested, they went through
the process of filing with the Nation
al Labor Relations Board to ask for
recognition. The workers filed a pe
tition with the board on Aug. 23.
The efforts to unionize Shirted
when Stanford University Medical
Center and the IJC-San Francisco
Medical Center merged over a'year
ago. Workers at the UCSF Medical
Center are already unionized.
Balloting takes place from 2 p.m.
to (•> p.m. today, and from 5:30 'a.m.
to 11 a.m. tomorrow at two locations
within the hospital and the Chil
dren's I lospital. Results are expect
ed by 2 p.m. tomorrow.
