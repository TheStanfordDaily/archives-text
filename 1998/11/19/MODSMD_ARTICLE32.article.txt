NOW - FEB/14
From his emergence in Los Angeles as a major force within Chicano artists' collectives — highly charged
politically oriented groups that challenged the mainstream art world through revolutionary performance
works — GRONK has approached his work with greater passion, energy and wit. "GRONK X 3" show

from an amalgam of Catholicism, Latino folklore and Hollywood movies, GRONK uses thick layers of high
intensity acrylic paint to create bold, expressionistic images. Tickets are $7, $4 students. The exhibit is at
the San Jose Museum of Art, open from Tuesday-Sunday 10 a.m. — 5 p.m., Thursday 10 p m. — 8 p.m.,

recently experienced a loss of her own. "Open Sea" begins with Edoardo's return home after a long spell
