## A
						night of Gallic frenzy 'Norma' at the San Francisco Opera 
### 
As opera plots go, Vincenzo Bellini's "Norma" is
quite easily among the most ridiculous, but this in
no way detracts from the stunning excellence of
the San Francisco Opera's new production. Carol Vaness
returns to the City for seven performances in her much
anticipated rendition of the title role. Andrew Sinclair's
production is his first for the company and I had the dis
tinct impression that it was not quite what the audience
expected. But the production was no disappointment. It
was a surprisingly nostalgic concoction of early 20th cen
tury gloom and volume.

It is difficult to find words to convey the cru
elty of Bellini's blend of musical audacity and
dramatic absurdity that forms one of the
world's most acclaimed operas. The composer
allows his lead soprano barely a brief introduc
tion before she must commence one of the
most rigorous arias in the bel canto repertoire,
"Casta Diva."
The opera, set among the sacred forests of
the Druids during the Roman invasion of Gaul
in 55 8.C., demands of its audience more than
the formulaic suspension of disbelief. Suffice it
to say, operagoers worldwide return time and
time again to productions of "Norma," not for
its theatricality, but for its insuperable musical
beauty.
While Carol Vaness began shakily, as most
do, she quickly grew into the immense role of
Norma. Vaness has a dramatic presence that
lends itself completely to this complex role. She
is simultaneouslv the high priestess of the
Druids, the preserver of a fragile Pax Romana,
the mother of two illegitimate children fathered

by a Roman centurion and the cunning, jealous lover who
must decide between betraying her lover and her female
friend or betraying her people. Her most successful
moment by far was her duet with Adalgisa (Anna
Caterina Antonacci). From then on she soared from
strength to strength. As other great women before, she is
sure to make this role hers.
After Vaness', the most exciting voice was Antonacci's.
She seemed to sing with two very different voices — soft
er and sweeter during her solo, and richer and sharper in
the duets with Vaness. The two blended perfectly, espe

daily when they fought their war of words over their
mutual lover, the Roman soldier Pollione (Michael
Sylvester). Sylvester, on the other hand, seemed more
concerned with his stage presence than remedying his
early unsteady performance. With the finale, his control
was more complete and his voice much richer.
Both acts take place under the imposing stage design of
Jose Luciano Varona and lighting of Michael Whitfield. A
monstrous gray oak tree — a standard in any Druid ritu
al, it seems — serves as the forest, provides an alcove for
Norma's secret and is the temple of the Druids' god of
war, Irminsul. But for me, the tree evoked more of a
"Druid Family Robinson" feeling than it did a site of bar
barous ritual and human torment.
"Norma" has a frustrating plot. With the foppish but
arrogant Pollione hapless between two Druid women, the
scene is set for a climactic and tragic denouement.
Ultimately, Norma decides neither to kill her children nor
betray Adalgisa, but rather to make public her sacrile
gious love and accept her destiny by ascending a blazing
pyre. Librettist Felice Romani's text is super-abundant
with fatalism. Ironically, this only serves to divert
unwanted attention away from the more tiresome essen
tialization of ancient Druidic culture and ritual.
But only the naive go to the opera to learn about
"other" cultures. The rest enjoy the decadence of the
evening for its stirring orchestration and passionate
singing. Under the baton of conductor Patrick Summers,
the San Francisco Opera performs a winning production
that is unreservedly recommended. Bellini's "Norma" is
playing in repertory until Nov. 28. For further informa
