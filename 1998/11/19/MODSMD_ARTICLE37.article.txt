# Operatic utopia or popular dystopia?
## 'Don Carlo' at the San Francisco Opera 
### 
Among the many reasons Intermission continues to
review the San Francisco Opera's productions is to
encourage its readership to explore new and excit
ing art forms. Coupled with this is my determination to
steer criticism away from opera as a highbrow art with lit
tle to interest the younger generations of today, and
toward a critique of the components of which we know
popular culture to be constructed.
It seems to me, therefore, that Giuseppe Verdi's "Don
Carlo" is a highly suitable candidate for considering the
idea of balance in the musical theatrical genre. Verdi wrote
and rewrote his opera time and time again with balance as
his central concern. Was he in search of an operatic
Utopia?
Opera was once the popular cultural form par excel
lence. While it may not be a surprise that in the mid-19th
century few middle-class Europeans would have thought
twice of Saturday night's knees-up in the local theater,
there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that this was
indeed the choice of the masses as well. As far back as the
mid-18th century, every medium-sized European town
had a theater, and throughout the period touring compa
nies brought the latest Mozart opera to town.
You only have to think back to the superb 1984 film
"Amadeus" to remember that while "The Marriage of
Figaro" was written for the emporer of Austria, only a few
blocks away the working class was cavorting to the light
hearted antics of Papageno in"The Magic Flute." Mozart,
like Verdi after him, knew that the secret for ensuring a
good time by all was simply one of balance.
Verdi struggled with this problem perhaps a little more

than most, however. By the mid- 19th century he was wide
ly hailed as the most exciting composer of the age and was
sought after by opera houses world wide. His triumphal
tunes even found their way into many of the national
anthems of newly independent Latin American republics.
"Don Carlo" was dashed off in the white heat of pure
inspiration. It is a tale of war between France and Spain
that ends with the marriage of Elizabeth of Valois (Nina
Rautio in San Francisco Opera's new production) to Philip
II of Spain (James Morris). Elizabeth is miserable in mar
riage and in love with the king's son, Carlo (Sergei Larin).
The ensuing intrigues end tragically, as one might expect
in a country in the grip of the Inquisition.
For a contemporary audience, "Don Carlo" is as much a
superb opportunity for experimentation with a new musi
cal genre, as it is a riveting revisitation for regular audi
ences. While some opera companies seem to have trouble
attracting new and younger audiences, the San Francisco
Opera's new production should actually aid this goal.
Verdi's struggle with balancing the dramatic and musical
elements in order to please the audience is an on-going
one, and is indeed at the very heart of modern operatic
production. New audiences should not hesitate to express
their views about these matters, if only as part of the con
tinuation of a vibrant and controversial operatic tradition.
The San Francisco Opera repertory season runs until
mid January 1999. For further information on upcoming
