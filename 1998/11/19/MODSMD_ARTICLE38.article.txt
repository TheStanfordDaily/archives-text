## 'Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk Groove to this 
### 
( TH* ring in 'Dp Nohe, Bring in 'Da Funk" mows audiences with an inspirational
l-v combination of percussion, tap, singing and poetry. J'utting these artistic
1, / mediums to their full use, producer Oorge C. Wolfe unearths popular cul
ture to reveal the "truths and rhythms" of A&ca&tAmerican history
Since its inception III" 199?, "Noise / Funk*has imt#e*sed audience.'- with its rein
vention of traditional tap and dynamic chrbhicling of black America.
Opening Nov. H at the Colder, ('.ate Theatis a.s part of the Best of Broadway
series, the new national touring company features two dancers from the original
Broadway cast. Joseph Papp Public Theater /New York Shakespeare Festival,* non
profit company, is producing the tour —a rarity in an industry which usually
depends on large corporations for funding.
Five dancers, two drummers, 'da Singer Vickifyn Reynolds and 'da Voice Thomas
Silcott transform history into a tale of rhythms. The intensity of each number con
veys the suffering, frustration and blacks in America through times
of injustice and oppression.
The score spans genres ranging from hip-hop to blues to ragtime, shifting accord
ingly to transport audiences from the time of slavery to present-day New York. Tap
styles change to explore the concept of history as a phenomenon that happens to
individual people, yet always gains the power to be a collective story.
Reynolds —a seemingly omnipresent force on the stage — delivers a sound per
formance, belting out music while wearing at least 15 different costumes. She enjoys
a commanding presence on stage as she sings scat and gospel numbers written by
Ann Duquesnay, Zane Mark and Daryl Waters.
The two drummers, Dennis J. Dove and Martin Luther King, deliver spirited per
cussion performances as they drum on empty paint buckets and pans strapped to
their bodies.
The dancers, however, are the highlight of the show. In the first half of the show,
a dancer stylizes a lynching while Reynolds mournfully sings in the background, soft
ly illuminated by a delicate light. As time progresses, oppression takes on a different

form. Two dancers defuse the racist image of Boiangles the clown with humor in a
hilarious piece entitled the "Uncle Huck-a-Buck Song," The song even comes with a
mock Shirley Temple, who spins her curls as she taps and turns with girlish glee.
Sean (Pit !der> who .dternates with Jimmy Tate as 'da Beat, performed on open
ing night and shined in the iead role that was originated by Savion Glover on
Broadway. In "Green, Chancy, Buster, Slyde* Fielder rehearses in front of a three-way
mirror and alternates his style among the four tap greats, emulating them as a voice
over pays tribute to their talents.
Overall, the show was moving in its message and captivating in its choreography.
However, "Noise / Funk" often concentrated too much on creating noise and ftrnk.
Reynolds, Silcott, and the scissoring lights distracted too much from the Strength of
the show: its raw tap dancing. In "Green, Chancy, Buster, Slyde," the voice-over over
powered Fielder's dance, making it difficult for the audience to capture the subtlety
of his moves. In many other pieces*it seemed as if Silcott and Reynolds were com
peting for volume, drowning out the dancers between them.
The distraction reached its peak during a piece where the two drummers were
lucky enough to monopolize the stage, which was bare except for the two of them
and their empty buckets. Rather than allowing Dove and King to shine on their own,
the director decided that dancing lights and shifting slides were also needed in order
to liven up the segment. This cheapened the drummers and distracted from the
beauty of raw percussion.
However, these were minor drawbacks compared to the overall stunning display
of talent. If you don't mind a little MTV in the midst of a beautiful, rhythmic telling
of American black history, get your tickets now.
