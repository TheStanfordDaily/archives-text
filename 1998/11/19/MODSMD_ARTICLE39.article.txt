CC "feathering Daughters: Reflections by Men"
|H (Beacon Press) is a one-of-a kind collection of
X. personal essays written by men who are both
writers and fathers of daughters. This collection of non
fiction is edited by literary greats DeWitt Henry and
James Alan McPherson.
DeWitt Henry is an essayist and a fiction writer. He was
the founding editor of Ploughshares literary magazine.
Henry teaches at Emerson College in Massachusetts.
James Alan McPherson teaches in the Writer's Workshop
at the University of lowa. He has published two collec
tions of short stbries, "Hue and Cry" and "Elbow Room,"
for which he won the Pulitzer Prize. Separated by dis
tance, these two great writers managed to develop a pro
ject and create a book that has been sorely needed.
"Fathering Daughters" is one of the first solid steps
towards repairing the relationships between fathers and
their female children.
Inspired by William Butler Yeats' poem "A Prayer for
My Daughter," Henry and McPherson "wondered how
other writers who were fathers today might contemplate
the future for their daughters." In an attempt to compile
these contemplations, Henry and McPherson "asked
fathers to write about their love for and their responsibil
ities to their daughters, about their perspectives on cul
ture, about the future, and about the impact of feminist
criticism on their hearts and minds."
Consequently, "Fathering Daughters" is an eloquent
appeal to focus upon and "reframe the relationship"
between father and daughter, a relationship that has been
secondary to that of father and son. This collection of
personal accounts attempts to address the many compo
nents of the father-daughter bond, a bond the editors feel
"has been under profound strain and in need of nurtur
ing." The fathers here have written about childbirth, early
childhood, girlhood and adolescence, separation, adop
tion, the effects of divorce on children and rediscovery.

Because these essays were collected from fiction writ
ers, they have the polished feel of stories. They contain the
rich, descriptive language that captures the mundane and
the ordinary events in the lives that fathers and daughters
share and renders them beautiful and poignant.
Many of the fathers' personal accounts attack the
tremulous nature of the father-daughter bond and
attempt to strengthen it. In "Daughters Lost," Mark
Pendergrast writes about daughters lost to the "recovery
memory" movement, daughters who have uncovered
memories through therapy of sexual abuse and molesta
tion â€” memories of events that Pendergrast denies ever
occurred. "Lost Daughters" is both angry and apologetic.
In an introduction to his piece, Pendergrast writes, "It is
more important than ever that fathers and daughters
learn, over and over, to respect and love one another."
"Building Back Through Time" is Bill Mayher's
account of a winter day spent with his 25-year-old daugh
ter, Jenny. They build an igloo out of snow and ice and
recall the joy and happiness of their childhoods.
Phillip Lopate contributes "Delivering Lily," a personal
reflection on witnessing and taking an active part in his
daughter's birth. At once reflective and humorous,
"Delivering Lily" is the story of a middle-aged couple that
has tried without success to conceive for a long time.
When Lopate's wife becomes pregnant, they plan careful
ly, going through Lamaze techniques, determined to do
everything perfectly. However, when they get to the "hos
pital on the day of delivery, everything they learned flies
out the window as they abandon their techniques and
plans and deliver their baby the old-fashioned way, argu
ing and bickering throughout the whole process.
Henry and McPherson contributed personal essays to
this collection as well.
Each essay collected in "Fathering Daughters" is touch
ing and well written. The personal reflections of these
fathers are brilliant and vividly alive. Through a wide
range of dissimilar but related experiences, these reflec
tions all strive to strengthen the bond between fathers and
daughters.
