There will be no Big Bun
fire at Lagunita this year, but there
will be a Big Game Rally, a count
down and Bear Patrol.
The traditional Lake Lagunita
bonfire ended in 1994 due to con
cerns over the bonfire's impact on
tiger salamander habitat. Since then,
the Axe Committee has unsuccess
fully attempted to work with the ad
ministration to return the bonfire.
Last year, in efforts to regain the
longtime tradition, a group of con
cerned students presented the ad
ministration with an 80-page brief.
Mike Ceballos, chairman of Axe
Comm, said that the administration
"shot down" this effort. Because of
the administration's response last
year. Axe Comm did not attempt to
hold a lake bonfire this year.
"Axe Comm did everything in its

power to get the
Big Game Bon
fire back. We are
in favor of it,"
said Craig Mes
tel, who runs

Game Day Operations for Axe
Comm.
Axe Comm is planning the Big
Game Rally that will take place
tonight at 10 p.m. in the Arrillaga
Amphitheater. The event features
the Axe. football head coach Tyrone
Willingham. football players, the
Mendicants, the Stanford Band and
the Dollies. "We are very pumped
for the rally." Mestel said.
Another facet of Axe Comm in
volvement in Big Game activities is a
new program called Bear Patrol. The
Stanford Police contacted Axe
Comm, which has patrolled the cam
pus for Cal student vandalism in past
