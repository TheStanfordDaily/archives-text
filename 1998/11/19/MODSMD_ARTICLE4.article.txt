There will be no Big Bun
fire at Lagunita this year, but there
will be a Big Game Rally, a count
down and Bear Patrol.
The traditional Lake Lagunita
bonfire ended in 1994 due to con
cerns over the bonfire's impact on
tiger salamander habitat. Since then,
the Axe Committee has unsuccess
fully attempted to work with the ad
ministration to return the bonfire.
Last year, in efforts to regain the
longtime tradition, a group of con
cerned students presented the ad
ministration with an 80-page brief.
Mike Ceballos, chairman of Axe
Comm, said that the administration
"shot down" this effort. Because of
the administration's response last
year. Axe Comm did not attempt to
hold a lake bonfire this year.
"Axe Comm did everything in its

power to get the
Big Game Bon
fire back. We are
in favor of it,"
said Craig Mes
tel, who runs

Game Day Operations for Axe
Comm.

years, and asked if they could step up
their efforts this year. A Bear Patrol
member, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that the police
asked for their help in patrolling
campus and monitoring suspicious
activity. "Our main goal is to assist
the police in what they're doing be
cause arrests are their main deter
rence," said the Bear Patrol member.
The member explained that Bear
Patrol roams campus looking for
suspicious activity. They also watch

for cars without proper parking per
mits parked on campus. When Bear
Patrol finds anything suspect, they
contact the Stanford police.
The Stanford police said that they
are aware from past years that van
dalism related to the Big Game ri
valry occurs during this time of year.
Bear Patrol's work with Stanford
Police is an effort to deter vandalism
that in the past has cost the Universi
ty thousands of dollars in damages.
Axe Comm member Matt d'Alessio
added that Bear Patrol is a response
to the Big Game rivalry vandalism in
which "Cal students come over here
and decorate our campus inappro

priately."
In addition to Bear Patrol, Axe
Comm sponsors the Big Game
Countdown. The countdown began
Tuesday at 7 a.m. and will span 101
hours in commemoration of the
101st Big Game. The countdown
will end on Saturday at kickoff.
Mestel explained that the goal of
the countdown is to "increase
awareness of Big Game and pro
mote spirit throughout campus."
The event is also important to the
members of Axe Comm, Mestel
said, because it is a "good chance for
members to get close."
The horn used at games is sound-

Ed every hour on the hour from Axe
Comm's countdown set-up in the
birdcage at White Plaza. During the
countdown, Axe Comm maintains a
minimum of three members at the
birdcage.
In their annual musical raid on
campus, the trumpet section of the
Cal band was spotted at several loca
tions throughout campus late Tues
day evening.
Despite Cal student sightings,
Axe Comm maintains that the Axe
remains secure. Ceballos remarked
that until the Axe is unveiled at the
rally Thursday night, it will remain
"in a safe place."
