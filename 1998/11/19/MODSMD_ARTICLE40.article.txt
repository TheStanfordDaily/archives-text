## The 						Big Game Beat Cal! Never turn your back on the band... 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
My mom was born in the Stanford Medical
Center. She attended football games and Big
Game bonfires while attending high school.
She met my father shortly after his graduation from
Stanford, and they've lived in the area ever since. 1 sup
pose you could say that Stanford is where my heritage lies
and 1 should thus be rooting for Stanford football on
Saturday.
Not quite. My alma mater, my sweatshirt and even my
byline betrays one simple fact: I am a Cal Bear. Heck,
when I went off to Cal in 1993, the Axe followed me. Yet
here I am — after four years at America's best public
school, I've become a Farm boy, a student at this Junior
University.
Still, 1 can appreciate school spirit when I see it, and
thus I thought it best to look at the other side of the coin,
at your — uh, 1 mean our — team and, perhaps even
more importantly, the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
The band's function is to support the team, but, let's
face it, the band and the team haven't always been on the
best of terms. The nadir was the horrific (or, if you're a
Cal fan, wonderful) 1982 game, in which, in commenta
tor Joe Starkey's words, "The Stanford Band cost their
team that ball game."
Cal was ahead by two. Then Stanford's Mark Harmon
made a 35-yard field goal, leaving four — yes, four —
seconds left on the clock. Enthusiasm broke out; as Starky
noted, "Only a miracle could save the Bears as Stanford
piles out on the field." The Band members were among
the revelers.
Then came "The Play." It was awkward — with laterals
all over the place — but it sure worked, just not in the
way anyone thought it would. As the defense tried to stop
Berkeley's Kevin Moen, Stanford band members blocked
Cardinal football players, resulting in the most unusual
moment in college football history. In the end zone,
Moen ran into Stanford trombonist Gary Tyrell, making
a bizarre yet successful touchdown.
Starkey, recovering from the excitement, simply stated,
"I guarantee you, if you watch college football for the rest
of your life, you will never again see or hear a game to
match this one for pure dramatic excitement in the most
spectacular, crazy, amazing remarkable games I have ever
seen." The aftermath was literally stunning to Cardinal
fans. "I have not seen a member of the Stanford Band so
much as move in the past three minutes. They are just
now beginning to try to get some semblance of sanity
back into their lives as they reflect on the fact that they in
a way helped the California Golden Bears win the 85th
Big Game here today by a score of 25-20." Stanford fans
later rationalized the game as "a lousy game with a
bizarre finish," but the fact remains that it was a horrible
day for them and a wonderful day for Cal fans.
Not that most people here were either back then. As
fifth-year senior and Cardinal offensive tackle Geoff
Wilson noted, "The reality of it is, of all the guys on the
team now, hardly any of them was conscious at that
point." And not just players, but students and fans as well.
Stunts like the band's allegedly racist halftime show at
Notre Dame last year still cause a bit a friction, however,
and I thought I'd ask the members of the band and the
team about their symbiotic relationship — and about
1982.
"The man was was down!" insists Band trombonist
and junior Conrad Rushing. "He was already in the end
zone when he ran into that trombone player. But what do
you want with refs at whatever they're paid by the hour?
Watch the replays; you'll see. As for the rest — no com

merit."
Junior tenor saxophonist Christina Jahncke is less
impassioned about The Play. "At this point, very few of
the band members are still around, so it's thought of in
terms of humor. Still, there are certain taboos related to
that. The clock was stopped near the end of one game,
and everyone said.'l hope it doesn't get stopped on four
seconds.' Three or five was okay, just not four."
Bygones are bygones, though, and the team would
rather deal with things that it is or has been a part of.
Wilson says,"I think you hear more about that from the
fans than the players. It was a long time ago, and none of
us was playing football back then."
So how does the team feel about the band now? "You
gotta their love enthusiasm and support. I think it gives
us something no other school has. They've had their ups
and downs, but everybody definitely remembers the
Band," says Kevin Miller, a punter and placekicker for the
Cardinal, and a fifth-year senior.
The band sure is a memorable part of the game expe
rience, especially since last year's Notre Dame show got it
in trouble with both universities and the media.
Members of the band stand their ground, though. "I

think that people who criticize the band have an
extremely lacking of sense of humor," says Rushing. "We
may poke fun at everything, but we do not attack people.
We are not 'the end of Tightness.' If comments are made
in fun, we accept them in fun. But the retaliation of press
after the Notre Dame game was not in fun."
Jahncke agrees. "I think in terms of Stanford people
and locals, they know that in halftime shows, we're going
to poke fun — so they know to take it all with a grain of
salt. Further away, we're not given as much benefit of the
doubt."
But everyone agrees that there's no band like the
Stanford band. Jahncke believes the band is superior to
that of its rival "because of the fact that we're a scatter

band, better than marching band because we can focus
less on field rehearsal, and more on music."
Football players agree on the band's strength. Wilson
says,"I think that the band is unique. I think that they've
gotten in some trouble, but that overall they try to play
themselves as a really unique organization, just like
Stanford is a unique organization."
Still, when it comes to the Cal band, "Their band isn't
all bad. Of course — no one's the same as us. We hang
out with the Cal band now and again," says Rushing. So
does this mean that we trust them? "Of course, we still
guard our Tree and equipment," adds Rushing.
Especially now. The Tree's kidnapping excited (some
would say aggravated) a rivalry which to most is only
applicable on game day. The opinion of those closest to
the game, though, contrasts with those of the officials. "1
think it was a fun addition to the rivalry," says Miller. "It's
inexcusable, but it's all in good fun. As long as nobody
gets hurt."
Wilson agrees, "I thought it was kind of in the tradi
tion of the Big Game —if you really know the
tradition — it follows the tradition that they've had of
one school stealing something of the other's. I didn't
think it was that big of a deal. Obviously, I didn't appre
ciate that it was something of ours that was stolen."
Still, stealing the mascot itself adds a new facet to the
old rivalry. "It's not part of the traditional rivalry, but
adds to it. I've got to hand it to the Phoenix Five; they
worked the publicity of the whole thing well," concedes
Rushing. "Still, they broke down a door, a window, and a
wall of the Shak."
Jahncke sees the spiritual victory as Stanford's, though.
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson 111 sent out a press release
reminding the Five that he, not fabric, was the real Tree,
and if they wanted to kidnap the Tree, they should kid
nap him. "I thought his press release about them kidnap
ping an inanimate object was hilarious. He knew there
was no way they would kidnap him, so it was his way of
one-upping them."
"I alternate between being mad and just seeing it as
funny, but it's past us at this point," says Rushing. "There's
no threat. The Tree has been liquidated. It's all right."
The Tree's "liquidation" didn't receive as much press as
its kidnapping. "We had to destroy it," adds Rushing, "It
was tainted; we can't have a Tree that was in the posses
sion of Cal people for weeks. It wouldn't be right. Plus it
was damn fun to shred." A new, untainted Tree will
replace the old.
The replacement ceremony was actually a lot of fun,
according to Jahncke. "We carried a coffin which Chris
popped out of. Then we sent the old Tree through a wood
chipper."
$1,000 through the wood chipper? "The Tree is actual
ly rather expensive," affirms Rushing. "It's probably a bit
more than $1,000, just in materials. Fabrics are actually
expensive — most people don't deal with making clothes
these days, so they laugh at it — but the Tree is detailed,
right down to the leaves. There's also an integral back
pack and an internal frame. It adds up."
But all agree what it's worth in terms of school spirit.
As Henderson himself put it, "What is the functional
value of the Tree? It is worth millions."
As Henderson's letter points out, however, it isn't the
fabric that makes the Tree but the person inside. "He's
really cool," Jahncke states, "Chris definitely adds a lot to
the Band. He's one of the most zany people I've met. He
adds energy to all we do. I don't know about his interac
tion with the football team. I think it's really cool that his
identity is known, as opposed to the Cal Bear. Because of
this, he's thought of in much more friendly terms. It's
harder to hate the Tree. It's also kind of hard for Tree to

be a ferocious mascot, so it really mocks all the other mascots."
"I think it can be pretty stupid at times," agrees Rushing. "Any huge polystyrene fig
ure is going to be silly — be it a bear or whatever. The Tree, however, overpowers us with
silliness, thus serving its goal."
Still, a tree? Wilson can't quite understand that one. "I didn't vote for it. I guess that
you had to have a mascot and someone decided it would be a tree. They knew what they
were doing."
"Inventive" and "different" would be more positive adjectives coming from Rushing,
both for the Tree and the band. "We contribute to levity, but also raise spirit. We help to
teams we play for, and are especially exemplary during Big Game. We give all efforts,
physical and mental — painting ourselves, sleeping random places, not sleeping the day
of the game. We aren't just representing our team — it's not only the team coming into
the stadium on game day, but the entire school. We have to be ready. Our spirit is most
obviously manifest in our humor."
And many alumni like things as they are. "There are quite a few Band alumni who
still live in the area," Jahncke notes. "It seems Band members have a harder time leaving
than most. Many have season passes and some have even played with the Band. My dad
is also a Stanford alum."
"The Band is for both the students and alumni," says Rushing. "The students adore
us. We begin their undergraduate experience. We are also very much supported by
alumni, in terms of finances, and in terms of monetary support. And we play for alum
ni. We play at their tailgate parties. Some of alumni like us even more than students, and
that's great."
The fact remains, though, that the reason most alumni return is the Big Game itself,
amd the rivalry. While the Band and the Tree are an irreplaceable key to school spirit,
they are not the focal point of the Big Game. To some, the rivalry extends outside the
field, to an assertion of Stanford's superiority over Cal. To most of the people I talked
with, though, it remains a healthy sports rivalry. As Conrad Rushing put it,"l don't think
one school is superior to the other. This is a football rivalry."
So how does Stanford plan to retain the Axe? "Stick to our M.O. and play as hard as
we can as long as we can as smart as we can," answers Miller. However, as history has so
vividly illustrated, the winner of the Big Game is, before the final buzzer, a big question
mark.
"The outcome cannot be predicted. You could have first- and tenth-place teams, with
a complete upset by 45 points," Rushing reminds me.
"In the Big Game, records don't matter," Jahncke concurs. "The outcome totally can't
be predicted. I think it'll be a really close game, but I'd guess they'd beat us by a touch
down or two."
Then again, Cal's recent talent for penalty accumulation might work to Stanford's
advantage. The Big Game may be wrapped up in spirit, but it's still football.
Wilson agrees; when asked what he looks forward to, he answers, "Playing football.
The game itself. Winning."
"Everything," answers Miller to the same question. "The atmosphere, the competi
tion, the fans. It's just amazing." The Band, of course, sees things from a different per
spective. Rushing looks forward to "the huge outpouring of spirit. It may sound like
bullshit, but it's serious. Big Game is the one time people let it all out, and it's like magic
all around."
Spirit, though, can turn ugly, as both Cal and Stanford know. "Last year or maybe
two years ago," tells Jahncke. "There were some Stanford fans who were trying to hit Cal

band members, but they were hitting us instead! I can't
understand people being so passionate as to be violent."
Neither can Rushing. "Cal fans seem willing to resort to
violence at the drop of hat: Destroying the goalposts [in
1997], destroying the Tree [in 1996) and rioting. I don't
think it justifies retaliation, though." So how does the band
deal with Cal mockery? "We try to return mockery with
politeness. For example, when USC flips us off, [the band]
stands and waves back. It's a reflection of the fans; we're the
same group. 1 don't think retaliation is much of a consider
ation." Not for most fans, anyway. The weekend after the
Tree was stolen, some Stanford students allegedly wrote
"Stanford" in bleach on Berkeley's Faculty Glade, a scenic
area used for picnics and painting workshops.
Wilson hadn't heard about this, but agreed with me that
"there are more constructive ways they could retaliate." And
a few rogue fans aren't the best representation of our school.
As Miller says, "Stanford is just an amazing place. Everyone
here is a special person and very talented." How about
Berkeley? Jahncke told me, "The people are a lot cooler in
general. Everyone who goes to Cal wants to get into Stanford
but can't. And it's a lot more laid back. At Cal, classes are
bigger, while here, undergrads get a lot more attention."
Which explains why Cal fans sometimes call Stanford stu
dents spoiled.
Cattiness aside, the Big Game is all about fun. Were their
roles reversed, the team and the Band would still want to be
a part of it. "I'd play the saxophone," offensive tackle Wilson
states with confidence. #
"I'd want to be a running back," says saxophonist

Jahncke. "The last thing I'd want to be would be defense."
Has she ever thought of approaching someone on the team for a date? "I wouldn't
have any qualms against it. At a different school, I did." Has anyone? "No, I have no
knowledge of anything like that at Stanford." Miller replies.
In addition to fun, the Game involves a lot of memories, especially last year, which
marked the 100 th Big Game. Wilson reflects, "We got to play in the 100 th Big Game.last
year and I thought that was a real honor just to be a part a team that got to do that. It
was even more fun that we won the game.
"However, my favorite Big Game memory would probably be 1995, when we ended
the Big Game by winning, driving down and ending the game right after we scored a
touchdown." Miller adds, "All my memories have been good. We haven't lost yet." So
there's no bad blood, just as long as Stanford wins. Which we have consistently done in
the recent past. Still, Big Games are unpredictable, and Cal does have the better record
this year, as well as the home field advantage.

That advantage can be
yours as well. Take a walk
around Berkeley. Get to
know other architectural
colors be-sides orange
and yellow. Get to know
other cafes besides the
Co Ho. Walk up hills
which are green for
more than a few months
of the year. Absorb a bit
of Berkeley culture.
Enjoy street music and
observe Berkeley celebri
ties like the Hate Man
(he'll be the guy in a
skirt yelling at preach
ers) and Paul the Pillar.
Buy a full meal for less
than $10. Get to know a
real record store. See a
school immersed in a
lively city. It's not all that
bad. And when you're
done, enjoy the Game —
no matter who wins.

"Stanford" in bleach on Berkeley's Faculty Glade, a scenic
area used for picnics and painting workshops.
Wilson hadn't heard about this, but agreed with me that
"there are more constructive ways they could retaliate." And
a few rogue fans aren't the best representation of our school.
As Miller says, "Stanford is just an amazing place. Everyone
here is a special person and very talented." How about
Berkeley? Jahncke told me, "The people are a lot cooler in
general. Everyone who goes to Cal wants to get into Stanford
but can't. And it's a lot more laid back. At Cal, classes are
bigger, while here, undergrads get a lot more attention."
Which explains why Cal fans sometimes call Stanford stu
dents spoiled.
Cattiness aside, the Big Game is all about fun. Were their
roles reversed, the team and the Band would still want to be
a part of it. "I'd play the saxophone," offensive tackle Wilson
states with confidence. #
"I'd want to be a running back," says saxophonist

Jahncke. "The last thing I'd want to be would be defense."
Has she ever thought of approaching someone on the team for a date? "I wouldn't
have any qualms against it. At a different school, I did." Has anyone? "No, I have no
knowledge of anything like that at Stanford." Miller replies.
In addition to fun, the Game involves a lot of memories, especially last year, which
marked the 100 th Big Game. Wilson reflects, "We got to play in the 100 th Big Game.last
year and I thought that was a real honor just to be a part a team that got to do that. It
was even more fun that we won the game.
"However, my favorite Big Game memory would probably be 1995, when we ended
the Big Game by winning, driving down and ending the game right after we scored a
touchdown." Miller adds, "All my memories have been good. We haven't lost yet." So
there's no bad blood, just as long as Stanford wins. Which we have consistently done in
the recent past. Still, Big Games are unpredictable, and Cal does have the better record
this year, as well as the home field advantage.

That advantage can be
yours as well. Take a walk
around Berkeley. Get to
know other architectural
colors be-sides orange
and yellow. Get to know
other cafes besides the
Co Ho. Walk up hills
which are green for
more than a few months
of the year. Absorb a bit
of Berkeley culture.
Enjoy street music and
observe Berkeley celebri
ties like the Hate Man
(he'll be the guy in a
skirt yelling at preach

Buy a full meal for less
than $10. Get to know a
real record store. See a

lively city. It's not all that
bad. And when you're
done, enjoy the Game —
no matter who wins.

The traditional dance of the band's brass section

Just one example of the physical danger that befalls
those who make lascivious passes at the Tree
My mom was born in the Stanford Medical
Center. She attended football games and Big
Game bonfires while attending high school.
She met my father shortly after his graduation from
Stanford, and they've lived in the area ever since. 1 sup
pose you could say that Stanford is where my heritage lies
and 1 should thus be rooting for Stanford football on
Saturday.
Not quite. My alma mater, my sweatshirt and even my
byline betrays one simple fact: I am a Cal Bear. Heck,
when I went off to Cal in 1993, the Axe followed me. Yet
here I am — after four years at America's best public
school, I've become a Farm boy, a student at this Junior
University.
Still, 1 can appreciate school spirit when I see it, and
thus I thought it best to look at the other side of the coin,
at your — uh, 1 mean our — team and, perhaps even
more importantly, the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
The band's function is to support the team, but, let's
face it, the band and the team haven't always been on the
best of terms. The nadir was the horrific (or, if you're a
Cal fan, wonderful) 1982 game, in which, in commenta
tor Joe Starkey's words, "The Stanford Band cost their
team that ball game."
Cal was ahead by two. Then Stanford's Mark Harmon
made a 35-yard field goal, leaving four — yes, four —
seconds left on the clock. Enthusiasm broke out; as Starky
noted, "Only a miracle could save the Bears as Stanford
piles out on the field." The Band members were among
the revelers.
Then came "The Play." It was awkward — with laterals
all over the place — but it sure worked, just not in the
way anyone thought it would. As the defense tried to stop
Berkeley's Kevin Moen, Stanford band members blocked
Cardinal football players, resulting in the most unusual
moment in college football history. In the end zone,
Moen ran into Stanford trombonist Gary Tyrell, making
a bizarre yet successful touchdown.
Starkey, recovering from the excitement, simply stated,
"I guarantee you, if you watch college football for the rest
of your life, you will never again see or hear a game to
match this one for pure dramatic excitement in the most
spectacular, crazy, amazing remarkable games I have ever
seen." The aftermath was literally stunning to Cardinal
fans. "I have not seen a member of the Stanford Band so
much as move in the past three minutes. They are just
now beginning to try to get some semblance of sanity
back into their lives as they reflect on the fact that they in
a way helped the California Golden Bears win the 85th
Big Game here today by a score of 25-20." Stanford fans
later rationalized the game as "a lousy game with a
bizarre finish," but the fact remains that it was a horrible
day for them and a wonderful day for Cal fans.
Not that most people here were either back then. As
fifth-year senior and Cardinal offensive tackle Geoff
Wilson noted, "The reality of it is, of all the guys on the
team now, hardly any of them was conscious at that
point." And not just players, but students and fans as well.
Stunts like the band's allegedly racist halftime show at
Notre Dame last year still cause a bit a friction, however,
and I thought I'd ask the members of the band and the
team about their symbiotic relationship — and about
1982.
"The man was was down!" insists Band trombonist
and junior Conrad Rushing. "He was already in the end
zone when he ran into that trombone player. But what do
you want with refs at whatever they're paid by the hour?
Watch the replays; you'll see. As for the rest — no com

merit."
Junior tenor saxophonist Christina Jahncke is less
impassioned about The Play. "At this point, very few of
the band members are still around, so it's thought of in
terms of humor. Still, there are certain taboos related to
that. The clock was stopped near the end of one game,
and everyone said.'l hope it doesn't get stopped on four
seconds.' Three or five was okay, just not four."
Bygones are bygones, though, and the team would
rather deal with things that it is or has been a part of.
Wilson says,"I think you hear more about that from the
fans than the players. It was a long time ago, and none of
us was playing football back then."
So how does the team feel about the band now? "You
gotta their love enthusiasm and support. I think it gives
us something no other school has. They've had their ups
and downs, but everybody definitely remembers the
Band," says Kevin Miller, a punter and placekicker for the
Cardinal, and a fifth-year senior.
The band sure is a memorable part of the game expe
rience, especially since last year's Notre Dame show got it
in trouble with both universities and the media.
Members of the band stand their ground, though. "I

think that people who criticize the band have an
extremely lacking of sense of humor," says Rushing. "We
may poke fun at everything, but we do not attack people.
We are not 'the end of Tightness.' If comments are made
in fun, we accept them in fun. But the retaliation of press
after the Notre Dame game was not in fun."
Jahncke agrees. "I think in terms of Stanford people
and locals, they know that in halftime shows, we're going
to poke fun — so they know to take it all with a grain of
salt. Further away, we're not given as much benefit of the
doubt."
But everyone agrees that there's no band like the
Stanford band. Jahncke believes the band is superior to
that of its rival "because of the fact that we're a scatter

band, better than marching band because we can focus
less on field rehearsal, and more on music."
Football players agree on the band's strength. Wilson
says,"I think that the band is unique. I think that they've
gotten in some trouble, but that overall they try to play
themselves as a really unique organization, just like
Stanford is a unique organization."
Still, when it comes to the Cal band, "Their band isn't
all bad. Of course — no one's the same as us. We hang
out with the Cal band now and again," says Rushing. So
does this mean that we trust them? "Of course, we still
guard our Tree and equipment," adds Rushing.
Especially now. The Tree's kidnapping excited (some
would say aggravated) a rivalry which to most is only
applicable on game day. The opinion of those closest to
the game, though, contrasts with those of the officials. "1
think it was a fun addition to the rivalry," says Miller. "It's
inexcusable, but it's all in good fun. As long as nobody
gets hurt."
Wilson agrees, "I thought it was kind of in the tradi
tion of the Big Game —if you really know the
tradition — it follows the tradition that they've had of
one school stealing something of the other's. I didn't
think it was that big of a deal. Obviously, I didn't appre
ciate that it was something of ours that was stolen."
Still, stealing the mascot itself adds a new facet to the
old rivalry. "It's not part of the traditional rivalry, but
adds to it. I've got to hand it to the Phoenix Five; they
worked the publicity of the whole thing well," concedes
Rushing. "Still, they broke down a door, a window, and a
wall of the Shak."
Jahncke sees the spiritual victory as Stanford's, though.
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson 111 sent out a press release
reminding the Five that he, not fabric, was the real Tree,
and if they wanted to kidnap the Tree, they should kid
nap him. "I thought his press release about them kidnap
ping an inanimate object was hilarious. He knew there
was no way they would kidnap him, so it was his way of
one-upping them."
"I alternate between being mad and just seeing it as
funny, but it's past us at this point," says Rushing. "There's
no threat. The Tree has been liquidated. It's all right."
The Tree's "liquidation" didn't receive as much press as
its kidnapping. "We had to destroy it," adds Rushing, "It
was tainted; we can't have a Tree that was in the posses
sion of Cal people for weeks. It wouldn't be right. Plus it
was damn fun to shred." A new, untainted Tree will
replace the old.
The replacement ceremony was actually a lot of fun,
according to Jahncke. "We carried a coffin which Chris
popped out of. Then we sent the old Tree through a wood
chipper."
$1,000 through the wood chipper? "The Tree is actual
ly rather expensive," affirms Rushing. "It's probably a bit
more than $1,000, just in materials. Fabrics are actually
expensive — most people don't deal with making clothes
these days, so they laugh at it — but the Tree is detailed,
right down to the leaves. There's also an integral back
pack and an internal frame. It adds up."
But all agree what it's worth in terms of school spirit.
As Henderson himself put it, "What is the functional
value of the Tree? It is worth millions."
As Henderson's letter points out, however, it isn't the
fabric that makes the Tree but the person inside. "He's
really cool," Jahncke states, "Chris definitely adds a lot to
the Band. He's one of the most zany people I've met. He
adds energy to all we do. I don't know about his interac
tion with the football team. I think it's really cool that his
identity is known, as opposed to the Cal Bear. Because of
this, he's thought of in much more friendly terms. It's
harder to hate the Tree. It's also kind of hard for Tree to

hopes of distracting the Cal team. Simply divine!
be a ferocious mascot, so it really mocks all the other mascots."
"I think it can be pretty stupid at times," agrees Rushing. "Any huge polystyrene fig
ure is going to be silly — be it a bear or whatever. The Tree, however, overpowers us with
silliness, thus serving its goal."
Still, a tree? Wilson can't quite understand that one. "I didn't vote for it. I guess that
you had to have a mascot and someone decided it would be a tree. They knew what they
were doing."
"Inventive" and "different" would be more positive adjectives coming from Rushing,
both for the Tree and the band. "We contribute to levity, but also raise spirit. We help to
teams we play for, and are especially exemplary during Big Game. We give all efforts,
physical and mental — painting ourselves, sleeping random places, not sleeping the day
of the game. We aren't just representing our team — it's not only the team coming into
the stadium on game day, but the entire school. We have to be ready. Our spirit is most
obviously manifest in our humor."
And many alumni like things as they are. "There are quite a few Band alumni who
still live in the area," Jahncke notes. "It seems Band members have a harder time leaving
than most. Many have season passes and some have even played with the Band. My dad
is also a Stanford alum."
"The Band is for both the students and alumni," says Rushing. "The students adore
us. We begin their undergraduate experience. We are also very much supported by
alumni, in terms of finances, and in terms of monetary support. And we play for alum
ni. We play at their tailgate parties. Some of alumni like us even more than students, and
that's great."
The fact remains, though, that the reason most alumni return is the Big Game itself,
amd the rivalry. While the Band and the Tree are an irreplaceable key to school spirit,
they are not the focal point of the Big Game. To some, the rivalry extends outside the
field, to an assertion of Stanford's superiority over Cal. To most of the people I talked
with, though, it remains a healthy sports rivalry. As Conrad Rushing put it,"l don't think
one school is superior to the other. This is a football rivalry."
So how does Stanford plan to retain the Axe? "Stick to our M.O. and play as hard as
we can as long as we can as smart as we can," answers Miller. However, as history has so
vividly illustrated, the winner of the Big Game is, before the final buzzer, a big question
mark.
"The outcome cannot be predicted. You could have first- and tenth-place teams, with
a complete upset by 45 points," Rushing reminds me.
"In the Big Game, records don't matter," Jahncke concurs. "The outcome totally can't
be predicted. I think it'll be a really close game, but I'd guess they'd beat us by a touch
down or two."
Then again, Cal's recent talent for penalty accumulation might work to Stanford's
advantage. The Big Game may be wrapped up in spirit, but it's still football.
Wilson agrees; when asked what he looks forward to, he answers, "Playing football.
The game itself. Winning."
"Everything," answers Miller to the same question. "The atmosphere, the competi
tion, the fans. It's just amazing." The Band, of course, sees things from a different per
spective. Rushing looks forward to "the huge outpouring of spirit. It may sound like
bullshit, but it's serious. Big Game is the one time people let it all out, and it's like magic
all around."
Spirit, though, can turn ugly, as both Cal and Stanford know. "Last year or maybe
two years ago," tells Jahncke. "There were some Stanford fans who were trying to hit Cal

band members, but they were hitting us instead! I can't
understand people being so passionate as to be violent."
Neither can Rushing. "Cal fans seem willing to resort to
violence at the drop of hat: Destroying the goalposts [in
1997], destroying the Tree [in 1996) and rioting. I don't
think it justifies retaliation, though." So how does the band
deal with Cal mockery? "We try to return mockery with
politeness. For example, when USC flips us off, [the band]
stands and waves back. It's a reflection of the fans; we're the
same group. 1 don't think retaliation is much of a consider
ation." Not for most fans, anyway. The weekend after the
Tree was stolen, some Stanford students allegedly wrote
"Stanford" in bleach on Berkeley's Faculty Glade, a scenic
area used for picnics and painting workshops.
Wilson hadn't heard about this, but agreed with me that
"there are more constructive ways they could retaliate." And
a few rogue fans aren't the best representation of our school.
As Miller says, "Stanford is just an amazing place. Everyone
here is a special person and very talented." How about
Berkeley? Jahncke told me, "The people are a lot cooler in
general. Everyone who goes to Cal wants to get into Stanford
but can't. And it's a lot more laid back. At Cal, classes are
bigger, while here, undergrads get a lot more attention."
Which explains why Cal fans sometimes call Stanford stu
dents spoiled.
Cattiness aside, the Big Game is all about fun. Were their
roles reversed, the team and the Band would still want to be
a part of it. "I'd play the saxophone," offensive tackle Wilson
states with confidence. #
"I'd want to be a running back," says saxophonist

Jahncke. "The last thing I'd want to be would be defense."
Has she ever thought of approaching someone on the team for a date? "I wouldn't

knowledge of anything like that at Stanford." Miller replies.

than most. Many have season passes and some have even played with the Band. My dad
is also a Stanford alum."
"The Band is for both the students and alumni," says Rushing. "The students adore
us. We begin their undergraduate experience. We are also very much supported by
alumni, in terms of finances, and in terms of monetary support. And we play for alum
ni. We play at their tailgate parties. Some of alumni like us even more than students, and
that's great."
The fact remains, though, that the reason most alumni return is the Big Game itself,
amd the rivalry. While the Band and the Tree are an irreplaceable key to school spirit,
they are not the focal point of the Big Game. To some, the rivalry extends outside the
field, to an assertion of Stanford's superiority over Cal. To most of the people I talked
with, though, it remains a healthy sports rivalry. As Conrad Rushing put it,"l don't think
one school is superior to the other. This is a football rivalry."
So how does Stanford plan to retain the Axe? "Stick to our M.O. and play as hard as
we can as long as we can as smart as we can," answers Miller. However, as history has so
vividly illustrated, the winner of the Big Game is, before the final buzzer, a big question
mark.
"The outcome cannot be predicted. You could have first- and tenth-place teams, with
a complete upset by 45 points," Rushing reminds me.
"In the Big Game, records don't matter," Jahncke concurs. "The outcome totally can't
be predicted. I think it'll be a really close game, but I'd guess they'd beat us by a touch
down or two."
Then again, Cal's recent talent for penalty accumulation might work to Stanford's
advantage. The Big Game may be wrapped up in spirit, but it's still football.
Wilson agrees; when asked what he looks forward to, he answers, "Playing football.
The game itself. Winning."
"Everything," answers Miller to the same question. "The atmosphere, the competi
tion, the fans. It's just amazing." The Band, of course, sees things from a different per
spective. Rushing looks forward to "the huge outpouring of spirit. It may sound like
bullshit, but it's serious. Big Game is the one time people let it all out, and it's like magic
all around."
Spirit, though, can turn ugly, as both Cal and Stanford know. "Last year or maybe
two years ago," tells Jahncke. "There were some Stanford fans who were trying to hit Cal

band members, but they were hitting us instead! I can't
understand people being so passionate as to be violent."
Neither can Rushing. "Cal fans seem willing to resort to
violence at the drop of hat: Destroying the goalposts [in
1997], destroying the Tree [in 1996) and rioting. I don't
think it justifies retaliation, though." So how does the band
deal with Cal mockery? "We try to return mockery with
politeness. For example, when USC flips us off, [the band]
stands and waves back. It's a reflection of the fans; we're the
same group. 1 don't think retaliation is much of a consider
ation." Not for most fans, anyway. The weekend after the
Tree was stolen, some Stanford students allegedly wrote
"Stanford" in bleach on Berkeley's Faculty Glade, a scenic
area used for picnics and painting workshops.
Wilson hadn't heard about this, but agreed with me that
"there are more constructive ways they could retaliate." And
a few rogue fans aren't the best representation of our school.
As Miller says, "Stanford is just an amazing place. Everyone
here is a special person and very talented." How about
Berkeley? Jahncke told me, "The people are a lot cooler in
general. Everyone who goes to Cal wants to get into Stanford
but can't. And it's a lot more laid back. At Cal, classes are
bigger, while here, undergrads get a lot more attention."
Which explains why Cal fans sometimes call Stanford stu
dents spoiled.
Cattiness aside, the Big Game is all about fun. Were their
roles reversed, the team and the Band would still want to be
a part of it. "I'd play the saxophone," offensive tackle Wilson
states with confidence. #
"I'd want to be a running back," says saxophonist

Jahncke. "The last thing I'd want to be would be defense."
Has she ever thought of approaching someone on the team for a date? "I wouldn't
have any qualms against it. At a different school, I did." Has anyone? "No, I have no
knowledge of anything like that at Stanford." Miller replies.
In addition to fun, the Game involves a lot of memories, especially last year, which
marked the 100 th Big Game. Wilson reflects, "We got to play in the 100 th Big Game.last
year and I thought that was a real honor just to be a part a team that got to do that. It
was even more fun that we won the game.
"However, my favorite Big Game memory would probably be 1995, when we ended
the Big Game by winning, driving down and ending the game right after we scored a
touchdown." Miller adds, "All my memories have been good. We haven't lost yet." So
there's no bad blood, just as long as Stanford wins. Which we have consistently done in
the recent past. Still, Big Games are unpredictable, and Cal does have the better record
this year, as well as the home field advantage.

The traditional dance of the band's brass section

Just one example of the physical danger that befalls
those who make lascivious passes at the Tree
My mom was born in the Stanford Medical
Center. She attended football games and Big
Game bonfires while attending high school.
She met my father shortly after his graduation from
Stanford, and they've lived in the area ever since. 1 sup
pose you could say that Stanford is where my heritage lies
and 1 should thus be rooting for Stanford football on
Saturday.
Not quite. My alma mater, my sweatshirt and even my
byline betrays one simple fact: I am a Cal Bear. Heck,
when I went off to Cal in 1993, the Axe followed me. Yet
here I am — after four years at America's best public
school, I've become a Farm boy, a student at this Junior
University.
Still, 1 can appreciate school spirit when I see it, and
thus I thought it best to look at the other side of the coin,
at your — uh, 1 mean our — team and, perhaps even
more importantly, the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
The band's function is to support the team, but, let's
face it, the band and the team haven't always been on the
best of terms. The nadir was the horrific (or, if you're a
Cal fan, wonderful) 1982 game, in which, in commenta
tor Joe Starkey's words, "The Stanford Band cost their
team that ball game."
Cal was ahead by two. Then Stanford's Mark Harmon
made a 35-yard field goal, leaving four — yes, four —
seconds left on the clock. Enthusiasm broke out; as Starky
noted, "Only a miracle could save the Bears as Stanford
piles out on the field." The Band members were among
the revelers.
Then came "The Play." It was awkward — with laterals
all over the place — but it sure worked, just not in the
way anyone thought it would. As the defense tried to stop
Berkeley's Kevin Moen, Stanford band members blocked
Cardinal football players, resulting in the most unusual
moment in college football history. In the end zone,
Moen ran into Stanford trombonist Gary Tyrell, making
a bizarre yet successful touchdown.
Starkey, recovering from the excitement, simply stated,
"I guarantee you, if you watch college football for the rest
of your life, you will never again see or hear a game to
match this one for pure dramatic excitement in the most
spectacular, crazy, amazing remarkable games I have ever
seen." The aftermath was literally stunning to Cardinal
fans. "I have not seen a member of the Stanford Band so
much as move in the past three minutes. They are just
now beginning to try to get some semblance of sanity
back into their lives as they reflect on the fact that they in
a way helped the California Golden Bears win the 85th
Big Game here today by a score of 25-20." Stanford fans
later rationalized the game as "a lousy game with a
bizarre finish," but the fact remains that it was a horrible
day for them and a wonderful day for Cal fans.
Not that most people here were either back then. As
fifth-year senior and Cardinal offensive tackle Geoff
Wilson noted, "The reality of it is, of all the guys on the
team now, hardly any of them was conscious at that
point." And not just players, but students and fans as well.
Stunts like the band's allegedly racist halftime show at
Notre Dame last year still cause a bit a friction, however,
and I thought I'd ask the members of the band and the
team about their symbiotic relationship — and about
1982.
"The man was was down!" insists Band trombonist
and junior Conrad Rushing. "He was already in the end
zone when he ran into that trombone player. But what do
you want with refs at whatever they're paid by the hour?
Watch the replays; you'll see. As for the rest — no com

merit."
Junior tenor saxophonist Christina Jahncke is less
impassioned about The Play. "At this point, very few of
the band members are still around, so it's thought of in
terms of humor. Still, there are certain taboos related to
that. The clock was stopped near the end of one game,
and everyone said.'l hope it doesn't get stopped on four
seconds.' Three or five was okay, just not four."
Bygones are bygones, though, and the team would
rather deal with things that it is or has been a part of.
Wilson says,"I think you hear more about that from the
fans than the players. It was a long time ago, and none of
us was playing football back then."
So how does the team feel about the band now? "You
gotta their love enthusiasm and support. I think it gives
us something no other school has. They've had their ups
and downs, but everybody definitely remembers the
Band," says Kevin Miller, a punter and placekicker for the
Cardinal, and a fifth-year senior.
The band sure is a memorable part of the game expe
rience, especially since last year's Notre Dame show got it
in trouble with both universities and the media.
Members of the band stand their ground, though. "I

think that people who criticize the band have an
extremely lacking of sense of humor," says Rushing. "We
may poke fun at everything, but we do not attack people.
We are not 'the end of Tightness.' If comments are made
in fun, we accept them in fun. But the retaliation of press
after the Notre Dame game was not in fun."
Jahncke agrees. "I think in terms of Stanford people
and locals, they know that in halftime shows, we're going
to poke fun — so they know to take it all with a grain of
salt. Further away, we're not given as much benefit of the
doubt."
But everyone agrees that there's no band like the
Stanford band. Jahncke believes the band is superior to
that of its rival "because of the fact that we're a scatter

band, better than marching band because we can focus
less on field rehearsal, and more on music."
Football players agree on the band's strength. Wilson
says,"I think that the band is unique. I think that they've
gotten in some trouble, but that overall they try to play
themselves as a really unique organization, just like
Stanford is a unique organization."
Still, when it comes to the Cal band, "Their band isn't
all bad. Of course — no one's the same as us. We hang
out with the Cal band now and again," says Rushing. So
does this mean that we trust them? "Of course, we still
guard our Tree and equipment," adds Rushing.
Especially now. The Tree's kidnapping excited (some
would say aggravated) a rivalry which to most is only
applicable on game day. The opinion of those closest to
the game, though, contrasts with those of the officials. "1
think it was a fun addition to the rivalry," says Miller. "It's
inexcusable, but it's all in good fun. As long as nobody
gets hurt."
Wilson agrees, "I thought it was kind of in the tradi
tion of the Big Game —if you really know the
tradition — it follows the tradition that they've had of
one school stealing something of the other's. I didn't
think it was that big of a deal. Obviously, I didn't appre
ciate that it was something of ours that was stolen."
Still, stealing the mascot itself adds a new facet to the
old rivalry. "It's not part of the traditional rivalry, but
adds to it. I've got to hand it to the Phoenix Five; they
worked the publicity of the whole thing well," concedes
Rushing. "Still, they broke down a door, a window, and a
wall of the Shak."
Jahncke sees the spiritual victory as Stanford's, though.
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson 111 sent out a press release
reminding the Five that he, not fabric, was the real Tree,
and if they wanted to kidnap the Tree, they should kid
nap him. "I thought his press release about them kidnap
ping an inanimate object was hilarious. He knew there
was no way they would kidnap him, so it was his way of
one-upping them."
"I alternate between being mad and just seeing it as
funny, but it's past us at this point," says Rushing. "There's
no threat. The Tree has been liquidated. It's all right."
The Tree's "liquidation" didn't receive as much press as
its kidnapping. "We had to destroy it," adds Rushing, "It
was tainted; we can't have a Tree that was in the posses
sion of Cal people for weeks. It wouldn't be right. Plus it
was damn fun to shred." A new, untainted Tree will
replace the old.
The replacement ceremony was actually a lot of fun,
according to Jahncke. "We carried a coffin which Chris
popped out of. Then we sent the old Tree through a wood
chipper."
$1,000 through the wood chipper? "The Tree is actual
ly rather expensive," affirms Rushing. "It's probably a bit
more than $1,000, just in materials. Fabrics are actually
expensive — most people don't deal with making clothes
these days, so they laugh at it — but the Tree is detailed,
right down to the leaves. There's also an integral back
pack and an internal frame. It adds up."
But all agree what it's worth in terms of school spirit.
As Henderson himself put it, "What is the functional
value of the Tree? It is worth millions."
As Henderson's letter points out, however, it isn't the
fabric that makes the Tree but the person inside. "He's
really cool," Jahncke states, "Chris definitely adds a lot to
the Band. He's one of the most zany people I've met. He
adds energy to all we do. I don't know about his interac
tion with the football team. I think it's really cool that his
identity is known, as opposed to the Cal Bear. Because of
this, he's thought of in much more friendly terms. It's
harder to hate the Tree. It's also kind of hard for Tree to

hopes of distracting the Cal team. Simply divine!
be a ferocious mascot, so it really mocks all the other mascots."
"I think it can be pretty stupid at times," agrees Rushing. "Any huge polystyrene fig
ure is going to be silly — be it a bear or whatever. The Tree, however, overpowers us with
silliness, thus serving its goal."
Still, a tree? Wilson can't quite understand that one. "I didn't vote for it. I guess that
you had to have a mascot and someone decided it would be a tree. They knew what they
were doing."
"Inventive" and "different" would be more positive adjectives coming from Rushing,
both for the Tree and the band. "We contribute to levity, but also raise spirit. We help to
teams we play for, and are especially exemplary during Big Game. We give all efforts,
physical and mental — painting ourselves, sleeping random places, not sleeping the day
of the game. We aren't just representing our team — it's not only the team coming into
the stadium on game day, but the entire school. We have to be ready. Our spirit is most
obviously manifest in our humor."
And many alumni like things as they are. "There are quite a few Band alumni who
still live in the area," Jahncke notes. "It seems Band members have a harder time leaving
than most. Many have season passes and some have even played with the Band. My dad
is also a Stanford alum."
"The Band is for both the students and alumni," says Rushing. "The students adore
us. We begin their undergraduate experience. We are also very much supported by
alumni, in terms of finances, and in terms of monetary support. And we play for alum
ni. We play at their tailgate parties. Some of alumni like us even more than students, and
that's great."

we can as long as we can as smart as we can," answers Miller. However, as history has so
vividly illustrated, the winner of the Big Game is, before the final buzzer, a big question
mark.

a complete upset by 45 points," Rushing reminds me.
