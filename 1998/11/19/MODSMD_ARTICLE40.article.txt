## The
						Big Game Beat Cal! Never turn your back on the band... 
### Michael Baer Contributing writer 
My mom was born in the Stanford Medical
Center. She attended football games and Big
Game bonfires while attending high school.
She met my father shortly after his graduation from
Stanford, and they've lived in the area ever since. 1 sup
pose you could say that Stanford is where my heritage lies
and 1 should thus be rooting for Stanford football on
Saturday.
Not quite. My alma mater, my sweatshirt and even my
byline betrays one simple fact: I am a Cal Bear. Heck,
when I went off to Cal in 1993, the Axe followed me. Yet
here I am — after four years at America's best public
school, I've become a Farm boy, a student at this Junior
University.
Still, 1 can appreciate school spirit when I see it, and
thus I thought it best to look at the other side of the coin,
at your — uh, 1 mean our — team and, perhaps even
more importantly, the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
The band's function is to support the team, but, let's
face it, the band and the team haven't always been on the
best of terms. The nadir was the horrific (or, if you're a
Cal fan, wonderful) 1982 game, in which, in commenta
tor Joe Starkey's words, "The Stanford Band cost their
team that ball game."
Cal was ahead by two. Then Stanford's Mark Harmon
made a 35-yard field goal, leaving four — yes, four —
seconds left on the clock. Enthusiasm broke out; as Starky
noted, "Only a miracle could save the Bears as Stanford
piles out on the field." The Band members were among
the revelers.
Then came "The Play." It was awkward — with laterals
all over the place — but it sure worked, just not in the
way anyone thought it would. As the defense tried to stop
Berkeley's Kevin Moen, Stanford band members blocked
Cardinal football players, resulting in the most unusual
moment in college football history. In the end zone,
Moen ran into Stanford trombonist Gary Tyrell, making
a bizarre yet successful touchdown.
Starkey, recovering from the excitement, simply stated,
"I guarantee you, if you watch college football for the rest
of your life, you will never again see or hear a game to
match this one for pure dramatic excitement in the most
spectacular, crazy, amazing remarkable games I have ever
seen." The aftermath was literally stunning to Cardinal
fans. "I have not seen a member of the Stanford Band so
much as move in the past three minutes. They are just
now beginning to try to get some semblance of sanity
back into their lives as they reflect on the fact that they in
a way helped the California Golden Bears win the 85th
Big Game here today by a score of 25-20." Stanford fans
later rationalized the game as "a lousy game with a
bizarre finish," but the fact remains that it was a horrible
day for them and a wonderful day for Cal fans.
Not that most people here were either back then. As
fifth-year senior and Cardinal offensive tackle Geoff
Wilson noted, "The reality of it is, of all the guys on the
team now, hardly any of them was conscious at that
point." And not just players, but students and fans as well.
Stunts like the band's allegedly racist halftime show at
Notre Dame last year still cause a bit a friction, however,
and I thought I'd ask the members of the band and the
team about their symbiotic relationship — and about
1982.
"The man was was down!" insists Band trombonist
and junior Conrad Rushing. "He was already in the end
zone when he ran into that trombone player. But what do
you want with refs at whatever they're paid by the hour?
Watch the replays; you'll see. As for the rest — no com

merit."
Junior tenor saxophonist Christina Jahncke is less
impassioned about The Play. "At this point, very few of
the band members are still around, so it's thought of in
terms of humor. Still, there are certain taboos related to
that. The clock was stopped near the end of one game,
and everyone said.'l hope it doesn't get stopped on four
seconds.' Three or five was okay, just not four."
Bygones are bygones, though, and the team would
rather deal with things that it is or has been a part of.
Wilson says,"I think you hear more about that from the
fans than the players. It was a long time ago, and none of
us was playing football back then."
So how does the team feel about the band now? "You
gotta their love enthusiasm and support. I think it gives
us something no other school has. They've had their ups
and downs, but everybody definitely remembers the
Band," says Kevin Miller, a punter and placekicker for the
Cardinal, and a fifth-year senior.
The band sure is a memorable part of the game expe
rience, especially since last year's Notre Dame show got it
in trouble with both universities and the media.
Members of the band stand their ground, though. "I

think that people who criticize the band have an
extremely lacking of sense of humor," says Rushing. "We
may poke fun at everything, but we do not attack people.
We are not 'the end of Tightness.' If comments are made
in fun, we accept them in fun. But the retaliation of press
after the Notre Dame game was not in fun."
Jahncke agrees. "I think in terms of Stanford people
and locals, they know that in halftime shows, we're going
to poke fun — so they know to take it all with a grain of
salt. Further away, we're not given as much benefit of the
doubt."
But everyone agrees that there's no band like the
Stanford band. Jahncke believes the band is superior to
that of its rival "because of the fact that we're a scatter

band, better than marching band because we can focus
less on field rehearsal, and more on music."
Football players agree on the band's strength. Wilson
says,"I think that the band is unique. I think that they've
gotten in some trouble, but that overall they try to play
themselves as a really unique organization, just like
Stanford is a unique organization."
Still, when it comes to the Cal band, "Their band isn't
all bad. Of course — no one's the same as us. We hang
out with the Cal band now and again," says Rushing. So
does this mean that we trust them? "Of course, we still
guard our Tree and equipment," adds Rushing.
Especially now. The Tree's kidnapping excited (some
would say aggravated) a rivalry which to most is only
applicable on game day. The opinion of those closest to
the game, though, contrasts with those of the officials. "1
think it was a fun addition to the rivalry," says Miller. "It's
inexcusable, but it's all in good fun. As long as nobody
gets hurt."
Wilson agrees, "I thought it was kind of in the tradi
tion of the Big Game —if you really know the
tradition — it follows the tradition that they've had of
one school stealing something of the other's. I didn't
think it was that big of a deal. Obviously, I didn't appre
ciate that it was something of ours that was stolen."
Still, stealing the mascot itself adds a new facet to the
old rivalry. "It's not part of the traditional rivalry, but
adds to it. I've got to hand it to the Phoenix Five; they
worked the publicity of the whole thing well," concedes
Rushing. "Still, they broke down a door, a window, and a
wall of the Shak."
Jahncke sees the spiritual victory as Stanford's, though.
Stanford Tree Chris Henderson 111 sent out a press release
reminding the Five that he, not fabric, was the real Tree,
and if they wanted to kidnap the Tree, they should kid
nap him. "I thought his press release about them kidnap
ping an inanimate object was hilarious. He knew there
was no way they would kidnap him, so it was his way of
one-upping them."
"I alternate between being mad and just seeing it as
funny, but it's past us at this point," says Rushing. "There's
no threat. The Tree has been liquidated. It's all right."
The Tree's "liquidation" didn't receive as much press as
its kidnapping. "We had to destroy it," adds Rushing, "It
was tainted; we can't have a Tree that was in the posses
sion of Cal people for weeks. It wouldn't be right. Plus it
was damn fun to shred." A new, untainted Tree will
replace the old.
The replacement ceremony was actually a lot of fun,
according to Jahncke. "We carried a coffin which Chris
popped out of. Then we sent the old Tree through a wood
chipper."
$1,000 through the wood chipper? "The Tree is actual
ly rather expensive," affirms Rushing. "It's probably a bit
more than $1,000, just in materials. Fabrics are actually
expensive — most people don't deal with making clothes
these days, so they laugh at it — but the Tree is detailed,
right down to the leaves. There's also an integral back
pack and an internal frame. It adds up."
But all agree what it's worth in terms of school spirit.
As Henderson himself put it, "What is the functional
value of the Tree? It is worth millions."
As Henderson's letter points out, however, it isn't the
fabric that makes the Tree but the person inside. "He's
really cool," Jahncke states, "Chris definitely adds a lot to
the Band. He's one of the most zany people I've met. He
adds energy to all we do. I don't know about his interac
tion with the football team. I think it's really cool that his
identity is known, as opposed to the Cal Bear. Because of
this, he's thought of in much more friendly terms. It's
harder to hate the Tree. It's also kind of hard for Tree to

The band models the latest fall fashions in the
hopes of distracting the Cal team. Simply divine!
