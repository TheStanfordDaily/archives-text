## The 						most irritating time of the year 'Christmas' with Jonathan Taylor Thomas 
### 
I went into "I'll Be Home for Christmas" with an open mind. I tried to think about
what audience Disney was targeting. I tried to think about how cute it was that I
. was in a theater surrounded by a bunch of kids whose parents had brought them
to see a "family" movie. I was still disappointed when I left.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas (henceforth referred to as Jonny) plays an 18-year-old who
is living away from his New York family while going to school in Los Angeles. I already
had issues with this premise. First of all, we are introduced to a "Palisades College" in
Pacific Palisades, Calif. OK, I'm confused; is he in college or in high school? To main
tain my sanity, I decided he was in a prep school.

We learn that Jake is a "selfish" guy. He wants to go to a tropical resort with
his girlfriend instead of going home for Christmas. Why? For now, we know it's
because he's an arrogant teenager. We'll find out more later. His girlfriend is
shocked at this scenario and tells him she has to go home and spend time with
her family. More problems with the movie: The girlfriend is a gorgeous college
aged bombshell, and Jonny-boy Jake doesn't look a day older than 15. This
makes for a very unbelievable relationship, which should (I hope) alienate
Thomas' teenie-bopper fan base.
We then get the basic, predictable plot outline: Jake's Dad calls him and says
that if he makes it home for Christmas, he'll give him the antique Porsche that
they spent so much time restoring together (yeah, that's believable ... smirk,
smirk). It isn't a hard decision for him to make. Hell just trade his old airline
tickets for new ones to New York, right? Wrong.
In one of his "I'm Zach from 'Saved by the Bell' " deals with some buddies,
Jonny ends up screwing up their history final They end up dropping him off
in the desert with a Santa Claus costume glued to his body. The sleazy leader of
the bad boyz ends up being the only person who can give Jake's girlfriend a ride
to New York.
So that's the plot: Cocky boy has to hitchhike from L.A. to New York by
Christmas Eve, while his girlfriend is being driven there by some sleazy punk.
Another problem: Can't rich people who go to prep schools afford plane tick
ets to New York instead of having to drive? The rest of the movie is a patch
work of scenes that follow Jake across the country, obviously ending up in New
York for Christmas Eve (sorry, 1 hate to ruin the surprise ending).
I normally suspend all disbelief in "seasonal" movies (action movies in the

summer, angel movies during the winter). The problem was, there were no big super
natural forces to "buy into." There was no angel helping some guy see the meaning of
life. The individual scenes that led up to the ending had to be good. Unfortunately, they
weren't. Every scene was contrived, included to either fill time or create fodder for one
liners. It's a shame, because Disney has the resources to put out better stuff (like its
entire animation division). Ultimately, this movie is just out there to milk Jonathan
Taylor Thomas' fan base, and doesn't even pretend to have a message.
Unless, of course, the message is "Be the cocky, pubescent kid and still get the Porsche
and the hot girl."
