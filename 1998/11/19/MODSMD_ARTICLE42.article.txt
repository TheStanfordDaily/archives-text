# 'The Eel’
## A 						Japanese film about redemption, acceptance, and yes, talking sea creatures 
### 
p~-w—■ \ he main plot of "The Eel" begins after Takuro
(Koji Yakusho, "Shall We Dance") is paroled from
JL jail eight years after killing his wife (Misa
Shimizu) in a fit of rage after catching her with her lover.
Before Takuro leaves the prison, the guards remind him
to take his pet, an eel he kept in the prison pond during
his sentence. His parole officer thinks his eel is a strange
pet, but Takuro tells him that the eel understands him
and doesn't tell him anything he doesn't want to hear.
(Yes, the eel actually talks.)
Takuro starts life again in a new town, where nobody
knows about his past except his parole officer. He has
learned to be a barber in prison and fixes up an old bar
ber shop to use as his home and business. There doesn't
seem to be much change in his behavior — he's still very
stoic and reserved. The parole officer's wife suggests that
Takuro isn't remorseful about his actions.
I.ife is pretty uneventful for Takuro. He meets some
interesting people in the coastal town's community. One
man is a UFO buff and thinks he's going to channel

extraterrestrials with Takuro's barber pole. Another
neighbor goes fishing with Takuro and has insights on the
migration habits of eels. But things don't get interesting
until he happens upon a woman who has apparently tried
to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. He takes her to
the hospital and saves her life. She later comes by his shop
and asks him for a job. He doesn't seem to have much
choice, since his parole officer's wife brought her.
The rest of the movie deals with the relationship that
develops between Takuro and Keiko (strangely enough,
also played by Misa Shimizu), which is intertwined with
the goings-on in this small town. The townspeople inter
act with Keiko and Takuro on a daily basis in this close
community. But Takuro always seems resistant to having
a relationship with Keiko. He spurns her gestures when
they seem anything more than businesslike. We
empathize when Keiko stays up one night to bring Takuro
a meal while he is fishing, but he just ignores her and
keeps fishing.
We find out that Keiko's mother is in a mental hospi

tal. Keiko has apparently left her boyfriend, who
promised to divorce his wife and marry her. He has got
ten Keiko to promise to help him out financially with her
mother's savings. The climax of the movie comes when
he brings his band of professional thugs to find Keiko and
get "his" money back. The scene is intense, because we
know that Takuro can't get into any trouble, or he'll be
back in jail. The resolution at the end of the scene is a def
inite shock.
"The Eel" is rich in dialogue and has interesting char
acters who care about each other. We end up caring about
them too. We wonder why Takuro can only relate to an
eel, or why Keiko has such an unrelenting need to care for
Takuro. The story is very subtle; much of the action
revolves around witnessing the actors' facial expressions
as they interact with each other. I recommend this movie
as a excursion into the lives of offbeat characters seeking
redemption, meaning and other elusive qualities of life.
