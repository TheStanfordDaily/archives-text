# Woody does limp with 'Celebrity'
## Too many stars and not enough shine 
### 
Woody is back to his good old pretentious
self in glorious black and white with his
newest eccentric offering, "Celebrity."
Keep in mind that the absence of color in Mr.
Allen's films has resulted in classics from
"Broadway Danny Rose" to "Manhattan" and also
one of his worst films, "Shadows and Fog." Lately,
though, Woody has been virtually an exclusively
color filmmaker, writing and directing such acces
sible hits as "Manhattan Murder Mystery," "Mighty
Aphrodite" and "Everyone Says 1 Love You." This is
more vintage Woody, though: With "Celebrity,"
Allen flaunts his intellectualism, making references
to old films and works of literature. Even T.S.
Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" gets a
token mention.

It seems as though Allen has attempted to throw
in as many celebrities as he could into the 113

minutes of gritty footage. Keep your eyes peeled for Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco,
Donald Trump, Hank Azaria and the illustrious Charlize Theron ("Two Days in the
Valley"). If you blink, you may miss them. Even though Leonardo DiCaprio has star
billing on the posters, he only gets about 10 minutes of screen time. Sorry, girls.
The result is an uneven product, one that introduces us to people without giving us
a chance to really find out what makes them tick. The film is a pastiche of loosely relat
ed characters who are consumed or obsessed by the notion of gaining fame. Allen dab
bled in this star-cramming technique in "Deconstructing Harry" and many other films,
but not to this extreme. At least with "Harry" we had Woody Allen to hold our interest
throughout the film.
Here, we don't. Instead, for some odd, incomprehensible reason, Kenneth Branagh
takes on the traditional Woody role as entertainment journalist Lee Simon. And while

Branagh does a fine job mimicking many of his
characteristics, we still wish the original nebbish
Woody would have nabbed the role for himself.
Shakespeare is one matter, but few seem to be up
to the task of Woody Allen.
Melanie Griffith plays herself again (surprise!)
as ditzy film actress Nicole Olivier. Winona Ryder,
too, doesn't really stretch her range any further as
the indecisive performer Nola. Bebe Neuwirth
almost steals the whole film as the hooker who
educates Simon's ex-wife, Robyn (Judy Davis) on
how to perform fellatio on a banana. I won't give
it away, but for all intents and purposes, we'll just
call it"the choking scene."
Judy Davis, though, is the real anchor of this
picture. Appropriately neurotic and insane yet
again, her demeanor dominates any scene she's in.
While Woody skillfully handles her in previous
films with his own nervous presence, Branagh

doesn't seem to be up to the task.
Leo does a fine job as the violent, abusive cultural icon Brandon Darrow. Somehow,
though, I don't think he's acting in this one. But I'm just guessing.
In the end, Allen asks why we choose to celebrate the stars of our society. We see the
pros and cons of fame in many different ways, but what's missing is a throughline:
something to hold the whole piece together as a film. These lives are superficial and
simply not engaging enough.
This is not at all to say that "Celebrity" is a bad film. In fact, it is one of the better
films from a year that has produced mostly dreck. When we see Woody Allen on a mar
quee, though, we have high expectations, and here they're simply not met.
