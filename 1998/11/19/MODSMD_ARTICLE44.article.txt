# Schmuck & Putz
## 'I Still Know' that this is a really bad film 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
This weekend, horror flick fans Schmuck and Putz
were subjected to an extremely frightening picture: "I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer." They found it
scary not for its violent murders or moments of suspense,
hut rather for its entire concept. The fact that industry
experts were willing to dump loads of money into this
horrible flick gave them nightmares for nights after the
screening. In one of these grotesque dreams, Putz
dreamed about a giant Jennifer Love Hewitt who,
among other things, was deviously planning to take over
the entertainment industry with her work But that's
beside the point...
Putz: Boo! Did I scare you?
That's about as spine tingling as director Danny
Cannon's sequel to "I Know What You Did Last Summer"
gets. If you tried to make a really bad movie, I'm con
vinced that you probably couldn't do a better job.
Don't believe me? Here's the plot (no joke): Julie James
(Hewitt) and the gang (Brandy et. al.) win a trip to the
Bahamas for a weekend on a radio call-in show. All goes
awry when they arrive at an abandoned hotel and discov
er that they are staying during the small island's hurricane
season. The man with the hook starts ripping things
up ... yada yada yada, a lot of people die.
Pretty pathetic. In fact, we could excuse this film
entirely if it weren't for the deft craft portrayed by a very
fine newcomer. Schmuck, I think you'll agree, but I feel
that Ellerine! (yes, her name has an exclamation mark in
the credits) shines as the second housekeeper. As Olga,
Ellerine! does not speak one word in her five seconds on
the screen, and that's perhaps what's so powerful about
her breakthrough performance. As a keen observer of
extras in films, I was particularly impressed by Ellerine! 's
smooth delivery of her shrill scream when the hook slash
es her neck. Also, in the moments before her demise, the
way in which she rolls her cleaning cart has a certain
quiet, noble dignity reminiscent of Gregory Peck in "To
Kill A Mockingbird."
In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb here: I'm con
vinced that Ellerine! may be the third most significant
extra in the history of film, following closely behind Ernie
DeLongpre (Munchkin 17 in"The Wizard of Oz") and
the collective Oompa Loompas in "Willy Wonka and the

Chocolate Factory." Ifs almost necessary, though tragic,
that screenwriter Trey Callaway kills off Olga, for she's
such a compelling presence that no audience would care
about any of the other characters if she stuck around for
the film's entirety. William Shakespeare took the same
measures with likeable Mercutio in "Romeo and Juliet" to

draw attention to the star-crossed lovers.
Schmuclc Olga is certainly a compelling presence in
the picture; a picture that parents should definitely take
their whole family to. Wow! The publicity department has
certainly done a great job of breast-feeding — the movie
poster shows all of the characters and Hewitt's breasts on
the same scale. Toddlers can relate. Religious values are

also explored in the nightmare church sequence. As
Hewitt confesses her deepest, deadliest, darkest secret to a
priest, mom and dad can fully appreciate their early
Sunday excursions to church. If you're Jewish, it'll make
you want to convert!
The direction of this piece draws us in with its intense
personalization of Brandy's buttocks. As she swaggers
through the room, iier spandex pants curve to her firm
shape, a sassy move that grabs the audiences attention
and sends the whoie family into a warm embrace.
In an age of sexual promiscuity, "I Still Know What You
Did" evokes the deadly consequences that being a "p'ay
er" can produce. Ben Willis, a player, uses his hook to
emasculate himself. A dirty phallic symbol, the hook is an
extension of his pf-nis —
Putz: Wait a second, are we allowed to say penis? I
thought we were only allowed to use euphemisms for that
part of the body.
Schmuck: Shut up, Putz. Penis! Penis! Penis! As I was
saying, this filthy penis rips through people without any
due courtesy or well-deserved respect. It has a life of its
own and nothing can stop it. It's a runaway penis!
Putz: Stop using that word! I'm pretty sure that our
ruthless slavemaster Kong distinctly said not to use the
word penis .. oops.
Schmuck: Stop interrupting my writing, penis.
Putz: My name is Putz. But seriously, I am deeply con
cerned with the drastic effects that this film will have on
the tourism of the Caribbean islands. I mean, this vaca
tion wasn't exactly lying out by the pool sipping Sex on
the Beach.
Schmuck: Penis! Penis! Penis!
Putz; That's it! I'm ending this article right now!
The Bottom Line:
Putz: Don't pay to see this movie or
they'll make a third.
Schmuck: A penis the whole family can enjoy.


Cover me up, Brandy! Schmuck and Putz are talk
ing about my heaving bosom!
