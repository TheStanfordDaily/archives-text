## U2 The 						Best of 1980-1990' 
### 
In 1981, when U2 began to get a small amount of exposure from its first single, "I
Will Follow," lead singer Bono told rock critic Bill Flanagan that his model for the
group was the Rolling Stones, a band of equals who stayed together for years and
years. Considering that at the time U2 was battling for simple musical competence,
Bono had no basis for making such a prediction, but true to his word, U2 became the
only modern equivalent to the Stones. The band stayed near the top of the industry for
two decades, produced innumerable pop masterpieces, and now has the luxury of defin
ing its own future.
On the way, however, U2 has been criticized for being too serious, too mainstream,
too bombastic, too Christian, too much. Making matters worse, the band's fan base took
its words for orthodoxy; the L' 2 ghetto is one of the most infamous musical dead ends
of our generation 10 these listeners, U2 is the alpha and the omega of music. The
group's roots arc irrelevant and the righteous message is more important than contem
poraries' detached irony or casual nihilism. In other words, liking U2 could be an all-or
nothing affair.
Still, what resonates from U2's recent "The Best of 1980-1990" collection is that the
band's music is just as essential as that of its more celebrated "alternative" peers. The
Replacements may have earned their stripes by playing sloppily, and Michael Stipe may
have achieved the status of a demi-god by being impossible to understand, but their
roots were ultimately no different than U2's major influences.
The four lads from Dublin, regardless of their faith and their passion, created a band
born from the punk revolution of 1977. They learned to play from Patti Smith and the
Velvet Underground, as well as "populist" bands including The Who and The Police. U2
discovered its introspective atmosphere in the sound of Roxy Music and David Bowie.
Further, in the best DIY tradition, the band members learned to play as they started
writing and touring, building a unique sound built on melodic bass, cascading tom
toms and sparse, rhythmic guitar. Indeed, the Edge's guitar technique was perhaps the
decade's most interesting development of the Modern Lovers' and Television's innova
tions on Lou Reed's original work. More importantly, however, Bono's voice developed
into a full-throated fury that gave U2's sound instant humanity.
The best-of collection contains few surprises — the omission of "Two Hearts Beat As
One," the inclusion of "The Unforgettable Fire" — and thus no filler. The album is a
monument, and in this proper context the group's very best songs, such as "Bad,""With
Or Without You," "New Year's Day"and "Desire," are more than hits; they are cultural
touchstones. Conversely, borderline tracks such as "1 Will Follow" and "When Love
Comes To Town" hold up suprisingly well. The only disappointment is the inclusion of
the inferior, muddled single mix of "The Sweetest Thing," which lacks the vibrancy of
the B-Side version.
As was once said about the Beatles, disliking this album is as perverse as disliking the
sun. Still, the album ends at an awkward spot, with four tracks from "Rattle And Hum"
and no mention of the emancipatory masterpiece "Achtung Baby." This omission would
be a bit like excluding "Exile On Main Street" from a retrospective on the Stones' peak
years. T his arrangement leaves the U2 story unfinished, which may be a conscious move
on the band's part by stating that its story is indeed not finished yet.
Early versions of this best-of collection also contain a disc of '80s B-Sides as a bonus,
which contains a number of notable tracks. "A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel" may be
the best expression of Bono's Elvis fixation, and "Silver And Gold" matches "Pride" blow
for blow. The elegant instrumentals "Bass Trap" and "Endless Deep" are worth a listen,

as is a moody cover of Patti Smith's "Dancing Barefoot." A remarkably restrained ver
sion of "Unchained Melody" can also be affecting for those who aren't married to the
original. The rest of the disc is good but not great; these tracks have U2 quality but not
U2 magic.
Ultimately, U2's music pokes a hole in the myth behind alternative music — that
popular music can't be good. The band achieved a level of success and longevity, both
commercially and artistically, matched only by the Rolling Stones. If the alternative
community wants to disown the band for its achievements, then perhaps the punk rev
olution was a failure after all.
Instead of being free from the pretensions of '70s art-rock, the post-punk age has
been one of mistrust, confusion, and dadaism. Maybe Johnny Rotten was right when he
famously said that the Sex Pistols finished rock 'n' roll. Maybe the musical fetishism of
Yes and Pink Floyd was simply replaced by the paranoid individualism of Husker Du
and R.E.M. Maybe good rock bands have disappeared because we refuse to believe in
them anymore.
