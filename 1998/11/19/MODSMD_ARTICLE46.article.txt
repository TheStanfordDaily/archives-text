# The 						Afghan Whigs
## '1965' 
### 
t i 1 he Afghan Whigs' singer, Greg Dulli, has been
known to take half-hour cigarette breaks on stage
1 during the band's concerts. Another story: He dis
appeared into the depths of New Orleans for a few days
near the end of recording the Whigs' latest release," 1965,"
and returned with the album's final track, the mysteri
ously titled "The Vampire Lanois." He refused to discuss
the origin of the song's title, supposedly out of a super -
naturally oriented fear.
You would think a band that takes itself as seriously as
The Afghan Whigs could do itself good by lightening up
a little. That's exactly what the Whigs have done on
"1965." In the two years since the band's last release, the
underrated "Black Love," the group has gotten more
upbeat, more optimistic and more polished. There are
fewer songs about violent relationships and men acting
like animals and more songs about straightforward lust.

The atmosphere of New Orleans permeates the album
through bits of French, a peppy horn section and a gen
eral loosening up of the band's usually tense nerves.
1 hate to say it, but I don't think the changes worked.
The reason 1 hate to say this is that The Afghan Whigs'
horribly angry and depressing major label debut,
"Gentlemen," is one of my favorite albums of all time.
Still, "1965" has a few great moments — in particular,
"The Slide Song" delivers the emotional intensity that
one expects from the Whigs, with lines like "Baby / Don't
make me worry aboutcha / They say that
goodbye / Arrives by design / Who do you think about
when you're lonely?" The Whigs' deep intensity lies in
vocalist Greg Dulli's delivery of direct, pointed lines like
these in a slow wail of contempt.
Dulli has one of the greatest voices in rock, a m be of
grungy harshness and soulful whispers. Yet on "1965," the

Whigs brought in a female jazz vocalist, Susan Marshall,
to sing backup. She's a fine singer, but her only contribu
tion to the tracks she sings on is to lighten and diffuse
what might have been a dense and focused musical tex
ture.
If you're reading this and thinking, "But why would I
want to listen to something dark and melancholy? I like
light-hearted songs that I can dance to," then "1965"
might be The Afghan Whigs album for you. Many of the
songs, such as "Somethin' Hot" and "Crazy," have hooks
as catchy as those on other Whigs albums, and Rick
McCollum's guitar is as furious as ever. But if you are a
fan of the Whigs' earlier work, "1965" will probably dis
appoint.
