# Leah Andreone
## 'Alchemy' 
### 
Trying to stir up something
new with her second
album, "Alchemy," Leah
Andreone has instead managed to
make a set of music that's decep
tively generic and bland.
With a voice that's almost
Alanis, not quite Gwen Stefan;,
and very angst-ridden Barbie (ii
Barbie had a voice), Andreone
lends to use her metallic edge as an
excuse for insistent yell-singing
and contrived frustration. The
album sports a few gems of
intrigue but for the most part is
either too formulaic or too forced.
Andreone's harsh, heavy
approach to this album tends to
yield interesting song beginnings,
with some Latin stirrings on
"Sunny Day"and a bit of funk;/
head-bobbing material on "Porn,"

but she manages to ruin most
songs past the first 30 seconds. A
funky guitar solo is overrun with
whiny, repetitive lyrics, or a flashy
instrumental is complemented by
saucy vocals, which quickly degen
erate to more annoying angst.
Although most of the album
consists of these kinds of tunes,
Andreone slows her pace and sings
with real conviction on some
songs, and then her potential
shows much more clearly. The
concluding tracks take on this
more mature sound.
"You Don't Exist" is a quiet,
moving song, though its lyrics still
convey the same embittered tone
that everyone was tired of by the
time Alanis dropped her third sin
gle. On "Try to Take Your Time,"
Andreone does what the title

encourages, and the results are
much improved. On this track,
perhaps the most original tune on
the album, Andreone sets a jazzy
mood and manages some cool
Marvin Gaye-esque solos to offset
the high-tension songs.
Andreone stays calm on "Pri
vate Affair" and "Lamentation,"
which are haunting songs that do
well to round out the album,
despite its shortcomings.
Andreone could have promise if
she would break away from the
typical iterations of short musical
verses in each song and work on
more complex song structures. But
until she does that, she'll remain
just another singer spouting bit
terness any way she can.
