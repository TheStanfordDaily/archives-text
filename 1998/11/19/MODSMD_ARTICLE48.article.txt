# Robyn Hitchcock
## 'Storefront Hitchcock’ 
### 
Nowadays it seems hard to find a movie that
lasts in the spotlight as long as its soundtrack
does. At least that means the soundtrack is
worth listening to. With "Storefront Hitchcock" —
the name of both the film and the soundtrack —
people who find the music worth listening to should
also find the movie worth watching. The Jonathan
Demme concert film features Robyn Hitchcock, a
British musician wh"> has been making a name for
himself since the early '80s with the band Soft Boys
and in his succes ful solo career.
Some of the tunes on the CD (not to be confused
with the double vinyl-only LP also of the same name)
are odd, some are new, but all of them are live and
worth listening to. The performances are without
drums or percussion and have an "unplugged" feel.
On certain tracks, a violin or harmonica joins the gui
tars in songs that truly defy categorization.
The melodic and instrumental aspects of the songs
may not blow you away, though there is a nice guitar
solo on "I'm Only You," and "Let's Go Thundering" is
catchy. But what stands out are the sometimes witty
or poetic lyrics, often quirky to They-Might-Be-
Giants-esque proportions.
On "Glass Hotel," for example, Hitchcock sings,
"Well the telephone was ringing / in a corridor of
blue / A geranium came out of it / Reminded me of
you." It's also got to be impressive when a musician

can write a song called "The Yip! Song" in which he
yips rapidly for the first 15 seconds, make virtually no
sense throughout the whole thing, and gets away with
it stylishly. The lyrics on that track jump from "Yip!"
to "Draw a window on his skin" to "Coma high, coma
low / blood is precious, yes or no?" to "Down I spiral,
down I spin / forces sweetheart, I'm your twin now."
Even though songs like this one have a basic idea or at
least mood, it's often hard to come away with some
sort of emotional reaction to them.
The randomness sometimes sounds too self-con
scious, as if Hitchcock is putting in funky things only
for the sake of being eccentric.
Some of the highlights of the album are actually
spoken introductions, stories or philosophical mus
ings. These segments are unlisted and it's kind of cool
that the track listings on the CD jacket start with two,
end with 20 and skip a whole bunch of numbers in
between. The unlisted track one starts out with a few
chords before Hitchcock interrupts with, "Hi, is my
hair all right?" Track five is his rant on believing
"firmly in God in terms of spirituality" but stating
that "religion is perilously close to pornography."
Hitchcock is ultimately original and has a lot to say.
The problem is sometimes you have no idea what he's
saying. But whatever it is, it is still worth listening to.
