## 'Mutations' 
### 
In the past, Beck has complained about the media's habit
of mislabeling everything he does as "ironic." You see,
when Beck break dances, he's not mocking the '80s, he's
really, sincerely break dancing. If anyone can't accept this
("C'mon, he sampled a braying donkey!"), "Mutations"
should convince them. Take these simple, genuine lyrics from
"Nobody's Fault But My Own": "Some love holds, some gets
used 1... I never knew / It could be so sweet." This is no
"Where It's At."
"Mutations" as a whole is a departure from the Dust
Brothers' wall of samples on "Odelay." Beck manages his
genre-bending here the old-fashioned way, by absorbing
musical influences into his playing and singing. That said,
"Mutations" blends as many genres as anything Beck has done
before, from bossa nova on "Tropicalia" to honky tonk on
"Bottle of Blues.""Mutations" is a reminder of an earlier time
in pop music, when the Beatles could play a show tune and a
lullaby on "The White Album," Bob Dylan could sponta
neously decide to be a country singer, and David Bowie could
record using a different style for every song. "Mutations"
refuses to confine itself to one sound.
The best songs, however, and the ones that feel most natur
al coming from Beck, are still the spacy folk-pop tracks like
"Nobody's Fault But My Own," "We Live Again" and "Dead
Melodies." These remind you of the Beck who wrote "Pay No
Mind," singing songs about broken hearts, dead ends and
regret.
v Mutations" also has an added surprise: Not only is Beck
one of the best songwriters of our generation, he can sing too.
He can even hit high notes. On "Static," he actually harmo
nizes with himself. Okay, so he'll probably never be that good
of a singer, but like Dylan, Beck draws you in just by trying.
Recorded in just two weeks under the production of Nigel
Godrich ("OK Computer"), "Mutations" is a more natural
and mature album than "Odelay." I'm sure many people will
like "Odelay" better, but it's hard to really compare the two in
that way. Each tries for totally different things, and both suc
ceed.
There's a line in "Sing it Again" on "Mutations": "The dust
clouds blow / Nobody's home." I realize there's no way Beck
was actually referring to the Dust Brothers, but for me, this
line points to an inevitable fact about "Odelay." As fun and
dense and clever as it sounded, it was hard to hear any real
feeling through the web of noises. "Mutations," on the other
hand, is textured with real instruments, not samples — in fact,
David Campbell, Beck's father, arranged the orchestration on
two of the tracks. It's because of little human touches like this
that "Mutations" delivers more sincerity and emotion than
"Odelay."
