### Tyrone Prather Contributing writer 
When Rachel Robinson needed
a biographer to tell the story of her
late husband, baseball great Jackie
Robinson, she looked no further
than Stanford English Prof. Arnold

Rampersad.
The result was "Jackie Robin
son." a comprehensive biography of
the man who broke professional
baseball's color barrier in 1947 and
was an active player in the civil rights
movement after his retirement.
"Before [civil rights] happened.
Robinson was happening," Ram
persad said.
Rachel Robinson said she sought
out Rampersad for the biography
because she had long been an ad
mirer of his writing.
"There's a great integrity to his
work." she said. "I wanted this to be
done thoroughly, and I knew | Ram
persad) would create a total picture
of Jack."
From 1974 to 1983, Rampersad
taught English at Stanford. From
here, he moved on to Rutgers, then
to Columbia. Earlier this year, he
was teaching literature and African-
American studies at Princeton.

to teach at The Farm.

"l remember it fondly," he said.
"I have friends here. I like the Uni
versity, so when I had a chanee to

of the Robinson biography, which
was originally published last year as
one of several events marking the
50th anniversary of the integration
of baseball. The 1997 baseball sea

Rampersad became involved in
the anniversary project when
Robinson's widow Rachel contact

consider writing a biography of
Robinson, who died of diabetes in
1972 at age 53.
"She was dissatisfied with the bi

Rampersad wrote in the book's

said Rampersad. who co-wrote
"Days of Grace: A Memoir" with
Arthur Ashe in 1993. "Thisone tried
to take Robinson seriously from be

Rampersad's book presents a
complete portrait of Robinson's life,
from his early years growing up in

first pitch at the 1972 World Series
just a few days before his death.
