## 
### Tyrone Prather Contributing writer 
When Rachel Robinson needed
a biographer to tell the story of her
late husband, baseball great Jackie
Robinson, she looked no further
than Stanford English Prof. Arnold

Rampersad.
The result was "Jackie Robin
son." a comprehensive biography of
the man who broke professional
baseball's color barrier in 1947 and
was an active player in the civil rights
movement after his retirement.
"Before [civil rights] happened.
Robinson was happening," Ram
persad said.
Rachel Robinson said she sought
out Rampersad for the biography
because she had long been an ad
mirer of his writing.
"There's a great integrity to his
work." she said. "I wanted this to be
done thoroughly, and I knew | Ram
persad) would create a total picture
of Jack."
From 1974 to 1983, Rampersad
taught English at Stanford. From
here, he moved on to Rutgers, then
to Columbia. Earlier this year, he
was teaching literature and African-
American studies at Princeton.
This fall. Rampersad came back
to teach at The Farm.

"l remember it fondly," he said.
"I have friends here. I like the Uni
versity, so when I had a chanee to
come back 15 years later, it seemed
like the right thing to do."
Rampersad's return to Stanford
coincides with the October re-issue
of the Robinson biography, which
was originally published last year as
one of several events marking the
50th anniversary of the integration
of baseball. The 1997 baseball sea
son was dedicated to Robinson, and
his Brooklyn Dodger number 42
was permanently retired by all 2K
major league teams.
Rampersad became involved in
the anniversary project when
Robinson's widow Rachel contact
ed him in 1994 and asked if he would
consider writing a biography of
Robinson, who died of diabetes in
1972 at age 53.
"She was dissatisfied with the bi
ographies of Robinson that exist
ed," Rampersad said. "Generally,
thev concentrated on baseball, and

she felt there were many more di
mensions to him."
Rampersad wrote in the book's
acknowledgment that the biography
was an attempt to "broaden our un
derstanding of Robinson beyond
baseball."
"I think a lot of books on athletes
concentrate simply on the athletics."
said Rampersad. who co-wrote
"Days of Grace: A Memoir" with
Arthur Ashe in 1993. "Thisone tried
to take Robinson seriously from be
ginning to end. I tried to cover it all."
Rampersad's book presents a
complete portrait of Robinson's life,
from his early years growing up in
Pasadena. Calif., to his ceremonial
first pitch at the 1972 World Series
just a few days before his death.
In between, Rampersad details
Robinson's four-letter sports career
in track, baseball, basketball and
football at UCLA, his years playing
in the Negro Leagues and his his

toric pact in 1947 with Dodgers gen
eral manager Branch Rickey that
forever changed baseball and Amer
ica.
Rampersad tells the complex
story of how Robinson fought segre
gation, open hostility from opposing
players and resistance from his own
teammates to lead the Dodgers to
six National League pennants and a
world title before he retired in 1956.
At his induction ceremony into the
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962,
Robinson remarked that he "gave
baseball all I had for 10 years and
baseball has given me everything
I've got today."
Rampersad devotes a large por
tion of the book to Robinson's post
baseball life as a businessman, fami
ly man and influential civil rights
spokesman. Rampersad said that ac
cess to private letters and materials
given to him by Rachel Robinson of
fered a glimpse of Robinson not
often seen by the public.
"You see a side of him that peo
ple don't generally talk about â€” a
softer, more vulnerable, more pri
vate side," Rampersad said. "You
see his affection for her and his fam
ily, his determination to succeed."
The book also discusses Robin
son's more controversial political in
volvement during the 19605, includ

ing his associations with Malcolm X,
the Black Power movement,
Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwa
ter.
Rampersad said it was important
to resist the temptation to idealize
Robinson's life in order to present
the most complete story.
"I think there's a tendency to be
come reverential because he
achieved so much against so many
odds, and to construct a portrait that
contains no warts," Rampersad said.
"I'm totally opposed to that. The
only way to get a truly human picture
is by looking at the good and the bad
and the in-between."
Rampersad's works also include
anthologies of Langston Hughes,
Riehard Wright and W.E.B. Du
Bois. Rampersad said that the
Robinson biography, which took
about half as long to complete as his
other books, offers a different kind
of historical relevance.
"We often don't think of Robin
son as 'major' in the same way as we
think of those others because he was
an athlete," he said. "But when you
consider the impact of what he did
on the culture as a whole, then he is,
to me, very important."
Rachel Robinson said she was
"very happy" with Rampersad's bi
ography and considers it a compan
ion piece to her book, "Jackie
Robinson: An Intimate Portrait," a
collection of over 300 black-and
white photographs.
