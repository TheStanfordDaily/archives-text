# Alanis Morissette
## 'Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie' 
### 
The 18 months between Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill" and the newly released, eagerly-anticipated
"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" might as well have been 10 years.
On this album, for the most part, "Pill" 's one-line rages are gone. So are songs about other people. Gone
are packaged love-lines and belted words like "justice," "peace-sign," and "Are you thinking of me when you
fuck her?"
Don't expect "Pill" 's instantly recognizable emotion. An 18-month hiatus, a pilgrimage to India and inten
sive training for three triathlons has yielded bold, reflective, personal lyrics that can't be summarized in sin
gel words. Of course, this is still an Alanis Morissette album and the feelings are still there. But on most of the
songs they no longer are written in 24-font size.
Instead, the lyrics of "Junkie" are reflective and intimate poetry, sung of her parents, her pressure and, of
course, her (ex-) lovers. And a few songs, such as "Congratulations," "It Would Not Come" and "So Pure"
return to "Pill" 's beautiful simplicity. But although Morissette has widespread trust and an explosive stage
presence, the young mainstream that made "Pill" multi-platinum might want something more on the surface
to blast after school or to scream at concerts. This is not that kind of record.
Musically, "Junkie" doesn't have "Pill" 's back-to-back hits (although few albums do). To fit the lyrics'
catharses, words are often pushed and stretched too much and for too long, as in "Sympathetic Character," the
anomaly "Unsent," and"I Was Hoping." With 17 tracks, "Junkie" could stand jettisoning a few.
A sweetly painful "Front Row" replete with biting voice-over is excellent. The same holds true when Alanis'
voice is at the fore, as in "Thank You," — the album's single and controversial video. As hoped, bombastic har
monica returns in "Unsent," but the song disappoints. Further, Morissette's experiment in new woodwinds
doesn't work in "That I Would Be Good's" breathy flute-playing.
"Joining You" is especially passionate and powerful. Sung to an old friend considering suicide, it condemns
our habit of outwardly judging and instantly defining. "So Pure" is just that. The lyrics are wiser and more
cognizant than "Pill" 's "Head Over Feet." But the new song still soars with "Head Over Feet'"s nervous, "I can't
believe this is real" feelings of mutual attraction.
Over the past 18 months, Alanis Morissette grew up and gained the confidence to write every song on her
album about her own personal life. The intimate revelations worked on "Pill" when the feelings and stories
were obvious. They boiled over into tight-fisted vindication for all the wrongs the listener recalled. But the
emotions on "Junkie" are vague now and require a greater effort to underatand. By re-reading the lyrics, pray
ing for faith and raising the volume level to where you had it in 1995, though, the passion can still return.
