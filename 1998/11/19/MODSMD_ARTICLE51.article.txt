Riding on a crowded New York subway, the sole covfcrover her
bare breasts is her serpentine, almost-dreadlocktd brown .
hair; the lone cloak to her midsection a faint computer-gen
erated blur. She weaves among the passengers. Their outstretched |
hands softly touch her naked body. Looking upward, she passion- t
ately extols: "Thank you India / Thank you terror / Thank you disil
lusionment." ir-'y <_
Thus is the risqm? video for Alanis Morissette's "Thank You," the
single off her new CD, "Supposed Former Information Junlde,TTHe
CD was released on Nov. 3 and the video has been a MTV regular
ever since. Although talk of Morissette's nudity has bti#n absent
from the mainstream press, it was the number one topic among
many of her fans interviewed Wednesday on their impressions of ttie
artist's much-awaited follow to her four Grammy-winning 1995 CP, 4
"Jagged Little Pill."
Some say Morissette's nudity is a confirmation of the singer's |
message that one should not mask reality or true feelings, no matter
how powerful or unconventional — a theme evident in NfOfissette's
in-your-face emotional purges of lies, hurt, deception and heart
break.
But others who used to found Morissette's message inspiring and
empowering now see the nudity as a cheap marketing ploy geared to
increase sales and renew attention after an 18-month hiatus from
the music scene.
"I like her a lot more than mainstream artists," sai|| Camilla
Thompson, 24, trying on a pair of silver and aqua earritifcal: Palo
Alto's Tibetan Design. "But I'm not into her video. She fife* Mat to
promote herself. She has money. It's not like she has to
promote herself. I'd like to see women artists do somethinp>iii than
take off their clothes," Thompson said.
But Kate Zayko, who at 18 fits better into Morissette's

ahd high-school fan range, disagrees. "She's just kind of making a
|ftatemfcnt that she's not wearing anything," the East Greenwich, R. I.
native said. 'It's just her. She doesn't have her hair made up, she
'doesn't jhavfc on any make-up, she doesn't have on any clothes. It's
just her VQs£e," Kate said.
Tho&gh Ihe neither has seen the video nor is a Morissette fan,
Kate's mother disagreed. "I wouldn't encourage my kids to watch a
female walling around naked," Mrs. Zayko said. "1 find it contradic
tory to her message and demeaning."
Qutiin Booney, 17, who says that although many of Morissette's
Iyrics.jBt inlo her own life, agrees with her friend's mom that the
nudity gocijtoo far. "If she wanted to portray the image of not going
along with Everything, there are different ways to do it,"the East
Greenwich High School senior said during a break from college
%l|itio4 "She didn't have to be naked in the video."
The videl's nudity is actually just one place where the 24-year old
linger fofpthout clothes. The CD itself is also a picture of an

massive mane and her shadowed behind is snuggled next to an "E"

Lucinda Romain, 17, who has worked since she was 14, said that
the new tjtejUm treads a middle ground. "Anyone who writes poetry
is iegit»jSe said, sipping on a cappuccino at the Palo Alto
Starbucjfjjyne of her two jobs. "She's sincere, though a little bit
commejjjjftzed."

at a cottjPjiop in the Stanford Shopping Center, Dermon shrugged.
"All ourgul friends like it," she said.
