## Free Sexx Ain't nothing but a G thing 
### Roxy Sass 
Of you feel you've looked everywhere for the key
to foaming, frenzied sex, you may have missed a
spot: the g-spot. Discovered in the 1980s by Dr.
Ernst Grafenberg, the g-spot has been the object of
both praise and skepticism ever since. But even with
all the talk, few people have the lowdown on this
mysterious female feature. That's where Miss Sass
comes in.
First of all, let's define what we're dealing with
here. The g-spot, or "urethral sponge" for those of
you that want to snazz up your vocab, is actually a
group of glands and tissue that surround a woman's
urethra. Shaped like a kidney bean, it ranges from
the size of a dime to a half dollar and sits about two
inches inside the vagina.
To find the g-spot, have your lady friend lay down
on her back, knees bent and feet flat on the bed.
Insert a finger into her vagina and curl it upward,
like you're beckoning to a sexy someone across the
room. Because it's surrounded by a pad of tissue,
you can push a little harder than usual. Here's the
fun part: When you hit the right spot, it will swell
and become firm. In fact, its tissue is a lot like the
erectile tissue in a penis. Talk about instant gratifi
cation.
At this point, your lady is going to do one of three
things: yawn with boredom, scowl and gnash her
teeth or buck and squeal gleefully. If she happens to
do either of the first two, kiss her sweetly, remove
your hand and move on. Every woman has a g-spot,
but not all women will like to have it doted on.
If she's of the third ilk, however, you've hit the
sexual bullseye. Now you can get down to business,
with a few minor preparations. Grab a bottle of
water-based lube, cut your nails and take off those
rings. Talons like Elvira's or jewelry like Liberace's
do not a fun time make. You may also want to put a
towel down if you're not into water sports, since a
liquid ejaculate sometimes accompanies g-spot
stimulation. Finally, you're set.
Begin by warming up with a little foreplay. The g
spot is a sensitive little bugger* and you're lady may
lie a smidge irritated if you jump the gun. Think of
it this way: If sex is a feast, you'll want to have appe
tizers and a salad before you get to this dish. So do
whatever until a little penetration starts to sound
nice. Only then should you hit the spot.
For novices, the most basic type of g-spot stimu
lation is the same motion you used to find the spot
in the first place. Try moving thi fingers in subtle lit
tle circles, or point them upwards and rock them
back and forth. These movements get at the spot
directly, so watch for wincing.
Once you've mastered that, you can try moving
your whole fingers in even circles all around the
vagina. Push them in as far as is comfortable for the
recipient, and try to keep a consistent, firm pressure
along each finger. Just a tad more pressure at 12 o'
clock (towards her belly) will be much appreciated,
as long as you don't break the steady rotational
rhythm.
After a few minutes of this your fingers may be
cramping, but you certainly won't want to disap
point, What to do, you think? Someone else pon
dered that same question and the g-spot vibrator
was born. Easily found at your local Sex emporium,
it gets its name from its uniquely functional
shape — suspiciously similar to Gonzo's nose. The

. If I . J
length (longer than your a\rwage finger) and the
turn at the end enable its user Id get at those hard
to-reach crannies. The sensation will be mote
intense, though, so be sure to take advantage of the
variable speed (a common option);and use light
pressure rather than vigorous thrusting ttfid poking.
Of course, there are also ways to get both partners
in on the action while getting at the gspot. The
renowned "doggy style" position Will tub a lady
right, as will having her lie on her back and point
her legs towards the sky. Meanwhile, the gent|eman
will find the view pleasant andlhe actmtyiinost
diverting. / jglß
And guys who slobber at the thought of even
more attention, listen up. There is. actually a male
equivalent to the g-spot: the prostate gland. The
prostate is located between the anallcanal and the
penis, and feels like a little dome. It grows in size
throughout the life of the male, so you'll have an
easier time finding it on a grad student than a frosh.
Stimulate that sucker and some say you'll go up and
never come down. You do, however, have to take a
rather devious route to get at it, given that it's
internal.
Did you guess? To stimulate the prostate, insert
one or two well lubricated (we're talkin' sloppy J fin
gers several inches into the anus and massage
towards the penis and scrotum. Juat as with the
female g-spot, work up to this activity. Willy-nilly
stimulation of the prostate can lead to (gasp!) a
spontaneous and rather uncomfortable orgasm. Go
slow and use your other hand on his external
niceties.: '
Once orgasm is worked up to, you'll find it's a dif
ferent sensation than a purely penile orgasm. Also,
theoretically, the ejaculate will be more "watery"
since the prostate provides the lubricant (while the
bails make the actual sperm). This may interest y|u
if you prefer the taste of 4 single latte to a double
espresso.
Having read thus for, you're practically an experts
on g-spot exploration. Miss Sass wants to say just 4
few requisite words to keep her kids safe arid happy!
Body fluids carry nasty things these days, and a cut
on your hand will roll out the red carpet for infec
tion. You can get rubber gloves (often free) at a Jot
of locations, and use plenty of lubricant so that
nothing tears them once they're on.
That said, have fun with the g-spot and give it|
time. It may not lead to a bucking frenzy at first and |
sometimes it may not ever get there at all. But, forjj
some people, it's believed to be the key to multiple 1
orgasms. One of those people could be you. ||
