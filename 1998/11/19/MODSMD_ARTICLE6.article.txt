# Suburban legends
## Murder, math and a lady named Sweet 
### Brian Lee Senior staff writer 
It's late at night and the Quad is
the last place you want to be. The
echo of your footsteps in the shad
owy corridors only reminds you that
you're alone. You recall that story
your resident assistant told you
about a murder in Memorial Church
and you walk a little faster. You tell
yourself, "It's just a story."
From alligators in the sewer to
the infamous "Good Times" com
puter virus, urban legends have
dominated contemporary Ameri
can folklore.
One might think that Stanford, a
school that some feel has few tradi
tions, might not have its own collec
tion of folklore. But, chances are
that even incoming freshmen have
heard at least one such tale.
"I heard a few really early on in
freshman year," said recent gradu
ate Althea Davis. "It seemed like
thev fed off of all the anxieties and

fears of the students here. Whether
or not they'd be popular or do well
and things like that."
Stanford's earliest urban legend
dates back to before the University
was established. According to the
story. Leland and Jane Stanford cre
ated the University only after their
offer to make a bequest to Harvard
had been rejected by then-universi
ty president Charles Eliot. While the
story was easily refuted, it demon
strated the dynamic by which this
form of contemporary mythology
has made use of modern technology.
"It kept me busy all summer be
cause it was being e-mailed so wide
ly," said University archivist Maggie
Kimball. "It was that someone put it
on the Internet that was the biggest
problem."
Kimball, who has been Stan
ford's archivist since 1990, is the
school's authority on University his
torv. Students, alumni and re
searchers alike come to her with
questions concerning all manner of
rumor and obscure fact, which has
led many to say that she enjoys the
most interesting job at Stanford.
"We have such a wonderful col
lection here," Kimball said. "It's also
great that people ask such intriguing
questions. People are always inter
ested in what has happened here on
campus."
One urban legend that has been
posed to Kimball repeatedly in
volves the history of Hoover Tower.
According to rumor, in the 19405, a
Stanford woman, distraught that she
did not receive a bid to her sorority
of choice, leapt to her death from the
observation deck of the tower,
prompting the University to ban
sororities from campus.
While there has been a suicide at
Hoover Tower, it was almost 20
years later and did not involve the
Greek system. Amazingly, even
tower staff members were uncertain
about the veracity of the sorority sui
cide story. Kelly 1 lauge. Class of '91
and building manager at the tower,
heard similar accounts during her
own undergraduate years.
A similarly macabre urban leg
end takes the form of a traditional
ghost story. Supposedly, the an
guished screams can be heard in
near Memorial Church. As the story
has it, the spirit is that of a young
woman who was slain in the church.
Unfortunately, part of the legend
is verifiable. In 1974, the young wife
of a Stanford sophomore was indeed
murdered in the church, a crime that
remains unsolved.
Not all campus folklore is so mor
bid. Stanford's collection of urban
legends wouldn't be complete with
out a few tales chronicling amazing
feats of academic achievement.
One story which has gained na
tionwide fame describes a student,
who upon stumbling into statistics
class late one day, solves two prob
lems posted on the blackboard, as
suming that they were homework.

Only after he submits the solutions
does he learn that the professor had
posted the problems as examples of
unsolvable statistics problems.
Although the story sounds suspi
ciously like the plot of the recent
Matt Damon blockbuster "Good
Will Hunting," it's actually one of
the few urban legends that isn't real
ly a legend at all. As a graduate stu
dent at UC-Berkeley, George
Dantzig, now a Stanford professor
emeritus of computer science,
solved two such problems without
knowing what they were. The story
is recounted in the September 1986
College Mathematics Journal.
Also characteristic of Stanford
culture are urban legends involving
technology. One asserts that the
Unix server "elaine" in Sweet Mali
was mischievously named after Le
land Stanford Sr.'s mistress.
Ouick to correct that particular
notion is Sweet I fall computer con
sultant Fred Miclat. who states that

the machines are named after "Mr.
Sweet's daughter."
He too. however appears to be
misled. Indeed Elaine Sweet was
certainly her father's daughter, but it
was actually Ms. Sweet herself that
endowed Sweet Hall. Wishing to do
nate to Stanford's first fund drive in
the 1930s but unable to afford much.
Elaine Sweet gave one dollar. When
she died in the mid-1980s she left the
University her entire estate, which
had by then grown to $5.5 million.
Even the most dogged research
may not uncover the truth behind
some of the more outlandish tales.
Kimball could neither refute nor
confirm the story that the black
squirrels on campus were indeed, as
legend has it.the product of labora
tory experimentation. When asked
about the tale, she burst out into
laughter.
"Well. I certainly haven't heard
that particular story before," she
said. "That's definitely a good one."
