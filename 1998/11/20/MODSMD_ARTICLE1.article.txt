### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
UCSF-Stanford Health Care
will have to absorb nearly $1 mil
lion not paid by Brown & Toland
Medical Group, which is faced
with a $4.5 million deficit.
The announcement, dated ear
lier this month, was made by Bruce
Wintroub. chief medical officer for
USHC.
Brown & Toland is San Francis
co's largest for-profit medical
group. Its subsidiary. Brown &
Toland Physician Services Organi
zation has been responsible for.
among others, UCSF Health
Care's paperwork since l c )%. Be
ginning next January, it will be re
sponsible for serving USHC as a
whole.
"The decision to absorb the dif
ference was made so that we can
continue to offer the best possible
quality of care." said Daniel
Berman, director of news services
for USHC.
Brown & Toland Physician Ser
vices Organization's deficit was
caused in large part by other un
successful revenue-generating
ventures, poor investments being
one example. Coupled with an ex
pansion of services, it was left with
a $4.5 million shortfall last fiscal
year.
The organization turned to its
parent company. Brown & Toland
Medical Group. Its board of direc
tors decided that it would be in its
best interest to make up the differ
ence. according to Cecilia Montal
vo, vice president of Brown &
Toland PSO.
The deficit was split among all
groups and doctors that Brown &
Toland provides services for.
More specifically, part of
Brown & Poland's responsibilities
includes reimbursing doctors for
services rendered. For each pay
ment made, a certain sum of
money is withheld for "unforeseen
additional expenditures." Usually,
at the end of each fiscal year. most.
if not all, of the withheld monies are
reimbursed.
"Most doctors assume that the
withheld portion of their income
will be returned, and it usually is,"
Montalvo said.
Because of the shortfall this year,
a portion of each group's reim
bursement was not returned. In the
case of USHC, which accounts for
20 percent of Brown & Toland's ser
vices, nearly $1 million was kept.
"Each group will probably not be
affected in a substantial way by the
deficit, but it is still an unfortunate.

rare occurrence," Montalvo said.
According to Berman, USHC
decided to make up the difference
so that individual doctors within the
organization would not be affected
by the shortfall.
As a larger organization, USHC',
in Berman's opinion, will not be se
riously affected.
"The $1 million will come from
some part of the [$1.5 billion] bud
get for next year and should not
cause any problems that we can see
at this time," he said.
Some, however, aren't so sure
about what is to come.
"It's wild that some people get
coverage for bad investments and
others don't," said Betsy Imholz in

the San Francisco Chronicle yester
day. She follows health care for the
San Francisco-based Consumer's
Union.
"One wonders where that
money comes from, what patient
care or other improvements in
health services won't get funded,"
she said.
Berman, on the other hand, said
that the funds used will not compro
mise patient care in any foreseeable
way.
Montalvo cites the reason for the
pairing of Brown & Toland and
UCSF in the first place to be to cre
ate one medical group with a large
patient base and the medical depth
of one of the world's top research

hospitals.
Even after the merger of UCSF
and Stanford in January of last year,
Brown & Toland continued to pro
vide its services to the former UCSF
division.
The decision to include Stanford
next year was, in Montalvo's opin
ion, a logical next step. It will then
comprise nearly 40 percent of
Brown & Toland's service group.
"It was a natural consequence to
offer services to the combined
UCSF-Stanford group," she said.
"We hope to provide the best possi
ble level of service."
Brown & Toland PSO, according
to Montalvo, is expected to balance
its budget for the next fiscal year.
