JENIN, West Bank (AP) — After nearly
two years of U.S. prodding and bitter disputes
with the Palestinians, the Israeli government
gave the final go-ahead Thursday to with
drawing trcwps from a chunk of the West
Bank the size of Chicago.
The Cabinet narrowly approved the deci
sion after acrimonious debate. It marked a
point of nt) return for Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu, who since taking office in
May 19% had zigzagged on the peace process
and now faces the loss of support of key allies.
In anticipation of winning full or partial
control of an additional 9.1 percent of the
West Bank, the Palestinian Authority staged a
jubilant independence day parade in the farm
ing town of Jenin in the northern West Bank

on Thursday. Most of the land to he handed
over is near Jenin.
Two percent, or 44 square miles, of the
West Bank land in the agreement approved
Thursday is being transferred from sole Israeli
control to joint jurisdiction. In addition, 7.1
percent, or 161) square miles, of the land in the
deal moves from joint jurisdiction to sole
Palestinian control.
The Palestinians already have full control
of 3 percent of the West Bank and joint juris
diction over another 24 percent.
Israel's Cabinet barely approved the first
stage of the peace accord under which Israel is
to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank by
the end of January, in exchange for a Pales
tinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
