# Starr takes the witness stand
## Democrats say he "crossed the line into obsession"

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a blend of
constitutional drama and partisan struggle,
Kenneth Starr on Thursday laid out the evi
dence against President Clinton that trig
gered the third presidential impeachment
inquiry in history. Democrats said the inde
pendent counsel had "crossed the line into
obsession."
Clinton engaged in a "scheme to con
ceal" his relationship with Monica Lewin
sky, Starr told members of the House Judi
ciary Committee and a nationwide televi
sion audience. The president was at the
heart of a "pattern of obstruction" that was
inconsistent with his duty, he added.
Starr, himself the target of ceaseless

attacks from Clinton's defenders, spoke
calmly and methodically — but unambigu
ously — as he offered his first public
accounting of his investigation into the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and several other matters.
"He testified that he could not recall
being alone with Ms. Lewinsky. That was
untrue," Starr said of the president. "He
testified that he could not recall ever being
in the Oval Office hallway with Ms. Lewin
sky, except perhaps when she was deliver
ing pizza. That was untrue," he added.
Four more times, on matters relating to
Clinton's utterances relating to the former
White House intern, Starr firmly repeated.

"That was untrue."
Clinton was in Asia beginning a five-day
visit. A battery of the president's lawyers
were present in the committee room, await
ing their turn to question Starr.
Before he could begin his two-hour
statement. Democrats sought to expand the
30 minutes that Clinton's lawyers were
allotted to question him. Republicans voted
the proposal down on a party-line vote.
Still, Starr fielded a blistering attack
from Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the
senior Democrat on the committee.
"1 and many others believe that Mr.
Starr has crossed the line into obsession,"
he said.
