Living responsibly may
be complicated, but it's
as important as ever

I ONCE PICKED up a bathmat, some
lunch and mailed a letter all on my one
stop trip to a massive Super K-Mart in
Fresno, Calif. I appreciated the conve
nience, but I felt guilty about it.
When 1 buy anything these days, I feel
like I am supporting the collective Big Busi
ness that has diligently smothered mom
and-pop stores to stuff more money into the
pockets of shrewd businessmen. When I
read the corporate label on my pop can, I
am reminded of its ties to television pro
gramming, congressional bills and arts
funding. It worries me that more people
don't view their abilities to recognize prod
uct logos as evidence that we are losing
access to objective information and chang
ing our conceptions of what is valuable.
These days, corporations do more to
shape the values of youth than teachers do.
We justify this role by praising them for
their donations. That money, we tell our
selves, could not have been raised any other
way. However, we rarely question why cor
porations choose to "support" schools by
drafting agreements to sell Pizza Hut pizza
at reduced prices or by donating Fischer
televisions with the stipulation that speci
fied minutes are devoted to commercials.
And it's not that the monopoly on infor
mation is limited to naive children. Ted
Turner may be generous with his money,
but he earned his billions by controlling the
vast majority of the news media in this coun
try. It is clearly no coincidence that the news
is fixated on slamming nations which threat
en the United States' commercial interests.
One result is that we are confident we know
all about Tibet, a territory firmly controlled
by a powerful competitor, but we care little
about Nigeria, a nation with a government
willing to sell us oil. Another is that we rec
ognize the power of wealth, and seek work
with consulting firms that do little else than
perpetuate an irresponsible pursuit of gain.

I'm well aware that my effort to avoid
spending money at any enterprise having to
do with Shell Oil, Orchard Hardware or
The New York Times has done little to
change those companies' profit margins.
But it takes more effort to find a reason not
to take a stand than to actually take one. If
it's pretty clear something bad is going on,
and there's a way to change it, the means to
change it is really no sacrifice. By making
conscious votes with our money, we are
recognizing the greater picture. 1, at least,
feel a little better when I do that.
I know it seems we've almost reached
the point where everything we buy has a
negative social or environmental conse
quence. It's gotten difficult to live without
feeling guilty about something. My person
al dilemma is with sport-utility vehicles.
Despite the fact that they're subject to
lower emissions and fuel-efficiency stan
dards than passenger vehicles, I still think
SUVs would be really handy for driving to
the mountains. See, 1 get tired with political
correctness and social responsibility too.
I recently gave a friend of mine an
excuse when he encouraged me to take a
look at a little-known government program
down in Georgia called the School of the
Americas. It's a military school that claims
the honor of calling former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet an alumnus. I told my
friend that I couldn't challenge the exis
tence of the program because 1 wasn't an
expert. I didn't know every side in the con
troversy, I said. Just because I read the arti
cles and the leaflets didn t mean I could
choose a side in the issue.
I was wrong. Even if 1 never picket out
side the gates of the SO A, by ignoring the
issue I wasted what information 1 did know.
Speaking without knowledge and mak
ing false accusations is a pitfall in personal
relationships as well as in foreign policy.
Even worse, however, is believing we
should not challenge what is around us
because we are not experts. The greatest
danger is to assume we are powerless to
change things because there is too much to
know and we know too little of it.
