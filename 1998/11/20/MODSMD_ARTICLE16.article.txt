## Never tear us apart: Big Game '98 
### 
OH, JULIA. After
years of Mr. Sis
man's class and
getting kicked out of cof
fee houses when they
locked up at night, it's
come to this?
Competitive journalist

that I am, I've taken to cruising Berkeley's
Daily C'alifornian online this quarter. Their
Wednesday columnist holds special interest
for me; opinions writer Julia Herriges is a
fellow alumna of Laguna Hills High School.
Far be it for me to miss any public refer
ences to the wasteland that is Orange Coun
ty — I love reading what she has to say
about both her life across the Bay and that
twisted place we both call home.
I can endure her occasional "Go Bears!"
and references to "Stanfurd," but this
week's column hit me where it hurts. Quoth
Jules in reference to Big Game 19%, "A
friend of mine at Stanfurd was a friend of
the Tree and good-humored e-mails sent by
a few of us at Berkeley didn't go over too
well, needless to say [note: why say it,
then?]." She continues, "For a group of sup
posedly intelligent people, students who
wear red don't seem to grasp the elemen
tary concept [of] size The lesson is sim
ply this: What goes around comes around,
and if it's bigger than you it comes around
harder. A smart-ass tree just doesn't have a
chance against a few thousand proudly
embittered Californians."
The "good-natured" e-mails she men
tions made specific and triumphant refer
ence to Chris Cary's pummeling at the end

of the game.
"You may have beat the football team,
but we beat the Tree," the e-mails read.
One would expect me to miss the humor
in this, I think; I knew only that Chris had
needed medical attention, and that "Kal"
fans had gone beyond shredding his cos
tume and had attempted to rearrange his
limbs. My public school chum will have to
forgive me for killing her buzz.
Julia's column came hard on the heels of
the Nov. IS headline in our paper, "New
policies designed to avoid Big Mayhem."
which outlined the draconian rules of con
duct for mascots and fans. 1 find it pitiful
that the Stanford Police Department is
obliged to discuss a friggin' football game in
terms of "flashpoints." Saturday is begin
ning to sound more like an UNPROFOR
mission than friendly rivalry.
I understand the growing concern for
public safety; it's well-warranted, as Big
Game horror stories seem to get uglier and
uglier every year. I'm ashamed, however, of
the fact that martial law is apparently the
most appropriate approach to Stanford-Kal
events. Our mascot is to be restricted to a
"fly zone" and banned from the LSJUMB's
halftime show tomorrow? God bless him if
he gets jiggy on the Kal sidelines. He's The
Tree — he can lap-dance the Chancellor for
all I care.
Considering that Julia is a journalist (and
quite the liberal, I might add), I expected
her to attach more value to basic freedom of
expression.
"It's fun to be a Californian and I take
pride in it," she states.

It's fun to be a Stanford student, too. I
and everyone else should be able to "take
pride in it" without an armed escort — and
without fearing for her internal organs.
It probably would infuriate Kal fans to
see the Tree perform in the half-time show.
It will infuriate them even more if Stanford
keeps the Axe tomorrow (though I won't
lay any bets on that scenario — mama
didn't raise no fool). Should we lose Big
Game intentionally to avert the possibility
of enraging Berkeley and promoting vio
lence? Should we restrict "Kal sucks" to our
dry-erase boards in order to avoid con
frontation? Maybe we should cancel Gai
eties; after all, a lone Weenie in the audi
ence might have a can of whup-ass ready
and waiting for us.
What goes around does come around,
and Stanford and Kal students alike are suf
fering from the effects of a handful of fans
who pre-party a little too hard. The Police
Department, despite its efforts, can't resur
rect the friendly rivalry we've dragged
through the mud. It is our collective respon
sibility to make Big Game safe enough for
Oski and the Tree — and for everyone else.
I'll sass back at the Kal fans who taunt me in
Berkeley tomorrow — but I'm leaving my
whup-ass at home.
Christopher Matthew Henderson III: tell
the Chancellor I said hey.

umn. Makes you wonder how the other half
lives.
