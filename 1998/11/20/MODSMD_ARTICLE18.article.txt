New security system in
the works
In the Nov. 13 Daily, there appeared the
original letter to the editor on the subject of
collection security methods used in the
Green Library.
It is part of the libraries' fiduciary
responsibility to the University to be sure
that all library materials have been formal
ly charged out before they leave our build
ings.
Green Library staff does not assume that
individuals deliberately seek to remove
uncharged materials from the Library; how
ever, patrons leave Green 500,000 times
annually and some simply forget to stop at
the loan desk.
Readers entering Green Library do so
with the understanding that their briefcases,
backpacks, etc. will be inspected upon exit-

Theft detection systems were installed in
many of the smaller library units during the
1980s to serve collection security purposes.
Placing detection targets in the millions of
volumes in the Green Library will require
the expenditure of millions of dollars.
The Green Library portal monitors pro
vide services in addition to collection secu
rity; they facilitate entry of many visitors for
more than 50 hours each week and serve as
first-line sources of information about
library services and facilities during all
library hours. In a building as large and
complex as Green and with as many
patrons as it has, these are critical services
that will need to be provided even after
technology is applied to its collection secu
rity activities.
Library staff are actively investigating a
collection security system in development
which, unlike the types that are currently
available, will not only serve collection
security purposes but should also permit

streamlining of some currently staff-inten
sive circulation routines.
When fully implemented, moreover, this
system should provide an efficient means to
monitor collection inventory. The numer
ous functions of such new systems present
an attractive and more cost-effective
approach to the libraries' efforts than has
been the case to date.

Hospital acted cruelly in
Harris case
I am writing I response to an article
regarding Mr. Jonathan Harris published
on Nov. 4.
While reading the said article, it was
obvious to me that the writer, Marni Leff,

had never met Jonathan Harris and had
written a reproduction of what [David]
Scheuerman, the lawyer representing Stan
ford Hospitals, had said in his declaration of
"protection to the hospital."
It is unfortunate that a building or an
institution should draw more respect and
concern than a human being, and that a
lawyer representing the hospital has no
regard at all for what the patient and family
are going through.
Jonathan Harris passed away a week
ago. Thankfully, he died in his home sur
rounded by people who knew and respect
ed him.
Although it is true that Jonathan strug
gled with drug addiction, Scheuerman was
completely ignorant of who Jonathan was, a
courageous, sensitive, caring being who at
the same time struggled with life but
harmed no one but himself.
Perhaps if the people involved in "caring
fields" were somewhat aware of the seri

ousness of the nature of the illness of drug
addiction, many others suffering with this
illness could be treated as they deserve
without being criminalized for it and there
fore denied the necessary services to con
tinue with their recovery.
I believe Stanford Hospital needs to
upgrade the ethical level of its employees
and overall find ways to train administra
tors and care providers on issues such as the
meaning of human suffering and how to
better serve a population afflicted by addic
tion, a large population in the United
States.
As long as institutions continue to crimi
nalize the illness of addiction, people in
need of care will continue to fall deeper into
the illness or die without proper care.
I happen to know Jonothan and his fam
ily, to whom I send my deepest respect.
