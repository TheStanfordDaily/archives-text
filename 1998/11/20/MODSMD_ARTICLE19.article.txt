IN THE MOST shocking turn of nation
al events since the Germans bombed
Pearl Harbor, Stanford University offi
cials last night declared Stanford a Free
State and submitted their declaration of
independence to a flabbergasted President
Clinton.
When asked for the gist of the declara
tion during the ensuing press conference.
Ambassador William Perry responded. "It
is the leeling of the University community
as a whole, that the immoral and bureau
cratic modus operandi being sustained by
the United States government is no longer
conducive to nor compatible with our aca
demic endeavors."
President Clinton's first response to the
news was to initiate a surgical SEAL team
to extract his daughter and her Secret Scr
vice guard, apparently to eliminate the
threat of a hostage situation.
Kenneth Starr took no similar action
with his daughter. "Sounds pretty good,
really," he said. "Our country's awfully
f**ked up."
Stanford President Gerhard Casper
scoffed at Clinton's move, calling it "a pre

dictable and pointless maneuver."
"Clinton knows full well that the top
secret research we conduct here provides us
with ample tokens of terror. He funded it. 1
suspect his true motivation for his daugh
ter's removal was fear that she would want
to stay," Casper said.
Casper insisted, however, that terrorism
was not to be Stanford's primary diplomatic
tool. "The way 1 see it."he told reporters,
"you can't really fight a bunch of college
students. Humanity won't stand for it. Look
at Kent State and Tiananmen Square. We
don't anticipate military coercion but if it
should occur, we have plenty of nasty sur
prises hidden away in basements and labo
ratories, not to mention the awesome
destructive power of our long-dormant
Dish."
More likely than a military strike is eco
nomic embargo. Stanford is prepared for
this reaction. Diplomatic efforts with alum
nus and newly elected Gov. Gray Davis
have proven fruitful, as Davis has pledged
his lull support for the movement. "I will do
everything in my power, diplomatically and
otherwise, to see this young nation prosper.

If it comes to it, I'll invoke the National
Guard."
When asked if he had been informed
prior to the declaration of independence,
Davis responded with a smile, "Why do you
think I ran for governor?"
Even with California's support. Stanford
feels it imperative that they not be land
locked. ROTC General Ryan Shaper has
been working in coordination with national
guardsmen to formulate an offensive sweep
over the Stanford foothills and into Half
Moon Bay. "We shall advance with preci
sion and speed," he said. "Our troops will
summit the foothills and attack Half Moon
Bay from its flanks as well as head on, thus
placing any resistance in a merciless vise."
Stanford senior John Reynard applaud
ed Shaper's plans, saying, "Yeah, Half
Moon Bay's great. It's got nice head-high
point breaks year round. And Mavericks
has some of the gnarliest waves on record.
I'm pumped."
The alley Shaper hopes to clear will
eventually be used for faculty and alumni
housing. Stanford officials insist, however,
that emigration will be respected. "It's

important to remember that we are a
Utopia," said President Casper. "We aim to
be the most enlightened, the healthiest and
the most beautiful nation in the world. I
shall step down as President as soon as an
election can be coordinated. I was appoint
ed, you see."
Stanford's political philosophy is unsure
as of yet. Political Science Prof. Edward
Applegate informed reporters, "We are a
democracy; the rest is unclear. Political sci
ence and philosophy have been meeting
around the clock to formulate a constitu
tion. It is going well, but it would save time
if people only spoke to contribute rather
than to sound smart."
The revolution has caused severe reper
cussions nationwide. The Dow incurred a
record-breaking hit as investors frantically
tried to dump Silicon Valley stocks. "It's a
crushing blow to the industry," said
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. "A lot of great
talent comes out of Stanford, and now
they'll have it all to themselves. I'm consid
ering immigration."
The United States Olympic Committee
expressed a similar sentiment. "We're

screwed," said their spokesman. "We're
nothing without Stanford."
The Stanford student body is enthusias
tic. Fresh anthems fill the warm air and
there is already a contest to design the flag.
"We're really excited," said junior Sarah
Thomas. "The United States was really
keeping us from our potential. We're
psyched to make some cool new rules and
not make any of the mistakes that those
Harvard types did in Philadelphia. It would
suck if they closed our borders, but I don't
really leave campus anyway."
An anonymous source told this reporter
that the Admissions Office may have been
the secret spearhead of the nationalist
movement. With this move, Stanford forev
er removes itself from the pages of U.S.
News and World Report's yearly rankings.
When asked how the revolution was
expected to affect admissions. Dean Bun
nell. associate dean of admissions,
answered, "Applications will skyrocket."
