# Give 'em the Axe!
## Big Game festivities wrapping up in Stanford and Berkeley 
### Sally Williamson Contributing writer 
Already Stanford stu
dents have participated in
pranks, screamed in a rally
and watched Gaieties per
formers prance across the

stage, but there is still much more Big Game fun to
be had before the 12:30 p.m. kickoff tomorrow.
According to junior Ashish Vora, a three-year
veteran of Axe Committee, the countdown to Big
Game has sparked students' spirit.
"It's a tough year, football-wise, and the count
down is to focus school spirit," Vora said. Big

Game "is a whole other game out there. Records
don't matter."
The Axe Comm has been stationed in White
Plaza since Tuesday morning; each member is
working for at least six hours, for the hourly count
down until Big Game.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Mon
toya, Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo and foot
ball head coach Tyrone Willinghain all stopped by
the Axe Comm's countdown to blow the horn, ac
cording to Axe Comm chair Mike Ceballos. Will
inghain was also present at last night's Big Game
rally, which also featured the Stanford Mendicants
and the Stanford Band.
David Felman, Student Group Discounts man

ager for Stanford Student Enterprises, also testi
fied to school spirit in "Bus Back the Axe," the
project he is directing.
"Two years ago we had a much better season
and had 17 buses. This year we still have 17 buses,"
Felman said. "That says something about the spir
it of the students."
The buses for Big Game are meeting in the
Serra parking lot at 9:15 a.m. to take more than 800
students to the game.
Producer Steven Aronowitz said Gaieties, this
year entitled "Farmageddon, M has an important
influence on Stanford Big Game pride. "Gaieties is

the way that Stanford culture is
passed on," he said. "It shows you
what the important stories are of
being a Stanford student."
In addition to general student
spirit, this year, the senior class presi
dents have focused senior events sur
rounding Big Game including the se
nior bus to the game tomorrow and
Senior Gaieties, which took place
last night.
According to senior class presi
dents Erica Straus and Mina Bak, the
goal of Senior Gaieties, as well as the
senior bus tomorrow, is to build se
nior spirit and to unify the class. The
event included the best seats in the
house for seniors, as well as a pre-
Gaieties party in front of Memorial
Auditorium.
"As seniors, -since this is our last
time to experience Gaieties and Big
Game as undergraduates, we want to
allow as many seniors to experience
these and all of our other 'lasts' to
gether," Straus said.
"It's a lot more unifying that peo
ple are taking this opportunity to go
together," she said.
The Stanford Band is up to its
usual Big Game Week festivities, in
cluding playing rallies around cam
pus on Monday and Tuesday and at a
series of annual luncheons on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
The Band's trumpet section installed
Christmas lights reading "Beat Cal"
on the front of the Band Shak on
Monday night.
In past years the Big Game rival
ry also has been surrounded by an
other tradition: pranks. Every year
there are a number of pranks be
tween Stanford and Cal, which have
included the painting and decoration
of various monuments around both
campuses, blue-dyed mice released

at Gaieties and the Cal "C" being
broken in half to form an "S". Ac
cording to a senior who wished to re
main anonymous, pranks are
planned for tonight and tomorrow.
Other than the football game,
there are several other "Big" sports,
including the Big Splash water polo
game at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow at Dia
blo Valley College, as well as the Big
Freeze two-game hockey series.
Even the Stanford Daily gets in
volved in the rivalry with the Ink
Bowl, an annual flag football game
between the Daily and the Daily Cal
ifornian.
The Stanford Black Community
Services Center and the Berkeley
African American Student Develop
ment Office are co-hosting the first
Black Love at Big Game Celebra
tion from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow
at the C6sar Chavez Student Atrium
in Berkeley.
And what about those Stanford
students who don't hold Big Game
tickets? Some are trekking to Berke
ley to partake in pre- and post-game
fun but are taking over local bars to
watch the actual game. Some even
plan to sneak in at halftime.
One alternative idea to Big Game
is the Collective Student Action
Workshop, an event attended by
about 30 Bay Area college students.
Janelle Ishida, a member of Students
for Environmental Action at Stan
ford is attending the workshop to
learn more about organizing human
rights and social justice campaigns,
and "get basic skills to work on future
campaigns," she said.
But for those attending the game
and those who participated in this
week's events, the importance of Big
Game goes beyond countdowns, be
yond buses and beyond pranks. Ac
cording to Aronowitz, the rivalry is
"something bigger than yourself, big
ger than Stanford. You're part of this
history."
