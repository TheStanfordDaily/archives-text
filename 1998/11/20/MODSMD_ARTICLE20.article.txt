## Illinois downs Women 
### Molly Brizgys Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team lost its third straight game
last night as it fell to the University
of Illinois 76-58.
Stanford dropped its first two
games against No. 6 Duke and No.
18 Arkansas at the Nike Four in the
Fall tournament last weekend.
"I thought our team effort was
very good," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "We played very
hard, but we're having some major
execution problems on offense.
Whether it's what we're doing or
people not recognizing what we
need them to do out there, it's frus
trating and discouraging for the
people on the team."
The last time a Stanford (0-3)
team lost three in a row was during
the 1986-87 season. That team fin
ished 14-14 and was sixth in the Pa
cific 10 Conference.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 25 Illinois (1-0) 76,
Stanford (0-3)58.

After an awful first half where it
shot 29 percent from the field and
had 13 turnovers, the Cardinal
briefly came back, maintaining a
two-point lead for two minutes
early in the second half.
The No. 25 Fighting Illini (1-0)
would not be put down, however,
and began a 22-4 run with eight
minutes left to play that clinched
the game. Stanford scored only two
field goals in that eight-minute
span.
"It's very difficult — it's unac
ceptable" said junior guard Milena
Flores. "We don't lose here. We
need to make some changes so it
doesn't happen again."
While her team struggled, Flores
regained some of her own personal
confidence last night, finishing with
11 points and five assists. Flores' im
proved performance was greatly
needed after she went one for 23
last weekend from the field at the
Four in the Fall.
"I felt a lot more comfortable at
Maples," said Flores. "It's my com
fort zone. Plus, coming off that
weekend, I don't think 1 could get
any more uncomfortable."
Carolyn Moos again led the way
for the Cardinal with 22 points and
eight rebounds. Moos played for 39
minutes, the most she has ever
played in a collegiate game.
Moos was double- and even
tripled-teamed by Illinois forward
Susan Blauser (20 points, 18 re
bounds) and center Alicia Sheeler
(six points, six rebounds), but the
Cardinal couldn't capitalize on the
mismatch and struggled from the
perimeter as well.
"1 thought we played very well
tonight," said Illinois coach Theresa
Grentz. "It's a big win for us. Stan
ford right now is very young and
Tara has a great little nucleus in

there. Those kids are going to be just
fine."
Stanford doesn't have much
time to get back into stride as the
Cardinal hosts top-ranked Purdue
this Sunday at 1 p.m. The Boiler
makets snapped the Tennessee
Lady Volunteers' 46-game winning
streak last Sunday to take over the
No. 1 spot.
