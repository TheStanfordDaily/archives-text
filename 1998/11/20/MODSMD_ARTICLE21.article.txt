# MEN'S SOCCER NCAA PLAYOFFS
## Card hosts SJS 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
All season, the No. 9 Stanford
men's soccer team has approached
each game with intensity as though
it were its last.
Now each game could be the last.
Saturday night, the Cardinal (14-
4-2) hosts San Jose State (14-5-1) in
the first round of the 1998 NCAA
tournament. This is the first time in
the program's history that Stanford
has ever hosted a playoff game, and
the Cardinal has never made it past
the first round of the tournament.
This year's squad, however,
hopes to make history and extend
its season.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Tomorrow: No. 9 Stanford (14-4-
2) vs. San Jose State (14-5-1), 7 p.m.
New Maloney Field.

"This is the time everything has
to be right," said sophomore Corey
Woolfolk. "It is like a final exam.
You can study for the midterms, but
the final is when it counts."
Adding to the mix of excitement
is that the Spartans and Cardinal
have already faced off once this sea

son, with the Spartans emerging vic
torious. San Jose won its first nine
games of the season, including vic
tories against Stanford and then-
No. 18 CalState-Fullerton. After at
taining the No. 3 rank in the nation,
the Spartans lost two games in a
row, and have concluded their sea
son by going 5-5-1.
The 2-1 loss was Stanford's first
home loss since 19%, and only
home loss this season.
"They came to our house and
beat us this year. That is something
that we are going to have to change.
It is payback time," Woolfolk said.
While the early-season loss is an
added incentive for the Cardinal, it
also could serve the Spartans well.
"They beat us already here so
they must take some confidence
from that," said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. "They are a
good side, but I think we underesti
mated them a bit [the first time]. But
we have improved a lot since that
time."
Although Bobby Clark feels the
team has improved, he does not yet
feel it has reached its full potential.
"This team has still to peak and
that is an exciting situation going

into the tournament," he said. "We
feel like we are still growing. [Success]
will come from the players them
selves."
But standing in the way of Stan
ford's success are the Spartans. Lead
ing the fight for San Jose State will be
seniors Eduardo Martinez and Bran
don Snyder, both named to the All-
Western Athletic Conference team.
Martinez leads the Spartans with 10
assists and Snyder has contributed six
goals and seven assists.
This senior guidance will prove
important to both teams. San Jose's
six seniors and Stanford's eight are all
trying to squeak a few more games
out of their college soccer careers.
"Senior leadership is key to any
team," Bobby Clark said. "The lead
ership on the field and off.. .is key to
most successful teams."
On the field, Stanford's seniors
clearly navigate the ship. Senior
Simon Elliott tops the squad in assists
(seven) and points (17), while seniors
A.J. Sauer, Jamie Clark and Adam
Siegman follow as the three next
highest point-scorers. Likewise,
Stanford's heart and soul, its mid
field. is anchored by Elliott and fel

low senior Shan Gaw.
Also key to the Cardinal's game is
its team defense, which starts with
the forwards and reaches back down
the whole field. Redshirt sophomore
goalie Adam Zapala has combined
with his teammates to hold the na
tion's second-lowest goals-against
average at .45, including 13 shotouts.
The defense will also be back at
full strength with the return of junior
defender Andy Hemmerich, who
was sidelined against California last
weekend with a strained hamstring.
He is expected to be ready for action
on Saturday.
While the defense has held its
own, the squad has had trouble scor
ing. Stanford has had more than two
goals only once in its last nine games.
And Bobby Clark trusts that his
team won't fall prey to frustration.
"Our discipline has got us here,
and it is our discipline that is going to
keep us here," he said. "We got our
success by being a good team and we
have to remember that. If we do, this
team has the potential to go very far."
And in his typical fashion, Bobby
Clark put the game in perspective.
"1 think the big thing with this
weekend is that we have to enjoy it."
he said. "This team has so much fun
playing and training that we want to
keep it going as long as we can."
