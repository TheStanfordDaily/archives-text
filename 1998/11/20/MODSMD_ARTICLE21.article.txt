# MEN'S SOCCER NCAA PLAYOFFS
## Card hosts SJS 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
All season, the No. 9 Stanford
men's soccer team has approached
each game with intensity as though
it were its last.
Now each game could be the last.
Saturday night, the Cardinal (14-
4-2) hosts San Jose State (14-5-1) in
the first round of the 1998 NCAA
tournament. This is the first time in
the program's history that Stanford
has ever hosted a playoff game, and
the Cardinal has never made it past
the first round of the tournament.
This year's squad, however,
hopes to make history and extend
its season.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Tomorrow: No. 9 Stanford (14-4-
2) vs. San Jose State (14-5-1), 7 p.m.
New Maloney Field.

"This is the time everything has
to be right," said sophomore Corey
Woolfolk. "It is like a final exam.
You can study for the midterms, but
the final is when it counts."
Adding to the mix of excitement
is that the Spartans and Cardinal
have already faced off once this sea

son, with the Spartans emerging vic
torious. San Jose won its first nine
games of the season, including vic
tories against Stanford and then-
No. 18 CalState-Fullerton. After at
taining the No. 3 rank in the nation,
the Spartans lost two games in a
row, and have concluded their sea
son by going 5-5-1.
The 2-1 loss was Stanford's first
home loss since 19%, and only
home loss this season.
"They came to our house and
beat us this year. That is something
that we are going to have to change.
It is payback time," Woolfolk said.
While the early-season loss is an
added incentive for the Cardinal, it
also could serve the Spartans well.
"They beat us already here so
they must take some confidence
from that," said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. "They are a
good side, but I think we underesti
mated them a bit [the first time]. But
we have improved a lot since that
time."
Although Bobby Clark feels the
team has improved, he does not yet
feel it has reached its full potential.
"This team has still to peak and
that is an exciting situation going
