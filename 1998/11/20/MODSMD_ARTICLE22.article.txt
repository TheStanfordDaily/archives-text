# Volleyball travels south to clich solo title
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has already ensured a tie for its
fifth-consecutive Pacific 10 Confer
ence championship.
But anyone who knows about the
personality of Stanford coach Don
Shaw and his players would tell you
that for this young Cardinal team, a
tie is far from good enough.
With a win tonight at No. 16
UCLA (13-10, 12-4 Pac-10) or on
Sunday against llth-ranked USC
(19-4. 14-2), Stanford (23-2, 16-0)
would win the conference crown
outright.
The fact that the Cardinal has
won 22 straight matches makes a
pair of losses over the weekend un
likely, but such a letdown is extreme
ly possible.
UCLA, which stands in third
place in the Pac-10, has absolutely
turned its season around after an 0-6
start, and is making a furious charge
toward the postseason. Obviously, a
win against Stanford would greatly
help the Bruins' cause.
The Trojans, meanwhile, have
won eight matches in a row and sit
just two games back of Stanford with
as many to play.
Stanford is quite aware of the im
portance of this weekend's matches,
both as determinants of the Pac-10
title and as the final appeal the Car
dinal can make to the NCAA Tour
nament Committee to receive a high
seed, and to possibly host a regional

at Maples Pavilion.
"The matches [this weekend] are
huge for a lot of reasons," said
sophomore setter Lindsay Kagawa.
"First of all, we don't want to share
the Pac-10 title — we want to win it
outright. Second, we know that this
is our last chance to impress the
NCAA selection committee."
Coming into the season, a young
and inexperienced Stanford squad
was certainly expected to vie for the
conference title. Having a share of
the Pac-10 championship wrapped
up before the final weekend of the
season, however, was beyond even
the team's wildest imagination.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 4 Stanford (23-2, 16-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) at No. 16
UCLA (13-10,12-4). 7 p.m..
■ Sunday: Stanford at No. 11 IJSC
(19-4,14-2). 1 p.m..

"1 knew we could do it," said
freshman middle blocker Tara Con
rad. "But I definitely didn't expect us
to have a share before the trip to
L.A.. It's pretty unbelievable."
If the Cardinal hopes to have a
monopoly on the hardware at week
end's end, it will first have to over
come a talented and quickly matur
ing UCLA team.
Freshman outside hitter Ashley
Bowles was named Fac-1() Player of
the Week after hitting .328 with 56
kills in the Bruins' matches against
the Washington schools.

Last week marked the second
consecutive time a UCLA player
earned the Pac-10 honor, as sopho
more middle blocker Elisabeth
Bachman was the winner two weeks
ago. Bachman continued her strong
play against the Washington schools,
hitting well over .400 in both match
es and recording a career-high 12
blocks against Washington.
Add the talent of freshman out
side hitter Kristee Porter, who has 13
20-plus-kill matches this season, and
the Bruins have a ton of young talent
and are ready to test the Cardinal.
USC, the most experienced team
coming into the 1998 season, boasts
a deep lineup headlined by Jennifer
Kessy and Jasmina Marinkovic, the
top-two active career kill leaders in
the Pac-10, and setter Janice
Mounts, an All-Conference selec
tion from a year ago.
The Trojans seem to be taking
fine postseason form in the final
weeks of 1998. as their current eight
game conference winning streak is
the longest in school history.
Nonetheless, Stanford has
proven all season long that despite
its youth, its talent stacks up with
every team in the conference.
Freshman middle blocker Sara
Sandrik, last year's high school play
er of the year, had an immediate im
pact on the offensive system. And
with the recent emergence of fresh
man outside hitter Michelle Cham
bers as a big-time performer on the
left side, the Cardinal attack is multi
faceted and extremely potent.

try to win the Pacific 10 Conference title outright when they travel to
UCLA and USC this weekend.
