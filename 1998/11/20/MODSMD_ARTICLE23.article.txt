## Water polo takes on rival Cal 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
It's been called one of the greatest rivalries in water
polo history. It's become one of Stanford's most time
honored traditions. And it's happening this weekend.
The Stanford-California "Big Splash'' men's water
polo game will be held on Saturday, just prior to Big
Game.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford (16-6) at No. 5 California
(11 -9), 8:30 a.m. Diablo Valley College.

"This is a game we like to win," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "Especially because it's the
greatest rivalry in the sport of water polo and has been
over the years."
No. 2 Stanford is currently 16-6 overall and 6-2 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. No. 5 Cal is 11-9
overall and 4-4 in the MPSF. However, since Satur
day's game is a non-league match, the Cardinal squad
is more concerned with focusing on the league champi

onships.
" Phis game is not super-important," Dettamanti
said. "[lt] will not mean anything except for the rivalry
between the two teams. At this moment, the record is
not important" because it will not affect Stanford's
seeding for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championship tournament.
Stanford ended up being ranked second in the con
ference standings in a three-way tie with I IC-Irvine and
UCLA while USC took the No. 1 spot. Goal-differ
ence was used to determine seeding for the tourna
ment, which left Stanford with the fourth-place seed.
Ironically, that puts Stanford in a first-round match
against Cal at the MPSF tournament.
"Right now, we're pointing towards the first game of
the tournament," Dettamanti said. "So we hope to
peak the second time we play Cal."
The Big Splash should help the Cardinal men fine
tune their play in preparation for meeting Cal at the
conference tournament. Junior Brian Heifferon and
seniors Layne Beaubien and Arturo Rodelo lead Stan-
ford in scoring with 37, 32 and 27
points, respectively. Senior goal
keeper Chris Aguilera, with the
help of the Cardinal's stellar de
fense, is at the top of the league in
least goals allowed per game.
Although Cal has lost nine
games this season, it is still a team to
be reckoned with.
"Every one of those losses has
really been close," Dettamanti said.
"They barely lost to USC two
weeks ago. They lost in overtime by
one point. They are a formidable
team."
And Cal has some talented play
ers who are ready to put up a fight
when Stanford comes their way.
"Cal has three top seniors," Det
tamanti said. "Ryan Flynn is a left
handed hole man and their leading
scorer. Brad Kittredge is the spark
plug of the team ... he's been a real
thorn in our sides. And there's their
goalie Peter Kiefer."
After Saturday's match, Stan
ford will be heading down to New
port Beach for the MPSF tourna
ment. If the Cardinal beats Cal in
the first round, Stanford will face
top-seeded I JSC in the semifinals.
"We're in a position where we
have to win the conference tourna
ment to go to NCAA [champi
onships)," Dettamanti said. "It's re
ally going to be three tough games
and we have to win all three."
Hopefully, Stanford will use Big
Splash to prove that it can dominate
the Golden Bears. A Cardinal win
would lead the team into the league
championships with the added mo
mentum that accompanies a victory
in a long-standing rivalry.
The Big Splash tradition contin
ues at 8:30 am on Saturday, at Dia
