# Men's swim closes out 1998

The Stanford men's swim team set the precedent for
this year's Big Game against California. After the 12th
annual double-distance meet in the spirit of the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry, the Cardinal proved its domination
over the Golden Bears by capturing the last Cal record
left on the all-time top-times list for each event of the
meet.
Senior late Blahnik. the defending NCAA champi
on in the 2(X)-yard backstroke, placed far ahead of any of
the competition to come in first with a time of 3:43.38 in
the double-distance 4(K), shattering by three seconds
Cal's Bart Sikora's record set in l l )%. Besides being de
fending backstroke champion, Blahnik qualified last
summer as a baekstroker for the World University
Games. Blahnik's capture of the backstroke record gave
Stanford a sweep of the every first-place record of every
event in the history of the meet.
"Tate's swim was the highlight of the whole day," said
head coach Skip Kenney. "He had the best swim of the
meet. Tate's been training at a higher level. What the
meet showed lis today was that we need more guys to
swim at that level."
Despite the fact that Blahnik smashed the backstroke
record and swam at such a high level so early in the sea
son, he was not completely happy with his swim. I le fell
"just short" of what he wanted to accomplish. Blahnik's
personal goal of the season is to break Brian Better's
American record at NCAAs and be the first American
to swim the 2(K)-yard backstroke in under 1:40.(K).
As teams, Stanford and Cal split first places, each
winning three events. Stanford still triumphed against
the Bears by winning the last event, the <S(K)-vard

freestyle relay. Still, allowing Cal to gain so many first
places, even though the meet was not scored, might have
given it the thought that it had a chance to surpass Stan
ford.
"(The meet] gave Cal some life," said junior Kurt
Spenser. "We let them get back into it mentally. They
won some tight races; we were a little off of our game
today."
The Cardinal also won the 2,(XK)-vard freestyle (Matt
O'Mara, 18:48.46) and the 800 individual medley
(Steven Brown, Blahnik was the only swimmer
on the team with a top time of the season at the meet.
This is the hardest part of the team's training, swim
ming twice daily and doing dry-land training as well.
Many of the team members are broken down and many
have also gotten sick, and thus have started the season
off slower than usual.
"You have to make up your mind to swim without
any outside influences," Kenney said. "Being broken
down is part of the sport. You have to work through
that."
Although the team is broken down now and gave up
some tough races to a team with some good members
such as Cal, but without as much depth as Stanford, the
Cardinal still has realistic hopes of repeating last year's
Pacific 10 Championship victory as well as defending its
NCAA Championship title. Kenney feels that the team
is on track and is working hard to attain these goals.
What the team really needs to work on between now and
March's NCAAs is racing.
"We had some good swims today, but we need to
learn to swim faster when we are broken down. This
meet was all about getting out and beating the guy next
to you and we saw that we have some work to do,"
Spenser said.
