# Card, Bears renew rivalry
## 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Every Division I coach fears
them. The season when he doesn't
have any returning seniors. The
season where the breaks go the
other way. The season that's more
Titanic than Love Boat, more
"Hamlet" than "Henry V," more
Fredricksburg than Gettysburg.
Sooner or later, every major Divi
sion 1 football program is going to
suffer through a rebuilding year,
and its public relations department
will be forced to whistle past the
graveyard by talking about youth
and inexperience and the future.

FOOTBALL
â–  Tomorrow: Stanford (2-8, 1-6 Pa
cific 10 Conference) at California (5-
5, 3-4), 12:30 p.m. Memorial Stadi
um, Berkeley. TV: KGO (SCTV Ch.
27). RADIO: KTCT (1050 AM),
KZSU (90.1 FM).

That's why the football gods in
vented rivalry weekend. Rivalry
weekend, be it Big Game, The
Game, Army-Navy, Michigan-
Ohio State or Williams-Amherst,
offers a chance at redemption for
beleaguered programs. It's an op
portunity to erase in one fell swoop
a season of heartache and despair
and replace it with the glistening
memory of a season-ending tri
umph over most-hated foes.
Head coach Tyrone Willingham
and the 2-8 Stanford Cardinal find
themselves in just such a situation
entering tomorrow's 101st Big
(Tame. Billed as a rebuilding year
as early as 1994, when departing
head coach Bill Walsh redshirted
only six freshmen, the season has
been a mixed bag composed pri
marily of defeats of every kind.
There was the drubbing at Oregon
and the humiliation at home
against USC. There was the near
miss overtime disaster at ASU, and
the domination by Notre Dame.
And there was very nearly the
biggest upset of the '90s at then-
Bowl Championship Series No. 1
UCLA.
Fortunately, the Cardinal can
erase all of that with an upset of 5-5
Cal tomorrow. Sweetening the pot
for Stanford is the opportunity to
ruin Berkeley's season, as the Bears
need a win to become bowl-eligible.
"I'm from the Bay Area, and so
I'll see a bunch of Cal guys 1 know on
weekends and it'll make it a lot easier
if I can know we beat them," said se
nior outside linebacker Donnie Spra
gan. "This is pretty much our season,
so it's 1 (K) times more powerful. You
develop a real dislike for Cal when
you're grunting and sweating and
bleeding with them on the field."
Spragan figures to be one of the
keys to stopping Cal, as he has been
dominant in the past month, roughly
coinciding with the improved overall
play of the Stanford defense. In the
first six games of the season. Spragan
had 16 tackles, one tackle-for-!oss, no
quarterback sacks, two interceptions
and two pass deflections.
He's more than doubled those
numbers, with 37 tackles, five pass
break-ups, three quarterback sacks,
eight tackles-for-loss and one inter
ception. Against USC, Spragan
recorded a season-high 11 tackles,
then topped it the next week against

WSU with 13 more, five of which
were for a loss.
However, it will probably be the
matchup of the Stanford offense
against Cal's defense that will deter
mine the game. Led by junior Todd
Husak, the Cardinal has averaged
321 yards per game in the air, leading
the Pacific 10 Conference and good
for eighth in the nation. Even if
Husak gets off to a rough start, Stan
ford has a superb backup in sopho
more Joe Borchard, who came off
the bench in the Washington State
game to go eight of for 162 yards
and a touchdown.
In fact, Stanford used all three
quarterbacks against WSU. Husak
went 12 of 28 for 142 yards and a
touchdown in the first half before
being replaced by Borchard. Sopho
more Randy Fasani entered the
game twice and ran the goal-line of
fense with the same competence and
poise he's demonstrated all year
long. Both times, Fasani ran for
touchdowns.
The Bears' defense enters Big
Game ranked third in the conference
in total defense, allowing just 343
total yards per game. Led by line
backer Sekou Sanyika, Cal has also
allowed just 24 points a game, posing
a challenge for the high-scoring Stan
ford offense and defense.
