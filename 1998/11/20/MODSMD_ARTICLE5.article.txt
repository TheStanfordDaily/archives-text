# Barrio Assistance helps many from E. Palo Alto
## 
### Joanna Corman 
It is 8:30 a.m. on this gray and wet Sat
urday morning and senior Gaby Ruiz is
driving a bus by Palo Alto's ivy-covered
gated homes on her way to East Menlo
Park. When she crosses Highway 101, the
houses become smaller, brighter, and
spill into the street. Her first stop is Eric,
7, a chubby boy with soft brown eyes. I le
clambers into the 15-passenger van.
"Put your seat belt on," she tells him.
Ruiz is a coordinator for Barrio Assis
tance, a 27-year-old tutoring program for

Latino children in the East Palo Alto
area. The program runs every Saturday
out of El Centro ( 'hicano. the Latino cen
ter on campus.
The program is about empowering
children to help their community. It aims
to impart the value of education, help the
kids become comfortable being bilingual,
and perhaps ease the transitions in and
out of adolescence. The program, Stan
ford students say. is reciprocal. The kids
and tutors learn from each other.
It's breakfast back at El Centro and
the kids line up for sophomore Elena

Conte's pancakes. Daniel, 7, dances
when he sees them. "Would you guys like
three?" Conte asks.
"Four please!" Daniel answers. There
are big smiles when they walk out the
door, holding paper plates piled with
syrupy pancakes, apple and banana
slices.
"Go have pancakes so you can grow."
senior Jocelyn Wiener tells a boy sitting
down.
The buses have arrived and kids start
swooping in. They fidget and make run
ning dunks to put their jackets on the

couch. A group of little boys with slicked
hair and smiles gathers at the door, talk
ing. Roughhousing starts. One kid gets
pushed down, but Ruiz immediately in
tervenes.
"There's a little bit more adrenaline,"
Wiener says. It's raining today so they
have to stay inside. After breakfast, the
tutors and their kids get to work. Each
pair gets a goal sheet — a weekly progress
report where they record what they'll
work on that day. Before the children ar-
rive, a coordinator will review goals
from the previous week to make
sure everyone's on track.
Some of the children and their
tutors are sitting on the stairs in
pairs. Others are reading together,
doing flashcards, puzzles, drawing,
working on the computers or play
ing with Mr. Potato Head. There's a
quiet buzzing.
Building community ties
Because Barrio Assistance is so
popular, the coordinators estab
lished Bridge in 1996, a Friday-night
mentoring program for seventh and
eighth graders — for the children
who graduated from Barrio and for
the brothers and sisters of those in
the Saturday program.
"It was straight out a demand
from the families," says senior An
dres Romero, who was a Barrio
tutor last year and is now coordinat
ing for Bridge.
The programs serve about 70
children who will meet more than 30
times this year.
Latino students from Stanford
founded Barrio Assistance in 1971,
as a family-based program that
(would address poor education in
East Palo Alto's Latino community.
In both programs, a child is paired
with a Stanford student who acts as
a tutor and mentor for the year.

They take the children to places
such as East Palo Alto City Hall, the
San Francisco Zoo and camping.
They also bring in campus groups,
such as Ballet Folklorico and El
Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford.
Both programs emphasize com
munity building — the word barrio
is Spanish for neighborhood, and
sometimes whole families go
through the program. "Makes for
better working relationships," with
the parents, says senior Lindsay
Kinder, who joined as a Barrio tutor
her freshman year and stayed on as
a coordinator.
Every year, the numbers grow
and every year coordinators have to
reject tutors. This year, they sorted
through 120 applications for 90
spots, including substitutes. And
both programs have waiting lists for
children.
The programs are about helping
these kids beat the odds. Almost 30
percent of Latinos in the United
States fell below the poverty level in
19%, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau, compared to 13 percent for
all races.
Most elementary and secondary
school students attending urban
schools are minorities and tend to
be poor, a 1995 Urban Institute
study says. Latino 13-year-olds, the
study says, score in science at about
the same level as white nine-year
olds. Inner city schools don't have as
many resources as their wealthier
suburban counterparts. That's
where Barrio Assistance and Bridge

come in.
Addressing Inequality
Turnover is so fast among tutors,
says Kinder, it's hard to maintain
the programs. So coordinators are
asked to commit for two years and
tutors for one year. "Kids get frantic
when you abandon them." Kinder
says. Coordinators spend an aver
age of 25 hours each week prepar
ing, supervising. mentoring or tutor
ing if needed.
About 6() percent of the tutors
are Latino, the rest are spread out
among the ethnic groups. Kinder
says.
The children spend two hours a
week with their mentors. It doesn't
seem like a lot ol time to make a dif
ference. But the children show
change, say the tutors. One hoy, an
11-year-old fourth grader who will
be referred to as Pedro, couldn't
read or write when he started Barrio
Assistance several years ago.
"He was getting E's on his
spelling." Kinder says. But he
brought in his schoolwork, and now
his spelling efforts merit A s. She
shows off the paper, with an A at the
top.
"I'm proud," she says.
"Not that we single-handedly
teach them in two hours how to
read." Kinder explains. "I le wanted
to learn. We send a message that ed
ucation is a powerful tool and some
thing to be proud of. They're good
kids, smart kids." and their parents

want them to be here, she says.
More than a job
The students do more than tutor
once a week. Sometimes if the "kids
get into trouble, the parents turn to
HA for help." says Kinder. "We talk
to prison authorities, social workers,
teachers." Their friendships often
extend beyond their two hours each
week. Sometimes they take their
friend out or the family cooks for
them.
When Pedro was placed in a spe
cial education class because of his
behavioral problems. Kinder says,
"his mom was worried something
was wrong with her kid." Wiener,
Pedro's tutor, helped explain the sit
uation to his mother, who was illit
erate. Wiener would visit Pedro in
school to make sure he was doing
OK. He had a lot going on at home
and when he got frustrated, "he
would just shut down," Wiener says.
Some of the children have a lot to
deal with at a young age. There's
very little money in East Palo Alto,
says Kinder. I here might be a temp
tation to get involved in drugs. Some
families are involved in the drug
trade.
"(iangs are omnipresent in East
Palo Alto." Kinder says."The kids
here see it on the street, they see it in
school, sometimes their siblings are
involved."
At home, they might not gel
enough academic support. Some
parents work two shifts a day at low

wage jobs and can't afford books.
Kinder says. Other parents can't
read or write.
The kids, whose parents may not
have the resources to ensure their
children's educational success, are
aware of the haves and the have
nots. Whiskey Gulch is a corner
lined with liquor stores at the edge
of Hast Palo Alto. Turn the corner,
and there is Palo Alto with its im
maculate streets.
"The kids hate it." Kinder says.
They talk about turning the liquor
stores into grocery stores.
" They must feel like there's a
wall, and they can't cross it," she
says.
Sophomore Cassandra Sweet, a
coordinator of Bridge, says her kid
last year, second-grader Patricia,
lived just over the creek dividing
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto. One
afternoon. Sweet went to her house
to go bike riding. To avoid the
humpy streets without sidewalks,
Sweet suggested riding across the
bridge.
'"I've never been across that
bridge.'" Patricia told her. "It never
occurred to her to ride in Palo Alto
because it wasn't her neighbor
hood," Sweet says.
Working both ways
While the program is good for
the children, it also changes the tu
tors and coordinators' lives.
"There are four kids who have
changed my entire career path and

life vision," Wiener says. "Some
times it seems like there're so many
problems, and nothing can get
changed. [Pedro] was just really
hardened and written off by a lot of
people. It reconfirmed people can
be reached and are worth reaching."
The coordinators are clear that
they're not saving these kids. The
way community service is described,
they say, makes volunteers seem
like saviors.
"We're opposed to people who
have the conception of the program
as a charity," says Conte. "[But] it's
hard to separate the attitude of the
volunteer from the end result. Ser
vice is being done, and that's a posi
tive thing."
It takes more than $20.(XM) to run
the programs, which they get from
an ASSU special fee, money stu
dents pay to cover the costs of cam
pus clubs, as well as grant money —
but that doesn't always come in.
Kinder won't divulge the exact
amount of grants because "we
worry people will think we're over
funded."
Many of the mentors talked
about how it's easy to get isolated at
Stanford. But the kids change that.
"The one thing I notice about
Stanford students is we lose touch
with the outside world." says sopho
more Isobel Cesanto, a Bridge
tutor.
"At home I was so full of life. It's
so nice not to lose that. To take a
step back and look at everything
from a child's eyes."

children to help their community. It aims
to impart the value of education, help the
kids become comfortable being bilingual,
and perhaps ease the transitions in and
out of adolescence. The program, Stan
ford students say. is reciprocal. The kids
and tutors learn from each other.
It's breakfast back at El Centro and
the kids line up for sophomore Elena

Conte's pancakes. Daniel, 7, dances
when he sees them. "Would you guys like
three?" Conte asks.
"Four please!" Daniel answers. There
are big smiles when they walk out the
door, holding paper plates piled with
syrupy pancakes, apple and banana
slices.
"Go have pancakes so you can grow."
senior Jocelyn Wiener tells a boy sitting
down.
The buses have arrived and kids start
swooping in. They fidget and make run
ning dunks to put their jackets on the

couch. A group of little boys with slicked
hair and smiles gathers at the door, talk
ing. Roughhousing starts. One kid gets
pushed down, but Ruiz immediately in
tervenes.
"There's a little bit more adrenaline,"
Wiener says. It's raining today so they
have to stay inside. After breakfast, the
tutors and their kids get to work. Each
pair gets a goal sheet — a weekly progress
report where they record what they'll
work on that day. Before the children ar-
rive, a coordinator will review goals
from the previous week to make
sure everyone's on track.
Some of the children and their
tutors are sitting on the stairs in
pairs. Others are reading together,
doing flashcards, puzzles, drawing,
working on the computers or play
ing with Mr. Potato Head. There's a
quiet buzzing.
Building community ties
Because Barrio Assistance is so
popular, the coordinators estab
lished Bridge in 1996, a Friday-night
mentoring program for seventh and
eighth graders — for the children
who graduated from Barrio and for
the brothers and sisters of those in
the Saturday program.
"It was straight out a demand
from the families," says senior An
dres Romero, who was a Barrio
tutor last year and is now coordinat
ing for Bridge.
The programs serve about 70
children who will meet more than 30
times this year.
Latino students from Stanford
founded Barrio Assistance in 1971,
as a family-based program that
(would address poor education in
East Palo Alto's Latino community.
In both programs, a child is paired
with a Stanford student who acts as
a tutor and mentor for the year.

They take the children to places
such as East Palo Alto City Hall, the
San Francisco Zoo and camping.
They also bring in campus groups,
such as Ballet Folklorico and El
Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford.
Both programs emphasize com
munity building — the word barrio
is Spanish for neighborhood, and
sometimes whole families go
through the program. "Makes for
better working relationships," with
the parents, says senior Lindsay
Kinder, who joined as a Barrio tutor
her freshman year and stayed on as
a coordinator.
Every year, the numbers grow
and every year coordinators have to
reject tutors. This year, they sorted
through 120 applications for 90
spots, including substitutes. And
both programs have waiting lists for
children.
The programs are about helping
these kids beat the odds. Almost 30
percent of Latinos in the United
States fell below the poverty level in
19%, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau, compared to 13 percent for
all races.
Most elementary and secondary
school students attending urban
schools are minorities and tend to
be poor, a 1995 Urban Institute
study says. Latino 13-year-olds, the
study says, score in science at about
the same level as white nine-year
olds. Inner city schools don't have as
many resources as their wealthier
suburban counterparts. That's
where Barrio Assistance and Bridge

come in.
Addressing Inequality
Turnover is so fast among tutors,
says Kinder, it's hard to maintain
the programs. So coordinators are
asked to commit for two years and
tutors for one year. "Kids get frantic
when you abandon them." Kinder
says. Coordinators spend an aver
age of 25 hours each week prepar
ing, supervising. mentoring or tutor
ing if needed.
About 6() percent of the tutors
are Latino, the rest are spread out
among the ethnic groups. Kinder
says.
The children spend two hours a
week with their mentors. It doesn't
seem like a lot ol time to make a dif
ference. But the children show
change, say the tutors. One hoy, an
11-year-old fourth grader who will
be referred to as Pedro, couldn't
read or write when he started Barrio
Assistance several years ago.
"He was getting E's on his
spelling." Kinder says. But he
brought in his schoolwork, and now
his spelling efforts merit A s. She
shows off the paper, with an A at the
top.
"I'm proud," she says.
"Not that we single-handedly
teach them in two hours how to
read." Kinder explains. "I le wanted
to learn. We send a message that ed
ucation is a powerful tool and some
thing to be proud of. They're good
kids, smart kids." and their parents

want them to be here, she says.
More than a job
The students do more than tutor
once a week. Sometimes if the "kids
get into trouble, the parents turn to
HA for help." says Kinder. "We talk
to prison authorities, social workers,
teachers." Their friendships often
extend beyond their two hours each
week. Sometimes they take their
friend out or the family cooks for
them.
When Pedro was placed in a spe
cial education class because of his
behavioral problems. Kinder says,
"his mom was worried something
was wrong with her kid." Wiener,
Pedro's tutor, helped explain the sit
uation to his mother, who was illit
erate. Wiener would visit Pedro in
school to make sure he was doing
OK. He had a lot going on at home
and when he got frustrated, "he
would just shut down," Wiener says.
Some of the children have a lot to
deal with at a young age. There's
very little money in East Palo Alto,
says Kinder. I here might be a temp
tation to get involved in drugs. Some
families are involved in the drug
trade.
"(iangs are omnipresent in East
Palo Alto." Kinder says."The kids
here see it on the street, they see it in
school, sometimes their siblings are
involved."
At home, they might not gel
enough academic support. Some
parents work two shifts a day at low

wage jobs and can't afford books.
Kinder says. Other parents can't
read or write.
The kids, whose parents may not
have the resources to ensure their
children's educational success, are
aware of the haves and the have
nots. Whiskey Gulch is a corner
lined with liquor stores at the edge
of Hast Palo Alto. Turn the corner,
and there is Palo Alto with its im
maculate streets.
"The kids hate it." Kinder says.
They talk about turning the liquor
stores into grocery stores.
" They must feel like there's a
wall, and they can't cross it," she
says.
Sophomore Cassandra Sweet, a
coordinator of Bridge, says her kid
last year, second-grader Patricia,
lived just over the creek dividing
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto. One
afternoon. Sweet went to her house
to go bike riding. To avoid the
humpy streets without sidewalks,
Sweet suggested riding across the
bridge.
'"I've never been across that
bridge.'" Patricia told her. "It never
occurred to her to ride in Palo Alto
because it wasn't her neighbor
hood," Sweet says.
Working both ways
While the program is good for
the children, it also changes the tu
tors and coordinators' lives.
"There are four kids who have
changed my entire career path and

life vision," Wiener says. "Some
times it seems like there're so many
problems, and nothing can get
changed. [Pedro] was just really
hardened and written off by a lot of
people. It reconfirmed people can
be reached and are worth reaching."
The coordinators are clear that
they're not saving these kids. The
way community service is described,
they say, makes volunteers seem
like saviors.
"We're opposed to people who
have the conception of the program
as a charity," says Conte. "[But] it's
hard to separate the attitude of the
volunteer from the end result. Ser
vice is being done, and that's a posi
tive thing."
It takes more than $20.(XM) to run
the programs, which they get from
an ASSU special fee, money stu
dents pay to cover the costs of cam
pus clubs, as well as grant money —
but that doesn't always come in.
Kinder won't divulge the exact
amount of grants because "we
worry people will think we're over
funded."
Many of the mentors talked
about how it's easy to get isolated at
Stanford. But the kids change that.
"The one thing I notice about
Stanford students is we lose touch
with the outside world." says sopho
more Isobel Cesanto, a Bridge
tutor.
"At home I was so full of life. It's
so nice not to lose that. To take a
step back and look at everything
from a child's eyes."
It is 8:30 a.m. on this gray and wet Sat
urday morning and senior Gaby Ruiz is
driving a bus by Palo Alto's ivy-covered
gated homes on her way to East Menlo
Park. When she crosses Highway 101, the
houses become smaller, brighter, and
spill into the street. Her first stop is Eric,
7, a chubby boy with soft brown eyes. I le
clambers into the 15-passenger van.
"Put your seat belt on," she tells him.
Ruiz is a coordinator for Barrio Assis
tance, a 27-year-old tutoring program for

Latino children in the East Palo Alto
area. The program runs every Saturday
out of El Centro ( 'hicano. the Latino cen
ter on campus.
