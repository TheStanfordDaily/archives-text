According to Margie Whitnah. career guidance assis
tant at Redwood High School, about the only thing her
school has in common with Stanford is its choice of an
evergreen tree for a mascot.
But that has not stopped Stanford students from help
ing out the school through the new CIfOICE program, an
acronym for College and I lealth Options: Ideas ( ieating
Excellence.
Redwood High School, a continuing school, is de

signed to help low-income youth to receive a high school
diploma after falling behind schedule. Whitnah says the
students are not necessarily high achievers, and many al
ready have children.
"It's fantastic," Whitnah said of the program. "It gives
kids an opportunity they wouldn't normally have."
At Redwood High, students are trying to finish their
requirements
"We want to give them a sense of confidence," said
master's student DeLise Cousins, who co-founded
C H( )ICE. "We want to show that college is a
possibility for them."

The program is in its pilot year, and Stanford students
have traveled to six different area high schools this quar
ter.
("1K )ICE is an offshoot of the summer Stanford Med
ical Youth Science Program, which targets low-income
youth with a strong academic record in math and science.
Last year, that program received 438 applications for
23 spots, said sophomore Andrea Jackson.
"The kids who are needing the information most aren't
getting it," she said, explaining the need for a different
type of program.
In the five-week program, stu
dents meet once a week with youth
to lead an interactive seminar pre
senting information about careers in
the field of health care.
Seminars also address issues such
as leadership, motivation and ex
ploring career resources.
"We want them to focus on what
resources they have and how they
can get help from other people,"
Jackson said.

"I think it's going to get them con
nected to people who care," Whit
nah said.
The seminars also feature role
playing exercises.
"We give them scenarios, such as
one of their friends wants to quit
school and work full time at a mini
mum-wage job," Cousins said.
Students are then asked how they
would encourage their friends to
stay in school.
Whitnah said she felt the program
gave students the opportunity to
show they can be leaders.
"They can be mentors for each
other," she said.
