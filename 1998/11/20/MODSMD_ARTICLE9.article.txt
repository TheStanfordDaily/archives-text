# Larimore to leave for Dartmouth

### Alice Brown 
Assistant to the Provost James Larimore was
appointed Dean of the College at Dartmouth last
Friday, Nov. 13. This is the chief student affairs
role, a vice presidential-level position similar to
Stanford's vice provost for student affairs.
Larimore has been at Stanford since 1985,
when he took over the position of Assistant Dean
of Students. Since then he has held a variety of dif
ferent positions, including residence dean, dean of
Native American affairs and director of the Amer
ican Indian program.
He has served as a resident fellow for Muwek
ma-Tah-Ruk, the Native American theme house.
Larimore has also served on committees and task
forces including the Student Affairs Strategic
Planning Committee, the Greek Life Task Force,
the Provost's Advisory Group on Multicultural
Affairs and the 1992 Presidential Search Commit
tee.

He was awarded Stanford's highest award for

outstanding service to undergraduate education in
1994.
Larimore is already familiar with Dartmouth,
as he was the assistant director of admissions there
from 1983 to 1985. While there, he focused pri
marily on Native American recruitment.
"My wife Karen and I are very happy to he
coming back to Dartmouth," he said. "I look for
ward to working with President Wright, Provost
Prager, faculty, students, alumni, my colleagues
and friends in the Dean of the College area, and
other campus administrators to build on Dart
mouth's notable strengths and distinctive quali
ties."
As Dean of the College at Dartmouth, Lari
more will be responsible for all undergraduate stu
dent life outside the classroom and for offices and
activities such as the Office of Residential Life, the
Dartmouth College Athletics Department and the
Native American Program.
"I will work closely with students, faculty and
staff to build a stronger, more inclusive array of op-

tions for residential and social life at Dartmouth,"
Larimore said.
Larimore and his wife will move east this sum
mer shortly after Commencement, as soon as he
completes his dissertation. He became a full-time
doctoral student in 1994, but returned to adminis
trative work shortly after as the acting Dean of
Students. He held this position for six months be
fore current dean Marc Wais was hired.
Larimore's doctoral work is in administration
and policy analysis with a focus on higher educa
tion. His interests are in the sociology of organiza
tions and organizational development, and his dis
sertation is a comparative case study of Native
American programs at Stanford and Dartmouth.
In announcing Larimore's appointment, Dart
mouth President James Wright said, "Jim has dis
played a remarkable understanding of the impor
tance of achieving and maintaining both diversity
and unity within an educational community. He
will bring to Dartmouth the vision needed for such
a community."
