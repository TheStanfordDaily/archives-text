■§■■1 mi lethal sexually
transmitted disease, and
everyone who is sexually
active may be at risk. It
infects one in every 500 college
students. Vou can protect yourself
by understanding the disease,
practicing abstinence or "safer
sex," and getting tested if you
have reason to be concerned.
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus) attacks the immune
system, damaging its ability to
fight off infections. AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome) is the life-threatening
stage of HIV infection, but the
virus can be transmitted before it
reaches this stage.
AIDS sufferers' life spans have
been extended by new antiviral
drugs, but they have serious
side effects, and they don't work
for everyone.
How It Spreads
HIV is transmitted only through
body fluids (in most cases, blood
and semen). Exposure to these
fluids (through vaginal, anal, or
oral sex, through needles, or
other means of blood conta
mination) results in a high risk of
getting the virus. But because it is
fragile, you can not get HIV from
the air, water, or the surfaces of
objects.
Anal and vaginal intercourse
without a latex condom are the
sexual practices most likely to
spread the virus, with the highest
risk to the receptive partner. Oral
sex can spread it especially if
semen is ejaculated into the
mouth.
Gone are the days when immunity
to infection could be insured in the
laundry. These are Stanford
nursing students in 1922.
What To Do
Practice safer sex to protect
yourself from infection:
■ Abstain from any risky
sexual activity, or
■ Use a latex (not an animal
skin) condom for each
intercourse
■ Use a "dental dam" (a sheet
of latex or plastic food wrap)
during oral sex (Note:
"French" kissing can also be
risky if your partner has an
oral cut or sore)
■ Never share a tattoo, ear, or
body-piercing needle with
anyone
■ Watch your use of alcohol or
other drugs - sex under the
influence impairs clear think
ing and can lead to careless
decisions later regretted
■ Be proactive: Assertively
negotiate with your partner
for consistent safer sex
practices
Remember, you can't tell just by
looking at someone if they have
HIV. Even clean-cut and
collegiate-looking people are
infected. Vou also can't tell from
someone's sexual history. Up to
38% of college students admit
they lie about it in order to have
Getting Tested
If there is any chance
that you are infected,
consider getting tested.
HIV antibodies can be accurately
detected three months after
infection. If you test positive,
you'll be able to preserve your
health with early treatment, and
take precautions so you don't
infect others. If you test negative
you'll be relieved and more
educated about your risks.
Cowell offers two testing options:
testing by a medical practitioner,
or anonymous testing by a
trained peer counselor or health
educator (chosen by most stu
dents). You need to schedule an
appointment for either option
(call 724-CARE and press option 3).
Myths
Help remove some of the stigma
of HIV. Debunk the myths that
HIV can be transmitted by:
■ Sharing cups, kitchen
utensils, or a bathroom with
an infected person
■ Close contact with an infect
ed person, such as hugging
■ Donating blood
