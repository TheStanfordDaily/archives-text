r.
The author of Iron John,
together with.an eminent
psychotherapist, reunite jthe
masculine and the feminine.
Robert Bly and Marion Woodman interpret the deep psychological
insights imbedded in ancient stories, in this
instance a Russian folktale about bringing femi
nine energy back into the
world. The Maiden King
tells of an absent father, a
possessive stepmother, a
false tutor, and a young man
overwhelmed by a beautiful
maiden and her thirty sisters.
The male tendency to go to
sleep in the face of feminine
magnificence, female fear of
power and of abandonment that
leads to rage, the need to get
beyond oppositional thinking
enroute to the Divine—these are
issues the book addresses with wis
m
dom and lyrical beauty. The Maiden \
\
King is the true heir to Iron John,
Bly's number-one national best-seller
about men.
