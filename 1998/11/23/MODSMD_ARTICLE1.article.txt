# STANFORD 10, CAL 3
## We've still got it: Cardinal keeps Axe 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Stanford entered Saturday's 101st Big
Game an underdog by seven and a half
points, with just one conference win to its
name (at the hands of the lowly Washington
State Cougars) and a depleted defensive
line. It faced a Cal team bitter from three
straight Big Game defeats, with a tough de
fense and bowl chances riding on the out
come of the game.
Really, Stanford shouldn't have had a
chance. But as if following a Hollywood
script, the ragtag Cardinal defense stood up
and did its best Steel Curtain imitation, hold
ing Cal to negative 36 yards rushing and
three points.
The Bears had about as much success pro
tecting their quarterback as they did finding
the end zone, as senior quarterback Justin
Vedder was sacked nine times by a suddenly
resurgent Cardinal pass rush, and Stanford
was able to hold on for a 10-3 victory.
The teams matched strength against
when the high-octane Stanford (3-8,
r2-6 Pacific 10 Conference) passing

attack faced the Pac-10's third-best defense,
and weakness against weakness when the
last-ranked Stanford defense took the field
against the last-ranked Cal (5-6,3-5) offense.
Who could have predicted that the teams
would combine for 13 points?
"Well, it's Big Game," said head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Something is always
different. Historically, in this rivalry, unex
pected things happen. To say [the defense's
performance] was outstanding would proba
bly be an understatement. They stepped up
big. Our defense's problem has been big
plays and today we were able to eliminate
long runs and only give up a few big pass
plays."
Early on, Stanford couldn't capitalize on
its own big pass play. On third-and-long of its
first possession, quarterback Todd Husak
found Emory Brock in the left flat on a swing
pass. Brock broke a tackle and rumbled 61
yards down the sideline to the Cal 25.
Stanford couldn't move the ball and
brought Keym Miller onto the field for a
short field fi&l. However,
M i ll e X J

missed the kick wide right, and would miss
another gimme early in the second quarter.
"Kevin just had one of those stretches
where he didn't execute his job as well as he
could have." Willingham said.
Meanwhile, Cal took a 3-0

lead into halftime cour
tesy of Ignacio
Brache's 33-yard

field goal.

Diedrick resorted to the quarterback
carousel that proved so effective against
ASU. The key play of the drive came on
third-and-one at the Cal 46-yard line, after
Brian Allen had recovered Deßonnie
Pitts' fumble.

Husak stood in
against two on-jl
rushing BeadP
linebackers

long enough to hit Emory Brock wide open
in the flat. Brock turned upfield and scam
pered to the Cal seven-yard line for a 39-yard
gain, giving him the unusual receiving line of
two catches for exactly 100 yards and no
touchdowns. On the very next play, Husak
hit a diving Troy Walters on a quick slant un
derneath the Cal coverage to take a 7-3 lead,

quieting the blue portion ol the
crowd of almost 7(),(XH).
"I was on a slant and soil ol" got
under the coverage," Walters said.
"Todd threw an excellent ball, right
where it had to be."
()n Stanford's next possession, a
mix of over-aggressive play a ques
tionable Hag cost it a chance to put
the game away. I lusak hit Walters on
a deep fade over a confused ('al cor
nel back. Walters skipped around
( liidi Iwuoma and dove to come up
with what appeared to be a 25-yard
touchdown p;iss. Instead. Walters
was flagged with a 15-yard offensive

pass interference penalty, negating
the score.
"I'll just give you the facts." Wal
lers said. "It was a go route. I was out
side of the defender and the ball was
inside and ;i little bit underthrown, so
I was just trying to battle back inside.
I hey said I grabbed him as I went by.
I saw the line judge wasn't giving me
the touchdown signal, and then I saw
the flag and all their fans pointing.
"I was very surprised. I haven't
been called for pass interference all
year, maybe not in my career."
I lie penalty seemed to blunt the
Stanford attack, as it took the Cardi
nal out of field goal range and subse
quently forced them to punt. Later,
Miller redeemed himself with an IX
vard field goal to give Stanford a 10-3

lead in the fourth quarter.
The Stanford defense, led by
Sharcus Steen's three sacks, repeat
edly stuffed the Bears' struggling of
fense. but the Cardinal offense was
unable to run significant time off the
clock. Cal got its last chance with
under four minutes to play, but
couldn't capitalize on the latest Stan
ford special teams disaster.
Deltlia O'Neil took a Miller punt
and swept left, reversed his field, and
found a lot of daylight en route to a
57-yard return to the Stanford 31-
yard line. Only Tank Williams'shoe
string tackle saved a game-tying
touchdown.
"I think it was actually Kevin
Miller who did a great job on the cov
erage there," Willingham said. "He

forced |()'Ncil| out of the darkness,
forced him to make a second cut."
After picking up a first down,
Stanford's ninth sack of the day gave
C;il second and 15 at the Stanford 25-
yard line with under two minutes to
play, but Vedder threw three straight
incomplctions.
The win, Stanford's fourth
straight BigCiame triumph, stuck the
Bears with a losing record and denied
them any chance at a howl game.
Willingham, who remained unde
feated against Cal as both a head
coach and an assistant coach, denied
any extra satisfaction from ruining
the Bears' season.
"Now. what loyal Stanford fan
would take any satisfaction from
that?" he said with a smile.

found a lot of daylight en route to a
57-yard return to the Stanford 31-
yard line. Only Tank Williams'shoe
string tackle saved a game-tying
touchdown.
"I think it was actually Kevin
Miller who did a great job on the cov
erage there," Willingham said. "He

forced |()'Ncil| out of the darkness,
forced him to make a second cut."
After picking up a first down,
Stanford's ninth sack of the day gave
C;il second and 15 at the Stanford 25-
yard line with under two minutes to
play, but Vedder threw three straight
incomplctions.
The win, Stanford's fourth
straight BigCiame triumph, stuck the
Bears with a losing record and denied
them any chance at a howl game.
Willingham, who remained unde
feated against Cal as both a head
coach and an assistant coach, denied
any extra satisfaction from ruining
the Bears' season.
"Now. what loyal Stanford fan
would take any satisfaction from
that?" he said with a smile.
