# STANFORD 10, CAL 3
## We've still got it: Cardinal keeps Axe 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Stanford entered Saturday's 101st Big
Game an underdog by seven and a half
points, with just one conference win to its
name (at the hands of the lowly Washington
State Cougars) and a depleted defensive
line. It faced a Cal team bitter from three
straight Big Game defeats, with a tough de
fense and bowl chances riding on the out
come of the game.
Really, Stanford shouldn't have had a
chance. But as if following a Hollywood
script, the ragtag Cardinal defense stood up
and did its best Steel Curtain imitation, hold
ing Cal to negative 36 yards rushing and
three points.
The Bears had about as much success pro
tecting their quarterback as they did finding
the end zone, as senior quarterback Justin
Vedder was sacked nine times by a suddenly
resurgent Cardinal pass rush, and Stanford
was able to hold on for a 10-3 victory.
The teams matched strength against
when the high-octane Stanford (3-8,
r2-6 Pacific 10 Conference) passing

attack faced the Pac-10's third-best defense,
and weakness against weakness when the
last-ranked Stanford defense took the field
against the last-ranked Cal (5-6,3-5) offense.
Who could have predicted that the teams
would combine for 13 points?
"Well, it's Big Game," said head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Something is always
different. Historically, in this rivalry, unex
pected things happen. To say [the defense's
performance] was outstanding would proba
bly be an understatement. They stepped up
big. Our defense's problem has been big
plays and today we were able to eliminate
long runs and only give up a few big pass
plays."
Early on, Stanford couldn't capitalize on
its own big pass play. On third-and-long of its
first possession, quarterback Todd Husak
found Emory Brock in the left flat on a swing
pass. Brock broke a tackle and rumbled 61
yards down the sideline to the Cal 25.
Stanford couldn't move the ball and
brought Keym Miller onto the field for a
short field fi&l. However,
M i ll e X J

missed the kick wide right, and would miss
another gimme early in the second quarter.
"Kevin just had one of those stretches
where he didn't execute his job as well as he
could have." Willingham said.
Meanwhile, Cal took a 3-0

lead into halftime cour
tesy of Ignacio
Brache's 33-yard

field goal.

Diedrick resorted to the quarterback
carousel that proved so effective against
ASU. The key play of the drive came on
third-and-one at the Cal 46-yard line, after
Brian Allen had recovered De√üonnie

long enough to hit Emory Brock wide open
in the flat. Brock turned upfield and scam
pered to the Cal seven-yard line for a 39-yard
gain, giving him the unusual receiving line of
two catches for exactly 100 yards and no
touchdowns. On the very next play, Husak
hit a diving Troy Walters on a quick slant un
derneath the Cal coverage to take a 7-3 lead,
