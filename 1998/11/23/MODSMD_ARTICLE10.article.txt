## Murder rate at 30-year low 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
nation's murder rate reached its
lowest level in 30 years as serious
crimes reported to police in 1997
declined for a sixth consecutive
year, the FBI said Sunday.
"These decreases are real and go
beyond a statistical blip." Attorney
General Janet Reno said. "But we
have not won the war on crime. We
cannot let up even one minute."
Final FBI figures for 1997
showed a 2 percent drop from the
year before in the number of major
crimes reported to more than
17.000 police agencies around the
nation. The 13.2 million total crimes
were 7 percent below the 1993 fig
ure.
The crime rate, which adjusts for
population growth, showed more
dramatic declines. Last year's rate
was 4.923 crimes per 100,(XX) resi
dents. down 3 percent from 1996, 10
percent below 1993 and 13 percent
lower than 1988. The murder rate
plunged 8.1 percent.
All violent crimes — murder,
rape, robbery and aggravated
assault — and all the far more
numerous property crimes — bur
glary, auto theft and larcenv
theft — dropped in both number
and rate.
The violent crime rate was down
4.0 percent to its lowest level since

1987. led by the 8.1 percent decline
for murder and a 7.8 drop for rob
bery. The aggravated assault rate
was down 2.3 percent, and the rape
rate declined 1.1 percent.
The decline in number of mur
ders to 18.209 was the highlight — 7
percent fewer than in 1996 and 26
percent below the 1993 figure. The
rate of 6.8 murders per H)O.(XX) res
idents was the lowest since 1967's
rate of 6.2.
"Overall things look a lot bet
ter." said James Alan Fox, dean of
the college of criminal justice at
Northeastern University. "But the
homicide figures are misleading
because not every group in the pop
ulation is at a 30-year low."
Teenage homicides declined 16
percent last year, the fourth straight
annual drop since they soared 169
percent between 1984 and 1993 on
the crack cocaine epidemic and the
guns drug gangs put in the hands of
teenagers.
But Fox noted that the teen
homicide rate remains higher than
10 years ago. "It's down now among
young black males, the very group
that had the largest increases in the
1980s." Fox said. "But the teen
population is rising, and the growth
projections, particularly among
blacks and Hispanics, show we will
have more teens at risk."
