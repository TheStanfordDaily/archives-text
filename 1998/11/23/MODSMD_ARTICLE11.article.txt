# Riots leave six dead in Indonesia

### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) â€” Mobs of Muslim youths set fire to
churches and attacked Christians on Sunday in an eruption of ethnic and
religious violence in the capital that killed six people.
Some victims were mutilated and one was paraded in the streets by his
killers. Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of tear gas
to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had burned four
churches and ransacked seven others.
The violence comes as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation and unem
ployment rates soar.
President B.J. Habibie is at the center of student protests over his plans
to change Indonesia's political system, which opponents say fall short of
introducing true democracy.
Riots broke out less than half a mile from the presidential palace Sun
day, a little more than a week after deadly clashes between students and
security personnel also triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died during
the earlier clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
Dozens were reported injured in the new clashes Sunday between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of Ambon.
Muslim residents said they retaliated after the Ambonese threw rocks at
a mosque and smashed windows.
In one attack, Muslim mobs broke into a Roman Catholic church where
a wedding was being held, shattering stained glass windows, chalices and a
statue of the Virgin Mary. Pews and Bibles were tossed onto a bonfire.
"We got out as quickly as we could," said the bride. Threewaty, 27. who
like many Indonesians goes by only one name. "We're still not married.
But we're safe."
In the street outside the church, several hundred Muslim youths sat in
the middle of a road and recited Islamic prayers. Some carried banners pro
claiming themselves members of the "Front to Defend Islam."
At least four churches were burned and seven ransacked, officials said,
adding that the damage toll could rise.
Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese as it raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants through
the vehicle's protective wire netting.
"Kill them," the rioters screamed.
Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart.
Dozens of stores, other buildings and cars were damaged or burned.

The military said Muslims also targeted ethnic Chinese after hearing
unsubstantiated rumors the minority group had paid for attacks on them.
Jakarta's central military commander, Lt. Col. Widodo, and a body
guard were stabbed and seriously injured in one brawl.
Local television stations reported that 10 people were arrested after
rival mobs attacked one another. Squads of soldiers protected several
churches as night fell and fired at looters.
About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim, making
it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However, religious tolerance is
enshrined in the national philosophy.
Muslim preachers tried to calm angry crowds by reading passages from
Islam's holy book, the Koran, over loud speakers as hundreds of followers
sat on a major road.
The violence was the latest sign that the military, under pressure over
human rights abuses, is increasingly hard-pressed to keep order in the city
of 11 million people.
More than 160 soldiers who fired shots at student protesters during last
week's riots have been punished for disobeying orders, and some face
courts-martial, said armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Maarif.
