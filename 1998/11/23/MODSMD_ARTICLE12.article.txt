# Case against Microsoft focuses on Java
## 
### 
SAN JOSE. Calif. (AP) —Java,
a technology that could dramatical
ly change the computer industry, is
at the heart of the antitrust case
against Microsoft.
According to the government,
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates set
out to kill Java, a versatile comput
er programming language, because
it threatens his Windows-only
vision of the world.
And in a separate case just last
week, Microsoft was ordered to
rewrite parts of Windows 98 that
contain an altered version of Java
that is incompatible with software
made by Microsoft's rivals.
"T he Java potential is huge,"
said Keith Rutledge, who works
with it at IBM's campus in
Greenville, S.C. "The necessary

pieces are in place."
Java's impact could be signifi
cant for a simple reason: its elec
tronic code is understood by all
types of computers — not just the
Windows systems found on most
PC's, but also the Apple Macintosh
and the powerfulj Unix worksta
tions. That makes creating new
products easier and cheaper.
Three years after Java's intro
duction. problems remain. It can be
arduously slow, much worse than
programs designed specifically for
Windows or the Macintosh. And
new Java versions are released just
when programmers get comfortable
with old ones.
But its use is growing. Whether
people know it or not, they may use
Java when they dial a cellular

phone, turn the key in a car ignition
or track down a package through
the Internet.
Java, the language, was launched
in 1995 by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
and one of its creators, James
Gosling, is expected to testify this
week fotTjrjie government
Microsoft.
The government says Gates once
warned that the combination of
Java and Netscape might make
Windows and other operating sys
tems so generic that consumers
would care more about low price
than brand name.
In the government's antitrust
trial — and in the private lawsuit by
Sun — Microsoft is accused of
developing a system that offers spe
cial advantages to Java program

mers but locks them in to using that
system. Programs written using the
Microsoft method rely on Windows
and can't be used on an Apple or
Unix computer.
Microsoft, for its part, contends
its contract with Sun allowed it to
change Java ,1,0 run better under
Windows.
When a federal judge in the com
panies' private lawsuit sided with
Sun last week and ordered
Microsoft to remove its changes,
Microsoft executives initially threat
ened to pull Java from Windows
altogether.
But Gates, in an interview with
The Associated Press this week,
said that Windows will soon use
Sun's version of Java to comply with
the order.
