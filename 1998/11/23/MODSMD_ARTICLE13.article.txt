# Babbitt warns of California water crisis

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-
California will face an ecological
crisis if environmentalists, farmers
and urban planners don't come up
with a water plan soon, says U.S.
Secretary of the Interior Bruce Bab
bitt.
If talks over water issues col
lapse. "we'll just stagger along and
everyone continues to quarrel,
there'll be an ecological crisis in the
Delta, fish runs crash toward extinc
tion, and at some point the Endan
gered Species Act comes into
play ... and you just start shutting
down water users," Babbitt said.

"That's the upside of the down
side. In the next drought, things will
really get nasty," he told the San
Francisco Examiner in an article
published Sunday.
That threat compels Babbitt to
fly out to California at least once a
week to talk about water.
In May, Babbitt assumed leader
ship of the CalFed Bay-Delta Pro
gram. a partnership of 14 state and
federal agencies initiated in 1995 to
come up with a water plan for the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and
San Francisco Bay.
The Bay-Delta water system is

home to 750 species of wildlife and
plants, state environmental officials
say. It is also the hub of the supply
that irrigates California's trillion
dollar agricultural economy and
provides water to two-thirds of Cal
ifornians.
Now, California has a once-in-a
generation chance to change a sys
tem that has produced half a centu
ry of contention, decimated fish
eries and trickling rivers, said Bab
bitt.
A next-to-final draft of a water
plan is expected by the end of the
year.

"It's one of those off moments in
which everybody has begun to see
that although they have veto power
to jam the system, and finally they
have come face to face with the fact
that we could all be ahead by
putting this consensus together,"
Babbitt said.
The battle lines in the water wars
are most sharply drawn between
farmers and environmentalists.
Farmers say they need more sur
face storage to guarantee a reliable
water supply, but environmentalists
say dams already have overbur
dened the state's ecosystems.
