# U.S. must decide its role in Mideast conflict
## The 						price of peace 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel
and the Palestinians are both asking
the United States to dig deep in its
pockets to help them strengthen
their claims in the West Bank, at a
price thai may exceed $1,(2 billion,
Israeli officials have hinted that
the pace of a West Bank pullback,
part of the U.S.-brokered peace
accord reached last month, may
depend in part on receiving money
that President Clinton promised to
sweeten the agreement.
Israel is expected to ask for $1.2
billion, officials said. Its finance
minister, Yaakov Neeman. left for
Washington. D.C., on Sunday to
request aid to fortify Jewish settle
ments and build roads that bypass
Palestinian towns — controversial
items that U.S. officials may resist.
Palestinians are lobbying for
$4(X) million to $500 million to build
a road network that will knit their
scattered villages and towns togeth
er and pave the way for statehood.
But they oppose the use of U.S. aid
to make Jewish settlers more secure
and Israel's confiscation of land to
build the roads.
For the United States, the
requests pose a dilemma of rising
expectations and conflicting politi
cal aims.
Moshe Fogel, spokesman for
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government, said the
purpose of the aid was to "minimize
potential friction" after the next

pullback — which will leave a
dozen Israeli settlements surround
ed by Palestinian-controlled lands.
"That would ... mean installing
the type of protective and security
devices that would , improve., the
local settlements' ability to deal
with potential threats," Fogel said.
Jewish settlers published a letter
Sunday calling on the Israeli gov
ernment to provide armored buses
for schoolchildren, build lookout
posts, construct helicopter landing
pads in all settlements and issue
military equipment for settlements,
including machine guns, tear gas
and rubber-coated bullets.
Palestinian officials said the
United States should not sanction
the confiscation of land or help the
settlers sink deeper roots into war
captured land the Palestinians want
for a future state.
"We hope that the Americans
will take into consideration that the
money they give is not going to
reinforce the Israeli and Jewish
presence in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip," said Mohammed Ish
tayeh. head of the Palestinian agen
cy that channels foreign aid to pro
jects.
Until now, the United States has
given Israel S3 billion a year in total
aid but negotiated a reduction of
the $1.2 billion a year in economic
aid over the next decade. U.S. aid to
the Palestinians averages about $70
million annuallv.
