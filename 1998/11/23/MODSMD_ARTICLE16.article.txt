First lady visits Haiti
PIGNON, Haiti (AP) —Hillary Rodham Clinton
visited U.S.-supported hospitals in Haiti Sunday, one
of the few encouraging signs in a country rescued by
the United States from dictatorship but not from
poverty.
Mrs. Clinton was winding up a tour of hurricane
ravaged Central American and Caribbean countries
where she promised more disaster relief. She left for
home later Sunday.
In Haiti, she announced the United States would
add another $2.1 million to a $12 million storm relief
package.
But she focused her visit on health care in Haiti, the
poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
Mrs. Clinton toured the Bienfaisance Hospital in
Pignon, a small northern farming town of 2(),(XX) peo
ple, and complimented the facilities.
"What you're doing is very important," she said.
Also enthusiastic about the program was farmer
Dereus Marcellus, who was among more than KM) res
idents who came to greet Mrs. Clinton.
Marcellus, 33, said his wife died several years ago

while giving birth to their seventh child, who also died.
"The hospital was going to teach us family planning. It
was too late," he said.
Forty percent of Haiti's S million people have no
access to health care and 75 percent have no access to
family planning services. One child in eight does not
live to the age of 5, the highest rate in the hemisphere.
Critics strongly objected when President Clinton
sent 2(),(XX) U.S. troops to Haiti in IW4 to end a mili
tary dictatorship and halt a flood of boat people into
Florida.
Four years later, hopes that the U.S. intervention
would bring a better life to the poverty-ridden nation
have dimmed. The government has been nearlv para
lyzed by a power struggle that some fear could bring a
return to dictatorship. Most foreign aid has been held
up because of the 18-month political stalemate and
foreign investors shun the country.
Nevertheless. Mrs. Clinton said there was hope for
Haiti.
Haiti is handicapped by "crushing poverty, high
illiteracy, inadequate health care, a high incidence of
domestic violence — (But) the problems that Haiti
faces are solvable," she said Saturday.
