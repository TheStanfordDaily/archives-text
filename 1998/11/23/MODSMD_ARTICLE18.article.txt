The 101 st Big Game results
are in: Stanford 10, Cal 3.
We're keeping the Axe.

THE CLASS OF '99 can now say that
it never saw Stanford lose a Big
Game. Saturday's game wasn't
exactly a fireworks display, but a 10-3 is still
convincing. Stanford outplayed California
steadily and no-one can say our team didn't
deserve the win.
As anyone who's ever been to one can

tell you. Big Game is more than just an ath
letic event. The fans in cardinal red who
packed the Stanford section at Memorial
Stadium Saturday got more out of their trip
across the Bay than 60 minutes of football
and a chance to visit some some excellent
music stores.
Stanford students are proudest on Big
Ciame day. When else do thousands of us
scream as loudly as we can to let the world
know "Hey, I go to Stanford!"? Normally,
we're more reticent, but on the day of Big
Game, we think of whatever it is that each
of us thinks is best about this school, and we
do anything and everything we can to let
the world know we're proud of it.
For most people at Big Game, what
they're proudest about and shouting loud
about probably isn't football.
Different people love different things
about Stanford, but whatever it is that
you're proud of, you get one day a year
when no-one will look at you strangely for
yelling loudly about how proud you are to
go to Stanford.
To some extent, even if we had lost, we'd
all still have the chance to be proud and let
it all out. Perhaps it seems strange to take
any of the pride we might derive from any
part of Stanford — our studies, our commu
nities, our activities — and stake it on the
outcome of a football game.
However, Stanford isn't just a vague col

lection of individual centers of activity, and
people here tend not to concentrate exclu
sively on any one thing, no matter how
good they may be at it. More than most
other universities, Stanford is a place that
people view as a whole, something that's
worth more even than the sum of some very
impressive parts.
We shouldn't only care about our indi
vidual corner or corners of Stanford, but
rather strive to have every part excel. Thus,
if someone claims humanities are weak at
Stanford, we don't say "that's true, but we
have great engineers." Instead, we can give
that person a long list of reasons why he's
completely wrong.
By the same token, if we have a football
game to win, we shouldn't say the result
doesn't matter because what really counts is
that we have a great medical school or even
a great basketball team. We should go out
and cheer for the football team because
they represent us and are involved with us
in a university we care about.
That's why we can look at the final score
on Saturday as something meaningful. Part
of our university, a group of our fellow stu
dents, was put to a difficult test in front of
70,(KK) people. Included in those thousands
were many of us, all feeling as psyched as
can be about our university. Stanford
passed that test, and we owe the football
team a large vote of thanks for coming
through for us.
We should also thank our fellow fans for
not showing their pride violently or offen
sively. Some degree of rough behavior is
inevitable at large, spirited athletic events.
But apart from Cal fans inexplicably decid
ing to tear up pieces from their own field
and throw them at Stanford fans, this year
didn't have the violence that has saddened
our last two victories.
What really counts shines through:
we've got the Axe for another year. Here's
hoping that that most celebrated piece of
hardware has a long and pleasant stay at
Stanford.
