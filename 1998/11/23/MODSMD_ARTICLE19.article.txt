## Going to 'Gety' some loving 
### 
"MARIN, UNDER THE
streetlight, dancing by her
self, is singing the same
song somewhere. I know.
Is waiting for a car to stop,
a star to fall, someone to
change her life.
— Sandra Cisneros,
"House on Mango Street"

It's all over; it's week seven and you
know I've already run out of material
because I'm addressing the topic of dat
ing at Stanford. Well, not really. I'm not
going to whine about a lack of on-campus
hotties. Instead, I'd like to focus on the
humorous and borderline-pathetic social
contexts we construct in an effort to break
out of our institutionalized asexuality.
These things started back in adolescence.
I'm hoping it's true that frequent failure
eventually leads to sure success.
When I was 16, one of my best friends
had a crush on my other best friend's neigh
bor. The relationship consisted of little
more than some in-class eye contact.
Crush's neighbor and I decided to remedy
the situation with a little social manipula
tion. I would drive to school and pick up
Crush's neighbor. We'd happen to see
Crush waiting for the bus, offer him a ride,
then pick up Crushing and take them both
to school. Logistics, unfortunately, often
maim the best of intentions.
Neither Crush's neighbor nor I had our
own car. My mom, who needed to use the
family car, suggested a compromise: She
could drive all of us to school! Not exactly
what I had in mind.
Fate, unfortunately, also maims the

greatest of intentions. Crush was sick that
day. He was nowhere to be seen as Crush's
neighbor, my mom — hiding under a blan
ket behind the back seat of the Bronco (she
volunteered. I swear, this way she could get
the car back once we got to school) — and I
drove around the block eight times.
Have we learned from our mistakes?
Moving on from the near-misses of adoles
cent love, our materials for social construc
tion have only become more sophisticated.
We spend lots of money on booze for frat
parties, strobe lights for gropey clubs in San
Francisco, outfits for screw-your-roommate
dances and Internet access for chat-room
identities. Behind the fanfare, these elabo
rately fabricated scenarios are just attempts
to connect with another human being. So
what do we want out of it? Somebody to
talk to? Somebody to kiss?
I had my research assistants collect data
at the mother of all arbitrary public displays
of affection. Full Moon On The Quad. My
assistants accosted kissers and asked them
to rate their experiences on a scale of one to
10. The mean score was a seven. (This does
not include the statistical error associated
with having the interviewer dressed in an
evening gown and a winter hat, followed by
a short guy with a beard and dreadlocks tak
ing notes.) Before my anthropologist was
able to assess motives, she was traumatized
by a 47-second face suck and had to turn
and-burn from the mash-and-dash.
The Japanese are on the leading edge of
coerced social interaction. The newly popu
lar "Love Gety" is a small plastic device
(available in either pink or blue) designed
to help people break the ice. The "Love
Gety" 's owner turns the device on, sets his

intent (i.e., just talk, be friends, go to a
karaoke bar) and the device will broadcast
a specific radio frequency signal. If a "Gety"
of the opposite sex is within proximity and
has the same intent, both devices will flash
and beep. The two parties may then
approach, having found an excuse to inter
act.
Why do we need to hide behind three
ounces of plastic, four LEDs, a micropro
cessor and a radio frequency transmitter to
make friends? When we already know hun
dreds of people, why are we so hung up on
meeting somebody instead of putting more
effort into the relationships we already
have?
I'm just afraid that once we get out of
school we won't have homework to cover
up the fact that we haven't made the effort
to develop our personal relationships. And
the solution to this problem isn't found in
somebody you lured in with your "Love
Gety." Chances are, you already know
plenty of people willing to check out a
karaoke bar with you.
Boyfriend, schmoyfriend; this is all about
attention. We're looking for people to vali
date us, care about us and help us change a
bike tire. Once we stop waiting for "some
thing to happen," we'll start appreciating
the something that is happening.

Rachel Mutton isn't waiting for"the one."
She's already got "the nine," her house
mates, who give her all the love, attention
and affection that she needs. Then again,
maybe she's jealous that Lauren Oster got
asked out by a stranger after she wrote her
"I hate men " column.
