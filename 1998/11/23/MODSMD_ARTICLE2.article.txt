Workers at Stanford Hospital and Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital voted on Thursday and
Friday to join the Service Employees Union Interna
tional Local 715 by a margin of 770-481. Out of 1,5(X1
workers eligible to vote, 1,251 cast their ballots.
UCSF-Stanford Health Care administrators were
disappointed with the outcome of the election, yet ex
pressed willingness to cooperate with their newly orga
nized employees.
"While we are disappointed by the outcome, we re
spect the right of our employees to be represented by a
union if they so desire," said Peter Van Etten, CEO of
USHC. "We have a history of working to develop con
structive relationships with unions that represent our
employees."
Van Etten's statement pleased union spokeswoman
Lisa Hubbard.
"We feel encouraged by Van Etten's comments â€”

they are constructive," she said.
The workers cannot officially unionize until seven
days have passed and the results can be certified, ac
cording to National Labor Relations Board rules. This
week-long grace period provides a window during
which the election results could be challenged.
Asked if he thought USHC would challenge the
election results, spokesman Mike Lassiter said, "I
wouldn't think so."
Now that the vote has gone through, the union will
begin helping employees craft the contents of their new
contract with USHC. Before they negotiate their first
contract, newly organized workers will elect coworkers
as stewards to represent them in negotiating commit
tees, and the union will train workers to address and re
solve workplace issues.
