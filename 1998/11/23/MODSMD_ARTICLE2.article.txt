# Workers vote to unionize
## By large majority, Hospital employees choose union 
### Marty Heard Contributing writer 
Workers at Stanford Hospital and Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital voted on Thursday and
Friday to join the Service Employees Union Interna
tional Local 715 by a margin of 770-481. Out of 1,5(X1
workers eligible to vote, 1,251 cast their ballots.
UCSF-Stanford Health Care administrators were
disappointed with the outcome of the election, yet ex
pressed willingness to cooperate with their newly orga
nized employees.
"While we are disappointed by the outcome, we re
spect the right of our employees to be represented by a
union if they so desire," said Peter Van Etten, CEO of
USHC. "We have a history of working to develop con
structive relationships with unions that represent our
employees."
Van Etten's statement pleased union spokeswoman
Lisa Hubbard.
"We feel encouraged by Van Etten's comments —

they are constructive," she said.
The workers cannot officially unionize until seven
days have passed and the results can be certified, ac
cording to National Labor Relations Board rules. This
week-long grace period provides a window during
which the election results could be challenged.
Asked if he thought USHC would challenge the
election results, spokesman Mike Lassiter said, "I
wouldn't think so."
Now that the vote has gone through, the union will
begin helping employees craft the contents of their new
contract with USHC. Before they negotiate their first
contract, newly organized workers will elect coworkers
as stewards to represent them in negotiating commit
tees, and the union will train workers to address and re
solve workplace issues.
Ecstatic maintenance and dietary food service work
ers, clerks, nurses' assistants, lab technicians and house
keepers celebrated their victory Friday afternoon with
beer, fries and burgers at the Oasis,
a Menlo Park restaurant popular
with students. They cheered and
clapped in unison as representatives
clad in Service Employees Union
International T-shirts shared their
joy.
"There was a change today," said
dietary services employee Jesus An
drade. "Everybody came together
[over the election]. It's more of a
family thing now."
Elisa Gutierrez, who works in
housekeeping, agreed. "I'm very,
very happy that we now have some
power," she said.
But one man, support services as
sistant Victor Jaimez, and his wife,
Becky, sat at a table slightly apart
from the others. Jaimez expressed
doubts about the move to unionize.
When asked if he had wholeheart
edly supported the effort, he said, "I
was off and on."

"I had a lot of objections, and
wanted to check on things for myself
instead of just listening to what both
sides said," Jaimez said.
Jaimez said that he has been
working for the hospital for 12 years,
yet seldom gets weekends off —
even though he only wants every
other weekend off.
"I want my weekends back,"
Jaimez said. "I'll be willing to pay
[unionj dues if we get our eight
hours back. Things had better
change, or I ain't paying dues," he
said.
A result of the merger of UCSF's
and Stanford's hospitals was that
workers' hours were reduced to
seven and a half hours per day from
eight hours a day, so workers had to
squeeze their work into less time for
less pay, they said.
Nurse's assistant Jesse Palafox,
who was otherwise pleased with the
initiative, agreed with Jaimez. "All
we want is our eight hours back," he
said.
Besides being happy to have a

collective voice, Frank Arredondo,
who has worked in housekeeping at
Stanford Hospital for five years, said
he hoped that unionization would
improve the payment and promo
tion systems.
"We all feel excited — for better
working conditions, wages and
more information," Arredondo
said. "In my opinion, the way wages
have been distributed has been bad.
And as far as promotions go, it was
all based on who knew who."
USHC declared that its workers
are paid more than in comparable
positions at unionized hospitals. On
average, Stanford nurses' assistants
earn $16 an hour. However, union
ized nurses' assistants at Kaiser
Medical Center in San Francisco
and Kaiser Hospital in San Rafael
make $13 an hour.
"These wage levels are set hospi
tal by hospital," Hubbard said. "No
worker who had joined a union
would ever negotiate a worse wage
than they started out with."
Service Employees Union In

ternational said that unionized
nurse aides, orderlies and atten
dants make up to 43.1 percent more
than non-unionized employees
throughout the industry.
Prior to the election, Stanford
nurses already belonged to a differ
ent union, and 1,1 (K) non-hospital
Stanford employees belonged to
the same service employees' union
that the hospital workers voted to
join.
The drive to unionize began just
over a year ago when Stanford and
UCSF merged. Revenues increased,
but so did the workload, according
to Linda Repetti, who has worked at
Stanford Hospitals for 20 years.
This past June hospital workers
circulated a petition on unioniza
tion.
Once a majority of the employ
ees had signed, they went through
the process of filing with the Nation
al Labor Relations Board to ask for
recognition.
The workers filed the petition
with the board on Aug. 23.
