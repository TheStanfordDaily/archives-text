Concept of service is skewed
It was misleading for Rachel Hutton to
suggest in her Nov. 16 column that "creating
diverse relations" and "seeing how the other
halt lives" are why community service pro
grams exist. The value of community service
programs must be measured primarily by
their assistance to underprivileged individu
als. The need for public service will remain,
even in a society with "perfectly diverse rela
tions" or in one that is wholly aware of the
hardships placed on the lower classes.
We must also avoid characterizing com
munity service programs as "one half' help
ing the "other half." Successful programs
recognize the need for volunteers from all
walks of life. People of privilege offer
resources such as time, money and prior edu
cation that are necessary for effective pro
grams. However, people of lesser privilege
often offer a better perspective on communi
ty needs, as well as a more diverse racial and
native language volunteer pool.
My hope is that future discussion of com
munity service issues might be mindful of
what actually constitutes our most effective

programs. The primary goals of these pro
grams must be first and foremost the assis
tance of individuals in need. Achieving such
goals requires replacing outdated notions of
community service as simply "seeing how the
other half lives."

Kaul denial is a mistake
It is with great concern that we learned
about the English Department's decision to
deny tenure to Asst. Prof. Suvir Kaul. As
doctoral students in the Program in Modern
Thought and Literature who have benefited
immensely from Suvir Raul's scholarship
and active presence on campus, and as stu
dents who were planning to work with him
and learn from him, we would like to register
our concern over the English Department's
decision and tenure policy.
Prof. Raul's courses on social and cultural
theory have been indispensable for MTL stu
dents, combining a critical attention to both
classical texts and new scholarship at the cen

ter of current debates. Prof. Kaul has been a
committed supporter of MTL students, and
in broader terms, of interdisciplinary study.
Prof. Kaul s dedication to innovative literary
studies has not only created space for MTL
students in the English Department but has
also contributed to debates and dialogues
within his own discipline.
We feel that the English Department
should serve as a vital base for the interdisci
plinary training of students in Modern
Thought and Literature. We are thus con
cerned with the department's reluctance to
recruit and tenure scholars who can con
tribute to our interests in post-colonial theo
ry and theories of nationalism, gender, race
and sexuality, as well as the intersections
among these areas. These issues are taken
seriously by most English departments in the
country and are central to critical debates
that have redrawn the boundaries of the dis
cipline. If Stanford's English Department
continues to neglect these areas of study
through its recruitment and tenure policies, it
runs the risk of losing its distinguished status.
Further, the English Department's consis
tent practice of not retaining junior faculty
makes it difficult for us, as graduate students.

both to plan our studies and to wholeheart
edly recommend the English Department as
a resource to incoming Modern Thought and
Literature students.
In short. Prof. Raul's contribution to a
creative and engaging intellectual life at
Stanford is immense. His loss will be regret
ted by us. This letter is supported by 14 other
students from the Program in Modern
Thought and Literature.

Capitalism is our best option
Friday's editorial notebook by Tienlon
Ho proved disappointing. While the exhorta
tion to actively campaign to improve the
world around you is without reproach, Ho's
condemnation of greedy companies for their
"irresponsible pursuit of gain" and her insin
uation that such activity is the root of all evil
is both sophomoric and simplistic.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
the honest pursuit of profit per se. Adam

Smith settled this matter over 200 years ago
by pointing out that free trades occur only
when both parties benefit. Hence, in a capi
talistic system, profits generated on the free
market by an entity are not made at the
expense of someone else — if one entity is
garnering profits, it's safe to say multiple
other entities are benefiting as well.
Does this mean capitalism is beyond
reproach? No, but compared to other eco
nomic systems, it's easily the best choice we
have (contrary to what Prof. Manley might
tell you). Chicago economist Robert Fogel
won a Nobel Prize for his work detailing that
economic growth was the main reason for
increased lifespans in the Western world — a
positive little side effect from the "irresponsi
ble pursuit of gain," wouldn't you say?
Even though free markets can increase
life spans and standards of living, I won't
hold my breath waiting for Stanford students
to rally to bring capitalism to Burma. Corpo
rations are an easy target, and slamming
them for all the problems in the world is a
heck of a lot easier than proposing solutions.
