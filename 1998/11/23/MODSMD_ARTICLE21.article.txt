LAST FRIDAY I attended mv final
Gaieties, and while the show enter
tained me. 1 don't think 1 could
endure another one. After four years, there
are only so many jokes about phalluses and
fraternities that a person can hear without
going into convulsions. At this point, if
you've seen one Weenie toked up. you've
seen 'em all.
This aversion to routine probably stems
from my relative seniority at this school.
After all, my inundation with the nuances of
Stanford tradition began at a time when most
current undergraduates were still worried
about whether they would be able to get to
their lockers between third-period AP Bio
and fourth-period PE. I listen to freshmen
talk about the strange phenomenon of "1-
Hum." and 1 feel a creak in my joints.
Indeed, if you want to point to age as the
limiting factor in responding favorably to
Gaieties, you need only look at the number
of, how should we say. elderly folk in the
audience. While the entire Stanford commu
nity rallies behind Big Game, there aren't
exactly bunches of graying professors hang
ing from the balconv screaming, "Cal can

suck on my federal grant!" if you know what
I mean. This is not to suggest that Gaieties'
humor is solely for the youthful and imma
ture: it's just that if they were to once again
hear about the Angry Guy who controls our
mail, they might go postal themselves.
1 mention all this in a sort of roundabout
way to remind us students, especially under
classmen. that what may seem new and won
drous and beautiful to some eyes is just so
much rehashing of the tried and true to oth
ers. 1 don't wish to rob the uninitiated of their
innocence; the very passing down of tradition
often necessitates the good-willed endurance
of cliches. But 1 would like to point out that
there always exist two populations on this
campus: the undergrads (and some graduate
students) whose time here is short, and
everyone else — the professors, administra
tors. staff and the never-ending doctoral stu
dents — who don't give the Big Sayonara
after four years.
This somewhat obvious but ultimately
very special distinction is occasionally lost,
especially when it comes to the demand for
"student input."
This sort of demand is currently being put

forth in my department, in which a respected
junior faculty member was not recommend
ed for tenure. A graduate student committee
has been Hinging e-mails back and forth
across my inbox, requesting that faculty lis
ten to their concerns and include them in
"the process." While this debate seems too
fresh to comment upon here (even though I
do think the decision was. well, wrong), it
might be the beginning of another Push for
Student Input, the likes of which have not
been seen since the era of Gupta and Sawis
lak.
Who? you might ask.
That's exactly my point.
You see. over the past two years Akhil
Gupta and Karen Sawislak were each denied
tenure and then, with the support of a huge
Push for Student Input, fought strenuously to
have this decision reversed. (Gupta was
eventually granted tenure in the Anthropol
ogy Department. Sawislak never did get
tenure in History.) During these battles, stu
dents held marches and vigils, solicited letters
and petitions, and insisted that their voices be
heard, loud and clear. I myself wrote this
paper's editorial on Gupta, urging faculty to

consider student concerns.
But now, once the tumult has settled, and
a majority of the student protesters graduat
ed. we can barely remember who these
"champions of tenure" actually were.
Of course, when I say "we," I am referring
to the undergraduate population. Ask a fac
ulty member about Gupta and Sawislak
(Prof. John Shoven comes to mind) and he or
she will probably be able to give you a
detailed account of the saga. Ask an under
graduate and he or she will probably tell you
they're the authors of the Econ 52 textbook.
In other words, undergraduates always
want their voices to be heard and counted —
after all, the University is supposedly here to
serve their needs — but they sometimes
seem to forget that they come and go from
Stanford, not unlike a glorified band of hotel
guests.
Undergraduates have all the passion and
good intentions in the world, but the one
thing they'll never have is institutional mem
ory, a.k.a.. What Happened Before Us. And
without that, students' roles in how the Uni
versity operates will continue to be limited.
Before you start composing your letter to

the editor, note that I said "limited," not
"nonexistent." Student protest will always be
valuable for two reasons. One, protest can
rouse our faculty from their often isolated
and habit-induced slumber, and two, protests
add a vital personal dimension to our own
education. Moreover, never protesting in col
lege will probably translate to never protest
ing outside of school — a most dangerous
indifference.
But to presume that students with two or
three or even four years' experience have the
authority of one who's spent the majority of
his or her adult life working here is plain silly.
We should understand the context and posi
tion of our protests; we jump into a debate
and a tradition that last long before and long
after we arrive. We would then know the
extent and impact of our protests.
After all, there are those who must con
sider the long-term consequences of our
often short-term and expedient demands,
and respecting those considerations is usual
ly as important as the requests themselves.
