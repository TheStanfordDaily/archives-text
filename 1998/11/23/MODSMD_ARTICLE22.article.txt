### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The time has finally come.
Alter an undefeated season. Stanford will face its final test this
morning at the NCAA National Cross Country Championships at
Rim Rock Farm in Lawrence. Kan.
With the No. 2 Cardinal set to face off against the nation's
linest, including No. 1 Arkansas, at 9:30 a.m.. today's meet
promises to he among the best national championship races I||
in recent history.
Stanford is the two-time defending national champion, hav
ing beaten out Arkansas for first in the two previous meets.
Last November. Stanford's harriers went out conservatively and
blitzed the second half of the Furman, N.C., course en route to a
53-56 upset of the Ra/orbacks in the closest team competition in

27 years.
I his year looks to be just as close, as the two

squads have shared the No. 1 ranking exclusive
ly throughout the year. The teams have not
faced each other on the trails since last a
year's meet. A
Today's field will also feature 29 other

teams which received bids for the meet either by placing
in the top two of their regions or by at-large selections.
The Pacific 10 Conference is well represented with Stan
ford and No. 3 Oregon, which received automatic bids, and at
large qualifiers No. 16 Arizona and No. 19 Washington State.

this a fierce and close battle."
Nevertheless, Arkansas and Stanford have
the firepower to make the most convincing

run for the national title.

seven-man squad may include any of the following runners: seniors Jason
Balkman. Brad and Brent I iauscr. C liris Lunustrom, and Jon Weldon. ju

freshmen Jamev Clifford and Gabe Jennings,

Balkman, the Mausers and Riley are returning Ail-Americans from last
year's meet, and Weldon has extensive big-meet experience.
Arkansas will fire back with 1500-meter national champion Seneca Lassiter, steeplechase champ Sean
Kaley and Michael Power, who finished third in the 5,000-meter last year, among others.
Lananna is confident that the Cardinal will race to potential over the 10-kilometer course.
"We have been preparing all season to perform well at the NC 'AA championships," Lananna said. "We will
concentrate our energy on racing our be'st race and worry less about what the other teams will do because that
is beyond our control."
"I think that it will be very important for us to stick with the approach that we have taken all season, which
