## CROSS COUNTRY NATIONALS Looking to bring back two NCAA Championships No.2 Stanford men look to stay on top 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The time has finally come.
Alter an undefeated season. Stanford will face its final test this
morning at the NCAA National Cross Country Championships at
Rim Rock Farm in Lawrence. Kan.
With the No. 2 Cardinal set to face off against the nation's
linest, including No. 1 Arkansas, at 9:30 a.m.. today's meet
promises to he among the best national championship races I||
in recent history.
Stanford is the two-time defending national champion, hav
ing beaten out Arkansas for first in the two previous meets.
Last November. Stanford's harriers went out conservatively and
blitzed the second half of the Furman, N.C., course en route to a
53-56 upset of the Ra/orbacks in the closest team competition in

27 years.
I his year looks to be just as close, as the two

squads have shared the No. 1 ranking exclusive
ly throughout the year. The teams have not
faced each other on the trails since last a
year's meet. A
Today's field will also feature 29 other

teams which received bids for the meet either by placing
in the top two of their regions or by at-large selections.
The Pacific 10 Conference is well represented with Stan
ford and No. 3 Oregon, which received automatic bids, and at
large qualifiers No. 16 Arizona and No. 19 Washington State.

MEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY

■ Today: No. 2 Stanford will
compete at the NCAA champi
onships in Lawrence. Kan.

"The NCAAs will be more than an
Arkansas-versus-Stanford match
up," head coach Vin Lananna said.
"Each of the top-ranked teams will make
this a fierce and close battle."
Nevertheless, Arkansas and Stanford have
the firepower to make the most convincing

run for the national title.
Line-ups are yet to be announced, but Lananna has indicated that the
seven-man squad may include any of the following runners: seniors Jason
Balkman. Brad and Brent I iauscr. C liris Lunustrom, and Jon Weldon. ju
nior Jake Maas. sophomores Jonathon Riley and Thomas Murley. and
freshmen Jamev Clifford and Gabe Jennings,

Balkman, the Mausers and Riley are returning Ail-Americans from last
year's meet, and Weldon has extensive big-meet experience.
Arkansas will fire back with 1500-meter national champion Seneca Lassiter, steeplechase champ Sean
Kaley and Michael Power, who finished third in the 5,000-meter last year, among others.
Lananna is confident that the Cardinal will race to potential over the 10-kilometer course.
"We have been preparing all season to perform well at the NC 'AA championships," Lananna said. "We will
concentrate our energy on racing our be'st race and worry less about what the other teams will do because that
is beyond our control."
"I think that it will be very important for us to stick with the approach that we have taken all season, which

is to put ourselves in a position
where each member of the team
competes well," Lananna said.
"Our athletes will need to re
main calm and composed through
out the entire race."
Oregon and fourth-ranked Col
orado will look to clean up after
Stanford and Arkansas, while Col
orado's Adam Goucher and But
ler's Julius Mwangi are heavily fa
vored in the individual competi
tion.
Others to watch in the individ
ual race include the Mausers. Ore
gon's Matthew Davis (fifth in
1996), Washington State's
Bernard Lagat (third in 1997) and
Arizona's Abdi Abdirahman (sev
enth in 1997).
Still, while the team race is like
ly to come down to Stanford and
Arkansas duking it out for the top
spot, every individual scorer will
make a difference in the final out
come.
Arkansas, which will try to pro
long its string of 20 straight top-10
finishes, has much pride on the
line, while if Stanford wins, it will
become only the fifth team to win
three straight national champi
onships in the meet's 60-year his
tory.
And though the Cardinal's ex
perience at the national meet is
undisputedlv excellent. Lananna is
hesitant to accept that any advan
tage is implied.
"All of the top teams are re
turning many athletes with NCAA
experience," said Lananna. "If we
have any edge at all. it is because of
the confidence that our athletes
have in each other's ability to per
form well when the gun goes off."
