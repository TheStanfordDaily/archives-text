Today, as the Stanford women's cross country
team gets on the line at Rim Rock Farm in Lawrence.
Kan., to take another crack at a national title, most spec
tators won't be expecting the sixth-ranked Cardinal to
win.

Despite having won the Pacific 10 Conference
W Championship bv a large margin, the team has shown
signs of vulnerability this season. Assistant coach Beth Al
ford-Sullivan agrees that her team is an
underdog.

"Going in as underdog is a fair statement for where
we're at this year," said Sullivan. "We have the talent and
the potential to get the job done, hut there are also some
really good teams out there."
Much of the doubt surrounding the team has come
from its lack of a consistent lineup. On a team that has at
least 10 runners who can compete on the national level,
there are only seven spots to fill at each meet. Add

in a few minor injuries and illnesses and what you
get is a different line-up for each meet.
While each lineup has been strong, it has
been difficult to judge just how good this team
* is. Losing to No. 1 BYU at the Stanford Invita
tion on ()ct. 3 without captain Mary Cobb in the

lineup planted a seed of doubt in the
media.
Yet, the next week at the pre-
National meet in Kansas, the women
were dominant, blowing away the com
petition whieh included current No. 3
, Arizona and No. 2 Villanova. At that
* time, Villanova was without last year's

individual national champion, Carrie Tollefson. but that did not justify an 87-

point gap.
The next big event for the Cardinal was the Pae-l()s where, the team
was again dominant. While the top three of Julia Stamps, Sallv Glynn and
Mary Cobb guided the team to victory as they so often do. the bottom of
the lineup really shined that day. Both Courtney Adams and Mary Huang
stepped up into the top five, displacing freshmen (Proline Annis and Ma-

lindi Elmore.
But then, all of a sudden, ihe team dropped from second to sixth in the coaches' poll. This drop's main cause was
the women's less-than-impressive performance at the Western Regional qualifier where they were beat out by Ari
zona.
Sullivan points out that the team's only aim at the meet was to qualify, and that winning wasn't the objective. This
certainly seems logical, considering that last year's victory did not guarantee anything at the national meet — the
team was edged by BYU and lost the national title it had earned in 14%.
Still, one must ask why did the Stanford men run so outstanding at the regional meet, being in essentially the same
situation?
Sullivan's response to this is again
very reasonable. She points out that
the men's 10-kilometer is completely
different from the women's S,(XK).
"When you're looking at a SK, it
comes down to the final stretch, it
comes down to who out-leans who in
a field of that quality," said Sullivan.
"Six teams out of our region got

into the NCAAs. We didn't lay it on
the line, we didn't have an emotional
peak lor that weekend."
Now the team has to go out and
prove its worth. Expect Stamps, com
ing oil an outstanding performance
;it the regional meet, to compete
head-to-head with Tollefson of Vil
lanova and l ( )% champion Amy
Skieres/ ol Arizona. Stamps was
fourth at the meet last year, (ilvnn
will look to keep contact with the lead
pack and earn herself a second
straight All-American award.

While the team's fourth and fifth
runners will ultimately decide what
place the team finishes, the No. 3 run
ner all season will have to perform
well for there to be a chance at victo
ry. Cobb, the team captain, has been
Ail-American in all three of her
years. Yet the difference between her
freshman year, when she was fifth,
and last year, when she was 22nd,
may be the x-factor.
The last two scoring spots on the
team are up for grabs. Adams,
Huang, Elmore and Annis, as well as

freshmen Laura Turner and Colleen
Flaherty will be the ones to fill them,
but the starting seven won't be
known much before the 10:30 a.m.
start.
Sullivan has set high goals for her
team, but does not demand victory.
"I think that we have our work cut
for us aiming for a top victory but also
just getting in there and running as
best as we can." Sullivan said. "It will
be a successful day with Stanford on
the victory stand in one of those four
spots."
