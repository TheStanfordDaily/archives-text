Today, as the Stanford women's cross country
team gets on the line at Rim Rock Farm in Lawrence.
Kan., to take another crack at a national title, most spec
tators won't be expecting the sixth-ranked Cardinal to
win.

Despite having won the Pacific 10 Conference
W Championship bv a large margin, the team has shown
signs of vulnerability this season. Assistant coach Beth Al
ford-Sullivan agrees that her team is an
underdog.

"Going in as underdog is a fair statement for where
we're at this year," said Sullivan. "We have the talent and
the potential to get the job done, hut there are also some
really good teams out there."
Much of the doubt surrounding the team has come
from its lack of a consistent lineup. On a team that has at
least 10 runners who can compete on the national level,
there are only seven spots to fill at each meet. Add

in a few minor injuries and illnesses and what you
get is a different line-up for each meet.
While each lineup has been strong, it has
been difficult to judge just how good this team
* is. Losing to No. 1 BYU at the Stanford Invita

Yet, the next week at the pre-
National meet in Kansas, the women
were dominant, blowing away the com

Mary Cobb guided the team to victory as they so often do. the bottom of
the lineup really shined that day. Both Courtney Adams and Mary Huang
stepped up into the top five, displacing freshmen (Proline Annis and Ma-

lindi Elmore.
But then, all of a sudden, ihe team dropped from second to sixth in the coaches' poll. This drop's main cause was
the women's less-than-impressive performance at the Western Regional qualifier where they were beat out by Ari
zona.
Sullivan points out that the team's only aim at the meet was to qualify, and that winning wasn't the objective. This
certainly seems logical, considering that last year's victory did not guarantee anything at the national meet — the
team was edged by BYU and lost the national title it had earned in 14%.
Still, one must ask why did the Stanford men run so outstanding at the regional meet, being in essentially the same
