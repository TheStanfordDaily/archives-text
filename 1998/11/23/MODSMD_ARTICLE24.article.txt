# Stanford stuns No.1 Purdue
## Unranked Cardinal edges past top-ranked team, 73-72 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
You know you're doing something
right when your fans are on their feet,
screaming their lungs out during every
single timeout.
Yesterday, with the help of its boister
ous supporters, the Stanford women's
basketball team (1-3) quieted its critics as
it upset the top-ranked Purdue Boiler
makers (2-1) 73-72, yesterday at Maples
Pavilion.
Purdue had moved up to No. 1 after it
snapped Tennessee's 4b-game winning
streak last Sunday.
"I'm really proud of our team's effort,"
said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
"We came out and worked very hard
for 40 minutes and took shots exactly
when we needed to. This is a great win for
our team."
The upset comes at a much-needed
time as the Cardinal lost its first three
games, all against top-25 teams, and was
struggling emotionally and technically.
Yesterday, things finally began to gel.
Stanford led the entire game — at one
point even stretching the margin to as
wide as 13 points.
But after Boilermaker point guard
Ukari Figgs sunk four free throws, the
score was tied at 72 with 18 seconds to
play.
Junior guard Milena Flores broke the
Boilermaker press and found senior
Regan Freuen wide open under the bas
ket. Freuen went up, but her lay-in
bounced off the rim. After a scramble in
the paint between Freuen and Purdue's
Katie Douglas, a foul was called on Dou
glas.
With one second on the clock. Freuen
went to the line and made her first shot

but bricked the second.
It didn't matter: Stanford had won.
"Last week Purdue did what they
needed to do against Tennessee and this
week we did what we needed to do against
Purdue," said VanDerveer.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: Stanford (I-3)73,N0. 1 Purdue
(2-1)72.

Stanford shot 52 percent from the field
— a huge increase from its previous games
when it averaged 33 percent. The ('ardinal
outrebounded the Boilermakers 32-24
and was four for nine from outside the cir
cle.
"I think any time an unranked team
beats the top-ranked team in the nation
it's going to be a high point." said junior
guard Christina Batastini.
Best of all. the win was a team effort
and all nine players who got playing time
contributed.
There was the freshman contribution
of Lindsey Yamasaki. who finished with a
career-high 18 points, nine rebounds. Ya
masaki is shaping up to be one of Stan
ford's most versatile players.
Yamasaki hit a crucial three-pointer to
quell a Boilermaker comeback in the first
half and moments later dazzled the crowd
with a drive to the basket and reverse lay
up.
"I think Lindsey had a great game,"
said VanDerveer. "I think she really
showed people her abilities, her skills and
her poise."
The class of 2001 didn't look too shab
by and Sara Dimson was all over the place,
adding six points and seven boards.
Carloyn Moos once again dominated
the inside with 16 points and three re
bounds.

Ihe juniors controlled the backcourt
and did a great job of shutting down Pur
due guards Figgs, Kelly komara and
Stephanie White-MeCarty.
Batastini had a career-high 14 points
and was unstoppable driving to the bas
ket.
Milena Flores. who didn't start either
of the halves, did a good job (if breaking
Purdue's press.
Flores only had three points but it was
her pass to Freuen that clinched the Stan
lord win.
And.finally, there was the senior addi
tion. Freuen was on lire the entire game,
shooting 50 percent from the field and
adding 10 points in only 25 minutes of
play.
"Each game is ;i learning experience,"
said Purdue head coach Carolyn Peck.
"We'd rather learn from the win but
sometimes you learn a lot better from the
loss.
I he Boilermakers struggled the entire
game. They shot only 35 percent from the
field and got into foul trouble early.
White-McCarty led Purdue with 24
points.
Sunday's game proved how precarious
the season and rankings arc shaping up to
be.
"In all of our success at Stanford, we've
only been ranked No. 1 during the season
for one week." said VanDerveer. "We've
won national championships, we've been
No. 1 seeds. It's hard to be No. 1. Purdue
deserves a lot of credit."
Perhaps, the win will boost Stanford's
confidence and springboard a Cardinal
winning-streak.
"This was a huge win for our team,"
said Freuen. "We've been trying to come
together. Today we knew we needed to
come out with urgency and get back on
track."
