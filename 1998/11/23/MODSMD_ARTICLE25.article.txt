### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Incredible.
A goal in the ninth second of the game. A
goal on penalty kick. Two goals called off. One
goal that barely crossed the goal line. Seven
yellow cards. Two red cards. Fifty fouls.
And the match was decided in triple over
time on an own goal.
Saturday night at New Maloney Field, over
1,500 soccer fans witnessed an unbelievable

display of intensity, skill, endurance, heart and
desire in a match that often seemed surreal.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Saturday: No. 9 Stanford (15-4-2) 3, San Jose
State (14-6-1) 2 (3QT).

"Everyone was treated to something pretty
special, pretty rare," said San Jose State head
coach Gary St. Clair. "I think we were all pret
ty fortunate to see what we saw."

The show was provided compliments of the
Stanford (15-4-2) and San Jose State (14-6-1)
men's soccer teams in the first round of the
1998 NCAA Division 1 tournament. Stan
ford's 3-2 victory launches the Cardinal into
the Sweet 16, while it sends the heartbroken
Spartans home for the year.
The game was decided in the third overtime
period. Unlike the previous two 15-minute
overtimes, this overtime was sudden-death.
Stanford dominated the overtime periods,
outshooting San Jose 7-0, but was unable to
convert its chances into a goal until the 125 th
minute.
Senior midfielder Shan Gaw blasted a cross
into the box that was intended for senior mid
fielder Aaron Jones. Spartan senior defender
Todd Duncan got his leg on the ball first. In an
attempt to divert it and create a corner kick,
Duncan scored what is known as an "own
goal," sending the ball into the goal to end the
game.
And although it was not a Stanford player
who put in the goal, the Cardinal's constant
pressure led to the victory.
"For us it was a case of trying to do what
we've done all year — be disciplined. Eventu
ally we put them under enough pressure to
concede the goal," said senior midfielder
Simon Elliott.
It was apparent from the kickoff that this
was not to be an ordinary game.
The Spartans took the kickoff and used
three perfectly executed passes to find forward
Chad Harper open in front of the goal. Harper
used one maneuver to evade Stanford redshirt
sophomore goalie Adam Zapala, and sent the
ball into the goal. Nine seconds into the game,
the Spartans had a 1-0 lead.
Stanford, however, did not let this deter it
from its game plan.
"I thought we did well after [the early goal.]
We didn't panic and kept our composure,"
said Stanford head coach Bobby Clark. "It is
tough to lose an early goal, but the only good
thing is that you've got 89 minutes to get it
back."
The Cardinal, however, needed 11 minutes
to retaliate.
Elliott, who along with Gaw guided the
team all game, put Stanford on the board. Ju

nior midfielder / defender Gerard Davis start
ed the play by bringing the ball up the right side
and sent a perfect cross into the box, where El
liott headed the ball in to tie the score. The goal
was Elliott's sixth of the season and the assist
was Davis' second.
Early in the second half. Spartan star for
ward Eduaruo Martinez received his second
yellow card of the game for arguing, causing
his ejection. This gave the Cardinal a one-man
advantage.
Stanford capitalized on the advantage in
the 76th minute, as freshman defender Lee
Morrison scored the biggest goal of his young
career, putting Stanford up 2-1. Gaw struck a
corner kick to the far post where Morrison
leapt above the crowd and headed the ball in
for the goal, his fourth of the season. The ball
crossed the goal line before it was sent out of
the area, but the official ruled that the ball had
in fact crossed the line and stood as a goal.
The Cardinal gained a two-man advantage
late in the second half as the Spartans were
dealt a second red card. The Cardinal played
the subsequent 40 minutes with this two-man
advantage.
The nine-on-11 situation forced the Spar
tans to sit back on defense and hope for a tran
sitional ball or a free kick to create offense.
This, however, made it difficult for Stan
ford to play its style of soccer as the Spartans
didn't provide much offensive pressure.
"We are a counter-attacking team and that
part of our game was taken away from us,"
Bobby Clark said. "We had to show patience
and I thought we did, by and large."
Up 2-1 with under three minutes left to play
in the second half, the situation looked promis
ing for the Cardinal.
The Spartans, however, would not give up.
San Jose sent a ball into Stanford's box,
which Zapala challenged in traffic and
punched out of the area. During the crowded
play the Cardinal was charged with a foul in
side the box and the Spartans were awarded a
penalty kick.
Spartan senior Brandon Snyder took the
kick for San Jose. Zapala nearly made the
save, tipping the ball up off the crossbar, but
