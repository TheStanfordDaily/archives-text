# They're making history
## Card's squad is one for the books 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
After 1,012 games, 12 coaches,
87 seasons, 1,584 players and 88
years, the Stanford men's soccer
team made it past the first round of
the NCAA tournament for the
first time with a win on Saturday
night against San Jose State, 3-2.
The win has been a long time
coming, which makes it sweeter.
"Every team [needs] to make
their own history. It is great for
these lads," said head coach Bobby
Clark. Tonight "they made a little
bit of history.."
Only five other teams in Stan
ford history have advanced to the
tournament at all.
In 1962 and 1978, Stanford
qualified for the tournament but
exited in the first round. More re
cently, in 1991 the team, under
head coach Colin Lindores, ad
vanced to the tournament but was
knocked out by eventual champi
ons San Francisco. The team qual
ified the next year but again lost,
this time to the University of San
Diego, the team Stanford will face
in the second round this season.
Last year, the Cardinal was very
close and almost advanced to the
second round but was left in a sim
ilar position as San Jose State was
last Saturday.
Stanford played Washington in
last season's first round, in a close
game, but then fell to the Huskies,
in two overtimes, 2-1.
"It is never easy to lose in the
tournament because, unless you go
all the way, you are always going to
be disappointed," Clark said.
This season, Stanford tied for
fourth in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and expectations for the
postseason were high. Because of last
year's strong finish and a strong
group of seven seniors, the pressure
was on for this year's team to be the
team that would finally make Stan
ford history.
And that's exactly what it did.
Adding to the sense of urgency
were the seven seniors, five of whom
are starters and all of whom wanted
to make their final Stanford season as
long as possible.
Of those seven, four players have
been around since they were fresh
men, when the team went 5-12 and
finished seventh in the MPSF. Those
players have experienced the bot
tom, and now for the first time have
their chance to make their way to the
top.
"For the guys who have been here

four years and seen the turnaround of
the program, for them it has been a re
ally special time," said senior Simon
Elliott. "They see the opportunities
and the possibilities of going deeper
into the tournament. Particularly for
those guys it is a real special time."
Saturday's win is an indicator as to
how far the program has come in the
past three years under the tutelage of
Clark, but the history books don't
have to be shut after Saturday. The
team can break another record — the
most wins in a single season.
Currently, the team has 15 victo
ries and in order to break the record,
they must win more than 16.
Clark and the players — especial
ly the seniors — wouldn't mind if
Stanford kept breaking records this
season, perhaps leading them to a na
tional championship.
"I think you just got to keep mak
ing history. Every team wants to
make its own history," said Clark.
"They could keep going to 19 [wins]
if they want. Why stop them?"
