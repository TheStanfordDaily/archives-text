■ Saturday: Big Splash — No. 3
Stanford (17-6) 11, California (11-
10) 6.

Stanford got out to a 2-0 lead
after the first quarter and Cal an
swered back with two of its own
goals in the second period ol play.
But with five seconds left on the
clock. Stanford was awarded a
four-meter penalty shot. Senior
Layne Beaubien made the shot to
take back the lead and end the half
at 3-2.
In the third quarter, the Cardi
nal offense took control and
outscored Cal 4-2 to give Stanford a
7-4 lead heading into the last period
of play. Once again, Stanford
outscored Cal 4-2 and came away
with a rousing 11-6 victory.
"That was the last Big Splash for
the seniors," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "It was a
really good game all around."
"I'm very happy for the seniors
that their final Big [Splash] was a
dominating one," said assistant
coach Ben Quittner.
Beaubien, second on the team in
scoring with 35 points, and senior
Arturo Rodelo. third on the team
with 30 points, lead the Cardinal of
fense with three goals apiece.
David Hay. who currently has 19
points on the season, contributed
two goals. Juniors Brian Heifferon
and Jonathan Skaalen and sopho
more Todd Snider each scored
once.

On defense, Chris Aguilera
played a stellar game in the cage.
"Chris made some beautiful
saves," Dettamanti said. "With
[Chris] playing so well, [the Cal
players] were cutting it a little thin
on their shots. They were still
shooting, but they were trying to fi
nesse their shots."
The Cardinal defense rose to the
challenge and held the Bears man
up conversions to two goals out of
nine opportunities. Cal scored two
more of its goals on four-meter
penalty shots. Only two of the
Bears' points came from natural
goals.
"Stopping their six-on-five was
the main thing," Dettamanti said.
"And that was the result of both
Aguilera and our field defense."
Because the seeding for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion tournament has already been
decided, the Big Splash game didn't
effect either team's standings.
"Cal looked tired." Dettamanti
said. "I don't think they've started
resting yet. Both teams are looking
ahead to the Mountain Pacific. I
don't know how important this
game was for either team."
Based on the season's record,
Stanford is seeded fourth, while Cal
is seeded fifth. Saturday's game was
just a warmup for the really impor
tant match between the rival
squads, as they will meet again on
Friday in the first round of the
league tournament.
Now that the last regular game
of the season is over. Stanford has
begun to taper in preparation for
next weekend's tournament in
Newport Beach.
"Now maybe we can rest so we
can come out firing again [next
week]," Ouittner said.
If Stanford defeats Cal in the
first round, it will have to go up
against top-ranked USC in the
semifinal match in order to make it
into the championship game.
"This is the time when our team
traditionally peaks," Beaubien
said. "We're physically ready, so
it's all in our heads. We'll have
three tough games [at the MPSF
tournament], so if we win. we'll
know we really earned it."
