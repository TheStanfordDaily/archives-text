# Not a great L.A. story
## No.4 Stanford falls to Trojans 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
Every team is allowed to have a
letdown.
And for the first time all season,
that is exactly what happened to the
Stanford women's volleyball team.
After securing its fifth-consecu
tive Pacific 10 Conference crown
with a thrilling five-game win over
UCLA on Friday, a visibly exhaust
ed Stanford team (24-3, 17-1 Pac-10)
suffered its first conference loss yes
terday against USC (21-4,16-2).
The Women of Troy avenged an
early-season loss at Maples Pavilion
with a convincing four-game victory
(13-15. 15-7, 15-4,15-4), spoiling the
Cardinal's undefeated conference
record and defeating their Pac-10
rival for the first time since 1993.
Senior outside hitter Jennifer
Kessy and senior middle blocker
Jasmina Marinkovic both posted 23
kills in yesterday's match, leading a
consistently potent offense that
snapped Stanford's 44-match Pac
-10 winning streak.
For the Cardinal, junior outside
hitter Kerri Walsh had another huge
afternoon, finishing with 22 kills,
nine digs and four blocks. Sopho
more middle blocker Jennifer Det
mer added 14 kills on just 24 at
tempts, while freshman Sara San
drik chipped in eight kills and a pair
of blocks.
The bottom line at match's end
was Stanford's inability to deal with
the powerful USC offense. Surpris
ingly, the Women of Troy out
blocked the Pac-10-leading Cardi
nal. 9-8.
"We just didn't have it today,"
Stanford head coach Don Shaw
said. "SC played very well today. It
was clear that it meant a lot more to
them. We were not at our best out
there and it showed. We simply
couldn't stop their offense all match
long. We were a step behind, and we
couldn't afford to do that against a
very talented team like USC."
Although the USC loss is natu
rally disappointing for the Cardinal,
the pleasing reality is that the week
end was a success, in that the team
accomplished its primary goal: win

ning the Pac-10.
"We came down here to win the
Pac-10 and we did that," Shaw said
after the USC match. "I was very
pleased with the way we responded
in the UCLA match, turning it on in
the end. We did what we had to do in
game five."
In Friday's match against the
Bruins, an epic five-game battle that
featured infinite lead changes and
momentum swings, Stanford simply
found a way to get it done in crunch
time.
Down two games to one, UCLA
(14-11.13-5) responded with a gutsy
15-10 victory in the fourth game, set
ting up crunch time.

■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 16
UCLA (14-11.13-5). 15-10,7-15,15-
5,10-15,15-10.

The Cardinal quickly snatched
the momentum in the tense fifth
game, scoring the first six points in a
rally-scoring system and essentially
closing the door on the Bruins. Al
though UCLA did claw back to
make the score 10-14, Walsh dashed
any hopes of a victory with her 25th
kill on match point.
"We played well against
UCLA," Shaw said. "They are a
very dangerous team, and 1
wouldn't want to face them in the
[NCAA] tournament. We were for
tunate enough to play well enough
to win at the end of the match."
Stanford was propelled to victory
by Walsh's 25 kills, 12 digs and seven
blocks. Detmer added 13 kills and
six blocks, while freshman Sara San
drik had 11 kills and five blocks.
UCLA had a balanced scoring
effort as well, led by freshman out
side hitter Kristee Porter's 30 kills,
the phenom's third 30-plus-kill
match of the season. Freshman Ash
ley Bowles, last week's Pac-10 Play
er of the Week, added 23 kills and 12

Memories of a Pac-10 season that
was so close to perfect will accompa

the Farm.
And while it would he only natur
al to focus on the hitter memory of a
loss to USC. it is imperative for this
young Cardinal team to recognize
the overall success of the season to
this point.
"We learned that there are a lot
of aood teams out there, and we are

just one of them," Shaw said.
"We won the Pac-10, and that is
an accomplishment in itself. We
know that we will have to play at the
top of our game in every match. It
