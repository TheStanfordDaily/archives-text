# Loving remodel gives Bridge new look
## 
### Kiffen Hsieh Contributing writer 
The shabby exterior of a thread
bare green and white building sticks
out among the immaculately painted
houses on Salvatierra Walk, but ap
pearances are deceiving.
Tucked away inside the house is
the Bridge, a 24-hour peer counseling
center, and it tells a different story.
Thanks to extensive remodeling
done by the four live-in students over
two weeks this past summer, the
Bridge over Stanford's troubled
water is now a more pleasant one to
cross.
The Bridge is a general counseling
center for the University, offering
workshops on massage, relation
ships, and relaxation. It is a meeting
place for support groups such as
those for depression and eating disor
ders.
The center's 35 student volunteers
keep the house open for drop-in
counseling seven days a week, from 9
a.m. to midnight. The phone line (3-
3392) is always open, with a live-in
counselor answering the phone when
the center is closed. During winter
'quarter last year, the Bridge received
152 phone calls.
Repairs have been a priority of
Bridge members ever since damage
from the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake resulted in an advisory against
using the second floor of the building
two years ago. More recently though,
the University has been concerned
about the structural integrity of the
entire building. The University
checks the building annually to en

sure that it is still safe, said senior
Adrienne Watt. Bridge university re
lations coordinator.
Dean of Students Marc Wais con
sidered moving the Bridge toTresid
der Union, but members felt that this
would have made it difficult to main
tain the confidentiality of live-in
counselor service, since Tresidder is
located in the busy center of campus.
For the time being, students remain
on the first floor of the house, which
has been determined to be safe to live
in.
Wais visited the center during its
open house for administration mem
bers on Thursday Nov. 12.
"You guys are ready to become
subcontractors now," he said.
Alluding to the popular television
host, he said, "I feel like I'm speaking
with two Bob Vila's."
The University has decided not to
conduct a wholesale renovation of
the building, due to its age and condi
tion, according to Watt. The future
location of the center is still in infor
mal negotiations, she said.
For the present, the live-ins chose
to save on labor costs and do the pro
ject as economically as possible as
they have been nervous that they will
lose their house in the future, accord
ing to counselor Amanda Lam.
"Having a large amount of money
in the bank that we can use in case of
emergencies or any unforeseen crises
that may come up is really important
to our organization," she said.
The renovations cost nearly
$2.(XX) and came entirely out of the
center's annual operating budget of
about $25.(XX), which it raises through

the Spring Faire held in White Plaza
each Mother's Day weekend. The
Bridge has elected to be a self-suffi
cient organization, and not request
annual funding from the University.
"We wanted to show that we care
a lot about the Bridge," said senior
Jill Bangser, who coordinates univer
sity relations for the center. "There
were physical changes that needed to
be done, and the students put in their
time to make this a more comfortable
place for people to visit."
The Bridge was started in 1971 by
a group of Stanford students inspired
by the song. "Bridge Over Troubled
Water," by Paul Simon and Art Gar
funkel. Members used the open
house as a way to reintroduce the
center to the Stanford community.
A major goal is to let people know
who the counselors are and what
types of services they offer, according
to Watt.
"We're not trying to pass our
selves off as trained therapists," said
Watt. "We provide active listening to
help people develop their own solu
tions. There is no chance of inade
quate referral or improper counsel
ing because we are trained to give re
ferrals if something is out of our
hands."
But Watt said that remodeling the
house for its aesthetic value was also
important.
"The house was getting kind of
dingy," she said. "This is really a place
for people to visit, so it's very impor
tant that it looks nice."
She said the changes have also im
proved the community spirit of the
staffers.

On a tour of the restored ground
floor, live-in counselor Suzannah
Tipermas, a junior, pointed to a
kitchen cabinet that had been
cleaned. "1 thought that the knobs
were (painted) black, but it turns out
they're wood," she said.
A "before" photo of a bathroom
shows a wooden floor so rotted that a
person could have fallen through.
The wood has been replaced and cov
ered with linoleum.
The counselors relied heavily on
Kevin Bartalino. a high schtxil friend
of Bridge live-in counselor Tai Lock
speiser, a sophomore.
Bartalino. who works in Denver,
taught the staffers how to make the
necessary repairs and helped do
some work himself.
Other renovations included re
flooring the kitchen, repainting, and
fixing up holes and cracks in many of
the walls, including one area where
rays of light from outside could some
times be seen.
But the remodelers added their
personal touches to the place too.
"Towards the end we had some
extra time, so we decided to have
some fun," said Lockspeiser.
For the four female live-ins this
year, this amounts to having flowers
and scenes from Winnie the Pooh
painted on bedroom walls and cabi
net doors.
"1 feel like I'm in the Haight,"
Wais said on his tour.
And if there's a male live-in coun
selor next year?
"There's always more paint,"
Lockspeiser said. "We know where
the hardware store is."
