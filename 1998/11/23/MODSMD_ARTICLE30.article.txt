# Card crushes SMS, off to NIT semifinals
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
The crowd in Maples Pavilion
decided to start spreading the news
midway through the second half of
Friday's second-round game of the
Chase National Invitational Tour
nament, when it began chanting
"New York City"
The ESPN banners were flying
high and a buzz of excitement was in
the air.
This Thanksgiving, New York
will be home to more than just the
Maey's Parade.
With the No. 3 Cardinal's 76-51
romp against the Southwest Mis
souri State Bears (2-1), Stanford (3-
0) advanced to the semifinals of the
NIT, earning a trip to Madison

Square Garden.
While there were definitely some
speetaeular performances, includ
ing that of Cardinal guard Arthur
Lee, who contributed 17 points in
just 23 minutes and went five for
seven from behind the three-point
line, the depth of the Stanford squad
was by far the most impressive as
pect of the game.
"I can sense we are starting to
play a little better as a team," said
Stanford junior forward Mark Mad
sen. who added 11 points and nine
rebounds for the Cardinal. ' Having
such good players come off the
bench allows us to keep the intensi
ty. I've been fresh this whole year
because we have such depth. And
when you're fresh, you can play
great."

Intense defensive play helped
create multiple opportunities for
Stanford, as it was able to come up
with 13 steals and force the Bears to
turn the ball over 20 times.

"I think the fact that we were
working so hard on defense caused
the ball to get [knocked down] on
the floor a lot," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "I think
the attitude right now is great."
With no member of Stanford's
team playing more than 23 minutes
of the game, and all going full force,
it didn't take long to wear down an
already tired SMS basketball squad.
"They're an extremely talented
team," said Bears head coach Steve
Alford. "This is the best team I've
ever faced. We could have played
this team 10 times and not beat
them."
Perhaps what helped stun SMS
was the fact that the Cardinal con
tinuously substituted one big man
for another, while the Bears were
forced to rely on senior center
Danny Moore down low.
"Having five guys that constantly
rotate in and are fresh," Madsen
added, "I think that wears down
their big guy."
While Moore had 18 points for
the Bears, it was clear that he was
not in for the easiest night of his ca

reer from the get-go.
Along with Madsen, redshirt
freshman Jason Collins stepped up
for Stanford down low, hitting four
of five shots from the field and fin
ishing with nine points on the night.
"He's strong inside," Mont
gomery said. "When he gets it in
side, he makes very economical
moves. It's nice to have big guys like
that that can play."
While SMS struggled defending
Stanford inside, it certainly wasn't
having any fun outside.
The Cardinal shot a solid 42.9
percent from behind the three-point
line, with junior guard David Mose
ley hitting two of three. This added
to Lee's career-high tying five three
pointers.
SMU junior guard William
Fqntleroy was another player, in ad
dition to Moore, who needed to play
much of the game for the Bears in
order to give them any chance.
Fontleroy finished the night with 14
points, and yet SMU was down by at
least 10 points almost the entire
game.
Stanford's own guard situation
continues to be of note. While Lee's
play constantly astounds oppo
nents, with sophomore Michael Mc-
Donald's ankle sprain, Mont
gomery only has one remaining op
tion for the point guard position —
freshman Tony Giovacchini.
Giovacchini had seven points,
three steals and even grabbed four

rebounds for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal will now match up
with St. John's in the Red Storm's
own town of New York. With North
Carolina, Purdue and Stanford mak
ing up the other three teams remain

ing in the NIT, St. John's will obvi
ously have the hometown crowd and
the homecourt advantage.
"That just means we're going to
have to be that much sharper,"
Montgomery said.
Stanford and St. John's will meet
at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, fol
lowed by a North Carolina - Purdue
match.
