Kansas.
Caroline Annis from Tampa,
l la., Malindi Elmore from Kelow

na. British Columbia, Colleen Fla
herty from Excelsior, Minn, and
Laura Turner from Portsmouth,
R. 1., don't exactly fit the roles of a
scarecrow, a lion, and a tin man.
They don't lack courage, they
don't lack heart and they certainly
don't lack brains.
Their determination to get to

Kansas for today's NCAA national
championship is what makes them
fit members of a movie cast.
The women's journey to Kansas
began in the recruiting process.
Despite the fact that none of the
four was necessarily a household
name, unlike teammate Julia
Stamps, when assistant coach Beth
Alford-Sullivan and head coach
Vin Lananna were recruiting these
women, they certainly weren't
gambling on underachievers.
Sullivan makes the point very
clear that while these women may
have a low-key profile compared to
others, they were brought in with
intentions of contributing this year
to a program which claimed a na
tional championship in 1996 and
runner-up honors last year.
"They had a lot of options to go
to many different places," said Sul
livan. "They chose to come to Stan
ford because they really deep down
believed that they could make an
impact on the team and be a part of
a program like ours."
Annis is a four-time Florida
Class 5A cross country state cham
pion as well as a three-time 3,200-
meter state champion. She was a
Foot Locker national finalist in
cross country both her junior and
senior years.
Flaherty is also a multiple state
champion, claiming individual
honors in Minnesota in both the
8(X) and 1,600. While a standout
cross country runner, she gave up
the glory of racing at the her re
gional Foot Locker qualifier to
pursue her other passion, cross

country skiing. It was well worth
the sacrifice, as she claimed the
1998 national freestyle champi
onship.
Like Annis, Turner excelled in
cross country as well as in the 3,200
in track. Her 13th-place finish at
the Foot Locker finals last year
earned her Ail-American honors,
which she duplicated during the
track season.
The fourth of the women did
not exactly follow the typical road
to Stanford, that being national
success. Deviating from a history
of recruiting only U.S.-born run
ners, Sullivan felt that the Canadi
an Elmore was just too good to
pass up. A member of the Canadi
an team at the 1998 Junior World
Cross Country Championships,
she was one of the premier high
school runners in Canada, ranked
first in the <SOO meters and second
in the 1,500 meters.
Still, getting into Stanford and
having an impressive high school
background was no ticket to
Kansas. The women had to prove
themselves in both competition
and practice. Like Dorothy, they
didn't do it alone.
"They really have bought into
the team concept and that's excit
ing," said Sullivan.
Utilizing each others' strengths
and overcoming weaknesses was
key to the journey.
"Its neat on a cross country
team when you have people from
different event ranges coming in

squad return to the NCAA championships.
because everybody has different
strengths," said Turner. "You get
the really speedy people and you
get the real endurance people.
When you run with someone who
has different strengths than you,
you feed off their strength and they
feed off of yours."
The women have done what it
takes to get to Kansas — they used
their heels as Dorothy did. In only

two races this season were none of
the four frosh part of Stanford's top
five.
Both Annis and Elmore ran at
the Pre-National meet on Oct. 10,
held on the same course as today's
race. Their respective 10th- and
21st-place finishes helped the Car
dinal to victory. A week later, Fla
herty highlighted her season with a
16th-place finish at the Arizona
State Invitational.
Turner is just getting started in
her season as she was injured most
of the fall. Coming off of her official

debut at last weekend's West Re
gional qualifier, she is ready for ac
tion if called upon.
Unlike the Wizard of Oz,
though, their story is not yet over.
These four women are not con
tent in just getting to Kansas. There
are 5,000 more meters left in the
women's journey and the course at
Rim Rock Farm is anything but a
yellow brick road.
When they wake up on Tuesday
morning, they won't be in Kansas
any more. You'll just have to wait
and see if their dreams were sweet.
