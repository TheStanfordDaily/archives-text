# Defense steps up in finest hour of season
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
1 laving failed to score more than
24 points all season long, the ( alifor
nia offense must have been salivating
at the prospect of facing the Stanford
defense in Saturday's 101st Big
Game.
The Cardinal had never kept an
opponent under 2X points in a game
and featured a secondary that Pacific
It) Conference single-season record
holder Dameane Douglas could run
wild on.
Yet the Stanford defensive unit
stepped up to hand in its finest per
formance of the year against the
Bears, setting season-bests in points
allowed, sacks and total yards al
lowed as Stanford earned ownership
of the Axe for the fourth consecutive
year.
"To say our defense was outstand
ing is probably an understatement,"
said head coach Tyrone Willingham.
who is undefeated against Cal. "Es
pecially when you take into account
where our defense has been and the
place it has occupied in the confer
ence rankings this season. Ihe de
fense really stepped up big today."
All things considered, it was a
monster day for a Stanford defense
that has been criticized since giving
up 63 points to Oregon in the fourth
game of the season.
"It feels great." senior linebacker
Donnie Spragan said. "We struggled

early on and all season, giving up too
many points and all that. So it feels
real good to go out and give up just
three points. I wanted a shutout hon
estly, but I'll take a win."
Hie Cardinal limited the Golden
Bears to just l c )X total yards, after
going the whole year without holding
an opponent under 3(H) yards and al
lowing over 400 yards on six different
occasions.
Cal mustered only 3Â«S positive
rushing yards on a defense that had
previously allowed lour opponents to
gain over 200 net yards on the
ground.
And Stanford, which had only
17.5 sacks all season long, spent the
entire afternoon in the Cal backfield,
sacking Bears quarterback Justin
Vedder nine times for a loss of 73
yards.
"()ur coaches did a good job of
trying to figure out |< "al's] blocking
schemes and where their weaknesses
were and where we could get some
pressure," Willingham said. "We had
some things coordinated that allowed
some of our guys to put some pres
sure on."
Linebacker Sharcus Steen. who
had not recorded a sack this season,
was the primary beneficiary of the de
fensive game plan. Steen wreaked
havoc on a shaky Vedder. sacking
him three times and registering one
tacklc-for-loss.
Yet perhaps even more signifi
cant. Stanford was up to the task in

pressure situations in which it had
previously given up big plays for
touchdowns.
On Saturday, it was the senior
Spragan sacking Vedder on fourtli
and-one in the fourth quarter of his
final Big Game. It was redshirt junior
safety Tim Smith grabbing his fourth
interception in two games at the goal
line as Cal threatened to take the lead
with a touchdown. It was redshirt ju
nior nose tackle Andrew( urrie stuff
ing Bears running backs at the line of
scrimmage on third-and-inches.
And it was the overall team de
fense. including good coverage by the
much-maligned secondary, which
forced three consecutive incomplete
passes on Cal's final drive and
clinched the victory for Stanford.
"The thing that has bothered our
defense is the big plays," Willingham
said. "We have had stretches where
we have played well, but the big play
lias killed us. And today, we were
able to eliminate the big play in the
run game and we gave up only a few
big pass plays."
It could not have come on a better
day for the C ardinal. With the offense
struggling to score points and with
Douglas threatening to break one
every time he caught the ball, it was
imperative for the defense to hold up
in order for Stanford to keep the Axe.
Cal's biggest offensive weapon,
Douglas, who broke the conference
record for single-season receptions in
the first quarter, certainly got his

catches, hauling in 13 for 124 yards.
"He had quite a few catches and
played very well." Willingham said.
"He is an outstanding player, and I
don't know if you can truly take a
player that good out of the game."
However, Stanford kept him out
of the end zone and kept him from
breaking out into the open field.
After the Cardinal gavu up two huge
pass plays to Washington State last
weekend. Douglas was prevented
from making a play in excess of 20
yards. Additionally, Stanford did not
allow anyone else to hurt them as
Douglas accounted for 63 percent of
the total offense.
Perhaps even more impressive,
the Cardinal did it at less than full
strength. Defensive ends Riall John
son, arguably Stanford's best defen
sive playmaker. Sam Benner and
Marcus Hoover, were all out with in
juries suffered a week ago.
"What is most impressive is that
the defense stepped up without the
full complement of players." said
Willingham.
"If we take the experience of win
ning, of finding a way to win. into next
season, then we have gained some
measure of success for next year,"
Willingham said. "But I told our guys
it is not enough just to have guys re
turn. A lot of teams will have guys re
turning. It will be the maturity of our
play and the maturity of our leader
ship that will make a difference next
vear."
