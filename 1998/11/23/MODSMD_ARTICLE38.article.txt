A few notes on the lOlsi Big
Game:
• The Stanford defense, which
was much maligned during the en
tire season, found the ultimate re
demption by holding its cross-Hay
rival to only three points and nega
tive 36 rushing yards.
• With the Cardinal defense tal
lying nine quarterback sacks, the
101 st Big Game looked a lot like
the Adam Sandler movie. " The
Waterbov."

• Speaking of Waterboys, Cali
fornia quarterback Justin Vedder.
who was a highly touted junior col
lege transfer when he arrived in
Berkeley two years ago, doesn't
seem to have much of a shot at an
NFL career.
• This just in: Vedder was
sacked on his way to take a shower
in his apartment.
• By not seeking revenge
through an attack on California's
goal post. Stanford fans showed a
great deal of class. Of course, the
small militia of stadium security
that surrounded the post might
have had a lot to do with it.
• Conversely, Cal students and
the near-riot they caused was a
pretty sickening display. Among
the things thrown / hurled / pro
jected at Stanford fans: handfuls of
turf, water bottles (empty and lull),
hats, spit, shoes and sandals.
• Stanford fans weren't the per
fect picture of sportsmanship,
though. There's no need to throw
anything back. Also, keep your
middle fingers to yourselves.
• I like the Red Hot Chili Pep
pers, but did the Cal band really

have to dedicate an entire halftime
show to them? Also, ending the set
with "Under the Bridge," a song
about suicide, was pretty much a
foreshadowing of Gal's second-half
performance.
• This just in: Vedder was just
sacked while biking to his 9 a.m.
class.
• Best costume affiliated with
the Leland Stanford Junior (pause)
University Marching Band: the
commando outfits worn by our
beloved Dollies.
• Biggest play of Big Game:
With the Bears down by a touch
down and possession of the ball on
a third-and-inches from the Stan
ford 49-yard line, Andrew Currie
curbed Gal's momentum by stop
ping back Marcus Fields for a loss.
• lank Williams may have
made the tackle that kept Gal's
Deltha O'Neal from taking a
game-tying punt return for a touch
down. but punter Kevin Miller was
the wone who force O'Neal to cut
away from the sideline, thus giving
Williams the opportunity to make
the save.
• Speaking of Miller, I've always
defended him as a punter, but a 20-
yard punt'! Really now.
• I hree heads truly are better
than one. The rotating trio of Stan
ford quarterbacks Todd Husak,
Joe Borehard and Randy Fasani
seemed to work for Willinghani
and his staff. Before it was just con
fusing. by the end it was expected.
• ( al's Dameane Douglas may
have broken the conference's sin
gle-season reception record, but ju
nior flanker Troy Walters gets the
kudos for getting what proved to be
the game-winning touchdown.
• With the Axe celebrating its
KXHh birthday in the spring, it's
good to know that it's staying in the
riuht hands.

(iil Lopez would like whoever it was
blowing kisses at him and his friends
from the charter bus to know some
thing: sports(p daily. stanfimi edit.
