# Injuries to police, rowdy behavior are still problems
## Less post-Game violence 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Just as in past years, the intense
rivalry between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley did not end as the final
seconds of the 101st Big Game ran
out. But, what ensued afterwards
was not as serious as compared with
previous games, officials said.
"All in all it was pretty 'peace
fur," said Michael Dougherty, an
officer with the Berkeley Police De
partment. "Most departments com
mitted additional manpower to
help with the situation."
Despite security precautions,
some violence still occurred.

'Our primary goal was to
keep everyone in the
stadium safe'

Among the incidents reported
were rowdy, sometimes out-of-con
trol fans, destruction of property
and most seriously, the injury of
several police officers.
According to Kick Tipton of
Stanford Police, an officer from his
department was injured during the
post-game ruckus.
"One of our employees was in
jured after the game. We don't have
any further information about this
situation at this time," Tipton said.
Reports in the San Francisco
Chronicle yesterday indicated that

The Stanford Tree is protected by security personnel at Saturday's
Big Game. Security prevented a repeat of last year's post-game riot.
two University of California Police
officers were also injured, though
not seriously.
Beginning in the fourth quarter,
several hundred yellow-jacketed
event staff and security officers at
Memorial Stadium lined up around
the field in an attempt to prevent en
thusiastic fans from running onto
the field.
I hey were, however, unsuccess
ful after the game ended.
"Our primary goal [was] to keep
everyone in the stadium safe," said
Michael Lamar, with the Contem
porary Services Corporation, the
firm responsible for patrolling the
field and the entrance gates.
' We hoped to achieve this by
making sure that fans [didn't) bring
contraband items into the stadium
and [didn't] charge the field follow
ing the game."
Many students did remain in
their seats following the game. How
ever, several hundred Cal and Stan
ford fans did successfully rush the
field.
But while Stanford fans stayed
and celebrated in the Stanford cor
ner of the stadium, Cal students
crossed the field aggressively toward
the Stanford section.
Security officers were needed to
restrain the rowdy Cal students, who
attempted to break through the secu
rity lines and began to throw turf and
other small items at Stanford fans.
Stanford students, chanting
"We've got the Axe," threw back a
few clumps of grass and other items.
Students from each university re
mained separated by a few yards be
tween lines of security.
Two years ago, at the Berkeley
campus, angry Cal fans attacked the
Stanford Tree and ripped apart the
costume.
Last year at Stanford, Cal fans
broke through the fence surround
ing the field at Stanford Stadium and
security lines, took down the north
goal posts and got into a confronta
tion with students from Stanford.

This year, according to junior
Chris Henderson, the Stanford
Tree, special precautions were
taken to ensure the safety of both
mascots.
In addition to having a security
detail at all times, both mascots had
to pass a Breathalyzer test before
the game.
Five minutes before the game
finished, they removed their cos
tumes.
Tipton also indicated that there
were not any reports of serious inci
dents on the Stanford campus in the
days preceding Big Game.
The Berkeley Police Depart
ment characterized the hours fol
lowing the game as "pretty quiet."
Officials with UC Police declined
to comments on any reports made or
received following the game.
Members of the University ad
ministration had their own observa
tions as to what transpired on Satur
day.
"Though I would have preferred
that students did not go onto the
field at the conclusion of the game, I
think that when they got there they
acted in a generally appropriate, re
sponsible way," said Marc Wais,
dean of students.
"Many students got caught up in
the emotion of the win and rushed
onto the field in spite of the an
nouncements that were made. For
tunately, there were no physical al
tercations or incidents that I saw,"
he said.
Stanford students at the game
made their views clear.
"Cal fans have no class," said
Kevin Chen, a senior.
Others were angered by events
that occurred.
"Someone threw a flip-flop at
me!" exclaimed Eric Ashton, a
freshman.
Some fans remembered post
game violence from previous years.
"There was a lot of joy and ex
citement, but after a while it became
not about celebrating, but people
fighting," said Greg Farber, a senior.
"People started to beat up the Tree.
The whole experience stopped
being fun."
