Reed discussed the state of multicul
turalism in America and how the In
ternet can serve as a forum for de
bate on the issue in a lecture and
book signing Friday at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Reed, a recipient of a Mac Arthur
fellowship this year and recent au
thor of "Multi America," a collection
of essays on race and racism in
America, addressed issues raised in
selections from his writings.
Reed criticized the way in which
he feels people discuss problems of
multiculturalism, race and racism
without looking for real solutions.
"I think people are discussing
multiculturalism in a comic-book
fashion," he said.
The debate over multicultural
ism, Reed explained, is handled in a

shallow and unproductive way by in
dividuals and the media. Reed used
to write letters to newspapers to cor
rect what he saw as superficial cover
age of multicultural issues.
In the last letter he wrote to The
New York Times, Reed objected to
the paper's criticism of a group who
wanted to change the name of their
school, named after famed Confed
erate general Nathan Bedford For
rest. Forrest, Reed said, slaughtered
innocent African Americans at a bat
tle during the Civil War.
Reed's letter asked why, if Forrest
continued to be honored, a statue
honoring convicted murderer Jeffrey
Dahmer wasn't built as well.
After seeing this and other previ
ous letters not published and after
being continually dismissed as a
crank. Reed said he stopped writing
letters and began an on-line maga
zine as a forum for his and other writ
ers' ideas.

"Cyberspace is the answer for
me," he said. "The internet is a new
drum for African Americans."
His online magazine, besides
being a forum, is also a place where
unknown African writers can display
their work.
"I'm so hip and tolerant that I
publish people who I have fights
with," he said.
Reed said he is upset by the way in
which minorities are compared to
each other, and forced to compete to
fit into "model minority" stereo
types.
"Other cultures are the most op
pressive threat to African Ameri
cans," he said.
Whereas "African Americans
were once the model minority,"
Reed said, now every movie he sees
portrays African American men as
poster boys for sexism.
He said that now Asian Ameri
cans are held up as a model minority,

at the expense of African Americans.
"Today's model minority is to
morrow's scapegoat," he said.
Reed also addressed the difficul
ties which he said minority groups
have assimilating.
He said that members of minority
groups change their names and iden
tities in hope of being accepted by
mainstream society.
It is occurrences like this that
Reed, believes make some African
Americans want to return to Africa.
He views this desire as unfortunate
because of the contributions African
Americans have made to America,
particularly in literature.
Audience members said they en
joyed his discussion.
"I thought [the speech] was
thought provoking, and I like his
style of combining poetry and
speech," said Diann McCants, asso
ciate director of the program in
African and Afro-American Studies.
