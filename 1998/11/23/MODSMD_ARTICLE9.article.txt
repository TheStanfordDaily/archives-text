# Daily staff falls to Cal Loss belies obviously greater skill
## 
### Penguin Staff Projectile 
A self-sacrificing group of Daily
staffers took it on the chin for their
school on Saturday by losing to a
squad of staffers from the Daily Cal
ifornian 14-0 in the annual football
classic known as the Ink Bowl.
Tradition holds that whichever
school loses the Ink Bowl goes on to
win the Big Game itself. Therefore,
explained Editor-in-Chief Adam
Kemezis, "we were forced to lay
aside our obvious superiority and
take a dive."
"It was real tough getting people
to turn out for the game, because it's
so hard to look bad when you're
playing the Daily Cal," said Brian
"the Gimp" Eule, who claims that
the reason he can't walk straight is
from a hit he took during the game.
After Stanford players had been
unable to bring themselves to let Cal
score, quarterback Bruce "Caped
Avenger" Wang, gave an emotional
halftime speech.
"1 told the guys that we had to let
Cal score. 'This thing is bigger than
just the Daily: all of Stanford wants to
see us do the right thing,' I said."
The team gave a rousing cheer
and within minutes a Cal receiver
was in the end zone with the ball.

"The guy started running the
wrong way with the ball, but I yelled
at him to run into our end zone in
stead. I feel like it's a real achieve
ment to lose against somebody that
dumb," said "Skyscraper Sam"
Mankiewicz, Stanford's primary re
ceiving threat.
Mankiewicz did haul in several of
Wang's passes, along with receivers
Eule, Nathan "No Sushi Here"
Christensen and Gil "More
Beeeer!!" Lopez, who claims it's a lot
easier to catch a ball when you're see
ing two of them.
Stanford showed a notable defi
ciency in line size, but Kemezis, Rito
"Word-98-meister" Trevino and a
friend of his named Farooq com
bined with Jeremy "I can remember
when this was rugby" Stone to keep
Wang safe in the pocket.
Toward the end. Cal's insurance
touchdown sealed eventual Big
Game victory for Stanford, where
upon Lopez made a valiant intercep
tion with seconds remaining.
"I only learned afterwards that
the point was to lose," said Robin "I
Deliver" Tenold, the Daily's busi
ness manager, who comprised the
cheerleading squad along with Kelly
"Tongue Piercer" Young. "I just as
sumed they were playing that way
because they were really hung over."
