Give Me Your Password!
I'm a Hacker rf /yf)\
I can use your password to break in to
Stanford's computers. Even if you don't tell
me your password, I'll steal it off the network. Unless,
that is, you're using MacLeland or PC-Leland on your
personal computer.
Stanford is always adding security features to make it harder
for me to break in. But when you log in or check email and type
your password "in the clear," these features won't work.
MacLeland and PC-Leland make life tough for me because:
They're free!
** They're easy to use!
They protect your password.
They give you faster access to computing.
They even lock your computer! Both are available on the web at:

or 725-8181.
