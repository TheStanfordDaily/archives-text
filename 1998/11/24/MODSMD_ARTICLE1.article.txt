# Nobelist leaves after 15 years
## SLAC director Burton Richter to step down 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Burton Richter, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
has announced that he will step down
this spring.
The Nobel laureate has held the
position for the past 15 years, but he
is ready to move on. "It is a really
hard job. My joys are seeing good
work done, but the drudgery is
fundraising. I'm wearing out and I'm
getting out."
However, Richter will remain on
the faculty. "I'm not leaving Stan
ford. and I'm not retiring." Richter
confirmed. He has no definite plans
for another administrative job in the
University but does not rule out the
possibility.
Richter plans to take office as
president of the International Union
of Pure and Applied Physics. Ac
cording to Richter. union members
"gather together to foster interna
tional cooperation in physics." It is
composed of 40 to 50 member na
tions.
He estimates that heading the In
ternational Union of Pure and Ap
plied Science will occupy only 10 to
20 percent of his time. This will leave
him time to pursue the "high-energy
physics I want to do."
Among his accomplishments,
Richter cites, "keeping SLAC on the
frontiers of science" and "making op
portunities for people to do things
that I think are important."
A major challenge during
Richter's stint as director was over
seeing three years of shrinking feder
al funding, which forced the layoff of
more than 1(X) people.
Richter tried to make the labs ef
fective and efficient despite the lay
offs, said Prof. Bob Siemann, a col
league of Ricter's at SLAC.
Siemann said that the layoffs were
"a reality that had to happen. I know
that [Richter] was affected personal

ly by it. I don't know what else, as an
administrator, he could have done."
Richter also weathered contro
versy over the wages paid to tempo
rary workers.
In March 1997, several electri
cians working at SLAC held infor
mational pickets to protest perceived
violations of the Davis-Bacon law re
quiring federally subsidized con
struction projects to pay workers the
prevailing local union wage.
His colleagues said they will miss
him.
"Burt set the tone for the last 20
years. He developed [the Stanford
Positron Electron Assymetrical
Ring], for which he won the Nobel
Prize, he worked on storage rings,
and invented the linear collider," Sie
mann said.
Jim Turner, manager of the De
partment of Energy in Oakland, said
it was an honor to have worked with
Richter. "He is a man of tremendous
stature as a scientist and as an admin
istrator."
"At all levels it is a pleasure to
work with him, and I am sad to see
him step down, although I am happy
for him personally."
