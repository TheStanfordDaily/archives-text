## AOL may buy Netscape 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — America Online Inc. said
today it is negotiating to buy Netscape Communica
tions Corp. in a deal that would bring together the
world's largest computer Internet provider and the pio
neer company whose software first popularized the
Web.
But the deal, which was negotiated all weekend, isn't
complete. A person close to the negotiations told The
Associated Press it was unlikely the deal, estimated at
$4 billion, would be finalized today.
AOL cautioned in a statement that "there can be no
assurance that an agreement will be reached or a trans
action consummated."
Prices for both Netscape and AOL were down
slightly in early trading today.
Under one scenario, according to the source, AOL
would run Netscape's "Netcenter" Web site, which
receives roughly 20 million visitors monthly, and dis
tribute Netscape's popular browser, the software that
lets people view information on the Internet.
Sun Microsystems Inc., the third company involved
in the negotiations, would benefit in two ways: It would
take control of Netscape's business-level "server" soft
ware, and it would enjov widespread distribution

among AOL's 14 million subscribers of its Java tech
nology for running Internet programs.
AOL said its talks with Sun involved "a possible
development and marketing agreement fore-com
merce and new Internet devices, which would involve
Netscape products."
The three companies have been negotiating for at
least two weeks. If the deal is completed, it would cre
ate an alliance that dramatically would change the land
scape of the nation's technology industry.
It also could spell trouble several ways for Microsoft
Corp.. the industry giant whose Internet software com
petes directly with Netscape's.
Microsoft — with its own, far less-successful online
service and its own business-level software — also com
petes against AOL and Sun Microsystems, which
makes powerful workstation computers used by graph
ic artists and engineers.
An AOL-Netscape deal had been seriously consid
ered before, in part to meet competition from
Microsoft. In late 1995, when Netscape's browser was
the industry's leader, AOL Chairman Steve Case nego
tiated with Netscape to distribute the company's brows
er to millions of AOL subscribers.
