## Editorial Hum Bio needs funds 
### 
Half-billets and extra money
should be dedicated to this
extremely popular program

THE PROGRAM IN Human Biolo
gy doesn't generally come to mind
when one thinks of inadequately
funded sectors of Stanford. However,
increasing enrollment in Stanford's most
popular interdisciplinary program has out
paced funding, and it's going be difficult to
keep the program staffed with teachers
and teaching assistants without additional
support.
Stanford undergraduates have shown
that they like the Human Biology pro
gram; it's the fifth-largest major on cam
pus. Current mechanisms for supplying
resources to the program clearly aren't
designed to accomodate such a large
major, and some changes need to be made.
At present, Human Biology is funded
principally by its own resources, in the
shape of an endowment. For its faculty
support, the program relies heavily on the
good will of professors. Interdisclipinary
programs cannot hire their own faculty,
and have to find professors in other
departments who are willing to give half of
their teaching position, or "billet," to the
programs.
The School of Humanities and Sciences
should give due weight to student demand
when it allocates its general fund money.
In the case of Human Biology, this might
translate into extra funding for the pro
gram's core, which is a much bigger course
than interdisciplinary programs usually
offer.
We are not asking for special consider
ation for Human Biology in and of itself,
but any interdisciplinary program of its
size is going to require special considera
tion when it comes to parcelling out
resources.
Human Biology's teaching concerns are
a thornier matter. The program's area of
study is inherently interdisciplinary, and
human biology should remain a program

rather than a department. However, this
status means that there will never be any
such thing as a "Human Biology Profes
sor," a faculty member whose only aca
demic attachment is to Human Biology.
However, the issue of Human Biology's
size and importance to the undergraduate
body again demands attention.
As the situation stands, professors
choose to spend half their time in and get
half their money from the program. When
ever one of those professors retires, a cur
rent faculty member in some department
has to agree to drop half of his or her
departmental commitments and spend
that half of his or her time in Human Biol
ogy. This makes it difficult to maintain a
steady teaching staff for the program. In
addition, some of the senior faculty who
teach in the program essentially donate
their time, and when they retire, their
places may be permanently lost.
To combat this problem, we approve of
program director Russell Fernald's idea
that a few of the departments from which
Human Biology heavily draws its facul
ty — Biology, Psychology, Economics,
Sociology and so forth — should set aside
half-billets for faculty members who would
spend half of their time in Human Biology.
This would help to give Human Biology a
steadier stream of faculty.
When departments hire faculty, they
obviously and rightly consider the best
way to strike a balance among the various
subsets of any given discipline. A program
with the popularity of Human Biology
deserves that kind of consideration.
Interdisciplinary programs such as
Human Biology are hard to pull off. With
out a self-defining subject area, course
offerings have a tendency to lose their
shape and focus.
The best way to prevent this is by the
continued support of enthusiastic and able
faculty who can ensure that special pro
grams have truly special course offerings.
Given the sheer size and popularity of
Human Biology, we hope the School of
Humanities and Sciences will give the pro
gram the resources it needs to remain a
unique educational opportunity.
