## Hearings are a big waste of time 
### 
IT WAS THAT time
again. My next column
due, and so many top
ics from which to choose. I
debated doing a "Muslim
satire," but then remem
bered I did that last week.
Some friends suggested I

finally print my guide to a tropical vacation
in East Palo Alto (subtitled "Bring your
suntan lotion, your beach chair and your
gat"), but I would hate to distract those
doing valuable community service work in
the area.
So that left choosing between the top 10
reasons why I'm not as tall as Tim Young
and a discussion on a question before the
House of Representatives. Since there is
only one reason why I'm not as tall as Tim
Young (namely, I don't have gigan
tism ... by the way, Stanford basketball is
gonna win it this year), I decided to go with
the latter.
Most of you not living in a closet know
that Ken Starr appeared before the House
Judiciary Committee last Thursday. The
smell of partisan politics spread through the
air like marijuana smoke at EBF.
The Republicans spent their time lob
bing softballs in Starr's direction, nodding in
unison as the independent counsel reiterat
ed the reasons why Clinton should be
impeached.
Then came the Democrats, who on the
whole were more concerned with how Starr
obtained his evidence than why such evi
dence would warrant impeachment. While
this issue is interesting, and Starr should not
have violated Clinton's basic constitutional
rights, there is no real remedy if he did. The

facts arc still there. To my knowledge, there
is no exclusionary rule for impeachment
proceedings; Starr may as well have
obtained his evidence bv gluing himself and
a Fox Sports West mini-cam to the ceiling ot
the Oval Office —it would matter in a
court of law. but not in this political arena.
The real question not being adequately
addressed is the definition of "Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misde
meanors." The impeachment inquiry is
chronologically challenged. Why waste
weeks and months gathering data before
deciding that the data collected could con
stitute impeachment?
There are two reasons for the ordering:
(1) Defining impeachment is a rather
obscure task; it is not as easy as choosing to
avoid SLE, and definitely not as easy as
talking about Clinton's sex life; and (2)
Some will be upset about the outcome. As
declared by over 4(X) Constitutional histori
ans, perjury in a civil case and the immedi
ate result of that perjury do not meet the
Constitutional standard for removal of a
president from office.
Some, however, disagree. They claim
perjury threatens the basic principles on
which our entire legal system is based. How
can a seated president, the linchpin of our
system of justice, commit such an offense
and remain in office? The walls of the court
room would tumble down.
Hut this logic produces some perverse
results. Should we impeach a president who
runs a red light? Regardless of what New
Yorkers may think, stop signs and lights are
crucial for keeping the roads safe. Congress
would be remiss to allow such a maverick to
stay in office. People would start driving on

the sidewalks. Sure

Instead, impeachment, as implied by the
text of the Constitution, is justified under
two broad categories of offenses: abuses of
office, and high crimes and misdemeanors.
It is not meant as a punishment or a deter
rent. The sole purpose of impeachment is to
protect the public from a negligent or tyran
nical leader. Many in Congress are confused
by today's proceedings. Votes against
impeachment do not condone the presi
dent's behavior; they simply recognize that
impeachment is not a valid sanction for
crimes or activities unrelated to the official
function of one's office.
There is a difference between crimes
rendering an official unfit for office and
offenses that do not impair one's ability to
perform. Admittedly, given the current con
text, "perform" may not be the best word
choice, but the idea is the same. Perjury is
bad. and it is definitely a crime. But it is not
per sc an impeachable offense. Federal
judges have been impeached for perjury,
but the substantive matter was directlv
related to their official duties. Perjury in a
private lawsuit is intrinsically different. The
judges were not necessarily removed for
lying under oath, but for the direct connec
tion such lies had with their offices.
It may not be clear what impeachment is,
but it should be clear what impeachment is
not. Next time Congress isn't sure what to
talk about, it should choose the Muslims or
choose Tim Young, just as long as it choos
es something else.
