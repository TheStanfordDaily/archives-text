Express yourselves
Tienlon Ho's editorial notebook last Fri
day represents many of us who often think
on personal responsibility within the mince
machine of corporate omnipotence.
Extreme specialization is one of the secrets
of corporate power, but not only because it
maximizes performance. The isolationism of
specialization also divides human communi
ties into experts and naives, while it con
demns both to ignorance of what is valuable
and necessary in human life and interaction.
We come therefore to the ridiculous situ
ation where the majority of the naives are
often afraid to express even an opinion on
contemporary issues that affect them, while
experts sh(x>t out jargon, ignoring the rest of
the cast and the accompanying orchestra.
Stanford students, well known for their
apathy, should perhaps care less about a pro
fessionally successful future and more about
a meaningful present. And the present

becomes meaningful when the fear of speak
ing one's own mind is put aside and when the
calculative politics of image-making gives
way to sincerity of thought and speech.
Personal responsibility is about assuming
control over our own lives, usually molded
by corporate-designed images. To do so we
need to fight complacency and the intimida
tion of limited knowledge, an intimidation
which is unfortunately still cultivated by self
serving guardians of academic prestige.

Cal will be rewarded
Lest the people of Stanford become over
ly blissful over their Big Game victory, I
remind you Stanfordites that we all die even
tually. While I have not witnessed a Cal Big
Game victory in my college life, I relish
knowing that someday, standing before the

gates of Heaven, I shall tell Saint Peter what
generousity we Cal students commited: For
four years we let Stanford heat us; for four
years we meekly yielded the Axe to our
brethren at the Farm; for four years we
resisted neither evil nor the Stanford offense.
Surely there will he reward in the next
world for the humiliation suffered! Surely
there will be punishment for trampling upon
a feeble, defenseless football team! If you
happen to be of the Buddhist faith, I would
merely point out the possibility of your rein
carnation as a student at Cal.

Respect Gaieties
Dave Stein, in the traditional "I'm an old
senior and nothing makes me happy any
more, and you should all be like me, cause

I'm tired" cynical style, implied in his col
umn that Gaieties 98 rehashed the same
stuff he's heard for four years. On behalf of
the cast, crew, staff and writers, I'm going to
respond in a calm and rational manner
without using expletives.
Gaieties is a hard show to write. You
need to appeal to freshmen, who are still
new to the Stanford experience, and come
to Gaieties to learn a bit about Stanford cul
ture and traditions. You also need to keep
seniors interested, who have heard Cal get
bashed Gaieties-style for three years and
know all about the post office and penis
jokes. It's a tough mix.
Last year's writing staff tried to appeal
more to those who are, like Stein, tired of
hearing about the rivalry and Stanford's
inherent goodness. As a result, the Steins of
the campus got to smirk for a bit and then
go home to prep up for their management
consulting interviews. However, the darker
side to that story was that the freshmen,
who comprise the entire audience on Friday

night's show, heckled those of us unfortu
nate enough to he on stage for three hours,
and left wondering, "Why did I come to
Stanford in the first place? This school
sucks." Score one for Stein. Between the
two, I'll take this year's Gaieties.
In sum, I'd like to thank the school,
seniors included — many of whom showed
up to party with us on Thursday — for
believing us when we said this year's show
was going to be good, and for forgetting
about last year's Stein-esque script. Finally,
on behalt of all of us Gaieties types: Thank
you, Cardinal football, for treating the
sch(X>l to the perfect end to a perfect Big
Game week. We knew you'd beat those
hooligans at Cal. I'm sorry. Stein, but they
do suck, and there really are a bunch of
weirdos on Telegraph, and Hoover Tower
does look like a big penis. Welcome to Stan
ford.
