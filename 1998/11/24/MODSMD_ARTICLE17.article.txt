## Seeking some advice from Art Lee

Jim Tankersley

D EAR ART,
Listen, I understand you're probably
too busy to check your P.O. box or your
e-mail right now, what with daily practice
regimens and posing for the cover of
Sports Illustrated and all, but I really
need to talk to you about something. I
guarantee you're the only guy on campus
who will understand.
You probably just remember me as that
Daily reporter from your Comm class this
summer, if you remember me at all. But
we have something in common:
Of the 3,000-plus Stanford undergradu
ate men, we're the only two starting at
point guard for intercollegiate basketball
teams.
I'll forgive you if you're a little con
fused. Yes, that's me, the 5-foot- 1 ) jour
nalist in the picture up there. Starting
point guard, just like you.
OK. maybe it's a little different. You
are, technically, running the offense of
the No. 2 or No. 3 or No. 1 team in the

NCAA, depending on which poll you
believe. You've been to the Final Four
and you're a preseason All-America can
didate. You are, in every sense of the
word, good at basketball.
Me, I'm not so much "good" in the typ
ical American definition of a basketball
player.
1 can't really handle the ball, I'm a
streaky shooter, my vertical leap is about
four inches on a good day and my
defense, well, insert your own "French
Army" joke here.
But I'm still a starter for the Ecole
Superieur de Commerce de Paris men's
hoops team.
The ESC'P is the French business
school affiliated with the Stanford Pro
gram in Paris, and each year a Stanford
student or two tries out for the basketball
team and is instantly promoted to super
star status. That's the beauty of French
basketball.
My team practices once a week, for two
hours on Monday nights, and we mainly
work on fast breaks and scrimmage. Then

the coach tells us we've done well, we all
go home smiling and we meet again on
Thursday afternoons to put on our red
and-green striped jerseys (no team shorts,
but I'm partial to wearing a maroon Stan
ford pair) and play our game of the week,
which three times out of four we lose.
I guess I always thought things would
be different as a starter.
During my entire high school basket
ball career. I started exactly two games:
once on the sophomore team when half
the guys were gone skiing, the other on
my final night as a varsity senior. It was
tradition, the coach said, to start the
seniors in their last game, especially at
the end of a 5-17 season when the team
has no shot at the playoffs.
That last game was the highlight of my
athletic life.
I scored six points (opening the game
with a three-pointer from the left wing)
and was the leading scorer at halftime. I
still watch the game tape regularly when
I'm home in Oregon.
Six points, for you, is like 1.4 seconds

against Rhode Island.
You got your chance to lead the team
and you came through, just like you
always knew you would. Me, 1 endured
my entire senior season glued to the
bench, swearing that if I was in the game,
things would be different. But it's not that
easy, is it?
It's hard to live up to expectations,
whether they come from yourself, your
teammates or large national publications.
It's even harder to get out on the court
with those expectations in mind and still
manage to have fun. You can do that,
your team can do that, and that's why
your fans are so loyal and your expecta
tions are so high. You guys enjoy your
selves out there, and we enjoy watching
you.
Last week, for the first time in my life,
I stopped having fun on the court. I real
ized that I was so wrapped up in
winning — and even more so in my per
sonal performance — that I was missing
the point of the game.
There are no polls here, no standings,

no newspaper write-ups, no fans at the
games. The point isn't to be a superstar;
it's to enjoy my chance to play, a chance
that I really had only once in high school.
I guess that's the point of this letter, to
thank you and the rest of the team for
reminding me what's important. 1 was
going to ask for some good tips on driving
the lane and how to convince my French
teammates that passing is a valuable part
of the offense, but I know you don't have
time to answer. It's OK. You've got a job
to do, and so do I.
Thanks for listening, man, and good
luck this season. One of the Stanford
point guards has to win some games.
Sincerely,
Jim
