# NCAA CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS
## Glynn paces third-place women, Hausers and men finish in second Teams come home without winning a national title, but disappointment and frustration are not on their minds

LA WRENCE, Kan. — The Stan
ford women's cross country team
nearly stole the show at the NCAA
Championships.
Coming into the meet as the sixth
ranked team in the nation, many had
not expected Stanford to be a serious
contender for the team title. All eyes
were on No.l Brighani Young and
No. 2 Villanova.

The Cardinal women were out to
prove them wrong. TTiey succeeded.
Unfortunately the team's efforts
fell just short of a second national title
in the past three years.
Villanova claimed the victory, se
curing their sixth NCAA title of the
'90s by tallying 1()6 points. Defending
champion BYU followed wit 110
points. In third was Stanford with 111
and Georgetown rounded out the
awards recipients with 199 points.
Assistant coach Beth Alford-Sulli

van was happy with the performance.
"I am extremely pleased," Sulli
van said. "We rose to the occasion
and we did what we needed to do. We
put ourselves in it. And we're about
the only team that I can say is year in
and year out putting our kids in it."
While others would certainly dis
agree with the last part of that state
ment, no one can dispute that the
Cardinal performed admirably.
Tops amongst the women was ju
nior Sally (ilynn. Having already had

an impressive championship season,
finishing third at the Pacific 10 Con
ference championships and eighth at
the Western Regional qualifiers, she
stepped it up one more notch to help
the Cardinal score big up front. Run
ning in her second-consecutive
NCAA championship, she caught up
with teammate Julia Stamps late in
the race and then passed her with 150
meters to go to claim fifth place in 17
minutes, nine seconds.
"Sally ran to her potential and to

her level." said Sullivan. "She has
stepped it up to a high level that Julia
has been at. Sally put herself there
and that strengthens us so much. She
did it at the right time."
Glynn had a different race tactic
than Stamps and it worked out well.
Instead of going out with the lead
group, she went out less aggressively,
then hammered it toward the end.
"I was a little surprised, but it's
something that definitely I aim for,"
said Glynn of her race.
Stamps, also finished with a sec
ond-straight All-America honor.

WOMEN'S
CROSS COUNTRY
■ Yesterday: No. 6 Stanford places
third at NCAAs.

"I felt really strong throughout the
race," said Stamps. "During the last
part I was getting a little tired, hut
Sally really helped me. She came
right up and said 'Let's go Jule,'and 1
said 'All right, let's go'."
Third across the line was captain
Mary Cobb. Her 32nd-place just
missed in securing her a fourth
straight All-America award.
While the Cardinal was expected
to be strong up front, doubts had
been raised about its ability to close
up the fourth and fifth spots.
Freshman Caroline Annis helped
dispel those doubts with a 40th-place
finish in Annis had strug
gled at the Pac-l()s, and while her per
formance at last week's regional meet
was an improvement, she really re
turned to her top form yesterday.
"Coach gave me a place that I
needed to get to give us a shot of hav

ing any chance at the title," said
Annis. "I knew that I had to get in the
top 50 or top 45.1 had a plan and just
stuck to it and I am glad that I could
step up a little."
The wild card for the Cardinal was
no doubt junior Mary Huang. Run
ning in her first NCAA champi
onship, she improved her time from
the pre-National meet by 55 seconds
to close out the Cardinal scorers in
54th place.
Villanova, while not as strong up
front as the Cardinal, totaled fewer
points by putting four runners under
21st place. Pre-race favorite and de
fending champion Carrie Tollefson,
who ended up 11th. led them. Next
for the Wildcats was redshirt fresh
man Sarah Goodman in 12th fol
lowed by Kristen Nicolini. Last year's
sixth-place finisher. Carmen Douma,
and the 1996 fourth-place finisher.
Kristine Jost, rounded out Villano
va's scoring in 21st and 69th place re
spectively.
The race for the individual title
was equally as exciting as the team
race.
While Gladys Keitany of Texas
Christian pushed the lead pack
through the early uphill, Chan of
BYU soon overtook her.
That stint at frontrunning was also
short lived. Amy Skieresz of Arizona
was in the lead by at least 10 meters
when the women came down
Teardrop Downsweep toward the
two-mile marker.
Yet as the women neared the fin
ish line, Skieresz, the '96 champion,
was passed by Katie McGregor of
Michigan, who won with a time of
16:47. Skieresz had to settle for a third
second-place NCAA finish.

LAWRENCE, Kan — In a gutsy
race that lived up to pre-meet hype,
the Stanford men captured second
place yesterday in the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Beaten only by top-rank !
Arkansas, whose squad scored > 7
points en route to its ninth national
championship, the No. 2 Cardinal
harriers tallied 114 points to outdis
tance third-place Colorado (158
points) and the remainder of the 31-
team field.

MEW'S CROSS COUNTRY
■ Yesterday: No. 2 Stanford takes
second at NCAAs.

Colorado's Adam Goucher was
the individual champion with a time
of 29 minutes, 26.90 seconds over the
10-kilometer course.
"With 255 athletes in the field, if
you do the math, it was actually a
very close race," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "I wouldn't call a 17-point
difference a runaway win."
Led by the efforts of All-America
award winners Brad Hauser, a se
nior, in sixth place (30:18.20), sopho
more Jonathon Riley (ninth place,
30:41.90) and senior Brent Hauser
(13th place, 30:49.40), Stanford an
swered the challenge posed by the
nation's best cross country teams.
Stanford's top three were fron
trunners from the gun, as Riley
joined Brad and Brent Hauser
among the leaders and avoided
heavy mid-pack traffic.
"The race really didn't go out that
fast," said Brad Hauser. "I was pretty

comfortable the first couple of
miles."
As the race progressed, the pack
stratified with Goucher, West Re
gion and Pacific 10 Conference
champion Abdi Abdirahman of Ari
zona and Butler's Julius Mwangi
being chased bv Michael Power and
Sean Kaley of Arkansas and Brad
Hauser, among others. Brent Hauser
and senior Jon Weldon joined others
in close pursuit.
Meanwhile, sophomore Thomas
Murley and redshirt freshman Jamey
Gilford worked together with senior
Jason Balkman to close the gap on
the early leaders.
Arkansas, the NCAA leader in
men's cross country titles, held firm.
Joining Kaley and Power up front
was NCAA steeplechase champ
Matt Kerr, while the Razorbacks'
Andrew Begley and 1,500-meter
champion Seneca Lassiter were close
behind.
Riley teamed up with Brent
Hauser, who he caught near the four
mile marker, and the duo began to
pick off the members of the chase
pack. Pushing past Kerr and Begley.
they were soon within sight of Brad
Hauser.
"Goucher, Mwangi and Abdi
threw in a big surge in the middle of
the race," said Brad Hauser. "I didn't
feel as comfortable as I wanted to in
the middle of the race, and therefore
towards the end, I didn't have the
finish that I wanted to have.
"I wanted to run the first four miles
as relaxed as possible, and then start
moving up after that, start picking
people off in the last two miles, but it
just didn't happen that way. I got one,
but 1 wanted to get more than that."

The Cardinal's top three runners
finished within 14 seconds of each
other, and it was another 41 seconds
before Thomas Murley crossed the
line as Stanford's next scorer in a
46th-place time of 31:20.90.
By that time, four Arkansas run
ners had crossed the line. Stanford
caught a break when Power dropped
out of the race with less than a mile to
go after suffering severe dehydra
tion. But Adam Daily, Arkansas'
fifth man, was just on Murley's heels,
finishing in 31:24.20 and sealing

the victory for Arkansas.
Redshirt freshman Jamey Gifford
was Stanford's final scorer in 61st
(31:37). Jon Weldon was 65th in a
time of 31:43.20 and Jason Balkman
rounded out the Stanford contingent
in 31:59 for 87th.
Lananna was pleased with the ef
fort of his runners.
"One of the things we have to ap
preciate in all sports is that every time
out, there are 'X' number of teams
that are trying to win a national title
or score in the national champi

onships," said Lananna.
"I think there are 29 other teams
that would like to have been in the
position that we are in. By no means
will 1 apologize for the team being
second at the NCAAs."
The race also marked the final
time that the Hauser twins will race
for the Cardinal on the cross country
trails, though Brad Hauser said that
the sentimental significance of the
race was not on his mind.
"1 don't think we made it out to be
' This is our last race, we've got to win.

we've got to do this or that'," said
Hauser. "It was more like 'Just an
other race, we're going to go out
there, do the best we can, and hope
fully that will set us up to win.' Un
fortunately, today it didn't."
Absent from the line-up was red
shirt freshman Gabe Jennings, who
has been out with a shin injury for
much of the championship season.
Lananna brought Jennings to
Lawrence to assess his condition and
make a late decision on whether or
not he would run.
