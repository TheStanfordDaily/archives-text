# With only Cobb leaving, future is bright for women

LAWRENCE, Kan. — With the
Stanford women's third consecu
tive top-three finish at the NCAAs
yesterday, the evolution of the
team from a building program to
perennial powerhouse was com
pleted.
Head coach Vin Lananna's ar
rival on campus in 1992 best marks
the beginning of this process.
Though the team failed to qualify
for Nationals in 1992, from that
point on they would be consistently
competing on a national level. The
very next year they placed 11th at
Nationals.
Yet coaching can only go so far
without the needed firepower of
capable athletes. While Monal
Chokshi was a great grab in 1993,
she couldn't do it alone.
In came Kortney Dunscombe,
Jessica Fry, Sara Moore and Sarna
Renfro. Together their accolades
included numerous state titles, not
to mention a third-place finish at
the Foot Locker High School Na
tional Championships from Ren
fro. Their impact was immediate as
the team placed seventh in 1994.
One ingredient was missing

from this young team, aside from
recruit Mary Cobb — experience.
Very rarely in any sport does a
group of newcomers come to dom
inate. And while racing again and
again will naturally add to this, it
helps to have someone to point out
the finer points of competition.
Certainly Lananna could do
this, but not many would argue the
fact that a woman could better re
late to a team of women than a man
ever could. Adding assistant coach
Beth Alford-Sullivan to the staff in
1995 cemented the foundation of a
strong team.
Sullivan had the experience of
having been a team captain at her
alma mater, Minnesota, and having
coached women at Mankato State
and Southeast Missouri State.
In only her second year, the
women brought home the national
title by upsetting then-No. 1 Vil
lanova. It was a victory for the pro
gram as much as it was for the ath
letes.
But winning one title doesn't
guarantee a place in history. It
doesn't even ensure that oppo
nents will fear you.
Luckily for the Cardinal, No. 1
recruit Julia Stamps was brought in
for the title defense, and now-ju

nior Sally Glynn continued to ma
ture. This duo, along with Mary
Cobb, formed Stanford's top three
at all events in the 1997 champi
onship season. Stamps' fifth-place
finish at Nationals nearly helped
the then-No. 1 Cardinal repeat as
champions, but BYU's women
were just too strong. Stanford's
women had to settle for second
by a margin of two points.
Again the ladies showed that
Stanford was a force to be reck
oned with, but they were yet to
make it to powerhouse status.
Though the team remained ranked
No. 2 throughout most of the sea
son, when it didn't obliterate the
competition at the Western Re
gional qualifier just over a week
ago, many counted it out.
Pollsters didn't take into to ac
count that it was a "foregone con
clusion," as Lananna put it, that the
team would qualify regardless of a
victory. Were people wrong in
doubting this Stanford team?
While the results of yesterday's
meet say yes, it is certainly under
standable to doubt a team that was
dealing with a host of minor in
juries and sicknesses, not to men
tion an abundance of fresh talent
thrown right into the mix.
Yesterday, those doubts were
crushed as the last brick of the
Stanford powerhouse was put into
place. No, the team didn't win. but
there's no rule that more than one
powerhouse can't exist. Right now,
it appears there are three — Stan
ford, BYU and Villanova.
To clarify, a powerhouse is not a
team that has success in one single
season, or even in three as the Car
dinal now has. It is one that can in
voke fear in its competitors, one
that can be expected to be at the
top year in and year out.
Next year, only one of Stan
ford's women, Cobb, will not re
turn. While she is an asset that can
not easily be replaced, another
strong incoming class along with
the young members of this team
should help fill the gap. Keep in
mind that other teams lose their
runners too. Both Villanova and
BYU will lose their No. 1 runners
to graduation.

Fifth-place NCAA finisher Sally
Cilynn, who will likely be captain
next year, is confident that Stan
ford is here to stay.
"Four out of the nine of us that
are here (in Kansas) are freshmen

and we're just going to have an un
believable team," said Glynn.
"Five points out of first place [at
today's meet] — I think with new
comers and the rest of our team we
will be right up there again."
