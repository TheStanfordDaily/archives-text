# Early admit applications arrive

The results are in.
Two thousand six hundred and
eight high school seniors from
around the country, calling Stanford
their first choice, submitted Early
Decision applications as of the Nov.
1 deadline, said Robert Kinnally,
dean of undergraduate admissions
and financial aid.
These applicants for the Class of
2003 are the first to apply under the
recently restructured Early Decision
program. The program no longer in
cludes Early Decision 11, whose
deadline fell between Early Decision
I on Nov. 1 and regular review on
Dec. 15.
According to Kinnally, 1,580 stu
dents applied Early Decision I last
year. Of the 3,172 students who ap
plied early by the end of the second
round, only 611 were admitted,
which translates into a 19 percent
admit rate overall.
Kinnally estimates similar figures
this year.
"The 2,608 number is consistent
with the number of applications we
were expecting. I estimate that close
to 20 percent of that number may be

offered admission, but it is too soon
to tell what those numbers will ulti
mately be." he said.
Last year, a record setting 18,888
students applied for admission to
Stanford. Thirteen percent were ad
mitted, constituting the lowest admit
rate in the University's history.
"The smaller overall number of
early applicants this year will not
necessarily translate into a higher
admit rate. Rather, more students
might be admitted from the regular
pool," Kinnally said.
Students who are admitted must
withdraw all applications to other
colleges if accepted. Those not ad
mitted are either deferred to the reg
ular application pool or rejected
from further consideration all to
gether.
Stanford began its Early Decision
program three years ago along with a
number of Ivy League schools. In re
cent years, more students have taken
advantage of early admission possi
bilities.
According to U.S. News & World
Report, students and parents have
begun to see early admission as an at
tractive option because it ends the
application process a few months
earlier. Other students see early ad

mission programs as a way to let a
school know that it is their first
choice.
"I applied early because I have
known that I wanted to come here
since fourth grade," said Brad
Hunter, a freshman who applied
early last year. "More importantly,
though, I was hoping to find out [be
fore Christmas] whether or not I'd be
going to school, so that I wouldn't
have to fill out all of my other appli
cations."
However, many people view
early admission as one of the latest
tactics in gaining admission to the na
tion's top universities. While statis

tics may show a slightly higher per
centage within the Early Decision
pool, Kinnally explains that these fig
ures can be misleading.
"Oftentimes the reason for this
rate is because of the overall high
quality and competitiveness that we
see within early admit groups," he
said.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions is starting to review the
applications and anticipates mailing
out decisions by Dec. 15.
"Obviously, it is too soon to speak
about the quality of the pool this
year," Kinnally said. "We should
know more in the coming weeks."
