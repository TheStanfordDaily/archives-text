# Riley already in national spotlight
## Sophomore's eighth-place finish at NCAAs proves his prowess as one of nation's best 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
LAWRENCE. Kan. — Stanford
sophomore Jonathon Riley is one of the
nation's most heralded young runners.
His track record often earns him men
tions in the same breath with such dis
tance legends as Jim Ryun, Gerry Lind
gren and even the great Steve Pre
fontaine, not to mention current stars
Gabriel Jennings of Stanford and
Arkansas' Seneca Lassiter.
Yesterday's ninth-place finish at the
NCAA Championships, in a field as deep
as any other seen in years, only served to
solidify the Brookline, Mass., native's
standing among these great athletes.
Riley's finishing time, a blistering 30
minutes, 31.90 seconds not only garnered
him his second All-America honor in as
many years, but also made him the top
finisher in the meet among freshmen and
sophomores.
"Last year, the whole thing was new to
me and I just got out there to run my butt
off and see where I finished," said Riley,
who was 23rd in 1997. "This year I sort ot
knew what to expect and therefore I
could set some goals."
"The top 10 was kind of my ideal
goal," said Riley. "Coach [Vin Lananna]
thought top 10 was ambitious but lie
thought I could do it so he gave me a plan
to go out there and do it."
A frontrunner from the outset of
Monday's race, Riley did not seem to be
intimidated by the able competition
around him. He described the strategy he
employed based in part on his knowledge
of the course gathered from the Oct. 10
pre-NCAA meet held on the same
course.
"At the pre-National meet our team
got out fast for the first part of the start,
settled down and ended up getting
swamped and pushed to the back." said
Riley, who sat out that meet recovering
from a track-season-ending hip injury. "I
was nervous about that so I just made
sure to really get out hard."
For the first three miles of the 10-kilo
meter race, Riley raced right along with

runners considered to be in distance-run
ning's upper echelon.
And Riley wasn't even running out of
. his mind. Maintaining complete compo
sure throughout the race, Riley steadily
moved up past the competition until he
found himself in the top 10.
"1 tried to relax for three miles, just let
people pass me while I got settled in."
said Riley.
"After three miles, that's when coach
told me I had to start really racing, and
that's when people started coming back
to me."
Complying with a little advice from
Lananna, Stanford's resident distance
guru, Riley took cues from senior Brent
Hauser to help in his racing plan.
• "Coach told me that Brent would be a
good person to key off of during the
race," said Riley. "I ended up catching up
to him at about three or three and a half
miles."
The two worked together for much of
the remainder of the race.
• "It gives peace of mind to have a team
> mate right there to work together and
' relax with," Riley said.
' Riley blitzed the last half of the course,
passing experienced runners with what
appeared to be relative ease. He crossed
the finish stripe four spots ahead of Brent
Hauser's 13th-place showing (30:39.90)
rand three spots behind Brad Hauser's
30:18.20 fifth place.
Lananna, who knows the potential for
distance greatness when he witnesses it.

• Riley.
"Jonathon has wonderful racing
savvy," said Lananna. "He knows what
he's got to do and the time he's got to do
it.
. "He has good sense; he's got a good
fee! for his body and he doesn't get in
• over his head, yet he docs go out and put
himself in the mix."
And if things continue to roll as posi
tively for Riley as they did in the national
meet, he can expect to be in the mix for a
long time to come.
