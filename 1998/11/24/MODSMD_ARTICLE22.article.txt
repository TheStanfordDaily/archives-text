# Seniors leaving behind legacy

### Ben Allen Staff writer 
LAWRENCE, Kan. — When the NCAA champi
onship meet came to a close yesterday at Rim Rock Farm
in Lawrence, Kan., there was another historic ending of
sorts for the Stanford Cardinal.
The meet marked the final competition for a sensa
tional senior class, a group of runners that took the pieces
of a relatively unknown system and, under the tutelage of
head coach Vin Lananna, crafted the Stanford Machine.
Running the trails for the final time for Stanford were
Jason Balkman. Jon Weldon and perhaps the most recog
nizable feature of Stanford cross country over the past
four years, the twin combination of Brad and Brent
Hauser.
"Our seniors have taken this program from a non
qualifier to the NCA As, and they've put us in a position to
be in the team hunt," said Lananna.
This group is not limited to the four men who helped to
power Stanford to a second-place finish yesterday. Team
stalwart Chris Lundstrom, who has been a contributor to
Stanford successes numerous times, will also leave the
program after years of dedication.
Balkman brought years of big-meet experience to the
Stanford cross country equation. He was an integral
member of the national-meet qualifying teams in each of
his four years, including the two national championship
teams in 19% and 1997.
Weldon has also been a contributor to the Stanford
program in more ways than one. While helping the Cardi
nal to a pair top-two finishes in the 1997 and 1998 NCAA
meet, the Thomasville, N.C. native has also twice gar
nered Pacific 10 Conference All-Academic honors.
"Jon's done a really good job filling in at various posi
tions throughout his time here," said Lananna. "He has
been a big leader for the team this year."
And the most decorated duo among the Stanford har
riers, Brad and Brent Hauser. will be sorely missed on the
squad.
The Hauser combination, which first saw national at
tention back in its high school days in Kingwood, Texas,
has become a nationally renowned distance force. Now,
many look to the likes of the Hausers to help revive the
sport of distance running in America.
With such a tremendous senior class retiring from the
trails for the Cardinal, one wonders how the Machine will
fare in the years to come.
"As I look at it, the sign of a good program is its ability
to maintain and be a consistent one," said Lananna.
Consistency may as well be the middle name of sopho
more Jonathon Riley. He is more than capable of filling
the shoes of his predecessors; his ninth-place finish is rem
iniscent of Brad Hauser's sixth-place finish in 19%.
Thomas Murley, also a sophomore, is not far behind.
An NCAA provisional qualifier in the 10,(XX) meters on
the track, his specialty bodes well for Stanford's future.
Many other potential stars fill out the future roster for
the Cardinal. Redshirt freshman Jamey Clifford has come
through in the clutch for Stanford a number of times, and

who is to say what fellow redshirt Gabe Jennings, a sub
four-minute miler in traek, can do with a healthy body.
And one should not forget Grant Robison and Isaac
Hawkins. These two, currently overseas on Mormon mis
sions in South Africa and the Philippines, respectively.

With top high-schoolers like
Andy Powell of Massachusetts and
Adam Tenforde of Washington ex
pected to enroll in Stanford next
year, there is no end in sight for the
successes of Stanford's team.
"With the guys we have coming in
and all of the guys we have returning,
we've got a great nucleus and a great
foundation," said Lananna. "We
kind of have to start over a little bit,
but where we'll be starting from is a
much higher spot."
