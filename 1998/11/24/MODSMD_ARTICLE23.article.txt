## Just a bit outside Fighting a bigger, more menacing foe 
### 
Brian Eule

She is a winner. Opponents
shudder at the thought of fac
ing Tar a VanDerveer, head coach
of Stanford's women's basketball
team.
With an Olympic gold medal,
two national championships and
more than her share of trips to the
Final Four already under her belt,
there is little question that Van-
Derveer is on top of her game.
And yet, there is one opponent
for which the roles are reversed.
There is one opponent Van-
Derveer can not beat by simply
drawing up one of her winning
game plans.
Cancer.

Last December, a VanDerveer
lost. Dunbar VanDerveer.
"He was diagnosed with can
cer. but it didn't really material
ize," the coach said of her father's
battle. "We thought he was beat
ing it and then, one day, he had a
brain tumor."
One year later, VanDerveer is
doing her part to help another
team looking for some wins — the
American Cancer Society.
"I do think |my father's death]
makes me more aware as to what
is this disease and what can we do
to fight it," VanDerveer said. "A
lot of it is how everyone is so af
fected by cancer in our society. As
basketball coaches and teams, we
can raise money for finding the
cure to cancer."
VanDerveer and her Stanford
Cardinal, along with the Stanford
men's basketball team, are in
volved in ;i program organized by
Coaches vs. Cancer called the
IKON 3-Point Attack. Local busi
nesses, clubs and fans pledge a
specific amount of money for each
three-point shot the team sinks.
"We can help out. We're a
good three-point shooting team."

VanDerveer laughs. "I think a lot
of it is just trying to bring atten
tion to the fact that this is an issue
in everyone's lives, including
coaches. I think it is something
that really strikes home with the
women's basketball fans here at
Stanford.
"It's not something that's just
like we're signing up for some
fundraiser. These are really per
sonal issues for us."
The issue certainly has been
striking home of late for Van-
Derveer.
Almost a year to the day after
her father's death, the coach will
find herself at the first-annual
Stanford Basketball Coaches vs.
Cancer Tip-Off Breakfast in
which she, along with men's coach
Mike Montgomery, will meet and
talk with fans in an effort to get
them to support the program.
"His situation," VanDerveer
reflected on her father's fight, "it
does make it personal for me."
The coach had already begun
last season, when she learned that
her father was in trouble. Flying
home immediately, VanDerveer
was there for her family as much
as she has been there for her play
ers.
"He had a great, great lite," she
said. "It's hard. It's not a good sit
uation but I do think it makes me
more aware."
The idea of helping others is
not exactly foreign to Stanford's
women's basketball team, which
is involved in several charitable
programs including mentoring
young girls from ;i school in F.ast
Palo Alto.
And yet, this program seems
somewhat different.
"As a coach, you want to give
back to the community and I think
the Coaches vs. Cancer program
is a real positive way to do it," she
said.
Cancer is "something that both
myself and Mike |Montgomery|
have personal situations where
people in our families' lives have
been changed by cancer. I know
that both of us have real strong
feelings about it. [While] we have


Brian
Eule
our jobs to do, coaching basketball
teams, we are sensitive to other is
sues too and we're supportive of
trying to raise money and find the
cure to cancer."
Last season, Coaches vs. Can
cer, a partnership between the
American Cancer Society and the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches with endorsement from
the Women's Basketball Coaches
Association, raised over $3 million
to benefit the American Cancer
Society.
The IKON 3-Foint Attack is
one of several fundraising pro
grams Coaches vs. Cancer employs
to help utilize fan contributions to
benefit research, patient services
and prevention for local chapters
of the American Cancer Society.
"The main thing we liked is the
fact that the money that's raised

goes directly to the American Can
cer Society and to the community
that you live in," VanDerveer
added.
Working with Stanford's men's
basketball team, the attention the
two Cardinal teams normally re
ceive in the Bay Area is enormous.
With sharpshooting players, there
is little doubt that Stanford will be
generating a large amount of
money for the program.
And hard as it may be for Van
deerver to stop and reflect on the
loss of her father, she knows she is
working hard to build yet another
winning team.
"Myself and Mike," she said,
"we're in a situation where we are
part of the Coaches vs. Cancer
team."

Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
columns appear every Tuesday,
hopes that Stanford's three-point
sharpshooters catch this opponent
off guard.
