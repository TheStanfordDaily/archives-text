# Volleyball closes out season
## Women to face Dons in finale 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Stanford's women's volleyball
team was thrown from its hard-charg
ing horse Sunday. No. 11 USC hand
ed the Pacific 10 Conference champi
on and No. 4 Cardinal its first Pac-1()
loss of the season, a convincing 3-1
defeat in Los Angeles.
Hut, tonight at Maples Pavilion,
Stanford will jump right back on for
what should be a much smoother ride
against the University of San Francis
co.
While Stanford (24-3) might wish
to be facing a more competitive team
in its final regular-season match, the
Dons (1-28) look to provide little
challenge for the Cardinal.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 4 Stanford (24-3) vs.
USF (1-28), 7 p.m. Maples Pavilion.
RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM).

San Francisco is a very young, in
experienced team, according to Stan
ford coach Don Shaw.
"I saw them at a tournament we
were at in Colorado [in early Septem
ber], and I saw a young team with po
tential," he said. "They're inexperi
enced and with injuries. That's held
them hack.
"It's an obvious mismatch on
paper. But, we'll treat them with re
spect like we treat everybody else."
Even so, the Cardinal will proba
bly limit the amount of time that two
of its stars, junior outside hitter Kerri
Walsh and sophomore setter Robyn
Lewis, spend on the court.
Walsh, a two-time All-American
who leads Stanford with 328 kills and
272 digs this year, has been slowed by
a shoulder injury all season. After
recording 25 kills against IJCLA Fri
day and 22 against I JSC. she will see
limited action tonight
Lewis, who leads the Cardinal
with 970 assists, will probably not
play because of a foot injury suffered
last week. Although she played
against UCLA, she sat out the USC
match and yesterday's practice. X-ray
results have not yet been released,
but depending on its severity, the in
jury could affect Lewis' availability
for the NCAAs, which begin Dec. 4.
The ( ardinal hopes to have Lewis
back for the tournament, as it is push

ing to win its third-straight and fifth
overall NCAA championship.
"She's had a great year," Shaw
said. "She's a potential all-league
player because she's been the quar
terback for the conference champi
ons. We'd like to have her and we ex
pect to have her."

Tonight's game will probably have
little effect on Stanford's NCAA
tournament placement, but it is the
Cardinal's only remaining chance to
impress the selection committee after
its struggles last weekend. However,
Shaw said he thinks the team has little
to prove.

"We still won the conference,
we've got a pretty good record. Our
only other losses were to [No. 3] Ne
braska and [No. 10] UC-Santa Bar
bara early on. We should be all right.
Hut, at this point in the season you
just don't know. It's hard to predict,"
he said.
