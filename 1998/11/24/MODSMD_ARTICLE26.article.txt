The Cardinal Wrestling team is
set to square off against San Fran
cisco State at SFS tonight in the first
dual meet of the 1998-99 season.
Stanford appears to match up well
with the Dons and is ready after a
strong showing at last weekend's
California Open.

WRESTLING
â–  Today: Stanford at San Francisco
State. 7 p.m.

Stanford has had a tough time in
the last two years against the Dons,
losing the past two dual meets de
spite holding a 10-2 record against
them in the last 12 meetings.
Head coach Chris Horpel be
lieves the meet will he a good chal
lenge for his team.
"They are a respectable team," he
said. "They were the Division II na
tional champions in IW7 and fin
ished high last year."
However. SFS has lost most of
the wrestlers from those champi
onship teams and comes into
today's match lacking in experi
ence and having to rely on sopho
mores and freshmen to fill the holes
in its lineup. The Dons are led by
four junior college transfers who

form the backbone of the team.
Leading off for the Dons at 125
lbs. is sophomore Max Schurkamp,
who transferred from Cal State-
Hakersfield and placed third in the
California High School Tourna
ment in the 1996-1997 season. He
will take on Stanford junior Rudy
Ruiz, who placed fourth at last
weekend's Cal Open. The two have
split their last two meetings, so this
looks to bo a great matchup.
Another tough match is at 133
lbs. when junior Zach Zimmerer
takes on junior college transfer
Kelly Martinez Jr.. Martinez took
fifth in last year's junior college
tournament but will have his hands
full with Zimmerer, who is coming
oil of a first-place performance in
the Cal Open.
Horpel is confident about his
team's readiness for tonight's
matchup. "We have put in some
hard work and we appear to have
some momentum after last week
end's showing." Horpel said. "Our
guys are ready."
I he heavier weights will be
tough for the Cardinal. Junior Tim
Kendall (184 lbs.) will battle junior
Steve Cooper, a transfer who took
fifth in last year's junior college
tournament.
At 285 lbs., redshirt freshman
