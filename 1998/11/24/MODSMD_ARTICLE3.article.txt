# Lag dining hall opening delayed again
## 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
For the third time this year, the re-opening date for the
kitchen at Lagunita Dining Hall has been pushed back.
Residents can now expect Lagunita's version of home
cooking to start up at the beginning of next quarter.
Although Housing and Dining Services most recently
speculated that the kitchen would be open by Nov. 20, the
construction still is not finished, according to Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Dining Services. The dining hall
currently serves food brought in from other dining halls'
kitchens.
Greg Gill, the owners' representative for University
Facilities Projects said that "although the Lagunita Din
ing area is presently in use, the kitchen, servery and Roble
dining areas are scheduled for completion in December.
Final fire alarm testing is scheduled for Dec. 14 to Dec. 17.
Training and mobilization efforts will then commence.
The full facility will open in January when the students re
turn from winter break."
According to Gill, the schedule delay is "due primari
ly to kitchen hood / grease duct coordination problems

that were unfortunately on the crit
ical path. This impacted the tile
flooring installation that held up
setting equipment and related fin
ishes. Additionally, exterior work
is also lagging the contractor's pre
vious schedule completion commit
ment."
Ciuy realizes that the current sit
uation is "frustrating for every
body, especially for residents who
have been very patient with a situa
tion that is not what they expected
or wanted.
"We regret the delay, but we re
ally can't control the situation.
And, although our staff has worked
hard to provide food for Lagunita
residents, it is not the same as it will
be when the dining hall is officially
up and running."
Junior Ayse Hortacsu is the res
ident computer coordinator in
Granada. She said that "even
though we have almost nothing for
breakfast and using plastic cups and
plates is annoying. Lag dining is still
better than Wilbur."
What Hortacsu looks forward to
most with the completion of the
dining hall is "longer hours during
which food will be available and
food on weekends."
Most Lagunita residents are in
different to the problem, but will be
relieved when food is cooked in
their dining hall and not brought in
from other places.
"It's not really that bad, but it
will be nice to have food that is not
shipped in. I don't really feel like

I'm getting my money's worth right
now," said senior Mikah Lightner.
Senior Whitney Lindahl, a resi
dent assistant in Granada, con
curred. "It hasn't really bothered
me. There have been some com
plaints from the freshmen, but,
overall, we're pretty used to it."
The practice of bringing food in
to Lagunita from other dining halls
has caused many people to go to
Florence Moore Hall for meals,
and the influx of extra residents at
Flo Mo dining has caused many
problems there with overcrowding.
Senior Camilla Lindsay, an RA
in Cardenal, describes the problem

It hasn't really bothered
me... we're pretty used to
it.'

as something that everyone seems
to be dealing with. "Yes, the situa
tion at Lag has created long lines in
Flo Mo dining which many resi
dents find inconvenient and, at
times, exasperating.
"However, I imagine that the in
eoavetii«nce is far greater for the
students who have to trek all the
way over here to get decent food."
Guy is very sympathetic to the
students' frustration and is also dis
appointed that Lagunita is not yet
open.
"I had hoped to have ended the
year with a proper holiday dinner,
but I'm pretty sure that won't hap
pen. There will be dinner but it will
have to be brought from some
where else."
