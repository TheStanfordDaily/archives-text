For the third time this year, the re-opening date for the
kitchen at Lagunita Dining Hall has been pushed back.
Residents can now expect Lagunita's version of home
cooking to start up at the beginning of next quarter.
Although Housing and Dining Services most recently
speculated that the kitchen would be open by Nov. 20, the
construction still is not finished, according to Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Dining Services. The dining hall
currently serves food brought in from other dining halls'
kitchens.
Greg Gill, the owners' representative for University
Facilities Projects said that "although the Lagunita Din
ing area is presently in use, the kitchen, servery and Roble
dining areas are scheduled for completion in December.
Final fire alarm testing is scheduled for Dec. 14 to Dec. 17.
Training and mobilization efforts will then commence.
The full facility will open in January when the students re
turn from winter break."
According to Gill, the schedule delay is "due primari
ly to kitchen hood / grease duct coordination problems
