## 
### Kenny Shei Contributing writer 
For the first time since Big Game Week
IW3, there was fire in the lake. Students walk
ing along the edge of Lake Lagunita at around
2:15 a.m. Saturday morning witnessed a bon
fire much larger than the official one on
Thursday night organized by the Stanford
Axe Committee in Arrillaga Plaza.
The fire was li. around 2:15 a.m.. witnesses
said, and the celebration was broken up by
police at around 3 a.m.. Between these times,
the fire drew a crowd of about 50 people.
The traditional lake bonfire has been
banned for the past few years by the Universi
ty. partly due to concerns over the lake being
a habitat for the tiger salamander.
Smaller, officially sanctioned bonfires
have been held in other locations, but the or
ganizers of this year's Lake Lag bonfire did
not seek permission from the University or
from police or fire officials.
There were no reports from witnesses of
any arrests when the police broke up the gath
ering. but Stanford Police had no comment on
the incident as of yesterday.
Most of the people in the crowd were
pleased with the larger size of the fire.
"The bonfire was so sweet! The win and
the bonfire really rounded up my last Big
Game weekend here at the Farm," said senior
Tim Chang, who spotted the bonfire as he
walked home with friends from the Moon
splash party at Whitman.

Because the fire was clearly visible from
the side of the lake, more students started to
gather along the edge of the lake, and also in
side the lake bed, several yards from the bon
fire. As the bonfire was burning, several stu
dents grabbed wood that was lying around
and threw it into the bonfire.
Eyewitnesses at the Saturday bonfire indi
cated that it was several times larger than the
fire at Thursday's Big Game Rally, which was
fueled by a cube of wooden pallets four feet
bv four feet by four feet.

"The [wood for the] bonfire in the lake was
about six feet high, and probably around eight
by eight at the base," estimated a freshman
who helped build the bonfire late Friday
night, who asked not to be named.
Beeause of the heat of the fire, the erowd in
the lake bed had to stay at least 15 feet away
from the bonfire to avoid being burned.
However, this did not stop people from
temporarily venturing eloser to throw more
wood into the fire.
"A group of four students had picked up a
nearby bench and were preparing to throw it


Early Saturday, students gathered at Lake Lagu
