# Students build Lake Lag bonfire Saturday
## 
### Kenny Shei Contributing writer 
For the first time since Big Game Week
IW3, there was fire in the lake. Students walk
ing along the edge of Lake Lagunita at around
2:15 a.m. Saturday morning witnessed a bon
fire much larger than the official one on
Thursday night organized by the Stanford
Axe Committee in Arrillaga Plaza.
The fire was li. around 2:15 a.m.. witnesses
said, and the celebration was broken up by
police at around 3 a.m.. Between these times,
the fire drew a crowd of about 50 people.
The traditional lake bonfire has been
banned for the past few years by the Universi
ty. partly due to concerns over the lake being
a habitat for the tiger salamander.
Smaller, officially sanctioned bonfires
have been held in other locations, but the or
ganizers of this year's Lake Lag bonfire did
not seek permission from the University or
from police or fire officials.
There were no reports from witnesses of
any arrests when the police broke up the gath
ering. but Stanford Police had no comment on
the incident as of yesterday.
Most of the people in the crowd were
pleased with the larger size of the fire.
"The bonfire was so sweet! The win and
the bonfire really rounded up my last Big
Game weekend here at the Farm," said senior
Tim Chang, who spotted the bonfire as he
walked home with friends from the Moon
splash party at Whitman.

Because the fire was clearly visible from
the side of the lake, more students started to
gather along the edge of the lake, and also in
side the lake bed, several yards from the bon
fire. As the bonfire was burning, several stu
dents grabbed wood that was lying around
and threw it into the bonfire.
Eyewitnesses at the Saturday bonfire indi
cated that it was several times larger than the
fire at Thursday's Big Game Rally, which was
fueled by a cube of wooden pallets four feet
bv four feet by four feet.

"The [wood for the] bonfire in the lake was
about six feet high, and probably around eight
by eight at the base," estimated a freshman
who helped build the bonfire late Friday
night, who asked not to be named.
Beeause of the heat of the fire, the erowd in
the lake bed had to stay at least 15 feet away
from the bonfire to avoid being burned.
However, this did not stop people from
temporarily venturing eloser to throw more
wood into the fire.

nearby bench and were preparing to throw it

into the bonfire. It would have
been horrible, because I had just
seen red flashing lights in the dis
tance. The guy standing next to me
finally ended up dissuading the
foursome from throwing the bench
into the fire," said a Stanford alum
nus, Class of '98, who declined to
give his name.
A witness, who asked only to be
identified as a coterminal student,
also saw the bonfire as he was re
turning from a party.
"It must have been almost 3 a.m.
when the police and fire depart
ment showed up. At that point, all
of the wood in the immediate area
was tossed in. The police let the lire
burn.
"One officer jokingly told us
that we couldn't roast our marsh
mallows while the others threat
ened to charge anyone who didn't
leave the area with starting the
fire," he said.
Though the response from most
those who were present was posi
tive, some students who were not
present at the impromptu bonfire
did not feel as though they missed
out on much.
"I grew up very close to Texas
A&M." another school with a tra
ditional bonfire, said senior Kim
('offey.
"I understand that the bonfire is
supposed to be a pep rally-type
event but so is [Big Game] Gai
eties. I had had enough school spir
it ... at Wednesday night's Gai
eties."

Some members of the Axe
Committee had mixed emotions
about the unofficial Lake Lag fire.
Axe Committee chair Mike Ce
ballos, a junior, was sorry that the
event was not legally sanctioned by
the University.
He added, "I'm proud of the stu
dents that took the initiative and
did what they believed in."
"The old bonfires drew up to
10.000 people, and pulled together
the whole student body. Dorms

from all across campus scheduled
building shifts on the day of the
bonfire. There isn't much which
unites the student body, except the
bonfire — the one tradition which
brought the whole campus together
and helped form a common identi
ty for Stanford students," ex
plained senior Matt Mramlage, last
year's Axe Committee chair.
"Now this pent-up energy and
excitement can only be expressed
in the now expected post game
melee," Mramlage continued.
"This is a horrible replacement
for a once proud tradition. We
should consider going back to what
works — what Stanford has been
doing successfully for over 60
years."
