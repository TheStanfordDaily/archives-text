# Presidential Lecturer:
## Soyinka calling for cultural integration 
### Dana Mulhauser Editorial staff 
Western universities will not be
complete until they learn to inte
grate other cultural traditions into
their studies, according to Wole
Soyinka. Soyinka, winner of the
1986 Nobel Prize for Literature,
will speak Monday at 7 p.m. in
Kresge Auditorium.
Soyinka said that American and
European universities need to
"stop modularizing, treating other
cultures as a marginal adjuncts to
Western thought. [Other cultures]
shouldn't be treated as exotica
They should be integrated into the
very development of Western phi
losophy."
Soyinka, who was born in Nige
ria, will speak on "Contemporary
Literature and the Future of Hu
manities and Arts" as part of the
Presidential Lecture Series.
"It's a question of universaliz
ing the canon," Soyinka said in an
interview. "There needs to be a
consciousness that Greek philoso
phy is linked with Arab, Asian and

Indian philosophy."
He called broadening fields of
study an "act of intellectual
courage" that no Western universi
ty does adequately.
"Efforts have been made peri
odically to try to make recogni
tions of other patterns of thought,
but they're always token efforts,"
he said. "They're mavericks;
they're never allowed to permeate
the character of the university."
Soyinka's writings reflect both
his traditional Nigerian back
ground and his Christian upbring
ing. He has been subject to criti
cism from both Europeans for the
African influences in his work and
Africans for the European influ
ence.
"I think that [criticism] is mar
velous," he said. "All it means is
that I'm my own person, and that I
consider absolutely no territory.,,
outside my boundary of knowl
edge."
He is, however, understanding
of African critics who consider his
writing "too white."
"On our side, it's not so much a
failing as a response to centuries of
domination. The process of ex
tracting yourself puts you through
a rejectionist phase. You want to
clean the slate. In a sense it's affir
mative action on your own behalf."
He emphasized, however, that
this African exclusivity "can only
be a tool, a phase," and that the ul
timate goal should still be to break
down cultural barriers.
Soyinka, a playwright, often
uses his works as forums to criticize
the corruption and oppressive
quality of the Nigerian govern
ment.
Political forces in Nigeria have
also disagreed with Soyinka's
ideas. He has undergone several
periods of exile as well as two years

of imprisonment, primarily as a re
sult of eriticizing the government.
He visited Nigeria last month,
marking the end of a four-year
exile. The current Nigerian regime,
which took over after the death of
dictator Sani Abacha in June, re
scinded Soyinka's expulsion.
Soyinka, though hopeful, is not en
tirely happy with the new regime,
which is scheduled to transition to a
democracy by 1999.
"What should be happening is a
government of national unity," he
said. "A sovereign national council
is needed after the tragedy of re
cent years. So many deaths have
thrust us backwards."
Soyinka sees the need for a truth
commission to uncover the atroci
ties committed under Abacha's
regime.
Truth commissions, which have
been established in nations such as
El Salvador, South Africa and
Guatemala during the transition to

democratic rule, enable societies to
come to terms with previous politi
cal atrocities.
"This regime has said its priority
is not [a truth commission], but
we'll set up our own anyway."
Soyinka pointed out that the truth
commission that he and his allies
are planning will have no govern
mental authority and thus will have
even more difficulty carrying out
its task than a recent government
run truth panel in South Africa.
Nevertheless, he said, "we
should begin gathering and record
ing testimony on the abuses before
they're gone."
He dismissed suggestions that
he might have a role in the new
government.
"My constituency is spread be
yond Nigerian borders, and I won
der whether it's better to be on the
outside going in or on the inside
going out."
Soyinka's international focus

now includes American culture
and politics, of which he is critical.
"The congress of an entire na
tion has put on pornography [in the
Clinton investigation]. It looks like
the Jerry Springer Show. It shows
that the culture has been debased."
Soyinka, a professor of arts at
Emory University, blamed this cul
tural breakdown on the distinigra
tion of "privacy in the name of ex
posure, because [Americans think]
exposure is knowledge and knowl
edge is good."
Soyinka called this new empha
sis on sensationalism the "culture
of the instant guru."
He stressed the need to "use the
humanities as ,a corrective of this
cultural suicide."
Soyinka, however, has no plans
to move out of the United States.
For now, his future plans include
"fulfilling [his] international oblig
ations and finding the leisure to
drink some wine."
