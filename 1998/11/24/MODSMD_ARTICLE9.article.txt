### Anitha Reddy 
Claude Buss, professor emeritus
of history and a key American diplo
mat in the Phillippines during World
War 11, died on Tuesday, Nov. 17 in
his Palo Alto home.
Buss, who came to Stanford in
1946, taught courses on U.S. foreign
policy and Far Eastern issues.
"He did more than anyone else to
bring awareness of the importance of
Far Eastern history to the student
body and the university," said
Wayne Vucinich, professor emeritus
of history.
Buss's scholarly interests in the
Far East were complemented by ex
tensive experience in foreign service.
As executive assistant to the U.S.
High Commissioner in the Philip
pines, the Japanese interned Buss for
two years because he would not sur
render the whole of the Philippines.
As an expert in Far Eastern stud
ies, Buss advised the War Depart
ment for its Strategic Bombing Sur
vey of Japan, served as a civilian con
sultant in the information and educa
tion section of Gen. Douglas
Mac Arthur's staff for the Allied Oc
cupation Forces in Japan and was a
special Southeast Asia consultant to
the U.S. embassy in Japan in the af
termath of WWII.
Buss spoke fluent Chinese, Japan
ese, French, German and Spanish.
In 1%8, the State Department
honored Buss for his "devoted ser
vice to the cause of Philippine-
American friendship and under
standing for more than a quarter of a
century."
He gained prominence during the
Vietnam War when he warned Pres
ident Lyndon Johnson about the
risks of an escalating conflict in
Southeast Asia.

Although Buss possessed an im
pressive career resume, Vucinich
said, "He will probably be remem
bered most for his pedagogical and
teaching skills."
Buss began teaching in 1934 at the
University of Southern California.
From USC, he moved to Stanford
and then to San Jose State Universi
ty, where he received a prize each
year of his tenure for excellence in
teaching.
In 1977, he was named acting
dean of academic affairs at the Mon
terey Institute of Foreign Studies.
Students were still being bussed to
his home in the last months of his life
to hear him speak.
History Prof. Gordon Chang
praised Buss for his "ability to bring a
vitality to his teaching from his extra
ordinarily varied diplomatic career."
Vucinich noted that although
some feel that history classes are cur
rently declining in popularity. Buss's
history classes "were always bursting
with size and energy."
"Alumni always remember their
courses with Claude Buss," said
Lyman VanSlyke, a modern China
expert and history professor emeri
tus who regularly travels with Stan
ford alumni groups.
Buss' rapport with his students
was widely praised. Vucinich re
called when Buss telephoned him
one evening and said, "I'm cooking a
spaghetti dinner for 30 students. 1
need some help."
Buss was widely published on the
subject of diplomacy and the Far
East and completed his last book
shortly before his death.
For Vucinich, the usual campus
debate about professors as good
teachers or good scholars did not
apply to Buss. "He was both," he
said.
