Jonathan Richman • I'm So Confused
Eccentric singer/songwriter, former Modern Lovers frontman
Jonathan Richman's latest, I'm So Confused, is an eclectic album that sounds
like his early demos all over again. Bringing his '60s garage and Velvet
Underground influences with him, he forges new ground in the '90s. Richman's
quirky delivery and tongue-in-cheek lyrics remain faithful to his sound.
Jonathan knows what he's doing by now and gracefully, the proto-punk
has been left to his own devices.
