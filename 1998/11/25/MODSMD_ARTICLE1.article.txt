# Med students lobby Stanford to renovate aging facilities
## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Tired of problems with antiquat
ed facilities, medical students are
out to update their school's 1950 -
era structure.
The Stanford Medical Students

Association now leads the endeav
or. SMSA President Marion Henry
and the group's executive commit
tee are attempting to present a uni
fied front to the University in pur
suit of the renovation of their
school.
"The students are currently tak

ing a highly responsible approach
— attempting to make sure that the
faculty is informed about the is
sues," said Elliott Wolfe, associate
dean and director of the Office of
Student Affairs. "I'm a big support
er of their efforts."
Jean Drouin and Mike Ennen,
both veteran medical students,
began the effort by creating a pre
sentation that they have delivered
before the Faculty Senate and. most
recently, a large number of other
medical students and professors.
Phyllis Gardner, senior associate
dean for education and student af
fairs, one of the major proponents
of the students' efforts, has also
given a version of their presentation
to the Board of Trustees of the
Medical School.
According to Gardner, the pre
sentation made a strong impression,
especially statistics comparing Stan
ford to the medical schools at Har
vard and UCSF. A particularly
pointed graphic showed that out of

1 (K) students accepted to Harvard,
UCSF and Stanford, only four
chose to attend Stanford.
At a meeting last week medical
students reacted very supportively
to the issues that Drouin and Ennen
raised. Problems with the library
and a lack of a real entrance to the
medical school, updated technolo
gy and an innovative curriculum
drew the most audience response.
"After the students have made
certain that both basic science and
clinical science faculty are in
formed, they plan to take their case
to the University," Wolfe said.
The issues with the School of
Medicine that the students seek to
address extend beyond the facili
ties. However, the money necessary
to make the expedient changes is
not the problem, for once.
"Funding will not be the prob
lem," Gardner said at last week's
meeting. "If we can get approval to

build, we can get the money."
Much of the problem lies with
the University's General Use Plan,
which only allows for 400,(HX) more
square feet of construction before a
new one is negotiated in 2001.
Competition for that space from
lobbies such as graduate housing
makes it difficult to obtain permis
sion to start construction.
The City of Menlo Park, the bor
der of which is quite close to the
School of Medicine, also lobbies
hard to prevent the school's campus
from expanding. Menlo Park offi
cials could not be reached for com

ment on this specific plan.
Other medical schools of the
same caliber are experiencing simi
lar difficulties.
"Our needs have outstripped our
capital," said Jason Mavis, associate
vice chancellor of facilities at UCSF.
"We've just built a new power plant,
but we're working on air condition
ing. bathrooms and other projects."
Mavis, who worked at Stanford's
medical school from 1976 until 1983,
said that UCSF is also forced to
work with a space ceiling.
"Our expansion contract is nego
tiated with local residents," said
Mavis. "It's to the point where we
have to tear something down every
time we want to build anything
new."
