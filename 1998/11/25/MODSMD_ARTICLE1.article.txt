Tired of problems with antiquat
ed facilities, medical students are
out to update their school's 1950 -
era structure.
The Stanford Medical Students

Association now leads the endeav
or. SMSA President Marion Henry
and the group's executive commit
tee are attempting to present a uni
fied front to the University in pur
suit of the renovation of their
school.
"The students are currently tak

— attempting to make sure that the
faculty is informed about the is

ford to the medical schools at Har
vard and UCSF. A particularly
pointed graphic showed that out of

UCSF and Stanford, only four
chose to attend Stanford.
At a meeting last week medical
students reacted very supportively
to the issues that Drouin and Ennen
raised. Problems with the library
and a lack of a real entrance to the
medical school, updated technolo
gy and an innovative curriculum
drew the most audience response.
"After the students have made
certain that both basic science and
clinical science faculty are in
formed, they plan to take their case
to the University," Wolfe said.
The issues with the School of
Medicine that the students seek to
address extend beyond the facili

to make the expedient changes is
not the problem, for once.
"Funding will not be the prob

meeting. "If we can get approval to
