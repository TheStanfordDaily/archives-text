# Dead pigs found in campus dumpster
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Stanford police are searching for
a would-be surgeon who has left
three pig carcasses on campus in the
past three weeks. The culprit could
face charges of illegal dumping.
The dead pigs, which apparently
were being used for practice in arte
rial bypass surgery, were each found
wrapped in plastic in a dumpster
outside the Environmental Safety
Facility on Stock Farm Road, ac
cording to Stanford Police Lt. Del
Handy. Police think the pigs were
dropped off at the end of each of the
past three weeks.
Investigators say they have ruled
out a ritual slaughter. The last pig
was found wrapped with scalpel
packaging material, and all showed
evidence of medical surgery.
"On all three of the pigs the same
procedures had been performed,"
Bandy said. "They had done some

work on the hind legs consistent with
someone who would be doing vascu
lar work on the legs."
Comparative Medicine Prof.
Cilen Otto, Stanford's attending vet
erinarian, was asked by police to
perform a necropsy — the animal
version of an autopsy — on the last
pig found.
"We found that the incisions that
were there were consistent with car
diovascular research work," he said.
The necropsy did not turn up any
evidence as to where the pigs came
from, however.
"Most pigs (used in research)
come from a similar breeding stock
that farm hogs do," Otto said, noting
that the pigs found were "conven
tional swine" and not easily trace
able to one source.
Police are trying to find a possible
source in the area.
"We're talking to pig vendors and
filtering out who in this area is get
ting pigs for research and medical

training," Bandy said. "There are
not that many people that get pigs."
()tto said that pigs are "a valuable
model for [research and develop
ment] in cardiovascular studies," be
cause a pig's heart and cardiovascu
lar system closely resemble a
human's.
Police say the pigs are not part of
any University experiments, be
cause the animals were not marked
with the identifying tattoo that
shows they are part of a University
project. The police are speculating
that the dumper was trying to avoid
disposal costs for the pigs.
"They shouldn't be disposing of
the pigs this way," Bandy said.
"Stanford medical protocol is very
strict."
The pigs were discovered by Car
ole Hyde, a project associate at the
Center for International Security
and Cooperation and a founding
member of the Stanford Cat Net
work. As part of the network, she

helps feed stray cats near the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility.
"On three consecutive Saturday
mornings I found a pig wrapped in
plastic in the dumpster," she said.
If found, the perpetrator could be
charged with a misdemeanor and
fined up to $3,000 or he placed in
county jail for up to six months.
Although Bandy is pursuing the
case currently, he hopes the perpe
trator now understands the criminal
nature of his or her actions.
"It'd be nice if they'd call me up
and say they'd not do it any more,"
he said.
"It'd be nice to be able to devote
my time to other criminal matters in
stead of looking for dead pigs."
The Stanford Cat Network and
the Palo Alto Humane Society, of
which Hyde is president, are offering
a $1,000 reward to the individual
who gives information leading to the
conviction of the perpetrator on
charges of animal cruelty.
