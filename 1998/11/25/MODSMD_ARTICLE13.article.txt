# America Online buys Netscape

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — America Online Inc.,
the computer online service that naysayers once
said would surely be crushed by Microsoft or the
Internet, emerged as a newly formidable competi
tor Tuesday with its deal to buy Netscape Com
munications Corp.
The $4.21 billion merger could fundamentally
alter the balance of power on the Internet.
While AOL is already the world's largest Inter
net access and online service provider, the deal
gives the company important advantages in its
battle with Microsoft Corp. to dominate the main
Internet sites where people get information and
buy goods and services.
Together, Netscape's and AOL's sites reach a
staggering 70 percent of all people who access the
Internet, according to Netßatings, a research firm.
The deal also underscores the popularity of

Netscape's Navigator software for browsing the
Internet, despite the meteoric rise of Microsoft's
rival Internet Explorer — a crucial concern in the
U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft and its chairman. Bill Gates.
Microsoft lawyers argued Tuesday that the
AOL-Nctscape deal backed up their claim that
Microsoft is simply a player in an extremely com
petitive software market and not, as the govern
ment claims, a monopolist trying to crush its rivals.
The merger also is a vindication for Steve Case,
40, the boyish-looking chairman of AOL.
Just a few years ago, AOL was ridiculed for
supplying its own proprietary online entertain
ment and information to subscribers at a time
when people could get a far wider choice on the
Internet. Last year, a surge in usage across AOL's
network triggered massive bottlenecks.

Case, realizing AOL's limitations, wants to
dramatically step up his Web presence by using
Netscape's Web sites and software.
Case said there won't be a immediate change
for consumers. But he eventually plans to give
AOL's 14 million subscribers easy links to
Netscape's Net Center Web site, a portal to ser
vices and information geared toward businesses.
A second plan is to use Netscape's software to
eventually create a new AOL browser that makes
it easier for people to view and retrieve Web infor
mation. For now, however, AOL will continue to
use Microsoft's browser.
AOL's expansion also could help it compete
with other portal companies such as Yahoo! Inc.,
and new rivals such as cable-TV and phone com
panies, which hope to soon provide much higher
speed service to the Internet than AOL.
