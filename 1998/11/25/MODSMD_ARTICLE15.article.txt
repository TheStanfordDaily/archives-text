If we want a gathering place
on campus, why will it be
selling us tickets to Cancun?

Thanksgiving has most of us
thinking about food. Accordingly, I
was thinking about food Monday
night when I went to the Corner Pocket at
6:45 pjn. to pick up some pizza.
Usually, the Corner Pocket stays open
until 10 p.m. For some reason, though, the
Corner Pocket was closing early that night
and there was no pizza left. It was 6:45 at
night on a college campus, and there was no
place to get a slice of pizza without driving
to University Avenue. Sure, Polio's and the
Coffee House were open, but the wait at
Polio's is at least 15 minutes, and getting a
meal at the Coffee House requires queuing
in line for 10 minutes and then waiting
another 20 minutes for food.
It seems quite bizarre for a "hub of stu
dent activity" to provide only one fast-food
option at dinner time on a weeknight. It
would be logical for Tresidder to offer a
cheaper, more student-friendly restaurant
to compete with Polio Rey, the Coffee
House and the Corner Pocket. We have a
Jamba Juice; why not a Burger King?
This is an especially necessary service for
students without cars. To get any kind of
fast food, we have to drive off campus.
Driving off campus takes at least 15 to 20
minutes, and the point of getting fast food is
Ibst.
The cost factor is even more crucial. A
chicken burrito at Polio's is around $4.(X).
At Taco Bell, burritos are $1.49 apiece.
While the Polio's burritos might be bigger,
you can still get two chicken burritos along
with a 69-cent bean burrito at Taco Bell for
less money. Those burritos also get served

a lot quicker at Taco Bell.
Jamba Juice, the Coffee House, Polio's
and the Corner Pocket are excellent estab
lishments. They have their place at Tresid
der, and their popularity attests to student
approval. But for a vast number of students
with diverse eating habits, more food
options are preferable. Different places to
meet different cravings would make Tresid
der a truly diverse place, and may make it
more attractive to students.
The Tresidder Advisory Board recently
had the opportunity to help make this
dream come true.
The departure of American Express
made space available on the top floor of
Tresidder. While students would have been
required to walk up a flight of stairs to get
burgers, a fast-food restaurant would have
been a far wiser and more thoughtful choice
to fill the second-floor space than Adven
ture Travel, another travel agency.
Students might use Adventure Travel a
couple times a year to book flights home or
to plan vacations in Cancun for spring
break. But it is important to note that Palo
Alto is the proud home of many travel
agencies, six of which are located in the
Town and Country Mall and on University
Avenue.
For reasons of convenience, time, and
money, our campus needs another fast-food
restaurant.
While it may not be as important as hav
ing an incredible bookstore and a BASS
ticket agency, a new fast-food restaurant
would benefit a lot of people. The lines at
all restaurants on campus would be shorter
at lunchtime, and the Coffee House and
Polio's might speed up their service to draw
back customers. It would be a win-win-win
situation for students, the University and
the new restaurant.
