## Double-clicking for the holidays 
### 
The holidays
are upon us, and it
is time for us to
give thanks, spend time
with family and reflect on
the odd ways in which we
celebrate the winter sea
son.

Talk of the Thanksgiving holiday con
jures classic imagery of rural America. In
the Heartland, Mother spends Thanksgiv
ing Day basting and roasting the succulent
bird, while Father is out picking the best
ears of corn from the crop field. The
charm of this picture of Americana dissi
pates quickly as Mother spends Friday
morning with her grimy SOS pads, and
Father drives his tractor unceremoniously
to the general store to stock up on Oval
tine. Not surprisingly, Norman Rockwell
paintings depicting these banal scenes are
the least popular of the artist's work.
In contrast, a California Thanksgiving
dinner involves less bird and more tofu
alternatives. I have nothing against tofu
itself, but I am puzzled by the people who
sculpt it into the shape of the food item it
is supposed to replace. Call me old-fash
ioned, call me closed-minded, but mold
ing soy-bean products into the form of a
dead fowl simultaneously fails to comfort
the meat-eaters in the crowd and thor
oughly disgusts the adamant vegetarians.
These regional differences aside, most
people have similar Thanksgiving experi
ences, and everyone agrees that the occa
sion yields an aggravating amount of holi
day traffic. Thankfully, in the future,
advances in science will eliminate the has
sles of Thanksgiving travel. Friends and
extended family will teleconference to their
host's home over the Internet, taking
advantage of the latest in Web video tech

nology. Guests will be able to freely con
verse with one another vocally, while handy
pull-down menus and special keyboard
commands will serve as convenient short
cuts for requesting more mashed potatoes
or buttered rolls. Some less common
requests will not be preprogrammed into
the software, but a quick double-click on
the image of the dinner offerings will make
saying "Please pass the yams" a snap. The
virtual meal will be savory and delicious
and, in the future, there will be no tofu.
As delightful as ritualized eating is, the
best part about Thanksgiving weekend for
many of us is that it marks the beginning
of the winter shopping season. On T-Day
plus-one, malls across the country become
as stuffed as the bellies of the customers
that fill them. Unfortunately, the mall
environment has become increasingly
crowded and hostile, robbing gross con
sumerism of its distinctive pleasure and
Orange Juliuses of their satisfying, sooth
ing flavor.
Once again, technology comes to our
rescue. The newest innovation in Ameri
can retail is the introduction of electronic
commerce, or e-commerce. Computer
savvy consumers can buy holiday gifts
over the Web and have them delivered
directly to their homes with little fuss and
complete anonymity. The Web is great for
purchasing books and music, and it is ideal
for ordering slinky items of lingerie for
yourself, your partner or your anthropo
morphically well-endowed pets. There is
no reason to feel embarrassed any more.
And the e-market is expanding uncon
trollably. Now any idiot with a server, a
registered Internet domain name, a
knowledge of CGI scripts, a familiarity
with HTML, a bit of venture capital and a
master's degree in business can set up

shop on the Web.
Unfortunately, this mode of shopping
sterilizes the entire gift selection process.
Presents lack that special hand-picked
quality, and the act of giving seems to lose
some of its meaning. Not that the recipi
ents always appreciate the effort put into
selecting their gifts. Even the most ethical
members of our community are guilty of
taking unwanted gifts and passing them
on to others.
Of course, this naughty little practice is
a bad habit to develop. While recycling
fruitcake gifts is a well-established tradi
tion, my particular circle of friends has
spent the last decade playing the hot
potato game with a " '70s Frat Rock"
compilation CD. The gift has cycled
through our group at least three times
now, but the CD has never been opened.
Our commitment to the recycling game
has become so ardent that we each have
independently vowed against opening the
CD as a matter of principle, in spite of our
special fondness for Boston's timeless hit
"More Than a Feeling."
As the holiday madness approaches, 1
quiver at the prospect of having to dis
tribute numerous presents and consume
an obscene quantity of turkey in order to
express appreciation for my friends and
family. Isn't a verbal affirmation of my
unconditional love a better gift? Proba
bly. Especially now that I've discovered
that I own a copy of " 70s Frat Rock: Vol
ume Two."

Eugene Park, a master's student in philoso
phy, refuses to explain how a virtual dinner
over the Web would be possible. "It would
require a high-speed T1 line and a stream
ing food connection," he said, as he waved
his hands.
