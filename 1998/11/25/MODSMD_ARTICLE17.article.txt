Aim for sportsmanship
This year's Big Game was my 10th.
When I attended the Michigan Business
School 1 flew back to watch Stanford beat
Cal in 1995 and 19%, and 1 have always been
proud of Stanford and all it represents.
I was delighted to see our students jump
onto the field to celebrate with the team
after the miracle 10-to-3 win.
I believe that the fans of the winning
team should be allowed to celebrate with
their team, but they should not destroy
property.
I also believe that the losing team's fans
should just leave the stadium. It seems to me
that this is what happened in 1993 and 1994,
but for whatever reason, this has not hap
pened for the last three or four games.
I used to love our taunting signs and ban
ners. I saw a few on Saturday, and 1 thought
they were humorous.
However, this year I had the privilege of
getting seats near the Cal students.
For whatever reason, many of the Cal
students are bitter and envious. Why? Who
knows. I think Cal is a good school. Don't

they?
Still, I would like to discourage the use of
those types of banners at future games.
We know Stanford is great; apparently
they are smart enough to know it too.
Although I feel that Cal students were
responsible for the injuries to the law
enforcement officers, I cannot claim that
Stanford students were pure and innocent.
The signs and the taunting have got to stop,
at least until most Cal students feel better
about their school.
You may think it was innocent fun, but
our fun was paid for by the hard-working
law enforcement officers who tried to hold
back those violent Cal students.
I always want to be proud of my alma
mater.
If we win. celebrate, but do not taunt. If
we lose, just leave the stadium.
Remember, next year we will want the
field to look good for the national audience
and the potential football and basketball
recruits watching the contest between Stan
ford and Notre Dame.
