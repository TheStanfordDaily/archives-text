# Deep Thoughts

MY PARENTS ALWAYS try to
come up with themes for Thanks
giving. They used to make us play
the "I'm thankful for..game each year,
and they usually wanted us to focus on what
we appreciated about other family mem
bers.
Unfortunately, with five kids, the expres
sions of gratitude often got sarcastic.
There were a few sincere comments like,
"I'm thankful for a brother who can pass
King Koopa for me on Super Mario Broth
ers, so I can beat the game and save the
princess," but more often they veered
toward, "I'm thankful for Brittney, so my
friends and I always have someone to make
fun of.' 1
So now in honor of Turkey Day and my
parents' attempts to instill gratitude in me,
I'd like to share the thoughts of a randomly
surveyed population on what they are grate
ful for here at Stanford. We tried not to get
sarcastic:
I'm thankful that unlike Christmas, Hal
loween, Valentine's Day, and just about
every other holiday. Thanksgiving hasn't
been brutally commercialized. You don't

have to buy presents, you don't have to dec
orate, you just have to eat. The activities
associated with the holiday have stayed
almost constant since its inception. People
just gather with friends and family and cele
brate the harvest, although it's now a Safe
way harvest and we don't wear funny Puri
tan hats â€” at least not in my family.
I'm thankful that when we lose football
games we don't start tearing up our own
field to throw at the winning team. Nor do
we hurl our own shoes at other students so
that we have to walk home barefoot.
I'm thankful for the plethora of on-cam
pus housing options that we have. We don't
have the hassle of finding an apartment, col
lecting rent from roommates, finding sub
leasers for the summer and all the other
stuff the University takes care of for us. I'm
glad that someone else cleans our toilets
and cooks really good meals.
I'm thankful for the Avanti chef Tony.
I'm thankful that my draw number was 144.
I'm thankful that I don't live in Loro again.
Just kidding. Suites is overrated.
I'm thankful for the many exciting
opportunities that housing assignment gives

us, like getting to know random roommates
who microwave eggs at 4:00 a.m. and the
chance to live in Rinconada as a junior.
Speaking of food, I'm very thankful for
it. I'm grateful for cookie dough, pickles,
nacho cheese, cookie dough and Sunday
brunch.
I'm thankful for toothpaste. Clean teeth
feel very nice. Floss is cool too.
I'm thankful for the Back Street Boys.
After New Kids on the Block broke up and
I heard that Johnny, the cute one, had a
lurid affair with the Nelson twins, I felt a
void in my life. What pop wonder could I do
the running-man to? Fortunately the Back
Street Boys have come to my rescue.
I'm thankful for the amazing generosity
found in Stanford students. The other day I
helped a friend collect donations for flood
victims in Honduras and Nicaragua. At first
I was hesitant to go to strangers or acquain
tances' doors to ask for money. But people
were so positive, friendly and generous; it
made me feel warm and fuzzy.
I'm thankful for cookie dough.
I'm thankful for the large amount of
freak shows found on this campus. Just go

to Meyer library, social dance events or
Jenkins 101 and be entertained. I can't even
describe it. One must observe first-hand.
I'm thankful for the 24-hour study room.
I like to make out under the tables there.
And in the south mezzanine.
I'm thankful for "Saved by the Bell."
From the early junior high episodes with
Miss Bliss through the drama at Bayside
High, all the way through the college years,
I found positive role models to pattern my
life after. I learned from Lisa how to dress,
from Kelly Kapowski how to tease my hair
and from Jesse Spano how to take uppers to
get into Stanford.
I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm
so ... scared.
I'm thankful for J. Crew. I want to live
inside a J. Crew catalog and wear pastel
merino wool sweater-sets all the time and
play in the snow with hot guys.
I'm thankful for inflatable animals, espe
cially penguins. They're fun to dance with.
And whisper sweet nothings to. Especially
inflatable "love-ewes."
I'm thankful for Channel 7. And the fish
channel. Whenever I miss my old friend

Swimmy, I flip on the TV, put "Under the
Sea" on "repeat" and cry.
I'm thankful for an administration that is
willing to sing, dance and be goofy on stage
in Gaieties.
I'm thankful for Monday afternoons
when the ice cream man comes.
I'm thankful for our awesome basketball
team, even though our eight-person draw
group has one season ticket to share.
I'm thankful for cookie dough.
I'm thankful that our campus is small
enough that a student can survive without a
car. I'm grateful that parking is so abundant
by Suites.
I'm thankful for e-mail, so I can tell my
roommate when she has a phone call.
So much to be grateful for, so little time.
I hope with these inspirational thoughts we
can all remember the many things in life to
be thankful for. Let's eat turkey and cele
brate Thanksgiving all year round.

Brittney Jensen is a senior majoring in
interdisciplinary English. She is thankful
for her family, her suitemates, crack and
cookie dough.
