## NCAA MEN'S SOCCER PLAYOFFS Card hosts USD in 2nd round 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
Looking to continue its winning
ways, the No. 9 Stanford men's soc
cer team (15-4-2) will play host to
the University of San Diego (12-8)
Saturday night at New Maloney
Field.
After capturing its first postsea
son win ever on Saturday in a
thrilling 3-2 triple-overtime victory
against San Jose State, Stanford will

host its second tournament game in a
row.
The second round is further than
any other Cardinal soccer team has
ever advanced. Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark maintains that the pres
sure on his team will have decreased
after the victory.
"The first game of the playoffs is
always the hardest. The first has all
the excitement," he said. "From my
experience, the further they go, it be
comes a routine — bv the second

game it is back to business as usual."
Senior captain A.J. Sauer elabo
rated on Bobby Clark's sentiments.
"Since [the first playoff win| was
such a hurdle for our program, the
added pressure will go away," Sauer
said. "From here on out, we want to
keep the momentum going."
Keeping the season alive will be
more difficult every game, as is the
case in any postseason tournament.
But the stronger the opponent, the
stronuer the drive of the Cardinal.

"We are more and more motivat
ed to have the preparation perfect for
each game," said redshirt sophomore
goalie Adam Zapala. " The team is
really focused on each game, and we
are so excited for this weekend."
Tempering the excitement, how
ever, is incredible team discipline. In
last Saturday's marathon against the
Spartans, it was discipline that
proved to be the key to victory.

MEN'S SOCCER

■ Saturday: NCAA Second Round
— No. 9 Stanford (15-4-2) vs. USD
(12-8), 7 p.m. New Maloney Field.
"It would have been easy to have
panicked [against SJS]," Bobby
Clark said. "But they kept together
as a group and kept doing the right
things."
In practice, the team's drive has
been a large factor as well, and will
remain important for the match
against the Toreros.
Success "will depend on our
preparation this week," Zapala said.
"At this point, the key is for each in
dividual, within the bigger unit, to be
prepared properly for each game.
That will be the key in practice."
On the field, team leadership
stems from senior center midfielders
Simon Elliott and Shan Gaw. The
two kept the Cardinal, running
throughout the 125-minute San Jose
game and will play important roles
against the Toreros. Elliott has a
team-leading six goals and seven as
sists, and Gaw follows with six as
sists.
Also critical to the Cardinal's suc
cess all season has been the team's
defense. Zapala's .52 goals-against
average is a credit to his solid play in

the goal, as well as the 10 players in
the field in front of him. Senior Jamie
Clark and freshman Lee Morrison
provide a virtual wall in the middle,
while the outside defenders in juniors
Gerard Davis and Andy Hem
merich, along with redshirt sopho
more Chris Gores, are also immense
along the flanks. Jamie Clark and
Morrison have also provided their
share of offense, both specializing in
short-range goals off set pieces, with
five and four goals, respectively.
The Toreros enter the game rid

ing the momentum of winning the
West Coast Conference Tourna
ment and a first round 2-1 upset of
No. 7 seed Cal State-Fullerton. The
Cardinal played the Fullerton Titans
to a 1-1 tie earlier this season.
Against the Titans, the Toreros
took an early lead with a goal in the
second minute of the game.
Fullerton equalized in the second
half and appeared to have control of
the game until San Diego junior An

Senior defender Jamie Clark, who has managed to score five goals while anchoring the Cardinal's de
fense, will look to lead Stanford past USD and into the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament.
