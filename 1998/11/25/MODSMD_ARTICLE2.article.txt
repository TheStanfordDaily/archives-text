Take one last whiff of the Band
Shak. or what's left of it, while you
still can. For come Dec. 7, the famed
rehearsal hall and hangout of the in
famous Stanford Band will be lev
eled to make room for a new alumni
center.
The Band will not be without a
home, however. A wing of Encina
Gym, the former home of the Ath
letics Department, will become the
new Shak.
"Housing them is difficult be
cause of the noise they'll make, but
we were as accommodating as we
could be," said Dan Rogers, owner's
representative for Capital Planning

and Management and member of the
group overseeing the demolition.
Unfortunately, Encina Gym isn't
currently prepared to accommodate
the Band. A temporary building has
been set up across from the Shak to
provide them with a place to practice,
while the Hand's office has moved to
a room in Encina Gym.
Jon Stemmle, the new band man
ager, said the Band will not be able to
completely move into Encina Gym
for another year or year and a half.
The current Band Shak was orig
inally a steam plant. Later, it housed
part of the ROTC program on cam
pus before the Band acquired it in
1973 after their first Shak was demol
