# Band Shak comes down on Dec. 7
## 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
Take one last whiff of the Band
Shak. or what's left of it, while you
still can. For come Dec. 7, the famed
rehearsal hall and hangout of the in
famous Stanford Band will be lev
eled to make room for a new alumni
center.
The Band will not be without a
home, however. A wing of Encina
Gym, the former home of the Ath
letics Department, will become the
new Shak.
"Housing them is difficult be
cause of the noise they'll make, but
we were as accommodating as we
could be," said Dan Rogers, owner's
representative for Capital Planning

and Management and member of the
group overseeing the demolition.
Unfortunately, Encina Gym isn't
currently prepared to accommodate
the Band. A temporary building has
been set up across from the Shak to
provide them with a place to practice,
while the Hand's office has moved to
a room in Encina Gym.
Jon Stemmle, the new band man
ager, said the Band will not be able to
completely move into Encina Gym
for another year or year and a half.
The current Band Shak was orig
inally a steam plant. Later, it housed
part of the ROTC program on cam
pus before the Band acquired it in
1973 after their first Shak was demol

The Band Shak will be torn down next week. The Band has moved
into temporary quarters across the street.
ished.
They devoted a great deal of time
to personalizing it.
"My most distinctive memory of
the Shak would have to be the first
time I walked in; 1 was in awe of how
cool the place was," said freshman
Band member and tuba player Erie
Altman.
The Band is doing everything pos
sible to preserve the aura of the Shak.
Last Monday was the last rehearsal in
the building, and afterwards they
began removing what they wanted to
keep.
Examples of what they took with
them are their innumerable road
signs stolen from road trips across the
country and around the world which

say things like "Nursing Home
Crossing", "Car Wash: The Best
Hand Job in Burlingame" and"It is
illegal to steal road signs." Other
Band members removed couches,
doors, and entire walls.
Pieces of the Shak and decora
tions from it will not keep current and
past Band members from missing it.
"It's the only place on campus
where you could leave a mark of
yourself and come back years later
and it [would) still be there," said for
mer Band manager Claire Bacher in
Aug. 2()'s Stanford Weekly.
Band members agree that when
the wrecking crews move into demol
ish the Shak, it will be the end of an
era, and they will cherish memories
formed in the Shak.
"The building embodied the
Band," said junior ( hris I lendcrson,
the current Stanford Free. "It was as

odoriferous, destructive and just
plain odd as the Band is."
"I feel so fortunate that I spent a
season in the Shak. I feel had for next
year's frosh," said Altman.
The Hand first heard rumors of
the Shak s pending demolition after
graduation last spring, and they re
ceived confirmation that it would be
destroyed this fall when they were on
tour in China last July. They asked
that demolition he delayed until after
this football season, and the Univer
sity complied with their request.
The Shak and the adjoining
(ialvez 1 louse would have had to be
earthquake-retrofitted or come
down by 2(XX) because the buildings
do not meet Santa Clara County
earthquake regulations.
The Alumni Association and the
Office of Development will move
into a new building on the site.
