Sophomore middle blocker Jen

Robyn Lewis was given honorable
mention. Freshman outside hitter
Michelle Chambers and freshman
middle blocker Sara Sandrik were
named to the conference All-Fresh
man team.
Walsh did not lead the conference
in kills, and in fact trailed Oregon's
Madeline Ernst by more than 2(X).
But she was second in the Pac-10 in
hitting percentage, with a .388 aver
age, and second in digs per game,
with 3.2.
"[The award] is an indication of
the kind of all-around player she is,"
Coach Don Shaw said. "She hasn't
taken nearly as many swings as the
big hitters have, but she's had a
tremendous year. She's up there in
digs, she's got a lot of blocks, she can
set for us if we need her to and she's
got a great hitting percentage."
Shaw pointed out that her high hit
ting percentage is even more note
worthy considering she is an outside
hitter. According to Shaw, it is much

easier for a middle blocker to have a
high average because most of their
kills come off of quick sets, which are
hard to defend. But an outside hitter
receives a higher set, meaning the de
fense usually knows what's coming.
Because of this, only one other out
side hitter, USC's Jennifer Kessy, was
in the top 10 in hitting percentage, but
she was six spots behind Walsh.
Walsh said the only reason she
thinks she won the award is because
of her all-around game, something
she prides herself on.
"If you're going to be the best, you
have to be good at every facet of the
game," she said. "You have to be a
good hitter, a good blocker, a good
defender. You have to be able to do
everything.
"But there are so many good play
ers out there that I'm not sure I de
serve it. It's kind of a surprise."
Although Walsh has long been
thought of as one of the best, if not the
best, player in the nation, this award
was not expected by everyone. Walsh
has had shoulder problems through
out the season and has not been the
contributor she has been in the past.
However, she has been able to over
come her injury to be named Pac-10
Player of the Week twice and to lead
the team to its fifth-straight Pac-10
title.
"My shoulder has been so frustrat
ing," Walsh said. "I haven't had one
healthy year here. But. it's just great
to earn this award."
Although Detmer was named to
the conference All-Freshman team
last season, she was never put in the
spotlight as seniors Barbara Ifejika
and Paula McNamee took up time in
front of her. However, this season,
Detmer has come into her own.
Detmer led the Cardinal with 318
kills, was fourth in the Pac-10 with a
.355 hitting percentage, was second in
the conference with 1.59 blocks per
game, and was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week in early September.
Though Detmer was not over
powering last season. Shaw said he

was not surprised to see her blossom
this season.
"We wouldn't have recruited her
if we didn't think she could do it,"he
said. "But, she has a lot of room for
improvement. She can go a long
way."
Although Stanford won the Pac
-10 crown, it only had two players on
the 12-player All-Conference team,
while second-place I JSC and third

place UCLA both had three players.
While Shaw did not say he thought
Stanford deserved more representa
tion. he said earlier he thought Lewis
should be named all-conference.
"She's been the quarterback for
the league's best team," Shaw said
Monday. "That should do it."
However, yesterday, Shaw said he

had little to argue with.
"We nominated her for All-Pac
-10, but there are only 12 spots to go
around." Shaw said. "There are a lot
of good players and there's only a
few spots for setters. It's a tough
call."
The success of the Cardinal fresh
men is as encouraging for the team's
future as the success of Detmer,
Lewis and Walsh, all underclassmen.
Sandrik, named the 1997
Gatorade Circle of Champions Na
tional High School Girls' Volleyball
Player of the Year, lived up to her
billing. She posted 1.36 blocks per
game and a hitting percentage of
.296, good for sixth and ninth in the
Pac-10 respectively. She notched 10
or more kills in a match 16 times this
year and had three double-doubles.
While Sandrik drew a great deal
of attention, less was expected from
Chambers. However, Chambers
managed to tally 238 kills, 179 digs
and 59 blocks in a stellar first year.
"This was the year to get us in the
Pac-10," Shaw said. "We're just
going to be getting better with the tal
