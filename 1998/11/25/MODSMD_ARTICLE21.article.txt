# Women finish regular-season play with straight-sets win against USF
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Last night, Stanford's women's
volleyball team beat the University
of San Francisco 3-0. It was not ex
actly a game for the ages. While Stan
ford beat the Dons convincingly, 15-
0, 15-3, and 15-1, in the Cardinal's
final regular-season match, it was not
much more than a scrimmage.
Every Cardinal available played
in at least one game as No. 5 Stanford
completely dominated the match
from beginning to end.
Sophomore middle blocker Jen
nifer Detmer, named to the All-Pa
cific 10 Conference team yesterday,
recorded 12 kills and three assisted
blocks to lead the team. Junior out
side hitter Jaimi Gregory contributed
eight kills and freshman Tara Conrad
chipped in seven, including six in the
second game.
More importantly, perhaps, was
the lack of play from Pac-10 Player
of the Year Kerri Walsh. Walsh, a ju
nior outside hitter, played in the first
game, recording two digs but not
taking a swing on attack. She re
mained on the sidelines for the last
two sets.
While this would usually be trou
ble the Cardinal. Walsh's inactivity
was a welcome sight. She has been
troubled throughout the year by a se
vere shoulder problem. Hie injury
has limited her performance in many
games, even keeping her out of the
Cardinal's early loss to No. 11 UC-
Santa Barbara. But at this time of the
year, the Cardinal needs Walsh. The
fewer swings Walsh takes as the
NCAA tournament approaches, the
more rested and dangerous she will
be and the better chance the two
time defending champion Cardinal
have of three-peating.
The Cardinal especially need
Walsh to be healthy because the
prognosis for sophomore setter
Robyn Lewis is not improving. Al
though the X-ray results on Lewis's

foot are not yet in, she is now on
crutches and coaches expect Lewis,
named honorable mention All-Pac
-10, to be out for at least a week and
possibly into the NCAAs.
"We've got to get people
healthy," head coach Don Shaw said.
"Robyn and Kerri are really impor
tant. Robyn won't practice until at
least [the first game of the NCAAs].
We're going to hold her back as long
as possible."

If Lewis can not play, sophomore
Lindsay Kagawa will start at setter as
she has in the last two matches.
"Robvn's huge to this team,"
Walsh said. "If she's not back, Lind
say's more than qualified. But Robyn
brings so many intangibles to this
team. She's such a leader on the
court. We need her out there if we
can."
Although the win against USF
was not the most satisfying of the
year for Stanford, senior captain
Sarah Neal said she hopes it can give
the team a jump into the tournament.
"This game was the start of our
next win streak." she said. "We have
six games left to the championship. I
think we can get it done.
Tuesday's game was especially
important for Neal as it marked her
last regular-season home game.
Neal, a defensive specialist, began
her Stanford career as a walk-on.
Since then she has been an influential
part of two national championship
teams and has been on scholarship
the last two seasons.
Even though Neal has played on
many successful teams, she said, "I
couldn't be more proud of this team
and how we've played this season. A
lot of people didn't give us any credit
and didn't expect us to win the Pac-10
this year. But we did, and I think now
we're ready for the playoffs."
