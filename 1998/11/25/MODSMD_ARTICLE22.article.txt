NEW YORK — Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery watched
the throngs of people file in and out
of the yellow-checkered cabs that
smother the streets of Manhattan and
he observed the crowded tables at the
ritzy restaurants of Broadway, all on
his way to bed.

■ Today: NIT Semifinals — No. 3
Stanford (3-0) vs No. 23 St. John's (3-
0), 3:(X) p.m. Madison Square Gar
den. TV: ESPN (SC'TV Ch. 34).
RADIO: KTCT (1050 AM), KZSU

"How do you stay awake that
late?" he asked. " There is no way I'd
be able to start eating dinner at 11
o'clock. I'd be face down in the
soup."
Welcome to the Big Apple — the
city that never sleeps. And welcome
to a city that is in desperate need of
some good basketball.
With the NBA Ux-kout keeping
Madison Square Garden somewhat
idle, the No. 3 Stanford Cardinal (3-
0) will provide the city with the fix it
has been yearning for, as the Cardinal
meets the No. 23 St. John's Red
Storm (2-0) tonight at 3 p.m. in the
semifinals of the Chase National In
vitational Tournament.
North Carolina and Purdue join
the Cardinal and St. John's as the
four remaining teams in the tourna
ment and as the four teams hoping to
bring some excitement to the Gar
den.
But while Stanford has not played
here since the 1990-91 season, the
Red Storm has practically made the
Garden its home. Playing in more

games there than any other collegiate
team, St. John's might be a bit more
familiar with the settings for tonight's
nationally televised game. But it
might still require a little something
extra to pull off a victory against the
Cardinal.
"To beat a team like Stanford, you
have to play as good as you can play
and nothing short of that," said St.
John's head coach Mike Jarvis. "You
might have to have a couple career
games to beat a Stanford."
Coming off three wins of 25 points
or more, a confident Stanford squad
will meet a team that is thriving on
being the underdog and a coach that
has always pulled off the upsets.
Jarvis comes to St. John's after
eight seasons as head coach at
George Washington, were he was
legendary for his upsets of rival Mass
achusetts.
Now, with the Red Storm, he has
once again upset yet another ranked
LJMass squad, this time in the second
round of the NIT, and comes to the
Garden with a quick team led by
sophomore forward Ron Artest and

senior forward Tyrone Grant.
Grant leads the team in scoring,
averaging 14.3 points per game this
season, and has also grabbed an im
pressive 33 rebounds in just three
games. The lone senior on the team is
joined down low by Artest, a unani
mous selection to last season's All-
Big East Rookie team.
Jarvis believes this team can play
with "style."
"We're going to try and be excit
ing and get fundamentally sound," he
said. "If you can win doing it, then
that's the way to play. [Of course],
style without victory means you end
up watching others on TV."
Artest and Grant, at 6-foot-6 and
6 foot-7 respectively, however, stand
significantly shorter than Stanford's
front line of Mark Madsen and Peter
Sauer. Furthermore, St. John's cen
ter Albert Richardson will find him
self five inches and 20 pounds shy of
the Cardinal's Tim Young.
"I hope that being bigger turns
into an advantage for us," Mont-
