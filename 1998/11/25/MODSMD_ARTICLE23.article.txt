Stanford came out strong against Car I luirsday night,
and remained resilient despite giving up an early first
period goal to the Bears.
"I don't think at that point (Cat's goal] affected us at
all," said senior goaltender Sami Jo Small. "We realized
that we had two and a half periods to go and we were
shooting well."
Despite more than doubling Cal's number of shots,
Stanford was unable to score until late in the second pe
riod. Then late in the second Mores tied the score at 1-1
on a power-play score.
"I have to give credit to Eric [Mastroianni] because it
was a great pass more than anything." Mores said.
The game finished tied 1-1 at the end of regulation.

forcing sudden-death overtime.
With two minutes left in the extra period, graduate
winger Juha Yrjanheikki netted the winning goal on a
two-on-one breakaway.
"Earlier in the game we had the same situation and
we got kind of screwed up," said graduate center/for
ward Mastroianni. "[This time] he took a straight shot on
the goal without even trying to pass it."
Stanford returned home for Friday's game.
"We came out pumped to get a win after the losing
streak, thinking we could sweep," said senior defense
man Paul I leneman. It's "frustrating to lose a game that
we should have won."
Yrjanheikki opened the scoring with a first-period
goal on a wrap-around play to make the score 1-0.
Cal responded with a controversial goal to tie the
score at 1-1.
"The guy took a nice shot and 1 stopped it and fum
bled it and turned around and fell on the puck right on
the goal line," said Small. "1 was a little flabbergasted
wondering how (the referee] could have called it in."
Cal then went up 2-1 with a late second-period goal.
The team reasserted itself in the third period. Gradu
ate winger Hill Ellersick tied the game with a rebound
shot early in the third period.
Cal then went up 3-2 before Flores' late-game heroics
tied the game at 3-3.
"I made a move on a guy and their D was playing
pretty lax so I just took a shot," Flores said. "| It ] went be
tween the goalie's legs."
Stanford continued to build momentum, killing two
power plays going into the overtime period. Cal, howev
er, responded with an extra-period goal for a 4-3 win.
