SQUASH: Two of the Cardinal
squash players traveled to Santa
Cruz for the Cabrillo Fitness Club
tournament on Nov. 14 and 15.
Julian Chang competed in the B-
Division and was able to advance
through the first round of competi
tion 3-0. The second match started
out well and Chang found himself
ahead 2-0. The opposition quickly
rallied though, and soon the match
was tied at two games apiece. The
final game was tied at seven points,
but Chang eventually fell behind
and lost the match.
"It was Julian's first tournament
in over two years, so it was good ex
perience," said captain Mark Gold
enson.
Goldenson also competed in
Santa Cruz in the C-Division. He
quickly advanced to the semifinals,
defeating his first two opponents 3-0
and 3-1. The semifinal turned out to
be an equally easy victory with
Goldenson scoring a 3-0 victory.
In the final match fatigue proved
to be not only a big factor, but a big
part of the strategy. Each of the
games was close, and Goldenson
was ahead after three games, 2-1. In
the first three games the total point
spread was only four points. The
match-winning game was tied at six
points before Goldenson was able to
pull ahead and win the division title.
