## Aches, pains and dehydration: the science of a hangover 
### Jane Morrill Contributing writer 
Go to any frat party on a Satur
day night, or for that matter any
dormitory, and you will probably
see half of your Chem 32 class stum
bling drunkenly on the dance floor.
If so many Stanford students seem
to love spending their free time in a
state of intoxicated bliss, why don't
they spend every waking minute
outside the classroom drinking
themselves into a stupor? The
answer is simple: the hangover.
For this very reason, researchers
have spent little time looking for an
effective treatment for hangovers.
Scientists reason that the hangover
serves as a deterrent against heavy
drinking.
Physical symptoms of the hang
over include fatigue, headaches,
increased sensitivity to light and
sound, redness of the eyes, muscle
aches, thirst, increased systolic
blood pressure, rapid heartbeat,
tremors and sweating. Mental
symptoms associated with hang
overs are dizziness, vertigo and
moodiness, especially depression,
anxiety and irritability (just ask any
hung over student's roommate
about that one!).
Although many students fall vic
tim to this recurring weekend phe
nomenon, few realize the cause of
that sick feeling in the stomach or
the throbbing headache on Sunday
mornings. And more importantly,
few know how to cure it.
The hangover begins within sev
eral hours after the cessation of
drinking, when the blood alcohol
concentration begins falling. Symp
toms peak when the blood alcohol
concentration reaches zero and may
continue for up to 24 hours.

Alcohol is a diuretic, a drug that
increases urine excretion. Alcohol
inhibits the release of anti-diuretic
hormone from the pituitary gland.
As a consequence, the kidneys stop
reabsorbing water and the alcoholic
drink is converted immediately into
urine.
Sweating, vomiting and diarrhea
due to alcohol consumption cause
additional fluid loss and electrolyte
imbalances. Symptoms of mild to
moderate dehydration include
thirst, weakness, dizziness and light
headedness, which are all observed
during hangovers.
The body quickly compensates
for water loss by borrowing water
from other organs, such as the
brain. This causes the brain to
shrink away from the skull.
Although the brain has no pain sen
sation, it has a covering called the
dura that is connected to the skull
by pain-sensitive filaments. If the
brain shrinks during dehydration,
the dura can become disformed,
causing headaches.
Alcohol's disruptive effect on
sleep adds fatigue to the long list of
hangover pains. Alcohol decreases
the time spent in the dreaming state
(REM) and increases the time spent
in deep (slow-wave) sleep. It also
relaxes the throat muscles, resulting
in increased snoring and sometimes
periodic cessation of breathing.
In addition, cessation of exces
sive drinking causes compensatory
changes in the central nervous sys
tem. In order to counterbalance
alcohol's sedative effects, the body
increases the number of receptors
that excite the nervous system and
decreases the number of receptors
that inhibit nerve cell activity. When
alcohol is removed from the body,
the nervous system remains in an

unbalanced "overdrive" state,
resulting in the tremors and sweat
ing experienced during a hangover.
Alcohol — especially if it has a
high alcohol concentration —
directly irritates the stomach and
intestines, causing inflammation of
the stomach lining and delayed
stomach emptying. Alcohol also
increases the production of gastric
acid, which may lead to abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting.
Lower blood sugar levels are also

associated with alcohol consump
tion, especially when no food has
been consumed beforehand. The
lack of glucose may cause fatigue,
weakness, and mood disturbances.
Hangovers may also be attribut
ed to other substances found in
alcoholic drinks known as con
geners. Congeners are biologically
active compounds that contribute to
the taste, smell and appearance of
the drink. Beverages consisting of
more ethanol and fewer congeners.

such as gin or vodka, induce a less
severe hangover than do drinks
consisting of a large number of con
geners, such as whiskey, brandy or
red wine. Unfortunately for Stan
ford students, it is not known how
many congeners exist in cheap beer.
No known cure for the hangover
exists, but folk remedies have been
suggested throughout history.
Drinking water before bed helps
alleviate dehydration and relieves
brain shrinkage. Eating carbohy

drates may replenish the glucose
lost during alcohol consumption.
Getting a lot of sleep will also help
alleviate fatigue and sluggishness.
Although it would be a prof
itable discovery on most college
campuses, it seems unlikely that any
cure for the hangover is on its way.
And as much as we all dislike the
hangover, we can thank it for its
mitigating effects on drinking:
Without it, some of us would never
put the bottle down and go to class.
