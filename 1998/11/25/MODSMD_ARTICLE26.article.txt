# Native Americans linked to Siberia
## Coming to America 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
A new study has shown for the
first time that two language fami
lies on different continents are
related to each other.
Merritt Ruhlen, lecturer in
Human Biology, published "The
Origin of the Na-Dene" in the
Nov. 10 Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
His research found evidence that
the Yeniseian family of languages,
spoken in central Siberia, is close
ly connected to the Na-Dene lan
guage family, which is spoken
mainly in North America.
"This unravels one little bit of
human pre-history. It simply con
nects two populations together
that never had been connected
before," Ruhlen said.
"Na-Dene and Yeniseian are
much closer to each other than to
other languages," said Ruhlen. In
his article, he was able to provide
36 sets of words similar in the two
language families, such as the
words for birch bark, children,
hunger, foot, lake, deer and rabbit.
Ruhlen hypothesized that there
were three separate migrations to
the Americas. The first brought
the Amerind languages 11,000
years ago. Seven thousand years

ago, the Na-Dene came, followed
by the Eskimo Aleut about 3,0(X)
years ago.
" There was originally one uni
form population in Asia — half
stayed behind and half made it to
the Americas," said Ruhlen. "It is
unclear how they got here, though
it is likely that they came by boat.
One of the words connecting the
languages is the word for boat."
With so many similarities in the
words of the different languages,
Ruhlen argues that they share a
common origin.
In an earlier interview, he
explained, "Borrowing is excluded
because there is no evidence that
people speaking the Yeniseian
and Na-Dene languages have ever
been in contact; onomatopoeia is
ruled out because the terms are
not sound symbolic; and chance is
ruled out by simple probability."
"I would consider these lan
guages to be endangered," said
Ruhlen. Ket is the only surviving
language in the Yeniseian family,
and there are only about 500
remaining Ket speakers, living in a
small community in Siberia. The
Athabaskan branch of the Na-
Dene family includes the lan
guages of the Navajos, which has
about 156,000 speakers, and of the
Apaches, which has about 20,000.

The Eyak, Haida and Tlingit
branches of the Na-Dene family
are used in Alaska and western
Canada.
The Athabaskan language can
be found all along the western
coast of North America.
Athabaskan-speaking populations
spread out mainly from northern
Alaska down to northern Califor
nia, but the Apaches migrated the
farthest south, reaching Arizona
and New Mexico.
Ruhlen has studied language
classification for 20 years, and
earned a doctorate in linguistics at
Stanford in 1973. "I'm interested
in how everybody got where they
go in the world," said Ruhlen.
Ruhlen said his work is an
extension of studies by Joseph
Greenberg, a professor emeritus
of anthropology at Stanford.
"By working with [Greenberg],
I developed a deep interest in lan
guages, and it is now one of my
main interests," Ruhlen said.
Ruhlen stumbled upon his dis
covery of the link between Na-
Dene and Yeniseian in the process
of studying other languages. "I
usually work in Amerind, which is
my main area of interest," said
Ruhlen. He plans to work with
Greenberg to make a dictionary of
the Amerind language.
