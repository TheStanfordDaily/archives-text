# Protein builds tissue in mice

### David Lin 
Do you find yourself shivering,
even when it's sunny and 80 degrees
outside? Do you fear shaking hands
with people because of your icy fin
gers? Have you always had poor cir
culation? A new study by Stanford
Medical School researchers may be
the solution for these and other
pressing medical problems.
A team of Stanford researchers
has used a new gene therapy tech
nique to grow unprecedented
amounts of blood vessel tissue. Pub
lished last Friday in the journal
Molecular Cell, these findings could
affect biological research and may
lead to new treatments for illnesses
such as diabetes and heart disease.
The technique, called myoblast
mediated gene transfer, used cells
known as muscle precursor cells, or
myoblasts, extracted from the legs
of adult mice. These cells fuse with
existing muscle fibers and can help
repair damaged muscle tissue. In
the experiment, the cells were
infected with a retrovirus containing
the gene for a protein called vascu
lar endothelial growth factor, or
VEGF. This protein, discovered in
1985, has been shown to cause
blood vessel growth. The retrovirus
integrated the gene into the cell's
DNA, allowing the cell to produce
the growth factor itself.
These muscle precursor cells
were then injected back into the
legs of the mice and fused with the
adult cells. This transformed the
affected muscle areas into cellular
factories for producing growth fac
tor and releasing it into the blood
stream. In a sense, the precursor
cells served as a delivery system for
injecting new genes into adult cells.
The research team expected the
growth factor to produce slight
growth of blood vessels. Instead the
team discovered that large fluid
filled tumors had formed in the
areas where the mice had been
injected with growth-factor-produc
ing cells. These tumors, called
hemangiomas, were encased by vas
cular tissue similar to the walls of
blood vessels, indicating that
growth factor had spurred the mas
sive growth of this tissue.
"We had hoped to see a few
extra blood vessels," said Dr.
Matthew Springer, a research asso

date with the Medical School's
department of pharmacology and
lead author of the research team's
report. "Instead, we got much
more."
"I didn't think that VEGF alone
could give rise to such complex
effects, especially in normal adult
tissues," added Dr. Helen Blau,
chair of the department of pharma
cology. "There were no prior exper
iments to suggest that it would."
Those effects have potentially
far-reaching impacts in the field of
bioengineering and gene therapy.
According to Springer, the
results were unprecedented â€” for
the first time, vascular endothelial
growth factor had produced vascu
lar tissue in muscles where there
wassufficent oxygen. Previous stud
ies had demonstrated that the factor
could only cause additional growth
of blood vessels in tissues where
there was insufficient oxygen, due
to lack of blood flow. Springer theo
rized that this was due to the
"robust" delivery technique of the
growth factor gene, which apparent
ly led to unusually high levels of the
protein.
This discovery raises a warning
that growth factor gene therapy
could cause uncontrollable tissue
growth in humans being treated
with the technique.
"We need to proceed with cau
tion," said Dr. Springer. "As the
people who use the technique clini
cally increase their efficiency, they
have the potential of too much
expression [of the VEGF gene]."
However, Springer noted that
with the proper control of protein
production, researchers might be
able to harness vascular endothelial
growth factor to spark the produc
tion of actual blood vessels.
According to Blau. clinical trials
are currently in progress for using
the growth factor gene in therapy to
treat diabetes, heart disease and
insufficient blood flow in smokers.
If the proper level of growth factor
is ascertained, this technique may
have great potential for treating
these and other diseases, including
cancer. Blau said.
Studies have shown that tumors
use growth factor to lure in exten
sions of blood vessels from the cir
culatory system, a process called
angiogenesis. If scientists could

learn how to control production of
growth factor, they could inhibit the
growth of blood vessels and starve
the tumors of blood flow.
"If we understand more about
how blood vessels develop, we may
be able to figure out how to block
VEGF's effects on blood vessels
that grow towards and nourish
tumors," Blau said. "This would be
a key to preventing metastases, the
most difficult aspects of treating
cancers."
Iri addition to causing existing
vessels to grow, researchers theo
rize that the high levels of the
growth factor may be causing the
development of entirely new blood
vessel tissue as well. They speculate
that the the factor attracts precursor
cells, which are undeveloped and
unspecialized. from throughout the
body, inducing them to develop into
vessel tissue. This process, known as
vasculogenesis, had been thought to
take place only during embryonic
development and had never been
observed in adult humans. Vasculo
genesis may have been the process
which produced the tumors in the
adult mice, a discovery that may
open the door for research into the
role of precursor cells in embryonic
growth.
According to Springer, the study
was originally intended to demon
strate the effectiveness of this par
ticular gene therapy technique.
Other techniques had only intro
duced the gene coding vascular the
growth factor temporarily, which
only produced low levels of the fac
tor. The technique employed by
Springer's team integrated the gene
permanently into the cells of the
animals, creating a region in the
body that continuously produced
the factor at higher levels.
Springer said the experiment
demonstrated the importance of
interpreting unexpected results.
"When we first saw [the growths
on] the first legs, we could have said
it [the experiment] didn't work," he
said. "But by trying to understand
what we've seen, we may have
opened up a new field for study."
Other authors of the study
included Aileen S. Chen, an under
graduate during the study. Peggy E.
Kraft, a research assistant, and Dr.
Mark Bednarski, a visiting scholar
in the Department of Radiology.
