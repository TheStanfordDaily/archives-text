# Polo opens MPSF tourney with match against Bears
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
It's going to be a tough road for the Stanford men's
water polo team (17-6) this weekend.
The No. 3 Cardinal, the fourth seed for this weekend's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, begins
competition on Friday with a 10:30 a.m. game against fifth
seed California. The winner of the tournament will re
ceive a berth in the N( AA championship tournament. So
in order to make it to Nationals, Stanford must take first
place.
" I he winner will have a tough three games," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti. "It's not going to be
easy for anybody."
If Stanford defeats Cal in the first round, the Cardinal
will most likely face No. 1 USC in the semifinals. IJSC has
the best record in the nation, with only one loss this sea
son. Because they have the best record, the Trojans are
automatically guaranteed a spot at Nationals, provided
they win at least one game this weekend.
Because the top eight teams in the nation will be com
peting for one of two bids for the NCAA championships,
the MPSF tournament iseven more competitive than Na
tionals.
" This is bigger than N( AAs," Dettamanti said. " This
competition is just tougher than anything I've ever been
involved with. The unfortunate part of the NCAAs is that
only two of the top teams in the country can go and that
has made our league tournament the pre-eminent tour
nament for the nation for the year."
But Stanford has the advantage of coming into Fri

day's game off of an 11 -6 victory over Cal last weekend in
Big Splash.
"After beating Cal and playing that well [against
them), our confidence level is really up," said junior co
captain Brian Heifferon. "Everybody knows we have the
talent. It's just about putting it together in the next three
games."

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Friday: Mountain Pacific Sports Federation First-
Round Playoffs — No. 3 Stanford vs. No. 5 California,
10:30 a.m. Newport Harbor High School.
Even though Stanford put in a strong showing against
the Golden Bears, the Cardinal squad isn't underestimat
ing the talent of the Cal team.
" They've had an extra week of preparation," Heiffer
on said. "They're always tough and they've been getting
ready for us. They're super physical and strong and
they've had a whole week to figure out what they did
wrong against us."
But Stanford has also had a week to get ready. And the
team has been tapering to ensure that it peaks at the cru
cial moment. That moment is this weekend.
"We're as ready as we're ever going to be for this tour
nament," Dettamanti said. "The guys know what it takes,
we're peaking at the right time, and they're ready to go.
Our team is mostly juniors and seniors who have been
there and know what's expected."
Leading the Cardinal offense this weekend will be
1 leifferon, who currently leads the team with 38 points on
the season, followed by seniors Layne Beaubien and Ar

turo Rodelo with 35 and 30 points respectively. Senior
goalie Chris Aguilera, who tallied 16 saves against Cal on
Saturday, will head up the defense.
"Our team chemistry is getting better and you can see
that in our results — everybody is scoring." Heifferon
said. "Our defense against Cal was really good. It was a sti
lling defense and they didn't know what to do."
Dettamanti was also pleased with the Cardinal's im
proved attack in recent games.
"We've scored a lot more in the last three games. We

scored 13 points against USC and 11 against Cal [and 19
against UC-Davis], so that's pretty good. Our offense is
coming around."
But Stanford can't rely on its record this weekend. The
last 23 games have no bearing on whether the Cardinal
will make it to Nationals or not.
"I told the guys it's a brand new ballgame," Dettaman
ti said. "All the other games don't mean anything except
that we've learned how to play against these teams. It's
like starting a brand new, three-game season."
