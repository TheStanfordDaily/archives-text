# Women's hoops still riding momentum

### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
Hie Stanford women's basketball
team laid down the foundation for its
season last Sunday with a huge win

against then-No. 1 Purdue and has a
chance to start building it up further
with two games this weekend against
No. 15 Texas Tech and No. 23 Wis
consin.
"The next two games are building

blocks," said sophomore Carolyn
Moos. "Purdue was only the begin
ning. We're going to go out and play
every team like they were the No. 1
team."
The Cardinal dropped out of the
top 25 for the first time since 1987-88
after losing its first three matches of
the year.
Last Thursday, the Cardinal
scored only two field goals in an
eight-minute stretch and was routed
by No. 25 Illinois 76-58.
Stanford bounced back on Sun
day to upset top-ranked Purdue.
Stanford led the entire game, but the
Boilermakers tied it up with 18 sec
onds left to play. Senior Regan
Freuen hit a free throw with one sec
ond left on the clock to clinch the
game.
The win against the Boilermakers
was a team effort and in order for the
Cardinal to keep winning it will have
to see the same balanced play.
"For us, it was a matter of coming
together," said Moos. "We have a lot
of great players and we have what it
takes to be successful. In that game,
people brought to the floor what they
can contribute to the team and they
showed it. It was just the beginning."
Freshman Lindsey Yamasaki had
a big game with 18 points and nine re
bounds. Moos added 16 points and
junior guard Christina Batastini
dumped in a career-high 14.
Stanford shot 52 percent from the
field and was 4 for 9 from outside the
circle. This was a great improvement
from Thursday's performance
against Illinois, when the Cardinal
shot only 38 percent from the field.
"It's exciting to see people im

prove so much," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "But we need to
click on more cylinders. We're get
ting it going hut we're not even as
close to getting as good as we can be
or we want to be. We're going in the
right direction."

Stanford is hoping to carry the
momentum from the Purdue game
into this weekend.
On Friday the Cardinal hosts de
fending Big 12 champion Texas Tech
(2-1) at Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
Like Stanford, the Lady Raiders have
quite a tradition of winning and won
the national championship in 1993.
"Texas [Tech] has an excellent
program, an excellent coach and
we're very familiar with them." said
VanDerveer. "They're a balanced
team and we're going to have to play
very, very hard."
Last year, Texas Tech made it to
the second round of the NCAA tour
nament but failed to advance after
losing to unranked Notre Dame.
Texas Tech returns all of its starters
from last year except Ail-American
Alicia Thompson, who graduated.
The Raiders are deep and head
coach Marsha Sharp liberally substi
tutes any or all of her bench.
After an easy victory against

Texas-Arlington, the Lady Raiders
beat Southern Methodist 72-67 after
weathering a 13-0 run by the Mus
tangs. The team didn't fare so well in
its game against the more skilled
ninth-ranked Old Dominion Lady
Monarchs and lost 85-64.
The Lady Raiders are led by se
nior post Angie Braziel. Braziel
transferred to Texas Tech last year
from South Plains College and made
an immediate impact. She is a presea
son Naismith Award candidate and
averaged 13 points and seven re
bounds last season.
Senior guard Julie Lake controls
the Raider backcourt. In last week's
game against Old Dominion, Lake
led her team with a career-high 14
points.
Texas Tech will test Stanford with
its zone defense, as the Cardinal has
only played teams who use a man-to
man system.
On Sunday at 2 p.m. Stanford will
be looking to avenge last year's 90-82
loss to Wisconsin in the season's
home opener.
Wisconsin (4-0) is off to a strong
start. The Badgers are led by sopho
more forward LaTonva Sims, who
was named Big 10 Player of the Week
after her 34-point performance
against then-22nd-ranked Santa Bar
bara. Freshman Tamara Moore has
been contributing greatly in the back
court and powered a 14-4 surge after
coming off the bench against the
Gauchos.
Stanford is hungry for the win.
"We lost in their house and
they're coming to our house," said
Freuen. "We don't want to let them
get going."
