# Fewer students tutoring in EPA
## Stanford decline follows national trend 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Coordinators of the newly
formed Ravenswood Reads, a pro
gram in which Stanford students
tutor children in East Palo Alto ele
mentary schools, have noticed a sig
nificant drop in the number of stu
dents working to promote literacy
among EPA children.
The decrease in Stanford tutors
reflects a nationwide decrease in vol
unteerism that has seen the Clinton
administration fall well short of its
goal of recruiting 1 (K).(KK) students
for its America Reads program, a
work-study service program for liter
acy improvement.
Sixty-five Stanford students are
participating in Ravenswood Reads,
the result of a merger between the
13-year-old Ravenswood Stanford
Tutoring Project and the Stanford
branch of President Clinton's Amer
ica Reads.
Last year, 9() to 95 Stanford stu
dents participated in cither RSTP or
America Reads.
The decline in participants has
been a disappointment to this year's
coordinators.
"We had hoped to offer at least
four sessions to each [elementary

school] student, but there are stu
dents getting as few as one or two,"
said sophomore Rob McNary,
Ravenswood Reads tutor coordina
tor. "It's unfortunate, because we
weren't able to get as many tutor
hours as we need."
The Clinton administration is also
disappointed by the number of par
ticipants in its America Reads pro
gram. In his 1997 State of the Union
address, Clinton established the tar
get of 1 (K).(KK) college students who
would help form a "citizen army" of
a million volunteers trying "to make
sure every child can read indepen
dently by the end of the third grade."
Hut in the work-study program's
first year, 1997-98, fewer than S().(XX)
students participated in America
Reads, despite the Education De
partment's commitment to paying all
of the work-study benefits, instead of
the 75-25 split usually divided be
tween the government and the col
lege.
McNary feels that the President's
goal was overly ambitious and unre
alistic. "The president's initiative
didn't account for the massive ad
ministration, training and trans
portation issues that go with these
programs.
However, he said that, with the
support of the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service on campus, Stanford will
be able to increase participation in
work-study community service.
"We're lucky that at Stanford we
have the Haas Center providing
above and beyond what other
schools are doing in terms of admin
istrative and transportation sup
port," McNary said. "I think we al
ready have a lot of students working
on community service work-study.
Since Stanford supports them well. I
think it's going to increase."
As for the future, McNary hopes
that Ravenswood Reads will soon be
able to expand beyond the two
schools it currently serves, as the old
Ravenswood program once worked
with as many as five East Palo Alto
schools. He said. "We're hoping
through this program to possibly ex
pand to other schools, but we're con
centrating on these two schools first."
RSTP was formerly an all volun
teer organization providing after
school tutoring. Ravenswood Reads
is comprised of both volunteer and
work-study students, and provides
tutoring during school hours.
The merger occurred for a num
ber of reasons, ranging from trans
portation and organizational prob
lems to a need for a more structured

curriculum for tutoring.
According to McNary, last year
"several problems, especially trans
portation, meant that most people
didn't work the eight to 12 hours
needed" to meet the America Reads
work-study requirements.
Also, there was concern over the
type of service that the America
Reads students were providing last
year. Ravenswood Reads coordina
tor Janice Prothro said, "Last year,
students in the America Reads pro
gram primarily served as classroom
aides," limiting their ability to work
individually with students.
Both of these problems were
solved last spring with a grant from
an anonymous donor. The grant,
which was applied towards the new
unified program, allowed for the pur
chase of a new van. as well as the im
plementation of an entirely new
reading curriculum known as "Read
ing One-to-One" developed by
George Farkas of the University of
Texas at Dallas.
The new curriculum is more com
patible with the old RSTP curricu
lum, which emphasized one-on-one
interaction, than with America
Reads.
"RSTP had a lot of success, espe
cially because of the one-on-one pro
grams. The best part about it was the
one-on-one interaction between the
tutors and the kids," McNary said.
Thus coordinators decided to em
phasize the one-on-one relationship
in the new program, and chose to em

ploy the Farkas curriculum.
Under the new curriculum, Stan
ford tutors visit the two elementary
schools, Castano Elementary and
Cesar Chavez Elementary in East
Palo Alto, two or three times per
week.
At each visit, a tutor has two to
four 50-minute sessions with differ
ent students. Thus tutors have the
ability to commit anywhere from
four to 12 hours per week, allowing
Ravenswood Reads to accommo
date the requirements of the work
study benefits.
The goal of the tutoring curricu
lum is to help children develop a
third-grade reading level. However,
McNary said, "We've interpreted
'third-grade' liberally to mean any
one under the third grade reading
level. Thus we generally tutor the five
most behind students in each first
through fifth grade class."
Prothro said the new curriculum
has been greeted with a positive re
sponse from tutors. "Overall, people
appreciate the structure, knowing
what they're going to do when they
go into a tutoring session instead of
just winging it like they did before in
many cases."
Sophomore Aaron Greenfield, a
Ravenswood Reads tutor who
worked with America Reads last
year, said the new program has made
a big difference. "I like the changes a
lot. It's a much more structured, defi
nite curriculum. The kids are willing
to work harder."
