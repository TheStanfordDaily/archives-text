# Fewer students tutoring in EPA
## Stanford decline follows national trend 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Coordinators of the newly
formed Ravenswood Reads, a pro
gram in which Stanford students
tutor children in East Palo Alto ele
mentary schools, have noticed a sig
nificant drop in the number of stu
dents working to promote literacy
among EPA children.
The decrease in Stanford tutors
reflects a nationwide decrease in vol
unteerism that has seen the Clinton
administration fall well short of its
goal of recruiting 1 (K).(KK) students
for its America Reads program, a
work-study service program for liter
acy improvement.
Sixty-five Stanford students are
participating in Ravenswood Reads,
the result of a merger between the
13-year-old Ravenswood Stanford
Tutoring Project and the Stanford
branch of President Clinton's Amer
ica Reads.
Last year, 9() to 95 Stanford stu
dents participated in cither RSTP or
America Reads.
The decline in participants has
been a disappointment to this year's
coordinators.
"We had hoped to offer at least
four sessions to each [elementary

school] student, but there are stu
dents getting as few as one or two,"
said sophomore Rob McNary,
Ravenswood Reads tutor coordina
tor. "It's unfortunate, because we
weren't able to get as many tutor
hours as we need."
The Clinton administration is also
disappointed by the number of par
ticipants in its America Reads pro
gram. In his 1997 State of the Union
address, Clinton established the tar
get of 1 (K).(KK) college students who
would help form a "citizen army" of
a million volunteers trying "to make
sure every child can read indepen
dently by the end of the third grade."
Hut in the work-study program's
first year, 1997-98, fewer than S().(XX)
students participated in America
Reads, despite the Education De
partment's commitment to paying all
of the work-study benefits, instead of
the 75-25 split usually divided be
tween the government and the col
lege.
McNary feels that the President's
goal was overly ambitious and unre
alistic. "The president's initiative
didn't account for the massive ad
ministration, training and trans
portation issues that go with these
