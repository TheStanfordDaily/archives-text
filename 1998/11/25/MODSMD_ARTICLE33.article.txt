### Abhishek Bajoria 
Residents of the outer Row
should not be inconvienenced by
any more planned power outages,
according to Pacific Gas & Electric
Co.
Residences south of Campus
Drive had their power shut off last
Thursday because of maintenance
work by PG&E. The outage affect
ed Phi Sig, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Durand, La Maison the
Grove houses, Kairos, Haus Mit
teleuropa, Roth, Slavanskii Dom,
Hammarskjold, Chi Theta Chi and
717 Dolores, as well as.some faculty
housing.
However, only four of those
houses were notified that they were
part of the planned outage. PG&E
could not clarify whether the addi
tional eight houses were accidental
ly part of the outage, or whether
they were simply not notified in ad
vance.
"We only knew about four hous
es, the other eight were a surprise,"
said Diana Conklin, the manager of

undergraduate residence facilities.
The outage was to "safely re
move vandalized equipment on Old
Page Mill Road," according to Tami
Peters, a PG&E customer service
representative. She also said that
1,300 customers were affected even
though the outage was scheduled to
inconvenience the least number of
people. No one from PG&E was
available for further comment.
PG&E sent out mail to the hous
es that were to be affected. Because
mail on the Row is delivered in bulk,
some of the houses had not sorted
their mail until after the outage.
Many of the customers affected by
this outage were students, and most
were uninformed about this sched
uled power outage.
Facilities Operations, which is in
charge of utilities on campus, does
not control the power supply for the
houses that were affected. That was
the major reason behind the lack of
information passed on to the stu
dents.
Steve Raby, a supervisor at Facil
ities Operations, said that they

"weren't involved" and that the
"houses were notified directly." He
also commented on PG&E's lack of
professionalism because of their un
attentiveness to the needs of the stu
dents and residence facilities.
Conklin said she "would like
[PG&E] to notify student Housing
[and Dining] Services whenever
they are going to do anything that
affects them."
Uninformed students were irri
tated by the outage. According to
Conklin, "an upset student wrote a
letter to [facilities supervisor Lisa
Thornton], explaining to her that
he lost a day's worth of work be
cause he couldn't get onto his com
puter."
Those warned of the outage
ahead of time were not quite as irri
tated. Aron Ketchel, a junior in Slav
Dom, said he received two e-mails
from his house manager, which
were forwarded from PG&E.
When asked about the outage,
he said, "It's a minor inconvenience
that we all have to live through and
deal with."
