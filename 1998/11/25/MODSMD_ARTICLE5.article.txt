# Comm dept. curriculum to change
## 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Beginning next fall, communica
tion is going to be a bit different.
The Department of Communica
tion is reviewing a broad-range series
of proposed revisions to its programs
of study at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels, according to
Asst. Prof. Laura Leets, undergradu
ate director for the department.
Specifically, the Department is
considering eliminating Area 3, or
skills-based study, from its under
graduate major and adding new
"tracks" which will offer specializa
tion within the major.
Also proposed is the eventual
phase-out of the media studies pro
gram at the masters level bv the 2(KX)-

01 school year. Next year will be the
last year that any prospective coter
minal students will be able to partic
ipate in the program, if the changes
are approved.
"We are hoping to make changes
to the bulletin and to our course of
ferings that will make our depart
ment's mission more understandable
and maybe more attractive," Leets
said.
Leets said that the primary reason
for the overhaul in the curriculum
stems from the fact that the depart
ment is shifting away from skills
based instruction and moving more
toward theoretical applications. The
old Area 3 requirement courses will
become electives within the major.
"The department has always fo
eused on the theoretical effects of
communication, but it was often mis
taken," 1 she said.
The department is strongly con
sidering the addition of a series of
new tracks within the major. These
tracks would allow students to focus
on a particular area of interest and to
pursue it. Examples of potential
tracks include "New Media Technol
ogy," which would cover new break
throughs in communication such as
the Internet, or "Media Effects,"
which would look at the political im
pact of the media.
"When you come to a University
of Stanford's caliber, you shouldn't
expect to learn how to communicate
but rather what the ramifications of
communication are," Leets said.
Thus far, the changes to the grad
uate programs will include, in addi
tion to the eventual removal of

Media Studies, a greater overlap and
integration of study.
Once all of these changes have
been decided upon, Leets said that
the department will also work on
"cleaning up the bulletin [Communi
cation section] and making it more
consistent."
In her opinion these changes will
have an effect, not only on the de
partment as a whole but also upon re
lated programs.
,"The department will probably
hire a few more faculty members,"
Leets said. "The way we are per
ceived may change and could have an
effect on other related programs of
study."
Prof. Steven Chaffee, the chair of
the department, agrees.
"Right now, we are not complete
ly sure of the implications of these
changes," he said. "New faculty will
need to be hired so that we can add
more course offerings and staff exist
ing ones that need to be taught."
The department has been consid

ering these changes for several
months. It has been working in con
junction with, among others, Mal
colm Beasley, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and
Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for un
dergraduate education.
The proposals were also devel
oped in part through consultation
with the department's Peer Advisory
Hoard, comprised of three upper
classmen selected annually.
"It has been very rewarding to be
a part of this process that has the def
inite potential to help the department
in the future," said Analisa De Haro,
a senior on the board.
Some students have mixed feel
ings about proposed changes.
"Area 3 was my favorite area,"
said David Scheine, a senior. "Track
ing seems pretty interesting,
though."
The revisions are currently under
review by the department. A deci
sion will be announced in the coming
months.
