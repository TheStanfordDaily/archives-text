# Nearly 300 passwords stolen
## Computer hackers get into EE server 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
For the second time in two
months, a computer hacker broke
into University computers, this time
stealing passwords for almost 300 e
mail accounts.
An outside hacker logged into the
Electrical Engineering departmental
computer, compromising all ac
counts on the server, as well as 61 Le
land system accounts.
"It looked like the hacker was
going for power and wanted to con
trol the system, not necessarily what
was on it." said David Brumley, a
specialist in the Computer Security
Office.
The hacker, using a stolen pass
word, broke into the system at
around 7 p.m. on Oct. 31 and stayed
in the system for six days, Brumley
said. The intruder used a "sniffer." a
software program that can intercept
user names and*passwords, to initial
ly get into the system. Once in.the
hacker installed programs on the sys
tem to collect user passwords.
Brumley said that although there
were no reports of tampering with e
mail accounts, the security office did
shut down all the Leland accounts af
fected. forcing students to go to
Sweet Hall to change their pass
words.
" That upset a few people, but it's
an evil necessity," Brumley said.
The Electrical Engineering De
partment. which has control over its
departmental accounts, has warned
everyone with accounts on its server
to change their passwords immedi
ately to avoid further complications.
The security office was able to
trace the hacker to an Internet ser
vice provider but was unable to pro
ceed further without outside assis
tance.
The I Jniversity elected not to call
the FBI. because minimal damage
was done. Brumley said there was no
tampering with user accounts, but the
department did have to reinstall the
system software, as is customary for
an incident such as this.
The number of computer security
incidents has increased recently, due

to more widespread use of automat
ed scanning programs, according to
Brumley. These programs allow
hackers to look for vulnerabilities in
hundreds of machines at a time.
Just last week more than 18,000
scans were performed on Stanford
computers. Each scan is counted as
coming from one source but could
encompass many computers.
The intrusion on the electrical en
gineering server is far from an isolat
ed incident.
Earlier this month hackers broke
into computers on the Leland system
to extract more than S.(KK) user pass
words. in what was considered the
first major break-in to the Leland sys
tem.
In June, 3,(XX) researchers at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
fell victim to hackers and were left
without Internet access for a week.
Last April a hacker found his way
into the system in the Durand Build
ing and stole 24C) e-mail passwords.
Although past incidents have in
volved hackers deleting doctoral the
ses from the system. Brumley said the
goal of hackers is not always to gain
access to Stanford data.
Sometimes they use a computer
system as a "jumping spot" to break
into other systems, such as banks, so
that their actions will be harder for
the victims to trace.
Generally, however, hackers can
only gain initial access to Stanford
computers by logging into a machine
on campus.
The PC-Stanford software pack
age. which includes Kerberos securi
ty protection, provides users with a
secure login.
The Kerberos system encrypts a
user's login information so hackers
cannot access it.
"It's more or less technically in
feasible for someone to crack Ker
beros protection," Brumley said.
Dennis Michael, manager of the
Leland systems in Sweet Hall, said
the problem is that campus computer
users are not logging in with the pro
tection of Kerberos.
"We're trying to get rid of clear
text passwords so that sniffers won't
work," he said.
