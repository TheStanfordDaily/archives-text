# A 						novel concept in creative writing
## 
### Maggie Weidner 
Around a long wtxxlen table in a
warmly lit room in Margaret Jacks
Hall, 18 students listen intently as
their fellow classmate reads a few
paragraphs from the 20 pages he had
prepared from his novel for critique.
After he finishes, everyone leans
back in their seats, and Keith Scribn
er, a Jones Lecturer with the Cre
ative Writing Division of the English
Department, opens the class up for
comment.
"Well, I just really want to know
what happens."
The class bubbles with laughter, as
everyone agrees.
The class is a special section of
English 190: "Intermediate Fiction
Writing," which usually focuses on
composing short stories. Scribner de
cided to depart from the original for
mat of the class because of his experi

ences with writing novels. Coupled
with a large student demand for the
course — only 19 students out of 28
applicants were accepted into the
class— Intermediate Novel Writing
was born.
Of course the students aren't ex
pected to complete an entire novel in
the one semester that they take the
class, but Scribner says that the class
will give them a "great start."
Each student is expected to com
plete the first KM) pages of their novel
this semester. They turn in 10 pages a
week to get credit for the class. Scrib
ner says that these first 1 (X) pages that
allow the student to "get the charac
ters and primary relationships into
place."
Over the course of the semester
each student will have a total of 40
pages critiqued by peers in two dif
ferent 20-page sections. Comments
range from praise to helpful sugges

tions on believability to style to
whether a word would be more ef
fective if it were italicized.
" This class experience was extra
ordinary," said Irvin Tyan, a senior
majoring in English. "Writing novels
is a gargantuan task, very different
from writing short stories. In a way,
it's playing God, because you create
an entire world."
The energy is high, and the discus
sion is frequently broken with bursts
of laughter. Such a supportive envi
ronment allows aspiring story-tellers
to develop their creativity in a sus
tained project, as well as opening
new alternatives in the Creative
Writing Department which break
away from the "short story" routine.
The class began by reading a novel
a week. The students continually
refer back to these novels as models
for structure, style, and tone. For ex
ample, in class, Scribner suggested to

one student that he re-read para
graphs from Joan Didion's novel
"Play It as It Lays," beeause both au
thors both use a "stripped-down,
sparse" tone in their novels.
Seribner said that using sueeessful
novel writers as models is a helpful
technique because successful au
thors allow students to see where in
novels conflict is introduced, and un
derstand how to lay out their story
He said that above all, he is
amazed at how good the novels are,
and is encouraging all the students to
complete their novels. The class has
also discussed how to get an agent
and how to be published.
While the students in the class will
not be able to complete their novels
this term, they will have a start.
However, Seribner has high hopes.
"Every student in the class is ab
solutely burning to write a novel," he
said.
