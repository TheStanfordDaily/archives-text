nd you thought you busted a move over the
weekend? Meet senior Psychology major
Jennifer Bialson This former Stanford
Ut
cheerleader is now a skilled dancer and dance
teacher who has tackled everything from jazz and hip
hop to ballet and tap. In addition to her years as a
Stanford athlete cheering the Cardinal on to victory,
she has danced professionally for four years and now
performs with Visual Rhythm, a professional dance
company in Santa Clara.
Bialson also choreographs cheerleading shows
and has performed during halftime at San Francisco
49ers and Golden State Warriors games as well as at
the NHL All-Star Game Convention in 1997.
Bialson is considering dancing professionally for
a year after she graduates next spring. "Dancing is
a big part of my life, and I would love to pursue it
for a while before taking a 'real-world' job," she
says. If things work out, maybe dancing will be her
real-world job.

// Club Team Congratulations
Congrats to Stanford's Men's and Women's Ultimate
Frisbee Teams for being chosen to receive Nike support for
the '98-'99 season. Check out their new uniform shirts next
time you watch them play.
Ultimate Frisbee is just one of the many outstanding non
varsity teams here at Stanford I'd like to thank every sport
that submitted a proposal. And since Sports Page is all about
supporting serious club competitors, I want to hear about
those shattered records, odds-defying victories and
championships to come. Email me; your latest

P Shout-Outs to Stanford's
Heroes and Spring
P.L.A.Y.CORPS Coaches!
Congrats to all the Spring '99 P.L.A.Y.CORPS coaches! By putting
your skills to work in a sport you know, you'll create an opportunity
for kids in your community to get involved in sports. And, even
better, you'll become a hero to young people who really need
your help.
By the way, for all you future coaches out there who missed the
fall deadline: It's not too late! I'll be recruiting for Nike's
PL.A.Y.CORPS program again next spring, so you've still got time
to be a hero. Email me at the address below to find out more.
Hi, I'm Marc Mitchell, your Nike student rep at Stanford. Check
out Sports Page for the latest on sports and Nike events around
campus. Are you or your team setting records 7 Breaking new
ground? I'm here to support non-varsity athletes, intramural addicts
and serious club competitors. If you're a hidden athlete who
deserves some recognition, I want to hear from you. Drop me an
email at marc.mitchell@nike.com. You just might end up in the
next issue.
Quality. Performance. Value. You don't have to be a
pro athlete to demand them for your workout. Now,
for all you weekend warriors and recreational athletes,
there's Nike's Air Imara. The Air Imara was named one of the
top women's running shoes by Fitness Magazine for its great
support, padding, fit and stability. Its unique design offers
excellent cushioning and heel stability, but isn't so built up
that your foot loses touch with the roa
To ensure better fit, the Air Imara is
also available in widths. And at $70
a pair, the Air Imara is an excellent
value for students on a budget.
Would you rather run on a treadmill by
yourself or run outside with other people?
(Same here, see you Wednesday.)
