## Exxon to merge with Mobil 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —Exxon
agreed to buy Mobil for $73.7 bil
lion Tuesday in a deal that would
create the largest corporation in the
world and put back together two of
the biggest pieces from the 1911
breakup of John D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil.
Roughly 9,000 jobs will be elimi
nated worldwide as a result of the
takeover, or about 7 percent of the

companies' combined work force of
123.(MX), Exxon chairman Lee Ray
mond said.
Despite the new company's vast
reach, a world oil glut is expected to
keep pump prices at rock-bottom
levels for now. Analysts also expect
the companies will have to sell off
numerous gas stations and refiner
ies to satisfy antitrust regulators.
The deal is the latest example of

rapid consolidation in an industry
whose profits have been cut world
wide.
The company will be known as
Exxon Mobil Corp. There will con
tinue to be Mobil and Exxon gas
stations, as well as the Exxon tiger
and Mobil's red Pegasus logo.
Exxon Mobil will surpass Royal
Dutch-Shell Group as the No. 1
energy company and vault past

General Motors Corp. as the
biggest corporation in the world.
Oil prices have been hammered
by oversupply from OPEC and
weak demand from the Asian finan
cial crisis and warm fall weather in
America.
Analysts say that to slash costs
and boost profits, smaller compa
nies will continue merging, and larg
er players will find partners, too.
