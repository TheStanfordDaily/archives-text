# U.S. files describe alleged crimes of former dictator

WASHINGTON (AP) — Once-secret
U.S. intelligence files provide Spanish prose
cutors evidence linking former Chilean Presi
dent Augusto Pinochet and his military gov
ernment to alleged crimes ranging from tor
ture and genocide to the execution of two
Americans.
An FBI cable from 1976 describes "Opera
tion Condor," a Chilean-led effort to "travel
anywhere in the world ... to carry out sanc
tions up to assassination" against leftist rebels
and their supporters.
A State Department memorandum sent to
then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in
1973 tells of executions conducted by the
Chilean military of some 320 suspected
resisters following the military coup that
placed Pinochet in power. Two Americans
were among those executed, the memo said.
And a 1975 U.S. defense intelligence dis
patch from Chile says the leader of the dread
ed DIN A, Chile's security apparatus, "report
ed exclusively to, and received orders only
from President Pinochet." DINA, because of
its leading internal security role in Chile, has
long been accused of human rights abuses.
The recently declassified documents have
already begun to assist Spain's bid to prose
cute Pinochet on charges of genocide, terror

ism and torture.
State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said Tuesday that widespread interest
in the case has prompted the administration
to review more documents from the Pinochet
era with the idea of declassifying them also.
The body of evidence from the Defense
Department and various federal agencies,
including the CIA and FBI, comes as the Clin
ton administration continues to debate how
active a role the United States should play in
the Pinochet case. The administration has
taken no position on Spain's bid to extradite
Pinochet from Britain.
While the Justice Department continues to
review of available evidence, there are no
indications the administration plans to try to
prosecute Pinochet for Americans killed in
Chile or political murders in the United States
linked to Chilean security forces.
"There are literally thousands of docu
ments in the records of the CIA, the Pen
tagon, the State Department and elsewhere
that would literally prove Spain's case against
Gen. Pinochet," said Peter Kornbluh, an ana
lyst with the National Security Archive, a pri
vate Washington library that seeks and col
lects formerly classified national security doc
uments.
