# Candidates fined by FEC
## Advertising abuses 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Gov-
ernment auditors recommended
Tuesday that President Clinton
repay $7 million and Republican
nominee Bob Dole pay back $17.7
million in federal funds that went to
their 19% presidential bids, saying
both illegally benefited from issue
ads run by their political parties.
The repayments from candidates
to the U.S. Treasury are the highest
ever recommended by Federal Elec
tion Commission auditors, eclipsing
the $4 million figure for Clinton's
1992 campaign.
The findings, which already have
prompted a separate Justice Depart
ment investigation into the legality
of the ads, are to be reviewed Thurs
day by the six-member commission
that oversees political fund-raising.
The commissioners, three from each
major party, can accept, reject or
alter the repayment figures.
Lawyers for both Clinton and
Dole said the recommendations
were excessive, and the advertise
ments at issue were legal.
Frequently, presidential candi
dates have contested such repay

ment orders. Clinton's 1992 audit
was settled with the campaign repay
ing $1.6 million. Auditors recom
mended that President Bush repay
$1.3 million, but commissioners set
the figure at $680,855.
The FEC staff auditors conclud
ed that by illegally coordinating sup
posedly independent ads run by the
Democratic and Republican nation
al committees in 1996,the two candi
dates exceeded the limit agreed to
when they accepted taxpayer assis
tance for the election.
The FEC auditors concluded the
ads caused Clinton to exceed the pri
mary spending limit of $30.9 million
by $46.4 million. The repayment fig
ure for Clinton is based on a formu
la that represents the percentage of
taxpayer funds his primary cam
paign received.
They said Dole exceeded the pri
mary spending limit by $9 million,
and should repay $2.9 million based
on the formula. The auditors said
Dole should repay an additional
$14.8 million for excessive spending
and other problems in the general
election.
