Unauthorized bonfire on Lake
Lag symbolized frustration
with current Big Game rally

LAST WEEK S ILLEGAL bonfire
hearkened back to the days of past
Big Game celebrations that attract
ed tens of thousands of spectators. It is true
that only around 50 people attended the
bonfire on Lake Lag, but a showing of 50
people at an unannounced event in the wee
hours of the morning is impressive.
While we do not condone the illegal
bonfire, we endorse the spirit behind the
event. We believe the official bonfire rally is
only a substitute for a better Big Game cel
ebration that is currently lacking on cam
pus.
The official Big Game bonfire is too
highly orchestrated to encourage frenzied
school spirit. The event attracts a minority
of students and is rigorously controlled.
This year's fireworks at the rally were
impressive. But the Band was shoved in a
corner off to the side while the small bon

fire was lit. Spectators were cordoned far
away from the fire. Axe Committee mem
bers were the only students allowed to
dance gleefully by the flames. This celebra
tion was too small and restrictive to inspire
a spirited response.
Bonfires of years past clearly had their
problems. If salamanders are truly in dan
ger, we do not endorse a bonfire that would
char the lake bed and encourage thousands
of trampling feet to stomp salamander habi
tat.
However, the maverick bonfire only
demonstrated what many students already
know. The official bonfire does not allow
enough student involvement. We are hun
gry for something better.
We hope the Axe Committee will con
tinue to work with the University to design
a bigger, better Big Game celebration. Last
year, the ASSU and the Dean of Students
Office were involved in bonfire planning.
We encourage these groups to continue
working to improve the bonfire. We also
urge students to voice their suggestions and
concerns to these organizations. The cur
rent bonfire rally leaves much to be
desired.
