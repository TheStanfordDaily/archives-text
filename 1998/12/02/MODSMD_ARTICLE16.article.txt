# Unionization justified

### 
Hospital workers union is
in best interests of workers
at newly merged hospital

WORKERS AT STANFORD
Hospital and Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital may
be earning higher wages than workers in
comparable health care positions at other
hospitals. Higher wages, however, don't
make unions unnecessary. We are pleased
that hospital workers voted two weeks ago
to unionize.
Unions are meant to protect workers
from hazardous conditions and unfair
wages and hours. Workers who are happy
with their pay hours still benefit from
the collective • bargaining power of the
union.
II working conditions decline or new
issues arise, workers' voices need to be
heard in negotiating solutions.

The UCSF-Stanford Health Care merg
er was highly opposed by unions, such as
the California Nurses Association, the Uni
versity Professional and Technical Employ
ees union and the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees
union, as well as the California Public
Employee Relations Board. All of those
groups participated in lawsuits last year to
prevent the merger. None of the several
lawsuits filed stopped the merger.
But this month's vote to unionize should
ease some of the concerns of workers who
were worried that the merger would give
UCSF a reason to abolish unions. Because
Stanford Medical Center was less unionized
than UCSF Medical Center, many were
worried that the merger would be detri
mental to unions.
In fact, however, the merger seems to
have increased union influence.
We support the unionization of Stanford
Hospital and the Children's Hospital, and
hope workers and managers both benefit
from the arrangement.
