Look beyond the job track
In her October 29 column, "A six-figure
education with no answers," Vanessa
Bartsch vividly described her frustration at
completing an academic major at Stanford
that has no perceived "value" in today's job
market.
I'm sure Vanessa speaks for other Stan
ford students who also pursue "soft" majors
and are not vigorously recruited by man
agement consulting firms, investment banks
and technical organizations.
Before I address the issue of degrees and
careers, let me first make sure that I clarify
one very important point.
The value of a "six-figure Stanford edu

cation" should not be to simply position
oneself in the job market or to obtain a high
paying job. Rather, it is to learn how to
think critically, solve complex problems,
become genuinely sensitive to the issues of
today's societies, become knowledgeable
about a particular field of study, become
self-reliant and refine one's effectiveness in
working with diverse ideas and people.
There are many avenues and degree pro
grams that are available for achieving these
fundamental goals of a Stanford education.
Not all of them, however, can be, nor
should be, packaged as "marketable"
degrees.
Sure, I know that students today per
ceive a college education as the "ticket" to a
well-paying job and a "secure" future, and

experience frustration and disillusionment
when their expectations are not immediate
ly realized.
However, it is important to remember
that employers don't hire degrees, they hire
people. They hire people who have the
technical and / or the non-technical skills to
engage in a vocation, or at least to learn
how to engage in a vocation.
The "transferable" skills that are often
gained through liberal studies are skills that
are broadly applicable to a wide variety of
fields and vocations and provide students
with a wide variety of choices for their
career paths.
While some students, by virtue of their
skills, interests, knowledge and experiences,
are easier than others for the staff of the

Career Development Center to assist, most
students can significantly benefit by using
the resources of the CDC. Career coun
selors can assist students learn more about
their skills and interests, identify and
research potential career fields, access
internship and job resource information,
develop effective job search strategies and
establish contacts with alumni and employ
ers.
For Vanessa and other students who per
ceive they have limited career and life
choices after completing their six-figure
education at Stanford, there really is a
future and many more than "four options."
Think of the many Stanford grads who
preceded you and felt the same sense of
desperation. Most have found career paths

that are rewarding and fulfilling. Certainly,
they may have struggled in their initial
career and job pursuits and it is likely that
their paths have not always been easy nor
have they led directly to their niche in the
world of work.
However, the fundamental reward of a
Stanford education is in the journey, not
just in the destination. Hard work, persis
tence, intelligence and self-motivation got
you to Stanford, got you through Stanford
and will similarly help you achieve your
life's mission, including a career. We at the
CDC are committed to assisting you in your
journey.
