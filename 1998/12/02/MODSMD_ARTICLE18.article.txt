## Is Stanford so bad? I guess not.

THE Thanksgiving
holiday has passed,
and the eating fren
zy is over. Lulled into a
tryptophan-induced
drowsiness, we now con
front the perils of exam
week. Unfortunately the

inertia of Thanksgiving dinner has put us in
a sluggish mood, and periodic gastrointesti
nal reflux torments us with the full-bellied
flavor of a gravy long gone.
While we may feel an aversion to school
right now, we should remain positive. As
certain University traditions have demon
strated, in order to bolster spirits, one
should mock the caricatured weaknesses of
a rival school rather than applaud the actu
al strengths of one's own institution.
Accordingly, we should take a break from
our hectic schedules to point out the short
comings of other academic institutions. In
particular, we can consider some of the
peculiar courses offered at other universi
ties.
Take Northwestern University as an
example.
Northwestern houses the well-known
Medill School of Journalism — a clearing
house for future editors, anchors and other
brands of media hounds. The writing cur
riculum is rigorous and the competition
fierce, yet the school still offers some less
challenging courses. The following is a
course description from the school's Web
page:
325-C9l-0. E-mail Etiquette. Learn when it
is appropriate to use multiple exclamation
points, ASCII art and typographic smiley
faces (never).
One school that tends to avoid fluff class
es is Reed College, which is renowned for
its off-kilter, liberal environment. The
stereotype of Reed is that its students lean
left on politics as well as fashion, that its

professors are accommodating and accessi
ble and that both populations express their
academic excellence with genuine noncha
lance. As one of the few West Coast havens
for liberal arts education, Reed boasts a
scholarly, rather than pre-professional,
atmosphere. In fact, Reed offers only one
business class, and clearly it does so reluc
tantly.
Business 100. Philosophy of Business.
Reading intensive seminar. Adam Smith
and John Maynard Keynes spell out the
basics of economic theory, Peter Drucker
provides insights on the principles of man
agement and Aristotle explains why busi
ness is a fundamentally soulless enterprise
woven from the fabric of iniquity.
Of course, not all colleges have such a
negative attitude toward pre-professional
ism.
Medicine seems to be the career of
choice nowadays, but engineering still ranks
as one of the more popular areas of concen
tration. Many prospective engineers gravi
tate toward technical institutes, while such
places inspire fear in the hearts of aspiring
social scientists.
However, some of these institutions have
reputable social science departments. MIT
offers excellent programs in sociology, eco
nomics and psychology. In these disciplines,
field work is a key aspect of the curriculum.
The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Depart
ment offers the following hands-on psychol
ogy course:
BCS 9.61. Patient J.B. Advanced seminar
that focuses on the patient known as "J.8."
Students critically analyze the conclusions
drawn in over a decade of psychological
research on this patient in preparation for
their papers and class presentations. At the
end of the term, students will go to the base
ment of the BCS department, where they
will meet J.B. and play with his soft rolls of

fat until he begins to alternately giggle and
weep, his well-fed body chafing against his
iron manacles.
While some may complain that these
technical schools embrace non-standard
approaches to areas of humanities, non
technical schools are guilty of a similar
crime — namely, introducing loose inter
pretations of technical material. It is enter
taining to notice the differences in approach
that these two kinds of schools have on the
same topic. Caltech offers an interesting
class on robots through its Computation
and Neural Systems Department.
CNS 261. History of Robots. Course will
trace the conception and implementation of
robots from the Fifties to today. Emphasis
on the evolution of robotic design and its
mathematics.
On the other hand, Yale University has a
strong humanist mindset, and it offers a his
torical perspective on robots that clearly
indicates a commitment to this tradition.
Anthropology 193. Robot History. Survey
of key events in robot history. Topics: the
early societies of Egyptian robots made
from limestone and papyrus, the institution
of robot slavery in ancient Greece and the
Great Transistor Famine of 1845. Emphasis
on the evolution of Robo erectus and the
development of the opposable claw.
While some of these courses may sound
interesting, we should all be thankful that
our university restricts its course offerings
to less absurd academic topics. I'm off to
study for my French & Italian course, "Star
Trek, The Next Generation: Parables of
Philosophy."

Eugene Park, a master's student in philoso
phy, is just a robot doing a silly robot
dance.
