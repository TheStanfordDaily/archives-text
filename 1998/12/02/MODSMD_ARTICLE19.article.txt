## The science behind boosting your machismo

ARE YOU SEXY? Do you know
how to be? If you're female, you
know the answers to these vital
questions, or at least where to find them.
Any Glamour or Cosmo can teach a girl to
be a sexy goddess in seven easy steps. All a
woman really needs to do is put on some
eyeliner, tease her hair and wear a push-up
bra.
But how can a man be sexy? Can that
mysterious male animal magnetism be
pinned down? To help all you floundering
Stanford men, I studied the sexiest men I
know. We'll call them Dustin Moowers and
Shamu Smith. Here's what I discovered:
How to Dress Sexy
Wear something with high tactile proper
ties, i.e., something girls will want to touch.
Silk, velour and crushed velvet are all highly
recommended. If you're feeling especially
wild, wear animal prints like leopard spots or
zebra stripes. Growl when girls pet you.
Better yet, wear no shirt at all. Have
phrases like "I'm da bomb" tattooed across
your lower back. Or "I love mom." Then
you'll look sensitive.
Exploit the advances of any woman. If she

touches you, she wants you. Take her to
your room without delay. Immediately
touch her boobs.
How to Sound Sexy
Speak with a foreign accent. Visit the
restaurant Steps of Rome in North Beach
and study how to be smooth Italiano. Sere
nade girls in your ostensibly native tongue.
Just make sure they doesn't know the lan
guage before you pretend to speak it.
If you don't think you can pull off the for
eign trick, just pretend you're a pimp. Call
girls "my skanky ho" or "bee-yatch" and
they will want you.
How to Dance Sexy
You have to dance. Even if you think you
can't dance, you really can if you just believe
in yourself. The only way you can be a bad
dancer is if you inflict pain on other people
while getting your groove on. Don't start
moshing unless you're considerably smaller
than the girl you're dancing with. If you dip
her (a very sexy move), don't bang her head
on your knee or drop her and walk away.
How to Date Sexy
Date several women at once. Make sure
they know about one another. Plav them off

one another, but reassure each one that
she's the only girl you really care about.
Point out that because so many women want
you, she's lucky to be the one you're with at
the moment. Threaten to leave to hook up
with one of the others. Point out that she's
fat and unworthy of your masculine atten
tions. Again, grab her boobs if necessary.
Do something romantic for a first date.
Let her buy you dinner, then snuggle up in
your dorm lounge and watch a flick, prefer
ably a porno. Sexy films include "Sorority
Sex Kittens III" and "Girls of Hooters'." Or
you can show her the video of the stripper
you danced with on your 18th birthday.
She'll be inspired.
Go out on a date. Sleep with her. By that
time you're going to be rather bored with
her as girls really aren't all that much fun to
talk to. Then don't call her for two or three
weeks. She'll get upset and call you. Have
your roommates pretend to be on the other
line long distance so you don't have to talk
to her. Say you'll call her back. Then don't.
Just ignore her.
How to Live Sexy
Make sure your bed is private. Have a

cupboard as a bed. or at least dark curtains.
If you're too lazy to modify your bed. you
can make out in your closet.
Call your room La Casa de Sexo. Live in a
one-room double in Serra. Those are the
pimpest.
I low to be Mysteriously Sexy
Be enigmatic. Introduce yourself with an
alias such as Chester Copperpot or Gerhard
Casper. Set up a fake e-mail account, pre
tend you're a freshman girl and e-mail
women random messages.
Send flowers with a blank card, or include
a mysterious message like "Congratula
tions" or "Good luck" for no reason. Secret
ly put 2(K) golf balls in her room. Cover her
floor in golf balls so she slips and breaks her
leg. Then you can drive her to the hospital,
and she will want you.
How to Party Sexy
Drink a lot. Passing out is very sexy. Puk
ing in her bed will make her want to take
care of you. She'll say that she doesn't like it.
She's lying. She really loves it. Once she
baby-sits you she'll want your hot body for
ever. Puke is the ultimate aphrodisiac. But
vou don't want to lose all control of your

bodily 112 unctions. Contrary to popular belief,
most girls don't really enjoy being peed on.
Crush beer cans on your forehead. Girls
will want to kiss your scars all better. Scars
are very sexy. Look how many girls love
Harrison Ford's little scar on his chin. The
more you have the better. Remember to
make up stories emphasizing what a stud
you were when you got your scar. Don't
admit you eut yourself shaving. Say you got
your scar in a bar fight defending your ex
girlfriend. You treated her great, but for
some inexplicable reason the lying, cheating
slut dumped you. Just wait until you get your
hands around her neck Oh wait, leave
that last bit out. You can share that later.
These tips can get you started, but the ulti
mate key to sexiness is confidence and hard
work. You must think sexy, study sexy, eat
sexy, breathe sexy. Look in the mirror, look
deep into your gorgeous eyes and say, "Oh,
you sexy man." Then the uirls will want you.
