# Humanites must expand cultural, epochal boundaries
## Soyinka speaks to packed house 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
Universities seriously committed
to the humanities should strive to ex
pand the scope of humanities disci
plines, Wole Soyinka told a nearly
packed Kresge Auditorium on Mon
day night. Soyinka, the winner of the
1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, is a
professor of arts at Emory Universi
ty-
In a lecture officially titled "Con
temporary Literature and the Future
of the Humanities in Higher Educa
tion," Soyinka argued that the down
fall of the humanities in institutions of
higher education will result from in
sularity and the construction of barri
ers between cultures and epochs.
C iiven "the fascination of Holly
wood for a singular historical person
age," those weaned on the Western
tradition regard the rich texts of Indi

an, Arabic, and Yoruban culture as
marginal texts, Soyinka said.
For most westerners, these epics
are so foreign they "could have been
episodes from Star Trek." Soyinka
added that the absence of geography
studies in universities has created a
void that "has contributed to that in
sularity of mind."
"The geography of the U.S.A. is
not the geography of the world. [Ge
ography] is the heart of human dis
persal, settling, culture, and [there
fore] civilization," he said.
"Even hostile worlds do impinge
and some kind of artistic dialogue
[persists]. Insularity [of space and
time] in the humanities ... is guaran
teed to spell the death of that disci
pline ... in a world that will not re
main static," Soyinka said.
In her introduction of Soyinka,
Drama Prof. Anna Deavere Smith
said that Soyinka's work maps out a
"lifelong pursuit of truth and the aus
picious ... consequences inherent"
in that endeavor.
"He is fearless," she said, recalling
Soyinka's history of political dissi
dence, which includes his four-year
exile from Nigeria for opposing the
dictatorial regime of Sani Abacha,
who died in June.
Soyinka has displayed "mastery..
. of the very tongue that had colo
nized [his] home," Smith said.
Soyinka recounted his first experi
ences with literature as a three-year
old in Nigeria, scouring the pages of a
clothing catalogue.
He soon after encountered the
Greek epics and tragedies, and the
works of Shakespeare.
"I plunged into its wild improba
ble tale, enchanting in its lyrical lan
guage," he said. "Where were these
lands located? Were they homo
logues in my own environment?"
Soyinka criticized eurocentricity
as well as political correctness for its
insularity.

The adherents of political correct
ness are the "supposed custodian of
the humanities."

The result of political correctness,
Soyinka said, is an "over-cornpen
