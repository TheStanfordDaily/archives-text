# Donor, fundraiser Ford dies
## 
### Jennie Berry Editorial staff 
Thomas Ford — a man who
never graduated from Stanford hut
who over a span of more than four
decades served the University as a
trustee, a fundraiser and a major fi
nancial benefactor — died Monday
of a heart attack.
"Certainly, his philanthropy,
which touches every corner of the
campus, epitomized his great intelli
gence and caring," said University
President Gerhard Casper in a press
release. "Tom was not an alumnus of
Stanford. He was a convert to Stan
ford."
As a member of the Board of
Trustees, Ford was active in the
Stanford Centennial Campaign and
chairman of the Peninsula Major
Gifts Committee.
"He was a marvelous fundrais
er," said David Glen, associate vice
president for development.
Ford, during the Centennial
Campaign, led a fundraising cam
paign to build the Haas Center for
Public Service.
He remained active at the Haas
Center as a member and then direc
tor of its National Advisory Board.
"He was an exemplar in his gen
erosity of the kinds of people we
hope to encourage, and in doing so
he made it possible for others to fol
low in his footsteps," explained Tim
Stanton, the director of the Haas
Center.
Ford was particularly interested
in projects in which Stanford stu
dents would work with local children
and support them in getting into col
lege.
He also helped start an invest
ment fund for the Athletics Depart
ment that now is worth about $20
million.
Perhaps the reason Ford was
such a successful fundraiser was be
cause he well understood what it was
to be one giving the funds.
"Tom was not only a sophisticat-

Ed volunteer but a very understand
ing and sophisticated donor as well,"
Glen explained.
Ford was a major donor to the
Ford Center for Sports and Recre
ation, which was rehabilitated dur
ing the Centennial Campaign, and
he served on the athletic board for
many years.
"He was a great person to have
on our team," said John Kates, di
rector of major gifts for the Athletics
Department.
An avid sports fan. Ford cheered
for the Cardinal at football, basket
ball and baseball games alike.
He continued his support of the
athletes once they were off the play
ing field too. Ford's firm hired many
former Stanford students in his busi
ness or helped them positions with
friends.
Sponsoring faculty as well as stu
dents, Ford endowed a chair in the
School of Engineering, but he de
clined to have the chair named after
himself. He also helped endow a
chair in the Law School.
"Any time you have an endowed
chair it gives an institution the abili
ty to go out and recruit more high
class faculty and the competition for
good faculty is incredibly high," said
Martin Shell, associate dean for ex
ternal relations at the Law School.
Ford, a trustee of the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, was
one of the hospital's major donors.
Despite all of the money he gave
to the University, staff across cam
pus said the thing they would miss
most about Ford was working with
him.
"He had a great sense of humor,
but he was businesslike in his ap
proach," said Glen, who worked
closely with Ford over the last 10
years. "If he had criticism, he would
give criticism, but it was always con
structive."
Ford started working at Stanford
as early as 1955. He first was legal
counsel with the Stanford Universi
ty Business Office and then director

of land development. In the latter
position, Ford worked to create and
expand the Stanford Research Park.
Ford, though giving much to the
University, contributed his time and
energy to the community outside
Stanford too.
He was managing partner of
Ford Land Co. and the leading de
veloper of the Sand Hill Road Corri
dor.
Now the more than 40 firms
along Sand Hill Road, including
Ford's 3000 Sand Hill Road center
piece, control as much as one-third
of the nation's $12 billion in venture
capital, according to industry insid
ers.
"He created at 3000 Sand Hill a
unique entrepreneurial community
that has had an important role in the
development of this area as a center
of high technology," said Biology
Prof. Donald Kennedy, University
president during much of the time
Ford served as a trustee.
He gave a portion of his partner
ship in 3000 Sand Hill Road to the
Peninsula Community Foundation;
the gift is estimated to be $1 million
per year.
Another annual contribution he
has given is a $1,000 scholarship to
each student from East Palo Alto's
Ravenswood School District who at
tends college.
Originally a Midwesterner, Ford
received his schooling on the oppo
site side of the United States. He re
ceived bachelor's degrees in eco
nomics and industrial engineering
from Yale in 1942 and a law degree
from the University of Michigan in
1949.
In between college and law
school, Ford served as a Navy lieu
tenant in the South Pacific during
World War 11.
Ford is survived by his wife
Susan, five children and five grand
children.
Memorial services will be held on
Monday, Dec. 7, at 4 p.m. in Memo
rial Church.
