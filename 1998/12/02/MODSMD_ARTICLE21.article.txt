# Tired of knocked-out teeth?
## Students push University to discuss bicycle traffic problems 
### Danielle Chang Contributing writer 
It was a close call. His wrist was
two inches from the front wheel of
a bike, as his body lay on the as
phalt of Lasuen Mall. Everyone
froze on the street watching the
accident unfold. Shortly after, he
got up on his in-line skates and
waltzed through the stunned
crowd to his destination. The
biker pedaled on, the onlookers
walked on, that was the end of the
story.
In an ASSIJ meeting two weeks
ago, a group of law students con
cerned with bike safety presented
a petition concerning the regula
tion of bike traffic. In response,
President Casper has agreed to
iniate a group to discuss these
problems, although no formal
group has yet been formed.
Biking accidents seem to be so
common on this campus nick
named "Beijing by the Bay" that
people take accidents as a fact of
life.
Fifty-six accidents were counted
in 1996, 34 in 1997 and 32 have
been reported this year through
Nov. 1, according to Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Hcrrington.
However, the accidents docu
mented were only those so severe
that the police or the paramedics
were called to the scene.
The count excludes injuries
treated at the same day care of
Cowell Student Health Services,
such as scratches, scrapes, lacera
tions and bone fractures.
"Teeth are knocked out quite a
bit |in biking accidents," added
Robin Topper, chief of medical
services at Cowell.
Depending on road and weather
conditions, the number of injuries

varies. "We do see them [hiking
injuries] every day, sometimes
three in a day," said Topper. Cow
ell has treated so far this year an
average of three to seven hiking
injuries a week.
The numbers aren't astounding
considering that 12,(MX) to 15,(XX)
bikers hit the road on any given
day.
The bike volume is expected to
increase with officials gradually
reducing the motor vehicle park
ing on campus, and controlling
motor access to certain routes.
The University has spent $650,(XX)
over the last few years to promote
biking by installing 4,(KM) addition
al new and improved bike racks,
building bike storage lockers,
garages, and showers for com
muters, and providing biking
route maps.
Yet, bike traffic goes virtually
unregulated on campus. The only
rule governing the inner campus
traffic seems to be the Darwinian
theory of survival as pedestrians
compete with bikers and bikers
compete with one another on
crowded paths. Car drivers are
confused as whether to treat bik
ers as their same kind or as privi
leged pedestrians.
"I have a million incidents see
ing bikers zooming in front of me
across the street while I was dri
ving," said Shelley Bischoff, grad
uate student in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program. "[l|
fear that there's going to be a biker
who sails right through the stop
sign."
"It baffles me that student's
don't know the traffic law applies
to motor vehicles and bikes," said
John Ciccarelli, bicycle program
manager.
At UC-Berkeley, bikers aren't

allowed to ride within 10 feet of a
pedestrian, and must always give
pedestrians the right of way. A dis
mount system is also adopted in
which biking is prohibited from
7:45 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. in designated
regions.
UC-Davis has a strict lane sys
tem and professional bicycle pa
trols overseeing biking behavior
on campus.
At Davis, said Bischoff, a for
mer Davis undergraduate, "every
street has a bike path that's clearly
marked and there were cops
everywhere, so people don't vio
late rules as much."
Attempting to tame its biking
herds, Stanford Police intended to
debut the Stanford bicycle patrol
unit in spring quarter 1997.
But the Stanford Police Depart
ment is so shorthanded in staff
that the four trained bicycle cops
are only utilized for special events
that involve large crowds.
"We don't have the resources.
We just can't afford it," said police
chief Marv Herrington.
Stanford's status as a private en
tity, prohibits it from making laws
like other state-affiliated universi
ties.

"We can't puss laws ourselves,
it's done through county ordi
nance systems," said Herrington.
In an attempt to alleviate one
problem area, the University plan
ning office has added a pedestrian
walkway to the side of Lasuen
Mall, hut few students realize the
purpose of the narrow swath of
sand. Most use it as an expanded
bicycle parking area.
As an alternative to the lack of
bike path funding and a formal
adaptation of traffic laws on cam
pus. many seem to favor the biking
education idea.
"I don't like to see this becom
ing a police problem," said Her
rington. "It's really an educational
problem."
For years, C'iccarelli and Her
rington tried to persuade Student
Affairs to schedule a biking educa
tion session in the September ori
entation program.
"If students take ownership of
this issue, they are more effective
in educating their peers," Herring
ton said.
"Raising the level of awareness
a little bit." Herrington added,
"we can get a lot closer to sanity
than we have right now."
