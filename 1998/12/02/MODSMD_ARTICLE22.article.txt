# Rick gives 'tour of death' for Dead Week
## 
### Jose Paterno 
Monday night, a dark, wet Stan
ford campus set the perfect stage
for Assoc. Anthropology Prof.
John Rick's annual Tour of Death,
sponsored by the Stanford Archae
ology Association.
The Death Tour began four
years ago as a dorm event, when
Rick was the resident fellow for
Adams House.
The tour focused not only on
death in Stanford's early history
but also on the unusual history of
Stanford's founding family, which
Rick described as "both idolized
and despised during its day."
"It was a good break from the
books and a good start to Dead
Week," said freshman Allison
Lewis.
Donning his Indiana Jones hat,
Rick led a group of 60 curious stu
dents through Stanford's notorious
"Landscape of Death."
Guided by the moonlight and a
few flashlights, the tour began with
Rodin's "Gates of Hell," outside
the Stanford Art Museum, and
continued on to the Barn, the
Angel of Grief and finally the
Mausoleum.
"Not many people on campus
know the history and stories be
hind the Stanford family and these
sights," said freshman Andy Mar
tin.
Rick started the tour by describ
ing the Native American struggle
to keep the land and how they were
forcefully removed from this area
in the late 1800s.
Since then, archaeologists have
excavated the buried remains of
550 Native Americans on campus
and returned them to their descen
dants.
He also gave his audience a de
tailed history of Leland Stanford
Sr.'s rise into wealth and society,
discussing his modest beginnings

as a lawyer as well as his successful
business dealings in commerce and
railroads.
Leland Stanford Sr.'s accom
plishments also included being
Governor of California, a U.S. sen
ator, a racehorse mogul and a mass
producer of alcohol.
Rick also noted that the "found
ing of Stanford went beyond the
death of Little Leland."
Because Jane Stanford's broth
ers died before she did, she was
able to direct more of her family's
money toward the University.
Beyond basic history. Rick had
many lively anecdotes and little
known stories.
For example, not many people
know that someone attempted to
murder Jane Stanford.
One morning, she awoke to find
her morning glass of water poi
soned with enough strychnine to
"kill a team of horses," according
to Rick.
Soon afterward, while in
Hawaii, she died mysteriously.
Evidence exists that she died of
prolonged poisoning and not of
natural causes, as the University's
official position states.
According to Rick, the Honolu
lu police still consider the death an
unsolved case.
At the Mausoleum, Rick ex
plained the Mausoleum's long his
tory and touched on its survival of
the Earthquake of 1906.
He described Leland Jr.'s life
and tragic death in Europe.
Leland Stanford Jr. was an avid
archaeologist and was pursuing his
interests in Europe with his par
ents before he died of typhoid
fever a few weeks before his 16th
birthday.
The official tour ended at the
Mausoleum, but Rick offered stu
dents a visit to one more site â€” the
small, secluded cactus garden
planted by Jane Stanford herself.
