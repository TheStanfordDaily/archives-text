## X marks the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Concern over Ritalin sparks new diagnosis of ADHD 
### Cindy Lin 
Short attention span. Poor listening skills Failure to
follow directions. Although ill reprimands at com
mon for any child, up to 7 pciceut of school-aeed chil
dren who regularly exhibit these characteristics are
diagnosed wit! attention deficit hyperactivity disoi
der.
Stanford researchers ree ntlv made a promising
step towards an objective di nosis ol ADHI). i la
tive of attention dc icit order. I lie rese irehers
focused on the effects >1 Rain. an aniphetamin. like
stimulant, on brain activity in the basal ganglia the
part of the brain involved in the regulation ol volun
tary movement. In hyperactive children. Ritalin
increased brain activity in the basal ganglia. I lowevcr.
it was found that Ritalin decreased activity in children
without the condition.
The little-understood disorder is usualK diagnosed
by doctors based on secondhand reports of behavioi
from parents and teachers. Critics say this practice
results in some children being wronglv diagnosed
when they arc merely energetic 01 misbehaving out ol
boredom.
Lead researchers in this study were \ssoe. Psychol
ogy Prof. John Gabrieli and research associate Chan
dan Vaidya. According to Vaidya. motivation for this
study drew from concern over the increase in Ritalin
prescriptions in past years.
"The drug has been around for a long time, and
there are no major risks lot giving it to healthy chil
dren although they report the side effects of drowsi
ness and loss of appetite." Vaidya said. " I he feai
comes from how the rates for prescription ol this thug
have doubled in the past 15 years. I his seems to be a

likely outcome, however, because there is no estab
lished objective diagnostic tool.
According to Director ol Special Lducation for Las
Lomitas and Menlo Park school districts Deedra
Devine. some children who receive inconclusive diag
noses are still given prescriptions for Ritalin.
"Occasionally we have knowledge of a student on
Ritalin who was under an uncertain diagnosis."
Devine said "The determination of the disorder is
then based on whether or not the child responds to tlie
medication. \ clearer documentation ol the disorder
based on scientific data rather than from secondhand
sources, like teachers or parents, would be much to our
benefit."
I he researchers studied 16 boys between the ages
of eight and 13. I en ol the boys had been diagnosed
with ADHD, and six had not been diagnosed.
I lie bov s were instructed to play a mental game
while ly ing in an MRI device. I hey were instructed to
press a button when they saw any letter of the alpha
bet except the lettei X flashed on a display screen,
bach child needed to resist his impulse to press the
button when he s;n\ ;m \ among the many letters. The
task was most difficult foi boys with ADHD because
of their poor impulse control.
Bv using functional magnetic resonance imaging
technology, researchers could see differences in the
brain functioning between a child with ADHD and
normal children.
"We measured brain activity in the frontal lobes
and in the basal ganglia," said Gabrieli. "Ritalin
increases Ironial-lobe activity for a concentration
demanding task in boys with and without ADHD."
"I lowevcr. in the basal ganglia there were opposite
effects," he said. "Ritalin increased activity in the boys

with ADI ID. but decreased activity in the control boys
without A Dill )."
\ecording to (iary (ilovcr of the Stanford Medical
Center's Radiology Department, who co-authored the
study, the use of I MRI lor diagnosing ADI ID is a sub
stantial improvement on past methods of diagnosis,
because there is less risk involved for the patient.
"In the past they used positron emission, which
involved the injection of radioisotopes, and there was
always the potential of damage from ioni/ing radia
tion. ' (ilovcr said. " I he advantage of I MRI is that il
is widely available and non-invasive."
Vaidya says that the I MRI relies on naturally
occurring changes in brain activity.
" Hie I MRI uses special software added onto a reg
ular MRI and is able to pick up on differences in the
magnetic properties of blood in different areas of the
brain," Vaidy a said. "When a certain area of the brain
is more active, we can see on the LMRI the contrast of
oxygenated blood and deoxvgenated blood in differ
ent areas."
Dr. Glenn Austen, a co-author of the study, noted
the differences in the brains of those with ADI ID and
those without.
"We found that children with ADHD have low
blood oxygen in the area o! the brain which is the con
duit between the frontal lobe, the thinking or intelli
gent part of the brain, and the part of the brain con
trolling emotions," Austen said.
"So. the children know what they're supposed to
do. but because their frontal lobe has no control ovei
this... emotional aspect til the brain, they don't act on
it."he said.
Gabrieli believes that these findings pinpoint the
area of the brain affected bv ADI ID, which could lead

u> ;iltentative treatments for the disorder.
" I his suggests that othei treatments, not necessari
ly with drugs, ought to act on brain areas thai are not
functioning optimal!) in ADI ID," Gabrieli said.
(iabrieli cautions that more tests must be conduct
ed in order to show both whether FMRlscan be used
to diagnose ADHD and whether the "signature" brain
difference in children with this disorder can be accept
ed iis the universal marker.
"At a minimum, this needs to be replicated in a
largei sample, extended to girls, and extended to chil
dren newl\ diagnosed with ADHD who have not yet
taken medications." (iabrieli said.
