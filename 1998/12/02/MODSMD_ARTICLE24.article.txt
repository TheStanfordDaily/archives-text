# Finding new ways to fight HIV
## Changing strategies 
### Greg Miller 
The best strategy for treating
HIV infection may not involve
attacking the virus itself. A recent
study by Stanford researchers sug
gests that a more effective strategy
may be to interfere with the virus'
ability to utilize the cellular
resources of its host.
"Traditional therapies all
attack the virus itself," said (iary
Nolan, assistant professor of
molecular pharmacology and
senior author of the study-
Currently available treatments
for HIV infection rely on anti
viral drugs that attack molecular
targets unique to the virus. I'he
problem with this approach.
Nolan said, is that it does not take
long for the virus to change itself.
Like many viruses, HIV can
mutate rapidly. As a result of its
genetic malleability, the virus is
able to evolve resistance to anti
viral drugs in a short period of
time. Thus, many treatment
strategies that rely on these drm
are only temporarily effective in
combating HIV.
In hopes of sidestepping this
roadblock, Nolan and his col
leagues have been investigating
the cellular events that underlie
HIV infection.
"The goal of 11IV," said Nolan,
"is to integrate its genetic material
into our genetic material."
The virus uses the genetic
machinery of infected host cells to
make copies of itself. In order to
do that, however, it needs to use
resources in the cells of its host.
For example, in order for the virus
to replicate, it must use the liosi
cells' supply of nucleotides, the
building blocks of DN A.
HlV's reliance on the cellular
resources of its host was the inspi
ration for the current experi
ments.
"Whv not go after something
the virus has to use â€” cut off its
line of supply?" Nolan said.
To test this approach, the
group of researchers, led by Nolan
and postdoctoral fellow Shigemi
Kinoshita. conducted experiments
with isolated human immune cells
from blood donated to the Stan
ford Mood (enter. In particular,
they used a class of immune cells
called helper T cells.
Helper 1 ells are essential to
thw function of the immune sys
tem and are preferentially infect
ed by HIV. This is why the virus is

so devastating infected I cells
are unable to perform their not
mal functions, and as a result, the
body's ability to fend off infection
is severely compromised.
Most helpei T cells in the body
are in an inactive state and
become activated in response to
an invading microbe. Nolan
explained. HIV can nter I cells
when they are in the inactive state,
but the virus is not able to repli
cate until the I cells become aeti
vated. In other words, something
that happens during I cell activa
tion is necessary for MI \ to repli
cate.
In the cur rent studv. Nolan and
his colleagues sought to detei
mine what that soinethinu might
be.
The group exposed the helper
Tcells to HIV while the cells were
in the inactive state \ subset of
the cells was then treated with a
protein called NIAI. which is
produced by healthy I cells and
has been shown to lu necessary
for I cell activation.
The researchers monitored
H!\ replication in both groups of
'1 cells. I hey found that the
NFA'I treated cells exhibited
high rates of HIV replication,
whereas the untreated cells did
not.
"This is the first studv that
shows a molecular device that
HIV must access in I cells to fur
ther its integration and replica
tion." Nolan said.
In another set of experiments,
the group showed that wo drugs
that interfere with NFAI .
cyclosporin and FKS(Ki. blocked
HIV replication.
Unfortunately, these two drugs
are not likely candidates for lII V
treatments because they have a
global effect on the immune sys
tem. Nolan said that cyclosporin
and FKSO6 "wouldn't even be
considered toi therapy because
they're immunosuppressant."
Nonetheless, these experi
ments suggest a promising
approach to HIV treatment. I lie
hope is that some of the cellular
processes involved in I cell aetiva
tion are necessary for HIV repli
cation. while not essential to the
functioning of the immune sys
tem.
Drugs that interfere with these
processes would present a far
greater evolutionary challenge for
the virus than traditional anti-viral
drugs.
