As 1111.1 Is week approaches, main Stanford students may he packing
their hags for that quarterly trek to the 24-hour study room. Although the

laugh.
Research on sleep why we need it. how much we need it and why
we can't get it has exploded in recent \ ears, and the findings have some
disturbing implications for the average college student
According to a recent article in Current Health 2. people who sleep
hctter may become better learners in general, but many college students
do not get nearly enough sleep.
Senioi Pascale (ioupillaud was asked how much sleep she gets per
night, on average. "Probably five hours six hours maybe." she said.
"Not enough," she said.
I .aek ol sleep or improper sleeping habits can result in reduced pro
ductivity increased cat accidents and even increased heart troubles,
according to a recent study published in Vibrant l.ifc. A recent New
1 lanipshue stud\ found that two out of three high school students claimed
they suffered from lack of sleep, while one out of five reported they had
fallen asleep while driving.
I lie same storv is true for adults too. While adults need to sleep seven

to eight hours a night, some may need more. A recent study showed that
those who only slept six hours a night on average experienced

more frequent health problems, and even a shorter lifespan.
An understanding of how the bodv sleeps a sub

ject that is a mystery to many may illustrate \vh\ lack
ol sleep can be so harmful and help pinpoint what one

A person's sleep cycle is subject to biological
patterns called circadian rhythms. I liese inter

nal rhythms are linked to the day-night

light

eves to the brain via nerve pathways. Ihese end in the pineal gland, located
deep in the cerebral hemishperes. which releases the melatonin. Researchers
suspect that melatonin is the major inducer of sleep in the circadian cycle.
Other sleep triggers may arise from the internal cycles of body chemi
cals or may be related to the immune system, which may trigger sleep as
a natural defense against disease.
Although researchers are undecided on the exact nature of these sleep
triggers, the end result is the targeting of small clusters of brain cells called
raphe nuclei. I hese nuclei send nerve impulses that turn off wakefulness
centers in the brain.
The cycle of sleeping is made up ol many different stages which Hue
tu.ile during sleep. Most dreams are experienced during rapid eye move
ment sleep, or RIM. Brain activity actually increases by about 20 percent
during this sleep phase Rl M is required to make sleep restful and
refreshing.
Subject to the normal cycles ol sleep, the body switches between REM
and non-RE M sleep every 90 to 110 minutes on average, with REM sleep
taking up five to 30 minutes of each cycle.
Your body's rhythms may strike timing the daytime also. Although
afternoon sleepiness is often attributed to too large a meal, it is actually
lust a typical result of the the fluctuation of the sleep cycle.
In order to maintain the most consistent sleep patterns possible,
researchers suggest avoiding chemicals which can wreak havoc on these
normal cycles.

Alcohol can disrupt Rl \l sleep, and sleeping pills can harmfully adjust
normal sleep patterns. Smoking can also inhibit good sleeping.

because nicotine is a stimulant.

I'he primary reason, though, that college students are

such constant complainers of kick of sleep may be attribut
ed lo the lack of a fixed sleeping schedule. Studies have

demonstrated that it is best to keep regular sleep pat

terns and wake up at the same time every morn

it is suggested that you wake up at your nor
