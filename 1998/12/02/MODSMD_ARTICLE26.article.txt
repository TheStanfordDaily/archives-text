"William Baxters contributions

School since 1952 and taught Bax
ter in the 19505, Baxter was "one of

ship: in mid-career, he educated
himself in economics and applied
economic insights to a remarkable
range of legal issues."

federal government on numerous
occasions during this time, working
on a wide variety of public issues.
According to Mann . "The range
and breadth of his intellectual in
terests was formidable to say the
least."
I le was a consultant for the Fed
eral Aviation Administration,
helping to evaluate the economic
costs ol airport noise.
I le also served on two I J.S. Pres
idents' task forces, working with
the Johnson administration on an
titrust policy and with the Nixon

tions policy.
While consulting for ( itibank in
the late 19705, Baxter collaborated
with Law School colleague Ken
neth Scott and Paul Coolner, a
(iraduate School of Business pro
lessor. on a study of the economics

Baxter joined the Department
of Justice as assistant attorney gen
eral in charge of antitrust policy in
1981.
He brought the Justice Depart
ment's seven-year antitrust case
against AT&T to a settlement by
dismantling AT&T's stranglehold
on the American long-distance
telephone market.
He forced AT&T to break
apart, resulting in the reorganiza
tion ol the U.S. telephone industry
and the creation of regional local
phone companies known as "Baby
Bells."
Baxter's dismissal of the 13-year
old antitrust suit against IBM
stirred up controversy, as he had
not disclosed that a research lei
lowship he received in 196K was
funded partially by IBM.
However, an internal investiga
tion by tlie Department of Justice
cleared him of any misconduct or
conflict of interest, and upheld his
dismissal of the suit.
After leaving the Justice De
partment in 1983, Baxter returned
to the Law School to teach antitrust
law as an emeritus professor.
Law School Professor Kenneth
Scott, who graduated with Baxter
from the Law School in 1956 and
had played a weekly bridge game
with him for 30 years, summed up
Baxter's legacy: "He redirected an
titrust policy to a foundation of rig
orous analysis that persists to this
very day."
He is survived by his wife and
three children, and will be memori
alized in a private service.
