# Tresidder expands options for onsite catering services
## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
A campus with a historic dis
taste for monopolies is now free of
one more. Bon Appetit. the organi
zation that operates the Corner
Pocket, the Coffee House and the
Tresidder cafe, will no longer have
exclusive catering rights for out
side or student run events held in
Tresidder Union.
I he new contract negotiated be
tween Bon Appetit and Tresidder
brought about the changed policy.
According to Leonie Batkin.
manager of property services for
the Stanford Management Compa
ny, "Students and student groups
can now have brown bags or other
caterers. ()ther groups, like an aca
demic office for example, can only
use Tresidder caterers — Polio
Rey, Jamba Juice or, of course,
Bon Appetit."

Before the new contract's adop
tion. all groups holding functions in
Tresidder were required to use
Bon Appetit if they planned to
have their events catered.
Students have reacted very pos
itively to the change.
"It's nice that Tresidder is giving
student groups a choice in the mat
ter. The opportunity for compari
son shopping could have helped us
out especially in regard to cost,
since catering our event was a big
chunk of our budget," said sopho
more Alexis Kaminsky, who re
cently organized a Bon Appetit
catered panel in Tresidder for
Stanford Advocates for Children.
The catering change also re
solves the onerous problem of
catering Tresidder functions dur
ing the summer months, when
event organizers had difficulty
working with Bon Appetit. Stu
dent-run groups will now have the

convenience of using Housing and
Dining Services to cater summer
events, said Batkin.
The contract will also provide
for another change that students
may notice. According to Batkin,
the Coffee House will have its
kitchen remodeled in the coming
year, though plans have not yet
been finalized.
In other Tresidder-related
news, the Dean of Students Office,
the ASSU and Bon Appetit have
worked out a plan to have the first
floor cafe at Tresidder stay open
until 2 a.m. until the end of the
quarter. This schedule follows the
pattern established last spring
quarter for dead and finals week.
In addition, for the remainder of
the quarter these groups will be
providing complimentary food and
drinks in the first floor cafe during
hours when the Corner Pocket is
not in operation.
