# PA artist paints her way off the streets
## Artist Alma White and student Kelly Naylor start business to market White's art 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
Palo Alto-born artist and craftswoman
Alma White pulled herself up with a little
help from her friends. Now one of these
friends, Kelly Naylor, is helping engineer
her success as she paints her way out of
Palo Alto's homeless shelters.
White, 46, and Naylor, a coterminal
student in civil and environmental engi
neering, started a business last March
called Expressions in Ebony: Urban Art.
The company will market White's art
works — her colorful prints, greeting cards
and stationery centering on African-
Americans, and all based on her original
paintings.
Naylor plans to remain at Stanford for
two more years, assuring the future of Ex
pressions in Ebony. The two have a 10-
year business plan, and are seeking artists
and people with business expertise to join
the company.
"We even have an East Coast distribu
tor," Naylor said. "My mother is helping
us sell these back in Maryland."
White is a proud graduate of the East
Palo Alto Start-Up program, which helps
people start small businesses. She became
homeless a couple of years after her moth
er, an East Palo Alto resident, died, and
spent some nights sleeping on University
Avenue park benches.
At the urging of a friend. White went to
the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto. She
stayed there for four and a half months,
and now rents a room in Palo Alto's Bark
er 1 lotel on Emerson Street. She also be
came inspired to try painting again.
"I made Ds and Fs in the art classes 1
did take [in high school and at Canada
College]," White said. "But look at me
now."
White paints with acrylic. Her works
encompass many themes from African-
American life, and the subjects range from
the exuberant and idyllic to the gritty.

women playfully toss stars and planets and

locks, sometimes singeing her scalp and
often inadvertently frying her hair in the
hot hair grease.

touching her thick, curly hair frosted with
gray at the temples.
There are stylistic signatures to White's
work. She doesn't title her paintings; in
stead she lumps them into general themes.
Also, the people in her paintings don't
have faces. "I used to paint their faces,"
she said. "Hut I stopped," because the in
dividual faces were just not important to
her.
"I say that this one comes from my Pi
casso period," she said of one colorful, yet
moody portrait of a woman's head and
shoulders.
White also makes dolls. Last May, she
led a workshop at the Haas Center to
teach Stanford students to make them.
She sold dolls for years at craft fairs and
had several receptions before she and
Naylor officially started their business.
White has high hopes for Expressions
in Ebony. She wants to import and export

artwork, and expand her creative reper
toire. Naylor and White want to produce
T-shirts, ceramic tiles and tote bags. The
Haas Center, in fact, used one of her paint
ings as a design on a T-shirt and tote bag.
Naylor said the company eventually
will have two sides: a nonprofit teaching

enterprise, with White as the primary art
instructor, and the for-profit art sales.
The symbiosis between the two women
began when they met last February
through Julia Dinsmore, a writer, poet and
homeless activist, at a function held by
Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition.
The group is designed to introduce stu
dents to homeless persons and issues.
Dinsmore came to the Haas Center for
Public Service as part of the Challenges
and Dilemmas of Public Service Dialogue
series. She performed a dialogue, "Art As
a Form of Social Action." White had been
invited to the event because she knew peo
ple from the homeless coalition, as she
herself had been homeless.
"Alma and Julia engaged in a lively
conversation during the event, sharing and
enjoying one another's experiences and
artistic energy," Naylor said. "Their dy
namic was so captivating — two women

whose art expressed such beauty and hope
for the world. Yet [the art's] origins [were
born J from years of struggle in poverty and
homelessness."
After the event, White showed Dins
more and Naylor some of her paintings.
They bonded instantly, and a month later.
Expressions in Ebony was born.
"Alma's passion and creative spirit was
so powerful, I couldn't help but be drawn
in," Naylor said.
"Their rapport is wonderful — they
have tons of energy when they're togeth
er," said Molly Haile, an administrative as
sociate at Stanford's Haas Center for Pub
lic Service.
White helps Naylor bear up under the
pressures of being a Stanford engineering
student. "Alma always reminds me to be
in love with the world and life — even in fi
nals week," Naylor said.
In return, Naylor carries White's art
work around and sells it whenever she can.
"She's my good friend," White said as
she squeezed Naylor's hand. "Kelly teach
es me things. She helped me get a $2,(XX)
grant. Kelly knows how to be aggressive."
"I learned it from Alma," Naylor
laughed. "Alma is definitely a source of
wisdom in my life."
White has been homeless more than
once, and the $7(X) a month that she re
ceives in disability payments for arthritis
scarcely covers her rent and bills. But
White wants off the disability payments,
and hopes that Expressions in Ebony is the
key.
"My first plan is to move out of here,"
she said. Naylor and White would eventu
ally like to get a car, and White dreams of
traveling to Jamaica, a place she paints
often. Like many of her scenes, she has
never actually been there — she paints
from her imagination. Of a jazz bar scene,
she said, "That's what I think a nice place
should look like."
Her prints sell for $20, and she has sold
about 150 since the business began.
White will be at the Haas Center to
morrow from 3:30 p.m to 5 p.m. Her art
work. including prints, stationery, and
dolls, will be for sale, and refreshments will
be served.
