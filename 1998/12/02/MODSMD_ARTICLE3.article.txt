# Mailer outlines problems of spiritual ecology
## 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
Norman Mailer, two-time
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and
co-founder of the Village Voice, ar
gued Monday evening in Memorial
Auditorium that "bad spiritual
ecology," a result of capitalism and
technology, has created an increas
ingly manipulative and fragmented
environment.
He linked our spiritual deterio
ration to a culture defined by inter
ruption. Amidst suburban malls,
superhighways, fluorescent lights,
frozen food, television, and adver
tising, "it is more and more difficult
to feel intensity towards one pur
pose," stated Mailer.
He attacked television as a
source of evil. "Television is the
very spirit of interruption — there
is no narrative important enough
not to be interrupted by commer

cials," stated Mailer. He gave the
layout of magazines, disjointed he
cause of advertisements, and the
Internet as other examples of con
stant interruption.
"The Internet is an awful way to
waste your time. You get bits of in
formation that have been pre-di
gested, digested, and digested over
again — I find it very difficult to get
into a mood," said Mailer.
As well as blaming the frag
mented nature of society for"the
sickening of our substance," Mailer
also denounced what he called the
manipulative brainwashing of ad
vertising. He characterized adver
tising as a narcissistic and selfish art
that violates the spirit of capitalism.
Mailer said that as advertising has
shifted the emphasis of capitalism
from producing to selling, the qual
ity of products has declined.
"American advertisement is so
subtle and so skillful. It has corpo

ratized America. In a professional
football game everyone runs
around with that little Nike thing
on their shoulder ... we are raising
a nation of brainwashed children."
said Mailer.
Mailer argued that corporate
manipulation and "bad spiritual
ecology" have perverted society's
most fundamental institutions, rob
bing them of their authenticity.

Whereas architecture was once a
form of art, expressing function
through design, a hospital can no
longer be differentiated from a
school. Also, modern religious
faith has been reduced to a play
ground for right-wing political
leaders, according to Mailer.
