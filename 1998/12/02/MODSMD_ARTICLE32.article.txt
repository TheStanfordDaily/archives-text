## $25K Challenge begins in January 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
The Business Association of Stanford
Engineering Students will hold its fourth
annual $25.(KK) Entrepreneur's Challenge
starting next January.
Teams of Stanford students will formu
late business ideas and develop them into
new ventures, which will be judged by lead
ing entrepreneurs and venture eapitalists.
In addition to the feedback that each
team will receive, the group with the top
plan will receive a $25,(XX)cash prize.
"The Stanford Entrepreneur's Chal
lenge is an opportunity for students from all
disciplines to share their skills and formu
late business ideas," said industrial engi
neering graduate student Horng-Jye Oh,
director of the contest."lt will allow them to
experience firsthand the issues that accom
pany the development of an idea into a vi
able business."

Throughout winter quarter, the associa
tion will aid the teams by holding instruc
tional workshops which will cover topics
such as "Team Building" and "Basics of
Business Plan Writing."
"Many Stanford students are interested
in starting their own companies but don't
know where to begin," said sophomore
Stephen Oskoui, marketing director for the
Challenge. "Through a series of workshops,
the Entrepreneur's Challenge guides stu
dents through the process. It's one of the
best resources for entrepreneurs on cam
pus."
1997 winner Jim Smith, an electrical en
gineering graduate student, believes that
the competition was an excellent way to
learn what it takes to make a new venture
work.
"I think the most important ingredient
for Challenge success is the development of
an exciting idea that can solve big prob
lems," Smith said. "I would encourage par

ticipants to take advantage of the wealth of
resources available to them. It is an oppor
tunity to gain a deep understanding of a
particular problem or market and get top
notch feedback on your analysis of how to
attack it."
The 1999 Challenge will kick off on
Tuesday, Jan. 12 when Stanford graduate
and entrepreneur Christy Jones will speak
about her two start-up experiences.
In addition to being one of the founders
of Trilogy Software, which is currently
worth an estimated $100 million, the 29-
year-old Jones was featured on the Nov. 30,
1998 cover of Forbes magazine for her com
pany pcOrder.com, which provides soft
ware that helps streamline the distribution
processes of major computer manufactur
ers such as Compaq.
