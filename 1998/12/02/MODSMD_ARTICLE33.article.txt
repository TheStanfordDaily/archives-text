# Faculty Senate meeting to address computer support for Stanford users
## 
### Marni Left Senior staff writer 
At tomorrow's Faculty Senate meet
ing, the Committee on Academic Com
puting Information Systems will intro
duce a resolution aimed to call the Uni
versity's attention to the need for better
organization and possibly increased fund
ing for computer support services.
Biochemistry Prof. Douglas Brutlag,
the committee's chair, said people often
overlook the amount of support that com
puter users need.
"They say that supporting software
and networking require an amount of
money equal to that of the equipment,"
Brutlag said.
The committee, according to Brutlag,
has put together a resolution targeted at
Stanford's Chief Information Officer

Raman Khana and University Librarian
Michael Keller.
After the committee gives its report,
Keller and Khana, who sit on the commit
tee, will respond.
The resolution mainly addresses facul
ty concerns, Brutlag said, because stu
dents on the committee felt that their
needs were being met.
Brutlag said that students on the com
mittee praised the University's Residen
tial Computing program.
"Students in the dorms really have the
best support possible," Brutlag said.
"They have essentially 24-hour cradle-to
grave support available to them."
Brutlag said that he hopes the Univer
sity will be able to find a way to create a
similar program for faculty.
After a student on the committee
brought to the committee's attention a

lack of support for PC users, Brutlag said
the University responded quickly.
"There is now an Intel cluster in Meyer
[Library] as a direct result," Brutlag said.
Also at tomorrow's meeting, the Com
mittee on Faculty and Staff Benefits will
deliver its report on changes to the Tu
ition Grant program, which gives money
to University employees for their chil
dren's tuition.
Though members of the Committee
felt it inappropriate to discuss recommen
dations before the meeting, James
Franklin, associate vice provost of human
resources, said the changes will not effect
current University employees.
"Be aware that everyone either
presently employed by the University or
who will be employed before September
2, 1999 [will be] grandfathered in,"
Franklin said.
