# Cycling star LeMond to speak in Mem Aud
## 
### Murtaza Alimohamed 
Three-time Tour De France winner
Greg LeMond will speak tonight at Memo
rial Auditorium at 8:00 p.m. in a benefit
event for the Stanford cycling team.
Teaming up with LeMond will be leg
endary cycling commentator Phil Liggett,
who has been covering the sport for the last
20 years. He is known in cycling circles as
the "voice of professional cycling."
Organizers of the event said that
LeMond and Liggett plan to reminisce
about LeMond's meteoric rise in the world
of cycling â€” a story that will also feature
specially prepared video footage of
LeMond's success. The pair will also share
their perspectives on the current state of
world cycling and later field questions from
the large audience that is expected to at
tend.
According to Ric Hjertberg of Wheel
smith Bicycles, a co-sponsor of the event,
LeMond shares a special sentiment for the
Bay Area, where he used to train and race
during his early years.

"In fact," said Hjertberg, "LeMond was
a member of the Palo Alto Bike Club be
fore he went on to achieve great feats that
made him a household name."
Not only is LeMond the only American
to ever win cycling's Holy Grail, the Tour
De France, he overcame significant physi
cal barriers to capture the title a total of
three times.
After winning the race for the first time
in 1986, LeMond repeated the grueling feat
three years later. But to return to the race
and the winner's circle in 1989, LeMond
had to struggle through painful rehabilita
tion from a gunshot accident that embed
ded 60 shotgun pellets in his body. Forty
pellets could not be removed because of
their dangerous location.
He won the race again in 1990 and has
since retired from competitive cycling.
Although he has shelved cycling,
LeMond has a variety of activities to keep
him busy. In between owning a bicycle com
pany and participating in charity events,
LeMond has found a new passion in For
mula Ford auto racing.
