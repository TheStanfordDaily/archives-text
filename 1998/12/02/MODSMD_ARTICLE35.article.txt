## Anything but a dead week Men's soccer heads to quarterfinals 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
The No. 9 Stanford men's soccer
team (16-4-2) can't seem to squeak
enough minutes out of its season.
With a 3-1 double-overtime vic
tory against the University of San
Diego (12-9) on Saturday night at
New Maloney Field, the Cardinal
has sent its past four games into
extra periods.
And with the victory, Stanford
kept its season alive, advancing to
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
Men's Soccer Championship. The
Cardinal faces No. 2 seed Virginia
(16-3-3) Sunday in Charlottesville.
Stanford had advanced to the
round of 16 after defeating San Jose
State 3-2 in a triple-overtime thriller,
while San Diego upset No. 7 seed
Cal State-Fullerton 2-1 at Fullerton.
Not only did the club make more
history by advancing further in the
tournament than ever before, but it
matched the program's all-time high
number of wins at 16. The last 16-
win season came in 197X.
It was the combination of three
seniors, hoping to extend their Car
dinal careers at least one more
game, who connected for the game
winning goal.
The goal was scored in the 112 th
minute by senior forward Adam
Siegman, as he touched a cross from
senior captain A.J. Sauer just past
Torero freshman goalie Justin Neer
hof. The goal was Siegman's fourth
of the season, and the assist Sauer's

fifth.
The play began as senior mid
fielder Aaron Jones streaked up the
sideline and struck a cross on the
money to Sauer, who sent the ball
across the box to Siegman.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Saturday: No. 9 Stanford (16-4-2)
3, University of San Diego (12-9) 1
(2()T).

"It was a great cross by Aaron be
cause it just got behind the defense
and in front of the goal keeper,"
Sauer said. "There was a little hesi
tation [on the defender] and that al
lowed me to get in there. Adam fin
ished it brilliantly."
Siegman passed the credit to his
teammates as well.
"A.J. was able to lay it out on a
platter for me and I was in the right
place at the right time," Siegman
said.
Although these three seniors
connected for the game-winner, it
was the composure of the entire
squad that kept Stanford running
from the kickoff to the final whistle
120 minutes later.
And it has been the Cardinal's
ability to avoid frustration that has
kept it undefeated in its five over
time games this season. San Diego
finished it's season 0-3 in overtime
matches.
"Our team is based on discipline,
so 1 think we do well in those [over
time] situations," Siegman said. "As
teams get frantic, we can hold our

shape. We feel comfortable that
way."
The overtime matches required
teams to utilize their bench, and
Stanford's depth has proven advan
tageous in this situation all season.
While the Toreros used only one
substitute, Stanford freely rotated
four reserves to keep fresh legs com
ing at San Diego.
The Cardinal struck first in the
match with under a minute left in the
first half. Junior defender Andy
Hemmerich received a quick throw
in and bent a brilliant cross to the far
post, where Sauer had sneaked in
behind the defense. Sauer
telegraphed the pass from Hem
merich straight to his head and sent
it off the post and into the goal to put
the Cardinal on top.
"A.J. had a great finish with a
nice little adept header in the cor
ner," Stanford head coach Bobby
Clark said. "It was a great goal."
The goal was Sauer's team-lead
ing seventh, and the assist Hem
merich's second of the season.
The Cardinal looked impressive
at the beginning of the second half,
but the Toreros equalized with a
tremendous goal by senior forward
Devin Ebright. As San Diego's lead
ing scorer, Ebright blasted a shot
from the top right corner of the box
into the low left corner of the goal.
The shot was just past the fingertips
of diving redshirt sophomore goalie
Adam Zapala.
"They scored the goal and it took
the wind out of our sails a little bit,"

Sauer said.
But Stanford remained disci
plined, largely led by senior center
midfielders Simon Elliott and Shan
Gaw. Elliott and Gaw were im
mense in shutting down Torero star
senior midfielder Leighton O'Brien,
holding O'Brien to only one shot
and not allowing him to run the of
fense in his usual fashion. In combi
nation with Stanford's four defend
ers, the Cardinal was effective in qui
eting the San Diego offense.
"Our back four were tremendous
and our two center midfielders who
have carried us all year were unbe
lievable," Sauer said.
Freshman midfielder Derek Sha
nahan added an insurance goal with
under 30 second left in overtime for
his first goal of the season.
The team will have to pick its play
up to yet the next level for this Sun
day's match against Virginia.
Whereas the postseason experi
ences are new to all the Stanford
players, Virginia is a team seasoned
in playoff experience. Virginia finds
itself in the round of right after de
feating South Carolina 1-0 in Char
lottesville last Sunday.
The Cavaliers are a perennial
powerhouse of men's college soccer
and captured the national title four
years straight, from 1991-1994.
Against Stanford, Virginia is look
ing to advance to the Final Four for
the second consecutive year, and
make its eighth showing of the
