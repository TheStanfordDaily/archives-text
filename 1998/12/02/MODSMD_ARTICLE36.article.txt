## Keeping tabs on coach Bobby Clark and the boys

I hopped out of my friend's car and into the Stanford
Stadium parking lot at about 8:30 p.m., clutching my
backpack and a bag of f(x>d from In-N-Out. My ride had
picked me up in Los Angeles about two hours behind
schedule, and that translated into my missing the 7 p.m.
start of the men's soccer second-round playoff game by a
si/able amount of time.
1 walked into the stadium at New Maloney Field with
a sense of shock and pleasure. Despite the holiday week
end, I couldn't have found a seat if my life depended on
it. Not bad for citizens of a country that aren't generally
supposed to care about un-American football.
I've always loved soccer. I played in a recreation
league, my first endeavor into organized athletics. I lost
my shin guards one game into the season. I never played

again. (I've also never been able to walk quite right ever
since then.) But the love lives on.

There's also something to be said for athletes that cel
ebrate a goal by pulling their shirts over their heads and
running around in circles, but that needs no explanation.

The soccer bug has bitten me once again. It's usually
only a four-year cycle that hits its peak with each new
World Cup, but it's at full strength right now.
Stanford soccer isn't just charging into the quarterfi
nals, it's making history. With volleyball, basketball, and
water polo taking up a lot of the attention, head coach
Bobby Clark's boys have quietly been doing what previ
ous teams could only dream about.
I feel bad that I've been missing out. It couldn't hap
pen to a nicer bunch of guys.
I'm not saying that I know everyone on the team per
sonally or anything of the sort. In fact, I've only really
talked to one player face to face. But as far as dealing with
the media, the soccer team has been a class act.
I had never made it to any Stanford soccer match until

this year's men's game against lISF. Last weekend's dou
ble-overtime win against the USD was only my second
appearance. But I still feel like I know this team.
It's something you can discern about them just by
watching them play, and yet you know you can never
quite fully understand. It's that camaraderie that every
team has, but the fans are almost never privy to seeing.
It's the enthusiasm you hear in Clark's voice game in
and game out. The one thing that any sportswriter fears
is having to try and deal with a coach or a player after a
tough loss. That fear doesn't seem to be much of a factor
for our writer in dealing with them.
Clark comes off as what every player wants his coach
