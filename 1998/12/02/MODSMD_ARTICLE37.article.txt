### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
NEWPORT, Calif. — It began
the season as the top-ranked team in
the nation. And this weekend, the
Stanford men's water polo team will
try to secure the title it has had its eye
on all year.
• After being denied the opportuni
ty to attend the past two years, the
Cardinal squad is once again on its
way to the NCAA Final Four. No. 2
Stanford defeated No. 1 USC in the
semifinals of the Mountain Pacific

onship tournament last weekend be
fore going on to beat No. 6 Pepper
dine in the finals.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Sunday: No. 2 Stanford (20-6) 11
No. 6 Pepperdine 8.
■ Saturday: Stanford 7, No. 1 I JSC
(23-3) 6 (OT).
■ Friday: Stanford 10, No. 5 Califor
nia (13-11)5.

After the win over the top-ranked
team in the nation, Stanford had to
struggle to maintain its composure
for the championship game.
"We're elated to win," said junior
Andy Walburger. "There was a lot of
pressure going into the game. It's al
ways great to beat USC but we still

have to win tomorrow."
And they managed to do just that.
Although Stanford was down by
two in the first overtime period
against Pepperdine, the Cardinal bat
tled back to defeat the Waves 11 -8.
"They found a way to win and
that's the sign of a championship
team," said Stanford head coach

Dante Dettamanti.
But once again, Stanford has to
maintain its focus. Even though the
Cardinal captured the MPSF title,
the biggest game of the season is yet
to come. And Stanford probably
hasn't seen the last of the Trojans.
"It's ironic that in the last six years
or so we've played USC in very im

portant games," Dettamanti said.
> "The last two years, they knocked us
: out [of going to nationals]."
USC will receive the at-large
t berth for the national tournament.
