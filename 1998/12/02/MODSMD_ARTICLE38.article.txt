### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
NEWPORT, Calif. — It has
been described as the preeminent
tournament of the nation. The
competition included the top eight
teams in the nation. And this week
end, Stanford men's water polo
team brought home the title - and a
trip to the Final Four.
"The guys really rose to the oc
casion [this weekend]," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford (20-6) vs.
UC-San Diego (17-11) at Newport.
Calif., 8 p.m.

Then-No. 4 Stanford won the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championship by defeating
No. 5 California, No. 1 USC and
No. 6 Pepperdine. Both the semifi
nal and the championship games
went into overtime, but the Cardi
nal kicked it into high gear and
powered through to the first-place
finish.
"Everyone played with a lot of
heart," said junior Andy Walburg
er, who scored four goals this
weekend, including the game-win
ning goal against USC.
Stanford started things off with

a Friday morning first-round game
against Cal. Stanford jumped to a
3-0 lead in the first quarter and
held the lead for the entire game,
coming away with a 10-5 victory.
Junior Brian Heifferon led the
team in scoring with three points,
followed by senior David Hay. who
scored twice. Senior Arturo Rode
lo and juniors Sean Joy, Michael
Lipinski, Jonathan Skaalen and
Walburger each contributed one
point.
Although defeating its Bay
Area rival was a thrill for the Car
dinal, Stanford's biggest obstacle
was a semifinal match against the
top-ranked USC Trojans. And it
was a hard-fought battle to the end.
" This is the game they became
men." said assistant coach Ben
Quittner.
In a shaky first quarter for the
Cardinal, the Trojans took a 3-0
lead. But in the second period,
Stanford came back with a
vengeance. Walburger, Heifferon,
Skaalen and sophomore Pasi Dut
ton each posted goals for Stanford,
while senior goalie Chris Aguilera
and the Cardinal defense held the
Trojans scoreless. Stanford ended
the first half with a 4-3 lead.
Less than a minute into the third
quarter. IJSC got a man-up break
away and managed to tie things up.
But two goals from senior Layne
Beaubien gave the Cardinal a two
point lead. With just seven seconds
left, USC converted another man
up advantage to end the quarter at
6-5. The final goal of regulation play
came at 4:08 in the fourth period
when USC scored the tying goal.
Things heated up as Stanford
and USC began the first of two
three-minute overtime periods.
Aguilera. who notched an astound
ing 16 saves in the game, made sev
eral remarkable saves to keep Stan
ford in the game. At the end of the
second overtime period, the score
was still tied at six.
The pressure was really on as the
first three-minute sudden-death
overtime began. Stanford was on
six-on-five offense and the clock
had run down to 37 seconds when
Hay made a flawless pass from the
top to Walburger on the post, who
swept the ball into the upper corner
of the cage for the game-winning
goal.
"I couldn't believe it." Walburg
er said. "David and I have been
practicing that play at practice and
we could never pull it off."
"They've been trying that play
for four years and they never make
it," Dettamanti said. "I've been
yelling at [David] and telling him,
'Don't even try it.' "
But sometimes taking a risk on
offense can mean the difference be
tween winning and losing.
Although the Cardinal attack

was strong all around, what really
kept Stanford in the match was its
stellar defense, led by Aguilera.
"[Chris] has had a lot of good
games, but this is probably the best
game I ever saw him play," Ouittner
said.
After such an exhausting semifi
nal match, Stanford only had until
2:30 p.m. tin Sunday to rest up for
the championship game against
Pepperdine. The Waves had al
ready upset No. 2 UCLA in the first
round and No. 3 UC-Irvine in the
semifinals in overtime.
Stanford got out to a 2-0 lead
after the first period, but Pepper
dine was able to tie the game at
three by the half. Each team scored
twice in the third quarter and once
in the fourth. At the end of regula
tion plav. the score was tied. 6-6.
After the first overtime period,
Pepperdine was up K-7. But Stan
ford refused to give up and put away
four goals in the final period, while
holding the Waves scoreless.
Beaubien scored three of his seven
goals, including one two-pointer, in
overtime to lead the Cardinal to the
MPSF title. Rodelo scored twice,
while Walburger and Heiffcron
each scored once.
"Layne came through with seven
goals and really kept up in the game
the whole time," Dettamanti said.
"This is going down as a legendary
series of games in Stanford water
polo history. In 22 years, this ranks
near the top of my best memories."
Heiffcron was named Tourna
ment MVP. He was joined by
Beaubien on the All-Tournament
first team. Hay and Aguilera both
received All-Tournament second
team honors.
