NEWPORT, Calif. — It has
been described as the preeminent
tournament of the nation. The
competition included the top eight
teams in the nation. And this week
end, Stanford men's water polo
team brought home the title - and a
trip to the Final Four.
"The guys really rose to the oc
casion [this weekend]," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti.

MEN'S WATER POLO
■ Friday: No. 2 Stanford (20-6) vs.
UC-San Diego (17-11) at Newport.
Calif., 8 p.m.

Then-No. 4 Stanford won the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championship by defeating
No. 5 California, No. 1 USC and
No. 6 Pepperdine. Both the semifi
nal and the championship games
went into overtime, but the Cardi
nal kicked it into high gear and
powered through to the first-place
finish.
"Everyone played with a lot of
heart," said junior Andy Walburg
er, who scored four goals this
weekend, including the game-win
ning goal against USC.
Stanford started things off with

a Friday morning first-round game
against Cal. Stanford jumped to a
3-0 lead in the first quarter and
held the lead for the entire game,
coming away with a 10-5 victory.
Junior Brian Heifferon led the
team in scoring with three points,
followed by senior David Hay. who
scored twice. Senior Arturo Rode
lo and juniors Sean Joy, Michael
Lipinski, Jonathan Skaalen and
Walburger each contributed one
point.
Although defeating its Bay
Area rival was a thrill for the Car
dinal, Stanford's biggest obstacle
was a semifinal match against the
top-ranked USC Trojans. And it
was a hard-fought battle to the end.
" This is the game they became
men." said assistant coach Ben
Quittner.
In a shaky first quarter for the
Cardinal, the Trojans took a 3-0
lead. But in the second period,
Stanford came back with a
vengeance. Walburger, Heifferon,
Skaalen and sophomore Pasi Dut
ton each posted goals for Stanford,
while senior goalie Chris Aguilera
and the Cardinal defense held the
Trojans scoreless. Stanford ended
the first half with a 4-3 lead.
