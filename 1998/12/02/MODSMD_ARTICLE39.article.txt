# Card gets tough draw on road to 3rd-straight title
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
For the Stanford women's vol
leyball team, the road to a third
conseeutive national ehampionship
was mapped out on Sunday
evening with the unveiling of the
pairings for the 199K NCAA Tout
nament.
And for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Champion ( ardinal. that road
goes straight through the No. 1
team in the nation. Long Beach

State.
Stanford, which finished the sea
son with a 25-3 record. 15-1 in the
Pac-10. is the second seed in the
Mountain Region, and will have to
del 'at Long Beach State (30-0), the
top seed, on the tiers' home court
it it hopes to advance to a fifth con
secutive Final Four.
Prior to the selection show, the
Cardinal may have hoped for a bet
ter draw, considering its domi
nance of conference play and diffi
cult schedule.

The fact still remains, however,
that in the end. the only thing that
matters is the national champi
onship. In order to reach that level,
Stanford will have to play the best
teams at some point.
It just would have been nice to
put those toughest matches off a lit
tle longer.
Especially considering the stress
fracture in sophomore setter
Robyn Lewis's foot, which will
keep the Cardinal's floor general's
status questionable indefinitely,
and the final exams that directly
conflict with the potential matchup
with Long Beach State.
"As the coach. I had to be pre
pared. so I was heading into the
seeding expecting the worst." said
Stanford head coach Don Shaw. "I
don't know if |our draw] is the
worst or not. I can't really argue
with our seeding. 1 may disagree,
but that is why we play the match
es."
Stanford will open Tournament
play on Friday ;it Maples Pavilion
against Southeast Missouri State

(24-11).
Assuming a victory, the Cardi
nal would face the winner of East
ern Washington (24-5) and Notre
Dame (17-12) on Saturday.

WOMEN 'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: No. 5 Stanford (25-3) vs
Southeast Missouri State (24-11)
7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion. RADIO
KZSU (90.1 FM).

"Notre Dame has great talent
and is huge," Shaw said. "They
have had a couple of great recruit
ing classes, but have struggled for
some reason. Rut their record is de
ceiving. Eastern Washington is an
other good team. They lost to
Sacramento State," whom the Car
dinal defeated earlier in the season,
"a very well coached team, in the fi
nals of their conference tourna
ment."
Should Stanford continue its 26-
match home winning streak and
win the two matches at Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal would be off
to Long Beach, where Texas (24-4),

the third seed in the Mountain Re
gion, figures to be waiting in the
third round.
A win in the Sweet Sixteen
would, in all likelihood, set the
stage for a clash of the West Coast
volleyball titans. At stake in that
matchup would be a ticket to Madi
son, Wise., the sight of the national
finals and semifinals.
"We are not the favorites in our
region," Shaw said. "It will be very
tough to beat Long Beach at home,
but it is certainly not out of the
realm of possibility. 1 think if we
play well, we can beat any team in
the country."
The other top seeds, which will
each host a Regional, are Penn
State (30-0), Nebraska (28-1), and
Florida (31-2).
One reason that Stanford was
given the two seed in the same
bracket as the top-ranked team is
the decline of the Pac-10 this sea
son. Only three other teams (USC,
UCLA and Arizona) received bids
to the NCAA Tournament, and the
decreased power rating of the con

ference lessened the magnitude of
the Cardinal's conference title in
the eyes of the seeding committee.
On the whole, the field of 64
teams, increased from the 56-team
format a year ago, is as deep and
strong as any college volleyball has
seen.
"The at-large teams that were
admitted under the new format are
stronger than some of the automat
ic bids," Shaw said. "So in that way,
the 64-team field may strengthen
the bracket. Overall, the sport is
deeper than ever. There is not one
weak team in the top 16 seeds. For
example, UCLA is an extremely
dangerous team. I wouldn't want to
play them in the second or third
round. And Arizona is physically
capable of beating anybody.
"When the field gets down to 32,
there won't be any weak teams out
there. It should be a great champi
onship. The team that wins it will
have earned it by beating some
great teams."

Freshman Michelle Chambers and the No. 5 Cardinal will have a
tough road ahead of them in the NCAA Tourn iment.

The beauty of the NCAA Tour
nament is that anything can, and
does, happen year in and year out.
Twelve months ago, Stanford
was the third overall seed in the
postseason.
The Cardinal knocked off both
teams ranked higher. Long Beach
State and Penn State, en route to a
second-straight title.
Shaw cautions all those who
doubt that this year's team has a
chance to bring home a third
straight crown, citing something
that does not show up in its record,
on any stat sheet, or in any nation
al rankings.
"There is a lot to be said about
the heart of a champion," Shaw
said.
"We feel like until somebody
beats us in the tournament, that
championship belongs to us.
"Heading in, it looks like Penn
State and Long Beach may be the
teams to beat. But that is all on
paper; you still have to play the
matches."
And that is where this young
Stanford team, led by two-time All
American Kerri Walsh and Jen
nifer Detmer, a First-Team All
Pac-10 selection, will have a
chance to create a little magic of its
own, and prove the selection com
mittee wrong one more time.
