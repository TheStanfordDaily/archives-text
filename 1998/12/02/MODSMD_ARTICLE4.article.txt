# Students voice concerns about LGBCC issues
## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
In the wake of the abrupt resigna
tion of Gwendolyn Dean, the half
time director of the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, stu
dents are demanding that the posi
tion be made full-time.
"We will not rest until these de
mands are met," reads the last line of
an statement written by students and
distributed widely by e-mail.
There are no plans to present the
list of demands formally to the ad
ministration, according to Matthew
Lawrence, a doctoral student who
distributed the statement.
Other demands, described as "the
minimum we can accept from the ad
ministration," involve reducing the
amount of bureaucracy facing the di
rectorship position and the adminis
tration funding the position "as a sign
of respect to the LGBT and larger
Stanford community."
About 50 students attended a
closed meeting with Vice Provost of
Student Affairs James Montoya,
Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves, and Dean of Students Marc
Wais.
"At tonight's meeting, the com
munity made it very clear to us their
desire for a full-time director," said
Wais.
"We're looking to reallocate re
sources to provide more direct staff
support for the LGBCC," said Wais,
adding the administration has been
discussing the issue since Dean's de
parture.
Wais emphasized that any discus
sions on the issue would be "in con
text of having limited resources to
best serve Stanford students."
"They didn't promise us anything
substantial or concrete," said Emilie
Eagen, co-volunteer coordinator for
the center. She called the meeting
non-confrontational.
After holding the half-time posi
tion for less than four months. Dean
left Stanford to accept a similar, full
time position at Cornell University.
She was the first-ever director at the
center.
While some students have said
that Dean complained to them pri
vately about difficulty working with
administrators, Dean herself main
tains that she feels the administration

is committed to serving the gay and
lesbian community.
Just last year funding for the half
time directorship position was ap
proved. Prior to that, the LGBCC
was the only campus community cen
ter without a permanent employee.
But students had written a request
seeking a full-time director. A group
formed by the Dean of Students Of
fice had recommended in 1995 that a
"permanent, full-time staff person ..
. be appointed" to the LGBCC.
Montoya has said in the past that
there is not enough money for a full
time director.
"We have significantly raised the
amount of support for LGBT stu
dents in recent years," said Montoya,
noting that the center has recently
been made wheelchair-accessible
and a graduate intern position has
been added.
"I am pleased with the progress,
given the financial constraints we
face," said Montoya.
Some students have questioned
Montoya's commitment to seeking
funding for the center.
Scott Wallace, a 1980 Stanford
MBA, said that he spoke with Dean
Montoya last winter about donating
$10,000 a year for two years towards
funding a full-time directorship for
the center, but Montoya never
brought the issue up again.
In an e-mail reply to the students,
Montoya explained why he did not
immediately pursue Wallace's offer.
The e-mail explained that Dean
held an additional half-time job at the
University while working half-time
as LGBCC director. When the addi
tional half-time position ended,
Montoya said, he planned to use
Wallace's donation to supplement
Dean's salary.
"The thought was to use Mr. Wal
lace's offer to supplement Ms.
Dean's work through spring quar
ter," Montoya said.
Zach Allen, a master's student in
Latin American Studies, said that a
group of students has been meeting
to discuss the directorship position
and about 20 or 30 are "very deter
mined" to get a full-time director.
"We'll work within University
channels," he said. "If that doesn't
work ... protests are possible in the
