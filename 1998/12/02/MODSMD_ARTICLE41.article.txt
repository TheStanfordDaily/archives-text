NEW YORK — Dick Vitale
might have been calling the game for
ESPN, hut he certainly wasn't calling
No. 5 Stanford's shooting perfor
mance, "Awesome, baby!"
The Cardinal (4-1) hit a poor 28.6
percent of its shots from the field, get
ting upset by North Carolina (6-0) 57-
49, in the finals of the Chase National
Invitational Tournament on Friday.
"Our shot selection was very
poor," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "We were hav
ing a difficult time inside [and] we
weren't able to beat them off the
dribble. We have to learn from this.
What we are doing right now is not
g(K)d enough."

MEN S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: No. 3 North Carolina (6-0)
57, No. 5 Stanford (4-1)49.
■ Wednesday: Stanford 55, No. 23
St. John's 53.

And while the now-No. 3 North
Carolina Tar Heels weren't having
the greatest game of their season ei
ther, North Carolina had enough
tricks up its sleeves to pull off the
upset.
" This was a tremendous thing to
win this tournament for us," said
North Carolina head coach Bill
Guthridge. "It was something 1
couldn't imagine we would do."
Guthridge probably also didn't
imagine he had a hometown hero
who would step up for the New York
crowd.
A Brooklyn native, junior point
guard Ed Cota led both teams in
points and rebounds, grabbing 11
boards and scoring 17 points, in addi
tion to his five assists for the lar
Heels/* v
"The Coaches told us that every
body had to crash the boards," said
(lie 6-foot-1 tournament MVP. "It
was great to win a championship in
front of my friends. It was like a
dream come true.
Cota was assisted by two big men,
senior Ademola Okulaja and sopho
more Brendan HaywotKl, in helping
take away the usual Stanford size ad
vantage. Okulaja had 14 points while
Haywood had a career-high six
blocks.
"It was a very physical game," said
Stanford forward Mark Madsen.
"Haywcx>d disrupted a lot of shots in

side. We had some breakdowns."
While Madsen grabbed 10 re
bounds for the Cardinal, and was
aided by sophomore Jarron Collins'
10 points, Stanford could not convert
many of its drives into points.
"It's frustrating," said senior point
guard Arthur Lee, who had six points
— all of which came in the final 31
seconds. "We had open shots, we just
missed them. We just didn't do what
we needed to do."
A preseason rule this year chang
ing the 35-second shot clock to 45 sec
onds didn't help the Cardinal either.
With North Carolina slowing up the
game at times, Stanford was impa
tient with its shot selection.
"I think we need to distribute the
ball more," Madsen said. "I think we
need to make the extra pass. We have
to be patient and unselfish."
"It eats away at me because I con
sider myself a good shooter," added
senior Kris Weems. "We can sh(X)t
better."
The Tar Heels jumped to a quick
10-2 lead and never looked back, re
linquishing the lead only once, mo
mentarily, midway through the first
half.
Stanford, however, was certainly
never out of the game. With two min
utes remaining in the game, redshirt
freshman Jason Collins put in the re
bound off a missed Weems' three
point shot, to put the Cardinal within
three.
Forced to foul North Carolina,
however, Stanford could not regain
control of the game, despite valiant
attempts by Lee and junior Ryan
Mendez, firing three-point attempts
left and right.
"We wanted this one really bad,"
Madsen said.
NIT SEMIFINALS
Getting to the NIT finals was not
so easy as well.
The Cardinal struggled with the
No. 23 St. John's Red Storm in front
of an obviously biased New York
crowd at the Garden. Falling behind
early for the first time all season,
Stanford found itself trailing by 10
points with just six minutes remaining
in the game and barely pulled off the
victory, 55-53.
"It looked pretty bleak but we
have a lot of veteran guys on this
team," Madsen said, after finishing
with a team-high 15 points in addition
to his six rebounds. "In the huddle,
you Ux)k around and see guys like
Pete Sauer and Arthur Lee. ITiey've
made big plays before."

And they would need to again.
With Saint John's Ron Artest.
who finished with 15 points, and Ty
rone Grant using their quickness to
constantly keep control of the lead,
Stanford needed several key plays to
put the Cardinal back in it.
After cutting the Red Storm's
lead to four, Weems intercepted a
Red Storm pass and found Sauer be
hind the three-point line. Sauer'sonly
three of the night made the score 51 -
50 St. John's.
"When Sauer hit that three-point
er," Madsen said, "at that moment
we all lcH)ked around and kx)ked into
each other's eyes and felt like we
could pull it off."
A traveling violation on St. John's
that followed enabled Lee to pene
trate to the hoop and give Stanford its
first lead of the second half, with
under two minutes to play.
While a Weems free throw gave
the Cardinal the 53-51 lead, however,
Artest would not give up. With just 15
seconds remaining, he drove up the
middle of the key, hit the game-tying
shot and was fouled by Stanford cen
ter Tim Young.
After missing the free throw,
Artest made a fatal error—he fouled
Lee.
In a collision that gave Stanford
quite the scare, Artest bumped hard

into Lee, hitting him in the hip, and
yet Stanford's point guard still man
aged to nail two free throws and give
the Cardinal the 55-53 victory.
"Arthur Lee couldn't even walk
off the court." Madsen said. "I le got
hit pretty hard. He somehow man
aged to walk down to the other end of
the court and hit those two free
throws. That's great heart."
"I was just trying to focus on free
throws then," said Lee, who was suf
fering from a hip pointer. "Before
and after [the free throws], it was
killing."
Lee finished the game with 10
points after playing in all but two min
utes of the game and Youngadded 10
points in addition to a game-high 11
rebounds.
"I think experience was definitely
a factor," Montgomery said. We
didn't panic. We just needed to make
a play."
BASKETBALL NOTES:
While the Cardinal was forced to
settle for a second-place trophy from
the NIT Tournament, Madsen did
make the All-Tournament team...
Stanford is 0-8 against North Caroli
na. .. The new Associated Press
rankings have Connecticut (4-0) at
No.l, followed by Maryland (7-0),
North Carolina (6-0), Duke (5-1) and

ther, North Carolina had enough
tricks up its sleeves to pull off the
upset.
" This was a tremendous thing to
win this tournament for us," said
North Carolina head coach Bill
Guthridge. "It was something 1
couldn't imagine we would do."
Guthridge probably also didn't
imagine he had a hometown hero
who would step up for the New York
crowd.
A Brooklyn native, junior point
guard Ed Cota led both teams in
points and rebounds, grabbing 11
boards and scoring 17 points, in addi
tion to his five assists for the lar
Heels/* v
"The Coaches told us that every
body had to crash the boards," said
(lie 6-foot-1 tournament MVP. "It
was great to win a championship in
front of my friends. It was like a
dream come true.
Cota was assisted by two big men,
senior Ademola Okulaja and sopho
more Brendan HaywotKl, in helping
take away the usual Stanford size ad
vantage. Okulaja had 14 points while
Haywood had a career-high six
blocks.
"It was a very physical game," said
Stanford forward Mark Madsen.
"Haywcx>d disrupted a lot of shots in

side. We had some breakdowns."
While Madsen grabbed 10 re
bounds for the Cardinal, and was
aided by sophomore Jarron Collins'
10 points, Stanford could not convert
many of its drives into points.
"It's frustrating," said senior point
guard Arthur Lee, who had six points
— all of which came in the final 31
seconds. "We had open shots, we just
missed them. We just didn't do what
we needed to do."
A preseason rule this year chang
ing the 35-second shot clock to 45 sec
onds didn't help the Cardinal either.
With North Carolina slowing up the
game at times, Stanford was impa
tient with its shot selection.
"I think we need to distribute the
ball more," Madsen said. "I think we
need to make the extra pass. We have
to be patient and unselfish."
"It eats away at me because I con
sider myself a good shooter," added
senior Kris Weems. "We can sh(X)t
better."
The Tar Heels jumped to a quick
10-2 lead and never looked back, re
linquishing the lead only once, mo
mentarily, midway through the first
half.
Stanford, however, was certainly
never out of the game. With two min
utes remaining in the game, redshirt
freshman Jason Collins put in the re
bound off a missed Weems' three
point shot, to put the Cardinal within
three.
Forced to foul North Carolina,
however, Stanford could not regain
control of the game, despite valiant
attempts by Lee and junior Ryan
Mendez, firing three-point attempts
left and right.
"We wanted this one really bad,"
Madsen said.
NIT SEMIFINALS
Getting to the NIT finals was not
so easy as well.
The Cardinal struggled with the
No. 23 St. John's Red Storm in front
of an obviously biased New York
crowd at the Garden. Falling behind
early for the first time all season,
Stanford found itself trailing by 10
points with just six minutes remaining
in the game and barely pulled off the
victory, 55-53.
"It looked pretty bleak but we
have a lot of veteran guys on this
team," Madsen said, after finishing
with a team-high 15 points in addition
to his six rebounds. "In the huddle,
you Ux)k around and see guys like
Pete Sauer and Arthur Lee. ITiey've
made big plays before."

And they would need to again.
With Saint John's Ron Artest.
who finished with 15 points, and Ty
rone Grant using their quickness to
constantly keep control of the lead,
Stanford needed several key plays to
put the Cardinal back in it.
After cutting the Red Storm's
lead to four, Weems intercepted a
Red Storm pass and found Sauer be
hind the three-point line. Sauer'sonly
three of the night made the score 51 -
50 St. John's.
"When Sauer hit that three-point
er," Madsen said, "at that moment
we all lcH)ked around and kx)ked into
each other's eyes and felt like we
could pull it off."
A traveling violation on St. John's
that followed enabled Lee to pene
trate to the hoop and give Stanford its
first lead of the second half, with
under two minutes to play.
While a Weems free throw gave
the Cardinal the 53-51 lead, however,
Artest would not give up. With just 15
seconds remaining, he drove up the
middle of the key, hit the game-tying
shot and was fouled by Stanford cen
ter Tim Young.
After missing the free throw,
Artest made a fatal error—he fouled
Lee.
In a collision that gave Stanford
quite the scare, Artest bumped hard

into Lee, hitting him in the hip, and
yet Stanford's point guard still man
aged to nail two free throws and give
the Cardinal the 55-53 victory.
"Arthur Lee couldn't even walk
off the court." Madsen said. "I le got
hit pretty hard. He somehow man
aged to walk down to the other end of
the court and hit those two free
throws. That's great heart."
"I was just trying to focus on free
throws then," said Lee, who was suf
fering from a hip pointer. "Before
and after [the free throws], it was
killing."
Lee finished the game with 10
points after playing in all but two min
utes of the game and Youngadded 10
points in addition to a game-high 11
rebounds.
"I think experience was definitely
a factor," Montgomery said. We
didn't panic. We just needed to make
a play."
