# 'Point' is clear for No. 5 Stanford
## 
### Will Hemming Staff writer 
NEW YORK — New York City is the
center of the American sports world.
Time and again, it has been said that if
you can make it there, you can make it any
where.
Under the bright lights of Madison
Square Garden, the contenders have been
separated from the pretenders. Big-time
players always make big-time plays in New
York. It is a rite of passage.
The Stanford men's basketball team got
its first taste of the Big Apple last weekend
at the Chase Preseason NIT.
On the nation s premier sports stage, the
Cardinal did anything but rise to the occa
sion. Before a national television audience,
eager to validate all the preseason hype sur
rounding Stanford, the Cardinal shot an
abysmal 28 percent from the flwr in the
championship game and was upset by
North Carolina
In that game, and in Stanford's thrilling
last-minute victory against St. John's, the
Cardinal gave rise to a number of question
marks.
Amidst all the doubt, however, one thing
was made crystal clear.
Although a definite strength of the Stan
ford team is its depth and total dedication to
the team concept, one player will be at the
heart of its success: senior point guard
Arthur Lee.
In the closing seconds of Wednesday's
game against St. John's, Lee capped a dra
matic comeback by draining the game-win

ning free throws.
Why were those two free throws so im
pressive by Lee, who broke the NCAA
Tournament record a season ago by nailing
35 in a row?
Because 11 seconds later, after he sprint
ed back on defense for the Red Storm's final
possession, Lee had to be helped off the
court by two teammates.
The pain in his right leg from a hip point
er, suffered on the foul by Ron Artest that
sent him to the line for the winning shots,
was strong enough to keep him from walk
ing.
But not to keep him from making a pair
of free throws when everything was on the
line.
Perhaps the greatest indicator of Lee's
importance, however, came on Friday in the
loss to IJNC. The Cardinal's floor leader
was held scoreless until very late in the sec
ond half, blanketed by Carolina point guard
Ed Cota.
And although the Stanford offense was
sparked by a few three-pointers from Ryan
Mendez and solid post play from the Collins
twins, the absence of Lee was painfully
clear, far beyond the scorebwk.
For some reason, the senior point guard
does things to spark the Cardinal offense
like no one else can. Whether it be a clutch
three-pointer on the fast break or swift pen
etration into the paint followed by a sweet
dish that sets up a made-to-order dunk, Lee
always seems to be an integral part of every
Stanford run.
When looking back to last year's run in
the NCAA Tournament, one clearly re

members the many times Lee provided in
stant offense for the Cardinal in crunch
time. Without the many long-range bombs
that Lee continued to knock down, Stan
ford would have not been in San Antonio in
late March.
And it probably would not have been
ranked as highly as second in the preseason
polls. After all, they are primarily based on
the prior year's NCAA Tournament.
It is no coincidence that Lee appeared on
the cover of Sports Illustrated last month.
For, amidst all the depth and talent on
this year's Stanford team, Lee definitely
sticks out as the main man, the go-to guy.
Make no mistake, Lee is the star of this
team.
He is humble and quick to deflect credit
towards his teammates (who are certainly
deserving), but he is a star no less.
While many coaches and publications
point to the Stanford frontcourt as its
strength, Lee provides the ability to create
his own shot.
Whereas the players under the basket
need someone to feed them the ball, Lee
uses his quickness and agility to find open
shots.
And more often than not, he makes
them.
There is no question that over the course
of the season, it will take a total team effort
for this Stanford team to get to the highest
level.
There is also little doubt that if there is
one player on the team that can single
handedly propel them over the top, it is
Lee.
