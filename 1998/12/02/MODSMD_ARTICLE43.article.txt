## N.Y. Night Beat

NEW YORK â€” I felt like
something out of an old-time radio
program.
1 think it was called "Night
Beat." The story of a reporter
roaming the city, just looking for
trouble and looking to tell its story.
He would find his weekly column
by talking to the people on the
streets of the city, looking for a
form of humanity and a reminder
of the good in the big city.

And he would end each episode
with the cry, "Copyboy!" having
his story taken off to the presses.
Here I was, in the middle of
New York's Times Square, with
two hours to kill before Stanford
would meet North Carolina in the
NIT Finals at Madison Square
Garden. A California boy in the big
city. And 1 was looking for my
story.
The people hiding beneath dark
overcoats and long scarves put
their heads down and pressed on
ward, plowing through the streets
like they only had five minutes to
get from 72nd to 31st Street.
I took my time.
The horns honked and the
checkered-yellow cabs drove wild
ly-
-1 strolled.
This city is amazing. But the
flashing lights, the loud music, it all
makes you forget about the indi
vidual. The true New Yorker.
I needed to find him.
I started off at Madison Square
Garden. Sitting on the steps lead
ing up to the Garden, I met my first
native.
"Hey Mista," the security guard
yelled in my direction.
I looked around. I had only
been there for a few minutes
"Me?"
"Stop satin'!"
"Excuse me?" I said.
"Ya can't sit here."
I laughed. This had to be some
sort of joke.

"It's policy. No sittin' allowed."
I stood up. He refused to explain
to me why one was not allowed to
sit on the steps leading up to the
Garden, hut seeing as he was about
twice my size, I decided maybe it
was not my place to argue. He
wasn't about to give me my story.
So again, I strolled. I past the
Empire State Building, lit up in
shades of red, white and blue for
the week's national holiday. I
passed a news ticker that flashed
across Times' Square, announcing,
"Yelstin's health a problem...
Stanford to play North Carolina at
the Garden tonight." I past a guy
selling gold chains on the sidewalk.
"I gotta get rid of 'em," he
shouted. "I'm not da fella that stole
'em, but dey gotta go and dey gotta
go fast."
The police officer standing next
to me paid no attention to the
man's rambling.
1 kept on walking
It was almost gametime and my
thoughts began to drift to the big
match with North Carolina. Would
the Cardinal prove worthy of all
the preseason praise and all the
hype New York's own Sports Illus
trated and New York Times built.
I went to the hotdog vendor.
"One please," I said.
He made no eye contact. I didn't
have much time. I needed to get my
story.
"You a basketball fan?" I asked.
"Maybe. What's it ta you?" he
said.
"Oh, I just wanted to know if
you're going to tonight's garr.c at
the Garden," I replied.
"Oh I can't," he said, suddenly
showing a human side. "But I'll be
listening on this radio. I listen to all
the games on this here radio. I was
pullin' for St. John's the other
night."
The man was a hard worker. He
couldn't leave his vending cart but
he wouldn't let that stand in his way
of following basketball. He was
New York. He was a reminder of
why people should play basketball,
of the love of the game.
He was my story.
"Copyboy!"

Sports editor Brian Eule had a
great Thanksgiving in the Big
Apple and misses the constant
honking of horns in the city's
streets.
