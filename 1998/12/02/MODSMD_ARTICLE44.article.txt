# Basketball splits games against ranked opponents
## 
### Molly Brizgys Editorial staff 
I he Stanford women's basketball
team (2-5) is a lot like Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde — it plays well one game
but struggles the next. This past
weekend was no exception.
On Friday, the Cardinal was de
feated 75-69, by No. 15 Texas lech
hut rallied and was able to beat 23rd

ranked Wisconsin 78-66 on Sunday.
"I'm really excited about the im
provement," said Stanford head
coach I'ara VanDerveer after Sun
day's win. ""It's kind of strange
though, you see one game like Texas
lech and then you come out today
and it's like two totally different
teams. I like this team ;t lot better."
When Stanford is on, it's great,
proving it emphatically with a big win

over then top-ranked Purdue two
weeks ago and then with Sunday's
win against the Badgers.
But Stanford can also play very
badly, ns it proved against Illinois two
weeks ago when it shot only 28 per
eent from the field and then against
Texas Tech when it shot only IK per
cent during the first half.
1 he ( ardinal has talent and the
players are athletic. As a unit, it is
very young and inexperienced. At
this point in the season, the only thing
the team is lacking is consistency.
"When you have a young team the
hardest thing is to sustain the level of
intensity," VanDerveer said.
Perhaps the young Cardinal just
needs time to settle into the season to
get a handle on its game, everv game.

WOMEN S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (2-5) at Santa
Clara (2-0). 7 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford 78. No. 23 Wis
consin 66.
■ Fast Friday: No. 1 5 Texas Tech 75,
Stanford 69.

"We have tremendous talent on
this team," said junior point guard
Milena Flores. "We have little spurts
of it now and then but it's when we're
able to sustain it that we're able to
win. A lot of our mistakes are mis
takes of inexperience."
Stanford looked good on Sunday
afternoon ;is Flores, back from her
slump, led the Cardinal with 17
points. 12 assists and was 4-5 from
outside the three point line.
Stanford grabbed the lead three
minutes into the game and led for the
rest of the half. Wisconsin caught
Stanford sleeping after halftinie,
catching up. but never led by more
than two points. After six lead
changes, Stanford composed itself
and with seven minutes left, ran away
with the game.
Stanford shot 41 percent from the
field and outrebounded the Badgers

48-46. VanDerveer adjusted the
team's defensive style and the Cardi
nal pressed for the first part of the
game before shifting into a /.one.
The system worked well, especial
ly when Stanford's twin towers, fresh
man Corey Enghusen and sopho
more Carolyn Moos, were on the
floor together.
Enghusen stands 6-foot-7 and
Moos stands 6-6. Together, they were
quite a force under the basket and
combined for 25 points and 15 re
bounds. Enghusen saw action for the
first time in her career against Texas
Tech after recovering from a knee in
jury. On Sunday, Enghusen had 10
points and five rebounds.
The freshmen continued to per
form well for the young Stanford
team. VanDerveer liberally rotated
freshmen Lauren St. Clair, Lindsey
Yamasaki, Bethany Donaphin and
now Enghusen. Over the weekend, at
any given point in the game, it was
likely that two players on the court
were freshmen.
"We're a whole different team
with Corey and Bethany healthy,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm really proud
of Corey. You just saw the tip of the
iceberg of what she's capable of,"
Yamasaki was cold on Sunday,
going 0-4 from three-point range and
finishing with only six points. Howev
er, her performance was not indica
tive of her capabilities. Yamasaki is
the team's second leading scorer and
averages 14.2 points per game.
Sophomore Sarah Dimson also
had a great game, hustling all over the
court and added a career-high 13
points and three rebounds to the Car
dinal campaign.
Stanford wasn't as successful on
Friday night. The Cardinal was down
by as many as 21 points in the first
half, after shooting a dismal 18.8 per
cent from the field, with no three
pointers.
Who knows what VanDerveer
told her team at halftime, but whatev
er she said made quite an impression.
The team came out much more fo

cused in the second half and shot 49
percent form the field and came with
in five points of the Lady Raiders in
the final minute. However, time
wasn't on the Cardinal's side.

Texas Tech's win was a balanced
effort with six players scoring in dou
ble figures. Flores led Stanford with a
career-high 20 points and Yamasaki
also added a career-high 19 points.
