# Flores back on track
## 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
Junior point guard Milena Flores
was supposed to be the confident,
experienced and calm leader of a
young Cardinal team this year.
But in the first few games, the
shots Flores was hitting last year,
when she shot over 49 percent from
the floor, were not falling. Her
shooting woes affected her whole
game and she was not the floor
leader that coach Tara VanDerveer
expected her to be.
So, although Flores started all
but one game last season, Van-
Derveer left her on the bench at the
start of the last three games. This
weekend, Flores began responding.
In a losing effort against Texas
Tech Friday, Flores hit for 20 points.
Much of that came from the free
throw line, however, as Flores only
went 5 for 12 from the floor.
Sunday's victory against Wiscon
sin was Flores's first truly resurgent
performance. She scored 17 points,
dished out 12 assists with only two
turnovers and even pulled down a
couple of rebounds. She was espe
cially impressive in the second half.
Playing all 20 minutes, Flores had 11
points, including going 3 for 3 from
three-point range, and eight assists.
"[ln the first few games], she
started out not playing her game and
putting a lot of pressure on herself,"
VanDerveer said. But, "we've got
our guard back now."
Flores said it has taken her a lot
longer time than she thought it
would for her to get her game back.
"I'm finally getting real comfort
able out there," she said. "The

whole season I was getting the same
shots, I just wasn't finishing. I put a
little more extra time into shooting
before practice and games and they
started falling for me."
This is exactly what VanDerveer
hoped would happen when she
began leaving Flores on the bench at
the start of the Nov. 22 Purdue
game. Flores had been feeling the
pressure of her position in the first
two games of the season and had
shot only 1 for 23. VanDerveer
hoped to slow Flores down, and it
appears it may have worked.
"It has helped her not starting
and watching and seeing what we
needed done," VanDerveer said.
While Flores was not enthusiastic
about her time on the bench, she was
diplomatic about the future.
"I don't think [starting or not]
makes a difference," she said. "I'm
ready to go at any time."
Regardless of whether she starts
or not, everyone acknowledges that
an effective Flores is crucial to the
Cardinal's success.
"When you have a young team,
the hardest thing to do is to sustain
the intensity all game," VanDerveer
said. "And that's where you need
Milena because she's in good shape
and she can play hard for 40 minutes
if you need her to."
Wisconsin coach Jane Albright-
Dieterle was especially effusive in
her praise after seeing Flores take
apart the Badger defense in the sec
ond half.
"I think she's as good a player as
any we've seen at making the play
ers around her produce," Albright-
Dieterle said. "She's what makes
that team go."
