## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
The Stanford Wrestlers finished a
tough week of dual meets to begin the
season with a 2-1 record. The Cardi
nal was able to defeat San Francisco
State 27-12 on Nov. 24 and Portland
State 27-12 last Saturday. However,
the Cardinal run was halted by Pacif
ic 10 Conference title contender ()re
gon State, losing 34-8 on Sunday
night.
Head coach Chris Horpel was
pleased with the effort put forth by
the team, but still believes there is
room for improvement.
"Although we wrestled tough. I do
not believe we wrestled up to our full
potential," Horpel said. "1 believe we
were capable of shutting out both San
Francisco State and Portland State
and going even with Oregon State.
We made some costly mistakes in all

three duals, hut they are mistakes we
ean correct."
At 125 lbs., Cardinal junior Rudy
Ruiz had a tough time in the three
duals, finishing 1-2, with his lone win
coming by forfeit against Portland
State. Ruiz lost a close match to SFS
sophomore Max Schurkamp, 6-4.
Ruiz was then outmatched by Ore
gon State's Nathan Navarro, who
handed Ruiz a 14-2 defeat.

â–  Sunday: Oregon State 34, Stanford
(2-1)8.

Junior captain Zach Zimmerer
fared better for Stanford at 133 lbs.
1 le finished the three duals with a 2-1
record. Zimmerer looked strong in
his first two dual matches winning by
forfeit against SFS's Kelly Martinez
and pinning Portland State's Aquila
Knopf in a stunning 14 seconds. How

ever, Zimmerer's perfect season
ended with a tough loss to Oregon
State's Ben Richards, 6-5, dropping
his record to 6-1 on the year.
Freshman Kenji Arai had two dif
ficult matches to start his college ca
reer at 141 lbs. Arai lost his collegiate
wrestling debut to SFS sophomore
Armando Orozco, 6-3, and then lost
again to Portland State's Casey Hunt,
10-6.
Arai then rallied back to defeat
Oregon State's Paul Barron, 9-8, to
score his first points for the Cardinal.
Horpel was pleased by the quality
of wrestling and how his team was put
to the test in such a tough week.
"1 thought we wrestled with a lot
of heart in all three of our dual meets
last week. Our conditioning was put
to a g(xxl test and we l(X)ked sharp for
this early in the season."
At 149 lbs., junior Frank Ruiz
wrestled SFS freshman Doug Har

wcxxl, losing a heartbreaker, 10-8 in
sudden-death overtime. Unfortu
nately, he aggravated a hip injury suf

the year, so sophomore Stu White
filled in against Portland State and
Oregon State. White suffered two
losses; the first 2-0 against Portland
State's Brad Ciallettes and the second
on a pin by Oregon State's Andy Frey
in 5:24.
Senior captain Beau Weiner (157
lbs.) went 1-2 in the three duals, post
ing a technical fall over Portland's
Ron Holyook in 3:46. A technical fall
occurs when a wrestler is ahead of his
opponent by 15 or more points, and
the match is immediately stopped.
Junior Warren McPherson had
the best showing for the Cardinal,
going 3-0 in the duals at 165 lbs. He
began by pounding SFS's Aaron
Stanton 16-4, and went on to defeat

out of three. He wrestled well against

SFS's Shane Clark, posting a techni
cal fall in 4:47 and went on to defeat
Portland State's R.J. Gillespie, 8-2.
