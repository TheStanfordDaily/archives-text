TABLE TENNIS
The Stanford table tennis squad will
spend the first portion of its winter break at
the National Championships which will be
held in Las Vegas, Nov., Dec. 16 - 20. This
competition is an open tournament for any
players rather than a collegiate-only compe
tition.
"This is one of the two biggest American
tournaments of the year," said captain Eric
Friedman. "We're all quite excited."
Stanford will be sending three representa
tives from the team to the championships.
Returning for his ninth trip to the National
Championships is veteran player Vinect
Agarwal. Agarwal advanced to the semifi
nals in his division in the I J.S. Open this past
summer and is expected to perform extreme
ly well. He is also a very accomplished dou
bles player, having finished second in both
the U.S. Open and U.S. Nationals doubles
events in 1997.

"Vineet. 'The Wall,' Agarwal has been to
the championships many times and tradition
ally does very well at big tournaments,"
Friedman said.
The other two Stanford players making
the trip to Nevada will be going to the first
time. Greg Smith, a Stanford sophomore,
should perform well given his past tourna
ment play in his native South Africa. Smith
has had a tremendous amount of experience
for his age in table tennis. He has represent
ed South Africa twice at the World Maccabi
ah Games in Israel, helping his country win
the bronze medal.

CLUB SPORTS

Friedman will round out the trio of Stan
ford players in the tournament. While still a
high school student, Friedman ranked
among the top-16 players in the Texas Tri-
State Collegiate Regional Championships
both during his junior and senior years.
Now in his senior year at Stanford. Fried
man claims the distinction of being the oldest

player on the Stanford team.
During last spring's Collegiate Champi
onships, the Stanford team provided a shock
to a sport which traditionally has been domi
nated by East Coast and Ivy League schools.
In the first ever appearance by a West Coast
school in the championships, Stanford took
everyone by surprise with a strong fifth-place
finish. The first-place finisher in the competi
tion was Michigan, followed by Maryland.
lona and Johns Hopkins, with the Cardinal
taking fifth.
In order to determine who would qualify
for the National Tournament this weekend,
the Stanford team conducted intersquad
competition. Seven people competed for the
four spots that were open. Due to scheduling
conflicts, the four-person squad has dropped
down to three for the upcoming weekend.
At the national competition only individ
ual scores will be tallied, as opposed to the
collegiate format where team rankings are
kept. However, the Stanford players will
compete in the doubles 1 bracket together.
"So we'll all be playing lots of singles and

a little doubles. [But], we definitely feel like
we're going as a team," Friedman said.
Even though it is a new club team, the
table tennis squad has some of the best young
players in the country and is able to make use
of its affiliation with the Palo Alto table ten
nis club, which is considered one of the top
clubs in the country.
The Cardinal will hold an open competi
tion for the entire Stanford campus some
time during winter quarter. As a move for
campus awareness and recruiting, the team
will entice all campus and dorm champions
with a monetary reward for anyone who is
able to beat 'The Wall,' Agarwall, the team's
top player.
RUGBY
The Stanford rugby team was put to the
hardest test of the quarter by competing
against some of its own. In the traditional
alumni game, the current Stanford team met
some of the best players of Stanford rugby's
past.
Stanford rugby has a long tradition of

great players including former NFL stars and
Olympic gold medalists. The culmination of
each fall season is the return of those players
that are able to come back to the Farm and
give the undergraduates a great game.
The rugby alumni game is traditionally
played the same weekend as football's Big
Game. This allows the alumni to return and
enjoy Stanford and its traditions, as well as
being late enough in the fall training schedule
to serve as a good test of the Cardinal's
preparation for the upcoming league season
beginning in winter quarter.
Coach Franck Boivert was happy with the
pace and hard nature of this year's game.
Several of the best Stanford ruggers from re
cent years were in attendance. This fact, in
combination with six of the Stanford team's
starters not being able to play due to injuries,
resulted in the alumni team outscoring the
Cardinal by 17 points.
"I am very grateful to the alumni who
come back in such numbers, and their loyal
ty to Stanford Rugby is what makes us so
strong," Boivert said.
