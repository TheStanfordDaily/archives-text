# Morrison lives up to the hype
## Freshman and top recruit makes impact on strong Card defense 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
It takes a special player to make
an instant impact on an athletic pro
gram.
And it takes a special young man
to live up to the expectations of
being touted as the top recruit in the
country.
Freshman Lee Morrison has es
tablished himself as this sort of indi
vidual for the Stanford men's soccer
team this season. Combining his
confident attitude, international
playing experience and emotion for
the game, Morrison has already
begun etching his name in the pro
gram's history books.
"I don't think there is any ques
tion that Lee has done a tremen
dous job," said Stanford head coach
Bobby Clark. "He came in and just
played from the get-go. That says it
all about him."
Upon arrival on the Farm, Mor
rison has slipped right into his posi
tion of center back for the Cardinal.
A rock-solid fixture as the last de
fender in front of the goal, Morrison
has been one of the keys in the Car
dinal's defense, one of the top in the
country.
As one of only three team mem
bers on the entire squad to start
every game, Morrison has taken ad
vantage of all his opportunities.
"I'm glad I've had the opportu
nity to play all the time and that
Bobby believes in me," Morrison
said. "I just wanted to contribute to
the team and do whatever I can to
help."
From day one, Morrison already
possessed the physical skills of the
game, but his adjustment came in
adapting to Stanford's style of play.
"I hadn't played our system in a
while, so 1 was nervous the first few
games," he said.. "But it has defi
nitely gotten a lot easier and my
confidence level has really gone
up."

And the improved confidence
has been noticed by his teammates.
"Playing with Lee is not like
playing with any other freshman,"
said senior defender Jamie Clark.
"He is a confident and a natural
leader. He has never been different
than the guys with Stanford experi
ence. He fits right in."
Morrison's assertive and ener
getic personality translates into ag
gressive play on the field. Combin
ing intelligent play with physical tal
ent makes Morrison a deadly
weapon.
"Lee's exuberance makes my
job easy," said Jamie Clark, who
plays in front of Morrison on the
field. "He loves to run around and
win balls — headers, tackles."
Winning balls in the air is Morri
son's specialty on the field, and he
has utilized his leaping ability to
score goals on headers off set

pieces. Bobby Clark explains that
Morrison's style has added a lot to
both the attack and defense, as evi
denced by his four goals and three
assists.
Morrison began playing soccer
at age four in a recreation league,
and became serious at the young
age of 10.
As he entered his teenage years,
his career began to snowball, and at
16, Morrison found himself captain
of the National Under-18team.
This team matured and became
the U.S. National Under-20 squad,
of which Morrison is still a member,
adding to his international playing
experience. In fact, this April, he
will represent the United States at
the Under-20 World Cup in Nige
ria. Morrison's squad is the first
team from the U.S. ever to qualify
for the tournament.
Being named a hieh school All-

American twice, and 1997 Califor
nia Gatorade Flayer of the Year,
are only a few of Morrison's indi
vidual titles.
But personal accolades don't
mean anything to Morrison as he is
focused on a single goal.
"1 want to win a national cham
pionship this year," he articulates.
It is this heart and desire that is
one of his finest qualities
. "Lee has a lot of passion about
him and that makes him fun to
watch," Bobby Clark said. Morri
son "loves to play and loves to com
pete."
With the round of eight being
played this weekend. Morrison has
helped lead the Stanford team fur
ther into the postseason than it has
ever been.
"At some schools you are going
to be part of a tradition. But here,
we are making historv."
