ICE HOCKEY
■ Friday: Stanford (3-9) faces
Palmer College in the opening
round of the (iold Rush Tourna
ment.

Stanford (3-9) defeated Palmer
3-1, earlier this season in its first
game of the year, but has since been
ravaged by injuries on offense.
I earn captain Tom Terbell, a senior
center, and junior center Gabe
Miller, two of the top goal scorers
for the team, are expected to miss

the game due to injuries.
Stanford, however, will he boost
ed hy the return of graduate winger
Juha Yrjanheikki, whose play was
limited in last weekend's games
against California because of a leg
injury.
Another bright spot for the team
has been the play of senior «oal
tender turned forward Nick Mores,
who scored twice against the Bears
last weekend.
"Nick seems to be our hot goal
scorer," said senior defenseman
Paul Heneman.
Despite having defeated Palmer
earlier this year, Stanford is ap
proaching this game as il Palmer is
favored to win.
"We are still going to be really
short handed," Heneman said.
"Even if we only win one this week
end, it would be a good boost going
into next quarter."
