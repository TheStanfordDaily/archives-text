# Carson releases King autobiography
## 
### Joanna Corman Contributing writer 
Stanford History Prof. Clayborne Car
son — a renowned Martin Luther King Jr.
scholar who spent the last 13 years compil
ing the papers of the slain civil rights leader
— has woven King's writings and speeches
into a seamless narrative, a story that begins
with his childhood and chronicles his life as
a fearless leader.
King never wrote an autobiography.
Thanks to Carson, one now exists.
Carson hopes the newly released book,
"The Autobiography of Martin Luther
King, Jr.," will rekindle the King legacy in a
time when racism still rages.
"One of the reasons why 1 wrote the
book was to revive the message." said ('ar
son, director of the King Papers Project at
Stanford, a collaborative venture with the
King Center in Atlanta to document thou
sands of King's manuscripts. "For many
Americans, King has been reduced to a
sound bite from the I Have a Dream'
speech, rather than seeing him in the full
context of a movement."

As director of the King Papers Project,
located in Cypress Hall, (arson has pub
lished three volumes in a 14-volunie set of
King's writings. But the books are scholarly
and appeal more to academics. Carson
wanted a book for public consumption.
With the help of students, researchers
and the King family. Carson stitched to
gether letters, interviews, manuscripts, ser

mons, essays and other writings into a single
story. It begins with King's childhood in At
lanta and travels through the movement
from its birth in Montgomery, to his impris
onment in Birmingham, to his assassination
in Memphis.
The 370-page book was released earlier
this month by Time Warner and Intellectu
al Properties Management, which manages
King's estate.
When Carson signed the book contract
last February, he could finally start braiding
together materials he had his students col
lect in anticipation of the project. The book
grew out of a traveling play about King's life
produced by the Stanford Drama Depart
ment five years ago.
Since the project's inception in 1985,
when King's widow Coretta Scott King ap
pointed Carson as its director, he has had
students — from Stanford and elsewhere —
summarizing, transcribing and organizing
materials. The 14-volume series, of which
the autobiography is not a part, will take 11
more years to complete if he continues at
the pace of publishing one volume per year.

One of the greatest difficulties
Carson faced was putting together a
cohesive narrative from many
sources.
The challenge, he said, was
"making it smooth, making it read
able and accessible."
Carson lets students — both un
dergraduate and graduate — work
on the project for credit. Junior Ali
Zaidi, a human biology major, want
ed to learn more about his hero. He
spent last fall and winter summariz
ing the thousands of documents and
putting them in an online database
used for in-house research with the
aim of giving King historians world
wide access to the archives. He en
joyed sifting through the docu

ments; once he found "a telegram
from King to Muhammed Ali after
he won a big fight." If King wrote
something on a napkin, he said, they
would have that there. "They're that
precise."
For Carson, the book brought
him closer to King.
"Even though I've spent 13 years
studying him." Carson said, "the
process of telling his story in his own
words forced me to look at the world
through King's eyes and not my
own."
Each chapter begins with a time
line and a quotation from King. It is
peppered with excerpts from ser
mons, letters and addresses.
One passage indicates King's
hesitancy to take credit for the suc
cess of the campaign that ignited the
movement, the 1955 Montgomery
bus boycott.

"While the nature of this account
causes me to make frequent use of
the pronoun 'I,' in every important
part of the story it should be 'we," "
King writes.
The book. Carson hopes, will
show King's many dimensions,
some of which he feels have been
watered down.
King, in his nonviolent ways, is
remembered as moderate. Carson
reminds us differently.
"King was militant in his willing
ness to confront white action," he
said. Militancy is about action, not
rhetoric, Carson said. King's foil.
"Malcolm X. might have more mili
tant speeches, but Malcolm wasn't
confronting police in Birmingham.
That to me is the real test."
Carson will hold a discussion and
book signing in the Stanford Book
store today at 4:(X) p.m.
