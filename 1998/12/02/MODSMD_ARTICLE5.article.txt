# Carson releases King autobiography
## 
### Joanna Corman Contributing writer 
Stanford History Prof. Clayborne Car
son — a renowned Martin Luther King Jr.
scholar who spent the last 13 years compil
ing the papers of the slain civil rights leader
— has woven King's writings and speeches
into a seamless narrative, a story that begins
with his childhood and chronicles his life as
a fearless leader.
King never wrote an autobiography.
Thanks to Carson, one now exists.
Carson hopes the newly released book,
"The Autobiography of Martin Luther
King, Jr.," will rekindle the King legacy in a
time when racism still rages.
"One of the reasons why 1 wrote the
book was to revive the message." said ('ar
son, director of the King Papers Project at
Stanford, a collaborative venture with the
King Center in Atlanta to document thou
sands of King's manuscripts. "For many
Americans, King has been reduced to a
sound bite from the I Have a Dream'
speech, rather than seeing him in the full
context of a movement."

As director of the King Papers Project,
located in Cypress Hall, (arson has pub
lished three volumes in a 14-volunie set of
King's writings. But the books are scholarly
and appeal more to academics. Carson
wanted a book for public consumption.
With the help of students, researchers
and the King family. Carson stitched to
gether letters, interviews, manuscripts, ser

mons, essays and other writings into a single
story. It begins with King's childhood in At
lanta and travels through the movement
from its birth in Montgomery, to his impris
onment in Birmingham, to his assassination
in Memphis.
The 370-page book was released earlier
this month by Time Warner and Intellectu
al Properties Management, which manages
King's estate.
When Carson signed the book contract
last February, he could finally start braiding
together materials he had his students col
lect in anticipation of the project. The book
grew out of a traveling play about King's life
produced by the Stanford Drama Depart
ment five years ago.
Since the project's inception in 1985,
when King's widow Coretta Scott King ap
pointed Carson as its director, he has had
students — from Stanford and elsewhere —
summarizing, transcribing and organizing
materials. The 14-volume series, of which
the autobiography is not a part, will take 11
more years to complete if he continues at
the pace of publishing one volume per year.
