For the first time, more than 600 graduate
students and guests who stayed on campus over
the Thanksgiving recess were treated to dinner,
courtesy of the Graduate Student Council and
several contributing University organizations.
The event was held on the first and second
floors of Tresidder Memorial Union Thanksgiv

said.
