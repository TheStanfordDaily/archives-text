# Condi calls it quits, will bow out in June
## 
### Adam Kemezis Marni Leff Senior staff writers 
University Provost Condoleezza Rice
announced Dec. 9 that she will step down
in June after six years as the University's
chief academic and budget officer.
Rice has reached a remarkable level of
popularity during a tenure that began with
drastic budget restructuring and has lately
been marked by several far-reaching ini
tiatives in undergraduate education.
The 44-year-old Rice plans to take a
leave of absence from the University to
work in the private sector and eventually
return to research and teaching as a

tenured professor of political science.
University President Gerhard Casper
said a search committee will be appointed
this month and that he hopes to have a re
placement named by early spring quarter.
Casper said he was "very likely to restrict
the search to insiders."
"The learning curve for outsiders ... is
very steep." Casper added, "and we don't
have that time to lose."
Rice was appointed very early in
Casper's term as president, and the two
are known for working very closely to
gether. He led Rice's colleagues in highly
praising her work.
"I'm going to miss almost everything

about her. Not only was she a really great
provost, she was a really great friend and I
am going to be sorry to see her go,"
Casper said.
Casper and others praised her as ener
getic, tough and thorough, but stressed
how much they enjoyed working with her.
Statistics Prof. Brad Efron, the chair of the
Faculty Senate, said that of the many
provosts he has known "Condi was cer
tainly the most fun to work with."
James Montoya, the vice provost for
student affairs, listed the fun of working
with Rice as a major reason he took his
current job, while adding that "I
never walk into her office unpre
pared to answer tough questions."
Her history in international pol
itics includes working in the Bush
administration as senior director of
Soviet and East European affairs
for the National Security Council
and then as special assistant to
President Bush for national securi
ty affairs.
The provost's job affects all as
pects of academics at Stanford, and
colleagues praised her competence
all over that very wide range.
Referring to her work on the
merger between the medical cen
ters of Stanford and UC-San Fran
cisco, Eugene Bauer, dean of the
Medical School, said that Rice
"consistently displayed a depth of
understanding about the multifac
eted roles of clinical faculty," and
was "a wonderful help" in her work
with the Medical School.
Rice's chief credits at Stanford
include a large role in a series of ini
tiatives in undergraduate educa
tion. including freshman seminars.
Sophomore College and the new
Introduction to the Humanities
program.
In all of these programs, accord
ing to Ramon Saldi'var, the vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion, Rice was "not just a leader
from the top ... Condi was down
there in the trenches on every pro
ject."
That included teaching a very
popular Sophomore College
course, which Saldi'var said "set the
standards for the excellence of the
program."
He said he considered Rice
"phenomenal as a person, as an in

tellectual leader, as a moral exem
plar ... the ideal academic leader."
Although these academic initia
tives have been in the spotlight re
cently, the earlier part of Rice's
tenure cast her in several more con
troversial and often unpopular
roles, including over budget cuts
and a student protest and hunger
strike over minority issues.
Since then, Rice's popularity
among students has notably in
creased.

According to Montoya, Rice has
"personified a position most stu
dents did not even know existed"
when she arrived.
Rice, who grew up in Birming
ham. Ala., has been on Stanford's
faculty since 1981 and won the
Gores Award for Excellence in
Teaching in 1984 and the 1993
School of Humanities and Sciences
Dean's Award for Distinguished
Teaching. She was an unexpected
choice for provost in 1993. At the

time, Casper said a major reason
for choosing her was the impres
sion he had formed of her skills
when she met him at the University
of Chicago. He was the provost
there and she was a member of the
search committee that eventually
brought Casper to Stanford.
Regarding his subsequent
choice, Casper said that "when I
appointed her. she was 38 and had
never been dean or even a chair.
She did not come up through the

usual civil service. It was an unex
pected appointment, but 1 followed
my intuition and in the end 1 was
right."
In addition to her teaching, ad
ministration and public career.
Rice is an accomplished pianist and
has played in public at Stanford.
She is also on the boards of several
corporations, including Chevron, a
job that gave her the truly rare op
portunity of having an oil tanker
named after her.
