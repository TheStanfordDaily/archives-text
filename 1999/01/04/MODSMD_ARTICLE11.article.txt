# Budget cuts, student relations highlight six outstanding years as provost
## 
### Ed Guzman Adam Kemezis Senior staff writers 
To say Condolee//a Rice had an
eventful tenure as Stanford Univer
sity's Provost is an understatement.
In her first year alone, she had to
face several million dollars in budget
cuts as well as high-profile protests
and a hunger strike. Hut her legacy
does not stop there. She was also a
driving, force in some important Uni
versity issues that have made Stan
ford what it is today.
Budget cuts
One of her first tasks as provost
was extensive reform and reduction
of Stanford's budget, which was cut
by $16.8 million between 1994 and
1996. Rice cut $6 million in her first
year alone, causing ;i substantial up

roar in the community.
"It was difficult because we had
to make $6 million in cuts," she said
of the first round of trimming in a
1994 interview.
"After having made almost $40-
plus million in cuts over the last three
or four years, it was not the easiest
thing in the world to find places to
continue to cut. Obviously, I think
we had to make some cuts that im
pacted students and were difficult
for people."
The chief targets of the cuts were
administrative expenses. Many de
partments were asked in 1994 to sub
mit estimates of the impact of 5 and
10 percent cuts on their operations.
Rice oversaw the establishment
of the I Jniversity's first consolidated
budget, which I Jniversity President
(ierhard Casper called "absolutely
essential to rational planning."
"When Condi became provost

we needed to cut budgets," Casper
said. " That of course makes the job
of the chief budget officer — which
the provost is — unpleasant. It is
very difficult in times of scarcity.
"Condi was genuinely interested
in understanding what the issues
were and approached them with an
open mind. At the same time she was
very firm once the decisions were
made."
Protests and hunger strikes
During her first year as provost,
she and Casper were faced with
large-scale protests and a hunger
strike by students who accused the
University of "open hostility to mi
norities."
Among the protestors' demands
were a community center for the
East Palo Alto community, a ban

on grapes on campus, more support
for Chicano Studies and the rein
statement to a high-level position
of Cecilia Burciaga, an assistant
dean of students and popular resi
dent fellow at Casa Zapata, who
was laid off during budget cuts.
The dismissal of Burciaga, the
University's highest-ranking Chi
cana administrator, gave a spark to
student protest, and more than 50
students demonstrated in the Ouad
and four of them fasted for three
days.
The University eventually
reached a compromise with protes
tors. Chicano Studies is now estab
lished as part of the program in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, and a policy was estab
lished whereby individual dining
halls vote on whether to serve
grapes.

Status of women faculty
Among the faculty issues Rice
has had to deal with, the most promi
nent has often been the status and
number of women among Stanford's
professors. Rice said in Stanford Re
port that she wished she had been
able to do more in this area.
In recent years, the University
has faced criticism in this field, and
Rice faced tough audiences at the
Faculty Senate and elsewhere. Her
own considerable work in the area
included following up on a 1993
study of the issue. Her findings, she
said at the time, revealed "slow,
steady progress in the right direc
tion. but I would emphasize that the
figures are not Hying up."
She pointed out last year to the
Faculty Senate that there was no dif
ferential in the rate at which men

and women currently receive tenure.
She stated her opposition to "affir
mative action at the time of tenure,"
calling it "a slippery slope that we
would be very sorry to go down."
Academics
Perhaps the area where Rice has
had her most important impact has
been in Stanford's undergraduate
curriculum. In March of 1995, Rice
joined four other faculty members to
form Sophomore College, a pro
gram where selected sophomores
came back early to take small-group
classes from esteemed members of
the Stanford faculty.
Rice saw this as a chance for
sophomores to improve their rela
tionship with faculty while also giv
ing her an opportunity to interact
more closely with students.
