# Storm shuts down the Midwest
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Chicagoans
dug out from their biggest snow
storm in more than 30 years Sunday
while thousands of already delayed
travelers across the Midwest waited
for airlines to get their planes de
iced and back in the air.
About 22 inches of snow had
piled up from Chicago across north
ern Indiana as the storm spread
snow, ice, slush and rain from the
Missouri Valley to the East Coast.
"I think Old Man Winter can
just go away now and give us 80-
degree weather. He made his
point," Karen Erickson said after
finding her car covered by a snow
drift in Fond du Lac, Wis., 60 miles
north of Milwaukee.
At least 23 deaths had been
blamed on the storm, 10 of them in
Illinois.
Chicago's Lakeshore Drive
reopened and pavement was clean
on many other main arteries. How
ever. public and Catholic school
classes were canceled for Monday.
"It's going real well considering
that 24 hours ago we were in the
second-worst snowstorm in Chicago

history," said Terry Levin, a
spokesman for the city, which put
more than 700 pieces of snow-fight
ing equipment on the streets. The
city's record is 23 inches, set in 1%7.
However, U.S. Rep. Bobby
Rush, who's running against Mayor
Richard Daley in February, com
plained that crews concentrated on
neighborhoods with more white
residents.
"This is not about politics,"
Daley responded.
The city's delay in plowing away
the 18.8 inches that fell in 1979 was
blamed for Jane Byrne's upset vic
tory over incumbent Mayor
Michael Bilandic in that year's
Democratic primary.
The ice and blinding, wind-driv
en snow created havoc for air trav
elers through the entire weekend.
At Chicago's O'Hare Interna
tional Airport, the nation's busiest.
United, American and most other
airlines canceled the bulk of their
flights Saturday. And on Sunday —
expected to be one of the busiest
travel days of the year—United
canceled 60 percent of its flights out

of Chicago and American canceled
at least half, according to officials at
the airport's two largest carriers.
Sherri Gilbert waited in a line
the length of two football fields at
O'Hare's United terminal. She had
been trying to get home to Spring
field, Mo., from Portland, Maine,
since Friday night; her chances of
making a flight Sunday were grim.
"I won't get through this line
before my flight leaves," said
Gilbert, one of the lucky ones who
got a hotel room near O'Hare Sat
urday night. "1 told my husband one
more day and I'm going to have to
go shopping in Chicago."
The effects of Chicago's woes
spread far beyond the city.
"Everyone wants to go to Chica
go to get somewhere else," said
Kathy Tremmel of Harlan, lowa,
who was stuck at Omaha's Eppley
Airfield trying to catch a flight in
Chicago to take her to London.
Indianapolis International Air
port closed overnight for the first
time in 20 years. Milwaukee's
Mitchell International Airport
reopened Sunday after being shut

down overnight.
Flight cancellations at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport left travelers
sacked out in booths at Mike &
Pat's Bar & Deli — which adver
tised "Best view of the snow inside
the airport" — while others slept in
an airport mezzanine. The airport
doled out about 2,000 pillows and
2,200 blankets, airport spokesman
Mike Conway said.
"It was like one big pajama
party," said Donna Brigman. She
and her 13-year-old daughter
returned to Detroit on Saturday
from a Florida vacation but couldn't
find a way home to Ypsilanti, just 20
miles away.
The 10 to 15 inches of snow that
blanketed the Detroit metropolitan
area was the most from a winter
storm since Jan. 6,1994, the Nation
al Weather Service said.
On Sunday, the storm spre?d ice
on parts of the Northeast. Ice was
blamed for a 50-car pileup on New
York's Grand Central Parkway,
and 22 cars and a truck were caught
in a chain-reaction wreck on 1-80 in
New Jersey.
