# Clinton proposes new tax cut for long-term caregivers

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Clinton is proposing an unprece
dented $I.(HK) tax credit, at a cost of billions, to compensate 2 million Amer
ican families struggling to provide long-term care for elderly or disabled rel
atives.
The tax credit, meant to compensate caregivers for a wide range of activ
ities that tending to others requires, is part of a five-year. $6.2 billion pack
age that the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will announce
Monday.
None of it becomes reality without Congress, which last year rejected the
president's attempt at HMO reform through a "Patients Bill of Rights."
According to a draft proposal obtained by The Associated Press over the
weekend. Clinton's four-part initiative also proposes that the government
offer federal workers and retirees private long-term care insurance, in the
hope that other employers would do the same. The White House estimates

that 3(K).(KK) government employees would participate in a model program.
Clinton will ask Congress for $625 million in grants, over a five-year peri
od. to state and local "agencies on aging," created by the 1965 Older Amer
icans Act.
The money would be used to set up information and referral programs
and to provide direct services to millions of daughters and sons coping with
elderly parents at home. Services would include the same kinds meant to be
compensated for by the proposed new tax credit: counseling and training
for extraordinary care needs, such as feeding tubes; adult day care for
dependents of working caregivers; and respite care, to fill in when a care
giver goes on vacation or just needs a break.
Assistance would be equally available to parents of disabled or chroni
cally ill children and anybody else providing family care to a person, of
whatever age, with three or more conditions that limit their ability to live as

others do.
Another component of Clinton's plan would, at a cost of $10 million,
launch an information campaign to ensure that all 39 million Medicare ben
eficiaries realize they are not covered for most long-term care. Documen
tation would advise them what to look for in supplementary private insur
ance and that they might be eligible for Medicaid long-term care benefits.
Ari Fleischer, spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chair
man Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the proposals had "a lot of potential"
and would have a good chance of congressional approval if they are not
accompanied by tax hikes. He said the ideas were part of House GOP
"Contract with America" bills passed by the House in 1995.
Vice President A 1 Gore, whose 90-year-old father died last month in
Tennessee after a long infirmity, will speak for the initiative and its certain
appeal to aging baby boomers in a series of forums around the nation.
