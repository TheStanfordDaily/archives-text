## Edit Notebook Winter Break, '98 
### 
Remembering the sunny
skies of Stanford on the
snowy streets of America
SCHOOL HOLIDAYS ARE the best
of times and the worst of times. Visit
ing with friends, unfettered relaxation,
family vacations and the men's soccer team
top the list of winter break joys. Sub-zero
temperatures, delayed nights and lost time
with significant others are some of the
downsides.
For those who dream of a White Christ
mas, winter break means strapping on the
snow boots, thermally insulated gloves and
thick down jackets. While many of us grew
up in these conditions, it's always a bit diffi
cult to leave the humidity-free warmth and
clear blue skies of Stanford for the biting air
and knee- and waist-high snow of the Mid
west.
Those students from the Midwest are
usually quick to brag about their apprecia
tion of the changing seasons and the beauty
of experiencing a winter holiday where the
snow drips from the trees and sleigh bells
do ring in the night.
For students lucky enough to reside in
California, Texas, Florida and other tropi
cal places, it might be hard to imagine a
winter break where snow covers the side
walks and it takes an hour to drive to the
local grocery store.
Some of these students got their just
rewards this winter break when freezing
conditions and icy streets swept across most
of the South, and snow fell even in San
Francisco. Perhaps these students might
now come to appreciate the warm climate
that draws so many students who have had
enough of icing off their windows and tak
ing 10 minutes to prepare to walk out the
front door.

The luckiest ones were the students who
spent the holidays in exotic locations whose
weather and excitement make Stanford
pale in comparison. Israel, Maui and Zim
babwe come to mind. These students are
likely to complain at Stanford's cool tem
peratures and toss on their ski jackets when
it hits 40 degrees on those cold winter
nights.
The weather is not the only factor that
draws students back to Stanford after three
weeks of vacation. While time spent with
old friends and generous relatives is pleas
ant, most students miss the good friends
and good times left behind in a place with
out adult supervision. It's exciting to come
back to a place where you can play football
outside in the afternoon with 15 friends in
January.
One highlight of winter break most of us
will remember fondly is New Year's Eve.
New Year's Eve parties often reach
Dionysian proportions, and those of us not
fortunate enough to be in Times Square
could still impress our parents with the
incredible amounts of alcohol we can con
sume.
One significant downside of winter
break for those returning to the Farm is
the realization that we face two more
quarters of school. Our lucky friends at
most universities have finished half the
year and face just one more set of finals in
May. Stanford students look forward to
live and a half more months of school with
two sets of finals and a one-week spring
break.
While this realization may be temporar
ily depressing, spring quarter at Stanford is
not a time 1 would be happy to miss. Clear
blue skies and 75 degrees day after day can
be a lot more fun than waking up at 7 a.m.
and filing records'for the next eight hours.
