## Checking out Jesse the Body 
### 
AFTER spending
three weeks back
in the Mother
land, I felt obligated to
give you an insider's view
on why strait-laced Min
nesotans would choose a
former pro wrestler, clad

in pink tights and a feather boa, to lead their
state government. Last Saturday, motivated
by the people's right to know, I headed 30
miles out of the Twin Cities to attend
dessert and coffee with the governor-elect.
It was 15 degrees and snow was falling fast.
I like ice skating, but I'm not crazy about
doing it in a station wagon. I had to press
on. I was on a mission to get a clear picture
of the politics and pop culture surrounding
Jesse "The Body" Ventura.
By talking to the cashier at the gas sta
tion, I learned the location of the event. I
got directions to the Armory and was lucky
enough to squeeze in the door with ticket
number 295. I picked up a piece of cherry
pie and a cup of coffee (chalk that up as one
more dessert eaten out of politeness, bore
dom or peer pressure this holiday season),
and sat down next to some home-permed
blue-haired ladies wearing sweatshirts dec
orated with applique and cross-stitch. The
high school jazz band played "Rockin'
Around the Christmas Tree" and I relaxed
in my folding chair to survey the crowd.
I didn't see too many members of the 18-
to-30 crowd that supposedly swayed the
vote by getting out of their La-Z-Boys and
heading to the poll's. I didn't see anyone
who fit the bill of a young trendy profes
sional; TV news crews were the only people
obviously from the city. Vikings sweatshirts
and overalls outnumbered furs and suits.
The woman sitting next to me told me
that she liked Jesse's common sense. She
was impressed by his record with the Navy
SEALS and liked the way he worked for
himself and wasn't tangled up in political
networks and their shenanigans. The band

struck up "Anchors Aweigh" and in came
the governor-elect, bald head beaming.
He warmed up the crowd by talking a lit
tle class AA high school football and then
cut to the chase with his main message:
Don't panic. Ventura assured us of his abil
ity to work hard and his commitment to rep
resenting the people. He reassured my table
mate by saying he had decided not to meet
with any of the 200 lobbyists who had tele
phoned since his election. He again remind
ed us of his vow to immediately return a $1-
billion dollar budget surplus to the people
of Minnesota. Governor-elect Ventura
promised to be proactive, which he's
already doing by bringing some issues to the
table.
Some of his ideas are, I think, a little "out
there," a little libertarian for those of us
used to watching welfare recipients from
surrounding states move to Minnesota for
better benefits.
Ventura has said that he would like to
eliminate state child-care subsidies, saying
parents should hire a neighbor or friend, or
turn to charities for this service. He endors
es a unicameral legislature, on the grounds
that it would cut expenses, improve effi
ciency and increase legislators' accountabil
ity. He's suggested a salary for the first lady
to compensate her for giving up her job to
manage gubernatorial affairs —would a
"first man" demand the same? He's even
made some statements supporting the legal
ization of prostitution in designated "red
light" districts. Hmmm
I expect Jesse to at least add some chili
powder to the middle-moderate-mush on
the menu. Sometimes it's hard to know
what's going to work best unless you try it
and see what happens. Maybe the election
of Jesse Ventura will push toes across the
party line and cause decisions to be made
issue by issue. Jesse has said, "I'll make mis
takes, but they'll be honest mistakes."
Our leftist-liberal U.S. Senator, Paul
Wellstone, was quoted as saying, "Some

pundit said recently that Minnesota should
be 'spanked' for the decision it made. I'm
contemptuous of that elitism. I appreciate
the way [Ventura] connected to the people,
the populism of the campaign.
Jesse added, "We are the talk of the
country. But it's not me they're talking
about, it's you. If you see people walking
around staring at you, they've come to see
who it was that voted me in."
Minnesotans tend to be portrayed as
polite, blond, loyal deputy sheriffs who talk
funny (just FYI, Fargo is in North Dakota).
To some extent, it's true. Scandinavians
were the only immigrants who dug the cli
mate. Statistics of average income, educa
tion level and birthweights rank Minnesota
as one of the "Most Livable States." It's a
place where you pay for your gas after you
pump.
But Minnesotans have a wild side too.
We like big things, bold ones: Paul Bunyan,
the legendary lumberjack whose pancakes
were cooked on a skillet as big as a skating
rink, the Biggest Ball of Twine, and the
Mega Mall (yes, it really does have a roller
coaster inside). Even Scandinavian Luther
an grandmothers have a sense of humor.
Think about what they bring to potlucks:
Spam, Jell-0 salads with canned fruit and
miniature marshmallows, or lutefisk (white
fish preserved in lye — think fish-flavored
Jell-O).
Jesse closed by inviting us to his inaugu
ral ball, saying that Minnesotans should
have some fun before we talk any more pol
itics. Has politics ever been fun before?
Maybe it can be if your governor has his
own action figure doll.

networks and their shenanigans. The band

struck up "Anchors Aweigh" and in came
the governor-elect, bald head beaming.
He warmed up the crowd by talking a lit
tle class AA high school football and then
cut to the chase with his main message:
Don't panic. Ventura assured us of his abil
ity to work hard and his commitment to rep
resenting the people. He reassured my table
mate by saying he had decided not to meet
with any of the 200 lobbyists who had tele
phoned since his election. He again remind
ed us of his vow to immediately return a $1-
billion dollar budget surplus to the people
of Minnesota. Governor-elect Ventura
promised to be proactive, which he's
already doing by bringing some issues to the
table.
Some of his ideas are, I think, a little "out
there," a little libertarian for those of us
used to watching welfare recipients from
surrounding states move to Minnesota for
better benefits.
Ventura has said that he would like to
eliminate state child-care subsidies, saying
parents should hire a neighbor or friend, or
turn to charities for this service. He endors
es a unicameral legislature, on the grounds
that it would cut expenses, improve effi
ciency and increase legislators' accountabil
ity. He's suggested a salary for the first lady
to compensate her for giving up her job to
manage gubernatorial affairs —would a
"first man" demand the same? He's even
made some statements supporting the legal
ization of prostitution in designated "red
light" districts. Hmmm
I expect Jesse to at least add some chili
powder to the middle-moderate-mush on
the menu. Sometimes it's hard to know
what's going to work best unless you try it
and see what happens. Maybe the election
of Jesse Ventura will push toes across the
party line and cause decisions to be made
issue by issue. Jesse has said, "I'll make mis
takes, but they'll be honest mistakes."
Our leftist-liberal U.S. Senator, Paul
Wellstone, was quoted as saying, "Some

pundit said recently that Minnesota should
be 'spanked' for the decision it made. I'm
contemptuous of that elitism. I appreciate
the way [Ventura] connected to the people,
the populism of the campaign.
Jesse added, "We are the talk of the
country. But it's not me they're talking
about, it's you. If you see people walking
around staring at you, they've come to see
who it was that voted me in."
Minnesotans tend to be portrayed as
polite, blond, loyal deputy sheriffs who talk
funny (just FYI, Fargo is in North Dakota).
To some extent, it's true. Scandinavians
were the only immigrants who dug the cli
mate. Statistics of average income, educa
tion level and birthweights rank Minnesota
as one of the "Most Livable States." It's a
place where you pay for your gas after you
pump.
But Minnesotans have a wild side too.
We like big things, bold ones: Paul Bunyan,
the legendary lumberjack whose pancakes
were cooked on a skillet as big as a skating
rink, the Biggest Ball of Twine, and the
Mega Mall (yes, it really does have a roller
coaster inside). Even Scandinavian Luther
an grandmothers have a sense of humor.
Think about what they bring to potlucks:
Spam, Jell-0 salads with canned fruit and
miniature marshmallows, or lutefisk (white
fish preserved in lye — think fish-flavored
Jell-O).
Jesse closed by inviting us to his inaugu
ral ball, saying that Minnesotans should
have some fun before we talk any more pol
itics. Has politics ever been fun before?
Maybe it can be if your governor has his
own action figure doll.
Rachel Hutton, a senior majoring in prod
uct design, is a registered Minnesota voter.
She is trying to round up a couple hundred
dollars for a plane ticket home because she
wants to be splashed by beer when Jesse
Ventura dives into a tank of local micro
brew at the Inaugural Ball.
