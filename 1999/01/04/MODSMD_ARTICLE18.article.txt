Cutting African classes
at Oxford is misguided
•As Stanford students studying overseas in
Oxford, we were dismayed to learn recent
ly that Overseas Studies has decided to dis
continue the offerings of African History
and Literature courses taught by Prof.
Anthony Kirk-Greene in the Oxford pro
gram. This term is like many previous terms
(as former students may attest), in that the
African course has been the most popular
and arguably the most rewarding among
Stanford students.
The reason given for this axing is that the
offerings of the Oxford program should
focus on Britain and Europe. One must
think that OSP is forgetting that the British
Empire once encompassed over 40 percent
of the world's population, and that in order
to understand this phenomenon one must
study the ruled as well as the rulers. Cours
es such as that offered this quarter, "20th
Century African History through the
African Novel," focusing primarily on the
institutions and achievements of British
Colonial Africa and the Commonwealth
which followed independence in the l%os.

are as important to understanding modern
and historical Britain as courses which focus
narrowly on the Isles.
In fact, not only are the courses impor
tant because they are taught by a world
renowned Africanist (and former colonial
officer), but because there are no real
equivalents to these courses at Stanford.
They were tailored to be complementary to
Stanford's African Studies courses while
being novel in their approach and particu
larly relevant to Britain.
How ironic that on the same day the
highly respected Nigerian author Wole
Soyinka should appear at Stanford in a
Presidential Lecture in the Humanities and
call for integration of other cultural tradi
tions with University curriculum, OSP
informed Prof. Kirk-Greene that he would
no longer be allowed to teach his courses to
Stanford students. Of course, most people
would not find this so ironic — most of us
did not know of Wole Soyinka either until
we took the course.
The short-sightedness of this decision
simply illustrates Soyinka's point. Just as
Soyinka argues for recognition of the inter
connectedness of Greek. Indian, Arab, and
other philosophies, we argue that the cross
cultural influences on the development of

history and literature must be considered in
just the same way. These courses in Oxford
have been a great step in educating Stan
ford students about the relationship
between Europe and its colonies, and how
this history has affected each since indepen
dence. We, as current students in the
Oxford program, ask that Overseas Studies
reconsider the decision to cancel these
courses.

Cal causes the conflicts
In 19%, fans from the Cal student sec
tion assaulted the Tree. In 1997, fans from
the Cal student section tore down the north
goalpost at Stanford (doesn't the winning
team usually do this?). In 1998, fans from
the Cal student section physically assaulted
police officers in an attempt to "get to" the
Stanford students who were celebrating on
the field.
Not that Stanford fans have been com
pletely innocent, but it seems as though
Stanford fans' greatest offense has been cel

ebrating and verbal taunting. On the other
hand, Cal fans seem to take out their frus
trations by destroying property and causing
injuries.
Seems like the source of the problem is
awfully one-sided. Maybe the solutions
should be as well. Perhaps Cal should pro
vide the additional hundreds of security
officers needed to contain its fans who seem
to be incapable of accepting defeat without
being destructive.

Stanford students need
to defend themselves
In the wake of a third consecutive Big
Game marked by post-game violence, it
seems the common response here at Stan
ford has been to shake our heads at Cal stu
dents with a self-righteous disdain. We like
to tell ourselves it's those barbarous Berke
ley kids who need to get a life, but in reality
the behavior of Stanford students has been
equally childish.
After flooding onto the field after last

year's Big Game victory, Stanford students
incited the Cal student section with taunts
and jeers from the field below. When
Berkeley students subsequently broke
down the fence and stormed the field them
selves — surprise, surprise — Stanford stu
dents fled like cowards in the opposite
direction. This act of mindless terror only
fueled the chaos and prevented police and
security from maintaining order.
In the subsequent melee, not only were
several people injured, but the suddenly
outnumbered Stanford students who stood
their ground had to watch helplessly while
Cal students tore down our goalpost —
after we had won the game on our field.
What most people here fail to under
stand is that Cal students, for whatever rea
son, resent Stanford with a passion.
Don't be surprised then when that
resentment turns into open hostility toward
Stanford students. If you're going to pro
voke them, be prepared to face the conse
quences.
Cal students may be unnecessarily bel
ligerent, but at least they have enough pride
to back up their words,
