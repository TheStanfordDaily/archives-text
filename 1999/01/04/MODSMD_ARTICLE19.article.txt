# Where We Are
## David Stein Finding the real history of 1998 
### 
IN I HIS NEW year, let us no longer
mention Bill Clinton. Let us begin the
process that history will complete —
that reproachful act of neglect in which he
will be banished to some lonely hill in some
lonely land where he may congregate with
such luminaries as Benjamin Harrison,
Chester Arthur, Millard Fillmore, Warren
Harding and Gerald Ford. When we hear
his name, let us cover our ears, and when his
picture flashes once more before us. let us
turn our eyes to more compelling images.
He will escape from this impeachment —
and rightly so — but let his fleeing not be
into open arms. For why should we pay any
more attention to a man who inherited this
country with such promise and then dashed
the hopes of millions upon the rocks of his
own vanity and pride?
And let us speak no more of the Repub
licans. Like the president, their abandon
ment of us has been complete. They did not
counter Clinton's shame with acts of
courage; they offered us only a repulsive
blend of greed and vengeance. Their
appeals to conscience and the "rule of law"
recall the worst of McCarthyism's political

reign of terror, and their rejection of the
people's voice will secure their place in his
tory as a party of irrelevance. Let us forget
them until the next election when we may
send them scurrying back to their caves.
Let us dismiss the partisan bickering,
Monica Lewinsky, definitions of sex, and
the media's fascination with scandal. Let us
dismiss all of it.for this is a new year and we
have the opportunity, however contrived, to
begin again. Let us not live another 1998 —
the year in which time stood still and,
except for this debacle, nothing happened.
Of course, this is the picture that the
media will have us believe. Aside from a
few sidebars about hurricanes, Viagra,
Mark McGwire and the rise of the Internet,
Clinton and his cohorts captured the bulk of
the "Year in Review" headlines. But is it
really true that the great golden circles of
our cities and towns stopped revolving while
the drama of despair played itself out in
Washington? Can a president crippled by
hubris and hormones, and his ill-willed pur
suer, really be considered Time magazine's
Men of the Year? Is it true that 365 days of
260 million people's lives can be condensed

into one-hour end-of-the-year television
specials in which the follies, fantasies and
fabrications of a few hundred can be said to
dominate our national landscape?
Of course not. The aspirations and fears
of a country cannot be reflected in the soap
opera of Bill Clinton, in spite of what any
so-called expert panel of socio-political
commentators say. America is not one man,
nor will it ever be. Our happiness and sur
vival do not depend on his. hut on those
with whom we intimately align ourselves
every day.
But where were their stories in 1998?
Where were the issues — Social Security
reform, the health of the world economy,
serious talk of improving our education sys
tem — that actually impact our lives?
Where was the coverage of the normal,
hard-working individual who does not com
mit public adultery? Where were the stories
of decency and success?
Where was the story of the Kuykendalls?
The Kuykendalls have never been on the
cover of People magazine nor featured on
CNN. Their status will not garner them
tables with Hollywood celebrities. And they

drive Fords instead of Mercedeses. Hut in
IWK. American history converged on their
household — the household where I spent
many hours of my childhood playing with
their eldest son. Brent — like few others in
the country.
In early November. Steve Kuykendall
ran successively for California's 36th Con
gressional district and will be sworn in this
Wednesday. When Bob Livingston resigned
his position as Speaker of the House-elect,
Mr. Kuykendall was called upon to vote for
a new Congressional leadership.
In the same few days, their daughter,
Kerry, flew F-14s over Iraq, participating fn
Operation Desert Fox. She was one of the
first three women ever engaged in air com
bat.
In a matter of hours, members of the
Kuykendall family were involved in the
impeachment of a president and a war.
Everything that was happening to this coun
try was happening to them with the force of
personal consequence.
But, of course, you would have never
heard of the Kuykendalls if not for this col
umn. Their story, however briefly summa

rized here, would have been completely lost
to the whole of the American public and
probably still will. Their tale of hard-fought
success pales in comparison to obscene
accounts of deception. They have no chance
against the dark specter of Bill Clinton.
And that is why we must dismiss all the
trouble in Washington. It is only through a
deliberate forgetting of Clinton and the
Republicans' misfortunes that other issues
can be explored.
For the primary task of the historian and
the investigative journalist will not be to
chronicle the impeachment of Bill
Clinton — the newspapers seem to have
done a thorough job of that already — but
to cover all the stories that have been lost in
the wake of this scandal. Nineteen-ninety
eight was not a year that did not happen, but
a vear vet to he realized.

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, reports that IWS was also an
eventful year for Brent Knykendall. He lev
eled off at six-foot-six, dyed his hair blonde
and — get this — became president of his
chapter of Sigma Chi.

Operation Desert Fox. She was one of the
first three women ever engaged in air com
bat.
In a matter of hours, members of the
Kuykendall family were involved in the
impeachment of a president and a war.
Everything that was happening to this coun
try was happening to them with the force of
personal consequence.
But, of course, you would have never
heard of the Kuykendalls if not for this col
umn. Their story, however briefly summa

rized here, would have been completely lost
to the whole of the American public and
probably still will. Their tale of hard-fought
success pales in comparison to obscene
accounts of deception. They have no chance
against the dark specter of Bill Clinton.
And that is why we must dismiss all the
trouble in Washington. It is only through a
deliberate forgetting of Clinton and the
Republicans' misfortunes that other issues
can be explored.
For the primary task of the historian and
the investigative journalist will not be to
chronicle the impeachment of Bill
Clinton — the newspapers seem to have
done a thorough job of that already — but
to cover all the stories that have been lost in
the wake of this scandal. Nineteen-ninety
eight was not a year that did not happen, but
a vear vet to he realized.

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, reports that IWS was also an
eventful year for Brent Knykendall. He lev
eled off at six-foot-six, dyed his hair blonde
and — get this — became president of his
chapter of Sigma Chi.
