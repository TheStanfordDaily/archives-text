# Provost going back to her passions
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Staff writer 
When Condoleezza Rice speaks of her ex
perience as a Soviet specialist at the end of
the Cold War, her eyes light up. Six years in
the University's second-highest administra
tive position has kept her away from the pol
icy arena, but now the retiring University
Provost is returning to her passion, interna
tional politics.
In an interview last month, Rice, who will
step down in June, explained her plans for

the coming years, which include a few years
of "practical work" in international politics
followed by a return to teaching as a Stanford
professor of political science.
Rice said she will examine new political
economic circumstances in her work in the
private sector. "States are going to make a
transition to a place in the international econ
omy," she said.
Rice's decision to step down was prompt
ed by a desire to return to teaching.
" About a year ago, I realized that
my position was far away from my
work and my field. I had to decide
whether to continue in higher educa
tion administration or international
polities. Last summer I made a firm
decision that this was the year to step
down," she said.
The best part of the job. Rice said,
was teaching and advising students.
"I [strive to maintain] contact
with students as students," Rice said.
In the spirit of promoting faculty
student interaction at an early stage
in each student's experience. Rice
has supported programs such as
Stanford Introductory Studies and
Sophomore College, which aim at
teaming students with teachers in a
small-group setting.
"The results. I believe, are that
Stanford offers an undergraduate
education that is second to none
We don't wait for students to declare
their major to become part of the re
search enterprise," she said.
Rice said the part of her job she

least enjoyed was the process of cut
ting the budget. When Rice took
over the helm in 1993, the Universi
ty "was not in budget equilibrium —
we were spending more than we had.
My first goal in entering was to fix
that problem," she said.
After $17 million in cuts and $3
million in new revenue over two
years, the budget was balanced.
"Life is full of trade-offs, but by
and large, our decisions have been
good .... We're in a better financial
position. We were able to make a
difference when the graduate stu
dent housing problem [surfaced] last
spring. We really came through so
that graduate students could have a
place to live in this high-cost area,"
she said.
In retiring from her duties as
Provost, Rice will return to her spe
cialty, Eastern European politics.
Rice, who joined Stanford's political
science department in 1981, has writ
ten several books on the former So
viet Union and German unification.
From 1989 through March 1991,
Rice served in the Hush Administra
tion as Director, and then Senior Di
rector, of Soviet and East European

Affairs in the National Security
Council.
Asked whether she has ruled out
returning to government service in
the future, Rice was ambivalent.
"It is a rare opportunity to be a
Soviet specialist at the end of the
Cold War. Poland was liberated,
Germany unified, there was no time
for bureaucratic infighting. I'm cir
cumspect about how soon to try it
again."
"Working in the government is a
very good experience. I haven't
ruled it out, but I'm not eager to re
turn to [it]. I had an unusually good
experience. I worked under a presi
dent I had a lot of faith in, and I
adored my boss, [National Security
Advisor] Brent Scowcroft."
Rice dismissed rumors that she
will advise Texas Governor George
W. Hush in a possible bid for the
presidency.
"People keep putting two and
two together and getting 264," she
said, adding that Bush, who is a close
friend, has yet to officially declare
his candidacy.
In a departure from strict Repub
lican ideology. Rice expressed sup

port for affirmative action.
"1 support affirmative action in
higher education. It makes the stu
dent body and the administration
more integrated. It's accelerating
the integration of all strata of society
... [so] we don't have to wait 1(X)
years. I think it has done very, very
well," she said.
Rice, however, cautioned against
excess race consciousness.
"I find that those who are too
concerned with minority students'
particular experiences exhibit 're
verse racism,'" Rice said. "It is
equally bad to be patronized as to be
disliked. In East Palo Alto, people
patronize these kids."
Rice is a Founding Board Mem
ber of the Center for a New Genera
tion, an educational support fund for
schools in East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
"I was taught to blast through
barriers. What's the alternative? De
crying the barriers? I tend to think
that societies move largely through
the force of individuals breaking
barriers," she said.
"I know that the situation in the
U.S. is better [than in most of the

world] given the extraordinary
range of ethnicities at approximat
ing a multi-ethnic democracy. It
doesn't happen overnight."
In closing advice to students, Rice
emphasized the range of opportuni
ties available at Stanford.
"This is such an extraordinary
place. I have students who return
after a few years of working and they
say, i wish I had known what an
amazing opportunities I had." Expe
rience this place day by day." Rice

said.
"You have your lifetime to figure
out which career to embark on. Find
out what you're passionate about
and find a way to synthesize your in
terests and your talents, you will
have achieved what you should have
in college," she said.
Rice will remain at her Stanford
home during her leave of absence.
"The football team is going to be
good next year, and I don't want to
miss it," she quipped.

their major to become part of the re
search enterprise," she said.
Rice said the part of her job she

least enjoyed was the process of cut
ting the budget. When Rice took
over the helm in 1993, the Universi
ty "was not in budget equilibrium —
we were spending more than we had.
My first goal in entering was to fix
that problem," she said.
After $17 million in cuts and $3
million in new revenue over two
years, the budget was balanced.
"Life is full of trade-offs, but by
and large, our decisions have been
good .... We're in a better financial
position. We were able to make a
difference when the graduate stu
dent housing problem [surfaced] last
spring. We really came through so
that graduate students could have a
place to live in this high-cost area,"
she said.
In retiring from her duties as
Provost, Rice will return to her spe
cialty, Eastern European politics.
Rice, who joined Stanford's political
science department in 1981, has writ
ten several books on the former So
viet Union and German unification.
From 1989 through March 1991,
Rice served in the Hush Administra
tion as Director, and then Senior Di
rector, of Soviet and East European

Affairs in the National Security
Council.
Asked whether she has ruled out
returning to government service in
the future, Rice was ambivalent.
"It is a rare opportunity to be a
Soviet specialist at the end of the
Cold War. Poland was liberated,
Germany unified, there was no time
for bureaucratic infighting. I'm cir
cumspect about how soon to try it
again."
"Working in the government is a
very good experience. I haven't
ruled it out, but I'm not eager to re
turn to [it]. I had an unusually good
experience. I worked under a presi
dent I had a lot of faith in, and I
adored my boss, [National Security
Advisor] Brent Scowcroft."
Rice dismissed rumors that she
will advise Texas Governor George
W. Hush in a possible bid for the
presidency.
"People keep putting two and
two together and getting 264," she
said, adding that Bush, who is a close
friend, has yet to officially declare
his candidacy.
In a departure from strict Repub
lican ideology. Rice expressed sup

port for affirmative action.
"1 support affirmative action in
higher education. It makes the stu
dent body and the administration
more integrated. It's accelerating
the integration of all strata of society
... [so] we don't have to wait 1(X)
years. I think it has done very, very
well," she said.
Rice, however, cautioned against
excess race consciousness.
"I find that those who are too
concerned with minority students'
particular experiences exhibit 're
verse racism,'" Rice said. "It is
equally bad to be patronized as to be
disliked. In East Palo Alto, people
patronize these kids."
Rice is a Founding Board Mem
ber of the Center for a New Genera
tion, an educational support fund for
schools in East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
"I was taught to blast through
barriers. What's the alternative? De
crying the barriers? I tend to think
that societies move largely through
the force of individuals breaking
barriers," she said.
"I know that the situation in the
U.S. is better [than in most of the

world] given the extraordinary
range of ethnicities at approximat
ing a multi-ethnic democracy. It
doesn't happen overnight."
In closing advice to students, Rice
emphasized the range of opportuni
ties available at Stanford.
"This is such an extraordinary
place. I have students who return
after a few years of working and they
say, i wish I had known what an
amazing opportunities I had." Expe
rience this place day by day." Rice

said.
"You have your lifetime to figure
out which career to embark on. Find
out what you're passionate about
and find a way to synthesize your in
terests and your talents, you will
have achieved what you should have
in college," she said.
Rice will remain at her Stanford
home during her leave of absence.
"The football team is going to be
good next year, and I don't want to
miss it," she quipped.
