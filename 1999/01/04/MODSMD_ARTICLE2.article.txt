When Condoleezza Rice speaks of her ex
perience as a Soviet specialist at the end of
the Cold War, her eyes light up. Six years in
the University's second-highest administra
tive position has kept her away from the pol
icy arena, but now the retiring University
Provost is returning to her passion, interna
tional politics.
In an interview last month, Rice, who will
step down in June, explained her plans for

the coming years, which include a few years
of "practical work" in international politics
followed by a return to teaching as a Stanford
professor of political science.
Rice said she will examine new political
economic circumstances in her work in the
private sector. "States are going to make a
transition to a place in the international econ
omy," she said.
Rice's decision to step down was prompt
ed by a desire to return to teaching.
