## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
After a hard-nosed 57-50 victory
against Temple on Dec. 29, the Stan
ford mens basketball team breathed
a huge sigh of relief.
Head coach Mike Montgomery
earned his 40()th career coaching win
with the victory, but in his usual style
downplayed the achievement and fo
cused on something more important.
The season was only six weeks
old, yet the players must have felt
like they had been playing for an
eternity.

(9-1,1-0), 7:30 p.m. Maples Pavilion.

■ Saturday: Stanford 72, Oregon
State (6-4.0-1)56.

Stanford (11 -2,1 -0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) fought through the first por
tion of the 1998-99 season, battling
astronomically high preseason ex
pectations and the toughest precon
ference schedule in its history, and
emerged with a 10-2 record and a No.
5 national ranking.
1999 would bring the beginning of
conference play and would put a
close to a grueling preseason which
sent several key players to the bench
with injuries.
Then again, the Pac-10 season
didn't exactly figure to be any easier,
despite the fact that the Cardinal is a
consensus favorite to win the confer
ence.
Nonetheless, Stanford found it
self at home on Saturday afternoon
hosting Oregoa.State. And from the
opening tip,it was easy to see that the
Cardinal was ready to open the next
part of its schedule with a bang.
"We look at the season in three
stages: the preseason, the Pac-10 sea
son. and the postseason." assistant
coach Trent Johnson said before Sat
urday's game. "The conference title
is an important goal for this team. At

the same time, we know we will have
to take it one game, one possession at
a time in order to reach that goal."
And Saturday's 72-56 domination
of Oregon State (6-4,0-1) was a fan
tastic start to what figures to be a se
rious run at that first-ever Pac-10
title.
The Cardinal stormed out of the
gates against the Beavers, control
ling all aspects of the game and run
ning away to a 41-18 lead at halftime.
In particular, senior guard Kris
Weems continued his hot shooting,
knocking down three 3-pointers in
the opening stanza.
Stanford continued to roll in the
second half, and consecutive baskets
by forward Peter Sauer put the Car
dinal ahead by 31 points, 59-28, with
13:40 remaining in the game.
From that point on, the Beavers
slowly chipped away at the Stanford
lead, getting 20 points from the sweet
shooting of sophomore Josh
Steinthal.
But the solid early play from the
Cardinal was way too much for the
Beavers to overcome. Senior point
guard Arthur Lee triggered an up
tempo style of play throughout the
game and held the Beavers' leading
scorer, Deaundra Tanner, tojust five
points, while Sauer and Weems pro
vided consistent perimeter shooting.
Sauer finished with 19 points,
nailing eight of 12 shots from the
field, while Weems scored 17.
"On this team, you're not going to
get 10 or 15 shots a night," Sauer said.
"It becomes a matter of what they
are taking away. [Saturday] they fo
cused on our post play, so it was nice
to be able to knock down some shots.
Kris, Art and I have to make those
shots to open it up for our big guys.
Those are the shots shooters have to
make."
Weems led the team with 31 min
utes, as Montgomery opted to leave
the starters in for the majority of the
contest. And the senior shooting
guard felt that the extra time helped
his confidence and ability to con
tribute on the offensive end.
"It actually helps to know that I
won't get subbed out," Weems said.

"It helps me to get my rhythm. I have
been taken out after the first time out
in most games, but I can actually
score the most after that first break.
[.Getting my shooting touch back)
felt really good."
The Cardinal's suffocating defen
sive effort caused a number of ill-ad
vised shots from Tanner and the rest
of his Oregon State teammates,
which set up the fast break for Stan
ford.
On the break, Lee was able to cre
ate a number of offensive opportuni

ties for Stanford, and the Cardinals
ability to hit from three-point range
in such situations proved to be the
real Beaver killer.
"We always try to push it up." Lee
said. "It was just working really well.
We were able to keep the game fun.
And that is why we are here."
The Cardinal will look to contin
ue the fun as it hosts Oregon tonight.
The game against the Ducks will
mark what should be the raucous re
turn of the full force of the Sixth Man
Club to the Farm.

to be able to knock down some shots.
Kris, Art and I have to make those
shots to open it up for our big guys.
Those are the shots shooters have to
make."
Weems led the team with 31 min
utes, as Montgomery opted to leave
the starters in for the majority of the
contest. And the senior shooting
guard felt that the extra time helped
his confidence and ability to con
tribute on the offensive end.
"It actually helps to know that I
won't get subbed out," Weems said.

"It helps me to get my rhythm. I have
been taken out after the first time out
in most games, but I can actually
score the most after that first break.
[.Getting my shooting touch back)
felt really good."
The Cardinal's suffocating defen
sive effort caused a number of ill-ad
vised shots from Tanner and the rest
of his Oregon State teammates,
which set up the fast break for Stan
ford.
On the break, Lee was able to cre
ate a number of offensive opportuni

ties for Stanford, and the Cardinals
ability to hit from three-point range
in such situations proved to be the
real Beaver killer.
"We always try to push it up." Lee
said. "It was just working really well.
We were able to keep the game fun.
And that is why we are here."
The Cardinal will look to contin
ue the fun as it hosts Oregon tonight.
The game against the Ducks will
mark what should be the raucous re
turn of the full force of the Sixth Man
Club to the Farm.
