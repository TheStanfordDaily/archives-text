CORVALLIS. Ore. — The Stan
ford women's basketball team (5-7,
1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) started
the new year and league play off
right with an 83-63 win against Ore
gon State (8-2.0-1) Saturday night.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: Stanford (5-7, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) at Oregon (10-2, 1-
0), 7 p.m.
■ Saturday: Stanford 83, Oregon
State (8-2,0-1)63.

"We knew coming into this, this
is it, this is the new year, this is our
start of the Pac-1(), we need to
make a statement. We need to
come out and play true Stanford
basketball. We need to play our
game," said sophomore captain
Carolyn Moos. "This was a good
start."
After the game, the mood was
one of excitement. In past years, a
win over Oregon State would hard
ly have roused such a response
from a Stanford team. This year is
different and the win was crucial.
Besides not being ranked for the
first time since the 1987-88 season
and having a losing preseason
record, the Cardinal has struggled
with early season injuries and the
growing pains associated with
being young and inexperienced.
The Cardinal has won the nine out
of the past 10 conference titles but
this year sixth-ranked UCLA is
considered the team to beat.
Given the history, and the roller
coaster season, celebration was in
order after Saturday's win. I he vic
tory was a milestone of sorts, a

baby step on the road through the
Pac-10.
"I think there were 10 positives
for any one negative out there,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We forced them to turn it over, we
were able to play a lot of different
lineups, we had a strong shooting
percentage and we got to the free
throw line."
Indeed, it all fell into place at
Ciill Stadium. Stanford shot 56.5
percent from the field and was 12
for 15 from the line. Four players
managed to score in double digits.
After shaking a few early game
jitters, the Cardinal got into its
groove and was unstoppable, com
ing at the Beavers from every angle
— outside the circle, in the paint
and from the line.
In fact, the final score didn't in
dicate how lopsided the win was.
The Cardinal grabbed the lead four
minutes into the game and retained
it the rest of the way. At one point
in the second half, Stanford led by
29 points.
"Once we established our inside
game, a double-team was eoming
over right away, and then we did a
good job taking outside shots," said
Moos. "If thev tried to hurt us de
fensively one way, we tried to hurt
them offensively another way."
Freshman Bethany Donaphin,
in her first start for Stanford, led
the team with 20 points and eight
rebounds. She has stepped up to
the big league of Division I basket
ball nicely.
"I started feeling more comfort
able and confident on the court,
and it just came," said Donaphin.
Junior guard Christina Batastini
added 14 points and four assists in
only 22 minutes of play. Batastini
has consistently been playing well

in the past several games, sparking
the Cardinal offense despite com
ing off the bench. At one point,
Batastini sunk a Hail Mary three
pointer over her defender with
only one second left on the shot
clock.
It was a homecoming for fresh
man Lindsey Yamasaki, who hails
from Oregon City. Yamasaki start
ed off slowly, scoring only one
point in the first half, hut found
some of her blue-chip touch in the
second half, adding 11 points and
four rebounds to the Cardinal ef
fort.
"I tried not to put a lot of pres
sure op myself to play exceptional
ly," said Yamasaki. "But it's excit
ing to have my whole high school
basketball team, my whole family
and people from town here."
Unlike Stanford, Oregon State
could not get into a rhythm, espe
cially after its leading scorer, Sissel
Pierce, picked up two fouls in the
first two minutes of play. No
Beaver was able to score in the
double digits and the team shot a
collective 30 percent from the field.
Part of Oregon State's problem
was Stanford's killer defense. Ju
nior guard Milena Flores gave the
Beaver back court a hard time the
entire 40 minutes and ended up
with five steals.
"We've been playing hard all
week and I thought we were ready
for the game," said Donaphin. "We
all felt a sense of urgency."
The Cardinal doesn't have
much time to dwell on its win as it
faces Oregon on Monday. The
Ducks beat California 64-49 on
Saturday and are 10-2 this year.
Oregon is led by sophomore
Brianne Mehany, who averages
12.8 points per game.
