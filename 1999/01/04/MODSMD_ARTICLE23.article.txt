# THE 						FINAL FOUR2
## End of the road for Cardinal seniors All-American goalie Aguilera leads class of '99 into sunset 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
NEWPOR T, Calif. — It's farewell to
the Farm for five of the top players on
the Stanford men's water polo team.

And after four seasons, the seniors fi
nally got the chance they'd been wait
ing for — a trip to the NCAA champi
onship match.
"This was quite a memorable
year," said head coach Dante Detta

manti. "We had a really great group
of guys. It's too had it had to end this
way."
The 9-8 overtime loss to I JSC may
have been disappointing, but at least
the Cardinal finally made it to the fi

nals. The last time Stanford played in
the national title match was in 1994,
when the Cardinal took home the
championship trophy.
Until this season, seniors Chris
Aguilera, Layne Beaubien, David
Hay, Jeremiah Robison and Arturo
Rodelo had failed to make it to the
national championship. And despite
the loss, they proved that they know
how to lead the team and play serious
water polo.
"I love our seniors," said junior
Sean Joy. "They're really fun to play
with and they're really great leaders
as well as players."
Aguilera, Stanford's starting
goalie and one of its captains. hnd"a
stellar season in which he notched
258 saves, including seven in the
championship game. He received
All-Tournament First Team honors
and was named Most Valuable De
fensive Player.
Beaubien. who led the Cardinal
offense this year with 48 points, in
cluding four two-pointers, joined
Aguilera on the First Team. Hay,
who gave a strong performance at
two-meters, was awarded second
team honors and finished the season
with 21 points.
Robison and Rodelo tallied 17
and 36 points for the Cardinal respec

tively. Both played pivotal roles in
Stanford's 21 victories this season.
Not only have the seniors played
some incredible water polo, but they
have also been leaders for the
younger players.
"A lot of the younger guys really
looked up to those [senior] guys," Joy
said. "Each of them, individually, re
ally did a good job leading the team."
Although Stanford lost to USC at
the NCA As, the Cardinal has a lot to
be proud of. The Stanford squad
managed to defeat the Trojans in a
difficult semifinal overtime match at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championship Tournament.
AfttrftiVr Quarters of regulation play
and two three-minute overtime peri
ods, Stanford downed DSC 7-6 and
captured the MPSF title for the first
time since 1994.
For the seniors, it took four years
of hard work to make it to that point.
"We're losing five [players] who
will be tough to replace," Dettamanti
said. "As a coach, this was one of my
most enjoyable seasons. But we have
a good group returning next year."
The returning squad will work to
continue the program's tradition of
excellence. But it will still be hard to
say goodbye to such a talented group
of players.
