Former Stanford place-kicker
Eric Abrams pleaded no contest
Dec. 7 to felony false imprisonment
and misdemeanor child molestation
charges in Santa Clara County Su
perior Court.
The charges came after Abrams,
25, posed as a Nike salesman and
lured a 14-year-old boy to his apart
ment in 1997.
In exchange for his plea, the Dis
trict Attorney's office dropped a
felony count of attempted false im
prisonment involving a 13-year-old
boy that Abrams had met on a plane
trip in December 1997, according to
the San Jose Mercury News.
If Abrams had been convicted of
all three counts, he would have

faced a maximum sentence of five
years and eight months in jail.
"We thought it was a fair offer,"
Defense Attorney Kenneth Robin
son told the Mercury News.
Under the current terms,
Abrams is expected to be sentenced
in February to two years in prison
and three years parole. Once re
leased, he will have to register as a
sex offender.
Abrams also faces separate
charges in San Francisco. He is
charged with two felony counts of
impersonating an officer, two
counts of kidnapping, one count of
attempted kidnapping and one mis
demeanor count of annoying a
child.
These charges come as a result of
two separate incidents last April. In
one instance, he allegedly posed as a

police officer and ordered a 13-
year-old to get into his car and un
dress. In another case, he is accused
of stopping two boys and ordering
them into his car.
"Clearly, the most serious
charges he faces are in San Francis
co," said Deputy District Attorney
Cameron Bowman to the Mercury
News.
Bowman also told the Mercury
News that he agreed to the plea bar
gain because there were problems
with the case that was dropped.
Nonetheless, he said, the families
and victims in each case were satis
fied with the result.
In his four years at Stanford,
Abranis amassed more points than
any other player in history. He
played in the Senior Bowl in 19%
and in high school was selected

Player of the Year by Parade maga
zine.
But his accomplishments were
marred in February 19% when the
Daily reported that he was under in
vestigation for posing as a Stanford
football recruiter and soliciting
nude photos of high school students.
In that case, Abrams pleaded no
contest to seven counts of phone ha
rassment, a misdemeanor. He was
sentenced to three years probation,
100 hours of community service and
a $200 fine.
Abrams will bt sentenced in
February. He could be released as
early as April 1999 because of good
behavior and time already served.
At that point, he will face the
charges in San Francisco County.
He has been in custody at Santa
Clara County Jail since April 1998.
