# THE 						FINAL FOUR2
## Feeling just like one of the boys? 
### 
RICHMOND. Va. When I
learned that I was going to travel
across the country to watch the soc
cer team buttle \ irginia. I couldn't
have been more excited. An all-ex
penses paid trip w> Ihe bast ( oast
\Vh;il more could I ask for?

As Ihr logistics o| the trip began
to lall int<> place however, my Ceel
ings became ;i little more mixed
Buying a single plane ticket to Vir
ginia, ordered less than a week in ad
vance. would cost the Daily SIKIH)
I "his meant I would have to travel
with the soccer team
I lie men 's s< >eeei team.
Not only was I going to be the
only gill on the trip, but il the boys
won the first weekend. I was going to
stay in Virginia with the team
through the week, as the final l our
was in Richmond the following
weekend. I'hat week, however, was
finals back on the I arm.
I hus. there was the potential that

I'd be the only girl on a trip for 10
days and have to take my four finals
via fax with the team in various hotels
in Virginia.
Many would have been jealous —
talk about a guy-to-girl ratio. And,
taking finals from a hotel, how nice
compared to Annenberg. Hut I was a
bit more skeptical.
I Jncertain of what lay ahead. I
boarded the bus at Arrillaga with the
team and set off on the adventure.
Mv first hint of the gender differ
ence was the amount of luggage
everyone brought. Most of the guys
(with the exception of a few high
maintenance SAE's) had packed
only one moderately si/ed Nike bag
with everything they needed for the
trip.
My relatively large duffel bag. on
the other hand, was stuffed with
warm sweaters, all my school books
and course readers, and Mademoi
selle and Cosmo which my room
mate gave me in case I became over
whelmed by testosterone.
We checked into our first hotel
Thursday night, and preparation
began for Sunday's game.
I here had been omens all week
end pointing towards Stanford — for
example, the Virginia state bird was
none other than the Cardinal. When
the game was said and done, nearly
4.(KK) Virginia fans left Klockner Sta

ilium stunned at Stanford's 3-0
spanking of the Cavaliers. I was
thrilled, however, and embraced the
fact that I had another week in soc
cer-world.
As the trip wore on, 1 began to ap
preciate the difficulty of being a stu
dent athlete — traveling and training
is much more time-consuming than 1
had imagined. While I sat in my hotel
room and studied (what's a little
Sportscenter to help me focus), the
boys were training, running, having
team meetings, and getting their in
juries treated.
And I can't forget all the time
spent eating. I had been warned that
road trips consisted of eating, sleep
ing and playing soccer but I had no
idea how much time was devoted to
consuming food. Serving 25 people
in a restaurant takes time. Breakfast
usually lasted from 10 to 11, dinner
from 4:30 to 6:30 and a late snack
from 9 to 11.
Add the five hours of eating to the
two hours of training, as well an hour
of preparation and travel time to and
from the field, and you have already
consumed eight hours of the day. If
the hour or so spent in team meetings
each day is added, that only leaves
about five waking hours spread
throughout the day to study for (and
complete) take home finals.
The days that finals were actually

administered were much more in
tense academically, and the hotel's
dining room / lounge became the
Stanford study room. In fact, my
mom called to talk to me and joking
ly asked the receptionist if the Stan
ford soccer team was a rowdy bunch.
"No! They are always down here
studying," was the reply.
While outsiders may have been
impressed with the academic intensi
ty, I also was astonished at how pro
ductive and efficient these athletes
had learned to become in their busy
schedule (although their study
breaks were slightly more frequent
than mine.)
And through it all. the team also
had to focus on the trip's mission —
to play for a national championship.
Many of the guys credited finals as a
good distraction from the nerves, but
the soccer title also was an unavoid
able distraction of its own.
All said and done, I learned two
main lessons on this journey.
First. I gained a new respect for
Stanford athletes, as it is much more
difficult and time consuming than I
ever realized.
Second, men are from Mars.

Jennifer Splansky wants to thank the
fellas for being great all season long.
And, the 12 Days of Christmas defi
nitely lived up to the hype.
