# Farm development meeting draws 150
## Citizens gather to discuss University land use before Santa Clara Commission 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
More than 150 concerned local
citizens attended a Santa Clara
County Planning Commission
meeting Dec. 3 in Palo Alto on Stan
ford's land use regulations and
pending development.
Stanford officials gave a presen
tation on the regulation of the Uni
versity's land use under its general
use permit, then turned the micro
phone over to 40 individuals and 12
representatives of local govern
ments and organizations who
wished to comment on Stanford's
land use policies.
During the meeting, the planning
commission also approved the Uni
versity's plans for a 6-million-gallon
underground drinking water reser
voir near the corner of Stanford Av
enue and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The general use permit, which
governs Stanford development in
unincorporated Santa Clara Coun
ty, will be revised over the next two
years. The current permit, adopted
in 1989, limits new construction
within the central campus and med
ical school to 2.1(K),3(K) square feet.
After the University's recent
construction of residences such as
Kimball Hall and Lyman Graduate
Residence, and academic buildings
such as Gates Computer Science
and the Science and Engineering
Quad, only 447.000 square feet re
main. The pending construction of a
new Alumni Association building,
new graduate residences and new
science and engineering laboratory
space will use up most of the re
maining quota between now and
when the new permit is approved.
Under the general use permit,
University development within the
central campus and faculty housing
is streamlined, while the University

must get a separate special use per
mit for almost any construction out
side that area, including Sand Hill
Road and the foothills. The Univer
sity is required to submit annual re
ports on campus development to
the county, and recently completed
a major status report required by
the permit.
This holistic approach to Stan
ford's land use by the county has
some local residents upset at the
University's seemingly free hand in
regards to development within the
general permit area.
"Areas that we thought were
going to be developed as parks are
now earmarked for housing," said
Sandra Pearson, a member of the
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders association. The Uni
versity used to have a process for
input by campus residents, but it
doesn't seem to any more, she said.
Addressing the planning com
mission, Menlo Park Mayor Paul
Collacchi alleged that the Universi
ty has no comprehensive plan for
campus development, and that the
permit is inadequate in that it does
not take into account the Universi
ty's development around the shop
ping center within Palo Alto and in
San Mateo County. He advocated a
multi-jurisdictional general use per
mit. and more invasive monitoring
of Stanford development.
Stanford officials counter that
the University has done an excellent
job of long-range land use planning
and soliciting community input.
"The permit has allowed Stan
ford to keep facilities up to date,
while also maintaining vast open
space," said Larry Horton. Univer
sity director of community and gov
ernment relations, to the commis
sion.
Almost two-thirds of the Univer
sity's 8,2(X) acres are completely un

developed.
"All of our projects are reviewed
by the county," Horton said later. "I
don't believe anybody does more
outreach than Stanford," he contin
ued, referring to the 21 public hear
ings held on the Sand Hill Road pro
ject before its approval.
David Neuman, University ar
chitect and director of planning, told
the commission that Stanford's
planning and development under
the current permit has worked well.
"Stanford has had a [develop
ment] plan for 110 years," he said,
referring to the original plans for the
University by noted architect Fred
erick Law Olmsted and succeeding
plans. Currently, the University is
working with a 30-year land use plan
adopted in 1980, he said. He also
discussed Stanford's development
mitigation, such as the Marguerite
shuttle and man-made tiger sala
mander breeding ponds in the
foothills.
Stanford officials also noted that
on-campus construction of resi
dences for graduate students that
now commute from off campus will
decrease traffic congestion in sur
rounding cities. Some local resi
dents have feared the opposite.
County Supervisor Joe Simitian
took the long view.
"The level of attention to Stan
ford's land use has increased due to
the Sand Hill approval and the
three-phase [graduate] housing
plan on the heels of it."he said.
"The existing process has focused
on limiting impacts rather than spe
cific developments on campus â€”
that doesn't mean that there isn't
some other way to regulate" if that
is deemed necessary.
Simitian acknowledged an inher
ent contradiction within the de
mands of some of Stanford's critics.
"Some say, 'Tell me where we're re

ally going' in regulating the Univer
sity with a general permit, but at the
same time want specific develop
ment plans," he said. "These are le
gitimate goals that compete with
each other."
The fact that Stanford lands
stretch over city and county lines
also makes long-range planning and
permitting difficult, Simitian noted.
This was the first in what is likely
to be a long series of public hearings
on the revision of the general use
permit. Stanford will submit the
next annual report to the planning
commission on Jan. 15, and subse
quently begin an ongoing series of
meetings with county planners on
the new permit.
Earlier in the evening, the plan
ning commission approved con
struction of a new drinking water
reservoir for the Stanford water sys
tem. The underground, seismically
stable reservoir will increase Stan
ford's water storage capacity from
14 hours to three days at maximum
use, important in case of a major
earthquake. In addition, the loca
tion of the reservoir in the foothills
will allow gravity to push the water
through the system, rather than
electric pumps.
The commission granted a spe
cial use permit under the terms of
the current land use policy, as the
construction is outside of the central
campus.
No one spoke against the project,
but some said that the University
needs to be held to its commitment
that the water is purely for increased
storage capacity for existing build
ings.
"We don't want to be here in a
few years when Stanford wants to
build houses, and they say, 'Look,
here's the water supply,'" said
Thomas Jordan of the Committee
for Green Foothills.

This was the first in what is likely
to be a long series of public hearings
on the revision of the general use
permit. Stanford will submit the
next annual report to the planning
commission on Jan. 15, and subse
quently begin an ongoing series of
meetings with county planners on
the new permit.
Earlier in the evening, the plan
ning commission approved con
struction of a new drinking water
reservoir for the Stanford water sys
tem. The underground, seismically
stable reservoir will increase Stan
ford's water storage capacity from
14 hours to three days at maximum
use, important in case of a major
earthquake. In addition, the loca
tion of the reservoir in the foothills
will allow gravity to push the water
through the system, rather than
electric pumps.
The commission granted a spe
cial use permit under the terms of
the current land use policy, as the
construction is outside of the central
campus.
No one spoke against the project,
but some said that the University
needs to be held to its commitment
that the water is purely for increased
storage capacity for existing build
ings.
"We don't want to be here in a
few years when Stanford wants to
build houses, and they say, 'Look,
here's the water supply,'" said
Thomas Jordan of the Committee
for Green Foothills.
More than 150 concerned local
citizens attended a Santa Clara
County Planning Commission
meeting Dec. 3 in Palo Alto on Stan
ford's land use regulations and
pending development.
Stanford officials gave a presen
tation on the regulation of the Uni
versity's land use under its general
use permit, then turned the micro
phone over to 40 individuals and 12
representatives of local govern
ments and organizations who
wished to comment on Stanford's
land use policies.
During the meeting, the planning
commission also approved the Uni
versity's plans for a 6-million-gallon
underground drinking water reser
voir near the corner of Stanford Av
enue and Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The general use permit, which
governs Stanford development in
unincorporated Santa Clara Coun
ty, will be revised over the next two
years. The current permit, adopted
in 1989, limits new construction
within the central campus and med
ical school to 2.1(K),3(K) square feet.
After the University's recent
construction of residences such as
Kimball Hall and Lyman Graduate
Residence, and academic buildings
such as Gates Computer Science
and the Science and Engineering
Quad, only 447.000 square feet re
main. The pending construction of a
new Alumni Association building,
new graduate residences and new
science and engineering laboratory
space will use up most of the re
maining quota between now and
when the new permit is approved.
Under the general use permit,
University development within the
central campus and faculty housing
is streamlined, while the University

must get a separate special use per
mit for almost any construction out
side that area, including Sand Hill
Road and the foothills. The Univer
sity is required to submit annual re
ports on campus development to
the county, and recently completed
a major status report required by
the permit.
This holistic approach to Stan
ford's land use by the county has
some local residents upset at the
University's seemingly free hand in
regards to development within the
general permit area.
"Areas that we thought were
going to be developed as parks are
now earmarked for housing," said
Sandra Pearson, a member of the
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders association. The Uni
versity used to have a process for
input by campus residents, but it
doesn't seem to any more, she said.
Addressing the planning com
mission, Menlo Park Mayor Paul
Collacchi alleged that the Universi
ty has no comprehensive plan for
campus development, and that the
permit is inadequate in that it does
not take into account the Universi
ty's development around the shop
ping center within Palo Alto and in
San Mateo County. He advocated a
multi-jurisdictional general use per
mit. and more invasive monitoring
of Stanford development.
Stanford officials counter that
the University has done an excellent
job of long-range land use planning
and soliciting community input.
"The permit has allowed Stan
ford to keep facilities up to date,
while also maintaining vast open
space," said Larry Horton. Univer
sity director of community and gov
ernment relations, to the commis
sion.
Almost two-thirds of the Univer
sity's 8,2(X) acres are completely un

developed.
"All of our projects are reviewed
by the county," Horton said later. "I
don't believe anybody does more
outreach than Stanford," he contin
ued, referring to the 21 public hear
ings held on the Sand Hill Road pro
ject before its approval.
David Neuman, University ar
chitect and director of planning, told
the commission that Stanford's
planning and development under
the current permit has worked well.
"Stanford has had a [develop
ment] plan for 110 years," he said,
referring to the original plans for the
University by noted architect Fred
erick Law Olmsted and succeeding
plans. Currently, the University is
working with a 30-year land use plan
adopted in 1980, he said. He also
discussed Stanford's development
mitigation, such as the Marguerite
shuttle and man-made tiger sala
mander breeding ponds in the
foothills.
Stanford officials also noted that
on-campus construction of resi
dences for graduate students that
now commute from off campus will
decrease traffic congestion in sur
rounding cities. Some local resi
dents have feared the opposite.
County Supervisor Joe Simitian
took the long view.
"The level of attention to Stan
ford's land use has increased due to
the Sand Hill approval and the
three-phase [graduate] housing
plan on the heels of it."he said.
"The existing process has focused
on limiting impacts rather than spe
cific developments on campus â€”
that doesn't mean that there isn't
some other way to regulate" if that
is deemed necessary.
Simitian acknowledged an inher
ent contradiction within the de
mands of some of Stanford's critics.
"Some say, 'Tell me where we're re

ally going' in regulating the Univer
sity with a general permit, but at the
same time want specific develop
ment plans," he said. "These are le
gitimate goals that compete with
each other."
The fact that Stanford lands
stretch over city and county lines
also makes long-range planning and
permitting difficult, Simitian noted.
This was the first in what is likely
to be a long series of public hearings
on the revision of the general use
permit. Stanford will submit the
next annual report to the planning
commission on Jan. 15, and subse
quently begin an ongoing series of
