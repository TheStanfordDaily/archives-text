## Indiana derails Cinderella season

RICHMOND, Va. — The men's
soccer National Championship
game was a tale of two programs.
On one bench sat Stanford (18-5-
2). led by head coach Bobby Clark in
his third season on the Farm. Reach
ing Richmond was the culmination
of three years of commitment and
sacrifice for the Cardinal, and the
last hurrah for seven seniors in their
Stanford uniforms. This was Stan
ford's first ever trip to the Final
Four. In 83 previous seasons Stan
ford had never won a postseason

match.
On the other side of the field,
eyeing the trophy, sat Indiana (23-
2). Returning to Richmond was a
burning desire for the Hoosiers,
which after an undefeated IIW7l l W7 cam
paign. lost a crushing 1 -0 triple-over
time semifinal match to eventual
champion UCLA. Indiana had been
the country's most dominant team
for the past two years, with a 45-3
record, and was looking for its 50th
playoff victory. Head coach Jerry
Yeagley had led his teams to three
national titles, eight championship
