# Soccer, water polo brush with titles
## Indiana derails Cinderella season 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
RICHMOND, Va. — The men's
soccer National Championship
game was a tale of two programs.
On one bench sat Stanford (18-5-
2). led by head coach Bobby Clark in
his third season on the Farm. Reach
ing Richmond was the culmination
of three years of commitment and
sacrifice for the Cardinal, and the
last hurrah for seven seniors in their
Stanford uniforms. This was Stan
ford's first ever trip to the Final
Four. In 83 previous seasons Stan
ford had never won a postseason

match.
On the other side of the field,
eyeing the trophy, sat Indiana (23-
2). Returning to Richmond was a
burning desire for the Hoosiers,
which after an undefeated IIW7l l W7 cam
paign. lost a crushing 1 -0 triple-over
time semifinal match to eventual
champion UCLA. Indiana had been
the country's most dominant team
for the past two years, with a 45-3
record, and was looking for its 50th
playoff victory. Head coach Jerry
Yeagley had led his teams to three
national titles, eight championship

games and 12 Final Four appear
ances over the past 26 seasons.
And he led them to another title
again last month.
It was the experienced Indiana
program that emerged with a 3-1 vic
tory in the 1998 NCAA Champi
onship and rid itself of the haunting
memories of last season.
"We exorcised some demons for
sure," Yeagley said after the game.
"To come back this year and get the
job done really makes this special."
Bobby Clark could only praise
both his team and the Hoosiers after
the game.
"It is fun to be on the field with a
team like Indiana and to be able to
play with them. Our boys deserve a
lot of credit," he said. Indiana "is a
first-class team. They might have
been destined to win it."
And although the scoreboard
read 3-1 at the end, the game was ex
citing from the kickoff.
In the game's seventh minute, ju
nior forward Dema Kovalenko put
the Hoosiers up 1-0, lifting a cross

from junior forward Aleksey Korol
into the upper right corner of the
goal.
The play began after a late whis
tle gave Indiana a free kick 40 yards
out. The kick went to Korol, who
passed it to Kovalenko, who bril
liantly one-touched the ball from
outside the circle into the net.
"Their goal was on their first shot
of the game," Bobby Clark said.
" That is the sign of a great team —
guys that have a chance and stick it in
the back of the net. The game swings
on goals."
Yeagley agreed that scoring first
was key to Indiana's victory.
"That goal was crucial because
we really weren't into a rhythm,"
Yeagley said. "I thought from the
start of the match that Stanford actu
ally had us back on our heels at
times. Getting that goal at the time
was crucial for our confidence and
getting us into our flow."
He also praised the shot of Ko
valenko, maintaining that it was not
a fluke.
"We see that goal scored by [Ko
valenko] in practice all the time.
That was not a lucky goal. He has a
surgical precision touch," Yeagley

said.
The Hoosiers were able to extend
their lead less than 15 minutes later.
Kovalenko sent a brilliant cross to
Korol, who was able to pull redshirt
sophomore goalie Adam Zapala off
his line. Korol slipped the ball to
Lavrinenko who tapped it in from
close range for the goal.
Stanford worked its way back
into the game as it narrowed the
margin to 2-1 in the 21st minute.
Sophomore forward Corey Wool
folk, trying to create a shot, was
dragged down in the box by sopho
more defender Nick Garcia. The
Cardinal was awarded a penalty kick
as a result.
Senior Simon Elliott, taking the
kick, led the goalie to guess right,
and then drilled the shot into the op
posite bottom corner. The penalty
kick was Stanford's first of the sea
son.
Despite being down 2-1, the Car
dinal remained positive about its
play.
"When they came off at the TV
timeout, one of the players said,
'Guys, we are playing well, let's not
panic.' Those are exactly the words I
was going to say to them," Bobby

Clark said. "We played well through
the whole game. It was just a day
when we conceded goals."

MEN'S SOCCER
■ Dec. 13: NCAA Championship —
Indiana (23-2) 3, Stanford (18-5-2) 1.

Just before halftime. Stanford
gave up its final goal, which proved
to be deadly. Sophomore forward
Matt Fundenberger misfired a shot
from the top of the box, but the ball
deflected right to Korol. Zapala was
on line to play Fundenberger's shot
and thus Korol easily converted the
misfire into a goal. The Hoosiers
trotted to the clubhouse with a 3-1
lead.
"That was the bad goal for us to
lose," Bobby Clark said. "That was
the goal that killed us. It made it an
uphill task."
But, with the tenacity and disci
pline the team has demonstrated all
season, the Cardinal fought through
until the final whistle.
"I was really proud of our guys. A
lot of teams would have folded los
ing goals at the vital times we lost
goals," Bobby Clark said. "I thought
it was great the way we kept our

selves in the game for the first half. I
felt we controlled big parts of the
game in the second half. "
Stanford's best scoring opportu
nity in the second half came on an in
direct kick just outside the box. Se
nior midfielder Shan Gaw passed
the ball to the right of the wall of In
diana defenders to a streaking El
liott who crossed the ball in front of
the goal. The Hoosiers, however,
beat all Stanford players to the ball,
and headed it just wide of the goal
and out of play.
Indiana goalie T.J. Hanning re
ceived a few lucky breaks as two
other Cardinal shots skidded
through his legs, but neither man
aged to cross the goal line.
The four goals in the game was a
surprising amount, as Indiana and
Stanford entered the game with the
first- and third-ranked defenses, re
spectively.
Stanford had not allowed three
goals all season, and had conceded
two goals only three times. The cold,
rainy and windy conditions may
have played a role, but the Cardinal
refused to let that be an excuse.
"It is a national championship
game. You are not going to not play

because its cold or wet," said fresh
man defender Lee Morrison. "To be
here we had to go through some ad
versity and [the weather] was just an
other challenge that was thrown in
our face."
The last time Stanford and Indi
ana had met was during the 1997
season when the Hoosiers were
ranked No. 1 and the Cardinal No. 2.
The final score of that match was 2-
1, in Indiana's favor, but Stanford's
play was not nearly as strong as the
1998 game.
"I didn't feel we contributed to
the game last year," Bobby Clark
said. "I really felt we were very much
in today's game. It takes two teams
to make it a great game. One team
doesn't do it. I thought we were very
much in today's game."
Even with Stanford contributing
more in 1998's battle, the day be
longed to Indiana, which took care
of its unfinished business.
"This is one of the finest college
soccer teams I've coached," Yeagley
said. "The thing I like most about
them is that they have a passion for
the game, play a beautiful game and
they take great pride in playing a
beautiful, entertaining game."
