MEW'S SOCCER
■ Dec. II: NCAA Semifinals
Stanford I, Maryland (16-8) 0.

But Bobby Clark also admitted
that luck docs not rise out of the
blue.
"You create your luck."
In the two games leading up to the
championship match, the Cardinal
calmly pressured its opponent and
forced mistakes that led to Stan
lord's success and an opportunity to
play lor the national title.
In the semifinal against Maryland
on Dec. 11. Stanford scored late in
the first half and was able to fend off
the Terrapins' pressure to hang on to
the victory.
I he game's only goal came com
pliments of freshman defender Lee
Morrison in the game's 40th minute.
As has become his trademark, Mor
rison used his head to put the Cardi
nal on top.
Junior defender Andy Hem
merich sent a long throw-in from
deep in Maryland territory into a mix
of players to begin the play. Morri

son, who had come forward out of his
defensive position, leapt above the
crowd and headed a shot which was
headed back out by Terrapin fresh
man defender Beckett Hollenbach.
Situated at the opposite corner of
the goal box, Morrison quickly re
covered and again out-leapt his de
fender. This time, he lofted the re
bound off his head to the far post
where it deflected off the metal, back
into Hollenbach and into the goal.
"We will take any goal we can
get," Bobby ('lark said.
But the young Terrapins, who
start four freshmen and three sopho
mores, refused to go down quietly.
Maryland's vicious attack forced
Stanford to look uneasy and unset
tled throughout the second half.
The Terrapins appeared to have
equalized 10 minutes into the second
half as Hollenbach headed a ball past
Stanford redshirt sophomore goalie
Adam Zapala. The goal was called
off, however, as Zapala was pushed
out of position and fouled by Mary
land senior Pierre Venditti on the
play.
"That was a long second half. We
are real fortunate," Bobby Clark
added. "Maryland did a super job of
taking us out of our game in the sec
ond half. They gave us more prob
lems than any other team this sea
son."
While Stanford had a difficult
time piecing together much offense
for the remainder of the game, the
defense did a formidable job putting
out the Terrapins' offensive fire.
Morrison and senior defender Jamie
Clark were immense all game in not
allowing a Maryland goal.
"A lot of that result comes from
the tremendous performance of the
central defenders," Bobby Clark

said of Morrison and Jamie Clark.
Morrison was occupied all game
with Maryland's national freshman
of the year Taylor Twellman. The
forward, who entered the game with
16 goals, was silenced by Morrison's
stellar defense all game long.
The Twellman-Morrison match
up was particularly intense as the two
are teammates on the U.S. Under-20
national team.
"Whenever we play head on, it
makes you play that much harder,"
Morrison said. "But, the team de
serves a lot of credit. We did the dirty
work as a team."
While the victory against Mary
land did not come easily, Stanford
put together its most complete game
of the season against Virginia one
week before to advance to the Final
Four.
The host Cavaliers entered the
game as the tournament's second
seed and overwhelming favorite.
Virginia lost to UCLA in the 1997
national championship game, and
had advanced to the Final Four six
times in the '90s.
Stanford, however, did not allow
itself to be intimidated.
"The team had a tremendous
amount of respect for the Virginia
soccer program, but we felt comfort
able coming into that situation," said
senior forward Adam Siegman. "We
did not see ourselves as underdogs. I
think we were confident with that re
spect."
Good fortune continued to fall
Stanford's way as the Cardinal
scored the first goal of the game. The
play began at the mid field as a Cava
lier threw the ball in straight to the
feet of Stanford redshirt junior mid
fielder T.K. Inbody.
Inbody subsequently passed the

ball to Siegman who dribbled 30
yards through the Virginia defense
before firing a shot on goal from the
top right of the box. Siegman aimed
for the shot at the left corner, but the
ball deflected off Virginia's fresh
man defender Marshall Leonard's
leg and ended up in the bottom right
corner of the goal.
Clark stressed the importance of
scoring the first goal in setting the
tone of the match.
"We forced them to change their
style of play," Clark said. "If you
force a team to change its style, you
are winning the game."
Virginia did manage 13 shots and
Zapala made a career-high eight
saves to hand Virginia its first shut
out loss at home since 1995.
With the game still at 1-0, howev
er, Zapala provided a key save to
protect the Cardinal's lead.
Challenging a Virginia attack at
the top of the box, Zapala cleared
the ball, but it went right to a Cava
lier. A second shot ensued and Za
pala dove to his right while retreating
towards the goal to punch out the fol
low up shot.
"The save was key, but at the
same time, that's my job," Zapala
said. "You don't want the home
team to equalize because then mo
mentum shifts."
While keeping the tempo on its
side, the Cardinal capitalized on an
other Cavalier mistake to extend the
lead to 2-0 in the 75th minute of the
game.
Stanford senior forward A.J.
Sauer intercepted a Virginia pass
deep in Cavalier territory with three
defenders between himself and the
goal. Sauer held his composure and
passed the ball to a streaking Elliott,
who struck the ball perfectly into the

right corner from 18 yards out.
Less than two minutes later. El
liott added an insurance goal with a
brilliant shot from 25 yards out into
the top left corner of the net. The
goal caused frustrated Cavalier fans
to get up and leave while the game

was still in progress.
"Stanford took it to us," said Vir
ginia head coach George Gelno
vatch. "They made us feel uncom
fortable out there and we just didn't
handle it very well. They executed
their game plan perfectly."
