# Gaw gives his all and keeps winning the ball
## 
### Jennifer Splansky Senior staff writer 
RICHMOND. Va. — "110 percent
in everything."
Lor anyone who has watched
Shan (law on the soccer field, this
motto should come as no surprise.
"That means on the field and off

the field," the senior explained. "It
means to go above and beyond what
is expected and go above and beyond
what I think I can do. I think when
you go above and beyond the call of
duty in whatever you do, whether it
be writing a paper or mowing the
lawn, it carries over and becomes a
regular thing."

This personal philosophy has dri
ven all aspects of Gaw's life, and for
tunately for the Stanford soccer team,
it has particularly driven his play on
the field.
Gaw is one of the Cardinal's un
sung heroes. 1 le does not lead Stan
lord in scoring goals. He is not the
leading assist man, nor does he take

the ball upfield with fancy footwork.
"1 am the sitting midfielder," Gaw
laughed. "I don't have the most glam
orous job. I do some of the dirty
work."
But (iaw certainly does more than
"sit" on the field.
Gaw wins balls.
This season, he frustrated oppo
nents by shutting down some of the
top midfielders in the country, in
cluding C'reighton's Richard Mul
rooney, St. John's Stefani Miglioranzi
and Virginia's Jason Moore.
Stanford head coach Bobby Clark
understands the importance of Gaw's
contributions.
"Shan could be one of the hardest
players to replace next year because I
don't think we appreciate the ability
he has to win the ball in the midfield,"
Clark said.
Gaw has settled into this role for
the Cardinal the past two years after
playing a more offensive position his
first two seasons. But in the spring of
Ciaw's second season, it was Clark
who helped him realize this talent of
winning balls.
"After [the 19%] season, I re
member asking Shan, 'What do you
think you are good at?' And he said
i'm good on the ball, good technical
ly. good at passing.'" Clark said.
"I then said. What do you think
you are best at?' And he gave that
blank stare, and 1 said, 'What you are
best at is winning the ball.' 1 think he
suddenly realized I am brilliant at
this.'"
This strength on the field comes as
no surprise to those who know Gaw's
personality.
"Shan is one of the most stubborn
guys in the business. You can't domi

nate him. It is a tremendous trait,"
Clark explains.
Gaw articulates this trait as his
tenacity.
"1 hate to lose," he bluntly admits.
"I hate to lose both games and indi
vidual battles."
And while Gaw is the epitome of
intensity on the field, his role in the
clubhouse is quite different.
"1 guess I am a joker," he explains.
"I like to have fun in the locker room,
joking and laughing, but when there
is something serious, I will say it."
Clark stresses that this quiet lead
ership is one of Gaw's main contribu
tions to the team.
"He is a leader on and off the field.
He doesn't say much, but if Shan
does, everyone listens. He doesn't al
ways say it with words. Sometimes it
is the way he acts. But he isn't scared
to stand up for what he thinks is im
portant. He is very much a leader."
As a fifth-year senior, Gaw's expe
rience has naturally contributed to
this leadership role.
The fifth-year status is a result of a
medical redshirt during his first year
on the Farm. In his very first practice
during the preseason of his freshman
year in 1994, Gaw went down with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament. He
was sidelined for four months and did
not see time in a game until the fol
lowing year. Thea during 1996.
Clark's first season, Gaw was side
lined for another month with a
sprained medial cruciate ligament —
this time in his other knee.
Redshirting his true freshman
year gave Gaw an extra year of eligi
bility. And though frustrating at the
time, perhaps everything happens for
a reason, as Gaw was then able to

train under Clark for three years and
play a huge role in Stanford's 1998
playoff run.
Gaw, however, was brought to
Stanford before the Clark era.
He met Colin Lindores, Stan
ford's head coach before Clark, at a
West Coast Olympic Development
Camp in the summer before his se
nior year in high school. Playing in
ODP was the first time (law began to
receive national attention, and also
became the first time he considered
playing soccer in college.
"I wasn't even planning on going
to college to play soccer. I was just
going to go and study," Gaw said.
But the national camps attracted
the attention of colleges, and Stan
ford University, not Stanford soccer,
won the prize.
"None of the other schools had
the Stanford appeal," Gaw ex
plained. "It might not have been the
best soccer school, but its Stanford."
But Gaw has played a crucial role
in the turnaround of the Stanford soc
cer program.
Last season he was voted team
MVP by his teammates and was
named to the second team NSCAA
Far West Region All-America team.
This season lie received All-MPSF
second team honors.
And now that his Stanford soccer
career is over, the product design
major is not sure what lies ahead.
"I haven't really thought about it.
I have no idea how the whole [Major
League Soccer] thing works really."
Gaw admits. "But if someone wants
me, I'd play for them.
"But, it is a weird thought that I
might just hang up my boots and
never play again."

Stanford head coach Bobby Clark
understands the importance of Gaw's
contributions.
"Shan could be one of the hardest
players to replace next year because I
don't think we appreciate the ability
he has to win the ball in the midfield,"
Clark said.
Gaw has settled into this role for
the Cardinal the past two years after
playing a more offensive position his
first two seasons. But in the spring of
Ciaw's second season, it was Clark
who helped him realize this talent of
winning balls.
"After [the 19%] season, I re
member asking Shan, 'What do you
think you are good at?' And he said
i'm good on the ball, good technical
ly. good at passing.'" Clark said.
"I then said. What do you think
you are best at?' And he gave that
blank stare, and 1 said, 'What you are
best at is winning the ball.' 1 think he
suddenly realized I am brilliant at
this.'"
This strength on the field comes as
no surprise to those who know Gaw's
personality.
"Shan is one of the most stubborn
guys in the business. You can't domi

nate him. It is a tremendous trait,"
Clark explains.
Gaw articulates this trait as his
tenacity.
"1 hate to lose," he bluntly admits.
"I hate to lose both games and indi
vidual battles."
And while Gaw is the epitome of
intensity on the field, his role in the
clubhouse is quite different.
"1 guess I am a joker," he explains.
"I like to have fun in the locker room,
joking and laughing, but when there
is something serious, I will say it."
Clark stresses that this quiet lead
ership is one of Gaw's main contribu
tions to the team.
"He is a leader on and off the field.
He doesn't say much, but if Shan
does, everyone listens. He doesn't al
ways say it with words. Sometimes it
is the way he acts. But he isn't scared
to stand up for what he thinks is im
portant. He is very much a leader."
As a fifth-year senior, Gaw's expe
rience has naturally contributed to
this leadership role.
The fifth-year status is a result of a
medical redshirt during his first year
on the Farm. In his very first practice
during the preseason of his freshman
year in 1994, Gaw went down with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament. He
was sidelined for four months and did
not see time in a game until the fol
lowing year. Thea during 1996.
Clark's first season, Gaw was side
lined for another month with a
sprained medial cruciate ligament —
this time in his other knee.
Redshirting his true freshman
year gave Gaw an extra year of eligi
bility. And though frustrating at the
time, perhaps everything happens for
a reason, as Gaw was then able to

train under Clark for three years and
play a huge role in Stanford's 1998
playoff run.
Gaw, however, was brought to
Stanford before the Clark era.
He met Colin Lindores, Stan
ford's head coach before Clark, at a
West Coast Olympic Development
Camp in the summer before his se
nior year in high school. Playing in
ODP was the first time (law began to
receive national attention, and also
became the first time he considered
playing soccer in college.
"I wasn't even planning on going
to college to play soccer. I was just
going to go and study," Gaw said.
But the national camps attracted
the attention of colleges, and Stan
ford University, not Stanford soccer,
won the prize.
"None of the other schools had
the Stanford appeal," Gaw ex
plained. "It might not have been the
best soccer school, but its Stanford."
But Gaw has played a crucial role
in the turnaround of the Stanford soc
cer program.
Last season he was voted team
MVP by his teammates and was
named to the second team NSCAA
Far West Region All-America team.
This season lie received All-MPSF
second team honors.
And now that his Stanford soccer
career is over, the product design
major is not sure what lies ahead.
"I haven't really thought about it.
I have no idea how the whole [Major
League Soccer] thing works really."
Gaw admits. "But if someone wants
me, I'd play for them.
"But, it is a weird thought that I
might just hang up my boots and
never play again."
