Theophile Bra's first biographers saw him as an individual who differed in
every respect from his peers and contemporaries. "The Drawing Speaks:
Theophile Bra Works 1826-1855" presents Bra's less well known works,
including his drawing of abstract compositions that explore mystical and
social discourses. In these works, which were kept secret during his lifetime,
Bra successfully returned the medium of drawing to a "pure," non-figurative
state that denies a Western artistic culture of illusionistic drawing recreating
the visible world. The 48 astonishing works that comprise this exhibition have
been selected for their exploration of the hieroglyph as an inscription of the
sacred, a creative impulse unparalleled in the nineteenth century. Admission
is $6, $4 for students. The exhibit is at the Berkeley Art Museum (open
Wednesday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.),
located ai 2626 Bancroft Way, Berkeley; call (510) 642-0808 for information.
