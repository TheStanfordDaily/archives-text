## 'Straight No Chaser' does not disappoint SCBN's new show 
### Josh Robin Contributing writer 
It was a fitting setting for the screening of SCBNs comedy series, "Straight No
Chaser." A Coors keg stood at the entranceway of the Kappa Sigma fraternity
house where the screening was held. The company was raucous and the
damp, ratty seat I sat on reeked of puke. (This, thank you, was something I found
out after I sat down.) And when the police came to investigate an unrelated inci
dent, the director told the actress 1 was interviewing (a member of the Class of
2002) to put away her beer. College life below glossy catalogues and e-mails home
was the thread through most of "Straight No Chaser," the entirely student-run
show that debuted Nov. 16 in a funny preview to what is slated to be a year-long
series on SCBN.
Perhaps the screening at Kappa Sig was appropriate because the fraternity
house is the major location for the new series. Several members of the cast, includ
ing the shows creators and writers, seniors Jonathan Bobb and Rob Windom, are
fraternity members. Set in a fictitious coed social house (replete with shared bath
rooms), the show stars five students — four seniors and a junior — and jumps
from scene to scene to make fun of one collegiate quirk after another. The list was
mostly expected: The girl you hooked up with last night (forgetting her name as
she says "Hi" to you on the street), scamming at the gym, checking in the mirror
to see if your butt obscenely obtrudes (both sexes), frat party dancing and, of
course, drinking.
"Chaser" 's television version of college life isn't so original (except maybe the
shared bathrooms), but most of the well-written execution had me laughing.
Much was do to the acting of a well-scripted, animated performance by junior

Mike Karns, who played the confident, if know-it-all Parker. Philosophizing on his
grand plans for play, Parker is always just a little too meticulous to get any.
Especially funny was when he ruminated on how his vaguely defined "mack
vision" would score him a hook-up: "With mack vision, you're in the zone. There's
no question. It's just a matter of time."
Clearly the other actors have talent and experience, but their characters' devel
opment was limited in scenes that ran more like vignettes without many links,
especially for the two actresses, senior Lara Johnson (Malia) and freshman Ellyn
Ruschak (Sarah). Johnson, a Ram's Head veteran, was especially funny as she
fruitlessly endeavored to remove a curling brush from her hair as Dave Matthews'
"Stay" psyched her up for her evening plans. The show would benefit from her
deeper involvement. The same holds for Ruschak, who hosted Pittsburgh cable
shows during high school.
With the limited amount of time devoted to production, filming and especial
ly editing, the "Straight No Chaser" premiere was impressive. Shot mostly within
one Sunday and then edited over a weekend, the cuts are virtually flawless, the
sound was fine and the angles professional. That mostly had to do with the talent
of director Matt Brutocao, a freshman, but already an accomplished director and
self-taught editor who already has an hour-long movie under his direction.
Econ major Bobb and Windom, who is majoring in political science and also
an aspiring screenwriter, clearly enjoy the project, even the grueling story devel
opment process. The two of them also play off each other humorously enough to
warrant a show on their own lives. They plan on releasing three to four episodes
this winter and then showing a run of seven spring quarter, adding continuity to
the stories. In the meantime, they brainstorm in the Coffee House and in frat par
ties, scouting for more examples of the underside of college life.
