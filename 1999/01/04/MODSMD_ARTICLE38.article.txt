# Burnouts, beerguts 'n' greasy combs
## It's a Psychobilly festival!

Betty Page, stand up and show us your tits! And
would you mind suckling a pig held in one arm, waving
a bottle of moonshine in the other hand, and riding
down a mountain of skulls while straddling a flaming
upright bass? The psychobilly festival held Nov. 7 and 8
at the Transmission Theater and Paradise Lounge host
ed an international sampling of artists - tattoo artists,
hair stylists (cheap cut/.!), and connoisseurs of fine red
neck kitsch, as well as the bands.
As I walked into the Transmission Theater on the sec
ond night of the celebrations, the Unlucky Boys, here all
the way from Utah, were already into their set. I was
immediately reminded of a skate and punk show 1
attended some years ago — same bad sound quality and
a sparse audience. What I realized immediately follow
ing was that I wasn't showing nearly enough cleavage.
But then, I excused my way past the leopard print tops
and worn overalls on my way to the stage to get a better
look at the music. Decorated basses, decorated coifs,

and inked skin.
The 12 bands taking their turns on the three stages
displayed a number of variations on the combination of
rockabilly, punk, bluegrass, country and honky-tonk
that "typifies" the psychobilly genre. The Unlucky Boys
interjected pointed political denunciations in between
songs with take-charge, speedy basslines and shimmer
ing guitar chords. The Blazing Haleys from Santa
Barbara offered a greater variety of sound and cowboy
hats. Hailing from San Diego, the Verdicts were content
to distract the pie-eyed with thrashy electric guitar and
an occasional but prolonged display of the bassist's ass.
The evening was at its rowdiest when the Barnyard
Bailers, also hailing from San Diego, took the main
stage. As the set opener highlighted the benefits of anal
sex (as shouted by a pink-mohawked vocalist), the
moshing and the hoe-down (?) began in earnest. A
steady stream of beer, liquor and catcalls continued
throughout, and the set ended with on-stage crowd par
ticipation in a Mad Sin cover. L.A.-based band Pearl
Harbor followed and dared to break with the church of
the upright with its electric bass, led by a big-haired

female vocalist to boot. By this time I'd incorporated
much of the googly-eyed mentality and couldn't help
but notice, aside from a '60s glimmer and car obsession,
the singer had a great rack. The Phantom Rockers, vet
erans of the scene hailing from England closed the fes
tival as co-headliners.
Psychobilly is a fusion of distinctive styles glorifying
the gods of John Deere and American beer, or whatever
strikes the twisted fancy. Is it brash musical innovation
coupled with a unique social perspective and extreme
imagery, or the undisguised, and really unattractive cir
cle jerk of a sad group of adolescent misfits and aging
punks? The compilation CD release, "Hotter Than
Hell," from Hairball 8 Records that coincided with the
festival allows a better appreciation of the music. Once
the ringing in my ears decreased to a soothing hum, lis
tening to the CD provided a clearer view of
psychobilly — fun and insane music that may shock the
more reserved, but mostly gets toes a-tappin' and may
spark a new desire to upholster the family car with pink
and black zebra striped velvet. Besides, who doesn't like
breasts? I love 'em!
