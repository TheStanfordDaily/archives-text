# Movie Review & Interview
## A 						successful 'Plan' Life's a bitch when you're rich 
### 
What is it about money that turns people into
killers? We've seen the story before in some
form or fashion: A group discovers a large
sum of money and sooner or later their greed results in
murder and mayhem. Steve Buscemi and Peter
Stormare go nuts killing state troopers and millionaires
for ransom money in "Fargo," for example, and Ewan
McGregor turns on his friends over the contents of a
briefcase in "Shallow Grave."
In "A Simple Plan," a new film directed by Sam Raimi
(best known for writing and directing the "Evil Dead"
series), we get an interesting twist on the "money make"

murder theme: The killers are good people — really
good people.
Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) is your normal
Minnesotan small-town loe who works at a feed store.
His wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), is a sweet woman with
a baby on the way. Hank's brother, Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton), is a goofy guy with a big heart.
Everything is nice and cheery until Hank, Jacob and
a friend of Jacob's named Lou (Brent Briscoe) stumble
across a wrecked airplane in the snowy woods on New
Year's Eve. Inside they find a bag containing $4.5 mil
lion.

The dimwitted Jacob and Lou figure the money is
dirty and naturally want to keep it. Hank reluctantly
agrees, giv ing the condition that they not spend it until
a few months go by and they are absolutely sure that no
one will claim it.
When Hank reveals the secret to Sarah, she insists
that he return some of the money to the plane so it
won't look looted. A farmer named Tom Butler (Jack
Walsh) sees Hank walking in the woods, and wouldn't
you know it, Jacob mortally wounds him. Lou runs
short on money and begs to get his cut a bit early, and
when the police find the plane, they start asking ques
tions. Hank has to do the unspeakable in order to keep
the money a secret, and the situation keeps worsening.
Moviegoers might instantly think of "Fargo" when
they see this film, especially because it is set in the win
try Midwest. But while "Fargo" is a dark comedy loaded
with melodrama, "A Simple Plan" is a more realistic
drama that deals with people's moral conflicts. We care
about the actions of Hank, Sarah and Jacob, because
they make us question our own actions and beliefs. And
because we sympathize with the characters so much, all
it takes are a handful of Scott Smith's plot twists to build
up some of the most intense scenes that I've ever seen in
a movie.
Raimi's direction in "A Simple Plan" is top-notch.
While we can see the "Evil Dead" and "Darkman" influ
ences in the more violent scenes, the bulk of this movie
is unlike anything he's ever done. He's done a terrific job
of softening the camera around Hank and company,
keeping the feel of an innocent family even in the thick
of death and conflict. Now I'm looking forward to
Raimi's next film — a baseball movie starring Kevin
Costner. "A Simple Plan" is rounded out nicely by the
all-star cast. Thornton is most notable as Jacob; he gives
just the right charm to an otherwise unlikable character.
"A Simple Plan" has got it all — a great story that
keeps the audience thrilled, great acting and great direc
tion. It's even got a creepy score by Danny Elfman, one
of my favorite composers. This is the perfect movie for
chilling up the holiday season.
