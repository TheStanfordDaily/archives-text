# Last-second shot in OT sinks polo
## 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
NEWPORT. Calif. — It was every
thing a national championship
game should be. The score was tied
four times during the match. The
game ended in an intense two-peri
od overtime battle. The top two
teams in the country played their
hearts out for the NCAA title. It
was the kind of game Stanford fans
have come to expect from Cardinal
squads.
But this time, the Stanford men's
water polo team (21-7) had to settle
for the silver.
In front of a standing-room-only
crowd of 2,385 at Corona del Mar

High School in Southern Califor
nia. the No. 2 Cardinal fell to the
top-ranked USC Trojans, 9-8.
"It's too bad it had to end this
way," said Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "But we got the
opportunity to play in the final
game of the national champi
onships [and] the guys really played
their hearts out."
"We were well prepared, we
played hard and we gave it all we
had," said junior Sean Joy.
Both teams came out strong de
fensively in the first quarter and the
game remained scoreless until the
last 0:37 of the period, when USC's
James Castle put one past Stanford
goalie Chris Aguilera.
Things didn't look good for the
Cardinal when USC took a 3-0 lead
just 2:17 into the second period. But
Stanford wasn't about to give up.
Goals from senior Arturo Rodelo
and junior Sean Joy closed USC's
lead to 4-2 at hall time.

"We've been making great come
backs all year," said Stanford assis
tant coach Ben Quittner. "But it's
tough to come back [from a 3-0
deficit] and get ahead."
Senior Lavne Beaubien, who led

Stanford in scoring, continued the
comeback in the third quarter.
Beaubien notched two goals to tie
things up at four apiece while the
Cardinal defense managed to shut
down the USC attack and hold the
Trojans scoreless for the entire peri
od.
"Layne played a great offensive
game," Quittner said. "And it was a
complete team effort to come back."
The battle heated up in the last
period of regulation when USC
again took the lead in the first 0:35.
Beaubien answered back for the
Cardinal and tied the score at five.
At 3:13, the Trojans took the lead
again and managed to hold onto the
game until Stanford junior Andy
Walburger scored the last goal in
regulation play at 1:13.
For the third time in four games,
Stanford took the match into over
time.
"It's amazing that we had three
overtime games in the last four
(games) and we won two of them,"
Dettamanti said. "I think we play

best when we're behind."
In the first three-minute overtime
period, USC took the lead early,
only to have Walburger tie it up once
again.
Stanford finally took the lead in
the second overtime period when ju
nior Sean Joy put a shot past USC
goalie Rich McEvoy.
"Sean Joy was the MVP of the
game for me," Quittner said. "He
was fired up and went all out."
And it looked as if Joy's goal
would give the Cardinal the victory.
"I really thought that was it, that
was the clincher," Joy said. "I
thought the momentum [we had]
would have been it."
But on a man-up advantage, USC
star Marko Pintaric scored a two
pointer to put his team ahead 9-8.
Up to that point, the Stanford de
fense had managed to keep Pintaric
scoreless.
"We talked about pressing [Pin
taric] the whole game," Quittner

said. "We only gave him one oppor
tunity and he put a two-pointer in."
Junior "Brian Heifferon did a
great job stopping Pintaric," Detta
manti said. "It took a great effort by
| Pintaric] to score that goal (but] we
definitely made mistakes. We can't
afford any mistakes and we can't af
ford to get in 6-on-5 situations with
USC."
The Stanford squad fought back

and came within inches of tying the
game, but when the final buzzer
sounded, the Trojans had won their
first ever men's water polo national
title.
"We had a great season and it
would have been nice to put the icing
on the cake," Quittner said. "But
you've got to remember that some
teams would kill just to be here."
Stanford defeated UC-San
Diego 6-3 in the NCAA semifinal
round for the right to fight it out with
USC for the national title.
Aguilera was named Most Valu

able Defensive Player, along with

This was Stanford's fifth NCAA .
second-place finish. The Cardinal
has captured the title eight times in
the past.
"We had a really great year,"
Dettamanti said. "We overcame a
lot of adversity and we have a lot to
be proud of."
