# A 						not-so-'Simple' story
## An interview with screenwriter Scott B. Smith 
### Rito Treviño Senior staff writer 
When Scott B. Smith found out that he was being interviewed by someone
from The Stanford Daily, his wife couldn't help but tease him. You see,
Smith's application was rejected from Stanford — three times.
Born in New Jersey and raised in Ohio, Smith grew to see the Farm as the antithesis to
the nearby East Coast institutions that he was urged to attend.
"It was a romantic idea," Smith told Intermission during a brief phone chat."I grew
naively obsessed with Stanford."
Smith applied to be an undergraduate, a graduate student and even a Stegner Fellow
in Stanford's Creative Writing Program, but he never made it to the Farm. Fortunately,
Smith found out that one doesn't need a Stanford degree to be a successful writer.
Smith received his master's in fiction writing at Columbia University in New York City.
At Columbia, he took a screenwriting course that gave him the inspiration for his first
book. He wrote a scene in which a Midwestern couple is killed violently in their home by
their own friends.
"A year later, I wrote a novel to explain that scene," Smith said. "I can't remember exact
ly how the plane, the money and the characters arrived into the story."
With all of his plot elements in place, Smith churned out a page-turner entitled "A
Simple Plan." His first novel met immediate success, selling 100,000 copies during its first
hardback publishing. A movie deal was quickly put in place by producer / director Mike
Nichols ("Primary Colors") and Paramount. Smith was asked to write the screenplay, but

with the class at Columbia as his only screenwriting experience, he was unsure of his abil
ity. He turned to the original director of the film, Ben Stiller.
"I made the first-time screenwriter's mistake of thinking of the script as only dia
logue," Smith explained. "[Ben] emphasized a more visual screenplay, more verbal
descriptions of what the camera sees." Stiller eventually left the project, and Smith had to
make a series of changes to his script in order to cater to a number of directors and pro
ducers. Eventually the film settled in the hands of Sam Raimi. According to Smith, Raimi
kept the mood of the film simple, quiet and bleak.
Although the film version of "A Simple Plan" stays true to the book in its basic plot,
Smith pointed out son e crucial changes that he made as he wrote and rewrote. For exam
ple, one of the characters who dies in the middle of the book is kept alive until the end of
the movie. Also, an extensive plot twist involving a convenience store was entirely cut out.
In the end, Smith is happy with the film. He mentioned his new favorite scene, in
which Jacob Mitchell asks his brother Hank whether he feels evil. "The way they shot it,
they created a mood [that was unexpected]," Smith said. "The sense of brotherhood
between Jacob and Hank is lost in the book and the screenplay. Here, it was created
entirely through the actors and the director."
While Smith said that he is still tormented by his rejection from Stanford, he hasn't
abandoned the idea of a Northern California lifestyle. He and his wife live in Berkeley,
where he's been working on another novel. Smith noted that the new book will include
many intertwined stories and will be much more complicated narratively than his first
book. Given the number of twists and turns in "A Simple Plan," that should be quite a
doozy.
