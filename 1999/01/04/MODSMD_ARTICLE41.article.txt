## When Dream Works was in 'Egypt' 's land The 						top talent of The Prince of Egypt' speaks, and we listen 
### Sharon Armstrong Editorial staff 
A few months ago, a publicist handling Dream Works pub
licity for the Bay Area called up Intermission and asked if
anyone would be interested in doing a round-table interview
with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the guru of feature animation, and
the producer, director, art director and head music man for
Dream Works' first animated feature, "The Prince of Egypt."
"Do you think you can make it?" she asked me. "Are you
KIDDING?!" I almost screamed, "I'm skipping class for
this!" So with visions of animation industry grandeur danc
ing in my head, off I went to meet, talk and shake hands (I
touched them! I touched them!) with some of the most tal
ented animation artists in the country. Present, and in
alphabetical order, were: Kathy Altieri, art director, Brenda
Chapman, director, Penny Finkelman Cox, producer, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, executive producer, and Lenny Waronker, head
of Dream Works music. Here's what they had to say:
Round Table: Brenda, did you set out to be the first
woman director of an animated film?
Brenda Chapman: It just kind of worked that way. I've
always been the only girl amongst a bunch of guys in my
department for many years, so I got lucky.
RT: You've taken a big mantle on your shoulders —
this is Dream Works' first animated production, so how
do you follow it up?
BC: By retiring. I don't know, I'm waiting.
Jeffrey Katzenberg: By doing a bigger one. When I look
at the movie myself, I think boy, this movie has incredible
heart. And I think that the fact that women were in a posi
tion of leadership on this movie and the choices that they
made along the way [shows]. Over the years when I've
made a movie with her, Brenda was always the heart.
Anytime you needed to go for "make me care," she was the
"make me care" person.
RT: What is the difference between working on a
Dream Works animated feature versus working on a
Disney animated feature?
JK: Well, everything and nothing. I think there are a
number of things. First, I have to start by saying that 10
years of working on these movies at Disney was a privilege,
and everything I know about animation I learned there,
and it's where I fell in love with it. But there is a very spe
cific Disney story, Disney genre and a Disney style. And I
don't think anyone in the world can touch them at doing
what it is they do.
The goal in starting an animation company at
Dream Works was to try to head out on a completely dif
ferent path and find a story that is unlike any story they'd
tell, to have it be something that isn't a fairy tale, to have a
look and a style to it that would be different and new and

unique. And that's part of these artists' man
date: Let's go reinvent the wheel. Let's make
choices along the way, whether it's literally in
the style of the characters themselves, the way
in which they were designed, the painterly
style of the movie, the realism of the anima
tion — these are all things by choice meant to
head out on a new path. I think that certainly
all of us would say that Walt Disney was an
inspiration, but we really have all sort of
jumped off of a cliff.
RT: Can you talk about the hieroglyphic
dream sequence?
JK: Dave Morehead designed the technolo
gy to make it possible. The use of technology
in this film is in virtually every frame. There
are 1,192 sequences; 1,180 of them have digital

effects. The collision between traditional animation tech
nique and tools and the acting and painting that our ani
mators do were then married together into digital tools
into a three-dimensional environment.
We had to make the camera literally fly into and
through sequences the way Steven Spielberg does in his
live action. That's never been available to animation
before. It makes the look of it different, and it makes the
audience feel different, because you're not just outside
observing or just moving through on one plane — you
actually get to go into a scene and move around in it. It
helps create realism. That hieroglyph nightmare sequence,
which was an inspirational idea out of one of our artists,
took an equal amount of inspiration out of one of our
technologists to create the tools to do something that's
never been done before.
RT: How did you discover Ralph Fiennes [the voice of
the character Rameses] could sing?
BC: We asked him, and he said he'd like to try.
JK: He wasn't a singer. He'd sung in the bathtub. But he
felt more secure about his singing in the bathtub than I do.
Penny Finkelman Cox: He can really hit it. He took a
lot of training.
RT: You approached a bunch of religious scholars to get
their takes on what you wanted to do. Did you ever think
it would backfire? Were you ever concerned that you
would push it too far and not please anybody because you
were trying to please everybody?
JK: No, because of the generosity and the integrity of
those people we invited to come into our office. There
were almost 700 Egyptologists, archaeologists, biblical
experts, scholars, theologians, clergy, religious leaders
from virtually every faith, from around the globe. You have

to understand that our mandate,
that we agreed on for ourselves up
front, was that we wanted to tell the
story faithfully and accurately in a
context 3,000 years ago.
When we invited people to come
in and critique [the film] because
of their knowledge and
expertise — because none of us are
experts in any of these areas — and
when we told them what our man
date was, there was not one single
time that somebody politicized our
process. Therefore, there wasn't
one time that we felt as though our
integrity as storytellers, and the
freedom we need as storytellers,
ever was in conflict with the criti
cisms that we were getting. For
example — and we had dozens of

things like this, that I think add to the credibility of the
work — the Midian sequence, when Moses marries
Tzipporah. During the wedding ceremony, there was a shot
in which Moses steps on pottery, which we know as sym
bolic of marriage. But actually, that is symbolically and
historically meant to remind us of the destruction of tho
first temple. The first temple didn't get built for anothei
1,000 years. So it was an anachronism, and one of the
scholars pointed it out to us. And they helped us make a
better movie.
RT: You mentioned "Lawrence of Arabia" and that you
looked towards David Lean [director of "Lawrence of
Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago," among others] for inspira
tion. Is Dream Works headed towards making big, epic,
landscape films, or would you consider making some
thing more intimate?
JK: I hope that we do not fall into making Bible stories
for the rest of our lives. Having made this and being proud
of it, the next movie we have coming out is fairly irrever
ent. It's a story called "El Dorado." It takes place in 1500,
[and it's] about two losers, a dreamer and a schemer, who
jump onto Cortez's boat as stowaways, get washed away
overboard in the new world, and ride into El Dorado on
the back of a horse, and they're believed to be gods. And
it's pretty funny. One guy's looking for gold, and the
other's looking for a golden opportunity. The problem is,
they have to give up their friendship in order to get their
dream. And ultimately they realize that their friendship is
worth more than the gold or the glory. Kind of a fun story,
but not a fairy tale, and not "Prince of Egypt."
RT: There are three albums with really great music.
What were you thinking?
Lenny Waronker: It was probably a year and a month
ago when we had a Dream Works retreat. Once we got a
sense of what the film was, what it meant, we had a dis
cussion. The dream was to hear music from "Prince of
Egypt" in every way possible. And we, being the bullshit
artists that we are, said, "Sure, don't worry, we'll get it
done." So that meant country, pop, R & B, gospel, etc.
The idea of reaching out to different genres and musical
communities was based on the conversations we had that
night. The idea of three records and four different versions
of one song all came out of that. For us, three albums
seemed like a lot, but in feeling the film, seeing it close, that
dream became much more of a reality to us. We were lucky
in having wonderful executives — James Stroud in charge
of the Nashville division and Jheryl Busby in charge of the
urban division. So we had the manpower and the brain
power to come up with a wishlist of artists.

those people we invited to come into our office. There
were almost 700 Egyptologists, archaeologists, biblical
experts, scholars, theologians, clergy, religious leaders
from virtually every faith, from around the globe. You have

to understand that our mandate,
that we agreed on for ourselves up
front, was that we wanted to tell the
story faithfully and accurately in a
context 3,000 years ago.
When we invited people to come
in and critique [the film] because
of their knowledge and
expertise — because none of us are
experts in any of these areas — and
when we told them what our man
date was, there was not one single
time that somebody politicized our
process. Therefore, there wasn't
one time that we felt as though our
integrity as storytellers, and the
freedom we need as storytellers,
ever was in conflict with the criti
cisms that we were getting. For
example — and we had dozens of

things like this, that I think add to the credibility of the
work — the Midian sequence, when Moses marries
Tzipporah. During the wedding ceremony, there was a shot
in which Moses steps on pottery, which we know as sym
bolic of marriage. But actually, that is symbolically and
historically meant to remind us of the destruction of tho
first temple. The first temple didn't get built for anothei
1,000 years. So it was an anachronism, and one of the
scholars pointed it out to us. And they helped us make a
better movie.
RT: You mentioned "Lawrence of Arabia" and that you
looked towards David Lean [director of "Lawrence of
Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago," among others] for inspira
tion. Is Dream Works headed towards making big, epic,
landscape films, or would you consider making some
thing more intimate?
JK: I hope that we do not fall into making Bible stories
for the rest of our lives. Having made this and being proud
of it, the next movie we have coming out is fairly irrever
ent. It's a story called "El Dorado." It takes place in 1500,
[and it's] about two losers, a dreamer and a schemer, who
jump onto Cortez's boat as stowaways, get washed away
overboard in the new world, and ride into El Dorado on
the back of a horse, and they're believed to be gods. And
it's pretty funny. One guy's looking for gold, and the
other's looking for a golden opportunity. The problem is,
they have to give up their friendship in order to get their
dream. And ultimately they realize that their friendship is
worth more than the gold or the glory. Kind of a fun story,
but not a fairy tale, and not "Prince of Egypt."
RT: There are three albums with really great music.
What were you thinking?
Lenny Waronker: It was probably a year and a month
ago when we had a Dream Works retreat. Once we got a
sense of what the film was, what it meant, we had a dis
cussion. The dream was to hear music from "Prince of
Egypt" in every way possible. And we, being the bullshit
artists that we are, said, "Sure, don't worry, we'll get it
done." So that meant country, pop, R & B, gospel, etc.
The idea of reaching out to different genres and musical
communities was based on the conversations we had that
night. The idea of three records and four different versions
of one song all came out of that. For us, three albums
seemed like a lot, but in feeling the film, seeing it close, that
dream became much more of a reality to us. We were lucky
in having wonderful executives — James Stroud in charge
of the Nashville division and Jheryl Busby in charge of the
urban division. So we had the manpower and the brain
power to come up with a wishlist of artists.

B.C. boys will be boys.
A few months ago, a publicist handling Dream Works pub
licity for the Bay Area called up Intermission and asked if
anyone would be interested in doing a round-table interview
with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the guru of feature animation, and
the producer, director, art director and head music man for
Dream Works' first animated feature, "The Prince of Egypt."
"Do you think you can make it?" she asked me. "Are you
KIDDING?!" I almost screamed, "I'm skipping class for
this!" So with visions of animation industry grandeur danc
ing in my head, off I went to meet, talk and shake hands (I
touched them! I touched them!) with some of the most tal
ented animation artists in the country. Present, and in
alphabetical order, were: Kathy Altieri, art director, Brenda
Chapman, director, Penny Finkelman Cox, producer, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, executive producer, and Lenny Waronker, head
of Dream Works music. Here's what they had to say:
Round Table: Brenda, did you set out to be the first
woman director of an animated film?
Brenda Chapman: It just kind of worked that way. I've
always been the only girl amongst a bunch of guys in my
department for many years, so I got lucky.
RT: You've taken a big mantle on your shoulders —
this is Dream Works' first animated production, so how
do you follow it up?
BC: By retiring. I don't know, I'm waiting.
Jeffrey Katzenberg: By doing a bigger one. When I look
at the movie myself, I think boy, this movie has incredible
heart. And I think that the fact that women were in a posi
tion of leadership on this movie and the choices that they
made along the way [shows]. Over the years when I've
made a movie with her, Brenda was always the heart.
Anytime you needed to go for "make me care," she was the
"make me care" person.
RT: What is the difference between working on a
Dream Works animated feature versus working on a
Disney animated feature?
JK: Well, everything and nothing. I think there are a
number of things. First, I have to start by saying that 10
years of working on these movies at Disney was a privilege,
and everything I know about animation I learned there,
and it's where I fell in love with it. But there is a very spe
cific Disney story, Disney genre and a Disney style. And I
don't think anyone in the world can touch them at doing
what it is they do.
The goal in starting an animation company at
Dream Works was to try to head out on a completely dif
ferent path and find a story that is unlike any story they'd
tell, to have it be something that isn't a fairy tale, to have a
look and a style to it that would be different and new and

unique. And that's part of these artists' man
date: Let's go reinvent the wheel. Let's make
choices along the way, whether it's literally in
the style of the characters themselves, the way
in which they were designed, the painterly
style of the movie, the realism of the anima
tion — these are all things by choice meant to
head out on a new path. I think that certainly
all of us would say that Walt Disney was an
inspiration, but we really have all sort of
jumped off of a cliff.
RT: Can you talk about the hieroglyphic
dream sequence?
JK: Dave Morehead designed the technolo
gy to make it possible. The use of technology
in this film is in virtually every frame. There
are 1,192 sequences; 1,180 of them have digital

effects. The collision between traditional animation tech
nique and tools and the acting and painting that our ani
mators do were then married together into digital tools
into a three-dimensional environment.
We had to make the camera literally fly into and
through sequences the way Steven Spielberg does in his
live action. That's never been available to animation
before. It makes the look of it different, and it makes the
audience feel different, because you're not just outside
observing or just moving through on one plane — you
actually get to go into a scene and move around in it. It
helps create realism. That hieroglyph nightmare sequence,
which was an inspirational idea out of one of our artists,
took an equal amount of inspiration out of one of our
technologists to create the tools to do something that's
never been done before.
RT: How did you discover Ralph Fiennes [the voice of
the character Rameses] could sing?
BC: We asked him, and he said he'd like to try.
JK: He wasn't a singer. He'd sung in the bathtub. But he
felt more secure about his singing in the bathtub than I do.
Penny Finkelman Cox: He can really hit it. He took a
lot of training.
RT: You approached a bunch of religious scholars to get
their takes on what you wanted to do. Did you ever think
it would backfire? Were you ever concerned that you
would push it too far and not please anybody because you
were trying to please everybody?
JK: No, because of the generosity and the integrity of
those people we invited to come into our office. There
were almost 700 Egyptologists, archaeologists, biblical
experts, scholars, theologians, clergy, religious leaders
from virtually every faith, from around the globe. You have
