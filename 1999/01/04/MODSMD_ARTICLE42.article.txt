# Someday their 'Prince' will come
## Moses supposes his toeses are roses

lust when you thought all the fresh, original ideas had been taken — a talking pig,
bootie-shaking bugs, a hunka-hunka burning love as death, the Star Wars trail
er (!) — along comes "The Prince of Egypt," Moses A la Dream Works animation.
l know what you're thinking — what about Charlton Heston in"The Ten
Commandments"? What about the cartoons on the religious network? What about
Disney? Weren't they around first? Weren't they innovators? Don't they get gold stars
and some brownie points?
Yes, yes, of course they do. But "Prince" needs to stand alone in its own right. It's not
every day that a studio stands up to Disney full-throttle or produces a film worthy of
being considered with the best of this exalted category.
Most people know the story of Moses, but then again, most people knew the story of
"The Little Mermaid" and weren't expecting singing fish when that came out, so bear
with me for a moment.
The film opens with baby Moses' mother Yocheved, brother Aaron (Jeff Goldblum)
and sister Miriam (Sandra Bullock), all slaves, racing through the streets of Goshen in
order to save the baby from the infanticide imposed on all Hebrew newborns by Seti
(Patrick Stewart). Setting Moses into a floating basket, Yocheved sings the film's most
touching and memorable song to him, a sweet, simple Hebrew lullaby.
At the end of the river, the basket floats into the imposing white temple of the

Pharaoh's palace, where the Queen (Helen Mirren), with the young king-to-be Rameses
(Ralph Fiennes) at her side, discovers the baby and adopts him on the spot.
The two boys grow up as brothers, competitive, reckless and totally endeared to one
another. Rameses, the boy who would be pharaoh, is constantly scolded by his father
about his lackluster conduct; Moses is the intermediary between the two. There is no
jealousy between the two, and their lives together are idyllic.
One evening, Moses encounters Miriam in the street and learns his true identity.
That night, back at the palace, Moses has a terrible nightmare recounting the truth
about the massacre of the Hebrew infants. In one of the film's technologically magical
moments, the entire dream sequence is told through moving hieroglyphs on the wall of
a temple. The two-dimensional animation of the wall drawings creates a striking con
trast with the three-dimensional look of the rest of the animation.
Fleeing the palace, Moses enters the desert, where over a period of years he marries,
herds sheep and lives peacefully. It is not until he sees the burning bush and is sum
moned by God that he is convinced of his mission and returns to Egypt to free his peo
ple.
There are many ways in which "Prince of Egypt" disrupts the tried and true Disney
formula — fairy tale, moral message, happy ending — a formula that has worked with
great success for the mouse empire. "Prince" is noticeably lacking in the big happy pro
duction numbers ("Be Our Guest" and "Under the Sea," come to mind) and the fairy
tale morality play quality that has made Disney productions the family films for the
past decade. While there are singing holy men (played by Martin Short and Steve
Martin, no less), it's hard to make jokes about the Nile being turned into blood by God's
decree.
The difference is refreshing, but it honestly leaves just a smidgen of something to be
desired. I couldn't help but feel that the jokes couldn't shake the looming cloud of slav
ery, oppression and biblical doom under which they were made. And excuse me, but I
kind of missed the fancy-schmancy production number.
Still, I'd like to see animation branch out from the rut (a glorious, magical rut, but
still a rut) that it has fallen into in the United States. The technological innovation of
"Prince," not only in the creativity of the hieroglyph nightmare scene but in the breath
takingly clear parting-of-the-Red-Sea scene and throughout the film, proves that ani
mation is an increasingly perfectible format for showing what movies can do.
Dream Works has compromised the fairy-tale rubric of the past with this film, and I can
only think that that's a good thing.
