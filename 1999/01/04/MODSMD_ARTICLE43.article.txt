# 'Prince of Egypt'
## The
						Soundtracks 
### Stan Karas Editorial staff 
What is "inspirational music"? I personally reach
something approaching religious ecstasy when
listening to Bryan Ferry's "Slave to Love" or
Frank Sinatra's version of "Angel Eyes." Someone else may
get his rocks off on Pearl lam, a band of self-important
mediocrities that I cannot stomach. The more spiritually
inclined among us may reach their nirvana plateaus lis
tening to New Age music, which I can only compare to the
turbulent workings of an unhinged water closet. The
question is, however, who will enjoy the batch of "Prince
of Egypt" soundtracks, all implicitly "inspirational," one
explicitly so.
There are few stories in the Bible of such inherent dra
matic power as the one of Moses and his long and wind
ing trip to the Promised Land. It is really too bad that the
makers of the new animated "Prince of Egypt" chose to
highlight the story with a score that is so patently banal
and drowsy as to make one long for a sound bite of
Charlton Heston's self-assured bass to spice things up.
First the good news: The score is truer to the story's geo
graphical circumstances than the movie, and is a good
deal more ethnically flavored. The bad news is that much
of this music sounds like a poor imitation of sounds that
can be heard over the sound systems in second-rate ethnic
restaurants, and features more "lai-lai-lai" choruses then
your local bar mitzvah.
The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, also unsurpris
ingly makes use of maudlin violins and flutes to portray
the plight of the Jews, as well as booming bassoons and
crashing cymbals to symbolize the ungodly power of the

evil Pharaoh. While the filmmakers were gracious enough
to use the marvelous Israeli singer Ofra Haza on a few
tracks, her formidable talents are squandered on puny
Broadway-style tunes. The much heralded diva duet
between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston is not too
bad, but it does make one nostalgic for the days when
divas were named Judy, Patsy and Ella. Finally, the sound
track also features vocal efforts by Steve Martin, Ralph
Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer that rank with William
Shatner's best.
The Nashville soundtrack album is marginally better,
perhaps because it does not try so hard to equate bombast
with spiritual importance. While the album features a
number of tracks where vocal pyrotechnics are supposed
to highlight the power of the story of Genesis, the more
important ingredient here is simple Christian faith. Yet,
since in the Aesopian language of pop music, love for
Christ can easily be seen as a love for that special girl or
boy, or (for the gadflies among us) love for your pick-up
truck, the Nashville sountrack comes across as more secu
lar than its two companions.
There is an impressive array of country superstars on
this album, including Clint Black, Vince Gill and Faith
Hill. Yet, this selection is hopelessly middle-of-the-road.
There is more feral religious passion in any one of Johnny
Cash's Christian recordings than in this entire album.
While certainly not exploring the entire spectrum of
country music's complicated relationship with God and
religion, the deliciously titled "Prince of Egypt Nashville"
features a number of stand-out tracks. Wynonna's throaty
"Freedom" is an impressive opener, Mindy McCready's
"Walk in Glory" is both funky and spiritual, while Alison
Krauss delivers a wispy but poignant performance on "I

Give You to His Heart".
But wait â€” there's more. The folks at Dream Works also
give us a "Prince of Egypt Inspirational" album which tries
to combine the contributions by the more spiritually
inclined R & B stars with those of Christian rockers, pep
pering the whole concoction with some banal choral
interludes. While this may be the only album where you
will find Boyz II Men sharing the spotlight with lars of
Clay, the novelty soon wears off, and you are left with an
"inspirational" album that manages to overlook almost
entirely the traditional American spiritual music: gospel.
For a novice, listening to the R & B tracks on the album is
a bit jarring. While the tight backbeats and slinky bass
lines suggest lyrics about doing it real slow between the
sheets (ugh yeah, baybee!) and musings about your loved
one's booty, the lyrics here are strictly God-related.
When the shock wears off, the contributions by the
Winans (Bebe and Cece on separate tracks), Kirk Franklin
and Brian McKnight are easy on the ear and do to some
extent soothe the savage soul. The album's low point is a
song by the mysteriously named Carman, "God Will Take
of Me," which combines insufferable lyrics with astonish
ingly bad music, and leaves one only to hope that God will
not listen to Carman's ardent entreaties. The rest of the
album is hit and miss, the only real highlight being Shirley
Caesar's impassioned track "Moses the Deliverer," which is
head and shoulders above the musical tripe that sur
rounds it.
So, once again, different inspirational strokes for differ
ent folks. I personally recommend Elvis Costello's earth
shattering "God Give Me Strength," but if Carman and dc
Talk are more to your tastes, who am I to judge?
