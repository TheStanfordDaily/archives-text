## A 						'State' of secrecy 'Enemy' puts paranoia to the test 
### 
Tony Scott's "Enemy of the State" is a fast-paced techno-thriller about a
high-tech attempt to cover up a political murder. This film masterfully
combines a smart plot with great actors to tell the gripping story of a soci
ety under constant surveillance. While the film is loud and intense, the action is
an integral part of the film and it never dumbs down the plot.
The story revolves around an attempt by Congress to pass a bill that would
allow the government to spy on any citizen. Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) wants
the bill passed so badly that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. When he
doesn't get much-needed support from a senator, he kills him while making it
look like the senator died of a heart attack. While universal surveillance is not yet
in effect, Reynolds' perfect murder has been caught on tape by a wildlife photog
rapher's hidden camera.
Reynolds, not about to be stopped by a wildlife lover, sets up an operation to
recover the incriminating tape. Attorney Robert Dean (Will Smith) becomes the
subject of the chase when he unknowingly receives a copy of the evidence. From
that moment on, Dean's life starts to fall apart while the National Security Agency
uses all of its high-tech gadgets to track him down.
"Enemy of the State" is such an appealing film because the technology show
cased in it really exists. The paranoia that Dean feels is caused by prying technol
ogy that could potentially be used against anyone for anything. If this film had
been made 15 years ago, the whole plot would have seemed outrageous. Today,
however, the plot may actually fuel conspiracy theories that the government is
watching every move American citizens make.
Fortunately for Dean, he meets Brill (Gene Hackman), an ex-NSA agent who
was forced to leave the agency after an operation went wrong. When someone
close to Brill is killed by the same people who are after Dean, they team up and
decide to fight their enemy with the weapons they capture.
The actors in "Enemy of the State" work together very well. Dean, the clueless
rookie, and Brill, the seasoned professional, form a contrast that is a pleasure to
watch. Voight plays the part of a ruthless, self-centered politician with great
authority. Unfortunately, there are not many scenes where Voight, Hackman and
Smith share the screen. The people surrounding Reynolds are either total nerds
or total jocks, making for some interesting conflicts between brain and muscle.
One of the greatest assets of "Enemy of the State" is its fast-paced and intelli
gent plot. The film is chock-tull of action and suspense as Dean is hunted down
and tracked by satellites. This results in more than one spectacular chase scene.
Even when out of view from the satellites, Dean's motions are still tracked with
every contact he makes with the outside world. The fact that he is simultaneous
ly dodging his pursuers and scheming his revenge makes this film's 129 minutes
into an exhilarating experience.
