# Bright lights, 'Pig' city
## Babe returns in an urban sequel 
### 
When we last left Babe, the intrepid sheep-pig,
he was savoring the sweet taste of victory.
Not only did he prove that you can indeed
send a pig to do a dog's job, he also tore up the assump
tion that nice pigs finish last.
Now Babe is back, this time with a bigger problem
than that of getting respect from the rest of the barn
yard; Farmer Hoggett has hurt himself falling down the
well and the bank wants to foreclose on the farm. What
to do? Off goes Esmc Hoggett — the farmer's missus —
with Babe and the three well versed singing mice to the
big city to make a funded sheep-pig appearance at the
"granddaddy of all state fairs." The result is a film that
tries hard to recapture the original zany charm of
"Babe," but gets too stuck on random references and a
convoluted plot to make much headway in that direc
tion.
In true "Babe" fashion, everything that can go wrong
does. In the cargo hold at the airport, an overzealous
drug-sniffing doggie gives the sounding alarm at Babe's
cage and ends up getting Esme body-searched for ille
gal substances. The delay costi the pair their appear

ance fee. To top it all off, none of the motels will house
Babe and "his human." The spot they finally end up in
is run by an eccentric pair with a motley crew of show
biz chimps, operatic cats and weird canines.
The bulk of the movie passes as a giant mess of a
misunderstanding. After believing Babe to have been
stolen, Esme is arrested by the police for causing a
major public disturbance. Meanwhile, Babe has his own
adventures, including saving the local pit bull bully's
life, becoming the messiah for the underprivileged ani
mal life of the local environs, and saving all non-human
species listed above from the pound.
While there are remnants of the original "Babe,"
much of the rehashing has lost its oomph this time
around. The screeching mice, while still wacky-cute
when they break out in song (look for pieces more
highbrow than the original film's "Blue Moon" rendi
tion), are subjected to the duty of introducing random
sequence-titles such as "Chaos Theory;" all in all, their
appearance was less cheeky and more forced than
before.
Likewise, the set design was striking in its originali

ty. Like the Hoggett Farm, the city has a "Toontown"
look to it, with bulging, colorful buildings, quaint
canals and an all-encompassing skyline — including
the Hollywood sign, the Statue of Liberty and the
Sydney Opera House. But unlike "Babe," full of sun
shiny scenes of farmyard antics, "Babe II" s dark urban
lighting only makes the animal activity (and some of
the animals themselves) downright creepy.
It is always difficult to judge a sequel by the stan
dards set up by its predecessor — especially when that
predecessor was nominated for a best-picture Oscar
and is greeted with cooing whenever its name is
dropped. Originality is next-to-impossible to duplicate,
and innovative concepts are difficult to revive without
dulling the imaginative shine. To put it more bluntly,
not every series of films can be compared to the Star
Wars trilogy — films like these are in a class of their
own. Keep this in mind, and even "Babe II" will bring
some color and joy into a Dead Week. Nice pigs don't
always finish last, even when they don't finish first.
