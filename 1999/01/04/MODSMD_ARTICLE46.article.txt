# Schmuck & Putz
## Bugger this, Disney! 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
Loyal fans of Schmuck and Futz realize that the critics
are strong upholders of modern, politically correct social
values. Friends of the boys know that they never make
inappropriate remarks at the dinner table that alienate,
mock, or demean any gender, race, class, religion or
species. They are a sensitive breed, to say the least. In a
gender-sensitive move, they have added "womyn" to their
computer dictionaries so that "man" does not have to be
a part of "woman." A typical conversation follows:
Schmuck: Putz, have you met that womyn with a "y"?
Putz: No. Indeed I haven't, Schmuck, but I am deeply
offended that you consider her to be a womyn first and
foremost instead of simply an individual with equal
opportunities in our society. It's exactly that sort of sex
ism that feminists like myself have dedicated our lives to
fighting, you chauvinistic pig!
It was with this bitter attitude that Schmuck and Putz
arrived at a local screening in San Jose of Disney's newest
computer animated film, "A Bug's Life." While in the city,

the two stopped over at a local
prison to promote their new cam
paign advocating extensive new
criminal rights. They discussed
their allergic reaction to the second
computer-animated hug movie of
the year, and though the morally
challenged individuals had not seen
the flick, many of them were dis
gusted by what Schmuck and Putz
told them. Here's an excerpt of
their behind-the-bars dialogue:
Putz: 1 am disgusted by films like
"A Bug's Lite" that continue to
degrade and misrepesent the
human condition with glaringly
unforgivable details. I am puzzled
why Disney even bothered to make
this movie, after Dream Works

delivered the beautifully crafted, socially aware, hilarious
film "Antz!"
The scathing plot: When a colony of ants faces the pos
sibility of extinction from a group of grasshoppers (led by
Kevin Spacey), ambitious insect Flick (Dave Foley) sets
out to the city to collect a bunch of large, scary bugs to
wage war. Unfortunately, this group of so-called "heroes"
turns out to be a troupe of circus performers.
First and foremost, Disney presents audiences with an
anatomically inaccurate nudist colony for insects. One
would think that the nudity of all the bugs — male and
female — would give off an aura of equality. But, no! The
female characters in the film receive far more close-ups
on their "regions," shall we say. As if Hollywood didn't
already reduce the role of womyn to mere pin-ups with its
excess shots of T&A.
Furthermore, screenwriters Andrew Stanton, Bob
Shaw and Donald McEnery (three men, I might point
out) mock gender issues with the character of Francis, the
male ladybug, played by Denis Leary. As if womyn didn't
have enough of problems procuring good, meaty roles in
the industry — that don't include prostitution, pornog
raphy or stripping — Disney has to characteristically take
away a part fit for a lady and give it to a man. This makes

me mad!
Schmuck: You are the biggest prick I ever met! You are
a white male. You are the enemy! The more im-portant
issue here is the terrible social neuroses that the movie
promotes, frirst of, the fiat caterpillar. This poor obese
character slowly trudges around and is mocked by his
slim ant friends, so what happens to large males and
females who go see this film? Anorexia, bulimia; fat
women and fat men running into bathrooms all over the
country throwing up and starving themselves. I can only
imagine what this will do to the lucrative popcorn indus
try.
As our little protaganist Flick ventures into the big city,
he is bombarded with filthy streets, overcrowded restau
rants and stupid uneducated insects. Millions of country
folk who see this film will be skewed in their outlook on
big cities. Now when Ma and Pa from Booneyville take
Johnny Jr. to see "A Bug's Life" they'll never realize how
wonderful big cities actually are.
Putz: The filmmakers are even sacreligious with their
foolish characterization of Manny the praying mantis. In
fact, the only redeeming character of the film is Rosie, the
black widow (Bonnie Hunt), As a single insect of color
living in America today, she is impervious to the horrors
of the world that surrounds her.
Schmuclc Speaking of color, why did the cockroaches
have to be green? Green is life, energy, stamina. When I
was little I used to set traps for those little damn cock
roaches as they invaded my kitchen cabinets and ate my
lemon meringue pie. I relished in the pleasure of seeing
them dead, or if they weren't dead squashing their repul
sive heads, as they lay in a terrible state. Shumuck, stay
within the boundaries. Remember what your therapist
tells you: control and channel the anger, control and
channel the anger.
The Bottom Lint:
Putz: These filmmakers should be castrated and
forced to listen to books oh tape by Betty Friedan,
Schmuck: If you realty want a great film, check
