## 'The American' 
### 
Ever since Dylan went electric in 1965, the folk community has trashed its artists for "selling out" by
"pluggin' in." This wrong-headed criticism has unfortunately blurred the lines between the artist
and his or her music; who else besides the singer / songwriter should know what to write and how
to perform? Nonetheless, audiences still feel they have control over the music of "their" artists, and early
success can stunt artists' growth as fans try to trap them in little boxes labelled "folk," "ska," "punk," "rap"
and so on.
Such is the dilemma faced by folk singer / songwriter Martin Sexton, whose austere independent debut,
"Black Sheep," succeeded on the sweetness of his voice and the simple eloquence of his songwriting. His
recently released major-label debut, "The American," was overseen by a mainstream producer Danny
Kortchmar (Billy Joel, Don Henley) and features remakes of tracks from "Black Sheep" as well as new songs.
Sexton, who is used to performing alone, is found here with acoustic and electric guitars, bass, pedal steel,
organ, keyboards, piano, drums, percussion and of course, backup singers. In other words, as Sexton's orig
inal fan base is complaining, Sexton has "sold out" by making a compromised, over-produced album mas
termined by corporate suits looking for an adult-contemporary hit.
Maybe.
And maybe his fans fell in love with his music because they thought he was a "pure" voice unadulterat
ed by the trappings of "commercial" music. Whether the simple instrumentation of Sexton's early work was
a matter of economy or artistic preference has probably never entered their heads.
And maybe Sexton is more of a singer than a songwriter. His astounding voice, which smoothly dances
between delicate beauty and soulful urgency, certainly can distract attention away from his weak material.
On "The American," however, Sexton's voice is not enough to cover for the essential vapidity of his work.
Too often, Sexton tries to be cute ("Diggin' Me") and clever ("Animal Song") instead of beautiful and
sincere. His vocal gifts may be impressive, but no matter how fervently he sings, "I need her as my lover like
I need another hole in my head," ("Candy") the lyrics are still dumb, regardless of (and perhaps because of)
the strange Prince reference.
Further, some of his most soulful moments, such as "Where It Begins" and "Love Keep Us Together," are
painfully undercut by his band's mainstream schmaltz. Elsewhere, promising tracks such as "The Beast In
Me" are ruined by backup singers who are inappropriate enough to be considered insulting.
Nonetheless, the album is effective whenever the music rises to the level of Sexton's vocals. "Glory
Bound" is a nicely assured rocker, "Station Man" is catchy folk, and "My Maria" achieves operatic power.
Still, more than anything else, "The American" proves that having no musical accompaniment besides
one's own guitar is better than hiring studio musicians to play bland, "contemporary" mush to fill in the
gaps. Maybe Martin Sexton's early fans are right after all.
