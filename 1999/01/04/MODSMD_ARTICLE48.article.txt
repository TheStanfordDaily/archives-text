# Paul Oakenfold
## 'Tranceport' 
### 
or British DJ Paul Oakenfold, travel-
H ing around the world and into other
dimensions is just a matter of
"Tranceport"-ation. Oakenfold, a widely
known DJ on Britain's trance club scene,
has made his first American release with
"Tranceport," a non-stop, 74-minute com-

pilation of ambient

rave music.
Although the al
bum is primarily
instrumental with
heavy drums and

bass, Oakenfold also

incorporates vocals
to create a melodic,
unconventional style
of trance music.

Trance music,
which is quickly
gaining momentum
in the United States
after its success in
Europe, originated
in India, and is best
described as vibrant,
ambient rave mu
sic. While trance in

American underground clubs has tradi
tionally been all-instrumental, Oakenfold
introduces vocals in his new American
release. The end result is a complex, kalei
doscopic album that takes listeners on a
journey from one mysterious destination
to the next.
"Tranceport" features 11 lengthy tracks
that come from a wide assortment of
artists, ranging from The Dream Traveler
to Energy 52 to Lost Tribe. This variety
allows Oakenfold to take his listeners on a
journey around the real and surreal world.
"El Nino" and "Cafe Del Mar" are reminis
cent of the Latino club scene, with strong
synthesizer beats and Spanish lyrics. "El
Nino," in particular, contains eerie, threat
ening Spanish lyrics that evoke the
destructive storm. In contrast, the vocals
on "Someone" are reminiscent of Celtic
chants. The track sounds like Enya singing
over a dance beat background. The physi
cal world isn't the only place Oakenfold
explores. On "Time," Oakenfold's use of
sudden crescendos and decrescendos along
with a variety of rhythms gives listeners a
chance to delve into dream-like state. This
dream, however, is filled with contradic
tions. While the track soothes and calms,

the sudden accelerations develop an
atmosphere of anxiety and apprehension.
Despite this eclectic grouping,
Oakenfold creates a pleasant unity among
the tracks. The best way to describe the
album is to say it evolves; each track flows
into the other, making it a non-stop circle
of energy. The smooth transitions between
each track and the complexity of the
album's sound reflect Oakenfold's maturi
ty and wide range of experience. His
remixing experience alone is enough to
create great interest in his newest album.
Besides remixing "Lemon" and
"Mysterious Ways" for U2, he has also
remixed for The Cure, Will Smith,
Salt 'n' Pepa, the Rolling Stones, Snoop
Doggy Dogg and the Smashing Pumpkins.
Oakenfold also runs hi* own record label,
Perfecto, and has toured with Bjork, Happy
Mondays and U2.
Paul Oakenfold can easily be called one
of the most prominent faces in the world's
trance and rave scene. His sound has
exploded across Europe, and soon
American clubs will also echo with his lat
est work.
