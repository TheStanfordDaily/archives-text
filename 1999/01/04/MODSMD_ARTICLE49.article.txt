These days it seems as if everyone m the music business has cut a Christmas
album, and from all appearances, there is nothing original to sing. "N Sync real
izes that it's been done many times, many ways, but couldn't resist composing yet
another Christmas album, "Home for Christmas."
'N Sync is constantly being compared to the Backstreet Boys (yes, there it is, the req
uisite Backstreet Boys reference). Surprisingly, for the most part, the songs on 'N Sync's
Christmas album do not sound oft-repeated. Even the traditional Christmas songs, "The
First Noel,""Merry Christmas" and "Oh Holy Night," have been changed somewhat, and
for that reason sound slightly fresher. The other songs, clich£d as they are, also sound
fairly original. The problem, then, lies in the fact that many of the songs only sound
slightly original when they could sound completely original. In place of identifying the
songs as specific Backstreet Boys songs, you instead identify them as new Backstreet
Boys-style offerings.
Another fault is that the songs are at times distinctly saccharine and banal. This char
acteristic, strange as it sounds, is what makes the group so popular. The fan base of

*N Sync consists mostly of teenage girls and the material on this album seems designed
to appeal to them. For example, the lyrics on "Home for Christmas" include such phras
es as "All I want in this whole wide world for Christmas is you* reminiscent of Mariah
Carey's Christmas album of two years past, as well as, "Let's celebrate the good that lies
in the hearts of everyone" and "Dreams will come true just for me and you." This sac
charine quality only has a place during the Christmas season, when at other times of the
year it would crash and burn. But is there any other way to make a Christmas album?
The album does have its bright spots. "Oh Holy Night" is sung entirely a cappella, and
highlights what the group could accomplish if it would give up the attempt to imitate
other pop all-boy groups. Other songs on "Home for Christmas" have a distinct R & B,
pop, dance or harmonizing quality that makes them enjoyable to listen to. This music is
only for those who like cornyness, can't wait for the holiday season to begin and will
really get into it once it's here — or most importantly, those who admire the musical
ability of the Backstreet Boys.
