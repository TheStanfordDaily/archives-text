# And a Happy New Year!
## Early admits join '03 class 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Contributing writer 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robert Kinnal
ly gave an early Christmas present to 483 high school se
niors last month: acceptance letters to the Class of 2003
under the University's Early Decision program.
Twenty-four percent of the 2,003 students who applied
for early admission this year were accepted; those admits
will comprise roughly 30 percent of the 1,610 student class
Kinnally expects to enroll for the fall of 1999.
This year marks the first round of admissions under the
unified Early Decision program, which no longer includes
a second Early Decision round.
"This is indeed an extraordinarily talented group," Kin
nally said. "We are eager to have them join us at Stanford."
The students accepted thus far come from 38 states and
19 countries. Forty-five percent hail from California.
"Their intellectual curiosity, passion for ideas and is
sues and their fine personal qualities distinguished them
from a pool of exceptionally strong candidates," Kjnnally
added.
The Dec. 14 mailing also included 1,272 letters denying
admittance, or 64 percent of the applicants. Another 248
students, or 12 percent, received letters that indicated that
their files would be deferred for review in the regular pool.
The latter group will join the Regular Review appli
cants who applied under the traditional Dec. 15 applica
tion deadline. The Office of Admissions should release of
ficial application figures for this group later this month.
Kinnally estimates that these numbers will be higher than
last year by at least 200 students.
Last year, a record 18,888 students applied for admis
sion to Stanford. Thirteen percent were admitted, the low
est admittance rate in University history.
Of the 3,172 students who applied early last year, 611, or
19 percent, were admitted, a slight drop from this year's
figures.
Started three years ago, the Early Decision program is
a binding application option for students whose first choice
is Stanford. Around the country,
early admissions programs have be
come an increasingly popular appli
cation option because they end the
application process several months
earlier than regular admission does.
"1 applied early because 1 knew
that I wanted to come here," said
Brad Hunter, a freshman. "More
importantly, though, I was hoping
to find out [before Christmas] so
that I wouldn't have to fill out all of
my other applications."
According to U.S. News and
World Report, many students also
use the early admissions system as a
tactic to gain admission into the na
tion's top universities, because
many schools frequently admit a

higher percentage of the early ad
mission pool than of the regular ad
mission pool.
But, while statistics may show a
slightly higher acceptance rate
within the Early Decision pool at
other schools, Kinnally explains
that Stanford is different.
"While many other institutions
may admit 40 or 50 percent of their
incoming classes early, we admitted
around 30 percent," he said. "We
want to discourage the use of Early
Decision an admissions strategy,
but rather as a confirmation that
the applicant knows that this is the
right school for them."
The Office of Undergraduate
Admission will begin reviewing the
applications submitted under Reg
ular Review shortly. It anticipates
mailing out decision letters in early
April.
