ly gave an early Christmas present to 483 high school se
niors last month: acceptance letters to the Class of 2003
under the University's Early Decision program.
Twenty-four percent of the 2,003 students who applied

Of the 3,172 students who applied early last year, 611, or
19 percent, were admitted, a slight drop from this year's
figures.
Started three years ago, the Early Decision program is
a binding application option for students whose first choice
