## 'Nicole Renée' 
### 
Nicole is a wonderfully tal
ented new artist. Her self-titled
debut album, "Nicole Ren£e,"
(Atlantic Records) is a deftly arranged
vehicle that showcases this opera-trained
23-year-old's eclectic singing and her
intriguing songwriting style. Ren6e
penned or co-penned all of her songs; she
co-wrote three songs with Lamont
Dozier, best known for his efforts with
Motown.
The 15 songs on this album cover a
range of topics, tackling issues such as
change, religion, love, drtfgs and heart
break, and doing so in ways that are funky
and innovative.
Nicole Rente's voice has the cha
meleon-like ability to change on each
song. Her voice is reminiscent of The
Artist Formerly Known as Prince's on the
first track, "Telephone," as she nastily
sings over a melodic piano, "Aww, tele
phone / Won't you ring? /1 want some
body / To talk dirty to me." Then all the
Prince comparisons fade and the guitar
picks up as she dips into her rock mood
and growls, "I wanna pick up the

phone / 'Cause I'm all alone / And I feel
like I'm ready to get it on!"
On "Heaven," a slow guitar-laden bal
lad dedicated to God, Nicole Rente's soft
voice takes off at the chorus and soars into
three or four consecutive high C-note riffs
that would make Mariah Carey proud. At
the song's end, she sings in call-and
response with a violin and it's hard to tell
her soprano from the violin's high tunes.
It's difficult to classify Rente's music.
Each song is a mixture of many different
lyrical and musical styles. Her track "Ugh!
(God)," for example, is a combination of
R & Band rock. Renews voice ranges from
deeply passionate to soft and sighing with
seductive groans and adventurous shouts.
The chorus to her hit "Strawberry,"
"Your love is like strawberries/...Some
times you're bitter, sometimes you're
sweet /1 feel the same way about you and
me," perhaps explains her musical style
most succinctly. Nicole Rente's voice and
music are sometimes bitter, sometimes
sweet, but always original and always
enjoyable.
