# All City
## 'Metropolis Gold' 
### 
After coming on strong earlier this year with its first two singles,"The Actual" and
"Priceless", All City raised eyebrows in the hip-hop community. Unfortunately,
the group may have also raised expectations for its debut album, "Metropolis
Gold," to levels that it could never attain. The result is a decent album that nevertheless
is sure to disappoint many hip-hop fans.
All City, comprised of Brooklyn MCs J. Mega and Greg Valentine, comes with lyrical
sharpness over tracks by some of the best New York producers, including Pete Rock and
DJ Premier: "We boa constricted, gettin' so many splits it's sickenin' / Lyrically stick ya,
every pedestrian's a victim" ("The Actual"). At All City's best, on tracks such as "Time/,
is Hard" and "Afta Hours," the duo is reminiscent of Nas' early work. Often, the subject
matter gets narrow and repetitive ("All City, bound to be rich without the filthy"). To All
City's credit, the discussion of such tired subject matter is considerably more clever than
songs such as Jermaine Dupri's "Money Ain't a Thing." Best of all, All City's lyrical pro
ficiency enables it to avoid hiding behind rap cliches such as "player hater" that are
commonly used to conceal deficient skills.
The one indiscretion of "Metropolis Gold" is that it attempts to add crossover appeal
to its street credibility through the use of catchy R & B hooks and beats. These attempts
not only fall flat, but may lose fans of All City's original underground sound. The weak
est cuts on "Metropolis Gold" include "Daydreaming" and the lukewarm "The Hot
Joint." On the laughable "Get Paid," All City is shameless in jacking the chorus from
Calloway's pop hit "1 Wanna Be Rich." (Quick! Run home and download the MP3!)
That's one not even Puff Daddy wouldn't touch.
"Metropolis Gold" is unique in that nearly every track either shows flashes of hip-hop
brilliance or is just plain bad The mediocrity and inconsistency of this debut effort is not
indicative of the ability and potential of All City. Rather, those shortcomings represent
some poor choices that have more to do with marketing strategy than hip-hop talent.
While undoubtedly a great disappointment, "Metropolis Gold" is a promising, if no bet
ter than average, debut from one of hip-hop's best young groups.
