## Free Sexx 'Go, Speed, Go': Premature Ejaculation 
### Roxy Sass 
rw-iour candlelight dinner moves quickly to
coffee. Coffee moves to hanging out,
[J which rapidly turns to making out,
and—blink —you're in bed. But faster than
you can say Nonoxynol-9, it's over. What hap

Your lusty liaison has been halted by those twtf 1
word* that strike fear into the hearts of healthy,
horny males everywhere: premature ejaculation.
Medical textbooks define it as ejaculation that
occurs before a man wishes, or too quickly to
please his partner. This definition applies rather
too easily to reality when you consider that sex
lasts a meager three minutes for the average
twenty-something male.
Three minutes in the sack would not have
always been a bedroom bane. For cavemen, it
seems that coming quickly would have meant a
lower likelihood of getting nibbled on by a sabre
toothed tiger while lost in the throe&of primor
dial passion. The quicker the man came, the bet
ter his survival rate, which makes our modern
males the offspring of eons of sexual sprinters.
Today, however, such survival tactics are not as
necessary (unless, of course, your girl has an
angry and unannounced boyfriend). But you
may find that other modern problems are caus
ing you to be premature. A man's penis is a sen
aitive fellow, and reacts to stress, performance
anxiety and The novelty of a new partner is
also enough to niake a penis beside itself with
excitement But generally, a devoted gentleman
can overcome such hurdles. Though lasting long
is a learned response, it is not a difficult one to
master.
With that in mind, Miss Sass offers this info
for the gentleman looking to better his hang
time, starting with the nuts and bolts of male
orgasm. When a man has an orgasm, two distinct
processes take place. First, the prostate gland and
the seminal vesicle release their contents (read:
lubricant plus sperm) into the urethra. This stage
compares to the start of a really good sneeze.
The second stage, then, is the sneeze itself. The
pelvic muscles contract, forcing the fluid out at
lightning speed. Now, moving from intense
animal through these two stages happens so
quickly that It is doubtful that the male has
stopped to ponder whether it is possible to pre
vent the sequence. But U is.
The key is finding the "Point of No Return." At
some point, ejaculation is out of the man's hands,
so to speak. The brain has sent the message to
ejaculate and the reflex is impossible to stop. To
ditcfy, one's premie status, a man must become
staggeringly well attuned to this point (which is
most easily done alone, if you catch Miss Sass'
drift). The point of finding The Point, then, is to
stop orgasm just before you reach it. Try building
up to, and then backing away from, that point
five or six times in one session.
Once you've mastered that, in a manner of
speaking, you're ready to try your hand at sex.
Approach the act in a leisurely manner, since the
hurried your entrance, the slower your exit is
likefy to be. And don't tune out. Even though
we've all heard of men reciting batting averages
to cool down, you need to be attentive to The
Point of No Reftifn so as nofftflun right over it.

"So, now that I've found the Point," you say,
"how do I apply it?" You have two options here,
the first of which is called the "start and stop
method." With this tactic, you're basically going
to do precisely what you've been doing in train
ing, but with an added twist. When you feel your
self getting close, cease all movement. This time,
press th* pubic bone (area under your pubic
hair) against your mate's pubic bone. Pause there
and endearing,like,"lust takin'
breather, snookums." Only resume once you've
calmed down a tad.
Your second option is the slightly more exotic
"sqtfeeze technique." Again, when you find your
self close to orgasm, stop. Now, withdraw and
squeeze the "member" on the shaft. After a cou
ple squeezes, you should be ready to go again,
and the eventual orgasm will be much stronger.
Naturally, either method provides the couple
with a bit of lag time. But that's not to say that
you both should twiddle your thumbs while
waiting. Keep your hands, voice and goodness
knows what else active, and doubtless you won't
mind the rest.
Now that Mis 9 Sass has told you what to do,
she thinks she ought to include what not to.
There are many unscrupulous merchants ready
to prey on the wilted ego of the premature male.
For example, products like the disturbingly
named "Man Dip" claim to prevent premature
ejaculation by numbing the nerves in the penis.
This curative seems even more outrageous when
you consider that it must be applied an hour
before any action, Just think; If you end up not
needing it after you've already dipped, you have
an unfortunate and unnecessary numbness to
contend with.
It gets even stranger. One advertiser pitches a
self-hypnosis method to increase your staying
power. And, to top them ail, a woman with a
|orn-star name (based in Palo Alto, no less)
gjpßers "private sessions in loose, comfortable
clothes" to cure your problem. While these treat
ments are laughable at best and startling at worst,
Miss Sass questions whether they are useful at all.
Instead, try a few of the techniques Miss Sass
suggests. All they'll cost you is a little effort, and
the benefits could be wonderful for everyone
involved. And rather than sweep the problem
under the figurative bedspread, think of thisrjf
three minutes are a rollicking good time, would
n't six be twice as fun?

we've all heard of men reciting batting averages
to cool down, you need to be attentive to The
Point of No Reftifn so as nofftflun right over it.

"So, now that I've found the Point," you say,
"how do I apply it?" You have two options here,
the first of which is called the "start and stop
method." With this tactic, you're basically going
to do precisely what you've been doing in train
ing, but with an added twist. When you feel your
self getting close, cease all movement. This time,
press th* pubic bone (area under your pubic
hair) against your mate's pubic bone. Pause there
and endearing,like,"lust takin'
breather, snookums." Only resume once you've
calmed down a tad.
Your second option is the slightly more exotic
"sqtfeeze technique." Again, when you find your
self close to orgasm, stop. Now, withdraw and
squeeze the "member" on the shaft. After a cou
ple squeezes, you should be ready to go again,
and the eventual orgasm will be much stronger.
Naturally, either method provides the couple
with a bit of lag time. But that's not to say that
you both should twiddle your thumbs while
waiting. Keep your hands, voice and goodness
knows what else active, and doubtless you won't
mind the rest.
Now that Mis 9 Sass has told you what to do,
she thinks she ought to include what not to.
There are many unscrupulous merchants ready
to prey on the wilted ego of the premature male.
For example, products like the disturbingly
named "Man Dip" claim to prevent premature
ejaculation by numbing the nerves in the penis.
This curative seems even more outrageous when
you consider that it must be applied an hour
before any action, Just think; If you end up not
needing it after you've already dipped, you have
an unfortunate and unnecessary numbness to
contend with.
It gets even stranger. One advertiser pitches a
self-hypnosis method to increase your staying
power. And, to top them ail, a woman with a
|orn-star name (based in Palo Alto, no less)
gjpßers "private sessions in loose, comfortable
clothes" to cure your problem. While these treat
ments are laughable at best and startling at worst,
Miss Sass questions whether they are useful at all.
Instead, try a few of the techniques Miss Sass
suggests. All they'll cost you is a little effort, and
the benefits could be wonderful for everyone
involved. And rather than sweep the problem
under the figurative bedspread, think of thisrjf
three minutes are a rollicking good time, would
n't six be twice as fun?
Yours,
Ms. Roxy Sass
