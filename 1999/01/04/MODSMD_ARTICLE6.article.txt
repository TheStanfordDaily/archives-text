## On to Oxford for alum trio 
### kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
Three recent graduates are headed to Eng
land in October after winning Rhodes and
Marshall Scholarships.
Eric Beerhohm, Karen Matsouka and Aly
Remtulla were awarded the scholarships last
month which grant them the right to study at
least two years at Oxford University.
Beerbohm, Class of '98, who graduated with
a bachelor's degree in political science and a
master's in philosophy, will attend Oxford as a
Marshall scholar. Matsuoka. who earned a
bachelor's in philosophy and religious studies
in 19% and a master's in religious studies in
1997. was awarded one of 32 American Rhodes
Scholarships. Remtulla. Class of '98, who grad
uated with a bachelor's in anthropology, was
awarded a Canadian Rhodes Scholarship.
Colonial statesman Cecil Rhodes estab
lished the scholarship bearing his name in 1902.
The Rhodes Scholarship provides funding and
living expenses for two years of study at Oxford
I Inivcrsitv but can be extended for a third year.
The Marshall Scholarship was established
in 1953 in recognition of Gen. George C. Mar

shall. who devised a plan to aid Western Euro
pean countries, including Great Britain, after
World War 11. Marshall scholarships allow for
recipients to attend any college in Britain.
These scholarships allow their recipients to
explore intellectual and social issues of their
choice.
Political Science Prof. Susan Okin, well ac
quainted with Beerbohm, said that for students
who demonstrate an interest in the world be
yond themselves, "the best thing we can do is to
encourage that part of them that wants to be
part of a larger community and do something
for it.and to use their extraordinary talents to
make things better for people as well as them
selves."
The research subjects of the three Stanford
scholars were influenced by their backgrounds.
Beerbohm, who grew up in the affluent suburb
of Belmont. Calif., is deeply committed to so
cial justice after realizing the contrast between
his suburban upbringing and the poverty he
has witnessed elsewhere.
He is currently involved in the Kenan Ethics
Program at Duke University as a John Gard-
ner Fellow. He is busy doing re
search and developing programs in
moral leadership and moral reflec
tion. This winter he will return to
Stanford and finish up his fellowship
in the Ethics in Society Program. He
will then travel to Oxford to earn a
master's degree in politics.
He said in his application, "From
inside a public-spirited, theory
laden law school, I would i>ain the

credentials to crusade for civil rights
and against civic wrongs. And from
academia, outside the political sys
tem looking in. 1 could continue to
bridge the gap between public ser
vice and public philosophy, the ac
tivist life and the contemplative
one."
Matsuoka has been concerned
with issues of identity since her
childhood. She is a Japanese-Amer
ican whose mother and relatives
were interned during World War 11.
She was one of four Asian Ameri
cans at an elementary school which

was predominantly African-Ameri
can.
She currently is employed as a
graphic designer in the Earth Sci
ences Division at NASA Ames Re
search Center in Mountain View.
When she heads off to Oxford in the
fall, she intends to study English lan
guage and literature.
"I came into this process thinking
I had absolutely no chance of win
ning," Matsuoka said, "so it was
shocking to hear my name an
nounced."
Remtulla's family migrated from

Kenya to Canada when he was 10
years old, sparking his interest in the
movements of other groups. His
family felt forced to emigrate when
anti-Indian hostility spread across
East Africa. Remtulla wrote his
honors thesis on the Ismaili Muslim
community in Kenya. He had a fel
lowship at the National Network for
Immigration and Refugee Rights in
Oakland and now works with the
Immigration and Refugee Board in
Calgary.
Once at Oxford, Remtulla plans
to pursue a master's in migration

and refugee studies during his first
year. He will decide what to study
in his second year after he has a bet
ter sense of what Oxford has to
offer.
He said his Rhodes scholarship
will allow him to, "pursue something
that's a little bit out of my field but
still related to what I'm doing."
Applying for a Rhodes or Mar
shall Scholarship is an exhausting
process. Applicants must write a
900-word essay about why they want
to go to Oxford. Six letters of recom
mendation also must be sent: four

from professors and two from peo
ple who know the applicant well.
After this information is submit
ted, a committee reviews the appli
cation and selects candidates to in
terview. Applicants are then select
ed from this regional interview to
travel to a final, national interview
session.
Last year, two Stanford students
won Marshall Scholarships, but no
student received a Rhodes Scholar
ship. In 1997, Stanford students won
one Rhodes and two Marshall
Scholarships.
