# Wolfe brings book tour to Kresge
## 
### Evan Nordby Editorial staff 
Noted author and social critic Tom Wolfe spoke
briefly and read from his new novel, "A Man in Full," at
Kresge Auditorium on Dec. 6.
Wolfe, in his trademark white suit, opened with a ex
planation of his view of the creative writing process. He
said that the traditional hit of advice given to writers,
"write what you know," is too narrow.
"Most young writers, if they have talent, can ransack
the first 20 or 25 years of their lives for their first novel,"
he said. "Then it comes time to write their second novel."
" There is no reason why any writer can't go out into the
world to find material," he said. Wolfe mentioned the
19th-century French author Emile Zola as a prime exam
ple.
Zola espoused the virtues of being the "uniformed
man from Mars," Wolfe said, when doing research and
observing. "Then you can ask questions."
Wolfe himself began as a conventional journalist, then
became a charter member of the school of New Journal
ism in the 1960s along with flamboyant writer Hunter S.
Thompson and others. In narrative style, Wolfe chroni
cled the drug-addled travels of Ken Kesey's Merry
Pranksters in"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test." He ex-

posed the pretense of "limousine lib
eralism" during the late 60s in his
essay "Radical Chic," and skewered
the golden-boy image of the Mer
cury astronauts in"The Right Stuff."
He said he loves America as a
source of material. "There are so
many rich areas — this country is
bizarre."
"There has been so much money
pumped into this country. Right
now, as we sit in Palo Alto, your elec
trician is in Puerto Vallarta with his
third wife, and ordering Evian be
cause Perrier is so tacky."
Wolfe explained that, when writ
ing fiction, he first gets the setting,
then lets his characters walk into the
story. "A Man in Full" is set in Geor
gia, within the culture of wealth that
maintains quail-hunting plantations
in southwest Georgia complete with
private airstrips for the wealthy own
ers to fly in.
His lead character is Charlie Cro

ker, a high-stakes Atlanta real-estate
developer and plantation owner, and
a "Platonic ideal - a man with all the
virtues and all the mistakes."
He read a passage from the novel
in which Croker is taken to task by
bank officials for defaulting on half a
billion dollars in loans.
"The word debtor is not used
until the loans go bad," Wolfe ex
plained before reading. "Until then,
you're a client. A synonym for
debtor is shithead."
After reading, Wolfe took ques
tions from the audience.
Wolfe also explained his take on
personal status, a theme present
throughout his books.
"Status dominates our psycholo
gy," he said. For"The Right Stuff,"
he said, "1 wasn't interested in space
exploration. I was interested in the
status structure of the world of fly
ing."
Wolfe's talk, sponsored by local
independent booksellers, was open
only to those who purchased a copy
of his new book. It was followed by
an autograph session.
