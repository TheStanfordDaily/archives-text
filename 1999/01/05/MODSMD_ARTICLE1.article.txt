## Midwest airports swamped, hundreds of flights canceled 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Unprecedented snow levels at
America's major airports through
out the Midwest have made many
students prisoners in their own
hometowns, as hundreds of flights
have been delayed and canceled.
According to Sunday's New
York Times, most flights out of
Chicago and St. Louis — major con
necting points for flights from the
East Coast — were grounded by up
to a foot of snow last weekend.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
that while a lack of information has
prevented his office from taking any
action, he understands the plight of
the students. "As a national Univer
sity, Stanford realizes that a lot of
students are having trouble due to
inclement weather and has always
been very accommodating to stu
dents with this problem," he said.
With a portion of the student
body unavoidably missing from

campus, faculty have had to come up
with ways to accommodate snow
hound students.
Popular classes that required
sign-ups on Monday, such as social
dance, have developed differing
methods of dealing with flight-de
layed students. Social dance instruc
tor Richard Powers said. "A lot of
people have written me e-mails say

ing 'I'm stuck in Syracuse' or some
place."
As for how to deal with these stu
dents, he said. "I'm working on it...
. The question is how to accommo
date these students fairly." So far, he
has been allowing friends who made
it to campus to sign up for the snow
