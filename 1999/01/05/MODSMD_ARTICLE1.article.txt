## Midwest airports swamped, hundreds of flights canceled 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
Unprecedented snow levels at
America's major airports through
out the Midwest have made many
students prisoners in their own
hometowns, as hundreds of flights
have been delayed and canceled.
According to Sunday's New
York Times, most flights out of
Chicago and St. Louis — major con
necting points for flights from the
East Coast — were grounded by up
to a foot of snow last weekend.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
that while a lack of information has
prevented his office from taking any
action, he understands the plight of
the students. "As a national Univer
sity, Stanford realizes that a lot of
students are having trouble due to
inclement weather and has always
been very accommodating to stu
dents with this problem," he said.
With a portion of the student
body unavoidably missing from

campus, faculty have had to come up
with ways to accommodate snow
hound students.
Popular classes that required
sign-ups on Monday, such as social
dance, have developed differing
methods of dealing with flight-de
layed students. Social dance instruc
tor Richard Powers said. "A lot of
people have written me e-mails say

ing 'I'm stuck in Syracuse' or some
place."
As for how to deal with these stu
dents, he said. "I'm working on it...
. The question is how to accommo
date these students fairly." So far, he
has been allowing friends who made
it to campus to sign up for the snow

bound.
The storm hit Saturday, sweeping
its way southward. Saturday saw the
highest numbers of flight cancella
tions with steady but gradual im
provement over Sunday and Mon
day.
At Chicago's O'Hare Interna
tional Airport, which suffered the
area's worst blizzard in 30 years, only
50 percent of scheduled flights left
the ground on Sunday and Monday.
Since those days are the ones most
students planned to arrive on cam
pus, some got lucky and others did
not.
Freshman Daniel Zlatnik was
scheduled to fly from O'Hare to San
Jose at 9 a.m. on Sunday, but his
flight was canceled due to snow. He

was put on standby, and managed to
get a flight to San Francisco at 11
a.m.
Junior Jason Tester, still at home
in Dearborn, Mich., was not so
lucky. After a major storm hit the
area on Saturday, his flight out of
Detroit's Metro Airport was can
celed, and he was not able to get an
other flight out until this morning.
"Probably more than half the
flights were canceled," he said. "[On
Sunday and Monday] they were still
trying to schedule flights for people
who had missed theirs on Saturday."
He said that even if he had want
ed to go to the airport on Sunday, it
would have been impossible because
he was snowed in at his house.
The delay has not caused him any
major problems, only slight bore
dom and a few missed classes this
morning. "I thought I'd have more
to do," he said.
