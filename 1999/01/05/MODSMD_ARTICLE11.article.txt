## Euro looks solid in global trading 
### 
FRANKFURT. Germany (AP)
- Europe's currency got off to a
strong start yesterday, rising against
the dollar on world currency mar
kets. But analysts said it will take
time to determine whether the cur
rency will challenge the dollar's
international dominance.
Some suggested if the euro is too
strong, it could hurt both the U.S.
and European economies.
With the euro trading above
expectations, European officials
were delighted at the successful
launch of their ambitious economic
and monetary union, tightly linking
11 nations and 292 million residents.
After starting off at $ 1.1668 early
in the trading day, the euro hit a
high of $1.1886 in Tokyo, and
slipped slightly to $1.1820 in late

European trading. In New York,
the euro sold for $1.1830 in late
trading.
French central banker Jean-
Claude Triehet welcomed the euro's
strength as "the best possible omen."
The euro was launched last Fri
day. a day after conversion rates
against the 11 participating curren
cies were fixed. While euro coins
and bank notes will not be in con
sumers' pockets until 2002, the cur
rency can be bought and sold elec
tronically around the world. It also
can be used for purchases by credit
card or traveler's check.
Foreign exchange experts say it
may take some time for the euro to
find a consistent range against the
dollar. "People are going to assess
the market for the next two weeks

to find a trend they can ride for the
next three months," said Gerry
Celaya, senior analyst at American
Express Bank in London.
In Washington. Clinton adminis

tration officials held to their position
that a successful launching of the
euro was in the best interests of the
United States and a strong euro did
not represent a threat to the dollar.
