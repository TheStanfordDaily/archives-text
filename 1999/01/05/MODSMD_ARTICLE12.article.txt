Bin Laden grants interviews
NEW YORK (AP) - Osama bin Laden, the
exiled Saudi millionaire aceused of plotting
bombing attacks on two American embassies in
Africa, told one U.S. news magazine that he did
not order the attacks and another that he did
"instigate" them.
The mixed messages come from interviews
released over the weekend that are to be pub
lished in the Jan. 11 issues of Newsweek and
Time.
Bin Laden previously had denied involve
ment in the Aug. 7 bombings of the embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.
He repeated that denial in the interview with
Newsweek, conducted Dec. 22: "1 did not order

them but was very glad for what happened to
the Americans there."
But the next day, Dec. 23. he told Time's
reporter that he did "instigate" the attacks -
the closest he lias come to admitting personal
involvement.
Davis steps into office
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The central
theme of Gov. Gray Davis' inaugural address,
"The Era of Higher Expectations," invokes
memories of former Gov. Jerry Brown, but
with a significant twist.
With Davis as his right-hand man. Gov.
Brown described his tenure in the l c J7()s as an
"era of limits" and told Californians to "lower
your expectations" of what government could

do to help them, stressing instead that Califor
nians would have to do more to help them
selves.
"Lower your expectations" ultimately
became a serious negative for Brown during the
6 1/2 years Davis served him as chief of staff.
In his inaugural address yesterday, Davis
also stressed that Californians must help them
selves, but he cast it in a more positive light.
"1 intend to challenge all students to raise
their sights and lift their performance. 1 believe
in higher expectations," Davis said.
"We must demand that all students do bet
ter — and we must insist upon more responsi
bility and accountability from everyone — stu
dents, teachers, parents, administrators and
from society itself. That will be my primary mis
sion as your governor."
