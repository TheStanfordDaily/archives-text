## House will vote on presenting impeachment evidence to Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Within
hours after the ceremonial conven
ing of the 106 th Congress tomor
row, newly sworn-in members of
the House will vote on authorizing
key lawmakers to present evidence
against President Clinton in a Sen
ate impeachment trial, officials said
yesterday.
Rep. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois
Republican on the brink of election
as House speaker, said he hopes
the proposal — identical to the one
that cleared the House in Decem
ber — will pass, and GOP vote
counters expressed confidence.
"I would certainly like to see
Henry Hyde be able to present the
testimony and what he needs to do
to put his case forward," Hastert
said in a reference to the Illinois
lawmaker who chaired the
impeachment inquiry in the House.
The House approved two arti
cles of impeachment on Dec. 19,
accusing Clinton of perjury and
obstruction of justice in connection
with an attempt to conceal his sex
ual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
The requirement for a repeat
vote in the new Congress means
newly elected lawmakers will vote
on the momentous issue on their
first day in office. It also gives fresh
opportunities to Democrats — who
gained seats in the November elec
tions — to affect the course of an
impeachment they have sought to
thwart.
Democratic sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, listed
several options, including a new
attempt to place the House on

record in favor of censure, a plan to
try and limit the jurisdiction of the
House's prosecutors and a plan to
try to add Democrats to the team
of prosecutors. While each of these
suggestions is under discussion,
each has pitfalls and Democrats
may ultimately decide against pur
suing any of them, these officials
added.
The certainty of a House vote
on Wednesday stood in marked
contrast to the unsettled situation
in the Senate, where Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., strug
gled to fashion a procedure for a
trial that could satisfy half his own
GOP members and win Democrat
ic support.
In a stab at bipartisanship, two
lawmakers have outlined a proce
dure calling for Hyde to present
evidence for one day, the White
House to have a day for rebuttal,
and the Senate to take a quick vote
to determine whether a full-blown
trial should proceed.
In a news conference in his
home state of Washington, Repub
lican Sen. Slade Gorton said the
plan he and Democratic Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
developed will proceed only if a
majority of each caucus supports
it.
Democrats apparently are in
favor and his "best guess" is that a
majority of the Senate agrees, but
"Senator Lott will propose the
plan. 1 believe, only if a majority of
Republicans favor it," Gorton said.
He said he had no head count
within the GOP caucus or the full
Senate.
