## Editorial Farewell, Provost Rice 
### 
Condi leaves a legacy as
powerful administrator
who cares about students

WHILE THE PROVOST 'S job is
largely administrative, Provost
Rice never hid behind her desk
during her six-year term at Stanford.
Last spring, she met with protestors in
the Quad during the graduate housing cri
sis. Although most undergraduates couldn't
appreciate the parallels, that occasion was
reminiscent of a meeting during the hunger
strike in 1994, when Rice and President
C asper faced angry protesters demanding
greater support for minorities at Stanford.
On both occasions, Condi charged into the
fray and took the flak for the administra
tion.
Rice was also at the center of controver
sy during her early years on the job. when
she drew criticism and dismay for initiating
millions of dollars in budget cuts.
Rice has also been a celebrity in the
Stanford community. Most students have
heard the story of how she found her call
ing as a specialist in Eastern European and
Soviet international relations after decid
ing not to become a concert pianist. She
still practices and performs. A few of us
have even heard her play and have been
duly impressed. It is not difficult to imagine
Rice as a professional pianist; she seems
quite comfortable in the spotlight, at the
center of conflict and debate.
Many of us will also remember Rice as
an administrator with panache. We've
interacted with her as students in her

sophomore seminar, benefiting from one of
the many improvements in undergraduate
education that she approved. Or we've
heard her advice to pursue our passions and
worry less about careers and marketable
skills. We have clashed with her over issues
and policies; we may disagree with her deci
sions. But on a personal level, we can relate
to Rice.
Maybe it's the fact that she's relatively
young for a top administrator. Maybe it's
her tale of switching career paths as a young
woman â€” alter all, many of us have yet to
decide on a major, let alone a career. Or
maybe it's just that when we talk to her, she
listens and seems to care.
Whatever it is that makes a powerful
person seem less like a ruler in a faraway
fortress and more like a human being.
Provost Rice has it.
Of course, Rice was responsible for ush
ering in a multitude of changes in financial
and academic policies. Her budget cuts
saved the university $16.8 million between
1994 and 1996. In the wake of the hunger
strikes, the University instituted the current
residence-based voting system on grapes
and also included a program in Chicano
Studies as part of the program in Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity. More
recently. Rice has worked to try to increase
the percentage of female professors,
although she acknowledges that she wishes
she had gained better results.

Rice is an effective and respected admin
istrator who will he difficult to replace.
Most of us, however, will miss her more
because of her personality, her intelligence
and her willingness to bridge the gap and
communicate with students. Farewell,
Provost Rice, and good luck.
