SEVERAL ANTI-SEMITIC llicrs were found throughout
campus 10 years ago this week, according to The Stanford
Daily. 1 he llicrs followed a stream of anti-Semitic literature
that had been spread throughout the previous quarter.
"About 25 leaflets equating Judaism with Communism were
left yesterday on windshields of cars parked around the Oval at
noon. I he two-sided flier quoted The Bible, a New York Times
article. National Geographic and other sources, drawing a paral
lel between an impending nuclear holocaust, the spread of Com
munism and an alleged Jewish conspiracy," the Daily reported.
I he fliers were attributed to a group called the Sons of Lib
erty in Metairie, La. One flier also contained a prayer called
"(ieorgc Washington's Vision" that was published by a evan
gelical printing company called the Gospel Tract Society.
The series of flyers were part of a trend of anti-Semitic events
across campus. The Hillel Jewish student center received a skin
head newspaper at its front door in mid-December, and the
entire campus was targeted by several anti-Semitic fliers in
November.
Jewish groups and concerned students reacted firmly but qui
etly to the recent string of events. Hillel director Jocelyn Reis
man noted that skinhead groups only want to draw attention to
themselves, and giving them publicity only gives the senders sat
isfaction.
"I was torn between taking these people seriously or thinking
of them as fools, but they are probably fools. These kind of peo
ple get satisfaction out of the publicity in the papers." Reisman

said.
Some students expressed a bit more concern. Doctoral stu
dent Erica Austin said. "To put them on the cars on the first day
back at school shows that the issue may have been on someone's
mind a while."
One undergraduate who had recently returned from Ger
many after studying the Holocaust with students from around
the world noted, "People thought the Nazis were fools, too. Peo
ple thought nothing would happen, and it did."
In other news, former presidential candidate and Delaware
Senator Joseph Biden spoke at Kresge Auditorium on the future
of American foreign policy. Three Stanford students were also
named Rhodes scholars.
John Crandon planned to use his years in Oxford to study
public health and prepare for a career working in government
health regulation. He was a double major in biology and political
science.
Michael MeCullough planned to use his award to learn about
children's health issues. He had established the Stanford Medical
Youth Science Program during his undergraduate years.
Victoria Donaldson planned to study international trade law
at Oxford and plan for a career in the foreign service. She had
majored in international relations with a specialization in
international law.
In sports news, freshman basketball star and future Utah Jazz
starter Adam Keefe stunned fans with his rebounding skills and
intimidating demeanor.
