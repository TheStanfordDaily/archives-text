## We wish you a Merry Kwanzaa 
### 
WELL people,
welcome back.
1 hope you all
had a Merry Kwanzaa
and a Happy New Year.
Many of you have
thought this, and some
have said it, so let's just

get it right out in the open: I'm going to
Hell.
This thought first occurred to me as I
sat down to write this week's column.
After yet another "000, I really shouldn't
say that ... eh, why not," I realized my
karma is shot.
And what is karma? Karma is meted
out by the Cosmos. At least that's what
my brother always says. And he heard it
on the Simpsons, so it must be true.
Karma sends you to Hell. It is easy to
accumulate bad karma (damn the Cosmos
...doh!). Bad karma can happen as a
result of bad thoughts, bad actions or bad
breath.
Most people tend to take themselves
too seriously, and one can lose karma
points for mocking their self-righteous
ness. For reasons you can already see, I'm
going to Hell.
According to a homeless man I met
over Christmas break (yes, Christmas, not
the politically correct "holiday" term),
I'm going to Hell because I "saw dem
socks wit da holez in de feet." Hmm. I
guess that would bother me, but he was
drunk and only had three teeth. What
could he know?
I may be going to Hell for other rea
sons. With Jean's help, I stole the Tri Delt
composite and sold it on the black market
for a nickel. I'm sorry, but you should

know that it did go to a good cause. Some
guy named Oscar bought it and he was so
happy he cried. This does not imply that
the composite was not worth its quoted
$650 value.
Not convinced yet? Two words: post
office.
Two more words: handicapped parking.
You know you're going to Hell when you
curse the empty spaces with the blue
wheelchair. Granted, I have nothing
against the concept. In fact, it's a good
idea. They should be close so they don't
have to walk, roll or limp very far. This is
understandable, but do we need so many
spots?
I can usually count enough spaces for a
Handicapped Parade. What are the odds
that every disabled person on earth is
going to come to the same shopping cen
ter at once?
I also live in the upper closet of the
Theta house rent-free. And then I eat
their food. And I once went into the con
fusingly-marked women's bathroom.
Sorry. 1 didn't know.
Speaking of the Thetas, I suppose I'm
also going to Hell for my sympathy for the
poor Alpha Sigs. Good bye and good rid
dance. I, for one, am thrilled that the
Thetas have their house. Not only is it
nice, clean, and lots of fun, but it is the
home of my aforementioned closet. I
should mention that I wouldn't object to
the Alpha Sigs getting their own official
house, so long as it doesn't infringe on my
right to a closet.
And then there's Kwanzaa. What is
Kwanzaa? It's the African-American spir
itual holiday, of course! It's not Christ
mas, it's not (C)hanukkkahahahah, it's

Kwanzaa. Great name there â€” I think it
should be Chrismanukkah myself.
Invented in 1966 by Dr. Karenga,
Kwanzaa was meant to fill the gap for
Black America and African Americans,
who, according to the good doctor, were
exploited during the Christmas season
and left without a holiday. Similar to the
ancient wonders of the world, there are
seven principles of Kwanzaa. They all
have funny names (except for Ujamaa)
meant to remind people of their cultural
past.
When 1 see an African American, I
don't think, "Oh, he's from Africa." I see
a fellow United States citizen. I doubt the
intragroup unity outweighs the further
alienation felt by those who already see
each group as "different" (e.g. skinheads).
Good goals, bad practice.
People use differences to exacerbate
them. But that's not why 1 cannot take
Kwanzaa seriously. "On the first day of
Kwanzaa my true love gave to me?"
It's hard to believe that Christmas isn't
for black people. It's for everybody who
wants to put up a tree, hang a stocking
and have some fun.
Finally, I'm going to Hell for the "You
can't spell DIRTY OLD CRACK
WHORE without CAL" T-shirt. It appar
ently is some mortal sin to make fun of
Cal. That may be true, and I may be going
to Hell, but at least I'll have a lot of com
pany.

Dan Geyser, a senior majoring in political
science, thanks the Thetas for letting him
live in their closet. Many, many tent-toting
grad students must be very jealous.
