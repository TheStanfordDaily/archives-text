## No. 4 Cardinal cruises past Oregon Stanford sweeps first conference weekend with win against Ducks 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
In case anyone was wondering
how the Stanford men's basketball
team would deal with the injuries to
several key reserve players, last
night's 77-59 victory against Ore
gon provided the clear answer.
The usually reserve-reliant Car
dinal (12-2, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) got zero points from its
bench, and instead rode solid play
across the board from all five
starters to a convincing victory
against the Ducks (9-2,1-1).
In particular, fifth-year senior
center Tim Young rediscovered his
scoring ability in the post, tallying a
season-high 23 points. Bothered by
a nagging back injury. Young was
held scoreless a week ago against
Temple, and managed just two
points on Saturday against Oregon
State.
"I was really pleased to see Tim
Young get back," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "He's
going to be key for us down the
stretch, so it was nice to see him
play like the Tim that we have had
here more often than not."
Young also grabbed a season
high 12 rebounds and looked far
more aggressive in the paint than
he had in earlier games.
"Truthfully, yesterday in prac
tice I saw a spark that hadn't been

there," Montgomery said. "He was
struggling with the back a little bit,
and I was hoping yesterday would
be the start of [his return to solid
play], and obviously that was the
case here tonight."

■ Yesterday: Stanford (12-2,2-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) 77, Oregon (9-2
1-1)59.

Junior forward Mark Madsen
posted a season-high 17 points
while grabbing seven rebounds.
Perhaps most importantly, how
ever, Madsen held A.D. Smith.
Oregon's leading scorer and re
bounder, to jut seven points and
five rebounds.
"Timmy was the key offensively
for us tonight," Montgomery
added. "And Madsen did a real
nice job with A.D. Smith. We knew
that their perimeter kids were
good, so we needed to score on the
inside.
"We've always talked about un
derstanding where our advantage
is, and that is going to shift. Tonight
our advantage was on the inside,
and we made the most of it. That is
how you win basketball games."
As it did in the conference open
er against Oregon State on Satur
day, the Cardinal came out storm
ing in the first half, and its defensive
pressure and offensive execution

propelled Stanford to a comfort
able 34-20 halftime lead.
"They came out and gave us a
serious jolt in the first half," Ore
gon coach Ernie Kent said. "We
talked at halftime about being in a
prize fight and taking a big shot,
getting knocked down, and how
you have to get back up."
And that is exactly what the
Ducks did in the second half, pick
ing up the intensity on both ends
and getting some three-pointers to
fall.
Oregon got as close as eight
points, but the Cardinal was simply
too strong over the full course of
the game.
"1 was real proud of the way this
team came back in the second
half," Kent said. "[But] Stanford is
a team that plays 40 minutes and
plays hard every possession. We
probably only played up to a high
level for 20 minutes, and that just
wasn't enough."
Senior point guard Arthur Lee,
who with each game becomes a
more reliable and complete floor
general for the Cardinal, finished
with career highs in rebounds
(eight) and steals (four).
Mr. Clutch for Stanford, Lee al
ways seems to hit big shots down
the stretch and seems to have a true
understanding for his role in the
team's success.
Last night he contributed to the

offense by pouring in 15 points, but
recognized that his most important
responsibility was to create for the
post players.
"I was definitely looking to get
Tim the ball tonight," Lee said.
"We know that if we are going to
advance as far as we want, Tim has
to be there.
"He can do it, that's what we
have to let him know by getting him
the ball and proving to him that he
can score."
With the win against Oregon,
Stanford finished out the first series
of the Pac-10 season with a domi
nating sweep and proved that its
grueling preseason schedule pro
vided invaluable big-game experi
ence and intensity.
"We've got a lot of veterans, and
we have played a tough schedule,"
Montgomery said. "We have
played in a lot of tough games
where the intensity is high. And
when you get in conference games,
the intensity is always heightened.
We have pretty good mental tough
ness."
And as the players on this expe
rienced team know, any sweep in
the Pac-10 is a good accomplish
ment.
"You can easily lose a game
early in the season because you
aren't focused," Young said. "It's
always good to start off on the right
foot, especially in this conference."

always good to start off on the right
foot, especially in this conference."
