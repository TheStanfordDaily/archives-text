ford?"
That was the million-dollar
question last night as Stanford (5-8.
1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) was de
feated by the Oregon Ducks (11-2.
2-0) for the first time since 1987,63-
59.
In front of a rowdy crowd of
over 5.000. Stanford couldn't get its
offense going and the team's youth

and inexperience showed.
"We know we're not head and
shoulders above teams in the con
ference," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "And we need young
people to step up and play better."
Stanford retained the lead the
entire first half but failed to estab
lish a rhythm due to bad passes and
lack of communication. Van-
Derveer tried every combination
and permutation within the line-up
to try and find something that
clicked but chaos prevailed.
"We're not accepting this," said
freshman Lindsey Yamasaki.
"We're going to come back and
next time take it hard at them."
Stanford was handed a chance
to win the game on a silver platter
after Oregon assistant coach Fred
Litzenberger was handed a techni
cal foul. Stanford was sent to the
line three times in the final minute

hut failed to catch up. Junior guard
Milena Flores made three out of
her four shots hut freshman
Bethany Donaphin missed two
shots and a chance to tie the game.
Among Stanford's problems
was that its two top scorers, sopho
more Carolyn Moos and freshman
Lindsey Yamasaki. combined for
only 14 points. After picking up
two fouls in the first two minutes of
play. Moos sat out for the rest of
the first half and played only 11
minutes in the second. In her 13
minutes of play she managed to
tally five turnovers and only three
rebounds.
Freshman Cori Enghusen did a
fairly good job filling Moos' shoes,
but couldn't make up completely.
Enghusen was hesitant under the
basket and was outmuscled, outre
bounded and outscored by Oregon
center Jenny Mowe, who finished
with 10 points, eight rebounds and
six blocks.
Blue-chip recruit Yamasaki has
been in a slump the past couple of
games, scoring only 11 points
against Oregon State on Saturday.
Before this weekend, she averaged
14.4 points per game. Despite play
ing in front of many familiar faces
(Yamasaki hails from Oregon
City), she could not find her touch
and forced many shots.
"It's disappointing that we
weren't able to execute better of
fensively." VanDerveer said. "De
fensively, we had a lot of key peo
ple in foul trouble."
Stanford's shots were just not
falling while all of Oregon's were.
The Cardinal shot 36 percent from
the field and only 16.7 percent from
outside the circle while Oregon hit
44.4 percent of its field goals.
Oregon fought tooth and nail
for everything, diving, jumping and
running for every loose ball. Their
success lay in their ability to dou
ble-team whichever Stanford play
er had possession. The Ducks rank
first in the Pac-1() for scoring de
fense. which showed last night.
Stanford junior guard Milena
Flores hit some key shots and
scored a team high 16 points.
One positive to take from the
weekend is the play by Donaphin.
The past two games have been
break-out performances for the 6-2
forward from New York. She fin
ished with 10 points and 10 re
bounds last night and against Ore
gon State on Saturday she had 20

they fell 63-59 to the Ducks last night.
