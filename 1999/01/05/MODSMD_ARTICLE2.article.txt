The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will get new
leadership in September, when SLAC associate director
Jonathan Dorfan succeeds Burton Richter as SLAC di
rector.
Dorfan, a 23-year veteran at SLAC, currently heads
up its main project, the B-Factory, aimed at understand
ing the dominance of matter over anti-matter in the uni
verse. " I think this lab has a very exciting future and I look
forward to leading it into the next millennium." he said.
Richter, the director of SLAC for the past 15 years, an
nounced his departure in late November, citing the
"drudgery of fundraising" as his main reason for leaving
what he called "a really hard job."
In the short term, Dorfan, selected for the position last
month, said he has no major plans to make any changes in
operations at SLAC. He said. "At the moment the lab has
a particularly good near-term plan: to run the B-Factory
program as aggressively as we can."
Dorfan said he does "want to plan aggressively for fu
ture opportunities," including the next linear collider.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson dedicated
SLAC's newest collider at the B-Factory last October.
In a statement last month, Richardson praised Dor
fan's selection. He said. "Stanford has been a partner with
the Department of Energy for over 30 years and the lead

ership from Stanford has always been of the highest cal
iber. Jonathan Dorfan will continue that tradition."
Dorfan said he hopes to lead the Gamma ray Large
Area Space Telescope project at SLAC . GLAST. a pro
gram currently being planned jointly by scientists at
SLAC, NASA and others in the international scientific
community, will analyze large gamma ray bursts in space.
When complete, GLAST detectors will be sent up in
satellites. Dorfan said he believes the program will begin
within four or five years.
Other long-term plans include the upgrade of the
SPEAR-3 light source in the linear accelerator and the
development of new light sources to run off the back end
of the accelerator.
The selection of Dorfan was made by a search com
mittee comprised of physics and SLAC faculty. Sidney
Drell, professor emeritus at SLAC. described the quali
ties that the committee was looking for: "Great science, a
vision for the future, and a demonstrated capability to
manage big projects."
According to Drell. the decision was unanimous. "It
was as easy as they come." he said. "[Dorfan] has proven
that he can build big projects and lead people."
A native of South Africa, Dorfan earned his doctorate
at UC-Irvine in 1 c >76. After coming to SLAC that year, he
moved up the ranks, to research physicist in 1981, associ
ate professor in 1984, full professor in 1989 and associate
director in 19 l ) 4.
