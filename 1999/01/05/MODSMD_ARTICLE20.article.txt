# Gerhard Casper, Sixth Man
## 
### 
The white-haired, broad-shouldered man slowly
made his way through the Stanford student section last
night at the men's basketball game between the No. 4
Stanford Cardinal and the visiting Oregon Ducks.
Dressed in the very same black and red "Sixth Man" T
shirts as those students, he waved, laughed, threw his
arms up and high-fived every smiling student in sight.
And then, he climbed into the crowd.
Deep in the l()th row of this group of constantly
jumping, red-faced, screaming students, he stood.
For the entire game.

I do not believe many other university presidents
would do the same.
Gerhard Casper is indeed an incredible man. Of
course, this is to be expected. The president of a top
notch university is assumed to be brilliant. If the univer
sity is lucky, he is assumed to be well liked, as well. (As
Willy Loman would point out in "Death of a Sales
man". it is a necessity not just to be liked, but to be well
liked.) Casper is all of the above, in addition to being a
genuinely happy man. and last night I learned this on a
first-hand basis.
Last night. Casper made his second annual visit to
the Sixth Man Club's section at Maples Pavilion and he
Ux)k me along for the ride.
He couldn't take more than three steps before an

other person would pat him on the hack, smile and say
hello.
"Somebody wants to take your picture," he jokingly
told me as all the local newspaper photographers point
ed their cameras in his direction.
But the President certainly was not there for a photo
opportunity. He said that he was coming to the game
anonymously and.in fact, nobody else had been tipped
off in advance about his attendance. He was there to
watch the game and sit with his student body.
He cheered as Tim Young dunked the basketball.
He clapped along to "All Right Now." He yelled both
the "Go" and the "Stanford" as the yell leaders turned
to the section to begin cheering. And he fit in just fine.
The students loved it. So did Casper.
It wasn't that many years ago when Casper was led
to the center court of the very same pavilion during a
women's basketball game against UC-Santa Barbara.
With a friendly wave and a huge smile on his face, he
threw on a Stanford shirt and became the next president
of the university.
The Cardinal won that game, he pointed out to me
last night. Not a bad start.
Now. however. Casper is held in even higher regard
by the screaming fans of Maples Pavilion.
"This is home," he said. "It's a much different feeling
now." he added, pointing out that he now knows a lot of
the people in attendance and a lot of people know him.
Talking with many of the students surrounding him,
Casper discussed everything from the game to some of
the classes these students were planning on taking dur
ing the upcoming quarter. At halftime. he agreed to be
interviewed by the local sports radio station, and upon
making his way to the other side of the court, was greet
ed equally enthusiastically by the alumni section.

in cheering on the men's basketball team last night in Maples Pavilion.

But rather than remain on the
side of the court that contributes an
unbelievable amount of money to
the university, Casper was right back
in the very same spot of the student
section by the tip-off of the second
half.
Standing.
And as the game clock dwindled
down, the President looked to the
scoreboard and smiled at Stanford's
comfortable lead.
"1 guess I did my job, eh?" he
laughed.
You've done far more. President
Casper.
Sports editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly columns appear on Tuesdays,
would like to thank TM6 for helping
President Casper to his seat last night.
