# Stanford gets piece of $60 million grant
## Money goes for semiconductor wiring work 
### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
The semiconductor industry and the De
partment of Defense have granted Stanford
researchers funds to development new semi
conductor technologies.
The grant money will support studies of
"interconnect" technology — the wiring that
connects the transistors on a microchip — as
well as "design and test" issues. Additional
funding will support the creation of research
groups at seven universities, for a total grant
of $60 million.
The principal use of semiconductors is in
the fabrication of solid-state, often miniatur
ized electronic components and integrated
circuits.
"Semiconductors improve your life. If you
use a computer at all. the heart of the comput
er, all those processors are semiconductor
chips. In appliances, everything you use in
your kitchen has semiconductor processors.
They control cars and industrial machinery
and so on," said William J. Dally, professor of
electrical engineering and computer science.
According to Dally, "the real problem with
semiconductors right now is that we are limit
ed by the wires — they are the bottleneck in
terms of speed and organizing systems. It used
to be the transistors, the switches, but now it's
about making better use of the wires. We're
going to work on understanding the wires and
optimizing their use."
Giovanni De Micheli. also a professor of
electrical engineering, will study "design and
test" issues. "Our basic goal for the design and
test research is to enable giga-scale integra
tion — achieving efficient design of one bil
lion transistor chips. Our specific object is to
provide designers with tools that allow differ

ent classes of application including embedded
systems like automobile and aircraft control
and computing."
The industry funding is a "new thing," ac
cording to Dally. "Funding is usually from the
U.S. government. My experience with indus
try is that it is fickle and sometimes they have
a bad year and decide they can't fund things
anymore."
De Micheli considers the funding less un
usual, "We have typically received funding
from both government and industry."
The results of the research are subject to a
number of intellectual property licensing
agreements as part of the contract, which
grants the Semiconductor Industry Associa
tion exclusive rights.
The research will be led by the Focus Cen
ter Research Program, which will consist of
six national centers.
The first two contracts for those research
centers were awarded to the UC-Berkeley
and Georgia Tech.
The principal investigators from Stanford
are De Micheli and Dally as well as John C.
Bravman, professor of materials science and
engineering, and three additional electrical
engineering professors: David A. B. Miller,
Krishna Saraswat and S. Simon Wong.
According to Craig R. Barrett, president
and chief executive officer of Intel Corpora
tion and chair of the SI A s technology strate
gy committee, "The Focus Center program is
the centerpiece of our new long-range plan to
maintain the industry's growth by making
sure we address the technological changes
that surface during the next decade."
According to De Micheli the research is
"long term" and the grant will last for three
years, although researchers hope for renewal
at that time.
