# Texas ends Card's hope for third straight title
## 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
LONG BEACH, Calif. —To under
stand the emotions of the Stanford
women's volleyball team after its loss
to Texas in the third round of the
NCAA Tournament, one needed to
look no further than the eyes of Kerri
Walsh.
For, a split second after the three
time All American took her last swing
of the season — a white bullet that
landed just inches beyond the base
line — the look in Walsh's glassy eyes
captured the essence of the moment
better than any words ever could.
Those eyes, which once witnessed
back-to-back national titles, now
echoed complete disbelief.
For Walsh, and every other mem
ber of the Stanford team, the Texas
match was the first postseason loss
she had ever played in, adding to the
shock of the moment. It seemed a
complete nightmare.
Unfortunately for Stanford, how
ever, this setting was all too real.
And the 199K season, in which the
Cardinal actually exceeded the ex
pectations of many by winning a fifth
consecutive Pacific 10 Conference
title, was over.
In many ways, the Texas match
was a fitting end to the year for head
coach Don Shaw's young squad.
Stanford fought hard throughout the
match, even after losing the first two
games. The Cardinal won the third
game and had a 10-4 lead in the
fourth, hut simply ran out of gas (and
healthy bodies). The Longhorns ral
lied in game four and pulled off a 16-
14 victory, ending any hope of bring

ing a third straight NCAA Champi
onship hack to the Farm.
"The Texas match was a case of us
not having quite enough," Shaw said.
"We were in a bad situation physical
ly, and lost some ball control and fire
power that could have helped us
win."
Despite a long list of injuries to
key players such as sophomore setter
Robyn Lewis and junior outside hit
ter Jaimi Gregory, Stanford had ar
rived in Long Beach for the Moun
tain Regional semifinals with a lot of
confidence. The Cardinal was coming
off a pair of victories against South
east Missouri State and Notre Dame
at Maples Pavilion.
Shaw had implemented a new
lineup against the Fighting Irish that
featured freshman Tara Conrad as a
starting middle blocker, which
proved extremely effective.
That same rotation started the
Texas match, and Conrad's tough
serving earned the Cardinal a fairly
comfortable lead early in the first
game. That lead did not last long,
however, as Texas climbed right back
to within one point late in the game.
Stanford countered the Longhorn
rally, and with a 14-13 lead, sent se
nior captain Sarah Neal to the service
line with a chance to finish the first.
Shockingly, Neal's service attempt
sailed wide of the court, and the
Longhorns averted defeat.
Texas did not hesitate to capitalize
on the uncharacteristic mistake, scor
ing three quick points and taking the
opening frame, 16-14.
Shortly after the first, Shaw and
his coaching staff discovered they had
lost far more than the opening game

— Neal had suffered a torn posterior
cruciate ligament in her knee. I*he se
nior team leader would play through
pain later in the match, but was not
the same defensive presence in the
back row due to the injury.

■ Dec. 10: I exasdef. Stanford, 16-14
15-5.4-15.16-14.

The Cardinal came out complete
ly deflated in game two and Texas
rolled. The Stanford block all but
evaporated, and the Longhorns' bal
anced attack, led by Demetria Sance,
Katie Austin and Erin Aldrich. ran
away with a 15-5 blowout.
Considering its huge list of injuries
and lack of momentum, the Cardinal
appeared to be dead in the water.
But. as Don Shaw had said head
ing into the NCAA Tournament, one
can never underestimate the heart of
a champion.
Stanford came out of the locker
room with fire, and looked like two
time defending champs as it ran away
with the third game 15-4.
The Cardinal carried that momen
tum into the fourth game, and got out
to a 10-4 lead. Just when it seemed
that Stanford would force a fifth
game, the Longhorns went on a 10-0
run and were one point away from
victory, 14-10.
Once again, however, the Cardi
nal rallied every ounce of effort it had
left, and tied the score at 14. After a
grueling series of sideouts, Texas fi
nally slammed home the two winning
points and closed the door on the
Stanford comeback.
"You always hate to lose," Shaw

said. "But it was good that we fought
hard and almost pulled it out. We just
kind of came to the end of the road."
Had Stanford completed the un
thinkable and pulled out the match
against Texas, the Cardinal would
have faced eventual national champi
on Long Beach State the following
night.
"With all the injuries we had, the
next match against Long Beach
would have been really tough for us,"
Shaw said. "With Jaimi out, injuries
to Sarah and Robyn that would have
probably kept them out, and an un
healthy Kerri Walsh, it may be lucky
that we didn't play that match. In
stead, we ended on a relatively posi
tive note."
Walsh, who was bothered by the
injury to her right shoulder that kept
her below 1 (X) percent for the entire
season, was still able to post 22 kills to
lead both teams. A week later, Walsh
was named an AVCA Ail-American
for the third time in as many years.
Despite the disappointing third
round exit, all was not lost in the eyes
of Shaw. Several weeks after the
match, the Stanford head coach, who
earned his 2(X)th Pac-10 victory and
4(K)th overall this year, displayed an
impressive sense of perspective on
this season and the future of the Stan
ford volleyball program.
"I feel very good about this sea
son." Shaw said. "We won the Pac-10
for the fifth straight year when no one
expected us to. Our young team
learned a lot over the course of the
year and we got a couple tournament
wins under our belts.

Junior Kerri Walsh and freshmen Sara Sandrik and Michelle Cham
bers (left to right against Fresno State) led the Cardinal to its fifth
straight conference crown before being eliminated by Texas in the
third round of the NCAAs.
"We head into this offseason with
a hunger that we haven't had in a
eouple years. ITiis is the first taste of
defeat in the tournament for all of
our players."
Nine months from now. Shaw
could very easily be talking about
one of the best teams in Stanford his
tory. Neal is the only player not com
ing back next fall, and will be re
placed bv an unbelievable crop of
new talent.
"1 am sure that our younger play
ers will improve," Shaw added. "We
will have Lindsey Yamasaki [who
took this season off to focus on bas
ketball] and a great freshman class
next season, so we will have our
depth back. There is no doubt in my
mind that we will be back in the hunt
as a national title contender."
