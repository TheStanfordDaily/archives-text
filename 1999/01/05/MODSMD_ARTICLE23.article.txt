# Walsh perserveres despite shouldering injuries

LONG BEACH. Calif. — For Kerri
Walsh, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team's three time All-
American, the feelings after the
Cardinal's loss to Texas in the
round of 16 in the NCAA Tourna
ment had to be particularly
poignant.
For one. Walsh had been a piv
otal component of Stanford's pre
vious two national title teams. The
Final Four MVP as a freshman in
1996, Walsh was immediately
swept into elite status among the
nation's best, and consequently
shouldered with a huge portion of
the Cardinal's offensive produc
tion.
With star players like Kristin
Folkl and Lisa Sharpley at her side,
however, that task was a little more
bearable. With the departure of the
Class of '98, Walsh was thrown into
a leadership role and surrounded
by a group of young and inexperi
enced players.
Heading into the 1998 season,
the Stanford star outside hitter had
all the tools and resolve to manage
her new responsibility.
There was just one huge prob
lem: she was never at full health
throughout the entire season. Not

once.
It is pretty difficult to imagine
the frustration that such an injury
causes an athlete like Walsh, con
sidering all the hard work during
the nine months leading into the
season and her past success.
Walsh fought through the in
jury. adjusting her game to utilize
superior placement on her swings
rather than sheer power, and post
ed huge hitting numbers through
out the year.
Time and again, she came
through with kills in the most
clutch moments.
Which is exactly why it was all
the more shocking when her final
attempt against Texas flew beyond
the baseline and finalized the
Longhorn's upset.
None of this is to say that Walsh
felt more pain after the Stanford
loss, as every member of the team
had the same level of commitment
invested in the season.
Maybe just a little different
pain.
The kind of pain that only an in
jured star knows.
For, once she had reached such
a high level of play so early in her
career, Kerri Walsh's body and
mind must have grown to always
expect similar results.
Hut, against Texas and countless

other opponents over the course of
the season, her weakened shoulder
simply said no, even though her
mind undoubtedly refused to ac
cept that as an answer.
Yet, such is the nature of sports.
Athletes get injured. Injuries ruin
seasons. But this too shall pass, and
Walsh will hopefully be at 100 per
cent by mid-spring.
From that point on. things
should return to normal for the
free-swinging Walsh.
"Kerri had a great year," said
Stanford coach Don Shaw. "But I
still believe she can improve an un
believable amount. The key for her
is getting healthy. When she is
healthy, she can be an absolutely
dominating player in the nation.
"If she really dedicates herself,
she can be so much better."
Improvement of her offensive
production alone is scary enough.
But what Shaw would really love to
see from the three-year starter is an
expanded leadership capacity.
"From a leadership standpoint,
there was a huge void left this sea
son by the graduated seniors,"
Shaw said. "Somebody is going to
have to step up next season. Sarah
Neal did a good job this year as our
captain, but she will be gone in the

juries to prevent her from garnering her third straight All-America
honors.
