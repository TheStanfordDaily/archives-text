## Stanford home page gets new look 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Starting Thursday, the Cardinal
home page won't be blue anymore.
In an effort to make finding infor
mation easier, the current page, with
its bright blue background, will be re
placed by a multi-colored, compact
design that University officials hope

will he easier to navigate.
"We heard feedback saying it was
getting harder and harder to find
things," said Terry Shepard. director
of University communications.
"Trying to give people too much
in (the page] can he overwhelming.
We wanted to simplify," said Alan
Acosta. director of Stanford Univer
sity News Service, which manages the

editorial content of the page.
First launched Dec. 23. the page
can currently be viewed by following
a link on the existing home page.
Alter the change is completed, the
address for the Stanford home page,
www.stanford.edu, will remain the
same.
Eight main links comprise the
heart of the new page. Listed, from

top to bottom, on the page are teach
ing, research, students, administra
tion, admission, alumni, medical cen
ter and athletics. The page also has
additional headings located less
prominently in the upper left corner.
"The eight main categories are de
signed to reflect what the University
is about," said Andy Krackov, man
aging editor of the site, noting that
even the order of the categories was
scrutinized.
The page's designers also com
piled statistics on which links were
frequently selected, and used that
data to choose and arrange the head
ings.
Krackov said discussions were
held with various I Jniversity officials,
including representatives from each
of Stanford's seven schools, in an ef
fort to make the Web site as useful
and practical as possible.
"We've been working on it since
the summer, meeting with people,
getting ideas, hashing it out," said
Acosta. He said that feedback to the
new design has been "generally posi
tive."
San Francisco-based graphic artist
Janet Covey assisted in the design,
and Information Technology Sys
tems and Services are responsible for
technical oversight.
New features on the page include
a link to an alphabetical index of
more than I XX) Stanford Web sites
