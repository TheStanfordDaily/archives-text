Thanks to newly stringent federal regulations,
the amount Stanford can give to faculty and staff
to subsidize their children's college tuition will de
crease from $10,560 to $4,(XH) per child. The
change, announced at the Dec. 3 Faculty Senate
meeting, will affect only those faculty and staff
members hired after Sept. 1.
"All current employees are grandfathered in
for our current program," said James Franklin, as
sociate vice president in the University's Office of
Total Compensation.
The federal government used to put one dollar
into the tuition credit fund for every two provided
by the University. A 1996 act discontinued that
practice, although it allowed the University's prtv

gram to remain untaxed.
For fiscal 1998, Stanford's tuition grant pro
gram gave out $5.4 million, $1.8 million of which
was federal money.
The average amount spent per student was
$6,816. although all 786 participating students
were eligible for up to $10,650. or half of Stan
ford's tuition.
The funds are available to all faculty and to
staff who have been at Stanford for more than five
years. They may' be used for up to four years of tu
ition at an accredited university.
Provost Condoleezza Rice noted that Stan
ford's program had been more generous than that
of many other colleges and universities.
"We've been in the high end both in amount
and breadth." she said.
She added, however, that the benefit is "used

by [onlyj 7.5 percent of the population in a year."
In response to faculty queries. Rice said that it
would he impractical for Stanford to commit addi
tional University funds to keep the benefits at the
previous level, noting that the program is already
"the third most expensive benefit we have."
The newly refurbished program also includes
"up to $2,(XX) annually for employee career devel
opment," said Alan Garber, chair of the Commit
tee on Faculty and Staff Benefits and professor of
medicine.
Those funds are for "accredited, degree-relat
ed education," said Franklin. He added that he ex
pects the use of the career development funds will
be very low.
According to Robert Flanagan, former com-
mittee chair and professor at the
Graduate School of Business, the
committee's main worry in changing
the plan was that it would he detri
mental to recruiting.
"This program is more important

for staff [recruiting] than for faculty
[recruiting], because it gives us the
edge in benefit packages over other
Silicon Valley companies," Flana
gan said.
He added that the program is not
as beneficial to students as it might
appear to be, because many schools
decrease a student's financial aid by
the amount he or she receives.
