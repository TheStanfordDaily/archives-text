Stanford University ranks 10th
nationwide and above many histori
cally black universities in a list of the
best universities and colleges for
African Americans, according to a
list compiled by Black Enterprise
Magazine.
Stanford University has by far the
smallest percentage of African
American students of colleges and
universities that made the top 10.
Black Enterprise lists Stanford's per
centage of African-American stu
dents at 5 percent. All other schools

in the top 10 had student bodies com
posed of at least <S4 percent African
Americans.
According to Marjorie Whigham-
Desir. senior editor of Black Enter
prise and co-author of the story,
Stanford's presence on the list was
not unexpected. "The schools on this
list are not that different from schools
on other lists, except there may be a
few more historically black universi
ties."
"Was I surprised that Stanford
was on the list? No. Was I surprised
at where Stanford was on the list?
