# Stanford ranked No.10 for blacks
## Farm figures high in magazine survey 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
Stanford University ranks 10th
nationwide and above many histori
cally black universities in a list of the
best universities and colleges for
African Americans, according to a
list compiled by Black Enterprise
Magazine.
Stanford University has by far the
smallest percentage of African
American students of colleges and
universities that made the top 10.
Black Enterprise lists Stanford's per
centage of African-American stu
dents at 5 percent. All other schools

in the top 10 had student bodies com
posed of at least <S4 percent African
Americans.
According to Marjorie Whigham-
Desir. senior editor of Black Enter
prise and co-author of the story,
Stanford's presence on the list was
not unexpected. "The schools on this
list are not that different from schools
on other lists, except there may be a
few more historically black universi
ties."
"Was I surprised that Stanford
was on the list? No. Was I surprised
at where Stanford was on the list?
Maybe."
Many colleges on Black Enter
prise's list tradtionally compete for
the same students as Stanford.
Georgetown University ranks 11,
Harvard ranks 28, and Yale was
ranked at 41.
"This confirms that there are
great colleges and that these colleges
are still great if you are African
American," said Whigham-Desir.
Whigham-D6sir and co-author
Thomas LaVeist surveyed 987 of the
3,2(X) colleges and universities in the
United States. In order to be sur
veyed for the list, a college had to
have a student body at least 1.5 per
cent African American, or the school
had to offer programs that the au
thors judged to be of "significant in
terest" to African-American stu
dents. The Black Enterprise website
did not give any further criteria used
to rank the colleges.
Whigham-Desir said that the arti
cle is meant to help, among others,
"parents who are assessing what
schools have to offer and what type of
environments [schools have]."
The list sought to find schools with
"environments African-American
students can thrive in" Whigham-
Desir said. In order to judge a
school's environment, she inter
viewed faculty and students at

schools across the country. Among
those interviewed were Stanford ju
nior Charles Hudson and Provost
Condoleezza Rice.
Jan Barker Alexander, director of
the Black Community Services Cen
ter, said that Stanford was recognized
for its "resources and inclusion of
African Americans across the
board."
Stanford senior Shana Johnson
agrees, "1 think that Stanford fosters
a very close-knit environment for the
black community. There are a lot of
different programs and centers."
Hudson was one of six African-
American students featured on Black
Enterprise's cover. Whigham-Desir
pointed to Hudson's position as co
president of the Blyth Fund (a stu
dent-managed investment fund) as
evidence of the leadership roles held
by African American students at
Stanford.
"It is a significant position to
have," Whigham-Desir said, "and it is
a good thing for African Americans
to hold positions of leadership."
Alexander agreed. Two issues she
identified to further improve the cli
mate for African Americans at Stan
ford were faculty review and a higher
rate of tenure for African American
faculty. Alexander added that those
issues are not unique to Stanford.
Spelman College headed the mag
azine's list. Rounding out the top five
were Morehouse College, Florida
A&M, Clark Atlanta and Howard.
