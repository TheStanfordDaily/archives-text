# Marble floors, pizza kitchen featured in refurbished facility
## Roble, Lag dining hall reopens 
### Ryan Kalemher Contributing writer 
Alter many tribulations and multiple
delays, students living in Roble and Lagu
nita Courts have their own operational
dining hall.
Part of Stanford's continuing Capital
Improvement Project, the dining hall was
originally scheduled to open along with
the renovated Lagunita Court dorms at
the beginning of autumn quarter. The din
ing hall's premiere was delayed until Oct.
15 in order to open the dorms in time for
incoming freshmen. Subsequently, the
opening was postponed to Nov. 20.
The long-awaited event finally oc
curred on the first day of winter quarter,
the date that Housing and Dining Services
Director Keith Guy called in November
"the last possible day that the facility
would be open."
The opening of the new dining hall was
welcomed by students who eat in the din
■> halls that had absorbed the dispos

sessed Roble and Lagunita Court students
last quarter.

quarter, partly due to the large numbers

of Lag and Roble people who ate
there regularly," said Tony Doric, a
sophomore living in Florence
Moore Hall.
Roble and Lagunita Court stu
dents received their dining hall
warmly, though with reservations.
"It's more spacious, hut it's also
more impersonal," said junior Deb
bie Liao, a Roble resident. ' The
kitchen is nicer, which makes the
food seem better, but I think it's
only psychological."

with a special pizza oven, the Pacific
Wok stir-fry, and a "Make Your
Own" area. For sake of conve
nience, beverage stations are locat
ed in the dining halls themselves.
Though the layout is entirely
new, the facilities retain Lagunita

Court's trademark high, vaulted
ceilings and chandeliers. Separate
dining rooms for Roble and Laguni
ta Court students branch off of a
marble-floored kitchen, and a cen
tral hall contains bathrooms.
Roble students expressed dis
pleasure with the layout, however.
"It's a long walk from Roble to
the dining hall," said Liao. "Since
we don't have keys that open Lag
doors, we are forced to walk all the
way around the back of the build
ing."
The Dining Services staff has em
braced the new facility.
"I love it," said chef and produc
tion manager Phillip Ross. "It's all
been very thoughtfully put together.
There were no corners cut."
When asked about the length of
the delay, Ross said, "it was like fine
wine — we didn't want to rush, and
it was very much worth the wait. It
was better to wait until the dining
hall was finished properly."
