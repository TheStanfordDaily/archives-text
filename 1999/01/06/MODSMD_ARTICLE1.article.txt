## Roble, Lag dining hall reopens 
### Ryan Kalemher Contributing writer 
Alter many tribulations and multiple
delays, students living in Roble and Lagu
nita Courts have their own operational
dining hall.
Part of Stanford's continuing Capital
Improvement Project, the dining hall was
originally scheduled to open along with
the renovated Lagunita Court dorms at
the beginning of autumn quarter. The din
ing hall's premiere was delayed until Oct.
15 in order to open the dorms in time for
incoming freshmen. Subsequently, the
opening was postponed to Nov. 20.
The long-awaited event finally oc
curred on the first day of winter quarter,
the date that Housing and Dining Services
Director Keith Guy called in November
"the last possible day that the facility
would be open."
The opening of the new dining hall was
welcomed by students who eat in the din
■> halls that had absorbed the dispos

sessed Roble and Lagunita Court students
last quarter.
"It was painful to eat in Flo Mo last

quarter, partly due to the large numbers
