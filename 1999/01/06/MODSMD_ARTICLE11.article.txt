## Officials vow to maintain embargo Clinton announces new Cuban contact policies 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — While vowing
unbending hostility toward the Cuban gov
ernment. President Clinton today announced
measures to increase contact between
Cubans and Americans and to allow a signif
icant expansion of cash transfers from pri
vate Americans to needy Cubans.
The initiative also contemplates U.S. food
sales to Cuba on a limited basis for the first
time as well as direct mail service and an
expansion of direct charter flights.
"These steps are designed to help the
Cuban people without strengthening the
Cuban government." Clinton said in a state
ment.
After officials disclosed the initiative
Monday. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.,
said the measures were part of an adminis
tration attempt to mask its "true intention of
normalizing relations with the Cuban dicta
tor," Fidel Castro.
But a senior administration official insist
ed none of the initiatives involve any soften
ing of the 38-year old trade embargo on Cas
tro's Cuba.
Ros-Lehtinen's Cuban-American col
league, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.,
said he will oppose any food sales to Cuba on
grounds they are illegal.
The administration says any such sales
would be limited to entities independent of
the government and therefore would be
legal.
The measures build on the Cuba Democ
racy Act of 1992, which tightened the U.S.
embargo but also called for increased
exchanges between Cubans and Americans.
Progress in people-to-people contacts
have been hampered by political setbacks,
including the mass exodus of Cubans toward
Florida in 1994 and the shooting down by
two Cuban MiG jet fighters of four unarmed,

Miami-based planes north of the island in
1996.
The visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba a
year ago has made it easier for the adminis
tration to introduce innovations. Officials
insist the policy shifts help promote democ
racy without helping Castro.
A year ago. all cash transfers from U.S.
residents to needy Cubans were barred. In
March. Clinton reinstated the remittances.
Clinton is expected to ease that restriction
further, permitting any U.S. resident to send
money up to the $ 1.2(H) annual limit.
