# U.S. jets engage Iraqi planes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Four U.S.
fighter jets fired missiles at Iraqi planes
today in the "no-fly" zone over southern
Iraq, a senior U.S. administration official
said. It was the first American-Iraqi air-to
air confrontation in more than six years.
The U.S. missiles apparently failed to hit
the Iraqi planes, although one Iraqi plane
was believed to have crashed, apparently
after running out of fuel, the official said.
The official Iraqi News Agency said
Iraqi planes "confronted and clashed with
the aggressive British and American air
craft" before "the aggressive aircraft with
drew. All of our air force planes returned to
base safely."
The American planes — two Air Force
F-15 strike aircraft and two Navy F-14 fight
ers — returned safely after the confronta
tion. the U.S. official said, speaking on con
dition of anonymity. The Navy planes were
from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.
The incident, which happened at about
2:30 a.m. EST, marked an escalation of ten
sions between Iraq and the United States
and Britain over enforcing the "no-fly"
zones in northern and southern Iraq. Iraq

considers the restrictions illegal and has
vowed to defy them.
President Clinton has said U.S. and
British forces will continue banning Iraqi
flights in the restricted zones, arguing that
Saddam Hussein's military still represents a
threat to minority Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south.
David Leavy, spokesman for the White
House National Security Council, said
today, "The president has made it clear we
will enforce the no-fly zones vigorously.
The Iraqi violations are at their own peril."
A senior Pentagon official said the air
to-air altercation was the first in Iraq since
Dec. 27. 1992, when a U.S. F-16 shot down
an Iraqi MiG-25.
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
there were two separate incidents 15 min
utes apart, one involving U.S. F-15s and
Iraqi MiG-255, the other U.S. F-14s and
MiG-255. U.S. warplanes fired a total of six
missiles during the two incidents.
All told, military officials counted eight
separate violations of the no-fly zone today.
The Iraqi planes turned quickly after
being fired upon. Bacon said. "They

escaped without being shot down."
At a Pentagon briefing, Bacon defended
the accuracy of the missiles.
"Air-to-air combat is an extremely
engaging and demanding type of war," he
said, adding there were still several
unknowns, including the distance between
the aircraft when the missiles were fired.
Bacon said there were reports that a
MiG crashed because it ran out of gas. "We
believe that to be the case but we do not
have certainty on that right now," he said.
Prior to today, there had been two inci
dents in the no-fly zones — neither involv
ing air-to-air combat — since the U.S. and
British airstrikes of Dec. 16 to 19.
On Dec. 28, U.S. warplanes fired on an
Iraqi surface-to-air missile battery in the
northern zone after being fired on from the
ground. On Dec. 30, U.S. warplanes hit an
anti-aircraft battery in the south.
Saddam announced earlier in a state
ment read on state-run Iraq television that
the no-fly zones imposed on his country
have no basis in international law and
vowed that Iraq will fight violations of its
airspace "with all its courage and bravery."
