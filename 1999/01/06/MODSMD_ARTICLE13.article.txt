WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Impeach
ment trial proceedings against President
Clinton will begin Thursday in the Senate,
Majority Leader Trent Lott announced
today, saying he hopes for a conclusion that
is "fair and hopefully quick."
Lott. R-Miss., said he had met earlier in
the day with Senate Democratic leader
Tom Daschle and Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who will preside over the first
presidential impeachment trial in 130 years.
Lott offered no other details of the trial,
in which the Senate will rule on two articles
of impeachment the House approved Dec.
19 and decide whether Clinton will be
removed from office.
White House lawvers, who were not

privy to the discussions on Capitol Hill,
were left scratching their heads. "It leaves
them in the position of preparing for all
eventualities," said presidential press secre
tary Joe Lockhart. "In general, we'd like to
know which direction we're going in hut we
understand the process."
The articles allege that Clinton commit
ted perjury and obstructed justice in an
attempt to cover up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
"We have a constitutional duty here. It
is a very serious one. It is one we must carry
forward," said Lott. "We will do our very
best to do this in a proper way."
Lott spoke for only a few moments, and
took no questions from reporters, leaving

unclear precisely what events will occur
Thursday and what the timetable will be for
Clinton's trial.
Several sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said Senate leaders are dis
cussing a plan under which Rehnquist on
Thursday will administer a constitutionally
prescribed oath to the senators, who will sit
as jurors. Members of the House who are
designated to present the evidence would
formally outline the articles of impeach
ment later that day, assuming they are
authorized to do so in a House vote sched
uled Wednesday.
After that, a pause in the proceedings is
possible, while both sides draft legal papers,
sources added.
