# Settlement near for black farmers
## 
### 
ALBANY, Ga. (AP) — As
many as 3,(XX) black farmers across
the country who say they were
unfairly denied government loans
and subsidies could share $375 mil
lion under a settlement being
worked out Tuesday with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
Under the proposed deal, which
would end a racial discrimination
lawsuit filed in 1997, the farmers
would get tax-free payments of
$S(),(HK) each, and their government
debts would be forgiven.
Negotiators for both sides were
meeting with a federal judge in
Washington on Tuesday afternoon
to work out the final details.
One of the farmers who would
benefit is Willie Head, who grows
tobacco and vegetables on his 150-
acre farm about 2(H) miles south of
Atlanta. In 1992, he complained
that the government had discrimi
nated by denying him loans.
He plans to use his share of the
settlement to pay off a $42,(KK) lien
on his land and buy seed and sup
plies, but that means the money will
be gone by the time he plants his
1999 crops.
"I am happy to see this come to
a conclusion, but I am not happy

about the way it concluded," Head
said. "It's not going to solve our
problems."
Head said his situation is typical
among black farmers, many of
whom have been "farming with the
tips of our fingernails." The average
debt for farmers involved in the
lawsuit is $75,000 to $100,000.
The lawsuit was filed by 1.000
farmers. As many as 2,(KK) other
farmers are expected to join in the
settlement.
The case, which was supposed to
go to trial Feb. 1, covers claims from
1983 — the year the Reagan admin
istration disbanded the depart
ment's office of civil rights — to
1997, the year after the office was
restored.
The deal would be significantly
higher than the $15,(XX)-per-farmer
offer the agency made this summer.
But it still is far less than the $3 bil
lion farmers initially sought.
Some plaintiffs, hoping for a
larger settlement, wanted the case
to go to trial but didn't press the
issue because they feared the Agri
culture Department would appeal
and delay the case for years.
As it is, many young, rural blacks
have given up on farming, said

Head, a third-generation farmer
who has a business degree.
"It has devastated me in mv
career and also the younger genera
tion like my son." he said. "He does
not want to farm now, so it means
there won't be anyone to carry on
the legacy."
Charles Harris. 53, a plaintiff
from Leesburg, 10 miles north of
Albany, said one of his live sons was
interested in farming until Harris
tried to get a loan after filing for
bankruptcy.
"He's disillusioned," Harris
said. "Now he's having doubts.
The others don't seem to want to
be on the farm on account of what
1 go through, and I don't blame
them."
Harris, who has been farming for
lf> years, said white farmers always
seem to be able to get government
help when they have similar trou
bles.
"White farmers who started
when I did are well off. They've
done well," he said. "They went
through the same steps as me and a
lot of them wondered why I wasn't
progressing. 1 know how to farm.
Every time a tractor rolls, I'm on
it."
