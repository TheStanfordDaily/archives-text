## Editorial Stanford's new home 
### 
New Web page is
suited for campus
and Silicon Valley

£YI ARTIN'o TOMORROW, the
hiinie page on many World Wide
browsers around campus will
liave an entirely new look. The new Stan
lord home page has a bright appearance
and a streamlined organization, making it
imrteninbly better thnn its predecessor from
lufth a pragmatic and an aesthetic view
point.
. In fact, the only flaw of the new home
page might be that it is long overdue. Some
h>ve complained about older pages
bjxjiuse of their blue backgrounds — simi
l;fv to the color of a certain Stanford rival
anil their cluttered layouts. Even the official
Stanford seal, placed prominently at the top
oOhe old page, was askew. Taken together,
th£«e defects resulted in a poor online pre
senilation from a world-class research uni
versity.
10' hat said, the new pages are excellent.
Hiey do not pump out full motion video or
showcase the newest in interactive Web
technologies, but. more importantly, they
ate"easy to use. They are also easy on the
ej'<s: the new white background projects a
softer. more modern look.
''.A well-designed, clean interface, such as
that found on the new pages, is vital for
qtiick. efficient navigation around the site.
Kjr example, the old main index page
avowed browsers to click on a dizzying
arfny of 55 hypertext links. Just reading all
the-lines of text to decide where to go took
alsignificant amount of time. In compari
son. the new site has only 17 links, most of
which are short, general categories such as
"Htsearch" or "Students."
* - J digging deeper into the new site, these

positive changes become more evident; the
emphasis placed on streamlining content
makes the information more accessible.
With the old pages, after clicking on a topic
link such as "leaching" from the main
page, users were presented with a three
page list of links to teaching-related pages.
With the redesigned pages, these subtopics
now lit nicely onto a single screen. By pre
senting users with both a one-page summa
ry of the subtopics and, as an alternative, a
"Quick Search" box alongside, users need
not scroll down and read through the entire
page before deciding if they are on the right
path to the desired information.
In addition, several smaller improve
ments have been made during the redesign.
Each of the topic pages that are linked from
the main Stanford page now have small "Of
Note" boxes containing a bit of news per
taining to that specific topic. After scanning
over these blurbs, users can click to get the
full story.
Also at the top of each of the redesigned
pages are navigational controls which allow
the user to jump directly to other topics.
The few older Stanford pages that had such
navigational controls forced users to scroll
to the bottom of the page to hunt for them.
Another improvement is the new, unified
navigational header, which is linked to a
concise map of the entire site.
Overall, the new Stanford home page is
a welcome change, but the Stanford Uni
versity News Service, which is responsible
for the editorial content of the site, should
take care to continue revamping pages and
keeping the content fresh. Further, a few
pages linked to from the main Stanford
page, ironically the "Computing" page, for
instance, still need to be updated to match
the new design.
I t lily, the Stanford home page should be
something everybody can take pride in. In
this case, change is definitely good. Now.
the Stanford seal is straight and cardinal red
just as it should be.
