## Going home to Small Town, USA 
### 
I LIVE IN Small Town,
Calif. There are
numerous cities like
mine in the United
States — for instance.
Small Town. Utah. Small
Town, Ohio, and Small
Town, Conn. A traveler

can find Small Towns all across the nation.
If you come from a Small Town, you
may be able to empathize with the bland
nature of my holiday break. Many of you.
however, hail from large metropolitan areas
with real culture and real crime. For those
urbanites out there, I offer the following
description of Small Town. Calif.
Small ( own charm
Everyone has heard that God gave us his
only son to die for our sins and that fibbing
makes the Baby Jesus cry. but how many
people know that bombing abortion clinics
is a God-given right? Baffling religious
scholars around the world, the good Chris
tians from Small Town have somehow man
aged to reconcile homicidal pro-life convic
tions with the peaceful pro-love tenets of
the New Testament. In spite of my pious
upbringing, I am not sure whether I prefer
the random, senseless nature of urban vio
lence or the premeditated and cold-blooded
character of rural "love."
This religious fervor, however, is not the
most interesting feature of my home town.
On the contrary, the city has the intriguing
property of being in the middle of nowhere,
yet in between two other cities that some
one would actually want to visit. The only
reason people stop in Small Town is to fill
up their gas tanks.
"I think 1 stopped there once at the gas

station next to a McDonald's — you know
the one?" you say vacantly as I tell you
about my home town. I nod blankly. You
see, I do not know which gas station you are
talking about, but I nod anyway. That is my
charming Small Town way. If you asked me
about a more distinctive landmark — say,
the neon billboard for Joe's Cafe with the
30-foot coffee cup — then maybe I would
not have to fib and make the Baby Jesus
cry.
Small Town entertainment
While most large cities boast flashy
downtown strips strewn with glamorous
nightspots. Small Town nightlife centers
around a two-square-block area with three
coffee houses. The coffee is bad, the clien
tele barely pubescent, but up-and-coming
punk bands love to play at these joints. The
local law enforcement frets about these con
gregations of anti-authoritarian adoles
cents, but luckily these young hooligans are
easily appeased by the miniature golf recre
ational center down the street.
With a town that offers all this, most
locals choose to stay at home. From what I
can tell, youths in other cities dress up and
go out nightly during the holiday break,
engaging in exhilarating activities and
meaningful social interactions. In contrast,
the interactions I have typically require
nothing more than my pajamas and a
remote control. Cable television, along with
air conditioning, has turned the agricultural
people of a boring desert town into a collec
tion of sedentary homebodies with flat der
rieres, low tolerances for heat and overde
veloped thumb muscles.
When I am not lost in the folds of my
couch with the remote control lost in the

folds of my belly, I do what most Small
Town folk do: I eat. Corn Nuts, beef jerky
and French bread pizzas are the snacks of
choice. Occasionally 1 will indulge in a
microwaveable burrito.
Small Town tourism
Contrary to popular belief, there are
some tourist attractions in my home town
that draw in a few outsiders every year.
These attractions are rather unique and are
a great source of town pride. How many
towns include fields and fields of grazing
cows? Quite a few. But how many cow-rear
ing towns lay claim to the world's largest
hermetic thermometer? You should come
to my hometown and find out what the local
temperature is. Maybe it will be 72 degrees,
or maybe it will be 79 degrees — who really
knows? The fun never stops with the giant
thermometer.
There are other reasons to come to
Small Town. Oil barons love to vacation in
places like this; oil was discovered a few
decades ago in the rapidly decaying area of
town now known as Oildale. One of The
Bangles and all the members of Korn are
from my hometown, so avid fans ought to
come visit their old stomping grounds. If
nothing else, people should come to Small
Town to see all the sweaty. Hat-butted
freaks running around with big thumbs.
So that is what my home town is like, and
1 love it. I have plead my case and submit it
for your approval. With any luck, 1 11 see
you all in Small Town for spring break.

Eugene Park, a master's student in philoso
phy, notes that the town he calls home is a
place other people call "the armpit of Cali
fornia. "
