# As Phi Delts consider future, house opens to new tenants as 680 Lomita

### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
While the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house reopened Sunday as
680 Lomita, a new university-run residence, fraternity members
contemplated the future of their chapter as an unhoused organiza
tion.
The Phi Delt California Beta chapter, which had been housed
on campus since 1891, lost its house at the end of last quarter. Dean
of Students Marc Wais evicted the fraternity members because
they broke the terms of a probation that restricted alcohol in their
house.
The fraternity had occupied the house since the early 19605.
Most of the recently evicted fraternity members have relocated
to off-campus locations.
"Pretty much everybody has moved off campus, but there are a
few people who stayed on campus," said sophomore Hamzah
Mazari.
The move off campus has raised doubts among the Phi Delts as
to whether they will be recruiting new members for Rush this yeai.
Without the house, the Phi Delts are still guessing as to how they
will maintain their group unity and if they will continue to exist as
an unhoused chapter. Because they've separated, they have not yet

been able to meet.
"We haven't even discussed the fraternity status," Mazari said.

The old Phi Delta Theta house will have to get used to a
new crowd thanks to the fraternity's departure at the end of
last quarter.
