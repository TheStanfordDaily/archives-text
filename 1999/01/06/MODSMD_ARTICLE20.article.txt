# Deep Thoughts
## Faith is no more blind than cynicism 
### 
Brittney Jensen

ONCE I WAS in a religious studies
seminar where we discussed the
differences between philosophy,
theology and religion. One girl answered
that philosophy was for those who were too
educated to need theology or religion. This
statement, echoed in CIV / IHIJM sections
and dining halls throughout our campus,
deeply offended me, for I consider myself
both religious and educated.
Religion is a definite presence on this
campus. Memorial Church is the symbol for
Stanford on postcards and its Web page,
and the school hosts over 30 recognized
ministries; we even have a dean of religious
life. So why does there seem to be a perva
sive attitude of spiritual cynicism, or even
worse, condescension among members of
the Stanford community?
In my four years here, I have heard stu
dents and faculty describe religion as a
crutch, a delusion or a persistent leftover of
a more ignorant era. According to the spir
itual cynics, religious faith is incompatible
with intellectual clarity.
Sometimes critics of religious faith are

asked. "What do you believe? How do you
come to terms with human suffering, with
death, with the miracle of life and nature?"
Many adhere to science as a religion.
They believe in a rational logical explana
tion for everything. They maintain that dis
coveries of'modern science have made faith
unnecessary and archaic.
But what is science, besides a human
created system based on the very thing the
cynics sneer at, faith? All science, like reli
gion. is grounded on some sort of biased
assumption. Remember postulates in
geometry, the unprovable statements on
which all other proofs are based? There is
no scientific proof that two parallel lines
will never intersect; yet mathematicians
accept this assertion, which makes good
sense in their limited, subjective view, and
build a great science upon somewhat myth
ical foundations.
Thomas Edison said, "We don't know
what water is. We don't know what elec
tricity is. We don't know what heat is. We
have a lot of hypotheses about these things,
but that is all. But we do not let our iyno

rance of these things deprive us of their
use."
I believe in water when I feel the cold
stream in my shower. 1 believe in electricity
and heat when 1 burn myself testing a hot
iron. Playing with molecular models and
my fourth grade science project reinforced
mv faith in these physical elements, but ulti
mately I had to experience what my teach
ers told me about. Likewise. 1 and most
religious people I've met have studied, read
and reasoned through our religions, but my
beliefs are formed upon my experiences
and sensations. After experiencing my life
so far, believing that a benevolent God
watches over our actions seems no more
far-fetched to me than believing that hydro
gen and oxygen form water.
I am not trying to convert anyone: I am
only asking for a sincere respect for faith
that I have often found lacking at Stanford.
I ask for this respect for not only my reli
gion (1 am Mormon, but not from Utah)
but for all faiths, including all forms of
Christianity, Judaism, Islam and even
thinking atheism.

It is true that my religious beliefs are
shared with my family, for many genera
tions back. Please don't assume that I am
just a blind follower in this tradition. You
don't know the nuances of belief and prac
tice within my family. Perhaps I took the
time to seriously consider the validity of my
family's religion. Perhaps at one point I
even rejected my family's values, and
extensively explored other churches and
beliefs. Perhaps I concluded that there is no
(iod or higher order and found myself
depressed. Perhaps I reconsidered my fam
ily's religion, tested its precepts in my daily
life and found it to be the system under
which 1 found the most happiness and ful
fillment. That could have happened, but it's
more likely that my parents brainwashed
me with faith serum in my oatmeal.
Maybe certain aspects of different reli
gions seem confusing, illogical or even cruel
to you as an outside observer. Again, please
don't assume that devout followers are
stupid and have blindly overlooked these
apparent flaws in their faith. 1 think that
most intelligent Stanford students (a redun

dant description) have explored the alleged
contradictions within their belief systems
and resolved rather than dismissed them. I
am happy to discuss any issues you have
with my religion; it is most likely that you
misunderstand what we believe. But please
don't toss out flippant, judgmental com
ments about something others might con
sider sacred that you probably don't under
stand.
Albert Einstein, one of the premier
thinkers of the 20th century, said, "There
are two ways to live your life; one is as
though nothing is a miracle â€” the other is
as though everything is a miracle." Like this
great scientist, I, along with many other
members of the Stanford community,
choose to live my life under the latter phi
losophy. 1 don't think it makes us any less
of an intellectual, and I would appreciate it
if the rest of the University would agree
with me.
