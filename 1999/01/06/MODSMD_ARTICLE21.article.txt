## PAC-10 MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW Cardinal looks to prevail in over-crowded Pac 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
One weekend may already be
gone in the Pacific 10 Conference
season, but the league is so unpre
dictable (see Saturday's California-
Oregon result or Sunday's Washing

ton-Washington State matchup for
proof) that it's never too late to start
making predictions, no matter how
futile the task may seem.
If there's one thing that's for sure
in Pac-10 play, it's that anything can
happen. Nothing is guaranteed in
this league, as some teams have al

ready been reminded.
However, a couple of things that
can he counted upon: UCLA will he
its usual threat in the title race; no
matter how many upsets they pull
off, Washington State and Oregon
State will not get even close to the
bubble for the NCAA tournament;
every other team will; and it's the
year of the Cardinal.
A look at how the teams will fin
ish this year, with projected confer
ence record:
1. Stanford (17-1) Arizona and
UCLA have dominated the confer
ence's championship podium every
year since the 1985-86 season, but
that streak will come to an end this
year. After its run into the Final Four
last March, Mike Montgomery's
squad won't settle for anything less
than the Pac-I()crown.
It's unlikely that the Cardinal can
become the first team to go 18-0 in
the conference season, as some un
expected roadblock always comes
up (such as last year's upset of Ari
zona by USC in the conference finale
for both teams). But Arthur Lee and
company should bring the Farm its
first conference title since Stanford
took first in the Pacific Coast Con
ference in 1941-42.
The Cardinal's balance in the
frontcourt and baekcourt is its best
weapon, as one can compensate if
the other is shut down. 1 lealthy bod
ies have been problematic for the
bench-heavy squad, but the talent is
spread around so well that a new
player can always step up. That well
rounded feature of the team will

probably mean Arthur Lee won't
have to put up the numbers that will
get him player-of-the-year honors,
but he'd gladly trade personal glory
for the team's sake.
2. UCLA (14-4) The Bruins are
quickly becoming the nation's best
team, and are probably one year
away from being a Final Four lock.
I Jnfortunately, they're probably also
a year away from returning to the top
of the Pac-1().
No one can forget that the Bruins
have the best recruiting class in the
nation, but despite the talent, their
youth may prevail at times, as it did
in allowing Arizona back into the
game during last Saturday's blowout
at Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA is anchored by sopho
mores Baron Davis and Earl Watson
in the baekcourt. and its success will
be largely contingent upon how
quickly Davis can whip the younger
players into shape, as well as how he
handles himself. When Davis plays
aggressively on offense, as in the
game against the Wildcats, the Bru
ins can blow out a great team. When
he defers to his teammates, however,
they get forced into overtime by mid
tier squads such as Arizona State.
3. California (12-6) Fresh off a year
of NCAA probation, the Bears
should easily return to the tourna
ment in March. They have an explo
sive leader in guard Geno Carlisle,
who is complemented on the wing by
an equally explosive Thomas Kilgo
