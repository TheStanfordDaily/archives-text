## PAC-10 MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW Cardinal looks to prevail in over-crowded Pac 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
One weekend may already be
gone in the Pacific 10 Conference
season, but the league is so unpre
dictable (see Saturday's California-
Oregon result or Sunday's Washing

ton-Washington State matchup for
proof) that it's never too late to start
making predictions, no matter how
futile the task may seem.
If there's one thing that's for sure
in Pac-10 play, it's that anything can
happen. Nothing is guaranteed in
this league, as some teams have al

ready been reminded.
However, a couple of things that
can he counted upon: UCLA will he
its usual threat in the title race; no
matter how many upsets they pull
off, Washington State and Oregon
State will not get even close to the
bubble for the NCAA tournament;
every other team will; and it's the
year of the Cardinal.
A look at how the teams will fin
ish this year, with projected confer
ence record:
1. Stanford (17-1) Arizona and
UCLA have dominated the confer
ence's championship podium every
year since the 1985-86 season, but
that streak will come to an end this
year. After its run into the Final Four
last March, Mike Montgomery's
squad won't settle for anything less
than the Pac-I()crown.
It's unlikely that the Cardinal can
become the first team to go 18-0 in
the conference season, as some un
expected roadblock always comes
up (such as last year's upset of Ari
zona by USC in the conference finale
for both teams). But Arthur Lee and
company should bring the Farm its
first conference title since Stanford
took first in the Pacific Coast Con
ference in 1941-42.
The Cardinal's balance in the
frontcourt and baekcourt is its best
weapon, as one can compensate if
the other is shut down. 1 lealthy bod
ies have been problematic for the
bench-heavy squad, but the talent is
spread around so well that a new
player can always step up. That well
rounded feature of the team will

probably mean Arthur Lee won't
have to put up the numbers that will
get him player-of-the-year honors,
but he'd gladly trade personal glory
for the team's sake.
2. UCLA (14-4) The Bruins are
quickly becoming the nation's best
team, and are probably one year
away from being a Final Four lock.
I Jnfortunately, they're probably also
a year away from returning to the top
of the Pac-1().
No one can forget that the Bruins
have the best recruiting class in the
nation, but despite the talent, their
youth may prevail at times, as it did
in allowing Arizona back into the
game during last Saturday's blowout
at Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA is anchored by sopho
mores Baron Davis and Earl Watson
in the baekcourt. and its success will
be largely contingent upon how
quickly Davis can whip the younger
players into shape, as well as how he
handles himself. When Davis plays
aggressively on offense, as in the
game against the Wildcats, the Bru
ins can blow out a great team. When
he defers to his teammates, however,
they get forced into overtime by mid
tier squads such as Arizona State.
3. California (12-6) Fresh off a year
of NCAA probation, the Bears
should easily return to the tourna
ment in March. They have an explo
sive leader in guard Geno Carlisle,
who is complemented on the wing by
an equally explosive Thomas Kilgo

re, but their luck of consistency can
cost them some games they should
normally take. Oregon may be good,
but Cal shouldn't have lost to them at
home last Saturday.
The Bears also have a solid inside
game anchored by Sean Lampley and
Francisco Elson. making the Bears
one of the more threatening teams in
the conference.
4 (tie). Arizona (11-7) A year re
moved from the conference title, Ari
zona is also a year removed from
what were probably its three best
players in Michael Bibby, Miles
Simon.
But with the departed superstars,
point guard Jason Terry has the op
portunity to move from being the
best sixth man in the conference to
being a top player of the year candi

date. He and coach Lute Olson will
teel the growing pains of a terrific
freshman class, led by standout for
ward Michael Wright, but the Wild
cats should remain among the confer
ence elite.
4 (tie). Washington (11-7) After Con
necticut's Richard Hamilton
dropped a buzzer-beater prayer into
the basket to eliminate Washington
in the Sweet 16 in last year's tourna
ment. everyone in Seattle was look
ing forward to the 1 luskies returning
a veteran team that might take head
coach Bob Bender even further into
the Big Dance.
Unfortunately, the Huskies have
not lived up to the hvpe so far this
year. They've dropped games to
Gonzaga and lowlv Washington
State, not exactly the kind of perfor
mance one would expect from a team
that has the talent to make a run at the
Pac-10 title.
Forward Donald Watts, an All-

Conference selection last year, is
back from an ankle sprain that kept
him out for four games and had 14
points in the losing effort to Washing
ton State. Guard Deon Luton is the
school's career three-point record
holder and center Todd MacCulloch,
another All-Conference player, leads
the team in scoring.
6. Oregon (10-8) The Ducks have
what it takes to shake up the confer
ence standings, and got to an early
start with an upset of Cal in their sea
son opener.
Freshman guard Frederick Jones
leads an all-around accurate outside
attack and ranks second in the con
ference in three-point shooting. Alex
Scales paces the Ducks with 14.4
points per game, and A.D. Smith
adds 13.6 and veteran leadership and
stability. Ernie Kent, in only his sec
ond year as head coach, may lead his
team to its first postseason appear
ance since 1995.

7. USC (7-11) The positive is that
USC has a team that may be better
than the squad that went to the 1997
tournament. The bad news is that
everyone else in the conference is
also better. The Trojans could easily
finish with double digits in the confer
ence win column, but it's not likely.
For most teams the hardest task is
winning on the road. For USC, it's to
not lose at home. The anemic
"crowds" at the L.A. Coliseum don't
provide much support for a team
that's much better than most would
give it credit for.
Sophomore forward Brian Scal
abrine. a junior college transfer, has
proved invaluable by leading the Tro
jans in scoring and rebounding.
8. Arizona State (5-13) Another solid
team that's just in the wrong place at
the wrong time. The Sun Devils had
the Trojans on the ropes tin Saturday
bul let them storm back. They gave
UCLA a scare Monday but couldn't

finish. Rob Evans, who takes the
helm of the program after six years as
coach at Mississippi, will have to
teach his team to play down the
stretch if it's to have a chance.
The Sun Devils lost Jeremy Veal,
last year's Pac-10 scoring leader, to
graduation, but have heavy scorers in
guard Eddie House and Bobby
La/or, who garnered Pac-10 New
comer of the Year honors last year.
9 (tie). Oregon State (2-16) The
Beavers had a lot of talent last year
that didn't quite pan out. This year,
they have much less talent. They'll
get thier obligatory upset and then
split their series with Washington
State, making things less lonely at the
bottom of the conference.
9 (tie). Washington State (2-16) The
best this team can hope for is one
upset. It's too bad they wasted it in the
conference opener against rival
Washington. It's going to be a long

winter in Pullman, but at least the
Beavers will be in town for one night.
Coach of the Year Mike Mont
gomery. Stanford. Montgomery has
taken this team a long way. This could
be the year to remember for Monty,
as he looks to wrap up the conference
title, this award and hopefully a na
tional championship. Everyone has
always said it's amazing that Mont
gomery could do what he's done with
the program at a school as academ
ically challenging as Stanford, now
it's time to actually reward him as
Coach of the Year..
Player of the Year Geno Carlisle,
California. Lee. Davis and Terry will
most likely all be better players, but
Carlisle isn't blessed with a team that
has the depth that Stanford, UCLA
and Arizona do. If Cal is going to win.
Carlisle is going to have to put Up
huge numbers. He can and will.
All-Conference Team Guards: Geno
Carlisle (Cal). Baron Davis (UCLA),
Arthur Lee (Stanford), Jason lerry
(Arizona). Forwards: Bobby Lazor
(Arizona State), Mark Madsen
(Stanford), A.D. Smith (Oregon),
Donald Watts (Washington). Cen
ters: Todd MacCulloch (Washing
ton). Tim Young (Stanford).
Freshman of the Year Dan Gadzuric,
UCLA. The freshman from The
Hague, Netherlands, has been held
back by Lavin because of problems
with tendinitis, but once he gets
rolling there isn't much to stop the 6-
10 center. His presence on the inside
will give veteran players like MacCul
loch and Young fits on the inside. By
far the most important member of

UCLA's freshman class.
Newcomer of the Year Brian Scal
abrine, USC. Scalabrine brings some
thing that has been severely lacking
for the Trojans in the past years:
someone on the inside. The transfer
has made an immediate impact and
leads Henry Bibby's club in scoring,
field goal percentage and rebound
ing, and is in the top 10 of the confer
ence in each of those categories.
NCAA tournament qualifiers Ari
zona. California, Oregon, Stanford,
UCLA. Washington. The Pac-1() has
placed an NCAA-record four teams
in the Sweet 16 of the tournament the
past two years, so it should get the
benefit of the doubt and be given a
fifth berth by the selection commit
tee. Oregon will sneak in as the sixth
team if it can avoid dropping any
games against underdogs and man
ages an upset or two of the league's
elite.

Arthur Lee (Stanford), Jason lerry
(Arizona). Forwards: Bobby Lazor
(Arizona State), Mark Madsen
(Stanford), A.D. Smith (Oregon),
Donald Watts (Washington). Cen
ters: Todd MacCulloch (Washing
ton). Tim Young (Stanford).
Freshman of the Year Dan Gadzuric,
UCLA. The freshman from The
Hague, Netherlands, has been held
back by Lavin because of problems
with tendinitis, but once he gets
rolling there isn't much to stop the 6-
10 center. His presence on the inside
will give veteran players like MacCul
loch and Young fits on the inside. By
far the most important member of

UCLA's freshman class.
Newcomer of the Year Brian Scal
abrine, USC. Scalabrine brings some
thing that has been severely lacking
for the Trojans in the past years:
someone on the inside. The transfer
has made an immediate impact and
leads Henry Bibby's club in scoring,
field goal percentage and rebound
ing, and is in the top 10 of the confer
ence in each of those categories.
NCAA tournament qualifiers Ari
zona. California, Oregon, Stanford,
UCLA. Washington. The Pac-1() has
placed an NCAA-record four teams
in the Sweet 16 of the tournament the
past two years, so it should get the
benefit of the doubt and be given a
fifth berth by the selection commit
tee. Oregon will sneak in as the sixth
team if it can avoid dropping any
games against underdogs and man
ages an upset or two of the league's
elite.
One weekend may already be
gone in the Pacific 10 Conference
season, but the league is so unpre
dictable (see Saturday's California-
Oregon result or Sunday's Washing

ton-Washington State matchup for
proof) that it's never too late to start
making predictions, no matter how
futile the task may seem.
If there's one thing that's for sure
in Pac-10 play, it's that anything can
happen. Nothing is guaranteed in
this league, as some teams have al

ready been reminded.
However, a couple of things that
can he counted upon: UCLA will he
its usual threat in the title race; no
matter how many upsets they pull
off, Washington State and Oregon
State will not get even close to the
bubble for the NCAA tournament;
every other team will; and it's the
year of the Cardinal.
A look at how the teams will fin
ish this year, with projected confer
ence record:
1. Stanford (17-1) Arizona and
UCLA have dominated the confer
ence's championship podium every
year since the 1985-86 season, but
that streak will come to an end this
year. After its run into the Final Four
last March, Mike Montgomery's
squad won't settle for anything less
than the Pac-I()crown.
It's unlikely that the Cardinal can
become the first team to go 18-0 in
the conference season, as some un
expected roadblock always comes
up (such as last year's upset of Ari
zona by USC in the conference finale
for both teams). But Arthur Lee and
company should bring the Farm its
first conference title since Stanford
took first in the Pacific Coast Con
ference in 1941-42.
The Cardinal's balance in the
frontcourt and baekcourt is its best
weapon, as one can compensate if
the other is shut down. 1 lealthy bod
ies have been problematic for the
bench-heavy squad, but the talent is
spread around so well that a new
player can always step up. That well
rounded feature of the team will

probably mean Arthur Lee won't
have to put up the numbers that will
get him player-of-the-year honors,
but he'd gladly trade personal glory
for the team's sake.
2. UCLA (14-4) The Bruins are
quickly becoming the nation's best
team, and are probably one year
away from being a Final Four lock.
I Jnfortunately, they're probably also
a year away from returning to the top
of the Pac-1().
No one can forget that the Bruins
have the best recruiting class in the
nation, but despite the talent, their
youth may prevail at times, as it did
in allowing Arizona back into the
game during last Saturday's blowout
at Pauley Pavilion.
UCLA is anchored by sopho
mores Baron Davis and Earl Watson
in the baekcourt. and its success will
be largely contingent upon how
quickly Davis can whip the younger
players into shape, as well as how he
handles himself. When Davis plays
aggressively on offense, as in the
game against the Wildcats, the Bru
ins can blow out a great team. When
he defers to his teammates, however,
they get forced into overtime by mid
tier squads such as Arizona State.
3. California (12-6) Fresh off a year
of NCAA probation, the Bears
should easily return to the tourna
ment in March. They have an explo
sive leader in guard Geno Carlisle,
who is complemented on the wing by
an equally explosive Thomas Kilgo

re, but their luck of consistency can
cost them some games they should
normally take. Oregon may be good,
but Cal shouldn't have lost to them at
home last Saturday.
The Bears also have a solid inside
game anchored by Sean Lampley and
Francisco Elson. making the Bears
one of the more threatening teams in
the conference.
4 (tie). Arizona (11-7) A year re
moved from the conference title, Ari
zona is also a year removed from
what were probably its three best
players in Michael Bibby, Miles
Simon.
But with the departed superstars,
point guard Jason Terry has the op
portunity to move from being the
best sixth man in the conference to
being a top player of the year candi

date. He and coach Lute Olson will
teel the growing pains of a terrific
freshman class, led by standout for
ward Michael Wright, but the Wild
cats should remain among the confer
ence elite.
4 (tie). Washington (11-7) After Con
necticut's Richard Hamilton
dropped a buzzer-beater prayer into
the basket to eliminate Washington
in the Sweet 16 in last year's tourna
ment. everyone in Seattle was look
ing forward to the 1 luskies returning
a veteran team that might take head
coach Bob Bender even further into
the Big Dance.
Unfortunately, the Huskies have
not lived up to the hvpe so far this
year. They've dropped games to
Gonzaga and lowlv Washington
State, not exactly the kind of perfor
mance one would expect from a team
that has the talent to make a run at the
Pac-10 title.
Forward Donald Watts, an All-

Conference selection last year, is
back from an ankle sprain that kept
him out for four games and had 14
points in the losing effort to Washing
ton State. Guard Deon Luton is the
school's career three-point record
holder and center Todd MacCulloch,
another All-Conference player, leads
the team in scoring.
6. Oregon (10-8) The Ducks have
what it takes to shake up the confer
ence standings, and got to an early
start with an upset of Cal in their sea
son opener.
Freshman guard Frederick Jones
leads an all-around accurate outside
attack and ranks second in the con
ference in three-point shooting. Alex
Scales paces the Ducks with 14.4
points per game, and A.D. Smith
adds 13.6 and veteran leadership and
stability. Ernie Kent, in only his sec
ond year as head coach, may lead his
team to its first postseason appear
ance since 1995.

7. USC (7-11) The positive is that
USC has a team that may be better
than the squad that went to the 1997
tournament. The bad news is that
everyone else in the conference is
also better. The Trojans could easily
finish with double digits in the confer
ence win column, but it's not likely.
For most teams the hardest task is
winning on the road. For USC, it's to
not lose at home. The anemic
"crowds" at the L.A. Coliseum don't
provide much support for a team
that's much better than most would
give it credit for.
Sophomore forward Brian Scal
abrine. a junior college transfer, has
proved invaluable by leading the Tro
jans in scoring and rebounding.
8. Arizona State (5-13) Another solid
team that's just in the wrong place at
the wrong time. The Sun Devils had
the Trojans on the ropes tin Saturday
bul let them storm back. They gave
UCLA a scare Monday but couldn't

finish. Rob Evans, who takes the
helm of the program after six years as
coach at Mississippi, will have to
teach his team to play down the
stretch if it's to have a chance.
The Sun Devils lost Jeremy Veal,
last year's Pac-10 scoring leader, to
graduation, but have heavy scorers in
guard Eddie House and Bobby
La/or, who garnered Pac-10 New
comer of the Year honors last year.
9 (tie). Oregon State (2-16) The
Beavers had a lot of talent last year
that didn't quite pan out. This year,
they have much less talent. They'll
get thier obligatory upset and then
split their series with Washington
State, making things less lonely at the
bottom of the conference.
9 (tie). Washington State (2-16) The
best this team can hope for is one
upset. It's too bad they wasted it in the
conference opener against rival
Washington. It's going to be a long

winter in Pullman, but at least the
Beavers will be in town for one night.
Coach of the Year Mike Mont
gomery. Stanford. Montgomery has
taken this team a long way. This could
be the year to remember for Monty,
as he looks to wrap up the conference
title, this award and hopefully a na
tional championship. Everyone has
always said it's amazing that Mont
gomery could do what he's done with
the program at a school as academ
ically challenging as Stanford, now
it's time to actually reward him as
Coach of the Year..
Player of the Year Geno Carlisle,
California. Lee. Davis and Terry will
most likely all be better players, but
Carlisle isn't blessed with a team that
has the depth that Stanford, UCLA
and Arizona do. If Cal is going to win.
Carlisle is going to have to put Up
huge numbers. He can and will.

9 (tie). Oregon State (2-16) The
Beavers had a lot of talent last year
that didn't quite pan out. This year,
they have much less talent. They'll
get thier obligatory upset and then
split their series with Washington
State, making things less lonely at the
bottom of the conference.
9 (tie). Washington State (2-16) The
best this team can hope for is one
upset. It's too bad they wasted it in the
conference opener against rival
Washington. It's going to be a long

winter in Pullman, but at least the
Beavers will be in town for one night.
Coach of the Year Mike Mont
gomery. Stanford. Montgomery has
taken this team a long way. This could
be the year to remember for Monty,
as he looks to wrap up the conference
title, this award and hopefully a na
tional championship. Everyone has
always said it's amazing that Mont
gomery could do what he's done with
the program at a school as academ
ically challenging as Stanford, now
it's time to actually reward him as
Coach of the Year..
Player of the Year Geno Carlisle,
California. Lee. Davis and Terry will
most likely all be better players, but
Carlisle isn't blessed with a team that
has the depth that Stanford, UCLA
and Arizona do. If Cal is going to win.
Carlisle is going to have to put Up
huge numbers. He can and will.
All-Conference Team Guards: Geno
Carlisle (Cal). Baron Davis (UCLA),
Arthur Lee (Stanford), Jason lerry
(Arizona). Forwards: Bobby Lazor
(Arizona State), Mark Madsen
(Stanford), A.D. Smith (Oregon),
Donald Watts (Washington). Cen
ters: Todd MacCulloch (Washing
ton). Tim Young (Stanford).
Freshman of the Year Dan Gadzuric,
UCLA. The freshman from The
Hague, Netherlands, has been held
back by Lavin because of problems
with tendinitis, but once he gets
rolling there isn't much to stop the 6-
10 center. His presence on the inside
will give veteran players like MacCul
loch and Young fits on the inside. By
far the most important member of

UCLA's freshman class.
Newcomer of the Year Brian Scal
abrine, USC. Scalabrine brings some
thing that has been severely lacking
for the Trojans in the past years:
someone on the inside. The transfer
has made an immediate impact and
leads Henry Bibby's club in scoring,
field goal percentage and rebound
ing, and is in the top 10 of the confer
ence in each of those categories.
NCAA tournament qualifiers Ari
zona. California, Oregon, Stanford,
UCLA. Washington. The Pac-1() has
placed an NCAA-record four teams
in the Sweet 16 of the tournament the
past two years, so it should get the
benefit of the doubt and be given a
fifth berth by the selection commit
tee. Oregon will sneak in as the sixth
team if it can avoid dropping any
games against underdogs and man
ages an upset or two of the league's
elite.
