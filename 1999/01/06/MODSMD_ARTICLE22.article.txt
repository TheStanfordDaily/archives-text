The team sent eight to the Mid
lands tourney and finished 26th out
of 55 teams. Junior Shane Cross and
junior captain Zach Zimmerer both
made it to the semifinal round be
fore bowing out.
Cross had an exceptional perfor
mance against Mark Bybee of
Northwestern, defeating him in the
first round to start a career day.

Bybee is ranked second in the nation
and Coach Chris Horpel called it "a
really big win for him."
Cross went on to upset Jason
Townsend of Hofstra in the second
round and finally lost a close match
to third-ranked Leo Ciiel of Rider on
a last-second takedown with the
score knotted at 1-1.
Other notable performances
were posted by junior Warren
McPherson, who had three wins on
the day. Assistant coach and former
Stanford All-American Tod Surmon
placed sixth after losing to eventual
champion Joe Heskett of lowa State
in the semifinals. Unfortunately,
Surmon suffered a knee injury that
caused him to forfeit his remaining
matches.
Junior Frank Ruiz and Senior
Beau Weiner had a rough tourna
ment. Weiner had a record of 2-2 on
the day and Ruiz, went 1-2. Both did
not place.
Going into tomorrow's dual
meets against Harvard and Oregon,
the Cardinal has some key injuries.

Junior Rudy Ruiz (125 lbs.) has a
slight clavicle separation. Freshman
Kenji Arai (141) has a knee sprain
and junior Frank Ruiz (149) is also
nursing a knee sprain and has a pos
sible hernia. Junior Tim Kendall also
has a knee sprain that could be prob
lematic in the upcoming matches.
Horpel believes the injuries to
these starters should not be signifi
cant to prevent them from wrestling
in the upcoming dual meets. "I be
lieve all four will be ready for this
week's competition. " said Horpel.
"However, I will weigh in back-ups
for these wrestlers just in case they
cannot perform."
At this point in the season. Junior
Warren McPherson (165) is leading
the team with 10 wins. Cross is sec
ond in wins with nine and junior
Zach Zimmerer (133) is third on the
team with eight victories.
Freshmen Chuck Fairbanks (1 97)
and Arai are having a tougher time
adjusting to college-level wrestlinii

Shane Cross and the wrestling team look to open 1999 with two victories as they host Oregon and Har
vard today in Burnham Pavilion.
but are improving as the season pro
gresses. Senior Beau Weiner has
posted 6 wins so far and is looking to
pick up some wins at this week's
matches.
In tomorrow 's competition, Stan
ford faces a much improved Har
vard. one of the best ('rimson squads
in recent memory. Harvard recently
captured the Ivy League Kick-Off
Classic title over heavily favored
Pennsylvania and Cornell. Harvard
is currently ranked 22nd in the na
tion.
The Crimson is led by All-Amer
ican senior captain Dustin DeNun
zio at 141 pounds, who is having an
excellent season. Senior Fran Volpe
at IN4 is also one of Harvard's best.
Oregon is also a much improved
squad from last year and is almost
the same caliber of Harvard. Both

will be tough matches for the Cardi
nal squad.
"The dual meets this week are
even matches," said Horpel. "In
each case, whoever wins more of the
close matches wins the dual. We
could have a perfect week but it is
going to depend on how each athlete
responds to this level of competi
tion."
Horpel is pleased with the team's
progress up to this point. "We are
about where we want to be for the
start of the second half of the season.
Spirits are high, conditioning is get
ting better and injuries are not too
extreme."
He also spoke of the importance
of the upcoming meets for the team's
development.
"Many of our upcoming duals will
determine seedings for the Pac-10
Conference championships at the
end of February, so we have to wres
tle well because they take on some
significance," he said.
