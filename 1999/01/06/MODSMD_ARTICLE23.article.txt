# Year to remember for soccer

RICHMOND. Va. — A fourth
place conference finish.
Unseeded entering the tourna
ment.
A program that had never won a
playoff game until this season.
Most people would consider this
the recipe of a Cinderella story — a
team on an unexpected and im
pressive run to reach the national
championship game.
Nobody expected the Stanford
Cardinal to attend this ball.
But while this was indeed a very
special season for the Stanford
men's soccer team, the Cardinal
never considered itself an unlikely
guest at the showcase event.
"Wefelt that we were one of the
best teams in the West and that
meant that we were one of the best
teams in the country," said head
coach Hobby Clark. "We felt we
were a top-10 team all season and
believed that the winner of the
championship was going to come
out of the top 10."
The final Soccer America poll,
compiled before the playoffs, had
Stanford ranked No. 9. and eventu
al champion Indiana No. 2.
Hut the Cardinal arrived to the

Final Four with more grace than by
way of a pumpkin carriage.
Stanford set a school record of
24 consecutive weeks in the nation
al polls, dating back to Sept. 15.
1997.
And it was the run that began
early last season, which had Stan
ford undefeated in its first 15
games, that helped the Cardinal
believe what it was truly capable of.
"Probably when we started
making that [undefeated] run last
year is when we really felt like we
could win something big." said se
nior midfielder Shan Gaw.
The success of 1997 was cut
short by a heartbreaking first
round playoff loss to Washington,
but the team used the early exit as
an incentive for this season.
"Another driving force was
proving to people that 119971
wasn't luck. We wanted to show
them again," (Jaw said.
And this season's success, in
cluding setting a new school record
for wins in a season (18). erased all
notions that Stanford soccer was a
one-year wonder. This success was
in large part thanks to the contribu
tions of Gaw and his six fellow se
niors. both on and off the field.
"The senior class always sets the
standards, and provides the leader

ship." Bobby Clark said. "That was
very strong this year."
These seniors scored 82 of Stan
ford's 127 points, and senior mid
fielder Simon Elliott led the way
with 25 points, including four goals
scored in the NCAA tournament.
As Elliott guided Stanford's of
fense, senior defender Jamie Clark
was the heart and soul of the Cardi
nal defense. Stanford finished the
season with a .56 goals-against av
erage. the third best in the country.
Jamie Clark received NCAA First
Team All-Amcrican honors, the
first ever for Stanford, and Elliott
was named to the third team. Both
also earned a place on the NCAA
Final Four All-Tournament team.
Seniors A.J. Sauer and Adam
Siegman were also offensive
threats, finishing second and third
in scoring with 20 and 14 points, re
spectively. Sauer. the two-year
team captain, and senior Aaron
Jones ended their careers tied for
second in all-time career matches
played, with 78.
It was not the seniors alone,
however, who were responsible for
the tremendous season.
"All the seniors knew this was
their time. But the youngsters, the

two freshmen in the games, per
formed with great distinction."
Hobby Clark said.
Freshman defender Lee Morri
son and midfielder Derek Shana
han, the only two rookies to see ac
tion this year, carried their weight
through the playoffs as well.
Morrison, who was named to the
Final Four All- Tournament Team,
was vital to the Cardinal from day
one.
The biggest of his five goals on
the season came in the 1-0 national
semifinal victory against Maryland.
Also named first team All-MPSF.
Morrison's play contributed to
Stanford's immense defense.
Shanahan, who's role grew due
to the midseason loss of sophomore
Sean Sylvistoa broken leg, also saw
solid playing time in all five playoff

games. He scored his first career
goal in the NCAA second round
against the San Diego Toreros.
Aside from all the individual ac
complishments, Bobby Clark
stressed the importance of the en
tire squad.
"It was really a team effort from
start to finish," he explained. "Dif
ferent players stepped up in differ
ent games, but a lot of players
played a great role. All the unsung
heroes were tremendous.
"Even players that weren't al
lowed to suit up. Their enthusiasm
and willingness to do anything was
amazing."
And Clark believes that the en
thusiasm and chemistry of this 1998
squad will be remembered along
with its success on the field.
"This was definitely a very spe
cial group." Clark said. "It was a
very tight team. Next year will be
different, but that is the challenge
of college soccer.
