## Stanford scientists search for extraterrestrial life Life on Earth may have originated on Mars, travelling across space on asteroid transports

"Armageddon" depicted an
Earth threatened by a massive aster
oid and showed how Bruce Willis
and Hen Affleck dramatically saved
humanity from annihilation. Hut
perhaps these cosmic killers are not
so villainous — asteroids may have
actually brought life to our planet
from Mars.
A paper released last November
by Stanford geophysics professor
Norman Sleep and NASA
researcher Kevin Zahnle argues that
Mars was a safer place for life in the
early existence of our solar system
than Earth.
It also theorizes that rocks blasted
off the surface of Mars by meteor
impacts may have traveled to Earth
carrying microorganisms. These
microorganisms may have seeded or
even re-seeded life on Earth if native
life forms had been extinguished by
catastrophic meteor impacts.
"This is like studying the Titanic,"
said Sleep, noting that the gravest
threat to life billions of years ago was
a single catastrophic meteor colli
sion. "Who survives the sinking?"
Earth was a hazardous place for
primitive life four billion years ago.
Scientists believe that it was continu
ally bombarded by asteroids and
other debris left over from the for
mation of the solar system, some
over S(X) kilometers in length. Such
collisions would vaporize tons of
rock and much, if not all, of the
Earth's oceans. This would create a
steam and rock-vapor atmosphere
that would have killed all life as far
down as one kilometer into the
Earth's crust.
Such impacts would not be
uncommon, Sleep said, making life a
risky proposition. How then, did life
survive?
According to Sleep, one possibili
ty is that it came from Mars. The
Red Planet offered several advan
tages to primitive organisms for sur
viving a primordial "Deep Impact."
First, Mars is smaller than Earth,
making catastrophic asteroid
encounters less frequent. In addi
tion, Mars did not have the large
oceans that would generate the ster
ilizing steam atmosphere. Lastly, the
planet itself was cooler than the
Earth, meaning organisms could live
deeper in Mars' crust without being
singed by the planet's molten core.
Ironically, these same asteroid
collisions also serve as a means of
transporting the organisms which
survive the impact. The impact of an
asteroid hitting the Martian surface
dislodges large chunks of rock, send
ing them into space.
"The physics of it are straightfor
ward," said Sleep. "The asteroid
accelerates the rocks into space."
Some of these new asteroids
(bund their wav to Earth, an occur

rence which was not only possible,
but frequent. Even now an asteroid
from Mars lands on Earth once
every three days, a rate which is
thousands of times less than it was
four billion years ago.
Recent evidence of organisms
found in just such a Martian asteroid
makes Sleep's proposal even more
convincing.
Surprisingly, small microorgan
isms may be robust enough to sur
vive hoth the trip and entry into the
atmosphere. Sleep noted that bacte
ria were found on a small moon
probe launched from Earth in the
1960s and later retrieved by astro
nauts, proving that life can endure
the vacuum and sub-zero tempera
tures of space.
In addition, microorganisms
buried deep inside meteorites would
be well insulated from the searing
heat of friction that arises when
meteorites plunge into the atmo
sphere. Moreover, the actual heating
of the asteroid is brief and never
penetrates deep into the rock.
"The heat of friction is easily dis
sipated," Sleep said. "Many small
asteroids, when they land, are stone
cold."
As a result, Sleep raised the
intriguing possibility that current life
may have first originated on Mars,
then immigrated via asteroid to
either colonize a barren Earth or
repopulate an Earth whose organ
isms had been rendered extinct from
a previous asteroid.

'Phis hypothesis, however, does
not necessarily imply that we are all
descendants of Martian creatures.
Sleep cautioned that another expla
nation for the survival of Earth life is
more mundane but equally likely.
Thermophilic, or heat-loving, bacte
ria may have survived the meteor
impacts by lurking in the deepest
parts of the ocean that escaped boil
ing.
These organisms, which are
found in hot-water vents at the
ocean floor, thrive in extreme condi
tions. Some can survive in water
reaching temperatures of 115
degrees Celsius, well over the boiling
point. Such organisms would be
uniquely suited to endure the steam
rock atmosphere that would kill off
less hardy creatures.
Sleep's paper may bolster interest
in searching for life on Mars and
examining relationships between it
and life on Earth. In addition, scien
tists may seek to trace the earliest
stages of life's evolution on Mars,
evidence which was destroyed long
ago on Earth but may have been
preserved on the Martian surface.
Sleep noted that whichever theo
ry one prefers, much work still
remains to be done. Scientists are
just now beginning to understand the
effects of organisms on geological
formations. Sleep observed with a
laugh that 30 years ago, newer rocks
with traces of organisms were simply
tossed aside by geologists. Now, he
says, they draw the most attention.
