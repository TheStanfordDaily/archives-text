# Europa, Jupiter's smallest moon, may harbor life beneath the ice
## 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
The human thirst for discovering
extraterrestrial life may finally be
quenched as explorations of
Jupiter's smallest moon, Europa,
provide increasing evidence that
suggests the existence of a liquid
ocean.
In 2003, NASA is planning to
launch its $250-million Europa
Orbiter mission to collect further
evidence that may determine
whether water does flow beneath
Europa's icy surface. Christopher
Chyba, consulting professor of geo
logical and environmental sciences,
will chair the science definition
team for the mission.
So far. Earth is the only plane
tary body in the solar system known
to harbor liquid water, which is con
sidered crucial for the development
of life.
Much data supporting the exis
tence of water on Europa has been
gathered from previous missions. In
the late 19705, information from the
Voyager missions raised the possi
bility of an ocean under the frozen
crust of Europa. This theory was
strengthened by images of Europa's
surface taken by the Galileo space
craft in 1996.
"[Since then] there has been a
convergence of evidence that sup
ports the existence of a liquid ocean
on Europa," said Chyba in a previ
ous interview.
A three-dimensional map of
Europa's Pwyll Crater provided by

Galileo images reveals a unique
structure that may have formed due
to water present below the moon's
crust.
Unlike most young, deep impact
craters, the Pwyll crater has a floor
at the same level as the exterior,
revealing that the crater has been
filled in from the bottom. Other evi
dence indicates that the crater col
lapsed during or immediately fol
lowing the meteorite impact, which
might result from water or soft ice
underneath the moon's exterior.
Debris from the impact also sug
gests that a material different from
the surface ice exists below
Europa's crust. Furthermore, some
areas in the crater appear to show
localized melting near the surface.
At some sections, the crust may be
no thicker than 150 kilometers.
Exploration by Galileo also
showed the existence of iceberg
like areas on Europa. The terrain of
the moon contains large fractured
and rotated chunks of crust the size
of several city blocks. The ice floes
appear to be either sliding on soft
glacier-like ice beneath the surface
or floating like icebergs in a more
fluid material.
Images reveal rough and swirly
material between the separated
plates of crust, which may be slush
that later solidified. Any water
exposed to the surface of Europa
would immediately freeze in the
minus-260-degree Fahrenheit tem
perature, creating this land texture.
An elaborate complex of wedges
criss-crosses the ice crust of the

moon, formed as new crust wells up
from below. The wedges consist of
narrow ridges and parallel grooves,
similar to new crust formed at mid
ocean ridges on the Earth's sea
floor. This suggests plate tectonic
activity, since tension in the crust
can cause two plates to pull apart
slightly, allowing warmer material
from below to push up and freeze,
forming a ridge. The warmer mate
rial in this hypothesis would be
water.
Another theory indicates that
the ridges are created when tidal
heating, caused by the pull of
Jupiter's strong gravity, melted or
cracked Europa's surface. The
cracks in Europa's terrain are
remarkably similar to the surface of
the Earth's Arctic Ocean.
Discoloration of the ridges,
along with the presence of ice floes,
suggest ice volcanoes or geysers
may once have been active on the
moon. The majority of the moon's
surface lacks cratering, suggesting
that it is constantly resurfaced, pos
sibly by frost falling from liquid
water geysers as they encounter
frigid surface temperatures.
Magnetic fields on Europa,
recorded by a magnetometer on
Galileo, have measured fluctua
tions that are consistent with the
magnetic effects of currents flowing
in a salt-water ocean.
"All these lines of evidence point
to a liquid water ocean," Chyba
said.
Three elements essential to the
support of life include the presence
of water, organic compounds and
sufficient heat. Water does exist on
the planet at least in ice form, and
organic compounds also exist on
the moon, with sufficient oxygen
created by water vapor to form a
tenuous atmosphere.
One major question that remains
to be answered is how much heat is
generated in the moon's interior,
and whether that temperature is
high enough to create a fluid ocean.
Theoretical estimates of the
amount of heat produced by the
force of gravity exerted on Europa
by Jupiter's other moons suggest
that it should sustain liquid water.
To search for evidence that
might ascertain the existence of a
liquid ocean on Europa, the science
definition team of the Europa
Orbiter mission has proposed tech
niques such as imaging, altimetry,
gravity measurements and subsur
face radar soundings. Infrared spec
trometry may also be used to exam
ine the chemical composition of
Europa's surface, determining the
presence of possible organic
molecules.
"If the orbiter confirms that
Europa has a liquid ocean, then it
will become one of the hottest
places in the solar system, along
with Mars, to search for life,"
Chyba said.
