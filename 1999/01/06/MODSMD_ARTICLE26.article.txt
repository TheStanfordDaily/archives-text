# Mining byproduct may not be as harmless as once thought
## 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
Although slag — a waste material byproduct of mining — may sound
like some pretty nasty stuff, it was thought to be an inert, environmentally
safe material until just recently.
Michael Parsons, a doctoral student in geological and environmental sci
ences, has found that slags produced in the mining of base metals such as
copper, zinc and cadmium may be toxic to the environment.
"There is a common sentiment in the industry that slag is inert," Parsons
said. However, his research demonstrated that this may be an incorrect
assumption.
Parsons' work, with the collaboration of Profs. Marco Einaudi and Den
nis Bird, was performed primarily at the Camanche Reservoir near Sacra
mento.
The reservoir, formerly a stretch of the Mokelumne River, sits adjacent
to the Penn Mine. The mine was a major copper and zinc mine which pro
cessed approximately S8(),(KK) tons of ore from the 186()s to the 19505. Major
slag deposits remain on the banks of the reservoir. Parsons set out to learn
how those deposits affect the environments in and around the reservoir.
Slag is what remains after needed minerals are extracted from mined ore
during smelting. During the smelting process, when the mined rock is melt
ed down, the denser materials, such as the copper and zinc, sink to the bot
tom. The slag floats to the top and is skimmed off as a waste product.
Slag still contains materials which may be toxic, though, especially to

aquatic animals. Although it is made up primarily of iron and silicon, slag
can also contain minerals such as zinc, copper and cadmium that were not
extracted during the mining. If the concentrations of these metals are high
enough, slag can be harmful to fish and other animals.
When the Penn Mine was active, the molten slag was stored in large,
bathtub-shaped bins. After cooling, the slag was dumped into the nearby
Mokelumne River.
"It was just a waste product to them," Parsons said. "They weren't real
ly thinking about the environment."
When the river was converted into the reservoir in 1963, it created a
more pressing environmental problem. The reservoir feeds a nearby fish
hatchery and also provides drinking water to some local trailer park com
munities. It is also a major sports fishing site during the summer.
The water levels at the reservoir fluctuate during the year. For six
months, the slag dump is actually under water.The metal levels in the water
are the worst in spring, when the water level is reduced and the concentra
tion levels of many of these metals exceed the Enviromental Protection
Agency water quality goals for the protection of aquatic life.
Over time, these metals settle into the sediments at the bottom of the
reservoir, and the concentrations in the actual water decrease.
The Penn Mine has already been under some scrutiny in recent years,
because there is a large amount of acid metal-rich drainage coming from the
actual mined area into the reservoir. This toxic water flowed into the reser
voir unhindered, resulting in huge fish kills.
This hazard was reduced in 1978 when land was bulldozed to create

small ponds above the reservoir, which caught most of the drainage.
Although this alleviated the problem, the drainage could still reached the
reservoir by seeping through fissures in the rock into the groundwater, until
a partial solution was developed in 1978.
The slag dump is not included in this current cleanup project. Because
there are metals seeping into the water from both the mine itself and the
slag dump. Parsons needed to determine how much toxic material was com
ing from the slag dump itself.
"It is difficult to prove that [the slag] contributed directly to fish kills,"
Parsons said, referring to some of the fish that have died in the reservoir.
The concentrations of metals are definitely present in the slag, but the
question remains of how much of that metal is seeping into the water. This
depends on thegeophysical parameters of the site.
Even if humans do not come in direct contact with the water, it could still
be unsafe. Worms or other sedimentary animals may take in the metals
from their habitat, which may be passed up the food chain to fish and then
to humans. However, Parsons said the Penn Mine slag dump does not pose
a significant threat to humans.
However, the safety of the Penn Mine cannot be automatically assumed
when approaching other slag problems across the globe. A variety of fac
tors contribute to the effect the slag metals will have on the environment.
"Each site needs to be investigated individually as part of a cleanup
plan," he said.
Parsons' research was presented at the American Geophysical Union
fall meeting last month in San Francisco.
