# Doctor revisits his Iranian homeland
## 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Iran. In many Americans, simply
the name evokes deeply ingrained
stereotypes of fervent, violently anti-
American sentiment and religious
terrorism.
However, a Stanford doctor who
recently returned to his Iranian
homeland to teach medical tech
niques found a very different situa
tion. The Iran he saw is a nation hop
ing to put past hostilities behind it
and establish a mutual, open rela
tionship with the United States.
Camran Nezhat, a clinical profes
sor of surgery and gynecology at the
School of Medicine, returned last
month from a two-week trip to Iran.
He was accompanied by Mark Vier
ra. an assistant professor of surgery.
The pair of doctors intended to
teach Iranian medical faculty the sur
gical technique of video laparoscopy,
and they delivered lectures at four
state-run medical schools in different
cities.
However, they found that they
were serving a greater purpose as
well.
"It turned out that we were most
ly attempting to open up a dialogue
between the medical communities
and hopefully between the two coun
tries once again," Nezhat said.

Nezhat left Iran for the United
States in 1973 after graduating from
the University of Teheran Medical
School. "There was a very strong re
lationship between Iran and the U.S.
many years ago, when I left the coun
try," he said.
But in 1979, a revolution led by
the Ayatollah Khomeini trans
formed Iran into a strict Muslim
state. U.S.-Iran relations collapsed as
Iran characterized America as an
embodiment of Satan, and the Unit
ed States branded Iran a terrorist
state.
According to Nezhat, the people
of Iran are hoping for that to change.
"Persians are very nostalgic about
America.' They can't wait to have that
old relationship again: an academic,
political and cultural relationship,"
he said.
Nezhat said he believes that the
anti-American sentiment, which the
media portrays as commonplace in
Iran, is virtually nonexistent.
"I saw absolutely zero. It was
probably a very small minority in the
country which you saw on television
in the past, but I think in their heart
even the militants and the radicals
want to have a relationship with
America,"he said.
Nezhat also noticed a drastic re
versal in the political freedoms and
economic status of the Iranian peo
ple. When he left in 1973, he said,
"Iran was very prosperous, but at
that time most Iranians were uncom
fortable because there was very little
freedom of speech. There was a
dreaded Secret Service that was
awful. You couldn't even talk to your
own family about the government,"
added Ne/hat.
Now, upon returning, he said that
the situation has changed. He ob
served that freedom of speech was
respected now. "I saw that Iranian
people could talk about anything
that they wanted," he said.
However, while freedoms have
increased, economic conditions have
deteriorated. "The country turned
out to be very poor," he said. "It was
overpopulated, extremely polluted
and there was lots of traffic, and it
was shocking."

During his tours of the Iranian
hospitals, Nezhat noticed a stark con
trast between private and govern
ment hospitals.
"The private hospitals were com
pletely equipped, and they looked
excellent," he said. He added that
they contained virtually all of the ad
vanced machines and devices that
American hospitals possess.
"Only the very wealthy can afford
to go to such hospitals," he said.
Meanwhile, most Iranians can
only afford to go to the government's
university-run hospitals, which
Ne/hat described as, "very pcx>r."
'"They lacked many essentials, even
the most basic instruments, products
and materials," he said.
Overall, Nezhat said his trip was a
worthwhile experience from which
he learned a great deal.
"I felt very strongly that the Iran
ian people want to have their rela
tionship with America be open again
Not even one person made us
feel unwelcome. Everybody was
pleasant towards us."
