# Sawislak will get two more years
## History prof gets another chance for tenure 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawislak has re
ceived an offer to return to Stanford after a
lengthy series of appeals challenging the School
of Humanities and Science's decision to deny
her tenure in the spring of 1997.
After reviewing the recommendation of the
University's Advisory Board, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper decided to extend Sawis
lak's appointment, which ended last summer, to
August 31, 2(MK). The board comprised of six
faculty members was divided on the issue; four
sided with Sawislak, and two sided against her.
"I'm very pleased with the findings of the
Advisory Board majority... but dismayed that
President Casper did not accept their recom
mendation," said Sawislak, who has not decid
ed whether or not to accept the offer. A labor
historian, she currently has a research fellow
ship at Harvard University.
Casper said he reconsidered her case due to
the "exceptionally incautious feedback" she re
ceived from the History Department and con
cerns that she was "substantially misled about
|her] progress in meeting University stan

dards."
Assistant professors are often granted or de
nied tenure following their

initial seven-year appoint
ment. Sawislak, however,
spent a year on a fellowship
away from Stanford and did
not use a University policy
that would have allowed her
to delay her tenure review a
year due to the fellowship.
Sawislak's tenure review

began in 19% at the start of her seventh year.
Her departmental tenure committee voted
unanimously — with one abstention — to rec
ommend tenure. The University Committee on
Appointments and Promotions also recom
mended tenure, but the deans of Humanities
and Sciences voted against tenure by a three-to
one vote.
Sawislak then filed a grievance, arguing that
the dean's decision relied on "improper and un
fair criteria" and was unsupported by evidence.
John Shoven, then dean of humanities and
sciences, denied her grievance in the fall of


Sawislak
IW7. Sawislak next appealed to
Provost Condoleezza Rice and was
again rejected.

Left wilh one last appeal, Sawis
lak filed a grievance last spring.
Throughout the grievance
process, students and faculty re
sponded to her multiple rejections
with rallies and protests. The Sawis
lak case was a catalyst for discussion

of the University's treatment of fe
male junior faculty.
"If she chooses to come hack and
try again ... I think she would be in
a stronger position." said History
Prof. Cieorge Fredrickson, who
called himself a "proponent" of

Sawislak. "1 think she would in all
likelihood receive tenure."
"I wish he'd just give her tenure,"
said doctoral student Paul Herman, a
former advisee of Sawislak. He called
Casper's decision "unsatisfying" and
labeled it an effort to avoid litigation.
