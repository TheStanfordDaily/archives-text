# Too keyed up
## System for locked-out grads overwhelmed 
### Bruce Wang Staff writer 
ITie Graduate Student Residences Office is
looking for ways to alleviate the stress on its five
student key holders, who handle the lockout
problems for more than 3,000 graduate students.
Due to changes in how graduate residence
services are delivered to students, lockout prob
lems are now handled by five on-call master key
holders. Graduate Resident Assistants who used
to handle lockout problems were eliminated in a
cost-cutting measure last year.
The key holders handle the lockouts for all
graduate student residents. There is one person
each for Rains Houses, Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Hall, and Lvman Residences. Escon

dido Village has two key holders due to its large
size. Each key holder is paid $S(X) per quarter
and is exempt from the housing draw.
Lockout problems are reported by paging the
appropriate key holder. The key holders are on
call and available any time that the local resi
dence office is not open.
For example, in Escondido Village, that
would mean any time after 5 p.m. and before 9
a.m. during the week and all during the weekend.
In the case of Lyman Residences, whose office is
only open four hours a day, the key holder must
be on-call for all but 20 hours during the week.
During the on-call hours, the key holders are
required to respond within 20 minutes of a pag-
ing request. This means that the key
holder must he within 20 minutes of
campus during those times. This has
caused severe problems for the key
holders.
"It can be difficult for one person
to be on call all the time," said Chris
tine Griffith, director of graduate res
idences. 'it takes a lot of time," Grif
lith said, "and we've learned that 20
minutes is a difficult goal to meet."
Catherine Rose, a mechanical en
gineering doctoral student and a
community assistant in Crothers
Hall, said that the key holder for
('rothers and Crothers Memorial had
to ask her tocover the shift just so that
she could pick up a family member at
the airport.
"It creates a lot of inconveniences
because they have to be within 20
minutes at all times," Rose said.
The severe constraints of the job
have led some people to resign their
positions. Rose said that the key
holder in Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Hall had to resign because
it created too many conflicts with her
schedule.
"We have had some turnover for
the key holder positions," Griffith
said, "but I wouldn't want to attribute
the difference just to the job." Some
students quit because of graduation
and other reasons.
"The lockout people have taken
these positions very seriously.
They've been very conscientious
about meeting the 20-minute re
quirement." (iriffith said.
According to Rose, there are only
about five lockouts per week that the
key holder must respond to. But as
(iriflith noted, they tend to come at
"inopportune times." The majority of

the lockouts occur at the beginning
and the end of the quarter, but they
also tend to be around the weekend.
Rose said. Griffith said there have
not been a lot of late-night lockouts.
Because of the severe restraint put
on the key holders, Griffith is consid
ering amendments to the program.
"Since we have no history to work
from," Griffith said, "we're learning
as we go."
One of the options that has been
proposed is to add one more key
holder for each of the residences.
"Rains had two key holders for a
good portion of the fall quarter and it
worked a whole lot better," Griffith
said.
"It makes it a lot easier to split the
shifts with another student so that
one person is only on call 3 to 4 days a
week as opposed to the entire week."
said C iriffith. According to Rose, the
of fice of I lousing and Dining is trying
to provide funding for the additional
key holders.
(irif 112 ith said she was also reconsid
ering the .20-minute response time re
quirement.
Some students have proposed dis
tributing two keys per student, like in
off-campus apartments. "It doesn't
necessarily completely take care of
the lockout issue," Griffith said. "It's
something that we're going to take a
look at, but we want to look at all the
options first."
The change from GRAs to key
holders has not affected the residents
too much. "There were some con
cerns early on from the residents,"
said Griffith, "but there are fewer
problems now."
According to Rose, the returning
residents actually like the new sys
tem better because instead of run
ning around to find the different
(iRAs. they now only have to make
one call.
