"My daughter, Regina, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. She was 35 years
old at the time. There was nothing the doctors could do. We had discussed
organ and tissue donation together as a family and Regina told us she
wanted to become a donor. I miss Regina very
much, but every day I find comfort in knowing
I did what she wanted." ■. •
