## Gulag records to be published 
### Hasan McGee Contributing writer 
The Hoover Institution and the
State Archives of the Russian Feder
ation have teamed up to publish the
records of the Soviet gulag, the sys
tem of prison camps in which cold,
disease, malnutrition and summary
executions killed some 20 million
people during Josef Stalin's rule.
According to Russian and East
European Studies Prof. David Hol
loway. director of the Institute for In
ternational Studies, publishing the
never-before-released gulag records
will give him and other researchers
"a good understanding of how the
gulag ... was run, how prisoners
were treated and how they died."
The gulag, a Russian acronym for
Chief Administration of Corrective
Labor ('amps, was governed by Stal
in until his death in 1953, though
prison camps continued to exist in
the Soviet I Inion after his death.
The half-million dollar project
will publish documents from the
gulag records that illustrate its entire
history from 1922 to 1960. It will con
sist of two parts: microfilms of the 1.5
million pages of related documents
held by the Russian Federation and
six print volumes that will contain
several thousand of the most impor
tant documents.
The six-volume print edition of
the gulag records is being edited and
assembled by a 10-member editorial
board consisting of five Stanford pro
fessors and five Russian scholars.
According to Hoover Institution
deputy director Charles Palm, about
1 million pages have been put onto
microfilm so far, and the editors are
currently in the process of selecting
which documents will make it into
the print edition.
Files from the Archives of the

Central Committee of the Soviet
Communist Party, the Ministry of
Justice and the Main Directorate for
Places of Detention, the state agency
that operated the camp, will be pub
lished.
These files are said to contain in
formation such as records on health,
disease and death rates; data on
hunger strikes, executions and mass
rebellions; reports on the vast indus
trial and agricultural enterprises op
erated by the gulag; lists of prisoners;
regulations and instructions on camp
administration and operations; min
utes of meetings; and internal policy
memoranda.
Palm hopes the gulag records will
"give students and scholars a better
understanding of the history of Sovi
et Communism.
"The project will give us a full pic
ture of the gulag, the principal tool of
Stalin's reign of terror, which impris
oned 10 percent of the entire popula
tion of the Soviet Union.
"Our libraries will continue to
build their collections on history and
current affairs in the former Soviet
Union The gulag is just one of
many," Palm said. He is overseeing
the project with Sergei Mironenko,
the director of the State Archives of
the Russian Federation.
The Hoover Institution is funding
the project while workers in Moscow
carry out the research and the physi
cal process of transferring the docu
ments to microfilm.
In 1992, a similar project was com
pleted which transferred the entire
Soviet Communist Party and State
Archives to microfilm.
The current project hopes to be
come second in this series of vital So
viet documents. To date, 11 million
pages relating to the history of the
USSR have been recorded on micro
film.
