Postage increase to 33 cents
WASHINGTON (AP) — The cost of sending
most letters will rise by a penny to 33 cents on Sun
day despite a four-year run of strong profits by the
U.S. Postal Service.
Postal officials said the increase is needed because
rising costs are eating into income.
"Alter four years, we needed a small increase that
was just enough to continue our investments to main
tain quality customer and delivery service," said
Frank P. Brennan, postal vice president for corporate
relations.
It will also cost more to mail newspapers, maga
zines and most packages, although the price of mail
ing heavier letters will fall.
Sunday's increase had been expected to take
effect last summer. It was postponed at the urging of
the Postal Rate Commission and Congress, which
noted the continuing strong profits being rung up by
the Postal Service.
