# No U.S. airline deaths in 1998

WASHING lON (AF) â€” Two years after the Valu-
Jet and TWA NIX) crashes raised questions about safe
ty. U.S. airlines closed out 1998 with a little noticed
milestone: None of their 615 million passengers died in
an accident.
It appears to be the first year since the dawn of com
mercial aviation for such an achievement.
There have been at least two other years when no
one died in the crash of a U.S. jetliner, most recently
1993. But since the National Transportation Safety
Board began compiling statistics in 1967. such zeros
have always been offset by deaths in smaller, generally
propeller-driven commuter airplanes.
In 1995, no passenger died in an accident involving a
scheduled U.S. commercial airplane anywhere in the
world. That silent achievement stands in contrast to the
public outcry after the TWA and ValuJet crashes in
1996 killed a combined total of 340. The same year a
United Express commuter accident in Quincy, 111.,
killed all 12 aboard.
Government, aviation safety and airline officials
were heartened by the latest news, but they were also
quick to say that even in years when there are passen
uer deaths, the nation's aviation system remains the

safest in the world.
FA A spokesman Les Dorr said 1998's zero-fatality
count "was the result of the things that we and our
industry partners have been doing every day to make
sure that flying remains the safest form of transporta
tion."
In April, the FAA, the airlines and the aerospace
industry announced a goal to cut the aviation accident
rate by 80 percent by 2010.
Without that safety commitment, experts say. a
coming boom in worldwide aviation could result in an
airplane crash each week.
The safety drive comes two years after ValuJet
Flight 592 plunged into the Florida Everglades, killing
110, and TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island,
killing 230. ' he crashes prompted criticism of the FAA
and then-Transportation Secretary Federico Pena.
Investigators later traced the ValuJet crash to a
cargo fire, prompting the FAA to order airlines to
install systems that detect and fight cargo fires. Investi
gators still do not know what caused the TWA explo
sion, but they suspect sparks from wiring around the
plane's center fuel tank. That has prompted a series of
new inspection orders for U.S. aircraft.
