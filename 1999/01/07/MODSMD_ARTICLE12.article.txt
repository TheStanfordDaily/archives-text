# Senate may face 'test vote'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House is developing a trial
strategy to force an early vote to
show that the Senate cannot muster
the two-thirds majority required to
convict President Clinton, presiden
tial advisers said Wednesday.
The advisers said the goal is to
give Clinton's defenders a potent
political weapon in case Republi
cans press ahead with a plan to pre
sent witnesses and evidence at a
lengthy trial that the public has indi
cated it does not want.
"Once we show the two-thirds is
not there, the message is it's just a
show trial with no chance of convic
tion. And every day we can remind
the public of that," said one White
House official, who spoke only on

condition of anonymity.
Much depends on the format the
Republican Senate majority choos
es for the first trial of a president in
130 years and what rules are put in
place. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott called Wednesday night
for a "full trial" with details still to
come.
Clinton faces two articles of
impeachment accusing him of per
jury and obstruction of justice in his
efforts to conceal an affair with for
mer White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
Presidential advisers said a "test
vote" could be forced in several
ways. If the Senate adopts rules
used in past impeachment trials, a
motion lor such a sentiment could

be approved hy a simple majori
ty — 51 votes.
One White House official said
presidential lawyers have discussed
presenting, at the start of the trial, a
comprehensive, single motion to
dismiss the case against Clinton on
a variety of grounds — that the case
doesn't meet the constitutional test
of "high crimes and misde
meanors," that the evidence doesn't
support the charges, and possibly
that the articles were improperly
approved by a lame-duck House.
This adviser, who spoke on con
dition of anonymity, said the test
vote has become a key part of an
evolving White House strategy.
"We see such a vote as a de facto
end to any trial," the adviser said.
