University meets student
needs and tastes with new
Lagunita-Roble dining hall

THE DELAYS AND anxieties
accompanying the opening of the
dining hall behind Lagunita have
finally ended, and students are generally
pleased with the results. The new facility
seems to counter Lagunita Dining's ques
tionable reputation with hot, fresh and
innovative dishes and longer dining hours.
We applaud the University for relieving
severe student inconveniences and provid
ing an extensive dining hall for residents of
Lagunita and Roble. The success of this
project should be a model for future capital
innovation projects for dining halls —
except, perhaps, in its lack of punctuality.
Students had to wait patiently for the
new facility to open. Lakeside Dining was
scheduled to open at the beginning of
autumn quarter, but the need to complete
other improvements before students
arrived pushed it back until Oct. 15. When
the facility was still not complete by the
October date, facilities promised a Nov. 20
opening. When this plan failed. Housing
and Dining Services Director Keith Ciuy
vowed that the new dining hall would open
on the first day of winter quarter.
Guy lived up to his promise, and student
reactions to the new facility seem to support
Wordsworth's maxim that "Everything
worthwile comes to those who but wait."
The facility features separate dining
rooms for Lagunita and Roble residents,
and both rooms branch off from a marble
floored kitchen and central hall containing
bathrooms and black-and-white pho
tographs. Students enter from Lane L

behind Ujamaa or though the Lagunita
courtyard.
Dinner on the second night of school
included London broil roast beef, chicken
parmigian, roasted chicken, burritos, black
beans and rice, sesame noodles and an
extensive salad bar. A random five-minute
survey of students of various eating philoso
phies found delight, surprise, relief and a
hint of worry at the service of Lakeside
Dining.
While most students were pleased with
the food, several expressed concern with
the long lines and impersonal feeling of the
dining hall. With residents of Lagunita.
Roble, and frequent visitors from Sterling
Quad grabbing trays and waiting for piping
hot pizza, several students became impa
tient and frustrated with their inability to
eat comfortably in less than 45 minutes to
an hour.
Overcrowding is a difficult problem for
Dining Services to fix, and it is likely to
grow worse as students from nearby dorms
discover that Lagunita now features attrac
tive and tasty food.
While Dining Services can extend the
hours of Lakeside Dining, it is up to stu
dents to remain patient in long lines or
choose less popular dishes. The variety of
dining options along with the diversity of
student eating habits should help to dimin
ish unbearable lines as students become
used to waiting a few extra minutes for a
freshly grilled hamburger.
Student satisfaction is well worth both
the wait during construction of the facility
and the necessary wait for hot gourmet
dishes. Dining hall chefs have a chance to
show their talents, students have the oppor
tunity to enjoy fresh food, and the Univer
sity has a model of success on which to base
future dining hall renovations.
