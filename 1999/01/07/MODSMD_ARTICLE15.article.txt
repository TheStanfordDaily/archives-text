Kwanzaa references
irresponsible and wrong
In regards to Dan Geyser's column on Tuesday,
Jan. 5. entitled "We wish you a Merry Kwanzaa,"
the Black Student Union sees it as necessary to shed
light on the misinformation presented about Kwan
zaa. Mr. Geyser refers to Kwanzaa as an "African-
American spiritual holiday," when in fact Kwanzaa
was founded hy Dr. Maulana Karenga in 1%6 as a
celebration of African-American culture.
Kwanzaa's roots are in traditions, practices and
customs from the African diaspora. The "funny
names" of the principles that Mr. Geyser refers to
are actually Swahili words enlisted by Dr. Karenga
to demonstrate African-American ties to the
African continent; Kwanzaa itself means "first fruits
of the harvest."
The seven principles of Kwanzaa and their mean
ings in English are as follows: Umoja — unity,
Kujichagulia — self-determination, Ujima — collec
tive work and responsibility, Ujamaa — cooperative
economics, Nia — purpose, Kuumba — creativity
and Imani — faith.
Each of the principles are designed to promote
positive living in everyday life. Kwanzaa is not a reli
gious holiday and was not created with the intention
to replace any other holiday celebrated by African
Americans. Instead, Kwanzaa can, and often is.

observed in accordance with other holidays.
Kwanzaa is not a celebration of alienation, but
rather is a call for unity. As an example, the Black
Student Union extended a campus-wide invitation
to its annual Kwanzaa Celebration on Dec. 4, 19 l )H.
This year's program demonstrated diversity in its
audience and performers.
We encourage those, such as Mr. Geyser, con
fused about the holiday to attend next year's Kwan
zaa event. For those of you who wish to have some
factual information about Kwanzaa, members of the
Black Student Union will be in White Plaza today at
lunch distributing handouts.
In closing, the BSU challenges the entire Stan
ford student body to part from the confining, Euro
centric notion of race and culture that is presented in
Mr. Geyser's column. We find it ironic that the same
day the Daily reported on Stanford's standing as the
lOth-rated school for black students that ethnocicn
tric comments with racist undertones were featured
in the Opinions section.
For further information, the following books can
be found in the Stanford libraries:
Maulana Karenga's, "Kwanzaa: Origin. Concepts,
Practice, I'he African-American holiday of Kwan
zaa: A Celebration of Family, Community & Cul
ture" and "Introduction to Black Studies."
