## The 						roar of university toilets 
### 
They say you
can't go home
again. After spend
ing the past few weeks
there, I'm starting to
agree. Not for the usual
reasons, though; I don't
think I've changed that

much since coming to college, and I certain
ly haven't left a wayward youth behind (I
guess, in order to leave it anywhere, you
need one to begin with).
I have, however, gotten used to some
conveniences that simply don't exist back at
home.
In so many ways, life is better at Stan
ford, and not just because of the (ireek sys
tem. Look at the rolling foothills or the
beautiful campus architecture. Relish the
occasional California sun and our lack ol
inclement weather. Cherish Stanford's
embrace of individual academic pursuits.
Delight in its support of multicultural edu
cation. Stand in awe of our utmost devotion
to political correctness. What a university!
What an education! What a life!
Despite all of this higher-education
glory, there remains one overwhelming fea
ture that single-handedly makes life at Stan
ford better. You can have your foothills and
political correctness. Steal my California
sun away. Drop my inflated grades to the
C's and D's I deserve. I don't care. No.
ma'am. Take it all away.
Just don't touch my water pressure.

Don't roll your eyes at me. Water pres
sure is the main reason I'll never be able to
go home again (or anywhere else, for that
matter). Don't pretend you don't know
what I'm talking about. We've all showered
here at Stanford (yes, even those of you in
the self-ops). We've all faced the brunt of
Stanford faucets. We've all felt our skin Hay
off from the ra/or-sharp drill of University
shower heads. We all know that water pres
sure is the single most underrated feature ot
this grand institution.
Let's take a quick glance at Stanford's
plumbing.
We have the best toilets in the free
world, and not just because we're fortunate
enough to have others clean them. Check
out the water pressure in these babies. Have
you used one lately? If not. go ahead; I'll
wait. Better yet. just bring me along (isn't
that what newspapers are for?).
Regardless, Stanford toilets generate
some serious sucking power. Go ahead and
flush. Whoosh! "What? What did you say?
Sorry. I can't hear you. I just flushed. Wait
until my ears stop bleeding." Whoosh!
Granted, these toilets are loud, our bath
room tissue feels like waxed paper and the
conditions are often far from sanitary (espe
cially for the men), but thanks to the Uni
versity's incredible water pressure, I've yet
to flood a bathroom at Stanford. And
believe me, I'm a tough customer.
Back home and far from Stanford, how
ever, it's quite a different story. At home.

there's no such thing as a "whoosh" from
our toilets. They produce much more of &
quiet "gurgle, gurgle." Unfortunately, tran
quillity is not a characteristic I admire in a
toilet. Though they may sound like peaceful
mountain streams, these toilets prove inef
fective at performing their mandated flush
ing duties. The Davi toilets clear about a
gallon an hour, which equates to nearly
three squares of toilet paper per Hush, and.
oh. about 3(X) flushes per bathroom visit.
As a result, bathroom trips at home are
quite literally all-day affairs. I won't kid you
— the bathroom is one of my favorite
places — but by the time I finally get out of
there, I've already got to go again. I sweftr I
didn't need reservations as a kid.
Looking back on my time at Stanford. I
realize this luxurious collegiate life has
spoiled me. After three years here, I main
tain nothing short of a full-fledged depen
dence on insanely high water pressure. I
cannot live without the driving force of a
shower head or the intense "whoosh" from
my porcelain friends.
It's true what they say. You really carl'n
go home again. And to those naysayers wHo
argue that there's nothing like home swifst
home, you can Hush that sentiment, well,
you know where.
Just don't try it at my house.
