## Vanessa Bartsch Development threatens to bury the Farm 
### 
I AM FRUSTRATED and disappointed
with Stanford University. For the first
time in my four years at this university I
feel utterly voiceless.
From the bureaucratic mess that makes
University decisions, an edict has floated
down from the tower of Hoover and settled
gloomily around "the Farm."
I mean literally around the Farm.
With the dawning of 1999, a process has
begun to drive away a farm that has existed
on this land for over 123 years.
On Jan. 1, the University reclaimed the
fjrst ot two parcels of land it intends to strip
of its history and purpose to develop.
Many Stanfordites may not even realize
that a barn still exists on this campus. In fact.
I am almost certain that a few guileless souls
are unaware that just over a hundred years
ago the very land on which we tromp to class
was world-famous.
It was here, on the first 8.8(H) acres of land
.purchased by Governor and later Senator
Leland Stanford, that the magnificent Stan
ford Stock Farm was built and a world-class
race horse breeding program began. It was
here where the photographic experiments

conducted by Eadweard Nuvbrudge led not
only to a better gaited horse, but also to the
idea of moving pictures.
There are still remnants of a farm. The
Red Barn is run by an outside leaser who
maintains the grounds that are left. Through
this arrangement, students can still take rid
ing classes through the Athletics Department
and many private horses are kept with those
belonging to the Equestrian Center.
However, the center's horses are not oth
erwise affiliated with the University. The
only direct tie is the student-founded and run
Stanford equestrian team. For four years I
have been part of this club sport sanctioned
by the I USA. the Intercollegiate Horse Show
Association.
The Equestrian Team is a coed team com
prised of 28 members of all riding abilities
who share a common goal of creating an
environment for learning, teaching and com
peting. We compete at universities within
California and regularly send riders to the
national competition held each spring.
The team defies the stereotypical percep
tions about horses that are prevalent in many
areas of the countrv. The riders on our team

are down-to-earth students who put time
into learning the skills of riding and also
donate the immense hours required to main
tain the few horses we can afford to keep.
Even with all of our work, we barely stay
afloat. The rent of a stall at our own Stanford
stable, for our own Stanford team, is among
the highest in the country. The team is
expected to pay the full amount on every
horse we keep in a stall or out in the field.
The $S(X),(XX) in donations solicited by
members of the Stanford Equestrian team
for the University in the 1980s for the con
struction of a second large barn has been
completely ignored by the University powers
responsible for drafting the outside lease of
the facilities.
In fact, the historic Red Barn's 27 stalls do
not provide a home for a single Stanford
Equestrian Team horse.
The field is about the only thing allowing
us to keep the five horses we currently own
or borrow, as it is over $ 1()0 cheaper than the
$475 a month required per stall.
As of December, however, we were
informed that this field, along with the hunt
field next to it — the only riding space out

side of the ring — is to be used to build more
housing.
I understand that the lack of housing has
reached a critical level, but 1 don't under
stand why a single person from the Universi
ty has never solicited the opinion of the
boarders of the center or any member of the
equestrian team.
The University decided to inform us
shortly before the holiday break that we
were losing the hunt field as of Jan. 1, and
then the home of our horses one year from
that date.
Now the "Farm" is being reduced further,
and 1 fear this historic land and the history
that accompanies it will simply disappear.
Few people realize that Escondido Vil
lage used to be a massive thoroughbred race
horse breeding facility.
The driving range was once covered by
acres of barley, alfalfa, corn and vineyards.
An old Stanford barn, long since sacrificed to
the Stanford Shopping Center, used to be the
center of a wine production facility.
Another ancient barn has been taken for
the use of the athletics department to store
golf course maintenance equipment.

I guess time allows people to
after Leland Stanford's death in 1893«tfce6(X)
horses that the farm had bred arid raisfcd
were sold off at a minuscule fraction of their
I
value to help the financially ailing university
stay afloat.
1 am not advocating thai this University
he "given back to the land."' I am not
ungrateful for all this University has provid
ed. 1 am not denying that we need cheaper
housing in the area.
But 1 am questioning why we are forget
ting the farm. Why when 1 return as an alum
this coming year I will no longer find the
Stanford Equestrian Team around the Red
Barn, as the team will no longer be able to
pay for the stalls in the barn they found the
money to build. Why the IHSA is discussing
becoming NCAA-sanctioned and teams
around the nation are going varsity, but our
school, founded on a farm, can't even leave
its team room to try.
