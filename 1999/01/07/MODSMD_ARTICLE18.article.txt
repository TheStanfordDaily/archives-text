Senior Shane Cross (174 lbs.)
posted the only win against the
Ducks, with senior Zach Zimmerer
registering a forfeit. Cross fought to
a tough 1-0 win with the only point
being scored on an escape early in
the second period. Cross then rode
out the Ducks' Shawn O'Rourke for
the entire third period, which capped
off a big win.
"1 felt good, but 1 could have been
a little more aggressive in my
match," said Cross.
The most thrilling match against

Oregon pitted junior Warren
McPherson (165) against returning
Pacific 10 Conference champion
Sean Morgan, a senior who is ranked
10th in the nation.
After a scoreless first period, the
pair traded escapes to knot the score
at 1-1 going into overtime. McPher
son won the coin toss, choosing the
bottom position for the 30-second
overtime, but fell short when he was
unable to escape, giving the win to
Morgan.
"I was right there and it was pos
sible for me to come out on top,"
McPherson said. "If a couple of key
situations went the other way I could
have pulled off the win."
Stanford coach Chris Horpel felt
the team could have shown a better
effort against the Ducks.
"1 am disappointed with the
matches against Oregon. I think we
simply got outmanned and this
match did not represent us and how
we can compete," he said.
The Cardinal bounced back to
hang with nationally ranked Har
vard in the second dual of the night.
Junior Tim Kendall (I<S4) provid
ed a spark for Stanford with a 6-0 vic
tory over Harvard freshman Joe Me-

Caffrey.
Stanford junior captain Zach
Zimmerer provided the most domi
nating performance of the night with
a 5-1 win against Harvard.
Zimmerer scored three back
points and a two point reversal with
39 seconds left against a totally de
fensive Picarsic, who fought off im
pressive shots by Zimmerer the en
tire match.
Freshman Kenji Arai (141) was
simply outclassed by Harvard All-
American senior Dustin DeNunzio,
and Junior Frank Ruiz (149) fell 7-5
to senior Joel Friedman.
Two of the later matches, howev
er. provided the most excitement
and displayed the potential of the
Cardinal squad.
Leading off was senior captain
Beau Weiner (157). who displayed
great moves and control en route to
a 6-3 win.
Weiner began the scoring with a
spectacular fireman's carry take
down, in which he took Harvard ju
nior Kevin Kurtz over his head and
straight to the mat. Weiner scored an
escape and a late takedown to finish
the second period leading 5-0. In the
third, Kurtz scored three quick

points, but Weiner displayed veter
an poise and controlled the rest of
the match.
McPherson again made the night
interesting, this time against Har
vard junior Joey Killar, who is cur
rently ranked sixth in the nation. A
timid first period led to a 2-1 lead for
Killar after a takedown and a penal

ty point to McPherson for slamming.
An escape resulted in a 3-1 lead for
Killar after two periods. An escape
at the beginning of the third period
cut the lead to 3-2, but McPherson
was unable to take Killar down and
came out on the losing end.
Cross registered his second win of
the night with a 3-2 decision over

Harvard senior Luke Goble.
Stanford faces off against UC-
Davis on Saturday at Burnham
Pavilion. The Cardinal and Aggies
seem to be evenly matched and ac
cording to Horpel and the team, it
will come down to who has the edge
that night in terms of mental tough
ness and desire.
