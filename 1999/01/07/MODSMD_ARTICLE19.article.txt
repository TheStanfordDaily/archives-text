# PAC-10 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW
## UCLA Bruins could be the next reigning Pac-10 champs 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
With the California Bears mak
ing their way to Maples Pavilion to
morrow night to play the Cardinal
in women's basketball, there can be
little denying that the Pacific 10
conference season is now in full
swing. And for quite a long time
now, this would be the time when
Stanford would shine. Conference
time equaled Cardinal time.
This year, however, things might
be a bit different.
While last season marked Stan
ford's ninth conference title in 10
seasons, a younger Cardinal team
will have to deal with several tough
conference opponents this season.
Another Stanford title would be
expecting a bit much. No. 10
UCLA, currently the only Pac-10
team to be ranked nationally, will
prove to be the team to beat this
season, although several teams
could wrestle a few wins from the
Bruins.
There are definitely two tiers in
this year's conference and the Bru
ins could certainly struggle at some
point with any of the top-four
teams.
The Pac-10 sent five teams to the
NCAA tournament during each of
the past two seasons, and it could
very well send four to five again this
year.
With one weekend in the confer
ence season already complete, here
is a look at how we think the teams

will finish this year.
1. UCLA For the first time in 10
years, the Stanford Cardinal is not
the conference favorite — the
UCLA Bruins are. In fact, while the
Bruins have never even won a Pac
-10 title, this might just be their year.
And for good reason.
With four starters back from a
team that made a legitimate run at
the conference title last season and
fell in a heartbreaking 75-74 loss
during the second round of the
NCAAs, head coach Kathy Olivi
er's Bruins have two of the best
players in the conference, and pos
sibly the nation, on the floor.
Preseason All-American and
two-time All-Pac-10 selection May
lana Martin is already averaging
17.7 points and 10.3 rebounds per
game down low.
Helping get her the ball, howev
er, and lead the No. 10 squad in the
nation is point guard and 1997-98
All-Pac-10 first team member Erica
Gomez. Averaging 8.7 assists per
game, Gomez is currently third in
the nation in this category.
Gomez and Martin are certainly
not alone, though. Aided by two
other quick guards, LaCresha Flan
nigan and Michelle Greco, center
Janae Hubbard (13.6 ppg) and for
ward Marie Philman (11.1 ppg), the
Bruins definitely have one of the
most balanced attacks in the con
ference.
The title is there for the Bruins'
taking.

2. Oregon Ready or not, here they
come. The Ducks have had five
straight winning seasons and with
their 63-59 win over Stanford on
Monday, now have a record of 11-2
during this one. Like UCLA, they
return four starters from an NCAA
tournament team.
Two former Pac-10 All-Fresh
men lead the way for the Ducks this
season in sophomore forwards An
gelina Wolvertand Brianne Mehar
ry. Meharry leads the team in
points, averaging 12.5 ppg, while
both she and Wolvert are grabbing
over live boards per game.
One of the teams true strengths,
however, is defense. Oregon has
been shutting down its opponents,
forcing them to shoot a lousy 35.4
percent from the field, good
enough to be the best defense in the
conference.
The Ducks' biggest test of the
conference season will come this
Sunday when they travel to face the
No. 10 Bruins. Should they be able
to hold UCLA, they might just
make a run at the conference title.
(tie) 3. Washington This team could
be tough. Although the Huskies
have not gotten off to the best of
starts (5-5 overall), Washington will
turn it on in the end thanks to a lot
of experience.
Seniors, and All-American can
didates, Jamie Redd and Amber
Hall are already showing that the
Huskies should not be taken lightlv

this season. Redd is averaging 16.5
ppg while Hall is getting almost 10
boards a night. An All-Pac-10 team
member. Hall led the conference in
rebounding the past two seasons
and Redd finished second in the
conference last year with her 19.3
PPg-

last year will drive these women to

UCLA's Maylana Martin is a huge threat in both the scoring and the
rebounding departments.

Stanford's Lindsey Yamasaki
might be the best freshman in
the conference this season.
