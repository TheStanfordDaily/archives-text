# PAC-10 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW
## UCLA Bruins could be the next reigning Pac-10 champs 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
With the California Bears mak
ing their way to Maples Pavilion to
morrow night to play the Cardinal
in women's basketball, there can be
little denying that the Pacific 10
conference season is now in full
swing. And for quite a long time
now, this would be the time when
Stanford would shine. Conference
time equaled Cardinal time.
This year, however, things might
be a bit different.
While last season marked Stan
ford's ninth conference title in 10
seasons, a younger Cardinal team
will have to deal with several tough
conference opponents this season.
Another Stanford title would be
expecting a bit much. No. 10
UCLA, currently the only Pac-10
team to be ranked nationally, will
prove to be the team to beat this
season, although several teams
could wrestle a few wins from the
Bruins.
There are definitely two tiers in
this year's conference and the Bru
ins could certainly struggle at some
point with any of the top-four
teams.
The Pac-10 sent five teams to the
NCAA tournament during each of
the past two seasons, and it could
very well send four to five again this
year.
With one weekend in the confer
ence season already complete, here
is a look at how we think the teams

will finish this year.
1. UCLA For the first time in 10
years, the Stanford Cardinal is not
the conference favorite — the
UCLA Bruins are. In fact, while the
Bruins have never even won a Pac
-10 title, this might just be their year.
And for good reason.
With four starters back from a
team that made a legitimate run at
the conference title last season and
fell in a heartbreaking 75-74 loss
during the second round of the
NCAAs, head coach Kathy Olivi
er's Bruins have two of the best
players in the conference, and pos
sibly the nation, on the floor.
Preseason All-American and
two-time All-Pac-10 selection May
lana Martin is already averaging
17.7 points and 10.3 rebounds per
game down low.
Helping get her the ball, howev
er, and lead the No. 10 squad in the
nation is point guard and 1997-98
All-Pac-10 first team member Erica
Gomez. Averaging 8.7 assists per
game, Gomez is currently third in
the nation in this category.
Gomez and Martin are certainly
not alone, though. Aided by two
other quick guards, LaCresha Flan
nigan and Michelle Greco, center
Janae Hubbard (13.6 ppg) and for
ward Marie Philman (11.1 ppg), the
Bruins definitely have one of the
most balanced attacks in the con
ference.
The title is there for the Bruins'
taking.

2. Oregon Ready or not, here they
come. The Ducks have had five
straight winning seasons and with
their 63-59 win over Stanford on
Monday, now have a record of 11-2
during this one. Like UCLA, they
return four starters from an NCAA
tournament team.
Two former Pac-10 All-Fresh
men lead the way for the Ducks this
season in sophomore forwards An
gelina Wolvertand Brianne Mehar
ry. Meharry leads the team in
points, averaging 12.5 ppg, while
both she and Wolvert are grabbing
over live boards per game.
One of the teams true strengths,
however, is defense. Oregon has
been shutting down its opponents,
forcing them to shoot a lousy 35.4
percent from the field, good
enough to be the best defense in the
conference.
The Ducks' biggest test of the
conference season will come this
Sunday when they travel to face the
No. 10 Bruins. Should they be able
to hold UCLA, they might just
make a run at the conference title.
(tie) 3. Washington This team could
be tough. Although the Huskies
have not gotten off to the best of
starts (5-5 overall), Washington will
turn it on in the end thanks to a lot
of experience.
Seniors, and All-American can
didates, Jamie Redd and Amber
Hall are already showing that the
Huskies should not be taken lightlv

this season. Redd is averaging 16.5
ppg while Hall is getting almost 10
boards a night. An All-Pac-10 team
member. Hall led the conference in
rebounding the past two seasons
and Redd finished second in the
conference last year with her 19.3
PPg-
A mediocre conference finish
last year will drive these women to

a stronger finish this season, and the
Huskies could surprise some by fin
ishing up there with the contenders.
An NCAA tournament appearance
is extremely likely.
(tie) 3. Stanford So the Cardinal is
young. So what? It is still Tar a Van-
Derveer's team and it is still the
p
s|ime program that has an all-time
record among the top 25 winningest
Teams in NCAA Division I women's
basketball history. Since 1990 alone.

Stanford has won two NCAA
Championships and lias made six
Final Four appearances.
That being said, this will definite
ly not be as easy a year as those of
the past for the unranked Cardinal.
Already dropping a conference
game to Oregon, Stanford will need
to get back on track before hosting
UCLA and IJSC next week.
Sparking the ( 'ardinal is 6-foot-6
center Carolyn Moos, averaging
14.4 ppg along with Lindsey Ya
masaki (14.1 ppg). who just might be
the best freshman in the conference
this year. Yamasaki has been amaz
ing in her debut and will grow even

stronger as the season progress.
Running the point, Milena Flores
brings both leadership and much
needed experience to the team. A
junior, Flores is the only non-fresh
man or sophomore in the starting
lineup.
Don't be surprised to see Stan
ford back in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
5. Arizona Here is a squad that
made it to the Sweet 16 of last year's
NCAA tournament and had the best
season in school history. The odds of
this happening this year, are slim.
Without last year's Pae-1() Player

of the Year. Adia Barnes, and sev
eral other Wildcat leaders, Arizona
will turn to a younger, yet still tal
ented team.
Juniors Felicity Willis and Lisa
Griffith will need to use their expe
rience as the only two returning
starters to help guide this team. In
addition to already ranking third in
the conference in assists, Willis is
proving to be a scoring threat with
her 13.2 ppg.
Arizona will be a bubble team.
With a little bit of good fortune, the
Wildcats just might get to see a post
season.

6. Washington State Welcome to
the second tier.
Washington State didn't make
the tournament last year and it
probably won't again this season.
The Cougars return the Pac-1()
Freshman of the Year in forward
Alke Dietel, who currently leads the
conference's players with her aver
age of 19 ppg in her 10 games this
season. With 12 lettermen returning
from last year's squad, the team cer
tainly has talent. Hut it is still young.
One more year, and the Cougars
might just be looking to take the
title. One more year, not this one.

7. USC Here is a team that certainly
had some talent coming into the sea
son. Had, of course, is the key word.
The Women of Troy have found
themselves shorthanded since the
preseason. Guard Kiyoko Miller is
out with a sprained right shoulder.
Guard Erica Mashia is done for the
season thanks to an ACL injury.
Guard Kim Clark is out indefinitely
due to a broken leg she suffered
while playing midfield for USC's
soccer team. Second-year Trojan
coach Chris Gobrecht can't be too
happy. She could have had a con
tender.
The remaining spark for this
team is senior forward/center
Adrain Williams. Already averag
ing 16 points and 9.8 rebounds,
Williams will be one of the keys to
LJSC's season.
Not looking too good for the Tro

jans. but there could be a surprise or
two from the bench.
S. California Good old Cal. In Mari
anne Stanley's first season as head
coach of the Bears, Cal finished l()th
in the Pac-10. Her second year, she
finished 9th. This being her third
year, it seems only logical that she
would finish the year Bth.
While the Bears bring back a fair
number of players from last year's

team, 12 to be exact, there is one
thing of note. They bring back 12
players from last year's team. Last
year's team which finished 6-22.
Key to the Bears' season will be
junior forward Paige Bowie. Bowie
led the team in scoring last year
(11.0 ppg) and is doing the same this
season (11.7 ppg).
Stanley's still got a few years to
go before she gets herself a confer
ence contender.

9. Arizona State While the Sun Dev
ils have a couple key newcomers in
Teresa Jantzen and Kitch Kitchen
(the name alone should make her a
star), it will be junior center Rachel
Holt that will be the highlight of this
team's season.
Already 0-2 in conference play,
the future doesn't look too bright
for the Sun Devils.
10. Oregon State Ahhhh, the

Beavers and the No. 10 spot in the
Pac-10 Conference. Seems all too fa
miliar.
Actually, Oregon State tied for
ninth last season.
This year, the Beavers have
jumped to a wild and crazy overall
start of 9-2. Of course that wasn't
against many schools that actually
care about their basketball pro
grams.
The Beavers are also looking at a

young squad and must replace ]pt
year's leading scorer Monica Wjlts.
"Prominent reserves" from-last
year's 7-20 team look to be Oregon
State's greatest hope. Junior center
Sisel Pierce is the only returning
starter and may need to show thdse
"prominent reserves" the way.- ,•
Not much hope for the Beavers,
but hey, a 9-2 start is impressive and
may force us to bump them up in our
predictions if they keep it up. . .
