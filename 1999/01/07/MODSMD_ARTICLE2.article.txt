# Unionization well underway
## Hospital workers elect negotiating committee, union now working to organize other groups of workers 
### Marty Beard Contributing writer 
The newly-organized service em
ployees at Stanford Hospital and
Lucile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital will elect a negotiating
committee today.
At least 11 people will be chosen
to act as a liaison group between the
workers and the hospital adminis
tration when the two sides hammer
out a union contract.
"This is the first big step for these
folks as a union," said Danielle Ma
hones, an organizer with Service
Employees Union International
Local 715.
The workers voted last Novem
ber to join the union by a majority of

62 percent. Of the 1,500 workers el
igible to vote, S3 percent cast their
ballots.
The workers officially unionized
a week after the election. National
Labor Relations Board rules man
date a week-long grace period be
fore the results are final, providing a
window during which the election
results might be challenged. Since
no one has challenged the election
results, the next step is electing the
committee.
Ron Ruggiero, organizing direc
tor for the union, said it was looking
into the possibility of unionizing
other hospital workers as well.
"[Our current actions] are simi
lar to the process [we undertook]
with the service and maintenance

groups — talking with folks, finding
out what the issues are that people
want to make improvements on,"
Ruggiero said, 'it's difficult to pre
dict what's going to happen."

Hospital workers are divided
into bargaining units. For example,
the workers who voted to unionize
last November comprise one bar
gaining unit, which includes mainte
nance and dietary food service
workers, clerks, nurses' assistants,
lab technicians and housekeepers.

The three other bargaining units
— which are not unionized — are
the licensed technical unit, consist
ing of licensed vocational nurses
and cardiac technicians, cardiac
technicians and stenographers and
surgical technicians; the office cleri
cal unit, who are clerical employees
with little or no direct contact with
patients; and the clinic workers.
The move to unionize stemmed
from the merger between UCSF
and Stanford hospitals.
Among other concerns, workers
said that the merger reduced work
hours to seven and a half hours per
day from eight hours a day. meaning
that they had to squeeze the same
amount of work into less time for
less pay.
