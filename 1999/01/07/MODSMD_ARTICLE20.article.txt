## Gil Lopez Resolutions for the year 
### 
Another year over, and it's time lor me to
come up with a whole new list o( resolutions I
probably have no chance of keeping.

As futile as past attempts may have been. I
felt that to not at least try making some new
resolutions woulu be pretty pathetic, so I de
cided to share these with you. the readers.
Keep in mind that many ol these are meant
to make me a better editor / columnist / re
porter. but many are also meant to make me a

better all-around person. I'm starting to be
come about as dull and drab as this office.
Start working out more I spend a grotesque
amount of time sitting in an office or a press
box or in front of the TV watching some of the
nation's top athletes, yet I get winded if I have
to jog somewhere because I'm running late.
There's something of a poetic injustice behind
this.
Some athletes go through an entire game
without sitting on the bench for any kind of a
breather, and I get grumpy if I have to go
through an entire day without a nap.
So yes, it's time for me to hit the weight
room and the stationary bikes. Yesterday I
made my first of what hopefully will be many,
many more visits to Tresidder's workout facil
ity. and I'm a bit discouraged. A five-year-old


Gil
Lopez
kid asked me when I'd be done with
the 10-pound free weights, but I'll
manage.
Try to spend more time in non
sports-related arenas Yes, I know,
athletics are a terrific thing. I'hey're
and exhilarating. But
■ when my suite-mates have problems
secognizing me on the chance occa
sion that I run into them, then I know
0 .
'(here's a problem.
*'• There's an amazing world outside
-oi the Daily. It has people and chil
.drcn and games and, most important
*h/, sunlight. Maples on a Saturday
; may be the biggest party of the week
;to some, but hitting Sigma Chi or
* J'heta Delt would be nice. (There's a
•sentence I thought I'd never write.)
I might even try spending some
~(ime in my room when I'm actually
•Owake. Or I'll catch the occasional
* lecture or section for class.
) Maybe I'll even crack a book..
Whoa. Baby steps, Gil. You've got
Ito take baby steps.
4'
Appreciate how great college
sports really are Well, the NBA unof
ficially ended its player lockout last
"(right, so fans will get to see a bunch of
•out-of-shape professionals break
•down as they play a more grueling
•Schedule.

There's also something really had
about a grown man arguing that he
should he paid $14 million a year in
stead of only $12.25 million.
Things like this we don't have to
worry about. There will never be a
lockout or a strike in any college-level
sport. It's nice to know that most peo
ple here seem content with a free
$30,(XX)-a-year education.
I may be a Laker fan, but if
Shaquille O'Neal is huffing and puff
ing up and down the court — more so
than usual, that is — my attention will
gladly remain 1(X) percent focused on
the athletes here.
Make it to a wider variety of sport
ing events Basketball may be fun and
it may get all the hype, but no one
needs to be reminded how good all of
our programs are. We collect Sears
C'ups like Fort Knox collects gold.
So expect to see me at more
wrestling, water polo and volleyball
matches, swimming and track meets,
and of course rugby and ultimate fris
bee games.
Track down some more of those
Tree beanie-baby things I hese things
are harder to find than those Grem
lin-esque Furbies, not to mention a
lot better-looking and less annoying.
The university needs to mass-pro
duce these things before a black mar
ket starts popping up. I've got a bunch
of nieces that would die to get their
hands on one, not to mention all the

friends that wanted me to see if I
could dig one up for them. Like I've
got Ted Leland's number on speed
dial or something.
And finally,
Write a letter to the NCAA The
Bowl C hampionship series dodged a
big bullet when UCLA and Kansas
State fell apart in their final games of
the regular season. Tennessee de
servedly won a national champi
onship, but it won't be long before we
end up with another controversy.
Why is it that some computer de
cides that Florida State deserved to
go to the Fiesta Bowl? If the Semi
noles had won, there could have been
another team that finished 11-1 and
had a reasonable claim to the nation
al championship system.
With 22 bowl games, almost half
of Division I's football teams make it
to the postseason. Now that's
overkill. I love tradition, but it's time
for a playoff. Use all those freakish
bowls like the Insight.com Bowl and
the Humanitarian Bowl (the blue As
troturf has got to go) for the early
rounds, and use three of the real
bowls like the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta
and Rose for the final four teams.
And never, ever again allow Tosti
tos to put their name in bigger print
than they use for "Fiesta Bowl."

Gil Lopez promises not to reuse these
resolutions next. He 'll come up with all
new ureas to fail in.

needs to be reminded how good all of
our programs are. We collect Sears
C'ups like Fort Knox collects gold.
So expect to see me at more
wrestling, water polo and volleyball
matches, swimming and track meets,
and of course rugby and ultimate fris
bee games.
Track down some more of those
Tree beanie-baby things I hese things
are harder to find than those Grem
lin-esque Furbies, not to mention a
lot better-looking and less annoying.
The university needs to mass-pro
duce these things before a black mar
ket starts popping up. I've got a bunch
of nieces that would die to get their
hands on one, not to mention all the

friends that wanted me to see if I
could dig one up for them. Like I've
got Ted Leland's number on speed
dial or something.
And finally,
Write a letter to the NCAA The
Bowl C hampionship series dodged a
big bullet when UCLA and Kansas
State fell apart in their final games of
the regular season. Tennessee de
servedly won a national champi
onship, but it won't be long before we
end up with another controversy.
Why is it that some computer de
cides that Florida State deserved to
go to the Fiesta Bowl? If the Semi
noles had won, there could have been
another team that finished 11-1 and
had a reasonable claim to the nation
al championship system.
With 22 bowl games, almost half
of Division I's football teams make it
to the postseason. Now that's
overkill. I love tradition, but it's time
for a playoff. Use all those freakish
bowls like the Insight.com Bowl and
the Humanitarian Bowl (the blue As
troturf has got to go) for the early
rounds, and use three of the real
bowls like the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta
and Rose for the final four teams.
And never, ever again allow Tosti
tos to put their name in bigger print
than they use for "Fiesta Bowl."

Gil Lopez promises not to reuse these
resolutions next. He 'll come up with all
new ureas to fail in.
