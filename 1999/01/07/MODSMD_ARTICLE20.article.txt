## Gil Lopez Resolutions for the year 
### 
Another year over, and it's time lor me to
come up with a whole new list o( resolutions I
probably have no chance of keeping.

As futile as past attempts may have been. I
felt that to not at least try making some new
resolutions woulu be pretty pathetic, so I de
cided to share these with you. the readers.
Keep in mind that many ol these are meant
to make me a better editor / columnist / re
porter. but many are also meant to make me a

better all-around person. I'm starting to be
come about as dull and drab as this office.
Start working out more I spend a grotesque
amount of time sitting in an office or a press
box or in front of the TV watching some of the
nation's top athletes, yet I get winded if I have
to jog somewhere because I'm running late.
There's something of a poetic injustice behind
this.
Some athletes go through an entire game
without sitting on the bench for any kind of a
breather, and I get grumpy if I have to go
through an entire day without a nap.
So yes, it's time for me to hit the weight
room and the stationary bikes. Yesterday I
made my first of what hopefully will be many,
many more visits to Tresidder's workout facil
ity. and I'm a bit discouraged. A five-year-old
