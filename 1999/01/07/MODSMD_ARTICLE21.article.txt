# It's all in the family for Stanford
## 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
What is the secret of success to the
Stanford men's volleyball program? With
three sets of brothers on the 1999 roster,
one could say it's in the genes.
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves did
not have to look beyond the siblings of
current Cardinal players to fill half of the
spaces for the freshmen recruiting class.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: Season Opener: Stanford vs.
Sacramento State, 7 p.m., Burnham Pavil
ion.

Two freshmen on the team have older
brothers who are currently competing for
the Cardinal. Freshman setter Larry Witt
joins outside hitter Andy on the court.
Freshman middle blocker Jonathan Pala
cios plays at the same position as his older
brother. Josh.
"I've never had the opportunity to be

on the court before with my brother," the
elder Palacios said.
Sophomore setter Brad Griffith and
senior outside hitter Chris Griffith round
out the sibling pairs.
Eleven sets of brothers have played or
currently play volleyball for the Cardinal.
This formula has created a program which
has provided consistent contenders for
the NCAA championships almost every
year: Stanford won the 1997 NCAA
Championship and ended the 1998 season
with an eighth-place national ranking.
Coming off a season in which Stanford
tied for second in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation, the Cardinal enters
this season with the intention of returning
to the NCAA Championship.
"Our goal each and every year is to win
the NCAA Championship," Nieves said.
The Cardinal opens its 1999 season
tonight at 7 p.m. against the Sacramento
State Hornets.
Although Stanford has attained promi
nence in the collegiate volleyball realm.

Sacamento State is a club team that re
mains a hit mysterious to the Cardinal.
"We don't know much about them"
Palacios said. "We don't know what to ex
pect and we haven't seen any tapes of
their matches."
In the past. The Hornets' degree of tal
ent has surprised both the Cardinal and
other Western volleyball powerhouses.
Last year, the Cardinal struggled be
fore pulling off a four game victory over
Sacramento State. In the UC-Santa Bar
bara tournament last season, the Hornets
placed second out of 24 teams, a finish
ahead of many varsity teams, including
Stanford.
Because the Sacramento State volley
hall team lacks a varsity status, this game
cannot affect Stanford's record or stand
ing within the MPSF.
Furthermore, this early-season game
enables the Cardinal to establish momen
tum for the rest of the season. Nieves does
not downplay the significance of
this first game.
"Winning our first match is crit
ical for our own sense of accom
plishment," N'ieves said. "We want
to get in the habit of winning as
early as possible."
This game will also be a barom
eter for ways in which the team can
progress throughout the season.
Nieves will rely on the experi
ence and leadership of outside hit
ters Andy Witt and Gabe Gardner.
Both players spent last summer
training with the U.S. National
Team.
" Andy and Gabe have the phys
ical ability to lead this team against
anybody," Nieves said.
Andy Witt was a starting mem
ber of Stanford's 1997 team which
won the National Championship
and he also attained First Team
All-America honors last season.
Although starting his junior
year of eligibility, Gardner will
compete in his first collegiate
match for Stanford. Gardner
earned All-Freshman team honors
his first year at IJSC. He played in
15 matches his second year at USC
before deciding to transfer to Stan
ford.
Nieves will rely not only on the
skills of these two players, but also

their leadership capabilities.
"I would like to see Andy and
Gahe perform like the leaders they
are capable of being," Nieves said.
Despite the strength and depth
at the position of outside hitter, un
certainty arises at the position of
middle blocker.
Nieves will look to four players
to fill the void left by 1998 gradu
ates Tad Hoffman and Keenan
Whitehurst. Last year, the duo pro
vided stability at the middle block
er position and compiled 531 kills
for the Cardinal.
Tonight's game will test Stan
ford's ability to compensate for its
inexperience at that middle block
er position. Veterans Jeremy Bart
and Josh Palacios were both origi
nally recruited for other positions,
but this season the players are like
ly candidates to fill the void at the
middle blocker position.
"I'm all for it and willing to ac
cept the new role," Palacios said.
Two sophomores, Brett Young
berg and Dan Zhang also show
promise as middle blockers, yet
their inexperience typifies the Car
dinal's weakness in this areas.
Two inexperienced players will
figure to play prominent roles for
the Cardinal this year. At the posi
tion of outside hitter, freshman
Marcus Skacel will complement
the skills of Gardner and Andy
Witt. Another freshman, Larry
Witt, has put himself in a competi

tive position with last season's set
ters Josh Lukens and Brad Griffith.
"The freshmen will have a lot of
chances this year," Larry Witt said.
"A lot of the team's success will
rest on the improvement of the
freshman class."
