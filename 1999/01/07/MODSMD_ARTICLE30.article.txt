# Blues and Whites
## Interview An Ivy Leaguer's journey to the heart of the Delta 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Adam Gussow has in recent years energized the blues
world as the harmonica component of the blues duo
Satan 8c Adam. His seamless application of the once rad
ical overblow technique to traditional blues had made
him one of the most innovative harmonica players in the
world. Teamed with Sterling "Mr. Satan" Magee, Gussow
released their first album "Harlem Blues" in 1991, fol
lowed by "Mother Mojo" and "Livin* on the River."
Satan 8c Adam, however, is no ordinary blues band.
Gussow is the young, white, harmonica half, warbling,
meandering through sweet-sad chromatic scales with
ingratiating ease. Mr. Satan is the other half, the guitar,
percussion and vocals half, a wild, blistering talent
wrapped up in the body of an elderly black man with
flowing white dreadlocks.
Gussow, now a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton, has just
published his first book, entitled "Mister Satan's
Apprentice." In it he chronicles the unlikely duo's first
meeting in the racially charged atmosphere of late 1980s
Harlem up to the release of "Harlem Blues," with detours
through his undergrad years at Princeton and his tour
with the national touring company "Big River."
Intermission: How difficult was it crossing genres,
from blues musician to authorf
Adam Gussow: One guide in this is Ralph Ellison, who
was a trumpet player, really the only other guy who's done
both. I had to think about how to give literary form to a
feeling I had had; the musician's feeling of moving down
into a free place from which your best solos could come,
a movement down into some place. I got a wonderful
example of this from Ellison's "The Invisible Man," where
he's smoking the reefer and listening to Louis Armstrong,
and the author is descending through black history, to a
parent's generation and through to a grandparent's gen
eration. Now of course I couldn't do that, but it was the
experience of moving down into a place from where your
best solos could come, and in two or three sections of the
book I tried to work with that idea. It began as a musi
cian's experience that I was looking for a way of describ
ing - searching for appropriate metaphors.
I have one of the sections where I'm hearing Mr. Satan,
and I'll come up with a metaphor I haven't used. It's
almost that he was this tidal wave that was coming at me
and let's say there was this tidal wall and there was all
these leaks in the dike and I could see where all the holes
were and you only have ten fingers but I could plug all the
holes at the right time. I just knew where all the holes
were. Which gives you the idea that all the time I spent
with him was trying to match him, to perfectly comple
ment him. Not just trying to apply preexisting musical
licks — that was the hardest musical lesson with him —
but to actually, finally create something. There'd be many
times when he'd play something and I'd play a lick that
might work for 10 times but then one time I'd try some
thing else and all of a sudden I was doubling the inner
lick and you could feel everything come into focus. And
you could feel his energy picking up, like it was an organ
ism.
I: In your book, you pretty much tell it all, both tri
umphs and disasters. Was it at all difficult disclosing
such a complete history of yourself?
AG: First of all, it might seem like a complete history,
but you never really put everything in. I worried — here's
what I'll say. I wrote the whole book with no background
— there was no Rockland Country Day, no Helen, no
grad school the first time. A couple of first readers said
they had a problem with that. They said that after about

50 pages, you're playing the harp pretty competently.
There must have been some humiliations, some failures,
and I hadn't told them about that. My agent, I mean, I
trust her all the way down the line, and she asked the
same thing.
I said, you want to hear some humiliations, and I men
tioned my first college band, the Bordash Brothers, and
how I had all this nerve, and I was both terrified and
nervy, ready to take a huge risk as terrified as I was. And
playing in Harlem, that was just one of the later examples
of that. With the book finished, the Harlem stuff, the Big
River stuff, I then went back and began with, well, why
did I get my first harmonica? And started at the day
school.
I went back and wrote 70 pages jumping through the
book saying "where should that little snippet be"? There's
another choice I made

I had to then
decide, what

the voice
should

be
and

I
made

a delib
era t e

decision that

it would be in a

personal voice but one
that would be dispersonal as to the age of the voice. So
when Adam gets his first harmonica, I wanted a voice dis
placed towards a white boy 17-year-old with a measure of
innocence — a lack of knowledge he'll get later on.
There's danger with this, which is there's a way in which
this guy is a little callow, a little raw.
Here's what I'd say, if you're going to tell a story about
a white guy ending up learning how to play blues you've
got to show the distance he came. In a sense not to judge,
to let the reader figure it out. There's one moment early
on when I talk about getting The Great Bluesmen album
and a black guy I worked for, and how I thought some
how older black guys had the key. "Older black guys"- it's
almost a condescending phrase and yet it's sort of the way
this guy, this young Adam might have thought, and of
course here he is working for formen who probably had a
lot to teach him about if he had known what questions to
ask. But he says that Mr. Foreman didn't play an instru
ment, so that was a dead end.
And then you have this record, which is basically a
wildly romanticized version of blues. On the cover there's

this Johnny Walker bottle, two crumpled dollar bills, a
battered harp. There's the naked woman with the bared
breasts whose head is hidden by a gin bottle. That is the
romantic view of what blues is about — a battered heart,
sort of like a battered harp. I've had couple reviewers say
ing I wrote a wildly romanticized view of the blues —
they got it half right. There are shreds of it, but I think
reviewers have overlooked the other side.
The hidden meaning of this book is for a white person
to really understand what it's about is to do that, to real
ly hurt, maybe a kind of spiritual opening that lets you
move much closer to understand the meanings of what
that music can do. That "Sweet Harlem Summer" is my
favorite chapter in the whole book, because it's about a
white blues harpist trying to hear the silence between his
notes; that is to say death. And not a single person who's
written a review of the book has figured that out and it's
frustrating.
I: Has being a Ph.D. student ever closed off doors to
you musically? That is, have people ever dismissed you
before hearing you play because you're an Ivy Leaguer?
AG: Generally. Again, the phrase "Ivy League" is a
strange phrase that tends to be used as a counter. Again, I
want to invoke Ralph Ellison —he said a lot of
Americans tend to confuse skin color and behavior,
thinking that telling us someone's skin color, you've told
us about their behavior. In fact you haven't told us a lot
about them at all. I want to tell you something — there
was a reviewer in Time Out New York who accused me,
in an otherwise positive review, that I was playing a faux
nai'f. As if I had pretended I didn't recognize U2 or that 1
hadn't seen "Star Wars." Fact is, I was far more interested
in blues then I was in rock and roll. So he didn't get the
book. There's no natural relationship between white sub
urban kids and Aerosmith, just as there's no natural rela
tionship between an older black man and the blues. In the
book I talked about giving an older black guy harmonica
lessons — he didn't know anything about it. He wasn't
very good at it. And I didn't know about Aerosmith. I
hadn't heard the name.
Well, Bonnie Raitt went to Radcliffe, Stanley Jordan
was a classmate of mine at Princeton. But I don't think he
got a lot for that — I'm a grad student now, so I think
that raises other questions, but once I start playing, they
can usually forget I have another life. The reason why it
tends to make people anxious is because a lot of people
are living partial lives. They've developed on part of
themselves and neglected another and they've used cul
ture to make up for a part of it. So you take "elite culture
white folks" in quotes, and a lot of them are missing
something. And a certain part of that social group goes to
blues — because blues is body music, balls music, sexy,
juicy, return of the repressed music. That's your quote.
I: What's your advice to aspiring bluesmeni
AG: You use that phrase bluesman, and I wouldn't call
myself a bluesman. Blues players. I guess you could say
contemporary blues men, but...
Well, I have no advice to aspiring white blues singers,
except to be very good or else it's not worth doing.
(chuckles)
"White and Black" — they're terrible words, they tell
more lies than they do truths. I use them to get past what
ever ability those words have to hurt us and get to the
point where we can enjoy each other's company. Then
people begin to get past the visual — that skin color thing
Ralph Ellison was talking about. So my advice to your
aspiring blues player is to seek out these scenes. They're
precious — they're grounded in surprising amounts of
generosity and love and tolerance. And when you find
those scenes, you'll find that you do a lot of learning.

feeling I had had; the musician's feeling of moving down
into a free place from which your best solos could come,
a movement down into some place. I got a wonderful
example of this from Ellison's "The Invisible Man," where
he's smoking the reefer and listening to Louis Armstrong,
and the author is descending through black history, to a
parent's generation and through to a grandparent's gen
eration. Now of course I couldn't do that, but it was the
experience of moving down into a place from where your
best solos could come, and in two or three sections of the
book I tried to work with that idea. It began as a musi
cian's experience that I was looking for a way of describ
ing - searching for appropriate metaphors.
I have one of the sections where I'm hearing Mr. Satan,
and I'll come up with a metaphor I haven't used. It's
almost that he was this tidal wave that was coming at me
and let's say there was this tidal wall and there was all
these leaks in the dike and I could see where all the holes
were and you only have ten fingers but I could plug all the
holes at the right time. I just knew where all the holes
were. Which gives you the idea that all the time I spent
with him was trying to match him, to perfectly comple
ment him. Not just trying to apply preexisting musical
licks — that was the hardest musical lesson with him —
but to actually, finally create something. There'd be many
times when he'd play something and I'd play a lick that
might work for 10 times but then one time I'd try some
thing else and all of a sudden I was doubling the inner
lick and you could feel everything come into focus. And
you could feel his energy picking up, like it was an organ
ism.
I: In your book, you pretty much tell it all, both tri
umphs and disasters. Was it at all difficult disclosing
such a complete history of yourself?
AG: First of all, it might seem like a complete history,
but you never really put everything in. I worried — here's
what I'll say. I wrote the whole book with no background
— there was no Rockland Country Day, no Helen, no
grad school the first time. A couple of first readers said
they had a problem with that. They said that after about

50 pages, you're playing the harp pretty competently.
There must have been some humiliations, some failures,
and I hadn't told them about that. My agent, I mean, I
trust her all the way down the line, and she asked the
same thing.
I said, you want to hear some humiliations, and I men
tioned my first college band, the Bordash Brothers, and
how I had all this nerve, and I was both terrified and
nervy, ready to take a huge risk as terrified as I was. And
playing in Harlem, that was just one of the later examples
of that. With the book finished, the Harlem stuff, the Big
River stuff, I then went back and began with, well, why
did I get my first harmonica? And started at the day
school.
I went back and wrote 70 pages jumping through the
book saying "where should that little snippet be"? There's
another choice I made

I had to then
decide, what

the voice
should

be
and

I
made

a delib
era t e

decision that

it would be in a

personal voice but one
that would be dispersonal as to the age of the voice. So
when Adam gets his first harmonica, I wanted a voice dis
placed towards a white boy 17-year-old with a measure of
innocence — a lack of knowledge he'll get later on.
There's danger with this, which is there's a way in which
this guy is a little callow, a little raw.
Here's what I'd say, if you're going to tell a story about
a white guy ending up learning how to play blues you've
got to show the distance he came. In a sense not to judge,
to let the reader figure it out. There's one moment early
on when I talk about getting The Great Bluesmen album
and a black guy I worked for, and how I thought some
how older black guys had the key. "Older black guys"- it's
almost a condescending phrase and yet it's sort of the way
this guy, this young Adam might have thought, and of
course here he is working for formen who probably had a
lot to teach him about if he had known what questions to
ask. But he says that Mr. Foreman didn't play an instru
ment, so that was a dead end.
And then you have this record, which is basically a
wildly romanticized version of blues. On the cover there's

this Johnny Walker bottle, two crumpled dollar bills, a
battered harp. There's the naked woman with the bared
breasts whose head is hidden by a gin bottle. That is the
romantic view of what blues is about — a battered heart,
sort of like a battered harp. I've had couple reviewers say
ing I wrote a wildly romanticized view of the blues —
they got it half right. There are shreds of it, but I think
reviewers have overlooked the other side.
The hidden meaning of this book is for a white person
to really understand what it's about is to do that, to real
ly hurt, maybe a kind of spiritual opening that lets you
move much closer to understand the meanings of what
that music can do. That "Sweet Harlem Summer" is my
favorite chapter in the whole book, because it's about a
white blues harpist trying to hear the silence between his
notes; that is to say death. And not a single person who's
written a review of the book has figured that out and it's
frustrating.
I: Has being a Ph.D. student ever closed off doors to
you musically? That is, have people ever dismissed you
before hearing you play because you're an Ivy Leaguer?
AG: Generally. Again, the phrase "Ivy League" is a
strange phrase that tends to be used as a counter. Again, I
want to invoke Ralph Ellison —he said a lot of
Americans tend to confuse skin color and behavior,
thinking that telling us someone's skin color, you've told
us about their behavior. In fact you haven't told us a lot
about them at all. I want to tell you something — there
was a reviewer in Time Out New York who accused me,
in an otherwise positive review, that I was playing a faux
nai'f. As if I had pretended I didn't recognize U2 or that 1
hadn't seen "Star Wars." Fact is, I was far more interested
in blues then I was in rock and roll. So he didn't get the
book. There's no natural relationship between white sub
urban kids and Aerosmith, just as there's no natural rela
tionship between an older black man and the blues. In the
book I talked about giving an older black guy harmonica
lessons — he didn't know anything about it. He wasn't
very good at it. And I didn't know about Aerosmith. I
hadn't heard the name.
Well, Bonnie Raitt went to Radcliffe, Stanley Jordan
was a classmate of mine at Princeton. But I don't think he
got a lot for that — I'm a grad student now, so I think
that raises other questions, but once I start playing, they
can usually forget I have another life. The reason why it
tends to make people anxious is because a lot of people
are living partial lives. They've developed on part of
themselves and neglected another and they've used cul
ture to make up for a part of it. So you take "elite culture
white folks" in quotes, and a lot of them are missing
something. And a certain part of that social group goes to
blues — because blues is body music, balls music, sexy,
juicy, return of the repressed music. That's your quote.
I: What's your advice to aspiring bluesmeni
AG: You use that phrase bluesman, and I wouldn't call
myself a bluesman. Blues players. I guess you could say
contemporary blues men, but...
Well, I have no advice to aspiring white blues singers,
except to be very good or else it's not worth doing.
(chuckles)
"White and Black" — they're terrible words, they tell
more lies than they do truths. I use them to get past what
ever ability those words have to hurt us and get to the
point where we can enjoy each other's company. Then
people begin to get past the visual — that skin color thing
Ralph Ellison was talking about. So my advice to your
aspiring blues player is to seek out these scenes. They're
precious — they're grounded in surprising amounts of
generosity and love and tolerance. And when you find
those scenes, you'll find that you do a lot of learning.

Adam Gussow has in recent years energized the blues
world as the harmonica component of the blues duo
Satan 8c Adam. His seamless application of the once rad
ical overblow technique to traditional blues had made
him one of the most innovative harmonica players in the
world. Teamed with Sterling "Mr. Satan" Magee, Gussow
released their first album "Harlem Blues" in 1991, fol
lowed by "Mother Mojo" and "Livin* on the River."
Satan 8c Adam, however, is no ordinary blues band.
Gussow is the young, white, harmonica half, warbling,
meandering through sweet-sad chromatic scales with
ingratiating ease. Mr. Satan is the other half, the guitar,
percussion and vocals half, a wild, blistering talent
wrapped up in the body of an elderly black man with
flowing white dreadlocks.
Gussow, now a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton, has just
published his first book, entitled "Mister Satan's
Apprentice." In it he chronicles the unlikely duo's first
meeting in the racially charged atmosphere of late 1980s
Harlem up to the release of "Harlem Blues," with detours
through his undergrad years at Princeton and his tour
with the national touring company "Big River."
Intermission: How difficult was it crossing genres,
from blues musician to authorf
Adam Gussow: One guide in this is Ralph Ellison, who
was a trumpet player, really the only other guy who's done
both. I had to think about how to give literary form to a
feeling I had had; the musician's feeling of moving down
into a free place from which your best solos could come,
