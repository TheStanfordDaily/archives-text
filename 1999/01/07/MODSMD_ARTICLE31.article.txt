## Movie Review & Interview An interview with director Bill Condon 
### Randy Mano Staff writer 
Intermission recently talked with director Bill Condon
one-on-one. He is at the center of the whirlwind of talk over
"Gods and Monsters," which is up for three nominations
(including best picture) in the Golden Globes. Here, he dis
cusses the ins and outs of Hollywood as well as his entrance
into Tinseltown as a film director.
Intermission: You started out in New York City. Did
you always see yourself going into the arts?
Bill Condon: I always wanted to go into movies, to
direct movies. I felt lucky that I knew what I wanted to do.
I moved out to Los Angeles to go to the UCLA film
school. I also wrote about movies and a producer had
read something I had written. He called me up and asked
if I had any ideas — of course, 1 said yes and began work
ing for him. I wrote a couple of movies which he direct
ed, "Strange Behavior" and "Strange Invaders." So I never
wound up going to film school.
I: I've noticed that your past movies have mostly dealt
with horror or dramas. Do you envision yourself
remaining within that genre as a director?
BC: The next movie I want to do is called "Vicki
Oberjon: Alone in the Night," and it's very much in the
spirit of "Spinal Tap" or "Waiting for Guffman," a sort of
improvisional comedy. It's sort of a faux-documentary,
and "Gods and Monsters" has a lot of stuff in it that's
pretty funny too.
I: You worked with a number of stars in this film, like
Brendan Eraser, lan McKellen and Lynn Redgrave. Do
you find that there is a difference between working with

bigger names or smaller names?
BC: I've been pretty lucky, working with Gwyneth
Paltrow, Roger Moore, Gregory Hines, Pierce Brosnan,
Jennifer Jason Leigh — some big people — and they're
all wonderful to work with in their own way. I've never
come across anybody who was into any real star thing yet.
It'll happen at some point, but you work with someone
like lan McKellen, and it can be intimidating when you
face him because he's such a brilliant actor and he's done
so much amazing work. But within five minutes he makes
you feel comfortable, just starting to talk about the script.
He was just amazing to work with, so open
I: You got Clive Barker to work as an executive pro
ducer on "Gods and Monsters." How did you get that to
happen?
BC: I did a movie with him a few years ago, and we
were looking to do something together. When I bought
the rights to the novel ("Father of Frankenstein"), I went
to him and I asked if he wanted to be the patron. He has
been doing that recently, by helping other directors get
their movies going by using his clout and name. There are
lots of parallels between him and James Whale — both
are from the Nortn of England, both moved to
Hollywood, both are expatriates living there now, they
make horror films, Clive was a painter like Whale, Clive is
also gay. He was very open to the idea, and he helped us a
lot when we were getting the money together.
I: You say that you bought the rights to the book. Why
were you attracted to it?
BC: I loved James Whale's movies, and when I read
[the book) I realized tha. there was a great potential to
make a movie about James Whale in the style of Whale. I
thought the book was wonderful, a really rich portrait of

a section of a certain
kind of man, an artist
who is losing his powers.
I: On a Web site, I
noticed that the working
title was the book's title,
"Father of Franken
stein," and then you
changed it to "Gods and
Monsters." Is there a
reason for this change?
BC: We didn't want
the film to seem like
another Frankenstein
movie. This is the point
of the novel, since James

Whale was actually the father of "Frankenstein." But we
didn't want this to seem like just another horror movie.
I: And you snuck the title's name into the film!
BC: It's a quote from "Bride of Frankenstein." The
fruity old doctor says, "To a whole new world of gods and
monsters."
I: Do you have any advice for students who are strug
gling through making their films and documentaries?
BC: That's a good question. These students who are
making their first films need to stay as true to what the
film is about as possible. This should then be reflected in
the style in which they make them. I think that is the
essence of making good movies and not putting a lot of
flash out for its own sake. Although if you're interested in
getting jobs in Hollywood, that would probably be very
effective.
