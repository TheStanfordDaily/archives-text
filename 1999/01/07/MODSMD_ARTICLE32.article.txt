# Tame 'Monsters'
## Intensity is lacking in this over-hyped film 
### 
With aIJ of the acclaim circling Bill Condon's
film, viewers are going to expect a near master
piece. It is not. Far from it, "Gods and
Monsters" merely strings together a series of
sequences — some visually alluring, others completely
unnecessary — which play out like a bio-pic without
much cohesion or definition.
The main redeeming factor of the movie is lan

McKellen's performance as James Whale, a washed-up
director who enjoyed his heyday with the making of
"Frankenstein." 1 highly enjoyed McKellen's work as a for
mer Nazi leader haunted by his past in the recent film
"Apt Pupil." Here, he once again showcases his talents.
McKellen has been gaining special recognition from
awards groups, and rightfully so, since his performance
underscores perfectly the sexual ambiguity of his charac
ters' relationships with both Clayton Boone (Brendan
Fraser), his gardener, and Hanna, his maid-servant.
It is a distinct possibility that I simply do not care for
Brendan Fraser's acting style. By "acting style," 1 speak of
his penchant for playing roles where he is painfully dumb
or unaware, as in his take on the caveman in "Encino
Man" or the ape man in "George of the Jungle."
Sometimes, the movie can make up for his shortcomings
in acting range. "Gods and Monsters" can't quite do it,
and much of the problem can be attributed to Fraser's
performance, for his important role as portrait subject
for James and boy-toy at parties fall short and lack
nuanced development.
The last pieces of the puzzle are the two women in
Clayton's and James' lives. Hanna, subtly played by Lynn
Redgrave, lives as a devout servant and distant friend for
James. She rarely approves of his lifestyle habits, and she
constantly badgers him to be careful or else face the wrath
of a heart attack. Sure enough, her premonition comes
true, but it hardly matters. James will continue to attend
to his sexual urges, whether he's with a film interviewer or
his manly gardener.

Clayton's love interest is Betty — a truly trashy woman
taken in form by Lolita Davidovich. Clayton honestly
deserves better, and soon he faces the fact that, once
dumped by Betty, he has become rather attached to his
half-nude sessions of art and advice with James.
Regardless of James' intentions, Clayton largely puts up
with any moments of discomfort for the sake of their
companionship.
My main problem with "Gods and Monsters" was not
the acting, which was leagues ahead of last year's paper
thin "Titanic" efforts, or the length of the film, as in this
year's overly-long "The Thin Red Line," but rather the
coherence and message of the movie. Even when the
credits rolled, I felt a bit dismayed — it truly felt like a
schmaltzy and confusing way to bring James Whale's life
tc; a close. The flashbacks taken from James' mind come
too frequently and interrupt the flow of the action. Are
they really all necessary? The best used example lakes
place during his days on the fabulously re-created
Frankenstein" set, as he interacted with his main stars to
get just the right look.
Gods and Monsters" falls from the sky as the suppos
edly remarkable creation of Bill Condon, but instead it is
only an attempt to reach up to the heights of "Saving
Private Ryan" and"The Truman Show," the two films to
beat come late March.
