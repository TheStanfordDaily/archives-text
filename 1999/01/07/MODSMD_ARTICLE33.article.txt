- o say that someone is an "active Stanford
student" seems rather redundant. All
over campus, people are running, playing
games of three-on-three basketball, or
combating the blinking lights of

Stairmasters. The rigor of academics and other activities
makes it difficult to fit exercise and sports into a busy
schedule, yet many students do make the time.

But Stanford's Athletes — with a capital A, the ones
we read about in the Sports section of the Daily or cheer
on at matches and meets — dedicate themselves to
something inaddition to physical well-being or self-

improvement: a team. Moreover, teams at
this university have an extraordinarily
high caliber for a school with similarly
high academics, or any school, for that
matter. Winning the Sears Cup for the last
four years, Stanford has had the highest
level of performance for any NCAA pro
gram in the country.
Ask athletes why they are so dedicated
to their sport, and the answer will proba
bly include the word "team." Or, as junior
earth system's major Sean Joy of men's
water polo put it:"The guys ... When
you get down to the end of the season,
you win or lose as a team. In those pres
sure situations, when you succeed it's real-

ly worth it."
Indeed, at important athletic events,
the emotional commitments of a team are
visible, whether in the euphoria of a win
or the despondency at a loss. The high
drama of team emotions makes for good
photographs, for rarely in society are
bonds between people displayed so pub
licly. Carly Smolak, a sophomore earth
systems major on the women's soccer
team, described the level of those bonds:
"Even if I had personal differences, I truly
feel that with my teammates, there is that
closeness ... like family. That's definitely
the word: family." And "family" was in fact
a word that many other athletes used as
well to describe their teams.
Even in sports that emphasize individ
ual performance, athletes talk about the
importance of their teams. For example,

the men's swim team has a goal meeting
in which everyone talks about his goals for the season.
Each swimmer has individual goals, but, "Basically, it's
just team-oriented," said Brian Rodde, a sophomore eco
nomics major. "Our goal is to win an NCAA champi
onship. We really aren't happy if we don't."
Student Life
As has been often remarked by coaches and motiva
tional speakers for time eternal, the correct spelling of
"team" has no "I." Stanford athletes have to balance the
individual demands of classes with the group demands
of practice and competition. Conflicts are bound to
occur. Carey Cloyd, a senior English major, who is a field
hockey player, said, "I don't find getting my work done a
problem, but it does influence your academics in a neg
ative way. You don't take afternoon classes. You can't go
to office hours. It's all those extra little things."

Cloyd also described what might seem like a strange
problem. After her season is finished, "I have a hard time
adjusting to the sudden free time — more time to put
things off, for going to different talks, going to Bechtel,
or going to meetings of organizations."
The difficulty in adjusting to off-season life points
out how differently structured the year of the student
athlete can be. All of the fall sports teams arrive on cam
pus five weeks before classes start. And during the sea
son, competitions fall on every weekend, with traveling
roughly every other weekend. How much time athletes
spend on competition varies from sport to sport, but
NCAA regulations stipulate a maximum 20 hours a
week. In season, then, athletes see their teammates a lot;
many said "24-7."
Arriving early and spending much of fall quarter with

their teammates can make the freshman athlete experi
ence quite different from that of other freshmen. Smolak
said in the five weeks before classes started, she spent
"absolutely every second" with her team. And even
though she already felt close to her teammates, when the
rest of the freshman class arrived, "I was so excited. I
don't think I've ever been happier."
Brandon Berkenbile, a freshman on the gymnastics
team, said, "It's been difficult to be social." He mostly
hangs out with other gymnasts, especially the six fresh
men on his team. He added that he has managed to go
to quite a few parties.
Joy said that his fall quarter was really hard because
he was gone on the weekends so much to participate in
matches. Still, he made it a point not to miss out. When
his season was over, he quickly began participating in
the typical freshman dorm experiences such as ski trips.
And though he had been gone much of the fall quarter,
he fit in well with the rest of the dorm because, he did

n't get lost in the beginning-of-the-year shuffle: "1 was
just one more person to get to know, instead of 100 peo
ple in September"
Athlete Cliquei
Joy's experience is not unusual. As he put it: "When
you're in season, you have to balance your studies before
everything else, so the only people you see are your
teammates." He also added that he likes to hang out with
"not just athletes" But is there a clique of athletes at
Stanford? All of the athletes mentioned that being an
athlete, with training, practice and conditioning, means
that they do see a lot of each other — at Arrillaga, on
practice fields, in the pool, etc.
"There is kind of an athletic community," said Cloyd.

"You see people at Arrillaga, or you see
people around campus in Stanford
apparel. There are a lot of similarities
with other athletes. These are people
who spend the same amount of time as
you do with your sport."
Joy also mentioned how athletes cheer
each other on at key matches or games.
"We definitely support each other."
But ultimately, in terms of athletics
affecting the groups of people that ath
letes hang out with, it comes back to that
team thing. Rodde, who lives with six
sophomore swimmers in Mirrielees,
described being on the team as almost
like being in a frat. After morning prac
tice, the team often goes over to Wilbur
for breakfast. Smolak emphasized the
intense bonding, such that, "out of sea
son, you start to miss your teammates."
And Kristi Wright, a sophomore on the
synchronized swimming team, said that
"your teammates see you on your worst
and best days. You go through everything
with them, and it's often on an emotion
al level."
This phenomenon has its roots in
freshman year as well, for the team
dynamic means it's a welcoming envi
ronment for a freshman new to the cam
pus. "It's kind of like a mini-campus,"
said Smolak. "A personalized one.
Seniors just watch out for you, make fun
of you when you're carrying the bags for
travel. It really breaks down the barriers
for everyone."

Other athletes also mentioned the mentoring role
that upperclass athletes play for the youngest members
of the team. This might include assistance with picking
out classes, negotiating the bureaucracy of a large uni
versity and social interaction. This can occur on a formal
level as well with the Partners in Academic Excellence
program, which is designed to provide peer advising and
additional discussion time for class materials. Rodde,
who's a mentor for the P.A.E. program, described it as
being curriculum-based, but providing a social outlet as
well.
Even while in high school, athletes begin the process
of initiation into college life and athletics. Coaches often
begin scouting promising athletes during junior year in
high school. By senior year, athletes will have had many
conversations with the coaches of schools that they are
considering to discuss grades and letters of intent. But
when they actually visit campus, their reactions are usu
ally similar to any prospective frosh. Joy said that mem-



Next stop, the World Cup.
