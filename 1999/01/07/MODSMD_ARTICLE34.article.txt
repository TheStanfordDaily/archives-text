bers of the team took him to the Black Light Party at the Phi Delta Theta house ("Their
job is to make sure you have a good time"). He reacted as any high school student might
to the ecstatic hedonism of a major campus party. "I said to myself, 'W0w.... This is
college' "He laughed and added that a couple of other recruits he came with didn't end
up picking Stanford. "Maybe because.... " One can only speculate what effect the
Black Light party had on the athletes' decision.

Bonding occurs in many ways, with practice being generally the base of a team's com
mitment Other things can bring a team closer as well. Sometimes a team will spend
Thanksgiving or other major holidays together. Joy said that traveling is a major factor:
"The stuff you experience is amazing." He described the two weeks that the men's water
polo team spent traveling in Europe this last summer. That sort of vacationing is usual
ly only the sort of thing that a family or very close friends will do together. And Joy said
that "you endure so much with your team, it really is like a family," and added that the
Thanksgiving together played a large part in those feelings.
With athletes often identifying themselves as being part of an athletic community,
does dating occur more often among athletes? The experiences in this area are very
diverse among athletes. Wright said that all of her teammates are dating people who are
athletes. She said that it is easier for athletes to date other athletes because "they under
stand what you go through. They understand that you would be in a bad mood if you
had a bad practice or something. Or if you have a meet the next day, they know you can't
really go out or anything."
Rodde said that he had been on dates with girls from other teams, but that he did not
date athletes exclusively. The dates with girls on teams come from "athletic connections"
that are likely to occur if someone on one team knows a couple of people on another
team.
Joy, on the other hand, has never dated an athlete. "1 relate better with non-athletes.
Athletes always seem to be busy." He said that his involvement with the team had
brought "time pressure" to a relationship last year.
Again, the model of the family is perhaps appropriate. If a family is of a certain cul
ture or faith, then the members of that family might alternately pair off with people of
the same background or intentionally search out something different.

Athletes, then, are not an entire world apart at Stanford. Their experiences, though
often similar to each other, are not categorically different from other students. They
often wear "athletic" apparel such as sweats or baseball caps, but so do many young non
athletes in the late '90s. Athletes have concerns about time conflicts and balancing
schedules, but so do most students at this university.
Why then, the occasional sniping between athletes and non-athletes that surfaced on
the editorial page of the Daily last quarter? Athletes had a variety of responses to that
outburst, but many seemed to not take it too seriously. Most athletes disregarded the

implication that they lag behind other Stanford students academically. Smolak pointed
out that "this is Stanford. You don't just get in here." She added that athletes have to be
just as responsible for their behavior as anyone else: "If an athlete tries to put something
over other people, they're not going to be well-received."
Rodde emphasized that an athletics program is an asset to the university. "If some
one is a great scholar and a great athlete, they're a versatile student." He also said,
"Athletic teams are something the students can rally behind, and most, if not at all, stu
dents appreciate that."
Joy did note the differences between the reputations of athletes on and off campus.
"If I'm wearing a Stanford water polo jacket, people outside the campus will probably
give you respect" On campus, he was not so certain about that same respect. "There's
definitely reputations for, one, your sport and, two, for being an athlete. Some people
feel intimidated, I think, because athletes tend to be more outspoken."
And every athlete insisted that scholarships are not talked about on teams. Rodde
said that "you've got some idea because of how fast someone is, but it's rarely talked
about among the team. It really doesn't matter to us."
He surely speaks the truth, for no athletic team would survive a major schism with
in its ranks. Besides the detriment to competitiveness, simmering divisions would not
make for images as wonderful or heart-breaking as a victorious or defeated team. For
bickering partisanship, one can always watch C-SPAN.
