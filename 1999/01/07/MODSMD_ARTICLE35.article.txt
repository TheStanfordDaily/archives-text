'Stepmom' is fun but unrealistic

Some years they round up all the decent actresses and make them play hookers.
Other years they give them cancer. This is a cancer year. "Stepmom," starring
Susan Saradon and Julia Roberts is strikingly similar to this year's earlier death
fest — "One True Thing" starring Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger. Both films
attempt to reconcile the tough professional young woman with an older woman who
has attained Martha Stewart levels of hard-core domesticity. Meanwhile, older woman's
husband is absent, leaving her to struggle alone — that is until the previously uninter
ested young woman learns the joys of cooking, cleaning and childcare. Then the old
one can die from her cancer and leave everything in good hands.
Cancer is not something to be flippant about, but "Stepmom" doesn't set much of
an example — Susan Saradon gets a little dizzy once and makes a crack about how

dope is finally legal but you have to be sick to get it. The rest of the time, her illness is
a plot point and not an awful disease.
However, Saradon's acting is strong enough to convince us that her character is
determined not to wallow in self-pity or to shrink away as a pale skeletal figure of
gloom. Nevertheless, the true shock and sadness that must come with cancer is never
depicted.
So we have terminal illness. There are also really cute kids, a cute puppy, great inte
rior decorating, the star power of Julia Roberts and the wonderful earthy sincerity of
Ed Harris. All good. The gloss of the Hollywood production — most evident in the
interior decorating — is a little disconcerting, because it reminds us that this is a movie
starring Julia Roberts and Susan Saradon and not the real story of a family faced with
a transitional period in their lives. "Stepmom" is well acted, well written and funny. It'll
probably make you cry at least once, maybe more. The audience at at least one screen
ing echoed with sniffs as middle-aged women passed tissues to each other.
"Stepmom" is a perfectly nice film, sentimental but not uncomfortably so, and pep
pered with genuine animosity between the mom and stepmom. Nevertheless, it lacks
any particularly gripping quality. Without the star-power and the great interior deco
rating this could be one of the many examples of why women's movies have been rel
egated to television. Family conflict is a terribly important shaping force for many peo
ple but here it's not particularly engrossing or meaningful.
Despite their surface subjects, the most convincing family films of recent years were
"Boogie Nights" and"The Opposite of Sex" because they charted the development of a
family unit created from unrelated people who learned to love and care for each other.
"Stepmom" considers the same themes but overall effect fails to involve the audience.
"Stepmom" is probably not worth $7.50, but might be worth a half-price matinee.
Do not take your mother with you; she'll get depressed. Do not take your stepmother
with you; she'll get depressed too, but for different reasons. If you are a girl, don't take
a guy; he will not be amused. If you're a guy, I'm not going to worry about you, because
you'd probably volunteer to be drawn and quartered rather than see this thing. It's a
chick flick of the highest order and all potential viewers should be prepared ahead of
time with some Kleenex and an admiration of good decorating.
