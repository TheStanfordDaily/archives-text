# Maya Angelou gets 'Down'

### 
'Delta' is a tale of familial devotion

We tend to love stories about healing and rebirth,
when the desperate heroine leaves the mean,
dirty city and returns to her wholesome roots.
While this may be a theme we know and expect, Maya
Angelou's directorial debut, "Down in the Delta," does not
treat it superficially. "Delta" delves deeper into universal
themes of devotion and family, treating familiar issues with
a new and powerful spin. The film achieves this freshness
and-energy with the help of a believable script, original
characters and a strong cast.
Alfre Woodward leads the cast as Loretta Sinclair,
mother of an earnest 13-year-old son Thomas (Mpho
Koaho) and a younger, autistic daughter Tracy (Kulani
Hassen). Loretta and the children live in a small
Chicago apartment with her dynamic mother Rosa
Lynn, the real glue of the family, played by Mary Alice.
Thomas and his grandmother struggle to make money
and to take care of Tracy, while Loretta can't find a job
and ends up more often than not finding comfort in
drugs and alcohol.
Rosa Lynn, the spirited matriarch, loses her patience
and presents her daughter with an ultimatum. She calls
her estranged brother-in-law Earl in Mississippi, and
asks him to take Loretta, Thomas and Tracy in for the
summer. Reluctantly, he agrees. To cull money for bus
tickets, Rosa Lynn pawns the revered family heirloom,
an authentic silver candelabra that has been passed
down through many generations of the Sinclair family.
If the money isn't returned to the pawn shop by

September, the precious silver will be melted down.
Thus, Rosa gives Loretta the summer to pull herself
together, to become a responsible, financially secure
mother, and perhaps find peace through her roots.
In Mississippi, Loretta's proposed transition becomes
a reality. With Tracy and Thomas, she descends from
the bus in Mississippi in her shiny yellow hot pants, big
hair, and Chicago Bulls jacket, smoking a cigarette and
glaring at the world. The three are a disgruntled and
disconnected group, confronted by the strong and solid
Uncle Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), at the bus stop. At Earl's
house, which was once owned by the white branch of
the Sinclair family, Loretta and the kids discover a safe
and loving household, made up of Earl, his wife Annie,
who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and their kind
housekeeper (Loretta Devine).
Before our eyes, Loretta makes a change from her big
city self. Her racy pink leather numbers are exchanged
for more conservative plaid and flowered outfits. Her
cigarette smoking becomes less prominent, and she
seems to have no trouble living without drugs and alco
hol. Her relationship with her children improves dra
matically. Thomas teaches her arithmetic so that she
can work as a waitress in Uncle Earl's restaurant, Just
Chicken. This transition to a responsible and healthy
character is a little superficial, and it is unclear what
exactly motivates her change. It is also hard to believe
that she could so quickly give up drugs and alcohol. But
these hitches don't hold up the story. We want to believe

that Loretta has changed for the better, and so we do.
Thomas and Tracy also benefit from their summer in
Mississippi. Earl tells Thomas about the family history,
giving the boy a sense of belonging and dignity. These
storytelling portions of the film create the overarching
mythical frame of the Sinclair history, particularly the
legacy of the beloved family heirloom. The importance
of family is driven home with these scenes from the
Sinclair history. Tracy ends the summer seeming more
peaceful and happy; she even speaks a clear word, an
effort which results in one of the most joyous and mov
ing scenes of the whole movie.
This film is about devotion: Earl's loving devotion to
his wife, whom he takes care of with great heart and
patience, Thomas' devotion to his sister, whom he takes
care of faithfully and without complaint, and Rosa
Lynn's unfailing devotion to Loretta. Angelou's smart
direction prevents the emotional scenes from stooping
to sentimentality, and excellent performances from Al
Freeman Jr., Mary Alice and Alfre Woodward make the
film moving and inspirational.
All in all, "Down in the Delta" is a successful testa
ment to the importance of family and the power of
one's devotion to another. Maya Angelou's directorial
debut is a success, particularly thanks to impressive act
ing. This film is an inspiring tale of love, family, and
healing.
