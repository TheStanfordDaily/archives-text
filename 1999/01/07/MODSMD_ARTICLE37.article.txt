SEX! VIOLENCE! DRUGS! were not
found in the films of this holiday
season. In fact, resident film critics
Schmuck and Putz were bored to death at
the movies this Christmas — so they were
inspired to write a screenplay of their
own. They drafted several treatments
based on the flicks now playing at a the
atre near you. Here's a taste of what you
might have seen if they'd had the final
say...

Instead of "Mighty Joe Young"...
"Mighty Joe Hung"
Gorillas are big, but the world has never
met one quite this BIG before! Disney,
with the help of special effects guru Stan
Winston, brings to life this fanciful tale of
Joe, a primate who sure can rise to the
occasion. His enormous member gains
him global fame, as he tours zoos near and
far performing his masturbating monkey
routine. After a ritual circumcision in the
Tel Aviv Wild Animal Park, Joe loses his
prowess. His shrinkage leads to depression
and alcoholism. Because of the family
nature of this film, all ends in a happy
ending when Joe gets penile enlargement

surgery.
Instead of "Waking Ned Dtvine*...
"Waking Devine Brown *
Hugh Grant joins the actual Devine
Brown, the prostitute with whom he was
arrested on Sunset Boulevard, in a comic
tale that will knock your socks off (...and
your pants, and your shirt). The film asks
this provocative question: What would
have happened to Hugh Grant and Devine
Brown if they were never arrested and
then they won the lottery?
Matters get complex when Elizabeth
Hurley enters the picture. Devine refuses
to split the winning ticket three ways, and
wants half of the dough. It all ends in a
riveting menage-4-trois.
Instead of "Babe: Pig in the City"...
"Babe: Pig in the Deli"
After winning sheepdog contests and
journeying into the dark streets of a big
city, this saucy swine finally meets his
biggest enemy of all time: the deli carver.
After Babe is slaughtered, skinned and cut
into delectable cutlets and pork filets, he is
served with scrumptous mashed potatoes
to the Smith family. Leftovers are fed to
their dog, Fifi.
Instead of "Patch Adams"...
"Scratch Adams"
Robin Williams stars as Milford Adams,
a depressed medical student who discov
ers that he has the rare ability to cure
venereal diseases with laughter. His stand
up comedy approach to medicine has
appreciative patients calling him Scratch,
for his jokes serve as a constant itch on
their inflamed areas. At first he starts sim
ply with crabs, but as he gains more confi-

dence in the medical profes
sion, he ambitiously takes on
chlamydia, syphilis and genital
warts.
Love complicates Scratch's
sexual escapades when he
meets Carin, a fellow med stu
dent with herpes. Together,
they fight the STD with lerry
Lewis and Jim Carrey films
and soon open up the world's
first VD treatment center /
comedy club. Graceful, touch
ing and powerfuL
Instead of "Shakespeare in
Love",.."Kafka in Love"
Steve Buscemi, in the role of
his lifetime, stars as the unat
tractive, awkward and un
pleasant Franz Kafka. Gwyneth
Paltrow is Fraulein 8., his
muse and inspiration for"The
Hunger Artist," his novella
about starvation. As she cares
for him in his final days of bat
tling tuberculosis, she sits by
his side wasting away without
any nourishment. All the
while, Kafka writes his novel,

and the two die a wretched, painful and
miserable death. No one attends their
funerals.
Instead of "The Prince of Egypt"...
"The Duke of Egypt"
Blonde-haired, blue-eyed screen sensa
tions Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt,
Elizabeth Berkeley and Melanie Griffith
offer just a few of the ethnic Hebrew voic
es to this epic animated feature about a
very distant cousin of Moses, Shlomo Ben

Katzenberg. Talmudic scholars argue that
he was the primary architect of the infa
mous golden calf — the huggable Archie
(voiced by Richard Simmons).
Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score
gives us such inspiring songs as "Calf-
Maker Superstar," "Don't Cry for Me, Red
Sea," and "Phantom of the Schul." Whoopi
Goldberg and Eddie Murphy appear as the
lovable, yet sly, Jewish snake sidekicks that
inspire Shlomo's plan. Their song "Don't
be a SchlemieF is sure to create Oscar
buu.


Oh no! I forgot my pants!
