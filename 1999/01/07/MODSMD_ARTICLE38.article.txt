# Red, hot Gershwin
## Music Reviews 
### Stan Karas Editorial staff 
Rock 'n' roll has been proclaimed dead more times
than Bob Hope. True, every 10 years or so a spark
starts the rusted machine moving again — T-Rex,
the Sex Pistols, R.E.M., Nirvana — but there is a general
sense that there is really very little new to be said in rock,
a form which had a limited vocabulary to begin with.
And then there is that canon of songwriting which has
endured musical caprices and social upheavals — the
collection of what are usually called standards. Without
the posturing and sniping that accompanies the defini
tion of a canon in the warrens of contemporary English
departments, the canon of popular songwriting has
essentially defined itself. At the top there are the versatile
Harold Arlen, the sardonic and witty Cole Porter, the
Proust of pop, Johnny Mercer, and the tragic little Lorenz
Hart. Yet George Gershwin seems a bit too refined even
for this sublime company. Gershwin's music, accompa
nied by his brother Ira's lyrics, is both lyrical and defiant,
a perfect mix of classicism, vaudeville, black influences
and jazz, with a hint of Jewish flavor. Gershwin's songs
embody that tricky term, "a pop standard."
A number of albums have been released to commem
orate Gershwin's recent centennial birthday. Perhaps the
most ambitious of the bunch is "Red, Hot + Rhapsody,"
a nearly flawless compilation of contemporary musi
cians' takes on George and Ira. Morcheeba and Hubert
Laws get things going with a mellow and gently funky
version of "Summertime," while Finley Quaye gives "It
Ain't Necessarily So" a witty reggae kick. A true highlight
of the album is Natalie Merchant's plaintive and touching
"But Not for Me," which approaches in quality Chet
Baker's wistfully homoerotic version. Among the few
missteps on "Red, Hot + Rhapsody" is Clark Terry's
snarling "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" and Skylab's
curious but ultimately unsuccessful take on w'S
Wonderful." But these are minor quibbles. Contributions
by artists as diverse as Luscious Jackson, Bobby Womack
and Sincad O'Connor are consistently superb. David
Bowie's forlorn and ethereal rendition of "A Foggy Day
(in London Town)" is worth the price of the CD in itself.
"Red, Hot + Rhapsody" contemporises Gershwin's
music, making it sound more relevant, intimate and sin
cere than most music that is now vying for our fickle ears
and hearts.

On his new record, "Gershwin's World," Herbie
Hancock, a pianist who is known both as Miles Davis'
sideman and as a distinguished solo artist, is trying to
bring Gershwin back to his musical roots, to the jazz
clubs of Harlem. But Hancock also sets out to place
Gershwin in the context of the musical landscape of his
time by interspersing his tunes with compositions by his
contemporaries W.C. Handy and Maurice Ravel. One can
argue about the compatibility of such diverse composers,
but "Gershwin's World" also takes it up a notch by having
Joni Mitchell share the spotlight with Kathleen Battle,
and Wayne Shorter with Stevie Wonder.
Yet, the album's concept aside, "Gershwin's World" is a
masterful and often engaging record that manages to
capture Gershwin's charm on such tunes as "The Man I
Love," "Embraceable You" and the übiquitous
"Summertime." Hancock's band sounds tight and ele
gant, and the album is a worthy tribute to the man that
did so much to bring jazz into the forefront of American
consciousness.
Rhino Records' release "George and Ira Gershwin in
Hollywood" is an alternative to the re-interpretations of
the songs by contemporary performers. This double CD
is a terrific collection of Gershwin's movie tunes, as per
formed by some truly remarkable singers. Featuring
music from such classic musicals as "An American in
Paris," "Shall We Dance" and "Rhapsody in Blue" and
spanning several decades of movie music, this album is
for anyone who is familiar with Gershwin, but who is
curious to hear how those songs sounded when they were
brand spankin' new and were duking it out on the charts.
The highlights on "George and Ira Gershwin in
Hollywood" include A 1 Jolson's hearty version of
"Swanee," "A Foggy Day" by Fred Astaire, and a rousing
rendition of "Treat Me Rough" with June Allyson and
Mickey Rooney. The only drawback on this album is that
the sound quality on a number of tracks suffers from the
passage of time. Yet, this flaw only highlights the timeless
quality of the Gershwins' music. Not to sound like a
crotchety old fart, but the cartoonish new swingers can
take a few tips from Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.
True, the new Natalie Imbruglia CD looks enticing,
and who can resist the guileless charm of the New
Radicals, but some of the most engaging music that was
released last year was written more than half a century
ago by George Gershwin, a waggish tunesmith with a
taste for jazz, gospel and melancholy.
