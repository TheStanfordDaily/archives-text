'Decisions'
Wayman Tisdale, a former NBA player, has con
cluded one career and begun another. After a
successful 12-year stint as a professional bas
ketball player, Tisdale has begun to make a new name for
himself, this time as a musician. "Decisions" (Atlantic
Records) is Tisdale's debut contemporary jazz album.
Tisdale, or Wayman " The Wiz," enjoyed a distin
guished basketball career highlighted by many achieve
ments. In 1988, former First I.ady Nancy Reagan hon- /
ored him for his work with young people who were i
coping with drug and alcohol abuse. Tisdale, a gradu- V
ate of Oklahoma University, was the first player to have
his number retired in Oklahoma school history. He
played in 22 NBA playoff games and grabbed more than
5,000 rebounds in his career with the Sacramento Kings
and with the Suns. His musical career promises to be just
as impressive.
This six-foot-nine star is not only a great ball player,
but also one of the smoothest new artists out on the con

temporary jazz scene. His song "Power Forward" ran on
Billboard's top contemporary jazz chart for 25 weeks as a
No. 4 hit. His next song, "In the Zone," topped the for
mer's records by staying on Billboard's chart for an
impressive 30 weeks.

"Decisions" is Tisdale's first full-length album. On it,
he shows off his superb songwriting skills and talents as
he mixes and arranges different tempos, beats and
moods. He showcases his talents as a producer as he plays
with a wealth of new sounds and combines many differ

cut styles.
"Mexicoco" is a fast-paced song with international fla
vor and flavored with percussion. "Ain't no Lovin' " is a
sultry smooth slow piece of keyboard and bass-laden
jazz. Tisdale provides the background vocals on this song
and growls in his deep strong voice: "Ain't no lovin' like
the lovin' I get /1 want it more and more."
"Louis" is a gospel-influenced jazz track. Tisdale's
) album is dedicated to his father, the late Reverend
Louis Tisdale. One of the few songs on this album
accompanied by lyrics, "Louis" is more of a testimony
than a song. The piano and guitar frequently disappear
and give way to the sound of a man's voice, preaching,
"Some days we just down in the valley / Sometimes we
feel like we are nobody / Sometimes we feel like we got
everything."
With the success of "Decisions," Tisdale's evolution
from athlete to musician is complete.
