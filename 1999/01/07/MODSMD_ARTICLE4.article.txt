# Perfect price
## Senior starts Web site comparing book prices 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
At the start of every quarter, students on the Farm
complain about the high prices at the Bookstore. Thanks
to a new Web site, they now have a concrete way to see
how those prices really stack up.
Senior Thai Tran has launched a new site, Booksmart,
(http://booksmart.stanford.edu), which automatically
compares the prices for textbooks at the Stanford Book
store against major online bookstores such as
Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, and Borders. In addi
tion to the price comparison feature, the site offers a free
online marketplace for students to buy and sell used
books.
Tran, a computer science major, was motivated to
make the site after several bad experiences with the
Bookstore. "I think many would agree that shopping at
the Bookstore is not one of the
most fun experiences in the world,"
Tran said. Last quarter, the Book
store's inventory problems forced
him to wait four weeks for a com
puter science book.
He was also inspired by Stop
Monopolies on Campus, a student
group started during the 1996-97
academic year. SMOC protested
what it perceived as the Book
store's monopoly on book sales by
holding a used-book fair on the
store's steps.
"With the book fair, both the
buyer and seller won, but keeping
up the service was very time-con
suming," Tran said. With Books

mart, however, everything is com
pletely automated. "Whether you
want new or used books, it is now
all in one place."
Once the user has entered his or
her books, Booksmart factors in
sales tax, the Bookstore's rebate
and the online stores' shipping
charges to give the total cost of
buying all the selected books from
each individual bookseller.
"This is a great idea," said Ryan
Laponis, a freshman who tried the
Web site. "But since people do not
always buy everything from one
store, it would be more useful if
you could mix between the compa
nies to find the cheapest total."
Online booksellers such as
Amazon.com think that sites such
as Tran's will show users the value
and ease of buying books on line.

"We think the convenience, prices
and selection ... are why people
are turning in increasing numbers
to the Internet and us," said Bill
Curry, director of public relations
for leading online bookseller Ama
zon.com.
Booksmart is an extension of
Tran's senior project, Bidsmart, a
Web site that compares prices for a
given item among multiple online
auctions.
In the future, Tran sees the po
tential for expansion into a prof
itable business, possibly as a "por
tal site" for college students com
plete with course guide and reviews
of textbooks.
But for now it is all for free. "1
get nothing besides the personal
satisfaction that people are using
something I created."
