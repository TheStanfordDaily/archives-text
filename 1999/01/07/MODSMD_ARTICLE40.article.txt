### Roxy Sass 
I |J | appy New Year, sweetie. Miss Sass wouJd
I like to congratulate you for making it
I il I through the past three weeks of exces
sive commercialization and insufferable family
gatherings. These past few weeks have been the
season of joy, happiness and love, right? like that
party where your aunt brought the same boring
cookies as last year, your grandmotherlectured on I
how much they had to save money 50 year* ago
and your other aunt complained about the youths'
lack, of morality. Meanwhile, you just wished there
was just one person who was worth more than a
five-minute conversation, not to rnjßtion a possi
ble flirting opportunity.
All over the television and rnjnMtfare themes of
Christmas love and holiday romance. So where is
yours, you ask? The question becomes more press
ing when you notice your old high school friend
has taken the idea of winter break romance to the
extreme, and is more than willing to repeatedly
show off his or her new-found lover.
Since you did not envision playing chaperone
to your friend for the three weeks of break, this is
where the story can take one of two turns: You
could mope around the rest of that joyous holiday,
or you could make something of It. As an avid
reader of Free Sexx, you mosl'certamly attempted
the latter option.
Now Miss Sass is fully aware that "getting some"
is extremely complicated, sometimes difficult, and
chaotically unpredictable. I specteDy during holi
days. Side note: Ladies, your Weight k not a fac
tor (how you carry and present yourself maybe);
"men," bragging about your sexual prowe#s does
not help either (inverse equation here between
boasts and reality). So what is the point of all this?
The holiday is over, and we're back to the overly
popular indulgences of the sevfiflcd dating scene
of Stanford in winter. Or something like thai.
Miss Sass would like to address'a philosophical
problem that tends to pop up (no, not that one)
during vacations. The one where the conscien
tious would-be lover (you) asks, is thus the right
thing to do? You want to hook up with this amaz
ingly sexy, flirtatious person (hey, it could happen;
there is always New Year's Eve), but you say to
yourself, "Wait a minute. I don't wan! to hurt this
person '1 am engaged to /1 love very much /1 have
been dating /1 would like to date / I have a prayer
in hell of dating back at school." ?
Miss Sass is aware that the majority of religions
and high school health class will be against her on
this one. Hut Miss Sass always skipped health class
t0.... well, you know. Let's start with this state
ment: There is not just one true love for you, and
a roller-coaster ride to Hell docs not necessarily
await those with multiple lovers (of either sex or
even none-of-the-above). Miss Sass recommends
equal-opportunity dating, and tries not to favor
either sex, although the male species can be so
exasperating.
There arc those of you out there who are per
fectly capable of a long-distance, completely
devoted relationship, lb those people who are sat
isfied with long telephone conversations and let
ters, more power to you. Miss Sass applauds you,
but doesn't necessary understand you. I
Others have more' roving, Unsatisfied libidos. *
But that does not mean they all warrant your con

tempt. It is dependent on how one handles their
relationships - virtues like honest/, maturity, and
understanding are all key components, no matter
what form the relationship takes. Having more
than one lever is not .he sin; treating your part
ner's) without respect i».
Lcrttf is not a bragging contest; It is neither a
a race, and "getting some" all the time
doesn't majke you the winner. You shouldn't he
dating multiple people i>ecause it looks cooi to
yoSur friends or because you're trying to break
your old record.
Dating more than one person requires honesty.
Both of your partner should at least partially
aware that you are dating others. If they aren't,
then it is just cheating. They don't have to know
every detail - most people don't want to hear
about who else is satjLsfytog their lover. And you
don't have to tell them everything at once? it
makes for horrible first date conversation materi
al. But tell them the truth do not try to mislead
them, for that is where people get hurt.
The easiest form of multiple dating is when you
are dating people in different geographical loca
tions, such as at home and at school. Then, when
you are in a particular place, that person can feel
that he / she has you all tor their own. Conflict
tends to be limited in this arrangement also, as
there are not as many shored time problems and
there is little chance of your lovers meeting each
other. Which can be good or bad, depending on
circumstances. (Bad if they kill each other, good if
they get along, worse if they get along so well they
ditch you to run off together).
This world has far too much hate and for too
little love. To hate people for loving is wrong and
counterproductive. Just your partner
chooses to see someone clse ; does not mean he /
she does not love you. We huraans do nrSt have I
set amount of love to give. DoljU spend so much
time worrying about your partner's other rela
tionships. He loves his mother, shelves her sister,
and you don't worry about those. \o okay, Miss
Sass realizes these are slightly different, but per
haps that time worrying and lighting would be
better spent improving your relationship, right
here and now in the present. Stop by just to say
how much you care, go to dinner, take a bubble
bath together, walk her to class, or just have lunch,
eve# if it is at the Co Ho.
