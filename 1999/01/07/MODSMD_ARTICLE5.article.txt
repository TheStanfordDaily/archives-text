# All unassigned students receive walk-in housing

All 67 unassigned students who
requested housing this quarter
have now been assigned through
the walk-in process run by Housing
Assignment Services.
Assignments will continue to be
made every day through Feb. 5 for
students who are eligible for hous
ing but have not yet been assigned.
There are still many spaces avail
able for both undergraduate stu
dents and single graduate students.
"We are not as tight this year as
we were this time last year," said
Kathleen Bransfield, housing as
signment services manager. "Al
though it is always a bit of an anx
ious time for students who have to
go through walk-ins. I do not antic
ipate problems meeting the guar
antee."
"The housing office was very
helpful." said coterminal student
Kerry Shaw, who was assigned to
Castano. "Although Castano was
not my first choice, I have a great
room and a nice view."
All undergraduates are guaran
teed four years of housing. In order
to be eligible, a student needs to
apply for housing by the specified
deadline, be willing to live any
where on campus and potentially
wait until the Friday of the first
week of classes for an assignment.

Ideally, Housing Assignment
Services wouldn't have students
wait until the end of the first week
of classes for an assignment, but are
forced to because some spaces do
not become available until students
either don't show up to claim their
assignment or stop out unexpect
edly.

'We are not as tight this
year as we were this time
last year.'

Each quarter Housing Assign
ment Services makes assignments
to the spaces they know will be va
cant the following quarter. Last
quarter the deadline for students to
inform them that they would be
leaving was Oct. 31.
This date was also the deadline
for returning students to file a wait
ing-list application to be consid
ered for housing.
Spaces offered to walk-ins came
from students who failed to notify
Housing Assignment Services that
they were leaving and students who
didn't accept a waiting-list assign
ment.
Walk-ins include students who
did not receive an assignment dur
ing the waiting-list round and those

who need housing who have never
applied for housing before.
The latter students are not guar
anteed housing, but will be as
signed if space is available.
Sixty-one students were guaran
teed an assignment, but not all of
them showed up at the walk-in
meeting.
Additional students did show up
and received housing assignments.
"We had a wide variety of
spaces available at the walk-in
meeting," Bransfield said. "This in
eluded all of the major residences
and numerous houses (in the
Row."
Students do have a choice in
where they are assigned.
On the waiting list, they can
specify up to eight choices as well
as indicate whether they want to be
assigned to a space other than
those on their list if none of their
specific choices arc available.
At the walk-in meeting students
are called according to their draw
number order and can then choose
from the available residences.
Students can choose from the
spaces available at the time their
name is called, or wait until later if
there is nothing available in one of
the residences they would like to
live in.
Students who do not accept an
assignment, however, are not guar
anteed housing.
