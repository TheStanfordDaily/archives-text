# Psych 1 fills in record time

### Alice Brown 
The arduous process to gain en
trance to the popular Psychology I:
"Introduction to Psychology" class
continues to grow more difficult
and confusing.
Setting a new record, the text
hooks for Prof. Philip Zimbardo's
psychology class sold out two hours
after they went on sale on Monday
afternoon. Books, distributed in
the Psychology Department by the

Stanford University Psychology
Association, were supposed to go
on sale at 2 p.m., yet lines began to
form as early as 8:30 a.m.
Zimbardo explained that he or
ganized the book distribution so as
to "save the students money and to
make it more convenient for them
to buy the book." He added that if
the books are sold through the
Bookstore, they are more expen
sive.
However, the sale was not con

venient to those who arrived at 2
p.m. only to find that not only had
the books gone on sale around
1:30, but that the lines were too
long to allow them to obtain a
book.
There were actually two lines,
one on the first floor and one in the
basement. "People upstairs had
been there for hours. The line was
snaking around the building, with

lots of people trying to cut it," said
freshman Julian Wassenaar, the
first person waiting in the line
downstairs. Although the second
line didn't form until 12:30, its
length also prevented students
from buying books if they weren't
there before 2 p.m.
"There were people in line that
were holding spaces for big groups
of people," said freshman Suzanna
Dryden. Each person could only
purchase a total of two books.
In addition, there were those
students who were unable to be on
campus due to the weekend's bad
weather.
Zimbardo apologized in class
for the fast sell-out of the books,
yet added that there was nothing he
could do.
There is a 300-person limit to
the class's enrollment due to the
size of the lecture hall.
Even with the limit, seven stu
dents would have to sit in the aisles

if all 3(H) students were to attend
lecture.
"I don't want to teach more than
300 students. The bigger auditori
ums are not set up for teaching the
way I like to teach," Zimbardo ex
plained. "The room I am in now fits
my teaching style."
In the past, Zimbardo put up a
sign-up sheet for the class, which
led to students sleeping out on Sun
day night in order to guarantee a
spot. Books were then sold
throughout the week.
In the end, this proved to be
meaningless, as a place in a class is
only confirmed by registering
through Axess, and therefore he
eliminated the sign-up sheet.
Technically, "if a student regis
tered for the class on Axess and ob
tained the book from another
source, then they are in the class,"
Zimbardo said.
Owning a book does not give a
student an official place in the
class, because he or she must still
register on Axess.
But any student can sign up for
the class directly through Axess, as

there is no way for a 300-person
limit to be enforced by Axess, Zim
bardo said.
In other words, if students can
find another way to buy the book
and register on Axess, they could
join the class without Zimbardo's
consent.
Zimbardo asked students with
books who were not planning on
remaining in the course to please
meet with students who needed
books after class.
He said that in previous years
the department has had a surplus of
books, and that the demand for the
class has never been this high.
Ultimately, he finds this de
mand flattering.
"Dedicated teaching pays off in
student interest and involvement."
However, he finds it disturbing
that there is so much confusion in
how a student gets into a class.
"The problem [of students not get
ting into the class] is not the course;
the problem is in the registrar's of
fice ....
The system is outdated and con
fusing."
