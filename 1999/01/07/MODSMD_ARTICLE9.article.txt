## NBA lockout ends 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The
NBA lockout finally came to an end
Wednesday on its 191st day, a nasty
and divisive struggle that cost the
owners and players hundreds of
millions of dollars and scarred a
league at the pinnacle of its popu
larity.
"Everybody lost. We lost three
months of the season and we did a
disservice to the game, so there are
no winners and losers," Charles
Barkley said. "There's going to he a
lot of damage."
The season will begin the first
week of February, with teams play
ing about 50 games each, some 30
fewer than a regular season.
The agreement was reached just
hours before the NBA Board of
Governors was to vote on canceling
the remainder of the season. It
came just before dawn, following an

all-night bargaining session at NBA
headquarters between commission
er David Stern and union director
Billy Hunter.
Each side made significant com
promises to close the deal, but the
owners clearly walked away with a
much better agreement than the old
one. The players, for their part,
came away with their dignity intact
and with more money for the non
superstars.
"1 will say that I am elated that
we will be playing basketball this
season," Stern said.
Hours later, the deal was ratified
by players in a vote after
being approved by both negotiating
committees. It gives owners the
unprecedented concession of a
maximum limit on individual
salaries and will be in place for six
years, with owners having an option

for a seventh year.
The Board of Governors will
vote on the agreement today.
