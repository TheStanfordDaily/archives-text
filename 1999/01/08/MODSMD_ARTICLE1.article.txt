# New office to run program
## Sophomore College expanded 25 percent 
### Jad Fakhry 
Due to increased popularity,
Sophomore College has been ex
panded to accommodate KM) more
students next year. A new office
under Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Ramon Saldivar has
been created to handle this expan
sion and to deal with other under
graduate programs.
These actions come as a result of a
1994 report issued by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education.
The report recommended that staff
be allocated to a new office indepen
dent of the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
"It allows for one central office to
coordinate the efforts of the three un
dergraduate schools to provide the
best possible lower-division and
upper level curricula that Stanford
can offer to all of its undergradu
ates," said Saldivar.
In addition to organizing and run
ning Sophomore College, the new of
fice will review offerings from acade
mic departments such as Introduc
tion to the Humanities to ensure that
thev meet the necessary academic re

quirements proposed by the Faculty
Senate.
The office will govern and support
the Undergraduate Advising Center,
Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities. Writing in the Majors. Honors
College, Summer Science Fellow
ships and Sophomore College.
Sophomore College is a program
offered to sophomores two weeks
before fall quarter instruction begins.
The program consists of two weeks of
morning seminars that are intended
to foster close, meaningful interac
tion between students and profes
sors. The afternoons are comprised
of workshops informing students
about undergraduate research op
portunities that are available to them
during the school year.
The expansion of Sophomore
College will give every sophomore
the opportunity to enroll or at least
participate in a limited number of
seminars, said Ellen Woods, associ
ate vice provost for undergraduate
education. This September, the num
ber of seminars will be increased
from 27 to 35 and enrollment will in
crease from 320 students to 420 stu
dents.
Todd Benson, director of Fresh
man and Sophomore Programs, re
ported that more than 700 students
applied for one of 324 available
Sophomore College slots last year.
Funding for the expansion
"comes from special gift donors, not
from the tuition pool," Benson said.
"Funding will increase at a rate pro
portional to how much the program
grows."
He further noted that "a number
of faculty who have participated have
ranked the program as among their
best teaching experiences."
Many students also have taken a
liking to this program — which earns
them one or two units — and have
pointed out that it offers a rare
chance to interact closely with pro
fessors and realize the vast opportu
nities open to them at Stanford.
"Sophomore College is the best
experience I have had at Stanford so
far," said sophomore Kim Winges, a
participant in Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare's class, "Origin of
Life." "It was a unique opportunity
to learn from professors who are
more than just lecturers."
Kerry Miller, another participant,
explained "the small class size and

unique group dynamics along with a
really good professor was really ef
fective and allowed us to go much
more in depth than normal classes."
Although she voiced concern over
the fact that students were split be
tween Stern and Toyon, she said
overall that Sophomore College is
"really cool" and that its being free is
attractive to students.
Last year, many students were un
able to attend because of the huge de
mand and limited spots.
This is where Saldivar felt the pro
gram could further bolster Stanford's
commitment to excellent undergrad
uate education.
"Symbolically, it represents the
institutional acceptance of the cen
trality of undergraduate education to
the total research and learning mis
sion of the University in a synthesis of
knowledge creation and knowledge
dissemination."
Ellen Woods, assistant vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion, explained that Sophomore Col
lege enables students to get the most
out of their Stanford education.
"The students in Sophomore Col
lege really get jazzed to take advan
tage of the rest of the year," she said.
These improvements come as
University President Gerhard
Casper has said he has made under
graduate education a top priority.
Benson forecasted future increas
es in Sophomore College enrollment.
