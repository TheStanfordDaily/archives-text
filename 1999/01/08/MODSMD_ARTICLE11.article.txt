# Impeachment trial begins
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With C hief
Justice William H. Rehnquist presiding,
the Senate somberly placed William Jef
ferson Clinton on trial yesterday on
charges of high crimes and misdemeanors
in the first presidential impeachment in
131 years. The White House promised a
"compelling case" for acquittal.
The nation's 42nd president — and
only the second to face a trial — was at
the White House when all KM) senators
stood at their desks in the Capitol, raised
their hands and swore to render "impar
tial justice" in his case.
The momentous events unfolded as
Senate leaders struggled for an elusive
accord on guidelines for the trial, setting
an extraordinary closed-door meeting of
all senators for Friday.
"1 think there is some common
ground," said the Democratic leader. Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, although
he and Majority Leader Trent Lott added
there had been no bipartisan accord on
the thorny question of whether to permit
testimony by witnesses.
Clinton stands accused of perjury and
obstruction of justice, allegations that
stem from his long campaign to cover up
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewin
sky. The charges were brought in the
name of the House of Representatives
and "of the people of the I Jnited States of
America," intoned Rep. 1 lenry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican who led fellow GOP
lawmakers into the chamber to formally
present the two articles of impeachment.
The nation tuned in on television, lines
of visitors formed at the Capitol, and a
lucky few dozen people got seats in the
galleries overhanging the Senate chamber
for the open in u of the trial. "1 came here

to show my support for the Constitution
and. 1 guess, the pageantry of it all," said
Todd Marks, a law student from Cincin
nati.
"We have an awesome responsibility,"
said Sen. Don Nickles, the Senate GOP
whip.
And one without clear guidelines — or
any understanding of how long the trial
would take, or whether witnesses would
testify — as lawmakers continued to
struggle for agreement on a blueprint.
After several hours of behind-the
scenes discussions, Lott and Daschle
made a rare joint appearance before
reporters to declare their willingness to
make one more attempt at a bipartisan
agreement on procedures.
"We think that the best way to keep
calm and cool and dignified is to look at
each other and talk to each other," said
Lott. The two sides were expected to
exchange proposals for witnesses and
other issues in advance of the scheduled
Friday meeting.
Hyde and other Republicans have pre
pared a list of potential witnesses, includ
ing Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Ver
non Jordan and White House secretary
Betty Currie, central figures in the sex
and-cover-up case put together by Inde
pendent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
In addition. Republican sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said
GOP lawmakers may want to have sever
al current and former White House offi
cials subpoenaed, including John Podesta,
the chief of staff; Harold Ickes, a former
aide, and adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
Republicans crafted a plan that would
give first the House and then the White
House five days each to present evidence.

after which senators could submit ques
tions to lawyers through Rehnquist. The
Senate would then decide whether to call
witnesses.
Democrats generally opposed witness
es at the trial, and Daschle told reporters
he favored a vote on the articles after pre
sentation of evidence without live testi
mony.
Negotiations ebbed and flowed during
the day, and one plan for an all-Senate
closed-door meeting was scrapped, as was
Lott's plan to submit the issue to the full
Senate for a pair of votes. Some Republi
cans expressed concern about the political
impact of a highly partisan vote occurring
on such a historic day, and that plan, too,
fell by the wayside.
It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a
president and remove him, and Clinton
has solid Democratic support in the Sen
ate. Republicans outnumber Democrats
55-45.
At the White House, spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters, "We are con
vinced we can make a compelling case
that will lead the United States Senate not
to remove the president."
No person now living had ever wit
nessed events like those that unfolded
during the day in the Senate chamber
according to a script written by the
Founding Fathers two centuries ago and
adapted now for the television age.
"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye,"
announced James W. Ziglar, the Senate
sergeant at arms, a few moments after 10
a.m. "All persons are commanded to
keep silent, on pain of imprisonment," he
said, reading a proclamation used in a
presidential trial only once before, in
Andrew Johnson's case in 1868.
