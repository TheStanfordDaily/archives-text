# Study says birth control pill has no long-term ill effects

LONDON (AP) Women suffer no lasting ill
effects from taking birth control pills, according to
the biggest study ever on the subject and one that
some experts say finally can lay to rest fears that have
lingered since the pill was introduced in 1%1.
Ten years after they stopped using the pill, women's
chances of dying from cancer, stroke and other side
effects were the same as those of women who had
never taken it, according to the study published in the
latest issue of the British Medical Journal.
Scientists have known for a long time that women
are at a slightly increased risk of cervical cancer,
breast cancer, stroke and other diseases of the circu
latory system while taking the pill. Hut the long-term
effects have been uncertain.
"It must be reassuring," said Dr. Clifford Kay,
founding director of the Royal College of General
Practitioners' Manchester Research Unit, who start
ed the study in 1968. "There probably has always
been a lurking fear that something dreadful might
pop up after 15, 20 or even 25 years, and this study
shows clearly that it doesn't."
More than 300 million women worldwide have
used the pill, and an estimated 1(H) million currently
are taking it.
The study involved 46.0(M) British women tracked
for 25 years, the longest follow-up of any similar
study.
Significantly, most of the women were taking
medium- or high-dose estrogen pills, which were
common in the 1960s and 19705. Most women today
use a new generation of low-dose pills, believed to be
safer.
Dr. Bruce Stadel, medical officer of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, agreed that the latest study

gives a strong, resounding note that there is no
long-term impact, even for the highest-dose pills.
"I think the issue is answered" by the study, he
said.
"This really relates to women in their 40s and 50s,
when you get to an age where cancer starts becoming
common." said the study's leader, Valerie Beral,
director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's can
cer epidemiology unit in Oxford University. "It's nat
ural for them to think back and wonder whether it
was something to do with taking the pill."
"We can reassure women that if they stopped the
pill 10 or more years ago, if they get some illness it's
not because they took the pill when they were
young," she said.
But the findings also mean good news for younger
women who, unlike their mothers, can be assured
while taking the pill that any ill effects will wear off.
"For lower-dose pills, it can only be better." Beral
said. "But it's hard to be better than nothing."
The findings also revealed it was just as safe to
take the pill for more than 10 years as it was to take it
for two years — the average length women take it.
The women involved in the study were, on aver
age. 25 years old when it started, and half of them ini
tially were taking the pill. By the end of the study, the
average age was 50 and two-thirds of them had taken
the pill, for an average of five years.
Nearly all of them stopped taking it at the average
age of 33 — 17 years before the end of the study.
Although the study poses mostly good news, the
researchers noted that the findings also hinted that,
just as the risk of danger disappears after 10 years, so
does the beneficial effect the pill is known to have in
decreasing the chance of ovarian cancer.
