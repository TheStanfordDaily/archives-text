WASHINGTON (AP) -
Miliary Rodham Clinton's sup
porters are quietly circulating her
name as a possible candidate to run
for the Senate from New York, and
the first lady has not ruled out the
idea.
Though close aides and confi
dants say she is not actively consid
ering the Senate bid, there are
growing signs of a whisper cam
paign to encourage speculation as
Mrs. Clinton enjoys some of her
highest approval ratings ever.
"She's aware that people are
speculating about what she might
do in 2000. but at this point she has
no plans to run for elective office,"
said spokeswoman Marsha Berry.

"For the next two years, she wants
to make the most out of being first
lady."
Several confidants of Mrs. Clin
ton, all of whom spoke on condi
tion of anonymity, said there is
something to the speculation.
One close friend said this week
that she has talked to the first lady
about possibly running for the Sen
ate seat. The conversations were
casual and not substantial, but Mrs.
Clinton knows friends are circulat
ing her name, the source said.
Friends say Mrs. Clinton has
several political options opened to
her, including seeking Senate seats
in Illinois or California and even a
presidential race somewhere down

the line.
Mrs. Clinton is not the only
potential New York Senate candi
date with White House ties.
Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, the son of former New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, is
expected to announce by early
next week whether or not he will
run. If Cuomo sought the seat,
Mrs. Clinton would be unlikely to
challenge him, say allies of both. If
he bows out, speculation about a
first lady candidacy would sky
rocket.
Donna Shalala, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human
Services, is no longer giving the
race a serious look.
