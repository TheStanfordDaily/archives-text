# Transit frozen in Chicago
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) —Five days
after a blizzard dropped more than
20 inches of snow, the city was still
struggling Thursday to recover.
School buses were not running,
thousands remained out of school,
many streets were barely passable
and the train line that serves O'Hare
International Airport was shut
down.
For cold and snow-weary resi
dents, the main issue remained
transportation. Officials of the belea
guered Chicago Transit Authority
insisted they were doing the best

they could in a crisis worsened by
years of insufficient funding.
For some angry residents, howev
er, it was not good enough.
"It's unbearably slow, slower
than usual," said Joel Johnson, wait
ing at a train stop on Chicago's
North Side Thursday morning in
temperatures near zero.
Bundled so tightly in a parka,
h(K>d and scarf that only his eyes
were showing, Waheed Rehan said
the worst delays occur at night.
The CTA entered the weekend
snowstorm with hundreds of aging

cars, many of them with unprotected
boxes on the bottom, where snow
was able to get into sensitive electri
cal systems and short out the circuit
ry-
By Thursday afternoon, the sys
tem was still 30 trains short, and the
line that serves O'Hare was shut
down because damaged rail cars
were still inoperable. The CTA was
running buses along the line instead.
Mayor Richard M. Daley said the
CTA's problems point to the need
for more federal and state funding of
mass transit.
