						year in review

While a storm of controversy
raged outside campus gates,
1998 on the Farm proved to
be relatively smooth sailing

IN THEIR reminiscences about the year
1998. pundits are fond of contrasting
the pandemonium in Washington with
the cautious confidence of average Ameri
cans.
The Stanford campus, like most of the
country, certainly seemed lo side with tran
quillity over chaos.
Stock markets fell and soared, politicians
ehided and apologized, terrorists struck
U.S. embassies and John Glenn ventured
once more into space. Though mindful of
this eventful year, the University steered
relatively free of controversy.
Not too long ago, student dissatisfaction
with tenure decisions sparked seemingly
endless disputes. As we opined on these
pages, the institutional arrangements which
give students little voice in the tenure pro
cess still have not changed, and concerns
over representation of minorities and
women remain pertinent.
The office of the ASSIJ president, mean
while, has focused on concrete and practical
improvements, not publicity. Indeed, the
expansion of the Marguerite shuttle service
alone eclipsed the work of a dozen hollow
campaigns in years past. As the result, stu
dent leaders gave up some of their visibility
for a dose of well deserved respect. A smart
trade, we think.
Certainly, high-profile athletic successes
managed to capture most of campus' atten
tion in 1998. A trip to the Final Four was
thrilling, and it sparked a week of logistical
nightmares in the race for Sixth Man Club
shirts. Still, even the disgruntled seniors
who did not capture prized basketball tick
ets could delight in the fact that their peers
from UC-Berkelev have never even seen

the Axe as undergraduates. How about
four more years. Cardinal?
The one point of contention that galva
nized students was characteristically practi
cal — housing. As the local real estate mar
ket grew tighter, graduate students led an
effective and well organized campaign for
more campus residences. Their plight, artic
ulated in a comprehensive report and
expressed through a protest in the Main
Quad, drew University-wide attention. Last
auart<#\ students took, home when the Uni
versity announced it would construct new
housing for hundreds of graduate students.
Undergraduates, too, challenged the
administration's handling of campus resi
dences.
One of the Cowell Cluster structures
converted into a sorority house — Alpha
Sig — was home to a strong community and
respected traditions. When vocal Alpha Sig
stalwarts demonstrated their opposition in
the ASSIJ Senate and in While Plaza, the
Office of Residential Education hopefully
learned the folly of changing housing
options without student input.
The housing disputes, though, did not
significantly alter the tranquil spirit of 1998.
Will the new year be different?
Perhaps. Certainly, some of the major
administrative players are leaving us and
moving on to new projects, including
Provost Condoleezza Rice. As we noted on
Tuesday, a leader of such caliber will not be
easy to replace.
Moreover, the calm of 1998 could hide a
brewing storm. New denials of tenure to
popular instructors could easily renew con
tention between students and administra
tors. The housing woes, too, are far from
fully resolved. And it is always a safe bet
that Res Ed will spark a new controversy
before too long.
Meanwhile, we can look to national pol
itics for the disputes. And, as we did last
year, we can escape from the Washington
brouhaha to the calm of our own lives.
