WHILE MOST STANFORD
students did their part for the
war from the safety of the
home front, hundreds of Stanford stu
dents and alumni joined the army, navy
and marines this week in IIM2,l l M2, according
to The Stanford Daily.
"Remembering the days when they
studied instead of fought for the 'winds
of freedom." " reported The Daily,
"hundreds of former students have
changed the cardinal for the khaki or
navy blue."
While Stanford representatives could
be found in every branch and level of the
armed forces, "from duty on submarines
to signal corps service," the air corps was
the service of choice.
Particularly successful Stanford grad
uates were names in news dispatches:
"John Kerman. former Card grider.
recently received his second lieutenant's

commission in the Marine Corps from
Secretary of the Navy Knox."
Lists of enrolled students who had
been drafted were also publicized and
ordered by fraternity house: Alpha
Delta Phi sent nine men. Delta Kappa
Epsilon sent six. Kappa Sigma eight and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon 16.
With World War II raging, the ASSU
turned its regular meeting into a debate
over patriotism.
ASSU President George Jackson
pleaded for "good taste" and said luxu
ries like big-name bands at the senior
prom constituted an unwarranted
expense.
"If we've got $ 1.5(H) lying around the
campus, we should put it into defense
bonds or stamps, not give it to a band,"
said Jackson.
Dissenters responded, "[W]e
shouldn't curtail social activities imme

diately but if the United States is
bombed, then we could modify social life
at once." After all, they said, "|W|ho's
going to stay here if you take all our
privileges away?"
That argument proved compelling,
and the ASSU voted to allow the
Tommy Dorsey Band to play as planned
for the senior prom — despite the cost.
The ASSU also approved rules that
required women to sign out if leaving
campus after 6:30 p.m.
In other news, students were asked to
do without mugs or glasses at meals.
Cokes and milk were served straight
from the bottle. The headline read, "Be
patriotic, use a straw."
At least one luxury remained for
those at home during war time — men's
and women's shampoos at the local
beauty salon on University Ave. started
at 70 cents.
