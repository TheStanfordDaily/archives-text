## It is better to have loved and lost 
### 
YOU DON'T know
what you've got
until it's gone. I'll
repeat that for emphasis:
you really, really don't
know what you've got
until it's gone. I'm sorry to
say that I learned that les-

son the hard way.
At the end of spring quarter my sopho
more year, I received a delicately worded
letter from the Office of Academic Stand
ing which informed me (in the kindest man
ner possible) that I had been suspended
from Stanford. Let me tell you, my two
year-old acceptance package from the then
Dean of Admissions James Montoya never
looked so good as it did when I realized it
was null and void.
To be honest, my situation was not as
dramatic as it sounds. My registration was
put on hold because I violated academic
probation by taking two incompletes in my
classes. I was placed on probation in the
first place because I took incompletes in all
of my winter classes. I felt I was justified in
doing so, to be sure, because I was sick for
most of that year. That knowledge was not
very comforting, however, as it was not a
valid excuse for the good people in the Reg
istrar's Office. For all they knew. I had set
fire to my dorm and made death threats to
Gerhard Casper. 1 could not come back to
school — and this scared me out of my wits.
I consoled myself with laughter at the
beginning; I told my friends that 1 had
earned the "school of hard knocks" creden

tials that every writer needs, and that I
could mention being kicked out of Stanford
on the dust jacket of my first book. That
story didn't sound so good when I began to
envision going home and explaining to my
little sister why I wasn't good enough for
college anymore. It sounded even worse
when 1 got the letter from Overseas Studies
which explained that I had violated my
acceptance contract and couldn't attend
Stanford in Oxford as I had planned. I
stopped laughing and started screaming.
Feeling sorry for myself was, of course,
of little use in improving my situation. Since
Academic Standing had explained that stu
dents become liable for suspension by vio
lating probation, it seemed reasonable that
I could reinstate myself by completing the
classes I had ignored spring quarter and
earning the units I needs to come back.
Frantic calls to every Stanford employee
I could locate confirmed that hope, and my
professors were surprisingly willing to
receive research papers and reading
responses from me as I completed them
during the summer. I demanded far more
understanding than 1 deserved from just
about everyone involved in that hateful pro
cess, and it still amazes me that the faculty
went to so much trouble for someone who
may have been the laziest student alive.
I might claim that my diplomatic
prowess made those pleading e-mails
believable, but it is fairest to say that the
compassion of my professors and adminis
trators saved my sorry butt.
I would never have chosen to spend my

summer completing three months' worth of
classwork in the space of a few frenzied
weeks, but I think in retrospect that "los
ing" Stanford, if you will, is one of the best
things that could have happened to me. The
fabled "sophomore slump" hit me pretty
hard in the quarters I stopped attending
class.
Though 1 had spent most of high school
dreaming about coming to Palo Alto, I for
got in the time I was sick that succeeding at
Stanford was one of my most cherished per
sonal goals. Though I wouldn't recommend
my experience to anyone —my once
prized college transcript is now a magnifi
cent mess, and I still have mounds of paper
work to complete before my student status
is completely normal again — the prospect
of being barred from this place gave me a
swift kick in the pants that I sorely needed.
1 do love being a student. The loss of
that status forced me to remember that,
and to reexamine my value system. My
most recent pack of letters, confirmations
that I'm once again eligible for enrollment
and the dubious honor of paying this year's
tuition, are as valuable to me as the "Wel
come to the Farm" packet from Dean
Montoya that I filed away with my high
school yearbooks. Stanford and the
demands it places upon me are very wel
come sources of stress. It's good to be
back.

hopes that with this knowledge her mother
is sleeping better.
