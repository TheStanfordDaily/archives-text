"U.S. jets are firing missiles on Iraq."
The recent storm of national crises has
left us a disenchanting, depressing and
slightly scary political landscape. By order
ing an air strike on Iraq just days before the
House's vote on impeachment. President
Clinton was entangled in two sticky issues.
The collision of these crises has given us a
glimpse of the damage already done to the
president's credibility and the public's trust.
The missile attacks immediately gave rise
to speculations that Clinton was trying to
shift national attention from his scandal and
bolster public support. He dismissed these
accusations as ones that no "serious" person
could make. But suspicion persisted. He is,
after all. on trial for lying under oath.
It is a frightening thing to question the
president's motives regarding the use of
force. When Clinton invoked his power as
commander in chief of our armed forces and
launched a strike on Iraq, many could not
help but question his motives. Congressmen,

the United Nations and the press all quickly
voiced concerns over a possible hidden
agenda.
Clinton maintained the strike was war
ranted by the report submitted by head
United Nations Special Commission inspec
tor Richard Butler. He had unanimous sup
port from his military advisors, he said, and
acted only after several ultimatums had
been disregarded.
If Clinton was politically motivated to
launch the air attack, the plan backfired
badly. What is more likely is that his motives
were honest. Regardless, the strike cast light
on two problems our country still faces. The
first is that people doubted our president's
truthfulness; the second is that it seems we
did little to improve, and may actually have
worsened our position with Iraq.
The president's greatest and least
checked power is military. Likewise, military
matters demand the greatest degree of pub
lic trust. America's sons and daughters can
be sent to their death at the president's dis
cretion.
If our citizens are to fight, it is vitally
important that they know the truth behind

their sacrifice. The misinformation dissemi
nated during Vietnam was tragic and infuri
ating as it displayed a lack of respect for the
public's knowledge and opinion. The theory
that Roosevelt knew about Pearl Harbor in
advance is loathsome because it also implies
a disregard for American lives to further a
hidden agenda.
Our problems in the Gulf are small in
comparison to those we faced in Vietnam
and World War 11. but the fundamental
issue is the same. Trust in the government
has become fragile in our country. If we
become used to half-truths, evasions and
lies in our executive branch, we shall hesi
tate noticeably when called to important
action.
Did Clinton have a hidden agenda in
mind when he launched a strike on Iraq?
He insisted he did not. Republican Sen.
Trent Lott claimed he did. and the United
Nations was divided. The United Nations
wondered why Clinton did not present his
case before acting; many delegates felt the
UNSCOM report failed to justify the
attack.
As matters now stand, the United

Nations is not allowed to send inspectors to
Iraq, Saddam Hussein is consolidating Mus
lim sympathy against western aggression
and we find ourselves in almost daily air
borne skirmishes. Further U.S. plans per
taining to Iraq are vague.
Clinton can alleviate the skepticism
regarding Iraq and reclaim the public's trust
through sincere honesty in the Senate
impeachment hearings and a sound policy in
the Gulf. With honesty he can reclaim our
trust so that united we may face our prob
lems abroad.
But honesty and forthrightness seem
almost alien expectations. Repeated screen
ing's of "I did not have sexual relations with
that woman. Miss Lewinsky," have rendered
the public wary. Clinton's admission that he
had "misled" people did little to restore our
faith. Likewise, that Clinton eventually set
tled the lawsuit brought by Paula Jones was
utterly disenchanting. It was a quiet admis
sion after a painfully long process of evasion.
Clinton must break his pattern of avoid
ance and half-truths if he is to salvage his
presidency. The public has known about his
exploits for some time â€” through two elee

tions. It is clear that America can forgive his
behavior. America cannot, however, toler
ate deception.
The impeachment trial started Thursday
and it does not appear likely the President
shall be voted from office. The majority of
Americans polled oppose impeachment.
But even Clinton's most steadfast sup
porters must find their trust shaken slightly.
It may matter little that the president would
lie to cover up personal infidelities. It mat
ters a great deal, however, that he is honest
when discharging the more important duties
of his office.
President Clinton should leave office if
our trust in him has deteriorated to the point
where we are suspicious even in a matter as
grave as the deployment of troops. During
the holiday missile strikes, we saw evidence
that many citizens had lost this trust. It is
doubtful that it can ever be fullv restored.

warmest welcome to the new residents of 680
