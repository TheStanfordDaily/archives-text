Four female students were verbally harassed by an
unidentified man in the Wilbur parking lot Wednesday
night while walking to their ear.
The man, who approached the women on foot, asked
if they were interested in seeing him pull down his pants.
They said no and walked away. The man then did not fol
low them.
Though no illegal lewd exposure occurred, Stanford
Police are still interested in identifying the man for what
they consider "suspicious behavior," said Sgt. Hilary
Karp. the detective investigating the case for which there
are currently no leads.
The man is described as a 55-year-old white male with
grayish-brown hair, between 5 feet 8 inches and 5 feet 9
inches tall and between 150 and 160 pounds. He was
wearing a gray windbreaker and black Spandex pants.
"We always take these cases seriously," Karp said.
"We would like the community to be aware of this. This
could be a one-time incident or someone who could be
doing this again."
Karp advised those finding themselves in similar situ
ations to avoid confrontation and call the police.
Otero resident assistant Melissa Lima, a senior, said
she will advise her residents to only go out at night in
groups.
"I'm personally concerned as a female, I don't feel
safe going out by myself at night if there's somebody
wandering around like that. If there's somebody like
that. I'm scared for my residents as well."
Anyone who sees a suspicious man matching the de
scription should call 411, Karp said, while anyone with
information should call Karp directly at 723-9633.
