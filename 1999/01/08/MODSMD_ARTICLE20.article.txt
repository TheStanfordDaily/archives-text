## Card stings Sac State Hornets Club team serves as practice session for Stanford 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
Despite a convincing 15-10,15-2,15-3 victory
last night at Burnham Pavilion over the Sacra
mento State Hornets, the Stanford men's volley
ball team still has an official record of ()-().
Because the Hornets compete at the club
level as opposed to the varsity level, last night's
exhibition game cannot affect the Cardinal's
record. The match serves as mere preparation
for the more important conference matches to
come later in the season.

MEN S VOLLEYBALL
â–  Yesterday: Stanford defeated Sacramento State,
15-10,15-2.15-3

"We use this game to start the season off
right.' s.iid outside hitter Gabe Gardner. A ju
nior, Gardner transfer from IJSC, recorded 19
kills in his first game in a Cardinal uniform.
After overcoming inevitable opening-game
nerves, early scoring surges enabled the Cardi
nal to dominate the rest of the match. The Hor
nets never threatened Stanford, yet the Cardi
nal's early errors enabled them to remain com
petitive in the first game.
"Once we cut down on errors, we were able to
control the game," said head coach Ruben
Nieves.
The Cardinal committed eiuht hitting errors

in the first game, yet recorded only three in the
remaining games.
"We started out nervous," Gardner said.
"Then, we settled in and started playing volley
ball."
In addition to the hitting errors. Stanford was
penalized on an overlap call when freshmen set
ter Larry Witt was out of formation.
"We can't give a point like that away as the sea
son goes on," Nieves said.
Perhaps the Cardinal's early uneasiness
stemmed from the uncertainty regarding the
Hornets' playing style. Before most games, Stan
ford prepares by reviewing video and scouting
reports of their teammates. The Cardinal, how
ever, did not have this advantage before last
night's game and had to familiarize itself with the
Hornets during the first game of the match.
"We were getting used to their tendencies,"
said middle blocker Jeremy Bart. "We weren't
used to how they hit."
The inevitable jitters were intensified by the
new players on the Cardinal roster. Even return
ing members of the team found themselves ac
cepting new roles.
Junior outside hitter Andy Witt is the lone re
turning starter to the team.
"The team played a little nervous at first"
Nieves said. "We started two freshmen in their
first matches."
The caliber of club teams, such as Sacramen
to State, traditionally lags behind collegiate var
sity teams because club teams cannot attract the
nation's most talented players due to the inabili

ty to offer scholarships.
Despite this disadvantage, club teams are not
confined by the same strict NCAA regulations
regarding academic eligibility, players age and
practice hours as varsity teams.
Before last night's game, Nieves said that he
hoped his team could perform "organized" and
"poised" on the court. The Cardinal's play in the
second and third games matched his expecta
tions.
The Cardinal will seek to bring this level of in
tensity to the court next week when it takes on
the Loyola Marymount Lions at home.
Proving key to keeping that level of intensity
will be Stanford setter Larry Witt and outside
hitter Marcus Skacel, two freshmen who figure
to play prominent roles as the season progresses.
"Larry and Marcus bring a lot to the team,"
Bart said. "They have skills far superior to typi
cal freshmen."
Another newcomer to the starting rotation,
sophomore middle blocker Brett Youngberg.
will contribute as the season progresses. Al
though Youngberg played in only eight matches
last season, he and team captain Bart are likely
candidates to fill the spaces at the middle block
er position.
Bart, a third-year member of the team and
also the team captain, will play a new role to
compensate for the lack of experience at the
middle blocker position.
"1 love the middle blocker position," Bart
said. "I played it in high school, but it is a new ad
justment here."
