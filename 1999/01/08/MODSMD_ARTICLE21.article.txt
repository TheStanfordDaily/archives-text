## Card owns last 10 meetings

It may not have the raucous un
predictability of Big Game hut
tonight's Stanford — California
women's basketball game will prob
ably be more competitive than any
of the last 10 matchups, all of which
the Cardinal has won by an average
of 33.2 points.
Stanford, which has won the last
four Pacific 10 Conference titles,
and nine of the last 10. is only 5-8 so
far this season, and only 1-1 after the
first weekend of Pac-10 competition.
Cal is still no Pac-10 powerhouse,
but the Golden Bears do have a 6-5
overall record and an early upset til
nationally ranked Colorado State to
bolster their confidence.
"Cal's a very good team," said
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We're going to have to plav well.'

Pacific 10 Conference) vs. California
(6-5,0-2), 7:30 p.m.. Maples Pavilion.

The Cardinal lost only one Pac
10 game last season and that was to
eventual Sweet-16 participant Ari
zona. Monday, in only its second
conference game, Stanford lost to
Oregon, 63-59. With the C ardinal
still having to play conterence-fa
vorite UCLA twice and Oregon
once more, it is not likely that Stan
ford will make it through the rest of
its conference lineup unscathed.
VanDerveer is not overly con
cerned about the Cardinal s lacklus
ter start, though.
Our record of "5-8 doesn t matter
to me," she said. "We're 1-1 and
that's OK. We've been 1-1 at this
point and still gone on to win a Na
tional Championship. What matters
most is that we're improving and
we're healthy."
However, if the Cardinal hopes
to compete for the Pac-10 title and
claw back into the national rankings,
it cannot lose games to teams such as
Cal, voted in a tie for last in the con
ference by a preseason poll of Pac-10
coaches.
Like Oregon, which had not
beaten Stanford in 12 years. Cal has
the added impetus of ending its six
year losing streak to the Cardinal.
"We have a big target on our
back every time we go out there.
VanDerveer said. "[ 1 he other

teams] get really motivated."
The Golden Bears will have a lit
tle more than motivation going for
them tonight. Cal has a talented
backcourt led by senior point guard
Sherrise Smith and 6-foot-1 sopho
more shooting guard Masa Radovic,
a 1998 Pac-10 All-Freshman team
selection.
While Radovic may have a size
advantage on many Pac-10 shooting
guards, Stanford's Lindsey Yamasa
ki, also 6-1. should not have trouble
guarding her.
The Cardinal should have an ad
vantage in the post, as 6-6 sopho
more center Carolyn Moos is aver
aging more than 14 points a game.
However. Cal's Jennie Leander

should trouble Stanford on the
boards as she averages 6,3 rebounds.
The emergence of freshman for
ward Bethany Donaphin should
help the Cardinal down low. Al
though Donaphin had scored only a
total of 25 points in the team's first
11 games, she had a breakout week
end in Oregon.
Donaphin started for the first
time Saturday against Oregon State
and scored a game-high 20 points
and eight rebounds. Monday, she
scored in 10 points to go along with
her 10 rebounds.
"If we can just keep improving,
we'll be all right." VanDerveer said.
"Bethany's a great example for our
team."
