# No. 4 Cardinal to host Bears

According to most college bas
ketball analysts, a nine-mile strip
called Tobacco Road is the center
of the hoops world. The Carolina
road is home to the University of
North Carolina and Duke, respect
ed programs and arch rivals.
Time and again, ESPN com
mentator Dick Vitale can be heard
calling the ACC "the best confer
ence in America, baby!" Because
such beliefs are forcefully branded
on the brains of basketball fans
across the United States, not near
ly enough people have recognized
what is happening on the other side
of the country in the Pacific 10
Conference.
The Pac-10 has everything that
the ACC does.
And more.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: No. 4 Stanford (12-2
overall, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
vs. No. 25 California (10-2. 1-1), 7
p.m.. Maples Pavilion. TV: FX Net
work RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM),
KTCT (1050)
Pac-10 teams have done ex
tremely well out of conference and
in the NCAA Tournament — the
only true measuring stick for suc
cess — winning two of the last four
national championships.
The only thing missing in the
minds of basketball gurus must be
a tough local rivalry between qual
ity programs, which always pro
duces tight games packed with
emotion and intensity.
Hopefully the East Coast will
have its satellites pointed at
Maples Pavilion tomorrow night at
7 p.m so they can see such a rivalry,
as California (10-2, 1-1 Pac-10) vis
its fourth-ranked Stanford (12-2,2-
0).
The Battle of the Bay has quiet
ly become one of the best rivalries
in the Pac-10, if not the country.
Year in and year out, Stanford and
Cal combine to produce close,
physical games that often go down
to the final few possessions, mak
ing cliches like "you can throw the
records out the window" ring true.
Tomorrow's showdown at
Maples figures to be another chap
ter in the epic that is basketball's
version of the Big Game, as both
teams come into the game with mo
mentum gained from preseason

success.
The Cardinal opened up the
conference schedule with a bang,
sweeping the Oregon schools.
California, on the other hand,
dropped its Pac-10 opener to Ore
gon, then bounced back with a
tight win against Oregon State.
The week before, however. Cal
got the biggest win in the pro
gram's post-probation history
against North Carolina in the Pete
Newell Classic.
It is hard to figure how the
Golden Bears could struggle
against the Oregon schools after

heating a Carolina team that de
feated Stanford in the Preseason
NIT.
But Stanford head eoaeh Mike
Montgomery is not surprised.
"This always happens," Mont
gomery said. "The first week in
conference everybody anoints
everybody because they look at the
preseason records going in, but
conference is different. Nobody
plays the same people under the
same circumstances, so it's very
difficult to make anv sense out of


Forward Mark Madsen, seen here shooting over Oregon's A.D
Smith, will match up against the California Bears tomorrow night.
