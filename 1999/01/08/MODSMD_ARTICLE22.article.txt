### Will Flemming Staff writer 
According to most college bas
ketball analysts, a nine-mile strip
called Tobacco Road is the center
of the hoops world. The Carolina
road is home to the University of
North Carolina and Duke, respect
ed programs and arch rivals.
Time and again, ESPN com
mentator Dick Vitale can be heard
calling the ACC "the best confer
ence in America, baby!" Because
such beliefs are forcefully branded
on the brains of basketball fans
across the United States, not near
ly enough people have recognized
what is happening on the other side
of the country in the Pacific 10
Conference.
The Pac-10 has everything that
the ACC does.

Pac-10 teams have done ex
tremely well out of conference and
in the NCAA Tournament — the
only true measuring stick for suc
cess — winning two of the last four
national championships.
The only thing missing in the
minds of basketball gurus must be
a tough local rivalry between qual
ity programs, which always pro
duces tight games packed with
emotion and intensity.
Hopefully the East Coast will
have its satellites pointed at
Maples Pavilion tomorrow night at
7 p.m so they can see such a rivalry,
as California (10-2, 1-1 Pac-10) vis
its fourth-ranked Stanford (12-2,2-
0).
The Battle of the Bay has quiet
ly become one of the best rivalries
in the Pac-10, if not the country.
Year in and year out, Stanford and
Cal combine to produce close,
physical games that often go down
to the final few possessions, mak
ing cliches like "you can throw the
records out the window" ring true.
Tomorrow's showdown at
Maples figures to be another chap
ter in the epic that is basketball's
version of the Big Game, as both
teams come into the game with mo
mentum gained from preseason

success.
The Cardinal opened up the
conference schedule with a bang,
sweeping the Oregon schools.
California, on the other hand,
dropped its Pac-10 opener to Ore
gon, then bounced back with a
tight win against Oregon State.
The week before, however. Cal
got the biggest win in the pro
gram's post-probation history
against North Carolina in the Pete
Newell Classic.
It is hard to figure how the
Golden Bears could struggle
against the Oregon schools after

heating a Carolina team that de
feated Stanford in the Preseason
NIT.
But Stanford head eoaeh Mike
Montgomery is not surprised.
"This always happens," Mont
gomery said. "The first week in
conference everybody anoints
everybody because they look at the
preseason records going in, but
conference is different. Nobody
plays the same people under the
same circumstances, so it's very
difficult to make anv sense out of

who's who.
"In conference, every game is
extremely important, and you have
to prepare yourself."
The pregame preparations for
this particular contest with Cal will
reveal an extremely talented and
experienced Golden Bear squad.
California is led by senior guard
Cieno Carlisle, who is averaging
18.4 points per game and was in
strumental in the Bears' second
half comeback against North Car
olina. Sophomore forward Sean
Lampley is perhaps Cal's best over
all weapon, averaging 13.4 points
and 10.4 rebounds a contest.
Cal is "very athletic," Mont
gomery said. "Very veteran — they
have four fifth-year seniors.
Carlisle's certainly among the top
scorers in (he league and his ability
to create off the dribble makes him
extra tough. They've got some size
now, and they're quick enough.

They're athletic enough where they
can defend. They can get up and get
after you. They're a team that I
think is going to be a contender. I
think they're legit right down the
line."
Carlisle's backcourt partner,
Thomas Kilgore, is another offen
sive weapon for the Golden Bears.
The senior guard averages just over
12 points a game, and often surpris
es defenses that are keying on
Carlisle.
"Kilgore, he's a proven player, a
veteran," Montgomery said. "The
guy guarding him has got a tough
job because he puts it on the floor.
He has had (good) performances in
the league. He's certainly one of
the guys you're going to talk about
defending. I think Carlisle has
scored more points, so obviously
every time he puts up numbers,
everybody talks about him, and
that's certainly going to be a focal
point, but I wouldn't presume to
downplay Kilgore at all."
Stanford, meanwhile, has its fair
share of offensive weapons, along

with the defensive pressure needed
to shut down the Cal offense.
Tim Young is coming off a
breakout game against Oregon, in
which the fifth-year center scored
23 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and
appeared to regain the confidence
that deserted him in the preseason.
With injuries to Mike McDon
ald, Ryan Mendez and Jason
Collins — three key reserves for
the Cardinal — the starters have
been forced to play more minutes.
Led by point guard Arthur Lee, the
senior-laden starting five has re
sponded brilliantly, maintaining
defensive pressure and offensive
execution for the full 40 minutes.
The Cardinal also has a distinct
homecourt advantage, as the Sixth
Man Club should be out in full
force to create a raucous and un
friendly atmosphere for the Gold
en Bears.
Who knows, the noise inside
Maples may even be loud enough
to wake the rest of America up to
the fact that this is college basket
ball at its finest.

Pac-10 teams have done ex
tremely well out of conference and
in the NCAA Tournament — the
only true measuring stick for suc
cess — winning two of the last four
national championships.
The only thing missing in the
minds of basketball gurus must be
a tough local rivalry between qual
ity programs, which always pro
duces tight games packed with
emotion and intensity.
Hopefully the East Coast will
have its satellites pointed at
Maples Pavilion tomorrow night at
7 p.m so they can see such a rivalry,
as California (10-2, 1-1 Pac-10) vis
its fourth-ranked Stanford (12-2,2-
0).
The Battle of the Bay has quiet
ly become one of the best rivalries
in the Pac-10, if not the country.
Year in and year out, Stanford and
Cal combine to produce close,
physical games that often go down
to the final few possessions, mak
ing cliches like "you can throw the
records out the window" ring true.
Tomorrow's showdown at
Maples figures to be another chap
ter in the epic that is basketball's
version of the Big Game, as both
teams come into the game with mo
mentum gained from preseason

success.
The Cardinal opened up the
conference schedule with a bang,
sweeping the Oregon schools.
California, on the other hand,
dropped its Pac-10 opener to Ore
gon, then bounced back with a
tight win against Oregon State.
The week before, however. Cal
got the biggest win in the pro
gram's post-probation history
against North Carolina in the Pete
Newell Classic.
It is hard to figure how the
Golden Bears could struggle
against the Oregon schools after

heating a Carolina team that de
feated Stanford in the Preseason
NIT.
But Stanford head eoaeh Mike
Montgomery is not surprised.
"This always happens," Mont
gomery said. "The first week in
conference everybody anoints
everybody because they look at the
preseason records going in, but
conference is different. Nobody
plays the same people under the
same circumstances, so it's very
difficult to make anv sense out of

who's who.
"In conference, every game is
extremely important, and you have
to prepare yourself."
The pregame preparations for
this particular contest with Cal will
reveal an extremely talented and
experienced Golden Bear squad.
California is led by senior guard
Cieno Carlisle, who is averaging
18.4 points per game and was in
strumental in the Bears' second
half comeback against North Car
olina. Sophomore forward Sean
Lampley is perhaps Cal's best over
all weapon, averaging 13.4 points
and 10.4 rebounds a contest.
Cal is "very athletic," Mont
gomery said. "Very veteran — they
have four fifth-year seniors.
Carlisle's certainly among the top
scorers in (he league and his ability
to create off the dribble makes him
extra tough. They've got some size
now, and they're quick enough.

They're athletic enough where they
can defend. They can get up and get
after you. They're a team that I
think is going to be a contender. I
think they're legit right down the
line."
Carlisle's backcourt partner,
Thomas Kilgore, is another offen
sive weapon for the Golden Bears.
The senior guard averages just over
12 points a game, and often surpris
es defenses that are keying on
Carlisle.
"Kilgore, he's a proven player, a
veteran," Montgomery said. "The
guy guarding him has got a tough
job because he puts it on the floor.
He has had (good) performances in
the league. He's certainly one of
the guys you're going to talk about
defending. I think Carlisle has
scored more points, so obviously
every time he puts up numbers,
everybody talks about him, and
that's certainly going to be a focal
point, but I wouldn't presume to
downplay Kilgore at all."
Stanford, meanwhile, has its fair
share of offensive weapons, along

with the defensive pressure needed
to shut down the Cal offense.
Tim Young is coming off a
breakout game against Oregon, in
which the fifth-year center scored
23 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and
appeared to regain the confidence
that deserted him in the preseason.
With injuries to Mike McDon
ald, Ryan Mendez and Jason
Collins — three key reserves for
the Cardinal — the starters have
been forced to play more minutes.
Led by point guard Arthur Lee, the
senior-laden starting five has re
sponded brilliantly, maintaining
defensive pressure and offensive
execution for the full 40 minutes.
The Cardinal also has a distinct
homecourt advantage, as the Sixth
Man Club should be out in full
force to create a raucous and un
friendly atmosphere for the Gold
en Bears.
Who knows, the noise inside
Maples may even be loud enough
to wake the rest of America up to
the fact that this is college basket
ball at its finest.
