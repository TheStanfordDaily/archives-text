# Card opens the season at California
## 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
Besides the occasional phenom, it
is very rare to find a freshman athlete
who possesses the ability to con
tribute in his first year on the colle
giate level.
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team has six.
The Cardinal will need its elite
freshmen to make solid contributions
if it is to contend for a fourth NCAA
title and improve upon a disappoint

ing 1997-98 season in which it was
plagued by both injuries and a lack of
depth.
"Last year we had a lot of injuries
and a difficult time filling up the line
up card but now we have a much
deeper squad." said head coach
Sadao Hamada, w ho begins his 27th
season on the Farm.
Despite having such a young
team, the Cardinal enters tonight's
meet at No. 2 California ranked
eighth in the country by a preseason
coaches poll in Gymlnfo. The high

ranking is due in large part to the
strong group of returning lettermen
from last year's squad.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Tonight: Season Opener: No.8
Stanford at No. 2 California, 7 p.m.
Redshirt junior co-captain Scott
Finkelstein is the lone returning Ail-
American on the team and is expect
ed to lead the team both in and out
side of the gym.
But Finkelstein brings a different
kind of experience to the team as
well.
Being a Resident Assistant in
Donner, an all-frosh dorm, Finkel
stein knows a thing or two about ac
climating freshmen to the collegiate
lifestyle.
"The meets at the beginning of the
season will be a good learning experi
ence for our freshmen," Finkelstein
said. "The potential is definitely
there. 1 hope that they can learn a lot
in the early meets that don't mean as
much."
Joining Finkelstein is junior co
captain Jason Katsampes who has
been dubbed as the most talented
gymnast Hamada has ever coached.
Last season, Katsampes placed
second in the all-around competition
at the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Championships and will be a

key component in Stanford's title
pursuit this year.
"Jason is very talented and 1 think
that he can make the Olympic team if
he improves his consistency in one or
two events," Hamada said.
Of the six freshmen, twins Adam
and Brandon Berkenbile, as well as
David Durante are expected to make
the most immediate impacts. All
three are members of the United
States Junior Olympic national team
— an experience that has prepared
them well for collegiate competition.
Stanford opens up the 1999 season
tonight at 7 p.m. when it takes on two
time defending national champion
California at the Recreational Sports
Facility in Berkeley.
"Cal has won the last two champi
onships largely because of the two
I Ikrainian Olympians that graduated
last year." said former Cardinal All-
American Clarence Miao. "They are
still a very good team though."
"If we can stay even with them or
beat them it will be a good indication
of this year's team," Hamada added.
By opening up against a quality
opponent, the Cardinal hopes to
gauge its progress and get its fresh
men some valuable experience. Ex
perience that hopefully will pay off in
April when the Cardinal tries for its
fourth NCAA championship in the
19905.
