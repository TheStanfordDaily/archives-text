### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
Every championship program has
to have a breakthrough year, a year in
which the groundwork is laid for fu
ture successes.
After finishing off the best season
in its history, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team could be content to
rest on its laurels.
But it's not.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Sunday: No. H) Stanford at UC-
Davis, 4 p.m.
This year the Cardinal will look to
better a season in which it captured
the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onship and had an individual NCAA
Champion for the first time in school
history.
"Last year we still had a goal of
wanting to go to NCAAs but we
didn't have the confidence to know
that we were good enough," said
sophomore all-around competitor
Jen Exaltacion "This year we have a
whole new outlook, we all realize that
we can [win nationals]."
Exaltacion is not the only one who
believes that the Cardinal is capable
of great things this season. Stanford
has been ranked 10th by the presea
son coaches' top 25 poll in Gymlnfo.
"It's very positive to see that other
coaches respect us." said second-year
head coach Mark Cook of the rank
ing.
"We weren't that confident going
into last season, but this year with the
influx of some very motivated fresh
men combined with a different out

look and strong returners, expecta
tions are much higher." Cook added.
"We really should be a team to be
reckoned with."
Leading the Cardinal this year will
be senior co-captain Amy Murakami
and junior Larissa Fontaine. Both
will be called upon to provide leader
ship to four highly touted freshmen as
well as pace the team in competitions.
Murakami looks to improve upon
a junior season in which she was Stan
ford's best all-around gymnast and
set school records in the uneven bars
(9.975) and the floor exercise (9.950).
Fontaine return.4 from a 1
more season in which she battled an
injury for the first four meets of the
season but made a remarkable come
back in winning Stanford's first indi
vidual championship in the vault at
NCA As. Fontaine was a key contrib
utor to the Cardinal's Pac-10 title as
well, scoring no less than a 9.825 in the
three events in which she competed.
Cook also expects Exaltacion to
improve upon a freshman season in
which she tied for the best score bv a
Cardinal gymnast on the balance
beam and placed fourth in that event
at Pac-lOs.
"Jen's preseason training has been
phenomenal and we going to look for
her to be a top all-arounder this sea
son." Cook said.
Stanford will be put to its first test
Sunday when it travels to UC'-Davis
for a 4 p.m. nonconference meet.
Although the Aggies are un
ranked. they return 10 letterwinners
from last years 14-5 squad that placed
seventh at the NCAA Regional
Tournament. Leading the Aggies are
Ail-Americans Dawn McDiarmid
and Bridgit Fortino.

"We're not going in there to beat
Davis. We're going in there to get the
kinks out and see where we're at in

terms of scoring," Cook said. "Davis
should he a very good primer for our
meet with No. 4 Utah in two weeks."
