# A 						tough two days
## No. 1 Stanford to meet No.7 and No. 2 
### Chad Morse 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's swim team should not
be expecting any Southern hospi
tality this weekend.
The Cardinal will match up
against two very talented teams
within the next 24 hours. Defend
ing NCAA champion Stanford
takes on Auburn today and Geor
gia tomorrow, last year's sixth
and third-place teams, respective
ly.
Despite his team's dynamic
talent, Stanford head coach
Richard Quick knows this trip is
no cakewalk. Quick is especially
conscious of the emerging
strength of the Georgia Lady
Bulldogs, whom he has favored to
win this year's NCAA Champi
onship.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford at No. 7
Auburn
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford at No. 2
Georgia

Seventh-ranked Auburn
boasts a formidable contingent.
In Katie Taylor, Mimi Bowen,
Rada Qwen and Katie Ryan,
Auburn has one of the strongest
sprinting lineups in the country.
Bowen and Ryan also extend
their talents to the butterfly
events as well. Stanford has the
edge in the relays and individual
medley events, but Auburn
should put up a fight in all other
events.
Georgia, currently ranked No.
2, recently defeated Alabama
handily. Distance swimmer Beth
Timmons. sprinter Kristy Kowal
and freestyler Ashley Whitney
comprise the heart of Georgia's
talent. Although their results
have been somewhat slower than
Stanford's thus far. times this
early in the season are not a clear
indication of things to come.
Although the Stanford team
has been competing since early

October, the Auburn and Geor
gia meets start the season in
earnest.
For the next month and a half,
Stanford will be embroiled in a
lengthy string of dual meets,
which culminate in the Pacific 10
Championships in late February.
From there, the Cardinal
should make its annual postsea
son run, taking on the best of the
best at the NCAAs in - where
else? — Athens. Ga., home of the
Bulldogs.
If either Auburn or Georgia
manages to topple Stanford in a
dual meet, it would mark only the
second time in Quick's decade
long career that any team has
managed such a feat.
Stanford's record during this
sparkling dynasty? A not-too
shabby 76-1.
The two-meet stint should give
the swimming world a peek at
what this unparalleled squad can
do. A coaching legend in his own
right. Quick will also have some
impressive company on this trip,
including Olympic gold medal
ists, reigning NCAA champs and
world record holders.
Leading Stanford's charge are
returning NCAA champs Cather
ine Fox and Misty Hvman. both
of whom set NCAA records at
last year's championship.
Fox. who specializes in sprint
freestyle and backstroke, took
two golden souvenirs home from
Atlanta in 19%. As a junior, the
14-time All-American has been
cruising past the competition
once again this season. In the
Card's most recent meet against
Nevada, Fox captured both the
100- and 200-vard backstroke.
Her times were impressive, but
they should get even faster as the
season progresses.
Hyman. now a sophomore and
no longer the new kid on the
block, is no stranger to success in
the pool.
As a freshman, Hyman took

home three NCAA titles, set an
NCAA record and earned herself
NCAA Swimmer of the Year hon
ors. Not a bad year's work, by any
means.
This year, she has had an oppor
tunity to swim some events out of
her usual repertoire.
Primarily a backstroker and a
butterflyer, Hyman dabbled with
the middle-distance freestyle
events earlier this year with im
pressive results. At a USC invita
tional meet in October, Hyman
placed second in the 500-yard
freestyle with a blazing time.
As with Fox, this year marks one
of change for Hyman. New NCAA
rules have limited the distance
backstrokers and butterflyers can
remain underwater after entering
the water on a dive and after mak
ing a turn.
Hyman and Fox are both mas
ters of an energy saving kicking

technique that propels them quick
ly underwater.
While Fox and Hyman make
fine-tuned adjustments, their team
mates are pressing straight ahead.
Versatile junior Gabrielle Rose has
been dominating the 200-yard dis
tance, whether the event be
freestyle, individual medley, or
breastroke. Along with Fox and se
nior co-captain Elin Austevoll,
Rose captured two events at the
USC meet, setting a pool record in
the 200IM.
Austevoll, an Olympian from
Norway, is Stanford's resident ex
pert in the breastroke.
She currently holds the school
record in the 2(X) and is close in the
100, where her time ranks as sec
ond on Stanford's all-time list.
But the success of Stanford
swimming does not rest solely on
the shoulders of its superstars.
The fact is, the entire women's
roster reads like a who's who of col
legiate women's swimming. Depth
has always been the most impor
tant ingredient in Stanford's

proven formula and this year is no
exception.
Adding to the mix this year is a
sensational group of freshmen that
have been quick to prove that they
belong on the best team in colle
giate swimming.
Freshman Sylvia Bereknyei
christened her Stanford swimming
career with three first-place finish
es in her very first competition, a
dual meet with Notre Dame.
Bereknyei, like many of her team
mates, displays a remarkable versa
tility that is not often found at such
a high level of competition.
Fellow freshmen Shelly Ripple,
Alexis Oakland, Jessica Foschi and
Whitney Leatherwood have also
risen above expectations and have
already made significant contribu
tions to the Stanford squad.
The women's diving team also
packs a powerful punch.
Sophomore Kim Powers and re
turns from a strong performance at
last years NCAAs, along with se
nior Kari Kokka and sophomore
Shawn Sinesky.
