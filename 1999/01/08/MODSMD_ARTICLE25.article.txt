# A
						tough two days
## No. 1 Stanford to meet No.7 and No. 2 
### Chad Morse 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's swim team should not
be expecting any Southern hospi
tality this weekend.
The Cardinal will match up
against two very talented teams
within the next 24 hours. Defend
ing NCAA champion Stanford
takes on Auburn today and Geor
gia tomorrow, last year's sixth
and third-place teams, respective
ly.
Despite his team's dynamic
talent, Stanford head coach
Richard Quick knows this trip is
no cakewalk. Quick is especially
conscious of the emerging
strength of the Georgia Lady
Bulldogs, whom he has favored to
win this year's NCAA Champi
onship.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford at No. 7
Auburn
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford at No. 2
Georgia

Seventh-ranked Auburn
boasts a formidable contingent.
In Katie Taylor, Mimi Bowen,
Rada Qwen and Katie Ryan,
Auburn has one of the strongest
sprinting lineups in the country.
Bowen and Ryan also extend
their talents to the butterfly
events as well. Stanford has the
edge in the relays and individual
medley events, but Auburn
should put up a fight in all other
events.
Georgia, currently ranked No.
2, recently defeated Alabama
handily. Distance swimmer Beth
Timmons. sprinter Kristy Kowal
and freestyler Ashley Whitney
comprise the heart of Georgia's
talent. Although their results
have been somewhat slower than
Stanford's thus far. times this
early in the season are not a clear
indication of things to come.
Although the Stanford team
has been competing since early

October, the Auburn and Geor
gia meets start the season in
earnest.
For the next month and a half,
Stanford will be embroiled in a
lengthy string of dual meets,
which culminate in the Pacific 10
Championships in late February.
From there, the Cardinal
should make its annual postsea
son run, taking on the best of the
best at the NCAAs in - where
else? — Athens. Ga., home of the
Bulldogs.
If either Auburn or Georgia
manages to topple Stanford in a
dual meet, it would mark only the
second time in Quick's decade
long career that any team has
managed such a feat.
Stanford's record during this
sparkling dynasty? A not-too
shabby 76-1.
The two-meet stint should give
the swimming world a peek at
what this unparalleled squad can
do. A coaching legend in his own
right. Quick will also have some
impressive company on this trip,
including Olympic gold medal
ists, reigning NCAA champs and
world record holders.
Leading Stanford's charge are
returning NCAA champs Cather
ine Fox and Misty Hvman. both
of whom set NCAA records at
last year's championship.
Fox. who specializes in sprint
freestyle and backstroke, took
two golden souvenirs home from
Atlanta in 19%. As a junior, the
14-time All-American has been
cruising past the competition
once again this season. In the
Card's most recent meet against
Nevada, Fox captured both the
100- and 200-vard backstroke.
Her times were impressive, but
they should get even faster as the
season progresses.
Hyman. now a sophomore and
no longer the new kid on the
block, is no stranger to success in
the pool.
As a freshman, Hyman took
