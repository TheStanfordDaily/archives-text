# Foreign enrollment increases
## Stanford reflects nationwide trend for international students

Despite crises abroad, the total
number of international students at
Stanford has reached an all-time
high, according to John Pearson, di
rector of the Bechtel International
Center.
Enrollment totaled 2,878 in
ternational students, or 18.5 per
cent of the total campus popula
tion, including undergraduates,
graduate students and postdoctor
al students.
Stanford's enrollment patterns
reflect a nationwide trend. A re
cently released report from the
Chronicle of Higher Education re
vealed that the number of foreign
scholars in the United States doing
research or teaching has increased
by 5.1 percent this year, after four
years of remaining constant.
"We are a very top-heavy uni
versity in terms of our foreign stu
dents," Pearson said, referring to
the fact that most international stu
dents are in graduate or postdoctor
al programs. Statistics from Paddy
McGowan, director of Institutional
Research in the Office of the Regis

trar, show that 28.2 percent of the
graduate students and 38 percent of
the postdoctoral students come
from foreign countries, compared
to only 4.6 peicent of the under
graduates.
International students who
apply to Stanford as undergradu
ates face tremendous competition,
according to Jon Reider, senior as
sociate director of admissions.
"Stanford is known for appeal
ing to risk takers. [These appli
cants] are pioneers," Reider said.
Last year, 1,800 foreign students
applied for undergraduate admis
sion, and 309 are currently enrolled.
Like many academic institutions
of its caliber, Stanford does not fol
low a policy of need-blind admis
sions for international students. Fi
nancial aid is limited to approxi
mately 30 international undergrad
uates annually, according to Rei
der.
Rasi Wickramasinghe, a fresh
man from Sri Lanka, cited a com
mon concern among international
students: how to afford Stanford's
tuition.
Sri Lanka's "GNP per capita is
$500 per year. My parents cannot

dream of paying $34,000," he said.
Graduate students generally re
ceive even less financial aid, al
though international students at the
doctoral level are often funded by
Stanford.
The financial crisis in East Asia
has not yet slowed the rate of appli
cations from those countries. Many
international students, particularly
those from Singapore or India, re
ceive funding from their govern

ments or private corporations. This
funding is in jeopardy because of
the economic disorder and curren
cy devaluation.
International students are
drawn to Stanford for a variety of
reasons. "It's a very challenging at
mosphere," said Juan Pablo Toro, a
graduate student in philosophy.
"Stanford is technically very well
