# Foreign enrollment increases
## Stanford reflects nationwide trend for international students 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Despite crises abroad, the total
number of international students at
Stanford has reached an all-time
high, according to John Pearson, di
rector of the Bechtel International
Center.
Enrollment totaled 2,878 in
ternational students, or 18.5 per
cent of the total campus popula
tion, including undergraduates,
graduate students and postdoctor
al students.
Stanford's enrollment patterns
reflect a nationwide trend. A re
cently released report from the
Chronicle of Higher Education re
vealed that the number of foreign
scholars in the United States doing
research or teaching has increased
by 5.1 percent this year, after four
years of remaining constant.
"We are a very top-heavy uni
versity in terms of our foreign stu
dents," Pearson said, referring to
the fact that most international stu
dents are in graduate or postdoctor
al programs. Statistics from Paddy
McGowan, director of Institutional
Research in the Office of the Regis

trar, show that 28.2 percent of the
graduate students and 38 percent of
the postdoctoral students come
from foreign countries, compared
to only 4.6 peicent of the under
graduates.
International students who
apply to Stanford as undergradu
ates face tremendous competition,
according to Jon Reider, senior as
sociate director of admissions.
"Stanford is known for appeal
ing to risk takers. [These appli
cants] are pioneers," Reider said.
Last year, 1,800 foreign students
applied for undergraduate admis
sion, and 309 are currently enrolled.
Like many academic institutions
of its caliber, Stanford does not fol
low a policy of need-blind admis
sions for international students. Fi
nancial aid is limited to approxi
mately 30 international undergrad
uates annually, according to Rei
der.
Rasi Wickramasinghe, a fresh
man from Sri Lanka, cited a com
mon concern among international
students: how to afford Stanford's
tuition.
Sri Lanka's "GNP per capita is
$500 per year. My parents cannot

dream of paying $34,000," he said.
Graduate students generally re
ceive even less financial aid, al
though international students at the
doctoral level are often funded by
Stanford.
The financial crisis in East Asia
has not yet slowed the rate of appli
cations from those countries. Many
international students, particularly
those from Singapore or India, re
ceive funding from their govern

ments or private corporations. This
funding is in jeopardy because of
the economic disorder and curren
cy devaluation.
International students are
drawn to Stanford for a variety of
reasons. "It's a very challenging at
mosphere," said Juan Pablo Toro, a
graduate student in philosophy.
"Stanford is technically very well

endowed. You get a first rate edu
cation with teachers at the cutting
edge of the research."
According to Pearson, Bechtel
International Center provides "in
ternationally related services," in
cluding advising for international
students and scholars, study abroad
programs outside of those offered
by Overseas Studies, support for
applicants to Rhodes, Marshall and
other international scholarship pro
grams and general programming
functions for the international com

munity at Stanford.
Pearson mentioned that interna
tional students are concerned with
retaining their cultural ties, as
demonstrated by more than 30 in
ternational student groups.
"I'd like to think that it's the
Stanford reputation that's bringing
in the increased number of interna
tional students," Pearson said. "I'd
hope that we're successful in mak
ing their stay here more reward
ing."
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, the Department
of Commerce has calculated that
U.S. higher education is now the
country's fifth largest service-sector

export. A U.S. education is ex
tremely valuable in the world
today, particularly in the sciences,
according to the article.
International students make up
40.4 percent of enrollment in the
School of Earth Sciences, and 33.9
percent in the School of Engineer
ing.
An astounding 48 of 55 students
in the Petroleum Engineering de
partment come from foreign coun
tries.
Many international students
have sacrificed opportunities at
home in order to attend Stanford.
Wickramasinghe was accepted
to medical school in Sri Lanka, but

he chose instead to go back to the
beginning. "It was a very big deci
sion for me. I knew I was going to
have to go back to square one."
He encountered many difficul
ties during his first quarter.
"I had never studied in English
before. The education system in Sri
Lanka â€” I was spoon-fed." He had
a hard time adjusting culturally as
well. "Sometimes I thought, 'What
did I do by coming here?' "
But, Wickramasinghe is pre
pared to live up to the challenge.
"If I was a doctor in Sri Lanka,
the best I could be is the best in Sri
Lanka. If I come here, the best I
could be is the best in the world."
