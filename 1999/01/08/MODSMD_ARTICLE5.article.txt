## 
### Marie Sotelo 
Congressional scholars from
around the country will gather here
on Friday and Saturday, Jan. 15 and
16. as part of the "History of Con
gress" conference hosted by the So
cial Science History Institute.
The conference is co-sponsored
by the institute and the UC-San
Diego as part of the celebrations for
the 50th Anniversary of Stanford's
School of Humanities and Sciences.
It will honor Stanford's long tradition
in the study of policy and legislatures.

Almost 40 years ago, Stanford
Prof. Emeritus Heinz Eulau — now
at the Hoover Institute — published
"The Legislative System," initiating
the University's continuing tradition
of excellence in legislative studies.
Research in the area hardly exist
ed 30 years ago.
"Today, it's a very rich field," said
Political Science Prof. David Brady, a
board member of the institute and
conference panel chair. "The confer
ence will address a wide series of
questions about the contemporary
Congress in a historical context."

We can better understand how
and why gridlock occurs in the policy
making process by using history as a
laboratory, according to Brady.
During a series of panel discus
sions, scholars will examine and ana
lyze different eras of congressional
organization.
These leading scholars will pri
marily address questions of the role
and meaning of political parties, com
mittees and legislative information
