### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
After 24 years on the force, his
assignments ranging from nabbing
the "jogging burglar" to protecting
visiting dignitaries such as the
Queen of England and President
Clinton, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer is retiring this
month. He will be replaced by 20-
year veteran Lt. Del Bandy.
When Niemeyer, 60, arrived in
the police were not well re
spected on campus. With Police
Chief Marv Herrington. he raised
the standards of the department
and emphasized the importance of
record-keeping.
"I also feel that I was really pret
ty good at document-keeping.... I
have manuals for everything, 1
hope people will avail themselves."
"I don't think there's any case
that's too complicated for us to
handle," Niemeyer said.
One particularly infamous case
demonstrated the skill of Captain
Niemeyer and his force.
Robert Lee O'Conner, called
the "jogging burglar" because of
his past as a track coach, broke into
homes in Palo Alto and nearby
communities during the early 1980s
and stole $1.5 million in property.
The department worked for two
years to arrest him.
The department organized a so
phisticated surveillance team, em
ploying 20 officers on hikes, motor
scooters and motorcycles, in trees
and cars. The officers, aware thai
he was a professional thief and con
cerned that they might be
"burned," or detected by a scanner,
changed the codes they used to
communicate each night.
Despite the labor-intensive ef
fort. the burglar "hit three houses
in one night, right under our
noses," Niemeyer said.
The thief left Palo Alto for six
months, but when he returned, he
increased the risks by committing
"hot-prowl burglaries." He broke
into two-story homes at night, qui
etly ransacked the first floor while

the owners slept, found their car
keys, loaded up his loot into their
car and drove away.
O'Conner stole art, jewelry, an
tique firearms, furniture, Persian
rugs and furs as his "retirement
stash," as he told Niemeyer.
Niemeyer was instrumental in
catching the burglar, as Niemeyer
recognized the stolen goods thanks
to his detailed records.
"We had a lot of cooperation.

but it did put us
on the map."
Niemeyer re
called. Hanging
in his office is a
large map of
Palo Alto that
was used in
court, dotted
with pins that

represent the burglaries.
To Niemeyer, the case was "an
example of how a small department
can have a capable magnitude."
In building up the department
over the years. Niemeyer found re
cruiting to be the biggest challenge
of the job. "It's very, very arduous,
to say the least. We require highly
qualified people, two years college
minimum, with good moral charac
ter. They need to be drug-free, pass
exams, written and oral, and have
the physical abilities." In addition,
the recruits must pass psychologi
cal tests and polygraph tests on
their background.
"Out of KM) people," Niemeyer
said, "only two or three will be
come officers."
"Fifty percent are eliminated by
the written testing procedure," he
said. "There are some of the most
sophisticated people in the country
here at the University and the offi
cers need to be able to communi
cate effectively in writing and
speaking."
In addition to interesting cases,
Niemeyer appreciated working
with "bright, refreshing" students
who cause "very, very few student
problems."


Niemeyer
He remembers in the mid-1970s
when there was more tension be
tween students and authorities. In
one incident, students took over the
president's office in protest of Stan
ford investments in companies that
traded in apartheid South Africa.
The department, reluctant to arrest
them, negotiated to resolve the cri
sis.
He also enjoyed meeting inter
esting people. In his years, Stanford
had more than 250 major visits, in
cluding Presidents Gerald Ford,
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton,
and foreign heads of state such as
Queen Elizabeth and the Emperor
and Empress of Japan.
"Gorbachev [in 1990] was the
biggest visit," Niemeyer said, re
calling when he worked with the
Secret Service and Russian author
ities.
"It's an interesting experience,
working with other people, all with
different agendas," he added.
"I'm also going to miss the ca
maraderie of the people I work
with," he said, although he's not
going to miss getting up early and
fighting the traffic.
Despite being a football fan, he
will be glad not to see any more Big
Games. "There's so much violence

and animosity," he said. "People
getting hurt and attacked â€” it's
ridiculous."
In his quarter-century of experi
ence at Stanford, Niemeyer has
found that the foundation of police
work has not changed substantially,
although he considers computers to
be more and more important in de
tective work.
"Cop work is still the same: talk
ing and looking someone in the eye,
going out to the crime scene and in
vestigating," he said. "I've read de
tective books from the 1930s that
say the same thing."
With his new free time, Niemey
er will indulge his love of race cars.
He intends to go to race car events
in Daytona and in Las Vegas and,
as a "wannabe driver," take more
driving lessons.
Ramona Kelley, Stanford Police
administrative services manager,
has known Niemeyer since 1978.
She is definitely going to miss
"his knowledge, his work ethic, his
honesty," she said. "He tells you
like it is .... 1 feel very confident
when I go to him for information
that he'll give me the best informa
tion."
She admires him as a "mentor,
confidant, and a good example"
who always can "remember names
and dates right of the top of his
head, from cases that are 20 years
old."
