THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON EUROPEAN MONITORS
ARE ENGINEERED TO A HIGHER STANDARD.
IT'S THE LAW.
Granted, it's not easy to build monitors for the world's strictest quality standards. Or to pass the rigorous tests demanded by ISO-9241-3, TCO and NUTEK. But as a result, our moni
tors come with pinpoint clarity and faster refresh rates, for reduced eyestrain. Remarkably low emissions. And an unsurpassed level of reliability.
While in some corners of the world all this might be considered a luxury, in Europe it's just the way things are done. And it's your assurance that with Nokia, you'll always see a world of
difference.
Visit the Stanford Bookstore to see the difference yourself or, for more information on our full line of 15" to 21" displays, please call I-800-BY-NOKIA, or visit us at www.nokia.com.
