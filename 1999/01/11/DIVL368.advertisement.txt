Another Deloitte Consulting Difference
THEM:
Buttoned down.
DELOITTE CONSULTING:
Relaxed fit.
Deloitte Consulting goes about its business somewhat differently. Here, walls are down; lines of communication are fluid.
The atmosphere is relaxed and confident, never arrogant
This flexible, collaborative approach prompted Computenuorld to rate us as the "most user-friendly" among the major
consulting players. This means greater buy-in on the client side for the strategies they played a part in developing. Overall, our
intent is to transfer knowledge and deliver results that clients can build on — results that don't unravel
when we leave.
We are looking for top performers to participate in either our Systems Analyst or Business Analyst Program.
As a Systems Analyst at Deloitte Consulting, you will work with seasoned professionals on high-profile assignments, as well as
take part in technical and management consulting training courses offered around the country. After training, you will hit the
ground running - and take on meaningful responsibilities and tackle significant business problems leveraging state-of-the-art
technologies.
The Business Analyst Program is designed for individuals wishing to pursue an MBA from a top business school. As part of a
client engagement team, you'll develop both consulting and business competencies.
If you're intent on building your consulting career with a firm that puts mutual collaboration and sustainable results ahead of
hierarchies and individual agendas, relax...
YouH fit in perfectly.
