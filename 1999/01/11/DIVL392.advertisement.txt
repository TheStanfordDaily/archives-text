MORE ABOUT TEACHING!
In California, a Single Subject Teaching Credential authorizes you to teach a specific subject in a departmen
talized class. To earn one, you are legally required to verify your subject matter competence. The way for
Stanford students to do this is to pass the Commission-adopted examinations, which are the appropriate Single
Subject Assessments tor Teaching (SSAT) test(s), and the PRAXIS test(s) for the subject area you wish to teach.
The 1998-99 rest registration bulletins are available at the Stanford Teacher Education Program in CERAS
