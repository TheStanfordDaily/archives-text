# Royalties make big money

In a world where research results have become mar
ketable commodities, research universities have come
to rely on a steady income flow from patents and inven
tions.
Research universities all over the United States have
seen a 33 percent increase in patent revenues over 1996,
according to an annual survey released last month by
the Association of University Technology Managers.
Stanford placed third in amount earned among U.S.
universities, with a reported $34 million from royalties
and inventions in fiscal 1997.
The University of California system was the top
earner at $61.3 million, followed by Columbia Univer
sity at $46.1 million.

The association reported that the
U.S. universities surveyed were
awarded 2.239 patents in fiscal 1997.
Those institutions reported a total of
5,659 income-producing licenses and
options to license that year, about 700
more than in 1996, according the the
C hronicle of Higher Education.
Stanford's Office for Licensing
and Technology works to facilitate
income through patents.
It aims to "promote the transfer of
Stanford technology for society's use
and benefit, while generating unre
stricted income to support research
and education," according to Niels
Reimer, who founded the office in
1970.
The OLT receives invention pro
posals and decides whether or not to
patent them. Net royalties are split
between the University, the depart
ment and the inventor after the office

deducts its share.
Stanford has experienced sundry
benefits in the form of royalties from
patents on innovations ranging from
recombinant DNA technology to
computer imaging technology.
DNA patents have earned more
than $200 million in royalties for the
University, even though Stanford
shared the revenue with IJC-San
Francisco.
Part of those revenues con
tributed to an all-time high from
patents, $61.2 million, in fiscal 1998.
According to OLT Director
Katharine Ku, the dramatic increase
can be attributed to increased inven
tion and a one-time equity liquida
tion.
During that fiscal year, however,
some of the University's most lucra
tive DNA patents expired, which has
sent subsequent revenues down, ac
cording to Ku.
"We are expecting a dramatic de
crease in revenue for fiscal year '99,"
Ku said.

"We are hoping to get $25 million
for '99," but we might get as little as
$18 million, but "then we expect it
will go up," she said.
Ku and other Stanford adminis
trators are confident in Stanford's
continuing ability to remain at the top
of the list in terms of royalty earnings.
"My sense is that with the entre
preneurial faculty that we have there
are always interesting inventions in
the pipeline," said Michael Roster,
the University's general counsel.
Special Counsel for Industry Re
lations James Gibbons, a former
Dean of Engineering, has been look
ing at relationships with industry,
searching for more educational and
research opportunities.
One possible successor to the
DNA patents may be a set of com
puter music technologies.
Regardless of expiring patents,
Stanford is expected to keep up its
high level of new ideas and inven
tions and income from royalties and
patents.
