In a world where research results have become mar
ketable commodities, research universities have come
to rely on a steady income flow from patents and inven
tions.
Research universities all over the United States have
seen a 33 percent increase in patent revenues over 1996,
according to an annual survey released last month by
the Association of University Technology Managers.
Stanford placed third in amount earned among U.S.
universities, with a reported $34 million from royalties
and inventions in fiscal 1997.
The University of California system was the top
earner at $61.3 million, followed by Columbia Univer
sity at $46.1 million.
