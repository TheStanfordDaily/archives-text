Last year was a "laboratory year"
for thinking about management in a
changing global environment, said
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the
Haas School of Business at UC-
Berkeley at a lecture Friday.
Tyson, who is former head of
President Clinton's Council of Eco
nomic Advisors, spoke on the impli
cations of recent global economic de
velopments for business school grad
uates. About SO students and faculty
members attended the talk at Bishop
Auditorium.
Addressing the phenomenon of
continued American economic
growth amid a series of economic
crises in Asia and Europe, Tyson ar
gued that U.S. markets are not iso
lated from global economic trends.
Tyson echoed Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan in her
claim that the United States and
parts of Europe cannot remain
"oases of prosperity" when one
third of the world's economies, in
cluding East Asia, Brazil and
Malaysia, are still hurting.
Tyson called the global economic

downturn a "contagion" that has
"engulfed emerging markets," with
ripple effects felt in trade and finan
cial markets.
" The world has become a very in
terdependent place," Tyson added.
In light of recent developments,
such as Russia's inability to meet its
repayment commitments, Tyson
asked, "What kinds of strategies do
we have to put in place to continue
the How of private capital from ...
the 'center' to the periphery?"
Tyson said the boldest suggestion
for preventing similar economic
problems from recurring is to create
a global central bank, which would
involve the creation of a global cur
rency.
A less extreme plan, however,
might include common bank regula
tion standards and more "SEC-type
requirements," Tyson said.
For those who contend that the
worse is over, Tyson cautioned that
we should learn how sudden change
can be.
"No one predicted [the crisis)
would engulf Russia," she said.
Tyson refuted the claim that glob
al agencies such as the International
Monetary Fund serve to destabilize

emerging market economies.
The argument behind the claim is
that by ensuring a bailout for failed
investments, the IMF creates incen
tives for investors to take on risky
ventures they might otherwise avoid.
This phenomenon is called a "moral
hazard."
"I don't think the facts support
this [claim]," Tyson said, noting that
many investors have been "badly
burned" by failed investments.
Despite its "theoretical merit,"
the moral hazard argument is a gen
eral argument against insurance and
is not as convincing when applied to
the IMF, Tyson argued.
Few investors plan their invest
ment strategy around the idea that
the IMF will bail them out, she said.
Unlike previous economic crises,
recent crises have developed despite
governments following responsible
policies.
This reflects the largely unpre
dictable nature of an interdepen
dent, global economy, Tyson sug
gested.
Faced with such volatility, Tyson
said that business professors must
strive to bring an international per
spective to their courses.
