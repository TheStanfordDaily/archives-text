# Republicans say Senate trial requires witnesses

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
impeachment trial of President
Clinton stirred strategists from both
political parties yesterday, with
Republicans pressing to hear testi
mony from Monica Lewinsky and
other witnesses, and the White
House responding to public opinion
and urging an early dismissal.
"It seems to me it is hard to have
a trial without witnesses," Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, R-lJtah, said. If House
prosecutors say they need live testi

mony, "It's going to be pretty hard
for senators to vote against it."
Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
warned that the witness problem
could destroy the Senate's fragile
mood of cooperation. "We are in a
bipartisan mode for the opening
kickoff, halftime is questionable
and if we go into overtime, all bets
are off," Breaux said.
Other Democrats said testimony
could unnecessarily prolong the
trial.
Meanwhile, White House

spokesman Jim Kennedy said Clin
ton plans to deliver the State of the
Union speech as scheduled Jan. 19,
even though the trial will be under
way. "We have no intention of
being diverted from that," he said.
House Republicans among the
13 who will prosecute the two arti
cles of impeachment facing Clintou
pressed for the right to call witness
es. They put Lewinsky, the former
White House intern whose affair
with Clinton triggered the case, at
the top of the list.
