Community criticism of
Stanford overlooks real
crises and academic mission

NO ONE DISPUTES that Stanford
has been a crucial factor in the
development of neighboring com
munities. The University is a landlord of
massive proportions, and any discussion of
land-use planning in this area is going to cir
cle back to what Stanford will do with its
land.
At present, Stanford's plans for its land
involve some heavy expansion, which
inevitably generates considerable contro
versy. In recent years, Stanford has seldom
been able to build much of anything with
out arousing critics in the surrounding com
munities.
While we are not advocating that the
University be free from local oversight, we
feel that the developments the I Jniversity is
now considering are clearly necessary, and
that many of the criticisms leveled at Stan
ford display a remarkable lack of perspec
tive.
Attacks on the University's develop
ment policy generally assert that Stanford is
not doing enough to ensure the survival of
the thousands of acres of open space it
owns, and that it fails to keep the public
properly informed of its future develop
ment plans and their potential impact on
surrounding communities.
As to the question of open spaces, we
cannot see why Stanford comes in for local
criticism from communities that are much
more densely built than any area of the
Stanford campus. A cursory examination of
a map will show that the towns of Wood
side, Menlo Park and Los Altos Hills are
developed almost right up to the edge of
Interstate 280. Stanford's land in the
Foothills represents by far the largest break
in that development, and if it were not Stan
ford land, it would probably be expensive
subdivisions by now.
Many local organizations and some local
politicians have called on Stanford to agree
never to build on its open space. The Uni
versity, ever attached to flexibility in its

future plans, does not wish to close off that
possibility.
We certainly hope that the Foothills will
remain intact for future generations to
admire. We also realize that if the Stanfords
had wanted to set up their land as a park,
they would have done so. Instead, they set
it up as a university, with goals that are
above all academic.
It is hard for us to imagine what aca
demic concerns would push the University
to build in the Foothills. They would have
to stem from the most extreme of needs. It
is unfair of surrounding cities to expect
Stanford to shoulder an additional burden
of conservation when Stanford has already
kept more space open than any of those
cities.
It is always unfortunate when local resi
dents come to see Stanford as a pushy
neighbor. However, Stanford is anything
but free of restraint when it comes to its
building plans.
The University's development over the
past decade has taken place along the lines
set down in a plan that was public through
out. While recent plans for increased hous
ing have appeared very suddenly and were
not part of the overall plan, they are a
response to a very real crisis.
Both faculty and graduate student
recruitment suffer from the difficulties of
the local housing market. This has a very
immediate effect for academics here: one
professor turning down Stanford because
he or she can't afford to live here consider
ably affects the future of a given depart
ment.
Politicians who criticize Stanford's
development strategy might consider that
the rapid growth of Silicon Valley commu
nities has driven rents up to where a back
bedroom of someone's house can cost $650
a month. The effect of Stanford's growth on
nearby towns is only one half of a two-way
relationship.
Real problems have accompanied the
high rate of growth of this whole part of the
Peninsula, Stanford included. 1 lowever, we
do not feel that any of those problems is to
be solved by imposing restrictions that
would throw unnecessary obstacles in the
path of needed responses to real crises at
Stanford.
