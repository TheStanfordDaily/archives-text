## What does your hair say about you? 
### 
£ y THINK I'VE been
I a long-haired per-
trapped in a
short-haired person's
body." I said to my friend.
I'm not exactly sure what
that meant, but I'd just
walked into a salon, put a

couple of feet of my hair into a ponytail and
had it cut off. Perhaps I recognized that hair
is not just a bunch of dead cells; there's a lot
of psychological, cultural, and anthropologi
cal meaning about identity attached to hair.
This summer I worked on a museum
exhibit about images of the body, the cultur
al component of a project on the biology of
the human body. Amassing images and
information from a variety of media sources,
I noticed that hair makes a personal state
ment in a number of arenas. Consider a few
things before changing hairstyles.
Historical Hair Joan of Arc cut hers to
masquerade as a man and become eligible
for military service. Rapunzel dropped hers
from a tower to be rescued by a charming
prince. European women wore towering
wigs, fashionable for the time, but prone to
invasion by bugs, birds and small rodents.
Political Hair: Hippies' long hair, punk
mohawks and afros have been worn in defi
ance of the cultural norm.
Religious I lain Buddhist monks shave it
to the skull. Rastafarians dred it. Hasidic
Jews dangle a curly lock from each ear.
Catholic nuns cover it with a black and white
habit.

Status Hair: A military buzz cut or a neo-
Nazi's skinhead indicate membership in a
particular group. Hopi women of the south
west traditionally wear two styles to indicate
marital status.
I read a book called "Big Hair," an
anthropological study of American women
and their hair. Hair says a lot about the
wearer's personality. I learned about what
the different shades of blonde — from
sunny to bombshell — project to others. 1
considered the culture of doing hair, the
social relationships that form among hair
dressers and clients in chatty salons, or
between mothers and daughters getting
their hair braided every day before school.
You've got opinions about hair. You've
got feelings about receding hairlines, or hair
on the chest, armpits and legs. And you
react when hair changes. Don't tell me it's
not a little shocking to walk into the bath
room to see a pile of hair on the floor and
one friend with clippers to another's head.
1 talked to a bunch of women about cut
ting their hair, going from at least a foot of it
to, in some cases, about a quarter inch. We
talked about why they did it and what it
meant to them. It turns out that hairstyle
change is a lot about testing control of your
identity.
One friend told me that everyone saw her
long hair as an integral part of her identity.
Whenever she suggested cutting it, people
jumped to protest. "It seemed like everyone
else was more attached to it than I was," she
said. When she ended up going through with

it a week before college graduation, she ran
to a friend's room and told her to cut it
before anyone came and stopped them.
Another friend cut her hair after feeling
an urge to assert herself more when making
choices. The resulting hairstyle was less
important than the act itself.
Yet another friend wondered what would
happen if she removed what she saw as one
of her most attractive physical features. Her
mom, nervous hut excited, agreed to cut her
long hair and then shave her head. Her dad
and brother discouraged her with comments
like, "So, you don't want to have any dates
for the next six months?" She later noticed a
definite change in the way she viewed her
attractiveness as a woman and admitted
feeling asexual.
So why'd I do it? A breakup with a sig
nificant other? A new job? The influence of
pop culture and too many check-out line
Vogue magazines?
Maybe I was tired of waiting for a life
changing event to trigger the haircut and
finally decided to see if a haircut could trig
ger one of life's monumental events. No
event yet, but I can relate to my friend's
insight. As she said, "I felt like 1 was hiding
behind my hair. And now, when you look at
me, you see less hair and more me."

Rachel Hutton, a senior majoring in product
design, just shaved her legs to go to her
cousin s wedding. She liadn 7 done that since
the senior prom.
