Shakespeare is number one
The polled British public has chosen
Shakespeare as the "man of the millenni
um" (hooray!), but some scientists object.
They'd preferred Newton or Darwin. But it
is an easy bet that those worthies would
have pone for Shakespeare tin), which is
largely why they are extraordinary. They
surely believed in the sacred, as did Ein
stein: "Science without religion is lame." Or
Pascal: "The heart has its reasons which
reason does not know." Or the jolly doctor
Rabelais: "Science without conscience is the
ruin of the soul."
A bit of common sense should have told
the uninspired objectors that the various
appendages — mind, hand, tail — are less
than the whole (heart, the soul) which cre
ative genius like Shakespeare's approaches
persuasively for the ages.

But since our universities no longer
know this home truth, or care about it — so
Shakespeare and his spiritual kin are
marginalized behind the ivy walls — it is
hard to blame the scientists for their tunnel
vision.

Revamp the Constitution
One of the most informative and delight
ful TV programs 1 have ever seen was C-
Span's "A Profile of Chief Justice Relin
quish" which traced his career through
extracts from his speeches with comments
by David Savage, Supreme Court corre
spondent of The Los Angeles Times.
In court, the Chief Justice comes across
as a befittingly august figure, but in this

biography we see him as a bright, well-read,
witty and charming person. Stanford Uni
versity should be especially proud since he
is a graduate, as is another Justice, Sandra
Day O'Connor, his 1952 Law School class
mate.
L.ike most people. I am uneasy about the
Clinton trial, but for unusual reasons. It is
the Supreme Court's task to interpret the
Constitution and "original intent." Yet I am
tired of history professors belaboring that
issue, poring like cabalists over the Torah,
without ever realizing that the U.S. Consti
tution, like others, has flaws, indeed con
spicuous ones.
The worst is "from that to this," "this"
being the dignity of the Senate proceedings,
"that" being the political conventions which
start the cycle. These mob scenes of dele
gates yelling and waving signs are worse
than soccer matches, and the intellectual
content is about that of the balloons

released at the victory of the people's
choice. There is no other Western country
in which choices are made like this, and the
result is the present trial of Clinton. To
overhaul the American Constitution is
imperative.
My second concern is that, despite all
the talk of original intent, there is one mis
interpretation of which even Chief Justice
Rehnquist seems unaware. He rightly
stressed the difference between a written
and an oral presentation, but then he read
the expression "High crimes and misde
meanors" as though "high" referred to
both. It does not.
There is no such thing as a "high misde
meanor." It is a contradiction in terms. The
result of the trial may depend on Justice
Rehnquist's voice.
