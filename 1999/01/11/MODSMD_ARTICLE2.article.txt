# Morris to take associate dean position
## 
### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
With the beginning of the new
year, the School ol Humanities and
Sciences gained a new associate dean
for humanities: Classics Prof. Lan
Morris.
Morris has served as chair of the
Classics Department since 19%, and

also holds an appointment in the History Department.
He was "surprised but honored" when he learned he
had been named associate dean. He replaces Political
Science Prof. David Holloway.
An advisory committee, which consisted of Profs.
Keith Baker. Wanda Corn, Seth Lerer, and Stnnley
Peters, aided Dean of Humanities and Sciences Mal
colm Beasley in choosing Morris.
"Names of possible candidates came from both the
humanities faculty and from the advisory group itself
â€” all of whom I declared candidates on mv own."


Morris
Beasley said. "I thought [the adviso
ry group] did a first-rate job."
Though just recruited from the
University of Chicago in 1995, Mor
ris has served in a number of other
roles at Stanford, including posi
tions on the board of directors of the
Social Science History Institute and
the Area One Coordinating Com
mittee.
Morris, an internationally recog
nized authority in Greek history and
archaeology who has authored or
edited six books, as well as teaching
in the new Introduction to the Hu
manities program, came highly rec
ommended for the position by
many, Beasley said.
"Morris is a respected scholar
and was an excellent department
chair," he said. "He demonstrated
outstanding leadership and judg
ment in the recent renewal of the
Classics Department, and he is well
liked by his colleagues in the hu
manities."
Now, Morris will face the task of
representing the largest sector of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
"The main responsibility is coor
dinating the actions of about 15 hu

manities departments, which in
clude several hundred faculty and
lecturers," he said. "Humanities
also has more than 30 faculty search
es open or offers currently out, so
there's a lot of business to transact."
Morris said he will "need to
spend the first few weeks just learn
ing the ropes and figuring out how
things get done," but that he will get
the chance to contribute to a large
amount of effort that has gone into
fortifying the School of Humanities
and Sciences over the past few years.
"President Casper, Provost Rice,
and Deans Shoven and Beasley
have done a tremendous job
strengthening the humanities at
Stanford," he said. "They're all com
mitted to seeing this effort continue,
and I'm going to do everything I can
to help."
Growth will continue in the Clas
sics Department as well, Morris
added, building upon his work as de
partment chair.
"The main change in that time
[since 1996] has been the establish
ment of archaeology in classics on a
strong footing, with the appoint
ment of Michael Shanks, who's
coming here this month, two more
tenure-line faculty positions which
we'll fill next year, and a post-doc
toral fellowship," he said.

The humanities division will in
volve itself with other departments,
working together with, them to en
courage new growth and opportuni
ties, Morris said.
Though he has had many memo
rable experiences and achieve
ments, Morris attributes some of his
best memories to time spent work
ing in the classroom.
"The most fun I've had here as a
professor has been teaching in Area
One, in History 1 last year, and the
Ancient Mediterranean World last
year and this year," he said.
"I've had great students and have
worked with outstanding teaching
fellows."
Students speak highly of Morris's
ability in the lecture hall.
"He's an incredible teacher,"
sophomore Alexis Kaminsky said.
"His lectures are never boring, and
always really fascinating. They al
ways have the power to grip you.
He's really engaging and makes you
feel like he's talking to a small
group, not a class of 200."
Freshman Elita Cheung echoed
her sentiments.
"Morris was a guest lecturer in
my Great Works class," she said.
"He was a wonderful speaker, defi
nitely one of the best I've heard
while here at Stanford."
