With the beginning of the new
year, the School ol Humanities and
Sciences gained a new associate dean
for humanities: Classics Prof. Lan

Morris has served as chair of the
Classics Department since 19%, and

also holds an appointment in the History Department.
He was "surprised but honored" when he learned he
had been named associate dean. He replaces Political
Science Prof. David Holloway.
An advisory committee, which consisted of Profs.
Keith Baker. Wanda Corn, Seth Lerer, and Stnnley
Peters, aided Dean of Humanities and Sciences Mal

"Names of possible candidates came from both the
humanities faculty and from the advisory group itself
â€” all of whom I declared candidates on mv own."
