# Where We Are

THE SUPER BOWL will be played
on Jan. 31, and I can already hear
the enthusiastic cries: "Hey, isn't
that during midterm week? Meet you at
Meyer!"
It's no secret that professional sports,
including NFL football, have about as
much appeal on this campus as a gigantic
cold sore, but it always surprises me when
1 go down to our television room on a
playoff weekend and find some friendly —
albeit clueless — residents watching car
toons. Last year, I was the only one in my
house watching the Super Bowl until oth
ers realized that the world championship
showcased not only spectacular play but
also commercials featuring supermodels
who drink huge vats of diet cola. The final
score: Football Fans, 0, Cindy Crawford,
28.
I don't think people's lack of interest in
football stems so much from the game
itself — who among us doesn't want to see
socially sanctioned violence against a
punter? — but rather the announcers.
These are the ex-players who were not tal
ented or handsome enough to make

enough money to retire and play golf for
rest of their lives, but now must offer up
such expert analysis as, "The only way the
Packers will win this game is if they score
more points than their opponent. And, of
course, remain breathing."
It's not so much that these boneheaded
comments ruin the spectator experience,
but that they set in motion a running game
of "Let's be Even More Boneheaded than
the Announcers if that's Humanly Possi
ble." This game usually involves three
guys stuffed up on Doritos and Pepsi who
sit in the back of the dorm lounge, make
loud and sexually charged jokes about the
telestrator and the quarterback's Deep
Drop, and then high-five each other so
obnoxiously that everyone else has no
choice but to leave the room. The game is
usually played in freshman dorms. Fortu
nately, its popularity often diminishes
once maturity is reached.
As for myself, I can't get enough of
football. I usually take pride in my conver
sational skills, but I constantly find myself
interjecting useless football facts during
dinner-table discussions. "Did you know

that two of the Dolphins' starting defen
sive linemen are on the injured list this
week?" I ask, more often than not
these days, to an empty table. Sometimes I
won't even notice that everyone has
deserted me, especially if I see that the
green beans on my plate have sponta
neously dropped into zone coverage of my
chicken.
My fascination with football has devel
oped from my long history with the game.
It's not that I played in high school, even
though we had such a dominant team that
the athletic department felt it necessary to
section off a part of the locker room from
us feeble mortals and call it the Panther
Pen or Panther Playhouse or something
like that. We often won our division,
which only meant that the rich white guys
on our team were less pathetic than the
rest of the rich white guys in the league.
Because when we reached the playoffs
against much larger teams, teams whose
players could easily pass for Hoover
Tower, the Panther Playhouse provided a
much-needed hiding place.
Nevertheless, 1 did play football once in

my life, for the fifth-grade Pop Warner
Mustangs. We were a truly amazing team,
meaning that we had both home and away
jerseys — quite a feat for nine-year-olds.
And current Denver Broncos head coach
Mike Shanahan, whose son was our third
string quarterback, occasionally contribut
ed to our playbook. So when you see John
Elway pitch it back to Terrell Davis in the
playoffs this year, know that his inspira
tion came from red-and-black clad pre
pubescents who often ran in the direction
of their own end zone.
I too wanted to play quarterback, and
my best friend at the time, who happened
to be the head coach's son, said that my
chances were good. This, of course, was
before the coaches witnessed my less
than-blazing speed, which has been
described like a Porsche's if its gear shift
were in neutral. Let's just say that any
future health problems I may incur proba
bly will be the result of too many wind
sprints in shoulder pads.
After a rigorous preseason, I was made
left offensive tackle. Excuse me, starting
left offensive tackle.

In the whole scope of things, my contri
bution was at best minimal, but neverthe
less we made it to the regional champi
onships. We were leading midway through
the game, but then the other team pulled a
brilliant strategic maneuver in which the
coaches switched the jerseys of their best
player with a so-so player at half-time, and
we spent the entire second half keying in
on number 25 when the real number 25,
who now wore number 42, ran through our
defense like an electric mower through
Kleenex.
We lost and were all very sad; some
boys even cried. But then we went out for
pizza and everything was okay.
I don't exactly remember which kind of
pizza, but I'm sure there will be a conl
mercial for a similar type during this year's
Super Bowl.

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, predicts that whichever team is
stronger, faster and smarter at the end of the
season will win the Super Bowl. He realizes
he's going out on a limb, but he's always
been a risk taker.

onships. We were leading midway through
the game, but then the other team pulled a
brilliant strategic maneuver in which the
coaches switched the jerseys of their best
player with a so-so player at half-time, and
we spent the entire second half keying in
on number 25 when the real number 25,
who now wore number 42, ran through our
defense like an electric mower through
Kleenex.
We lost and were all very sad; some
boys even cried. But then we went out for
pizza and everything was okay.
I don't exactly remember which kind of
pizza, but I'm sure there will be a conl
mercial for a similar type during this year's
Super Bowl.

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, predicts that whichever team is
stronger, faster and smarter at the end of the
season will win the Super Bowl. He realizes
he's going out on a limb, but he's always
been a risk taker.
