As if losing to Stanford was not

bad enough, the backcourt tandem
sat in the media room to answer a
long series of questions about the
enemy.
Not a single question was asked
about the Golden Bears themselves;
only of their opinions on this ye ir's
Stanford squad. Carlisle and Kiigo

praise on the Cardinal.

them because they came out and
scrambled and did the things they
needed to do to win," Carlisle said.
"It was their night tonight."
At the end of the first half, how
ever. things did not look so bright
for the Cardinal. Carlisle hit a long
three-pointer from the top of the
key to give the Bears a 30-28 half
time lead.
