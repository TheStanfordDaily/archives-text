### Will Flemming Staff writer 
For California, this has got to be
getting very old.
First it was football, where the
Stanford Cardinal defeated the
Golden Bears in the Big Game,
keeping the Axe and dashing any
hopes of a bowl berth.

MEW'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 4 Stanford (13-2
overall, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
71. California (10-3, 1-2) 62.

And now Saturday evening, it
was men's basketball. The fourth
ranked Cardinal (13-2,3-0 Pacific 10
Conference) rode a dominating
team effort in the second half to de
feat then No. 25 Cal (10-3, 1-2) at
Maples Pavilion, 71-62.
The win was the ninth straight for
Stanford and allowed the Cardinal
to maintain its one-game confer
ence lead through two weeks of
Pac-10 play.
Following the game, the looks on
the faces of Cal stars Geno Carlisle
and Thomas Kilgore echoed their
frustration after a sixth-straight loss
at Maples.
As if losing to Stanford was not

bad enough, the backcourt tandem
sat in the media room to answer a
long series of questions about the
enemy.
Not a single question was asked
about the Golden Bears themselves;
only of their opinions on this ye ir's
Stanford squad. Carlisle and Kiigo
re were gracious enough to heap
praise on the Cardinal.
"You have to tip your hat off to
them because they came out and
scrambled and did the things they
needed to do to win," Carlisle said.
"It was their night tonight."
At the end of the first half, how
ever. things did not look so bright
for the Cardinal. Carlisle hit a long
three-pointer from the top of the
key to give the Bears a 30-28 half
time lead.
The second half was a complete
ly different story. After giving up
another Cal basket, Stanford scored
seven straight points to go up 35-32.
The Bears would never lead again.

Cardinal up 60-47. Cal scored seven

kill the Bears' chances.
While Stanford shot 57 percent
from the field in the second half and
showed great offensive confidence,
its defensive pressure on Carlisle
was the real key to victory.
The Bears' leading scorer, who
came into the game averaging 18.4
points per game, mustered only 14
points due to the suffocating tag
team defensive effort hy Arthur Lee
and Weems.
"That was the toughest defense
I've faced all year," Carlisle said. "It
was difficult to score. They tried to
keep the ball out of my hands, and
when I got it they crammed me."
Cal head coach Ben Braun felt
that Carlisle tried to do too much
against the Stanford defense, forc
ing shots and taking the Bears out of
the How of their offense.
"Cieno forced the action for us

and didn't need to," Braun said.
"Some of the plays he made at the
beginning of the shot clock were like
[plays that should be run] at the end
of the shot clock."
Kilgore did his best to pick up the
offensive slack for the Bears, scoring
a career-high 21 points and grabbing
eight rebounds.
For Stanford, Weems led the way
with 15 points, while Peter Sauer
added 13 and Lee 11, nine of which
came in the second half.
"With a balanced team like we
have, you have to take what they are
giving to you," Sauer said. "We are
not always going to be real flashy.
We wear away at teams. We've got
guys that have been there before.
That makes it a lot easier to make
plays."
If there was one sore spot for
Stanford, it was its free-throw shoot
ing.
The Cardinal missed more than
half of its attempts from the charity
stripe against Cal.
For California, this has got to be
getting very old.
