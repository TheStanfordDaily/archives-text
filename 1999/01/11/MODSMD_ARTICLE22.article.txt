# Outside game is key to conference
## 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Despite the Cardinal's im
mense size inside the paint, Satur
day night's 71-62 victory against
California at Maples Pavilion was
a strong reminder that in the up
tempo Pacific 10 Conference,
guardplay is going to be the key to
victory.
Few teams in the conference
would try to outmuscle the Cardi
nal. Thus, it seems that the only,
and the most common, strategy
for opponents is to neutralize the
inside game and force Stanford to
knock down its shots from out
side.
Fortunately for Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery, his
team was able to do just that this
weekend.
After the Cardinal's starting
guard tandem of seniors Arthur
Lee and Kris Weems combined
for just five points in the first half,
Stanford found itself trailing the
Bears by two, 30-28, at intermis
sion.
By comparison, Cal guards
Geno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgo

re put together an 18-point perfor
mance, while the rest of the Bears,
as well as the Cardinal's pathetic
free-throw shooting, kept Stan
ford's inside game from blowing
the match open.
"We knew that Carlisle and
Kilgore were the keys," Mont
gomery said.
"It's a great advantage to have
a player, much less two, that can
take you off the dribble and get
the kinds of shots they want," he
added.
"Carlisle can just jump over
you. In the first half we allowed
him to get the ball too close to the
basket and just one dribble put
him in a shooting situation."
The Cardinal tried to counter
by switching the defense and hav
ing Weems defend Carlisle, which
proved to be successful.
Carlisle finished with 14 points,
but only made six shots on 19 at
tempts.
Meanwhile, Lee and Weems
combined for 21 points in the sec
ond half.
"That's the toughest defense I
faced this year," Carlisle said.
"They came out and focused on
me and defended off the dribble.
But that opened Tom up a lot.
"I played the same [as I do in
other games]. They came out and
tried to take the ball out of my
hands. The shots I took tonight I
usually make, but they just came up
short tonight."
The matchup against Carlisle
and Kilgore. both normally prolific
shooters, comes at a perfect time to
prepare the Cardinal, as it travels
to Los Angeles this weekend for a
couple of big games.
UCLA, Saturday's opponent,
features sophomore guards Baron
Davis and Earl Watson as its start
ing duo. Davis and Watson are per
haps the most explosive backcourt
pair in the conference and will be a
challenging matchup for Lee and

Weems.
And though high-speed guards
abound throughout the confer
ence, Cal and UCLA are the only
other schools that feature two po
tential all-conference players in
their starting backcourt.
"I knew [Carlisle] was going to
come out and shoot as many shots
as he could," Lee said.
"They're aggressive and he's a
really good scorer. It's tough
guarding a guy like that. He goes to
the basket hard and can shoot the
leap shots," he added. "But I
thought we did a pretty good job
even though they both scored in
double figures."*
With only two weekends gone in
the conference season, the Cardi
nal is already the only team un
beaten in league play and has solid
ified its status as the Pac-lOteam to
beat. It has also shown that as with
every other team in the conference,
its ultimate success lies outside the
key.
