# Outside game is key to conference

Despite the Cardinal's im

day night's 71-62 victory against
California at Maples Pavilion was
a strong reminder that in the up

Few teams in the conference

proved to be successful.
Carlisle finished with 14 points,
but only made six shots on 19 at
tempts.
Meanwhile, Lee and Weems
combined for 21 points in the sec
