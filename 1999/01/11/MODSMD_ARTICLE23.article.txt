### Chad Morse 
The Cardinal drifted into hostile
waters this weekend as the top
ranked women's swimming and div
ing teams were dealt a stunning de
feat by the hosting N0.2 Georgia
Bulldogs (5-0) on Saturday.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: No. 2 Georgia (5-0) 187,
No. 1 Stanford (3-1)113.
Friday: Stanford 171, No. 7 Auburn
(1-3) 129.

The wake-up call came shortly
after Stanford (3-1) cruised past No.
7 Auburn (1 -3) on Friday.
Georgia dominated the Saturday
affair, taking first place in 11 of 16
events and winning the meet by a
score of 187-113. The Lady Bulldogs
clearly rose to the challenge of lac
ing the nation's top swimming and
diving squad, as a number of Geor
gia swimmers made significant sea
sonal time drops.
Furthermore, the talented No. 2
squad did not fail to capitalize on a
Stanford team that was missing two
■if its top swimmers and appeared
tii ul after Friday's duel with
Auburn.
J jniors Kristy Kowal and Court
ney Shealy set the pace for the Bull
dogs with three individual wins
apie :e. Kowal, the reigning NCAA
100-yard breastroke champ, cap
tured first place finishes in the 100-
and 200-yard breastroke (1:00.87,

-2:12.42) and the 200-yard individual
medley (2:02.62). Shealy took the
50- and 100-yard freestyle (23.03.
50.60) and the 100-yard baekstroke
(54.67).
Sophomore Misty Hyman turned
in three impressive swims for the
Cardinal, taking both the KM)- and
200-yard butterfly (55.09, 1:59.80)
and placing second to Georgia's
Amanda Adkins in the 200-yard
backstroke. Hyman's 2(H) fly time
eclipsed the old pool record by 1/100
of a second.
Uncharacteristically, the Cardi
nal's primary problem in the Geor
gia meet seemed to be a lack of
depth. With Catherine Fox and
Sylvia Bereknyei out of the lineup,

due to illness and injury respectively,
and other key swimmers off of their
seasonal bests, Stanford found itself
scrambling for top-three finishes.

places in every swimming event ex
cept for the 100-yard butterfly,
where Stanford's Jessica Amey
placed second behind Uyman.
The Cardinal divers did not have
the same problem. Kim Powers,
Carissa Zenorini and Erin Sones

diving contingent. I lie trio all placed

was a much more typical Stanford
outing. The Cardinal routed the

help of Fox or Bereknyei.
Stanford was victorious in 11
events, with junior Gabrielle Rose
contributing three wins for the Car
dinal.
Rose, who has been pivotal to the
team's success this year, took the
1(X)- and 200-yard freestyle (50.08,
1:47.86) and the grueling 4(X)-yard
individual medley (4:21.41).
Freshman Jessica Foschi cap
tured the distance freestyle events,
posting times of 4:49.74 and

10:01.60 in the 500 and 1000, re
spectively.
Fellow Stanford freshman Whit
ney Leatherwood snatched the 100-
yard breast from senior Elin
Austevoll with an impressive time of
1:01.64. Later in the meet, Austevoll
went on to capture the 200-yard
breastroke (2:13.74).
The Stanford diving squad was
on once again as they trounced the
Auburn competition. The Cardinal
swept the top three spots of the
three-meter competition. Sopho
more Powers won the event
(316.42), followed by Zenorini and
Sones. In the one-meter competi
tion, Zenorini showed her prowess
with 183.05 points and a narrow vic
tory over Auburn's Jennifer
Reynolds. Powers placed third in
the event and Sones took fourth.
The Cardinal will travel to Ari
zona before returning to Stanford
for the final two dual meets of the
season. Six dual meets remain be
