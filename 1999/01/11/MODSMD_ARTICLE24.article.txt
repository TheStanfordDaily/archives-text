# Not the prettiest of games
## Stanford holds off Cal Bears in conference home opener 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
At least this loss will bring down the average margin of
defeat for the California Golden Bears.
Stanford, which had won its last four meetings against
Cal at Maples Pavilion by an average of 42.2 points going
into Friday night's game, once again struggled to put to
gether a complete game on both ends of the court, miss
ing free throws and failing to get back on defense during
key stretches. The Cardinal, however, was still able to
come away with an 80-67 victory over Cal in the team's
Pacific 10 Conference home opener.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Friday: Stanford (6-8 overall, 2-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
.SO, California (6-6,0-3) 67.

While the Golden Bears (6-6,0-3 Pac-10) only lost by
13 points — a far cry from recent back-to-back 51 -point
defeats —California head coach Marianne Stanley was in
no mood for moral victories on this evening, harping in
stead on her team's inability to rebound effectively.
When someone in the postgame news conference point
ed out to her that her team was only out-rebounded by 43-
40. Stanley was quick to answer.
"Their first shot didn't hurt us," Stanley said. "It was all
the putbacks. We were letting them get two, three, four —
did somebody say five? I low many do you need? Our
goal the rest of the season is to be the best rebounding
team in the league. II we do that, we're going to solve a lot
of our problems."
Of course, Stanford (b-K, 2-1) also played a part in
Cal's inability to control the boards. Cardinal freshman
forward Bethany Donaphin crashed the boards for 14 re
bounds, including a remarkable nine on the offensive
glass. I ler hustle kept several possessions alive and
opened up more opportunities for sophomore forward
Sarah Dimson (16 points on 7-of-l 1 shooting) and sopho
more center Carolyn Moos (a game-high 17 points to go

with six rebounds).
Donaphin "doesn't make a lot of mistakes," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "She's been coming
on so strong lately, that we need to mix her up in the of
fense and really get her playing. The offensive rebound
ing she gives us is contagious."
Dimson added that being aggressive "starts in practice
and when you get to the game, it's not so hard to be ag
gressive however long you're out there. I think it's impor
tant to be aggressive because it creates offense, it gets the
team going and it does so many things that will be a ben
efit to the team."
Meanwhile, junior point guard Milena Flores missed
all eight of her shots, including all five from three-point
land, although she did dish out 1 0 assists. Freshman guard
Lindsey Yamasaki picked up the offensive slack on the
perimeter, scoring 16 points.
But despite the strong offensive showings of several
Stanford players, there was still plenty to make the crowd
of 5,572 at Maples antsy for most of the evening.
Aside from a two-minute stretch to start the second
half, when Stanford went on a 10-0 run to stretch a 38-31
halftime advantage to its biggest lead of the game, the
Cardinal struggled to put Cal away. Stanford's transition
defense suffered a letdown in the second half, allowing
the Bears to claw back to within 62-55 with 5 minutes, 58
seconds to go in the contest. Also, despite the foul-fest
that Cal put on (28 personal fouls, with three players foul
ing out). Stanford missed 14 of its 42 free-throw attempts,
although the number of free throws was still enough to
alarm Stanley.
"42 free throws?" Stanley said, with a touch of exas
peration. "It's been a long time since I've seen anybody
shoot 42 free throws. How long did the game take, about
five hours? What time is it. about 2 a.m.?"
Despite getting back on the winning track in Pac-10
play, this performance does not bode well for the Cardi
nal's immediate future.
No. 10 UCLA, which is heavily favored to win the con-
ference title, comes to town Saturday
night. While many observers have
been quick to point out that the Car
dinal is a young team going through a

murderous schedule, it still has to be
exasperating for VanDerveer to see
her team continue to make the same
mistakes.
"We're always in search of a per
fect game," VanDerveer said. "We
definitely see things we can do bet
ter."
