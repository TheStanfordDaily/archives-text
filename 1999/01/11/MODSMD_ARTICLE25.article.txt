The motivation was definitely there for Stanford after
suffering an embarrassing loss to Davis last year.
"Losing to Davis last year was the lowest point of last
season." said junior Warren McPherson. "We definitely
had the motivation to pick up our intensity."
Cardinal coach Chris Horpel echoed the importance
of the rivalry with Davis.
"They are the only other Division I program in the
Bay Area. This is our 'Big Game' and it is for bragging
rights, so we were fired up." Horpel said.
A random draw started the match at 157 pounds in

which senior captain Beau Weiner was pitted against
freshman Burt Pierson, who leads the Aggies with IS
wins.
Weiner's calculating style led to great shots, but only
yielded one single-leg takedown in the first period. Wein
er's scored a takedown and an escape to lead 5-1 after two
periods. He controlled throughout the third period to
post the win. 7-2.
"Weiner is one of our best wrestlers and it is important
for him to lead off with a win," 1 lorpel said. "We needed
a winning start to gain momentum for the rest of the
dual."
McPherson (165) continued the winning streak with a
convincing 13-3 win over Davis sophomore Bret Friend.
The key to the win was McPherson's relentless, ag
gressive style that resulted in great shots and a couple of
impressive front headlocks and high-crotch takedowns.
McPherson also rode well with his legs, applying pressure
throughout the match, but was unable to turn or pin
Friend.
"I was looking for the pin and he was only looking to
not get pinned," McPherson said. "I knew that I could
beat him on my feet, but I have to work on getting those
back points."

The dual, however, looked to slip away from the Car
dinal as the Aggies won the next three matches to take a
9-7 lead. Senior Shane Cross (174) and junior Tim
Kendall (IX4) lost heartbreaking matches.
Cross wrestled in typical, defensive fashion against
Aggie sophomore Martin Cook. The third period began
with a 2-1 Cross lead after two periods of tough tie ups
and hand lighting to try to gain control. Cook scored a es
cape to knot the score at 2-2 with 22 seconds left. The
match went to sudden-death overtime and Cross lost on
a takedown call by the referee to give Cook the 4-2 win.
Kendall also fought a close battle with Aggie junior
I )avid Cobb. After an optional start by Cobb, which gave
Kendall a 6-5 lead in the third period, Cobb took Kendall
down and let him up to tie the match at 7. With an ener
gized crowd on their feet, Kendall gave up a takedown
with 4() seconds left to fall, 9-7.
I)avis then took a 9-7 team lead after a loss by Stanford
freshman Chuck Fairbanks (197).
"The momentum was on a roller coaster," said fresh
man Andy Hunter (285). "We were definitely down after
three losses in a row."
Hunter regained the momentum for Stanford with a
thrilling 6-2 win over Aggie sophomore Brandon Arse

nault. The score, however, is misleading as to how close
the match was until the final seconds.
After a 0-0 tie after one period, Hunter opened up the
match with a two-point reversal to start the second peri
od despite a nagging knee injury.
Hunter started the third period on top and Arsenault
escaped to tie the score at 2-2 with one minute and a half
left. The crowd erupted when Hunter hit a huge double
leg takedown and took Arsenault straight to his hack to
score two more points in the final six seconds.
"I had a long talk with coach after the Oregon and
Harvard losses because I was not preparing well mental
ly or looking forward to wrestling," Hunter said. "I really
felt mentally prepared for this match which led to the
win."
Junior Rudy Ruiz (125) took a cue from Hunter in his
10-2 win over Davis sophomore Dallen Phillips. Ruiz
showed explosive quickness for excellent single- and dou
ble-leg takedowns and capitalized on Phillips' poor shots.
Ruiz was able to turn Phillips onto his back with a strong
arm bar and finished the match with a commanding lead
in riding time.
