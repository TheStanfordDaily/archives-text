The good news is that a proposed
joint Stanford-Palo Alto Performing
Arts Center might be in the offing.
Palo Alto's new mayor, Gary
Fazzino, indicated in his inaugural
speech Monday that he wants to
make a new Performing Arts Center
a reality.
Current facilities in Palo Alto and
Stanford are "woefully inadequate,"
Fazzino said in an interview Friday.
"We need a larger theater for the per
forming arts."
Preliminary discussions about the
center have already begun according

to Larry Horton, Stanford's director
of government and community rela
tions.
Horton said that although Stan
ford and the City Council "have been
talking about it for years and years,"
he welcomes this round of negotia
tions. "Close observers of the art
scene realize that Stanford and Palo
Alto could use a high-quality art cen
ter."
Currently, no specific proposals
about site locations and cost have
been made.
Fazzino points out that part of the
problem is that "not many sites are
available" for a new arts center. He
hopes for a location that will fall mid
way between Stanford and Palo
Alto.
Horton says that the center will
undoubtedly be "quite expensive"

and require fund-raising. The scope
of the proposed center has not been
determined.
"When I came to Stanford I found
that although Stanford has great
sports and academics, it is lacking su
perior arts facilities," Elizabeth Grif
fin, a sophomore taking ballet classes
and performing with the Vintage
Dance Ensemble, said. "A new per
forming arts center will be a very pos
itive addition to the Stanford com
munity. Everyone can benefit from
performing and visual arts."
Although significant planning has
yet to take place, Fazzino remains
optimistic. "Before we get much fur
ther we need to secure a commitment
from Palo Alto and Stanford and get
input from art groups in the commu
nity," said Fazzino. "But it could be
come a reality."
