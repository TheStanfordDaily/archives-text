## 
### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Nana Howton has been named the in
terim director of the Lesbian. Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center as University
officials rethink the administrative struc
ture of the center following the unexpect
ed resignation of the center's first director,
Gwendolyn Dean.
"After [Dean] left, there was no one

there to do a lot of the administrative stuff
... basic stuff that has to be done," said
Howton, who is leaving her current job at
the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter for a six month term at the LGBCC.
"1 want to bring people together ...
and make the center work again," she said.
Dean resigned in November after hold
ing the half-time directorship for less than
three months, accepting a similar, full
time position at Cornell University.

Last month about 50 students met with
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves to indicate their desire for a full
time director. At the meeting officials
promised to go over the budget to see if
more funding could be made available for
the position.
"We hope to have an answer by the end
of January or mid-Februarv," said Graves,

who will oversee the search for a new di
rector. He said thai budget discussions
were underway, with consideration being
given to creating a "package" deal, offer
ing the next director an additional half
time position within student affairs to go
along with the LGBCC position.
A similar deal was given to Dean, who
worked in the Office of Student Activities
in addition to her duties at the cen
ter.
Howton will work about 20 hours
per week in the interim.
Graves said that he received nu
merous e-mails recommending
Howton for the interim position.
"She's a very smart person, won
derfully warm with a great sense of
humor,'" said Kathy Veit, former
chair of the LGBCC Advisory
Board. The board, consisting of stu
dents, alumni, faculty and staff, gave
unanimous support to Howton fol
lowing meeting with her in mid-De
cember.
Originally from Brazil, Howton
was active in gay and lesbian organi
zations and helped found a counsel
ing group for battered women in
Brazil during the late 1970s and

early 1980s.
She then went to France, becom
ing in involved with the women's lib
eration movement and Des
Femmes, which she described as a
women's publishing house.
Howton began working at Stan
ford in 1992 at Hoover Library, be
fore joining the staff at the Career
Planning and Placement Center,
helping students find non-profit,
public service careers.
In the summer of 1995, she and
her partner, Elizabeth Howton,
were married in Memorial Church.
They were the first lesbian couple to
exchange vows in the church.
Howton met with the center's
student staff members on Thursday,
who also recommended her for the
position.
"I thought she was a very capable
person," said sophomore Arthur
Lauer, co-volunteer coordinator at
the LGBCC.

"She has a lot of administrative
skills, she knows her way about the
University," said Lauer, adding that
he felt she melded well with the cur
rent staff at the center.
Howton said she was not interest
ed in becoming the permanent di
rector of the center.
The directorship position was
first established last winter. Al
though both a proposal written by
students and a group formed by the
Dean of Students Office found a
need for a full-time employee. Mon
toya only allocated money for a half
time position, citing a lack of funds.
Since Dean's resignation, a group
of students has been meeting to dis
cuss possible modes of action, in
cluding rallies and protests, should
the University not allocate funding
for a full-time directorship.
Graves said that he hoped to
name a permanent director by the
end of Mav.
