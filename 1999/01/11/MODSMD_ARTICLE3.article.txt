### Jaime Adame Staff writer 
Nana Howton has been named the in
terim director of the Lesbian. Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center as University
officials rethink the administrative struc
ture of the center following the unexpect
ed resignation of the center's first director,
Gwendolyn Dean.
"After [Dean] left, there was no one

there to do a lot of the administrative stuff
... basic stuff that has to be done," said
Howton, who is leaving her current job at
the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter for a six month term at the LGBCC.
"1 want to bring people together ...
and make the center work again," she said.
Dean resigned in November after hold
ing the half-time directorship for less than
three months, accepting a similar, full
time position at Cornell University.

Last month about 50 students met with
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and Assoc. Dean of Students Morris
Graves to indicate their desire for a full
time director. At the meeting officials
promised to go over the budget to see if
more funding could be made available for
the position.
"We hope to have an answer by the end
of January or mid-Februarv," said Graves,

who will oversee the search for a new di
rector. He said thai budget discussions
were underway, with consideration being
given to creating a "package" deal, offer
ing the next director an additional half
time position within student affairs to go
along with the LGBCC position.
A similar deal was given to Dean, who
worked in the Office of Student Activities
