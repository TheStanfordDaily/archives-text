For the Stanford chess team the most difficult part of
the Pan-Amcrican Intercollegiate Chess Champi
onships came not during their match against Harvard,
but in transporting their four-foot-tall trophy hack to
Stanford.
The seventh-seeded chess team won the trophy after
an unexpected tie for third place. Twenty-one teams at
tended the tournament, including teams from Peru and
Canada.
In a mad rush to make their departing flight, the
team was forced to disassemble their giant trophy and
distribute it in their carry on bags. They still didn't make
the flight, but that didn't take the edge off their dramat
ic victory.
"We were dreaming of [a third place finish]. We
didn't expect it." said Michael Aigner. Aigner. a gradu-

ate student in mechanical engineering, was the third
ranked Stanford player.
"Wo were considered the Cinderella team of the
tournament. People were turning their heads asking
'Who is that?'," said team president and first-ranked
player Adrian Keatinge-Clay. "A lot of teams were tak
ing notice of us."
This marks the first time that the Stanford Chess
Team has finished in the top 10 at the championships.
Stanford's tie for third is all the more significant because
team members said they believe they faced the stiffest
competition of any team at the tournament.
"We had undoubtedly the hardest schedule," said
team member Erik Stuart. Stuart, a graduate student at
the school of business, rounded out the Cardinal in the
final, fourth-ranked position. "We were the only team in
the top six to face the winning team. I Jniversity of Mary
