# HP gift helps teach speech

Thanks to a grant from Hewlett-
Packard, six laptop computers will
help give the gift of language to chil
dren.
The grant was given to Kids With
Dreams, a student-run program that
aims to help developmentally dis
abled children and young adults in
the Bay Area. The laptops will be
used in the organization's language
training program.
Kids With Dreams plans on incor
porating the computers into existing
curricula with the purpose of improv
ing both the speaking skills and vo
cabularies of program participants.
The planned program will pilot at

Achieve, formerly the Peninsula
Children's Center, in Palo Alto and.
if successful, expand to other venues.
"What set Kids With Dreams
apart from other groups was that it
took a new approach to an existing
problem," said Paul Cruz, informa
tion technology manager at Hewlett-
Packard.
Linguistic coaching of develop
mentally disabled elementary and ju
nior-high-school-aged students is a
major focus of Kids With Dreams.
The organization works with stu
dents facing a wide range of disabili
ties, including autism and Down Syn
drome.
"Language skills are one of the
major problems disabled kids face."

said junior Rollin Hu. the group's
public relations director. When deal
ing with non-disabled children it is
"taken for granted that they have
these opportunities and skills," said
Hu. disabled chil
dren don't usually get these same op
portunities to be independent."
Chris Varnia. Kids With Dreams'
executive director, said that the
group focuses not only on the end of
empowering the disabled, but also on
the means. The organization is re
search-and-development-focused,
he said, looking to technology for in
novative and effective ways to fulfill
its purpose.
Varma hopes that the incorpora
tion of laptops will allow Kids With
Dreams volunteers to develop indi
vidual programs for each student.
This, in turn, should make training
more personal, reduce distractions
and focus on the specific needs of
each child.
Each of the six laptops will contain
software specific to the student's
level of ability. The software, de
signed by Laureate Learning Sys
tems, has teaching activities geared to
the various stages of language acqui
sition.
Kids With Dreams chose Laure
ate's software because the company
based its approach on language de
velopment research. Also the soft
ware has proven successful in clinical
settings.
Although the organization will
initially use existing linguistics soft
ware in its programs, Varma, a coter
minal student in computer science,
plans to work with members of the
Stanford community to develop new
software designed specifically with
the needs of the disabled in mind.
"The software we're looking for
just isn't out there, because it doesn't
have a lucrative market," Varma ex
plained.
In addition to its linguistic coach
ing program. Kids With Dreams has
several other programs including
recreation, job training and life skills.
The organization, which works in

conjunction with eight schools and
community programs, hopes to equip
participants with the necessary tools
for independence.
"Although society cares, it often
views handicapped children as de
pendents. 1 think they can make a dif
ference," said Varma. "We want to
empower these children so they can
go out and make significant contribu
tions to society."
Kids With Dreams, now in its sec
ond year, was founded by 1 )ave ( hen
and Corey Karlin. members of the
Class of '98.
"Resources for disabled children

are often underfunded and under
staffed." Hu said. "We're trying to
use Stanford's resources and volun
teers to give them additional oppor
tunities."
The organization currently has
about 50 volunteers. Volunteers are
accepted for opportunities ranging
from full-time summer internships to
volunteer commitments of two hours
a week. Positions include classroom
assistants, mentors, program leaders,
and early intervention therapists.
The group will hold a recruiting ori
entation at the Haas Center's Donald
Kennedy Room tonight at 8 p.m.
