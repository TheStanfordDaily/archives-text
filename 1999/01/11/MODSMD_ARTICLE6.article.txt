Thanks to a grant from Hewlett-
Packard, six laptop computers will
help give the gift of language to chil
dren.
The grant was given to Kids With
Dreams, a student-run program that
aims to help developmentally dis
abled children and young adults in
the Bay Area. The laptops will be
used in the organization's language
training program.
Kids With Dreams plans on incor
porating the computers into existing
curricula with the purpose of improv
ing both the speaking skills and vo
cabularies of program participants.
The planned program will pilot at

Achieve, formerly the Peninsula
Children's Center, in Palo Alto and.
if successful, expand to other venues.
"What set Kids With Dreams
apart from other groups was that it
took a new approach to an existing
problem," said Paul Cruz, informa
tion technology manager at Hewlett-
Packard.
Linguistic coaching of develop
mentally disabled elementary and ju
nior-high-school-aged students is a
major focus of Kids With Dreams.
The organization works with stu
dents facing a wide range of disabili
ties, including autism and Down Syn
drome.
"Language skills are one of the
major problems disabled kids face."

said junior Rollin Hu. the group's
public relations director. When deal
ing with non-disabled children it is
"taken for granted that they have
these opportunities and skills," said
Hu. disabled chil
dren don't usually get these same op
portunities to be independent."
Chris Varnia. Kids With Dreams'
executive director, said that the
group focuses not only on the end of
empowering the disabled, but also on
the means. The organization is re
search-and-development-focused,
he said, looking to technology for in
novative and effective ways to fulfill
its purpose.
