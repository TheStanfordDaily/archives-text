# Most students disapprove of 'partisan' proceedings
## Apathetic on impeachment 
### Marie Sotelo 
Many Stanford students echo
the sentiments of the majority of
the American public, expressing
disapproval and weariness towards
what they believe are partisan poli
tics driving the impeachment of
President Clinton.
A bipartisan agreement reached
by members of the Senate has es
tablished procedural terms to expe
dite the upcoming impeachment
trial. The notion of a swift trial is
sweet to the ears of many students
and citizens, as students on campus
appear uninterested in the current

proceedings.
"I'm pretty uninformed, and I 'm
embarrassed to say that I haven't
put much effort into being in
formed." sophomore Jenny Dorth
said.
Bryan Hughes, a sophomore
and member of Stanford Democ
rats. believes that there is a surpris
ing amount of ignorance about cur
rent events on any college campus.
"I think that students know
what's going on but don't have an
informed basis for their opinions."
Hughes said. "They are writing it
off as politics as usual, and I think
this is true for a lot of the American

public as well."
"Stanford is a pretty apathetic
campus," added senior lleana
C'arpen. Co-president of Stanford
Republicans. "I don't think people
here are well informed."
Neither Stanford Democrats nor
Stanford Republicans has engaged
in official debate or discussion
about the issue.
Some students welcome an ab
sence of campus discussion sur
rounding the recent events.
"I'm just happy that it's treated
with a certain amount of apathy."
