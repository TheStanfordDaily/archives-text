# Most students disapprove of 'partisan' proceedings
## Apathetic on impeachment 
### Marie Sotelo 
Many Stanford students echo
the sentiments of the majority of
the American public, expressing
disapproval and weariness towards
what they believe are partisan poli
tics driving the impeachment of
President Clinton.
A bipartisan agreement reached
by members of the Senate has es
tablished procedural terms to expe
dite the upcoming impeachment
trial. The notion of a swift trial is
sweet to the ears of many students
and citizens, as students on campus
appear uninterested in the current

proceedings.
"I'm pretty uninformed, and I 'm
embarrassed to say that I haven't
put much effort into being in
formed." sophomore Jenny Dorth
said.
Bryan Hughes, a sophomore
and member of Stanford Democ
rats. believes that there is a surpris
ing amount of ignorance about cur
rent events on any college campus.
"I think that students know
what's going on but don't have an
informed basis for their opinions."
Hughes said. "They are writing it
off as politics as usual, and I think
this is true for a lot of the American

public as well."
"Stanford is a pretty apathetic
campus," added senior lleana
C'arpen. Co-president of Stanford
Republicans. "I don't think people
here are well informed."
Neither Stanford Democrats nor
Stanford Republicans has engaged
in official debate or discussion
about the issue.
Some students welcome an ab
sence of campus discussion sur
rounding the recent events.
"I'm just happy that it's treated
with a certain amount of apathy."
expressed junior Cesar Martinez.
Other students agree with Mar
tinez but believe that people are a
lot less apathetic and more in
formed than it seems.
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Richard Brody agreed.
"The American people think
that this story is over, and that it's
just a waste of time and that there
are more important problems for
the government to be looking at,"
Brody said.
The American public is willing
to overlook the President's moral
corruption and criminal actions in
light of continuing economic

growth, he said.
Brody pointed out that students
are also better educated than most
Americans and should better un
derstand the importance of the cur
rent proceedings.
As well, many students said they
utilize different forms of informa
tion, exposing them to less sensa
tionalized news.
"No one sits around on a
Wednesday night watching Tom
Brokaw or the nightly news. They
rely on the newspaper or the Inter
net," Martinez said.
Students may also be more will
ing than the general public to ig
nore politicians' personal flaws.
Brody remarked that students
are less likely to believe that private
sexual behavior is an appropriate

subject of public inquiry.
"I think from my contact with
students that they are more likely to
be socially liberal with regards to
the Christian right," said Brody.
However Brody admitted he still
has a lot of learning to do about the
American public on this subject.
Some students believe that the
outcome of the upcoming trial will
be irrelevant to our country's well
being.
"Much of the public is suprised
and disappointed that the matter
has gotten this far," Hughes ex
plained. "People just think it's par
tisan politics out of control and
think it's not a legal issue."
"People are much more con
cerned with their homework and
their classes," said Carpen.
