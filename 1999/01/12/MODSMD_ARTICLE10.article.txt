## Israel ends blockade, releases two U.S. activists on bail 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — The
Israeli army yesterday lifted a
week-old curfew and blockade that
it imposed on the Palestinian city of
Hebron after suspected Palestinian
militants ambushed and wounded
two Jewish settlers.
Israel also released two North
American peace activists on bail.
The two are members of the Chris
tian Peacemaker Teams, an organi
zation devoted to preventing vio
lence in world trouble spots. They
were arrested in the West Bank city
of Hebron on Sunday after trying to
keep Israeli soldiers from shooting
at Palestinians demonstrating
against the curfew.
Most of Hebron is ruled by the
Palestinian Authority. However.
Israel retains control of small down
town enclaves where about 450
Jewish settlers live. The city has a
Palestinian population of 130,000.

Two women were wounded ear
lier this month when attackers rid
dled their van with bullets. Israeli
authorities believe the attackers
escaped into the Palestinian-con
trolled part of the city.
Israel demanded that the Pales
tinian Authority hunt down the
assailants, but no arrests have been
made.
The Israelis imposed the curfew
Jan. 4 on approximately 30,000
Palestinians who live within
Hebron's Israeli-controlled
enclaves, but not on the settlers,
who were allowed to move about
freely.
The Israeli army also sealed off
the Palestinian-controlled part of
the city, cutting residents off from
the rest of the West Bank and mak
ing it impossible for those with jobs
in Israel to get to work.
The attack came as the peace

process between Israel and the
Palestinians remained frozen.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu refuses to continue
handing over territory promised to
the Palestinians in the U.S.-bro
kered Wye agreement and has
accused the Palestinians of violating
key clauses of the accord.
Palestinians demonstrated Sun
day against the curfew and closure,
throwing stones at Israeli soldiers.
The soldiers threw stun grenades
and fired tear gas. Israel TV said
four Palestinians were injured.
Sara Reschly, 26, from Mount
Pleasant, lowa, was brought to the
Jerusalem Magistrate's Court on
Monday, along with Pierre Shantz.
24, from Kitchener-Waterloo.
Ontario, for interfering in Sunday's
protest.
A judge released them on bail of
$482 each.
