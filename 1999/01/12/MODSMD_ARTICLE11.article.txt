# Serbia demands hostage release

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” President Slobo
dan Milosevic set a deadline today for ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo to release eight Yugoslav army sol
diers and warned that time was running out before a
major crackdown, a top European official said.
In Switzerland, a political representative of the
rebels said the Kosovo Liberation Army might release
as early as tonight some of the captives that were seized
Friday when their convoy strayed into rebel-held terri
tory.
"We are going to make a step forward, probably this
evening," Bardhyl Mahmuti said in Geneva. He said
"certain of them may be freed" in exchange for ethnic
Albanian forces held by the Serbs.
Knut Vollebaek, Norwegian foreign minister and
chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooper
ation in Europe, warned after meeting Milosevic that
there will be major bloodshed in Kosovo unless the
KLA releases the hostage soldiers immediately.
"I asked for an extension of the time and I was given

that by President Milosevic," said Vollebaek in the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, refusing to specify the
time limit. "I think that it is very important that the
KLA knows that we are very short of time.
"There is very little time left, and we have to see an
immediate release of the hostages if we should avoid a
major conflict," he added.
The detention of the eight is the latest challenge to
the off-and-on cease-fire in Kosovo, where guerrillas
are fighting for the Albanian-majority province's inde
pendence from Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
More than 1 .(KM) people have been killed in the near
ly year-old conflict, including a reported five over the
weekend. Among the latest was an ethnic Albanian
teenager who died Saturday in a Serb shelling near a
coal mining village where the Yugoslav soldiers are
being held.
The KLA has refused an appeal by NATO and oth
ers to free the soldiers, demanding the release of their
own fighters held by authorities first.
