### 
BRIDGEPORT, Conn.
(AP) — Lawmakers are calling on
the governor to investigate why an
8-vear-old witness in a murder
case was not receiving police pro
lection when he was shot to death
along with his mother.
The bodies of Leroy Brown Jr.
and his mother. Karen Clarke, 30.
were found in their apartment Fri
day morning.
Leroy, a second-grader at Read
School, was the state's key witness
against a man charged with a fatal
shooting inside a crowded barber
shop last year.
Russell Peeler. 26, is charged

with murder in the May 29 death
of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph
Snead Jr., 28, who was shot eight
times.
At the time of the murder. Peel
er was out on bond after being
accused of attempting to murder
Snead in a drive-by shooting. The
Connecticut Post, citing police
sources, said the boy had wit
nessed that earlier shooting.
While police are investigating
any possible link between the
boy's status as a witness and his
death, no such link has been
established, police said. Detec
tives have been interviewing any

one who may have heard threats
made against the victims, Police
Lt. Matthew Cuminotto Jr. said.
"There are a series of questions
that need to be addressed," state
Rep. Christopher Caruso told the
newspaper Saturday. "Once the
boy was deemed a witness he
should have been protected by the
state."
Caruso and state Sen. Alvin
Penn, both Democrats, said they
will ask Gov. John G. Rowland
and Chief State's Attorney John
Bailey to investigate why the boy
was receiving no special protec
tion.
