Sophomore College success
warrants expansion within
academic and housing limits

WITH ITS GREATER recogni
tion as a highly acclaimed
enhancement to undergraduate
education. Sophomore College is expand
ing to better meet student demand.
Considering this program's popularity,
we strongly support such attempts to
broaden its reach.'TTowever, as admirris"
trators ponder further expansion, we
hope that growing pains will not diminish
the value of Sophomore College.
As the premier offering of Stanford
Introductory Studies, Sophomore College
promotes academic exploration through
quality interaction between students and
faculty. Students participate in a two
week seminar before the start of fall quar
ter in which they interact closely with a
prominent profesor and learn about
research opportunities and other campus
resources.
Last year, over 700 applicants compet
ed for 324 available slots. Following the
expansion, Sophomore College will
accept 420 students, as the number of
seminars increases from 27 to 35.
Growing demand certainly suggests
that expansion is well deserved. If stu
dents indeed perceive participation in
Sophomore College as a factor in their
academic success, opportunity to attend
should be available to a critical mass of
applicants.
At the same time, the program's small
collegiate atmosphere must survive any
aggressive growth. Seminars need to stay
small and the residential environment
should remain conducive to informal
communication with faculty and adminis
trators. This year's participating sopho
mores are quick to lament that their hous
ing was inconveniently split between

Toyon and Twain.
It is quite unlikely that Sophomore Col
lege can maintain its quality while includ
ing every member of the class. Participa
tion in the program should certainly not
be mandatory, or even expected. Follow
ing Stanford's unwritten tradition, it
should remain one of many options, albeit
one that is available to most of the stu
dents who seek it.
So far, this is exactly the course that the
administration is following. Thanks to
strong faculty participation, the next
cohort of sophomores will still spend
September mornings in small seminars
with highly regarded professors.
Sophomore College, meanwhile, is no
longer a pilot program. Excellent reviews
have earned it an honored place in the
web of Stanford's undergraduate oppor
tunities. In terms of rigorous evaluation,
this is also the end of its honeymoon peri
od.
Ultimately, factors beyond student
demand and faculty interest ought to doc
ument the success of Sophomore College.
Data on the program's past participants
should indicate whether this experience
really stimulates undergraduate research,
improves academic performance and
enhances student satisfaction.
As a popular offering for a difficult
undergraduate year. Sophomore College
can tell the University a great deal about
student needs and appropriate academic
advising. It is time to begin a thorough
search for this information, which can
help to explain, replicate and improve the
program's success. We hope that the
upcoming restructuring of the program's
oversight will accomplish just that.
Expansion makes sense while the scale
of Sophomore College is still small
enough to continue meeting its goal of
encouraging academic exploration.
Before adopting an even more aggressive
growth strategy, however, the administra
tors must understand whether — and how
— the program helps students.
