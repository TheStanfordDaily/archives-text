## Confronting differences honestly 
### 
I WROTE A column
last week that was
meant to make people
laugh. It also tried to make
some admittedly subtle
points about racism and
how certain acts meant to
strengthen one's culture

and societal unity can actually work to their
detriment. Not everyone got the point.
There is reason for this. We live in a time
of progress, but also in a time where much
progress remains to be seen. People are sen
sitive about their races and cultures, so
much so that they can no longer laugh. Put
simply, we often take ourselves too serious
ly-
Some people are so caught up in being
politically correct that seeing a certain word
or catch phrase, regardless of context or
intent, renders them unable to draw any
conclusion apart from, "That's racist" or
"That's discriminatory." But that type of
thinking stifles the very thoughts and dis
cussions that empowers those groups most
in need — whether that need be tolerance
of others, or maybe just a good laugh.
The danger with things such as Kwanzaa
is not with their ideals, but with their reali
ties. Good intentions are misused to split
groups further apart. What begins as a call
for unity ends by further separating people
who are "different."
In a perfect world, one could emphasize
difference without any problem. One
should be able to stand up and say, "I'm
proud to be who I am." But in today's
imperfect environment, ripe with remnants
of a racist past, groups must realize the risk
of separation. Division rarely produces tol

erance.
What does produce tolerance, though, is
interaction. Communication. Understand
ing. We need to see what others think
before being able to change how they think.
But this process itself requires tolerance:
One needs to hear the other side. And at
the moment, our sensitivity olten shuts us
off from other points of view without us
realizing, occasionally, that these opinions
are actually in our favor.
This act of "censorship" does not only
happen at the extremes; it often reaches
opinions in the middle — even opinions in
an attempt at humor in a column.
But if we could tolerate the extreme,
then we could finally make progress
towards unity. So listen up, because I've got
something important to say. Maybe it's not
something I want to say, but it's something
that needs to be said.
N — r.
There. 1 said it. Now deal with it. I'm not
calling anyone that atrocious label; I'm sim
ply saying the word — an empty, hate-filled
epithet of hypocrisy said by those insecure
with their own self-worth.
It pains me to write that word. It pains
me to think it. Yet that is part of the prob
lem: It's just a word. The real problem is in
the belief of the racist who says it not in jest,
not in example, but in belief —belief that
the color of one's skin makes one a different
person. And this thinking cannot be
addressed by pretending it is not there.
We need to desensitize ourselves. But it
is here that the irony develops. Knee-jerk
reactions preclude rational discussions, dis
cussions that could finally eliminate the mis
understanding and hatred. These discus

sions could bridge the gap between "differ
ent" people. But these discussions do not
occur.
That terrible word scares people so
much that they do not want to talk about it.
They don't want to think about it. They
want to ban a book like "Huckleberry
Finn" even though it speaks against racism.
But of course, it uses "that word."
This is somewhat understandable. If I
hate anything, I hate that word. And I ani
not the subject of its irrational wrath. But
how can the gap — a very real gap, despite
the artificial nature of our differences — be
bridged if we don't address the problem as
one society?
This does not imply that everyone has to
be the same. A melting pot is not the
answer. Our society thrives on its disparate
views and values. But until we learn to sep
arate "color" from "culture" and under
stand that race is not important, we will not
be able to truly tap into the vast resources
and potential of a multi-cultural society. It is
possible to maintain one's culture without
distancing oneself from others.
Of course, maybe I am wrong. Maybe we
are different. And it is possible that I'm
wrong again. Maybe these differences pre
clude unity. But that would truly be a
shame. Our society is strong because of our
diversity in thought, values, opinions and
cultures, but not because of color.
It is our diversity, not the emphasis on
our diversity, that makes us strong.

Dan Geyser, a senior majoring in political
science, hopes he never has to use the word
"neighbor" again.
