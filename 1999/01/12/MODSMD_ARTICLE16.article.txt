Faculty voices sidelined
by tenure decision
It was with considerable dismay that I
learned of President Casper's decision
regarding Professor Karen Sawislak's
grievance and appeals. Sawislak had been
voted tenure by the Department of History;
the tenure case then moved up to the
Appointments and Promotions committee,
an advisory faculty board, which approved
the History Department's recommenda
tion, to the deans of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, where, in a reversal, she
was denied tenure.
In substance, Sawislak appealed that she
be granted tenure, and claimed the deans
had dealt with her case less than fairly. In
substance. President Casper rejected the
decision of the advisory board, the highest
faculty commitee in such matters, which
agreed with the appeal and grievance.
Indeed, to grant Sawislak two more
years as a junior faculty member, and a new
tenure review, is by no means to uphold, in

part or in whole, her appeal and grievance.
Others may discuss whether Stanford
needs an affirmative action policy at the
promotion-to-tenure level. I wish to address
the president's ruling in its potential impli
cations for the constitution of Stanford Uni
versity. The issue is very simple. A presi
dent, if we may borrow a leaf from early
20th-century debates, should be der Hueter
der Verfassunß. And indeed our collective
body has been battered in recent years by
recrimination — as President Casper him
self complained this past fall.
But which "constitution" is our president
the "guardian" of? By disavowing the
majority of the highest faculty board, the
president may be guarding his administra
tion from the sharp rebuke the deans
received in the advisory board's report. He
may be guarding the University as a corpo
ration from the lawsuits other faculty reject
ed for tenure might file were he to side with
Sawislak's grievance. He may be guarding
his authority as president.
In some honorable legal traditions,
sovereignty is after all to decide on the

exception — and this is what President
Casper claims to have done. Thus, implicit
ly, the constitution being guarded by this
decision is one where the administration
governs without regard for the opinion that
the faculty has of its governance.
It may be objected that the advisory
board's condemnation of Sawislak's treat
ment wasn't unanimous. But non-unani
mous collective decisions are no less repre
sentative in our parliamentary political cul
ture, no matter how critical one is, in the
light of the William Clinton impeachment
proceedings, of the Geistesgeschichtliche
Lage lies heutigen Parliamentarismus.
It may be objected that the administra
tion is staffed with faculty members. But
this forgets that any institution has a logic
which imposes itself on the individuals who
staff it. That all strictly faculty bodies sided
with Professor Sawislak, and that all admin
istrative bodies sided against her, remains a
tell-tale fact.
