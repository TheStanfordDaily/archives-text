4 r I THE wind, a man, his
eyes, it is impossible, the nature
-A- of it is so fine and subtile" (Roger
Aseham's "Toxophilus," 1545). I read that
sentence about three months ago in a
review of a new English prose anthology.
Since then it's been a ball bearing in the
empty rattle of my head. I can't shake it out.
It comes from a technical work on
archery, written by a contemporary of
Shakespeare. "The wind" opens the sen
tence. then collides with all the ideas that
follow: the man, his eyes and the wind's
ultimate mystery. Of course, the sentence is
entirely incorrect by today's standards. Its
structure does not conform to modern
expectations. Unpossible is no longer a
word (but what a word it was!). Subtile has
a peculiar spelling.
Yet, despite all these supposed faults the
sentence delivers all the goods. It does the
textbook's job and surprises like poetry.
Like its author, it stares into the face of the
wind, its eyes wincing and wet, but still
remains as precise as a scalpel.
In the 20th century such prose is sent
away to join the Dodo. Unimaginative

teachers, bored editors and competent writ
ers are its executioners, working on the
belief that the number of rules writing
obeys has to do with its precision.
On reading the 16th-century sentence
that so fascinates me, the Trainee Assistant
Subcopy Editor gloomily takes out his or
her red pen and reduces the sentence to the
moronic "You cannot see the wind, because
you cannot see the wind." As with every
extinction, the survivors are the victims.
Last year when Diversions still existed, I
wrote a piece that involved copying whole
sections out of James Joyce's "Ulysses." I'd
been having an ongoing feud with my editor
over w hat was correct comedic syntax. This
was a trap she was bound to fall into. She
naturally helped poor old James Joyce,
adding punctuation, capitals, correct
spellings, and so on whenever dear, simple
James didn't know better.
"That's James Joyce you just corrected."
"That's James Joyce?"
"Yes, it's all from 'Ulysses.'" This was
my triumph. I never thought that anybody
would assume she could improve some of
the greatest 700 pages of the 20th century.

"Really? Well if he didn't have the sense
to listen to his editors back then, then I sup
pose there's not much point to me doing
anything about it now," she replied, and
piteously shrugged her shoulders and
Joyce's lack of vision.
This is a world where great authors such
as Joyce must be confined within a copy edi
tor's tiny imagination. Emily Dickinson's
punctuation was disastrously corrected by
her first male editor, who assumed the only
reason not to obey the dictates of punctua
tion was femininity. One shudders to think
of the genocidal proportions of punctuation
that might have been visited upon e e cum
mings had he been a woman. Faith in hol
low rules has made our standards of cor
rectness go horribly wrong.
When pressed, nobody can tell you what
the majority of language rules are for, or
why so many "colloquialisms" that origi
nate from the working classes are more
unacceptable than the absurd nonsenses —
"paradigm," "downsizing," "pro-active" —
the ruling classes splutter every day.
This society thinks nothing of splitting
atoms, but recoils in horror when the same

thing happens to infinitives. A typical objec
tion can be found in this paper last year
from a then-undeclared freshman, who, like
all freshmen, knows it all: "Besides from
faulty logic, Evans has not yet mastered the
simple rules of grammar — split infinitive in
line 57 'to actually learn.' Darron
Evans... you are an arrogant fool, who
doesn't know how to think, let alone write."
Split infinitives can do no harm to
English whatsoever. Eighteenth-century
grammarians thought we shouldn't split our
infinitives because the Romans didn't split
theirs (it's difficult to split one w or d).
When in Rome, do as the Romans. But we
are not in Rome; just because the Romans'
language is dead doesn't mean we should
make ours equally so.
When the second edition of Webster's
Dictionary (1961) included the word
"ain't," the newspaper-writing public went
ballistic. "Small wonder that our English
speaking world, when it thus tolerates the
debasement of its language, is having trou
ble with creatures like beatniks — not to
mention Nikolai Krushchev and his kind,"
thundered the Washington Sunday Star.

Similarly in 1997, when the Oakland
school board dared give "Ebonics" the
smell of legitimacy by labeling it as a sepa
rate language, the guardians of standard
English in the newspapers swooped down,
issued a blanket condemnation and left the
school board to pick up what pieces
remained of their pupils' educations.
Beatniks, rappers and speakers of Ebon
ics and other forms of "non-standard"
English have done more for the English lan
guage than a thousand editions of "The Ele
ments of Style." They have made a lan
guage that suited themselves and their time
and made sure its precision maintained a
heartbeat.
Standard English is useful for animals
such as bureaucrats and tax collectors. It sits
comfortably on dotted lines of official
forms. But it is only a convention. If all you
care about is the integrity of your infinitives,
go in peace. But don't think you're more
intelligent for simply obeying rules where
imagination is the only real standard.
