## Gymnastics teams begin year with strong outings No. 8 men fall short against No. 2 Bears

No Stanford team likes to lose to California, under
any circumstances. There are, however, times when a de
feat at the hands of the Golden Bears is a bit more palat
able.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Friday: No. 2 California 214.8(X), No. 8 Stanford
211.900.
The No. 8 Stanford mens gymnastics wouldn't go so
far as to say that it enjoyed losing to No. 2 California
(214.800- 211.900) last Friday night at the Recreational
Sports Facility in Berkeley, but according to head coach
Sadao Hamada, winning the meet was not the team's pri
mary objective.
"I was not really concerned about winning or losing." 1
Hamada said. "Next time if we go in with the attitude of
trying to beat Cal, I'm confident that we could win."
Despite the fact that the defeat was the Cardinal's
15th consecutive loss to the defending national champi
on Golden Bears, redshirt junior co-captain Scott Finkel
stein found reason to be optimistic.
"We know that we have the tools to beat them."

Finkelstein said. "When they come here in three weeks
[for the Cardinal Open] I think that they're going to be in
for a surprise."
Besides giving the Cardinal a chance to end its losing
streak to the Bears, the meet was an opportunity for
Stanford to gauge the progress that it had made during
the preseason and get its highly touted freshman class
some valuable experience.
Even though the losing streak remains, the Cardinal
did accomplish the latter two of its objectives.
Freshmen twins Adam and Brandon Berkenbile, as
well as freshman Kevin Chow, were finally able to show
case their talents on the collegiate level.
And showcase they did.
In his first ever collegiate competition, Adam Berken
bile finished third in the all-around competition (52.7(X))
and took home second-place honors in the floor exercise
(9.4(X)). Brandon captured second place in the vault with
a 9.350.
"There was a lot of potential out there among our
freshmen," Finkelstein said.
Besides the potential displayed by its freshmen, the
Cardinal had to be encouraged by the strong perfor
mances turned in bv its veterans.
