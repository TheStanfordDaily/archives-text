# No. 10 women down Aggies at UC-Davis

The No. 10 Stanford women's
gymnastics team uses that expres
sion to focus itself before every
competition. According to senior
co-captain Amy Murakami, it re
minds the Cardinal gymnasts to
focus on themselves, not the other
team.
Last Sunday night against un
ranked UC-Davis they did just
that.
In a sport like gymnastics where
one competes more against oneself
than the other team, the difference
between winning and losing can
sometimes be more a matter of
concentration than skill.
But the Cardinal was superior to
Davis on both ends. Stanford dom
inated the overmatched Aggies in
all aspects of competition en route
to a 192.450-183.975 victory at
Recreation Hall on the UC-Davis
campus.
"I think that the meet went real
lv well." said second-year head

coach Mark Cook. "We're right on
track, exactly where we want to be
after the first competition."
And indeed there was a lot to be
pleased about as the Cardinal
swept the top three places in all
four events. Junior Larissa
Fontaine captured event titles in
both the vault (9.700) and the un
even parallel bars (9.775) to lead
the Cardinal.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Sunday: No. 10 Stanford 192.450,
UC-Davis 183.975.
But perhaps the most encourag
ing performance was turned in by
Stanford freshman Katy Herbert,
who won the individual all-around
competion with a score of 37.925.
Herbert also brought home first
place honors on the balance beam
by finishing in a tie with teammate
Jen Exaltation (9.750) and finished
in third place in the vaulting com
petition with a score of 9.550.
"Our freshmen did great, they
really stepped up and did well for
their first meet," Murakami said.

Besides Fontaine and Herbert,
Exaltation and Jenny Wilson
turned in solid performances for
the Cardinal. Exaltation also cap
tured second place on the uneven
parallel bars (9.725) and third place
in the floor exercise (9.650). Wilson
finished second in the all-around
competition (37.850) and finished
second in the vault with a score of
9.650.
Senior co-captains Murakami
and Tracey Kohl rounded out the
Cardinal scoring. Murakami took
home second place in the floor ex
ercise (9.750) and third place on
the balance beam with a score of
9.725. Kohl won the event title in
the floor exercise with a score of
9.775.
The meet was the first com
petion of the year for both teams,
although each team may have had
different objectives going into the
competition. For the Aggies it was
a Upset a top-10 team; for
the Cardinal it was a warmup for
next week's meet against No. 4
