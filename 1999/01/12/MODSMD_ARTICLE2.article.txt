# TA oversight committee prepares training criteria
## 
### Anne Becker 
After a year-long study, the Committee
to Oversee the Training of Teaching As
sistants is preparing to distribute compre
hensive guidelines on how departments
should train their TAs.
The committee, which began meeting
early last year and is headed by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar and Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Policy Tom Wasow, has gath
ered information through surveying all of
Stanford's academic departments about
the status of their programs to train teach
ing assistants.
"We have spent a good deal of time
talking about what we think is realistic in
the TA training realm," Wasow said.
After reviewing this information, the
committee's officers have "drafted a set of
criteria of basic guidelines for training

TAs that will be circulated to the deans of
schools and then filtered through the de
partments," said Jack Prostko, associate
director of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, who works with the committee.
"The committee is still in the process of
finalizing these criteria, which depart
ments should meet in order for the com
mittee to consider their TA training to be
appropriate and sufficient," Prostko said.
The committee does not simply instruct
the departments on how to educate TAs,
according to Wasow. It monitors the ef
forts of various academic departments and
reports back to the Faculty Senate and the
deans.
"We're not policemen," Wasow said.
"The committee has neither the authority
to sanction departments that aren't con
forming with the senate's guidelines nor
the resources to improve TA training.
Rather, our role is informational."

Prostko agreed. "It is not something
punitive set up to harass the departments.
It is something that is supportive and is in
vestigating what can be done to improve
training."
The oversight committee was proposed
in November 1997 by the Faculty Senate
in response to an ASSU request to "re
view and evaluate the status, effective
ness, and training of teaching assistants."
The Faculty Senate did not have the
power to create a such a program by itself,
but proposed the oversight committee to
"establish accountability forTA training."
Provost Condoleezza Rice enacted the
senate proposal.
"One of our goals was to make sure the
TAs got appropriate training, preparing
them for teaching later on and ensuring
that undergrads have trained teachers,"
Religious Studies Prof. Hester
Gelber, one of the proposal's au
thors, said.
The CTL has also played an in
tegral part in developing and mon
itoring standards of TA training. It
runs a general orientation once a
quarter for TAs, including videos
on such issues as sexual harass
ment, the Honor Code and teach
ing students with disabilities.
Wasow and Saldi'var now in
tend to circulate the guidelines
throughout University depart
ments and meet with department
leaders to review TA training.
"We expect to start with de
partments that extensively make
use of TAs," said Wasow.
The committee hopes to begin
reviewing departments this year
and continue throughout the next
few years.
