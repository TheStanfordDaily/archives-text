# Just a Bit Outside
## Cracking 'The Wall'

Brian Eule

He's the Don King of Table Ten
nis.
This guy is the biggest promoter,
the biggest P.R. guy I've met in a
quite a while. Throughout the last
three years, the Daily has received
e-mails, phone calls, press releases,
the works. He just loves to see his
name in the paper.
Eric Friedman.
There it is. Man, he must be
thrilled right now.
This guy just loves to promote
himself and his sport.

But even more importantly, he
loves to promote "The Wall."
That thing that stood just outside
of Berlin? Nope. The "Great" land
mark in China? Guess again. A Pink
Floyd album? Not even close.
We're talking about Vineet "The
Wall" Agarwal. The greatest thing
to hit Stanford table tennis since,
um, we 11... never mind.
Ohhhh. the possibilities are end
less with Friedman managing such
talent.

Remember when King put on the
"Rumble in the Jungle"? Friedman
could bring Agarwal to some for
eign place, say Sterling Quad, for the
"Battle of the Paddle."
At one point, Friedman told me
that he would challenge any student
to join Stanford's table tennis team,
and if the new team member could
bring aboirt the fall of "The Wall",
Friedman-would pay the person
$1(X).
My heart skipped a beat. Chal
lenge "The Wall?" 1 had never even
dreamed about it. But here was my
chance.
True, there are many opportuni
ties to brush with athletic greatness
at Stanford, but not quite like this
one. Run alongside of Julia Stamps?
It's been done. Attempt to box out
Mark Madsen? Nothing new. But
return an Agarwal serve? 1 needed
to study up for this one.
First thing I did was grab my
handy-dandy club-sports Daily In
formation Packet from my desk at
the office. With listings of the club
teams already in alphabetical order,
I quickly realized that "ping-pong"
was not the politically correct term,
so I flipped to the "T" section and
found "Table Tennis (coed)."
This page had everything I need
ed to know about the club team.
