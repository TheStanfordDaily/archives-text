# Just a Bit Outside
## Cracking 'The Wall' 
### 
Brian Eule

He's the Don King of Table Ten
nis.
This guy is the biggest promoter,
the biggest P.R. guy I've met in a
quite a while. Throughout the last
three years, the Daily has received
e-mails, phone calls, press releases,
the works. He just loves to see his
name in the paper.
Eric Friedman.
There it is. Man, he must be
thrilled right now.
This guy just loves to promote
himself and his sport.

But even more importantly, he
loves to promote "The Wall."
That thing that stood just outside
of Berlin? Nope. The "Great" land
mark in China? Guess again. A Pink
Floyd album? Not even close.
We're talking about Vineet "The
Wall" Agarwal. The greatest thing
to hit Stanford table tennis since,
um, we 11... never mind.
Ohhhh. the possibilities are end
less with Friedman managing such
talent.

Remember when King put on the
"Rumble in the Jungle"? Friedman
could bring Agarwal to some for
eign place, say Sterling Quad, for the
"Battle of the Paddle."
At one point, Friedman told me
that he would challenge any student
to join Stanford's table tennis team,
and if the new team member could
bring aboirt the fall of "The Wall",
Friedman-would pay the person
$1(X).
My heart skipped a beat. Chal
lenge "The Wall?" 1 had never even
dreamed about it. But here was my
chance.
True, there are many opportuni
ties to brush with athletic greatness
at Stanford, but not quite like this
one. Run alongside of Julia Stamps?
It's been done. Attempt to box out
Mark Madsen? Nothing new. But
return an Agarwal serve? 1 needed
to study up for this one.
First thing I did was grab my
handy-dandy club-sports Daily In
formation Packet from my desk at
the office. With listings of the club
teams already in alphabetical order,
I quickly realized that "ping-pong"
was not the politically correct term,
so I flipped to the "T" section and
found "Table Tennis (coed)."
This page had everything I need
ed to know about the club team.
"You must throw the ball six

Eule
inches from hand before serving," it
informed me.
I continued reading. The "ball
can travel 100 mph."
Whoa! Hold it right there. That is
a bit to fast for me. Plastic or no plas
tic, I didn't want that thing making a
direct route towards my forehead. I
was beginning to have my doubts
about this whole challenge thing.
"In some countries," the page
continued, "Table tennis players get
endorsements and are millionaires."
I was back in business.
Man, think about my options! If I
could just make "The Wall" crum
ble, I could sign a contract with But

terfly table tennis equipment. We
could make commercials. I could see
it so clearly...
"Hi. I'm a sportswriter. I used to
stink at table tennis. In fact, I even
called it ping-pong. (Wait for laugh
ter.) But after finding Butterfly, I
brought down 'The Wall.' "
Now, don't get me wrong, I cer
tainly believe table tennis is a real
sport and people who compete in it
are extremely talented. You don't
get to compete in the Olympics with
out having an enormous amount of
talent. And of course, like many club
sports at a major athletic university,
it does not get the attention it is due.
But if I could just win this match
against Agarwal, I could drive down
Escondido in a shiny new car (re
member, in some countries, table

tennis players "are millionaires")
with my lucky paddle hanging from
my rear view mirror.
I would blast The Who's hit,
"Pingball Wizard," from my stylin'
speakers.
People would stare and whisper,
"There goes the guy who wrecked
The Wall.'"
Maybe I could even get Friedman
to be my manager.

Spurts editor Brian Eule, whose
weekly columns appear on Tues
days, is thankful that it seems as if
Stanford's table tennis team consists
of only three people. That way, there
are only three people he has to hide
from this morning. Oh, and Fried
man and Agarwal are not accepting
challenges at the moment, hut I am
told a press release is in the works.
