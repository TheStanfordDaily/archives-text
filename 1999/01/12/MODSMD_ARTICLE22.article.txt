# Menlo Park tries to block Sand Hill
## 
### Marisa Pavlik Contributing writer 
The Sand Hill Road project,
which has been ensnared for
decades in battles, lawsuits and
votes, has been hit with another
delay.
The Menlo Park City Council
voted 4-1 last month to appeal an
earlier court ruling that cleared the
way for construction. Retired
Monterey Superior Court Judge
Harkjoon Paik rejected the coun
cils original lawsuit in September,
which challenged the project's En
vironmental Impact Report.
Council member Steve Schmidt
said that the council found major
problems in the report.
"We have a good case; it was the
right thing to do. We're looking out
for Menlo Park's interest,"
Schmidt said.
Schmidt said the report was
partly based on weak sources. The
traffic models, he said, did not
properly estimate increased traffic
flow. He also took issue with taking
housing numbers from the Stan
ford Web site instead of doing in
dependent research.
Nicholas Jellins, the council
member who voted against the ap
peal, said, "1 thought it was an in
tentional, frivolous waste of tax
payers funds."
"The mayor may very well be
correct that the traffic study was
flawed, but it doesn't matter, be
cause the judge did find evidence
supporting the conclusions,"
Jellins said.
The project includes an exten
sion of Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real and the construction
of apartments for faculty and a
complex for senior citizens.
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community relations
at Stanford, said he was "disap

pointed because [the lawsuit is] just
going to be an additional costly
matter to the taxpayers."
Horton felt that the appeal
would not substantially affect plans
and that construction of a parking
garage at the Stanford Shopping
Center should begin this month.
"We'll vigorously put our case
forward in the court,"he said.
"We're exceptionally confident
about the suit. Judge Paik issued a
detailed four-page decision that
supported Stanford."
According to Horton. the voters
of Menlo Park are in favor of the
project. "The measures were on
the ballot, and Stanford won quite
handily, one in landslide propor
tions and the other by a healthy
margin."
Schmidt said that the Menlo
Park voters who will be affected by
the Sand Hill construction opposed
the measure. He says he was not
surprised that the measures
passed, however.
"I never did see the campaign
reports," he said. "It would be in
teresting to see how much [money]
Stanford put into the campaign to
get the results."
Schmidt said that from his
standpoint the appeal doesn't seek
any changes other than to block the
University's "capacity to increase
the roadway."
He doesn't foresee further
changes in Menlo Park in the near
future.
"There will be more land hear
ings and more public scrutiny of
Stanford University land-use
plans," he said. "It's important for
the Stanford community to know.
Is this a business or an academic in
stitution?"
Jellins agreed that the appeal
will not affect the project. "There is
no basis for a judge, as far as I
know, to stop the project," he said.
