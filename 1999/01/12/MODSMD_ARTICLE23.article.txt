# Trading statecraft for a mortarboard
## Retired ambassador begins second career with a stint at Stanford 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
After concluding a 35-year career
in foreign service and diplomacy, Vis
iting Prof. Thomas Simons is trying
out teaching as a change of pace.
Simons' appointment at Stanford
is two-fold. As a visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution and the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control, he will be giving University
lectures and teaching a self-designed
undergraduate colloquium.
The main focus of the colloquium,
"Poland and Pakistan in the Post
communist World," merges Simons'
most recent areas of expertise. As an
officer in the U.S. State Department,
he served as Ambassador to Poland
from 1990 to 1993 and as Ambas
sador to Pakistan from 1996 to 1998.
Simons' 35 years as a diplomat
make the transition to Stanford an
appealing change. His three-year ap
pointment will give him the chance to
step back and look at his experiences
in order to sort out what it all means,
according to Simons.
"Most of the important experi
ences [in my life] took place over

seas," Simons said, whose interna
tional prowess began in Europe when
he was a mere seven-year-old. He
was sent to an overseas boarding
school while his father worked as a
foreign service officer.
"[The study of] history for me has
always been important in my life to
help me figure out what's happening
to me," he said.
Simons received a doctoral degree
from Harvard University in 1963,
with a specialty in West and Central
European history.
Along with history, Simons
demonstrates a keen interest in
teaching and students.
Nine years ago, he was the Diplo
mat in Residence at Brown Universi
ty. The State Department program
lets a foreign service officer spend a
year at a university with salary.
"They let me teach, since I have a
Ph.D," Simons said. The course
began at a crucial moment in history,
just after the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989. Expecting perhaps 10 students,
Simons entered class the first day to
an audience of 136.
Out of 86 students graded in the
class, 13 decided to travel to Eastern

Europe, according to Simons.
Simons now returns to teaching
after spending approximately half of
his foreign service career overseas.
He decided he would rather teach
than spend his post-government ca
reer doing fundraising or policymak
ing as the head of an institute, he said.
His colloquium will look at the
kinds of problems countries such as
Pakistan and Poland deal with as we
approach the 21st Century.
Simons' relevant expertise of
Poland and Pakistan is recent and
first-hand. He left Islamabad only last
August after dealing with the sudden
nuclear detonations in May.
"By teaching [the two countries]
together, we can address the kinds of
problems of turbulent states that be
came revolutionary," Simons said.
"Also, both countries have been sig
nificantly defined by our relationship
with the Soviet Union," he said, not
ing that the breakup of the USSR has
led the United States to question the
need for such relationships.
Students seem enthusiastic with
the prospect of such a highly experi
enced and well-travelled instructor.
"I'm interested in [Prof. Simons]

unique perspective, having been Am
bassador to both countries," said se
nior Kristin Strohmeier, a student in
the colloquium. "It seems it will be re
ally laid back — he said it would be a
learning experience for him as well,"
Strohmeier said.
"Stanford is lucky to have him,"
said History Prof. Norman Naimark,
who has known Simons since the late
19605. "He combines an interest and
proclivity towards academic life with
practical experience. He is a real
scholar and teacher on the one hand
and has enormous practical experi
ence in terms of diplomacy."
Simons admits he will miss the
support structure of government
work. But he is looking forward to the
new pace of California.
"Now I and the students are the
only structure I need," Simons said.
Adding that both he and his wife
come from families with impressively
long life expectancies, Simons ex
pressed enthusiasm for beginning a
new career path.
"I've still got another 30" years to
live, said the 60-year-old professor.
"I've got another life out there; I
might as well live it."
