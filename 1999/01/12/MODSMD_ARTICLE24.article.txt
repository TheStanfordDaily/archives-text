Recently unionized workers at
Stanford University Hospital and
Lucile Salter Packard Children's hos
pital elected a Id-member negotiat
ing committee and alternates Thurs
day. This committee will serve as a li
aison between the workers and the
hospital administration when the two
sides develop a new union contract.
The new committee, now in the
process of developing proposals for
the union's new contract with the
UCSF-Stanford Health Care admin
istration, represents nurse's assis
tants and hospital workers in depart
ments such as ambulatory surgery,
dietary services and housekeeping.
Service Employers International
Union, Local 715 will now train the
elected bargaining team. Committee
members will learn what to expect at
the table and what the bargaining
process is like. The training involves
an experienced negotiator, who will
also be present when the actual nego
tiations begin.
The hospital administrators have

nothing to do with the union's nego
tiating committee. "It's their negoti
ating committee. I have no idea what
they're planning to do," said Mike
Lassiter, a UCSF-Stanford hospital
administrator.
"We expect [the committee] to go
to the table in late January or early
February." said Danielle Mahones,
an organizer with Local 715.
According to Mahones' fellow
worker Loretta Johnson, workers
will elect stewards sometime in the
near future. Stewards fill a role that
differs from that of the negotiating
committee. I"hey are elected work
site representatives who deal with is
sues that arise at the workplace.
"[The stewards] will be the
union's eyes and ears at the work
place," Johnson said. "They get folks
to sign petitions and call meetings
when [these things are] necessary."
The hospital workers voted to
unionize last November. The move
ment to unionize was the result of the
merger of Stanford and UC-San
Francisco hospitals more than a year
agt) and a subsequent workload in
crease, workers said.
