### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
The dismissal last month of a 35-
year veteran of the Office of Under
graduate Admissions during its inter
nal reorganization has drawn criti
cism from some quarters.
John Bunnell, former associate
dean and director of undergraduate
admissions, was informed upon re
turning from a summer vacation that
the Admissions Office had been re
organized and his job eliminated.

Many have raised questions about
Bunnell's exit. According to an indi
vidual at Stanford, who has known
Bunnell for a long time, the situation
was handled "abysmally."
"John was No. 2 in that office for a
long time.'" said Bob Beyers, director
of Stanford News Service from 1%l
until 1990. "He was one of the most
loyal, dedicated workers around. He
was always a person of great integri
ty"
"There was never a public an
nouncement of the reorganization,"
Beyers said. "The information about
his departure has been systematically
bottled up and ignored."
According to Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions and Financial Aid
Robert Kinnally, the reorganization
of the office is still in progress. He de
clined further comment.
The University has not issued a
formal announcement about either
the reorganization or Bunnell's de
parture.
The annual report of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid issued to the Fac
ulty Senate on Oct. 15 contained no
reference to this restructuring or
Bunnell's dismissal.
Beyers and a source with knowl
edge of the report both indicate that a
reference to the reorganization and

the elimination of Bunnell's job was
included in an original draft of the re
port, but it was later deleted.
Education Prof. Edward Haertel,
current chair of the committee, was
unaware of a reference to the reorga
nization in any initial drafts.
Haertel stated that although the
committee was aware of the reorga
nization "personnel transitions are
not typical of the items in a commit
tee's report to the senate."
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, former dean of ad
missions, said that the annual report
focuses upon policy issues.
Montoya added that personnel
changes and restructuring are not un
common in administrative offices.
"Given our limited resources, it is
vital that an organization be struc
tured to take full advantage of the
available staffing."
From his Palo Alto home, Bun
nell, declined to comment on his
abrupt dismissal, focusing instead on
the future. He has tentative plans to

go into business with a former Stan
ford coach, doing college counseling
for high school student athletes.
"I've got a lot of energy and a lot
of things I still want to do," Bunnell
said. "I have an MBA. Maybe it's
time to dust that puppy off!"
Bunnell received his undergradu
ate degree in economics from Stan
ford in 1961. He earned an MBA in
1963 and a masters in education in
1965, both also from Stanford.
He was recognized with a special
citation by the Athletics Department
at Friday's women's basketball game.
The citation, issued by Athletic
Director Ted Leland. recognized
Bunnell for "dedicated service and
support" and his "instrumental role
in the remarkable success of Stan
ford's athletic program."
Bunnell put a lot of effort into his
relations with the Athletics Depart
ment, and he was very appreciative of
the citation he received. "It was spe
cial to me because of how close 1 have
become to the coaches and how

much I love Stanford athletics."
"John was sort of an anchor for
admissions," said Rixford Snyder,
dean of admissions from 1950 until
1979, who hired Bunnell in 1963.
Bunnell recalled that some of his
favorite moments in the admissions
office were "getting to know the stu
dents. The best example would be
meeting my future wife."
He met a young woman in charge
of commencement in June 1970,
while he was serving as an usher. He
returned to the office, looked up her
file and saw his handwritten note:
"Great girl, let's admit!"
"The rest," he said, "is history."
Many students recall the efforts
Bunnell made to reach out to them.
Junior Blake Thompson recalled
Bunnell visiting his freshman dorm
and sharing humourous stories from
the Admissions Office.
"1 thought it was really great that
he came out to the dorm and showed
an interest in the students he'd admit
ted," Thompson said.
