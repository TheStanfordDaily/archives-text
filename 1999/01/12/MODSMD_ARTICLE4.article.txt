Mayors Cristovam Buarque (left) of Brasilia, Brazil and Martin Burt of Asuncion,
Paraguay were among the panelists last night in Kresge Auditorium. The panel of may
ors from Latin America spoke on local innovation in urban policy.
Prof. Luis Fraga, the panel's modera
tor, said. "A new distinct type of lead
ership is now centered on setting re
alistic goals and meeting the long
term needs of the people."
Among the issues discussed were
corruption, violence, poverty, home
lessness, child labor and the econo
my.
Walther emphasized the impor
tance of dialogue with the people in
his city, Mexicali. "We need to be
able to translate people's hopes into
reality." he said.
He credited "Citizen Wednes
day," a weekly open forum where
people directly questioned the mayor
and other city officials, as one of his
successful policy innovations.
Echoing Walther. Azcueta,
mayor of Villa El Salvador, a shanty
town of 3()0,(XX) south of Lima. Peru,
said a sense of belief and identity is

most crucial for the city.
"It's not only the fact that we build
new avenues and bridges that matter.
It's the people that matters," he said.
"Our objective is to live with dignity,
work together, and each one of us
having our own responsibilities."
Buarque said the major problem
facing Brasilia rests in the inequality
and the clear division between high
and low income people. Approxi
mately 50,000 children could not go
to school full-time because they
needed need to work.
Using less than 1 percent of the
national budget, the city is now pay
ing these children to go to school.
Political struggle was also a heated
topic in the discussion. Burt, who de
scribed Paraguay as an isolationist
country, said the major issue the peo
ple face after the end of a dictatorship
is the "growing disillusionment with
democracy."
"When we had a dictatorship, the
government had authority. When we
have democracy, it's everybody," he

said.
Burt, as the leader of a capital city
in opposition to the national govern
ment, argued that the major goal is
now to convince people to take poli
cies into their own hands and make
their own decisions.
Being the mayor in Colombia, a
country with close to 50 years of guer
rilla warfare. Cuartas' job comes with
immediate physical dangers.
Traveling with no bodyguards and
having no weapons, Cuartas said this
is the only way to gain people's trust.
"Anybody who is seen with me is
seen as someone from another guer
rilla group," she said.
Cuartas remarked that she was
thankful that the Internet, radio and
television for spreading word of the
situation around the world.
Questions about economics were
also raised in the discussion.
McLean-Abaroa said with a bud
get of $40 million, the challenge fac
ing La Paz is increasing resources and
efficiency and reducing corruption.
