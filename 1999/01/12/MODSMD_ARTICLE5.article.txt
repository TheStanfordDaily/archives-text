# New language lab opens

Tucked in a corner of Meyer Li
brary's second floor is a virtual lan
guage Mecca. Stanford's new Digital
Language Lab opened in time for the
start of winter quarter classes.
The lab — now the most modern
high-tech space in the library — has
three separate areas. First, a large
drop-in room with 27 Intel comput
ers is available to all language stu

dents. Second, a computer classroom
houses 17 flat-screen Macintosh
computers for language course work.
Third, a seminar room is fitted with
Internet connections, a projection
system and audio equipment.
With its green and purple carpet,
pale orange doors and two navy easy
chairs, the lab is a welcome break
from Meyer's expanse of gray. Fresh
man Carolyn Kousky, coming out of
her French class, remarked, "I like

the colors."
German Studies Prof. Elizabeth
Bernhardt, director of the Stanford
Language Center, worked closely
with University libraries to modern
ize Stanford's language facilities.
"The wonderful part about the lab is
that the language programs are now
able to exploit all of the technology
that Stanford has to offer," Bern-

hardt said.
Bernhardt said she believes that
the new multimedia lab, by allowing
students to take tests and quizzes on
computers, will make instructional
time more efficient. She predicts it
will free up about 12 percent of class
time, or approximately six hours per
quarter, the equivalent of an extra
week of instruction.
The center's goal is to use this time
to increase students' oral proficiency
in the first two years of instruction.
"When students are in class they
need to be speaking, using the lan
guage with their professor," said

Bernhardt.
French Prof. Jane Dozer-Rabe
deau, coordinator of the French Lan
guage Program, is teaching her
French 3 class in the lab's conference
room. She plans to begin class use of
the computers next week, with oral
testing via computer-digitized speech
and a collection of CD-ROMs to help
students explore French-language
Web sites.
"Each new generation of students
that comes to Stanford is less techno
phobic," said Dozer-Rabedeau, yet
the potential for technical glitches re
mains. She recalled an earlier com
puter program that made all words in
quotation marks disappear, making
for rather dull dialogues.
"I'm afraid that some students will

panic with the technology," she said.
"But it enables us to make more cre
ative tests with digitized images and
sound bites and other testing mecha
nisms that aren't normally at our dis
posal."
While Dozer-Rabedeau finds
such integration exciting, she cau
tioned, "I'm not sure that we've mas
tered all the teaching methods that
come with new technology. We're
still defining our profession."
Pinar Ozcan, a junior in Dozer-
Rabedeau's French 3 class, looks for
ward to the use of computers as "def
initely something new" and is excited
about the computer's ability to cor
rect typing errors.
The lab is funded by a gift from the
University President's Fund, while

the Intel computers are part of an
Intel grant to the University library
system.
The lab puts Stanford at the fore
front of language technology and ex
emplifies the cooperation between li
braries and academic programs, ac
cording to Bernhardt.
"This is a wonderful example of
collaboration across the University,"
Bernhardt said. "The Language Cen
ter could never have brought this pro
ject to fruition without the coopera
tion of the libraries, and the libraries
benefit because it's a new use of tech
nology in their space."
This quarter the lab houses sever
al French, Swahili, Japanese and Chi
nese classes. Spanish and German
classes will be added this spring.
