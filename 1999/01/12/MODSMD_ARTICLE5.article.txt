Tucked in a corner of Meyer Li
brary's second floor is a virtual lan
guage Mecca. Stanford's new Digital
Language Lab opened in time for the
start of winter quarter classes.
The lab — now the most modern
high-tech space in the library — has
three separate areas. First, a large
drop-in room with 27 Intel comput
ers is available to all language stu

dents. Second, a computer classroom
houses 17 flat-screen Macintosh
computers for language course work.
Third, a seminar room is fitted with
Internet connections, a projection
system and audio equipment.
With its green and purple carpet,
pale orange doors and two navy easy
chairs, the lab is a welcome break
from Meyer's expanse of gray. Fresh
man Carolyn Kousky, coming out of
her French class, remarked, "I like

the colors."
German Studies Prof. Elizabeth
Bernhardt, director of the Stanford
Language Center, worked closely
with University libraries to modern
ize Stanford's language facilities.
"The wonderful part about the lab is
that the language programs are now
able to exploit all of the technology
that Stanford has to offer," Bern-
