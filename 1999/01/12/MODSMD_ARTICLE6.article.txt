# Stanford group reproduces ancient works in new medium
## Sculpting in cyberspace

Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Marc Levoy has applied his discipline to something not
usually associated with high-tech modeling —
Michelangelo's "David."
A team of Stanford graduate and undergraduate
computer science students is spending the 1998-99 aca
demic year in Florence, working to create highly accu
rate three-dimensional models of some of Michelan
gelo's most famous sculptures.
For many of these students, the Digital Michelan
gelo Project is "the perfect opportunity to go overseas
and do something relevant to [their] major," according
to team member Alex Roctter, a junior interested in
computer graphics.
Levoy, who received his undergraduate degree in
architecture, conceived of the Digital Michelangelo
Project — the first large-scale digitalization project of
3-D objects in the world — while contemplating how
to spend his sabbatical year. "Once I latched onto the
idea of digitizing statues during my sabbatical year. I
naturally looked for a project with high visibility."
Levoy says.
The research team is housed in a temporary com
puter graphics laboratory next to the Stanford in Flo
rence center. Using three computer-controlled laser
scanners, the team plans to merge images of "David"
from different perspectives into a single, seamless, in
credibly detailed representation of one of the greatest
works of the Renaissance.
Things did not go as smoothly as expected when the
team discovered that "David" was actually 17 feet tall,
about three feel taller than art history books claim.
The discrepancy forced team members to reconfigure
the scanners at the last minute.
The team also intends to scan another Michelangc
lo sculpture in Florence. "The Unfinished Slaves." The
three laser scanners, with their different imaging ad
vantages, are so technologically sophisticated that
Michelangelo's chisel marks will be discernible on this

virtual statue. Researchers have never attempted to
record the shape and color of an object at so fine a
scale before.
From Florence the team will move on to Rome,
where it intends to scan Michelangelo's "Pieta" and
"Moses."

The custom-built, 8-foot-tall Large Statue Scanner
in use by the Digital Michelangelo Project scans an
image of the project's test statue.
There Levoy will also attempt
solve a 500-year-old archaeologi
cal puzzle: the reconstruction of
the "Forma Urbis Romae," an an
cient mosaic map of Rome. The 60-
by 45-foot marble map, circa A.D.
200, details second-century Rome.
Only 15 percent of the original
map remains, and the challenge of
piecing together the remaining
1,000 fragments lies partly in the
fact that some weigh as much as
100 pounds.
"Fitting could be based on 3-D
shape, marble veining and other
cues that only a computer can take
advantage of," Levoy says.
Wired magazine included
Levoy in a list of 25 people "at
tempting the impossible" for trying
to solve this classic archaeological
problem.
When asked if his path-break

ing work in digital scanning will re-"
suit in virtual Louvres or Smithso-*,'
nians, Levoy said, "I have no idea.jj
There are things that
graphics representations lack that»*
museums have. You can't walk J
around objects; you can't feel their ;
size relative to your size."
"More and more frequently we •
see computer technology moving •
into more fuzzy realms, but I think ♦
it's a great way to bring art to the •
masses. The Smithsonian has put -
some of its collections on CD
ROM," noted team member Wal
lace Huang, a senior minoring in
studio art.
"Things that couldn't be seen by
the general public now can. For
me, that's the biggest motivation,"
he explained.
The $1.5-million endeavor is
being financed by the Interval Re
search Corporation and the Allen
Foundation for the Arts, one of
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's
charitable organizations.
