# Stanford group reproduces ancient works in new medium
## Sculpting in cyberspace

Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Marc Levoy has applied his discipline to something not
usually associated with high-tech modeling —
Michelangelo's "David."
A team of Stanford graduate and undergraduate
computer science students is spending the 1998-99 aca
demic year in Florence, working to create highly accu
rate three-dimensional models of some of Michelan
gelo's most famous sculptures.
For many of these students, the Digital Michelan
gelo Project is "the perfect opportunity to go overseas
and do something relevant to [their] major," according
to team member Alex Roctter, a junior interested in
computer graphics.
Levoy, who received his undergraduate degree in
architecture, conceived of the Digital Michelangelo
Project — the first large-scale digitalization project of
3-D objects in the world — while contemplating how
to spend his sabbatical year. "Once I latched onto the
idea of digitizing statues during my sabbatical year. I
naturally looked for a project with high visibility."
Levoy says.
The research team is housed in a temporary com
puter graphics laboratory next to the Stanford in Flo
rence center. Using three computer-controlled laser
scanners, the team plans to merge images of "David"
from different perspectives into a single, seamless, in
credibly detailed representation of one of the greatest
works of the Renaissance.
Things did not go as smoothly as expected when the
team discovered that "David" was actually 17 feet tall,
about three feel taller than art history books claim.
The discrepancy forced team members to reconfigure
the scanners at the last minute.
The team also intends to scan another Michelangc
lo sculpture in Florence. "The Unfinished Slaves." The
three laser scanners, with their different imaging ad
vantages, are so technologically sophisticated that
Michelangelo's chisel marks will be discernible on this

virtual statue. Researchers have never attempted to
record the shape and color of an object at so fine a
scale before.
From Florence the team will move on to Rome,
where it intends to scan Michelangelo's "Pieta" and
"Moses."
