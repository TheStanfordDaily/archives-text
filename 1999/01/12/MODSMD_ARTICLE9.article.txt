FOR THE RECORD
A story and graphic on the growth of foreign student enrollment at
Stanford in Friday's Daily did not take into account a change in
the definition of "foreign student" since 1987. Using the current
definition (which excludes U.S. permanent residents), the number
of foreign undergraduate students in 1987 would be about 210, and
the number of foreign graduate students about 1400, making the
growth of foreign students even larger than originally reported.
The Daily regrets the error.
