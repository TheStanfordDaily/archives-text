Now available at the Stanford Bookstore,
the final and eagerly awaited volume of the trilogy that includes
The Last Picture Show & Texasville
Larry HcHurtry s Duane s Depressed
Here is McMurtry's strongest and
most appealing "contemporary''
novel since the much acclaimed
Terms of Endearment— the work
of a powerful, mature artist, with
a deep understanding of the
human condition, a profound
ability to write about small-town
life, and perhaps the surest touch
of any American novelist for the
tangled feelings that bind and
separate men and women.
Set in Thalia, Texas, the small town that McMurtry literally put on the map when he wrote the Last
Picture Show, Duane's Depressed follows those of the characters who have survived into their twilight
years, when Duane is confronting depression in the midst of plenty. Surrounded by his children, who all
seem to be going through life crises involving sex, drugs, and violence; his wife, Karla, who is wrestling
with tier own demons; and friends like Sonny, who seem to be dying, Duane can't seem to make sense of
his life anymore. Utterly unsentimental, often hilarious, sometimes tragic and shocking, and in the end full
of hope, Duane 's Depressed is one of McMurtry's strongest novels, a major work of art by any standard.
