Bradley announces presidential bid Jordan set to retire

WASHINGTON (AP) — Just a month after
forming a presidential exploratory committee, for
mer New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley officially stepped
into the race for the White House yesterday by fil
ing a statement of candidacy v\ ith the Federal Elec
tion Commission.
The Bill Bradley Presidential Exploratory Com
mittee thus becomes the Bill Bradley for President
Campaign, and Bradley joins Vice President Al
Gore in the race for the Democratic nomination.
In forming his exploratory committee Dec. 4.
Bradley left little doubt he would run. The former
New York Knicks basketball star and three-term
senator has already made fund-raising trips to Cal
ifornia and elsewhere and lias assembled a cam
paign staff.
A press release from his campaign said Bradley
plans a formal public announcement of his candi
dacy by early spring. He had no public schedule
today and was not immediately available for com
ment.
Bradley, 55. has carried the presidential aspira
tions of his supporters since his college days as a
star basketball player and student at Princeton Uni
versity. Supporters hoped he would run in 1 9«SS and
again in 1992, but Bradley demurred.

CHICAGO (AP) — For six months, Michael
Jordan teased, taunted and tantalized a nation
awaiting his answer.
At last, he appears to have one.
The greatest player in the histor\ of professional
basketball and the most popular athlete since
Muhammad Ali is expected to announce his retire
ment Wednesday, a source with close ties to the
National Basketball Association told The Associat
ed Press on Monday night.
"This is a man who truly, as far as I'm concerned,
is the modern-day Babe Ruth," Los Angeles Lakers
vice president Jerry West said recently.
A number of factors — his age (35), a new coach,
a picture-perfect ending last season as the Chicago
Bulls captured their sixth title with Jordan, the labor
dispute that delayed this season — appear to have
influenced his decision.
He is expected to leave the game when he's at
the top, the way he said he would. Besides the six
titles, the five-time league Most Valuable Player led
the NBA in scoring 10 times in 13 seasons and aver
aged 31.5 points per game, best in league history.
Jordan did not return a message and Bulls owner
Jerry Reinsdorf declined comment. The retirement
story was reported by several media organizations.
