# Clinton allocates money for conservation
## Funding a greener America 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — President Clinton
unveiled a plan yesterday to triple spending in an effort
to preserve vulnerable lands from the California desert
to the Florida Everglades.
"Our population is growing, our cities are growing,
our commitment to conservation must grow as well,"
Clinton said in announcing the $1-billion spending pro
posal during a ceremony at the National Arboretum.
The "land-legacy initiative" to be included in the fis
cal 2(XX) budget Clinton will send to Congress next week
was the second major environmental initiative by the
administration in as many days.
It calls for adding thousands of acres to the system of
federally protected lands and providing states with near
ly $6(X) million for land preservation. Touting the feder
al budget surplus and the steady economy. Clinton said:
"We'll never have a better time to act."
Among the protected areas that would be expanded
under the plan are the Joshua Tree National Park in Cal
ifornia and the Florida Everglades, Clinton said.
The announcement comes a day after Vice President
A 1 Gore unveiled a separate program that proposes to
use $7(X) million in tax credits to finance a $10 billion
bond program aimed at creating suburban parks, green
ways and other open space.
That proposal was aimed at dealing with suburban
sprawl, while the new initiative is directed at restoring
and protecting undeveloped, but vulnerable, forests.

grasslands, beaches and marine sanctuaries, officials said.
Environmentalists long have urged the administra
tion to increase land purchases to protect such lands
from commercial exploitation.
Congress more than three decades ago created a land
and water conservation fund that authorized spending as
much as $<XX) million a year to buy land for conservation.
But in most years only about a third of that money was
ever provided and during the Reagan administration
land purchases were put on hold.
This year Congress provided about $320 million for
federal land purchases.
Clinton's proposal calls for full funding of the pro
gram and would funnel millions of dollars more — for a
total of over $1 billion a year — into land preservation.
The Interior Department at one point had sought as
much as $3 billion for the program, but that proposal was
rebuffed as too extravagant by the White House Office
of Management and Budget, according to sourcts
knowledgeable about the internal discussions.
The package to be sent to Congress as part of the
budget will include $442 million to buy inholdings at
national parks and historically or environmentally signif
icant parcels that might otherwise be threatened.
An additional $588 million would be provided to
states to buy land or work with private parties to create
conservation easements or private land trusts, officials
said.
