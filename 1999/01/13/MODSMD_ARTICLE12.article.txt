The first two weeks at the
start of eaeh quarter make
Stanford class scheduling
confusing — and unique

Another quarter has
dawned, and many of us arc still
rearranging our class schedules as
we compare course offerings. Our friends at
other universities knew what they were tak
ing months ago; we shop now and still have
five more days until wc commit ourselves to
any classes. Professors and administrators
alike lament the shopping period, hut we
defend its usefulness and flexibility.
The most common argument against the
two-week shopping period is that it effec
tively shortens the quarter. Professors hesi
tate to hand out assignments because new
students might walk in the door at the next
class meeting totally unprepared. While
class sizes fluctuate and teaching assistants
wrestle with section schedules, the first two
weeks of the quarter serve as administrative
time, leaving no room for academics.
While it may seem that the shopping
period is ;i major inconvenience, in practice,
professors have found numerous ways to
overcome early-quarter difficulties. Posting
sign ups during the quarter before a class is
offered allows professors to estimate class
sizes and get some commitment from stu
dents. Requiring students to apply for
courses takes this idea one step further,
allowing professors to determine both class
size and composition.
And those who say the shopping period

prevents professors from assigning work in
the first two weeks of the quarter should
reread their class syllabi. Most students are
already dutifully writing, reading, program
ming and doing problem sets. From a stu
dent's perspective, the academic quarter is
well underway.
The shopping period is one of the few
quirky institutions that makes Stanford
unique. Our university's watchword is flex
ibility; diversity is a time-honored Stanford
tradition. We cherish our options in every
thing from housing to interdisciplinary
majors that let us choose classes from
numerous departments.
Admittedly, students would still have
the same class options if they picked cours
es earlier. But the shopping period allows
students to compare professors and work
loads to make more educated choices about
their classes. It's similar to choosing, say, a
university. One might be able to make a
rational choice between I larvard and Stan
ford without ever visiting either campus,
but spending time at both has no doubt
helped many Stanford students make a
more informed choice.
Of course, with only 10 weeks of learn
ing packed into one quarter, every day
counts. And as much as we hate to do this,
we must point out that Dead Week is no
exception. Year after year, we bemoan the
irrelevance of Dead Week: how dead is it if
we have term papers and projects due?
Students should realize, however, that
life is full of tradeoffs. We cherish our flex
ibility during the shopping period; in return,
we must allow professors some flexibility in
scheduling due dates during Dead Week.
