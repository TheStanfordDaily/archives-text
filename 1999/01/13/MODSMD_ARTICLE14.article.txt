Geyser's column trivial
ized issue of race
I was completely offended by Dan
Geyser's article in yesterday's Daily, as well
as his article on Kwanzaa.
Cieyser trivializes the issue of race by
saying that it is something that people take
too seriously.
I don't want to bring it back to the days
of slavery and the opression that people of
color have suffered in the United States,
because we all are well aware of this coun
try's history. Hut I think that Dan can easi
ly take this postion of racelessness in our
"imperfect environment" because he does
not constantly have to be reminded that he
is "different."
As for "that word." perhaps Dan should
think a little bit longer before writing that
nobody wants to talk or think about it.
Within the black community, that is a real
and very much discussed issue. It has to be.
by virtue of the fact that it is derogatorily
targeted towards blacks.
Only when he has experienced the harsh
realities that people of color have to deal
with in America, California, or even at
Stanford, would it be even remotely OK for
him to print the word "N-r" and tell me to
deal with it.

Bike paths sorely needed
For a student on the Stanford campus,
bike accidents and near-misses are as übiq
uitous as palm trees. A few months ago I
was involved in a minor accident and
emerged more damaged in pride than in
body. However. I have witnessed and heard
of more serious encounters. Students seem
to lose their smarts behind the handlebars
of a l()-speed, which is why I propose adopt
ing a simple solution which would make
transportation on campus much more sane.
The idea comes from UC-Davis. They
have painted bike lanes through the busiest
parts of campus to direct bike traffic and
separate it from pedestrians. The lanes
function as a road where all bikes (and
other wheeled traffic) going in the same
direction move together, instead of the
free-for-all that is White Plaza.
There are places where this would
detract from aesthetics —in the Main
Ouad for example. However, even starting
with the biggest danger zones — the alleys
outside the Ouad. between the Language
and History Corners and Green / Cubber
ley, and between the Geo and Psych cor
ners and the new SEO area, as well as
White Plaza — would be an easy, effective
way to prevent bodily harm and make get
ting around campus much more pleasant.
