## Friends in alternate dimensions 
### 
SOME DAYS YOU
wake up and know
that something is
amiss. Odd events that
have no place in a sensible
universe occur one after
the other. You suspect
that you have somehow

stumbled into an alternate dimension — a
parallel universe similar to our own in many
respects but just slightly off the mark. I'his
is my world; this is where 1 thrive. Welcome
to Dimension /•' — the "F' is for Fabulous.
The native inhabitants of Dimension /•
are easy to pick out. /'-People have peculiar
habits and colorful traits. They eat breakfast
for dinner and don't care much for Hootie
and the Blowfish. They say bizarre things
such as, "You're the cat's pajamas" and
"Actually, I prefer Wally to the Beav."
They're a strange lot.
As it turns out. most of the people I
know are F-People. I have this one friend —
call him "Peiffer" — whose humility is so
profound that it verges on painful insecuri
ty. If you pay him a compliment, he
becomes violently ill, avoids eye contact
and refuses to shower for weeks on end. But
we tolerate his eccentricities because he is a
generous fellow who is always willing to
offer you a ride, a meal or use of his vinyl
pants.
When 1 first met my friend "Megan," she
gave me a warm smile and a rigid stare and
said, "I'm going to freak you." I didn't know
what she meant by this, so I instantly
became worried. For the next few days, I

was on my guard — uncertain whether she
would freak me as I walked down the street,
freak me from behind or freak me with the
relentless fury of a banshee. She never fol
lowed through on her threat, so I didn't
learn what freaking involved until years
later when I saw her dancing next to a
wooden support beam, shaking her goods
to an unheard beat. As she was bumping
and grinding up against the pillar — at an
intimate but safe distance — she proudly
chanted, "I'm freaking it! I'm freaking it!"
That's classic Dimension F.
I suspect that my housemates are F-Peo
ple as well. When my housemates "Tony"
and "Chris" get excited, they speak in a ver
nacular inappropriate to their cultural back
grounds. 1 told them that I was writing a col
umn about them, and they insisted that I
talk about the model train set that they are
building in our kitchen nook. I transcribed
their tag-team diatribe as best I could.
Chris: For this most flimflamyulated
Christmas, me and the T-dogg got a model
train set. Now you college types may be
like, "Trains was cool back in the day, but 1
done moved on. CI." Well, check it! Leave it
at the door and make sure you got a dollar.
I'm here to tell you. we got a Union Pacific
pulling caboose through that big unused
space over by the back porch. Remember
where Clovelle's girlfriend fell down during
J-dogg's birthday party? Yeah, that's the
spot.
Tony: And this is some large hobby! Our
main man Ed at the hobby shop tipped us

off on the whole Athearn / KPCE coupler
debate, and ever since then we've been
loyal customers. All I can say is, if you ever
see Ed down at the Nut House, put one on
your tab for him. He is the old man from the
South who wears brown slacks with a plaid
Chaps shirt and is mostly bald on the top of
his head.
Chris: So you've been through the whole
train thing before, or maybe you've seen
pictures of people who do trains in maga
zines from when you was young, like back
when you were listening to Earth Wind and
Fire or whatever, and all the people in the
articles have this hair that looks like they
combed it with a pancake. I know where
you are — I was there once, too. And a stiff
bottle of rye helped me get out of that place.
Tony: I once loved a girl so intensely that
1 could never say anything to her for fear of
saying the wrong thing and ruining the only
chance I ever had at poetic, timeless bliss.
Chris: Anyway, this train thing is great.
The first thing you have to do is plan your
layout (how the track will sit), and then you
can start planning the aesthetics (how the
scenery will look). The rest is easy.
Tony: Yo.
Maybe you have friends like these; maybe
you don't. If not, 1 recommend coming to
Dimension F. It's a wonderful place filled
with Fabulous People. I'll see you there.
