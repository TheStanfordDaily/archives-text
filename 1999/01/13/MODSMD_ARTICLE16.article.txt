# Deep Thoughts
## Brittney Jensen Looking for laughs — in all the wrong places 
### 
LAST QUARTER I took an acting
class, Drama 121 C: "The Craft of
Comedy." In the class, we practiced
being funny. The class was small, and we
all got to know each other quite well.
We spent a lot of time playing various
improvisation games. Although the teach
ers encouraged us to be dramatically true
to our characters and situations regardless
of the humorous results, there was an
unspoken pressure among the classmates
to be funny, especially among the male
members of the class. Sometimes the guys
would bicker, accusing each other of
thinking they were funny when they really
weren't.
I personally thought everyone was
funny. I also laugh for hours after watch
ing "Saved by the Bell."
But for the discerning audience, how
can one be funny? Can funniness be
taught in a class? Or is it a talent you're
born with, like being able to pick your
nose with your tongue?
There are contradictory theories on the
subject. Some say that only ugly people

are funny because they must compensate
for their unattractiveness, while hot peo
ple just sit there looking hot. But the pres
ence of hunk comedians such as Bob Saget
negates this assertion.
Some people think the best comedians
take crack; then they get fat and die. Is it
possible to be healthy, hot and funny? To
answer this question, I explored a few
common techniques for being funny.
Discuss bodily functions, such as poop
ing and phlegm. The word "fart" is inher
ently funny. So are fart noises. You might
think it's funny, but I think it's snot!
Speak in a weird voice. Use a Scottish
or redneck accent. If you're a guy, speak in
a girl voice. Ha ha.
Utilize the rule of threes. Say two nor
mal things, then something wacky. Set up
a pattern, then disturb it. For example,
"For breakfast I ate toast, eggs and Elvis'
right toenail."
Quote funny movies. Then you'll be
funny. Everyone wants to hear you recite
"Austin Powers" and "Billy Madison"
over and over again. There is one draw

back to this technique: Your fans will be
disillusioned when they actually watch the
quoted material and realize you did not
invent the finger-to-the mouth pose. Trick
the contemporary movie audience by
going old-school, a la "Spaceballs" or
"Airplane." I personally recommend
"UHF," starring Weird A 1 and Kramer
and featuring such classic moments as the
"Wheel of Fish" and "Conan the Librari
an" as the ultimate source for funniness.
Goats and sheep are inherently funny.
Once a Stanford Tree won his revered
position solely because he brought an
actual live goat to the final selection pro
cess. If you can't find a real goat, an inflat
able one will suffice, or even an inflatable
penguin. Implying human-goat romantic
relations is hilarious.
Use the phrase "yo' mamma," i.e.. "Yo'
mamma's so ugly, her Rice Krispies won't
even talk to her." or "Yo' mamma's so fat
that when she put on a red dress the kids
thought the Kool-Aid Man came to their
party." Discuss your amorous encounters
with other people's mothers, grandmoth-

ers or even little sisters. Tell people the
troop ships rejected their mothers.
Refer to people as prostitutes.
Although we learned from the traumatic
rejection-on-Rodeo-Drive scene in "Pret
ty Woman" that prostitution has its rough
moments, it is always funny to call some
one a whore. Unless he or she is really a
whore. Then it's just mean.
Dance funny. Do bad '80s dances, like
the Cabbage Patch Kid, Roger Rabbit, or,
if you can master it, the Kid 'n' Play. Sag
your pants and dance like you're a gang
ster. But remember, violence is never
funnv — unless it involves a rubber chick
en, which doesn't really hurt anyway.
Insult the Stanford post office. Kappa
Sig, comm majors and Kwanzaa.
You're even funnier when you're
drunk. Come home smashed from parties
at 3:()0 a.m.. call everyone you know and
sing Whitney Houston medleys to them. If
they hang up, go to their room and pre
tend you're a rock, a barking seal or
Queen Elizabeth in her tomb. Refuse to
leave until they join you in a German ren

dition of "One Moment in Time."
Tell jokes that display how smart you
are by referring to obscure sources. There
are literary and historical allusions that
most intelligent people understand, such
as those found in "Simpsons" episodes,
but you must take your intellectual humor
to a more esoteric level. Even if only fel
low SLE-mates understand the joke,
everyone else will think you're really cool.
While you're reading this column, a lit
tle voice inside your head might be saying,
"This isn't funny!" That observation
brings me to the most important part of
being funny: Choose your audience wisely.
Certain people will laugh at anything.
Recommended listeners include your
mom, drunks, crazy people, and, if you're
a guy, younger girls who think you're hot.
Funniness, like beauty and body odor, is in
the eye of the beholder. I think you're all
funnv.
