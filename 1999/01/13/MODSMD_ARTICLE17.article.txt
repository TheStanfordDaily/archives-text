## Abolished League's folding proves costly for stars of Stanford's past and present 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
On Dec. 22,1998, one-third of the
way through its third season, the
American Basketball League folded
its tent, packed its bags and raised the
white flag. Filing for bankruptcy pro
tection under Chapter 11, co-founder
Gary Cavalli decided the journey was
over.
The nation's newspapers shouted
the sudden announcement across
their headlines and the air waves
buzzed as sports call-in shows ana
lyzed the league's failure.
Then, as time passed by, the re
porters moved on to cover NBA con
tract negotiations, the radio broad
casters resumed their discussions
over the possible reinstatement of in
stant replay in the Nil and 1998
came to a close.
Yet. for women's basketball play
ers across the country and around the
globe, the New Year did not whisk
away the problems at hand.
As the university with the most
representatives in the ABL. Stan
ford's stake in this event is perhaps
greater than most. Roth current and
former players, as well as Stanford's
women's head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. must confront this issue
not just the folding of C avalli's enter
prise, but also the impact it has on
women's professional basketball in
the United States.
The news struck sudden and deep.
For former Stanford star and Nai
smith National Player of the Year
Kate Starbird, the news was unoffi
cially waiting on her message ma
chine, accompanied by a barrage of
apologies. Kate Paye, who played
with Starbird at both Stanford and in
the ABF. discovered the news when
her "friend just happened to click on
the CBS Sports" Web page. A third
former Stanford player, Val Whiting,
heard the news from a reporter.

To them, as to most, this issue was
more than just a financial problem. It
was their livelihood, their passion,
their dream.
"I was very disappointed, very
upset," Paye said. The ABL"wasmy
life, professionally, socially [and] to
have someone take it away with the
snap of a finger was very unsettling.
The ABL's ideas and principles were
legitimate and important."
It's easy to understand why the
players' commitment to the league
was so strong. Founded in October of
19%, the ABL pioneered the first
women's professional basketball
league and fought to bring it into the
American spotlight.
Many players, including seven
members of VanDerveer's 1996
Olympic team and a core group of
Stanford stars, signed on to the
league in its beginning days.
"I was very proud to be an ABL
player. They treated their players ex
ceptionally well," said Starbird, who
played for the Seattle Reign."I really
believed in what it was about and 1
wanted to be a part of it."
However, the league fought an
uphill battle. Struggling to land con
tracts with the major television net
works and compete against the si
multaneous seasons of the NBA as
well as collegiate basketball, the
league faced a number of obstacles.
Then came the NBA-owned
Women's National Basketball Asso
ciation. Although the quality of play
was arguably less than that in the
ABL. the WNBA soared. With bud
gets nearly five times that of the ABL
and television contracts bringing the
league to millions of homes across
the country, the ABL quickly be
came overshadowed.
With 14 players in the ABL and
four playeis in the WNBA. Stanford
sat on both sides of the fence.
Although they both strove to pro
