## Abolished League's folding proves costly for stars of Stanford's past and present 
### Nathan Christensen Contributing writer 
On Dec. 22,1998, one-third of the
way through its third season, the
American Basketball League folded
its tent, packed its bags and raised the
white flag. Filing for bankruptcy pro
tection under Chapter 11, co-founder
Gary Cavalli decided the journey was
over.
The nation's newspapers shouted
the sudden announcement across
their headlines and the air waves
buzzed as sports call-in shows ana
lyzed the league's failure.
Then, as time passed by, the re
porters moved on to cover NBA con
tract negotiations, the radio broad
casters resumed their discussions
over the possible reinstatement of in
stant replay in the Nil and 1998
came to a close.
Yet. for women's basketball play
ers across the country and around the
globe, the New Year did not whisk
away the problems at hand.
As the university with the most
representatives in the ABL. Stan
ford's stake in this event is perhaps
greater than most. Roth current and
former players, as well as Stanford's
women's head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. must confront this issue
not just the folding of C avalli's enter
prise, but also the impact it has on
women's professional basketball in
the United States.
The news struck sudden and deep.
For former Stanford star and Nai
smith National Player of the Year
Kate Starbird, the news was unoffi
cially waiting on her message ma
chine, accompanied by a barrage of
apologies. Kate Paye, who played
with Starbird at both Stanford and in
the ABF. discovered the news when
her "friend just happened to click on
the CBS Sports" Web page. A third
former Stanford player, Val Whiting,
heard the news from a reporter.

To them, as to most, this issue was
more than just a financial problem. It
was their livelihood, their passion,
their dream.
"I was very disappointed, very
upset," Paye said. The ABL"wasmy
life, professionally, socially [and] to
have someone take it away with the
snap of a finger was very unsettling.
The ABL's ideas and principles were
legitimate and important."
It's easy to understand why the
players' commitment to the league
was so strong. Founded in October of
19%, the ABL pioneered the first
women's professional basketball
league and fought to bring it into the
American spotlight.
Many players, including seven
members of VanDerveer's 1996
Olympic team and a core group of
Stanford stars, signed on to the
league in its beginning days.
"I was very proud to be an ABL
player. They treated their players ex
ceptionally well," said Starbird, who
played for the Seattle Reign."I really
believed in what it was about and 1
wanted to be a part of it."
However, the league fought an
uphill battle. Struggling to land con
tracts with the major television net
works and compete against the si
multaneous seasons of the NBA as
well as collegiate basketball, the
league faced a number of obstacles.
Then came the NBA-owned
Women's National Basketball Asso
ciation. Although the quality of play
was arguably less than that in the
ABL. the WNBA soared. With bud
gets nearly five times that of the ABL
and television contracts bringing the
league to millions of homes across
the country, the ABL quickly be
came overshadowed.
With 14 players in the ABL and
four playeis in the WNBA. Stanford
sat on both sides of the fence.
Although they both strove to pro

mote women's professional basket
ball, the leagues were forced to com
pete for sponsors, investors, players
and, perhaps most importantly, fans.
When the situation was evaluated
at the end of the calendar year, the
ABL's executives decided it was fi
nally time to abandon ship. The
league had been unable to lake ad
vantage of the NBA lockout and had
failed to compete for media exposure
with the WNBA.
"It was kind of like a David versus
Goliath thing," Whiting said.
Yet while Whiting's analogy illus
trates the mismatch of resources and
power, it oversimplifies the two
leagues' good-and-evil relationship.
Many believe that the new focus
on the WNBA could have positive
impacts on the saga of women's pro
fessional basketball in America.
Money- The NBA-backed

WNBA can dip deep into the pockets
of the NBA to keep its league in the
spotlight. It has used financial power
and market legitimacy to propel itself
onto major television networks and
continues to expand geographically.
Publicity- Launching campaigns
that have landed its team logos on the
back of kids' sweatshirts and the sides
of buses, the WNBA has become
much more of a household name.
The Game- Gradually adding to
its stock of skilled players, the league
has continued to develop a stable fan
base. The WNBA is closing in on an
average of 11 ,(XX) fans per game, an
impressive number when compared
to the ABL's average of 4,333.
"It's tough on many of the athletes
because there aren't going to be as
many spots," Starbird said.
Paye also expressed her concern
for the ABL players' situation.
"In the future I hope that the
WNBA evolves into a combination
of the best aspects of the ABL and
WNBA," she said.

Many will be rethinking their bas
ketball careers and their futures.
Manyy will try to break into that
other league.
"I am looking forward to [finding
a new home with the WNBA]," Star
bird said. "The last game 1 played [in
the ABL] was in Nashville. It looked
like KXJ" people were in attendance.
However, the path to the WNBA
will not be easy. Players, new and old,
will have to compete for a suddenly
diminished number of roster slots.
While former ABL players will cer
tainly be struggling to compete for
spots on WNBA teams, the toughest
strain will fall on those players who
still play in the NCAA.
VanDerveer, who has seen count
less numbers of talented players
chase after their dreams, predicts that
women playing basketball at the col
legiate level will now be faced with a
similar set of circumstances to those
before the ABL held the first profes
sional draft.
Regan Freuen, currently Stan

ford's only senior, sees that the shift.
"We still don't know the stability
because the [WNBA] is still new. It
puts more of an emphasis on getting
your education and something to fall
back on," Freuen said.
Players can no long expect to be
able to use their prowess on the court
to feed their families.
With the hope that professional
basketball will be in her near future,
Starbird plans to utilize a Stanford
degree in computer science and re
turn to Palo Alto in order to help a
friend start a company.
Paye also hopes to continue her
career on the court, but is in the
process of applying to both business
school and law school.
So now, as the WNBA takes the
forefront of professional women's
basketball and undoubtedly expands,
the impact this change has in
women's professional sports touches
the lives, careers and dreams of many
of those who have propelled Stan
ford's program in recent years.

former players, as well as Stanford's
women's head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. must confront this issue
not just the folding of C avalli's enter
prise, but also the impact it has on
women's professional basketball in
the United States.
The news struck sudden and deep.
For former Stanford star and Nai
smith National Player of the Year
Kate Starbird, the news was unoffi
cially waiting on her message ma
chine, accompanied by a barrage of
apologies. Kate Paye, who played
with Starbird at both Stanford and in
the ABF. discovered the news when
her "friend just happened to click on
the CBS Sports" Web page. A third
former Stanford player, Val Whiting,
heard the news from a reporter.

To them, as to most, this issue was
more than just a financial problem. It
was their livelihood, their passion,
their dream.
"I was very disappointed, very
upset," Paye said. The ABL"wasmy
life, professionally, socially [and] to
have someone take it away with the
snap of a finger was very unsettling.
The ABL's ideas and principles were
legitimate and important."
It's easy to understand why the
players' commitment to the league
was so strong. Founded in October of
19%, the ABL pioneered the first
women's professional basketball
league and fought to bring it into the
American spotlight.
Many players, including seven
members of VanDerveer's 1996
Olympic team and a core group of
Stanford stars, signed on to the
league in its beginning days.
"I was very proud to be an ABL
player. They treated their players ex
ceptionally well," said Starbird, who
played for the Seattle Reign."I really
believed in what it was about and 1
wanted to be a part of it."
However, the league fought an
uphill battle. Struggling to land con
tracts with the major television net
works and compete against the si
multaneous seasons of the NBA as
well as collegiate basketball, the
league faced a number of obstacles.
Then came the NBA-owned
Women's National Basketball Asso
ciation. Although the quality of play
was arguably less than that in the
ABL. the WNBA soared. With bud
gets nearly five times that of the ABL
and television contracts bringing the
league to millions of homes across
the country, the ABL quickly be
came overshadowed.
With 14 players in the ABL and
four playeis in the WNBA. Stanford
sat on both sides of the fence.
Although they both strove to pro

mote women's professional basket
ball, the leagues were forced to com
pete for sponsors, investors, players
and, perhaps most importantly, fans.
When the situation was evaluated
at the end of the calendar year, the
ABL's executives decided it was fi
nally time to abandon ship. The
league had been unable to lake ad
vantage of the NBA lockout and had
failed to compete for media exposure
with the WNBA.
"It was kind of like a David versus
Goliath thing," Whiting said.
Yet while Whiting's analogy illus
trates the mismatch of resources and
power, it oversimplifies the two
leagues' good-and-evil relationship.
Many believe that the new focus
on the WNBA could have positive
impacts on the saga of women's pro
fessional basketball in America.
Money- The NBA-backed

WNBA can dip deep into the pockets
of the NBA to keep its league in the
spotlight. It has used financial power
and market legitimacy to propel itself
onto major television networks and
continues to expand geographically.
Publicity- Launching campaigns
that have landed its team logos on the
back of kids' sweatshirts and the sides
of buses, the WNBA has become
much more of a household name.
The Game- Gradually adding to
its stock of skilled players, the league
has continued to develop a stable fan
base. The WNBA is closing in on an
average of 11 ,(XX) fans per game, an
impressive number when compared
to the ABL's average of 4,333.
"It's tough on many of the athletes
because there aren't going to be as
many spots," Starbird said.
Paye also expressed her concern
for the ABL players' situation.
"In the future I hope that the
WNBA evolves into a combination
of the best aspects of the ABL and
WNBA," she said.

Many will be rethinking their bas
ketball careers and their futures.
Manyy will try to break into that
other league.
"I am looking forward to [finding
a new home with the WNBA]," Star
bird said. "The last game 1 played [in
the ABL] was in Nashville. It looked
like KXJ" people were in attendance.
However, the path to the WNBA
will not be easy. Players, new and old,
will have to compete for a suddenly
diminished number of roster slots.
While former ABL players will cer
tainly be struggling to compete for
spots on WNBA teams, the toughest
strain will fall on those players who
still play in the NCAA.
VanDerveer, who has seen count
less numbers of talented players
chase after their dreams, predicts that
women playing basketball at the col
legiate level will now be faced with a
similar set of circumstances to those
before the ABL held the first profes
sional draft.
Regan Freuen, currently Stan

ford's only senior, sees that the shift.
"We still don't know the stability
because the [WNBA] is still new. It
puts more of an emphasis on getting
your education and something to fall
back on," Freuen said.
Players can no long expect to be
able to use their prowess on the court
to feed their families.
With the hope that professional
basketball will be in her near future,
Starbird plans to utilize a Stanford
degree in computer science and re
turn to Palo Alto in order to help a
friend start a company.
Paye also hopes to continue her
career on the court, but is in the
process of applying to both business
school and law school.
So now, as the WNBA takes the
forefront of professional women's
basketball and undoubtedly expands,
the impact this change has in
women's professional sports touches
the lives, careers and dreams of many
of those who have propelled Stan
ford's program in recent years.
On Dec. 22,1998, one-third of the
way through its third season, the
American Basketball League folded
its tent, packed its bags and raised the
white flag. Filing for bankruptcy pro
tection under Chapter 11, co-founder
Gary Cavalli decided the journey was
over.
The nation's newspapers shouted
the sudden announcement across
their headlines and the air waves
buzzed as sports call-in shows ana
lyzed the league's failure.
Then, as time passed by, the re
porters moved on to cover NBA con
tract negotiations, the radio broad
casters resumed their discussions
over the possible reinstatement of in
stant replay in the Nil and 1998
came to a close.
Yet. for women's basketball play
ers across the country and around the
globe, the New Year did not whisk
away the problems at hand.
As the university with the most
representatives in the ABL. Stan
ford's stake in this event is perhaps
greater than most. Roth current and
former players, as well as Stanford's
women's head coach Tara Van-
