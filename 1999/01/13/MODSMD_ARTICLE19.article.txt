# After taking 2nd, water polo comes away
## With honors 
### Brie MacDonald Staff writer 
It was a phenomenal season for the Stanford
men's water polo team. And the squad has
both the team honors and the individual hon
ors to prove it.
Although Stanford lost to USC in the
NCAA championship match, the Cardinal
team has a lot to be proud of.
"I've been here for 22 years and this is one of
the most memorable seasons I've ever been
around," said Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti.
Perhaps one of the most memorable mo
ments of the season was fourth-seeded Stan
ford's sudden-death overtime upset of top
ranked USC in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation semi-final match. And before fac
ing the Trojans, the Cardinal had to down No.
5 Cal in the first round.
The Cardinal, which wasn't even supposed
to be in the MPSF championships ended up
defeating Pepperdine once there, winning
both the league title and the coveted berth to
the NCAA tournament.
"1 can't emphasize enough how tough the
Mountain Pacific tournament is to play," Det
tamanti said. "There's tremendous pressure
on every team to win in order to get to the
NC'AAs."
The competition was so intense that Stan
ford was forced to play overtime matches in
three of its last five matches.
"I can't remember a series of games this out
standing," Dettamanti said. "We won four out
of five and the way it was done shows that the
guys have so much determination."
That determination also includes a lot of
dedication and a heavy time commitment. The
squad began practicing in mid-February and
took just three one-week breaks between Feb
ruary and December.
"We worked for so long and the guys really
worked hard for it." Dettamanti said. "They
put so much effort into the year and really ac
complished a lot. What the guys did just to get
to the NCAAs was beyond belief."
And foi many of the talented athletes in the

Stanford program, their hard work was recog
nized through post-season honors.
At the MPSF tournament, senior Layne
Beaubien and junior Brian Heifferon were
both named to the All-Tournament First
Team. Heifferon was also named Most Valu
able Player for the tournament. Seniors Chris
Aguilera and David Hay received second
team honors.
In the postseason, Beaubien and Aguilera
were named to the All-Conference First
Team, while Heifferon and Hay received sec
ond team and third team honors, respectively.
Aguilera also won the award for All-Confer
ence Goalie of the Year.
At the NCAA tournament, Aguilera,
Beaubien and Heifferon made the first team,
while Hay and junior Andy Walburger were
named to the second team. Aguilera was also
named Most Valuable Defensive Player.
And in the most prestigious set of honors —
the All-American Team — Beaubien. Aguil
era and Heifferon were three of the seven
players in the nation honored with the title of
First Team All-America. Hay and Walburger
both received Honorable Mention.
But along with the players who were award
ed these honors, there was an entire squad of
men who made Stanford's successes possible.
"We've had a lot of team experience, but it
still comes down to each individual coming
through in the clutch." Dettamanti said. "I'm
amazed that [senior] Arturo Rodelo didn't get
recognized because he had some amazing
games this year. But each team only has so
many votes [when it comes time to vote for in
dividual honors]."
Every player who came off the bench was
able tocontribute and that was the key to Stan
ford's strength this year.
"Scan Joy had the game of his life against
USC." Dettamanti said. "Jonathan Skaalen
came through with some key goals and
Michael 1 ipinski was able to draw ejections in
some key situations. Those are just some of the
things that stand out. but every single guy con
tributed during the season at key times."
Some of the most pivotal moments of the
season were when members of the Cardinal
