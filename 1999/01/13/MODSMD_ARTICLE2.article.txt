# New software to improve Axess
## Preregistration a potential feature of software package 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
After more than a year of deliberation, the
Registrar's Office purchased a new software
program that will replace the Network for Stu
dent Information, the backbone of the adminis
trative computing programs on campus.
The new program will expand the capabilities
of Axess, one of NSl's components, to encom
pass many more departments including admis
sions, financial aid, the Bursar's Office, the Reg
istrar's Office and Housing and Dining Services.
University Registrar Roger Printup believes
that this new system "will bring a lot more ratio
nality to the way we do business around here."
The new software, purchased from People Soft,
will replace the current NSI software, which was
developed at Stanford in the early 1980s, with a
more modern and efficient system.
Students will eventually be able to experi
ment with long-term schedules and reapply for
financial aid on the new system. Graduate stu
dents will be able to apply for a leave of absence
on the World Wide Web*
Although the new system will not be in place
for another two to three years, Printup is already
anticipating the changes that will occur in the
wake of its installation â€” the most notable of
those being a possible move towards preregis
tration. something that the old system was un
able to accommodate.
At the moment, it is uncertain whether pre
registration will go forward.
"All we've done is purchase a system which
has the capacity for preregistration," said Hes

ter Gelber, chair of the Committee for Academ
ic Appraisal and Acheivement, which reviewed
the system.
Whether the University will decide to use the
system for preregistration is an issue likely to be
taken up by the Faculty Senate.
Until the new system is in place, the Regis
trar's Office is working to expand the capabili
ties of Axess.
In the past year, the University has devel
oped programs that allow students to declare
majors, get information about graduation and
send enrollment certificates to insurance com
panies.
Also implemented this August was the tech
nology to allow masters and doctoral hopefuls
to apply via the World Wide Web.
This year, 2,100 out of about 9,500 masters
and doctoral applicants used the new system.
"There is a whole move going on toward self
service applications via the Web," Printup said.
The possibilities that come with the new sys
tem are multiple. "We are now taking a different
approach," said Printup, "replacing the system
is a multi-year process, but we are prepared and
ready for the change."
One possible effect of that change, a move to
preregistration, is a move that Printup believes
most of the University highly favors.
"It is pretty clear to me that the faculty wants
preregistration," Printup said. "They want to
know how many students to prepare for ... and
class size is also a big issue."
Gelber said that a preregistration system will
eliminate a "huge amount of chaos" for the fac
ulty and the TAs.

"The beginning of the quar
ter always brings with it a huge
amount of faculty-wasted time.
Because professors don't know
how many students will be in
their classes, they have a hard
er time designing courses, get
ting rooms and ordering
books," she continued.
One concern many students

in focus groups had regarding preregistration
was the elimination of class shopping.
Gelber claimed that "there are no intentions
to change the timing of final registration or
shopping.... We would just move registration
back to the previous quarter so that students
would know what they are taking before they
came back to start classes the following quar
ter."
The window of time that students usually
have in which to "shop" classes would not
change under a new registration system.
Even if preregistration is implemented, the
add / drop period will be the same length as it is
now, according to Printup. Students would
therefore still have flexibility in their class
schedules, but faculty will have a better idea of
what their classes will be like before the quarter
begins.
The registration of incoming freshmen is an
other issue with which the committee may con
tend.
"Presumably, the freshmen would register
during orientation," Gelber said. "It is not plau
sible for freshmen to register over the summer.
They would need to first meet with an advisor."
