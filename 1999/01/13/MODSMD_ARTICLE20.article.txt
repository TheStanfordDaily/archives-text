## Birth control: save it for the morning after? Once known as the nation's best kept secret, emergency contraception is now available at your local drugstore 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
For women wlu> have had
unprotected sex or whose contra
ception method lias failed in the
past 72 houis, there is slill one hist
chance to avoid pregnancy: emer
gency contraception.
Once the nation's best kept
secret, emergency contraceptive
pills were declared sale and effec
tive by the Food and Drug Admin
istration in 19%, and they are now
available in drugstores by prescrip
tion.
In September of last year, the
FDA approved the sale and mar
keting of the I'reven Fmergeney
Contraceptive Kit. a product of
Gynetics, Inc.. a small pharmaceu
tical company in New Jersey. I his
kit includes a patient information
book, a pregnancy test and four
light blue birth control pills.
Although this I'reven kit may
seem new. emergency, or "morning
after." contraception lias been
available since 1951, when the first
birth control pill was introduced. A
higher dosage ol this conventional
pill taken shortly after sex can
effectively help a woman avoid
pregnancy.
Although these pills have been
piesci ibed lor almost 30 years, this

is the first time they have been
packaged, labeled and marketed
specifically for emergency use.
These "morning-alter" pills are
regular birth control pills in higher
dosages.
Already advertisements have
appeared in women's magazines,
and as a result, awareness of the
morning-after contraception
should begin to increase dramati
cally.
The emergency contraceptive
kit could have an enormous impact
on pregnancy rates. Data from the
1995 National Survey of Family
Growth reveal that half of all pre
gancies in the United States are
unintended. ()l these unintended
pregnancies, almost half ended in
abortion. 40 percent in birth and 13
percent in miscarriage.
According to James I russel.
Director of the Office of Popula
tion Research at Princeton Univer
sity and co-author of a recent paper
in Women's Health in Primary
Care. "Fmergeney contraception
has the potential to reduce signifi
cantly the incidence of unintended
pregnancy and the consequent
need for abortion."
Despite these promising impli
cations, a IIW7l l W7 Kaiser Family Foun
dation Survey of women found that
onlv I percent have ever used

emergency contraception, and only
11 percent have enough knowledge
to he ahle to use it. I his survey also
found that while MX) percent of
obstetricians / gynecologists think
emergency contraception is safe
and effective, only 10 percent rou
tinely discuss it with their patients.
There are currently three types
of emergency contraceptives avail
able in the United States. I he
emergency contraceptive pills are
ordinary birth control pills that
contain the hormones estrogen and
progestin. For women who need to
avoid estrogen, there are pro
gestinonly minipills and the cop
per* I intrauterine device.
Emergency contraception is
most effective during the second or
tliiid week of the menstrual cycle.
It should be used by women who
have had unprotected sex. sex dur
ing which the contraception
method failed, or sex after missing
birth control pills.
Emergency contraception pills
are not abortion pills. Unlike abor
tion pills such ;is RU-486, which
are intended to abort an already
established pregnancy, F.C'Ps are
intended to prevent pregnancy
before it happens. As defined by
the National Institutes of Health
and the American College of
Obstretricians and Gynecologists,

a pregnancy officially begins when
the fertilized egg attaches to the
uterus. ECPs act before implanta
tion.
ECPs cause a temporary surge
in hormones. The Emergency Con
traception Web site states that such
a dramatic increase in hormone
levels "disrupts hormone patterns
that are essential for pregnancy."
ECPs may inhibit or delay ovula
tion and alter the make-up of the
uterine lining, thus preventing
implantation of a fertilized egg.
ECPs are 75 percent effective,
according to Trussel. "This means
that if 100 women have unprotect
ed intercourse once during the sec
ond or third week of their cycle,
about eight would become preg
nant; following treatment with
ECPs, only two would become
pregnant: a 75 percent reduction."
A woman using ECPs must take
one dose within 72 hours of unpro
tected intercourse, and a second
dose 12 hours later. The regimen
for the number and kind of pill per
dose ranges among at least 10
brands of pill.
These pills are equally effective
if taken any time in the 72-hour
window. A woman can therefore
schedule the doses so that she does
not have to wake up in the middle
of the night to take the second

dose.
This may be convenient, hut
there are side effects to this heavy
surge in hormones. About 50 per
cent of women experience nausea
and 20 percent experience vomit
ing. Using over-the-counter anti
nausea medicines or taking each
dose with food may reduce the risk
of nausea. Less common side
effects are headache, breast tender
ness, dizziness and fluid retention.
It should be noted that taking
extra ECPs is not effective, accord
ing to the Emergency Contracep
tive Web site. Extra pills will not
decrease the risk of pregnancy and
will only increase nausea.
After using ECPs, a woman's
next period may start a few days
earlier or later than usual. Howev
er, if her period doesn't start with
in four weeks, she may actually be
pregnant and should see her clini
cian.
Most women can use ECPs safe
ly. However, ECPs are not appro
priate for women who suffer from
an active migraine, have a history of
stroke or blood clots in the lungs or
legs, or who are already pregnant.
While there have been no con
clusive studies on the ill effects of
ECPs on babies whose mothers
took ECPs unaware they were
already pregnant, women can be
reassured that ECPs are taken long
before it is possible to have any
negative effect on the fetus. Fur
thermore. no evidence of increased

risk of birth defects was found
among women who continued to
take their regular oral contracep
tives without knowing they were
pregnant.
A couple should not depend on
emergency contraception as their
only method of contraception,
however. It is not as effective as
other forms of birth control and
does not protect against sexually
transmitted infection. Still, it
remains a valuable option for
women.
All states except Washington
require a prescription from a doc
tor. Doctors can prescribe ECPs
without an office visit, though, as
long as they know the woman's
medical history. In Washington,
ECPs are available directly from a
pharmacist without a doctor's pre
scription.
The cost of a morning-after pill
kit, such as Preven, ranges from $8
to $15. Other costs to be consid
ered are a doctor visit, a pregnancy
test or other kinds of pills.
Emergency contraception is
available at TPlanned Parenthood
health centers, public and women's
health centers, college health cen
ters, private doctors or hospital
emergency rooms. A woman can
call 1-888-NOT-2-LATE to get the
names of five health care providers
in her area who will prescribe the
pills. Finally, an extensive Web site

past 72 houis, there is slill one hist
chance to avoid pregnancy: emer
gency contraception.
Once the nation's best kept
secret, emergency contraceptive
pills were declared sale and effec
tive by the Food and Drug Admin
istration in 19%, and they are now
available in drugstores by prescrip
tion.
In September of last year, the
FDA approved the sale and mar
keting of the I'reven Fmergeney
Contraceptive Kit. a product of
Gynetics, Inc.. a small pharmaceu
tical company in New Jersey. I his
kit includes a patient information
book, a pregnancy test and four
light blue birth control pills.
Although this I'reven kit may
seem new. emergency, or "morning
after." contraception lias been
available since 1951, when the first
birth control pill was introduced. A
higher dosage ol this conventional
pill taken shortly after sex can
effectively help a woman avoid
pregnancy.
Although these pills have been
piesci ibed lor almost 30 years, this

is the first time they have been
packaged, labeled and marketed
specifically for emergency use.
These "morning-alter" pills are
regular birth control pills in higher
dosages.
Already advertisements have
appeared in women's magazines,
and as a result, awareness of the
morning-after contraception
should begin to increase dramati
cally.
The emergency contraceptive
kit could have an enormous impact
on pregnancy rates. Data from the
1995 National Survey of Family
Growth reveal that half of all pre
gancies in the United States are
unintended. ()l these unintended
pregnancies, almost half ended in
abortion. 40 percent in birth and 13
percent in miscarriage.
According to James I russel.
Director of the Office of Popula
tion Research at Princeton Univer
sity and co-author of a recent paper
in Women's Health in Primary
Care. "Fmergeney contraception
has the potential to reduce signifi
cantly the incidence of unintended
pregnancy and the consequent
need for abortion."
Despite these promising impli
cations, a IIW7l l W7 Kaiser Family Foun
dation Survey of women found that
onlv I percent have ever used

emergency contraception, and only
11 percent have enough knowledge
to he ahle to use it. I his survey also
found that while MX) percent of
obstetricians / gynecologists think
emergency contraception is safe
and effective, only 10 percent rou
tinely discuss it with their patients.
There are currently three types
of emergency contraceptives avail
able in the United States. I he
emergency contraceptive pills are
ordinary birth control pills that
contain the hormones estrogen and
progestin. For women who need to
avoid estrogen, there are pro
gestinonly minipills and the cop
per* I intrauterine device.
Emergency contraception is
most effective during the second or
tliiid week of the menstrual cycle.
It should be used by women who
have had unprotected sex. sex dur
ing which the contraception
method failed, or sex after missing
birth control pills.
Emergency contraception pills
are not abortion pills. Unlike abor
tion pills such ;is RU-486, which
are intended to abort an already
established pregnancy, F.C'Ps are
intended to prevent pregnancy
before it happens. As defined by
the National Institutes of Health
and the American College of
Obstretricians and Gynecologists,

a pregnancy officially begins when
the fertilized egg attaches to the
uterus. ECPs act before implanta
tion.
ECPs cause a temporary surge
in hormones. The Emergency Con
traception Web site states that such
a dramatic increase in hormone
levels "disrupts hormone patterns
that are essential for pregnancy."
ECPs may inhibit or delay ovula
tion and alter the make-up of the
uterine lining, thus preventing
implantation of a fertilized egg.
ECPs are 75 percent effective,
according to Trussel. "This means
that if 100 women have unprotect
ed intercourse once during the sec
ond or third week of their cycle,
about eight would become preg
nant; following treatment with
ECPs, only two would become
pregnant: a 75 percent reduction."
A woman using ECPs must take
one dose within 72 hours of unpro
tected intercourse, and a second
dose 12 hours later. The regimen
for the number and kind of pill per
dose ranges among at least 10
brands of pill.
These pills are equally effective
if taken any time in the 72-hour
window. A woman can therefore
schedule the doses so that she does
not have to wake up in the middle
of the night to take the second

dose.
This may be convenient, hut
there are side effects to this heavy
surge in hormones. About 50 per
cent of women experience nausea
and 20 percent experience vomit
ing. Using over-the-counter anti
nausea medicines or taking each
dose with food may reduce the risk
of nausea. Less common side
effects are headache, breast tender
ness, dizziness and fluid retention.
It should be noted that taking
extra ECPs is not effective, accord
ing to the Emergency Contracep
tive Web site. Extra pills will not
decrease the risk of pregnancy and
will only increase nausea.
After using ECPs, a woman's
next period may start a few days
earlier or later than usual. Howev
er, if her period doesn't start with
in four weeks, she may actually be
pregnant and should see her clini
cian.
Most women can use ECPs safe
ly. However, ECPs are not appro
priate for women who suffer from
an active migraine, have a history of
stroke or blood clots in the lungs or
legs, or who are already pregnant.
While there have been no con
clusive studies on the ill effects of
ECPs on babies whose mothers
took ECPs unaware they were
already pregnant, women can be
reassured that ECPs are taken long
before it is possible to have any
negative effect on the fetus. Fur
thermore. no evidence of increased

risk of birth defects was found
among women who continued to
take their regular oral contracep
tives without knowing they were
pregnant.
A couple should not depend on
emergency contraception as their
only method of contraception,
however. It is not as effective as
other forms of birth control and
does not protect against sexually
transmitted infection. Still, it
remains a valuable option for
women.
All states except Washington
require a prescription from a doc
tor. Doctors can prescribe ECPs
without an office visit, though, as
long as they know the woman's
medical history. In Washington,
ECPs are available directly from a
pharmacist without a doctor's pre
scription.
The cost of a morning-after pill
kit, such as Preven, ranges from $8
to $15. Other costs to be consid
ered are a doctor visit, a pregnancy
test or other kinds of pills.
Emergency contraception is
available at TPlanned Parenthood
health centers, public and women's
health centers, college health cen
ters, private doctors or hospital
emergency rooms. A woman can
call 1-888-NOT-2-LATE to get the
names of five health care providers
in her area who will prescribe the
pills. Finally, an extensive Web site
