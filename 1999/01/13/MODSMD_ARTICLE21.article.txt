# Many students unaware of new option

Not many college students know
about emergency contraception.
James Trussel, director of the
Office of Population Research at
Princeton University, co-authored
a recent paper in Women's Health
in Primary Care that included com
ments on a recent college campus
survey.
"While nearly all students were
aware of emergency contraceptive
pills and knew they were available
at the college health center."
Trussel said, "few knew that ECPs
were ordinary combined oral con
traceptives. and many could not

distinguish ECPs from mirepre
stonc, a medication taked to induce
abortion after pregnancy has been
confirmed," he said.
Sophomore Jill Di Giovanni, the
peer health educator at the
Women's Center and the Outreach
Coordinator at the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center, agrees that
college students know little about
the subject.
"People have heard about it, but
they don't really know what it is or
where they can get it, or that it's
even an option," she said.
When asked about the morning
after pill, sophomore Nick Furrow
admitted, "I know just about zero."
Sophomore Casey Ward, a

SHPRC education coordinator,
said that the information is out
there.
"At the SHPRC we regularly
counsel students about ECP and
refer them to Cowell for further
information and a prescription,"
she said.
"We have fact sheets on ECP,"
Ward said. "Often counselors will
mention ECP to students just in to
get their condoms so that students
will know about the ECP in case of
condom failure."
According to Dr. Robyn Tep
per, chief of medical services at
Cowell, and Nurse Practioner Car
olyn Fox, assistant director of med
ical services, it is CoweU's policy to

discuss emergency contraception
with patients.
Emergency contraception is
available at Cowell Pharmacy, and
also after business hours at the
same-day clinic seven days a week.
The process of getting ECPs at
Cowell involves a visit with a clini
cian at Cowell, said Tepper.
"I used ECP as a stupid 15-year
old after unprotected sex," said one
junior. "I got it from my family doc
tor after having to explain the situ
ation to my dad in order to get a
ride.
"The circumstances were
uncomfortable and embarassing
but saved me from the crisis of an
unplanned pregnancy," she said.
