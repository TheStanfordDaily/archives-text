# Striking similarities found between yeast and worm genomes
## 
### Cindy Lin 
Stanford researchers were
recently the first to compare the
yeast genome to that of the nema
tode worm. I he completion of the
worm genome sequence has made
it possible, for the first time, to
compare entire genomes of two
distinct organisms.
I lie rcseachers also identified
similar gene sequences and protein
functions in these disparate
eukaryotic organisms.
David Botstein and Michael
Cherry, professors in the Depart
ment of Genetics at the Stanford
School of Medicine, conducted the
study in collaboration with col
leagues and scientists from the
National Institutes of Health and
Boston I 'niversity.
I he scientists compared the

(>,217 genes of the unicellular yeast
Saccluiromyces cerevisiue with the
l l ),() l > ( ) genes of the multicellular
nematode worm Ciu'iiorhabditis
elegans.
I he worm is the second eukary
otc, following the yeast, to have its
genome completely sequenced. A
eukaryotc. in contrast to the more
primitive prokaryote, is an organ
ism with a distinct, membrane
bound nucleus which contains
genetic information.
I he study showed many of the
core biological functions in the
yeast and worm are performed by
proteins similar in sequence and
number.
"We found that l l > percent of
the worm proteins in their entirety
were similar to the yeast's, and
that 40 percent of the yeast pro
teins in their entirety were similar

to the worm's," said Cherry. " I his
was expected because the yeast
genome is much smaller than the
worm's."
"Because there is a good agree
ment on the known processes in
yeast, we could make comparisons
of functions to that of the worm, "
said C herrv. "We were able to pre
dict that because the protein
sequences are very similar, the
worm proteins are doing the same
thing as the yeast proteins."
According to co-author
Stephen Chervitz, the study sug
gested most of the core biological
functions of the two eukaryotes
arc carried out by orthologous
proteins — proteins that occur in
different species but can be traced
back to a common ancestor.
"The study also indicates that
all of these organisms did evolve

from one general starting point,
and this explains why they share so
many core functions." Cherry said.
When there are similarities
between organisms' protein sets,
this allows for a transfer of knowl
edge of genetic functions between
organisms and then the further
study of the genes which are
unique to an organism.
The research "points out which
genes require further study and
which genes only need to be
checked that they're doing the
same thing." Botstein said. "It
really is a time-saver."
While experiments still must be
conducted to prove the functions
of proteins in other organisms, the
data from these sequence analyses
allows researchers to make better
predictions and avoid duplication
of experiments done in other simi

lar systems. "It doesn't replace
experimental investigation, but it
does allow experimenters to form
testable hypotheses that are more
likely to succeed," Chervitz said.
By looking at similarities
between genes, scientists can bet
ter understand the functions of
newly discovered genes. Accord
ing to Botstein, worms can aid the
study of multicellular life.
"Once we have the sequence of
the human genome, how do we
know what it means?" Botstein
said. "Well, we can now use the
similarities of human genes to that
of the worm and yeast to look for
the orthologs between worm and
humans."
The implications of this
research on the sequencing of the
human genome, which has an esti
mated number of between 70,(XX)

to 1 ()(),()()() genes, is that these
"model organisms" provide reli
able functional annotation for the
human L)NA sequence when there
are similarities between the organ
isms' core biological processes.
"By studying things like the ner
vous system of the multicellular
worm, we can then relate this to
proteins in humans," Cherry said.
"This is because what is shared
between yeast and worms is also
shared by many higher eukaryote
cells, such as proteins which
metabolize sugar or proteins that
replicate DNA."
The results of this study were
published in the Dec. 11 issue of
Science magazine. The genome
database for Saccharomyces cere
visiae is at the Web site http://
