# Condi, ASSU Senate talk policy issues
## Departing provost discusses record; Senate approves SURE funding 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice
spoke to the ASSU Senate last
night on the reasons for her depar
ture from her post in the spring,
saying that she wished to become
reacquainted with current events in
her field.
Rice said that as a result of her
full-time job as provost she has
missed many of changes in the
world economic and political situa
tions over the past six years. "I'm
becoming a dinosaur in my field,"
she said.
Rice said she would take a
three-year leave of absence from
the Provost's Office and her profes
sorship to spend more time re
searching the role that private insti
tutions are playing in restructuring
international economies. She is not

sure in what ca
pacity she w-iil-W
employed, but she
said she plans re
turn to Stanford
after that time.

After explain
ing her reasons for
stepping down.
Rice fielded ques-

tions from Senate Chair Adam
Weiss about plans for increasing
the number of tenured minority
professors.
Rice warned against changing
the tenure procedure, however,
saying that there are so few tenured
minority professors because there
is a small pool of doctoral candi
dates and assistant professors from
which to draw.
Specifically citing the African-
American, Hispanic and Latino
and Native American communi

ties. Rice said, "It's been only re
cently that the Ph.D. has been con
sidered a valued career track [for
members of these communities.]"
Rice said the University com
petes heavily for minority and fe
male faculty and has been trying to
increase this pool by offering mi
nority research scholarships and
opportunities. The faculty at Stan
ford is 18 percent female and 14
percent minority. Long-term
changes, however, will have to
come from more individuals pursu
ing doctoral research and profes
sorships, she said.
Prompted by a question from
senator Stephen Kane, Rice listed
three major improvements enacted
in the University during her term:
increasing the small-group class
room experience for undergradu
ates, enhancing information tech
nology on campus and multimedia

capabilities in classrooms and ad
dressing the graduate student
housing challenge.
Rice said that programs such as
Sophomore College and Stanford
Introductory Seminars have in
creased opportunities for freshmen
and sophomores to work in smaller
groups and have more contact with
professors. She also noted that
more work needs to be done in
making departments more cohe
sive and improving advising for ju
niors and seniors.
Information technology and
computing improvements are con
stantly underway, she said, and the
University is putting more funds
into wiring classrooms and in
stalling audiovisual equipment.
As her third point, Rice com
mented on the graduate housing


Rice
situation. She said she thought that
transferring the undergraduate
model of residential education to
the graduate housing was a mis
take and expressed support for the
move to transfer funds from the
now-defunct Graduate Resident
Assistant program into creating a
new associate dean of students for
graduate student issues position.
This position, she said, is help

ing the University address issues
concerning the more than 50 per
cent of graduate students living off
campus, as well as those on cam
pus.
Senator Clarence Hu asked
about the lack of parking on cam
pus and plans to alleviate the prob
lem.
Rice answered, "Sometimes I
think we've all become a little
spoiled about parking," noting that
other universities have more park
ing difficulties than Stanford.
She sugi>ested more use of the

Marguerite, satellite parking at
Stanford Stadium and perhaps im
posing restrictions on who could
bring cars to campus as possible so
lutions.
After Rice spoke, the Senate
voted to release reserve funds for
SCBN to reimburse a member for
a new equipment purchase.
The Senate also voted to use a
portion of its discretionary funds to
aid SURE Escort service in pur
chasing a new golf cart, as the ser
vice's two working carts are in
need of substantial repairs.
