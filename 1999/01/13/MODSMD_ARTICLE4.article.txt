# Stone by stone, library nears completion
## Rebuilt Green Library West to re-open in July after 10 years 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Since winter break, visitors to Green Library have used
a newly redesigned entrance. As of this summer, they'll be
entering a whole new library.
Closing the book on one of the final chapters of the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake, the $50 million reconstruction of
Green Library West is near completion, with the library set
to reopen its doors this summer.
Major seismic damage from the quake forced the Uni
versity to shut down the library, which first opened in 1919.
In the decade since, the repair project has been plagued by
"all sorts of complicated delays," according to Deputy
University Librarian Karen Nagy.
Before the earthquake, Green West housed nearly 1
million volumes. The University's first step was to build the
Stanford Auxiliary Library to store these works before
construction was able to begin.
Planners created an entirely new structural design for
the building, as it had previously been supported by
columns of hollow clay tile that "don't have the kind of
structural stability that is required to meet today's life safe-

ty standards," Nagy said.
The University also faced a chal
lenge in fundraising for the expensive
project. Officials worked with state
agencies to give the project status as a
historic renovation, allowing the Fed
eral Emergency Management
Agency to provide some funding.
The construction difficulties were
compounded in 1995, when the pro
ject's initial architects went bankrupt
and the University had to find a new
design team.
However, now that the project is
nearly complete, University librari
ans are eager for Green West's open
ing.
I certainly am excited, as is every
one that I work with," said Joan Kras
ner Leighton, Stanford University Li
braries' head of access services. "It's a
project we've all worked very hard
on, particularly over the last three or
four years, planning for this day in the
next six months when we can finally
reopen it to students and faculty,"
The new Green Library West is a
five-story structure that will house
several new features of the (Jreen Li
brary complex.
The first floor will contain the So
cial Sciences Resource Center, which
will consist of social science reference
materials as well as the Jonsson C ol
lection of Government Documents,
currently housed in the Meyer Li
brary basement.
The Humanities and Area Studies
Resource Center will open on the
second floor, along with reading
rooms for the University's special
collections and archives.
The third and fourth floors will
contain offices for technical process
ing and library friends and donors, as
well as additional reading rooms.
Green West's fifth floor will house
the Bender Room, which N;igy de
scribes as "an absolutely beautiful
reading room that looks out over the
Quad."
Tiered stacks towers, which have
been incorporated into the library's

construction, will house many of the
government documents and other
works, and extend into the Green
West basement as well.
The opening of Green West will
coincide with a reorganization of
much of the existing (ireen Last col
lections. The Current Periodicals
reading room will be moved up from
the basement and integrated with the
reference desk to form a new, ex
panded Information Center on the
first floor.
The South Mezzanine and the
connecting area that now contains
the Jonsson Library will be filled with
(Jreen's general collections.
A new entrance to the Green li
braries for the general public is also
being planned for the I loover Tower
side of the structures.
According to Nagy, "At literally
every level, there is a better, more
easy connection between the two
buildings" than before.
One of the highlights of Green
West will be its increased student
studying areas. "We're bringing
(Jreen West back to life with many
more active, broadly used public
spaces," Nagy said.
Reference librarian Rose Adams
added, "More students will be com
ing into flic library because the build
ing is new. and more students will be

coming in because there will be more
study space."
Green West will contain 4(X) read
er seats, each of which will be
equipped with a computer network
port. "Even the famous big soft seats
will be connected," Nagy said.
This feature is part of an overall
effort "to create an infrastructure in
the building that will take it well into
the next century," according to Nagy.
( ollections will begin to be moved
into Green West in early April, Nagy
said. The huge task will be undertak
en by a combination of special library
staff and a moving company to be
hired by the University.
Nagy said (ireen West's doors will
open in July: "It's sort of a down time
on the campus, and we'll open the
doors to the public and try to get all
the service points and functionalities
of the building going."
Nagy expects the library to be
completely functional for the start of
the l l )W-2(KK) academic year, and an
opening ceremony is currently in the
planning stages with the President's
(Mfice for ()ctober of this year.
Adams pointed out perhaps the
only drawback of the new structure.
"I II be doing a lot more walking
around. I'll need to buy many more
pairs of comfortable shoes, perhaps
even a pair of Rollerblades."
