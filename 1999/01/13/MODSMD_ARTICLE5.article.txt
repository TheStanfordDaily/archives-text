These professors,
and dozens like them, are taking
advantage of newly instituted
$5,000 research grants that the
University is giving to its junior fac
ulty.
The grants, proposed in Octo
ber by President Casper, give ju
nior faculty $5,000 in unrestricted
funds for their research. The Uni
versity is awarding the grants to all
assistant professors in the Schools
of Earth Sciences, Engineering and
Humanities and Sciences, the three

schools that offer undergraduate
degrees.
Holland, who last quarter
taught the freshman seminar Eng
lish 72: "Growing Up in America"
and will teach another seminar in
the spring, English 80: "Feminist
Discourse and 20th Century Liter
ature," has already traveled to the
Library of Congress in Washing
ton, D.C, thanks to the research
money. She plans also to use the
money for foreign travel and fin
ishing her second book.
She said this new opportunity
for research would not detract
from her teaching, but would only
strengthen her courses, because
her teaching and research are very
interrelated.
In his State of the University


Casper
Address, Casper said that the pro
gram will strengthen both under
graduate education and the re
search efforts of faculty.
The funds may be used for trav
el to scholarly meetings, to conduct
research, to procure research mate

rials, to defray the costs of publica
tion, to purehase computers or for
any other purpose that direetly sup
ports a professor's research pro
gram.
Every junior faculty member in
the three schools will receive $S,(KM)
this year and another grant on
reappointment. If the University
awards tenure, the faculty member
will receive another $10,(XX) in re

search money.
Jacqueline Wender, assistant to
the President, explained the needs
and benefits of the grants. "Under
graduates come to Stanford to pur
sue a degree in a research-intensive
university; it is to their benefit, as
well as to the benefit of the faculty,
that the University strengthen re
search support to junior faeulty."
Unrestricted funds raised by the

President's Fund will support the
program.
Wender noted that "grant
monies are increasingly hard to
come by, particularly, although not
exclusively, in the humanities, and
these grants will alleviate some of
the burden of raising funds."
Another assistant professor who
has received a grant echoed Wen
der's thoughts. Carlo Tomasi, in

computer science, plans to use it
"for research in computer vision
and as seed money to attract more
from the University as well as small
companies."
The money will also support his
students' experiments.
Tomasi added that he thinks the
amount of the grant might be more
than adequate for other depart
ments, but that he would be happy

to see the amount increase.
Furthermore, he said that the
money "will not force faculty to
focus more on research and ignore
teaching, rather it will amplify what
they have always focused on,"
Overall, Tomasi explained,
"The grants are quite a valuable re
source, especially because some
departments will be able to lever
age more money."
