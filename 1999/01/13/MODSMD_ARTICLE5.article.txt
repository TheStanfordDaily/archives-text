These professors,
and dozens like them, are taking
advantage of newly instituted
$5,000 research grants that the
University is giving to its junior fac
ulty.
The grants, proposed in Octo
ber by President Casper, give ju
nior faculty $5,000 in unrestricted
funds for their research. The Uni
versity is awarding the grants to all
assistant professors in the Schools
of Earth Sciences, Engineering and
Humanities and Sciences, the three

schools that offer undergraduate
degrees.
Holland, who last quarter
taught the freshman seminar Eng
lish 72: "Growing Up in America"
and will teach another seminar in
the spring, English 80: "Feminist
Discourse and 20th Century Liter
ature," has already traveled to the
Library of Congress in Washing
ton, D.C, thanks to the research
money. She plans also to use the
money for foreign travel and fin
ishing her second book.
She said this new opportunity
for research would not detract
from her teaching, but would only
strengthen her courses, because
her teaching and research are very
interrelated.
