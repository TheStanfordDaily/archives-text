Jeremy Bulow, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, has
been named director of the Federal
Trade Commission's Bureau of
Economics, a position that will give
him the opportunity to bring his
knowledge as an academic to bear
on the commission's economic
analysis.
"I think that the work of the FTC
is interesting and important," Bulow
said. The commission's responsibili
ties include enforcing a broad range
of antitrust and consumer protec
tion laws.
According to its mission state
ment. the commission seeks to en
sure that markets operate competi
tively and are free from unnecessary
regulations. At the same time, it also

tries to protect the interests of con
sumers by eliminating unfair and de
ceptive trade practices.
Bulow said the Bureau of Eco

FTC uses data from the Bureau of
Economics to make such decisions
as whether it will try to prevent a
given corporate merger, or whether
a certain regulation is too restrictive.
He said that though his job de
scription involves supplying data
that others use to make policy deci

solid economic data itself can lead to
improved public policy. At the same
time, he acknowledges that political
forces can overpower even the most
