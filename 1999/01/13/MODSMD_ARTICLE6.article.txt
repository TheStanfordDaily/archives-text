### Catherine Crump 
Jeremy Bulow, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, has
been named director of the Federal
Trade Commission's Bureau of
Economics, a position that will give
him the opportunity to bring his
knowledge as an academic to bear
on the commission's economic
analysis.
"I think that the work of the FTC
is interesting and important," Bulow
said. The commission's responsibili
ties include enforcing a broad range
of antitrust and consumer protec
tion laws.
According to its mission state
ment. the commission seeks to en
sure that markets operate competi
tively and are free from unnecessary
regulations. At the same time, it also

tries to protect the interests of con
sumers by eliminating unfair and de
ceptive trade practices.
Bulow said the Bureau of Eco
nomics, which he will oversee, pro
vides important economic data to
the commission. He said that the
FTC uses data from the Bureau of
Economics to make such decisions
as whether it will try to prevent a
given corporate merger, or whether
a certain regulation is too restrictive.
He said that though his job de
scription involves supplying data
that others use to make policy deci
sions, he believes the existence of
solid economic data itself can lead to
improved public policy. At the same
time, he acknowledges that political
forces can overpower even the most
closely reasoned economic analysis.
"I think that good economic
analysis can do a lot for policy, even
if i( will often he blocked hy poli
tics," he said.
The commission is divided into
three bureaus: competition, con
sumer protection and economics.
According to Bulow, it is the role of
the Bureau of Competition to de
cide whether mergers should be al
lowed to proceed or if the commis
sion should try to prevent them.
The second bureau, the Bureau
of C onsumer Protection, is in charge
of a variety of consumer-interest

areas, ranging from Internet fraud to
tobacco labeling, he added.
Bulow said that in addition to in
forming commission policy, the Bu
reau of Economics also advises
other governmental organizations
about the potential impact of vari
ous regulatory reform efforts.
"One important area we are
working on right now is electricity
deregulation," Bulow said. "The
FTC provides advice to state regula
tory commissions that are deciding
how to deregulate."
He added that "this is a very im
portant area because whatever hap
pens over the next five years, we'll
probably be stuck with for a very
longtime."
In addition to being of service to

the commission, Bulow said he
thinks his time in government will
augment his research as an academ-

"On a personal level, I thought
that spending some time in the gov
ernment would expose me to a lot of
things that I simply would not see if I
spent the time on campus," he said.
"By adding to my real-world knowl
edge and contacts, I'll have some
thing new to bring to my teaching
and research."
Bulow has agreed to remain at
the commission for at least 18
months. He plans on returning to
Stanford after he finishes at the
FTC. Bulow has served as a profes
sor of economics at the Graduate
School of Business since 1979.
