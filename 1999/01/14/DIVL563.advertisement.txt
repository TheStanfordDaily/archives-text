Dear Sir,
I was a guest at your restaurant and 1 chose to eat two of your specials
and they were excellent. One was the corn soup with cumin. Would you be
willing to send me the recipe?
I liked it so much that I would enjoy preparing it for my husband. (I'm
not a good enough cook to prepare the main course, the gillled dorado, but I
compliment you on that as well.)
I look forward to my next meal at Pro Bono. I shall recommend your
restaurant to my friends in the San Francisco area.
Sincerely,
Susan Sheehan, The New Yorker Magazine
