# Stanford science scores
## Science Watch ranks Stanford second 
### Alice Brown Contributing writer 
Science Watch magazine has declared Stanford the
second-highest ranking U.S. university in terms of its
worldwide scientific impact.

The ranking is based on the number of citations per
paper in 21 scientific fields between the vears of 1993 and
1997. Stanford appeared on 13 of the 21 top-ten lists and
was outranked only by Harvard, which was on 17 of the
lists.
The 21 fields span both the physical and social sci
ences. ranging from astrophysics and computer science
to law and education.
Stanford departments were not contacted bv Science
Watch.
"Frankly. 1 knew nothing about this article. 1 even did
not know that there was one such article," said Prof.
Jean-Claude Latombe. chair of the Computer Science
Department. "I am surprised that Stanford did not come
out No. 1."
Prof. Barry Trost. chair of the Chemistry Depart
ment. said, "We are of course delighted to receive this
type of recognition These types of analyses provide
some hard data to verify what we believe, all along, is
true."
This "Top-Ten Tournament" is the second that Sci
ence Watch has produced.
The first, which assessed the years 1981-1993, ranked

Stanford No. 1 overall. It appeared
on 17 of the 21 lists.
"Harvard snuck up in the newer
survey, but I'm not sure if I'd say that
Stanford had 'slipped,' " Science
Watch editor Christopher King said.

Many rankings in other maga
zines are subjective, but "we try to
stick to objective, quantitative mea
sures that are based on.. .judgments
that scientists themselves make
when they identify the previously
published literature that's the most
useful, significant or influential in
preparing and forwarding their own
work," King said.

"For each ranking, we
each separate field on the basis o£
discrete populations of journals
[the Institute for Scientific Informa*
tion] receives each week," said King,}
"Examining papers published and,
cited within each separate popula»J
tion of journals is how we distinguish
these fields for the purpose of mak-C
ing separate rankings." y
