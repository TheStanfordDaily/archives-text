## Clinton trial to start today 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bracing for opening
arguments in his impeachment trial. President Clinton
said Wednesday he will tend studiously to "the business
of the people" while his fate is settled in historic Senate
proceedings. House prosecutors said Monica Lewinsky
had recently rejected their request for a pretrial inter
view.
Apart from Clinton's remarks Wednesday, his legal
team dispatched a formal trial brief to the Senate argu
ing that neither "fact or law" warranted his removal
from office.
"The vote the American people rendered ... is
hanging in the balance." the brief said.
"They have their job to do in the Senate, and 1 have
mine," the president told reporters in his first public
utterance in three weeks on an issue that has tarnished
his presidency for posterity. "I trust that the right thing
will be done."
Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of
justice in the first presidential impeachment trial since
Andrew Johnson was acquitted in IK6B. A two-thirds
vote of the Senate is required to convict him and
remove him from office.
The trial is to resume at 1 p.m. ES T. with Chief Jus

tice William Rehnquisi presiding and the House
impeachment team — Republican lawmakers all —
starting to present their case.
The House does not yet have permission from the
Senate to call witnesses in the trial. Spokesman McNul
tv explained the overture to Ms. Lewinsky by saying the
committee was "duty bound to gather all relevant evi
dence and be thoroughly prepared for the trial. Implic
it in the House's right to request witnesses is the
responsibility to determine who the House will call."
Drafted by private attorneys and the staff of the
White House counsel's office. Clinton's pleadings
argued that the impeachment standard of high crimes
and misdemeanors refers to actions that are attempts to
subvert the Constitution.
Under ground rules adopted last week, the House
has 24 hours — spread over three days, for example —
to make its case, and the White House will have 24
hours for its defense.
The Senate will then be permitted to pose questions
to the two sides.
Afterward, the White House is expected to seek dis
missal of the charges, and the House is expected to seek
permission to call witnesses.
