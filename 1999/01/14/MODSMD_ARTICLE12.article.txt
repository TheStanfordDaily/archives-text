# Central banker resigns; successor devalues real
## Brazilian currency collapsing 
### 
RIO DE JANEIRO. Brazil
(AP)- Brazil's central banker
unexpectedly resigned yesterday
and his successor devalued the cur
rency b\ 7.6 percent, roiling world
financial markets. Many feared the
economic contagion could spread
through Latin America and even
threaten the United States.
Wall Street reacted sharply after
the announcement that Central
Bank chief Gustavo Franco had
stepped down, but recovered half
its losses by the end of trading.
Investors worry that if Brazil falls.
Latin America's largest economy
and most populous country could
drag others in the region into the
maelstrom.
An estimated 2.(HH) American
businesses operate in Brazil, includ
ing such giants as IBM. Coca Cola,

Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp. U.S. hanks have a $27
billion stake in Brazil, and weak
operations overseas could pinch
profits back home.
Just a day earlier. Treasury Sec
retary Robert Rubin listed Brazil as
among his chief concerns, along
with the financial mess in Russia
and Japan's continuing struggles to
right its economy.
Brazil's first order of business
was the announcement by new
Central Bank chief Francisco Lopes
to allow the Brazilian currency, the
real, to trade in a wider band
against the dollar. His move effec
tively devalued the currency by
nearly K percent.
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.
Latin America's largest, opened an
hour late because of Franco's resig

nation and plunged 10 percent with
in minutes. It closed down 5 percent
Wednesday. The smaller Rio de
Janeiro exchange lost 5.6 percent.
In New York, the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged as much
as 261.58, but based on preliminary
calculations it regained nearly hall
that to close at 9,349.56, down
125.12. Markets in Mexico, Europe
and elsewhere were also sharply off.
But Brazil has been unable to
calm the anxiety that has immersed
it since August, when it seemed the
government would have trouble
covering a $65-billion deficit and
might default on debt payments.
Since then, investors have pulled
some $40 billion out of the country.
Reserves have plunged to around
$35 billion — and another $1.2 bil
lion left on Tuesday.
