Wang Guangya, China's assistant secretary for human rights, acknowl
edged that China's human rights record isn't perfect, but he said the U.S.
record isn't either. "Every country must improve its human rights record.

China needs to do so. and so does America."he told reporters at the Chi

duced next week by Sens. James Jeffords. R-Vt.. and Edward Kennedy,
I)-Mass.. that would expand federal health coverage for disabled workers.
Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on Edu
cation and the Workforce, praised Clinton's move. But he said the presi
dent should go further and endorse a GOP plan to allow small businesses
and self-employed people to band together to buy group health coverage.
Advocates for the disabled said this proposal could encourage more
disabled people to seek work because they no longer have to fear losing
Medicaid when they get jobs that pay more than current income limits.
Clinton said he plans to provide in his budget proposal sufficient
money to finance an initiative called the Work Incentives Improvement
Act. which would extend Medicaid coverage to disabled people who
return to the work force.
