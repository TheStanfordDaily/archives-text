Students and politicians
profit from insights and
influence of Stanford profs

MUCH OF STANFORD'S aura
and reputation comes from the
prominent, award-winning facul
ty. Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners work
alongside former Secretaries of State and
Defense.
The current debate over President Clin
ton's impeachment has brought several of
these professors to the forefront of public
and political debate. The covergence of pol
itics and academics is something we
applaud and hope will continue as the Sen
ate and public decide important and com
plex issues.
It is apparent to even the most political
ly naive American citizen that the debate
over Clinton's impeachment is more than a
did-he-or-did-he-not-do-it question. Forc
ing a popularly elected president out of
office entails serious consequences in every
area of American life, and it sets important
precedents for future constitutional
debates. It also sends signals to students
pondering a career in politics.
Scholars familiar with constitutional his
tory, congressional and executive politics
and public opinion theory are crucial
resources for policy makers and citizens
interested in achieving a fair and lawful res
olution. They can answer important ques
tions concerning traditional definitions of
"high crimes and misdemeanors" and
whether or not public support of the presi
dent should have any meaning in an
impeachment trial.

Professors are usually eager to share
their knowledge and perspective with poli
cymakers and the public. Controversial
political debates are opportunities to influ
ence history with their theories and insights.
A recent op-ed piece in The New York
Times by History Prof. Jack Rakove ques
tioned whether an impeachment trial is an
appropriate response to the specific actions
of President Clinton. Rakove, who previ
ously testified before the House Judiciary
Committee, urged the Senate to debate
whether Clinton's crimes constitute "high
crimes and misdemeanors" before calling
witnesses and starting the trial process. Law
Prof. Kathleen Sullivan recently published
an essay in The Washington Post.
We wonder whether the interest of Stan
ford professors in an important national
debate has rubbed off on any of our peren
nially apathetic student body. Seeing histo
ry clearly play a role in contemporary poli
tics might spark more enthusiasm for
humanities classes and guest speakers on
campus.
Indeed, professors have historically
played a role in generating student voice on
controversial issues. Teach-ins were popu
lar during the Vietnam War era, and stu
dents continue to flirck to classes taught by
former government officials such as John
Taylor and William Perry.
While academic initiatives such as the
Presidential Lecture Series seek to bring
attention and enthusiasm to the Humani
ties, the best means of generating student
interest is undoubtedly the belief that
studying history and politics can be relevant
in the real world. We hope Stanford profes
sors continue to show students. Congress,
and the public that academics can play a
crucial role in current historv.
