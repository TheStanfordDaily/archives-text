## Every day is my lucky day 
### 
I NEVER REALLY
thought I was that
lucky. Growing up, I
measured myself pretty
low on the good fortune
spectrum. I never found a
four-leaf clover. I couldn't
match more than three

numbers in the lottery. I never hit a homer
in a real baseball game (only in practices
and on the computer, which don't count at
all). My eyesight is siekeningly far from 20-
20. I didn't fulfill my childhood dream of
being on "Star Search," and I couldn't beat
my best friend Peter in anything: wiffle
ball, poker, tennis, Nintendo, golf. No mat
ter what, Peter kicked my ass.
In fact, the only contest I ever really
won was at my eighth birthday party, and
even then I had to relinquish my winnings
(a helium-inflated balloon). It was, after
all. my party. "And it just wouldn't be fair
for you to have the balloon and your pre
sents, too, Johnny," said Mom.
Sigh. It was a nice balloon.
The years have passed, however, and
I've found it somewhat easier to deal with
the shortfalls of my hapless youth. Though
my childhood was clearly ill-fated. I man
aged to endure a painful existence. I've
somehow put the misery of adolescence far
behind me.
"John," you're undoubtedly saying,
"How? How do you do it? How do you
survive your excruciating memory of
youth?"

Friends — I can call you friends, right ?
— it isn't easy. But if you employ simple
reasoning, you should be able to follow my
logic. You see, I've come to the conclusion
that I, John Davi, am not the most
oppressed, encumbered, or unfortunate
person on earth. Hard as it is to believe, I
simply am not. Sure, I didn't get to do all
those things I mentioned above (I was,
after all, "unlucky"), but take a look at
some of the other things I didn't get to do:
I didn't develop a horrible disease in
childhood that left me permanently dis
abled, sick or dead. I wasn't born in a third
world country (or even some parts of the
United States), where food is scarce and
survival rare. I didn't grow up without par
ents. I didn't ever have to sleep on streets, in
cars or shelters. I didn't go cold and hungry.
My stockings weren't empty on Christmas.
I wasn't drafted at 18 and sent to
Europe or Vietnam with a gun on my
shoulder. I didn't lose my entire bank
account to a stock market collapse (though
I did sell some stock over winter break,
only to see it jump 40 points without me
last week). I didn't live in Hiroshima or
Nagasaki during World War 11, or any
where near Chernobyl.
It's not only the things I didn't do that
have convinced me. Let's take a minute to
explore that which I was able to do grow
ing up. I spent time playing in grass, look
ing for those four-leaf clovers, instead of
looking for handouts. I had extra dollars to
spend on the lottery and Nintendo games

and chewing gum and a million other
things, instead of on a slice of bread and
my one pair of jeans. I was able to play
baseball, to run and throw and hit, while
others could only watch and dream. Glass
es and contact lenses have corrected my
poor eyesight. And, really, my eyes aren't
anywhere near as bad as my Iriend Maija's
(now her glasses are thick).
Sure, I didn't end up on stage with Ed
McMahon, but I doubt I'd have gotten
more than two stars from the judges, any
way. Plus, appearing on "Star Search" is
probably about as significant as hitting a
home run in little league: 1 don't think it
would have made it onto my resume. And.
yeah. 1 never could quite get the best of my
friend Peter in wiffle ball or golf (or any
thing, for that matter), but you know
what? Let's compare SAT scores, Peter.
Then we'll see how you stand.
I guess "luck" is in the eye of the
beholder (or the Irish). Regardless, to call
myself unlucky is akin to calling Einstein
stupid. Baryshnikov clumsy or that big guy
at the post office affable. I'm lots of things
— among them spoiled, petty and impa
tient — but I'm not unlucky. I am blessed
beyond what I deserve, and, all too often,
unappreciative of what I have.
Gosh, I even have a column in the Daily.

John Davi, a senior majoring in public
policy, will never again call himself
unlucky. But he wishes he'd held onto that
stock.
