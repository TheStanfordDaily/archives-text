Geyser belittles culture
Thanks to Dan Geyser's January 12th
column, "Confronting Differences Honest
ly." I can finally come to terms with my
unseemly deviations from the cultural
norm.
Thanks, Dan, for making me realize that
my celebration of the ancient Hindu holy
festival, Diwali, is really driving a wedge
between myself and mainstream American
, society. Perhaps I should change my name,
which really must sound as ridiculous as any
Swahili word, to something more "Ameri
' can."
Despite your wisdom and vision, I'd say
you missed one thing: discrediting a cultural
tradition that you don't understand is
almost definitely not the best way to pro
mote social unity. It's not even that funny.
But I'm willing to help you out. Next winter,
come home with me to Texas: we'll hit up
Kwanzaa at my uncle's house, and then go
to his Southern Baptist church for Christ
mas (he celebrates both, can you believe
it?). We can also roll over to the communi
ty center when the Muslims break their
Ramadan fast, and maybe hit up the syna
gogue (to observe (C)hanukkkahahahah, as
you so eloquently put it).
You should try understanding some of
this country's religious and social diversity
before brushing it carelessly aside. And

understand this: offensive does not equal
funny.
Though you occupy his space, you are
not (the intelligent, amusing, and sorely
missed) Garry Grundy. Please find some
thing worthwhile to write about, and bring
your shock-value "comedy" routines to a
merciful end.

Tenure process discourages
professors and democracy
President Casper is great at making
dramatic, sweeping, symbolic gestures to
cover his fundamental contempt for aca
demic freedom and fairness in the tenure
process. His Presidential Lecture scries,
purportedly to boost the humanities at
Stanford, boasts many distinguished and
controversial speakers, but there seems to
be no willingess on the president's part to
back it up with a substantive increase in
funding to expand the humanities.
His research grant program for junior
faculty cannot compensate for the tenure
decisions by his administration, which have
sent a clear message to junior faculty that
their chances of achieving tenure are prob
ably a little better than winning the Cali

fornia lottery.
In his own words: "one does not earn
tenure...ln last week's Stanford Report
he went on to point out that tenure is not
about equity and that it is purely a judge
ment eall and predictive process. He did
not address any of the elements which go
into making those predictions. His admin
istrations overruled three faculty bodies in
denying tenure to Karen Sawislak. so the
judgement of academic peers is clearly not
part of that process. At least he has finally
laid to rest the notion that tenure is meri
tocratic system — "One does not earn
tenure."
How does Stanford expect to attract
and hold onto quality junior faculty if they
are expected to walk into an institution
which rejects advancement on the basis of
merit? Lecture series and modest research
grants cannot overcome the level of anxi
ety 1 have witnessed in the junior faculty in
the humanities department.
Young, innovative scholars are actually
questioning whether their subjects and
approaches to their subjects are dooming
their chances for tenure.
Certainly, the fact that Karen Sawislak
is a labor historian in an institution that
supports an electronics industry that is ter
minally hostile to organized labor cannot
be ruled out when one searches for reasons
why Casper would override the recom

mendations of his own academic advisory
board.
Giving her another year to reapply for
tenure is a lousy solution to her grievance;
it simply invites her to reexperience the
misery of a tenure review with no reason to
believe that she might obtain a different
result.
After all, she cannot "earn tenure" at
this point, and it seems the "prediction"
has already been made — why would it be
different next fall?
Casper would be undoubtedly be hap
pier if he didn't need the humanities to
legitimize Stanford as a prestigious univer
sity. If Stanford could maintain its prestige
as "Stanford Polytech," I have no doubt
he would dump the program and of all its
contentious, unruly, and irritatingly demo
cratic faculty members and students. 1
guess it's his tough luck that history, liter
ature, and the social sciences teach that
these very qualities are part of what it
means to be a citizen in a democratic soci
ety.
I just wish our administration would
realize that it needs to practice what it
preaches. Democracy, meritocracy and
academic freedom are the pillars of the
university.
