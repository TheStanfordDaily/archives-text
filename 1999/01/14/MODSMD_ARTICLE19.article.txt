## Beating the stress of standing out 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

II HINK MOST people spend about hall
their lives worrying. The other half is
probably spent sleeping — it' they can
after all the worrying that goes on in a day.
Ironically, while stress can make you ner
vous and ornery and can push you to your
emotional limit, worrying is probably a
good deal of what gets each and every one
of us through school.
The push to meet deadlines, perform at
our highest capability, absorb information,
and memorize formulas, compounds and
verses is what allows us passing grades,
opportunities for the future, and "actualiza
tion of our potential."
We feel a need to woo professors for
grades, friendship, connections, letters of
recommendation, academic support and
research endorsement.
Our leisure time is filled with teams, jobs,
musical groups, theater and community ser
vice. All these come with their own pres
sures and expectations.
It seems as if stress is as unavoidable as
thinking, breathing, and the math DR.
Take the seminar I am taking this quar
ter. It isn't anything too fancy. Eighteenth

century counterpoint. Most people don't
even know, or don't care, what counter
point is. My friend asked me if it had some
thing to do with needlework.
Regretfully, it is nothing quite as practi
cal as that. Instead, it is about the beginning
of modern musical harmonization. Just
think Bach, or the music they put on the
Victoria's Secret CD.
Regardless, here is this class that I have
to take to fulfill my major. It is interesting
enough, at 11 a.m., and features a very
knowledgeable professor not known to be
extremely hard. There should be what we
would deem minor stress.
But I buy my book and round up some
music paper, an economically correct click
er pencil, and a big. fat eraser and head off
to class. It's my senior year. I am used to
classes and used to my department and
rather fond of classes that don't start at 9
a.m., so I am doing a remarkable job allay
ing any worrying that might be expected.
Then I walk in on the first day of class to
find that I am the only one who will be tak
ing this class winter quarter.
Here begins added stress.

On one hand, I am blessed to have such
personal attention, especially at a school
where my Hum Bio friends constantly com
plain about classes of 300 students, where
the professor is nothing more than a pin
head 58 rows down and half the class is
forced to watch the lecture from a smaller
room with a screen located in Jersey. But
I'm playing singles.
What this really means is increased
learning and increased stress. There is no
one to hide behind when you don't know
the answer. I believe in interactive class
rooms and think nothing is as boring as sit
ting through over-educated, monotonous
babble for hours on end, but in this case, I
have to be the teacher's pet.
Here I am, all alone in a room with 36
desks. And there are times when I literally
want to sink into the floor. This often hap
pens on the days when my professor finds it
productive to make me sing what I have
written, all by myself. Not too good for
someone too embarrassed by her voice to
sing alone in the car.
But sing I do. Alone. There is no one to
look to. It is a solo performance, and

although I am pretty certain I did not know
that this is what I was getting into, I plug on.
Every day. Skipping class or even home
work, for that matter, is unthinkable.
My professor is looking to me to know
the answers and I am looking to myself to
perform at my utmost level. 1 wish 1 could
write like Mozart and sing like Renee Flem
ing, hut I am definitely still junior varsity.
Still, it is hard. Hard to take the times 1
am wrong. Hard to take the fact 1 don't
know all the answers. Hard to feel that I am
letting my professor down, and even worse,
hard to feel as if 1 am letting myself down.
That is what it all comes back to. You can
look at all the stress in the world, where it
comes from or how it materializes, but it all
comes back to you.
You may feel bad for letting down a pro
fessor, or stressed finishing endless papers,
or caught in an endless pursuit of incremen
tally more impressive degrees, but the one
tie to every worry is the complete horror of
letting yourself down.
Everything you try is a creation.
Whether you write music or a paper, do a
dance, run a marathon, make a friend or

form a thought, you put a little bit of
self out there alone. And the most stressful
scary thing in the world is standing up there
all alone, especially when you are holding
part of your self and creativity out there in
front of you for all to see. J
And the hardest part of it all is that not
everyone will like you or approve of what
you do. You won't always win or succeed!
Sometimes you can't think of the solution o#
hit the high note. j
Still worse than that, you might not eveij
try. You might hide in the corner of the lecj
ture hall or stop at just what needs to bq
done. Do the absolute minimum because ij
requires the least amount of stress and the
smallest part of you. i
Even if 1 am singing all alone, and break-j
ing mirrors at that, at least I am singing}
Besides, 1 have a feeling that all I am reallv
losing out on is some extra sleep.

work, for that matter, is unthinkable.
My professor is looking to me to know
the answers and I am looking to myself to
perform at my utmost level. 1 wish 1 could
write like Mozart and sing like Renee Flem
ing, hut I am definitely still junior varsity.
Still, it is hard. Hard to take the times 1
am wrong. Hard to take the fact 1 don't
know all the answers. Hard to feel that I am
letting my professor down, and even worse,
hard to feel as if 1 am letting myself down.
That is what it all comes back to. You can
look at all the stress in the world, where it
comes from or how it materializes, but it all
comes back to you.
You may feel bad for letting down a pro
fessor, or stressed finishing endless papers,
or caught in an endless pursuit of incremen
tally more impressive degrees, but the one
tie to every worry is the complete horror of
letting yourself down.
Everything you try is a creation.
Whether you write music or a paper, do a
dance, run a marathon, make a friend or

form a thought, you put a little bit of
self out there alone. And the most stressful
scary thing in the world is standing up there
all alone, especially when you are holding
part of your self and creativity out there in
front of you for all to see. J
And the hardest part of it all is that not
everyone will like you or approve of what
you do. You won't always win or succeed!
Sometimes you can't think of the solution o#
hit the high note. j
Still worse than that, you might not eveij
try. You might hide in the corner of the lecj
ture hall or stop at just what needs to bq
done. Do the absolute minimum because ij
requires the least amount of stress and the
smallest part of you. i
Even if 1 am singing all alone, and break-j
ing mirrors at that, at least I am singing}
Besides, 1 have a feeling that all I am reallv
losing out on is some extra sleep.
