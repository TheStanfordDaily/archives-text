# Law prof reflects on impeachment
## Rep. Campbell's vote 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Law School Prof. Tom Campbell has more than an
academic interest in the impeachment trial starting
today. As the United States Congressman representing
California's 15th District. Campbell, a Republican, re
cently voted to impeach President Clinton.
"It was not what I wanted to do." said Campbell, who
voted to impeach on two of four counts, "[but] I cast a
vote that I believed was right."
Reflecting on his role in the historic event. Campbell
called the Dec. 19 vote "the second most difficult vote
I've ever cast and probably will." The hardest vote, in his
view, was to approve the Persian Gull War in 1991.
Campbell characterized Clinton's impeachment by
the House of Representatives as "sad, sorry and disap
pointing."
Campbell said the evidence for the first article of im
peachment was serious enough to undermine his confi
dence in Clinton's ability to lead the nation. T his article
alleged that Clinton committed perjury in his August 17
grand jury testimony.

The trial of the President com
mences at 10 a.m. PST with
opening statements. See page 3

"[Clinton's] failure to tell the truth diminishes his
ability to serve as president," he said.
All but four of Campbell's Republican colleagues in
the House voted to impeach the
president. Regarding concerns that
the impeachment process reflected
partisan interests, Campbell re
sponded. "I voted what was right.
And 1 won't dispute that others did
too."
Campbell stated that he was not
influenced by House Republican
leadership to vote for the impeach
ment. The Republicans had a policy
against pressuring any members, ac
cording to Campbell.
However, Campbell revealed, he
was contacted several times by rep
resentatives of the White House
asking him to vote against impeach
ment. He was called by two cabinet
members, once when he was in
Africa, and also by celebrities such
as Robert DeNiro and Steve Jobs.
"I know the White House was
trying to put pressure on me," he
said.
Campbell received letters, e
mails and phone calls throughout
December from his constituency in
District 15, indicating that 45 per
cent were in favor of impeachment
and 55 percent were against.
He estimates District 15, includ
ing parts of Santa Clara and Santa
Cruz counties, to be 45 percent De
mocratic and 40 percent Republi
can.
Although Campbell declined to
speculate on the outcome of the
Senate's impeachment proceedings,
he said he hopes "the Senate does
the best by their best judgement, as
we did by ours. I'm happy to have it
behind me.
Currently, Campbell is teaching a

seminar on antitrust law for the Law
School's interim session. He agreed
to teach the class in place of Law
Prof. William Baxter, who died re
cently of emphysema.
"He's a fabulous teacher," said
Law School Dean Paul Brest. "He
has always been willing to be active
ly involved in the Law School."
This remained true even as
Campbell won his first Congression
al seat in 1989. After a brief stint in
the California State Senate from
1993 to 1995. Campbell was re-elect
ed to the House.
"He's someone who knows
about the legislature inside and
out," said Law School Prof. Robert
Weisberg, vice provost for faculty
relations. "But when he comes back
to campus he can talk about it with
an academic detachment."
Campbell joined the Stanford
faculty in 1983, after earning his un
dergraduate and doctoral degrees
from the University of Chicago and
his law degree from Harvard Uni
versity. After working as a lawyer
and for the federal government, he
jumped at the chance to teach at
Stanford.
Campbell has remained an active
faculty member, teaching at the
Stan ford-in-'Washington program
for several years and occasionally
commuting across the country to
teach on campus.
Campbell emphasized the differ
ences between life at Stanford and
life in the Capitol. At Stanford, he
said, "the system is conducive to
thought and intense focus on one or
two subjects." In Washington, how
ever, "there are one hundred issues.
The obvious trade-off is the depth.
One must make a decision and move
along to the next subject."
