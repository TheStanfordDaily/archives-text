## USC proves key game for Card 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
The usual Stanford women's basketball powerhouse
has been having a rough season. After being the leading
team in the Pacific 10 Conference for as long as many West
Coast teams can remember, the Cardinal's record is cur

This is quite unusual for a team with a coach such as
Tara VanDerveer who has guided Stanford to five Final
Four berths in the last nine years and two NCAA Cham

game," said VanDerveer.
Stanford is not only ranked higher, but currently retains
a better conference record than the Women of Troy (6-7,
2-2). Whereas Stanford has won two out of its last three
games, including crushing its cross-Bay rival California, the
Trojans have only won two of its last four.
USC also just experienced back-to-back losses at Ari
