## USC proves key game for Card 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
The usual Stanford women's basketball powerhouse
has been having a rough season. After being the leading
team in the Pacific 10 Conference for as long as many West
Coast teams can remember, the Cardinal's record is cur
rently below ,S(K) (6-8,2-1 Pac-10).
This is quite unusual for a team with a coach such as
Tara VanDerveer who has guided Stanford to five Final
Four berths in the last nine years and two NCAA Cham
pionships and who also has four gold medals as the coach
of manv national teams.

■ Tonight: Stanford (6-8, 2-1 Pacific 10 Conference) vs
USC (6-7,2-2), 7:30 p.m. Maples Pavilion.

But tonight at Maples Pavilion, Stanford will face the
USCTrojans and have a chance to help turn this into a win
ning season. The Trojans are currently ranked fifth in the
Pac-10 right behind Stanford. The Cardinal has won the
last nine games against USC with an average margin of vic
tory of 33.8 points. Another point that gives the Cardinal
hope to bring itself up to the .S(H) mark is that USC has not
won a game in Maples since the 1987-88 season.
"Our record is irrelevant. It is all about playing well
within our conference. USC has an aggressive defense,
some strong players, and will give us a really competitive
game," said VanDerveer.
Stanford is not only ranked higher, but currently retains
a better conference record than the Women of Troy (6-7,
2-2). Whereas Stanford has won two out of its last three
games, including crushing its cross-Bay rival California, the
Trojans have only won two of its last four.
USC also just experienced back-to-back losses at Ari
zona and in their own Lyon Center against Oregon. Al
though the losses seem to work against the Trojans, it also

the team. VanDerveer is still juggling
the lineup, switching around guards

ni with off-bench support from junior
Yvonne Gbalazeh and freshman
standout I indsey Yamasaki.
In past games, Yamasaki has car
ried much of the offensive scoring for

10th overall in the Pac-1().
Also, Flores has been important to
the ( 'ardinal's successes contributing
with strong offensive support, but has
struggled with scoring.
"Milena had an off-night in shoot

ing during the last game, but she kepi
up the other parts of her game: de
fense, floor leadership. We do need
her to score, though," said Van-
Derveer.
Despite all of Stanford's advan
tages over USC, VanDerveer is still
looking for improvement. I lie ('ardi

Yamasaki and Flores, but needs to
ameliorate its aggressiveness and
cause more problems for the oppo
nents' offense.
Hie one advantage the Trojans
have over Stanford is that they have
an older, more experienced team. At
the beginning of the year, four ol
US("s five starters were veterans.
Trojan senior Kristen Clark is out
with an injury, but the Cardinal will
still have to be prepared to play
against USC "s maturity.
"We have a talented team, but it
hasn't figured out how hard it has to
play," said VanDerveer, "and that,
more than anything, is a reflection ol
the team's youth."
