## Saying farewell to the very best 
### 
Gil Lopez

It's been our policy to refrain from
choosing professional athletics as
the main focus of any column we've
written, but today we had to make
an exception.
Michael Jordan has retired.

As basketball's Muhammed Ali
rides off into the sunset, the entire
basketball world bids him a fond
farewell and is left with the indelible
mark of Jordan standing at the top
of the key. his hand in the air as the
shot that won the 1998 NBA Finals
falls through the hoop. It's one of a
million memories we can look back
upon.
And of course sadness hangs in
the air as fans try to accept the fact
that Jordan's gone, but there's a
much darker storm on the horizon.
Where do we turn now?
Jordan's retirement marks the
official end of the glorv days of the

NBA. Magic Johnson and LarfvS
Bird rebuilt and revived the league*
when they entered the professional*
ranks in the '80s. and since then
ketball has enjoyed a growth in pop-J
ularity and wealth unparalleled by£
any other sport. , £
But times are bleak. Magic and, 4
Larry are gone. Kareem Abdul-'
Jabaar is coaching high school kids;«
out in the desert. Isiah Thomas srts.
in a broadcast booth for NBC'.v
Clyde Drexler is coaching in col-''
lege, and though he played up
last season, he never had a chance as"
long as Jordan was in the league. •,
These men were critical to the.j
league's popularity, but despite
their departure. MJ was around Jo,
keep us in awe.
You think the attendance |n.
Chicago is going to fall? How do you I
think the Clippers feel knowing that;
Jordan won't be in the Sports Arenas!
once a year to boost ticket sales? -
As cliche as it may sound. Jordan J
truly transcended the game. For all*
the bad attitudes and parole-viol at-/
ing prima donnas, you only neededi
one Michael Jordan to keep ydu«
coming back.
Now we're left without a leader.■


Gil
Lopez
Karl Malone? Charles Barkley?
Patrick Evving? They might be able
to get their elusive title rings now. but
they won't be able to enjoy them as
much knowing they needed to wait
for Michael to retire. And none of
them can take over as the league's su
perstar because of that.
So we turn our heads to the new
generation, but there we find men
like Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iver
son. They might be good, but they'll
never have the class, grace and com
petitive nature Jordan had.
Grant Hill was the great hope a
few years back. It didn't happen.
Hype exceeded talent. He can't do
what Michael did. He hasn't been
able to step up to that proverbial next
level when the time called for it.
This is the last thing the NBA
could afford. With a just-resolved
lockout, fans are going to be hard to

win back, but Michael could have
personally filled an arena.
Now, no one has that power, and
it's Michael's fault. With him around,
no one else had a chance to build a
winning tradition. It's like entering a
dance contest and having to go
against Fred Astaire. Good job, but
that guy made you look like you were
wearing cement shoes.
We look around the country and
try to figure out who's going to step
up and captivate us, but it will be
years before anyone can establish
himself as the ' second coming."
Baseball has Mark McGwire,
football has Terrell Davis, boxing has
Evander Holyfield. Basketball is left
with Kobe Bryant?
Perhaps I'm being unfair. Perhaps
I'm not giving anyone a chance to
prove himself. But when the bar is set
that high, it's hard to consider that
anyone might ever clear it.
