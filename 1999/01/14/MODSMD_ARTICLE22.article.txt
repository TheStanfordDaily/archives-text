### Jake Willens 
Four players on the men's tennis team will go to Santa
Barbara, Calif., today to represent Stanford in the Na
tional Collegiate Tennis Classic that begins on tomor
row.
Senior Ryan Wolters, junior Geoff Abrams, sopho
more Alex Kim and freshman K.J. Hippensteel will be
Stanford's four in a tournament which hosts the best four
players from the top eight schools in last year's rankings.

MEN'S TENNIS

■ Tomorrow: Four Cardinal players will compete in the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic.

All four Stanford players will play in the 32-man sin
gles draw and they will split up to make two doubles
teams in the 16-team doubles draw. Wolters and Hip
pensteel, currently the fourth-ranked doubles team in
the nation, will team up while Kim and Abrams, ranked
20 in the nation, will form the other pair. Three of the
men enter the singles draw with a top-20 ranking and all
four are in the top 35. Wolters stands at fifth, Hippen
steel at 17th. Kim at and Abrams at 35th.
A big part of these rankings were determined by how
the players fared in their two individual tournaments of
the season. The entire Stanford team played in the All -
American Tournament in Austin, Texas, and the above

four played in the Rolex qualifier at St. Mary's.
Wolters and Hippensteel won the doubles draw at St.
Mary's and Hippensteel pulled otf a £Ufipnse victory
over Wolters in two close sets in the singles final. As a
team. Abrams and Kim made it to the round of 16 in
Austin and the semifinals at St. Mary's. These results
clearly place all four in a good position to qualify for the
NC'AAs in May.
They are all aware, however, that it is a long season
and they must play consistently throughout to achieve
their goals. Wolters, the senior leader of the team, be
lieves this weekend will provide the four of them with
much needed match experience leading into their Pacif
ic 10 Conference season. He says he has worked hard on
his conditioning in the offseason and hopes to see the re
sults.
The results have come so far as he was a finalist at St.
Mary's and qualified as a wild card in the Rolex Cham
pionship in Dallas in early February. He is also excited to
assume the leadership role he is expected to fulfill.
"Last year there were more seniors and I could learn
how to set an example from them." Wolters said. "This
year I am trying to take what I learned and use it to help
the team."
His freshman partner Hippensteel thinks he has done
quite well.

Ryan Wolters and three other Cardinal men's tennis players head to Santa Barbara to compete In the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic beginning tomorrow.
"I am the only freshman on the
team and having Wolly as a par tner
has been great heeause not only is
he sueh a tough player, his attitude
is positive, his adv iee is solid, he has
confidence and he is a team player."
Apparently Wolters' advice has
paid off for the freshman. Hippen
steel lias made quite an impact »n Ins
first three months on the team. Mis
victory against Wolters at St. Mary's
automatically qualified him for the
Rolex < hampionship where he will
be in the singles draw and play dou
bles \vitli Wolters.
In addition to this, he fared well
in Austin, and continues to build
confidence leading into team match
es later this month.
Hippensteel is a freshman from
Roanoke, Va.. and even before his
.Stanford career he won the Junior
U.S. doubles title. I le is a bin, strong

lefty who hits the ball hard and
Wolters says he is a good comple
ment as a doubles partner. This
could leave the two of them in posi
tion once again to win this week
end's tournament.
Kim and Abrams also feel
healthy and ready to go. Kim said he
played well over the winter break
while hitting with former Stanford
player Paul (ioldstein and looks for
ward to playing with Abrams again.
"Cieolf and I play well together,
and we both are looking forward to
gaining more match experience this
weekend." said Kim.
Abrams agrees. "Alex is fun to
play with, and we are both healthy so
I am excited. All of these tourna
ments are to get us ready for the sea
son. but we know they also are im
portant in order to qualify for
NC'AAs."
Moth Kim and Abrams narrowly
missed qualifying for the NCAAs
last year and so they will try to use
that as extra motivation this season.
