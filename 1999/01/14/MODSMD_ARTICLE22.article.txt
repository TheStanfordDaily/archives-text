MEN'S TENNIS

■ Tomorrow: Four Cardinal players will compete in the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic.

All four Stanford players will play in the 32-man sin
gles draw and they will split up to make two doubles
teams in the 16-team doubles draw. Wolters and Hip
pensteel, currently the fourth-ranked doubles team in
the nation, will team up while Kim and Abrams, ranked
20 in the nation, will form the other pair. Three of the
men enter the singles draw with a top-20 ranking and all
four are in the top 35. Wolters stands at fifth, Hippen
steel at 17th. Kim at and Abrams at 35th.
A big part of these rankings were determined by how
the players fared in their two individual tournaments of
the season. The entire Stanford team played in the All -
American Tournament in Austin, Texas, and the above

four played in the Rolex qualifier at St. Mary's.
Wolters and Hippensteel won the doubles draw at St.
Mary's and Hippensteel pulled otf a £Ufipnse victory
over Wolters in two close sets in the singles final. As a
team. Abrams and Kim made it to the round of 16 in
Austin and the semifinals at St. Mary's. These results
clearly place all four in a good position to qualify for the
NC'AAs in May.
They are all aware, however, that it is a long season
and they must play consistently throughout to achieve
their goals. Wolters, the senior leader of the team, be
lieves this weekend will provide the four of them with
much needed match experience leading into their Pacif
ic 10 Conference season. He says he has worked hard on
his conditioning in the offseason and hopes to see the re
sults.
The results have come so far as he was a finalist at St.
Mary's and qualified as a wild card in the Rolex Cham
pionship in Dallas in early February. He is also excited to
assume the leadership role he is expected to fulfill.
"Last year there were more seniors and I could learn
how to set an example from them." Wolters said. "This
year I am trying to take what I learned and use it to help
the team."
His freshman partner Hippensteel thinks he has done
quite well.
