The Stanford men's basketball team is such a consen
sus favorite to win the Pacific 10 Conference this season
that several analysts have predicted that the Cardinal has
a chance to run the table on its conference schedule and
finish 18-0.
As ridiculous as such claims may seem, considering the
strength of the Pac-10. the difficulty of winning road
games and the predictably unpredictable nature of the
conference schedule, even the slightest chance that the
Cardinal may do the unthinkable is quite intriguing.
At the same time, thoughts of an undefeated run
through the Pac-10 inevitably remind fourth-ranked Stan
ford of last season's Arizona team, which was undefeated
heading into the last weekend of conference play as it
made the road trip to Los Angeles. In the second to last
game of the regular season, USC's Adam Spanich hit a
three-pointer at the end of regulation to send the game
into overtime, then nailed the game-winner as the over
time buzzer sounded, thus ending the Wildcats' hopes for
an undefeated campaign.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

â–  Tonight: No. 4 Stanford (13-2,3-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
at USC (10-3,2-2), 5 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Bay Area (SCBN
Ch. 49). RADIO: KTCT(IOSO AM), KZSU (90.1 FM).

So just as the Cardinal (13-2, 3-0 Pac-10) seems to be
rolling, undefeated through the first two weeks of Pac-10
play, it visits the site of that shocking upset, the L.A.
Sports Arena, to face the Trojans (10-3,2-2) tonight at 5
p.m.
Making the setting even more similar to that of the
upset last spring, Spanich is back at it for IJSC. Last week
the senior forward hit two three-pointers in the last 2.8
seconds to lift the Trojans to an 85-84 victory at Oregon.
If any team is up to the task of surviving the upset bug,
however, it is this veteran-laden Stanford squad. The Car
dinal has started the same five players for the last 20
games, and is 34-5 over the past two seasons when that
quintuplet begins the game on the floor.
That kind of continuity in the starting lineup has been
crucial for Stanford, which has been forced to weather the
storm of injuries that has plagued its bench.
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery has given the
starters more minutes in the past several games, and they
have responded brilliantly as a unit, maintaining a high
level of intensity throughout the game.
The Cardinal has posted 17 consecutive wins against
California schwls. but may have its hands full on the road
against IJSC.
The Trojans have the third best offense in the Pac-10.
and is in the top five in three-point shooting, rebounding,
turnover margin and steals.
Freshman guard Brandon Granville is second in the
Pac-10 in both steals (2.31 per game) and assists (5.46).
while freshman forward Sam Clancy's six blocks against
Oregon State put him atop the conference with 1.67 re
jections per contest.
In the game last Saturday against the Beavers, the
USC defense allowed Oregon State star Deandra Tanner
to have a career night, as the sophomore guard scored 27
points and grabbed 12 rebounds for his first career dou
ble-double.

Considering that Tanner, who was completely
trated bv Stanford's stilling backcourt defense, burned
the Trojans, there is a good chance that the Cardinal of
fense will be able to exploit some weaknesses in t he young
USC defense. .J
While Stanford, which is currently shooting 3<X perctnj
from beyond the three-point arc. will undoubtedly look
for substantial perimeter scoring against the Trojans, il
will also need to penetrate the lane and get some insidu
looks at the basket.
And if recent history is any indication, USC should
take one primary defensive approach into the Stanford
game: foul the Cardinal, and foul it often. j
For as of last weekend's games. Stanford was sixth iq
the Pac-10 in free-throw shooting, converting only 65 pcts
cent from the charity stripe. ,
"We weren't capitalizing on some
Sauer said last Saturday after the California game."
ing 17 free throws is giving back points. We've been one i S
the best free-throw shooting teams in the country the p.iMjl
few years, and we are going to have to get back to that irj
order to win the league."
