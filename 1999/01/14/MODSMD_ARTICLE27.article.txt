the magic ring which gives its wearers ultimate power. It is a story of

the sufferings of Wotan and the problems the gods have in repaying

Fafner and Fasolt, the giants who built Valhalla. The piece introduces
the main lines of The Ring's" dramatic conflict and many of the
cycle's main musical ideas. Tickets are $15, $12 students. The per
