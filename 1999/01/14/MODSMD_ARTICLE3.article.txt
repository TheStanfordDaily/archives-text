A recent gift of $2 million from
the David and Lucile Packard Foun
dation has provided Stanford's De
partment of Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering with the initial fund
ing needed for the department's
$7.5-million effort to renovate its
aging and obsolete facilities.
"This Environmental and Engi
neering and Science Program is the
leading program in the country,"
said AssL_Pr.of. Alfred Spormann.
"T he funds will help to strengthen
the current research, but also pro
vide the seed money to spearhead
new research in molecular environ
mental biotechnology by adapting
state-of-the-art tools of molecular
biologv and biochemistry."

The funds will be used for labora
tory renovation and upgrading and
acquisition of lab instruments,
specifically those for molecular en
vironmental biotechnology.
"As we move into the 21st centu
ry and the world of molecular biolo
gy. it is critical that we provide our
faculty and students with the tools
necessary to continue their remark
able work." said Jeffery Koseff, pro
fessor and chairman of the depart
ment.
Both undergraduate and gradu
ate students will reap the benefits of
this gift. The new research activity
will attract students from engineer
ing, biology and chemistry who are
interested in understanding funda
mental natural processes and stu
