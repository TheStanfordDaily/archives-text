# Civil engineering gets refit money
## 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
A recent gift of $2 million from
the David and Lucile Packard Foun
dation has provided Stanford's De
partment of Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering with the initial fund
ing needed for the department's
$7.5-million effort to renovate its
aging and obsolete facilities.
"This Environmental and Engi
neering and Science Program is the
leading program in the country,"
said AssL_Pr.of. Alfred Spormann.
"T he funds will help to strengthen
the current research, but also pro
vide the seed money to spearhead
new research in molecular environ
mental biotechnology by adapting
state-of-the-art tools of molecular
biologv and biochemistry."

The funds will be used for labora
tory renovation and upgrading and
acquisition of lab instruments,
specifically those for molecular en
vironmental biotechnology.
"As we move into the 21st centu
ry and the world of molecular biolo
gy. it is critical that we provide our
faculty and students with the tools
necessary to continue their remark
able work." said Jeffery Koseff, pro
fessor and chairman of the depart
ment.
Both undergraduate and gradu
ate students will reap the benefits of
this gift. The new research activity
will attract students from engineer
ing, biology and chemistry who are
interested in understanding funda
mental natural processes and stu
dents who want to use molecular bi
ology to solve environmental prob
lems, said Spormann.
Recent breakthroughs in molec
ular biology, microbiology and bio
chemical engineering are influenc
ing the field of environmental engi
neering. Environmental engineers
at Stanford and around the world
have been analyzing soil and
groundwater contamination, devel
oping an understanding of the mi
crobial and biochemical processes
capable of digesting specific pollu
tants. These processes break pollu
tants down into harmless byprod
ucts and demonstrate that these
bioremediation methods work.
There are two specific areas that
Stanford researchers intend to
study: pollution prevention and in
situ biotransformation.
To prevent pollution, researchers
can design industrial processes to
process hazardous waste. The waste
would be run through a bioreactor
containing microorganisms that
convert it into harmless or even use
ful products.

Scientists can also redesign man
ufacturing processes from the
ground up so that they do not pro
duce hazardous waste. This is called
"green chemistry."
In-situ biotransformation is an
extension of the advances that have
been made in bioremediation. For
example, scientists have developed
and field-tested methods that create
the proper conditions in under
ground aquifers for native bacteria
to digest pollutants.
Assoc. Prof. Craig Criddle, as a
graduate student, discovered a mi
crobe that breaks down the cancer
causing agent carbon tetrachloride
into non-toxic substances.
"We found that this bacterium
can remove more than 95 percent of
the carbon tetrachloride from [cont
aminated] groundwater" at a much
lower cost than conventional meth
ods, said Criddle.
Researchers believe that the inte
gration of biotechnology with envi
ronmental engineering has the po
tential to completely transform in
dustrial processes.
"Making use of this knowledge
will prove just how complete our un
derstanding is and will point to new
areas of research." said Spormann.
