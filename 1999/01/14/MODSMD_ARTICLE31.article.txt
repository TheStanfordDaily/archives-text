## Ani DiFranco 'up, up, up, up, up, up' 
### 
Next Tuesday, Ani DiFranco will come out
10th solo studio album, "up up up up up up"
(Righteous Babe), less than a year after 1998's
successful "Little Plastic Castle." Castle was well promoted
and sold notably well for an independent release. And
when I say "independent" that's what it really is for Ani
DiFranco. She owns the label and controls everything,
from production to promotion and from artwork to dis
tribution, with the help of half a dozen employees. She is,
by all definitions, a successful singer / songwriter and a
successful businesswoman. DiFranco is also an openly
bisexual feminist (for those who don't know) and speaks
about it loudly and proudly in many of her songs. Such
fierce financial and sexual independence makes her stand
out even in alternative crowds, and a hero to thousands of
women, some struggling through a musical career, others
struggling through life. And yet, most people probably
only know her through Alana Davis' cover version of "32
Flavors (and Then Some)," which is almost universally
hated among DiFranco fans.
Still, in certain circles, she's a fairly distinguished
singer, songwriter, and entrepreneur. DiFranco's business
professionalism is matched by her musical professional
ism. One doesn't come out with 10 albums and touch
thousands of devoted fans without learning something
about making music. The music is well matched to and
closely intertwined with the lyrics, her playing is pristine,
and yet she can still laugh at herself and dissolve a song
into a seemingly endless folk / funk jam, as she does on
the 13-minute closer, "Hat Shaped Hat."
Even her early albums resonated with a musical intelli
gence. She has grown from these early, spare folk albums,
experimenting in various musical, lyrical, and sound
devices, "up up up up up up" has many of these devices,
such as the organ and delayed melody in the dreamlike
"angel food." However, many songs, like the evocative

"Everest" and the political " Tis of Thee," are sparer,
recalling her earlier work. Even when Ani DiFranco is
being experimental, though, her music is still instantly
recognizable as singularly hers.

" Tis of Thee" is a political criticiosm of our country,
noting the game politicians play: "It's called criminalize
the symptoms / While you spread the disease" While most
of the songs on the album are about women and interper
sonal relationships, much of the album has a political
undercurrent — and not just regarding sexuality and fem
inism, the topics for which DiFranco is most well known.
After you hear Ani DiFranco's voice pushing "up up up up
up up," you realize she's also saying "the fingers of the
trees / And the lumberjacks with their bloody axes / Are
on their knees."
In "Angry Anymore," DiFranco sings, "I just want you
to understand / That I know what all the fighting was
for / And I just want you to understand / That I'm not
angry any more." She relates her relationship problems to
her family upbringing in an odyssey that most people can
identify with, either on the end of the narrator or that of
the significant other. She also confides, in "Virtue," "The
one person who really knows me best / Says I'm like a
cat / The kind that doesn't mind being held / Only when
it's her idea."
"up up up up up up" is part of a gradual progression for
DiFranco, and I am tempted to compare it to the similar
ly titled "Up" from R.E.M. The latter took a completely
new direction for that band, led by Michael Stipe, who is
also known for his politics and ambiguous sexuality. On
the basis of this comparison, DiFranco makes a good case
for gradual progression. I love R.E.M. and "Up" is an
enjoyable album. But on most days, I'd take the warmness
of "up up up up up up" over the professional gloss of "Up."
While DiFranco has earned the reputation of Angry
Feminist and while her album has political undercurrents,
"up up up up up up," in addition to being enjoyable, is a
touching and meaningful album.
