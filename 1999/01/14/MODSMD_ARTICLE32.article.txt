CC fmmm 14 is the area, everybody grab a friend
J and jump on in." So starts
/ Zebrahead's "Big Shot," a track off the
band's new album "Waste of Mind," and
although you may not live within the confines
of the 714 area code, you are probably quite
familiar with other groups from the southern
California's Orange County. Unlike the multi
tude of OC bands cluttering the music stole
shelves with albums lacking equally in creativi
ty and quality, however, Zebrahead isn't just try
ing to capitalize on area recognition from suc
cessful bands such as No Doubt and Offspring
who also hail from the 714.
"Waste of Mind" is a strong major label
debut for this quintet from La Habra after two
previous releases on the indie label Dr. Dream
Records. The members all went to the same
high school and were originally in separate
bands that just happened to be rehearsing in the
same studio. The four punk rockers and one
rapper found themselves hanging out together
after practices to try and create a new and inno
vative sound, and in 1996, Zebrahead was the
collaborative result.
Backed up by punk-style bar chords and
samples, Ali Tabatabaee's hip-hop rhymes bal
ance out Justin Mauriello's chorus vocals to
form an interesting blend of rap and rock that's
not quite Rage Against the Machine and not

quite Korn, but is definitely something to be
heard.
Some of Zebrahead's songs lean more toward
one genre than another, such as the rap-heavy
"Time," or the melodic pop / ska on "Move On."
The single "Jag Off" has received some radio
airplay, but its slower tempo is not really repre
sentative of the rest of the album in general.
Zebrahead's style is practically indefinable,
which is why it rises above other current releas
es with a sound that doesn't just claim to be
fresh.
The industry has also taken note; the band
was named "Best Orange County Band" at the
1997 L.A. Music Awards. The buzz Zebrahead
built up around themselves just through live
shows and extensive local touring apparently
had major labels fighting over them before they
were even signed. Columbia won the bidding
war, but the group is more pleased with the
growth of its music than wallets or recognition.
The band members still write all their songs
collectively in the rehearsal room. They still rec
ognize their California roots. And most of all,
they make sure that listeners will notice the
inventiveness, hard work and effort that goes
into the final product. On "Waste of Mind," this
combination does not go unnoticed.
