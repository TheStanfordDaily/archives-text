## 'Anthem' 
### 
I can't help myself. I simply must point out that "Anthem," the title track
of Goodness' eponymous album, is not terrible, but it does lack any hint
of some ambition or cause to justify the stirring, flag-waving type of
song which U2 used to pump out in the '80s.
Why give this unanthemic song the title "Anthem"? I have tortured
myself all week trying to think of a reason. Singer Carrie Akre announces in
the chorus of this song that, "This is a call of you to come around, round,
etc... / There is a reason to get out of bed / Make some sound /1 don't
always have the answers / But I know it can be found." Think about that the
next time you're clapping with one hand.
"Anthem" could be a decent radio single, rocking adult contemporary a
bit harder than the current offerings from Matchbox 20, Eve 6, or other
mainstream acts of the moment. Like those bands, though, Goodness suf
fers from Hootie disease: It sounds like a great bar band that somehow
found itself in a recording studio and recorded a boring bar band record.
There is nothing specifically wrong with this recording. Akre has a fine
voice, and the rest of the band deftly swings in the contemporary classic
rock mode (OK, 1 made that term up, but imagine a blend of the Pretenders
and Tom Petty).
That said, the rest of the album is unfortunately a bleak mess of plodding
mid-tempos, crunching white blues, and anti-climactic choruses. The big
problem is timing. This band seems to know neither how to speed up nor
how to slow down. Also, several of these chugging filler songs simply go on
too long, with half of the album's tracks clocking in at four or more min
utes.
As for the lyrics, well, let's let Akre quote herself from "Cozy," the closing
song: "Float away float away / High above trees / On the ground I hold
hands with two women / Someone has died / And my body starts to
cry / These are the things that I dream." Enough said.
