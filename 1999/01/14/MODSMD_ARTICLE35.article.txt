## 'Extinction Level Event' 
### 
Busta Rhymes always does something differ
ent. Whether it is his clothes, beats, rhymes
or lifestyle, Busta Rhymes epitomizes the
word "unique." On his third album in as many
years, Busta Rhymes has become a full-fledged
hip-hop superstar. He has come a long way since
his days as a member of Leaders of the New
School. His new album "Extinction Level Event:
The Final World Front" uses many of his old styles
combined with new ingredients. Most notably is
an unexpected duet with Ozzy Osbourne, which
brings together the seemingly incompatible
worlds of heavy metal and hip-hop. This song is
the first of many efforts to combine rap with rock
to succeed.
Unfortunately, "What it's Gonna Be" with Janet
Jackson remains uninspired and disappointing,
leaving the listener expecting more. Producers
that contribute to the project include DJ Scratch,
Jamal and Swizz Beatz.
The general theme of the album deals with the
end of the world, which Busta Rhymes claims will
occur at the new millennium on a number of
hilarious skits throughout the album. "Extinction
Level Event" includes a variety of party jams that
will be on every club's playlist. These include "Do

the Bus a Bus," "Take it Off" and the first single off
the album "Gimmie Some More." Two exception
al songs that should satisfy Busta Rhymes' core
audience include "Tear Da Roof Off" and "Against
all Odds," which features Busta Rhymes' crew, the
Flipmode Squad.
Perhaps the album can be summed up in one
song, "Extinction Level Event (The Song of
Salvation)," which has a catchy chorus celebrating
the end of the world. Busta describes this
Armageddon with, "Holy amazing grace about
face / Total erase you niggaz off the face of the
place / Such a shame I had to go grab the cali
co / Pass the dough before you find out what 1 had
to blast you for / Extreme laws for ones who did
try to go against this / Wet your shit up like a slop
py tongue kiss." The album peaks when East meets
South and Flipmode Squad meets No Limit as the
two craziest men in rap music, Busta Rhymes and
Mystikal, come together on "Iz They Wildin' Wit
Us and Gettin Rowdy Wit Us." Both rappers fire
lyrics at an incomparable speed, nearly exploding
out of the speakers. After all is said and done,
Busta Rhymes leaves you screaming, "Flipmode is
the Greatest!"
