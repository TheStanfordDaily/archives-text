## 'Rhythm-al-ism' 
### 
The name of the game on DJ Quik's fourth album is fun. Almost
all the songs on this hip hop veteran's latest album "Rhythm-al
ism" (Profile / Arista Records) are dedicated to living the good
life. That would seem to be little different from DJ Quik's previous
pimp-style albums, but "Rhythm-al-ism" is more about the positive
"just-kicking-it" style of fun.
The title song and "We Still Party" display this element of fun.
Coming from Compton and entering the rap game in 1991, Quik has
dropped name-calling for this album. There's no East and West on this
one and no beef with any other artists. There's only music, high spirits
and good energy. Even "Youz a Ganxta" is turned into something posi
tive. Quik says the song is about his musical and creative output.
DJ Quik defines Rhythm-al-ism as the musical equivalent of being
high and says that he gets a buzz off music: "It's kinda like a high —
you can get high off the music. That's what 'Rhythm-al-ism' means."
Well, the rhythms this songwriter, rapper and producer puts forth on
the album are definitely capable of getting you hyped up at the club.
The music is upbeat and the choruses are catchy, but whether or not
the music is capable of putting you in an altered state of mind and
being remains to be seen.
The music on "Rhythm-al-ism" is a blended mixture of hip-hop and
funk, ready to be blasted at a club or bumped along to in the car. Quik
says the George Clinton and Funkadelic influence will probably always
remain and be reflected through his music. According to Quik, "It's just
a funky good feeling."
Quik has been known for his pimp and playa music and he's famous
for his sexual hits "Sweet Black P***Y,"'"Mo p**»Y" and "Can I Eat It?"
"Rhythm-al-ism" wouldn't be complete without the signature DJ Quik
track "Medley for a V (TheP***Y Medley), featuring Snoop Dogg, Nate
Dogg, AMG, 2nd to None, Hi-C and El Debarge. This medley shows
that for all Quik's positivity and new focuses, some things haven't
changed one bit.
