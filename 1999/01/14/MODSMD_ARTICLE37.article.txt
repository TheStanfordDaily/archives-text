# Winter Tales
## Cover Story It's One Acts time again 
### Joshua Robin Contributing writer 
It's Sunday evening in a darkened Nitery, one of the final dress rehearsals before
Winter One Acts opens tomorrow. Wires dangle precariously from ceiling outlets. A
blue lamp illuminates the lighting technicians. Actors' raucous warm-ups of alter
nating humming and screaming emanate from backstage.
On the stage, in front of gossamer curtains, are a simple couch, nondescript chairs
and an empty bottle of Manischewitz wine: a prop, I'm later told, that will be replaced
with one which will more realistically replicate a vodka bottle to be finished — toast
by inebriating toast — by the end of the first one act, James Copland's "Petersburg."
For a long time (whose exactitude no one seems to know for certain), Ram's Head
Theatrical Society has warmed away the foggy winter chill with its Original Winter
One Acts. This year proves no exception, though the One Act talent today represents
a cross section of the Stanford dramatic community. The set of 1999 performances
marks the Ram's Head debut for not only the show's producer, senior Avery Willis,
but for Alice Bugman, director of the second play, "Dice," written by Mark Ganek, as
well as several major characters in both shows.
That several members of the cast and crew are Ram's Head neophytes is hardly as
impressive as the fact that this year's Winter One Acts represents Bugman's director
ial debut as well as the first major performance of the both writers' works. As
Bugman, Ganek and Copland are in their early 20s, maybe this is expected, though it
is far from obvious. According to Willis, who coordinated the selections for the
shows' directors, "Petersburg" and "Dice" were chosen in October from 20 original
submissions from students.
The theme of the 1999 Winter One Acts is "The last year of the millennium," cho
sen also as the theme for Ram's Head's 1998 Gaieties, "Farmageddon." While
"Petersburg" and "Dice" were not solely selected based on whether or not they fit an
apocalyptic theme, it is clear that they do. They probe fundamental questions about
our existence, how we cope with the specter of death, and, as Willis said, "are intense
studies 0f... the way in which humans interact with each other," issues that have
been repeatedly raised by the prospect of a major catastrophe poised to fall by the
first of next year.
While Winter One Acts traditionally consists of three plays, the performances were
reduced to two this year after the directors of junior Allison Schroeder's "Playing
Dumb" changed sections of her script without her permission or the producers'
knowledge, Willis said. After the show had already been cast and rehearsed for a
month, Willis convened a meeting of the Ram's Head executive board, which decid
ed to cancel "Playing Dumb."

Kyle Alisharan, a sophomore and co-director of "Playing Dumb," said that the can
cellation was due to a difference in ideas among the writer, the director and the
Ram's Head Board and that he felt no animosity to those responsible for canceling
the show.
Alisharan, who directed the show with his brother Ryan, said; "We needed to make
some changes in order to make this work accessible to the actors. I'm not angry. We
all just came in with different ideas."
Replacing the final play will be a performance of an improvisation troupe that is
an "off-shoot of Sponge and Simps," according to Nik Charov, a junior and the
group's coordinator. Charov said that the troupe will perform "long-form improv" or
an entire one act play that will be done on the fly with the audience providing the plot
and characters.
"It's the holy grail of improv," Charov said, adding that it is daunting for the group
not only "to sustain and keep entertaining" improv for all of Winter One Acts' nine
performances, but to maintain quality when the number of improvisers will vary
nightly. While the group lists about 12 to 15 members, Charov said, "some nights, we
only expect three."
I was told that "Petersburg" and "Dice" are similar. Admittedly, though, I see the
similarity only in the plays' underlying existential themes; on the surface, the two
couldn't be more different. If what's spoken in "Dice" is the play, it's the absence of
that which makes "Petersburg."
"Petersburg," which is actually set in present-day Moscow, is bleak and dark.
According to director Kingsley Willis, brother of Avery, there is a profound
Chekhovian influence on its writing, though it reminded me more of something by
Eugene O'Neill.
In "Petersburg," I cringed at the deliberate discomfort on stage and the pervasive,
heavy silence that seemed to envelop the set. Especially disconcerting was the awk
ward Lorenti, well-played by sophomore David Goehring, and the forced relation
ship between Spiel (senior John Knag) and his wife Ela (sophomore Jenn Lindsay).
Kingsley Willis said that he had to "dissect every line to figure out the characters'
motivations," adding that there's as much meaning in the silence as there is in the
speaking. "Every pause is there for a reason," he said backstage. "There are minutes of
awkward silence."
"Dice's" milieu in a windowless cell where music is constantly blasted isn't the
most uplifting scene. But its dialogue and color are far brighter than that of
"Petersburg." Despite the bleak plot, "Dice's" writing is unyieldingly funny and sharp,
delivered at breakneck pace and rich to the point of overflowing.
While "Dice" employs an overused topic — what people will do to escape after
they have been beaten, interrogated and trapped for months — the writing was some
