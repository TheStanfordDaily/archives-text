# Movie Review
## Hail, Wondrous Bard 'Shakespeare' is alive and kicking 
### Sharon Armstrong Editorial staff 
When first I sat down to write
this review, after my second
screening of "Shakespeare
in Love," the opening phrase that came
to mind, oddly enough, was "Friends,
Stanford students, countrymen, lend
me your eyes." After taking the oppor
tunity (and a paragraph) to let myself
get all of the allusory cutesy goo out of
my system, it was rather clear that such
an opening for such a review —
despite being clever, witty and just a
little saucy (not to mention a weeding
tactic for those less literary movie
watchers out there) — would never
theless be a little silly. So I scrapped it.
A part of me still itches for that
opening though, for one simple rea
son — the very merits of it would have
set the stage (no allusion intended) for
a comedy about Shakespeare employ
ing those self-same traits of cleverness,
sharp wit and sauciness in its very own
script, exquisitely directed and beauti
fully acted. In short, it would have
been incredibly catchy; maybe even a
little astute.
But I digress. However, even such
digression is perhaps apt jargon with
which to discuss "Shakespeare in

Love." The first layer of the plot is a simple one: A young
Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), working in London as
a budding playwright, has writer's block. The seeds of his
newest play, "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,"
have been planted, but have yet to germinate. The cause?
Will has lost his beacon of beautiful words, his summon
er of ideas great, his muse extraordinaire; in short, his
love-life is so lack-luster that inspiration is as hard to find
as sunshine on a mid-winter London day.
But Will's troubles are only beginning. In a city in
which only two brave theatres make up the artistic scene,
are under the constant threats of closure by the Master of
Revels, outbreaks of the plague and clogs in cash flow, the
Bard must play his cards right with the people who would
pay him (or not). All the while, he must keep his head up

even under the guise of his undisputed predecessor (and
the darling of current theatre circles), Christopher
Marlowe (Rupert Everett).
Enter Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), the shim
mering daughter of a wealthy merchant. Despite her
bourgeois birth, Viola is utterly enchanted by the work of
Master Shakespeare. She quotes the poetry of his plays by
heart and flutters her eyelids in ecstasy at his presence.
Confiding in her nurse after a particularly rapturous
viewing of his latest work, Viola announces that she will
have love and passion in her life no matter the conse
quences.
The next day, Viola (in gentlemanly tights and a jaun
ty cap with a feather stuck in it) proves her passion by
auditioning for the production of "Romeo and Ethel,"

delivering Shakespeare's
own words for her mono
logue and giving her name
as Thomas of Kent. Will,
astounded and flattered
that his work has reached
the exalted realm of audi
tion piece, follows her
(dressed all the while as a
him) home. Still con
vinced that she is a he, Will
crashes the party at her
parents' manor to find out
more about the mysteri
ous actor. Instead, faster
than he can say "Zounds!"
he is smitten from the
moment he sees Viola in
her true form — that of a
golden-haired maiden.
Too bad the purpose of the
party is to start marriage
negotiations between her
and the nasty Lord Wessex
(played by our favorite cad

Colin Firth).
But as in any Shakespearean romance, the show, and
the love affair, must go on. The two lovers, one already
married (Shakespeare's family is in Stratford) and one
promised to another, begin a relationship that inspires —
you guessed it — the glorious "Romeo and Juliet."
Throughout the romance are interspersed some of the
best comedic speech and performances of this year.
Geoffrey Rush, taking a turn from the nasty role he played
as a loyal but evil advisor in the recent "Elizabeth" (also
starring Fiennes) plays Philip Henslow, the owner of the
Rose theatre and Shakespeare's immediate boss. Henslow
is neither smart nor excessively artistic — and that's
exactly what makes him so charming in his bumbling
role.
Ben Affleck and Tom Wilkinson ("The Full Monty")
also deliver incredibly on-key roles as (respectively) Ned
Alleyn, a cocky actor who thinks all Shakespearian drama
should be written expressly for him, and Mr. Fenneyman,
the mob boss who finances the Rose with a chain-mail
fist, but turns to grateful putty when Shakespeare offers
him the role of the apothecary in "Romeo and Juliet."
But without argument, it is Gwyneth Paltrow who
steals the show. As a radiant (yes, every one of these glossy
terms of hyperbole are fitting) Viola, Paltrow gives her
best performance yet. Paltrow has grown into her own in
real life, and her independence and charm shine through
in her character.
Last, but certainly not least, the utmost credit must be
bestowed upon the writers, Tom Stoppard and Marc
Norman, who have not only written the best comedic
script of the year, but have rewritten Shakespearean his
tory with a script that knows it is incredibly smart and
clever, but has enough grace to do so without arrogance.
And so, friends, Stanford students, countrymen, in
light of the following passage, I have only these parting
words:
Get thee to the movies!



Don't they make a smashing couple, mate?


I'm crushing your head! I'm crushing your head!
