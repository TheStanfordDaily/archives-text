## Gettin' Some 'Action' This film works best outside of the courtroom 
### 
« a Civil Action" is nominally a courtroom
Z\ thriller, but it's at its best when it leaves the
JL V trial behind. In your average legal drama, the
trial is central to the action; here, the point of the toxic
waste lawsuit against two Boston corporations is to be as
tedious and boring as possible. It's a courtroom drama
without any courtroom drama. The real story is that of
the lawyers, with their electric personalities and ultimate
ly tragic flaws. This cinematic sleight of hand isn't easy;
the film visibly battles with its own complexity at times.
When the actors can shed the burden of the plot, though,
both the leading and supporting cast deliver brilliant per
formances that carry the movie.
The film is based on Jonathan Harr's bestselling book
of the same name, based on a dense and tangled true
story. In the early '80s, an epidemic of leukemia and
deaths of children in a small Boston suburb leads eight
families to suspect contamination of their town's notori
ously foul-smelling water. Jan Schlichtmann (John
Travolta), a hot-shot personal-injury lawyer, agrees,
almost in passing, to look at the case. When he discovers
two multimillion-dollar corporations' industrial plants
near the river in the town, he immediately sets his tiny law
firm to the task of milking the case for all it is worth. To
call Schlichtmann flamboyant would be a criminal
understatement; he's out to prove he's one of the big boys
and drives the Porsche to back it up.
The real big boys, though, are not to be cowed. William
Cheeseman (Bruce Norris), a nervous, high-strung litiga
tor, is hired to represent one company, and Jerry Facher
(Robert Duval!) defends the other. Facher is far and away
the most intriguing character in the movie. He's a soft
spoken, sympathetic man, rumpled, age-worn and deeply
endearing. At the same time, he serves as the implacable
and devious wall against which Schlichtmann's eager
glory hound hurls his ego again and again. As the trial
proceeds, Schlichtmann grows more and more desperate,
both personally and financially, even as Facher settles into
his element.
The incredible nature of the story and the strength of
the two lead performances — particularly Duvall's —
should be sufficient to make this movie Oscar material.
The filmmakers, though, struggle against the gaudy
courtroom construction they're stuck with, and often
have difficulty leading the audience's attention away from

the anticlimactic details of the trial. The events of the
movie aren't the real point — it's Schlichtmann's tale of
his financial ruin and professional destruction. The sup
porting cast members, notably William H. Macy's
increasingly frantic accountant, have stellar moments as
they are caught up in Schlichtmann's whirlwind of ener
gy. Macy and Tony Shalhoub (T.V.'s "Wings", "The Siege")
lend a theatrical validity to the firm's tragic fall.
The film approaches its true potential at the end:
Schlichtmann, sitting king-like in the last remaining chair

of his barren office, maintains a surprising and welcome
dignity in the face of defeat. In the last third of the movie,
with the trial ending and the pacing drastically slowed,
every line and expression that passes between Travolta
and his team bears a powerful weight. Only then does the
film leave its courtroom roots behind to become a well
played and tragic personal drama.
