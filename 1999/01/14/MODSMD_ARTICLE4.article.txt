At 5:00 a.m.. it's cold, quiet and
very dark at the entrance to Wilbur
dining hall. A solitary figure is mov
ing around inside, heating up the
large grill, switching on various appli

15 people to eat breakfast. One bv
one. students observing the Muslim
holy month ol Ramadan start to ar
rive with eyes still heavy from sleep.
They load up their trays, knowing
that the food eaten now will have to

morning. Members of the Stanford
Islamic Society met with Executive
Chef Rafi Taherian to work out an
arrangement for the meal during the
two weeks that Ramadan coincided
with winter quarter.
