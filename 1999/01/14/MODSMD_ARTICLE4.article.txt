# Annual fast brings Muslims together
## 
### Deanne Corbett Contributing writer 
At 5:00 a.m.. it's cold, quiet and
very dark at the entrance to Wilbur
dining hall. A solitary figure is mov
ing around inside, heating up the
large grill, switching on various appli
ances and laying out enough food for
15 people to eat breakfast. One bv
one. students observing the Muslim
holy month ol Ramadan start to ar
rive with eyes still heavy from sleep.
They load up their trays, knowing
that the food eaten now will have to
sustain them from sunup to sun
down. or precisely 5:08 p.m. Fasting
from food and drink during daylight
hours is a major feature of Ramadan,
which began on Dec. 20 and will end
one lunar month later with the /.id
Alfitar. or "112 estival of Fast-Break
ing."
Muslims who celebrate the holi
day in the I Jnited States usually do so
without much recognition from their
neighbors oi difkrent laiths. I his
year, though awareness about Ra
madan and it-, traditions has been
much greater due to President Clin
ton's decision to bomb Iraq before
the holy month began. The bombings
dime after Iraq's repeated failures to
®>mpl\ with United Nations
weapons inspectors
i I hi month oi fasting is meant io

teach Muslims about self-restraint. It
is one aspect of a total focus on denial
of the senses during Ramadan. The
holiday celebrates the revelation of
the holy book of the Koran to the
prophet Muhammad.
The breakfast eaten before sun
rise is called the suhoor. This is the
first year that Housing and Dining
Services has assisted Muslim stu
dents living on campus by providing
them with a meal so early in the
morning. Members of the Stanford
Islamic Society met with Executive
Chef Rafi Taherian to work out an
arrangement for the meal during the
two weeks that Ramadan coincided
with winter quarter.
According to junior Shaflique
Adam. Dining Services doesn't like
to give refunds when students are
forced to miss meals for some reason,
as is the case with students who are
fasting.
"They realized they had to do
something." Adam said, adding that
Dining Services cooperated well
when they saw there was a need to
fill.
For Dining Services employee
Nancy Herrington, filling the need
has meant getting up at 3:30 a.m. each
day to arrive at Wilbur by 4:30. She
cooks breakfast for the students ob
serving Ramadan, then works her
regular shift until 2:30 p.m.
"I'm pretty tired when I get off,"
she said. "And I try to get to sleep
earlier." Still, she says it's been nice to
see familiar faces every morning.
The suhoor must be finished by
sunrise, at which time the call to
prayer is sung out in Arabic. The
plaintive, lyrical chant resonates
above the clatter of dishes from the
kitchen and the sound of Velcro on
ski jackets as students ready them
selves to prav. Several students un
fold colorful prayer mats. Everyone
removes their shoes. An orderly line
is formed facing east — men in front,
women in the back
"Conic to prayer; Come to good
deeds; Prayer is better than sleep."
When the prayer ends, the stu
dents gather their things and head
out — some back to their dorms for
more sleep, others determined to
stav awake and study.

Ayesha Khan, a senior, admits
that fasting is hard when combined
with classes and biking around.
"It does affect your work." she ad
mitted. Khan said she hasn't been
able to do her work during the day.
She does most of her studying at
night, after eating at the iftar, the
daily breaking of the fast at sunset.
Despite difficulties, Muslim stu
dents who fast keep it to themselves.
"It's between you and God," said
junior Fahd Bamgash. "No one can
tell vou're fasting — it's verv person
al."
Fasting is compulsory for Muslims
who are physically and mentally fit.
Typically, children don't start fasting
until they've reached puberty, but
the excitement of joining in a rite of
passage ritual prompts many chil
dren to start earlier.
In countries where Islam is the
main religion, the streets are empty at
sunset during Ramadan. Families
wake together to begin the fast at
daybreak. But here at Stanford, the
followers of Islam gather while the
campus thrums with activity at sun

down and sleeps at sunrise.
In contrast to the suhoor held at
Wilbur that is attended by only a
dozen students willing to brave the
cold, the Islamic Society's iftar. held
each day at the Escondido Village
Center, is attended by a crowd of
anywhere from 60 to 100 people.
On Monday night, a group of
seven women volunteered to cook
the meal, which always starts with
dates and a drink of milk or water to
break the fast. They were still carry
ing trays of chicken, potatoes, salad
and Hat bread to an already heavily
laden table when the call to prayer
sounded again. Only after the
evening prayer can people eat.
The iftar at Stanford is different.
Muslims of many nations are repre
sented in the community center.
"At home, you celebrate with
your family, so it's the same group of
people and the same food." Khan
said. She looked around the room at
the diverse group of people who have
come to know each other over the
past weeks. "It's kind of sad when it
all ends." she added.
