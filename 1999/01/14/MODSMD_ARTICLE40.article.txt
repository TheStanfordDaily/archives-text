# Simply 'Devine'
## 'Ned' is about life, larceny arid laughs 
### 
Once in a while, a movie comes along and makes you smile. "Waking Ned
Devine" follows a couple of other imports — "The Postman" and"The Full
Monty" — and follows their lead by being wonderfully light-hearted and sen
timental. With no big-name stars or filmmakers behind "Devine," the movie graceful
ly closes with a storybook finish and a few surprises in just 91 minutes.
The vistas that appear throughout the film are simply beautiful. Art director Mark
Tannen, who also worked on the set of "Saving Private Ryan," serves up a fanciful feast
of panoramic shots spotlighting the rolling hills and sparkling seas of Ireland. But per
haps the faces in "Devine" are what make the entire far-fetched story work. The vivid
characters in "Devine" force us to focus on the personality and the charm of the story,
rather than the sexual appeal and major celebrities that name recognition films have
heavily relied on.
Jackie O'Shea and Michael O'Sullivan are two life-long friends who are in search of
the latest winner of the British lottery. They know it is someone in the town of TUlaigh
Morh, population 52. This size decreases by one once the companions realize that
townsman Ned Devine suffered a heart attack when he jubilantly realized that he had
the winning numbers.
The question: Do the guys try to claim the ticket? It would be a major crime for one

of them to impersonate the "lucky" dead man, but they try their best to get the town's
full support. If a lottery official arrives — and one does the town of Tulaigh Morh
must be prepared to insist to the official that Ned Devine is indeed alive and ready to
claim the ticket.
The problem: Cranky old spinster Lizzy Quinn, in a terrific performance by Eileen
Dromey, does not want any part of the bargain. She is ready to claim a partial reward
for reporting the crime to the British officials. The ending, which is too precious to pre
dict or describe, settles one's spirit perfectly.
Long-time stage and screen actors lan Bannen and David Kelly shine as the dynam
ic duo in the film. They share a lot of experiences in the film, from skinny dipping in
icy waters to forgery of documents, and the comic timing elevates the movie to a high
er level. It is very likely that you've seen one of them on screen, since their credits
include "Gandhi," "Ghost Dad," "Braveheart" and "A Man of No Importance."
I must admit that the story, laden with fairly thick Irish accents, is very lightweight,
and a side story involving a smelly pig farmer and a single mother gets a bit tiresome.
But the unexpected often happen*, to my delight, in "Waking Ned Devine," a film with
a sure handle on the joys of rural, small-town Irish living.
