# 'Joe' Schmo
## A
						'Mighty' big waste of time

nt Is such ft powerful force in Hollywood is that it
112 1 can keepj*|i|sfe amu»dat the same time as the kids. That's pretty much what
so frustrating for me — it offered absolutely noth
ing 10 entertain the grownups, while the action for the kid* teetered over the violence
Take what first few minutes of the movie. Some mean poachers go
huntmgln the African kill the mother of a baby gorilla named Joe. What's
even more disturbing is that #<* poachers accidentally shoot Dr. Ruth Young (Linda
Purl)* «n American scientist who is studying wildlife with her little girl Jill. Both Jill
and Io« happen to witness the deaths. tW$ not the way I would open up a family
movie, but Disney seems to get a kick out of the brutal murders of parental figures.
Jlllft any case, 12 years pass as the two orphans ipow up in Africa. Jill (Charlize
plfhetonfassumes the role of Joe's caretaker, the gorillas have aban
doned him. It turns out that Joe has the gene for an interestmgjform of gorilla gigan
| tism; making him into a 2,000-pound animal who shakes the ground as he walks.
:-f|oe becomes the object of fascination for another American
(Bill Paxton). When more of the evil poachers threaten Joe's survival, Gregg
i : taking him to an animal reserve in Los Angeles (because as we all kn6w, i.A. hi
■ safest place in the world for animals).
The glorified zoo seems like a pretty nifty place for Joe, until one of those bad old
poachers, Strasser (Rade Serbedzija), pays him a visit. Strasser provokes Joe intoalW|
that leads to his escape from the reserve. Jill and Gregg have to find Joe in the streets
of Hollywood before Strasser and the LA.P.D. put an end to the confused gorilla.
There's no way to prevent a story like this from being incredibly predictable and
cheesy. Still, I read that it.actually worked in the original "Mighty Joe Young," a 1949
RKO film, because it focused on a big ape that was friendlier than your average King
Kong-
Disney's updated version, sadly, falls prey to a bad, bad script We see Joe throwing
people around like toy soldiers (more "fun" for the kids)*and it looks like the creators

were just looking for excuses to ptlt lum «?ld the
Hollywood sign. Jill and Gregg show the sparks of|pmance
audience interested, but they quickly fiz/fe out *& }6t go« 3
I can t recommcnd"Mighty Joe Youn^lpanywi* With a positive K&ii jusf&ems
Hke a mighty big waste of special eftei u When I iejft the theater 112 frit Ijyfcrt hadn't
watched something worth my $4.75, io 1 snuck into the theater ti«xt door to see a
much flick — "You'& Got Mail* jj|M
