## Schmuck & Putz Crappy New Year 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
I | ast week, dedicated and under-appreciated
| columnists Schmuck and Putz wrote their ver-
[ 1^m Jlsions of the holiday films only to be shamefully
flogged by their ruthless slavemaster Kong. In bruises
and bandages, the abused critics were put on probation.
"This week, no films for you!" shouted an angry Kong.
They weren't allowed to go to the movies; instead, Kong
forced them to watch previews of upcoming flicks. So,
here they are-our reviews of the previews of cinematic
endeavors coming soon to a theatre near you:
"Message in a Bottle"
The Plot: Robin Wright Penn finds a romantic letter
in a bottle. So, like we all would in that situation, she ded
icates every moment of her life to tracing the anonymous
author. It's a good thing that she's the editor of a news
paper where she doesn't have any work to do. And guess
what? The source of the letter turns out to be Kevin
Costner, who lives on a boat!
Our Expectation: At first, the couple has wild, pas
sionate sex. But then they get camera-shy, so they drink
coffee for the rest of the movie and talk about their kids.
It gets tedious towards the end, but boy are those sex
scenes delicious!
How We Think It Will End: Schmuck thinks that they
have sex again, while a pessimistic Putz insists that the
boat sinks and they drown. They have underwater fore
play in their final moments. Riveting and powerful.
Our Prognosis: We would love to meet the prick that
green-lighted this winner!
"Varsity Blues"
The Plot: The Dawson's Creek kid plays football and
can't decide if he wants to go to Brown or Princeton.
There is also a really fat guy who takes off his clothes in a
bar (may or may not be important).
Our Expectations: We can definitely see the dancing
obese man stealing the show here. He's "The Full Monty"
of this year. A definite contender for best supporting
actor, the obese man takes on a Falstaffian presence to
Dawson's Henry IV. It's a story (probably) about love,
friendship, and betrayal.
How We Think It Will End: Dawson gets rejected
from Brown and Princeton. He ends up going to East
Tech, while obese man cleans up his act, gets a white
sweater and goes off to Princeton.
Our Prognosis: Looks terrific — for us to poop on!

"The Theory of Flight"
The Plot: Kenneth Branagh plays a man who gets
arrested for attempted suicide in England and is forced to
do community service. His big project is to take care of
wheelchair-bound Helena Bonham Carter, who plays a
woman with Lou Gehrig's Disease. Her request from him
is to help her lose her virginity. So instead of just rolling
in the hay with her himself, he robs a bank to help pay for
a male prostitute. No joke.
Our Expectations: The sex scenes promise to be quite
interesting, if not kinky.
How We Think It Will End: Kenneth's character falls
for the gigolo. There's a group shower scene with the
three of them. Then they all share a dream about flying
together naked. Hence the title.
Our Prognosis: Fun for the whole family.
"Playing By Heart"
The Plot: We couldn't really tell from the preview
what this film is about, but we're taking a stab in the
dark. Sean Connery is going out with Gena Rowlands.
Angelina Jolie sweats Ryan Phillipe (who has blue hair —
could have some significance). Gillian Anderson, who
has a really big dog, likes Jon Stewart. And that's about it.
Oh, and they all take a lot of still shots.

Our Expectations: The big dog will become the key
symbol, the motif if you will, of love in this charming
love story. We will discover that Ryan has blue hair for a
reason (maybe he's from West Hollywood). Ryan will
discover his bestial passion for the big dog; Angelina wil
run off with Gillian; the unknown will find Sean, and
this domino effect will cause mass chaos (we think).
How We Think It Will End: How else? Mass orgy.
Our Prognosis: Cinematic Viagra.
"Virus"
The Plot: Big alien. Little boat. Lots of dead people.
Our Expectations: We know that this will be a daring
Hollywood film, challenging the clearly defined norms of
the science fiction genre. We know that this looks hella
(sorry, we couldn't resist) like that hit film from last year,
"Sphere," but we're sure that this is going to be different.
A graceful and profound film to which all other sci-fi
thrillers will be compared.
How We Think It Will End: For once, they all die!
Our Prognosis: You might catch something if you see it
