| here once were a man an
p multiply pierced, whose greatest joy vm to
chain their piercings to each other while
making love. While this mafwake you cringe* gen
tle reader, no doubt it also piques your* curiosity.
Why does the illogical concept of putting large
metal fixtures through one's m«tt areas
seem like a sexy idea to some?
Well, there are two main reason! to pierce. First
and most obviously, there is the visual — the idea
of piercing as jewelry. This applies to pierc
ings above the neck, such as ears, eyebroil and lip.
These piercings are lovely to look at, but asjM«4iW&
irritating parents, are not otherwise functional.
Then there is the second and less known
reason — the sensual side ol piercing. Piercing
makes a sensitive area more sensitive,
if you've ever stapled your tha|»b. SojSiZXUal thrift i(
seekers turn to the needle to up the ante in bed. |
Women who pierce their clitorises,import orgasms
from simply walking up stairs. M<h say their penile
rings give them an interesting pulling «mation
that makes sex explosive. Some people even regard
the act of piercing itself to be extremely SeSual, a
type of figurative intercourse wljere one to pene
trated by the needle.
But how does one assure oneidf a good expttp
ence like these, you might ask. I jj starts with a good
piercer. Flipping though the Yellow Pages un4crj
section "P" is not the right way to go about Ihil
most important of choices. You must use woftf' of
mouth and reliable tefereoces, nince this is minor
surgery you're about to pay for.
When you meet the piercer for the first time,
don't be frightened by th£ fact that his or her face
looks like a cushion. At least you know he's
practiced. After pleasant introductions, subject the
prospective piercer to your owq personal barrage
of questions. Keep in mind tray Four Piercing*
Commandments (see below), and don't be ajprdid
to back out if you're not sure of thequality of the
piercer. Not just anyone can put a hole in your
body. \
With that rigmarole over, you're ready to be
pierced. Expect to pay from $30 to $60, depending
on the difficulty ( of the piercing. Jewelry, »n the
form of a ring or barbell (rod with a ball on each
end), is usually an additional $20. And don't seek
out a bargain-basement piercer—this is not a
time to be stingy since you truly get what you pay
for. Keep in mind that jewelry is measured by l
gauge, with a 20-gauge being something like fish
ing line and a two-gauge being more like a javelin.
Naturally, having read this far, you're anxious to
procure a piercing for yourself. But what part to
pierce, you ponder. In the realm of erotic piercings,
one of the most benign is the tongue. Because it is
oral, it is sexual by association, while being main
stream enough for the bashful beginner. The feel
ing of a pierced tongue packs a wallop during kiss
ing or something stronger. (Note: Though
renowned for helping fellatio, a tongue stud really
shines in cunnilingus). Plus, since metal retains
temperature changes longer than tongue tissue,
there is much room for playing with ice cream and
hot tea.
If a person is a bit braver, he or she graduates to
the level of genital piercings. Most piercers keep
photo albums as sort of a catalog / greatest hits
type thing, and as you'll see, you can have pretty
much anything pierced you might want — you just

have to know what to ask for. For example, men, a
Prince Albert is a ring that enters through the ure
thra and exits out the side of the penis head. A lad
jlSkas its name suggests, is a row of barbells hori
7.onCallyjdown the underside of the penis. A hafada
is a typf|§>f scrotal piercing, and a Prince's Wand
(a.k.ju Urethral Tube) is a tapered, stainless steel
tube worttlwyde the urethra and kept in place with
a screw; 112f 1 * .
For women, fceVariety is similarly overwhelm
ing. The inner ami outer labia take rings well, as
does the ditoral hJgd. A Prince Albertina, like the
male fersion, pHmnmrouah the urethra and out
a centimeter And a Christina involves
putting the labia majora meets the
pubic moundJl good rule of thumb for both men
and women is that a part that gives you a lot of
pleasure will be the most fun to have pierced. Of
course, behind that lies the truth that they also hurt
the most during piejcing ai»d healing, so you make
kthe call. J|| jp

not capful.
So, gentle reader, off you go into the world of
piercings, a little better informed for the effort. At
best, yo» may discover a new and wonderful type of

expric piercers and join a new mailing list or two.
jjJfnen, you can receive cards like a friend of Miss
Sass': "Happy Hole-idays. Thanks for letting us
hurt youl"
The Four j|iercing Commandments
!• Piercing guns should only be used on ears.
They are unsanitary and inaccurate. You want a
hollow needle to do your piercing. (Sounds appeal
ing already, doesn't it?)
2* Disposable items such as rubber gloves and
Cotton swabs should be new for each person.
3* Reusable tools like tongs and clamps should
be sterilized in an autoclave. Ask to see their auto
clave. Better yet, ask to see their "spore test" results
a#d they'll think you're an extra-sharp cookie.
4* Both you and the piercer should be complete
ly sober. Goodness only knows what mishaps could
arise from a poorly timed twitch or hiccup.
