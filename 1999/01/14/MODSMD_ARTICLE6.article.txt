for making them learn thoroughly and accurately.... He
made opportunities for people in surgery."

kind to me as someone who was developing."

racic surgery, recalled one of C 'ohn's favorite lines: "the
last good dean was Gunga Din at least he brought
water to the troops," an allusion to a Rudyard Kipling
poem.

was apparently during his heyday a tiger." He recalled
Cohn's claim that "Medical Dean ( handler paid [('ohn|
$150 a month to keep his name out of the newspaper."

lor's degree from Stanford in 1929 and graduated from
