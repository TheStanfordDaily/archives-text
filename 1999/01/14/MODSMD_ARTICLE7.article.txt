Prof. Gerald Ciunthcr has spent
more than 20 years honing his schol
arly vision on the life ol his one nine
mentor. Judge Learned Hand.
(iunther. the William Nelson
Cromwell Emeritus Professor of
Law. won the 12th Triennial Book
Award of the Order of the Coif
the nation's highest aeeolade for
legal scholarship on Jan. K for his
biography "Learned Hand: Ihe
Man and the Judge."

(iunther's 1994 book was recog
nized by a distinguished panel of
judges and educators as "a written
work evidencing creative legal tal
i ni of the highest order " He was
I" sented with a large certificate
<md .i "significant" check
11 s an absolutely terrific book,
and it's wonderful that it got recog
nized in this way." Law School
Dean Paul Brest said. "It's as sim
ple ;is that
i iunther spent more than 20
\ears researching and writing his
book .ibout Hand. Hand was a fed

eral judge for 52 years, from 1909 to
1%1. becoming chief judge of the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
According to (iunther. Hand was
"an icon of the American judiciary
foi the first half of the century."
Though Hand never sat on the
Supreme Court, his opinions were
given tremendous weight.
"It's an understatement and a
cliche to say that Hand is the most
eminent judge in American history
not to sit on the Supreme Court."
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg said.

(■citing into the subject's mind
Gunther served as a law clerk for
Hand from 1953 to 1954. after grad
uating from law school. "I knew him
as a human being." (iunther said. "I
knew he was filled with self-doubt,
someone who you might call today a
kind of a depressive, agonizing per
sonality. He really wrestled with the
issues that came before him."
Gunther was asked to write the
biography by Hand's literary execu
tor and son-in law. and was given ac
cess to more than 100,000 private pa
pers, dating back to when Hand was
six years old.
"My favorite documents were re
! ■ peating his agony and doubts," Gun
ther said.
"He suffered without justifica
tion from low self-esteem, which in
•t my view made him who he was. He
really was open-minded, he listened
to both sides, he didn't come in with
a whole ideological personal agen
. da."
Gunther said his favorite demon
, stration of this open-mindedness
came in a 1944 speech, which Hand
i gave on Citizenship Day in New
. York's Central Park.
"What then is the spirit of liber
ty?" asked Hand. "The spirit of lib
erty is the spirit which is not too sure
that it is right."
According to Gunther, "This re
ally characterized the man because
, he would question himself and want

to be questioned about his tentative
conclusions."
Gunther said he enjoyed the
process of writing a biography "You
try to get into your subject's mind,
and in the course of that you start
asking how you would react. I was
sometimes tempted to reach over
my desk and take [Hand] by the
shoulders and say, 'Come on, stop
worrying so much! You're better
than you think. Everybody realizes
you're better. Your work shows
you're better.' He was sort of a Ham
let figure."
The intensity of the writing expe
rience, Gunther said, made for con
stant preoccupation.
"It became part of [my] marriage
for 20-some years. It's almost like
menage-a-trois
Critical acclaim
Gunther's close attention to his
work has earned him the admiration
of colleagues as well as national ac
claim.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, co

author with Gunther of a new edi
tion of the textbook "Constitutional
Law," called Gunther's honor "a
wonderful award for a giant of the
field who not only has written the
leading casebook, but a biography
that sets the standard for all judicial
biographies to come."
Weisberg describes the biogra
phy as "an incredibly fluently writ
ten narrative. [Gunther] wanted this
to be a work of literature as well, and
I think one of the things that has won
the book fame is its literary and nar
rative elegance that only enhance
the scholarly depth."
Gunther said his book has sold
well, and that he is pleased with its
reception.
"The great reward is that reviews
have been plentiful and very enthu
siastic. This is the only book I've
written where 1 could look at myself
and tell my wife: This is exactly the
kind of book I wanted to write, a
book which tries to relate the judge's
work to the political and historical
context, and particularly to the
judge's makeup.' That really is the

thing I take most pride in."
Gunther himself is widely praised
as well.
His other national honors include
the Learned Hand Medal for Excel
lence in Federal Jurisprudence and
the Richard J. Maloney Prize for
Distinguished Contributions to
Legal Education.
According to Weisberg, "[Gun
ther] is generally regarded as the
foremost constitutional scholar of
the postwar era in the United States.
He's the editor of the most eminent
casebook and is generally regarded
as probably our leading Constitu
tional thinker."
Gunther teaches a course in in
troductory constitutional law and a
seminar on constitutional problems.
He is currently writing a book review
and a tribute to the late Supreme
Court Justice Lewis Powell.
"I expect that I will never be
bored, as long as I retain the ability
to read and listen," Gunther said.

cliche to say that Hand is the most
eminent judge in American history
not to sit on the Supreme Court."
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg said.

(■citing into the subject's mind
Gunther served as a law clerk for
Hand from 1953 to 1954. after grad
uating from law school. "I knew him
as a human being." (iunther said. "I
knew he was filled with self-doubt,
someone who you might call today a
kind of a depressive, agonizing per
sonality. He really wrestled with the
issues that came before him."
Gunther was asked to write the
biography by Hand's literary execu
tor and son-in law. and was given ac
cess to more than 100,000 private pa
pers, dating back to when Hand was
six years old.
"My favorite documents were re
! ■ peating his agony and doubts," Gun
ther said.
"He suffered without justifica
tion from low self-esteem, which in
•t my view made him who he was. He
really was open-minded, he listened
to both sides, he didn't come in with
a whole ideological personal agen
. da."
Gunther said his favorite demon
, stration of this open-mindedness
came in a 1944 speech, which Hand
i gave on Citizenship Day in New
. York's Central Park.
"What then is the spirit of liber
ty?" asked Hand. "The spirit of lib
erty is the spirit which is not too sure
that it is right."
According to Gunther, "This re
ally characterized the man because
, he would question himself and want

to be questioned about his tentative
conclusions."
Gunther said he enjoyed the
process of writing a biography "You
try to get into your subject's mind,
and in the course of that you start
asking how you would react. I was
sometimes tempted to reach over
my desk and take [Hand] by the
shoulders and say, 'Come on, stop
worrying so much! You're better
than you think. Everybody realizes
you're better. Your work shows
you're better.' He was sort of a Ham
let figure."
The intensity of the writing expe
rience, Gunther said, made for con
stant preoccupation.
"It became part of [my] marriage
for 20-some years. It's almost like
menage-a-trois
Critical acclaim
Gunther's close attention to his
work has earned him the admiration
of colleagues as well as national ac
claim.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, co

author with Gunther of a new edi
tion of the textbook "Constitutional
Law," called Gunther's honor "a
wonderful award for a giant of the
field who not only has written the
leading casebook, but a biography
that sets the standard for all judicial
biographies to come."
Weisberg describes the biogra
phy as "an incredibly fluently writ
ten narrative. [Gunther] wanted this
to be a work of literature as well, and
I think one of the things that has won
the book fame is its literary and nar
rative elegance that only enhance
the scholarly depth."
Gunther said his book has sold
well, and that he is pleased with its
reception.
"The great reward is that reviews
have been plentiful and very enthu
siastic. This is the only book I've
written where 1 could look at myself
and tell my wife: This is exactly the
kind of book I wanted to write, a
book which tries to relate the judge's
work to the political and historical
context, and particularly to the
judge's makeup.' That really is the

thing I take most pride in."
Gunther himself is widely praised
as well.
His other national honors include
the Learned Hand Medal for Excel
lence in Federal Jurisprudence and
the Richard J. Maloney Prize for
Distinguished Contributions to
Legal Education.
According to Weisberg, "[Gun
ther] is generally regarded as the
foremost constitutional scholar of
the postwar era in the United States.
He's the editor of the most eminent
casebook and is generally regarded
as probably our leading Constitu
tional thinker."
Gunther teaches a course in in
troductory constitutional law and a
seminar on constitutional problems.
He is currently writing a book review
and a tribute to the late Supreme
Court Justice Lewis Powell.
"I expect that I will never be
bored, as long as I retain the ability
to read and listen," Gunther said.
"Learned Hand: The Man and
the Judge" is available at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
