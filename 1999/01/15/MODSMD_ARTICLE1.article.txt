### Kelly Young Senior staff writer 
Lap-Ping Wong, facilities supervisor for Lagunita
Court and Roble Hall, was assaulted yesterday morning
behind Roble Hall.
At 10:24 a.m.. Wong observed a man putting a bicycle
in the back of a van. Wong questioned him. wrote down the
license plate number in his day planner and attempted to
call the police on his cellular phone. The suspect then ap
proached Wong and punched him in the jaw.
He then apparently stole Wong's phone and day plan
ner. along with the bicycle.
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy described the suspect as
a heavyset Hispanic male in his 2()s between 5 feet 10 inch
es and 6 feet tall. He was wearing a green plaid shirt, dark
pants and a dark baseball cap with a red logo.
The suspect's van was described as a clean, late-model
Ford Windstar painted metallic green.
Stanford Police have not located the vehicle or the sus
pect, who was last seen driving west on Santa Teresa
Street. Wong recollected only a portion of the vehicle's li
cense plate, which the police are using to locate the vehicle.
"He had some reason he was concerned about having
his license plate written down," Bandy said. "That means
it's probably traceable back to him pretty easily."
If apprehended, the suspect could face charges of first
degree strong-arm robbery, a felony.
Wong was treated for facial injuries at Stanford Hospi
tal although his jaw was not broken.
"We're asking students to be careful and immediately
report any suspicious activity to the police." said Lisa
Webb, residence dean for Lagunita and Roble.

Contact Det. Allen James at 723-9633 if your bicycle was
