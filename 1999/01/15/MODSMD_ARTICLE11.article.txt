## Making pilgrimages to anywhere 
### 
I UP UP UP every
one, it's time for
the kebab van.
Too far to walk? If I can
make it in these shoes,
you can make it in yours.
Ahmed serves cat instead
I of chicken? Stick to the

chips and vinegar, they're better anyway.
Why do we have to go now? Just get up.
I'll explain later.
Last night was less than heroic; six tipsy
Stanford students weaving through
Oxford in search of food is a story for a
very slow day. The art of getting up and
leaving — the more obscure the justifica
tion, the better — is to be cultivated at all
times. Ahmed's was a step in the right
direction, and he does make damn good
chips.
Like I said, leaving. Finals were tolera
ble for me in December because I
dropped everything and took off: I found
a cheaper-than-dirt airfare to Boston on
Monday of Dead Week, and by Thursday
I was on a rooftop in Cambridge watching
the city glitter. My research papers suf
fered for the trip, of course (most of them
were dashed off on planes and subway
trains rather than in my palace in Arroyo);

given that I had exactly one chance to visit
my Harvard friends before they went
home for Christmas and I flew to Great
Britain for who knows how long, I'm glad
I prioritized as I did.
Friends come before a lot of things, and
I like it that way; skipping across the
Charles, I would add. is much more
cathartic than screaming from the dorm at
midnight. Just get up. I'll keep explaining.
Leaving is addictive, of course. When I
came home to my parents for Christmas
break, the planes-and-subway-trains bug
had a firm hold on me, and the local coffee
house wasn't good enough tor Friday
night any more. Mexico sounded much
better, and a friend and 1 headed for the
border with fistfuls of small change and
the resolution that we would find some
thing to do when we got there. It worked
wonderfully; I'm still confused about the
motorcycle dentist and the donkey-zebras
we passed on every corner, but that day
was the best of my vacation. Transit means
more to me than destinations, 1 think;
after Mexico, I spent most of December
just driving. It felt good.
It's depressing, maybe, that I took such
pleasure in frightening Harvard students
by telling them that I was completely

[ ignoring my Stanford finals. As 1 said,
t however, the papers got finished; leaving
t wasn't a conscious or unconscious effort to
1 give academics the finger. It is more accu
rate to say that frolicking in Cambridge
1 was a needed reminder that I'm capable of
: more than sweating in front of a computer
: in Palo Alto. Greeting-card sentiments are
t the easiest to forget, of course.
I'm no Jack Kerouac, though my
I insides will look like his if I don't leave
> Ahmed's damn chips alone; I know I'm a
> privileged little white girl with happy feet
: rather than a dharma bum. Capital "L"
Leaving, trite or no, is no less important
i for that; life in front of a computer screen,
a television, coffee cup No. 435 is still mis
erable. The subway, the car, the plane,
now. Even the sidewalk between Stanford
House and the kebab van — they're all
better dates than Mac Samson; up up up.
And hey, drop by if you frolic in
/ Oxford someday. I'll be the one dragging
* the drunks down to Ahmed's.
