Ethical questions surround
'morning-after pills 9
The Jan. 13 Daily article on emergency
contraception was a good article with help
ful information for the student body. Stu
dents should know that the 'morning after
pill' is readily available from any clinician at
Cowell. My only area of disagreement
regards the use of the word "contraception"
and the discussion of the "emergency con
traceptive" pill's mode of action.
While it is true that the American Col
lege of Ob-Gyn defined pregnancy as
beginning with implantation, there are a
number of thinking individuals, physicians
and lay people alike, who disagree with that
definition. I discussed this in my article on
ethical issues of this practice (Journal of
American College Health. 9/%), quoting
from a New England Journal of Medicine
letter:
" 'Popular wisdom understands concep
tion as fertilization ... a contraceptive pre
vents fertilization ... since contraception is
now widely accepted in our society, demon

strating (the morning-after pill] to be a con
traceptive would eliminate the chief moral
obstacle to its approval and use.
" Many people believe that a fertilized
ovum constitutes a new human life and that
preventing its implantation constitutes
abortion ... redefining the meaning of con
traception to include the prevention of
implantation does not change the fact that
preventing the implantation is what many
people find problematic with [the morning
after pill]'"
The Catholic church holds this position
strongly; of course, artificial contraception
is also proscribed by this body.
I acknowledge, as your article indicates,
that if given prior to ovulation, the pills may
actually prevent ovulation and conception.
Thereby, only in that instance does it act as
a true "contraceptive."
The ultimate conclusion of my journal
article was that the morning-after treatment
is a gray area ethically.
It is absolutely necessary for any woman
contemplating this treatment to have a full
understanding of how the medication is pre
sumed to work, so that she can make her

own ethical decision consistent with her
own values.

We must concede that race is
important
The formation of racial constructions
within the United States has set up clear
divisions between its citizens. Within these
constructs there has been a pattern of
oppression and racist behavior throughout
the history of the United States that contin
ues to reveal itself today.
Mr. Geyser believes that cultural events,
such as Kwanzaa. work to the "detriment"
of society, because they are "separatist and
divisive."
Mr. Geyser is trapped in the same West
ernized mindset that defines an American
culture that continues to reinvigorate
notions of white superiority and black infe
riority. As a result. Geyser writes from a

short-sighted perspective, that prevents him
from seeing the true value and importance
of race in America.
Mr. Geyser states in his Jan. 12 column
that, "in today's imperfect environment,
ripe with remnants of a racist past, groups
must realize the risk of separation."
However, what Mr. Geyser fails to real
ize is that so long as three white men in
Jasper, Texas drag along the corpse of an
innocent "fellow United States Citizen"
; (who just happens to be black), racism is
alive and prevalent. In the context of this
society we must be "sensitive" about race
and cannot afford to "laugh" at racial
t slights. Who we are today is a direct result
of the historical situation from which we
arise. Within the American experience, this
situation was shaped and defined heavily by
race.
I However "empty" the word "nigger"
may be to Mr. Geyser, for African Ameri
cans it is filled with harsh and brutal
i reminders of the worst holocaust known to
: man, the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
Further, Mr. Geyser's usage of the word
i "nigger" was clearly done for an effect and

an attempt to cause controversy rather than
to truly "strengthen societal unity."
Mr. Geyser proposes that events such as
Kwan/aa "begin as a call for unity, [hut] end
hv further separating people who are differ
ent."
He goes on to argue that "what does pro
duce tolerance is interaction." Despite
these words, however, Mr. Geyser did not
attend the BSlJ's Kwanzaa celebration
(which was open to the entire Stanford
community), and he did not attempt to find
out more about the holiday when members
of the BSU distributed information in
White Plaza last week.
Mr. Geyser poses the question, "How
can the gap [between the races] be bridged
if we don't address the problem as one soci
ety?" His argument that cultural celebra
tions work to separate our society, is a weak
attempt to address the real issues that
divide our nation.
In order to bridge our current divide, we
must ask questions that will allow us to get
at the true root of our divide.
