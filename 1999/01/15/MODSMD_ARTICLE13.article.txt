## Matthew Blumenstein Good news, bad news for Stanford hoops 
### 
WE BEAT THE Weenies and
UCLA is scared. The Pac-1() is
ripe for the taking. The most
talked-about year in the history of Stanford
men's basketball is underway. Coaches,
players and fans alike have a responsibility
this year to take our team as far as possible.
Here's my look at our performance thus far.
Coaching
Good News: Mike Montgomery, the
man responsible for curtailing Stanford's
collection of NIT Hags, remains on the
Farm. Since arriving from Montana, he has
improved our team's performance in a
steady upward slope and has continually
represented himself and his program with
the utmost class and quiet charisma. In
interviews, he is humble, forthright and
intelligent.
Montgomery has successfully recruited
players who in years past would have gone
to a UCLA, Duke or Arizona. He brought
in Brevin Knight, an unknown kid sought
only by Manhattan College. He orchestrat
ed one of the most baffling comebacks in
NCAA history when Stanford came from
behind to beat Rhode Island and advance to
the Final Four.
Plus, his son shoots a mean ball at half

time.
Bad News: We might lose him. If Stanford
continues to show well in the tournament.
Montgomery's name is going to find its way
on to a list of prospective NBA coaches.
Some more success could win him an impres
sive paycheck and a chance to coach pro tal
ent. Great for him, terrible for us.
Hype
Good News: It's fun to talk trash about
your hoops program. We went to the Final
Four last year and that's forever. Art Lee
made the cover of Sports Illustrated and
they picked us to win the whole thing. Dick
Vitale loves this Stanford team and can't
stop talking about its scholar-athletes.
Sportscasters are billing Maples as a terrify
ing venue in which to play. All of the hype
being bandied about reflects well on our
program, our school spirit and our school as
a whole.
Bad News: Don't believe them ... yet.
People have found it easy to forget our for
tuitous draw in the tournament last year —
Charleston, Purdue, Rhode Island, and then
the loss to Kentucky. Nothing can diminish
the team's accomplishment, but it's not
going to be that easy again.
The national press has a tendency to

overrate Stanford teams during pre-season.
This may not be such a case, but there are a
great many potholes on the road to every
one's expectations. We've already fallen to
UNC and Maryland this year and we must
expect to meet teams of at least that caliber
come March.
The Sixlh Man Club
Good News: Our student seats are
packed for every home game. The fans
never sit down and everybody wears the
same shirt. This demonstrates to the coun
try that we have intense, devoted fans.
When the club jumps up and down on the
bleachers, they make the floor shake — an
earthquake that makes it hard to shoot.
Bad News: This club has taken over all
the student season tickets. Only Sixth Man
members are allowed to sit in the student
section. But Sixth Man members have to
pay extra money and are sponsored by cor
porations.
Our fans do not come across as wild,
loyal and loud. They seem eager to be so,
but they still look like Stanford kids. This
year's method for distributing tickets did
not reward die-hard fans but instead
favored freshman dorms and other hyper
organized bodies. The crowd often employs

embarrassing chants that are in bad taste.
"Who's your daddy" has become a staple.
Size
Good News: We've got one of the
biggest teams in the country and a deep
bench. Young, Collins, Madsen and Seaton
play strong inside defense without much
fear of fouling out.
On offense, Madsen can hustle the occa
sional inside lay-up and Seaton is good for
crazy jams. Jarron Collins has played some
huge minutes and he draws a lot of fouls.
Young is ice from the free throw line and
sometimes drops the baby hook. The big
men move the ball well in traffic, too, which
creates open jump shots and the occasional
easy lay-up.
Bad News: We don't play as big as our
size allows. We go up weak and come down
hard. Players such as Brendon Haywood
from UNC and Obinna Ekezie from Mary
land swatted inside efforts with ease and
disdain. Tim Young continues his three
year aversion to dunking. Jason Collins is
injured for another year and can only watch
and wait.
Arthur Lee
Good News: Arthur Lee is a celebrity.

His play in the Rhode Island comeback
rivaled some of Jordan's greatest moments
and made him famous. He jumped from
Brevin's shadow last year and won the
respect of the campus and the nation as an
outstanding point guard. He runs the floor
with authority but with four other solid
players on the floor alongside him, is not as
crucial to the team's success as Brevin was
at point. Lee drops jaws with his acrobatic
finishes. He shoots his best under intense
pressure and that's fun to watch.
Bad News: Lee has off days. Stanford
lives and dies by the outside jump shot and
when Lee's is off, we're in trouble. Mendez
is hurt. Weems shoots well but usually
needs to spot up. Mosely will fire at will, but
Lee holds everything together. If his game is
off or his shot is struggling, it affects every
one.
Great coaching, big players and a lot of
hype are certainties for the Cardinal this
season. In order to cash in on these assets,
the team needs to play big and shoot well. In
order to help, we fans need to go absolutely
crazy.

favored freshman dorms and other hyper
organized bodies. The crowd often employs

embarrassing chants that are in bad taste.
"Who's your daddy" has become a staple.
Size
Good News: We've got one of the
biggest teams in the country and a deep
bench. Young, Collins, Madsen and Seaton
play strong inside defense without much
fear of fouling out.
On offense, Madsen can hustle the occa
sional inside lay-up and Seaton is good for
crazy jams. Jarron Collins has played some
huge minutes and he draws a lot of fouls.
Young is ice from the free throw line and
sometimes drops the baby hook. The big
men move the ball well in traffic, too, which
creates open jump shots and the occasional
easy lay-up.
Bad News: We don't play as big as our
size allows. We go up weak and come down
hard. Players such as Brendon Haywood
from UNC and Obinna Ekezie from Mary
land swatted inside efforts with ease and
disdain. Tim Young continues his three
year aversion to dunking. Jason Collins is
injured for another year and can only watch
and wait.
Arthur Lee
Good News: Arthur Lee is a celebrity.

His play in the Rhode Island comeback
rivaled some of Jordan's greatest moments
and made him famous. He jumped from
Brevin's shadow last year and won the
respect of the campus and the nation as an
outstanding point guard. He runs the floor
with authority but with four other solid
players on the floor alongside him, is not as
crucial to the team's success as Brevin was
at point. Lee drops jaws with his acrobatic
finishes. He shoots his best under intense
pressure and that's fun to watch.
Bad News: Lee has off days. Stanford
lives and dies by the outside jump shot and
when Lee's is off, we're in trouble. Mendez
is hurt. Weems shoots well but usually
needs to spot up. Mosely will fire at will, but
Lee holds everything together. If his game is
off or his shot is struggling, it affects every
one.
Great coaching, big players and a lot of
hype are certainties for the Cardinal this
season. In order to cash in on these assets,
the team needs to play big and shoot well. In
order to help, we fans need to go absolutely
crazy.
