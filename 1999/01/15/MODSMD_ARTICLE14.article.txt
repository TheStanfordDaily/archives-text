LOS ANGELES — Heading into last night's game against No. 4 Stanford,
USC knew it would need a flawless performance in order to get a win.
The Trojans didn't get it.and Stanford (14-2. 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
stormed to a 72-55 victory in front of 5,627 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial
Sports Arena.
The scouting report on USC (10-4, 2-3) before the game was as follows:
don't allow their pure shooters, Adam Spanich and Elias Ayuso. to get open
for three-pointers, and contain newcomer Brian Scalabrine, a sophomore
transfer center who led the team in scoring, rebounding and assists.
The Cardinal did all of that and more in a dominating defensive perfor
mance. The Stanford defense held Spanich and Ayuso to a combined five
three-pointers, several of which came well after the game was effectively over.
Scalabrine was overpowered by Cardinal forward Mark Madsen, got into
foul trouble early and was disqualified from the game with five personals early
in the second half after managing only eight points and two rebounds.
Madsen finished with 17 points to lead all scorers and grabbed 10 rebounds,
while frontcourt partner Jarron Collins had the most productive night of his
young career, scoring 13 points and yanking down 12 rebounds, both career
highs for the sophomore forward.

"Any win on the road is a good win," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We weren't great offensively, but I thought our post guys came up
huge, especially Jarron in the first half."

■ Yesterday: No. 4 Stanford (14-2,4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) 72, USC (10-4-,
2-3) 55.

The two double-doubles in the Stanford frontcourt were just part of a very; .
balanced offensive effort. Senior point guard Arthur Lee was
solid, finishing with 14 points, while Tim Young scored nine points and
Moseley eight.
"We don't have one guy who has to score big numbers for us to have a; !;
chance," Montgomery added.
The Trojans actually came out firing in the first half and jumped out to
8-2 lead, but Stanford responded with the kind of patience and composure
has become a trademark of this year's team. Collins came off the bench
Madsen and tallied three quick buckets, showcasing his ability in the post
perimeter by mixing in a 12-foot jumper with a pretty baseline drop step.
Collins was the catalyst in that early Stanford run, which was capped by*S
