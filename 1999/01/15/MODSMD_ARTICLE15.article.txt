# Showdown with No. 10 UCLA on horizon for Cardinal;;
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — Two years ago it
was the Massacre at Maples. Last
year it was the Stanford sweep. And
although it is an almost entirely new
UCLA team, there is little doubt that
the Bruins will be looking for a little
revenge and a boost in the polls when
they face No. 4 Stanford tomorrow.
After defeating USC last night,
Stanford (14-2 overall, 4-0 Pacific 10
Conference) will travel to Westwood
to play No. 10 UCLA (12-3, 4-1) to
finish round one of Northern Califor
nia vs. Southern California.
"Because it is UCLA, it's always a
big game," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery, whose Cardinal
club includes six Southern California

natives. "The kids look forward to it."
Only two players return for the
Bruins from that team that was
slaughtered by the Cardinal in 1997,
109-61, and both will be riding the
bench tomorrow.
Starting three freshmen and two
sophomores, the Bruins sport the
best recruiting class in the nation to
go along with one of the best back
courts in the conference. While to
morrow's game will match Stanford's
Arthur Lee, a senior point guard with
Final Four experience, with a Bruin
sophomore, this will certainly be one
of the greatest matchups the Pac-10
has to offer this year.
UCLA's Baron Davis, a John
Wooden and Naismith Player of the
Year candidate, leads the way for the
Bruins, despite being sidelined dur

ing the first four games due to injury.
Davis is averaging 11.8 points and 4.7
assists per game.
Davis "is a good player," Lee said.
"UCLA is a quality team but I think
if we do the things we need to do, we
can get the job done."
