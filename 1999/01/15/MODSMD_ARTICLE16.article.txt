## Gymnasts face No. 4 Utes 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
Ask any coach in any sport, and
he will tell you that there is always
one match that defined the season.
For the No. 10 Stanford women's
gymnastics team, that match could
very well be tonight's meet against
No. 4 Utah.
After coming off the most suc
cessful season in school history,
Stanford has both the talent and the
confidence to establish itself as a
major player on the national gym
nastics scene. A win against such a
powerhouse as Utah would do much
to legitimize the Cardinal as a seri
ous championship contender both
to the country and to itself.
"This year we have a whole new
outlook, we all realize that we can
[win nationals]," said sophomore
all-arounder Jen Exaltation.
Because of last season's success
es, the Cardinal will no longer play
the role of underdog and instead will
look to prove itself as women's gym
nastics' "new kid on the block."
Utah on the other hand has been

a dominant force in women's colle
giate gymnastics for the last quarter
century.
The match is the season opener
for the Utes, who will put the na
tion's longest home winning streak
(145) on the line against the upstart
Cardinal, who will he looking to con
tinue a streak of their own.
Two straight victories against
Utah.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

â–  Today: No. 10 Stanford at No. 4
Utah.

Last year's 195.550-194.275 victo
ry over the Utes was one of the
biggest wins in Stanford women's
gymnastics history.
But the comparisons between the
Utes and the Cardinal stop there.
Despite last year's successes, the
Cardinal has never consistently
been a major factor in collegiate
women's gymnastics. By contrast,
Utah has maintained one of the
sport's most competitive programs.
"We're building our name, they

already have a name, so it will be a
good way to gauge ourselves," said
senior co-captain Amy Murakami.
To get an idea of just how differ
ent the two programs* histories are,
one need look no further than the
two head coaches.
Stanford head coach Mark Cook
enters tonight's meet with a career 9-
4 record at the beginning of his sec
ond year on the Farm. Utah head
coach Greg Marsden is widely re
garded as the most successful coach
in college gymnastics history, having
won 10 national championships, in
cluding four in the '90s, going into
his 24th year at the helm. Marsden
enters the competition with a stag
gering 672-96-3 career record.
But records and statistics aside,
the Cardinal is a talented team on
the rise.
Senior Amy Murakami and Ju
nior Larissa Fontaine highlight a
deep Cardinal squad, and with the
impressive performance turned in
by freshman Katy Herbert at last
week's competition against UC-
Davis, Utah should have its hands
full.
