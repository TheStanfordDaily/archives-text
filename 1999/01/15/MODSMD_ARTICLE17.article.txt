# Volleyball plays two with LMU
## 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
11 last season's match against the Loyola Marymount
Lions can offer any prediction, it's going to be a very long
weekend for the Stanford men's volleyball team.
Last year, both the Lions and the Cardinal recorded
the longest matches of their seasons when Loyola defeat
ed Stanford in a thrilling five-game match which lasted
just under three hours.
The Cardinal kicks off regular-season play this week
end with 7 p.m. games tonight and tomorrow night at
Burnham Pavilion against the Lions.
"I think it will be a good first test." All-American out
side hitter Andy Witt said, 'it's a good measure of where
we are at."
Both Stanford and Loyola concluded their exhibition
season last week. The Cardinal's exhibition season in
eluded a trip to Canada in early October to compete
against four Canadian collegiate teams, as well as two
games against the University of the Pacific, and games
against the Stanford Alumni team and Sacramento State.
Stanford finished this exhibition season 3-5.

"Our preseason started out a little slow in Canada,"
freshman outside hitter Marcus Skacel said. "We were
also slow in our first game against Sacramento State, but
we smoked them after that."
During the exhibition season, the Lions and Cardinal
faced a common opponent, the University of Alberta.
Both schools suffered five-game losses against the Cana
dian team, which indicates the Cardinal faces a similarly
skilled opponent.
Although Loyola competes with Stanford in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, this weekend's
games do not affect either team's conference standing.
The matches serve as a final refinement before Stanford
enters MPSF competition against the Brigham Young
Cougars on Jan. 23.
"I felt like we needed additional practice before
BYl),"said head coach Ruben Nieves.
A third match against the Lions on Feb. 1S at LMU will
count toward conference standings and the chance to at
tain an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.
"Although it's rare to play any team three times in one
season, because LMU was making the trip up, we decid
ed to play them twice this weekend," said Nieves.
In 24 of the past 25 years. Stanford's final preparation
before conference play entailed participating in a highly
competitive tournament at UC-Santa Barbara, in which
teams play eight matches over a span of two days. Be
cause these matches are best two out of three games, the
games are unofficial and cannot affect a team's record.
Nieves believes that this weekend's games against
Loyola offer the better alternative for Stanford to maxi
mize its conference preparation without risking injury.
"The tournament games can be physically brutal on

athletes," said Nieves. "It's hard to stay healthy. The team*";
can't afford to be banged up at the start of the season." !v
A concern for the Cardinal is the health of three playX"
ers: Skacel, Curtis Graham and Chris Griffith.
Perhaps the most critical health question for the Ca£-*'
dinal is Skacel. an outside hitter. Although only a freslX-*'
men. he started at his position in Stanford's final exhibN*!
tion game against Sacramento State last week. Since re-lv
turning to training on Jan. 3, he has not missed any activK-l
tv despite playing with a stress fracture.
"Marcus' condition is a definite concern," said Nieves**
"We need to keep a close eye on him."
Although Skacel is one two of two freshmen who have;!
started for the Cardinal this season, the Lions are a more*l
experienced team which returns all six of its starters froifr*
last season, including All-MPSF Honorable MentioO-I
player Reid Priddy.
