# Students launch online calendar
## 
### Lilly Irani 
John Fan and Pablo Molinero-
Fernandez, two doctoral candidates
in electrical engineering, have creat
ed Campus Calendar. They hope
that the calendar, available on the
World Wide Web at http://canipus
calendar.stanford.edu/, will be an im
portant, unique resource to keep
Stanford students and faculty up to
date on events.
The calendar allows campus orga
nizations to maintain a publicly view
able online database of their events
free of charge. Events specified as
general interest appear on the main
campus calendar, and visitors can
find individual group calendars for
more specific interest events. Any
one with an SUID can also post
events to the main calendar.
The calendar can also be sent to a
user's inbox via a customized e-mail
reminder service that sends a list of
upcoming events for organizations
specified by the user. The service's
S(X) users receive information daily,
semi-weekly or weekly.
Currently, the calendar houses in
formation for about 40 organiza
tions, including the Bechtel Interna
tional Center, the Computer Science
Department, the Women's Center
and the Drama Department. Special
calendars also cover career develop
ment and graduate student events.
Fan and Molinero developed
Campus Calendar over the course of
a year as a self-described side project.
Looking to set up Web-based calen
dars for organizations in which they
were involved, the pair failed to find
appropriate software. Recognizing a
need, they wrote Calendus, the soft
ware that drives the Web site.
"We tested with a small number
of organizations first and then gradu
ally made revisions as people sug
gested them." Fan said.

Although interactive Web-based
calendars were rare a year ago at the
project's inception, sites such as
Yahoo! and when.com have set up
online calendars since then.
The ASSU entered the market
place this fall with its own campus
calendar system Start@Stanford.
Start@Stanford has since been aban
doned. and plans are underway for
Start 2, which will hopefully go up this
quarter, according to its administra
tor, junior David Weekly.
However, Fan and Molinero con
tend that the Campus Calendar and
Start@Stanford are complementary,
not competitive. According to Fan,
Campus Calendar has developed in
dependently of other projects and
has distinguishing features, such as
the e-mail update service and the
focus on allowing organizations to
maintain their own calendars.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe, who helped introduce
Campus Calendar to Stanford stu
dent groups, added that "the struc
ture of this site is to provide informa
tion related to groups, as opposed to
just all campus events. Groups can
save a lot of time and energy by using
[Campus Calendar]."
Although the calendar is a project
of the Office of Student Activities,
Fan and Molinero are volunteers.
Although not highly publicized,
the service has been well received by
students who have used it.
"1 actually was looking for a place
where I could find out about campus
events like lectures and perfor
mances." said freshman Stacy
Chang. "It's really useful."
In the future, Molinero and Fan
plan to improve Campus Calendar
by making certain campus events
only available to Stanford students.
Both this and requiring SUNet logins
to post are intended to prevent mis
use of the site.
