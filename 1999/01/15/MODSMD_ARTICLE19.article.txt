### Meredith Rowe Contributing writer 
A small group of students and Hillel staffers
discussed design ideas for the next location of
Hillel, a Jewish student organization, at a meet
ing last night. The meeting was open to all inter
ested students, but only lour students showed
up.
Currently housed on the ground floor of the
Old Union Clubhouse, the organization is out
growing its available space, Robert Rosenweig,
president of the board of directors of Hillel, said
in an interview last spring.
"The space in Old Union is very cramped and
really quite inadequate for the size of our oper
ation," he said.

The main purpose of last night's meeting was
to discover what students wanted in the future
building, said Hillel staff member Adam Weis
berg.
He said the discussion was based on the hope
that the group will move into a new space.
"If we do, we need to make sure it will fit the
students' needs. It must be a space people feel
good about going to," Weisberg said.
Hayley DeLugach. Hillel program and out
reach director, said that plans are still "very
much in the architectural stage".
However, there has been some speculation
that Hillel may move to the Dunn-Bacon house
located between 557 Mayfield and Campus
Drive. The house was sold to the University by
its longtime owners last year.

In an e-mail last spring. Rabbi Yoel Kahn.'lhe
executive director of Hillel, stated that the orga
nization "expects to acquire" the house. -*•
"According to our current plan, renovajjon
will begin this coming fall [ 1998] with occupapcv
of the renovated building [beginning] in-fall
1999," he added.

Other topics brought up at the meetingeen
tered on making Hillel a welcoming atmosphere
that would entice members to spend more time
at the location with their peers.
"When we get a building, if we get a buildijig.
Hillel is going to be so large and strong, people
will want to be there," said junior Hilary ftien
