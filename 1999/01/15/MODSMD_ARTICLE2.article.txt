## 84% oppose his removal from office

As the future of Bill Clinton's presi
dency is being debated in the chambers of
the U.S. Senate, most Stanford students
feel that the president should not be re
moved from office, according to a poll
conducted earlier this week by The Stan
ford Daily.
Students opposed to removing the
president from office outnumbered stu
dents supporting his removal by nearly a
seven-to-one margin. Few were in favor
of Clinton's resignation at this point in the
process.
And. while most believe that President
Clinton did commit perjury, his approval
rating at Stanford remains high, which is
consistent with the current national aver
age.
Students oppose Clinton's removal
Of the 359 students polled, 188 gradu
ate students and 171 undergraduates, 84
percent oppose removal from office,
while a mere 13 percent support it. The
poll has a 5 percent average margin of
error.
History Prof. Jack Rakove explained
opposition to the president's removal by
pointing to the constitutionally mandated
standard of impeachment.
"I would assume that it's the same phe
nomenon at Stanford that you see in gen
eral public opinion. People are willing to
discriminate between what's wrong or im

moral behavior and what constitutes im
peachable conduct," said Rakove, who
testified before a House Judiciary sub
committee last month during the early
stages of the impeachment proceedings.
According to a CNN/USA Today/
Gallup poll. 32 percent of Americans
favor removal, while 63 percent oppose it.
Ileana Carpen, co-president of Stan
lord College Republicans, said that stu
dents support the president in greater
numbers than the general public because

of the subject matter of the charges.
" This matter has been perceived as
going after the president for sexual mis
conduct." Carpen said.
She said that such a perception "is in
correct. [but] because it is perceived that
way and younger people tend to be more
liberal about sexual matters, they would
tend to see less wrong with [the Presi
dent's actions] than older people would."
When asked whether they supported
resignation, 21 percent of students were in

support, while 75 percent oppose it. Na
tionally. 35 percent favor resignation and
61 percent do not.
Rakove found the overwhelming Uni
versity student support for the president
unsurprising.
"If you start with the assumption that
universities tend to be more liberal, then
these results are striking, but not surpris
ing," he said.
Stanford thinks Clinton lied
This support for the President does not
mean that most Stanford students think
that Clinton told the truth, however. Sev
enty-one percent of those polled feel that
the president did commit perjury, whjle
18 percent believe that he did not.
Nationally, 79 percent of voters feel
that the president lied under oath, while
17 percent disagree.
Doug Rivers, a political science pro
fessor who specializes in polls and public
opinion, explained the disparity between
the percentage of people who believe the
president committed perjury and the per
centage who want him removed from of
fice.
"From the very beginning, people
thought that Clinton was lying, but didn't
think they should remove him from of
fice. They thought that what he was lying
about wasn't public business," Rivers
said.
Meanwhile, Krista Glaser, director of
communications for Stanford Democrats,
said she believes that "any reasonable
person" would concede that the president
has committed perjury. However, she
said. "This is not a high crime or misde
meanor which threatens the nation.
