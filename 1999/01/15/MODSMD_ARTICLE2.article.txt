# Students still support Clinton
## 84% oppose his removal from office 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Anuj Gupta Contributing writers 
As the future of Bill Clinton's presi
dency is being debated in the chambers of
the U.S. Senate, most Stanford students
feel that the president should not be re
moved from office, according to a poll
conducted earlier this week by The Stan
ford Daily.
Students opposed to removing the
president from office outnumbered stu
dents supporting his removal by nearly a
seven-to-one margin. Few were in favor
of Clinton's resignation at this point in the
process.
And. while most believe that President
Clinton did commit perjury, his approval
rating at Stanford remains high, which is
consistent with the current national aver
age.
Students oppose Clinton's removal
Of the 359 students polled, 188 gradu
ate students and 171 undergraduates, 84
percent oppose removal from office,
while a mere 13 percent support it. The
poll has a 5 percent average margin of
error.
History Prof. Jack Rakove explained
opposition to the president's removal by
pointing to the constitutionally mandated
standard of impeachment.
"I would assume that it's the same phe
nomenon at Stanford that you see in gen
eral public opinion. People are willing to
discriminate between what's wrong or im

moral behavior and what constitutes im
peachable conduct," said Rakove, who
testified before a House Judiciary sub
committee last month during the early
stages of the impeachment proceedings.
According to a CNN/USA Today/
Gallup poll. 32 percent of Americans
favor removal, while 63 percent oppose it.
Ileana Carpen, co-president of Stan
lord College Republicans, said that stu
dents support the president in greater
numbers than the general public because

of the subject matter of the charges.
" This matter has been perceived as
going after the president for sexual mis
conduct." Carpen said.
She said that such a perception "is in
correct. [but] because it is perceived that
way and younger people tend to be more
liberal about sexual matters, they would
tend to see less wrong with [the Presi
dent's actions] than older people would."
When asked whether they supported
resignation, 21 percent of students were in

support, while 75 percent oppose it. Na
tionally. 35 percent favor resignation and
61 percent do not.
Rakove found the overwhelming Uni
versity student support for the president
unsurprising.
"If you start with the assumption that
universities tend to be more liberal, then
these results are striking, but not surpris
ing," he said.
Stanford thinks Clinton lied
This support for the President does not
mean that most Stanford students think
that Clinton told the truth, however. Sev
enty-one percent of those polled feel that
the president did commit perjury, whjle
18 percent believe that he did not.
Nationally, 79 percent of voters feel
that the president lied under oath, while
17 percent disagree.
Doug Rivers, a political science pro
fessor who specializes in polls and public
opinion, explained the disparity between
the percentage of people who believe the
president committed perjury and the per
centage who want him removed from of
fice.
"From the very beginning, people
thought that Clinton was lying, but didn't
think they should remove him from of
fice. They thought that what he was lying
about wasn't public business," Rivers
said.
Meanwhile, Krista Glaser, director of
communications for Stanford Democrats,
said she believes that "any reasonable
person" would concede that the president
has committed perjury. However, she
said. "This is not a high crime or misde
meanor which threatens the nation.

Americans and Stanford students
are realizing that ... the president
hasn't done something to constitute
getting kicked out of office."
Presidential approval rating high
Even though most agree that the
president committed a criminal of
fense, the majority of Stanford stu
dents feel that he is doing a good job.
The president has a 63 percent job
approval rating among Stanford stu
dents. On the other hand, 32 percent
feel that the president is not doing a
satisfactory job.
Nationally, the president's ap
proval rating is at 67 percent, while
his disapproval rating is 30 percent.
At one point during the impeach
ment proceedings, the president's
support reached as high as 72 per
cent, according to the Gallup poll.
A sudden decline in public sup
port for the president could dramati
cally affect the proceedings, accord
ing to Rakove.
"II in fact there were to be some
significant break in public opinion,
anything is possible. The Republi
cans could get confident and the I de
mocrats could get nervous."
However, Rakove said that such a
change is unlikely. "All the evidence
to this point says that public opinion
is pretty impervious to change no
matter what happens," he said.
Parties may feel effects
A clear majority of the Daily poll
participants also feel that the pro
ceedings will have an effect on the
2(KK) election. Eighty-four percent
feel that the impeachment and trial
will affect Republicans, and 74 per
cent feel it will affect Democrats.
And, while 55 percent disapprove
of how the Republicans in the Senate
are handling their job, only 33 per
cent disapproved of (lie Democrats'
conduct. In each situation, nearly
one-fifth of those polled declined to
answer.

When asked whether or not the
impeachment proceedings will affect
their own vote in the 2(XX) presiden
tial election, only 27 percent said yes.
On the other hand, 61 percent do not
believe that it will influence them.
Pew will watch trial
Only 31 percent of those polled
say that they will watch some of the
trial on television in the weeks
ahead. The majority, 61 percent, say
that they will not.
Communication Prof. Shanto
Iyengar, who teaches a course on po
litical communication, did not find
the lack of interest in watching the
trial surprising.
Iyengar also believes that the tele-

vising of the trial will have little im
pact on public opinion.
"People already have very strong
opinions on this issue, and I don't
think they will he swayed by watch
ing Republicans trying to bringdown
this president and Democrats trying
to defend him," Iyengar said.
Importance of polling
Rivers said lie feels the process of

reporting poll numbers in the media,
which has become a common prac
tice, is a crucial element of the mod
ern political process.
"It's made the political process
much more responsive to the pub
lic," Rivers said. "When the scandal
broke, people from Washington
thought Clinton would be out of of
fice in a matter of weeks. But polls
showed the majority of the people
didn't want that, so he was able to
tolerate a number of extremely dam
aging revelations."
Glaser said she hopes that public
opinion affects the ultimate outcome
of the trial. "1 really do believe that
this is a democracy, where people
who voted a president into office and
don't want him to be kicked out of

that office can voice [their] opinion
and have it be heard. I'd hope that
the Republicans would listen," she
concluded.
However, Carpen said she fears
that the White House and the De
mocrats will attempt to exploit poll
numbers and use them to their ad
vantage."! think the presidential
camp will try to use the polls to pres
sure the Senate into going faster or
not paying as much attention to pro

cedural matters as they would," she
said. "The Democrats will rally
around the polls and will say. The
people have spoken, so we should let
him off.'"
'Another OJ. trial'
Few students were surprised
when told the results of The Daily's
poll.
"It shows that Stanford students
are just as disinterested as the coun
try. [The trial is] turning into another
O.J. [Simpson] trial," said Justin
Donnelly, a freshman.
Senior Mari Webel agrees.
"I think that people realize that
he is doing a generally good job, but
also that he's human."
