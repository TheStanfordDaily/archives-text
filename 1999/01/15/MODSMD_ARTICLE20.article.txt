Striking a blow for Jedi Knights
and Free Sew proponents every
where, Jim "I'm no Mother Daily"
Tankersley was elected Episode 215
editor in chief last night.
The victory was stunning, coming
against a stiff field of Batman, the
Penguin and a joint platform of
Robin Davidson and Elizabeth
Goldman.
Recently returned from Paris,
Tankersley is excited about overturn
ing the ancien regime.
"Laurie's at Oxford - what else do
1 have to do for the next few
months?" he asked.
The new editor in chief has big
plans for coming volume, including
an in-depth series titled "Boise: Cap
ital of Somewhere," new plastic slip
covers in the lounge and replacing
current editor in chief Adam Ke
mezis' cheap beer with classy French
wine.
Addressing the shortage of senior
staffers, Tankersley pointed out the
wealth of underutilized potential edi

tors. including Ewoks, underpaid
graduate students. Phi Delts and
soon-to-be-former Provost Con
doleez.Za Rice.
Noting that the Daily will now
need a cast the size of "Titanic" to
carry out its daily operations, Tanker
sley pledged to devote all of page five
to the staff box in order to make that
page more relevant to the majority of
the Stanford community.
If all staff positions are not soon
filled. Tankersley plans to use the
Force to compel staffers.
"They will join us, or die," he said.
Tankersley's mother predicted his
victory last week when she found his
name written on an "editor in chief"
certificate on the back of an Under
oos box.
"We're proud of our young
Jimmy," she said.
Tankersley's evening ended
abruptly, when the first sip of his vic
tory champagne proved overwhelm
ing. and he passed out.
His last words before fading to
black were, "Don't ever let me get
smashed again."
