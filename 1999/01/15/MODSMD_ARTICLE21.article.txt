# Card boosts spirits with victory
## After downing Trojans, women ready for No. 10 UCLA 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
Sarah Dimson set the tone for last
night's women's basketball game
against the USC Trojans when she
made the game's first basket.
The Cardinal (7-8, 3-1 Pacific 10
Conference) held out strong in the
first half, largely supported by the
sophomore forward, who scored 17
points before the half-time buzzer
alone, the only member of either
team to have scored in double digits,
and 22 in the game overall.
•; "1 just think that putting up shots is
all about finishing," said Dimson.
And that is exactly what the Cardinal
did to the Women of Troy.
' After Dimson's first basket, the
Cardinal never looked back and
never trailed the Trojans (6-8, 2-3),
leading by as many as 13 during the
first half before winning 69-49.
•. Four minutes into the second half,
USC pulled within three points of the
Cardinal, but Dimson, typical of her
pull-it-out style of the night, scored a
basket, giving way to a Cardinal
eight-point run.
"Something got into Sarah
tonight," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "But overall, it was a good

team win. We ran well with the ball.
Sarah had a lot of energy and Milena
[Flores] really stepped up with her
floor leadership."
Flores, a junior guard, went score
less in the first half, but played great
offensively before halftime with five
assists. She really stepped up her play
in the second half, ending up with 14
points overall.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Yesterday: Stanford (7-8,3-1 Pacif
ic 10 Confernce) 69, USC (6-8,2-3)
49.

■ Tomorrow: Stanford vs. No. 10
UCLA (13-4, 5-0), 7:30 p.m. Maples
Pavilion.

Lindsey Yamasaki, Stanford's
leading scorer, ended the night with
10. Stanford's other leading scorer,
sophomore Carolyn Moos, did not
contribute her usual points to the
game, tallying six when the final
buzzer sounded.
The game in general was stronger
defensively than offensively. Many
traveling calls were made, the ball
was stolen often — a total of 22 times
— and Stanford and USC turned the
ball over a total of 45 times.
During the first half, Dimson real

ly carried the team, but Flores took
over that role in the second half.
USC's physical play forced Stanford
into fouling often
"I knew it would be a tough
matchup for us because of [USC's]
athleticism," said VanDerveer. "Car
olyn didn't have a great game and
Lindsey is giving us steady numbers,
but we're looking to get more than
just double figures from [them]."
During the first half, Stanford
seemed to have trouble being able to
put away the Trojans, only leading by
nine at the half, 34-25. The eight
point run lifted the Cardinal's confi
dence and with two minutes left, all
five on the floor were reserves.
The strongest contribution from
the bench came from junior Christina
Batastini, playing well offensively
and defensively and sacrificing a dis
located thumb at the will of a deflect
ed USC ball for a Stanford victory.
The win over the Women of Troy
was important to the Cardinal, which
is going into a game tomorrow
against the Pac-10 leader, UCLA (13-
4, 5-0 Pac-10). Stanford, now 3-1 in
the Pac-10, only trails the Bruins by
one game. With a win tomorrow, the
Cardinal is in a position to place well
in the Pac-10 Conference.

"The win tonight means a lot for
us going into the UCLA game. We're
starting to play better. We just have to
stay with our strengths and work on
not letting fUCLA) go to their
strengths," VanDerveer said.
"We match up with them well.
We're just going to have to play well."
The team not only performed well
in numbers, but the team members
improved their chemistry on the
court. With different people stepping
up and taking a more dominant role,
it gives the entire team a chance to
work together instead of relying on
just a few players at a time.
"We were having a really good
time out there [during the second
half]," said Flores. "We were making
some great passes. As a team, our of
fense was working really well."
Just like USC, UCLA is an older,
more experienced team, with four re
turning starters. The Bruins' veteran
status provides a threat to the Cardi
nal's newer, younger team.
Tomorrow's game against UCLA
gives many opportunities for Stan
ford to not only improve, but also to
make the rest of the Pac-10 look at it
as the threat that it once was.
"For us, the Pac-10 ... is a whole
new season," said VanDerveer.
