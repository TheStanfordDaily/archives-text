WRESTLING

■ Today and Tomorrow: Stanford
will compete at the Aggie Open
Tournament, UC-Davis.

This will be a tough tournament
for the Cardinal. Each weight class
will have a 32-man bracket and
wrestlers ranging from former
Olympians to junior college stu
dents will be able to participate in
this open-style tournament. No
team scores are tallied, so each
team is allowed to wrestle rcdshirt
competitors without using a year of
their eligibility.
Coach Chris Horpel believes it
will be a good challenge for his
team because of the intensity of the
tournament.
"This is really a tough tourna
ment, "he said. "Everyone has to
stay conditioned and focused for
two days, which is really difficult."
Stanford is coming off two big
dual-meet wins against Davis on
Jan. 9 (18-16), and Kutztown tin
Jan. 11 (40-3), both of whom will be
participating in the tournament.
The Cardinal motivation and in

tensity looks to be high entering
tonight's competition.
"The team really looks ready for
this tournament," said junior cap
tain Zach Zimmerer (133 lbs.) fol
lowing the Kutztown win. "We
have had four competitions in the
last week to prepare us for this
tournament."
The Aggie Open will feature
eight teams from California, plus
teams from Oregon and junior col
lege teams. Teams are coming from
as far away as New York to com
pete in this tournament.
In a 32-man bracket, wrestlers
may have to wrestle the maximum
number of five matches each day if
they are in the consolation rounds,
making for a grueling and exhaust
ing day.
"You have to be ready match
after match," Horpel said. "You
might have a tough match and then
you have to be ready 4o do it all
over again in a couple of hours."
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal arc Zimmerer, junior Warren
MePherson (165) and senior Shane
Cross (174). Zimmerer and
MePherson are tied for the team
lead in wins with 12, and Cross is
third with 11 wins.
Zimmerer and MePherson are
both coming off wins against Davis
and Kut/town in which they had no
trouble dominating their oppo
nents.
Zimmerer was not scored upon
in his 8-0 win against Davis and
pinned Kriss Bellanca from Kutz
town. MePherson outscored his op

ponents by a staggering 25-7 in his
two matches.
"After these dual [meets],
everyone is looking good," Zim
merer said. "I think we are really
ready to bite down for this tourna
ment and do well."
Other wrestlers who are going
into the tournament wrestling well
are senior captain Beau Weiner

(157), junior Rudy Ruiz (125) and
junior Tim Kendall (184).
Weiner's takedowns and control
on top has been excellent in his
matches with Davis and Kutztown.
Ruiz has come on strong as of late
and is showing quickness on his
takedowns and a newly found in
tensity.
Kendall is also wrestling well.

He won on an injury forfeit after
dominating Kutztown's Jason
Cabot and wrestled well despite
losing to Davis' David Cobb on a
last second takedown.
"Everyone has been preparing
well." Kendall said. "We have been
training hard throughout our duals
and we are focused on this tourna
ment."
