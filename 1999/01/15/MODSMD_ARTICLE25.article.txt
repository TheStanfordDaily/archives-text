# Campus faces potential flu epidemic
##

Stanford students may be dealing
with more than just the sniffles this
winter season. Cowell Student
Health Center reports that an abnor
mal number of influenza cases have
arisen in the two weeks since students
have been back on campus.
"Before winter break, we had
three individuals come in who fit our
criteria for influenza," said Robyn
Tepper, chief of medical services at
Cowell. "The first week after break
we had 10 cases, and by that week
end, we had 20. Between this Mon
day and Thursday, we've had an ad
ditional 10 cases."
Tepper believes that students may
have caught influenza while at home,
and then brought it back to campus.
While she said this is the case every
year, the flu seems to be the predom

inant infection that is returning with
students this winter. Ira Friedman, di
rector of Cowell, explained that there
is no understood reason for why the
number of flu cases is so great this
year. The variation is simply due to
natural reasons, he said.
"This is always our busiest time of
the season," Tepper said. "But when
it comes to infectious diseases, we
usually have a mish-mosh of things.
This vear, it's mostly been all the
flu."
Another aspect of the flu out
break that is raising concern is the
dramatic increase of cases over a
short period of two weeks. The num
ber amassed so far is larger than in
previous years, and if it continues to
increase over the next week or two,
Cowell will know whether or not they
have a flu epidemic on their hands.
"This could be the pattern for an
epidemic," Friedman said. "The

number of cases is causing concern,
but we don't know whether it will be
spreading and amplifying among the
students."
Students have noted the vast num
ber of individuals that the flu and
other cold-related problems are af
fecting.
"It seems as if half of Bio Core is
sick," said senior Lyen Huang. "In
class, everyone around you is cough
ing."
Cowell is working with the Santa
Clara County Health Department,
which counts the number of individ
ual cases to ascertain whether an epi
demic is present. Currently, Cowell
physicians are also testing the differ
ent viral strains; the health depart
ment uses this data to determine what
to use in 11 u shots. Doctors are also
careful to determine symptoms in
case the patient does not have the flu,
but instead something less or more

serious.
Tepper said influenza symptoms
include an abrupt onset, a fever of 101
degrees or more, profound muscle
aches, a dry cough or sore throat and
the fact that no other cause could ac
count for the symptoms. She empha
sized the importance of visiting Cow
ell immediately should these symp
toms appear.
"If a patient has influenza A, that's
actually treatable," Tepper said.
"Medication can improve symptoms
but only if you come in within a day or
two of its onset."
Tepper also indicated that it
would be better for students not to
share glasses, to cover their mouths
when coughing or sneezing and to
wash their hands in order to prevent
the spread of illness. She added that
one of most negative aspects of in
fluenza is how long it tends to last in
contrast to "run-of-the-mill colds."
