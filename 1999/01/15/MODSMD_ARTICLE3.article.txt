						power of Tai Chi

It's 7:50 on a chilly December
Monday morning in Escondido Vil
lage. Students pedal hurriedly to the
Quad. Mothers wheel their children
on strollers. And 68-year-old Di
Sheng Yin brings an ancient tradition
to the Escondido basketball court, his
face blissfully relaxed but his eyes
transfixed. In slow motion, he alter
nately bows, kicks, squats and punch
es, making no sound nor using any ac

companiment except those from
birds chirping, gears clicking and the
random newspaper hitting a
doorstep.
Where graduate students play H-
O-R-S-E and five-on-five, Di takes to
mid-court taichichuan. better known
simply as tai chi, a martial art prac
ticed by many people in China and
growing in popularity in the United
States, according to teachers at mar
tial arts academies here.
()n any given morning, as many as
five people engage themselves in tai

chi's slow, meditative motions at the
center of Escondido Village. They
are not the throngs that crowd Shang
hai Park in Beijing every morning,
but still enough to draw the bewil
dered glances of graduate students
on their way to class.
"I guess 1 was a little surprised the
first time I saw it," said Andrew
Schober, a doctoral student in ap
plied physics and a native of a Cleve
land suburb. "The first time 1 saw an
old lady [doing tai chij. I didn't know
exactly what she was doing."
l)i and his wife. Su Clin Zheng, 66,
are in California from Beijing for a
brief visit to help care for their infant
grandson. Their daughter works at
nearby Oracle Systems; her husband
is a doctoral student in a combined
program in computer science and
civil engineering. When his grandson
needed baby-sitting, l)i brought his
clothes, his slippers and his morning
tradition of eight years with him to
California.
"1 began tai chi eight years ago
and since then. I have never caught a
cold," Di said through a translator.
Now. "no matter if it rains or not," tai
chi is part of his morning ritual, even
if the open, flat surface necessary for
the martial art is the neighborhood
basketball court.
The three monosyllabic words uii
chi chuan have been translated as
"the fist of truth that punches away
all of the falseness of the true self."
according to San (ice lam. founder
and director of the Ciolden Flower
Tai Chi Institute, an international
martial arts center with locations
from Siberia to Los Angeles, in a
phone interview from his office in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
Fists and punches, though, aren't
the first things that come to mind
when watching the slow, deliberate,
rather pacific tai chi.
To the untrained eve. tai chi can
