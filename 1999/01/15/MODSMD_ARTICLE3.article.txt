# The 						power of Tai Chi

### Joshua Robin Contributing writer 
It's 7:50 on a chilly December
Monday morning in Escondido Vil
lage. Students pedal hurriedly to the
Quad. Mothers wheel their children
on strollers. And 68-year-old Di
Sheng Yin brings an ancient tradition
to the Escondido basketball court, his
face blissfully relaxed but his eyes
transfixed. In slow motion, he alter
nately bows, kicks, squats and punch
es, making no sound nor using any ac

companiment except those from
birds chirping, gears clicking and the
random newspaper hitting a
doorstep.
Where graduate students play H-
O-R-S-E and five-on-five, Di takes to
mid-court taichichuan. better known
simply as tai chi, a martial art prac
ticed by many people in China and
growing in popularity in the United
States, according to teachers at mar
tial arts academies here.
()n any given morning, as many as
five people engage themselves in tai

chi's slow, meditative motions at the
center of Escondido Village. They
are not the throngs that crowd Shang
hai Park in Beijing every morning,
but still enough to draw the bewil
dered glances of graduate students
on their way to class.
"I guess 1 was a little surprised the
first time I saw it," said Andrew
Schober, a doctoral student in ap
plied physics and a native of a Cleve
land suburb. "The first time 1 saw an
old lady [doing tai chij. I didn't know
exactly what she was doing."
l)i and his wife. Su Clin Zheng, 66,
are in California from Beijing for a
brief visit to help care for their infant
grandson. Their daughter works at
nearby Oracle Systems; her husband
is a doctoral student in a combined
program in computer science and
civil engineering. When his grandson
needed baby-sitting, l)i brought his
clothes, his slippers and his morning
tradition of eight years with him to
California.
"1 began tai chi eight years ago
and since then. I have never caught a
cold," Di said through a translator.
Now. "no matter if it rains or not," tai
chi is part of his morning ritual, even
if the open, flat surface necessary for
the martial art is the neighborhood
basketball court.
The three monosyllabic words uii
chi chuan have been translated as
"the fist of truth that punches away
all of the falseness of the true self."
according to San (ice lam. founder
and director of the Ciolden Flower
Tai Chi Institute, an international
martial arts center with locations
from Siberia to Los Angeles, in a
phone interview from his office in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
Fists and punches, though, aren't
the first things that come to mind
when watching the slow, deliberate,
rather pacific tai chi.
To the untrained eve. tai chi can

he described as a series of very slow
karate chops, bows, squats and knee
raises, always done while standing
and never set to music. "No music
suits it," Di said.
Though the motions — which
some say number as high as 108 —
are a few hundred years old, the art's
principles date back thousands of
years to the Chinese village of Chen,
according to San Gee. Masters creat
ed tai chi as a way for their proteges
to improve their performance of
other martial arts. Soon it was so
popular that students were waiting
for three days in front of their teach
ers' doors for lessons.
Although Chinese have been in
the United States for decades, it's
only in the last part of this century
that the ancient art has been prac
ticed by Westerners. San Gee attrib
utes this to two major factors: the
need for office-bound workers to re
lieve tension and Westerners' grow
ing acceptance of different cultures.
"When Chinese were first
brought to the United States, they
were practically slaves," San Gee
said. "I can't imagine anyone back
then wanting to learn something
from a 'Chinaman.'"
Now, tai chi books line bookstore
shelves and dozens of pages on the
martial art are on the Web. Several

academies in the Palo Alto area offer
tai chi classes, and evening courses
are devoted to it at Stanford.
When Di visited Palo Alto last
year, one student was so intrigued
after passing him on her way to class,
she approached him for lessons. Di
barely speaks English but he taught
her the basics in informal early
morning classes.
"She graduated, though," Di said
sadly.
Despite its popularity, tai chi has
its limits. "It's mostly a movement
and it makes people feel better. But
as a practical matter it's not a great
exercise unless you're 80," said Rob
Alvelais, director of Pacific Martial
Arts in Mountain View.
That's good enough reason for Lu
Jun Yu. Sixty, with short gray hair
and a bright red jumpsuit, Lu says
she simply does it "to feel good." She
came to Stanford to help her
nephew, a doctoral student in eco
nomics who is disabled, and she does
tai chi "whenever I have time," often
joining Di and his wife.
"Mostly it helps [you] move the
upper part of your body and improve
your health," she said.
Despite being a native of China,
Lu first learned tai chi from a woman
from the Hunan province who was
also visiting a relative at Stanford.
And where did Lu receive her
first lessons?
On the Escondido Village basket
ball court.
