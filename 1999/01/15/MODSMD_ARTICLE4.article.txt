In a talk preceded by gospel song
and rhythmic dance, playwright Au
gust Wilson exhorted each genera
tion of African-Americans to renew
Martin Luther king. Jr.'s vision of a
classless, casteless society.
"We are here to celebrate a man.
.. who committed himself to fight
for ex-slaves... for equality and jus

Wilson, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1987 and 1990, addressed a
full kresge Auditorium in a speech
titled, "To the Mountain Top ...

"nihilistic" attitude fostered by such
conditions.

Many live in substandard hous

added.
Wilson argued that African-
Americans must counter this ni

ism found in abundance in African

and African-American history.
Our slave ancestors may have
"faltered on the stairs of self-deter
