In a talk preceded by gospel song
and rhythmic dance, playwright Au
gust Wilson exhorted each genera
tion of African-Americans to renew
Martin Luther king. Jr.'s vision of a
classless, casteless society.
"We are here to celebrate a man.
.. who committed himself to fight
for ex-slaves... for equality and jus
tice." Wilson said.
Wilson, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1987 and 1990, addressed a
full kresge Auditorium in a speech
titled, "To the Mountain Top ...
The Journey Continues" as part of a
week-long celebration of King's
birthday.
Emphasizing memory and the
history of African Americans as
slaves and second-class citizens, Wil
son described the conditions his
slave ancestors faced.
Living in dirt floor cabins, slaves
struggled in a world that "refused to
acknowledge their... manners, ...
customs and their humanity."
As African-Americans fight for
constitutional liberties and a fair
wage in modern times, Wilson said,
"we must embrace the contradic
tions of American society. To ig
nore them is to do a great disser
vice."
And as the prime purpose in life
for African-Americans tends to
ward survival, "the contradictions
... have grown more fierce."
We are adrift in"the most dan
gerous of times," Wilson said.
Wilson also drew attention to the
life of struggle and poverty that the
majority of the world knows and the
"nihilistic" attitude fostered by such
conditions.

Many live in substandard hous
ing and witness high infant mortali
ty rates. "Our aspirations are blunt
ed by policies of containment and
the catastrophe of our color," he
added.
Wilson argued that African-
Americans must counter this ni
hilism by embracing the acts of hero
ism found in abundance in African

and African-American history.
Our slave ancestors may have
"faltered on the stairs of self-deter
mination." but not on the stairs of
honor.
"We are all pioneers, trail-blaz
ers." he said. African-Americans
have journeyed from"the hull of a

ship to a culturally robust" group,
he added.
Wilson further argued that
African-Americans have a "cultur
al duty" to promote the thought of
their ancestors.
"We cannot share a single value
system if it does not include the con
tributions of all Americans."
Wilson described his own jour
ney to the discovery of art and self
expression.
"In my 35th year. I [found] the
ater, [which] welcomed me with
fresh endearment — It is by that
road that I am here with you this
evening," he said.
"Out of the rubble of our deeds
and misdeeds... we have arrived at
this place."
Wilson was brought here by
Stanford's Martin Luther King, Jr.
Celebration Committee.
