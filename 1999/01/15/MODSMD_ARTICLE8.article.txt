Tipper Gore announces mental
health initiative
LEBANON, N.H. (AP) — The White House will
ask Congress for a 24 percent increase in mental
health grants for states. Tipper Gore told a group of
doctors Thursday.
"Despite the many advances we have made in sci
ence, research and treatment, mental illness contin
ues to be treated differently from physical illness,"
said Mrs. Gore, the vice president's wife who's also a
mental health adviser to President Clinton.
The White House will ask for $358 million in
mental health block grants for fiscal year 2(HX), about
$70 million more than this year.

The White House also plans to hold a conference
on mental illness in the spring and Clinton plans to
seek exemptions from competitive hiring practices
for federal jobs for people with psychiatric disabili
ties, Mrs. Gore said in a speech to doctors at Dart
mouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
Such exemptions already are available for the
mentally retarded and those suffering severe physi
cal disabilities.
The block grants pay for treating mentally ill peo
ple outside of hospitals.
The National Mental Health Association in
Alexandria, Va., said better community-based care
is needed because improvements in medications
have allowed more patients to be treated in their
communities.

Battle rages to save Europe's duty
free shopping
ABOARD THE PRIDE OF BRUGES (AP) —
Many passengers on this ferry chugging across the
English Channel are afraid of losing a cherished institu
tion — duty-free shopping — that is also a $7-billion
industry.
Barring a reprieve, the European Union will abolish
duty-free perks June 30 — perks enjoyed by millions in
search of cheap booze, cigarettes and perfume as they
fly or sail from one EU nation to another. Such goods
bought in duty-free stores on a traveler's way out of a
country are not subject to that nation's taxes.
The impending ban provoked strong reactions from

shoppers in the Pride of Bruges' duty-free store during
the hourlong crossing from Dover, England, to the
French port of Calais.
Such strong reactions carry little weight with Mario
Monti, the EU's tax commissioner, who estimates the
tax breaks enjoyed by duty-free stores give them a year
ly $2.3 billion advantage over other retailers. He adds
that duty-free has no place in a border-free Europe.
The ban won't apply to duty-free sales for people
traveling to or from the EU from countries outside the
15-nation bloc.
In 1991, EU nations all voted for abolition, granting
a seven-year grace period for the industry to prepare.
Overturning that ruling needs another unanimous vote
and some governments are determined to kill off duty
free shopping.
