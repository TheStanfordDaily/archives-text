Foregoing a stint in the
Overseas Studies Program
can be the right choice

LAST WEEK, I decided not to apply
for the Overseas Study Program.
Over the past year, ! have attended
more OSP information sessions than I can
count on one hand. I have listened to older
students returning from overseas campuses
talk about the incredible adventures they
had and the wonderfully unique friend
ships that they made while abroad. At cer
tain points. I found that I did not even par
ticularly care about which overseas campus
I was going to study at. Paris? Oxford? It
did not matter; I was tantalized simply by
the thought of having a fantastic experi
ence overseas.
Determined to study abroad, I
researched my options with all possible due
diligence. In fact, I even checked out over
seas programs at other schools, to make
sure that Stanford's programs were on par
with Columbia in Paris, Yale in London
and the like. Then, by the end of winter
break. I had checked over all the details,
and I felt that I was finally ready to apply
for Stanford's Oxford program.
But something changed: As if I had
found a small clearing within a jungle of
study-abroad pamphlets and glossy, entic
ing pictures, I realized that overseas study
was not the right decision.
My absolute indifference in clearly
important choices, such as choosing
between Paris and Oxford, indicated to me
that the reasons for my initial desire to go
abroad were of the wrong kind. I did not
want to travel overseas for the benefit of
my education. Stated more directly. I
found that only a handful of classes are
offered on the overseas campuses and out
of those only one or two at each campus

actually held some interest for me.
So, the real question became, why
should I forego an entire quarter of classes
here at Stanford, which precisely fit my pri
mary interests in symbolic systems and
English, simply for the sake of "having an
overseas experience"? For me, OSP slowly
started to appear more like a vacation from
Stanford than an extension of my Stanford
experience.
Many times, I have reflected on the fact
that there are more courses that I want to
take at Stanford than I could possibly fit
into four or five short years. Every quarter
that I stay at Stanford lets me take more of
the classes that interest me. All of a sud
den, going overseas and being forced to
choose from a severely limited set of class- |
; es made no sense.
My advocacy of academics here at Stan
' ford should not be taken as an attack on
any of the activities that happen outside of
the classroom, either overseas or right
I here. On the contrary, the very reason I
came to Stanford was because of the won
derful balance that exists between the dif
ferent aspects of a well-rounded life: study,
athletics, work, play, friendships, etc. Tak
i ing into consideration each of these aspects
with equal importance, I do not believe
pushing academics aside for a quarter is the
' right decision — wonderful "overseas
experience" or not. Similarly. I would
I never do the same to any other aspect of
I student life.
My purpose in writing about this deci
i sion is not in any way to slight overseas
study, is clearly instead to promote the
i importance of considering all aspects of a
\ significant decision. For some people, over
: seas study may be the right option, but I
) encourage those who are unsure to look
t closely at the opportunities here at Stan-
I ford. You just might find, like l did, that
I every minute here at Stanford is unparal
i leled and unique in its enrichment,
