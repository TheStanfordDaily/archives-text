As a boom in the popularity of swing dance has swept
the country, Stanford has seen a dramatic rise of interest in
social dance classes and activities. This phenomenon has
been accompanied by longer class sign-up lines, over
crowding at dances and a $50 entrance fee for Social
Dance 1. leaving many students asking what could be done
to remedy these problems.
To reserve a spot in Drama 46: "Social Dances of North
America 1" this quarter, students started forming a line at
midnight the night before sign ups. For the first time ever,
students brought tents, and only those who came before
6:30 a.m. were able to join the class.
Lecturer Richard Powers, leader of the Vintage Dance
Ensemble and teacher of Social Dance 1. said the line last
spring was a "zoo." Senior Dance Lecturer Tony Kramer

As the Dance Division suffered an annual budget cut
of $30,(XX) two years ago, Kramer does not forsee the Uni
versity building a new studio in the near future. " The Uni-
will build a science quad, but I don't think they'll
build a performing arts center right now." Kramer said.
The budget cut resulted in the reduction of certain fac
ulty members' salaries as well as the institution of a $50 fee
for the most popular dance class, Social Dance I.
"We have a deficit that we are working on. The fee is
used to catch up: it is not extra money," said Dance Divi
sion Chair Susan Cashion, who for the past three years has
been lobbying the School of Humanities and Sciences for
more money. The money is used for everything from peo
ple and equipment to supporting the dance minor.
Cashion says she is unhappy to charge the fee and feels
