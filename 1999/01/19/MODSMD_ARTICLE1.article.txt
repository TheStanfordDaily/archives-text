# Swing fad strains Dance Div.

As a boom in the popularity of swing dance has swept
the country, Stanford has seen a dramatic rise of interest in
social dance classes and activities. This phenomenon has
been accompanied by longer class sign-up lines, over
crowding at dances and a $50 entrance fee for Social
Dance 1. leaving many students asking what could be done
to remedy these problems.
To reserve a spot in Drama 46: "Social Dances of North
America 1" this quarter, students started forming a line at
midnight the night before sign ups. For the first time ever,
students brought tents, and only those who came before
6:30 a.m. were able to join the class.
Lecturer Richard Powers, leader of the Vintage Dance
Ensemble and teacher of Social Dance 1. said the line last
spring was a "zoo." Senior Dance Lecturer Tony Kramer
estimates that) (X) students are turned away every quarter.
Many students question why the Dance Division does
not create another class. According to Kramer, money
and space in the dance studio are limiting factors. The
Roble Dance Studio is the only dance studio on campus,
and it is filled all day with dance classes of other genres.
"We could probably fill the studio all day. every day
With just social dance, but that wouldn't fill our purpose,"
said Kramer. Despite the recent swing fad, Kramer feels
the mission of the Dance Division of the Drama Depart
ment is to "support the diversity of the world of dance."
As the Dance Division suffered an annual budget cut
of $30,(XX) two years ago, Kramer does not forsee the Uni
versity building a new studio in the near future. " The Uni-
will build a science quad, but I don't think they'll
build a performing arts center right now." Kramer said.
The budget cut resulted in the reduction of certain fac
ulty members' salaries as well as the institution of a $50 fee
for the most popular dance class, Social Dance I.
"We have a deficit that we are working on. The fee is
used to catch up: it is not extra money," said Dance Divi
sion Chair Susan Cashion, who for the past three years has
been lobbying the School of Humanities and Sciences for
more money. The money is used for everything from peo
ple and equipment to supporting the dance minor.
Cashion says she is unhappy to charge the fee and feels
that "it was saddled on us hy the Ath
letics Department," which made the
budget cut. At the time of the budget
cut, the Dance Division was under
the auspices of the Athletics Depart
ment. Two years ago dance became a
part of the Drama Department.
Students protested the fee two
years ago when it was first intro
duced. Stephanie Moore, a junior
who waited in line an hour and a half
last year to take the class, considers
the fee "fairly aggravating consider
ing I'm already paying the school al
most $ 1 (J,(XK) ii quarter."
Other students, such as Janet Ho,
a sophomore who took the class last
year, seem less bothered by the fee." I
really wanted to take the class." Janet
said she doesn't know anyone who
wanted to take the class but didn't be
cause of the fee.
The Dance Division has chosen to
charge a fee only for Social Dance I
because it is the most popular class.
" There was a fear that a smaller fee in

many classes would cut the popula
tion of those classes," said Cashion.
"If we lose some of the population of
Social Dance I, we still have enough
people to fill the class," she added.
Increased attendance at Jammix,
a monthly social dance event, is an in
dicator of the popularity of swing on
campus. Last spring around 7(X) peo
ple showed up but only 300 could be
admitted.
While participation in Jammix
and other social dance events increas
es, complaints have been heard from
female dancers about the presence of
"sketchy guys."
"They are generally single, mid
dle-aged men looking for young
dance partners," comments Powers,
who has had to ask people to leave
the dance.
Powers sent out an e-mail to the
dance list about "sketchy guys" dur
ing fall quarter after overhearing a
conversation between sophomore
Alexis Tygenhof and a female friend
at Jammix. The two had been asked
out by the same older man who had
given each girl his business card. Pow
ers felt this was a violation of I Jniver

sity policy which, according to Pow
ers, states that men cannot come on
campus with the sole purpose of
l(H>king for dates. Tygenhof says she
"was surprised it was such a big deal."
Powers said he will occasionally
"notice a guy whose every partner is
wincing in pain" or will hear com
plaints directly from girls who are re
peatedly asked to dance by the same
man.
Although Powers finds most of
these men to be non-Stanford stu
dents, he has not started checking stu
dent IDs at the door. He says he is
happy to welcome people from out
side the Stanford community as long
as they contribute to a positive envi
ronment.
The swing fad has had largely pos
itive effects on campus enthusiasm
for competitive social dance as well.
One hundred people showed up to
audition for 20 spots in the Vintage
Dance Ensemble, an 80-person
group with both Victorian and swing
teams.
Senior Will Budreau has been so
cial dancing since his freshman year.
"I'm just going to be upset when I'm

still swinging and people say, 4 Oh,
that's so two years ago!' "
But even with little relief in sight

from the University for the pro
gram's problems, the popularity of
social dance remains healthy.
