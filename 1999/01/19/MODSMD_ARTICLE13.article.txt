### 
GENEVA (AP) â€” With no immediate break
through in sight, the United Stales adjourned talks Sun
day on gaining access to what it believes is an under
ground site North Korea is using to develop nuclear
weapons.
U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman and North
Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan will
meet again next weekend after a u <nd of more gener
al peace talks during the week, U.S. and North Korean
diplomats said.
The wider talks, which start Tuesday, involve North
and South Korea, along with the United States and
China. The four sides launched the talks 13 months ago
in an effort to replace the 1953 Korean War armistice
with a permanent peace treaty. Until now, participants
have made only slow headway on procedural issues.
Progress on the nuclear issue was expected to set the
tone for the week's four-party talks.
Washington has so far rejected North Korean
demands for $3(H) million in compensation to inspect
the Kumehangni underground site, which was revealed

last summer in satellite photos. Pyongyang says it needs
the money because it won't be able to use the facility
after outsiders have seen it. but denies it uses the site
for nuclear weapons.
Detection of the site has renewed fears about the
nuclear ambitions of the North's reclusive Communist
government and inflamed tensions on the divided
Korean peninsula.
The North Korean and American diplomats, who
refused to give their names, gave no details about the
adjourned round of weekend talks.
North Korea's foreign minister told journalists earli
er that the two sides were "stuck" in the opening ses
sions Saturday.
"1 don't know whether we will manage to overcome
our differences," Kim said before Sunday's meeting at
North Korea's lakeside diplomatic mission.
Kartman left the meeting without comment.
Two previous rounds of U.S.-North Korean talks in
Washington and New York failed to make any
progress.
