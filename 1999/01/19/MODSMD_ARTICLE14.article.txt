# Gruesome Kosovo massacre incites more conflict, draws condemnation

RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) —
Scattered on a Kosovo hillside and
heaped together in a muddy gully,
the bodies of 45 ethnic Albanians
were found shot or mutilated Satur
day in what appears to be the worst
killing spree of the nearly year-old
conflict.
International monitors
expressed horror at the grisly dis
covery, which came a day after Serb
forces attacked the area in southern
Kosovo. The killings present the
gravest threat yet of a return to full
scale combat in the separatist
province.
Some of the dead had their eyes
gouged out or heads smashed • i
and one man lay decapitated in iru
courtyard of his compound. The
victims included one young woman
and a 12-year-old boy and many
were older men, including one of
age 70.
Many had been shot at close
range, and residents of Racak vil
lage said Serb forces had rounded
up the men, driven them up the hill
and shot them. Twenty-eight of the
bodies lay at the bottom of a nar
row ravine.
All the victims were dressed in
civilian clothing, despite the insis
tence of Serb police that most of the
"terrorists" wore uniforms of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
Visibly upset and his voice shak
ing after visiting the site, the U.S.
head of the Kosovo monitoring
mission called it a massacre, "an
unspeakable atrocity," and "a
crime very much against humani
ty "
"Nor do 1 hesitate to accuse the

government security forces of
responsibility," William Walker
said, urging prosecutors from the
International War Crimes Tribunal
to come investigate, with or without
permission from Yugoslav authori
ties.
A spokesman for the U.N. tri
bunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
said prosecutors were demanding
immediate access to the site.
In Washington, the State
Department said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright hopes to hold a
meeting of NATO powers on Sun
day or Monday to discuss a
response to the massacre.
World leaders voiced shock and
anger.
President Clinton condemned
the massacre "in the strongest pos
sible terms."
"This was a deliberate and indis
criminate act of murder designed to
sow fear among the people of Koso
vo." he said.
In Brussels, Belgium, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana
warned that the alliance "will not
tolerate a return to all-out fighting
and a policy of repression in Koso
vo."
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called for a lull investiga
tion, saying he was shocked and
"gravely concerned."
In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian
political leader Ibrahim Rugova
renewed his call for NATO inter
vention after the "cruel attack."
KLA representative Adem
Demaci blasted the authorities for
the massacre and called on all
Kosovo Albanians to rally behind

the rebel foree.
"The murder of children shows
that Belgrade wants to destroy (eth
nic) Albanians' future," his office
said in a statement. "The regime
does not want any political solution,
just Kosovo as a colony, not only
occupied but without Albanians."
Verifiers and journalists came
across the carnage on Saturday
morning in Racak, 15 miles south of
the provincial capital, Pristina, after
having been barred from the site by
Serbian police the previous day.
The wails of women discovering
the loss of their men could be heard
as residents who had evacuated on
Friday returned. One by one the
monitors counted the bodies, which
they said numbered 45. The KLA
later claimed it had counted 51
dead, including a 3-month-old
baby, which could not be con
firmed.
It was the highest single death
toll — and perhaps the bloodiest
spree of the nearly yearlong conflict
— since an (Oct. 12 truce brokered
by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that largely halted more
than seven months of combat in the
separatist province of Serbia.
The massacre came just two days
after the KLA freed eight Yugoslav
army soldiers, ending a tense five
dav standoff.
"We were hoping for a recipro
cal confidence-building measure."
said Walker, head of the three
month-old Kosovo Verification
Mission. "Instead we have
this... the killing of innocent civil
ians."
