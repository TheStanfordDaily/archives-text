# Delaware lawyer convicted of murdering mistress, dumping corpse
## 
### 
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — A politically connected lawyer who had
an affair with the governor's secretary was convicted Sunday of murdering
her and dumping the body at sea in a case that exposed lurid details about
Delaware's elite.
Jurors deliberated for three days before deciding Thomas Capano was
guilty of killing Anne Marie Fahey, who was Gov. Thomas Carper's
scheduling secretary.
Without a body, a weapon or any concrete evidence to prove how Ms.
Fahey died, prosecutors used circumstantial evidence to show Capano had
planned her death. Jurors had to believe the crime was premeditated to
convict on the sole charge of first-degree murder.
Capano could be sentenced to death.
The jury reached a verdict shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday after three
days of deliberations in the 12-week-long trial.
Capano stared stone-faced as the verdict — "guilty as charged'' — was
read Sunday morning to a silent courtroom. Outside the room, people who
couldn't get inside clapped and cheered.
Capano's mother, Marguerite, and Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-
Hosey, both burst into tears.
Jurors will begin to hear testimony in the trial's sentencing phase on
Wednesday.
Capano admitted he stuffed Ms. Fahey's body in a cooler and threw it
overboard from his brother's boat. But he insisted that another mistress
had accidentally shot Ms. Fahey at his home in a jealous rage and that he
got rid of the body to protect the woman.
Prosecutors ridiculed that story and said Capano, a married man. killed

Ms. Fahey because she wanted to end their secret three-year affair.
The trial had Delawareans transfixed, exposing sensational details about
some of the most influential people in this usually staid financial center,
with its tightly interlocking circles of law, politics and business.
Ms. Fahey was the scheduling secretary for Carper.
Capano is a former prosecutor and legal counsel to Carper's predeces
sor. and his family operates a construction business that has built houses all
over the Wilmington area. During the trial, Delaware's chief deputy attor
ney general took a leave of absence after acknowledging on the stand that
he and Capano's other mistress had a sexual encounter that Capano
arranged.
The trial also split Capano's close family. His brothers Gerard and
Louis, who helped him dispose of evidence, testified against him, while his
brother Joseph testified on his behalf.
Prosecutors relied on circumstantial evidence to show Capano planned
Ms. Fahey's death.
They introduced passages from Ms. Fahey's diary, including the final
entry, made a few months before she disappeared, in which she called
Capano "a controlling, manipulative, insecure, jealous maniac."
Prosecutors also relied on the testimony of Gerard Capano, who said his
brother had complained of being extorted and asked whether he could use
Gerard's boat if he killed someone. Gerard Capano testified that he took
his brother in his boat 6() miles off the New Jersey coast to get rid of the
body and that they shot the cooler to try to make it sink.
A week later, fishermen found a pinkish-stained cooler with a slug hole
in it. There was no sign of the btxiy or the gun.

Ms. Fahey, 30, disappeared after she and Capano dined at an elegant
Philadelphia restaurant on June 27, 19%. Capano long maintained he
didn't know what happened to her.
But bloodstains were found in Capano's house and on the hack seat of
his Jeep. And investigators learned that Capano had replaced a rug and
received help from one of his brothers in getting rid of a bloodstained sofa
not long after Ms. Fahey vanished.
In a stunning turnaround, Capano admitted at his trial that Ms. Fahey
was killed at his house and that he disposed of her body the next day. But
he said that another mistress. Deborah Maelntvre. shot Ms. Fahey, and he
panicked and "basically made the wrong decision."
He said he lied to protect Ms. Maclntyre, a former administrator at
Wilmington's prestigious Tatnall School. She carried on an 18-vear affair
with Capano, who had worked with her husband.
Ms. Maclntyre denied she shot Ms. Fahey and said she wasn't even at
Capano's house that night. Instead, she testified that Capano had her buy a
gun for him a month before Ms. Fahey died.
In closing arguments, prosecutor Colm Connolly called Capano's story
of one mistress killing another "ludicrous." If Ms. Fahey died accidentally,
Capano could simply have called authorities, Connolly said.
"If anybody was going to be given the benefit of the doubt, it was the
defendant, with his political connections,' he said.
While in prison awaiting trial, Capano was indicted on charges he tried
to have Ms. Maclntyre and Gerard Capano killed.
As testimony about the death of her sister ended. Kathleen Fahey-
Hosey remarked: "We have been surrounded by some very evil people."
