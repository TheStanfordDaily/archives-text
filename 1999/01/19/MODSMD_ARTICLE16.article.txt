University provided pletho
ra of activities to remember
King's life and social hopes

Even with stanfords
incredible academic resources,
most students learn as much from
classmates and extracurricular activities as
they do in the classroom. Guest lecturers,
movie screenings and artistic productions
provide a thriving intellectual life for all
interested students, regardless of their
grade point averages.
This was especially evident during the
week preceding Martin Luther King Jr.
Day. While professors might bemoan the
loss of another Monday of winter c|uarter
and many students might have thought lit
tle of the holiday during a three-day ski or
camping trip. University groups did an
excellent job of providing opportunities for
students to learn more about Martin
Luther King Jr. and African-American cul
ture.
Many schools across the country do not
even commerate Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.
The highlight of the week preceding the
holiday was a speech on Thursday night by
noted playwright August Wilson. Stan
ford's Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration
Committee arranged for Wilson to speak
on campus.
Wilson, a two-time Pulitzer Prize win
ner, celebrated King's life and memory by
addressing the problems of poverty among
African-Americans and continuing racism
in American society.
Wilson exhorted a full crowd at Kresge

Auditorium to "embrace the contradic
tions of American society." The contradic
tions include America's history of slavery
alongside professed equality and continua
tion of substandard housing and high infant
mortality rates in nianv African-American
communities.
Wilson's appearance reflects the Uni
versity's solid commitment to celebrating
King's legacy and promoting racial under
standing on campus. In addition to Wil
son's speech. Martin Luther King Jr. week
also featured a speech about post
apartheid South Africa by visiting Islamic
Studies Prof. Ebrahini Moosa.
Prof. Clayborne Carson, director of the
Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project,
met Wednesday afternoon with other
scholars and community leaders in a public
discussion of community activism. The
next afternoon, students were invited along
with faculty and staff to a brown-bag lunch
with Wilson.
These myriad activities are part of the
reason why the University ranks 10th
nationwide in a list of the best colleges and
universities for African-Americans in a
recent survey by Black Enterprise Maga
zine. Stanford ranked above traditional
peers Harvard and Yale and was also high
er than several historically black institu
tions.
Students from all ethnic and socio-eco
nomic backgrounds benefit from cultural
activities designed to promote greater
racial understanding and acceptance. Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Week was an excellent
example of education working outside the
classroom.
We hope the University continues to
use its resources to turn holidays into edu
cational opportunities.
