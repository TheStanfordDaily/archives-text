## The 						gross anatomy of a phone call 
### 
After last
week, I thought it
would be a good
idea to write a really seri
ous column about a real
issue facing us all.
Encouraged by a fellow
columnist, who apparently

thinks there are a number of ways to be
funny, including writing the same column
over and over again, 1 decided to discuss The
Phone Call. But not just any phone call.
We're talking, about the "date" phone call.
The phone call is a crucial first step to a
date. One has to pick up the phone, dial a
number (and I don't mean dial half the dig
its, then hang up), and finally talk to the per
son at the other end. But it's not that easy.
Starting the process is the pre-dial ritual,
involving pacing, rehearsing and painful
anticipation: "Does she like me? Will she say
no? Are my pants too tight? Where's my yo
yo?"
In my vast experience, I've noticed that
some methods for making the call work bet
ter than others.
Here's a quick example:
"Hello."
"Hey baby, how'd you like to get
tenured?"
Dial tone.
"Hello? Hello? Professor Sawislak?"
Discouraged, yes. Defeated, no. Another
example:
"Hey, baby!"
"Who is this?"
"It's me, baby! Say. what are you doing..
." Dial tone. How was I supposed to know
Condoleezza Rice doesn't date undergrads?
A common mistake is to get caught up in
the moment and forget what you wanted to
say:
"Hello?"

Silence.
"Helllloo?"
"llhhh ... my uncle has a parrot."
Dial tone.
These short examples are helpful but do
not really explain the typical date phone call.
However, the following extended conversa
tion may:
"Hello, is Jane there?"
This is the introduction. It means: Get
ready for the proposal.
"Yes, this is Jane. Urn ... why are you
calling me?"
I ranslation: confusion — the shop was
closed. Don't you know to wait for business
hours?
"Uh ..." The introductory offer.
"Yes?"
Introductory offer declined.
"I was just wondering if maybe you want
ed to do something this weekend?" The sub
stantial follow-up.
"Umm, oh God ... uh, oh! I just got call
waited, can you hold on a sec?"
Second offer declined. Request time to
construct counter-offer.
1 wo minutes and a lot of roommate dis
cussion later:
"Thanks for waiting. That was, um, my
friend or something." They're back at the
table.
"Great! So about this weekend?"
Request for the counter-offer.
"Yeah, I have plans for Friday and Satur
day until summer." Official rejection of the
initial substantial offer (note: date of call was
late fall quarter). Prelude to the counter
offer. "But do you think you'd want to get
some yogurt?"
Token of consolation offered to smooth
out the negotiation (yogurt??). She'd sooner
do business with a first cousin.
"Oh, um, great! That'd be cool." Forced

acceptance. Crushed spirit. Accepted defeat.
"OK. Good then, I guess. I'll give you a
call about the yogurt." This means if you
were the last man on earth, I'd date a mon
key.
"All right, I'M talk to you then!" Super. Ill
go die now.
So there you go. The anatomy of the
phone call. A common reaction to this is
something like the following: "I will never
attempt to date again."
But that's all wrong. Life isn't about
always winning — it's about always trying. I
think that a lot of us (I know that I do) forget
that the end isn't everything — getting there
is half the battle. And yes, if you put that
phone back down without calling the fateful
numbers, you won't get rejected. But you
sure won't win either. And is that what life is
really all about?
As Theodore Roosevelt once said, "The
credit belongs to the man who is actually in
the arena, whose face is marred by dust and
sweat and blood ... who errs and comes
short again and again ... who at the best,
knows in the end the triumph of high
achievement, and who, at the worst, if he
fails, at least fails while daring greatly so that
his place shall never be with those timid souls
who know neither victory or defeat."
I'm not sure what Teddy was thinking
about when he came up with that, but he's
right. Who cares how many times you
haven't lost, if you've never won? Live a lit
tle, get rejected every now and then, take a
chance, and look back with a smile when you
can count your wins, laugh at your losses and
realize that you truly lived.

Dan Geyser, a senior majoring in political sci
ence, knows this subject is trite and overdone.
So, bitter people, spare him the letters.
