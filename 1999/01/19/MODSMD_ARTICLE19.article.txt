Community is not opposed to
grad housing
As I read the Jan. 11 editorial on com
munity criticism of Stanford, 1 find the
author has not been listening carefully to
the ongoing community conversation. I
attended the town hall meeting on gradu
ate student housing and not one speaker
opposed any of Stanford's proposed grad
uate student housing developments.
Irving to live in this area on low
stipends does create a crisis for many
graduate students. The community
applauds Stanford's proposals to build
low-cost graduate student and faculty
housing on campus to relieve this crisis.
1 he only voice of concern — not opposi
tion was from the Palo Alto school dis
trict, whose enrollment will directly or
indirectly be increased by on-campus
development. I am disappointed that
instead of thanking the community for its
support of on campus housing, we are
accused of standing in the way of crisis res
olution.
Ideally, crises are avoided by planning.
Positive future outcomes are attained by
planning. Ihe voices asking for a commit
ment to permanent open space on Stan
ford land are asking Stanford to engage in
planning. The editorial is correct that
other communities adjacent to Stanford

are densely developed. This does not
remove Stanford's opportunity and
responsibility to plan what it will do with
its land.
I he editorial then refers to Stanford's
fundamentally aeademie mission. I would
like to suggest that Stanford's academic
goals will best be served by a permanent
commitment of some land as open space.
No academic course in ethics or any
other subject can speak as clearly as the
actions of wise and decisive leadership. No
matter what the luture brings, students,
faculty and the community will all need
and benefit from contact with wild grasses
and muddy hills. A commitment to open
space will allow us all to stand on Stanford
land with joy and gratitude, not doubt and
suspicion.

Overseas Studies Program
focuses on rigorous study
This letter is in response to Neville San
jana's Jan. 15 editorial notebook on the
Overseas Studies Program.
We recognize that OSP is not for every
one, and that often times students feel tha«
they cannot leave Stanford even for a
quarter due to their major and minor

requirements. Sanjana's implication that
the OSP experience is a vacation, howev
er, is mistaken.
A Stanford in Oxford education is
quite ditterent than that which main cam
pus offers.
Students take tutorials instead of class
es, so the average amount of time actually
spent in class is minimal. This does leave
time tor some travel and the requisite trips
to the kebab van.
I he tutorial system, however, is
intense. We re handed a lengthy reading
list for the week, along with a topic for a 6-
K page paper, spend all week reading and
writing the paper, and return the following
week to read our papers aloud to our
tutors. We have to defend our writing and
take direct criticism; it's a far cry from
whipping out a paper based on the lecture
you heard in class and running it over to
the History Corner.
1 utorials are so rigorous, in fact, that
many students submit their work in
Oxford as Stanford honors theses. Others
leave after just one term in order to keep
up with their course requirements, and
many of them will have to take heavy
course loads for the rest of the year as a
result of going away. Few, however, would
consider their time at Oxford a "vacation"
from their studies from difficult course
work.

On-campus forum exists for
race dialogue
I have been reading Dan Geyser's last
two columns and the ensuing responses in
your letters section. It's obvious that Mr.
Geyser's column has created a provoca
tive communication about diversity issues
and affected an alleged campus void in
dialogue about race and ethnicity at Stan
ford.
As provocative as this media discussion
may be, there is another forum where
these discussions could take place, one
that would allow for deeper communica
tion about these complex issues. I am
referring to campus race (and other diver
sity) dialogue groups. I would like to
invite Dan Geyser and other students to
join a dialogue group this quarter.
Last year, Residential Education and
the Dean of Students Office sponsored a
Stanford Race Dialogue. Eleven groups
met for a minimum of six times for an
hour at each meeting. A few of the groups
met for two quarters.
These groups are designed to create
face-to-face conversations about diversity

in small groups (8 to 16 students) that are
led by staff and student facilitators. Stu
dents in the groups decide what issues
they wish to address. Facilitators gate
keep to ensure ground rules that are
developed by the group are honored. In
our evaluation of the program, students
and facilitators indicated they were
pleased to have the opportunity to dia
logue in a more intimate forum where
they had the time to discuss issues.
If you are interested in joining a dia
logue group this quarter, please contact
both Sonya Elder (selder@leland), a Resi
dential Education staff person, and a resi
dent assistant in your house to indicate
your interest. I will work with residence
staff to create a dialogue group for you. If
you do not hear from Sonya or me imme
diately, please be patient because we must
recruit facilitators and make logistical
arrangements. Dialogues that begin this
quarter can continue next quarter or until
each group is satisfied it has met its goals.
Some dialogue groups have emerged
on campus that were student-initiated.
Dialogue is not complicated, but a few
guidelines are useful. If you would like to
start a dialogue group, I would be happy
to assist you.

list for the week, along with a topic for a 6-
K page paper, spend all week reading and
writing the paper, and return the following
week to read our papers aloud to our
tutors. We have to defend our writing and
take direct criticism; it's a far cry from
whipping out a paper based on the lecture
you heard in class and running it over to
the History Corner.
1 utorials are so rigorous, in fact, that
many students submit their work in
Oxford as Stanford honors theses. Others
leave after just one term in order to keep
up with their course requirements, and
many of them will have to take heavy
course loads for the rest of the year as a
result of going away. Few, however, would
consider their time at Oxford a "vacation"
from their studies from difficult course
work.

On-campus forum exists for
race dialogue
I have been reading Dan Geyser's last
two columns and the ensuing responses in
your letters section. It's obvious that Mr.
Geyser's column has created a provoca
tive communication about diversity issues
and affected an alleged campus void in
dialogue about race and ethnicity at Stan
ford.
As provocative as this media discussion
may be, there is another forum where
these discussions could take place, one
that would allow for deeper communica
tion about these complex issues. I am
referring to campus race (and other diver
sity) dialogue groups. I would like to
invite Dan Geyser and other students to
join a dialogue group this quarter.
Last year, Residential Education and
the Dean of Students Office sponsored a
Stanford Race Dialogue. Eleven groups
met for a minimum of six times for an
hour at each meeting. A few of the groups
met for two quarters.
These groups are designed to create
face-to-face conversations about diversity

in small groups (8 to 16 students) that are
led by staff and student facilitators. Stu
dents in the groups decide what issues
they wish to address. Facilitators gate
keep to ensure ground rules that are
developed by the group are honored. In
our evaluation of the program, students
and facilitators indicated they were
pleased to have the opportunity to dia
logue in a more intimate forum where
they had the time to discuss issues.
If you are interested in joining a dia
logue group this quarter, please contact
both Sonya Elder (selder@leland), a Resi
dential Education staff person, and a resi
dent assistant in your house to indicate
your interest. I will work with residence
staff to create a dialogue group for you. If
you do not hear from Sonya or me imme
diately, please be patient because we must
recruit facilitators and make logistical
arrangements. Dialogues that begin this
quarter can continue next quarter or until
each group is satisfied it has met its goals.
Some dialogue groups have emerged
on campus that were student-initiated.
Dialogue is not complicated, but a few
guidelines are useful. If you would like to
start a dialogue group, I would be happy
to assist you.
