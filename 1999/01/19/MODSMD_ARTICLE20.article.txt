## Living the greatest moment in history â€” again 
### 
Robin Moroney

History repeats itself, said
Marx, the lirst time as tragedy and
the second time as farce. His calcu
lations. it seems, were correct. Alter all, this
is the second I J.S. impeachment, and what a
farce it is. It resembles one of those grand old
British larces, where three couples check into
a hotel under the name of Mr. and Mrs.
Smith and everybody winds up in bed with
the wrong person.
1 he politicians clearly love the idea that
they are involved somehow in the business of
history. You can't get them to shut up about
it. " I oday. we make a decision which speedy
time, on its dusty voyage from dawn to dusk,
has allotted to us, the mere spokes on the
great wheel of history, thus to decide on the
very course of this great nation," they say.
The phrase "in history," has replaced the
period as the proper way to end sentences:
"We stand in history." "The greatest act of
jurisprudence in history." "The most awe
some moment in our history."
Nobody mentions the semen-stained
dress, of course, because, when bearing the
burden of history, no one wants to discuss
such things.

Reporters love the"in history" idea as
much as the politicians. The title "political
affairs correspondent" carries with it a cer
tain importance, an importance that is diffi
cult to maintain when all you're doing is
relaying second-hand accounts of third-rate
pornography such as the Starr Report.
"Jim, tell us, who are the people in front
of the video machine?"
"Well, Tracy, one of them will put the
video into the machine. The other will press
play."
"I see Jim. That is very historic. Now,
these videos, do you think that the President
will be using any naughty words in his testi
mony."
"Tracy, that's a good question. There has
been speculation that the President used the
word boobies.' "
"Boobies?"
"That's right. And "titties.' "
"How about 'pee-pee?'"
"Nobody here is certain whether he used
the word 'pee-pee' in his testimony. But I
was speaking to the lawyers, and they think
it'll be boobies and titties for sure."
"Jim, that is indeed historical."

"Tracy, it most certainly is."
There was a time when this whole scandal
had some bite. A man allegedly harasses a
woman. 1 farm is involved. Yet, thanks to one
taped phone call, the whole scandal sudden
ly turns to sex: grubby sex between two
mutually incompetent adults.
It is always difficult for the politicians,
inveterate harassers themselves, to under
stand what is wrong with sexual harassment.
On the subject of sex, however, they have an
easy and fluent hypocrisy crafted over the
course of their careers. They all start squab
bling over the Starr Report like boarding
school boys bickering over who gets to hold
the porn mag while everybody looks at it.
So after all the videos, and reports, and
inquiries, having felt the burden of history,
having weighed all the pros and cons, having
wrestled with all the legal issues, the
Democrats vote for Democrats, the Republi
cans vote for Republicans, and they all run
out saying what a difficult decision it was.
"It was a horrible, terrible decision to
have to make," they all say. "But, in the end,
I decided that my best interests were, in tact,
in rnv best interests."

History is made. Gingrich resigns. History
continues.
And meanwhile, the president seems to
spend his entire day roaming around his gar
den in front of photographers with his hand
in his wife's hand, her hand in the dog's hand,
the dog's hand in the daughter's hand, all of
them looking more like convicts handcuffed
together than a family at peace with itself.
And just when you think you know what's
going on, who rolls in on his wheelchair for
the fourth act but Larry Flynt. Larry Flynt!
"Hello everyone," says Mr. Flynt.
"It was a youthful indiscretion, it's not my
baby, and, besides, 1 repent." the congress
people all reply in unison. "Me too. I repent
as well," they all say again, just to be sure.
And meanwhile, as the trial begins, the
Senators are bored with hearing about tech
nical legal points and original intentions. As
Friday's San Francisco Chronicle put it.
they're calling for Lewinsky. Calling for her
the same way that bachelors at a stag party
call for the stripper. "Lewinksy! Lewinsky!
We want Lewinsky!" scream the Republi
cans, banging on the desk with such energy
that their ties flap above their shoulders.

Trent Lott steps out in a pink tuxedo, a
glittering bow tie. "Now, what you've all
been waiting for"He can't even finish,
because the catcalls and roars drown out
everything except the person who has just
stepped on stage: Here she is. La Lewinsky!
"This, truly, is the Whore of Babylon,"
mutters one senator, as he struggles with
other senators to try and get to the front and
slip a dollar bill into her underwear.
So history continues
And then along comes a wrestler who
becomes governor of his state, and my faith
in democracy is restored. Governor "Body":
marvelous. Anybody, even Jesse Ventura,
can become governor. That is what democra
cy means.
These impeachment hearings, however,
are a bipartisan triumph of self-importance
over dignity. It is a farce made to look like
tragedy, and neither the politicians nor the
journalists dare admit it. This is their desper
ate attempt to be carved out of marble while
thev deal in filth.

So after all the videos, and reports, and
inquiries, having felt the burden of history,
having weighed all the pros and cons, having
wrestled with all the legal issues, the
Democrats vote for Democrats, the Republi
cans vote for Republicans, and they all run
out saying what a difficult decision it was.
"It was a horrible, terrible decision to
have to make," they all say. "But, in the end,
I decided that my best interests were, in tact,
in rnv best interests."

History is made. Gingrich resigns. History
continues.
And meanwhile, the president seems to
spend his entire day roaming around his gar
den in front of photographers with his hand
in his wife's hand, her hand in the dog's hand,
the dog's hand in the daughter's hand, all of
them looking more like convicts handcuffed
together than a family at peace with itself.
And just when you think you know what's
going on, who rolls in on his wheelchair for
the fourth act but Larry Flynt. Larry Flynt!
"Hello everyone," says Mr. Flynt.
"It was a youthful indiscretion, it's not my
baby, and, besides, 1 repent." the congress
people all reply in unison. "Me too. I repent
as well," they all say again, just to be sure.
And meanwhile, as the trial begins, the
Senators are bored with hearing about tech
nical legal points and original intentions. As
Friday's San Francisco Chronicle put it.
they're calling for Lewinsky. Calling for her
the same way that bachelors at a stag party
call for the stripper. "Lewinksy! Lewinsky!
We want Lewinsky!" scream the Republi
cans, banging on the desk with such energy
that their ties flap above their shoulders.

Trent Lott steps out in a pink tuxedo, a
glittering bow tie. "Now, what you've all
been waiting for"He can't even finish,
because the catcalls and roars drown out
everything except the person who has just
stepped on stage: Here she is. La Lewinsky!
"This, truly, is the Whore of Babylon,"
mutters one senator, as he struggles with
other senators to try and get to the front and
slip a dollar bill into her underwear.
So history continues
And then along comes a wrestler who
becomes governor of his state, and my faith
in democracy is restored. Governor "Body":
marvelous. Anybody, even Jesse Ventura,
can become governor. That is what democra
cy means.
These impeachment hearings, however,
are a bipartisan triumph of self-importance
over dignity. It is a farce made to look like
tragedy, and neither the politicians nor the
journalists dare admit it. This is their desper
ate attempt to be carved out of marble while
thev deal in filth.
