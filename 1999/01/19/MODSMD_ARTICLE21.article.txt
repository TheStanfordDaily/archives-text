Atter an unnecessarily hard foul
by UCLA guard Baron Davis with
less than two seconds remaining,
Arthur Lee did something that the
Bruin faithfull simply could not tol
erate — he extended his arm to
shake hands with Davis, who seemed
more in the mood to fight than to
shake hands. ITie UCLA student
section responded by hurling a full
cup of coffee onto the floor, staining
more than just the Pauley hardwood.
But even the embarrassing reac
tion of the UCLA fans at game's end
couldn't hide the obvious reality of
Stanford's domination.
" They came out and exposed us
tonight," said UCLA guard Earl
Watson. "There's nothing more to

say. They killed us. Beat us. Whatev

Stanford (15-2,5-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has now won 11 straight
games, and five of the last seven from
No. 13 UCLA (12-4,4-2), which now
trails the Cardinal by two games in
the Pac-10.
Stanford's 14 first-half turnovers
limited the Cardinal's ability to pull
away early and Mike Montgomery's
squad headed to the locker room
ahead by only six. 33-27.
The first eight minutes of the sec
ond half were an absolute nightmare
for Stanford. The poor inbounds
pass to open the second stanza was a
harbinger of things soon to come.
The ( ardinai was unable to take care
of the ball and the Bruins capitalized
on repeated turnovers.
In particular, UCLA freshman
center Dan Gadzuric seemed to
solve the Stanford interior defense.
Everything was falling for the 6-foot
-10 center, including a rim-shaking
dunk over Mark Madsen. which put
UCLA up 47-42 with 12:13 remain
ing in the game.
"Gadzuric, the guy's an animal,"
Madsen said. "He's a beast. His post
moves may be a little raw, but he
scored on me a few times."
With his team struggling to con
trol Gadzuric, Montgomery made a
move that changed the complexity of
the remaining 12 minutes — he

zone.
"We're a straight man-to-man
team, but coach thought we could re
ally change the tempo by going to a
zone defense," said Peter Sauer. "We
knew UCLA was having trouble with
the zone and with their outside shoot
ing."
The calculated risk placed the bur
den on UCLA's perimeter shooting,
and the Bruin guards were unable to
answer the challenge.
The zone triggered a stretch of

seven minutes and 15 seconds in
which the Bruins did not score a field
goal and both UCLA big men.
Gad/uric and Jerome Moiso, were
disqualified with five fouls.
"Gad/uric was really hurting us in
isolation and we decided to go to the
zone," Montgomery said. "We've
seen them struggle in other games
against the zone and decided to give it
a shot."
UCLA's foul trouble and the Car
dinal's free-throw shooting allowed
Stanford to overcome 25 turnovers
and intense Bruin pressure.
With Gadzuric and Moiso on the
bench. Tim Young, who played the

last eight minutes with his fourth foul,
along with Madsen, dominated in the
paint and on the defensive glass.
The Cardinal was 32 of 49 from
the free-throw line, including three
by Lee after the Stanford floor leader
was fouled by Watson beyond the
arc. UCLA, on the other hand, made
just six foul shots.
All five players in Stanford's start
ing five — Madsen, Sauer, Lee,
Young and Kris Weems — scored in
double figures. Madsen led the way
with 16 and Lee poured in 14 in his re
turn home to LA.
The quintet is now 36-5 over the
last two seasons as starters.

With the wins in Los Angeles,
many observers are beginning to
wonder if this Cardinal team can go
undefeated in the Pac-10.
And while it is clearly way too
early for such speculation, the ques
tion does beg an answer.
"It doesn't get tougher than that
game," Montgomery said. "I feel
pretty good about this. I think teams
could potentially play better than
UCLA did, but I don't know if there
will be a tougher environment, with
all the stuff that went on. Somebody
might make more shots, but it's tough
to imagine one much tougher from a
peripheral standpoint."

ing five — Madsen, Sauer, Lee,
Young and Kris Weems — scored in
double figures. Madsen led the way
with 16 and Lee poured in 14 in his re
turn home to LA.
The quintet is now 36-5 over the
last two seasons as starters.

With the wins in Los Angeles,
many observers are beginning to

undefeated in the Pac-10.

early for such speculation, the ques
tion does beg an answer.
"It doesn't get tougher than that
game," Montgomery said. "I feel
pretty good about this. I think teams
could potentially play better than
UCLA did, but I don't know if there
will be a tougher environment, with
all the stuff that went on. Somebody
might make more shots, but it's tough
to imagine one much tougher from a
peripheral standpoint."
