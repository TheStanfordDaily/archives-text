# Just a bit outside
## Needing to grow up

LOS ANGELES â€” The yellow let
ters engulfed in the blue circle at
center court had been witness to 34
seasons worth of Bruin basketball
games and had withstood the
stomping feet of Lew Alcindor, Bill
Walton and many other basketball
legends.
And now, they were covered in
coffee.

I couldn't see former UCLA
head coach John Wooden, the
"Wizard of Westwood" from my
seat on press row, hut he couldn't
have been smiling.
Note to UCLA's student body:
You don't destroy a shrine.
There are 11 national champi
onship banners hanging from the
rafters of Pauley Pavilion, none of
which was won by any members of
the current UCLA team. Every
body down there needs to deflate
their egos and grow up a bit.
With just over two seconds to
play in Saturday night's contest be
tween Stanford and UCLA, the
Bruins' sophomore point guard

Baron Davis wrapped his arm
around Arthur Lee and made a hard
foul.
Two seconds left, an intense
game, hard fouls are bound to hap
pen. This is no great surprise.
One problem, however: the Bru
ins trailed by 13 points.
Still. Davis is a leader for the Bru
ins. a magnificent basketball player,
and an intense one at that. It is un
derstandable. then, that he was very
fired up despite the fact that a loss
for the Bruins was inevitable at this
point.
But when Lee went to shake his
hand and Davis replied with a stare
that would turn the Pillsbury
Doughboy to stone, things began to
get out of hand.
Davis approached, wanting to
fight. Lee wanted to say that he un
derstood the intensity. And the stu
dent section wanted to get rid of
their Starbucks espressos.
The fans started chucking every
thing from quarters to coffee, forc
ing police to surround the court and
the officials to call the game with
seven-tenths of a second remaining,
something that has not happened in
Maples Pavilion despite the leg
endary Sixth Man Club.
"1 left with a sour taste in my
mouth." Stanford's Mark Madsen
said. "It's uncomfortable. We have a
lot of respect for UCLA."
