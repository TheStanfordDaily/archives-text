# Just a bit outside
## Needing to grow up

LOS ANGELES â€” The yellow let
ters engulfed in the blue circle at
center court had been witness to 34
seasons worth of Bruin basketball
games and had withstood the
stomping feet of Lew Alcindor, Bill
Walton and many other basketball
legends.
And now, they were covered in
coffee.

I couldn't see former UCLA
head coach John Wooden, the
"Wizard of Westwood" from my
seat on press row, hut he couldn't
have been smiling.
Note to UCLA's student body:
You don't destroy a shrine.
There are 11 national champi
onship banners hanging from the
rafters of Pauley Pavilion, none of
which was won by any members of
the current UCLA team. Every
body down there needs to deflate
their egos and grow up a bit.
With just over two seconds to
play in Saturday night's contest be
tween Stanford and UCLA, the
Bruins' sophomore point guard

Baron Davis wrapped his arm
around Arthur Lee and made a hard
foul.
Two seconds left, an intense
game, hard fouls are bound to hap
pen. This is no great surprise.
One problem, however: the Bru
ins trailed by 13 points.
Still. Davis is a leader for the Bru
ins. a magnificent basketball player,
and an intense one at that. It is un
derstandable. then, that he was very
fired up despite the fact that a loss
for the Bruins was inevitable at this
point.
But when Lee went to shake his
hand and Davis replied with a stare
that would turn the Pillsbury
Doughboy to stone, things began to
get out of hand.
Davis approached, wanting to
fight. Lee wanted to say that he un
derstood the intensity. And the stu
dent section wanted to get rid of
their Starbucks espressos.
The fans started chucking every
thing from quarters to coffee, forc
ing police to surround the court and
the officials to call the game with
seven-tenths of a second remaining,
something that has not happened in
Maples Pavilion despite the leg
endary Sixth Man Club.
"1 left with a sour taste in my
mouth." Stanford's Mark Madsen
said. "It's uncomfortable. We have a
lot of respect for UCLA."

So did I.
Here is a university that basically
shaped college basketball as it is
today. Pauley is legendary. The Bru
ins are legendary. Stepping onto that
court for the first time is a thrill for
each and every Stanford basketball
player. And yet, Saturday, I lost some
respect for the place.
"It's completely classless and

ridiculous," said Cardinal guard
Arthur Lee. "It's uncalled-for."
After being taunted the entire
game, Lee, along with sophomore
Jarron Collins, turned towards
UCLA's student section and glared.
They had won the ballgame, they had
ignored a loud student section that
makes college basketball the glorious
game that it is, and they let UCLA
know it.
The student section didn't like
that one bit.
"They were like little kids," Jarron

Collins said after the trash was
heaved onto the court."It shouldn't
he tolerated."
But the UCLA-Stanford rivalry
has been cranked up a notch.! his ag
gressive game between two teams
that obviously wanted to win badly
will be even more intense next month
when they meet again.
"They don't like us, we don't like
them, but that's the nature of the
beast. It's fun," Lee said.
"Sometimes you do things with
out even thinking," he explained of

Davis' desire to fight.
After the game, Lee found Davis
and talked to him. 1 ie made sure the
sophomore Bruin was no longer
upset and that there were no grudges
being held, even though it was Davis
who had fouled Lee.
It doesn't sound to me like Lee
does things without thinking.

Sports editor Brian Eule, w hose week
ly columns appear every I uesday, tries
to think every now and then. Really, he
does.
