# UCLA snaps streak, 80-72
## 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff with AP Wire reports 
UCLA's 80-72 win against the
women's basketball team (7-9. 3-2
Pacific 10 Conference) was more
than just a setback for the Cardinal
in terms of the league title race and
postseason positioning.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Saturday: No. 10 UCLA (14-4
overall. 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
80, Stanford (7-9.3-2) 72.

It was proof of a harsh new reali
ty-
Stanford. which had dominated
the Pac-10 for over a decade, was
shown that it wasn't at the top of the
conference's pecking order.
The No. 10 Bruins (14-4. 6-0)

now hold that title, and it laid any
doubt of that fact to rest by snapping
the Cardinal's streak of 67 consecu
tive Pac-10 wins in Maples Pavilion
on Saturday.
This obviously isn't the same
Cardinal team that has been so
dominant in recent years, of that
there is no question. But Saturday
UCLA finally got the chance to
come in and solidify its stake at the
head of the conference.
And it was a long time coming
for the Bruins.
Stanford had won the previous
nine conference meetings, and 20 ol
24 in Pac-10 play. Bruin head coach
Kathy Olivier debuted against the
Cardinal with a victory in 1994. but
had no such luck since then.
Until yesterday, that is.
"They've got so much tradition.

the streak, the crowd." Olivier said.
"()ur team stayed together, showed
poise and ended updoing the job."
And in the process the Bruin se
niors finally got the Cardinal mon
key off their backs.
"It was our turn." said UCLA
point guard Erica Come/. "We
were more experienced, we had a
lot of players coming back and after
coming up here for the last three
years and getting beat, it was like.
I inally"
But Stanford wouldn't go down
easily.
Despite falling behind early, the
C ardinal was able to string together
a strong run even though leading
scorer L.indsey Yamasaki con
tributed only two points in the first
half. Back-to-back three pointers by
senior Regan Freuen and junior
Milena Flores at the end of the peri
od gave Stanford a 30-27 lead at the
intermission.
But UCLA's veteran starting
lineup proved to be too well bal
anced for Stanford. The Bruins' first
five all scored in double digits and
accounted for 70 of the team's
points.
Yamasaki did catch on in the sec
ond half, ending the night with 21
points, but 12 of those came in the
final five minutes as the Cardinal
tried to play catch-up.
The Cardinal also got strong per
formances from Sarah Dimson,
who scored 13 points, and Bethany
Donaphin, who contributed a dou
ble-double with 11 points and 12 re
bounds.
Stanford managed to pull to
within three points on a Yamasaki
basket with 4:41 remaining, but the
Bruins pulled away for good with
consecutive scores.
The Cardinal didn't help itself
much as it turned the ball over a sea
son-high 27 times. The Bruins capi
talized on Stanford's 14 second-half
giveaways by converting them into
17 points.
"Those turnovers absolutely
cooked us," said Cardinal coach

Tara VanDerveer. "They made key
fast-break baskets in the transition,
got it deep into their post players
and finished. Their experienced
post players took it to our semi-ex
perienced post players.
UCLA senior center Maylana
Martin led the Bruins with 20 points
and seven rebounds, and shooting
guard Lacresha Flannigan chipped
in 15, including 11 in the second
half.
"We seemed to answer all of
their runs," Olivier said. "Our play
ers feel like they've paid their dues.
We're 6-0 in the Pac-10 and that's all
that really matters."
The Cardinal now sits two and a
half games behind the Bruins in the
conference standings, and faces a
key road trip next weekend as it
travels to Washington and Wash
ington State.
The game against the Huskies
will be the crucial match for the Car
dinal, as Washington sits with Ore
gon in a tie for second in the confer
ence, one game above Stanford.
And as foreign as the concept of
someone besides Tara Van-
Derveer's club winning the Pac-10
crown might be, a more ominous
and equally possible scenario might
have the Cardinal failing to qualify
for the postseason altogether. The
Cardinal now has to worry more
about getting the important confer
ence wins it needs to even qualify for
the NCAA tournament in March.
