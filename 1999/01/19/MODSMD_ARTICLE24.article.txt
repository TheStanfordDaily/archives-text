# Stanford's top swimming program to meet Pacific
## Warming up in '99 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
Although the Stanford men's
swimming team has been working
and training hard, it is just gearing up
tor the real tests of 1999 — competi
tion.

■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (4-0) vs. Pa
cific 2 p.m.. deGuerre Pool.

But the Cardinal will get another
break before getting into the meat of
its season. Today, the men will take
on the Pacific Tigers at deGuerre
pool. Pacific is an unranked team, so
No. 1 Stanford will have an easy meet
before facing some more formidable

challenges.
"This meet gives us a good oppor
tunity to get back up to the blocks and
race." said senior co-captain Dod
Wales. "It will be a good confidence
booster if people swim well."
Swimming against Pacific, the
Cardinal (4-0) will attempt to contin
ue its winning streak from 1998. With
so much time elapsed between com
petitions. the team has had a lot of
time to make changes and continue
building on its strengths.
The Tigers (9-2) finished fifth out
of five teams in the Big West Confer
ence last season, but have a group of
strong freshmen and transfer stu
dents who will hopefully allow them
to be a challenge to the Cardinal.
Before going into the Pacific-10

Championships and NCAA Cham
pionships to defend its titles, Stanford
must go up against swimming power
houses sueh as Arizona, Arizona
State and IJSC.
"We haven't swum since the [dou
ble-distance meet against California]
and we want to get a chance to race
and be ready for Arizona," said ju
nior Kurt Spenser. "It is hard to know
where you're at when you haven't
swum in two months."
The one drawback on the Stan
ford season is that reigning NCAA
200-butterfly champion senior
Matthew Pierce is out for the rest of
the season. Pierce had shoulder
surgery after Stanford's last meet and
will not be able to compete again
with the Cardinal. This will put a
strain on Stanford's strong lineup,
stripping it of one more of its return
ing NCAA competitors, making it
just a little more difficult to retain last
year's championship.
"We have a deep and talented
team. Pierce will be sorely missed.
You can't fill the place of NCAA
champion," Spenser said. "24 guys
will just have to work that much
harder."
But. despite Pierce's absence in
the Cardinal lineup, Stanford still
continues to be the strongest colle
giate swim team. The men have been
working on stroke technique, sprint
ing, speed work and what they often
call "the little things," such as starts,
turns and other nuances to racing.
A win against Pacific will give
Stanford a glimpse at what its hard
work has accomplished, but will not
necessarily be a measure of what
needs to be improved upon because
it will be a different lineup than
usual.
"The meet will have a different
atmosphere than Arizona because
[ Pacific] is not as competitive.
"Arizona will give us more of a
chance to gauge where we are,"
Wales said.
