I his holiday weekend, it was business as
usual for the Stanford men's volleyball team
(2-0). which defeated Loyola Marymount
Lions (0-2) in two matches, despite lacking
some team energy.
"Although I'm glad that we got the job
done. I was hoping we would play with more
spirit and emotion." said Cardinal head
coach Ruben Nieves.

■ Saturday: Stanlord (2-0) defeated Loyola
Marymount (0-2), 15-10, 15-7. 15-4.
■ Friday: Stanford defeated Loyola Mary
mount. 7-15. 10-15. 15-4.15-13,15-9.

I he Cardinal gradually established mo
mentum as the weekend progressed, defeat
ing the Lions 7-15,10-15.15-4.15-13,15-9 on
Friday night and 15-10. 15-7. 15-4 Saturday
night at Burnhain Pavilion.
"We are just starting to form team eheni
istiy. ' sophomore middle bloeker Brett
Youngberg said. "As the season progresses,
we will play even better as a team."
I hese lust regular-season niatehes pro
vide a barometer for the ways in which the
( ardinal can develop as the season progress
es. Although both Stanford and Loyola com
pete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. these games cannot affect either
school's conference standing and are the

final preparation before conference compe
tition begins later this week.
The play of four Stanford players, captain
Jeremy Bart, senior Josh Palacios and sopho
mores Dan Zhang and Brett Youngberg. as
suaged any doubts regarding the pool of tal
ent at the middle blocker position for the
Cardinal.
The Stanford team defense, which com
bined for IS blocks on Friday night and 13
blocks on Saturday night, provided the criti
cal advantage in the Cardinal's victories.
"The biggest difference between the
teams was the play of the middle blockers,"
Nieves said. "It was a very pleasant surprise
to me."
Nieves varied the starting players at this
position throughout the weekend.
"Although I started the lineup that I
thought would be the strongest, the group
that finished had more success." Nieves said.
While the Cardinal had to overcome a
two-game deficit on Friday night, on Satur
day night Loyola failed to challenge a rejuve
nated Stanford team.
A critical factor in the blockers' improved
performance in the second game was the
C ardinal's Saturday-morning analysis of Fri
day's game. Although Stanford prepared for
Friday's game by studying the individual
playing tendencies of Loyola players, for Sat
urday's game the Cardinal analyzed Loyola
rotation by rotation.
"Our blocking improved tonight." /.hang
said after Saturday's win. "Before, we
weren't familiar with their system. Today's

scouting report helped a lot."
Another essential contribution to the
Cardinal victory was the play of sophomore
setter Brad Griffith. Griffith not only started
the match for the Cardinal, but also under
took a leadership role through his spirited
on-court dynamics.
Absent from the Cardinal's Saturday
night line-up was freshman outside hitter
Marcus Skacel. Skacel, who contributed in
all five games Friday night, rested a stress
fracture in his back on Saturday.
Aside from starting different players, a
slow start on Friday also distinguished the
two games.
After falling behind 0-9 in the first game,
Stanford substituted Griffith into the game.
Just like his play on Saturday. Griffith pro
vided momentum for the Cardinal and
helped the team reverse its sluggish start.
"Once we brought Brad into the game, he
helped stop the bleeding." Nieves said.
"He got the momentum going and the
played stronger and stronger as the match
went on."
As the Cardinal prepares for the start of
MPSF competition against the Brigham
Young Cougars on .Jan. 23. uncertainty aris
es regarding Stanford's starting lineup.
Only three of the players who started Fri
day's match returned to starting positions in
the second match.
The solid performances of three sopho
mores this weekend. Griffith, Zhang, and
Youngberg. will inevitably affect their play
ing time later in the season.
