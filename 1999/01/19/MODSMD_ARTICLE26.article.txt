### Marie Sotelo 
Leon Panetta, White House chief
of staff from 1994 to 1997, was on
campus Friday evening to share his
insight on current legislative trends
with political scholars attending the
History of Congress Conference.
Panetta addressed the attendees
at a Friday night banquet held at the
Schwab Center. He expressed his
hopes that a younger generation
would be inspired to partake in pub
lic service.
"The consequences of the im
peachment process and the general
state of politics are discouraging a
younger generation of Americans
from public service," Panetta said.
Panetta also examined the past
three decades of American politics,
pulling them in the context of his
personal experiences.
He first praised the '60s as a
decade of "strong personalities and
powerful issues" and as a time of bi
partisan cooperation in Congress.
"They were prepared to roll up their
sleeves and work together in the na
tional interest," he said.
Scandals of the '70s, such as Wa
tergate and the fallout from Viet
nam, led to a diffusion of power and
the rise of caucuses, according to

Panetta. A "return to stability" in
the following decade created "the
public's love of a divided Congress"
brought together by a powerful and
popular president, he said.
Panetta contrasted this with "the
politics of personal destruction" that
he said now reign in government.
"1 think we will see a period of
weakened presidencies as a result of
the impeachment," warned Panetta.
"The '90s will be marked by per
sonal attack and partisan politics,"
which have, according to him, "seri
ously eroded and weakened leader
ship in the presidency and Con
gress." Panetta pointed out several
factors currently influencing power
in Congress.
"The presidency and Congress
know how to spin the media," he
said. Advances in media technology
allow for "a short hit on your politi
cal opponent," he pointed out.
Panetta cited other strong influ
ences on our current leadership, in
cluding politicians' over-reliance on
pollsters, unlimited donor contribu
tions and political messages promot
ing issues instead of solutions.
"Politicians are unwilling to take
the risks needed for positive
change," said Panetta.
He urged politicians to break out

of their distorted perspectives on
Capitol Hill and, as he exclaimed, to
"Get out!" He also suggested short
ening sessions of Congress to allow
representatives more time among
constituents.
Panetta closed with a message for
the America's youth, asking them to
engage in public service and to "re
spect and strengthen a government
by and for all people."
During the two-day conference.
Congressional scholars from around
the country examined the changing
power structure of Congress and its
implications on the future of policy
making. The conference included a
series of panel discussions and was
co-sponsored by the Social Science
History Institute at Stanford and
UC-San Diego.
Before his appointment as White
House chief of staff, Panetta served
eight lull terms as the representative
from California's 16th congressional
district. He left Congress during his
ninth term to serve as director of the
White House Office of Manage
ment and Budget.
Panetta was born in Monterey
and currently resides in Carmel Val
ley. He serves as Distinguished
Scholar to the Chancellor at Cal
State-Monterey Bay.
