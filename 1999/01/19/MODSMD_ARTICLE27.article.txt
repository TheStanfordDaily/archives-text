# Race raises $22,000 for low-income youth

### Sierra Millman 
On one day, and one day alone,
the Spirit Cup replaced the Axe as
the most coveted prize and UC-
Santa Cruz replaced Cal as Stan
ford's No. 1 rival.
Fifty Stanford students ran for
charity on Saturday, giving their
breath, sweat and spirit to College
Kids, a non-profit organization that
prepares children from low-income
communities to attend college.
Through this year's Resolution Run,
College Kids raised more than
$22,000.
The rain vanished as 500 partici
pants and observers arrived in Gold
en Gate Park on Saturday morning,
eager to race the five kilometers
around Polo Field and Park for fun
and prizes. The 15 teams included
alumni from Brown University,
Dartmouth College, Harvard Uni
versity, the University of Indiana,
Princeton University and UC-Santa
Cruz, as well as from Stanford.
Clothed in college colors and T
shirts, some of College Kids' young
participants cheered the runners,
many of whom were their mentors,
as the college students crossed the
start and finish lines.
Founded in 1994, College Kids
creates and runs college institutes,
which the organization's Web page

— www.collegekids.org — de
scribes as "community-based part
nerships." These programs serve
both students and parents, provid
ing after-school enrichment, men
toring and parenting lectures and
workshops. Located in San Mateo,
Los Angeles and San Diego, the
three existing college institutes pri
marily serve students in third, fourth
and fifth grade.
Through the annual Resolution
Run and other such events, the or
ganization hopes to create a "strate
gic plan" to expand the organiza
tion. College Kids wants to establish
50 more college institutes in the
United States over the next 20 years,
focusing on California for 10 of
those years, said founder and Exec
utive Director Kenny Rogers.
On one day this quarter Rogers
and other members of College Kids
attended Consulting Assoc. Prof.
Tom Kosnik's Industrial Engineer
ing 269, where students presented
fundraising plans for the organiza
tion as a class exercise.
One engineering graduate stu
dent, Laura Pfeifer, decided to take
the class activity a step further and
joined her professor — who also sits
on the program's board of directors
— and other Stanford runners in
Golden Gate Park. A running fan,
but not a fanatic — the Resolution

Run was her first race — Pfeifer said
that the event was "great," adding
that she would definitely do it again.
When asked where they wanted to
attend college, Pfeifer reported that
a lot of the College Kids would
"change their minds every 20 min
utes," but stated that "the cool part
is that they want to go to college."
Pfeifer smiled when she saw stu
dents from UC-Santa Cruz in royal
blue capes and banana slug anten
nas. The Santa Cruz team went on to
defeat Stanford to win the Spirit
Cup.
However, Stanford business
school student, Salim Haji, placed
second among the male runners.
Although Pfeifer claimed that
this year's Stanford participants
were running for the fun, not the
prizes, she declared that Stanford
will win next year with their own
strategic plan, already in the works.
As for UC-Santa Cruz's creative
costumes, Pfeifer offered, "I could
have used a cape, but antennas
wouldn't work for Stanford."
