# The 						National Collegiate Tennis Classic
## Wolters/Hippensteel take doubles title 
### Jake Willens 
The top four players on the
men's tennis team put in a solid
performance this past weekend in
the National Collegiate Tennis
Classic in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
The team came away with a dou
bles championship and two semifi
nalists in singles.
The tournament hosted the top
eight schools in this year's rank
ings, and Stanford proved it will
once again be as tough to beat as
anyone. The Cardinal's perfor
mance will allow it to head into its
Jan. 26 opening team match with
confidence and extra experience.
In the singles draw, junior Geoff
Abrams and senior Ryan Wolters
both played well before being de
feated in the semifinals. Wolters,
the No. 1 seed in the tournament,
was defeated by UCLA's top play
er John Noelle Grinda by a score of
6-2,2-6,6-4. However, Wolters was
happy with the way he played and
glad to have had a chance to play
Grinda.
"It was a close-fought match
and came down to a few points in
the third set," Wolters said. "I had
never played Grinda before, but
now I know what to expect when I

play him later in the year. That
kind of match experience against a
top-notch player will help me head
ing into the season."
Abrams was also very pleased
with his singles play. He defeated
both the seventh seed and the third
seed before losing to USC's Ronan
Kukal by a score of 6-4, 7-6 in the
semifinals.

■ Sunday: Stanford's doubles team
of Ryan Wolters and K.J. Hippen
steel defeated USC's Nick Rainy
and Ryan More, 8-6, in the NTCT's
doubles finals.

Abrams believes he may even
have been able to beat Kukal had
he not played into Kukal's
strengths.
"1 was pleased with my two wins
leading into the Kukal match,"
Abrams said. But "against Kukal, I
allowed him to get into a rhythm by
trading ground strokes, 1 should
have mixed up my pace more and
maybe charged the net some. I
played his kind of a match, which is
why he beat me."
Kukal seemed to have Stan
ford's number as he also defeated
freshman K.J. Hippensteel 6-4,1-6,

6-4 in the quarterfinals.
Hippensteel won his first two
matches against players from
UCLA and Mississippi State, two
solid programs.
"I keep getting better with more
college experience. I had two good
wins, which showed me I can play
with almost anyone. The Kukal
match was tight. He just won the
big points, which made the differ
ence," Hippensteel said.
In the doubles bracket, Stanford
faired even better. Wolters and
Hippensteel won the tournament
and sophomore Alex Kim and
Abrams were semifinalists. This
was Wolters and Hippensteel's sec
ond title of the year, which shows
that they may be the team to beat
come NCAAs.
Wolters and Hippensteel de
feated the USC team of Nick Rainy
and Ryan Moore, 8-6, in the finals.
Wolters and Hippensteel breezed
through their first two rounds with
8-0 and 8-5 victories.
"We keep improving as a team
as we learn about one another,"
Wolters said. "We played with con
fidence, and as long as we play up
to our potential, we should be

tough to beat."
Even the 8-6 score in the finals
may have made the match seem
closer than it was. The Stanford
duo was in control throughout and
Wolters was serving at 7-4 to close
it out.
He was broken, but Hippen
steel held at 7-6 to end the match.
Kim and Abrams were not able
to get past Moore and Rainy, how
ever. They lost 7-9 in the semifi
nals to the Trojan tandem.
"We played well until the
semis," Kim said. "We were mov
ing well, playing aggressively, but
in the semis we came out a bit slow
and didn't return as well. We
weren't able to recover from our
slow start."
Cardinal assistant coach John
Whitlinger was pleased with all
four players' performances. He
thought the tournament went well
and he saw good things about how
the guys are improving with each
match.
"We're off to a good start, but,
as always, our goal is mid-May.
"Last year was one of those
dream seasons.
"This year we will have to keep
improving leading into the
NCAAs in Mav," he said.
