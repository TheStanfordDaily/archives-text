## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Until Stanford freshman Marissa
Irvin overwhelmed her in Sunday's
final of the National Collegiate Ten
nis Classic, it looked as if Califor
nia's Anita Kurimay was destined to
be a thorn in the Stanford women's
tennis team's side.
Having battled past three Cardi
nal women to take the ITA Region
al Championships in the fall. Kuri
may continued her winning streak
against the team during this tourna
ment, only to be stymied by Irvin in
the last round.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Sunday: Stanford's Marissa Irvin
defeated California's Anita Kuri
may in the finals of the NCTC, 4-6,6-
2,6-1.

Six Cardinal women— freshmen
Irvin, Keiko Tokuda and Gabby
Lastra, sophomore Sarah Pestieau,
and juniors Teryn Ashley and Jen
nifer Heiser — competed in the
NCTC, a prestigious invitational
held at the Sherwood Country Club
in Thousand Oaks, Calif, featuring
players from the nation's top eight
teams.
Lastra and Tokuda were under
the weather going into first-round
play, and both newcomers suffered
losses in their respective first-round
matches.

"I was feeling really bad." Toku
da said. "I don't know how I even
finished my first match. 1 pulled out
of the consolation bracket."
Lastra. on the other hand,
bounced back from her first-round
disappointment, a 6-2, 6-3 loss to
Annica Cooper of UCLA, and
marched through four matches to
win the consolation tournament.
Pestieau was beaten by Ann
Nguyen, 7-6 (7-0), 6-2, in the first
round. Heiser fell victim to a tough
draw, meeting Kurimay in the first
round. After keeping pace with the
Cal champion in the first set, Heiser
eventually lost control, bowing out,
7-5,6-0.
Junior captain Ashley came into
the tournament hoping to capitalize
on the confidence she gained from
her tournament victory at the Pacif
ic 10 Conference Indoor Tennis
Tournament last weekend.
Ashley, however, was stopped by
Kurimay in the semifinals of the
NCTC, 6-3,6-0.
"I was pretty happy with my per
formance until the semifinals," Ash
ley said. "Obviously, it's not the out
come that I would've wanted."
After leading in the first set. Ash
ley seemed to lose confidence in her
game as Kurimay swept past her.
"At first, it seemed that she
could've won that semifinal match
against Kurimay," Tokuda said.
Nevertheless, Ashley has shown
that she is finding her game again

after a rough fall that saw her na
tional ranking tumble several spots.
"I put a lot of pressure on myself
in the fall," Ashley said. "I was one
of the older, more experienced play
ers on the team and I wanted to set
the stage for the rest of the year."
Unfortunately, that pressure had
a problematic affect on Ashley's
mental game, an issue she feels that
she's dealing with as she gains more
confidence and match wins.
"Last weekend's tournament
win was really good for me," Ashley
said. "I competed really well. I fo
cused."
"Now, she's really showing what
her tennis potential is," Tokuda
added.
Irvin. the other star of the week
end, displaying a fierce competitive
ness that justified her top seeding.
"Marissa had a great tourna
ment," Ashley said. "She beat Cal's
Amy Jensen and UCLA's Annica
Cooper, two real solid players."
The Irvin-Kurimay final was a re
match of last fall's dramatic three
set ITA championships semifinal,
won 6-4,6-7,6-4 by Kurimay.
This time, after a nerve-wracking
first set won by Kurimay, Irvin
began finding the lines with her pen
etrating groundstrokes and leapt to
a 5-2 second-set lead. Then, Kuri
may took an injury timeout, which
reminded many onlookers of a sim
ilar timeout she took in her previous
match with Irvin.

Despite her efforts to shift the
momentum. Irvin prevailed, domi
nating the final two sets for a 4-6,6-
2,6-1 victory.
"We're definitely excited that
someone finally beat Kurimay,"
Tokuda said. "Now we know it's not
impossible to beat her. She's beaten
some of our best players, but now,
mentally, we can approach her
much better."
In fact, the team's overall out
look for the season has been
strengthened by this weekend's re
sults.
"We're very optimistic," Tokuda
said. "The door is wide open."
Ashley shares Tokuda's enthusi
asm, but remains a bit more cau
tious.
"It's going to take a little time,"
she said. "Everyone needs to be
completely healthy. The freshmen
need to get used to the dual match
es, as well."
Ashley, who partnered with Irvin
to lose in the doubles final to Cal's
Jensen and Amanda Augustus. 8-6,
explained that one of her primary
goals as captain was to encourage
the development of formidable
doubles teams.
"Our doubles needs to stay
strong," she said. "We need to stay
deep in both singles and doubles."
It seems as if the Cardinal has the
talent and drive to foster such depth
as it approaches its dual-match sea
son.

said. "I competed really well. I fo
cused."
"Now, she's really showing what
her tennis potential is," Tokuda
added.
Irvin. the other star of the week
end, displaying a fierce competitive
ness that justified her top seeding.
"Marissa had a great tourna
ment," Ashley said. "She beat Cal's
Amy Jensen and UCLA's Annica
Cooper, two real solid players."
The Irvin-Kurimay final was a re
match of last fall's dramatic three
set ITA championships semifinal,
won 6-4,6-7,6-4 by Kurimay.
This time, after a nerve-wracking
first set won by Kurimay, Irvin
began finding the lines with her pen
etrating groundstrokes and leapt to
a 5-2 second-set lead. Then, Kuri
may took an injury timeout, which
reminded many onlookers of a sim
ilar timeout she took in her previous
match with Irvin.

Despite her efforts to shift the
momentum. Irvin prevailed, domi
nating the final two sets for a 4-6,6-
2,6-1 victory.
"We're definitely excited that
someone finally beat Kurimay,"
Tokuda said. "Now we know it's not
impossible to beat her. She's beaten
some of our best players, but now,
mentally, we can approach her
much better."
In fact, the team's overall out
look for the season has been
strengthened by this weekend's re
sults.
"We're very optimistic," Tokuda
said. "The door is wide open."
Ashley shares Tokuda's enthusi
asm, but remains a bit more cau
tious.
"It's going to take a little time,"
she said. "Everyone needs to be
completely healthy. The freshmen
need to get used to the dual match
es, as well."
Ashley, who partnered with Irvin
to lose in the doubles final to Cal's
Jensen and Amanda Augustus. 8-6,
explained that one of her primary
goals as captain was to encourage
the development of formidable
doubles teams.
"Our doubles needs to stay
strong," she said. "We need to stay
deep in both singles and doubles."
It seems as if the Cardinal has the
talent and drive to foster such depth
as it approaches its dual-match sea
son.
