# Residents like one-class Toyon

Residents of Toyon Hall, the first
dormitory with a sophomore focus,
find the change to be largely positive.
This year. Toyon switched from a
four-class house to one nearly entire
ly populated by sophomores — out of
210 residents only two. discounting
staff, are juniors or seniors.
The switch, decided on last year, is
intended to address a concern that
sophomores are at a disadvantage
when it comes to school resources.
Freshmen, as the newest members
of the Stanford community, are often
bombarded with a wide variety of in
formation that is not immediately

useful. As sophomores, this informa
tion may become vital, but without
the support system that freshmen
have, sophomores may feel lost.
Thus, live-in peer advisors provide
academic support to Toyon residents,
while panels of medical students and
other guest speakers assist students
with making choices in the formative
sophomore year.
The Sophomore Speakei Series,
another Toyon program, has proven
popular with its schedule of notable
speakers. Last Ihursday. James
Montoya.the vice provost for student
affairs, drew a group of approximate
ly 25 people.
"Working with the sophomores.

who have more of an idea, a focus
|than freshmen] ... is more of just
being there for the ride, just really
fun," said junior Sarah Smith, a sec
ond-floor resident assistant in Toyon.
Senior Maia Piccagli, also a Toyon
RA. agrees that the sophomore dor
mitory reorganization has been a
beneficial one. 'There's a greater
drive among the students to meet
each other and branch out," Piccagli
said
Sophomores seem to be less set in
their wa\ s than juniors or seniors, she
said.
Transfer student Sharon
Piec/enik. a sophomore, also finds
the new focus of Toyon positive —

but for a different reason.
According to Pieczenik, about 24
of this year's 97 sophomore transfer
students live in Toy on, and, 'it's eas
ier to make friends [ with other trans
fer students]. People already have
gone through the freshman bonding
experience, and don't want to make
new friends."
However, there are those who see
the change as less pointed. Sopho
more Jenny Marshall views the dif
ference as merely a shift from living in
a quiet hall to a noisy hall. She previ
ously lived in Roble Hall and there
fore is quite familiar with the large
