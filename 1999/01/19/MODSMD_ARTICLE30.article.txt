## 
### Ramona Shelburne Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (1-1) found out what big
time college gymnastics was all
about last Friday night in Salt Lake
City.
The Cardinal had entered both
the season and its competition with
Utah (1-0) brimming with confi
dence and optimism.
It left the gymnasium with a com
pletely different set of feelings late
Friday night after falling to the Utes
by a hefty 196.050-192.570 margin.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: Utah (1-0) defeated Stan
ford (1-1).

Frustration, disappointment,
and even anger to name a few.
And it didn't help that the offici
ating was controversial to say the
least.
"I don't want to take anything
away from Utah. They're a very
good team," said second-year head
coach Mark Cook. "But we don't
feel that Utah is that much better
than us, definitely not four points
better. The officiating was parti
san."
Coming into last Friday night's
competition, the No. 7 Cardinal felt
that it could hang with the No. 4
ranked Utes and stood a good
chance of upsetting one of the most
successful programs in college gym
nastics history.
While the Cardinal may have the
talent to compete with such a pow
erhouse as Utah in the future, it was
quickly apparent who the superior
team was on Friday night.
The win was the second highest
opening match total ever for the
Utes, who swept the top three places
in the all-around competition and
captured event titles in three of the
four events.
The lone bright spot for the Car

dinal was sophomore Jenny Wil
son's victory in the vaulting compe
tition with a score of 9.825. Junior
Larissa Fontaine finished in a tie for
second place in the vault with a
9.800.
Leading the attack for the Utes
was freshman sensation Theresa
Kulikowski who set a school record
en route to winning the all-around
competition with a score of 39.400.
Kulikowski also captured event ti
tles on the bars with a 9.90, the bal
ance beam (9.85) and the floor exer
cise with a score of 9.925. While the
meet was Kulikowski's first ever
collegiate competition, as a former
United States National Team mem
ber, Kulikowski is not lacking in
high-level experience.
Also heading the Utah squad
was freshman Deidra Graham, who
ended her first ever collegiate meet
with second-place honors on both
the bars (9.850) and the floor exer
cise with score of 9.900.
Though the defeat may have
been a hard pill for the Cardinal to
swallow, in the long run, it may
make it a better team and help Stan
ford to succeed at the national
championships, held at the John M.
Huntsman Center on the Utah cam
pus in April.
"It was definitely a little frustrat
ing not to win," said junior Larissa
Fontaine. "But it was really a good
opportunity for us to be able to com
pete in their arena, in front of their
fans since that's where nationals are
going to be held."
The Cardinal will look to re
bound this Friday against Califor
nia.
"We are really trying to learn
from this [past] meet," added Cook.
"11 anything, I think it's going to
help us because we're working hard
to prove that we should be getting
the scores that we deserve."
Next Friday's start time is sched
uled for 7:30 p.m. at the Recreation
al Sports Facility in Berkeley.
