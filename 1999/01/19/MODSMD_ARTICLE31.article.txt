## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestlers turned in
a great performance at last week
end's Aggie Open held at UC-
Davis. Since it was an open tourna
ment, there were no team scores
kept, but the Cardinal placed six of
its members in an impressive show
ing against eight California teams
along with teams from Oregon and
strong junior college programs.
Leading the way for Stanford
were junior captain Zach Zimmerer
(133 lbs.) and senior captain Beau
Weiner (157), who both took first
place in commanding fashion.
"Zimmerer and Weiner had out
standing performances," said se
nior Shane Cross (174). "Both were
extremely confident and explosive
during the weekend's competi
tion."
Zimmerer has not lost a match
since the Midlands Tournament
held at Northwestern on Dec. 29-30.
He won his last three dual matches
against UC-Davis, Kut/town and
Harvard, and looked strong going
into the tournament.

Zimmerer dominated the open
ing rounds and posted pins in each
of his first three matches.
In the finals, Zimmerer faced
UC-Davis senior David Yi, whom
he had defeated 8-0 in the dual meet
on Jan 9.

The match was never very close
and Zimmerer, in a similar style to
the earlier meeting, was able to con
trol Yi through excellent take
downs. Zimmerer went on to win 9-
3 to take his second title of the year.
Earlier in the season, he also took
first place at the California Open on
Nov. 14.
"Zacli pretty much dominated
all day," Weiner said. "He just over
powered everybody."
Weiner continued his own win
ning streak, which includes the last
three dual meets, by also grabbing
an individual title. One of the most
important matches for Weiner was
in the semifinals when he faced San

Francisco State junior Josh Wheel
er. Wheeler had defeated Weiner 6-
4 in sudden-death overtime earlier
in the Cardinal-Gators dual on Nov.
24.
This time, Weiner controlled the
whole match, winning by technical
fall over Wheeler to advance to the
finals.
"1 felt good in my semifinal
match and it was great to win by
technical fall against Wheeler,"
Weiner said.
In the finals, Weiner faced a
tough match in Fresno State's Tim
Cornish. The two made for a great
final, battling until Weiner came out
on top, 7-6.
"I wrestled solid in the finals and
it felt good to pull out the win, "
Weiner said.
Junior Rudy Ruiz (125) also had
a solid tournament taking home a
third-place finish. In the third-place
match, Ruiz was matched against
John Fasano of Portland State.
The match went back and forth
but Ruiz managed a 4-1 win. Ruiz
showed good intensity and definite
ly rode the momentum from his last
two victories against UC-Davis and

Kutztown.
Juniors Frank Ruiz (149) and
Tim Kendall (184) both were able to
come away with fifth-place finishes
for the Cardinal. Both wrestled well
all tournament, coming off their re
spective victories in the Kutztown
dual.
Ruiz defeated Mauricio Mora, 6-
3, in his fifth-place match and is
showing improvement on his per
formances earlier in the year.
Kendall has also been coming on
strong as of late, and is definitely
showing a raised level of intensity
and will to win. Kendall needed
everything he had to hold off Port
land State's Lonnie Eggert in the
fifth-place match to come out with a
3-2 win.
Redshirt freshman Rohner Seg
nitz also placed in the Aggie Open,
taking sixth place at 197 lbs.
"I think the whole team had a lot
of momentum after our last two
dual meet wins and we wrestled
with good intensity and focus for the
most part," Weiner said. "Our fight
ing spirit was up a notch from earli
er in the season."
The Card's next meet is on Jan. 23.
