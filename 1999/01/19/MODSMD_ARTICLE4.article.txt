# Rash of thefts at 680 Lomita
## 
### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Residents of 680 Lomita — the
lormer Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house — in addition to facing the
usual beginning of the quarter
chaos, had to deal with thefts and
vandalism as they settled into the
new year.
During the first week of the
quarter, according to members of
the 680 Lomita house staff, all of
the house's silverware, the chef's
cooking utensils, a microwave,
boxes of produce and food from
the open kitchen and a couch were
taken from the residence. In addi
tion on the morning of Jan. 8, resi
dents woke up to discover that
their porches had been egged and
their toilet seats were covered with
toothpaste.
The University evicted the Phi
Delts at the end of last quarter

after determining that the fraterni
ty had violated probation sanc
tions. At the beginning of this
quarter, the house was filled with
students returning from overseas
and others who participated in the
fall Draw.
In addition, on one occasion
during the first week of the quarter
two Phi Delts entered the house
and harassed several of its new res
idents. according to senior Alice
Ohgi, 680 Lomita resident assis
tant.
"They didn't take anything or
hurt anyone," Ohgi said.
Seeing the Phi Delts in the
house has led many residents to
suspect that members of the frater
nity were responsible for the thefts,
according to house manager Josh
Uri, a senior.
"I wouldn't want to say for sure
that it was them," Uri said. " The
first night we noticed stuff missing
people saw Phi Delts in the house.
It's circumstantial evidence, hut
that's why people think it was the
Phi Delts."
Phi Delt fraternity members
deny having anything to do with
the thefts. Fraternity president
Jackson Wagener called the accu
sations "ridiculous."
"As far as I know, it wasn't any
Phi Delts," he said.
Insurance will cover the costs of
replacing the stolen items and the
University rekeyed the outside
doors in an attempt to prevent fu
ture incidents. The house staff has
asked residents to keep the doors
locked and remain vigilant of visi
tors to the residence.
Members of the house staff filed
a police report after the items were
stolen and say they hope that noth

ing more will happen throughout
the quarter.
"As kitchen manager it was a
pain regardless of who is taking the
stuff," said junior Sarah Thomp
son.
"I think around 85 percent of
our house was overseas last quar

ter, including myself, and this is an
unnecessary hassle. A lot of people
in the house are pointing fingers at
the Phi Delts. It's true that we are
in their house, and 1 can see why
people might think that, but I don't
want to make accusations. It could
have been anyone," she said.
