# Thief returns skull by mail
## Ohlone bones in police custody 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
A 3,000-year-old skull of an
Ohlone Indian child was anony
mously mailed to the Stanford An
thropology Department recently,
more than 25 years after it was origi
nally stolen from its burial site.
The Stanford police were contact
ed by the department and are cur
rently in possession of the skull.
"It was mailed in a box to the de
partment. They in turn contacted
(the police] when they realized the
box held human remains," said Stan
ford police Sergeant Hilary Karp.
The San Francisco Chronicle re
ported that a note mailed with the
skull said the skull had been taken
from an Ohlone grave unearthed
during the 1970 construction of a
condominium in Los Altos.
The final fate of the skull has not
been determined.
"It is sort of a complicated situa
tion," Karp said. "The County Coro
ner has notified the Native American
Commission. They contact the tribal
representative. The tribal represen
tative and the campus archaeologist
determine the final resting place for
the remains."
In determining the appropriate

resting place for the skull, Stanford
will revisit a historic controversy. In
June 1990. Stanford turned over the
remains of approximately 500
Ohlone Indians to tribal representa
tives. The remains had been stored in
the Stanford Art Museum or had
been on loan to San Jose State Uni
versity. The decision to return the
bones sparked controversy over the
use of Native American bones for
academic study, rather than follow
ing Stanford's lead by returning them
to tribal representatives.
The police will not seek the
anonymous sender of the skull.
Because of the length of time after
the initial theft, even if the identity of
the skull's sender was discovered, it is
unlikely that the sender could be
charged with a crime.
Karp said that there is a felony
crime associated with the removal of
artifacts from sites.
However, he believes that the
statute of limitations has expired for
the crime.
"[The crime] occurred 26 or 27
years ago. Typically the statutes of
limitations lasts about three years."
According to Karp, this return of
stolen bones is not an isolated inci
dent. "It happens frequently," on the
Stanford campus, he said.
