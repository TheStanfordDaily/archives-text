Cigarette smoking on college campuses
has increased nationwide among all stu
dent demographic groups according to in
formation obtained by the Harvard School
of Public Health's College Alcohol Study.
While Stanford's smoking rate is not as
high as that of other schools, the self-re
ported smoking rate at Stanford has risen
over the last four years.
The study, published in the Nov. 18
Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion, examined changes in cigarette smok
ing among different types of college stu
dents and colleges between 1993 and 1997.
Using data from 116 nationally repre

sentative four-year colleges, with a total of
15.103 randomly selected students in 1993
and 14,251 randomly selected students in
1997. the researchers found that between
1993 and 1997 the prevalence of current
cigarette smoking among college students
increased by 28 percent I he number of
students who had smoked in the last 30
days increased from 22.3 percent to 28.5
percent. ()f the 11 6 colleges in the stud\. ( >9
reported increases.
More than one-quarter of the smokers
in the 1997 survey began smoking regularly
while in college.
Although the increase extended across
all student demographic groups, the find
ings indicate that smoking prevalence was
higher in white students than black or

Asian students; higher in freshmen, sopho
mores and juniors than seniors and fifth
year stydents; lower at private than public
schools; and lower at highly competitive
schools compared with less competitive
schools as differentiated hy standardized
test scores and percentages of applicants
accepted.
1 he study also revealed that schools in
the Northeast. North C entral and Southern
regions had higher smoking rates than
schools in the West and that smoking
prevalence did not differ between rural and
urban schools, between women's and coed
ucational institutions, or between schools
with and without a religious affiliation.
