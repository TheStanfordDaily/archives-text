# Smoking on the rise at colleges
## Stanford, West Coast behind national average but climbing 
### Beth Robinowitz Contributing writer 
Cigarette smoking on college campuses
has increased nationwide among all stu
dent demographic groups according to in
formation obtained by the Harvard School
of Public Health's College Alcohol Study.
While Stanford's smoking rate is not as
high as that of other schools, the self-re
ported smoking rate at Stanford has risen
over the last four years.
The study, published in the Nov. 18
Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion, examined changes in cigarette smok
ing among different types of college stu
dents and colleges between 1993 and 1997.
Using data from 116 nationally repre

sentative four-year colleges, with a total of
15.103 randomly selected students in 1993
and 14,251 randomly selected students in
1997. the researchers found that between
1993 and 1997 the prevalence of current
cigarette smoking among college students
increased by 28 percent I he number of
students who had smoked in the last 30
days increased from 22.3 percent to 28.5
percent. ()f the 11 6 colleges in the stud\. ( >9
reported increases.
More than one-quarter of the smokers
in the 1997 survey began smoking regularly
while in college.
Although the increase extended across
all student demographic groups, the find
ings indicate that smoking prevalence was
higher in white students than black or

Asian students; higher in freshmen, sopho
mores and juniors than seniors and fifth
year stydents; lower at private than public
schools; and lower at highly competitive
schools compared with less competitive
schools as differentiated hy standardized
test scores and percentages of applicants
accepted.
1 he study also revealed that schools in
the Northeast. North C entral and Southern
regions had higher smoking rates than
schools in the West and that smoking
prevalence did not differ between rural and
urban schools, between women's and coed
ucational institutions, or between schools
with and without a religious affiliation.

Carole Pertofsky, director of
Stanford's Health Promotion Ser
vices, and Elise Lenox, who was di
rector of Stanford's Alcohol and
Other Drug Abuse Prevention Pro
gram from 1991 to 1998, illuminated
Stanford's own cigarette condition.
Lenox said, "The number of
Stanford students who self-report
smoking [tobacco], is below the na
tional average."
According to Pertofsky in 1993,
I8 percent of the 1,1 (X) students who
responded to the Stanford Student
Health Needs Assessment self-re
ported that they smoked.
In 1997, 25 percent said they
smoked. Of that 25 percent, more
than half rarely smoke —13 percent
smoked only once or twice a year —
and less than 3 percent smoked
more than once a week.
"What is important to consider
is how students smoke. It has been
my observation during my seven
years at Stanford that most of the
students who smoke do so 'recre

ationally' rather than in an addic
tive manner," Lenox said.
"Most students don't smoke on a
daily basis. They wouldn't 'qualify'
as pack-a-day smokers," she said.
"They tend to smoke occasionally
or 'recreationally,' they like to have
a cigarette when they drink."
Pertofsky warned of the danger
of too quickly labeling "recreation
al" smoking as benign.
"One might erroneously con
clude that smoking rarely is not
problematic. One of the major
problems is that studies show that
the vast majority of smokers begin
with one or two cigarettes a year. I
think that tobacco dependency is
one of the most serious health risks
facing students," Pertofsky said.
Heavier smokers, according to
Lenox, tend to be older students,
graduate students or international
students.
"A number of international stu
dents expressed amazement or
shock when they learned that smok
ing wasn't the norm on campus,"
Lenox commented.
Pertofsky, however, said that
most Stanford smokers were under

graduates.
She said that undergraduate men
smoke most frequently, followed by
undergraduate women, graduate
men and lastly graduate women.
Stanford does not have a tobacco
use prevention program.
"I believe 90 percent of smokers
start smoking before the age of 18.
So the true prevention efforts hap
pen in elementary and middle
school — many prevention special
ists would agree that even high
school programs are more cessation
orientated rather than preventive,"
Lenox said.
"We tried offering quit smoking
groups to students a few years ago
and we never rounded up enough
students to make a viable group,"
she said.
Lenox also mentioned that in
terms of the "recreational" smok
ers, they usually don't need a full
blown "quit smoking" program
when they decide to quit.
Currently the Health Promotion
Services strategy is to offer informa
tion packets. The packets contain
self-help information and resources
for locating support groups.
