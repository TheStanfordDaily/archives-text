# Institute studies technology, society
## Technology gives advances, but also negative effects, says Nie 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
The Stanford Institute for the
Quantitative Study of Society, a new
research institute headed by Political
Science Prof. Norman Nie. began op
erating in early November. The insti
tute plans to use empirical evidence
to study the social changes that result
from technology.
Nie studied societal trends as a
professor at the University of Chica
go. In 1975 he co-founded SPSS, a
software company that produces the
Statistical Package for the Social Sci
ences, which is used by academics,
marketing agents and pollsters
around the world.
Nie has several ties to Stanford, as
he received his doctorate here in 1970

and worked closely with University
President Gerhard Casper at Chica
go. His decision to return to Stanford
was also aided by the campus' loca
tion in Silicon Valley.
"I made a lot of my fortune writing
data-analysis software of human be
ings, and I thought 1 would put some
of that back by doing high-quality
studies of social change," said Nie.
"I couldn't think of a better place
to get others to help me fund that re
search than here in Silicon Valley,
where the members of the informa
tion technology community have also
done very well on these factors that
are going to produce an enormous
amount of change in the next 10 to 25
years," he said.
Nie thinks that many effects of
technology are very positive, such as

instant written communication and
more convenience in commerce.
However, he anticipates several
shortcomings as well. "You grocery
shop on tne Internet, you do your
work on Internet — you may not
leave your home for days at a time,"
Nie said.
The institute also studies possible
drawbacks of some of the new tech
nology. "What is it going to mean to
be able to be located any moment ot
the day by anyone because you have
[a cellular phone] sitting on your
desk? They are all being sold as in
struments that will reduce the burden
of work [and] free you to have more
leisure time. But what I've seen from
my business experience is that they
are extremely intrusive. What look
like reins often turn into chains."

Nie plans to incorporate re
searchers from across the social sci
ences, including economics, sociolo
gy, political science and communica
tions. "I believe that exciting, inter
esting ideas that are funded do draw
faculty and students," said Nie. "I'm
hoping that the questions we're ask
ing are compelling enough so that
we'll be joined."
In addition to new research op
portunities, the institute also plans to
provide other services to the Farm,
including a public lecture series. "We
hope to make an important contribu
tion to intellectual life here, and we
hope that it percolates down to the
undergraduate level, both in terms of
what is taught in the courses and the
speakers that we bring in [to] enrich
undergraduate life here at Stanford."
