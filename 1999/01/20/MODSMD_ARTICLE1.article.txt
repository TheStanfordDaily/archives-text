## New land-use planner hired to help Stanford, Santa Clara County 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, headed by Joseph Simit
ian, has approved the hiring of a land
use planner to help manage county re
view of Stanford University's land de
velopment activities and proposals.

Stanford owns more than 4.000
acres in unincorporated Santa Clara County, and works
closely with the county hoard in determining and ratify
ing University projects.
The new planner position will entail "coordinating
activity with the University, environmental consultants,
the community planning commission and the board of
supervisors," said Simitian.
He or she will also "assist with the public input
process, which will be substantial, looking at the history
of community interest" in Stanford developments,
Simitian said. "One of my goals is to involve the com
munity both earlier and more actively in the develop
ment process."
Evidence of public interest is high. Last November,
about 500 local residents attended a town hall meeting
on campus to discuss the University's proposal to build
more graduate housing. And in December, dozens of
local residents turned out for a county planning com
mission study session on Stanford's general use permit,
the planning document that governs University devel
opment on most of campus.
The meetings "involved many members of the com
munity, both inside and outside of Stanford." said Larry
Horton, the University's director of government and
community relations.
"We comply fully with land-use laws applied by the
county," said Horton. "There are public hearings and
environmental reviews of everything we do."
Simitian said that it is important that "the county
considers projects with Stanford that are long-term and
comprehensive in scope." He added that when consid
ering any project, "the first three issues on anyone's list


Horton
is traffic, traffic, traffic."
The current general use permit,
approved in 1989, allows Stanford
to build up to 2.1 million square feet
of building space. However, Stan
ford is approaching the square
footage limit, so part of the new
land-use planner's job will be to in
tegrate county and University input
toward a new agreement on general
land usage.
"I hope the University will sub
mit a proposal as early as possible,"
said Simitian. "One of my concerns
is that we don't want to be in a posi
tion where the University's autho
rization has expired, and we don't

have a new approval in place."
As a former Palo Alto city coun
cilman and mayor, Simitian is famil
iar with many of the issues of con
cern to both the county and the
University.
"I want to make sure the county
is adequately staffed to deal with
the time and attention that Stanford
development will require in the
next two years."
"Regrettably, Stanford land is
sues have the potential to polarize
the community," said Simitian. "My
goal is to insure that the develop
ment process gives everyone a fair
hearing and respects Stanford's le
gitimate interest while respecting
the community's interests and qual
ity of life at the same time. That's
easier said than done."
