## New land-use planner hired to help Stanford, Santa Clara County 
### Joanne Wu Contributing writer 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, headed by Joseph Simit
ian, has approved the hiring of a land
use planner to help manage county re
view of Stanford University's land de
velopment activities and proposals.

Stanford owns more than 4.000
acres in unincorporated Santa Clara County, and works
closely with the county hoard in determining and ratify
ing University projects.
The new planner position will entail "coordinating
activity with the University, environmental consultants,
the community planning commission and the board of
supervisors," said Simitian.
He or she will also "assist with the public input
process, which will be substantial, looking at the history
of community interest" in Stanford developments,
Simitian said. "One of my goals is to involve the com
munity both earlier and more actively in the develop
ment process."
Evidence of public interest is high. Last November,
about 500 local residents attended a town hall meeting
on campus to discuss the University's proposal to build
more graduate housing. And in December, dozens of
local residents turned out for a county planning com
mission study session on Stanford's general use permit,
the planning document that governs University devel
opment on most of campus.
The meetings "involved many members of the com
munity, both inside and outside of Stanford." said Larry
Horton, the University's director of government and
community relations.
"We comply fully with land-use laws applied by the
county," said Horton. "There are public hearings and
environmental reviews of everything we do."
Simitian said that it is important that "the county
considers projects with Stanford that are long-term and
comprehensive in scope." He added that when consid
ering any project, "the first three issues on anyone's list
