## Clinton addresses nation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Clin
ton. standing before a Congress torn over his
tate, proposed last night to protect Social
Security with the huge budget surpluses that
Republicans are eyeing for tax cuts. He also
announced the government will sue the
tobacco industry for smokers' health costs.
On a day of high drama that shifted from
his daytime trial in the Senate to his prime
time State of the Union speech. Clinton made
no mention of the sex-and-lies case that led to
his impeachment and imperils his presidency.
Several Republicans boycotted the 77-
minute speech; Chief Justice William Rehn
quist, presiding over Clinton's trial, also
stayed away.
In a new salvo against smoking. Clinton
announced the Justice Department will sue

the tobacco industry. He also is seeking a 55-
cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes.
Clinton also urged spending billions of
dollars for new programs in child care, educa
tion, crime-fighting, the environment and the
Pentagon. He called for raising the minimum
wage by $1 an hour over two years to $6.15.
On Social Security, Clinton's proposal sets
up a monumental fight over how to protect
the giant retirement program and deal with
GOP tax-cutting ambitions against a back
ground of $4 trillion in projected surpluses
over 15 years.
The president's proposal would create
new 401(k)-style retirement accounts for
workers and invest some of Social Security's
cash reserves in the stock market for the first
time.
