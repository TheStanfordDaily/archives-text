# Counsel says president should remain in office
## Lawyers begin Clinton's defense 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€”White
House Counsel Charles Ruff told the Sen
ate impeachment trial yesterday that Pres
ident Clinton was innocent of the charges
lodged against him and "must not be
removed from office."'
Ruff sharply attacked the conclusions
and motives of the 13 House prosecutors
who laid out their evidence last week. He
called their effort "nothing more than a
rush to judgment."
The House Republicans who approved
two articles of impeachment alleging Clin
ton lied under oath and obstructed justice
in concealing his affair with Monica

Lewinsky were "convinced by their own
rhetoric" and failed to "explore the consti
tutional underpinnings of that duty," Ruff
argued in a calm, matter-of-fact presenta
tion,
"They have, in essence, treated these
articles as empty vessels to be filled with
some witches' brew of charges," Ruff said.
The House prosecutors defended their
presentation afterward, issuing a state
ment disputing Ruff's contention they had
"only alleged" Clinton committed perjury
and had not proven it. The statement list
ed four specific Clinton statements they
said were "the president s perjurious state

ments" to the grand jury.
Ruff gave an unyielding defense of the
president just hours before Clinton was to
deliver the State of the Union Address
before the same lawmakers that
impeached him.
Delving into the evidence used to
charge Clinton with perjury, Ruff dis
missed discrepancies between the sworn
accounts of Ms. Lewinsky and the presi
dent. He said the Supreme Court has ruled
that a perjury conviction cannot be sus
tained with "equally honest witnesses who
may well have different recollections of
the same events."
