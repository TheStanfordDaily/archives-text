## Editorial Waffling over tenure 
### 
Sawislak ordeal suggests
tenure process lacks
objectivity and consensus

AFIFR ALMOST TWO years of
incensed controversy. University
President Gerhard Casper's deci
sion to extend the appointment of Asst.
Prof. Karen Sawislak offered only a confus
ing — and anticlimactic — resolution.
President Casper's turnaround decision
to offer the history professor one more
chance at tenure, however, was perhaps no
more irregular than the waffling that
plagued Sawislak's tenure review process.
According to the Report and Recom
mendation of the 1997-98 Advisory Board,
the history department unanimously rec
ommended Sawislak for tenure. The
board's approval was then echoed by the
Appointments and Promotions Committee
in a five-to-one vote. Two days later, how
ever, the deans of Humanities and Sciences
decided against tenure with a vote of three
to one.
Dean Shoven explained the deans' deci
sion in a letter to Sawislak, citing that her
"excellent teaching performance had not
been sufficiently exceptional to override
the concerns that arose about [her| scholar
ship."
Sawislak's resulting appeal charged that
the deans' decision had been procedurally
Hawed — her work had not been consid
ered in light of the "specific disciplinary
practices of historians."
Further, she mentioned, she had been
misinformed by her department as to the
weight placed on particular criteria during
the review.
The Advisory Board was next charged
with considering Sawislak's appeal. It
reconsidered the case and wound up dis
missing the unanimous approval of her
department and the support of the
Appointments and Promotions Committee
as rubberstamp votes that did not necessar
ily reflect the opinion of her colleagues.
It seems that the value of a consensus
vote, much less the weight of a departmen
tal vote, is negotiable.
The Advisory Board's majority opinion
then dismissed the deans' interpretation of
Sawislak's peer reviews. It also challenged
the validity of the deans' review of her
work.
And contrary to the deans, the Board
decided to consider Sawislak's fellowship
appointments as an indicator of her schol

arship. The Hoard recommended that her
grievance he upheld.
Perhaps, then, the deans' vote is of mod
est importance.
The decision finally reached Casper. In
a private letter to Sawislak, the president
again contradicted previous opinions. He
wrote that he "found (him)self in substan
tial agreement" with the minority opinion
that her appeal should be denied.
So it seems that even the majority opin
ion of the Advisory Board is disputable.
As Casper has said, it was ironic that he
decided to extend Sawislak's appointment
based on the questionable preparation she
had received from her department. The
concern with departmental preparation
assumed paramount importance only in
Casper's final analysis.
To some observers, this tenure ordeal
pointed to inconsistencies in the application
of affirmative action: Sawislak represented
one of Stanford's female faculty who, like
many minority faculty members, had not
gotten a fair shake. Others claimed Sawis
lak's focus in labor history played a role in
the decision by this University, which has
close ties to the anti-union computer indus
try.
The issue most clearly invoked by the
final decision to renew Sawislak's appoint
ment, however, is that of the subjectivity of
the tenure process. A glimpse inside the
guarded room of the tenure process has
revealed that it is neither ruled by objectiv
ity nor by consistent procedure. Further
more, consensus is not necessarily the end
of the matter.
The idea that tenure should be reviewed
based on a checklist of criteria was rejected
at all levels of the review process. We agree
that a set checklist ignores the evolving
nature of academic pursuits and will ulti
mately degrade the quality of tenured fac
ulty.
And even with a checklist, even with a
department's unanimous recommendation
for tenure, the decision, wrote President
Casper to Sawislak, "may be overruled by
the deans or the Provost or the Advisory
Board or the President."
If this is true, tenure could potentially
become the subjective decision of the pres
ident and his highest administrators. Even
though this rarely happens in practice, the
value of relying on this subjective and high
ly adaptable system is uncertain — as
uncertain as whether Sawislak will trade in
her prestigious fellowship at Harvard for
another two years as a junior faculty mem
ber at Stanford.
