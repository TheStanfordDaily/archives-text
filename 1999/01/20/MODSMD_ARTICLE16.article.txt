(Jnecessary dangers caused
by service vehicles
Although Kim Nicholas' idea of imple
menting bike lanes (Jan. 13 letter) would
probably make campus life more sane, I
would like to point out another major prob
lem: service vehicle obstruction.
I have personally experienced a bike
accident caused by a service van parked
right in the middle of a major thoroughfare.

as workers ate their lunch and watched
nearby.
How could I have possibly seen a
Rollerblader coming towards me while the
monolithic vehicle blocked the view around
the corner? Do they really have to park in
the middle of the road? Aren't there ser
vice vehicle spaces in lots around campus?
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.
