I you kids out," the
grizzled old man
grumbles. "You have it so
good, but all you do is
complain, complain, com
plain." He then embarks
on a 10-minute complaint
about how young adults complain too
much.
I suppose there is some truth to his
grumbling. Grossly characterized, we have
a hyper-aware, hyper-critical, hyper-sensi
tive cynicism. This may be seen as an out
ward symptom of our inward disease — the
discontent of living in a post-modern, post-
JFK / MLK. post-hip, post-fun era. Ameri
can society went through a two-decade
party with free love and reckless living on
tap, and now we young adults get to live
through the hangover.
One gets the sense that times are not as
innocent as they once were, and it seems
that we cannot count on much any more.
Our faith is not in the integrity of our lead
ers or the loyalty of our peers but in the reli
ability with which numerous franchises
around the world can produce identical Big
Macs. The fact is that we live in an era with
few heroes. Our parents had the physics and
philosophy of Einstein; we have the anti
humanism of Feynman and the wife-swap
ping antics of Hawking. Our grandparents
had Andrew Carnegie; we get Hill Gates.
Granted, not everything is worse than it
used to be. If all goes well, our generation
may never have to see an infantry war
again; air raids and smart bombs nave
replaced the trench warfare of yore. But

then again, the nation never partied as hard
as it did when it was recuperating from a
war. World War I gave us the Roaring '20s.
World War II brought on rock 'n' roll and
leather jackets. The Vietnam War gave way
to disco and bell bottoms, but we lost that
war, so what do you expect?
But let's be fair: Our growing cognizance
of our society's flaws does not necessarily
mean that times are a-changin' for the
worse. The apparent collapse of human val
ues may simply correspond to a greater
media emphasis on stories that conflict with
those values. The changing definition of
newsworthiness has reshaped our impres
sion of contemporary society, even though
society itself may not be much different
than it used to be. John Kennedy has been
revered as an American hero, but does that
mean that his unpublicized adulterous acts
were somehow less objectionable than
those of today's politicians? Probably not.
The moral climate has not changed — only
the rules of journalistic propriety have.
A fair amount of the information we
receive is mediated by a bevy of competing
talking heads and mastheads, each of which
is in the business of breaking stories before
its peers. Ted Turner's all-day news net
work raised the standard on acceptable
turnover rates for news reporting, and the
industry's commitment to quality control
has wavered as a consequence. Somewhere
down the line, journalism-as-news-report
ing gave way to journalism-as-commercial
business, and perhaps it was during this
gradual shift in priorities that sensational
journalism began to rear its yellow head.
Readers and viewers need to be won, andy

so now we hear about the shocking, the vio
lent and the taboo more than ever before.
No wonder we have the impression that
modern civilization is headed toward obliv
ion.
It is hard to know how this deluge of neg
ative news should influence us. As heirs to
the Watergate generation, many of us find
ourselves suspicious of most large institu
tions — government, religion and big busi
ness. What began as a scornful mistrust of
politicians and other authorities is now a
healthy skepticism of political spin, adver
tising and even the news itself. This skepti
cism is probably what people label "slacker
cynicism," but this is inaccurate. It is not
derived from a genuine misanthropy but
from an idealism shattered by repeated
blows from sensational news, outlandish
talk shows and personal experience.
We idealistic youths expect our leaders
and celebrities to be upstanding individuals,
and we hold our family and friends up to
some variant of the Normal Rockwell ideal.
However, dirt-digging reporters and Jerry
Springer have convinced us that no finite
mortal is capable of living up to these stan
dards, and the idealist is left ciushed and
disappointed. As I see it, this disappoint
ment, along with some critical skepticism, is
the closest thing to cynicism that our gener
ation can be legitimately accused of.
"That's a bunch of horse doo-doo," the
grizzled old man chimes.
Yeah, maybe it is.
