FOUR YEARS AGO this day in Stanford history, the
University was struggling to define a responsible invest
ment policy for its $3-billion endowment. "Jumping to
the front of a nationwide trend, Stanford University has
recently made efforts to ensure that its investments are envi
ronmentally sound," the Daily reported Jan. 20, 1995.
An investigation into Stanford's investment portfolio
revealed investments of over $25 million to companies such as
DuPont, Texaco, General Electric and Unocal. These are
companies which the Council on Economic Priorities, a non
profit organization based in New York, had cited as the envi
ronment's worst offenders, the Daily wrote.
According to Gary Malone, director of investment respon
sibility for the Stanford Management Company, implementing
green investments is no easy task due to the lack of credible
information about corporations' environmental performances.
The University said it would seek to remedy the conflict by
signing on to the Ceres Principles, a voluntary contract that
guides environmentally responsible corporate behavior. Stan
ford's plan, reported the Daily, was not to divest from ques
tionable companies but instead to "change the way corporate
America operates from within."

In other news. History Prof. Barton Bernstein's research on
a U.S. invasion of Japan that was planned during World War
11. but never executed, sparked confrontations between the
American Legion and the Smithsonian Institution.
According to the Daily, the Legion called for cancellation
of the Smithsonian's exhibit of the Enola Gay, the American
plane responsible for dropping the atomic bomb on Japan in
1945, "claiming that the exhibit was biased and portrayed the
Americans as aggressors." Bernstein's research, however,
showed that a ground invasion would have caused about
63,000 casualties, instead of the 229,(KX), casualties convention
ally acccepted. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
killed 210,000 people.
Political pressure from the Legion first resulted in a revision
of the Smithsonian display to include the higher number, but
similar pressure from anti-bomb groups caused the Smithsoni
an to lower the number again. This led to Legion members
protests to close the exhibit entirely.
Also in the news, economics Profs. Victor Fuchs and Anne
Krueger were appointed to the prestigious positions of presi
dent and president-elect of the American Economics Associa
tion, the nation's largest organization of economists.
