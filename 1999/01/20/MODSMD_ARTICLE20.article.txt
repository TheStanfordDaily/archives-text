## You must remember this — a kiss is just a kiss

TWO HYPOTHETICAL DRAW
groups, one male, one female, are
neighbors. They are very friendly
with each other, planning joint activities
and ski trips. The girls appreciate having
boys on hand to help move furniture or
scare away suspected intruders. The girls
enjoy how friendly, nice, and, most impor
tantly, "sale" their neighbors are.
I hese boys are "safe" because they can
be viewed as surrogate brothers. They act
as these girls' friends and supporters, but
romantic interaction is almost
unthinkable — or so each group believes.
But late at night, with the introduction of
alcohol and Marvin Gaye, relations
between the groups quickly spiral out of
control.
During Freshman Orientation a girl
meets a future draw mate and her older
brother. She and her new friends start
hanging out at the brother's fraternity. The
combination of an open kitchen and
friendly, funny guys brings them to the
house several times a week.
People call the girls "groupies" of this
fraternity, a name they gladly accept

because they love hanging out with these
guys, watching their athletic events and
attending their pre-parties. Only later do
they realize the sinister connotations of the
word groupie; most fraternities use it to
refer to a girl who has hooked up with
three or more of its members.
None of these girls has even kissed a
house member (well, maybe one girl kissed
a junior in a hot-tub incident, but they
ended up dating for several months). But
outside observers cannot believe that these
girls are just looking for substitutes for
their brothers and close high school guy
friends, nor can they believe that a frater
nity would allow girls to monopolize so
much of its time and cookie dough without
a certain kind of payment in return.
Ryan was my lab partner in ninth grade
science. We had a lot of fun together, set
ting things on fire and laughing a lot. My
science teacher asked us when the wedding
was. I told him we were strictly friends.
"There's no such thing," my teacher
responded, "guys always have one thing on
their mind." I refused to believe him. Two
months later, Rvan tried to kiss me.

Is it possible for girls and guys to main
tain strictly Platonic relationships? Or is
every co-ed relationship a romance waiting
to blossom?
There are some strictly safe mixed-gen
der relationships, such as siblings, and in
most states, cousins. These guys can pro
vide girls with football lessons and insight
ful boy advice without even a shadow of an
impending hook-up. Unfortunately, these
boys are often cruel to their female rela
tives, using them as unwilling partners
when practicing Tae Kwon Do or WWF
moves.
Can the "like a brother" dynamic be
recreated outside the genetic circle? Stud
ies of kibbutzim in Israel show that boys
and girls who grew up together in a com
munal residence are highly unlikely to
become romantically involved later.
Co-ed freshman dorms somewhat repli
cate the familial living situation, complete
with sibling-esque food fights. But dorm
cest happens, and relationships get more
complicated than they ever were in my
family.
Another "safe" category is boyfriends

of friends. He has to be nice to you and
keep his distance or suffer his girlfriend's
wrath.
Note that just having a girlfriend does
not make a boy safe. Especially if it's a
long-distance girlfriend whom you have
never met. Don't get too excited about this
guy who just thinks you're really cool and
is supposedly not physically attracted to
you. When he tries to kiss you a few weeks
into your friendship and tells you he and
his girlfriend have an open relationship or
she disappeared in China, don't believe
him. When she comes to visit a month
later, she will try to beat you up.
One of the best parts of having a
boyfriend is that you instantly declare all
other relationships Platonic. The few guy
friends who suspiciously stop calling are
more than replaced by your boyfriend's
friends, who will be nice to you without
making a move.
But maybe no mixed-gender friendship
is really "safe," just constrained by circum
stances. Perhaps physical attraction is the
basis of every male / female relationship.
Besides, what's wrong with a little fun

between friends? Hooking up is just a form
of communication. Why can't boys and
girls just be friends ... with privileges?
One girl used to say hooking up with
friends was the mature thing to do. Those
who couldn't kiss without emotional
attachment were more adolescent than
adult. To demonstrate her point, she
repeatedly had amorous encounters with a
good "friend." Then he asked another
female "friend" to his formal, and she
flipped out. It took them several years of
screaming and crying to sort through their
"friendship."
Can boys and girls truly be friends with
out expected romantic reciprocation? With
clear communication and self-control 1
think, and hope, Platonic friendships are
possible. But in the infamous words of the
great rapper Bismarke, when "you say he's
just a friend," be very careful.

who you are.
