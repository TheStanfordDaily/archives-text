Louise Bitting, a Stanford post
doctoral fellow in molecular biolo
gy and neuroscience, died unex
pectedly at Stanford Hospital last
Saturday. She was 49 years old.
Bitting came to Stanford in 1989
as a graduate student in the Biolo
gy Department. Since then, she did
research on the subjects of sleep,
hibernation, Alzheimer's disease
and other areas of neuroscience,
and published numerous scientific
articles.
Bruce O'Hara, a senior research
scientist in the Biology Depart
ment, worked with Bitting on a
daily basis for five years and subse
quently hired her for research
work.
"Louise stood out as an incredi
bly creative scientist; she came up
with original ideas almost daily,"

O'Hara said. "She was very dedi
cated — she went back to get her
Ph.D. while her kids were in
school."
He added that she "overcame
many obstacles to pursue science,"
noting that she was a single mother
and had a real passion for science.
Ellen Macdonald, the under
graduate research coordinator in
biology and Bitting's close friend,
also noted that "Louise was so
strong and capable. She had a pas
sion for living and devoted her life
to her kids."
Bitting left a high-paying
biotechnology job to come to Palo
Alto to pursue her love of science
and give her children the best edu
cation possible.
"She was a very loving and car
ing person and she was always in
terested in how others were
doing," said Macdonald.

"I was always amazed by how
much she loved and cared for her
children and her passion for life —
she loved to dance. She devoted
her life to the happiness of her chil
dren," she said.
Macdonald explained that a
memorial fund has been set up for
Bitting's children.
O'Hara said that "Everyone will
remember Louise's creativity and
her love of science."
Bitting began her career in sci
ence in high school. In her senior
year in Oklahoma City, Bitting
won the Bausch and Lomb Science
Prize and the Betty Crocker
Homemaker Award.
Louise Bitting is survived by her
son Thomas Vitto, her daughter
Clair Vitto, her mother Charlene
Bitting, her sister Elaine Bitting
and her brothers David, Steve,
Keith and Mark.
