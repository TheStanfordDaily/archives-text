MEN S RUGBY
■ Saturday: Season Opener: Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo 20, Stanford 14.

And it got its first loss, on a controversial call
at the conclusion of the game.
Hampered by poor ball-handling and errant
passing, the Cardinal was upset in its season
debut by the visiting Mustangs of Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. The Mustangs defeated the Cardi
nal 20-14, in a close game marred by Stanford

turnovers.
According to a few of the Cal Poly ruggers,
the match against Stanford was an opportunity
to show their strength against a Stanford team
that is highly ranked year after year.
For Stanford, on the other hand, Saturday
night's game against Cal Poly was the first of
"many hard games ahead this year," according
to Cardinal head coach Franck Boivert, whose
team made it as far as the national champi
onship match last season.
Saturday, the match started off quickly in
favor of the visitors in front of an abnormally
large Mustang crowd. High spirits caught Stan
ford off guard as Cal Poly raced down the field
and earned a penalty try followed by an easy
conversion.
Down 7-0, the Cardinal turned to its team

leaders. Senior captain Steve Preonas pinned
the Mustangs deep in their own territory with a
well placed kick. The strong Cardinal front line
then forced the Mustangs to kick the ball away
twice.
Stanford's Jessie Cuevas scored after a pre
cise throw from the sideline on the ensuing line
out. Kicker Jackson Wagener kicked the con
version through the uprights to tie the score, 7-
7, midway through the first half.
"The team is very enthusiastic this year,"
Boivert said.
The superior strength of the Cardinal ruggers
was often seen throughout the rest of the first
half, as the ball remained deep in Mustang terri
tory.
