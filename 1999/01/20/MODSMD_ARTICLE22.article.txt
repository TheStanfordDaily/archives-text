Saturday evening, the Stanford men's rugby
squad kicked off its 19W season under the lights
of Maloney field.

MEN S RUGBY
■ Saturday: Season Opener: Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo 20, Stanford 14.

And it got its first loss, on a controversial call
at the conclusion of the game.
Hampered by poor ball-handling and errant
passing, the Cardinal was upset in its season
debut by the visiting Mustangs of Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. The Mustangs defeated the Cardi
nal 20-14, in a close game marred by Stanford

turnovers.
According to a few of the Cal Poly ruggers,
the match against Stanford was an opportunity
to show their strength against a Stanford team
that is highly ranked year after year.
For Stanford, on the other hand, Saturday
night's game against Cal Poly was the first of
"many hard games ahead this year," according
to Cardinal head coach Franck Boivert, whose
team made it as far as the national champi
onship match last season.
Saturday, the match started off quickly in
favor of the visitors in front of an abnormally
large Mustang crowd. High spirits caught Stan
ford off guard as Cal Poly raced down the field
and earned a penalty try followed by an easy
conversion.
Down 7-0, the Cardinal turned to its team

leaders. Senior captain Steve Preonas pinned
the Mustangs deep in their own territory with a
well placed kick. The strong Cardinal front line
then forced the Mustangs to kick the ball away
twice.
Stanford's Jessie Cuevas scored after a pre
cise throw from the sideline on the ensuing line
out. Kicker Jackson Wagener kicked the con
version through the uprights to tie the score, 7-
7, midway through the first half.
"The team is very enthusiastic this year,"
Boivert said.
The superior strength of the Cardinal ruggers
was often seen throughout the rest of the first
half, as the ball remained deep in Mustang terri
tory.

Last year s Cardinal men's rugby team made it to the national cham
pionships where it fell to California.
However, Stanford struggled
during the remainder of the half
and was plagued by hall-handling
troubles, failing to score before the
break.
The Mustangs returned to the
field early for what would be a frus
trating finish for the Cardinal.
Once again, Cal Poly got to
work quickly as it pinned Stanford
deep in its own territory, only to
miss a long field goal after a Cardi
nal penalty.
Behind powerful runs, Cal Poly
once again threatened to score but
Stanford's defense stopped the
Mustangs temporarily, before
committing a penalty.

Cal Poly then opted for the field
goal, taking the lead 10-7.
Stanford followed with superior
strength and speed, marching deep
into Mustang territory. Errant
passes seemed to be a constant as
the Cardinal was unable to score.
After another Stanford
turnover, a Mustang player broke
through the Stanford defense and
kicked the ball deep, which was re
covered by Cal Poly. After numer
ous attempts, the Mustangs even
tually raced around the left side to
score a try only to miss the conver
sion. His play, however, gave Cal
Poly a 15-7 lead.
Stanford responded with a score
of its own, nailing the conversion to
narrow the lead to 15-14. However,
once again Cal Poly answered
Stanford's score, after a Cardinal

turnover, with a try of its own. Cal
Poly, on the other hand, could not
hit the conversion and had to settle
for a 20-14 lead.
With just a couple of minutes
left in the game, Stanford appeared
to score a try in the far corner and
the referee signaled it fair.
However, the sole referee
quickly reversed his decision and
penalized Stanford, giving the ball
to Cal Poly, without granting the
Cardinal an explanation of any
kind.
Boivert was obviously disap
pointed with the loss, and felt that
his team made some crucial errors.
"We really helped (Cal Poly]
with all of the turnovers," he said.
The Cardinal will try to get back
on the winning track with a game at
Arizona on Jan. 23.
