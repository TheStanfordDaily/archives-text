# Advantage: Tokuda
## Freshman tennis standout has battled one tough opponent in her life 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
"I'm enjoying myself."
She grins.
"A lot, actually."
It has taken Keiko Tokuda quite a
while to achieve this state of contentment.
As a teen, she spent her days training on
the tennis courts and her nights hitting the
books. She rarely took the time to rest and
appreciate her surroundings. A singular
focus on the future drove her body and
mind — Tokuda planned to be a profes
sional tennis player. And nothing would
derail her.
Nothing except an illness called Crohn-
Colotis.
Tokuda grew up in New Jersey in a ten
nis-playing family. Her father spent hours
training his three daughters at a public
park and soon Keiko. the youngest,
emerged as the most precocious and tal
ented.
Before long, the diminutive 13-year
old found herself in the finals of national
tournaments intended for girls five years
her senior. By 1996, she had taken the Na
tional 18's Clay Court Title, one of the na
tion's most prestigious junior tourna
ments.
"I was so excited." Tokuda explains. "I
had such high hopes for myself."
But this excitement's foundation de
manded hours of relentless training.
"I was pushing myself so hard in tennis
and in school." she remembers. "I didn't
want to be one of those top tennis players
that does badly in school."
Tokuda remembers how tennis con
sumed her life. While the experience of

having her father as her coach didn't rival
any infamous tennis-parent horror sto
ries. she admits that it was difficult at
times.
"My father was my coach, so there was
no separation between my family life and
my tennis life. Get to sleep early, no party
ing, get ready for the tournament over
Christmas vacation. I could never escape
from tennis in my life."
Suddenly, a week before a highly antic
ipated national tournament. Tokuda fell
mysteriously ill. She had to spend several
weeks in the hospital and. as a result,
missed the tournament.
"The illness is caused by stress," Toku
da says. "There's a loss of appetite, fatigue,
all sorts of medications and severe cramp
ing."
Unfortunately, the problems are recur
ring and have plagued Tokuda since mid
way through her high school career. After
that time in 1996, and until as recently as
this past fall, Tokuda hasn't been able to
practice consistently.
"The first time I became ill. I was so
angry. I couldn't believe I was in the hos
pital."
Eventually, however, Tokuda's
thoughts concerning her experience
evolved.
"I was growing up so quickly," she says.
"All the doctors in the hospital thought 1
sounded 35. [ The illness] was a good thing,
thinking back. It brought me back into the
world of being a teenager."
Tokuda is finally learning how to man
age her illness, and she's commencing a
successful campaign on the Stanford
women's tennis team. When she reflects
upon her past and the curve balls that life

has thrown at her, she insists that she
wouldn't have it any other way.
"I am truly enjoying every aspect of col
lege life," says Tokuda, who lives in Bran
ner Hall. "I was never a regular high
school student, hut now I'm having the full
college experience."
Tokuda also feels that, interestingly
enough, her tennis game is doing fine de
spite the fact that it is no longer her sole
focus. In her first collegiate tournament,
she reached the quarterfinals, an impres
sive accomplishment.
"My tennis is up and down and the ill
ness definitely hasn't gone away. Whenev
er 1 think I have it under control, it resur
faces again," Tokuda says.
"But I never want to need my tennis as
a way of living," she adds. "I just want it to
be an option."
Regardless of the state of her game,
Tokuda's mind-set is an enthusiastic one.
She appreciates the company of both her
dormmates and her teammates. She cele
brates the diversity of the students on the
Stanford campus, recognizing that sh'S
probably wouldn't have met so many dif
ferent kinds of people had she missed out
on the college experience. She certainly
wouldn't have met her teammates, women
with whom she has already forged strong
bonds.
Tokuda laughs when she discusses the
memories they have already created to
gether.
"The team is great, and they're normal
people. Their lives aren't just tennis. It's so
much less intense."
And while she's less single-minded

Academically, Tokuda is leaning

"Psychology could be good for

Keiko Tokuda doesn't want to

questions about what could've or

that while the life of one of the most

nothing is certain in this world, and

excess stress.
