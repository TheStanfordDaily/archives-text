# Up Dawson's creek
## OSU, UC-Davis fall to women's polo 
### Joey Elger 
Facing more of a challenge with
the weather than its opponents, the
Stanford women's horse polo team
came away with a couple of wins at a
round-robin tournament at UC-
Davis last weekend. The men didn't
fare quite as well, but still managed a
split of their two contests.
Led by junior Alison Dawson's 10
goals in two games, the women
showed the form that has made them
the front-runners of the Western Re
gional Conference.

■ Women's: Defeated UC-Davis,
10-1, and Oregon State, 11-1, in
round-robin tournament.
■ Men's: Defeated UC-Davis, 5-4,
and lost to Oregon State, 5-4, in
round-robin tournament.

Overcoming wet and muddy con
ditions, which Dawson referred to as
"nasty," Stanford recorded a 10-1
win against host UC-Davis, followed
by an 11-1 victory against Oregon
State. The victories improved the
Cardinal's record to 5-2 overall, and
5-0 in the Western Regional.
Against Davis, the Cardinal was
led by Dawson's six goals and the
stellar defensive play of Andrea
Avtjoglou. Bonnie Lind added three
goals, with Brandy Moses contribut
ing one.
In Stanford's next match against

Oregon State. Dawson again lit up
the scoreboard, as she contributed
four goals to the Cardinal's cause.
Bonnie Lind, however, topped Daw
son with five goals.
The continued defensive pres
ence of Andrea Avtjoglou, however,
prevented Oregon State from even
getting into the game.
"She played great defense all day.
She did an amazing job for us. We
wouldn't have won without her,"
Dawson said, praising her teammate.
Avtjoglou also put her name in
the score book, as she and Brandy
Moses contributed a goal apiece.
The Cardinal men were not quite
as successful, however, but still man
aged a split at the weekend tourna
ment.
Led by Colvin Pitts' six goals in
two matches, the Cardinal downed
the UC-Davis Aggies 5-4. and was
barely picked off by Oregon State 5-
4.
The men came in with an overall
record of 1-1 record along with a 1-1
conference record, placing them in
the middle of the pack in the Western
Regional.
Against Davis on Saturday, Pitts
scored three goals to lead the Cardi
nal to its second victory over the Ag
gies this year.
Tom Stripling and Jon Russell
each contributed a goal as Stanford
sneaked out a narrow victory, and
one much closer than the 12-6 hurt
