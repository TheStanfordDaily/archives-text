# Up Dawson's creek
## OSU, UC-Davis fall to women's polo 
### Joey Elger 
Facing more of a challenge with
the weather than its opponents, the
Stanford women's horse polo team
came away with a couple of wins at a
round-robin tournament at UC-
Davis last weekend. The men didn't
fare quite as well, but still managed a
split of their two contests.
Led by junior Alison Dawson's 10
goals in two games, the women
showed the form that has made them
the front-runners of the Western Re
gional Conference.

POLO
■ Women's: Defeated UC-Davis,
10-1, and Oregon State, 11-1, in
round-robin tournament.
■ Men's: Defeated UC-Davis, 5-4,
and lost to Oregon State, 5-4, in
round-robin tournament.

Overcoming wet and muddy con
ditions, which Dawson referred to as
"nasty," Stanford recorded a 10-1
win against host UC-Davis, followed
by an 11-1 victory against Oregon
State. The victories improved the
Cardinal's record to 5-2 overall, and
5-0 in the Western Regional.
Against Davis, the Cardinal was
led by Dawson's six goals and the
stellar defensive play of Andrea
Avtjoglou. Bonnie Lind added three
goals, with Brandy Moses contribut
ing one.
In Stanford's next match against

Oregon State. Dawson again lit up
the scoreboard, as she contributed
four goals to the Cardinal's cause.
Bonnie Lind, however, topped Daw
son with five goals.
The continued defensive pres
ence of Andrea Avtjoglou, however,
prevented Oregon State from even
getting into the game.
"She played great defense all day.
She did an amazing job for us. We
wouldn't have won without her,"
Dawson said, praising her teammate.
Avtjoglou also put her name in
the score book, as she and Brandy
Moses contributed a goal apiece.
The Cardinal men were not quite
as successful, however, but still man
aged a split at the weekend tourna
ment.
Led by Colvin Pitts' six goals in
two matches, the Cardinal downed
the UC-Davis Aggies 5-4. and was
barely picked off by Oregon State 5-
4.
The men came in with an overall
record of 1-1 record along with a 1-1
conference record, placing them in
the middle of the pack in the Western
Regional.
Against Davis on Saturday, Pitts
scored three goals to lead the Cardi
nal to its second victory over the Ag
gies this year.
Tom Stripling and Jon Russell
each contributed a goal as Stanford
sneaked out a narrow victory, and
one much closer than the 12-6 hurt
ing they put on the Aggies earlier this
season.
The Cardinal men hoped to clinch
a first-place finish in the round-robin
tournament by finishing with a win
against Oregon State on Sunday.
1 lowever, it was not to be, as Stan
lord was narrowly defeated by a de
termined Beaver squad.
Pitts once again struck for three
goals, with Russell contributing one
as well. Although a loss, the perfor
mance represented a significant im
provement for the Cardinal, which
fell to the Beavers 20-7 earlier in the
season.
According to Pitts, even this score
was not indicative of how well the
Cardinal played.
"We had essentially one bad peri
od the entire weekend," Pitts said of
the second period against Oregon
State in which the Cardinal was

outscored 4-0. "Other than that we
played some great polo."
The weekend began the home
stretch for both Cardinal teams. In
just over a month, at the end of Feb
ruary, they will travel to the Western
Regional tournament in Rancho
Murietta, C 'alii ~ just outside of Sacra
mento.
Only the first-place team from ilie
West Regional advances to nation
als, which are held in Burleson,Texas
at the end of March. That makes the
first round bye. given to the number
one seed going into the tournament,
that much more attractive to the de
termined Cardinal teams.
The season continues this week
end when the Cardinal travels to UC-
Santa Barbara to duel the Gauchos.
The men are expecting a stiff chal
lenge from a veteran Gaucho group
ranked second in the Western Re
gional. while the women aren't sure
quite what to expect, as the Lady
Ciauchos return only one player from
last year.
