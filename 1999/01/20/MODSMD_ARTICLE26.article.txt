## Uncovering the science behind sports Winter in Half Moon Bay brings huge, deadly waves The
						event at Mavericks is no surfing safari 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
Since Nov. 1, 1998, 20 of the world's best
surfers have been eagerly awaiting the first surf
contest to be held at the legendary Mavericks
reef, off the tip of Pillar Point in Half Moon
Bay. The participants know only that the con
test will take place sometime before Jan. 27 and
that they will have only 48 hours notice of the
date.
Jeff Clark, a Half Moon Bay local who first
discovered the ideal surfing conditions at the
reef, will oversee the contest, choosing the par
ticipants and the date. The true judges of the
contest, however, will be the waves.
The Mavericks site is unmatched by any
other in the world in terms of wave size and
intensity. When the waves reach the ideal
height of 20 feet, Jeff Clark will call the surfers
to Half Moon Bay for the competition that is
sure to make surfing history.
The sole sponsor of the competition, which
is named the "Quiksilver Men who Surf Moun
tains Event," is Quiksilver USA, a surfing gear
company. First prize is $10,000, with a total of
$50,000 being given away.
Although the competition's name describes
20-foot waves, the participants may get more
than they bargained for. Wave size is technical
ly measured from the back, but the front, which
is where you surf, can be twice as large as the
reported height. The term "swell" is usually
used to describe these waves. A swell, also
known as a free wave, is a wave that has trav
eled away from its generating area and has

become larger and smoother along the way.
This swell will eventually break when it hits
any barrier â€” a reef or the shoreline, for exam
ple. The water crashes into this obstacle, creat
ing the wave breaks one can see from shore.
After the crash, powerful currents suck the
water hack towards the ocean.
The waves themselves are formed as varia
tions in air pressure above the water force gusty
winds downward upon the water's surface. As
the wave propagates through the ocean, water
particles follow a nearly circular path in a verti
cal plane. The particles move upward as the
wave approaches, downward as the crest pass
es. and then return to their original position.
Mavericks is so famous because the waves
near this reef break more than a quarter of a
mile from shore, making them thicker and
much more powerful than they would be if they
broke closer in.
The reef is responsible for the gigantic
waves, sorting all the variables of swell, tide,
wind and current to create the ideal surfing
waves. In addition, the westerly currents which
follow the wave crash can pull any unlucky fall
en surfer toward the jagged rocks and protrud
ing boulders of the Mavericks reef.
Other big wave spots around the world orig
inate because ocean swells uninterrupted over
long distances suddenly slam into shallow
coastal reefs. The wave's power dissipates after
it breaks because it hits deeper water when it
reaches the shore side of the reef.
The wave* ftTMnVfcfieks operate differently
and more dangerously. There, the water is
more shallow between the reef and the shore.

and thus the force of the wave does not dissi
pate. Unlucky surfers who wipe out may get
continuously pounded on rocks or get thrown
into oncoming waves.
While on any given day the waves at Maver
icks are unique to the area, this year they may
he all the more powerful. The 1998-99 season
marks the onset of La Nina, the weather condi
tion opposite to the El Nino experienced last
year.
Under normal conditions, atmospheric pres
sure is high over the Eastern Pacific regions
and low over central and western portions.
Because wind moves from high to low atmo
spheric pressures, this pressure difference caus
es the winds to blow westward across the
ocean.
La Nina, however, affects atmospheric pres
sure, changing the direction and increasing the
strength of winds. These changing winds in turn
influence the direction and magnitude of the
ocean's current, causing changes in the tide and
waves. Although meteorologists are not able to
predict the effect La Nina will have on surfing
conditions at Mavericks, they propose that it
will contribute to stronger, larger, and more
dangerous waves.
While the organizers have no precedents to
look to in order to determine how the contest
will operate, they hope for an ideal day of 20-
foot waves and clear weather conditions.
Meanwhile, the surfers await the announce
ment of the competition. Ultimately, however,
neither the organizers nor the participants will
determine the date, for the waves are truly in
charge.
