# Gene therapy may aid hemophilia treatment
## 
### Jane Morril Contributing writer 
A new gene therapy technique
pioneered by Stanford researchers
promises to help hemophilia
patients by replacing their defec
tive blood protein genes with
healthy DNA.
Hemophilia is a genetic disor
der in which one of the normal
blood-clotting factors is deficient,
causing severe bleeding from
minor cuts and injuries. The dis
ease affects about 1 in S,(MX) peo
ple, occurring almost exclusively in
men.
The blood of hemophilia
patients is missing sufficient
amounts of clotting factor VIII or
factor IX. These factors allow the
blood of healthy people to gel once
it leaves the blood vessels. Even a
minor injury, therefore, requires
hemophiliacs to receive an imme
diate transfusion of the appropri
ate clotting factors.
The researchers infused the
human gene for factor IX into the
livers of hemophiliac mice. The
injection succeeded, the mice
began to produce factor IX, and
the bleeding disorder was correct
ed. These mice are still alive more
than a year after treatment, in con
trast to mice not infused with the
gene who tended to experience
fatal bleeding at two or three
months of age. No side effects were
observed in the treated mice.
In the past, clotting factors have
been prepared from human blood
products. Scientists are currently
developing genetically engineered
clotting factors to alleviate the
demand on human blood supplies
and also protect against possible
infection from blood-borne dis
eases such as HIV. These new clot
ting factors, however, still require
regular transfusion to enter into
the bloodstream.
New gene therapy would

remove the need to regularly
administer the missing clotting fac
tor. Instead, a functional copy of
the clotting factor gene could he
inserted in the patient's cells to
replace the defective gene, provid
ing Itfe-long prevention of
hemophiliac bleeds.
"In the three years I've been
working on this particular project,
we've made slow advances," said
Mark Kay, associate professor of
pediatrics and genetics and senior
author of the collaborative study.
Kay said that previous attempts
at treating the disease have failed.
"This is the first method 1 have
seen without problems," he said.
"We want to try to treat
patients, which hopefully will hap
pen in 1999." Kay added. "I think it
would be far-fetched to say we'll
cure them in the first go around,
but we will try to use the same type
of approach to make therapy more
efficient, and ultimately we can use
this approach to cure people."
The team continued its research
in dogs before the gene was tested
in humans. Two hemophiliac dogs
were infused with a small dose of
the factor IX gene, which resulted
in production of the clotting factor
at a level of 1 percent of the normal
amount found in healthy dogs'
blood.
Even this small increase makes
a big difference in the onset of
symptoms. "At the dosage we used
for the dogs, you could change this
disease from a severe one to one
that is moderate or mild, and real
ly improve the quality of life of
patients," said Kay.
"Furthermore, we will increase
the dosage gradually, so as not to
cause any unseen toxicity."
"This is an important time for
gene therapy," Kay added. "We're
going to start seeing therapeutic
benefits from not just this but other
diseases that people are trying to
treat as well."
