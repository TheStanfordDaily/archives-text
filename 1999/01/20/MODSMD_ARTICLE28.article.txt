# Parabolics and piezoelectrics?
## Ski industry introduces innovative, high-tech gear 
### James Pritchard Editorial staff 
It's dorm ski trip season again,
and it's time to pull out that old ski
equipment from the closet and gri

mace at the scratched-up state of
affairs.

Those ski boots you were so excited to

get in junior high school may still have work
ing buckles, but they sure aren't very comfort
able. Those old skis of your dad's may still be
getting you down the slopes, but their bases
look like they were put through an electric
sander. It might be time to consider investing in
some new equipment.
This undertaking may not be as simple as it
sounds. Recent ski seasons have brought multi
ple technical innovations to the ski industry —
skis with cuts, skis with switches, skis with cir
cuits. It's difficult to tell which are the must
haves and which are the gimmicks.
The talk on the slopes during the last three
seasons has focused on the new ski design,
which has graduated from being the new thing
on the market a few years ago to becoming the
only ski you can buy. The traditional straight
ski has been replaced by parabolics.
Parabolics, also referred to as hourglass skis,
are narrow at the binding and wider at the tip
and the tail. The degree of arc ranges from just
a slight flaring of the old straight ski to quite an
exaggerated hourglass shape.
All skis, whether traditional or parabolic,
have a degree of sidecut which helps the ski
turn. As a skier turns to the right, he leans to
the right, and the ski's right edge leans against
the snow. The sidecut of the ski — the slightly
curved edge — causes the ski to turn along its
arc.
To make a shorter turn, a skier applies more
pressure to the operative ski, bending the ski
slightly. This slight bend places an even tighter
arc in contact with the snow and consequently
produces a sharper turn. Finding this turn, how
ever, often takes more strength or more experi
ence than a skier has.
Parabolics make turning a whole lot easier.
These skis require less pressure to produce the
necessary turns, because the ski's natural arc
facilitates the turn.
Varying degrees of arc have been experi
mented with, but it was not until the Head

Cyber
Series was intro

duced in 1994 that
parabolic skis began to
catch on.

The new ski technology may

have grown out of innovations of
the snowboard industry, a rela
tively new area with a lot of
activity.

Parabolic skis are intended to
make the sport easier and have caught

on with every ability level, from novice to
expert. Even so, the large tip and tail some

times make mogul skiing more difficult than it
needs to be.
Details of the cut of a parabolic ski may
sound technical, but the piezoelectrics of the
K2 Fours feature are far more complex.
The K2 Four, last year's best selling ski, fea
tures a piezoelectric system, which transforms
the normal vibrations that travel through a ski
into electrical energy. A piezoelectric materi
al is a substance which produces a charge
when it is bent. i
A tiny control circuit then releases this '
energy in the form of heat and light ener
gy-
Although it is virtually impossible to see
when on the slopes, a flashing red light near the
middle of the ski signals that the system is
working.
The idea is that the more vibration energy
that is absorbed, the more efficiently the ski
will perform.
Parabolics and piezoelectrics are just two
examples of the slew of technical advances that
have hit the ski industry in recent years. Poles

are get
ting thinner and stronger. Some new ski boots
feature a switch that allows you to adjust your
boot from walking mode to skiing mode.
So if you are in the market for replacing that
old-school ski equipment, make sure you shop
around first. You have a lot of choices, and the
equipment out there may look a whole lot dif
ferent than it did last time you bought new
gear.
