# More anonymous HIV testing at Cowell
## 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Cowell Student Health Services is increasing the
opportunities for Stanford students to obtain
anonymous testing for HIV. the virus that leads to
AIDS.
Cowell will decrease the number of clinicians of
fering weekly confidential counseling, shifting stu
dents into anonymous appointments, according to
junior Katie Caldwell, co-director of the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center.

'The sooner treatment begins after
infection, the more effective the treatment
will be.'

Current options include both anonymous and
confidential testing. According to Carole Pertof
sky, director of health promotion services at Cow
ell, anonymous HIV testing is more popular.
Under this service, which is conducted by a trained
peer counselor, a student can use an assumed
name, and no identifying records are kept.
The other service is confidential HIV testing,
meaning that a student is tested during an appoint
ment with a clinician. Those results are confidential
and can only be released by the student.
Both options involve a pre-test HIV counseling

session, a visit to the Cowell lab for blood work and
a follow-up in which the results are presented.
Pertofsky praised the strength of the HIV peer
counseling program, which is separate from the
SHPRC and currently in its seventh year. "We all
learn from our peers and the student group we have
is very well educated and very effective. They do a
great job."
The preparation for being an HIV peer coun
selor consists of 16 hours of training, plus one quar
ter of internship work.
About 4(X) to 500 students use the anonymous
HIV testing service per year, with an equal number
using the confidential service.
"Our data follows the national trend," Pertof
sky continued. According to Cowell's Health
Needs Assessment, last done in 1997, one in 500
Stanford students is HIV-positive.
The HIV test doesn't measure the presence of
the virus; instead, it tests for certain antibodies that
would exist in an infected person.
According to Pertofsky, the main risk factors for
HIV are "vaginal, anal and to some degree oral in
tercourse; through needles; and from mother to
child through breast milk."
Pertofsky stated that students can get an ap
pointment within one week with a peer counselor.
Results are available two weeks after the test.
An individual who has been infected for six
weeks will have an 80 percent chance of an accurate
test, according to Pertofsky. After three months,
the accuracy rises to 98 percent.

Casey Ward, a sophomore and head of educa
tion for SHPRC counselors, doesn't feel that Stan
ford apply their knowledge about HIV and AIDS.
" There's a pretty high education level," she said,
"but people don't always let that education level af
fect their personal choice."
Sophomore Jill DiGiovanni, SHPRC outreach
coordinator, cited the"it can't happen to me" men
tality as the reason many Stanford students aren't
that concerned about sexually transmitted diseases
and AIDS. "While disease prevention is a con
cern," she stated, "preventing pregnancy is a larger
one."
Pertofsky encourages anyone who might be at
risk to get tested. "The sooner treatment begins
after infection, the more effective treatment will
be," Pertofskv said.
