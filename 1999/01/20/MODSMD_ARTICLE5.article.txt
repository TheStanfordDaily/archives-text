### Marni Leff Senior staff writer 
Woong Sun, a 26-year-old me
chanical engineering graduate stu
dent, died in a car accident early Sat
urday morning. Sun. who was nearly
done with work toward his master's
degree, had been out celebrating
with his friend. Sun-Young Kim, who
had just completed his doctorate in
chemical engineering.
Kim remains in the intensive care
unit at Stanford Medical Center re
covering from surgery to repair facial
fractures, according to nursing super
visor Jo Ann Wong. He was listed in
serious but stable condition. Chan-
Woo Park and Dongyup Han, also
graduate students, were in the car
when it crashed, but were not seri
ously injured.
The group had been out celebrat
ing, first with dinner at a Chinese
restaurant and later with drinks and
karaoke at a Korean bar.
Sun was driving a red 1997 Aeura.
The accident occurred in Mountain
View on the ramp between State
Route 85 and U.S. Highway 101 at
2:10 a.m., according to Sgt. Bill
Donovan of the California 1 lighway

Patrol Redwood City office.
"He was driving at a speed too fast
for the conditions," Donovan said.
According to the accident report
released by the Highway Patrol, "the
Acura spun around, struck the right
barrier wall, then crossed the road
way where it struck a curb and be
came airborne. The rear of the Acura
then struck a tree."
Donovan added that although po
lice determined that Sun was driving
too fast, they were unable to figure
out his exact speed.
No other vehicles were involved
in the crash.
Sun's friends remember him as a
caring person.
"He was a good student. He was a
nice guy to everyone, an especially
nice guy," Park told the Palo Alto
Daily News.
One friend remembered Sun as
different from other Stanford stu
dents.
"He was a really good friend. I
think the best way to describe him is
to say he had a warm heart. He
thought about others more than he
thought about himself."
The funeral was held yesterday af
ternoon.
