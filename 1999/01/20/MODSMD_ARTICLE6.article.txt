## Feds set new standards for crime stats: Stanford already complies with many 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Although the new Higher Edu
cation Act affects many universi
ties' policies on reporting crimes
and other violations, Stanford will
not need to make many changes in
order to comply.
The new act requires universi
ties to make public alcohol, drug
and weapons violations that are
sometimes dealt with in closed
door campus judiciary hearings.
Universities must now also report
cases of manslaughter and arson.
Previously, they were only required
to report aggravated assaults, bur
glaries, motor-vehicle thefts, mur
ders, robberies and sex offenses.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marv Herrington. the law re

quires universities to "open up and
respond more like city jurisdic
tions."
Universities must also provide
more information about hate
crimes occurring on campus. Police
are now required to register crimes
resulting from prejudice based on
race, religion, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, gender or disability ac
cording to where they occurred on
campus, such as a street address or
in a particular residence.
The law seeks to record a more
accurate picture of the number of
sexual assaults on campuses by in
cluding all sexual assaults, even if
only reported to a counselor and
not directly to police, in its statis
tics. Stanford has already initiated
this policy; in the Stanford Almanac
there are statistics for sexual as
saults on campus reported to the
police and for sexual assaults re
ported to other authorities.
According to Herrington, Stan
lord has had the same policy as sur
rounding jurisdictions for 30 years.
"Most of the stuff is [already] desig
nated hy state law," he said. The
Stanford police department will
only have to make minor changes in
terms of statistical recording, Her
rington said.
Herrington applauded the new
law as an "effort to make campuses
safer." The most significant change
resulting from the law, according to
Herrington, is that crimes judged
within the campus judiciary system
will he reported to the federal gov
ernment. The law "gives parents
and incoming students and others
who are interested an idea, a pic
ture. of the crime rate on campus."
I le warned that the statistics are

only helpful in determining how
Stanford compares with surround
ing communities and should not he
used in comparing Stanford to a
more urban university, such as Co
lumbia University in New York
City.
Many critics claim that the law
comes with too many bureaucratic
entanglements.
"As changes pass into law, it's
generally not very clear exactly how
we should comply," Herrington
said.
The law adds hours of extra pa
perwork, which many police de
partments fear could result in fewer
officers on the streets. Also, many
departments fear the $25,(XX) fine
levied if there is not adequate com
pliance with the new law.
Herrington added, though, that
"the main thrust of the legislation is
positive."
The act also takes away financial
aid from students who are convict
ed of certain drug offenses. Stu
dents can begin to receive federal
student aid again if they complete a
treatment program.
