Newly increased funding has eased an anticipated
$ 1.5-million funding deficit for doctoral programs at
the School of Medicine.
The National Institutes of Health approved a train

medical doctoral students were given a substantial

stipend increase.
"While the departmental and interdepartmental
programs have had to stretch to find support, they have

with a full stipend, tuition coverage and health insur
ance," said Carl Rhodes, associate dean of medical stu

tional training grants, and research grant funds."
Administrators at the School of Medicine were wor

insurance costs and decreasing government support,
but this year's funding from the NIH has relieved these
concerns.
Both additional funds from the Dean of the Medical
School Eugene Bauer and the Stanford Graduate Fel
lowships support students as well. These fellowships

superbly qualified students." Rhodes said.
Though Rhodes foresees that for the coming 1999-

20(H) year it will he necessary to provide a modest in
crease in students' stipends, the NIH training grants, in
addition to the possibility of higher compensation
from departmental research grants, will offset the
stipend increases.
The other issue facing graduate students last year,
including those in the medical school, was the lack of
affordable housing. Students held a campout in the
