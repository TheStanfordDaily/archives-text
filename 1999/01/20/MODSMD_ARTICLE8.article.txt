# NIH funding helps medical doctoral students out of crisis
##

Newly increased funding has eased an anticipated
$ 1.5-million funding deficit for doctoral programs at
the School of Medicine.
The National Institutes of Health approved a train
ing grant increase for Stanford, and the school decided
to give the money to graduate programs. As a result,
medical doctoral students were given a substantial

stipend increase.
"While the departmental and interdepartmental
programs have had to stretch to find support, they have
managed to support all students who entered this fall
with a full stipend, tuition coverage and health insur
ance," said Carl Rhodes, associate dean of medical stu
dent and graduate student affairs. "They used a com
bination of departmental or program funds, institu
tional training grants, and research grant funds."
Administrators at the School of Medicine were wor

ried last winter because of growing stipend and health
insurance costs and decreasing government support,
but this year's funding from the NIH has relieved these
concerns.
Both additional funds from the Dean of the Medical
School Eugene Bauer and the Stanford Graduate Fel
lowships support students as well. These fellowships
"have been a great help in recruiting and supporting
superbly qualified students." Rhodes said.
Though Rhodes foresees that for the coming 1999-

20(H) year it will he necessary to provide a modest in
crease in students' stipends, the NIH training grants, in
addition to the possibility of higher compensation
from departmental research grants, will offset the
stipend increases.
The other issue facing graduate students last year,
including those in the medical school, was the lack of
affordable housing. Students held a campout in the
Quad last spring in protest, demon
strating the dire situation of the stu
dents, according to Stephanie To
ering, chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Housing Advisory Commit
tee.
As a result. Provost Condoleez
za Rice arranged to lease about 2(X)
apartments close to campus and
offer them to students at subsidized
rates for two years.
In the long run, the University is
committed to building additional
housing. This will not occur, how
ever, until the fall of 2(KK).
"The University has done a fair
ly good job with the housing
arrangements, which is a big reason
why things aren't as bad as they
could be," said Vikas Duvvuri,
president of the Biomedical Asso
ciation of Stanford Students.
"As the stipends have gone up
and the housing situation is much
better, there is a definite improve
ment over last year."

The increase in the stipends
proves to Duvvuri that "regardless
of shortfalls, the University is com
mitted to keeping up with stipends
elsewhere."
Rhodes indicated that the bud
get deficit has not scared away po
tential students.
The number of students matric
ulating has been relatively stable
for biology and biomedical pro
grams as a whole. "For the current
admissions season, our applica
tions are about 5 percent higher
than last year."
He went on to add. "I don't feel
that our programs have suffered,
because we continue to attract such
good students, competing with
UCSF, UC-Berkeley and Har
vard."
According to Duvvuri, now that
students' immediate concerns have
been addressed, their attention has
shifted to the issue of the job mar
ket.
"Career issues have become
more prominent. Students are
wondering "What next?' The focus
is clearly on the future."
