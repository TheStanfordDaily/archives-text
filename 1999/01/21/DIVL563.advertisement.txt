Analog Design Engineers
If you are graduanng with an BS/MWhD EE with very strong analog design skills,
these positions/will provide the opportunity to learn advanced IC design while
developing systems engineering «xills. Design Engineers will have the chance to
work BiCMOS/CMOS process technologies. You will also design and
devejtfp analog and mixed-signal ICs, including chip definition, circuit design,
sirflulation, layout supervision, debug, characterization and release to production.
Test Development Engineers
If yOu are graduating with a BS/MS EE, enjoy working on analog and mixed-signal
circuits, aryrfnave computer programming skills, our Test Development
Enginptffing opportunities may be your ticket. You will use your understanding of
and digital circuits to design hardware and software that performs complex
electrical screening of our mixed-signal ICs on automatic test equipment. You will
insure this testing correlates to laboratory benchmarks. You will work closely with
our IC Design, Product and Applications Engineers to define and implement a test
program that guarantees parametric and functional operation of the IC.
Product Engineers
If you are graduating with a BS/MS EE and have a preference for analog and
mixed-signal circuits, our Product Engineering positions may be of interest to you.
Strong analog skills are integral, as you will evaluate, characterize and introduce
new products to manufacturing. You will also be responsible for analyzing,
enhancing and forecasting Wafer Sort and Final Test yields and supporting produc
tion to resolve product issues.
Product Marketing Engineers
lined up for you.
If you're graduating with a BSEE and have a strong desire to be involved in market
ing, product launch and promotion, with an eye on becoming a Product Manager,
this position will get you up to speed in a hurry. You'll be responsible for manag
ing specific products and reporting to a senior marketing manager, while actively
participating in product definition, planning and execution of marketing strategies
and promotions. 0-3 years' of marketing or application experience desired.
