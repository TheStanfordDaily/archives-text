# Security measures expand gradually
## No big changes despite crimes; ASSU to fund increased SURE, Marguerite service 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Despite several high-profile
crimes that have occurred on cam
pus recently, Stanford police and
University officials report that no
major changes in security policy are
necessary or forthcoming to prevent
such incidents in the future.
Instead, officials stress that, on a
campus as large and open as Stan
ford's. crimes are hound to occur pe
riodically. "In a community of
30.0(H). things happen from time to
time." said Stanford Police Chief
Marv Herrington, referring to the
campus's daytime population.
Meanwhile, the ASSU is plan
ning to take action of its own to
boost campus security. The Senate
recently approved a grant to the
SURE Escort Service to expand its
service, and is considering addition
al funding for the service. The
ASSU is also exploring the possibil
ity of extending the Marguerite
shuttle service later into the night on
weekdays.

Recent events raise concern
In the last few months, several
crimes have occurred that have pro
voked concern within the Stanford
community.
Last week, a facilities supervisor
was assaulted and robbed while at
tempting to stop an alleged bike
thief behind Roble Hall.
According to Det. Allen James,
the officer in charge of the investiga
tion, Stanford police have no new
leads.
Earlier this month, a man threat
ened to expose himself to four fe
male students in the Wilbur Hall
parking lot. Though the incident was
not treated as a crime, the police at
tempted to identify the man for
"suspicious behavior."
Meanwhile, in October, a Stan
ford woman was attacked on Roble
Field by a man who took her under
wear. According to Herrington, the
investigation into that crime is still
open, though no suspects have been
identified.

Current patrol deemed adequate
Herrington said that University
police currently patrol the campus
on a "three-beat" system. They have
divided the campus into three zones
and attempt to ensure that an officer
is monitoring each zone in a police
car at all times.
However, Herrington added that
they "are still in the process of trying
to fill all our slots," as they are cur
rently recruiting officers for four pa
trol shifts.
"Our normal patrol setup is to
have a presence on campus, first as a
deterrent... and also as people are
more likely to report crimes that
they see," he said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
people must remember that the
campus is always vulnerable to
crime.
"We must make people aware of
the fact that Stanford is not insulat
ed from people being a victim of a
theft or even an assault On the
whole, we have a safe campus but we
