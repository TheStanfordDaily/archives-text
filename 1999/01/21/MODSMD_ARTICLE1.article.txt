# Security measures expand gradually
## No big changes despite crimes; ASSU to fund increased SURE, Marguerite service 
### Anuj Gupta Contributing writer 
Despite several high-profile
crimes that have occurred on cam
pus recently, Stanford police and
University officials report that no
major changes in security policy are
necessary or forthcoming to prevent
such incidents in the future.
Instead, officials stress that, on a
campus as large and open as Stan
ford's. crimes are hound to occur pe
riodically. "In a community of
30.0(H). things happen from time to
time." said Stanford Police Chief
Marv Herrington, referring to the
campus's daytime population.
Meanwhile, the ASSU is plan
ning to take action of its own to
boost campus security. The Senate
recently approved a grant to the
SURE Escort Service to expand its
service, and is considering addition
al funding for the service. The
ASSU is also exploring the possibil
ity of extending the Marguerite
shuttle service later into the night on
weekdays.

Recent events raise concern
In the last few months, several
crimes have occurred that have pro
voked concern within the Stanford
community.
Last week, a facilities supervisor
was assaulted and robbed while at
tempting to stop an alleged bike
thief behind Roble Hall.
According to Det. Allen James,
the officer in charge of the investiga
tion, Stanford police have no new
leads.
Earlier this month, a man threat
ened to expose himself to four fe
male students in the Wilbur Hall
parking lot. Though the incident was
not treated as a crime, the police at
tempted to identify the man for
"suspicious behavior."
Meanwhile, in October, a Stan
ford woman was attacked on Roble
Field by a man who took her under
wear. According to Herrington, the
investigation into that crime is still
open, though no suspects have been
identified.

Current patrol deemed adequate
Herrington said that University
police currently patrol the campus
on a "three-beat" system. They have
divided the campus into three zones
and attempt to ensure that an officer
is monitoring each zone in a police
car at all times.
However, Herrington added that
they "are still in the process of trying
to fill all our slots," as they are cur
rently recruiting officers for four pa
trol shifts.
"Our normal patrol setup is to
have a presence on campus, first as a
deterrent... and also as people are
more likely to report crimes that
they see," he said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
people must remember that the
campus is always vulnerable to
crime.
"We must make people aware of
the fact that Stanford is not insulat
ed from people being a victim of a
theft or even an assault On the
whole, we have a safe campus but we

are not immune," Wais said.
Herrington echoed Wais' senti
ments, saying that the police cannot
be expected to stop all crime from
occurring.
"We are focusing on what kind of
crime is going on currently and try
ing to move our resources around,"
he said. "There are all sorts of prob
lem areas that we can work on, don't
have enough resources to do all of
them. No police department does."
Blue-light phones play key role
One step that the University has
taken in recent years to increase
public safety is the installation of the
"blue-light" emergency phones
around campus. While about 70
phones are presently installed, Her
rington said the police have a target
of about 100 total phones.
Wais pointed out that the phones
are expensive. "I believe they can
cost up to $25,000 apiece," he said.
Herrington confirmed that the
cost of a phone can run that high if a
phone is installed far from electrical
and telephone line connections.
However, Herrington said he is
happy with the way the phone sys
tem has worked thus far.
"They're providing the service
that we want them to provide: the
ability for people to contact us in
some areas of campus where phones
aren't easily accessible," he said.
According to Herrington, all of
"the most critical areas" are now
covered by the phones.
SURE Escort to get a boost
Another major program aimed at
campus security is the SURE Escort
Service. SURE allows students to
call for a golf cart escort home from
anywhere on campus seven days a
week, from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
However, SURE has been
plagued with maintenance and fund
ing problems in the past. But recent
ly, the ASSU approved a $2,500
grant to SURE to help purchase of a

new cart, which will cost $6,500.
SURE currently runs two carts
nightly and has a third cart that is not
working at present. Senior
Nathaniel Boswell, SURE manager,
said he hopes that enough funding
can eventually be obtained to fix the
remaining cart and pay for addition
al drivers, thereby boosting the num
ber of carts each night to four.
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin said he supports addi
tional funding for SURE.
"I think it's a very good step in the
right direction, because there are
times when the carts are broken
down. Ideally with more funding to
have more people on staff ... we
won't have such a long response
time, and that's very important,"
Marroquin said.
Marguerite helps students be safe
According to Marroquin, the free
Marguerite shuttle service is another
piece in the puzzle of campus safety.
Last November, the ASSU se
cured approval for the Marguerite
Midnight Express service, which
now allows Stanford students to get
around campus and into and out of
downtown Palo Alto on weekend
nights from 8 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
Marroquin said that he hopes the
next step for the Marguerite would
be an extension until midnight of its
weekday service, which currently
runs until 8 p.m.
"We have a lot of grad students as
well as undergrads working around
campus late into the evening, and
they can't just be walking around on
campus at such hours of the night,"
Marroquin said.
Marroquin and ASSU President
Maren Norton met with Marguerite
officials yesterday to discuss the ex
tended Marguerite shuttle service.
Norton confirmed that the Mid
night Express weekend service is
here to stay, as funding has been se
cured to maintain it next year.
She added that the proposal to
extend weeknight service is "on the
table and under discussion," though
funding issues will have to be re
solved before any decision is made.

won't have such a long response
time, and that's very important,"
Marroquin said.
Marguerite helps students be safe
According to Marroquin, the free
Marguerite shuttle service is another
piece in the puzzle of campus safety.
Last November, the ASSU se
cured approval for the Marguerite
Midnight Express service, which
now allows Stanford students to get
around campus and into and out of
downtown Palo Alto on weekend
nights from 8 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.
Marroquin said that he hopes the
next step for the Marguerite would
be an extension until midnight of its
weekday service, which currently
runs until 8 p.m.
"We have a lot of grad students as
well as undergrads working around
campus late into the evening, and
they can't just be walking around on
campus at such hours of the night,"
Marroquin said.
Marroquin and ASSU President
Maren Norton met with Marguerite
officials yesterday to discuss the ex
tended Marguerite shuttle service.
Norton confirmed that the Mid
night Express weekend service is
here to stay, as funding has been se
cured to maintain it next year.
She added that the proposal to
extend weeknight service is "on the
table and under discussion," though
funding issues will have to be re
solved before any decision is made.
Despite several high-profile
crimes that have occurred on cam
pus recently, Stanford police and
University officials report that no
major changes in security policy are
necessary or forthcoming to prevent
such incidents in the future.
Instead, officials stress that, on a
campus as large and open as Stan
ford's. crimes are hound to occur pe
riodically. "In a community of
30.0(H). things happen from time to
time." said Stanford Police Chief
Marv Herrington, referring to the
campus's daytime population.
Meanwhile, the ASSU is plan
ning to take action of its own to
boost campus security. The Senate
recently approved a grant to the
SURE Escort Service to expand its
service, and is considering addition
al funding for the service. The
ASSU is also exploring the possibil
ity of extending the Marguerite
shuttle service later into the night on
weekdays.

Recent events raise concern
In the last few months, several
crimes have occurred that have pro
voked concern within the Stanford
community.
Last week, a facilities supervisor
was assaulted and robbed while at
tempting to stop an alleged bike
thief behind Roble Hall.
According to Det. Allen James,
the officer in charge of the investiga
tion, Stanford police have no new
leads.
Earlier this month, a man threat
ened to expose himself to four fe
male students in the Wilbur Hall
parking lot. Though the incident was
not treated as a crime, the police at
tempted to identify the man for
"suspicious behavior."
Meanwhile, in October, a Stan
ford woman was attacked on Roble
Field by a man who took her under
wear. According to Herrington, the
investigation into that crime is still
open, though no suspects have been
identified.

Current patrol deemed adequate
Herrington said that University
police currently patrol the campus
on a "three-beat" system. They have
divided the campus into three zones
and attempt to ensure that an officer
is monitoring each zone in a police
car at all times.
However, Herrington added that
they "are still in the process of trying
to fill all our slots," as they are cur
rently recruiting officers for four pa
trol shifts.
"Our normal patrol setup is to
have a presence on campus, first as a
deterrent... and also as people are
more likely to report crimes that
they see," he said.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
people must remember that the
campus is always vulnerable to
crime.
"We must make people aware of
the fact that Stanford is not insulat
ed from people being a victim of a
theft or even an assault On the
whole, we have a safe campus but we

are not immune," Wais said.
Herrington echoed Wais' senti
ments, saying that the police cannot
be expected to stop all crime from
occurring.
"We are focusing on what kind of
crime is going on currently and try
ing to move our resources around,"
he said. "There are all sorts of prob
lem areas that we can work on, don't
have enough resources to do all of
them. No police department does."
Blue-light phones play key role
One step that the University has
taken in recent years to increase
public safety is the installation of the
"blue-light" emergency phones
around campus. While about 70
phones are presently installed, Her
rington said the police have a target
of about 100 total phones.
Wais pointed out that the phones
are expensive. "I believe they can
cost up to $25,000 apiece," he said.
Herrington confirmed that the
cost of a phone can run that high if a
phone is installed far from electrical
and telephone line connections.
However, Herrington said he is
happy with the way the phone sys
tem has worked thus far.
"They're providing the service
that we want them to provide: the
ability for people to contact us in
some areas of campus where phones
aren't easily accessible," he said.
According to Herrington, all of
"the most critical areas" are now
covered by the phones.
SURE Escort to get a boost
Another major program aimed at
campus security is the SURE Escort
Service. SURE allows students to
call for a golf cart escort home from
anywhere on campus seven days a
week, from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
However, SURE has been
plagued with maintenance and fund
ing problems in the past. But recent
ly, the ASSU approved a $2,500
grant to SURE to help purchase of a

new cart, which will cost $6,500.
SURE currently runs two carts
nightly and has a third cart that is not
working at present. Senior
Nathaniel Boswell, SURE manager,
said he hopes that enough funding
can eventually be obtained to fix the
remaining cart and pay for addition
al drivers, thereby boosting the num
ber of carts each night to four.
ASSU Vice President Santos
Marroquin said he supports addi
tional funding for SURE.
"I think it's a very good step in the
right direction, because there are
times when the carts are broken
down. Ideally with more funding to
have more people on staff ... we
won't have such a long response
time, and that's very important,"
Marroquin said.
