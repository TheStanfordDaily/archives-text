BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — NATO ambassadors
dispatched frigates, destroyers and planes closer to
Yugoslavia on Wednesday after hard-line Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic rebuffed their demands
to halt the fighting in Kosovo.
Still, they sought a diplomatic solution to defuse the
crisis — a position underlined by U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, who warned separatists in
Kosovo not to expect NA TO to do their bidding on the
battlefield.
"We don't intend to be an air force for"the Kosovo
Liberation Army, Cohen told a news conference in
Washington, urging both sides to stop violating last
October's cease-fire agreement.
Meanwhile, new fighting erupted Wednesday in
northern Kosovo between Serb police and ethnic Alba
nians fighting to secede from Yugoslavia, killing at least
two rebels and leaving a Serb mother and her two chil
dren injured.
Milosevic staved off NATO airstrikes last October
with a last-minute promise to reduce Serb forces in
Kosovo, but he is not listening to the West this time.
"We were not surprised, but we were disappointed
by the very stubborn and obdurate reaction we encoun
tered in Belgrade," Gen. Wesley Clark, the allied com
mander in Europe, said Wednesday after 7 1/2 hours of
talks that he and Gen. Klaus Naumann held a day ear
lier with Milosevic.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will go to
London and Paris next week to discuss Kosovo, among
other concerns.
The 16 NATO ambassadors stressed after a meeting
of the North Atlantic Council that they had not given

up on a diplomatic solution for Kosovo. Nonetheless,
they made "precautionary" military moves.
They shortened pilots' readiness time for airstrikes
from % to 48 hours and moved NATO's Strike Force
South, which includes the American carrier USS Enter
prise, from the Aegean into the Adriatic Sea, closer to
Yugoslavia.
NATO commanders also positioned six frigates and
two destroyers in the Italian port of Brindisi, opposite
Yugoslavia.
More than 4(K) allied aircraft remain on standby
under an "activation order" from October that was
never rescinded, including 200 planes that under
NATO command. Others planes were being reactivat
ed, including four Danish F-16 jets that were being
flown back to Italy for possible NATO airstrikes.
Nearly 2,000 people have died and hundreds of
thousands were driven from their homes during fight
ing in Kosovo last year between Yugoslav army and
police forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's 2 million residents. Kosovo is
a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
Clark and Naumann went to Belgrade on Tuesday
to warn Milosevic of the gravity of the situation. Milo
sevic was unimpressed, saying no "pressure from out
side" could dissuade him Ironi his "legitimate right to
fight terrorism."
The Council is demanding that Milosevic comply his
commitments to international organizations, including
NATO.
These commitments include reducing Yugoslav
army and police forces in Kosovo and cooperating with
the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.
