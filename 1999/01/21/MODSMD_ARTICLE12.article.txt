# Clinton faces political, financial barriers to Social Security idea
## Investment plans criticized 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —President
Clinton wants to invest nearly $7(X)
billion in Social Security reserves in
stocks, hut market watchers believe
the ambitious plan will face too
many political obstacles to have
much impact on the long-running
bull market.
And objections raised today bv
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan could make it that much
harder for the idea to become a
reality.
Clinton's proposal, unveiled
Tuesday in his State of the Union
address, must conquer worries
about the wisdom of investing
Americans' retirement money in
potentially volatile stocks — espe
cially amid persistent fears that
stock prices may already be too
high.
"Ultimately, 1 think it
happens — but I think it happens
with such a small sliver of the Social
Security pie that it will not have a
noteworthy effect on stocks in the
near term," said Charles Crane,
chief market strategist at Key Asset
Management.
Clinton proposed using more
than $2.7 trillion in expected budget
surpluses over the next 15 years —

or 62 percent of the total —to
directly bolster Social Security's
cash reserves. Of that, nearly $7(X)
billion would be invested in the
stock market by an independent
government board in hopes of gain
ing higher returns.
The rest would be kept, as they
are now, in safer but historically
lower-yielding U.S. Treasury
bonds.
But Greenspan told the House
Ways and Means Committee today
he was concerned that investment
decisions for Social Security would
be influenced by political pressures.
Moreover, he said, the plan is
bad for the economy. Social Securi
ty purchases of stocks would chan
nel trillions of dollars over the years
into U.S. companies; that would
allow some industries to become
less efficient because government
action, and not market forces, are
deciding which companies should
be funded.
"I am fearful that we would use
those assets in a way that would cre
ate a lower rate of return for Social
Security recipients and even greater
concern it would create sub-optimal
use of capital and a lower standard
of living," Greenspan said.

Also standing in the proposal's
path are Republicans who oppose
government participation in private
financial markets, preferring to sfce
Social Security money diverted into
personal accounts. Clinton is sicfing
with Democrats who say that wojrtd
expose Americans to too mt£ch
financial risk.
"So far the market regards tfris
possible outcome with keen intoir :
est, but without tremendous convic
tion," said Tom Madden, chief
investment officer for domess<;
equities at Federated Investors. He
added that the impeachment tsjal
raises the issue of how long it will
take to implement the initiative.^.'
Fears also remain that stodks
have climbed too fast and are t«0
risky. Some analysts pointed out |ke
appeal of the current system: it's
safe.
"People are probably scratchihg
their heads and saying the SoeiaJ
Security system ... is missing out
on great investment opportunities
by not having been in the markelin
the last eight years. But widows and
orphans also haven't lost mofiey
either at any point," said Arthur
Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeff
fries & Co.
