Study finds high-fiber diet may not
reduce cancer risk
Contradicting years of dietary wisdom, a large
new study found no evidence that eating lots of high
fiber foods such as bran, beans and whole wheat
bread does anything to lower the risk of colon cancer.
But don't put down that apple yet: Previous stud
ies have found that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables
and whole grains has other health benefits, including
reducing the risk of heart disease, high blood pres
sure and certain types of diabetes.
The study, published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, tracked the colon and rectal
health of 88,757 women who participated in the Har
vard-based Nurses Health Study over 16 years. It is
one of the biggest cancer studies of its kind ever
undertaken.
From 1 c >8() to IW6. 787 of the women developed
cancer of the colon or the rectum. The risk was the

same, regardless of how much fiber they ate. The
researchers said they believe the findings apply tg
men as well.

Dr. Charles S. Fuchs and his colleagues at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and*
Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School said
they were astounded to find that women who ate
low-fiber foods were no more likely to develop colon
cancer than those who stuck to bran muffins and
broccoli.
"As a practicing physician and as a researcher, this
is a hypothesis that has stood the test of time," Fuchs
said.
"There has been such an abundant enthusiasm for
this hypothesis, so the important message here is that
fiber, overall, has no protective effect."
However, he said the benefits of fiber in protect
ing against other problems like high blood pressure
and heart disease — the No. 1 killer in the country —
are undeniable.
