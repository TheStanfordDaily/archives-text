Saturday is not an event just for those
involved in art and art history. This amaz
ing collection of beauty is something for
everyone at Stanford to enjoy.
Instead of just going to look at pictures,
students should take this opportunity to
fully experience art. No longer will it be
necessary to trek to San Francisco to
enjoy the treasures of the world; great
works are right at home. The ability to
walk over during lunch or spend a Sunday
afternoon once a month at the Museum
allows more opportunities to study arid
appreciate art than rare opportunities to
drive to a nearby museum.
An on-campus museum lets students
view art slowly and over a period of time,
allowing those supremely sublime quali
ties that define artistry to shine. More
importantly, by providing a museum on
campus, Stanford is able to broaden the
education of the entire Stanford commu
nity, including those who may not have
otherwise had such an opportunity or
inclination to visit a museum.
In light of the recent criticisms that
allege negligence of the humanities, the
new center should reaffirm Stanford's
commitment to excellence in the arts and
humanities. The School of Humanities
and Sciences, which is celebrating its 50th
anniversary this year, will undoubtedly
benefit from the center, as it provides an
immense resource for academic research.
It is often said that a picture is worth a
thousand words. We encourage you to
come to Saturday's re-opening of the
museum, take a look at one picture (and
hopefully a few others while you are
there), and, if the saying holds, experi
ence more than could ever possibly be
expressed in this small space of words.
