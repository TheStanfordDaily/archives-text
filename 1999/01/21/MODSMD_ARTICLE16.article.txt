JCLA players should
yet positive example
I shared lirian Eule's disgust ("UCLA
fftcds to grow up." Jan. I 1 )) with the UCLA
l";nt 111 ills' childish behavior at the end of last
Saturday's game at Pauley. Having grown
up in I A ;is a UCLA fan during their
dynasty years, I expect more from both the
IjCLA fans and their players, particulary
jfSiron Davis.
In Davis defense, however, I recall that
Lee had to apologize after making
(hat unfortunate choke sign during the end
of last year's emotional NCAA tournament
game against Rhode Island. Let's hope that
Davis can learn from his mistake, as Lee
has, and begins to measure up to the classy
standards set by players such as Walton and
Jabbar. Let's also hope Davis gets to exhib
tNJiis learning as the Bruins get beaten by 25
when they visit Maples in February.

Whites should challenge
their ignorance, apathy
jS I've been reflecting on Dan Geyser's
two columns on Jan 5 and 12 and the

responses that they have brought about.
Sadly absent is a response from anyone
white.
I have an idea of why no white person
has responded. It's a very tough position
to be in. It is much easier simply to think
to yourself, "I can't stand his column any
way," or worse, "Who really cares, it's just
a column in the Daily?" Perhaps you don't
know what the big deal is. Or maybe you
agree with him.
In many ways I understand where Dan
is coming from. Trust me, I've said many
of the same things Dan said in his columns
and I was baffled by the response I
received, too. It has taken a lot of educa
tion and open-mindedness to get past that
stage in my life. And even after passing
that stage, 1 know there is still an incredi
ble amount to learn.
How many times have you said that you
don't see race, or that you think that
everyone should be treated equally? 1
admit that I have said both of these state
ments and. believing them, have not
understood why society wouldn't be per
fect if only everyone believed them too. I
was saying, "Go find those intolerant peo
ple and change them. Then we'll be fine."
We need to understand that ethnic
groups are not separating themselves by
having their own organizations on cam

pus, in the community and across the
nation. We need to understand that the
problem is not that they can't relate to us.
They aren't the problem. We are. The
problem is our ignorance, our intolerance
and our apathy. Many of us can not relate
to non-whites, or if we do, it's on our
terms, and as a whole we don't care
enough to even try.
Minority groups then turn to ethnic cen
ters for understanding and support because
they don't get it from us. And even if they
did get that support from us, the ethnic cen
ters would be a source of people who have
shared common experiences.
If we do not try to overcome our igno
rance, intolerance or apathy, we're essen
tially saying, "What does it really matter
to us if we know anything about Kwanzaa
or Ramadan? As long as we can continue
to live in the usual way, they can do what
they want." Imagine how intolerant and
selfish we sound as we say, "You can have
your own culture, your own race, just as
long as it doesn't inconvenience my life."
I write this to challenge everybody, not
just to condemn. We must make the effort
to broaden our minds, challenge our
beliefs and educate ourselves.
