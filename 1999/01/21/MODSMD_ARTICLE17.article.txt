## Struggling to attain patience 
### 
Lately, people
have been telling
me that I need to
work on my patience.
"John," they say, "you
need to work on your
patience." "Why?" I ask,
defensively.

"Because you don't have any," they
respond.
"Oh."
As someone whose ego is easily bruised
(when it's that big, there's lots of space to
injure), I have immediately made patience
a focus for the rest of my life. "John," I
said to myself, "you need to work on your
patience." As such, 1 now resolve to be
more composed, more accepting of the
present, less inclined to worry about the
future and a better human being overall.
Phew. That was easy.
But, seriously, patience isn't easy to
develop from scratch. It takes a long time
to get there; you've got to be patient to be,
well, patient.
So in accordance with my new goals and
aspirations, I've assembled a few ways in
which I, John Davi, can instantly become
more patient. Right here, right now — this
very second —I can become the patient
individual I have longed to be for three
days. Perhaps those of you who have also
struggled to become patient can learn
from my examples. Simply say these words
to yourself, and with newfound confidence
and assurance, you'll be patient in no time.
I almost guarantee it.
I can wait until the end of class.
Yes, you can. You can keep your note
book open until the professor stops lectur

ing. You can wait until the person at the
end of your row ties his shoes, combs his
hair, rearranges his binder and only then
gets up to leave. You can make it to the
bitter end, until that minute hand reaches
"50," or even, gasp, "52." At least it'll give
you some time to work on the crossword,
right?
I can ride past the Bookstore or the
clock tower without endangering anyone
else.
Sure, you can. Just slow it up a little.
Take a deep breath, remove your feet
from the pedals and gently coast your way
through the tricky spots. Brake early and
often, or, better yet, just put your newspa
per down. Breathe deeply and smile as
you admire the many students who popu
late this fine university. Just don't run into
any of them.
I can wait for the Stairmaster at Tresid
der.
Yes, you can. As important as your
workout is for knocking off that extra bite
of bagel you had at breakfast last Tuesday,
it's okay if you don't get going immediate
ly. Stretch out. Relax. Go jogging in the
rain instead. Or, better yet, just give up
and have another bagel. Mmm. Cinnamon
raisin.
I can wait in line at Jamba Juice.
Yes, you can. You can wait a few
moments for the delicious, frosty goodness
of the Jamba sensation. You can survive
the ordering line, all the while salivating
over the impending flavor of Citrus
Squeeze, Orange Oasis, Mayonnaise and
Ice, or whatever the flavor of the month
happens to be. You can resist the urge to
be "Javier," even though his smoothie is

the same as yours, but ready 10 minutes
earlier. Why don't you pick up one of
those oat-cake thingies to eat while you
wait? It's okay; you can Stairmaster it off
next week.
I can wait in line at the post office.
Oh, shoot. Screw that; even God isn't
that patient.
I can accept that the world doesn't
revolve around me.
Yes, you can, because the world doesn't
revolve around you. Who do you think
you are, Fred Savage? Come on. You're
not that important. You're not on televi
sion. You don't even have tenure.
Honestly, 1 think the biggest part of
patience is realizing that things don't
always and won't always go your way.
Sometimes we have to be a little diligent in
waiting things out, in enjoying the present
moment for what it is. Regardless of what
we might be lacking, every day is another
day of life, another blessing in that we still
exist, and probably another day for which
to be pretty thankful.
I know that my own turnaround won't
come overnight. I know it might take a few
days, or even weeks, to become the per
fectly patient person I want to be. But this
newfound patience should help me live my
life to the fullest. I will greet each day with
enthusiasm and awe, and each one of my
fellow humans with respect, consideration
and love. I, John Davi, will once and for all
be patient.
I can't wait!
