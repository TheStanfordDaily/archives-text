# Good, clean fun
## Vanessa Bartsch Profiting from the other people's mistakes 
### 
GOOD LUCK IS made up of a few
parts. One part is preparation; that
is, putting yourself in a place
where things might happen.
112 or instance, if I am hypothetically try
ing to get up to Tahoe on a Friday evening,
I can choose to take the Dumbarton
Bridge instead of the Bay Bridge and have
a chance of getting off the Peninsula before
February.
Luck also involves a little planning.
Using the same example as above, we
could say that leaving at 2 p.m. and taking
chains will increase your chances of arriv
ing at Tahoe within the month.
Position and planning can only account
for so much luck. In the above case, I left
for Tahoe at 2 p.m., took the Dumbarton
and carried chains. However, an over
turned bus and unforeseen blizzard thwart
ed my position and preparation.
In this case, I was at the whim of an
even greater component to luck: people's
mistakes and the speed in which they make
them. In the case of my trip north, the bus
driver made a mistake and even with the
one police car and all three of the plows in

northern California on hand, the mistake
was slow to rectify.
That was unfortunate. Fortunately,
however, other peoples mistakes can also
bring some really good luck.
I remember getting my acceptance let
ter to Stanford, oh so many moons ago. I
didn't really expect to get in applying from
a town of 3,000 people where my public
high school held less people than CIV sec
tion.
It also didn't help that I had, as they say,
"lost interest" and barely finished in that
mandatory top 10th while missing some
obscene number of classes. But I applied,
on the reasoning that I hadn't taken those
crummy SAT's the year before they were
re-centered for no reason.
You can imagine my shock as I pulled
the envelope out of the mailbox and real
ized it was too big to hold only one piece of
paper with just the words, "Ha! You wish
you were so lucky." Instead, inside was
that whole cocky-ass folder telling me how
cool I was.
So, I checked the address and name.
They were both mine. 1 even checked to

make sure they understood I had attended
a public high school.
But, no, it was to be. They actually sent
one of those puppies to me and I did what
any lucky soul would have done: I accept
ed, arrived, assimilated and kept my mouth
shut.
And I haven't really seen a reason to
question it yet. What they don't know
won't hurt them. But 1 am getting a little
antsy. With only a few months left here, I
am praying no one catches the part where
they confused me with my butt-kissing,
class president, salutatorian ex-boyfriend
who also applied and got rejected.
It's fine with me if it is Dean Montoya's
and my "little secret." But when they hand
me that diploma, I am going to grab it and
keep walking. No turning back. No reason
for them to figure it out now.
Luck also assured that I got my driver's
license. On the first try. Regardless of the
fact that, 1) I forgot to finish drivers' train
ing and was actually not legally allowed to
take the test; 2) During my drivers' test I
parked so poorly the first time that I was
inspired to back all the way across the lot

of the DMV into a tiny spot between two
trucks where I neglected to leave myself
enough room to get out of the car; and,
finally, 3) I am a terrible, terrible driver.
Nonetheless, I still have the license in
my wallet, and you'll see me bombing
down Campus Drive, rolling through stop
signs with reckless abandon. No reason to
question the DMV's omnipotent wisdom.
I'm even lucky enough to have really
neat friends, and this is pretty surprising
given that I am not exactly the most nor
mal person. I know how weird I am and
I'm pretty sure if 1 met me, I would be pret
ty frightened. All I can reason is that they
have me confused with someone else or
they all are on drugs.
There is also Residential Education,
(you know, the organization all the people
with bad Draw numbers hate because they
are too stupid to realize Housing and Din
ing runs the Draw). Res Ed has found it fit
to make me an resident assistant for the
second year in a row in a nice Row house
with impressionable sophomores.
Housing and Dining has also been mak
ing some pretty nice errors in my favor.

I've had a single for three years.
Blame it all on luck, but fortunately for
me, no one has yet to figure any of this oat.
This is A-OK with me. I could spend
countless hours wondering how I got here,
how I can be so lucky and everyone else
can make such silly mistake. But why
would I?
Instead, I appreciate every mistake they
have made and run with them. Do as much
as they will let me, test the limits, especial
ly with only five months to go.
Once I grab my diploma, celebrate with
my friends, run back to my single, grab as
many videos from Meyer as my RA lend
ing privilege will allow and head off to the
great composition job the rich music
patron has mistakenly given me, I might
look back and wonder.
I could even ask myself how I spent two
years writing columns. But for now, why
make waves?

Vanessa is a senior majoring in music. Bay,
are her parents going to mad when they find
out she really isn 't theirs.

given that I am not exactly the most nor
mal person. I know how weird I am and
I'm pretty sure if 1 met me, I would be pret
ty frightened. All I can reason is that they
have me confused with someone else or
they all are on drugs.
There is also Residential Education,
(you know, the organization all the people
with bad Draw numbers hate because they
are too stupid to realize Housing and Din
ing runs the Draw). Res Ed has found it fit
to make me an resident assistant for the
second year in a row in a nice Row house
with impressionable sophomores.
Housing and Dining has also been mak
ing some pretty nice errors in my favor.

I've had a single for three years.
Blame it all on luck, but fortunately for
me, no one has yet to figure any of this oat.
This is A-OK with me. I could spend
countless hours wondering how I got here,
how I can be so lucky and everyone else
can make such silly mistake. But why
would I?
Instead, I appreciate every mistake they
have made and run with them. Do as much
as they will let me, test the limits, especial
ly with only five months to go.
Once I grab my diploma, celebrate with
my friends, run back to my single, grab as
many videos from Meyer as my RA lend
ing privilege will allow and head off to the
great composition job the rich music
patron has mistakenly given me, I might
look back and wonder.
I could even ask myself how I spent two
years writing columns. But for now, why
make waves?

Vanessa is a senior majoring in music. Bay,
are her parents going to mad when they find
out she really isn 't theirs.
