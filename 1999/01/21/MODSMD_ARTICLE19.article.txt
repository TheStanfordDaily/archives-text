## No. 3 Cardinal returns home for Cougars Team ready to host Wazzu tonight 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
In general, statistics, records and past performances
are not nearly enough to accurately predict the outcome
of a game.
If there were ever a team that appears to be pre
dictable and play true to the numbers, however, it is this
year's third-ranked Stanford men's basketball team.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tonight: No. 3 Stanford (15-2. 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) vs. Washington State (K-N, 2-3). 7:30 p.m. Maples
Pavilion. TV: Fox Sports Bay Area (SCTV 49). RADIO:
KTCT (1050 AM), KZSIJ (90.1 FM).

Its five games in the Pacific 10 Conference have been
eerilv similar, as evidenced by the quintet of final scores:
72-56,77-59,71-62,72-55.72-59.
Stanford seems to be a mere computer of basketball
execution and performance — head coach Mike Mont
gomery implements a game plan founded in several con
sistent fundamentals (solid defense, good rebounding
and offensive patience), and his team always returns a
similar product.
The predictable nature of Stanford basketball gives
off the impression that maybe the pre-game numbers
will tell the story of the contest.
Which is bad news for Washington State, which will

visit Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m. to face the Car
dinal, the only undefeated team in the Pac-1().
Simply put, the Cougars (8-8,2-3 Pac-10) thrive on a
limited number of strengths. And in every single area of
success for Washington State, Stanford has an effective
counter.
The Cougars are the top three-point shooting team in
the conference, nailing 41 percent of its shots from long
distance. Stanford answers with the Pac-10's leading
three-point defense, allowing opponents to convert just
27 percent from downtown.
Washington State has the second most potent scoring
offense in the Pac-10, averaging a little over 78 points a
ball game.
Stanford counters with the best defense in confer
ence, holding opponents to 55 points per game and 37
percent shooting. Only two Cardinal opponents have
scored more than 60 points all season long.
Then there are the areas in which the Cougars strug
gle. In almost every such category, the Cardinal has had
great success.
For example, Washington State is the worst re
bounding team in the Pac-10, Stanford the second best.
The Cougars are dead last in assist-to-turnover ratio,
and Stanford sits atop the conference leaders.
The inability to rebound or cause turnovers, in par
ticular. seems to doom Wazzu. If Stanford can control

team as they take on Washington State tonight.
the offensive glass and keep the
Cougars from getting out on the fast
break, the game will come down to
half-court offensive execution.
Which is the Cardinal's strength.
"Your ability to challenge on the
offensive boards [helps create an
up-tempo game]." Montgomery
said. "If you have a team that likes
to run on all misses, then every time
you miss they're theoretically want
ing to come out on the run. If you
don't offensively rebound and are
not a very good offensive team, then
there's going to be way more oppor
tunities for a team to know they can
rebound and know they can outlet
and get their people down the
floor."
The fact that Washington State
can knock down three pointers,
however, may be its ace in the hole.
In particular, Jan-Michael
Thomas hits 47 percent of his shots
from beyond the arc (No. 2 in the
Pac-10, behind Stanford's Arthur
Lee). It isa safe bet that Thomas will
be firing away tonight, as the junior
transfer has already attempted 121
shots from three-point land.
The Cardinal will start the se
nior-laden group of Arthur Lee,
Kris Weems, Peter Sauer. Tim
Young and Mark Madsen for the
23rdgfcecutive game. Madsen. a
is the only Stanford
player in the top 20 scorers in the
Pac-10 (12.7 ppg).
Stanford has won five straight
against Washington State, and will
look to extend its current overall
w inning streak to 12.
