## No. 3 Cardinal returns home for Cougars Team ready to host Wazzu tonight 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
In general, statistics, records and past performances
are not nearly enough to accurately predict the outcome
of a game.
If there were ever a team that appears to be pre
dictable and play true to the numbers, however, it is this
year's third-ranked Stanford men's basketball team.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tonight: No. 3 Stanford (15-2. 5-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) vs. Washington State (K-N, 2-3). 7:30 p.m. Maples
Pavilion. TV: Fox Sports Bay Area (SCTV 49). RADIO:
KTCT (1050 AM), KZSIJ (90.1 FM).

Its five games in the Pacific 10 Conference have been
eerilv similar, as evidenced by the quintet of final scores:
72-56,77-59,71-62,72-55.72-59.
Stanford seems to be a mere computer of basketball
execution and performance — head coach Mike Mont
gomery implements a game plan founded in several con
sistent fundamentals (solid defense, good rebounding
and offensive patience), and his team always returns a
similar product.
The predictable nature of Stanford basketball gives
off the impression that maybe the pre-game numbers
will tell the story of the contest.
Which is bad news for Washington State, which will

visit Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m. to face the Car
dinal, the only undefeated team in the Pac-1().
Simply put, the Cougars (8-8,2-3 Pac-10) thrive on a
limited number of strengths. And in every single area of
success for Washington State, Stanford has an effective
counter.
The Cougars are the top three-point shooting team in
the conference, nailing 41 percent of its shots from long
distance. Stanford answers with the Pac-10's leading
three-point defense, allowing opponents to convert just
27 percent from downtown.
Washington State has the second most potent scoring
offense in the Pac-10, averaging a little over 78 points a
ball game.
Stanford counters with the best defense in confer
ence, holding opponents to 55 points per game and 37
percent shooting. Only two Cardinal opponents have
scored more than 60 points all season long.
Then there are the areas in which the Cougars strug
gle. In almost every such category, the Cardinal has had
great success.
For example, Washington State is the worst re
bounding team in the Pac-10, Stanford the second best.
The Cougars are dead last in assist-to-turnover ratio,
and Stanford sits atop the conference leaders.
The inability to rebound or cause turnovers, in par
ticular. seems to doom Wazzu. If Stanford can control
