## Revisions to SLE? 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Staff writer 
There is a strong likelihood that the program in Struc
tured Liberal Education, part of the University's Area
One Program, will face a number of changes for next year.
The revisions, contained in a report due out later this
month, will probably alter the job descriptions of a num
ber of SLE teaching faculty and aspects of the program's
curriculum said Prof. Emeritus of English Ronald Reb
holz, a member of the Area One Governance Committee.
The review is being carried out by the committee re
sponsible for the management of the Area One Program.
Under current policy, the 10-member faculty committee,
reviews all programs on a three year cycle, as with SLE this
year.
"The majority of the changes being discussed will, in
my opinion, move SLE in a positive direction," Rebholz
said. "We should know more when the report becomes
available."
The committee began its discussions this fall working in
conjunction with SLE Director Mark Mancall, Program
Coordinator Suzanne Greenberg and other members of
the SLE faculty.
Rebholz said that a number of al
terations were proposed during the
committee meetings, the most major
being the redesignation of SLE
teaching faculty from half-time to
full-time employees.
Currently SLE faculty members
teach on a half-time basis, frequently
having one section meeting each
evening. Many, like Senior Assoc.
Director of Admissions Jon Reider,
hold other positions at the Universi
ty-
"l work as an admissions director
in the Office of Admissions, but 1
have also served as a SLE faculty
member for almost 20 years," said
Reider, who was involved with dis
cussions on the proposals.
However, if the change is made,
faculty will sign three-year, full-time
teaching contracts exclusively with
SLE. Because this will prevent facul
ty from holding other positions. Reb
holz finds this suggestion "troubling."
"There is the possibility that it [the
proposed change] may force a num
ber of valued faculty members to
make a tough decision," Rebholz
said.
Reider is hopeful that the change
may not affect all of the programs
faculty.
"This decision would sort of ex
press what is an informal practice in a
formal way," he said. "My hope is
that some exceptions would be
made."
In addition to administrative pro
posals, Rebholz also cited two other
curricular revisions that may be im
plemented.
One change being discussed is a
reduction in the number of books
read each quarter. Currently around
10 books are read each quarter in
what both Rebholz and Reider call "a
very intense program." The proposal
could half the number of books.
"A concern of a number of people
was that a significant breadth of
works were covered, but in perhaps
not enough depth," said Rebholz.

Another suggestion that was
made, but quickly nixed, was the divi
sion of SLE as a 3-quarter sequence
into an independent fall quarter, fol
lowed by a winter and spring track.
The latter, identical to the current In
troduction to the Humanities tracks
(that will completely replace the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program next
year), was strongly opposed because
it would force the current book list to
be reordered.
"Aside from wreaking havoc on
the logical order in which the books
are read, the change wouldn't have
made sense," Rebholz said. "SLE is a
substantial and rewarding commit
ment that needs to be taken for the
entire three quarters."
Rebholz also believes that there
may be some changes in tutor train
ing for SLE's writing tutor program.
"Although no solutions have yet
been proposed, I think that it is an im
portant change that would greatly
strengthen the program." he said.
Rebholz is generally positive
about the proposed revisions.
"With the exception of the change
from half-time to full-time for faculty,
I fully support the issues that are cur
rently being discussed," Rebholz
added.
Reider agrees.
"The end goal is to make SLE an
even stronger program than it al
ready is," he said. "I think it will be."
Because these revisions are still
being discussed, a number of Area
One and SLE administrators were
unavailable for comment. Harry
Elam. director of the Area One Pro
gram. explained:
"We want to be very careful not to
start any rumors at this time," he said.
"All of us agreed that it would be best
not to comment until after the final
report is released."
Elam continued. "In the end,
everyone knows that SLE is a very
successful program that will be here
for, hopefully, many years to come.
Our job is to help it improve."
The Area One Governance Com
mittee's report on SLE is expected on
Jan. 25. Any changes contained
therein would be implemented for
the 1999-2(XK) school year.
