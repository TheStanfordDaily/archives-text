## Rugby Faces UA, ASU

After reaching the national
championship game for the first
time in school history last season,
Stanford men's rugby has a long
road ahead this year.
In an effort to raise the team's
competition level, coach Franck
Boivert has developed an extremely
difficult schedule for the Cardinal.
"I would say that it is the tough
est schedule of any American col
lege," said team captain Steve Pre
onas.
The next test for Stanford is a
match against Arizona, the top team
in the Southern California region,
on Jan. 23 in Arizona.
"It will be a tremendous test; it's
going to be a war out there," Pre
onas said.
Most rugby teams are bigger
than Stanford's simply because they
recruit from larger student popula
tions. In the past the Cardinal has
relied on its speed, technique and
experience to earn wins. But that
path has gotten a bit bumpy.
"We are not quite as experienced
as last year. We have some players
playing new positions; and how ac
climated they become [at their new
positions! will determine how far we
go," said Preonas.
The championship road for the
women's rugby team will he difficult
for completely different reasons.
Last year's national champions of
the smaller Plate Division are excit
ed about the combination of
women's rugby into one national di
vision that will result in a spring
tournament similar to that of the
men.
Stanford is part of the Northern
California region that will only send
one representative, the regional
champion, to the Sweet Sixteen.
That puts a lot of pressure on every
single match.
Team president Lara Strauss
said the toughest opponents should
be UC-Davis. Humboldt and Cal.
When Stanford travels to Hum
boldt University in early February it
will face a number of women with
strong experience down the difficult
road of rugby.
Perhaps the most difficult test of
the season will come on March 6.
when the Golden Bears come to the
Farm.
"The rivalry on the women's side
is big because of the rivalry on the
men's side," Strauss said.
This weekend, the Cardinal
women will also head to Arizona.
