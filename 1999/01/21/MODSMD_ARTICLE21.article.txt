# Women head to Washington for key trip
## 
### Travis Neal 
Coming off a disappointing loss to No. 10
UCLA, the Stanford women (7-9.3-2 Pacific
10 Conference) no longer find themselves in
the driver's seat of the Pac-10 as they travel
to north for a road trip against Washington
State and Washington.
However, the Cardinal's young starting
five has begun to show a higher level of in
tensity with each passing game, as individual
players have begun to fill their roles. This
maturation has been marked by the emer
gence of forwards Sarah Dimson and
Bethany Donaphin, who have combined for
108 points and 72 rebounds since starting for
the past five games.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

■ Tonight: Stanford (7-9,3-2 Pacific 10Confer
ence) at Washington State (K-6.4-1). 7 p.m.

Dimson started off the Cardinal's home
series against the L.A. schools with a bang,
tallying a double-double with 22 points and
11 rebounds against USC, quite possibly her
best game in a Stanford uniform.
Donaphin followed suit on Sunday
against UCLA, chipping in 1 1 points and 12
rebounds to finish with her third double
double of the year.
However, perhaps the biggest impact of
the weekend came from Donaphin's fellow
freshman. Lindsey Yamasaki. After having
only two points at halftime, Yamasaki lit up
the Bruins for 19 points in the second half, al
most single-handedly getting the Cardinal
back in the game.
Finishing with nine rebounds to go with
her 21 points, Yamasaki had one of the bet
ter games of her young career.
More importantly, though, with her stel
lar second-half effort she demonstrated the
never say die attitude coach Tara Van-
Derveer has been looking for out of her
young squad.

"Our team has been really good for 20
minutes, but we can't sustain the intensity for
40 minutes," VanDerveer said.
Perhaps that trend is beginning to change,
as Yamasaki and the rest of the Cardinal
begin to not only gain intensity, but also con
fidence.
"We feel we should have beaten UCLA,
and we are the better team. We really are get
ting better. In time the truth, heart and posi
tive things each player can contribute will
come out," Dimson said.
The Cardinal hopes that time is now, as its
new-found confidence will be tested today
against a Washington State team that only
lost two of its starters from last year. Al
though the Cougars are 1-4 in the Pac-10 (7-
7 overall), they came close to beating a
ranked Oregon team at Eugene, overcoming
a 20-point deficit late in the game to pull
within eight.
Washington State is led by Tricia Lamb
and Alke Dietel, last year's Pac-10 freshman
player of the year.
According to VanDerveer, Lamb is an ex
cellent three-point shooter, and will have to
be contained if the Cardinal is to overcome
the Cougars. Known for their full-court
press, the Cougars figure to present prob
lems for a Cardinal team averaging 20
turnovers a game. These turnover woes can
be alleviated, says VanDerveer, by simply,
"Working on fundamentals, making better
decisions, and being more patient on of
fense."
Another key to Stanford's victory will be
its height advantage, as the tallest Cougar,
Dietel, stands only 6-foot-4. Stanford center
Carolyn Moos, at 6-6, should be able to dom
inate the frontcourt. with her chief defender,
Sheri Quinton. measuring a full six inches
shorter.
After tonight's game against the Cougars,
the Cardinal pulls into Seattle for a show
down with the Washington Huskies. The
Huskies are one uanie ahead of the Cardinal

in the conference alter having split games on
the road in Oregon. However, Washington
has lost nine straight to Stanford, with its last
win coming in the 1993-94 season.
A victory will he harder to come by this
year, wiiii the Huskies starting lineup con
sisting of the "Fab Four." Seniors Malinda

Lynch, Amber Hall, Jamie Redd and Molly
Hills have started together since their fresh
man year, when they comprised the most
productive freshman class in the Pac-10.
With a wealth of experience, the Huskies
hope to take advantage of the younger Car
dinal.
