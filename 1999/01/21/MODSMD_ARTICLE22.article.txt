# Best in the nation, not ready to be 'foiled'
## 
### 
There are some things you look
back upon in your childhood
and laugh about. I can remember the
days of dueling my friend, he'd be
armed with the Broomstick of
Death and I would hold my Mop of
Justice at attention.
Sometimes there would be
lightsabers. other times there would
but, it was one of those childish es
capes that never seemed to have any
real purpose. After all. with guns
and cooler high-tech explosives,
what g(xxl is a sword?
But some people would disagree.
Namely. Stanford's fencing team. Ill
take them at their word. They're the
No. 1 team in the nation. I think they
know what they're talking about.
Unfortunately, this is California.
Fencing has the kind of appeal here
that water polo has on the East
Coast: Water polo, great. Isn't there
a field hockey game tonight?
Club sport athletes know they're

not at the top of the heap, it's the na
ture of the best. But varsity athletes
in sports such as fencing have to deal
with sitting in the corner while bas
ketball. football and other high-pro
file sports take the limelight.

Not that I'm not guilty of being
distracted by the glamour of the na
tional media. My knowledge of fenc
ing could be summed up by one line
from Antonio Banderas in"The
Mask of Zorro": " The pointy end
goes into the other man."
My main question was a rather

simple one: How do you get in
volved in fencing? It seems to be a
lot like cross country or a car crash,
you never actually picture it happen
ing to you. but it happens anyway.
Sophomore Annie Simpson took
up the sport in Boston when her
cross country season kept her from
being able to try out for the basket
ball team. Fencing seemed like a
good thing to try. Not exactly the kid
on the blacktop dreaming of being
Michael Jordan, but here she is. just
like everyone else on the team, try
ing to make an impact for the top
squad in the nation.
And everyone is succeeding.
Head coach Zoran Tulum quickly
admits that no one in the West could
possibly compete with the Cardinal,
so he's taking his show on the road.
This is the time the team proves
that it has what it takes to impress
the NCAA committee by fulfilling
the three main factors that go into

consideration for the national tour
nament: strength of schedule, win
ning percentage in meets and perfor
mance at regionals.
Regionals is no problem, so
schedule strength becomes key.
Hence the tough weekend is formed.
It's fencing's answer to college
basketball's Great Eight. After two
years of third-place finishes at na
tionals, Tulum and his crew are
ready for more, namely "trading the
bronze trophy for a gold one."
"The rest of our region is not
even competitive for us," Tulum
said. "We wanted to make our
schedule stronger, and there can't be
a stronger schedule than this."
The team faces powerhouses on
two days of packed events. It takes
on Penn State, Pennsylvania. Haver
ford. Duke, Notre Dame. NYU and
St. John's during the trip.
Think of it the way you think of
the men's basketball team. A great

tradition being built slowly. With a
couple of truly strong years, the na
tional spotlight hits you. Blue-chip
recruits are eager to join your team.
Expectations build.
So you beef up the schedule. You
take on the powerhouses. You prove
that you're for real. It's textbook.
Now it's time for the team to
show what it has.
"It's a great chance to gauge our
selves and see where we sit right now
and see what we need to work on."
said women's captain Felicia Zim
merman. "Some of us have been to
many national tournaments ... but
for some who don't go to that many
national tournaments this will be a
big chance for them to get experi
ence."
And for the team as a whole, it's a
chance for some attention.

Gil Lopez won't "fence" anymore
for fear of hitting someone 's eve.
