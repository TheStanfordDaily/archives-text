## 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
Despite the cold and rainy day,
the Stanford men's swimming team
was red hot and fired up in its meet
against Pacific (9-3) on Tuesday.
Alter not having competed in a meet
since early November due to new
i uies against having sports competi
tions during Dead Week, the No. 1
Caidinal (5-0) got back into the
swing of things by triumphing over
the Tigers. 123 74.

"We've gone way too long with
out a meet." said head coach Skip
kennev. "We wanted to come out
today and swim with a lot of confi
dence. We wanted race preparation
lor \ii/ona and Arizona State. We
have been training with a lot of con
fidence and that carried over into
our racing."
And indeed it did. Stanford had
two swimmers win in more than one
event. Senior l ate Blahnik won the

2(X)-yard freestyle (1:39.26) and the
200-yard backstroke with his fastest
time of the season in 1:44.M.
Blahnik is the NCAA returning
champion in the 2(X) back and his
time against Pacific is now the fastest
in the country, only four-tenths of a
second off the automatic qualifying
time for NCAAs. His overall goal
for the season is to break former
Stanford swimmer Brian Kctterer's
American record of 1:40.06, and he
seems to be on track to do that.
The other multiple winner of the
day was Steven Brown, who took
three events. Two of his wins were in
back-to-back events. Brown's first
victory of the day was in the 4(H) in
dividual medley (3:51.38) and then
again in the 200 butterfly (I:4S.S 1).
Ile is the top returner in the 200 fly,
because NCAA Champion and
Stanford swimmer senior Matt
Pierce is out for the season recover
ing from shoulder surgery.
Brown also won the 500 freestyle
with his fastest time of the season so
far in 4:2 K.%. His times in both the
medley and the butterfly were well
under NCAA consideration times,
meaning that he has nearly secured a
spot in the competition this early in
the season.
Senior Justin Ewers (44.71) and

junior Cilcnn Counts (4.\41). team
co-captains, placed first and second,
respectively, in the KM) freestyle,
both with personal bests of the sea
son. Also, sophomore sprinter An
thony Robinson won the 50-yard
freestyle with a time of 20.K7. a little
over a second off of automatic qual
ifying time for N( AAs.
" The intensity we saw at the meet
today in the pool is indicative of
what we have been doing in the
workout pool." said sophomore Je
remy Kane. "And this just shows us
that we can really step it up for Ari
zona and Arizona State."
"(Kerall. it was a really good day.
I am really proud ol the way these

guys swam today," kenney added.
Despite Stanford's excellent per
formance against the Tigers,
Pierce's absence still leaves spaces to
be filled. Kenney is expecting sopho
mores Adam Messner and Rob
( anales to step up in their swimming
and score more points at NC'AAs
this year than they did last year.
Messner will be swimming the
200 butterfly to fill the available po
sition as well as his regularly stellar
distance events. Kenney is anticipat
ing that ( anales will make it to the fi
nals in all his events at the national
championship competition in order
for the Cardinal to defend its title.
"Losing Pierce is a test for the

team and a test for the team's char
acter." Kane said. "We lost not only
a point-scorer, hut a leader and that
cannot he replaced. We have all
risen to the challenge. We just need
to step up our intensity and keep
growing as a team."
Hut looking toward more imme
diate competition, the undefeated
Cardinal will be swimming against
No. 5 Arizona and No. 10 Arizona
State in hack-to-back meets this
coming weekend. Last year. Stan
lord beat both teams in the same
type of competition-packed week
end.
"Arizona and Arizona State are
definitely competitive schools."

Kennev said. "Arizona State has the
best sprinter in the country and Ari
zona has the best distance swimmer,
so we will have to step up in all our
events."
Although Stanford did just swim
a meet that allowed the team to ac
tualize much of what it had been
working on in practice, the two up
coming meets will show the Cardinal
exactly where it stands on a more
competitive level, especially swim
ming against two ranked conference
teams. The upcoming showdowns
have potential to give Stanford a
glimpse at what to expect going into
the Pacific 10 Conference and
NCAA championships.

the Pacific 10 Conference and
NCAA championships.
