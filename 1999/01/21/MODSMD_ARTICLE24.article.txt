The loss lo (icorgia was only the
second dual-meet defeat Stanford
has suffered in the decade-long
tenure of head coach Richard

come sickness, injury and a tough
Arizona team to keep from losing its
second dual meet in a fortnight.
"The Georgia meet really got us
fired up." said senior co-captain Eliti
Austevoll. "We've had a couple
weeks of good, hard training since
then." But Austevoll also conceded

that a number of swimmers are ill.
herself included, and that some
swimmers may be rested during the
road trip.
Also questionable for the meets
is Stanford freshman Sylvia
Bereknyei. who has not competed
recently due to back problems.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the
NCAA dual-meet schedule has little
sympathy for teams going through
hard times. While the Cardinal is still
licking its wounds from the painful

187-113 loss to Georgia, the Wild
cats are coming off two dual-meet
victories and an enormously suc
cessful trip to the Texas Invitational.
I lie Texas meet gave Arizona,
second-place finishers at NCAAs
behind Stanford, a chance to show
the swimming world that it plans to
contend for the swimming and div
ing title once again. At the meet, the
Wildcats posted a phenomenal 13
automatic NCAA qualifying times.
Arizona has seen strong perfor
mances this year from three blazing
freshmen.
Middle-distance freestyler Sarah
lolar. butterflyer/ individual med
levist Erin Vogt and
breastroker / individual medleyist
F-mily Mastin have picked up any
slack left by last year's graduating
class.
l olar should give Stanford swim
mers a run for their money in the
2(H)- and 500-yard freestyle events.
In Texas, she set a school record in
the 2(H) with a time of 1:45.14 and
swam a sensational 4:42.1 in the
500-yard freestyle. No Stanford
swimmer has surpassed those marks
this year, although the Cardinal trio
of (iabriel Rose, Jessica Fosehi and
Courtney Lischke will no doubt set
their sights on l olar.
Vogt. a versatile swimmer who
has the talent to win both the butter
fly and IM events, poses another
threat to the Cardinal. Her times in
the 1(H)- and 200-yard butterfly this
year have rivaled those of Stanford
star Misty Hyman. the defending
NCAA champ in both events.

Providing a 1-2 punch with Vogt
in the I M s. Mastin shines in the 1(H)-
yard breastroke as well. With Stan
ford's breastroke contingent weak
ened by the Austevoll's illness. Car
dinal freshman Whitney Leather
wood may have to outrace Mastin.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING

■ Tomorrow: No. 2 Stanford at No. 4
Arizona.

■ Saturday: Stanford at Arizona
State.

Wildcat divers Lindsay Berry
man and Arno Bergstrom will have
to overcome a strong Stanford force.
Sophomores Kim Powers and Erin
Sones lead a (ardinal squad that has
met only with success this season. In
November, Powers and Sones took
first-place at the Trojan Invitational
Diving Championships in the three
meter and platform events, respec
tively. Although platform diving is
not included in dual-meet competi
tion. Sones has been placing well in
the one- and three-meter events
along with Powers, Carissa Zenorini
and Shawn Sinesky.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
team will face its most difficult chal
lenge on Friday. Georgia was able to
capitalize on the fact that Stanford
swam a taxing meet against Auburn
less than 24 hours before coming to
Athens. Although Arizona State
boasts a number of talented swim
mers. the Cardinal will not have to
worry about facing another top cal
iber team on Saturday.
