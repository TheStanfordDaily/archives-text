Art
NOW — APR / 25
The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presents "Roy
Lichtenstein: A Tribute." The exhibit will represent the variety and
essential qualties of Lichtenstein's work. Widely recognized as one of
the key figures of Pop Art, Lichten6tein was also a master of abstrac
tion. A complex and innovative artist, his work ranged from instantly
recognizable subjects of popular culture to eloquent and austere com
positions of relatively high degree of abstraction. Unking both styles is
a highly distilled sense of composition, in which details are pared back
to present and essential, a simple and visually potent rendering of the
subject. Admission is $8. $4 for students with ID. The museum is open
on Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday to Tuesday from 11
a.m. to 6 p.m., at 151 Third St. (between Mission and Howard), San
Francisoa Call (415)357-4000 for advance tickets and information.

SUN / 24
About pianist Peter Serkin, New York Magazine has enthused, "He is
one of the supreme musicians of our time." The son and grandson of
world-famous Classical musicians, Serkin was no doubt born to play.
Yet there's a rebellious streak beneath his gentle demeanor, giving
him the passion to play Mozart and the moxie to take on the newest
compositions before the Ink has even dried. Ifs no accident that Serkin
holds faculty posts at Julliard and Tanglewood, and has received sev
eral Grammy nominations. Meanwhile, he finds the time to appear in
packed concert halls with contemporaries like Yo-Yo Ma and Andras
Schiff. In a program that includes masters Mozart, Chopin, Debussy
and Beethoven, as well as contemporary works by Oliver Messaien,
Gyorgy and Arnold Schonberg, Serkin walks the highwire

between traditional and modern, balancing the integrity of each com
poser's original vision. Don't miss Peter Serkin's only Bay Area perfor
mance this season! Tickets are $27 to $34, with half-priced tickets
available for Stanford students. The performance is at 2:30 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Call 725-ARTS for tickets and information.

This year marks another season and another Grammy for the
Emerson String Quartet. These boys stay on top by shredding
through everything from Beethoven to Bart6k, setting new standards
for musical excellence and politely bowing to standing ovations
around the world. Yet, after more than a decade among the best in the
world, winning four Grammies and making Gramophone magazine's
"Recording of the Year," the members of the quartet still play with the
same youthful excitement and involvement they had when starting
out. Stanford Lively Arts has become a favorite home away from
home tor this ensemble. They bring us to our feet and keep us
applauding for more. The program is Dvordk'6 String Quartet in C
Major, Op. 61; Mozart's String Quartet in F Major, K. 590; Sibelius'
String Quartet in D Minor, Op. 56 and "Intimate Voices". Tickets are
