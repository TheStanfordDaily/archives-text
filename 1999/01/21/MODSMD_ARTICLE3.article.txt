# Severe memory loss
## Computer RAM theft leaves Serra St. offices shaking heads 
### Sarah Rapawy Contributing writer 
University officials reported
more than $4,200 worth of computer
parts theft to the Stanford Police
Department last Friday. Investiga
tors found that 42 separate memory
cards from 26 different computers
were missing from the payroll and
transportation buildings at 651 and
655 Serra Street.
The exact date of the theft is un
known. but complaints of computer
troubles were first heard Dec. 14. It
was not clear there had been a theft
until workers returned from holiday
break Jan. 4. and many people had
problems, said Lieutenant Del
Brady of the Stanford Police De
partment.
The thieves opened the comput
ers, removed the memory chips, and
then reassembled the computers.
Computers were left in working
order, although somewhat slower,
and the theft only became apparent
once workers tried to run larger,
memory-intensive programs.
"The thieves knew which ma
chines had easy memory to take and

only targeted the newer computers.
Some of the older ones aren't worth
very much," said Joe Riddle, assis
tant group manager for the Univer
sity Controller's office.
According to Bandy, there is no
sign ol forced entry into the build
ing, and police have "no solid leads."
I'here was some re-configuring of
cubicles during one weekend in
early December, Bandy said, and
doors were propped open.
While thieves usually tend to
steal entire computers, over the last
live to six years Bandy has seen an
increase in stolen parts. He believes
this increase might be related to the
use of SIMM chips. Easily inserted
and removed, the chips can hold up
to 64 megabytes of RAM.
"Unfortunately," said Bandy,
"there is no easy way to serialize
these chips, and it is almost impossi
ble to trace them."
Since 1995, about $650,000 worth
of computers and computer parts
have been stolen on Stanford cam
pus in 229 reported cases. A steady
number of thefts have occurred
everywhere from dorm rooms to of
fice buildings.
