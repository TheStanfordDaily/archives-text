Depeche Mode in Oakland

fter band member Alan Wilder's departure and lead singer David Gahan s
personal problems (drug addiction and suicidal depression) — not to men
tion years of teenage-girl adulation — Depeche Mode has overcome and

persisted. And nearly 20 years since it all started, the band has earned the right to do
something as ridiculous as, for instance, promoting a singles / best-of release with a
tour.
Which was exactly what the band did, bringing the "Singles 86>98" gig to the
Oakland Arena on Dec. 11. What keeps the loyal fans going back to Depeche Mode, what
keeps Gahan's butt shaking, what ultimately keeps it all real is the music that rocked the
sardine-packed venue. The crowd exhibited an impressively consistent adherence to the
implicit all-black dress code, as well as a tremendous level of energy.
Opening with "A Question of Time," the band and accompanying musicians cranked
out the dramatically dark, emotional tunes under, ironically, a flashy light show that
occasionally emanated a rather cheesy scent. The backdrop included large "DM" letters
outlined in holiday-style lights. During "Walking in My Shoes," the screen nestled
between "D" and "M" featured the band members strutting down a runway in various
styles. While the songs remained moody, the band members seemed not to take Depeche
Mode too seriously but to have fun with it all, as suggested also by keyboardist Andy
Fletcher's enthusiastic fist pumps and Gahan's incessant dancing (which included some
hip swinging with the backup singers).
The set list ranged from obligatory "Violator" masterpieces such as "Enjoy the
Silence" to the more guitar-based tunes of later albums to the new track "Only When I
Lose Myself." A disappointing omission was the "Music for the Masses" classic
"Strangelove," which could have nicely replaced "Barrel of a Gun" or "Condemnation."
What fortunately did make it to the stage were the commercial junior whoppers such as
"World in My Eyes," "It's No Good," and"In Your Room."
An early highlight was "Never Let Me Down Again" (notably covered by the Smashing
Pumpkins on the tribute album "For The Masses"). During the refrain near the end of
the song, the whole arena lighted up to show an ocean of arms following Gahan's lead,
waving in unison to the beat.
The lead singer's voice was amazingly still as rich and deep as ever, hitting the low
notes in "Useless" with Finesse. When Gahan did seem a tad tired at times, song
writer / guitarist / keyboardist / singer Martin Gore took over lead vocals for a few
tunes. For the first song of the double encore, Gore sang "Somebody" with only a key
boardist on stage accompanying him. On cue, constellations of lighters popped out and
flickered all around the arena.

I don't want to start any blasphemous rumors...
Another song not on "The Singles 86>98" release, "Just Can't Get Enough," suitably
closed out the show. While opening act Stabbing Westward painted a convincing and
loud impression of angst and misery (along the lines of "I don't know if I am real with
out you"), veterans Depeche Mode showed their dark tunes are not just timeless but also
celebratory.
