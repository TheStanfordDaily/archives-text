# Zoe, Duncan. Jack & Jane
## 
### 
It's just like 'Friends', or 'Seinfield', or 'Felicity', or

44 ack, Danny, Jill & John." No, wait, it's "Zeke,
M Dunford, Jake & Jen." Or maybe it's "Joey,
Donald, Josie & Justin"
Actually, the WB's new and not-so-funny sitcom for
the high-school set is called "Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane."
For the sake of manageability, we'll call it "ZDJJ." In
"ZDJJ" 's pilot episode, we meet the title characters, all of
whom live in New York and are in high school.
Zoe (Selma Blair), who seems to be the primary focus
of the show, falls for college man Montana Kennedy,
played by Scott Foley. (Foley also plays resident assistant
Noel Crane on "Felicity," and appeared several times on
"Dawson's Creek" last season as high schooler Cliff
Elliott. This guy is all over the place.)
Zoe tries to take advantage of Montana's sister and fel
low P.E. classmate Brinny in order to get to Montana.
But Brinny, a bitter wheelchair-bound girl who has been
used by classmates interested in her older brother before,
gets revenge by using said girls, including Zoe, for target
practice when playing dodgeball in P.E. (Okay, so that
was kind of funny in a twisted sort of way.) Oh, and Zoe's
quirky because her single mom borrows her Doc

Martens and only dates pilots.
Then there are Zoe's quirky friends. lane (Azura Skye)
feels insecure about her ability to attract males and
spends the entire episode being self-absorbed. She has a
twin brother, Jack (Michael Rosenbaum), who succeeds

in attracting females because he wears cool shoes. He also
dishes out advice to his buddy Duncan (David Moscow),
who aspires to be the ladies' man that Jack is.
Besides the dodgeball scenes, Duncan accounts for the
only other scene in the show that got a laugh out of me.
In his attempts to make himself more attractive, he bor
rows Jack's two-tone, swinger-type shoes and struts into
a subway station emulating John Travolta's strut in the
beginning of "Saturday Night Fever." He even picks up a
can of paint just as Travolta does in the film.
Even though the show had resolved absolutely none of
the little story strands that it juggled by the end of its half
hour, the desire to time in next Sunday to see if Zoe gets
her college man, to see what Duncan changes about his
appearance next, to see Jack flirt and Jane fret, is mini
mal. "ZDJJ" is supposed to be a kind of "Seinfeld Jr." or
"Friends Jr." — a show about neurotic New Yorkers, but
instead of adults, it's adolescents that get hung up on the
little things in life. In this episode it was call-waiting,
Wonderbras, unibrows and two-tone shoes.
The "Seinfeld" and "Friends" formulas fall completely
short of success here. While in "Seinfeld" and "Friends,"
the main characters had or have a definite dynamic that
helps make the show enjoyable, with "ZDJJ", only the
barest, weakest of links are established between the char
acters. They have such individualized plot lines that the
audience barely realizes that all four are friends or broth-

er and sister, as the case bay be.
With its snazzy soundtrack complete with a message
towards the end of the show that tells you what music
that particular episode featured, along with Scott Foley's
guest star appearance as Columbia student Montana
Kennedy, "Zoe, Duncan, lack & Jane" has a familiarity to
it, and with good reason. It's part of the WB's campaign
to monopolize the teeny-bopper-through-college-age
audience, a campaign that includes "Dawson's Creek"
and "Felicity," both of which use the same soundtrack
plugging ploy, as well as the übiquitous Scott Foley.
While "Dawson's Creek" and "Felicity" show signs of
longevity, "ZDJJ" does not. Not only is it difficult to
remember the show's name, it's difficult to remember that
it's even on Sunday nights because it's preceded by the sit
com gems "Sister, Sister" and "Smart Guy," and followed
by that really strange show with the singing puppet
"Unhappily Ever After." Meanwhile, Fox is airing some of
its successful workhorses, "The Simpsons" and the"X-
Files," along with its new success, "That '70s Show."
Shows sometimes improve after their pilot episode,
and often times they change their tide, so if you can tear
yourself away from Fox, there's a little bit of hope for
"Zoe, Duncan, Jack 8c Jane."
