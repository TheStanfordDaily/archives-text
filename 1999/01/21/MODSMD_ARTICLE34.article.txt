## 'Big Big World' Music Reviews 
### 
From the country that gave us Ace of Base and Abba comes Emilia, an up-and-coming
young pop singer. With her newest album, "Big Big World," Emilia attempts to propel
herself into the huge and highly competitive world of the music industry.
The music in this album is entertaining but not particularly distinctive. Emilia's soft,
smooth tunes are accompanied for the most part by upbeat positive lyrics that at times bor
der on the ingratiating. The first track, appropriately entitled "A Good Sign," contains the
lyrics, "The sky is so blue I The tiny cloud is smiling I And the sun is for you," as well as the
lyrics "Butterflies are flying / And birds are singing."
The album is redeemed however, by the songs that depart from this formulaic, stale char
acter. "Like Chocolate," the fifth track, gets a sexy, silky rendition. This song includes the lines,
"Feel me, taste me, see me / You know I'm sweet like candy / I'm into you / The way you're
into me."
Emilia, however, distinguishes herself through the tremendous versatility of her vocal abil
ity. At times she resembles Alanis Morissette, and at other times Mariah Carey and Aretha
Franklin. The title track, "Big, Big World," has a catchy beat, and the lyrics and music have a
smooth flow. One of the last tracks, "Maybe, Baby" is reminiscent of the doo-wop sounds pop
ularized in the '50s and the '60s.
This album is distinguished by the mastery of Emilia's vocal ability. The angst-driven song
"Adam and Eve" is delivered in a silky-smooth yet troubled voice. This song is all the more
powerful because of Emilia's restraint. Her solemnly delivered lines, "Like a loving friend / He
gave me life and joy / That's why I opened up / In body, mind, and soul / But with a lie he
ruined it all / A lie called love."
This album truly has something for everyone, from the Big Phat remix of "Big, Big World,"
(for those who like R&B and rap harmonies and flavor), to the '40s slant of "Maybe, Baby."
