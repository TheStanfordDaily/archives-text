'Live in Montana'
The Meat Puppets first emerged in the national conscience when their music
piggy-backed onto Nirvana's pivotal "MTV Unplugged" album. The trio from
Phoenix belonged to the same underground world as the Replacements, Sonic
Youth and Htlsker Dti, bands that would form the roots of America's alternative move
ment.
The Meat Puppets, comprised of Curt Kirkwood (guitar), Cris Kirkwood (bass) and
Derrick Bostrom (drums), formed in 1980, surfacing out of the same primordial, post
punk stew that created such bands as Bar Religion, Minutemen and Black Flag in
California. However, unlike those bands, whose success depended on being creative
within the limits of punk, the Meat Puppets embraced country, psychedelic and dadaist
roots for what can be safely described as an unique sound. Tuneless, goofy singing
joined forces with quirky bass lines and misplaced guitar pyrotechnics.
In conjunction with Rykodisc's re-release of the group's original SST albums from
the '80s, the band is now releasing its first concert album, "Live In Montana," recorded
in December 1988. The concert catches the group during a fertile period, between the
"Huevos" and "Monsters" albums.
The disc starts off with the Puppets at their most geeky and endearing with the ripe
"Touchdown King," described as "a nice, sweet song about an intriguing sport." The
group works hard to show off its many styles, from the ZZ Top-meets-D. Boon boogie
of "Automatic Mojo" to the surprisingly successful folk fusion of "Maiden's Milk" to the
psychotic funk of "S.W.A.T. (Get Down)."
Strangely enough, the strength of this album often seems to depend on the attitude
of the listener. As background music, "Dough Rey Me" has a passable country groove
and "Cotton Candy Land" sounds likably innocent. Nonetheless, only Phish fans could
stand repeated listenings as the group reaches a level of soft-headedness rarely
approached in popular music.
Still, the album has its charms. The band certainly masters the tight, sloppy groove,
especially on "1 Can't Be Counted On" and the instrumental bridge between "S.W.A.T.
(Get Down)" and "Attacked By Monsters." They may not be giving up the funk, but the
Meat Puppets certainly are giving up something.
Odd covers also provide a secondary attraction. The Puppets' version of Roy
Orbison's "Blue Bayou" is obviously revisionist but also touching in its wide-eyed won
der. Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" is another story. When Ozzy Osbourne sang he was
"finished with my woman cause she couldn't help me with my mind," his comic-book
nihilism was rather humorous; when the Kirkwoods sing the line, their casualness sug
gests something entirely different.
"Live In Montana" is certainly not for everyone, but then neither are the Meat
Puppets. For those who grew up left of the dial in the '80s, however, this concert time
capsule will do nicely.
