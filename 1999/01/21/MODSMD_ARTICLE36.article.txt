# Ghosts in the Museum
## The
						Stanfords' legacy is transformed into the new Cantor Center Cover Story 
### Meredith Alexander Contributing writer 
his Saturday, the old Stanford Museum reopens — amidst great
\ fanfare in the Stanford community — in its newest reincarna
tion as the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at
J Stanford University. This isn't the first time Stanford's art collec
tions have undergone a transformation. In fact, the museum's
history goes back farther in time than the University itself. It's a story filled with Stanford
family triumph and tragedy.

Leland Stanford Jr.: Budding connoisseur
To tell the Museum's story, we must step into the shoes of young Leland Stanford, Jr.,
as he accompanied his parents on two trips to Europe. This sounds pretty average to
20th-century ears, but taking a 12-year-old boy abroad in 1880 was something only the
most privileged classes could afford. Leland's father was already governing California,
and he couldn't stay for long. When his dad went back to the United States, little Leland
traveled with his mother, Jane, to all the most artistically prominent cities of Europe:
Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii. The boy was
taken to museums and galleries everywhere, and Jane began to collect art herself.
Leland already showed signs of budding connoisseurship: He persuaded his mother
to buy sculptures while visiting Rome. In the Eternal City, Leland came into his own, sur
rounded by ancient artifacts. His mother wrote home about Leland Jr. to his father, "You
will be surprised how much this trip has done for him .... he is wonderfully bright, far
beyond his years." The boy's interest in classical archaeology was blossoming, she said,
and Leland was even "called the little 'Augustus' here by the artists, for his head is so
much like the bust of Augustus."
When Leland was 15, in 1883, he returned to Europe for a second, ill-fated trip. His
background in classical art had grown after trips to New York's Metropolitan Museum
and Leland began to make his own "museum" with the help of his parents' funds. In
addition to buying antiques at markets, Leland visited excavation sites and took his finds
home — which was considered perfectly normal at the time. In Athens, he met the
famous amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who presented him with ancient
"fetishes." Leland enthusiastically continued collecting until his sudden death in
Florence of typhoid fever.
In the months after he died, Leland's parents funneled their grief into plans to con
struct a memorial in his name. One possibility, to form "a university to be placed in Palo
Alto as near as possible to a tree under which their son had once eaten luncheon," won
out, but not without an important addition: the Leland Stanford Jr. Museum, included
in the University's founding grant of Nov. 11,1885.

The Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum
Young Leland's collection
would find a home and Jane
would find a vocation in the
new museum. Mrs. Stanford
acquired a collection of
Cypriot antiquities and rapid
ly added Greek vases and
bronzes. Noting that her dead
son had desired to purchase
Chinese, Japanese and
American Indian arts, she set
to work to fulfill his wishes. A
huge set of Japanese objects
was bought from the collec
tion of a former U.S. ambas
sador; American Indian arti
facts were picked up at the
New Orleans Exposition of
1884-85. The assembly of the
Museum continued apace
through the turn of the centu
ry and beyond.
Meanwhile, the building
itself had to be constructed.
Mrs. Stanford had made up
her mind that she wanted it to
be styled along the lines of the
neoclassical National Museum

of Athens, Greece. Despite the incongruousness in Palo Alto — or any
where in the United States, since this was one of the very first neoclassical structures to
be built on this continent — Jane proved insistent, going against the advice of some of
her architects. The museum would be separated from the Main Quad, with its
Romanesque architecture, set off of Palm Drive, so as not to disrupt the "harmony"
achieved in the Spanish-mission-style Quad.
In imitation of the Athens building, the Stanford Museum was to possess a quadran
gle. The first part of the Museum — the first American building to be made of reinforced
concrete — was completed in 1891 and opened in 1894, but the rest took until 1906 to
be finished. And in 1906, a disastrous event took away much that had been created: the
earthquake shattered many of the newer parts of the building, those not reinforced.
The earthquakes
Patience Young, the Curator for Education at the new Arts Center, commented that
"the initial collection didn't all survive the earthquake of 1906." What was worse, she
said, was that "(t]he Stanfords had a mansion in San Francisco that burned. It was an
extraordinary building on Nob Hill," one which contained many valuable Italian paint
ings and other artworks destined for the Museum.
Although today the entrance area has been restored to look like the original, Young
described the enormous damage done during the earthquake. Entire wings of the new
Museum crumbled. By then Leland Sr. and Jane were dead, so they did not have to wit
ness this destruction.
Today, as you enter the new Museum, you'll encounter one figure who hasn't moved
since its inception, a warrior who has withstood two major earthquakes: the goddess
Athena. She invites the visitor to discover collections old and new in the Cantor Center.
The museum has been closed since 1995 after damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earth
quake, and students will get the opportunity to see collections starting Saturday — free
of charge, as it always was and will be.
Memorabilia and Stanfordiana
First, to get a sense of the Museum's history, a visit to the Stanford Family room is
worthwhile. Beyond the coatrooms on your left, the walls painted red and the carpet on
the floor evoke the late 19th century. Illustrations of the Stanfords' investments in agri
culture are coupled with tourist souvenirs from their trips. Leland Jr. collected some odd
objects — including a spur worn by Emperor Napoleon 111. You'll see an image of
Leland's favorite dog as well as some family portraits. The boy's death mask, installed at
eye level, is a poignant memento.
Upstairs, continue pursuing the Stanford family theme by viewing the larger, more
ambitious portraits commissioned by the family in Europe. Carolus-Duran, teacher of
John Singer Sargent, made a full-length portrait of Leland Jr. in 1881 that illustrates the
confidence of this rich, intelligent, doted-upon boy.
Young remarked that the Stanfords "were not cutting-edge art collectors — they were
very successful California business people and politicians." Although they did assemble
a number of California landscape paintings in their own collection, today's museum is
built largely around more recent connoisseurship.
