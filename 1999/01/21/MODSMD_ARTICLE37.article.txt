One major exception to this is the Muybridge collec
tion. Don't miss the second-floor gallery currently devot
ed to Eadweard Muybridge's still photographs, the first to
capture animal motions and display them in order.
Leland Stanford Sr. was greatly interested in this kind of
"stop-action" photography (a precursor to modern film)
and even lent Muybridge a Stanford barn (at the time,
part of the Stanfords' Palo Alto Horse Farm) in which to
conduct a photo shoot of a moving horse. Muybridge's
book, "Attitudes of Animals in Motion," became an
instant classic.
The Rodin collection
Surely the museum's most celebrated set of works is
the Rodin group. This collection began when art history
Professor Albert Elsen, a major scholar of Rodin, came
into contact with Bernard Cantor, founder of Cantor

Fitzgerald global securities and a well-known patron of
the arts. Before his death in 1996, Cantor contributed 185
Rodins to the Museum. In his name and with his gifts, the
B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden was created in
1985.
Today, Cantor's wife Iris is continuing to support the
center which now bears their name.
The Rodins cluster in a large room on the ground
floor, as well as in the ground floor rotunda next door,
which leads gracefully out to the Rodin Sculpture
Garden.
The new wing
Beyond the Rotunda, you can pass into the new wing
of the Center, a 42,000-square foot addition, including
galleries, a sculpture terrace, a bookshop and a cafe. The
cafe, on the ground floor and facing the outdoors, looks
like an inviting spot to relax.
The McMurtry Family Terrace, on the second level, is
an outdoor area displaying sculpture and providing a
view facing Campus Drive. This space houses a red and
silver kinetic sculpture by George Rickey called "Space
Churn Red." Don't miss the opportunity to make it move
by turning a lever on its side.
Other contemporary art on view in the indoor galleries
includes a series of black-and-white lithographs and
prints by contemporary art giant Jasper Johns. Andy
Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" shout out in full color. In the
indoor rotunda area, you can see eight bronze sculptures
by Willem de Kooning, including a small version of
"Standing Figure," the enormous work now situated on
the Museum's lawn — and visible from the window
beside its miniature. A number of these pieces are on
long-term loan to the Museum.
Also on loan is a set of rare proofs and print series by
Pablo Picasso. These works come from Pasadena's Norton
Simon Museum, and will be on view through March 28.
This collection forms the opening exhibit on the ground
floor of the New Wing.
Asian arts and other exhibits
The Asian art galleries house one of the Museum's old
est collections, and they contain a number of remarkable
items: the Buddha Shakyamuni, a 16th-century wooden
sculpture of the reclining figure that amazes in its peace
fulness; a gorgeous Korean 10-panel folding screen
(ch'aekhori) of silk embroidered onto satin, from the late
19th century; and an intricately carved ivory and mother

of-pearl dragon from Japan.
The Oceanic and African collections will also be on
display on opening day, along with Native American art
and art of the ancient Americas.
The new center's grand opening
After spending $36.8 million dollars on the new muse
um, did Stanford get its money's worth? This question
will only be answered when students and art critics get
the chance to respond, beginning on Jan. 23. On Stanford
Day, an open house for the Stanford community, music
and refreshments will help visitors celebrate the renova
tions. The following day, Community Day, the center will
throw its doors open to the wider world.
Student intern and art history coterm Carlo
Libraridian is excited. He and students from Bay Area
schools — those participating in school outreach pro
grams — have been anticipating the reopening with
enthusiasm. "We have 80 murals [by students] now that
will be up for Stanford Day in outdoor tents. It's a Huge
deal. We've been planning for years."
Libraridian's enthusiasm is perhaps different from the
kind that first inspired the Museum's original opening —
the one that made mosaics such as "Progress and
Civilization" on the front facade. In this panel, a naked
male figure and a clothed male examine art objects care
fully, as if the closer you look the more "civilized" you will
become.
Today, the Center is an extremely inclusive place — a
place bringing together all cultures, all art forms.
Although it may not lead to the kinds of "progress" being
proffered in the Gates building, Stanford should certain
ly welcome the return of the fine arts in her midst. That
such funds have been well spent will depend on whether
an artistic renaissance will accompany the rebirth of this
space.
