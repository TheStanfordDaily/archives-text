# Too much ‘Hurly’
## Movie Reviews And not enough 'Burly' 
### 
a y y urlyburly" is a film of extremes. It has
I—l excellent performances by a seasoned
JL JL ensemble cast, it's beautifully shot, and
you get to see Meg Ryan in a small role as a junkie /
prostitute. But it also has no plot, little character
development throughout the film, and you have to
see Meg Ryan make an appearance as a junkie / pros
titute.
Am I conflicted? Surely. This ought to be a better
film than it is. The non-narrative plot structure
could have worked given the subject matter: obses
sively analytical and drug-addicted industry types in
the Hollywood Hills. But there is no tension — there

is nothing complex or interesting
about the fall of the central char
acter, Eddie, however brilliant the
performance of Sean Penn, be
cause we expect him to unravel.
When he declares himself a
"wreck" by the end of the film, it's
obvious, not a climactic self-reck
oning. Unfor-tunately, the film is
not about Eddie spinning out of
control; it's more like watching the
aftermath — a long, slow but
inevitable free-fall off a cliff.
The most interesting thing
about the film, the relationship
between Eddie and his best friend
and business partner, Mickey
(Kevin Spacey), is dropped in
favor of the lurid dissolution of
Eddie. When Penn and Spacey are
on screen together, it is amazing.
These two great actors explore a

sick and mutually destructive relationship and cagi
ly dance around other. Unlike Eddie, Mickey is too
much in control, too clever, and shows no emotion.
Spacey delivers as usual, preening and verbally jab
bing everyone, but still offering glimpses of what
might be a soul. With such an elaborately chilly
facade, though, no one could ever know.
The problem with that Eddie is that he destroys
any possibilities of his own or others' happiness by
his obsessive need for "honest" relationships. He
demonstrates this by relentlessly dissecting the
words of others to unbearable lengths. Unfor
tunately, this obsession is not at all cinematic, for the

discomfort of the audience grows and grows during
these endless truth sessions. In one telling scene,
Eddie attacks his girlfriend, Darlene (Robin Wright
Penn) for not being able to choose between a French
and a Chinese restaurant She wants him to stop, the
audience wants him to give it up, and maybe even
Eddie does not really care, but he keeps going any
way. Finally, Darlene screams, "Enough! I cannot
stand any more of this semantic insanity!" Not a
deathless line, but she isolated my sentiment precise
ly-
"Hurlyburly" is to a certain extent an ensemble
piece, and the various other characters and subplots

are all right The film is not really
about L.A. entertainment indus
try drug addiction, unlike last
fall's "Permanent Midnight." It
seems that the problem which
director Anthony Drazan ("Ze
brahead") and writer David Rabe
("Casualties of War") are really
intent on exploring is the dissatis
faction which people bring upon
themselves by talking too much.
Of course, these over-analytical
gab-fests are fueled by coke, but it
seems symptomatic in this con
text.
Oh yes, and there is Meg Ryan.
It might have just been me, but I
found a perverse pleasure from
hearing her say lines like, "I fuck
who I want."
