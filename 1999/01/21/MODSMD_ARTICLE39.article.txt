'Hilary and Jackie' is complex and fascinating

I am not envious of the celebrity lifestyle at all. 1 see Michael Jordan, Alec Baldwin or
Bill Gates on TV, and I envision a very tortured life which ultimately isn't worth the
sky-high salaries. "Hilary and Jackie," a relatively solid feature from director Anand
Tucker, illustrates this point with precision and acuity. Tucker did well in casting the
mesmerizing Fmily Watson, who is following up her Oscar-nominated role in "Breaking
the Waves," in the lead as Jacqueline Du Pr£, champion cellist. The tragic tale of her
steady decline is vivid, memorable and downright disheartening.
"Hilary and Jackie" essentially works as a two-part movie based on the real-life Du
Pr£ sisters. The first act introduces us to the tightly knit relationship which Hilary and
Jacqueline, or Jackie, share as little girls. A bit of mystery opens the movie when a mys
terious woman whispers something in Jackie's ear on the beach. It is strange to see this
scene fleshed out in full detail later on in the film, and it caused me to consider and
reconsider what exactly Tucker is trying to imply.
The girls attempt to satisfy their parents' high expectations by taking up instru
ments — the cello is for Jackie, while the flute is Hilary's expertise. Hilary actually gets
their parents' favor first, as Jackie can only stumble along in the shadow of her award
winning sister. It is at this point that Jackie becomes determined to become a star cellist
so that their parents will pay attention to her again.
The second act shows how both sisters have coped as full-fledged adults. Hilary has

settled as a housewife in the countryside with her down-to-earth husband, Kiffer Finzi
(David Morrissey). She is quite happy with her family and her picturesque home. Jackie,
meanwhile, has slowly become increasingly depressed and psychotic. She develops a dis
order in her nerve endings, thus causing her to shake involuntarily. Jackie's Jewish hus
band, Daniel Barenboim (James Frain), has facilitated her path to mental and physical
problems, since he is rarely around Jackie outside of concert performances and cocktail
parties.
The most disturbing sequence to hit the screen this year comes about two-thirds of
the way into the film. I won't spoil it, but once you hear the "proposition," you'll see how
effective Tucker can be in getting your attention. His focus on the need for the sisters to
share experiences and to make up for any emotional separations which may occur is
particularly compelling.
However, "Hilary and Jackie" starts to slow to a crawl during the last few stages of the
movie. Editing out the less important melodramatic footage would have made the film
much more accessible and involving. Still, I give credit to Watson for delivering a per
formance reminiscent of Geoffrey Rush's awe-inspiring turn in "Shine." She gives Tucker
a solid foundation from which he builds a fascinating look at the world of musicians.
