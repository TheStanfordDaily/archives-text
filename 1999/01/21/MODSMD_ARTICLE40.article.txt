Sometimes obsession is a sports thing

Somehow I get the feeling that I liked "Varsity Blues" because I'm biased; I'm from
a small town in Texas where football is a religion. This movie is a testament to that
interesting way of life.
In West Canaan, Texas, the high school football team is king. Upon entering the
town, you'll find a billboard featuring the star quarterback, Lance Harbor (Paul
Walker), and at the high school there is a bronze statue of the team's 35-year head
coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight).
Kilmer is absolutely determined to win a 23rd division title for the West Canaan
Coyotes, so when Harbor's knee starts hurting, he just shoots the boy up with
painkillers. Eventually Harbor ends up in the hospital with a career-ending knee injury,
and second-string quarterback Jonathan Moxon (James Van Der Beek) has to take over
with a handful of crucial games left in the season.
Mox is not a bad player, but he detests Kilmer's strategies and abuse of his team
mates. He's also more interested in reading Kurt Vonnegut than winning a division
championship. When he's not being pummeled on the field, he has to duke it out with
West Canaan's football-crazy grownups.
So in the grand sense, this is a movie about football. It takes our love of sports to the
extreme and demonstrates to us just how silly the whole thing can be. Girls who watch
the movie to see their poster boy from TV's "Dawson's Creek" might be surprised at
how male-oriented it often is; there's a gratuitous scene in a strip club, a scene with Ali
Larter in a whipped-cream bikini (wow), and many testosterone-laden sports
moments.
The cast is your typical teenage glamour-fest, but I was surprised to see some actual
attempts at dimensionality. There's Mox's buddy Billy Bob (Ron Lester), a really chub
by but lovable guy who has to deal with guilt and weight complexes. Another friend
named Tweeder (Scott Caan) may be taking his love of women and alcohol a bit too far.
And Mox's girlfriend Jules Harbor (Amy Smart) isn't sure what to think of Mox's new
heroic status with her brother in the hospital.
Of course, there's no hiding the fact that MTV produced this movie. People over the
age of 12 will probably have a hard time swallowing most of it. The acting is horribly
stretched, as one can pick up from Van Der Beek's silly southern accent. The script
treats us to teenage stereotype after stereotype. And someone keeps playing the Foo
Fighters song "My Hero" during the football games; it made me want to scream.

In other words, this movie is cheesy beyond belief, but if you suspend.your IQ for a
few minutes, it's actually entertaining. There's even a moment toward the end where the
whole audience can briefly, if superficially, understand the Texan love of football.
