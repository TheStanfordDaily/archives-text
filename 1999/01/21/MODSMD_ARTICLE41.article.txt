# Good things in 'Sight'

A credible look into the world of the blind

Certainly, this is no "Shakespeare in Love." But producer Irwin Winkler, the force
behind such grand slams as "Rocky" and "Goodfellas," has a handle on a tricky
proposition: balancing the drama of regaining eyesight with a romantic comedy
about a blind man and an attractive, divorced woman. Sure, he periodically relies on
cheesy slapstick to egg us on into hoping that the two kiss and fall in love. Yet the strong
ideas behind the movie and satisfactory performances from Val Kilmer and Mira
Sorvino as the couple make "At First Sight" a worthy choice at the local cineplex.

It would be hard to hate this likeable story. Val Kilmer plays Virgil Adamson, a blind
massage therapist at a mountain resort who loves to ice skate (someday he may play for
those New York Rangers) and hang out with his dog. He is assigned, coincidentally, to
give Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino, "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion") a deep
rub-down to ease her tensions.
An architect for New York City, Amy has a friendly personality which snags (hook,
line, and sinker) Virgil into a relationship with her. Virgil's sister, Jenny (Kelly McGillis),
becomes a bit too overbearing and skeptical, but I suppose it is understandable given
how attached she must be to helping her brother.
The breaking point in the movie is when Virgil undergoes state-of-the-art surgery to
restore his vision. This, by far, is the most fascinating part of the movie. What would it
be like to see this world after decades in darkness? What is it actually like to be blind?
How does vision alter a person's perception of others?
Alas, complications from the surgery, along with relationship tiffs between Virgil and
Amy, break up the smooth, tranquil pacing of the movie. But the problems seem realistic
enough, and they caused me to think about what 1 would do in the characters' situation.
A good supporting character is Dr. Phil Webster (Nathan Lane, "The Birdcage"), who
works with blind children but finds Virgil's case rather exceptional. I am glad that Lane
constrains his outbursts here, as he melds into his role as mentor and therapist for the
agitated Virgil.
Given the underlying fish-out-of-water premise, trite comments and situational
comedy mar "At First Sight." I also wasn't terribly impressed with Sorvino, who should
stick with comedies like "Mighty Aphrodite" and not try to move into romantic dramas.
Kilmer is a little better, but he has starred in too many high-profile action films to make
us fully believe he is, in fact, blind for the first portion of the movie.
Over all, "At First Sight" works best when it focuses on the drama of the surgical pro
cedure and any possible consequences which may appear in the characters' lives. There
is little love to be felt between Kilmer and Sorvino, but the moving and intriguing idea
of sight restoration compensates for the actors' shortcomings within the realm of
romance.
