# 'Virus'
## Movie Review 
### Fred Vallaeys 
Same old same old (yawn)

It's no surprise that "Virus" was never screened for the critics. This film has very lit
tle going for it. As in too many other films, the special effects are supposed to
make the movie. Unfortunately, the picture falls short in all other categories.
The story is the same one we've all seen a thousand times before. An alien lifeforce
invades a Russian research vessel in the middle of the Pacific, where it kills ail but one
of the crew. Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland) and his tugboat crew find the desert
ed ship and decide to salvage it in an attempt to become rich.
No sooner is this new crew aboard the ghost ship than things start to go wrong. It
seems that the ship is taking on a life of its own. The surveillance cameras, navigation
computers and robots all work together with a single-minded purpose: To eradicate the
virus it calls humans.
Surprisingly, the real essence of the alien is nothing more than an extremely danger
ous computer virus. When a piece of electronic equipment is infected with the virus, it
goes through a number of cycles. First it acquires all human knowledge, then it starts
modifying itself so that it can kill humans. Some of the more impressive effects in this
film came when a victim's body parts were used in the creation of a half-human robot.
The reason why the writers decided that this virus would be alien in nature is probably
not meant to be understood. Maybe they thought that an out-of-control, man-made
computer virus would be too cliche for a film?-
Because of the weak script, the acting in "Virus" amounts to very little. Jamie Lee
Curtis, William Baldwin and Donald Sutherland all struggle along with their trite roles.
Their pitiful lines pale next to the grand special effects of this film.
Because "Virus" is produced by the makers of "Terminator" and "T2, n it is no surprise
that the alien life form is part machine. The main monster is a spectacular sight. It
stands over 10 feet tall as its eyes menacingly seek out its human prey. It rips the ship's
steel walls as if they were made from paper. In order to accomplish its mission, it must
get to land where it can use communications satellites to infest all electronic devices.
The salvaging crew's greed spontaneously turns into a concern for the greater good of
humanity as they decide to risk their lives to stop the spread of the alien.
One of the few good decisions made about the film "Virus" was to schedule it for an
early January opening. This tactical move increases the chances that by the time critics
start making their list of the worst films of 1999, "Virus" will be long forgotten.
