# Schmuck & Putz
## Wake up and smell the dreck, Dreamworks! Schmuck & Putz 
### Justin "Schmuck" Shenkarow Zach "Putz" Udko 
n their weekly field trip to lovely family getaway San Jose, Schmuck and Putz
( \J I met a new w^e waiting for a screening of "In Dreams," director Neil
V | J Jordan's latest film, to begin. Apparently, since too few press people chose to
attend this showing, the theatre decided to invite random people of the night off the
streets for free. Their newfound friend was apparently roaming Fourth Street with his
trusty bottle of rum before he received the prestigious invite.
At first, his odor was not identifiable. Schmuck had to explain to a gagging Putz that
the fragrance was Calvin Klein's "Street Chic," a trendy new cologne. When the two came
to this realization, they were ready to make friends. Following the movie, Schmuck and
Putz suggested to this seemingly mute man (we'll call him Poopsi) that they have a drink
to unwind after an intense two hours. Poopsi guided them to his favorite exclusive hang
out, remarkably close to campus — Ernie's Liquors on El Camino.
For the first few hours, Poopsi was calm, cool and collected. But as soon as Ernie
mentioned that he had to close shop, Poopsi became quite violent. He began choking
the boys and spitting on them. Vomit entered the picture as well. As a result of this inci
dent, Schmuck and Putz are currently interviewing prospective bodyguards. Please send
all inquiries to intermission@daily.stanford.edu. The applicant would preferably be a
beautiful blonde woman; it would be nice if she were a Dollie, but this is not required.
Well anyway, here's a brief excerpt of our wonderful conversation:
Putz: No matter what kind of frightening dreams Annette Bening has throughout
this extraordinarily awful dud, none can compare to the nightmares that Dreamworks
film executives will have after this film opens.
The plot centers around Bening, who shares the dreams of a psyco killer, played by
the incomparable Robert Downey Jr. When he starts to dream about death (eyeballs
being poked out, dogs eating human heads, little kids being brutally killed to just name
a few), you might guess what happens. All the while, Bening keeps having random
nightmares in which she sees the following words written on walls: "Daddy was a dol
lar." That's a dollar that Dreamworks probably won't be seeing.
In fact, the only redeeming element of this film lies in the incredible performance of
Robert Downey Jr. He has truly outdone himself here, taking the concept of method act
ing to the extreme. We can certainly tell that Downey's performance, in which he plays
a drug-crazed lunatic who ends up in prison, has been a character study several years in
the making. In the final scenes of the film, Downey certainly appears in his element in
handcuffs, a shaved head and a jail outfit. Some of you may remember him in this exact
costume on "Court TV." But hey, it's all for the art, isn't it?

Schmuck: Putz, I have to add that Poopsi mentioned to me on the ride over here that
he and Downey shared cell block 20 in the Lompoc penetentiary over the summer. He
says he's real down-to-earth, someone whom everyone can relate to. That's such good
news, because most of the time you hear of these shallow doped-out morons who think
they can do whatever the hell they want.
But since we're discussing the film, let's talk about some of the things that made me
really connect with what was happening on screen. 1 must say that seeing the mike
repeatedly show itself on the top of the screen in one of the scenes was quite a new and
fascinating directorial technique. I love it when even the editors know how bad the
movie is, so they just leave in random pieces of sound equipment for fun. It's like play
ing the game "Where's Waldo?" because you're never quite sure when the mike's going
to pop up. It sure kept me on my toes. It's aspects of filmmaking such as these that keep
me optimistic about films to come.
Putz: Speaking about coming attractions, this movie reminds me a helluva lot of a
screenplay I am currently working on called "In Wet Dreams." We already have a star
name attached to it: Go Downey Jr. It's about two people who share sexual fantasies, and
when this other girl enters the picture —
Schmuck: Are you kidding? You copied that premise from my script "Wet Dreams
May Come." How dare you!
Putz: Oh yeah? Well I registered mine at the Writer's Guild of America!
Schmuck: I copyrighted mine in Washington, D.C.!
Putz: Well, I know girls related to very important people there!
Schmuck: So do I, damn it! So do I!
Poopsi: More beer, Ernie! Put it on my account!
Ernie: We're closed now. No more beer for you!
Poopsi: Aaarrrgggh!
The Bottom Line:
Avoid Ernie's when accompanied by random people of the night.
