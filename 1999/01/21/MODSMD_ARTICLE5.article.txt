## Former columnist talks media accountability 
### Jessica Tucker-Mohl Contributing writer 
Russell Baker, Pulitzer Prize-winning author,
host of "Masterpiece Theatre" and a former New
York Times columnist, spoke last night to a capacity
crowd of 7(M) at Kresge Auditorium about the neces
sity of "downsizing" the Washington D.C. media es
tablishment.
"People who have to pay their mortgage or send
their kids to public schools of poor quality may sen
sibly wonder why the Washington press pays so little
attention to issues that affect them and lavishes at
tention on Monica and Bill," Baker observed.
In a speech titled "Will the Media be the End of
Us?" Baker spoke of the "pathetic lack of perspec
tive" demonstrated by the media regarding the Clin
ton-Lewinsky sex scandal. "Events of little signifi
cance get inflated to great historical importance," he
continued.
Baker pondered why the sex scandal has pro
voked "a great public shudder of disgust."
"The question is whether this shows the public is
irritated because it doesn't like to hear what we're
telling it, or it's embarrassed because it doesn't like to
see our best papers and television trafficking in that
kind of gossip."
Despite America's declining respect for press
coverage of public affairs. Baker emphasized its ne
cessity by pointing to the former Soviet Union and
Hitler's Germany. "The lack of media is far more
dangerous."
Baker noted that the Lewinsky scandal "has all
the elements of a French farce: the foolish, overheat
ed husband, the flirty maid, in this case an intern, and
the spiteful in-laws, or Linda Tripp."
Baker also noted the growing influence of televi-

sion journalism. "TV is wonderful,"
he stated. However, "it compels sen
sible people to behave melodramati
cally."
"In a sense, the jig is already up
for the print reporter," Baker contin
ued, noting that Bob Woodward and
Carl Bernstein were the last print re
porters to achieve national recogni
tion.
"The talking head is here to stay."
Baker reflected on his 36 years as
a columnist by pointing to John Ken
neth Galbraith's definition: "a man
obliged bv the nature of his trade to

find significance three times a week
in events that have no consequence."
Baker recalled bygone days of
journalism when the newsroom was
filled with "raffish, boozing, smok
ing, wisecracking, underpaid social
misfits."
"There is now about us a tenden
cy to pompousness."
According to sophomore Wen
shin Lee, who attended Baker's talk,
"sensationalized news in this day and
age is becoming more and more out
of control."
"What [Baker] said was very per
tinent to what is going on with Amer
ican media, especially because he
comes from an era that is so differ
ent," Lee continued.
