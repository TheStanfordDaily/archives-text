After ending his 37-year stint as a
New York Times columnist last
month. Russell Baker anticipates
retirement as a time to "get in your
rocker, cover yourself with a shawl,

it. Now nobody can fix a car, but a
six-year-old can program a VCR."

Prize for Distinguished Commen

1983 autobiography, "Growing
Up."
After receiving a degree in Eng
lish literature from Johns Hopkins
University in 1947, Baker took a job
as a police reporter for the Balti
more Sun.
