## 
### Ann Kim Editorial staff 
After ending his 37-year stint as a
New York Times columnist last
month. Russell Baker anticipates
retirement as a time to "get in your
rocker, cover yourself with a shawl,
sit on the front porch and watch the
traffic go by."
The distinguished journalist has
been watching traffic of a different
sort throughout his career, covering

the White House, the State Depart
ment, Congi ess and presidential
elections for the Times in the '50s
and early '60s. In 1962 Baker began
sharing his thoughts on national pol
itics and American life in his col
umn, "Observer."
Baker's ability to turn a passing
thought into an amusing riff, much
like a stand-up comedian, was on
display in an interview yesterday.
Considering recent technologi
cal advancements, he noted, "Kids

of my generation were born with the
ability to fix a car. That's why the
U.S. won World War II — when a
tank broke down, somebody fixed
it. Now nobody can fix a car, but a
six-year-old can program a VCR."
Baker appreciates the ease af
forded his profession by the devel
opment of computers though he
worries that this ease "encourages
windedness and bad writing."
These problems have not tripped
up Baker, who received a Pulitzer

Prize for Distinguished Commen
tary in 1979 and a second for his
1983 autobiography, "Growing
Up."
After receiving a degree in Eng
lish literature from Johns Hopkins
University in 1947, Baker took a job
as a police reporter for the Balti
more Sun.
"I couldn't do anything else," he
said, explaining his employment
choice. "1 couldn't pass physics. I
couldn't play football."
After two years. Baker was as
signed to the Sun's London bureau.
"I loved London," he said. "I had
never been any place before to speak
0f.... I had been living with police
men for two years."
Baker covered the White House
for the Sun after returning from Lon
don, and moved to the Times in 1954.
He has no illusions about the press

and stated without hesitation, "The
press is disreputable. Its destiny is to
be disreputable ... The fact that it's
not reputable doesn't mean it doesn't
have a place. It keeps you posted on
where you are in the world."
If newspapers, magazines and
television existed during the Roman
Empire, Baker remarked, "they
might not have declined and fallen.
"Nazi Germany and Stalinist Rus
sia eliminated the press, and you saw
what happened there," he added.
Baker has been on campus all
week as the Lee Hills Senior Knight
Fellow.
