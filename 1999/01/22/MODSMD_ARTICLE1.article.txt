# Moosa leaves S. Africa
## Prof. returns after violence 
### Rachel Turow Contributing writer 
In the wake of political persecution in his native South
Africa, Ebrahim Moosa returned to Stanford this year to
study the Muslim religion and to create a dialogue that
will "provide an opportunity for people to learn and in
teract with cultures other than their own."
The Religious Studies Department has not offered a
full menu of classes on the topic of Islam in more than 15
years. Although the circumstances under which Prof.
Moosa arrived at Stanford were bleak, his presence on
campus has provided students with the opportunity to ex
plore Islamic culture and history at a much deeper level
than before.
On July 13, 1998, Moosa was sitting in the back room
of his house near the University of Cape Town watching
TV with his family when a fundamentalist religious group
called People Against Gangsterism and Drugs threw a
pipe bomb through the window of his house. The bomb
caused great damage and terrorized Moosa's family.
At the time, Moosa was the director of the Center for
Contemporary Islam and a senior lecturer for Religious
Studies at UCT. He was a visiting professor at Stanford in
the fall of 1997, and when the faculty in the Religious
Studies Department heard of his misfortune, they imme
diately offered him a position as a visiting assistant pro
fessor and a chance to flee South Africa.
Moosa concedes that the move to Stanford was not
easy. "After such a dislocation, coming as an intellectual
refugee ... deprived of freedom of speech and space, you
come with different baggage and are confronted with new
pressures."
But, at this point in the year, with two classes under his
belt — Religious Studies 27: "Introduction to Islam" and
Religious Studies 110: "Islam in the
Modern World" — Moosa feels he
has finally "found his feet."
Moosa's goals for his time at Stan
ford are very directed. He sees his
time in the United States as a great
opportunity to promote interaction
between cultures and religions and
explore the results.
"The kind of work I do is to look at
the question of intellectual tradition
of Islam and modernity and how
modernity questions religious tradi
tions. I look at society and how soci
eties in the modern world struggle to
maintain integrity and self-respect
within tradition and also want to par
ticipate in the modern world."
Moosa's primary work in South
Africa was in teaching and research.
He also advised the government on
policy issues that frequently arise in a
new democracy and the formulation

of South Africa's policy toward Mus
lims. Moosa believes there is great
need for discussion and examination
of the controversial issues surround
ing Islam in order to attain under
standing between religious groups.
"The factual situation is thai there
are 5 to 7 million Muslims in the U.S.
... and 1 billion worldwide. To say
they are all in a conspiracy against
Europeans is irrational."
Moosa believes that by one reli
gion or society studying another, each
will gain greater tolerance and com
passion through understanding.
"We study other religions, be
cause they are part of us and we are
part of them."
This quarter Moosa is teaching a
class on the making of Islamic tradi
tion, and in the spring he will teach a
class on the 12th-century Islamic re
former Ghazali. He is also a consult
ing associate dean for religious life,
where he aims to promote "cultural
and religious diversity with integrity
and without excluding anyone."
