FBI reports race motivates most hate crimes
WASHINGTON (AP) — Racial prejudice motivated more than half
the 8,049 hate crimes in 1997 that were reported to the FBI, the bureau
reported yesterday.
As in 1996, racial prejudice was the most common motivation for hate
crimes, accounting in 1997 for 4,710 incidents.
In order of magnitude, other reported motivations were 1,385 incidents
attributed to prejudice about religion, 1,102 sexual orientation, 836 ethnic
or national origin, 12 to disability and four to multiple prejudices, the FBI
said.
The 1997 data come from 11,211 law enforcement agencies in 48 states
and the District of Columbia, representing 83 percent of the population.
In 1996, there were 8,759 hate crime incidents, of which 5,396 were
racially motivated. But the 1996 data came from 11,354 law enforcement
agencies in 49 states and the District of Columbia, representing 84 percent
of the population.
Because the number of agencies reporting varies under the voluntary
system established by the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990, officials cau
tion against drawing conclusions about trends in hate crime volumes
between years.
They say the figures provide a rough picture of the general nature of
hate crimes.

USDA redefines rules for 'organic' food
PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) — In a reversal, the government is
drawing up rules saying that food cannot be labeled "organic" if it has
been irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top
agriculture official told farmers yesterday.
The labeling plan was developed by the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture in response to an outcry last year against an earlier set of rules organ
ic farmers considered too permissive.
The new rules governing fruit, vegetables and livestock will probably
be published next summer in the Federal Register and could take effect in
the fall, Jones said.
The department is trying to develop the first national standards on
organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry
guidelines.
U.S. sales of organic foods have grown 20 percent annually for the last
seven years. In 19%, they exceeded $3.5 billion. There are now more than
1(),(KK) U.S. farms trying to raise organic crops and livestock, according to
the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call organic.
For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides, herbicides or
preservatives, and livestock should be raised in an open-air environment,
without antibiotics or hormones.

Cuba vows to crack down on alien smugglers
HAVANA (AP) — Responding to a new wave of Cuban immigrants
landing in south Florida, Cuba's communist government said Thursday it
would crack down on alien smugglers who charge thousands of dollars for
the journey across the Florida Straits.
"Unfortunately, there has been a notable increase recently" in alien
smuggling from Cuba, Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez
said at a weekly news conference.
"The illegal traffic of people is a dangerous, unscrupulous busi
ness... and Cuba intends to adopt the most severe measures against
these people," he said.
In 1995, the United States halted a decades-old policy of accepting
most Cuban refugees rescued at sea. That ended a mass exodus of
refugees who set out in makeshift vessels to cross the 90 miles separating
Cuba and Key West.
But authorities still accept refugees who make it to U.S. soil, which has
created a burgeoning industry for smugglers who charge refugees up to
$8,000 and have boats that can outrun U.S. Coast Guard patrols.
South Florida has recently seen a surge in both Cuban and Haitian
refugees wading ashore.
U.S. Border Patrol agents are on pace to double the 1,200 refugees
they picked up in the 12 months ending last September.
