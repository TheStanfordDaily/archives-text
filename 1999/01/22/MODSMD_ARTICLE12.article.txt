### 
A one-man institution
calls it quits and reflects on
his stint on the edit hoard

MY THREE TERMS on the
Daily's editorial board have taken
their toll.
Against my wishes, writing commentary
for this lucrative page-four location has
become a bit of a mental game.
The game is a struggle between two
kinds ui players: people and institutions.
People have names and institutions have
titles, if only nebulous ones, such as "the
administration."
It is easier to sympathize with people,
and our editorials usually do just that. How
ever, institutions are stronger and they tend
to win more often.
I don't mean to be facetious; this little
model actually has great predictive value.
Consider some recent campus crusades
against institutional Stanford — socially
responsible investing, the plight of Prof.
Adolph Pfefferbaum, the departure of
Alpha Sig. People complained, but the
institution prevailed.
Even small victories on graduate hous
ing and tenure have not altered the playing
field. Only after enormous — almost insti
tutional— momentum gathered behind
them did the administration acquiesce.
Institutions are not evil; they win
because they have more resources and
more time. After all, reformers and rioters
among faculty and students will come and
go. Stanford will stay.
Of course, this is largely restating the

obvious. We all understand the rules of the
game. Reeently, though, I learned some
thing new: 1 would rather he a person than
an institution.
I am a resident assistant in Branner, a
job with a definite institutional twist. At
least, I ean understand why other students
would perceive it as such. As the year
opens, RAs somehow seem to have some
mysterious agenda (in line with the myth of
Res Ed indoctrination), when they alter
nately stir or contain mayhem among fresh
men.
Like most RAs, I love my job and don't
tbink it is particularly easy. Being an insti
tution among people can sometimes be
alienating. For me, the incredible rewards
of the job come when residents learn to see
their RA as a person and a friend.
I am suggesting that the experience of
changing from an institution to a person is a
singularly positive one. The move from per
son to an institution is a lot less so.
Unfortunately, that's the sense I am get
ting about my role on the editorial board.
Whereas only a year ago my opinions
seemed new (to me, at least), I now increas
ingly defer to positions the board took in
previous volumes. Sadly, few others even
recall what these positions were. Is my
memory becoming institution;*' memory?
My great fear is that soon somebody will
comment: '"We'll be dead and gone, but
Boris will still be writing editorials. That
guy is an institution."
It's time to move on.
Typing this last editorial, 1 still believe
that the page-four location remains lucra
tive. But it's better that another person fill
it.
