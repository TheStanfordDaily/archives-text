## Clomping toward inspiration 
### 
I WALK WHEN I
don't know what to
say. It's good exercise,
after a fashion, and a more
interesting means of pro
crastination than organiz
ing my sock drawer.
Oxford walks are a nice
change, though I tend to get lost; Britons
are liberal in their placement of cemeteries,
which is always a good thing, and Ridicu
lously Old Stuff (a novelty, as I'm from
Orange County) makes for better scenery
than the strip malls and pink stucco of
Southern California.
Clomping about in foreign rain has been
two weeks of good fun thus far, but my
walks of late haven't ended, as they normal
ly should, in inspiration (witness my column
of two weeks ago). The grand unifying the
ory I've developed as a result of this? Um, I
miss pink stucco?
My tutorial advisor, a fine woman who
makes me tea, told me today that my verse
is too obscure because I'm excessively fear
ful of overworked literary themes (a mouth

ful). "They're all overworked," she said.
"Though springtime may be a particularly
bad one. Love is getting up there too, 1 sup
pose." Note to self: Relax. Avoid poems
about fluttering leaves; set ex-boyfriend
crucifixion aside for a while.
She's right, but my phobia makes some
kind of sense; I've had a hard time striking
a balance between "Oxford is Majestic"
sonnets and my only work in progress,
known as "The Live Crabs I Tried to Buy in
Logan Airport as a Christmas Present for
My Roommate." "Shakespeare in Love"
was a pep talk, as its writers proposed that
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" began
as "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daugh
ter." This helps; it doesn't help much.
The productivity crisis may have some
thing io do with the pink stucco; 1 have no
great love for '70s architecture, but there
are parts of home — like my local beach,
which is watercolored on the wall of the
Stanford House for no apparent reason —
that I miss. That poster, I tell you, was
planted to force me into homesick cliches.
I'll have none of it! I am an original, and

I will write about Dungeness crabs all day
long!
So my advisor may have a point. I'll min
imize my hypersensitivity about the over
written and point myself toward the relax
ing stuff. 1 am still woefully short of a grand
unifying theme; as this is my second to last
column, it had better show itself soon.
1 considered coughing up an unpunctuat
ed mess of my notes from the past two
weeks. Considered an analogous mess of
Final Things, which sounded equally bad.
"The Here Is What I Know About Every
thing" poem doesn't have much on the
crabs.
In the end. I'm somewhere in the middle.
My best conception of "My Job," composed
rather beerily at a pub a few nights ago,
came out like this: this is what has happened
to me, and this is what I believe. I hope it
makes you happy.
Then I walked home.
