Just give him a chance

This letter is addressed to the ladies. I'm
sorry about this, but I really must continue
to be sketchy, as you like to say. 1 really
must turn my head as you walk past me in
White Plaza. I really must look up from my
mocha when you hug your friend over on
the other side of the Co Ho. When you
smile at me, I think I will continue to smile
back. I don't think I want to stop this. I
doubt that I can.
If we talk for a few minutes and seem to
hit it off, I think I really must ask for your
phone number. I understand that this may
make you feel uncomfortable, but 1 really
find myself obligated. If there is something
about your hair or, God forbid, the back of
your leg, and I stare, well, lam sorry in
advance. It can't and should not be helped,
If I ask you to dinner but you just met me,
I'm sorry. I know it's forward, but I can't
not be myself.
You see, there's this thing between men
and women (forgive the heterosexual
bias). Where I come from a man sees a
woman and he goes to her. That's just what
he does. He goes and talks to her or he
asks her to dance. He asks her to come

upstairs I'™, Wh '" ev " He *; mls 'I 1 ' 5
woman and he lets her know. Now this
woman may like him, she may not, either
can ' rca "y e 'J» though sometimes
' 1c a ' cc '' n S (which is often why he
B oes wvcr in lhe first P lace )- So S irl ma y bc
down, she may not. If girl is down she gives
chase - ,f she ' s not < she also S ives chasc < hut
not rea "y*
So we have this man chasing after this
woman, and that's as it should be. Except
her e« at th « s P'ace, something is wrong,
Man g° es to woman and declares his inten
tions in whatever way he does and then
woman gets nervous or scared or sonie
thing and she backs away mumbling to her
friends something about "sketchy." Man is
baffled, because he innocently moved
towards her. He made his intentions
known. Funny that even when this man
and this woman share intentions, this
woman will likely walk away mumbling
something about "sketchy." She does this
because that is what she has become accus
tomed to.
1 don't know what's happening. I'm
sorry that there are men out there who
declare their intentions in ways that are
too obvious. Or worse, there are men who
declare and enact their intentions simulta-

neously. These men get arrested, hopeful
ly. I am not one of these men. I am rather
one of the many men, most men, who
declares his intentions, albeit clumsily. No,
without fail clumsily.
It is the nature of things, as far as 1 can
tell, for a man to approach a woman. (Of
course I like the woman approaching the
man, but that's not my topic here). So why
is it that at this place we act against nature?
Why is it that when I declare my intentions
and make a fool of myself, you turn the
other way? This is the perfect time for you
to gain the upper hand and use my humili
ation to our advantage. Hut you don't do
this. You use my humiliation to your
advantage. I don't humble myself only for
you. I humble myself so that 1 and you
might become a "we." It's your turn, and
you are not doing your job.
In fact, I think my fellows are getting
discouraged. They are giving in to your
way. They are only declaring their inten
tions towards you in large group dates.
And in these settings it's too damn loud for
two people to hear each other in that most
intimate way. They say there is still con
nection at this place, but I don't like the
form it takes. We have avoided each other
and the dance so long that we have just

gotten frustrated. Now the dance, on our
little ski trip, when we're drunk, degener
ates into a clumsy stumbling and fumbling.
There is no dignity in this. There is no inti
macy here. You should have allowed me to
approach you with civility from the first. So
that J. could have romanced you and
seduced you and invited you upstairs. The
way things should be. The natural way.
Let's not blow it though. We are still
here together. You are intelligent,
enthralling and beautiful. 1 will never have
a chance to meet you again. This is the
time and the place. Let's not blow it.
And gentlemen. I think it is up to us.
Let us continue to declare our intentions.
Let us continue to turn our heads as we are
passed in White Plaza. Let us continue to
raise our eyes in the Co Ho. Let us contin
ue to be distracted by Her. We suffer
greater humiliation these days. We are
accused of being criminal in our sketchi
ness. though we have committed no crime.
Let us continue to act from our nature,
gentlemen. Maybe one or two will come
around, will turn around and sit back down
with us. Or maybe go upstairs.

Let us continue to turn our heads as we are
passed in White Plaza. Let us continue to
raise our eyes in the Co Ho. Let us contin
ue to be distracted by Her. We suffer
greater humiliation these days. We are
accused of being criminal in our sketchi
ness. though we have committed no crime.
Let us continue to act from our nature,
gentlemen. Maybe one or two will come
around, will turn around and sit back down
with us. Or maybe go upstairs.
