# A 						View from the Hill
## Thoughts on the last of the great birthdays

THE JUNIOR CLASS is coming of
age. Not a day goes by without
some bright-eyed third-year cele
brating newly condoned access to the last
great legal drug. In 10 days I join the party.
I'm excited for the cocktails, but this
birthday brings more than a real ID. A
21st birthday is like a summit dividing the
eager ascent of childhood from the treach
erous descent into adulthood and the real
world.
We can drink legally now, which is nice,
but you must admit that it takes away
some of the thrill. At least our parents can
breathe easier now, but what about the
challenge of beating a system rigged to
keep us out? That system embraces us at
21 and, like a parent using reverse psy
chology, it sucks the wind from our defiant
sails.
Now we are to act like adults. The hor
mones and nebulous forces of adolescence
should have ebbed by 21, and we now
must take charge with all we have learned
in our youth. Things are getting serious.
Turning 21 means the government

deems us old enough to use alcohol
responsibly. It also means we can become
alcoholics without too much trouble. It
means we can blow our money in a Vegas
casino. It also means we have to get a job
to earn it back.
The world carries consequences and
our shields are being stripped. We have to
worry about credit history now, possible
jobs and rent. Just any menial summer job
isn't going to cut it now that I am familiar
with the word "resume."
Turning 21 means we are allowed to
drive after a couple of beers. It also means
we are going to have friends die in car
accidents.
It means we can start to understand our
parents as people. It also means our par
ents are going to get old.
Diagnoses of depression, schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder run rampant amongst
21-year-olds. Police records are perma
nent.
Our 21st birthday is likely to be the last
birthday for which we yearn. No more
rights or higher status can be granted to us,

and each passing year simply means we
are getting older.
But it's not all bad. The years in which
we grew up were, on the most part, safe
and prosperous. The times we live in now
are teeming with technological innova
tions and attempts at social progress. It's a
good time to come of age.
Turning 21 means we're just in time for
the millennium party. It also means we get
to graduate as the class of 2(XX) (theoreti
cally).
It means we were Bart Simpson's age
when we started watching the Simpsons. It
also means we probably now like Homer
more.
Our life span has seen no wars and no
depressions. We had Operation Desert
Storm and a recession. We've had no mis
sile crises or McCarthyism. The Cold War
touched us in so much as we grew up
watching "Rocky IV" and rooting against
Drago, but, as for real danger, Reagan
made us feel sure that our strength would
maintain the peace.
Turning 21 means you can always muse

about '80s music and clothes. It also means
you got to listen to A Flock of Seagulls
and Men at Work.
It means we were alive for Carter's
presidency. It also means we can't remem
ber it.
We turn 21 during the "information
age" of frenzied technologies advancing
exponentially. No area, and probably no
school, depends on these technologies
more than ours. The changes we have
undergone in our lifetime defy the imagi
nation and challenge us all to imagine the
world 42 years from now. Loads of us will
soon enter the industries of technology
and throw in our lot with the future.
Turning 21 means we grew up using
computers. It also means we will probably
spend a large part of our lives looking at
them.
It means the financial figurehead of
your youth was Bill Gates. It also means
you know he's a geek.
When my father was my age, the civil
rights movements raged amongst the oth
ers of the times. Today Bull Connor and

George Wallace have left us in peace. The
government released a stamp with Mal
colm X on it shortly after Martin Luther
King Jr.'s national holiday, and it seems
the country has come far. But then the
scum of the earth dragged a man to death
in Texas and you have to ask what the hell
is wrong with people.
Turning 21 means we remember where
we were during the O.J. verdict. It also
means we probably don't know what to
make of it.
It means we repeatedly watched the
police beat Rodney King. It also means
you know the cops got off.
There is some unpleasantness in com
ing of age in America today. Responsibili
ties and pressures mount; America is not a
Utopia. There is also much joy in a 21st
birthday.
It was a good time to grow up. But now
we live in an exciting world and, hey, we
can drink.
