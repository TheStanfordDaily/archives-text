# 'Stanford's next big Internet start-up'?
## Grads launch search engine Google.com 
### Anthony Chiu Contributing writer 
Hoping to follow in the foot
steps of other successful Stanford
Internet startups such as Yahoo!
and Excite, two former Stanford
doctoral students recently
launched a new search engine com
pany, Google.com.
Google's founders, Sergey Brin
and Larry Page, discussed both the
technical and business sides of
their new company before about 40
people in the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building on Wednesday
night.
Frustrated by the irrelevant re
sults that Internet searches often
produce, Brin and Page worked for
three years to find a better solu
tion.

They came up with Page√üank, a
procedure that estimates the im
portance of Web pages by analyz
ing the link structure of the Web.
"Every single Web page can affect
every other Web page," Brin said.
"We consider not only [what
pages] point to you, but how im
portant they are."
With the rapidly increasing
amount of information that is
being added to the Internet, better
search solutions are in high de
mand.
As a result, Brin and Page saw
the potential for a new company,
which they have stopped out to
pursue.
"We had something really good
at Stanford and we wanted to bring
it to the world," Brin said.
Other unique features include a

"Stanford Search," which looks
through Stanford Web pages, and a
large number of cached pages.
Cached pages are comparable to
backup copies of sites, so that a
user may still access the page even
if it is not currently available.
"Cached links are useful because if
the page goes away or the server's
down, you can still get to it," Brin
said.
While the future is not certain
for the company that proclaims it
self as "Stanford's next big Internet
startup," Google has a good
chance of success because of its
flexibility. "Fortunately, we're not
locked into any position," Brin
said, meaning that they have not
yet had to decide, for example,
whether to maintain a search site
themselves or license their technol

ogy to others.
Google is being backed by "a
number of excellent 'angels,' only
some of which we have made pub
lic," Page said.
These sources of funding in
clude Andy Bechtolsheim, the co
founder of Sun Microsystems, as
well as Stanford Computer Science
Prof. David Cheriton.
In addition, Google plans to go
public, ideally making its initial
public offering within a year.
This is ambitious, as companies
usually take two to four years to
reach that stage, according to Brin.
The site is still resolving several
problems. "Duplicate links ... are
the biggest problem we face right
now." Brin said. "That's something
that is going to have to be re
worked in the next version."
