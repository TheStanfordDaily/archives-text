## No. 8 Stanford to meet undefeated BYU In enemy territory 
### Colleen Shaw Contributing writer 
What exactly does a home-court
advantage entail? When you are
competing against Brigham Young,
a school that consistently draws
thousands of fans to home matches
in the Smith Field House, the home
court advantage can be a motivating
factor for not only the BYU
Cougars, but also the visiting team.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tomorrow: Stanford (2-0) at
Brigham Young (4-0), 7 p.m.

The No. 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team (2-0) will take on thou
sands of rowdy Cougar fans as well
as the skills of the fourth-ranked
BYU volleyball team (4-0) tomor
row at 7 p.m. in Provo, Utah.
"We know that nobody is going
to be cheering for us," said junior
outside hitter Andy Witt. "Some
times, going into a place when you
have the possibility of disappointing
thousands of fans can be fun."
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves acknowledges the environ
ment his team will face this week
end.
"Every arena is hostile to a cer
tain extent to the visiting team along
with the genuine support given to a
home team," Nieves said. "This is
especially so at BYU. At BYU, you
know you are in enemy territory."

This match marks the start of
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
competition for the Cardinal. It will
be the second conference match for
the Cougars, who play against the
University of Pacific tonight.
Because Stanford competes in
the Pacific Division of the MPSF
and BYU plays in the Mountain Di
vision, this match will be the sole en
counter between the teams. Al
though Stanford plays against mem
bers of the Pacific Division twice
each season, the Cardinal faces
Mountain Division schools only
once.
Both teams concluded successful
conference preparation last week.
The Cardinal triumphed in two
matches against the No. 13 Loyola
Marymount Lions.
Stanford's wins last weekend
demonstrated the diversity of avail
able talent for the Cardinal.
"We have more than six players
who can get the iob done," Nieves
said. "Don't expect to see the same
players start each week."
The play of four Stanford middle
blockers was critical in maintaining
an advantage over the Lions.
"I think our middle blockers
showed that they can compete with
anyone," said sophomore setter
Brad Griffith. "They are some of
the best middle blockers in the
country."
Also figuring to affect the Cardi
nal's performance this weekend will
be the Stanford outside hitting duo of
Andy Witt and junior Ciabe Gardner.
ITiese two U.S. National Team mem
bers combined for 86 kills in the Loy
ola victories.
Stanford setters, Griffith and
freshmen Larry Witt, have both start
ed in one match and should con
tribute in tomorrow's match.
The Cougars also began their sea
son with two home wins against UC-
Irvine before they had to battle
rowdy crowds of their own when they
traveled to No. 6 Ohio State.
BYU returns many of the starters
who competed in last year's matchup
against the Cardinal.
"BYU always has a really good
team," Griffith said. "Most of their
guys from last year are returning to
this year's team, so it should be a sim
ilar type of match."
Last season, Stanford recorded
one of its most impressive upsets of
the season when it defeated the
Cougars in four games.
BYU players Ryan Millar, Ossie
Antonetti and Ingo Lindemann, will
all figure to play prominent roles for
the Cougars this season.
Millar, a former MPSF Player of
the Year, attained the highest Cougar
hitting percentage in the second win
against OSU, as well as adding 25 kills
and eight blocks.
Antonetti and Lindemann both
recorded 27 kills in the second OSU
victory, as well.
This early-season match between
the Cardinal and the Cougars can not
only affect the momentum and confi
dence of both teams, but has more

important possible consequences for
postseason competition. Maintaining
a solid conference record is important

to ensure entry into the MPSF Tour
nament which determines the partici
pants in the NCAA Championships.
