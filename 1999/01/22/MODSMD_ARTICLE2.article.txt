It's been 10 years of cleaning up after the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, but finally, all is in its place. The Stan
ford Art Museum, now known as the Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Center for Visual Arts, will re-open to the Stanford
community and public this weekend amid celebration and
entertainment.
On Jan. 23, the museum opens exclusively to Stanford
students and faculty from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; the following
day, it will open to the general public during the same
hours. Admission is, as it used to be, free.
"We're obviously very excited about bringing [the mu
seum] back to life," said Thomas Seligman, director of the
center. "We're particularly proud of how the galleries
look, and how the overall architecture has been restored."
The University spent $36.8 million on the museum to
undo damage done by the earthquake. The Cantor family,
which contributed 185 Rodin sculptures to the museum in
cluding those in Stanford's famed Rodin Sculpture Gar
den, helped pay for the re-creation of the museum.
Festivities begin today, as the center hosts a reception
for its members so that they may preview the new museum.
"We're expecting 3,300 at the reception, so it will be a big
event," said Seligman.
The grand opening to the public on Sunday will be ac
companied by a number of events. The day's goings-on will
be hosted by Suzanne Shaw of KRON-TV, and speeches
are expected from Provost Condoleezza Rice, University
President Gerhard Casper and the mayor of Palo Alto,
Gary Fazzino, among others. Visitors will receive a tour of
the museum's 27 galleries as well as its collections and ex
hibitions. Museum patrons will also be treated to music
performances and activities.
Exhibitions include "Picasso: Graphic Magician —
Prints from the Norton Simon Museum," open until
March 28, and "Pacific Arcadia: Images of California,
1600-1915," at the museum until June 27.
The museum begins its regular schedule on Jan. 27.
