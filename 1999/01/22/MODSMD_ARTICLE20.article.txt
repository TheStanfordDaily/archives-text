Home sweet home.
In the Stanford men's basketball
team's return to Maples Pavilion
after a demanding road trip to Los
Angeles, there were no flying cups of
coffee or cheap shots thrown as the
clock wound down.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford (16-2
overall, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
94. Washington State (8-9,2-4) 45.

Just a 94-45 final score on the
scoreboard, finalizing an absolutely
dominating victory by the Cardinal
over Washington State.
No. 3 Stanford (16-2,6-0 Pacific 10
Conference) suddenly discovered an
up-tempo transition offense that pro
duced 64 second-half points and a
number of rim-shaking dunks — and
the Sixth Man Club tore off the roof.
Washington State (8-9,2-4) came
into the game as the Pac-10's best
three-point shooting team. Solid de
fense from Stanford completely
eliminated the Cougars' perimeter
game, and they hit just one of 18 shots
from beyond the three-point arc.
Combined with a commanding
performance in the frontcourt by
Tim Yount> and Mark Madsen. who

both scored 15, Stanford's suffocat
ing defense produced its biggest win
ever against WSU, and its second
biggest margin of victory ever at
Maples.
The resounding victory produced
varying reactions from coaches and
players.
"It's my nature to remember that
I've been there," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery when
asked if last night's victory was par
ticularly fun. "I have empathy for the
opposing coaches and players."
Senior point guard Arthur Lee,
who sparked the 12-2 run at the be
ginning of the second half that sealed
the Cougars' fate, had a crystal-clear
conscience after the blowout.
"This is big-time college basket
ball," Lee said. "We can't afford to
worry about how the other team
feels. We work hard in practice every
day to put a good product on the
floor, so it is great when it all comes
together.
"Obviously we want to stay with
in the boundaries of sportsmanship
and win with class," Lee added. "But
if we win by 50,1 want to win by 60."
Last night — the second half in
particular — was full of things to
cheer about for Stanford.
