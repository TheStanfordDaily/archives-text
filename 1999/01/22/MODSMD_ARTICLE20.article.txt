Home sweet home.
In the Stanford men's basketball
team's return to Maples Pavilion
after a demanding road trip to Los
Angeles, there were no flying cups of
coffee or cheap shots thrown as the
clock wound down.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 3 Stanford (16-2
overall, 6-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
94. Washington State (8-9,2-4) 45.

Just a 94-45 final score on the
scoreboard, finalizing an absolutely
dominating victory by the Cardinal
over Washington State.
No. 3 Stanford (16-2,6-0 Pacific 10
Conference) suddenly discovered an
up-tempo transition offense that pro
duced 64 second-half points and a
number of rim-shaking dunks — and
the Sixth Man Club tore off the roof.
Washington State (8-9,2-4) came
into the game as the Pac-10's best
three-point shooting team. Solid de
fense from Stanford completely
eliminated the Cougars' perimeter
game, and they hit just one of 18 shots
from beyond the three-point arc.
Combined with a commanding
performance in the frontcourt by
Tim Yount> and Mark Madsen. who

both scored 15, Stanford's suffocat
ing defense produced its biggest win
ever against WSU, and its second
biggest margin of victory ever at
Maples.
The resounding victory produced
varying reactions from coaches and
players.
"It's my nature to remember that
I've been there," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery when
asked if last night's victory was par
ticularly fun. "I have empathy for the
opposing coaches and players."
Senior point guard Arthur Lee,
who sparked the 12-2 run at the be
ginning of the second half that sealed
the Cougars' fate, had a crystal-clear
conscience after the blowout.
"This is big-time college basket
ball," Lee said. "We can't afford to
worry about how the other team
feels. We work hard in practice every
day to put a good product on the
floor, so it is great when it all comes
together.
"Obviously we want to stay with
in the boundaries of sportsmanship
and win with class," Lee added. "But
if we win by 50,1 want to win by 60."
Last night — the second half in
particular — was full of things to
cheer about for Stanford.

sidelined since the season opener

with a sprained foot, made his long
awaited return to the lineup.
In his comeback, McDonald
scored seven points including a long
range three-pointer.
And he got teed up.
"1 was in the game for like a
minute and a half and he gives me a
technical," McDonald said. "1 was
thinking, 'c'mon man.' | Hut Jit was
pretty exciting. It's something I've
been waiting for."
Washington State's head coach
Kevin Eastman underscored the im
portance of McDonald to this Stan
ford team.
"Having Mike McDonald back is

very important for many, many rea
sons," Eastman said. "He's good.
He's real good. And they're better
with him."
On his fourth rebound. Young be
came Stanford's third all-time career
rebounder. The fifth-year senior cen
ter had six on the night to bump his
career total to 947.
And Jarron Collins continued his
great play off the bench, constantly
crashing the glass and creating sec
ond-chance opportunities.
Collins grabbed a career-high 13
rebounds, and has pulled down 41 in
the last four games.
David Moseley was also big off the
bench, pouring in 15 points including
a four-point play, when the junior for
ward was fouled on an NBA-range
three pointer that went in anyway.

Finally, junior walk-on Alex Gel
bard came into the game with 3:39 re
maining.
3:27 later, the crowd favorite hit
the game's final jumper to put a per
fect finishing touch on the contest.
Despite the overwhelming final
score, the Cougars were still in the
game at halftime, as Stanford led 30-
16 after a transition three-pointer at
the buzzer by Lee.
"In the first half we were a little
lethargic," Lee said. "We were kind
of standing around and watching. I
got a couple steals to start the second
half, and that kind of got us going. We
got out running, and guys were feel
ing it. We wanted to get some easy
baskets, and we did that."
Stanford hosts Washington to
morrow, at 3 p.m.
