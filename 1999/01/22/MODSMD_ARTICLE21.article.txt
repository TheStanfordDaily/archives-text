PULLMAN, Wash — With a 77-65
win over the Washington State
Cougars (7-8 overall, 1-5 Pacific 10
Conference) last night, the Stan
ford Cardinal (8-9,4-2) keeps in the
running for a postseason hid.
Although Stanford (8-9, 4-2)
didn't have a complete 40 minutes
of domination as head coach Tara
VanDerveer had desired, there
were great moments provided by a
number of players, with point
guard Milena Flores almost coming
away with a triple double, scoring
10 points, dishing out 10 assists and
grabbing seven rebounds.
Flores took the opening tipoff
for the Cardinal, quickly passing to
forward Sarah Dimson, who then
dished it to center Carolyn Moos
for an easy jumper.

ington State (7-8,1-5) 65.

Just a few plays later, Moos used
her 6-foot-6 height to block the
Cougars' Victoria Harrod.
The Cardinal rapidly built a 6-0
lead, but after a layup by forward

Bethany Donaphin, the Cardinal
stalled, allowing the Cougars to
come within one point.
Stanford, however, used its
tenacious defense to pull away,
building a 28-11 lead on a 15-1 run.
held by the continued strong play
of Flores.

'Yamasaki has absolute
flashes of brilliance. She's
a great student of the
game."
— Tara VanDerveer

In the run. she had five assists,
three rebounds and a steal that she
finished with a fast-break layup.
However, the Cardinal couldn't
keep up the intensity and the
Cougars were able to pull within
eight by the end of the half.
Washington State used its three
point prowess against the Cardinal,
with Jennifer Stinson leading all
Cougars with nine points, six of
which were from behind the three
point line. The Cougars were also
helped by Harrod. who overcame
three missed free throws early on to
end the half with seven points.
The Cardinal was lead by Lind

sey Yamasaki who put on her own
three-point show, and ended the
half with a pull-up jumper from the
paint.
"Yamasaki has absolute flashes
of brilliance," VanDerveer said.
She's a great student of the game."
After losing the momentum late
in the first half, the Cardinal came
out as strong as it has all year,
amassing a 2()-point lead within the
first five minutes. During this time.
Moos added to her six first-half
points with two jumpers and a
layup off an assist by Flores.
Donaphin also came out ready
to play, getting Stanford going with
a layup and then grabbing three
boards.
After the initial flurry, the Car
dinal slowed down, only scoring
eight points in the next seven min
utes. Stanford turned the ball over
three times in this stretch and Stin
son continued her attack with two
three-pointers and a steal.
Turnovers were a problem for
the Cardinal for the rest of the
game with six more in the last seven
minutes of the half. Flores. howev
er. did not commit any of these er
rors, dishing out four more assists
and making all of her free throws.
Moos and Donaphin were also
solid in the second half, with 10

points apiece and five-for-six
shooting by Moos.
As happy as the Cardinal was to
come away with a win. there was
still much concern over the incon
sistent play of the team.
"I thought we looked tired, but
[with WSU) running their Ilex of

fense, it is hard for us to guard,"
VanDerveer said. "You always
want to play them better."
With the win. Stanford has a
shot at putting its record at .S(H) for
the first time this season. Tomor
row's game against Washington (9-
6, 5-1) will be the third time the

Cardinal has had a chance to even
its record, with the two previous
games coming against Tennessee
and UCLA, arguably the two
biggest of the season.
Tomorrow will be no different,
with Washington one game ahead
of Stanford in the Pac-10 standings.
