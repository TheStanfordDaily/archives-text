# Gymnasts focused, off to Cal

Sometimes it really is about how you play the game.
If the sport is women's gymnastics and the game is
tonight's meet pitting No. 7 Stanford (1-1) against Cali
fornia (2-0). whichever team "plays the game" better —
meaning which has the highest scores or lands the most
routines — will come away from the meet having met its
objectives.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (1-1) at California (2-0), 7:30
p.m.

According to Stanford second-year head coach Mark
Cook, the (Cardinal's main objective coming into tonight's
competition is to improve both its individual perfor
mances and its team performance, not necessarily to win.
Although that would be nice too.
"We're not l(x>king at Cal as a team to beat, we are
more concerned with improving our performances," said
Cook.
In a sport such as gymnastics where individual and

team scores count more towards a postseason berth than
does the win-loss column, Cook's comment is a bit more
understandable. And while beating Cal is always a treat
for any Stanford team, the Cardinal is more concerned
with its scores and improving its routines.
"Scores are always really important. That's how we
qualify for the postseason," said junior Larissa Fontaine.
Despite its claims of indifference, the Cardinal should
be able to win this competition.
Stanford is more talented and has posted better scores
in each of its two competitions than the Golden Bears did
in their tri-meet victories over UC-Davis and UC-Santa
Barbara. Even Stanford's score of 192.570 in its loss to No.
4 Utah this past Friday night was higher than the 188.350
that Cal posted in the tri-meet victory.
ITiough Cal is coming off a victory in its season open
er and a relatively successful 1997-98 campaign in which it
placed sixth at the NCAA West Regionals and finished
the year ranked No. 28 in the nation, the Cardinal should
make quick work of the injury-riddled Bears.
Cal has lost three key performers and potential
starters during preseason workouts and will be deeply
hurt by their losses.
