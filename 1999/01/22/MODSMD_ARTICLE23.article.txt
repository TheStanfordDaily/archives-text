WRESTLING
â–  Tomorrow: Stanford (4-3) vs
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (4-5), 7
p.m., Burnham Pavilion.

"Cal Poly will be a tough team,"
said junior captain Zach Zimmerer
(133 lbs.). "But, if we wrestle well, we
will definitely pull out a win."
Cal Poly has wrestled some of the
best teams in the nation, doing fairly
well against them.
"They are a quality team with
wins over Oregon and BYU," said

junior Warren McPherson (165).
The Mustangs are led by Ail-
American senior David Wells (174),
who has been ranked in the top 20 all
season and has only one loss. He will
be pitted against Stanford senior
Shane Cross, which should be a
thrilling match.
"Cal Poly has some great
wrestlers and we have some great
wrestlers, so there will be a lot of
hard-fought matches that are excit
ing to watch," Cross said.
Junior Gan McCiee (285) is a re
turning NCAA qualifier and was the
key in the win over Oregon for the
Mustangs. He weighs in right around
285 pounds and he will battle fresh
man Andy Hunter, who weighs 225,
in one of the key matches of the
night.
"We have beaten them at 125,
133 and 157. The other matches we
have either not wrestled yet, or have
lost," said Stanford coach Chris Hor
pel. "As the saying goes, it should be
a real barn burner."
Freshman Steve Strange (165) is

a surprising newcomer for the Mus
tangs and took an impressive fifth
place at the prestigious Las Vegas
Invitational held on Dec.4 and 5. He
will match up with the Cardinal's
McPherson.
This is another match that will
need to go Stanford's way in order
for the Cardinal to get a win.
"A win here will give us a great
chance to finish the season with a
winning dual record, which was one
of our goals on the outset of the sea
son," Zimmerer said. "So, this is a
big match."
Another crucial match for the
Cardinal is at 149 pounds as junior
Frank Ruiz takes on Mustang
sophomore Cedric Hayman. Ruiz
came on strong at last weekend's
Aggie Open, taking fifth, but he will
have his hands full with Hayman,
who is one of the better wrestlers on
the Cal Poly squad.
Also, Cardinal freshman Chuck
Fairbanks (197) will wrestle return
ing Pac-10 champion Mike French,
who is coming off a shoulder injury.
