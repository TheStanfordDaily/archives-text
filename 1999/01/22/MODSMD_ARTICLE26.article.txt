# Cardinal to open season
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
This year's Stanford women's tennis team
is the youngest ever, consisting of four fresh
men, two sophomores, two juniors and a se
nior. As such, the team remains enigmatic in
the eyes of its opponents, including Illinois
State, which takes on the Cardinal Saturday
at 1:30 p.m. at the Taube Tennis Center.
"We're a scary team," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "People don't know what to
make of us."

■ Tomorrow: No. 5 Stanford vs. Illinois State

In fact, the team's outlook for the season
remains a mystery even to the team itself.
Nonetheless, having competed strongly in a
couple of individual tournaments over the
past few weeks, Stanford is sending some no
table warning signs to its competitors.
Last weekend, two upstart freshmen
made headlines in the National Collegiate
Tennis Classic at the Sherwood Country
Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Marissa Irvin
took the championship, while Gabby Lastra
picked up the consolation title.
"Marissa's getting respect — quickly,"
Brennan said. "She's probably the top fresh
man in the country."
Of course, the other freshmen on the team
might dispute that assertion. Keiko Tokuda
had an impressive showing in her first tour
nament, reaching the quarterfinals, while

Lauren Kalvaria is finally recovering from a
stress reaction in her feet and is looking to
demonstrate why she was a top recruit.
"[Kalvaria] has had an injury," Brennan
said. "But now she's ready to shine."
Lastra, on the other hand, has already sur
prised everyone with her steady composure
under pressure and will to win.
"She's the most improved player of the
season," Brennan said. "She has a great dis
position."
Meanwhile, veteran star Teryn Ashley
has not disappointed, having won the Pacific
10 Indoor Tournament singles title two
weeks ago and reaching the semifinals of the
NCTC.
"I'm pretty happy with my play these
days," Ashley said.
Brennan is also excited about the return of
senior Marisa Maclennan, who had been
studying in Florence for a quarter.
"Marisa's a fine player," Brennan said.
"We're glad to have her back."
While the team is expected to easily han
dle Illinois State on Saturday, Brennan is
looking forward to seeing his young team in a
dual-match situation.
"We're so young that any competition is
great," he said. "It's a learning process."
In fact, Brennan and the Illinois State
Redbirds' coach, Chris Hoover, are old
friends, having taught together at the Frank
Brennan Tennis Academy in 1983.
Both friends admit, however, that the Car
dinal, ranked fifth nationally in the presea
son, shouldn't have a problem with unranked
Illinois State.
