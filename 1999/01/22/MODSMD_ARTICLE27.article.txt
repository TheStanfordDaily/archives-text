## Stanford off to 'Silver State' 
### Ben Allen Staff writer 
The Cardinal thinclads will spring into
action this weekend as the indoor track and
field season kicks off in Nevada at the Reno
Event Center.

MEW'S TRACK AND FIELD
■ Today-Saturday: Stanford competes in
the Silver State Invitational and Pole Vault
Summit, Reno, Nev.

The Silver State Invitational, as well as
the Pole Vault Summit, will mark the first
opportunities of the season for Stanford to
monitor the progress of its track and field
juggernaut. And according to head coach
Vin Lananna, this year's squad looks even
better than the '98 team which took home
second-place trophies from both the
NCAA indoor and outdoor national meets.
"Our men's track team will be very, very
good this year," Lananna said. "We've had

a very productive fall conditioning pro
gram, and this weekend's meet will be a
good opportunity for the athletes to get a
good measure of where they are."
Stanford will send a host of jumpers,
sprinters, throwers and middle-distance
runners to the competition, which will fea
ture individual performances rather than
team competition.
Included in the Stanford contingent will
be defending NCAA pole vault champion
Toby Stevenson along with vaulters Chris
Folkman and Chase Wimberly.
Junior Mark Ganek will represent the
Cardinal in the weight throw and sopho
more Todd Beyerlein will be Stanford's
lone high jumper.
Perhaps the most promising feature of
the meet is Stanford's opportunity to test
out its new blood in competitive condi
tions.
Evan Kelty. last year's Oregon state
high school champion in the 200- and 400-
meter dashes, will compete for Stanford for

the first time in his keystone events.
Freshmen Jonathan Stevens and Logan
Taylor will navigate the banked hardwoods
in the 800-meter run. as Stanford will not
compete in any distance races beyond the
800.
Other freshman contenders include
George Curts and Chris Sprague in the
shot put and Ryan Meuse in the 4(H)- and
800-meter runs.
Also listed as a possible competitor in
this weekend's meet is Cardinal football
standout Troy Walters, who excels in the
sprints and would compete in the 55-meter
dash.
Walters' contribution to the Stanford
sprint corps could be prove integral to the
Cardinal cause, as Stanford's small sprint
crew has been something of an Achilles
heel in the recent past.
Sophomore speedster Mark Hassell
may compete in the 4(X)-meter dash, while
freshman Ryan Fernandez is also a possi
bility in the long and triple jumps.
