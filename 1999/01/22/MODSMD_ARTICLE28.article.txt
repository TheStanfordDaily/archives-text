Four of these athletes will also team up
for a 4 X 400-meter relay. Rounding out the

mer Pierson, Maggie Issac and Cassie Ro
muld. the ( 'ardinal is almost guaranteed to
score points in both the weight throw and
shot put.
Head coach Vin Lananna is looking for
ward to seeing his athletes compete.
"This weekend's meet should provide
our competitors with a look at where they
are," Lananna said. "For some of the ath
letes — the sprinters, hurdlers, jumpers
and throwers — it provides an opportunity
to get back into competition after a long
and very successful fall conditioning pro
gram. We train on a very high level, but be
cause our athletes are so competitive, they
need to compete. This weekend, some will
get that opportunity."
