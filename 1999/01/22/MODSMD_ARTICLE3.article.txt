# Alumnus killed in avalanche
## 
### Sierra Millman 
Twenty-five year old Stanford
alumnus Jeremy Mclntyre died last
Wednesday when an avalanehe
swept down a mountain slope in
Canada's Banff National Park,
burying him.
Robb Moss of Berkeley, Mcln
tyre's 28-year-old friend, lost only
his skis in the tragedy that he calls a
"freak accident." Although Moss
quickly uncovered Mclntyre's
body, he was unable to revive him
through cardiopulmonary resusci
tation, according to Reuters re
ports.
Before they accidentally trig
gered the avalanche, the two men
were enjoying a back country ski
trip in a mountain range near Lake
Louise, Alberta, 112 miles north

west of Calgary. Mclntyre and
Moss were experienced skiers,
aware of the risks associated with
their preferred sport.
A member of the Class of '94,
Mclntyre excelled in sailing, school
and song during his four years at
Stanford. His friends and former
teachers spoke highly of the former
Mendicant and sailing team mem
ber this week.
Danny Zimbaldi, a current Stan
ford senior, remembers Mclntyre
as a mentor and as "the most exu
berant person I've met.... He was
really helpful in helping anyone
with anything, even if he wasn't
even interested in it." Zimbaldi be
lieves Mclntyre will be best re
membered for"the joy he got out
of life."
An All-American sailor his se

nior year, he"was one of the start
ing players," said sailing head
coach Steve Bourdow. In 1994.
Mclntyre's final year at Stanford,
the team took fifth at nationals, the
first time the co-ed team had made
nationals in four years.
Several of Mclntyre's sailing
buddies, including Charles Meade.
Class of '95; Geoff McDonald.
Class of '93; and Zimbaldi mention
his exceptional sailing talent. Both
a leader and a team player. Mcln
tyre's "Zen-like" approach to sail
ing influenced other members of
the team, said McDonald.
Bourdow remembered one inci
dent as defining Mclntyre's charac
ter "In the final race of our qualify
ing for nationals, a high pressure
event... [we were] competing with
two other schools. We got into a

protest... over one of the rules on
the water, meaning that somebody
gets disqualified. The other guy [in
the protest] is one of his best
friends from [the University of
Texas]. I've never seen a guy cry
over winning a protest, but he won
it.and he got to go to nationals, and
his friends didn't."
An "outdoorsy type," who often
wore flannel shirts, Birkenstocks,
"some kind of goatee" and a grin.
Mclntyre's love of nature led him
to become an environmental engi
neer.
After graduating from Stanford
with a degree in civil engineering,
he attended graduate school at
University of Washington.
For the last two and a half years,
he worked for Golder Associates,
an international environmental en

gineering consulting firm.
"I can't speak for the whole
world," McDonald said, "but the
world is going to miss Jeremy. He
had an amazing ability to put a
smile on anybody's face."
