Despite what appears to be a bleak outlook
for global climate change, this year's Payne
Professor, Argentine Ambassador Raul
Estrada-Oyuela, remains optimistic about fu
ture international cooperation in dealing with
the results of global warming.
Estrada, best known for chairing the Third
Conference of the Parties to the United Na
tions Framework Convention on Climate
Change held in Kyoto last December, gave
the first in a series of four lectures on "Miti
gating Climate Change: International Part
nerships and Roadblocks" last night in Encina
Hall.
He said he intended this lecture to "give
the general picture" on the status of interna
tional relations concerning global warming.
Estrada stressed the importance of negoti
ation between countries in the process of mit
igating climate changes and reducing global
warming. He also summarized the progress
that has been made thus far at various confer
ences, including Kyoto.
Prof. Thomas Heller — Senior Fellow of
the Institute for International Studies, the or
ganization that appoints Payne professors
each year — described in his closing remarks

some of the problems in trying to unify coun
tries to act on global warming.
"We're dealing with the very heart of what
we call modernity but what is also one of the
hardest issues to deal with," Heller said. Deal
ing with global warming "is a politician's
worst issue in that its benefits are king term
and its costs are short term."
He also noted the "asymmetry between
what technologically advanced countries like
the United States and smaller countries like
Togo" know about global warming.
He pointed to this asymmetry as a problem
in unifying many countries to meet a general
goal to lower carbon dioxide emissions and
thus lower global warming.
Estrada began his lecture by giving a brief
explanation of global warming, which re
searchers believe is caused by "greenhouse
gases" trapping heat in the atmosphere in
stead of allowing it to escape. He spoke about
the natural phenomenon of the greenhouse
effect, which keeps the earth at a livable tem
perature, but he explained that this time the
climate change is human-induced.
He then outlined progress in the overall in
ternational effort to reduce global warming
