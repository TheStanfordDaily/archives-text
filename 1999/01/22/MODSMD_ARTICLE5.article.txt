# Fac Sen renews East Asian Studies, discusses morality
## Provost search committee named 
### Jennifer Stewart Contributing writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper unveiled the committee that
will select a replacement for depart
ing Provost Condoleezza Rice at
yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Developmental Biology Prof.
Lucy Shapiro will co-chair the com
mittee along with Casper. Student
representatives on the committee
will include linguistics doctoral stu
dent Emily Bender and ASSU Pres
ident Maren Norton.
Casper hopes the committee will
find a replacement for Rice within
the next few months.
" I hope it won't take many, many
months," Casper said. "No later
than the beginning of spring quarter
if at all possible."
He expects the new provost to
come from within the Stanford
community.
"Basically I believe we need
someone with a detailed under
standing of Stanford. Therefore we
are looking at an insider."
Casper said, however, that the
committee "won't rule out an in
credibly attractive candidate from
outside."
In addition, the senate unani
mously extended the degree-granti
ng authority of the Program in East
Asian Studies for five-years. The in
terdisciplinary graduate program in
epidemiology was also unanimously
granted a five-year reauthorization.
The unanimous and smooth
reauthorization of the East Asian
Studies program was in marked
contrast to the program's recent his
tory. In 1996 East Asian Studies was
reauthorized for only one year, and
a moratorium was placed upon un
dergraduates declaring it as their
major. The program was later grant-

Ed a two-year reauthorization so
that it could implement curricular
changes.
The changes in East Asian Stud
ies include the appointment of
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Jean
Oi as the program's chair, three new
gateway courses designed to attract
more students to the program and
the requirement of all majors to
write a 7,5(X)-word senior capstone
essay.
"1 am very pleased to take over
as director just as the program is re
structured." Oi said.
"The gateway courses should he
able to provide a broader knowl
edge of Asia as well as attract more
students."
In 1998 four students majored in
East Asian Studies, and five stu
dents minored in the program.
The senate also inaugurated a
new item dubbed the "Individual
Opinion," where a senate member
is granted the opportunity to speak
briefly on a matter of their choos
ing.
Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra
Satz sparked discussion among sen
ate members about the role of Stan
ford in moral discussion.
Casper responded to her sugges
tion of addressing morals in the
classroom by highlighting the role
that residences can play in moral de
velopment and discussion.
"We need to be more inventive
about the use of residences,"
Casper said. But, he added, "I be
lieve there is very little interest in
having these types of discussion. I
went to a dorm, and I wanted to talk
about impeachment, but the real
student interest was in my career.
"I just think one of the most ob
vious places [for moral discussion]
are the residences and not enough is
happening."
