# Bike Program nears its end
## 
### Abhishek Bajoria 
After almost four years, Stanford
is retiring its Bicycle Program and
program manager.
John Ciccarelli is leaving Stanford
at the end of this month to form his
own consulting company. Ciccarelli is
the coordinator of the $650,000 bicy
cle program that installed more than
a mile of new bicycle racks on cam
pus.
Major restructuring last year in
Transportation Programs led to three
layoffs, one transfer and Ciccarelli
being offered a delayed layoff.
The bicycle program, which has
been in effect since June 1995, was
meant to "support the bike as an ef
fective mode of transportation
around campus," Ciccarelli said.
He oversaw the installation of

3,(*X) new bicycle racks along with the
construction of new storage garages.
These new black bicycle racks
were designed to make it easier for
users to safeguard their bicycles.
These racks are now the standard in
new construction around campus,
and Ciccarelli himself designed them.
Ciccarelli also oversees other pro
grams such as the "Abandoned Bike
Removal Program," which confis
cates abandoned bicycles and do
nates them to charities and the needy.
The "Department Bike Recycle"
program has already recycled more
than MX) bicycles to faculty and staff.
The "Clean Access" program was
started two years ago to ensure that
people park their bicycles courteous
ly away from designated handi
capped areas and entrances.
Another one of Ciccarelli's re

sponsibilities is to provide incentives
for commuters to bike to campus. He
created the bicycle map that is now
distributed with the Stanford Direc
tory. He also supervises a towel ser
vice that provides fresh towels to bike
commuters if they wish to shower on
campus.
Stanford made an agreement with
Santa Clara County to keep the num
ber of campus car commuters at the
1989 level. If Stanford can keep its
end of the bargain, this agreement
will make the permit process easier
for future campus development.
Chris Christofferson, the associate
vice provost for facilities, said that the
program was originally started be
cause of the "need to have bicycle
planning expertise." Now that the
program is coming to an end,
Christofferson wants to emphasize

"less on planning, more on opera
tions." He said that if any more plan
ning help were needed, independent
contractors would he hired.
As of now, no new comprehensive
bicycle programs are planned, but
standardizing bicycle racks and in
stalling them in new locations are
Transportation Programs' goals. For
now, "we're assessing the effective
ness of the work already done,"
Christofferson said.
Regarding Ciccarelli's departure,
Christofferson said, "We're confi
dent we'll still be able to offer the
products and services we used to
offer."
Ciccarelli hopes that Stanford
continues to make campus more ac
cessible to bikers and is "looking for
ward to assisting Stanford in the fu
ture."
