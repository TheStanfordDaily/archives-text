# Wells Fargo, Stanford study ATMs

In order to get rid of long lines at
ATMs, a team of Stanford re
searchers has been working on the
"Wells Fargo Queuing Technology
Project" since last spring. Through
cameras and observation, the team
has devised models for Wells Fargo
to help its customers avoid long
waits.
Wells Fargo's wish to minimize
the length of time its customers wait
for service, along with a desire to
minimize the expense of placing
ATMs in unfavorable locations, led
to the emergence of this project, said
Wells Fargo Senior Vice President
Matthew Raphaelson.
Stanford's Engineering-Econom
ic Systems and Operations Research

Department began working with
Wells Fargo through a project course
lead by Sam Savage, the head of the
department. Wells Fargo paid Stan
ford about $ 15,(XX) for its research.
The study used digital cameras
and a number of other devices to de
termine the length of time customers
waited in line at ATMs, and to find
the locations where A TM use would
be optimized.
"Though this may sound basic,"
Raphaelson said, "it's very expensive
to do."
According to the researchers, a
single A TM costs at least $35,(XX) and
each requires $3(),(XX) per year for
maintenance, so a poorly placed
ATM wastes a large amount of
money and resources.
The study found particular loca

tions where ATMs were not being
used enough and other areas where
they were overcrowded. It has shown
that banks should not just add more
ATMs, but should relocate poorly
placed ones. Stanford researchers
are continuing their work with Wells
Fargo and are putting together a soft
ware package that would allow for
the detailed mapping of ATM loca
tions.
Tim Holliday, a second-year doc
toral student in Savage's depart
ment, described the project as very
unusual. He spent most of last sum
mer working on the project and at
tempting to determine the distribu
tion of wait times for customers.
Holliday described some of the
idiosyncrasies of customer behavior
patterns.

"The interesting thing about
ATMs is that if people are waiting in
line at ATMs, they don't get ticked
off at the bank, but at the people
ahead of them."
The results of the study are cur
rently being put into practice
throughout California.
"We're moving 120 ATMs into
high customer impact locations,"
Raphaelson said.
Thanks to the study. Wells Fargo
will not have to purchase all 120 of
those ATMs.
Eighty ATMs from low-cus
tomer-impact locations will be relo
cated, so the bank will have to pur
chase only 40.
Raphaelson is a graduate of Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business
and once studied under Savage.
