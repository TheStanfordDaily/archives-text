Alternative medicine has
gone mainstream. An esti
mated one third of all American
adults used herbal medicines in
1996, and spent over $3 billion on
them. Here are some of the most
popular herbs and supplements,
and the main reasons they're used
(many have multiple uses).
Immunity
Echinacea: Purple cornflower. Used
to strengthen the immune system.
Taken at first sign of a cold or flu
for about 10 days, then stopped.
Government-approved for immu
nity in Germany.
Astragalus: Huang qi. Traditional
Chinese herb often taken with
others. Used to boost the immune
system and aid in recovery.
Antioxidants
Taken to help protect the body
from free radicals, which cause
cell damage and impair the
immune system. Free radicals are
formed by metabolic processes,
environmental toxins, and
radiation.
Vitamin C: In high doses, may
help prevent cataracts, cancer
and heart disease. Don't take at
the same time as vitamin E
(decreases absorption). Usual
dose: 200 to 1,000 mg a day. Can
be toxic in higher doses.
Vitamin E: May protect against
heart disease and cancer, but not
established. Take with food
(increases absorption). Usual
dose: 50 to 400 IU per day. Higher
doses may be harmful.
Beta-carotene: related to Vitamin
A. Should not be used as a sup-
Echinacea, the most sacred
iteiiling herb of the Plains Indians,
luas popularized by an American
herbal medicine movement in the
1850s. Later it was flushed aside by
industrial-based medicines.
plement because it may increase
the risk of cancer and heart
disease.
Energy
Ginseng: A root. Stimulant used
for over 5000 years to overcome
stress and fatigue and increase
endurance. Siberian ginseng is
the most popular (also Korean -
can over stimulate, and American
- more expensive, milder). Taken
in cycles. Don't use if inflam
mation or fever is present.
Mood
St. John's Wort: Hypericum leaves
and flowers. Used for centuries as
a medicinal herb for the nervous
system. Today used for anxiety,
apathy, and mild to moderate
depression without the side
effects of new prescription anti
depressants (check with physi
cian before taking together).
More studies of effectiveness are
needed. Potency and purity of
preparations may not be ade
quately standardized.
Stross and Sloop
Kava Kava: A Polynesian root.
Soothing analgesic sedative used
for stress, anxiety, and nervousness;
relaxes muscles. Combines well
with Valerian and St. John's Wort.
Valerian: A root. Used for
calming effect for centuries, and
in over 100 over-the-counter
sedatives today. For insomnia
from anxiety, exhaustion.
Tips
■ Herbs are gentle and work
slowly, so give them time
■ Freshness counts, and natural,
high quality ingredients are
better absorbed by the body
(but may cost more)
■ Ask about dose, absorption,
time to kick in, side effects,
fillers, dyes, and how long to
take
■ Look for standardized extracts
(degree of potency)
■ Though not a substitute for a
diet rich in fruits and vege
tables, multi-vitamins may be
good for people who eat on
the-run
■ Folic acid, a vitamin, is espe
cially important for young
women to prevent brain and
spinal malformations in their
children (400 mg per day)
Explore, but be cautious.
Nothing is without its risks.
Educate yourself before taking
anything new.
