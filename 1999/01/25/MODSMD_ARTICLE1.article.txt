# Number of formal reports belies actual cheating problem; Stanford's honor code works well, say officials
## Cheating widespread nationally 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Staff writer 
According to recent research,
cheating may be more prevalent on
college campuses nationwide than
formal reports from professors
would indicate, as many professors
choose to discipline students person
ally or avoid confrontation entirely.
University administrators, however,
said Stanford's honor code system
and students' personal integrity are
factors that may make cheating less

of a problem on this campus.
An article printed Friday in the
Chronicle of Higher Education said
that professors often choose not to
submit formal reports on students
suspected of cheating because of
fears that students will not like them,
that they are responding too harshly,
or in some cases, that a lawsuit will
be filed by the student in question.
"In the majority of cases of trivial
cheating, I think most professors
turn a blind eye," Rutgers Universi
ty Associate Provost Donald Mc-

Cabe told the Chronicle.
"The number who do nothing is
very small, but the number who do
very little is very large,' he said.
In 1993, McCabe surveyed 1,80()
students on nine campuses and
found that 70 percent of the students
had cheated at least once during
their college careers.
Then, when he asked 800 profes
sors at 16 colleges if they had ever re
ported cheating, 40 percent said
"never," 54 percent said "seldom"
and only 6 percent said "often."

Stanford's judicial review process
At Stanford, however, adminis
trators said they feel the University's
system of dealing with cheating is ef
fective.
"While [the Office of Judicial Af
fairs] receives around 100 student
academic and behavioral inquiries
per year, I would say that the level of
integrity among Stanford students is
generally high," said Suzanna Mak,
judicial officer with the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs.
The office, run by a three-person
staff, is responsible for acting on al
legations of cheating submitted by
faculty or students and generated in
ternally. If a particular case warrants
it, Mak and her colleagues are re
sponsible for appointing a review
panel and processing the particular
case in question.
"Of the inquiries received, usual
ly half of them translate into actual
cases," Mak said. "Among that
group, around 60 percent turn out to
be cases involving the Honor Code."
Not all reported cases, Mak cau
tioned, will definitely lead to disci
plinary action.
"We actually encourage students
and faculty, and even students who
have questions about their own ac

tions, to approach us," she said.
"Our job is to help students and fac
ulty, not to only punish them."
Mak is, however, wary of the ar
ticle's findings.
"We must ask ourselves how ac
curate these perceptions really
are," she said. "One professor may
view one situation very differently
from another and as a result will act
differently."
When asked whether or not she
perceives this to be a visible prob
lem, Mak admitted that in some
ways Stanford may be much like
other institutions.
"In any population, these types
of problems always exist," she said.
"Fortunately, I think that Stanford
is continuously improving."
Professors at Stanford
Stanford professors are aware

of the importance of the way in
which they deal with issues sur
rounding cheating.
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Dan
Stack has had a number of experi
ences with student cheating prob
lems during his time at the Univer
sity.
"It's a very hard thing to deal
with," he said. "However, it is im
portant to maintain fairness among
the sometimes large groups of stu
dents in each class."
In the past, chemistry students
would have to take all exams in
pen, not pencil, so that any re
grades would be handled "fairly."
According to Stack, much work
had to be done to secure the cur
rent permissible pencil use.
"It all boils down to trust," he
said.
Stack feels that the ability to
prove that cheating actually oc

curred is the principal factor in de
ciding whether or not to report.
"Cheating is a very serious of
fense both here and really at any
other university," Stack said.
"It is vital to be absolutely sure
that your accusation is a correct
one."
Mathematics Prof. Ralph
Cohen agreed.
"One must be certain that
cheating occurred before acting in
a more substantial way," he said.
Cohen continued, "The integri
ty of the system must be main
tained so that all students will have
confidence that they are being
treated as fairly as anybody else."
"Cheating may occur more
often than many of us would like to
think. But, I view each of my stu
dents, at every level, as adults.
They only hurt themselves by
cheating." he added.
