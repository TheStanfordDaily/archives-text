# Number of formal reports belies actual cheating problem; Stanford's honor code works well, say officials
## Cheating widespread nationally 
### Ravi Chandrasekaran Staff writer 
According to recent research,
cheating may be more prevalent on
college campuses nationwide than
formal reports from professors
would indicate, as many professors
choose to discipline students person
ally or avoid confrontation entirely.
University administrators, however,
said Stanford's honor code system
and students' personal integrity are
factors that may make cheating less

of a problem on this campus.
An article printed Friday in the
Chronicle of Higher Education said
that professors often choose not to
submit formal reports on students
suspected of cheating because of
fears that students will not like them,
that they are responding too harshly,
or in some cases, that a lawsuit will
be filed by the student in question.
"In the majority of cases of trivial
cheating, I think most professors
turn a blind eye," Rutgers Universi
ty Associate Provost Donald Mc-

Cabe told the Chronicle.
"The number who do nothing is
very small, but the number who do
very little is very large,' he said.
In 1993, McCabe surveyed 1,80()
students on nine campuses and
found that 70 percent of the students
had cheated at least once during
their college careers.
Then, when he asked 800 profes
sors at 16 colleges if they had ever re
ported cheating, 40 percent said
"never," 54 percent said "seldom"
and only 6 percent said "often."

Stanford's judicial review process
At Stanford, however, adminis
trators said they feel the University's
system of dealing with cheating is ef
fective.
"While [the Office of Judicial Af
fairs] receives around 100 student
academic and behavioral inquiries
per year, I would say that the level of
integrity among Stanford students is
generally high," said Suzanna Mak,
judicial officer with the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs.
