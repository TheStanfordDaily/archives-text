U.S. planes Ore on Iraqi sites
WASHINGTON (AP) — American warplanes, threatened by Iraqi
artillery systems while patrolling the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq,
attacked two surface-to-air missile sites in separate incidents yesterday.
It was the second day in a row that U.S. jets enforcing the flight-inter
diction zone met resistance and fired back.
A U.S. F-15E Eagle fired a precision-guided missile and "sup
pressed" an Iraqi SA-3 surface-to-air missile site that threatened forces
in the area, the military said.
The missile scored a direct hit. Operation Northern Watch said in a
statement. Northern Watch operates out of the NATO base in Incirlik,
Turkey to enforce the truce that ended the 1991 Persian Gulf War and
bans Iraqi aircraft in the northern sector of the country.
The American fighter struck aircraft in the area reported they were
illuminated by the Iraqi surface-to-air missile system, said Air Force Lt.
Col. Dennis Linn, a spokesman at European Command headquarters in
Germany.
A pilot whose plane is illuminated, or locked on by radar, assumes he
is about to be fired upon.
Less than an hour after the first attack, a U.S. Marine EA-6B
Prowler and two U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons fired high speed
anti-radiation missiles after their aircraft were illuminated by Iraqi sys
tems.
The damage to Iraqi forces in the second incident was being assessed.
All of the American aircraft returned safely to Incirlik.
Welfare rolls at 30-year low
WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of people on welfare has fallen
to its lowest level in 30 years. President Clinton will announce today.
But the new figures also show the dramatic declines of recent years are
beginning to slow in certain states.
The president will also offer a package of programs aimed at helping
more people get jobs and encouraging businesses to continue hiring
them.
Nationally, just under 8 million people remained on welfare at the
end of September, down 44 percent from 14.3 million in 1994. But state
officials and academics alike have long cautioned that, at some point,
nearly all the people who can move off welfare with relative ease will
have left. That will leave those with deeper problems like substance
abuse, domestic violence and very little education.
"With welfare reform, the more you succeed, the harder the job
becomes," said Don Winstead, who heads Florida's welfare reform pro
gram.
Clinton hopes to make that job easier. Administration officials said
he will announce proposals included in the budget he will submit to
Congress next month.
