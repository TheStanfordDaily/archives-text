# Prosecutors question Lewinsky
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —At a
critical juncture in President Clin
ton's impeachment trial. House
prosecutors interviewed Monica
Lewinsky for almost two hours yes
terday and asserted her testimony
would help the Senate "determine
the truth."
After a session that triggered par
tisan convulsions even before it was
held, Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato
Cacheris, said she "added nothing to
the record that is already sitting
before the Senate right now."
Yet all three House managers
who participated in the interview
called the session productive.
"I believe she would be a witness
that would help them determine the
truth, and that's what we are all
endeavoring to do during this pro
cess," said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-
Ark. Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla„
said Lewinsky "might be a verv

helpful witness to the Senate if
called." Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
called the former White House
intern "an impressive person."
Cacheris said his client "was can
did, forthright and extremely truth
ful" but he insisted that anything she
told the Senate would cover familiar
ground. He urged the managers to
tell their colleagues that it is unnec
essary to call Lewinsky as a witness,
so that her "long nightmare" could
come to an end.
The House prosecutors were set
to meet Monday, the deadline for
submitting a witness list to the Sen
ate. Senators then will debate
whether to call witnesses before tak
ing two votes: first on a motion to
dismiss the case and then on the
decision to take depositions of wit
nesses.
The prosecutors also indicated
they wanted to talk to presidential

friend Vernon Jordan, who helped
Ms. Lewinsky in her job search.
Hutchinson said he met with Jor
dan's lawyer, "laying the ground
work ... in the eventuality that he is
called as witness. And hopefully, I'll
be able to talk to Mr. Jordan."
Separately, former Clinton polit
ical adviser Dick Morris was inter
viewed by House impeachment
investigators. He said he was asked
about his conversations with Clinton
as the Lewinsky scandal was break
ing a year ago. House managers, in
presenting their case to the Senate,
said Clinton's state of mind was
important when he asked Morris for
a poll on Americans' opinion of his
conduct with Lewinsky.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, meanwhile, said he would go
ahead with a plan to submit written
questions to Clinton, even though
White House lawyers — who first

suggested the questions — now say
the attorneys would respond rather
than the president.
"We will continue to prepare a
letter in hopes that the president will
respond to the senators' interrogato
ries," Lott said in a statement. A
response by Clinton attorneys "is
not a substitute for the president
answering the questions," he said.
In a move that shattered the Sen
ate's bipartisan approach to the
impeachment trial and caught sena
tors from both parties off guard.
Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's office obtained a court order
to help the House schedule the
interview with Lewinsky.
Starr told reporters outside his
home yesterday that his office took
"the appropriate action" and was
"not in any way participating other
than responding to requests" from
House managers.
