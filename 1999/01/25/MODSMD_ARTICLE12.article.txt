# Mexicans attend papal Mass

### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) —A million faithful
packed a dusty Mexico City racetrack yester
day to hear a call to arms from Pope John Paul
II — a summons to take to the streets and con
front the challenge of Protestant evangelism.
The papal Mass was a powerful display of
the aging pontiff's spell over this predominant
ly Roman Catholic nation. "Mexico, always
faithful!" chanted the crowd, intent on showing
the pope that their affection hasn't diminished
since his first trip here in 1979.
Organizers estimated the crowd at 1 million,
and thousands more listened from outside the
packed racetrack grounds. Parishioners
perched on sagging tree branches, stood on
friends' shoulders or clambered onto loud
speaker stands to view the spectacle.
Thousands of makeshift cardboard
periscopes poked above the crowd so that

those toward the back of the track, nearly a
mile from the altar, could catch a glimpse of the
pope.
John Paul urged his audience to ignore the
seductions of what he called "untruthful ide
ologies" and to spread the word of the Catholic
church — a central theme of his visit, in which
he has called upon his church to aggressively
combat significant inroads made by Protes
tantism.
"Be as the apostles: fishers of men," the
pontiff declared. "Do spread the word of Christ
to the ignorant! Be brave to tell the gospel in
streets and plazas, in valleys and mountains of
this country!"
Few in the crowd complained about the
cold, the overflowing portable toilets or the
mounds of trash.
Hundreds of people arrived days before the

Mass, and hundreds of thousands shivered in
temperatures that plunged to 23 degrees in an
overnight vigil.
As the sun rose, many kept warm by danc
ing, jumping in place and enthusiastically clap
ping to music played over loudspeakers. Still,
hundreds of people were treated for hypother
mia and other ailments, health workers said.
Sounding familiar themes, John Paul
demanded respect for the human rights of Indi
ans, ethnic minorities and the poor. He reiter
ated the church's ban on abortion and its
emphasis on respect for the family.
John Paul began his fourth visit to Mexico
on Friday. On Saturday, he announced a new
strategy for the church in the Americas:
Catholics must struggle against the excesses of
capitalism and the church must try harder to
reach the rich and powerful, not just the poor.
