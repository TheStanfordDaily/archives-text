Influence of Stanford profs'
research inspires students
and benefits university

TWO WEEKS AGO, Stanford was
named second in "worldwide sci
ence impact" by the magazine Sci
ence Watch. Maybe this is what the Admis
sions Office means when they tell impres
sionable high schoolers that Stanford is one
of the world's top science universities.
Hut maybe not. Science Watch tallied
the number of times each university was
cited in scientific papers in 21 fields from
1993 to 1997. This measures the brute force
of Stanford's science departments, which is
one rough estimate of how many papers
cited Stanford research. Hut, of course, it's
only one measuring stick. Ouality of teach
ing. for instance, probably also increases a
university's influence by making students
more likely to pursue science careers.
I hat being said, we should still be proud
of Stanford's high score. And don't cry
because Stanford was second to I larvard in
the study. Any university in the top of this
study has major, international scientific rel
evance. We probably already knew that
Stanford is a force to be reckoned with. We
know because our professors refer to Stan
lord faculty in lectures: "This genetics
study was done by so-and-so over at the
Med School." We read about experiments
done right here on our lovely campus in
our textbooks: "Such-and-such psychology

study showed us terrible, frightening things
about human nature."
Hey, our professors are even winning
Nobel Prizes. Keep up the good work,
folks. We know you were doing it just to
build up Stanford's science reputation.
Apart from the fact that international
recognition builds our egos, it is legitimate
to question how much it matters to us
humble undergraduates. Most of us aren't
the ones getting cited in the journals,
right? Well, not yet. Hut it's got to rub off.
We can go to researchers and beg for lab
jobs. Then we can get recommendations
for top-notch grad schools from world
famous scientists. In a lew years, we will be
the ones referenced in big-name science
journals.
Don't think we've forgotten about you
humanities students out there. The study
included social sciences such as law and
education, in case you thought you were
getting shafted. Fu/zies have the same
opportunities as techies to advance their
future careers by brown-nosing with world
famous researchers. So we don't want to
hear more whining about Stanford trying
to shove humanities under the carpet.
Of course, this is all a little cynical. Stan
ford's science reputation makes this uni
versity a better place because it attracts the
world's best students. Your genius friend
who finishes her ('hem 135 problem set
without even cracking her book wouldn't
gn to just any old school. Stanford's scicn
t.fic strong arm is something we can all
boast of because it benefits every student
and professor.
