## Learning from the real world 
### 
IT'S QUARTER TO
11 p.m. and I remain
one unit short for each
of my math and science
requirements. Frightened
by memories of Math 43
lectures echoing from the
walls of the Physics Tank, I

Hip desperately through the Time Schedule,
searching for "Philosophy of Math and Sci
ence" for two units. And then stop. Whose
requirement is this? Whose education is
this? Who's paying for this? Now, now, put
down your picket sign. I'm not demanding a
free quarter to make up for the 15 units I
burned on Philosophy CIV. I'm just throw
ing a shout out for a proactive instead of
reactive education.
The tricky thing about education is that
figuring out what you want to learn isn't
enough. The other dilemma is figuring out
the best way to learn it. For most people,
this process takes a while, a long while.
That's why I got so many "Dear Unde
clared Junior" letters (OK, I'm trash talk
ing. I would have received a bajillion of
those letters had I not forgotten to renew
my PO Box after freshman year. But any
way, for the sake of the point...). If you're
not yet consumed with a voracious desire
for knowledge every time you inject fruit
Hies with nicotine or comb the stacks of the
art library, don't sweat it. The people who
came out of the womb playing the clarinet
or speaking four languages — a pre
assigned life-passion — are few and far
between.
So let's say I begin by figuring out a few

things I would enjoy learning. Then I'll try
to determine which ones are best learned in
my current academic environment. It's
probably pretty difficult to prepare tor the
MCATs without going to college, but 1
could learn some European history by read
ing a book and watching some public televi
sion. 1 wonder if the topics best learned in a
university setting are those which are taught
best. Why is it that if I want to learn Bud
dhist social and political theory I can take a
15-person discussion seminar but if 1 want
to learn mechanics, I get a lecture hall
where questions are asked with micro
phones?
Post-colonial hegemonic discourse and
piezoelectricity challenge my brain cells.
Both concepts take a little more personal
attention, a chance for me to rephrase the
idea and ask questions. No wonder Human
ities has so little money compared to Engi
neering — they spend it on teacher salaries,
and rightly so. Huh, back when I was in the
third grade, there were only had 20 other
kids in my class, and 1 didn't even have to
pay for it.
So I've determined that, by the time I'm
80, I'd like to know a thing or two about
Elizabethan Poetry, World War I, knitting
and life in Malaysia. That part was pretty
easy. But even as a senior, 1 haven't quite
figured out the best way to learn these
things, and which of those are learned best
within my current academic environment.
I'm not going to learn how to change oil by
taking a class at Stanford. I'd miss out on
some quality time with my dad. On the
other hand, I'm not even going to keep

track of the characters in Tony Cade Bam
bara's "The Salt Eaters" without a profes
sor with a Ph.D.
Where academia falls short, it's your
responsibility to take learning into your
own hands and find ways to supplement
classroom learning with real-world experi
ence. Enter Ross Evans, coterminal student
and participant in the climate of global
change. He supplemented his interests in
engineering design and Latin American cul
ture with a grant-funded project to build
bike cargo trailers in Nicaragua. He learned
how to organize people, set up a shop and
navigate another culture, and those tensile
stress equations out of mechanical engi
neering books started to make sense when
bike frames failed.
A lot of times, students figure they'll slog
through school first and save the real appli
cations, the fun part, for when they're fin
ished. But you don't have to wait to take
advantage of a friendly faculty and founda
tions with big checkbooks to supplement
what's going on in the classroom, Ross'
URO became a small business that most
recently took him to South Africa. But,
you've got to ask, and you've got to be per
sistent. Hey, I had to apply three times to
get my crazy picture and crazy ramblings in
the Daily's Monday slot.

uct design, spent seven hours in the lab last
weekend earning her science unit by pro
gramming a motorized car to behave like a
