SLE succeeds in shaping
student lives and outlook
I recall during my college selection pro
cess reading a description in a college guide
book of a student's first day at Stanford. He
described meeting in a crowded dorm
lounge, and being told by a very intimidating
professor, "We aim to systematically chal
lenge every preconceived notion and belief
that you now hold." I also recall my own first
day at Stanford, meeting in that very same
lounge, and being told the very same thing.
I am a Structured Liberal Education stu
dent. I spend nine hours of class time a week
in the Flo Mo main lounge discussing and
analyzing the great texts of Western and
other civilizations. In this class I have
encountered a vast number of ideas and
intellectual traditions. I have studied how
these intellectual traditions relate, and I have
learned through discussion sections and
Ihrough working on papers with upper-class
writing tutors and professors how to think
critically about ideas. Most important, exptv
sure to these ideas has forced me to confront
all my previously held ethical, moral, and
religious beliefs, and in some cases, to recon
sider ideas which I held without question.
SLE is a class on par with the famous core
curriculums of C olumbia and Chicago â€” a
life-changing class that permanently affects
the way that alumni think about ideas, there
by helping them understand themselves.
Although Friday's article in the Daily did
not make clear what changes we can expect

to SLE in the future, it did imply that two
potentially disastrous changes are being con
sidered. The first change would be turning all
SLE faculty into full-time faculty. As it cur
rently stands, half of the SLE faculty hold
positions in the university outside of SLE.
These faculty add important perspectives to
the program. Most lectures are given by out
side professors, some from Stanford, and
some from other Bay Area universities. It is
this breadth of experience that makes SLE
such an engaging experience.
The second change is the slicing of the
reading list in half. The large size of the read
ing list is essential to the intellectual chal
lenge posed by SLE, as it forces students to
compare their own beliefs to many other
powerful, persuasive ideas. Most SLE stu
dents want this breadth. If they wished to
focus on a few works from a small region of
world thought, they eould've chosen an
Introduction to the Humanities course. Fur
thermore, if they become particularly inter
ested in one or another area of thought, they
can explore it further in classes taught by the
SLE guest lecturers. This opportunity to sur
vey the world of literature is extremely valu
able. and has much to do with why we who
chose SLE chose it.
The proposed changes would not
improve SLE, as Harry Elam stated in the
Daily, but would instead gut a unique, high
ly successful program and replace it with a
slightly different version of IHUM. While
IHUM seems to receive a positive response,
I have yet to meet a frosh who would
describe his or her experience in IHUM as

life-changing. If the Area One Governance
committee truly wishes to improve SLE, it
should ask current and former students and
faculty to work on improving the program. If
it wishes to destroy the program, it should
simply say so.
SLE can and should be improved, but this
is not the way to go about doing so. The
destruction of SLE would be a crime against
the widely recognized goal of the University:
to challenge and encourage students to think
critically about themselves and the world
around them.

SLE's goal is different
1 was dismayed at the changes the Area
One Governance Committee proposed for
Structure Liberal Education. The mere idea
of transforming SLE into a course similar to
Introduction to the Humanities is repulsive
by the mere fact that its intent seems to be to
diminish the quality of education.
The goal of SLE is to offer a more inten
sive and profound education than IHUM by
demanding more from its students; I must
question the integrity of a committee that
desires to reduce the workload that SLE stu
dents face, when SLE students have not
objected to this workload themselves.
Their claim that we are saturated by too
much literature to fast would have its foun
dations only if we earned the same number

of units as in IHIJM; however, SLE is a nine
unit class, and as such, we are expected to do
nine units of work. This makes us distinct
from any other Area One course, and for the
committee to try to make us assimilate elim
inates the option of doing what was so clev
erly referred to as "Super Accelerated and
Advanced IHIJM." For the Area One Gov
ernance Committee to suggest that SLE
reduce the number of works read by half
implies their desire to reduce the quality of
our education by half. If this were to happen,
how would we be distinct from IHUM?
Indeed, SLE offers those of us who wish
to transcend the boundaries of IHIJM a very
valid and tempting option. Instead of learn
ing just about "The Good Life" or "Themes
and Variations," SLE students savor litera
ture and culture from various times and
regions of the world. As such, we are a sur
vey course, not meant to thoroughly peruse
any work or spend countless days discussing
one chapter, but intent on galvanizing inter
est in further study of any work. In SLE, we
savor a piece of the whole, and whatever
seems particularly appetizing, we may decide
to study further by taking a course specifical
ly aimed in that area.
The committee's possible attempt to
force SLE faculty to accept full-time posi
tions further undermines the level of educa
tion SLE offers. This requirement would
compel SLE faculty who hold other campus
positions, such as being an admissions officer
or a professor of history, to choose between
the two positions. SLE could then lose some
of its wonderful faculty. Professors who

teach in other departments and SLE bring
current knowledge of that other field. This is
vital if SLE is to continue providing such a
high level of education.
Another concern in making SLE faculty
full-time is that SLE would he able to hire
fewer professors, which in turn, would result
in one professor leading more than one sec
tion. If this were to occur, not all sections
would be held at the same time, and this
would undermine SLE's communal atmo
sphere, where students and professors dine
together after section.
One of SLE's greatest aspects is that
learning transcends the classroom and
occurs at all hours of the day, including dur
ing the communal dinner. If sections were
held at different times, not all would end
with the shared meal and this out-of-class
education would be jeopardized.
Our main grievance, however, is that SLE
students have not been represented on the
Area One Governance Committee. If the
decisions affect SLE students, why are there
no SLE students on this committee? It is
only just that before the committee dictates
any changes, it hears our opinions.
I hope that the committee will have the
integrity to make only informed decisions
and listen to what SLE students opine. I have
every assurance that at Stanford, such deci
sions are made only with the utmost care and
regard for the benefit of education and
knowledge.
