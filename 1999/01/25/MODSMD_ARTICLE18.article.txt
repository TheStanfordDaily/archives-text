# Where we are
## Ambling around our own private Louvres 
### 
David Stein

THE SPECTACULAR NEW Iris &
B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual
Arts, like any other reputable depos
itory for the world's artifacts, has walls. And
therein lie its inevitable limitations.
For, despite its impressive — albeit mod
est — collection and graceful architecture,
the just-opened museum cannot escape the
unalterable fact that it is unable to follow us
home. It sits in its corner of the campus,
with its relics resting on pillars, its paintings
hanging listlessly from the walls and its
sculptures waiting patiently outside in the
mid-morning mist. The galleries cannot
move.
Of course, we must do the moving. We
make the journey through the museum's
open doors, and hopefully, we will be
rewarded with a healthy dose of Art and
Culture.
We amble through the halls of its many
wings, squint at the brief informational
plaques beside the works and reflect for a
moment on this or that painting's origins or
aesthetic worth. We go on in this manner
for some time. We might share a few whis
pered words with our companions, and then

once this silent, squinting expedition is com
plete, make a small purchase from the gift
shop. And then we go home.
What we take away from this strange
experience is unclear. Perhaps inspiration
or provocation — the intended effects — or
an appreciation of different cultures. Per
haps something altogether wondrous or
wholly inane. What in fact we do glean from
our day at the museum remains puzzling
because once we leave the confines of the
gallery, we become reluctant to talk about
what we've encountered.
It is uncommon, even in the rarefied air
of a university, to discuss art in public. Peo
ple might make a few passing remarks
about what they liked or didn't like, what
struck them as particularly memorable, but
any talk beyond one's most basic prefer
ences seems taboo. What we've learned
about art seems limited to the safe spaces
behind the museum's walls.
Over the dinner table, we'd rather talk
about politics than painting because, for
one, the former appears to have greater rel
evance to our lives. Rarely do you see cov
erage of a White House press conference

interrupted so the broadcasters may bring
you updates on the Van Gogh exhibit that's
traveling around the country. There are
scores of magazines concerned with sports,
news, fashion, hobbies and computers, but
only an occasional one about artistic
endeavors. The only time we hear of a
painting in the news is when it's been stolen
or sold for millions. Art is something we
consider when everything else is taken care
of.
In fact, attend most any museum and
you'll see what I mean. The two groups who
most frequently visit them seem to be either
tourists or senior citizens — groups whose
free time is copious. At times, you'll see par
ents pushing their strollers around, but this
excursion always has the flavor of baby-sit
ting rather than artistic exposure. 1 wonder
whether Picasso and Rodin knew that their
lifeblood would be on display in buildings
that have become part Club Med, part day
care center.
Hut larger than the problem of subjugat
ing art to a purely leisure activity is our col
lective inability to discuss works of art intel
ligently. I do not mean to suggest that all art

confounds us — even the most obscure con
temporary work will instigate some sort of
reaction — but that we do not have the
vocabulary to voice what we are thinking.
For example, a few years ago I found
myself, along with a cluster of five or six oth
ers, in front of a completely black canvas at
the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
We all stared at it, looked at it from differ
ent angles and then turned away, without
saying a word. I had definite reactions to the
piece, as in "What in the world is going on
here?" but 1 didn't know how to put that
confusion into words.
This is not to say that we need the jargon
of the art historian to be able to discuss art.
In fact. I believe that to intellectualize art to
an unnecessary degree, as is the task of any
academic, is to belittle it. But we do need
some basic terms and understanding of the
artistic world to be able to make both our
thoughts and feelings communicable. After
all, most people are more comfortable walk
ing into a car dealership than a museum and
discussing its respective wares, even though
we put so much more cultural value into the
latter.

At Columbia University, where liberal
arts education is more a truth than a boast-,
an Art & Humanities class is required of
every undergraduate. True, this course
functions like a rundown of the greatest hits
of the past 3,(XX) years, but it at least gives its
students the tools to go into a museum,
understand what they are seeing and then
be able to talk about it afterwards.
Of course, this class doesn't solve the
reluctance we feel to discuss art in the first
place, but it is an important first step. Why
Stanford has yet to take this action, in its
supposedly ongoing quest to make its stu
dents culturally active rather than mind
numbed computer fiends, is beyond me.
Because the value of the new Cantor
Center will ultimately not lie in its stunning
structure but in the people who visit it.
After we all, we move on, and the musei
um stays behind. !

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, suggests that everyone take some
time out of their busy schedules and go to
the Cantor Center. And then tell somebody
what you've learned.

we put so much more cultural value into the
latter.

At Columbia University, where liberal
arts education is more a truth than a boast-,
an Art & Humanities class is required of
every undergraduate. True, this course
functions like a rundown of the greatest hits
of the past 3,(XX) years, but it at least gives its
students the tools to go into a museum,
understand what they are seeing and then
be able to talk about it afterwards.
Of course, this class doesn't solve the
reluctance we feel to discuss art in the first
place, but it is an important first step. Why
Stanford has yet to take this action, in its
supposedly ongoing quest to make its stu
dents culturally active rather than mind
numbed computer fiends, is beyond me.
Because the value of the new Cantor
Center will ultimately not lie in its stunning
structure but in the people who visit it.
After we all, we move on, and the musei
um stays behind. !

David Stein, a coterminal student in
English, suggests that everyone take some
time out of their busy schedules and go to
the Cantor Center. And then tell somebody
what you've learned.
