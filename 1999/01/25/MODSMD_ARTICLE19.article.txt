## Lee takes control to earn Card win Senior point guard comes through in clutch for 67-60 victory 
### Will Flemming Staff writer 
It's official — Arthur Lee is The Man.
In the sport of basketball, that title is
reserved for a very few special players.
It describes the rare breed of athlete
who takes his game to the next level
when it matters most, a player who lives
to have the ball in his hands as the clock
winds down with the game on the line.
Ironically, the athlete who is by far
the best example of this notion just re
tired from the game. Beginning with his
game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA
Championship as a freshman at North
Carolina, Michael Jordan pulled off
countless game-winning heroics. In a
perfect twist of fate, the last shot of THE
Man's NBA career won a world champi
onship.
For Stanford, Lee is the player that
best fits that mold. Down the stretch in
last season's run to the Final Four, the
senior point guard made one clutch shot
after another, capped off by an unbeliev
able stretch of 2:05 in the Cardinal's
quarterfinal game against Rhode Island,
in which Lee poured in 13 points and
single-handedly kept Stanford's season
alive as the Cardinal returned to the na
tional semifinals for the first time in over
half a century.
Saturday afternoon at Maples Pavil
ion, Lee added one more heroic effort to
his resume.
With 54 seconds remaining and the
No. 3 Cardinal leading Washington by
just three points, Lee found himself
open at the top of the key. Without a sin
gle second's hesitation, he faced the bas
ket and nailed a three-pointer, putting

Stanford up 62-56 and ending any
chance of an upset.
After coming up with a huge steal on
the next defensive sequence, Lee struck
the final nail into the Huskies' coffin,
scoring four of the Cardinal's final five
points from the free-throw line and seal
ing a 67-60 win for Stanford (17-2, 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference).

MEW'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 3 Stanford (17-2, 7-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) 67, Washington (10-7.
3-4) 60.

In the end, Lee had scored 12 of the
Cardinal's last 17. nine of which came in
the final 3:34.
"I'm definitely confident with the ball
in crunch time," Lee said. "Far more
often than not, I believe I am going to get
the job accomplished.
"There was no doubt in my mind that
I was going to make that shot. I said,
'hey, I've been here before.' 1 was open,
and there was no way I was going to
pass."
With the win against Washington (10-
7, 3-4). Stanford stayed undefeated in
the Pac-10 and built a two-game lead
over Arizona, which lost to Oregon
State on Saturday. The Cardinal will
face the Wildcats in Tucson on Thursday
night.
But the Huskies were right there the
whole way. With just 2:38 to play. Wash
ington was within a point, 57-56. In fact,
junior guard Deon Luton had two open
three-pointers but was unable to con
nect from long range.
Stanford forward Mark Madsen

came up with a pair of huge rebounds
and despite struggling from the charity
stripe, knocked down a pair of late free
throws to give Stanford a 59-56 lead.
Then The Man sealed the deal.
"We knew exactly what was happen
ing," Madsen said. "Arthur Lee took
over. Period."
Madsen had a huge part in the win,
finishing with a game-high 20 points and
filling the offensive void left in the
frountcourt when Tim Young was on the
bench in foul trouble.
When he was on the floor, Young did
a solid job containing Todd MacCulloch,
Washington's leading scorer.
The 7-foot MacCulloch was coming
off a 31-point performance at California
on Thursday and was named Pac-10
Player of the Week 10 days ago for his
performance against the Oregon
schools.
"I thought one of the keys was going
to be foul trouble," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery. "Whoever
could get the big men fouls early was
going to have an advantage. With Tim
mie on the bench, [senior] Mark Seaton
came in and gave us huge minutes de
fending MacCulloch. That was critical
for us.
"To be honest with you. I was appre
hensive about this game because they
are a very good basketball team," Mont
gomery added. "I think Washington is
an excellent team that is going to be a
consistent factor through this league
race."
The Huskies led 29-24 at the half,
spurred by a 20-8 run in the final 11:27.
Lee went into the locker room with just
two points, and appeared to be forcing

the issue on offense.
"Art was frustrated with me because
he wasn't getting as many shots in the
first half as he normally does," Mont
gomery said. "He was right, so we want
ed to run some plays for him to get some
open shots in the second half."
Young had just six points in the first
stanza.
Madsen paced the team with 12, but
the Cardinal's other two starters, Kris
Weems and Peter Sauer, combined for
just two points in the period.
Sauer responded early in the second
half.
The senior team captain scored nine
points in a three-minute stretch to open
up the half, capped off by a three-point
er that gave Stanford its first lead of the
period.
"Pete typically responds in critical sit
uations," Montgomery said. "He was
slowed by the hip pointer [suffered on
Thursday against Washington State],
but you can count on him stepping up
when plays need to be made."
In fact, it seems the same can be said
of just about everyone on this Stanford
team.
In the closing minutes, "it was almost
like you could feel it coming," said
Washington head coach Bob Bender.
"You knew they were going to make a
momentum three-pointer.
"We played Connecticut [earlier this
season]," Bender added. "They are
deep, strong and mature. [Stanford] is
every bit of that. They are on a mission
this year. They want to win a Pac-10
Championship and they're playing like
that. A great team makes great plays,
and that's what they did."
