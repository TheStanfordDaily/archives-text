# Council proposes ban on soliciting
## Some students fear proposal unfairly targets the homeless 
### Jed Rose 
Three Palo Alto City Council
members have proposed a law to ban
panhandlers and solicitors from
street medians in downtown Palo
Alto and at the front of the Stanford
Shopping Center parking areas.
Under the law, these people would
be asked to move if standing in these
areas.
Student organizations and other
local activists, however, feel this pro
posed ban is a direct hit to the home
less. Shannon Frank, a former Stan
ford Homeless Action Coalition
member, said, "It's typical of Palo
Alto, and a part of a very long term
effort to get rid of poverty in this
area."
Council members claim this pro
posal is not an outright targeting of
the homeless, but a reaction to nu
merous occasions they have seen on
which near-accidents have occurred
because of distractions to drivers.
"It's a safety issue and a signifi
cant liability issue," Palo Alto mayor
Gary Fazzino told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "The folks soliciting are in
danger of being hit. 1 have seen a

number of near misses between mo
torists because they are distracted
from driving because of individuals
standing there, holding those signs."
Council member Micki Schneider
pointed out that the law would apply
equally to all people soliciting, includ
ing "Boy Scouts during the Christmas
season trying to sell Christmas
wreaths or people trying to sell tickets
to Stanford events."
Santa Clara, San Jose, Mountain
View and Corte Madera are some of
the neighboring towns that already
have such bans.
Angela King, a member of the stu
dent group Night Outreach, which
brings food to local homeless on the
streets at night, said, "It doesn't make
sense [the homeless] are not
doing anything wrong. The unhoused
who panhandle around Palo Alto are
harmless. If the city wants to get them
off the streets, they should give the
homeless an alternative. They should
try to help them out of their situation
instead of pushing them down fur

ther."
Stanford's official stance on this
issue is best summed up by Larry
Horton, director of community rela
tions. " This is clearly a matter that is
to be handled by the city council and
the citizens of Palo Alto, and they
handle that, and we have no opinion
on the matter," he said.
The topic was discussed at Tues
day's council meeting, where the
public was invited to voice its con
cerns with the proposal.
"We talked about it on Tuesday
and the ('ouncil voted 9-0 to refer this
to the Policy Services committee,"
said Schneider. The committee will
attempt to draft an ordinance, with
the help of city staff and the police de
partment.
She explained, "The council
doesn't come by these decisions out
of the blue; these complaints were
brought to us by numerous members
of the community."
Some critics have interpreted this
law as an effort to ban panhandling,
yet Schneider insisted, "there is no ef
fort on the council's part in any way to
inhibit anyone's First Amendment
rights."
