## Women earn key victory 
### Travis Neal 
SEATTLE — On Saturday night,
the Stanford men weren't the only
ones with a dramatic win over the
Washington Huskies. In Seattle,
the women (9-9,5-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) battled back from an early
15-point deficit to beat the Huskies
(9-7, 5-2) by seven, 70-63.
With the win and an Oregon loss
on Thursday. Stanford created a
logjam in second place, and its
postseason hopes became an
chored on firmer ground.
The story of the night was free
throws, with Stanford tying a sea
son-best 82 percent, while the
Huskies were cold, barely making
over 50 percent.
Junior point guard Milena Flo
res led the team in free throws,
making 10 of 11, including four in a
row early to turn the tide of the
game. At the time, the Cardinal
was down 13 and was shooting less
than 30 percent from the field.

With her quick hands, Flores
stole the ball, only to have it stolen
from her by Huskies forward
Amber Hall. Not to be outdone.
Flores raced down the court, got in
position and was charged by Hall.
As players went to the other end of
the floor. Hall continued to ques
tion the call and was given a techni
cal. With astounding composure in
front of a near sellout crowd, Flo
res made all four free throws, and
on the ensuing possession, Dimson
cut the lead to seven on a five-foot
leaner.
"I don't think we do anything
different [than other teams]," Flo
res said of the team's performance
from the line. "We have different
times [in practice] for free throws..
. and at the end of every practice we
try to hit 12 in a row."
The Cardinal run at the end of
the first half cut the Huskies' lead
to two going into the locker room.
38-36, and unlike the start of the
first half, Stanford came out ready

to play in the second. Less than a
minute into the half, sophomore
center Caroline Moos hit a nine
footer to tie the game, and a few
plays later, she came out of the
paint to drain a three, increasing
the Stanford lead to seven.
Moos wasn't the only Cardinal
to exhibit her long-range capabili
ties, Christina Batastini came off
the bench to go three for four from
beyond the arc. including two treys
in the second half that distanced
the Cardinal when the Huskies
were fighting back.
Batastini also contributed with
her foul shooting, and her hustle
down the court in transition al

lowed Flores to open up the Husky
defense and give the Cardinal some
easy baskets.
"Christina has been coming in.
and she gives us a lot of different di
mensions.'" said coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "She runs really well, she
handles the ball, she's been feeding
the post well, and I thought she hit
some huge baskets for us."
Although Stanford was able to
build leads of six points or more
throughout the half, the Huskies
seemed to gain energy from the
crowd, continually disrupting Stan
ford on the offensive end. Howev

Jamie Redd, the Huskies' scor

behind the three-point arc. Hall,
the other offensive threat for
Washington, was effectively taken
out of the game when she got her
fourth foul early in the second half.
She ended the game with only 11
points, her third-lowest total of the
season.

For the Cardinal, four players
were in double figures. Moos (12),
Flores (15), Batastini (13) and
freshman Lindsey Yamasaki (11).
Bethany Donaphin and Dimson
were quieter than usual with seven
points apiece, but their defensive
rebounding helped keep the Cardi

"This was a huge win for our
team, I'm really proud of them,
VanDerveer said. "We stuck to

half, made our free throws which
was big, just going to the line and
staying with things, and having
