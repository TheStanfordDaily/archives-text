# Huskies lose battle of big men
## 
### Brian Eule Editorial staff 
The Washington Huskies' publie
relations people point out that Todd
MacCulloch once "obliterated" a
board on a dunk while in high school.
They mention that the 7-foot se
nior was named last week's Pacific 10
Conference's Player of the Week
after averaging 23.5 points and 12.5
rebounds in two games.
And they also make reference to
the fact that the Huskies' center bears
a striking physical resemblance to
Bryant "Big Country" Reeves, a for
mer standout at Oklahoma State.
Stanford students, however,
thought he looked more like the giant
from "Jack and the Beanstalk."
But it was Stanford's big men who
proved to be more terrifying for their
opponents in the end on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion, as the No. 3 Cardi
nal defeated Washington 67-60 to re
main perfect in conference play.
The MacCulloch-Tim Young
matchup has been watched closely
for the past three years, and was sup
posed to be crucial in this game.

"I thought one of the keys |in the
matchup] would be foul trouble,"
said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery.
It was.
Only it was Young who got into
foul trouble early, rather than Mac-
Culloch, and yet the Cardinal was still
able to contain the Huskies' center.
When Young got his third foul of
the game with over five minutes left
in the first half, Montgomery knew he
had to do something to continuing re
straining MacCulloch. Just two days
before, when Washington had played
at California, the center exploded for
31 points and 17 rebounds.
Young "got a couple tickv-tack
[fouls] that MacCulloch didn't get,"
said Montgomery, who put in senior
Mark Seaton in Young's place.
"Seaton came in and gave us huge
minutes guarding MacCulloch."
And while Washington may have
one of the better centers in the con
ference, Stanford certainly has the
depth to handle him.
"It's a big challenge," Young said.
"I was just trying to beat him to the
spot and push him out. Seaton

stepped up well. Jarron [Collins]
stepped up well. We're a team. That's
how we play and that's why we win."
Although Seaton, Young and
Collins were containing MacCulloch.
it was Cardinal forward Mark Mad
sen who showed how a big man can
destroy a team offensively. Scoring
20 points and grabbing nine re
bounds, Madsen was an enormous
presence down low.
"He understands the post position
as well as anybody," said Washington
coach Bob Bender. "He's tough to
guard and yet everybody knows he's
a guy who can score on the block."
"It was just an intense game,"
Seaton said. "I always look forward
to playing MacCulloch. I really re
spect him a lot. The whole team
played really well on him today."
"Really well" equaled limiting
MacCulloch to 14 points and 50 per
cent from the field as opposed to his
66.5 percent average, good for plac
ing him at No. 3 in the nation.
"You can't really shut him down,"
Seaton added.
But Stanford certainly contained
him.
