Records and statistics can only tell one side of the
story.
After last Friday night's meet both the No. 7 Stan
ford women's gymnastics team and unranked Califor
nia left the Recreational Sports Facility in Berkeley
with two wins and one loss to their names.
But the similarities end there.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  Friday: No. 7 Stanford 193.775, California 188.350.

It was clear from the beginning of the meet who the
superior team was as Stanford all hut demolished the in
jury-riddled Golden Bears en route to an impressive
193.775-188.350 victory. The score was the highest com
bined score that Stanford has posted all year.
" They weren't much of a challenge for us," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Cook. "Our goal was going for
consistency and making improvements; we were awe
some."
If consistency was its goal, the Cardinal couldn't have

The Cardinal led the competition from wire to wire
as it captured event championships on all four appara

altacion said.
And Exaltacion was no slouch herself as she cap
tured event titles on the uneven parallel bars (9.8(H)) and
the balance beam (9.875) and took home second-place
honors in the all-around competition (38.425).
In addition to marking itself as a talented squad, the
Cardinal proved that it was a deep team as well. Besides
Fontaine and Exaltacion, four other Cardinal gymnasts
posted top-three finishes.
Freshman Katy Herbert continued her solid season
with a victory in the all-around competition (38.5(X)),
her second all-around victory of the year, and a second
place finish on the balance beam with a score of 9.825.
"Katy Herbert is an awesome competitor," Cook
said. "We're really pleased with her performance this
