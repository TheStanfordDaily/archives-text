# No. 8 volleyball falls to Brigham Young
## Cougars cruise in straight sets 
### Colleen Shaw Staff writer 
Before the No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball
team's (2-1,0-1) first Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation matchup of the season. Cardinal
head coach Ruben Nieves knew that his team
would have to play poised and organized on
the court in order to challenge the No. 4
Brigham Young Cougars (6-0, 2-0). Unfortu
nately, that did not happen.
Saturday night, the Cardinal failed to estab
lish strong team dynamics in its 15-6,15-12,15-
3 loss to BYU in Provo, Utah.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Saturday: No. 4 Brigham Young (6-0, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) def. No. 8
Stanford (1-2,0-1), 15-6,15-12,15-3.

"We got rattled," Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves said. "The one thing I empha
sized before the match was sticking together.
Above all, we failed in that way."
Although the 4,238 fans at the Smith Field
house at times affected Stanford's on-court
communication, the Cardinal expected to deal
with the challenge of playing the Cougars in
Provo.
"At some points, the crowd was really
loud," said junior Josh Palacios. "We had some
communication lapses."
Despite the challenges of the rowdy BYU
fans, establishing team chemistry was a much
more formidable obstacle for the Cardinal.
"We knew it was going to be like that,"
Nieves said. "It was more the internal factors
that got ourselves rattled."
Aided by the 10 kills of All-American Ossie
Antonetti, the Cougars jumped out to a quick
lead in game one. Antonetti's .750 hitting per

centage helped BYU capture the 15-6 victory.
"Volleyball takes a while and shouldn't be
determined in the first game," Nieves said. "As
a group, we didn't think that way."
After the Cougars established this early
lead, the Cardinal failed to threaten BYU
aside from a scoring run in game two.
After bringing Stanford sophomore setter
Brad Griffith and senior outside hitter Patrick
Klein into the match, the Cardinal disrupted
the confidence and momentum of the
Cougars, who were forced to call two timeouts
during the run.
"Patrick is a very exciting player," Palacios
said. "He started serving for us and made the
lineup much more intense. We rang off a lot of
points with him in the match."
Only after three match opportunities slipped
away did BYU finally capture game two.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal's scoring mo
mentum did not continue into game three.
Despite the team loss, Palacios as well as
sophomore Brett Youngberg contributed
strong individual performances.
Although originally this season Palacios in
tended to play at the middle blocker position,
Saturday night he played at the third outside
hitter position for the Cardinal. Nieves will fig
ure to use the versatile Palacios at both the
middle blocker and outside hitter positions
throughout the season.
"The other middle blockers were playing
well enough that we could concentrate him as
an outside hitter," Nieves said. "We want to
maintain his flexibility all season. We want to
have that card in our deck."
The consistent play of Youngberg, one of
the Cardinal middle blockers, has enabled
Palacios to contribute at the out i i de hitter po
sition. Youngberg, the Cardinal's most effec
tive attacker Saturday night, recorded a .421

hitting percentage.
Sophomore middle blocker Dan Zhang
also complemented Youngberg's skills at this
position. Zhang recorded live of Stanford's

seven total team blocks for the evening.
The Cardinal has less than one week to pre
pare for its next conference match against vol
leyball powerhouse Hawaii next week.
