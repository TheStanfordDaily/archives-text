## 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestling team (4-
4) fell to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
(6-5), 26-12 in a tough Pacific 10

Conference matchup.
The Cardinal was led by junior
Rudy Ruiz (125 lbs.) and junior cap
tain Zach Zimmerer (133). Both
showed impressive quickness and
dominated their opponents.

"Rudy and Zach are on a roll
right now." said Stanford head
coach Chris Horpel. "Zach has been
on a roll all season and Rudy has re
ally come on strong lately."
In his match, Ruiz fought off

great shots by Mustang sophomore
Jamie Garza, but was not able to
score in the first period. He began
the second period on top and was
able to tilt Garza to score two crucial
back points. In the third period,
Ruiz scored a stand-up escape, a
penalty point and a last-second
takedown to win 6-0.
"I really worked to cut his offense
down and increase my own," Ruiz
said. "Earlier in the year I might
have given him more takedowns,
but mv stubbornness showed in de
fending his shots."

■ Saturday: Ca I Poly-San Luis Obis
po 26, Stanford 12.

Zimmerer continued his winning
streak, and upped his win total to 18
this season in a 8-1 win over Cal Poly
sophomore Alberto Garza, brother
of Jaime. Zimmerer controlled
every facet of the match from the
tie-ups and hand control, to riding
well with his legs and having impres
sive takedowns.
"Mentally, everything is coming
together." Zimmerer said. "I am
ready for tougher competition."
Zimmerer began the scoring by
hitting a huge throw near the edge of

the mat that dazed Garza to score
the first two points of the match. He
maintained his lead by controlling
Garza on top with good pressure
and leg control. He opened up the
second period with another take
down, and was again able to fight off
any escape attempts by Garza.
In the third period, Garza be
came very passive and was wrestling
not to get pinned. However, Zim
merer was able to get a stalling call
against Garza and hit a great front
trip in the closing seconds to seal the
win.
"I was not surprised with Rudy or
Zach," said captain Beau Weiner
(157), who accepted a forfeit by the
Mustangs. "They dominate in the
wrestling room all the time and this
is no different. They made the Garza
family feel really bad tonight."
Three major matches could have
gone the Cardinal way that would
have led to victory. Ouestionable
calls and last second slips for Stan
ford proved to be the difference in
those close matches.
At 149 pounds, junior Frank
Ruiz gave up a last-second take
down that made the difference in
Mustang sophomore Cedric Hay
mon's 8-7 win. In the second period.


Joanna Hiatt — Daily file
Freshman Kenji Arai and the wrestling team fell to Pacific 10 Conference rival Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
on Saturday.
he was able to ride Haymon well
and was able to tilt him to his back
twice for five back points and a 5-2
lead. Unfortunately, Haymon was
able to dominate on his feet and
won the match with three straight
takedowns in the final period.
"Frank normally holds on to
those kinds of leads," Horpel said.
"He just needed to be more offen
sive in the final period."
Junior Warren McPherson (165)
had an inspirational match. He was
one call away from pulling out a vic
tory despite being sick for the last
week and only practicing Thursday
and Friday. Mustang freshman
Steve Strange was able to outlast a
weakened McPherson in a 12-10
overtime win.
"Warren was still pretty sick
tonight," Weiner said. "If he sees
Strange again in the Pac-10 tourna

ment and he is healthy, he will
stomp him."
Despite the illness, McPherson
was able to hit combinations of low
single-leg takedowns and trapped
Strange's arm in a Kelly takedown
to lead 8-4 after one period. But he
could not keep pace in the second
and third periods and let Strange
back into the match. With a stalling
call, the match was sent into over
time, and Strange was able to the
game-winning takedown.
Junior Tim Kendall (184) also
felt the effects of debatable calls by
the referee. In the process of using a
whizzer, in which Kendall trapped
Hart's arm between his arm and his
body, Kendall threw Hart to the
mat, causing Hart to suffer a knee
injury in which he was not able to
continue. The move was called ille
gal, which gave Hart the win and
Cal Poly the team victory.
"It was a bizarre turn of events
that gave Cal Poly the win," Horpel
said.
