It's doing it again.
The Stanford men's swim team is
crushing opponent after opponent
and remains undefeated overall.
And after this past weekend's com
petition, the team is undefeated in
Pacific 10 Conference dual meets as
well. All this crushing and winning
confirms the Cardinal's expecta
tions of repeating as NCAA and
Pac-10 champions.

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (6-0,2-0
Pacific 10 Conference) def. No. 10
Arizona State.
■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 5 Ari
zona (2-3,0-1).

The No. 1 Cardinal (6-0 overall,
2-0 Pac-10) defeated both No. 5
Arizona (2-3, 0-1) and No. 10 Ari
zona State over a two-day period.
Both were shattering victories, as
the team blew out Arizona by 50
points and ASU by 40. This week
end gave Stanford 16 straight dual
meet wins dating back to the 1996-
97 season.
"A lot of us are really on track to
do as well as we did last year, if not
better," said junior co-captain
Glenn Counts. "It is looking good
for us to swim faster than ever."
On Friday against the Arizona
Wildcats, Stanford set the tone for
the entire weekend by going one
two in the 400-yard medley relay.
Stanford's sure win was threatened
when Arizona grabbed the next
three events, including two wins in
the 1,000 and 200 freestyles by the
No. 1 distance swimmer in the
country, Ryk Neethling. After that,
Stanford only let one event of the
meet go to an Arizona swimmer,
again Neethling, in the 500 free.
Of the five individual winners —
sophomores Rob Canales (200 indi
vidual medley, 1:50.08) and Steven
Brown (200 butterfly, 1:49.00), se
niors Tate Blahnik (200 backstroke,
1:45.89) and Blake Holden (200
breaststroke, 2:03.75) and junior
Glenn Counts (100 free) — only
Counts posted a fastest time of the
season. Counts, a co-captain, won
the event in 45.12, moving closer to
reaching the NCAA consideration
time. Stanford closed the meet
against the Wildcats by pulling out a
victory in the 4(X) freestyle relay
(freshman Anthony Robinson, se
nior co-captains Justin Ewers and
Dod Wales and Canales) in 3:00.47.
In between the two weekend
meets, head coach Skip Kenney and
assistant coach Ted Knapp re
turned to the Stanford campus to
celebrate the Cardinal's winning
history. Ex-Stanford swimmer John
Moffet was inducted into the Stan
ford Hall of Fame and both coaches
were on hand to honor him and then
returned to Arizona for the meet
against the Sun Devils.
"Part of what makes this team so
great is the total commitment from
both the team and the coaches,"
sophomore Adam Messner said.
"(Kenney and Knapp] are really
dedicated to the history of this team,
but they also believe in us and our
future for winning NCAAs."
The Cardinal went into the meet
against ASU with the same tactic —
placing first and second in the 400
medley relay — and ended up with
the same winning results.
"Although some of the times on
the second day were tired times, a lot
of them were faster than against Ari
zona," Counts said.
Stanford won eight of 11 events,
only giving up the 2(X), 100 and 50
freestyles. Arizona State has the
fastest sprinter in the country on its
team in Francisco Sanchez, who
took the 200 and 100 frees, but Stan
ford still held on well in the quicker
events, always placing a Cardinal
swimmer in the top three.
In the second event against ASU,
the mile swim, Stanford swimmers
actually took all three top spots, with
sophomore distance standout Jere
my Kane winning in 15:32.62. Ewers
took the 200 backstroke (1:46.71)
and Holden repeated his 2(X) breast

(2:04.11) victory from the day before
in the meet against Arizona. Mess
ner, another top distance swimmer
and now 200 butterflyer, won the
500 freestyle with a season-best time
of 4:24.28, well under the NCAA
consideration time.
Stanford had one dual winner the
entire weekend. Brown posted a
pair of victories, stealing the 400 in
dividual medley (3:53.80) and hold
ing onto his 200-fly winning streak
with a time of 1:50.12. The Cardinal
closed out the weekend much as it
had started it by winning the 4(X)
freestyle relay (Ewers, Counts,
Messner, Wales) in 2:56.66, setting a
pool record. Ewers posted the
fastest individual time in a 100
freestyle of the day with a split of
44.10.
"[The relay] really shut down the
Arizona State sprinters," Messner
said. "It was an exclamation point
on a pretty solid weekend."
This weekend's victories gives
the Cardinal boosted confidence
going into a meet on Feb. 5 against
No. 14 Nebraska and unranked UC-
Santa Barbara at deGuerre. These
victories also offer the Cardinal the
knowledge that no matter what the
circumstances may be, it still has
what it takes to be champions.
"The meet against Nebraska and
UCSB is just another step along the
way," Counts said. "It is a chance for
us to post times and show other
teams that we are the best team in
the country. If we are consistently
putting out good times, other teams
will realize that they have to do
something significant to beat us."

Both were shattering victories, as
the team blew out Arizona by 50
points and ASU by 40. This week
end gave Stanford 16 straight dual
meet wins dating back to the 1996-
97 season.
"A lot of us are really on track to
do as well as we did last year, if not
better," said junior co-captain
Glenn Counts. "It is looking good
for us to swim faster than ever."
On Friday against the Arizona
Wildcats, Stanford set the tone for
the entire weekend by going one
two in the 400-yard medley relay.
Stanford's sure win was threatened
when Arizona grabbed the next
three events, including two wins in
the 1,000 and 200 freestyles by the
No. 1 distance swimmer in the
country, Ryk Neethling. After that,
Stanford only let one event of the
meet go to an Arizona swimmer,
again Neethling, in the 500 free.
Of the five individual winners —
sophomores Rob Canales (200 indi
vidual medley, 1:50.08) and Steven
Brown (200 butterfly, 1:49.00), se
niors Tate Blahnik (200 backstroke,
1:45.89) and Blake Holden (200
breaststroke, 2:03.75) and junior
Glenn Counts (100 free) — only
Counts posted a fastest time of the
season. Counts, a co-captain, won
the event in 45.12, moving closer to
reaching the NCAA consideration
time. Stanford closed the meet
against the Wildcats by pulling out a
victory in the 4(X) freestyle relay
(freshman Anthony Robinson, se
nior co-captains Justin Ewers and
Dod Wales and Canales) in 3:00.47.
In between the two weekend
meets, head coach Skip Kenney and
assistant coach Ted Knapp re
turned to the Stanford campus to
celebrate the Cardinal's winning
history. Ex-Stanford swimmer John
Moffet was inducted into the Stan
ford Hall of Fame and both coaches
were on hand to honor him and then
returned to Arizona for the meet
against the Sun Devils.
"Part of what makes this team so
great is the total commitment from
both the team and the coaches,"
sophomore Adam Messner said.
"(Kenney and Knapp] are really
dedicated to the history of this team,
but they also believe in us and our
future for winning NCAAs."
The Cardinal went into the meet
against ASU with the same tactic —
placing first and second in the 400
medley relay — and ended up with
the same winning results.
"Although some of the times on
the second day were tired times, a lot
of them were faster than against Ari
zona," Counts said.
Stanford won eight of 11 events,
only giving up the 2(X), 100 and 50
freestyles. Arizona State has the
fastest sprinter in the country on its
team in Francisco Sanchez, who
took the 200 and 100 frees, but Stan
ford still held on well in the quicker
events, always placing a Cardinal
swimmer in the top three.
In the second event against ASU,
the mile swim, Stanford swimmers
actually took all three top spots, with
sophomore distance standout Jere
my Kane winning in 15:32.62. Ewers
took the 200 backstroke (1:46.71)
and Holden repeated his 2(X) breast

(2:04.11) victory from the day before
in the meet against Arizona. Mess
ner, another top distance swimmer
and now 200 butterflyer, won the
500 freestyle with a season-best time
of 4:24.28, well under the NCAA
consideration time.
Stanford had one dual winner the
entire weekend. Brown posted a
pair of victories, stealing the 400 in
dividual medley (3:53.80) and hold
ing onto his 200-fly winning streak
with a time of 1:50.12. The Cardinal
closed out the weekend much as it
had started it by winning the 4(X)
freestyle relay (Ewers, Counts,
Messner, Wales) in 2:56.66, setting a
pool record. Ewers posted the
fastest individual time in a 100
freestyle of the day with a split of
44.10.
"[The relay] really shut down the
Arizona State sprinters," Messner
said. "It was an exclamation point
on a pretty solid weekend."
This weekend's victories gives
the Cardinal boosted confidence
going into a meet on Feb. 5 against
No. 14 Nebraska and unranked UC-
Santa Barbara at deGuerre. These
victories also offer the Cardinal the
knowledge that no matter what the
circumstances may be, it still has
what it takes to be champions.
"The meet against Nebraska and
UCSB is just another step along the
way," Counts said. "It is a chance for
us to post times and show other
teams that we are the best team in
the country. If we are consistently
putting out good times, other teams
will realize that they have to do
something significant to beat us."
