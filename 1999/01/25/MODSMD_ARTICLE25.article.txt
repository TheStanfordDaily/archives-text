## Men swim by Arizonas 
### Rebecca Rettig Contributing writer 
It's doing it again.
The Stanford men's swim team is
crushing opponent after opponent
and remains undefeated overall.
And after this past weekend's com
petition, the team is undefeated in
Pacific 10 Conference dual meets as
well. All this crushing and winning
confirms the Cardinal's expecta
tions of repeating as NCAA and
Pac-10 champions.

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (6-0,2-0
Pacific 10 Conference) def. No. 10
Arizona State.
■ Friday: Stanford def. No. 5 Ari
zona (2-3,0-1).

The No. 1 Cardinal (6-0 overall,
2-0 Pac-10) defeated both No. 5
Arizona (2-3, 0-1) and No. 10 Ari
zona State over a two-day period.
Both were shattering victories, as
the team blew out Arizona by 50
points and ASU by 40. This week
end gave Stanford 16 straight dual
meet wins dating back to the 1996-
97 season.
"A lot of us are really on track to
do as well as we did last year, if not
better," said junior co-captain
Glenn Counts. "It is looking good
for us to swim faster than ever."
On Friday against the Arizona
Wildcats, Stanford set the tone for
the entire weekend by going one
two in the 400-yard medley relay.
Stanford's sure win was threatened
when Arizona grabbed the next
three events, including two wins in
the 1,000 and 200 freestyles by the
No. 1 distance swimmer in the
country, Ryk Neethling. After that,
Stanford only let one event of the
meet go to an Arizona swimmer,
again Neethling, in the 500 free.
Of the five individual winners —
sophomores Rob Canales (200 indi
vidual medley, 1:50.08) and Steven
Brown (200 butterfly, 1:49.00), se
niors Tate Blahnik (200 backstroke,
1:45.89) and Blake Holden (200
breaststroke, 2:03.75) and junior
Glenn Counts (100 free) — only
Counts posted a fastest time of the
season. Counts, a co-captain, won
the event in 45.12, moving closer to
reaching the NCAA consideration
time. Stanford closed the meet
against the Wildcats by pulling out a
victory in the 4(X) freestyle relay
(freshman Anthony Robinson, se
nior co-captains Justin Ewers and
Dod Wales and Canales) in 3:00.47.
In between the two weekend
meets, head coach Skip Kenney and
assistant coach Ted Knapp re
turned to the Stanford campus to
celebrate the Cardinal's winning
