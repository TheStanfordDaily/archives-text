# Women split Arizona road trip
## 
### Chad Morse 
In a month where the Stanford
women's swimming and diving teams
have been sunk by flu and cutthroat
competition, team spirit remains
buoyant.
"There's no feeling of giving up,"
senior co-captain Elin Austevoll re
ported after a flu-stricken Cardinal
was dealt its second dual-meet defeat
of the season on Friday by the No. 3
Arizona Wildcats. On Saturday,
Stanford made its weekend a split de
cision by cruising past the Arizona
State Sun Devils on Saturday.
"We learned a lot with this [Ari
zona! meet," said junior Jessica
Amey. Amey pointed to the fact that
five swimmers, a third of the Cardi
nal's traveling squad, missed the road
trip because of illness, and "there was
not much we could do about it."
With some of Stanford's star
swimmers recovering back at the
Farm, this latest pair of dual meets
provided other top-caliber talents
with an opportunity to shine.
Emily Smith, a senior sprint
freestyler, has placed as high as 17th

at the NCAA championships and has
been a Pacific 10 Conference finalist.

A bona fide superstar on any team
other than Stanford, Smith had yet to
win an event as a college swimmer
coming into this weekend's competi
tions. On Saturday, Smith's name sat
atop the results list in the l(X)-yard
freestyle with a time of 51.35. The vic
tory helped propel Stanford to a com
fortable 174-122 victory over 23rd
ranked Arizona State.
On the same day, Smith came
within two one-hundredths of a sec
ond of capturing another win. In the
50-yard freestyle, she was touched
out at the wall by teammate Siobhan
Cropper.
Stepping up for the Cardinal once
again was a talented squad of fresh
men. " The freshmen have been con
sistently doing well," Amey said.

Freshman Sylvia Bereknyei returned
to swim for Stanford after having
been plagued by back problems earli
er in the month. Bereknyei captured
a pair of second-place finishes against
ASU, trailing Smith in the 1 (K)-yard
freestyle and the Cardinal's Misty
Hyman in the 200 freestyle.
Bereknyei also took third- and
fourth-place finishes in the same
events versus Arizona.
Shelly Ripple also did well for the
freshman contingent. With an im
pressive time of 1:59.15, Ripple blew
away the field in the grueling 200-
yard butterfly versus ASU. In a cruel
twist of fate. Ripple also competed in
the 400 individual medley. Requiring
both versatility and stamina, the 4(H)
IM is perhaps the swimmer's most
loathed event. Ripple finished sec
ond against ASU with a time of
4:24.79.
The only Stanford swimmer al
lowed to scoff at Ripple's busy sched
ule was freshman teammate Jessica
Foschi. Foschi took third at ASU in
both the 4(M) IM and the 1650-yard
freestyle, women's college swim
ming's longest event.

The Stanford divers remained a
source of strength, dominating the
ASU contingent. In the one- and
three-meter competitions, Carissa
Zenorini, Erin Sones and Kim Pow
ers nearly swept the Sun Devils. Only
one ASU diver managed to crack the
top three, and Zenorini led her squad
with victories in both events.
While her ailing team was suffer
ing in both depth and speed, sopho
more Misty Hyman came through
with two days of strong perfor
mances. The reigning NCAA swim
mer of the year won every event she
competed in. On Friday, she
outswam the Wildcats in the l(X)-yard
butterfly (54.07) and the 2(X)-yard
backstroke (1:57.89).
On Saturday, she again captured
the l(X)-yard butterfly and took home
a victory in the 200-yard freestyle as
well. The times were some of her best
of the season, and she seems to be
picking up steam as both Pac-10s and
NCAAs loom ahead.
As the dual-meet schedule moves
closer to conclusion, Stanford has its
sights set on Pac 10s and NCAAs.
"The dual-meets really don't mean
anything," Austevoll said. The Pac
-10 champion is not determined by
dual-meet record, but solely by the
results of the Pac-10 championships
in February.
Despite their team's recent trou
bles, both Austevoll and Amey feel
confident in regards to the remainder
of the season. Of the team's recent
demotion to No. 2 in the NCAA
rankings, Austevoll has an optimistic
take. "It can work to our advantage,"
she said of Stanford's new underdog
role.
Austevoll also stated that Stan
ford's recent losses should not come
as such a shock to the swimming
world. Along with illness and tough
competition, the Cardinal is a travel
worn team. Before the dual-meet
schedule resumed in early January,
the team had been practicing intense
ly at the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo.
