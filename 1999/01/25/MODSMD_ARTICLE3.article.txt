talism."
Comparative Literature Prof.
Hayden White, who has known
Jameson for over 25 years, said Jame
son was a "child prodigy" who stud
ied at Haverford. Harvard and then
in France.
According to White, Jameson was
drawn to western Marxism as well as
Jean Paul Sartre's existentialism.
Jameson ultimately wrote his disser
tation on Sartre.

As a "historical materialist,"
Jameson holds that understanding
the material conditions of life and the
means of production over time is an
important dimension of understand
ing history. White said.
"He believes that Marx has a cor
rect understanding of history," White
said, adding that Jameson's motto is
"always historicize."
In addition to acknowledging that
economics is a fundamental dimen
sion of life, Jameson draws heavily on
psychoanalytic theory in his work.
Jameson is interested in how "psy
choanalysis provides insight into why
certain works inspire some people
and not others," White said.
In his b(X)k, "Postmodernism, or,
the Cultural Logic of Late Capital
ism," Jameson argues that postmod
ernism signals the end of individual
style and idiosyncrasy.
