# Former dissident Michnik talks about Poland's 'rosy outlook'
## Good times ahead? 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Polish politician and journalist
Adam Michnik, one of the foremost
communist dissidents in Europe, told
a packed Stauffer Auditorium on Fri
day about his hopes for Poland's con
tinued post-communist success.
Speaking in Polish though a trans
lator, Michnik described his impres
sions of the transformation of Poland
from a part of the Eastern Bloc into a
democratic nation.
" The first miracle was in 1989,"
Michnik said. "'lTiere was a peaceful
transformation; without one broken
glass or execution squad, commu
nism was destroyed."
Speaking of himself as a chronic
optimist, Michnik joked about
Poland's success and economic
growth after the fall of communism.
"For the first time in history,
Poland has no large problems with
neighboring countries or minorities. I

sound like a communist politician or
a bad American movie politician
when I talk about such a rosy out
look," he joked.
Michnik compared Poland's ef
forts toward Westernization to "a
climber attempting to ascend Mount
Everest, who is close to the summit,
but knows that one wrong step can
lead to a fall down the precipice."
Educated as a historian, Michnik
is currently editor in chief of Gazeta
Wyborcza, one of the largest daily pa
pers in Europe. An integral support
er of Solidarity, the Polish labor
union that opposed communism in
the 1980s, he spent much time in
prison for his dissident activities.
When communism fell, he was elect
ed to the legislature.
Michnik said that he expected
Poland to become a NATO member
in April. He added that Poland is in
talks to join the European Union.
In regard to Americanism in
Poland. Michnik commented that
Poles are very accepting of Ameri
can culture and capital investments.
He added that this was one of the
barriers impeding Poland's addition
to the European Union, as "coun
tries like France see Poland as a Tro
jan horse, which America could use
to influence the EL J."
He cautioned against anti-Amer
ican sentiment, saying that it leads to
"religious fundamentalism, ethnic
cleansing and social experiment."
After his short speech, Michnik
took questions from the audience.
When asked about abortion, a
big issue in Poland because of the
dominance of Catholicism within
the country, Michnik said, "It is a
heated debate in Poland, [but] Poles
have not reached the point at which
they start to kill the gynecologists."
On politics, Michnik quoted a
Polish economist as saying, "The
best politicians in Poland are those
who are brave enough not to keep
their campaign promises."
