# Museum opens
## Revamped center hosts public fete 
### Kimberly Downs Contributing writer 
The "cool wind of dawn" swept
through Stanford this weekend with
the long-anticipated opening of the
Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for
the Visual Arts.
University President Gerhard
Casper used the above-quoted
phrase to describe his hopes for the
newly renovated art museum's role
in the community when he spoke at
the opening of the museum on Satur
day.
Thomas Seligman, director of the
center, agreed with President
Casper's idea of what the museum
should be. "I hope we'll be an oasis in
the lives of people to detox from the
pressures of the University," he said.
The festivities this weekend pro
vided the first tantalizing sip from
this oasis. The museum was opened
on Saturday exclusively for members
of the Stanford community, who
strolled through the museum from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m. as notes of various
musical groups such as Stanford
Taiko, the Stanford Mendicants and
Talisman wafted through the air.

At the grand opening to the pub
lic on Sunday, Suzanne Shaw of
K.RON-TV hosted the events and
Provost Condoleezza Rice and the
mayor of Palo Alto, Gary Fazzino,
spoke.
Students had overwhelming
praise for the new museum.
"You walk in, and you look up,
and you're like, 'wow, I can't believe
my school has a museum of this cal
iber,' " said freshman Melinda Kong.
"The collection is much better
than the J. Paul Getty Museum's col
lection." said freshman Mike Ross.
"I'll go back because it's a conducive
atmosphere [to] relaxing."
The museum's extensive collec
tion includes galleries dedicated to
the Ancient Mediterranean, Africa,
Oceania, Asia, the ancient Americ
as, Native American art, European
and American art in the past two
centuries, Rodin's sculptures and
contemporary art.
Besides their regular collection,
which originated from Leland Stan
ford Jr's own collection of art, the
museum currently has special exhibi
tions including "Picasso: Graphic
Magician, Prints from the Norton
Simson Museum," "Three Models:
The Design Competition" and "Ead
weard Muybridge: Before and After
Science."
"I'd go back to see the traveling
collections, like the Picasso, and I'd
go back because there's so much to
see," said freshman Abby Shaw. "It's
a nice place to go if you need to get a
break from Stanford life."
"It's definitely worth revisiting, "
said senior Amit Sinha. "As a senior I
want to take advantage of having a

museum that great so close to me.
We're lucky to have such an exten
sive collection available as students."
"Without exposure to artistic
imagination and creativity, our un
derstanding of the human condition
would be narrow and shallow," said
Casper. "I am deeply grateful to all
who made the renovation possible."
"I hope we'll provide a stimulating
resource for both students and facul
ty to learn with and from." said Selig
man.
The museum's regular schedule
will begin this Wednesday. It will be
open Wednesday through Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Thurs
days from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admis
sion is free.
