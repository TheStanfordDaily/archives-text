# Pro-life vigil mourns Roe v. Wade decision
## 
### Jose Paterno 
On Friday night, members of the
Stanford community participated in
a candlelight vigil in response to the
26th anniversary of the Supreme
Court decision Roe v. Wade which
legalized abortion throughout the
United States.
Stanford Students for Life, a five
year-old non-religiously affiliated or
ganization. sponsored the event,
which drew about 15 participants.
Sophomore co-presidents Anne
Berry and Brendan Stuhan de
scribed the evening as a way "to com
memorate the millions of lives lost as
a result of abortion."
"People should see what a disas
ter Roe v. Wade has become," said
Stuhan. "Its impact has had horrible
effects for many people in this coun
try: many still do not see how costly it
has become."
The vigil consisted of various
readings, starting with the Supreme

Court's 1973 decision and including
poems and personal accounts such as
"Olivia's Story," a vivid description
of a young woman's struggle with
abortion and its aftereffects. One ex
cerpt focused on the notion that
"today a baby is a baby when conve
nient."
Also included was a nurse's
graphic testimony of a "partial
birth" abortion given during the
Congressional hearings for the pro
posed bill to ban such abortions,
which passed but was vetoed by Pres
ident Clinton.
The emotional vigil concluded
with a "Chronology of a Baby's
Life," an account of an abortion seen
through the eyes of a fetus.
At the end. Stuhan thanked those
in attendance for their "courage of
conviction" and warned everyone
"not to forget the magnitude of what
happened 26 years ago."

Polish political activist Adam Michnik spoke Friday on his experi
ences as an anti-communist dissident and assisting in his nation's
move to democracy.
Sophomore Nancy Alvarez re
marked afterwards, "I came because
this issue is truly simple to me. It's a
life, not just a compound of tissue. It's
murder."
Many members of the Stanford
community disagree, however.
Fabienne McPhail, director of the
Women's Center, said in an inter
view that "the pro-life movement
tends to be charged, heated and in
sensitive. People should see Roe v.

Wade as the most critical legal deci
sion for women's liberation."
"Many people view an abortion
as irresponsible, but sometimes an
abortion can be the most responsible
thing a woman could do," said
McPhail. "The decision to have an
abortion is very difficult for women
Mnd the men who support them. In
the future, we must encourage dia
logue between both groups on cam
pus."
Freshman Anne-Lise Quach also
remarked, "People shouldn't inter
fere in a personal right regarding
what a woman can or can't do."
