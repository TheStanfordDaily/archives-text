## Senator proposes end to trial 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — As
senators from both parties strug
gled with the question of calling wit
nesses, a senior Democrat today
introduced a motion asking the
Senate dismiss the perjury and
obstruction of justice charges
against President Clinton and end
his impeachment trial.
House prosecutors immediately
opposed the request from Sen.
Robert Byrd. D-W.V., saying that
dismissing the charges without call
ing witnesses would be "inconsis
tent with the constitutional stan
dards and harmful to the institu
tions of our government."
Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
told the senators that the White
House arguments — that Clinton's
offenses in concealing an affair with
Monica Lewinsky didn't rise to the
level of high crimes and misde
meanors— "will debase and

degrade the institution of the presi
dency."
"I ask you to consider the harm
he caused, the indignity he brought
to the institution of the presidency,"
Canady said.
Even before Byrd made his plea.
Republican Leader Trent Lott. R-
Miss.. declared he had enough GOP
votes to defeat it.
"We have the votes, 1 believe,
not to dismiss it at this point," Lott
said. "I think that is a short-circuit
ing of the process that would not he
fair. The American people would
not agree with that."
Earlier, Republicans summarily
rejected a plan that would have
brought the trial to an end on Fri
day with no witnesses. The White
House criticized the decision.
Lott said senators would vote
Tuesday or Wednesday on the
more difficult issue of whether to

allow House prosecutors to call wit
nesses. As both sides met in private,
Lott declined to predict the out
come of that later tloor vote.
The House prosecution team,
meanwhile, eliminated from its
potential witness list a number of
women mentioned in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case.
Among those dropped: Kathleen
Willey. who accused the president
of making a sexual advance near
the Oval Office. Former Clinton
political consultant Dick Morris
also was dropped.
One House official, speaking
only on condition of anonymity,
said the prosecutors may ask for
only three witnesses: Monica
Lewinsky, Betty Currie and one of
three others — presidential friend
Vernon Jordan. White House aides
Sidney Blumenthal and John
Podesta.
