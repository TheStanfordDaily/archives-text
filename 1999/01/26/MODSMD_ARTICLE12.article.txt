BARIPADA, India (AF) — As church hells rang
out, lepers led a funeral procession in southeast India
on Monday for the Baptist missionary and his two sons
who were burned to death by a mob over the weekend.
The lepers were among hundreds who paid tribute
to Graham Stuart Staines, who used to dispense drug
treatments from a church-run leprosy clinic, preach
occasionally and lead Bible-study camps.
The procession ended on the edge of town in a
Christian cemetery where Staines' widow and daughter
were the first to throw handfuls of dry, pebbly earth,
which landed with a dull thud on the three wooden
coffins in a common grave.
Police officers with guns slung over their shoulders
were reminders of the string of attacks against Chris
tians in India in the past year. Staines and his two sons
were the first deaths in the recent violence.
Staines, 10-year-old Philips and eight-year-old Tim
othy were killed Saturday by a mob that set fire to their
jeep as they slept during a Bible study camp in remote
Kheonjar district. 110 miles west of Baripada. The area
is 660 miles southeast of New Delhi, the capital.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has con
demned the violence and called for harsh, quick pun
ishment for the attackers.
Police said Monday they had arrested 49 Hindu mil
itants in the killings. The suspects were linked to
Bajrang Dal, a group affiliated with the right-wing
Bharatiya Janata Party that governs India.
The Bajrang Dal denied its activists were involved in
the killings. However, it and affiliated Hindu militant
groups have been accused in other recent attacks
against Christians in India.
Most of the attacks have occurred in the western
state of Gujarat, where at least 12 Christian churches
and 24 Hindu temples have been damaged in the last
month after radical Hindus protested that Christian
missionaries were converting tribespeople to their faith.
Christians make up 2 percent of India's 1 billion
population, which is mostly Hindu.
Staines embraced Indian culture and was embraced
in turn in Baripada.
"The way he lived his life has been an inspiration to
us all," said Father Anand Pal, a Catholic priest.
