BONN. Germany (AP) — Germany's
plan to abandon nuclear power hit a snag
Monday when the government announced it
had delayed a decision to ban exports of
spent nuclear fuel.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was con
cerned that Germany might have to pay
compensation if it scraps reprocessing deals
with French and British plants, government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
The delay sent a conciliatory signal to the
power industry a day before utility execu
tives are scheduled to open talks with
Schroeder on a timetable for shutting down
Germany's 19 nuclear plants.
But Schroeder's abrupt reversal threat
ened a fight with his junior coalition partner,
the Greens, who are pushing the anti-nucle
ar agenda in the center-left government that
took power last fall.
Schroeder ordered a three-week review
of a draft law that would ban reprocessing

next Jan. 1. Parliament had been scheduled
to take up the proposal this week. A Cabinet
decision on the law set for Wednesday also
was postponed. Heye said.
"The chancellor had the impression that
there are many open questions" in the law,
Heye said.
Some in the power industry have threat
ened to boycott the talks unless nuclear plant
operators are given another five years to end
reprocessing.
Schroeder previously said he saw no legal
basis for compensation if Germany aban
dons reprocessing contracts running up to
2014. despite the threat of claims totaling
some $7 billion from Britain and France.
His change of mind illustrated the com
plexity of weaning one of the world's most
powerful industrial nations off nuclear
power, including what to do with radioactive
waste if German power plants no longer
reprocess it abroad.
