PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) — Interna
tional officials launched a diplomatic push
today to find a political settlement for Koso
vo, with U.S.-led talks in Pristina and high
level consultations in Brussels.
The chief U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christo
pher Hill, was headed back to the provincial
capital Pristina for a meeting with ethnic
Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
and other Kosovo Albanian leaders. He was
arriving from neighboring Macedonia,
where he is U.S. ambassador.
Hill's previous four proposals calling for
autonomy for the Serbian province have
been rejected by both the Serbian and Alba
nian sides and failed to persuade them to
start long-sought face-to-face negotiations.
But the Jan. 15 massacre of 45 ethnic
Albanians in the village of Racak. which
prompted international outrage, has per
suaded world leaders to put additional pres
sure on both sides to end the year-old con
flict before it erupts in new province-wide
fighting in the spring.
The six-nation Balkan Contact Group
decided in London on Friday to launch a

new effort to get ethnic Albanian rebels and
moderate political factions to unify their
negotiating positions as a key step toward
negotiations. Hill planned to outline the
Contact Group initiative to them, a
spokesman said.
In Brussels today, European Union for
eign ministers focused on Kosovo at their
regular meeting.
"We want to stop the breaches in the
cease-fire and we want to avoid the potential
of future atrocities," said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, adding that he would
seek the backing of his EU colleagues for a
new political plan. "We have got to get the
momentum back onto the political track."
A ministerial meeting of the Contact
Group—Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States — is expected
by week's end, possibly in London, to follow
up on the push for a political settlement.
Ambassadors from the 16 NATO nations
were to meet later today in the Belgian capi
tal to continue work on a two-level plan of
threatening airstrikes while looking for a
diplomatic solution.
