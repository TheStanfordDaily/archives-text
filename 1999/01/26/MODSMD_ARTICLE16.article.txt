Palo Alto loitering solution
addresses tough problems
with easy, inhumane answer

TO ADDRESS WIIA I it claims are
significant dangers to pedestrians
and motorists, the Palo Alto City
Council is proposing a law to ban loitering
on Palo Alto street medians and in the
Stanford Shopping C enter parking lots.
Because the law specifically targets panhan
dlers and solicitors, however, we find it hard
to see the proposal as anything other than a
convenient maneuver to "clean up" the
neighborhood.
Council members explained that the
proposal does not target the homeless but
only attempts to curb the frequency of
near-accidents caused by distracted drivers.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino cited his
concern for the loiterers in particular. "The
folks soliciting are in danger of being hit,"
he told the San Francisco Chronicle. "I
have seen a number of near misses between
motorists ... because of individuals stand
ing there, holding signs."
It seems that an easier way to prevent
"near misses" would be to ask drivers to
take more care on the road. Instead, the city
council would be asking "distracting" peo
ple to pack up and take their livelihoods
elsewhere. Perhaps the council should ban
all "distracting" wildlife from crossing the
road, too.
While Stanford's official response to the
proposal is that it has "no opinion," we feel

that as a part of the community we have a
responsibility to voice our concerns.
The city council proposal falls in line
with bans in Santa Clara, San Jose, Moun
tain View and many other communities
that have turned to hiding the problems of
poor through bans on loitering, sitting and
lying in public sidewalks. In IWS, Berkeley
was one of the few communities that
repealed its "pedestrian facilitation" laws.
It's no wonder that so many us opt for the
relaxed, real-world streets of Berkeley over
the guarded pavement of University
Avenue.
Imagine if every city across the country
were to implement both a sit-lie ban and
soliciting ban. With nowhere to sit, stand,
lie or live, the homeless and destitute would
be faced with the prospect of breaking the
law or moving out of the cities. Perhaps
these laws intend to shuttle the ugly face of
poverty into the anonymity ol rural hills. If
this is so. the effects of these laws would be
as impractical as they are inhumane.
Ihc panhandlers are not seeking the
unconditional light to rely on charity for
sustenance, flits is hardly an issue of First
Amendment rights. Rather, it indicates our
tendency to put Band-Aids over wounds
with much deeper causes. It challenges us to
direct our energy away from superficial
problems towards our most painful ones.
As one council member pointed out.
under this law even Boy Scouts selling
( hristmas wreaths will be banned. It is clear
that while the Boy Scouts will be able to sell
their tokens to the lawyers in their parents'
offices, the panhandlers will have nowhere
to go but prison.
