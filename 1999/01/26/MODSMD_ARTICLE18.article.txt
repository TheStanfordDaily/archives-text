Cal deserves credit
WILL FLEMMING'S ARTICLE in the
Jan. I 1 ) Stanford Daily. "Outclassed Bruins,"
says it all. Of course the students, alumni,
and athletic department on the Farm look
down on the citizens of California and their
universities. Art Lee is quoted in the L.A.
limes saying, "They hate us." What does he
expect.?
I have been to many basketball games in
Maples with my father, and the UCLA or
Berkeley teams are always treated with arro
gance and contempt by the Stanford fans and
their Sixth Man Club. I hev are always
booed and jeered at by the Stanford fans as
they enter the court, or taunted by Stanford's
announcer.
A few years ago Cal's guard Randy Duck
was treated by taunts from the Sixth Man
Club. "Duck, you suck" over and over. What
was his crime? Was it that he tried to be a

good student and loved his university? Or
the brilliant remarks by Andrew Vlahov
(another Stanford hero). "Most Cal students
are weenies and jealous they didn't get into
Stanford." You would think Mike Mont
gomery ;is the host coach could convince his
rooting section to give the visiting Golden
Bears the dignity and respect they deserve,
but Montgomery is either unwilling or indif
ferent.
The University of California at Berkeley
was the first public university in America to
have its graduate schools rated equal or bet
ter than Harvard under the leadership of
President Clark Kerr. When Stanford
physics and chemistry students open their
texbooks and read about the elements
Berkelium and Californium, maybe they
should contemplate a little whom those ele
ments are named for.
