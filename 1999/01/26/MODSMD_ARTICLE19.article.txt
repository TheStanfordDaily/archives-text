## To all those I picked on: I'm sorry 
### 
Friends, literates.
Daily patrons, lend
me your beers (I
don't drink, hut I could be
like Robin Hood and give
them to the homeless).
This is my last column.
The Daily, like an inferior

school across the Bay, works on a semester
system and my semester is up. I'd hate to
leave some of you with a sour taste in your
mouths (even if it's from a grape), so I'd like
to say a quick apology to those I've had tun
with these past two quarters.
First, I'm sorry to all who were upset
enough to write letters. Little do you know
that it makes my day, but you're obviously
unbalanced on the mental end (I don't
know about the other end. since I have no
information on your fiber intake, etc.), so
don't take offense. Regardless of how seri
ous some issues are, "serious hat" can be
traded for "funny hat" every now and then.
Hut really, it is wonderful to hear others'
opinions.
Second, I'd like to apologize to the post
office. Despite the "we hate you" message
neatly inscribed on all of my mail for over a
month, you persevered, delivering my mail
with a smile on your face and a hand down
your pants.
On a related note, I must say sorry to the
student who was harassed by the postal
workers because he looked like my picture
in the Daily.
Third, I suppose I should rescind my
comments about Fox Sports West. Sure,
they ruined our football season, but we did
beat C'al. And that's all that counts. So
props to Stanford football and the little peo
ple who film the games.

Fourth, I'm sorry for making fun of
Paula Jones. Although I'm pretty sure she
nose I was only kidding. Everybody else
nose, so why wouldn't she? It's not like liv
ing in Arkansas makes you stupid or some
thing.
Fifth, I'm sorry to those people who
don't like grapes. Nice, peaceful, round
green grapes. I think they're friendly, but
whatever.
Just FYI, I think we should extend the
vote to banning tofu. What the hell is tofu?
It's like you think you're about to get a
piece of chicken but then it's not. Screw
you. tofu.
Sixth, niavbe I shouldn't have made fun
of the Schme ... I mean Kappa Sigs.
Despite the pain of having to sleep out, the
week-long line energized this campus in
support of the best basketball team in the
nation. We're going all the way this year.
Seventh, my bad about the whole "blue
poles" column. Apparently I ignored their
value as a prop in dancing routines, at least
according to "Roxxy" in a rather irate e
mail.
Eighth, the meter maids. Yes, I picked
on the meter maids, possibly the easiest tar
get of them all. Liz made me do it.
Ninth. I made fun of Kwanzaa, which,
according to the Kwanzaa Information
Center on the Internet, is the "African-
American spiritual holiday." Since Kwan
zaa is inherently funny, I figure I am only
somewhat to blame. But I'm sorry anyway.
Maybe the next columnists can find a better
way to explain that certain efforts to
empower a segment of the population,
despite being of good intent, indirectly
serve to alienate the rest of society. It's sad,
but it's a fact of life.

Tenth, sorry to all those handicapped
parking spaces. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going
to Hell. I know.
Eleventh, 1 must lament that some of
you who read last week's column took my
advice, called up a girl in a moment of hope
and inspiration, and then were promptly
rejected. Oops.
Twelfth, I'm sorry for messing up the
"Simpsons" line. My brilliant brother Doug
corrected me promptly after reading the
column: "You dumbass, it's 'Karma is por
tioned out by the Cosmos.' "
Thirteenth, I apologize to fat people.
Synergy guys who insist on wearing spandex
in the weight room, that sap Don Lapre
who tries to rip everyone off with his
infomercial on how to rip everyone off.
some of the other columnists, Dan "Sure I
Have a Chance of Winning in 2000"
Quayle, Texans, SLE, the Rev. Jerry Fal
well, 24-hour study room groupies, the
crazy book guy, people who get tickets from
cops on feet for riding a bike without a light
and vegans: I didn't make fun of you, but 1
thought about it a bunch of times.
And finally, I'm not sorry to Kenneth
Starr. Saddam Hussein, Cal and the GSB or
its IM trolls.
Well folks, it's been quite a ride. I've said
some things that maybe shouldn't have
been said, but hopefully it made some peo
ple think, others laugh and faces turn red.
And while I'm sorry if you were offended.
I'm not sorry for what I wrote.
In fact, I wouldn't take back a word of it.
