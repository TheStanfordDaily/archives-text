English Prof. Emeritus Rob Reb

Freshman Leo Feler opened the
meeting by expressing his devotion
to SLE, a sentiment that was echoed
by other students in attendance. He
continued by presenting the SLE
students' concerns about the elimi
nation of part-time faculty and the
quantity of readings.
Elam answered that the students
were misinterpreting information
they had received about the pro-
