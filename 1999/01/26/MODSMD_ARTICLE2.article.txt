## 
### Ryan Kalember Contributing writer 
Responding to a flurry of e-mail
and letters, the Area One Gover
nance Board granted an audience
yesterday morning to nearly 30 stu
dents in Structured Liberal Educa
tion, who raised objections to pro
posed changes in their program.
The board is charged with re
viewing all of the Area One pro
grams, starting with SLE.
The SLE students said they are
concerned about three primary is
sues. First, they oppose any reduc
tion in the number of texts used in
the year-long course. Second, they
do not want the role of part-time
teaching fellows, who lecture and
lead discussion sections, to change.
Finally, they want to maintain the
high level of individual attention of
fered by the SLE writing tutors.
The protesting SLE students

based their questions on informa
tion published in a Jan. 21 Daily ar
ticle, whieh cited board member and
English Prof. Emeritus Rob Reb
holz and SLE lecturer Jon Reider.
Board Chair and Assoc. Drama
Prof. Harry Elam yesterday report
ed to the students that the board was
not yet close to issuing a report rec
ommending any changes in SLE and
that little had been concretely decid
ed.
Freshman Leo Feler opened the
meeting by expressing his devotion
to SLE, a sentiment that was echoed
by other students in attendance. He
continued by presenting the SLE
students' concerns about the elimi
nation of part-time faculty and the
quantity of readings.
Elam answered that the students
were misinterpreting information
they had received about the pro-
According to I lain, the proposal
would require SI I ' section leaders
to become lull time SI \ : employees.
Currently, some fellows hold other
part-time positions outside of the
program.
I-lam and Ramon Saldivar, the
vice provost for undergraduate edu

cation and an ex officio member of
the committee, added that the com
mitlee is leaning toward requiring
fellows to be Kill-time Stanford SI \ :

"My personal stance on the issue
is the more Stanford faculty, the bet
ter," said Saldivar.
Although last week Rcbhol/sug
gested the number ol texts for the
course might change. Main went on
to reassure the students yesterday
that such a change is not likelv.

The way tin its are awarded may
change, he added. Currently, SIT"
fulfills general education require

that the Area I'hree credit may he
replaced by additional Area One
units, since SI T. "is not really a his
tory course."
I'he hoard did not address the
students' concern about changing
the role of SLE writing tutors.

El am referred future questions
on hoard-related matters to
Suzanne (Jreenberg, die SLE pro
gram coordinator and its representa
tive on the Area One Coordinating

"In the end, [the meeting]
seemed more like a massive clarifi
cation than a discussion." said Ryan
Moehner, a SLE freshman. "Hope
fully. as Elam implied, a lot of the is
sues mentioned in the Daily article
aren't on the table."
