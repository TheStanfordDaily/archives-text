THE COMPUTERS HAVE landed
and taken over. Or so we're told.
I hey've devoured our letterboxes,
our bookstores and our telephones.
Worst ol all. they've forced journalists
and aging academicians to use a whole range
ot words from the future such as "cyber" and
"virtual." I he best one is "information super
highway." three words which, when placed
together, mean absolutely nothing (and why
in that order? Why not "super highway infor
mation" or "highway information super"?).
II there is one proof that people don't think
clearly about the current advances in com
puter technology it's that three-word phrase.
For example, either journalists make a
bad pun ("We're trying to design a scenic
stop along the information super highway,"
Business magazine. 1994). or they mix their
metaphors atrociously: "For those who find
it thirsty work surfing on the information
super highway ..Sunday Telegraph. Aug.
20. 1995. Finally, some just pretend to talk
about computers when clearly all they're
actually discussing is roads: "The tank is full,
the motor is purring, and the nation is ready
to go roaring down the information super

highway. Trouble is. there's no road map,"
the Baltimore Sun. Feb. 5,19%.
Journalists would have us believe that
computers are changing society. The use of
all these new words gives off the flavor of a
brand-new era. I'm not so convinced.
And what of the "virtual office" that
apparently beckons from the future? Colum
nists worry and fret about the individual who
can work from home, shop from home, sleep
at home — infinitely connected and equally
lonely. Yet it's too late to worry now. The
isolation has nothing to do with the Internet.
The shopping mall was never, after all, a
real experience. The whole point to it was to
enable suburbia to go shopping without ever
having to encounter poverty or any other
inconvenience. Children couldn't play in the
malls, but they could spend money. Air-con
ditioned. quiet, no running, no spitting, no
sitting, no begging, one of those suburban
dreams that to the rational mind is Hell with
out the excitement. This was willful isolation
long before the Web's invention.
Those who worry about the Internet
never raised a finger against the develop
ment of the rat's maze of office cubicles that

currently disorganize modern life. Even
worse is the 1950s version of the office,
shown in Orson Welles' "The Trial" or Billy
Wilder's " The Apartment." rows of desks all
positioned in the same direction, workers
never able to lix>k at each other, all staring at
the blank wall they face. Computers did not
achieve this. All it took was the will to make
computers out of people.
During the summer after I graduated
from high school I worked in a factory mak
ing kettle switches. Actually I didn't make
them. 1 tested them. In fact, to tell the truth.
I didn't test them either. What I did was sit
on the end of an assembly line, pick up
palettes of switches roughly every 10 sec
onds. move them one foot to my left and feed
them into the testing machine. That was all I
did. I did it for eight and a half hours a day.
The only way to survive such things is to
numb yourself. Never look at your watch.
Don't even bother to try and make time pass
because it won't. Shut yourself down and
some day tea break will come. Don't think
and don't feel.
St) we shouldn't really worry ttxi much
about computers changing our lives. Com

puters can't do much harm to you when they
still need you to switch them on. It's the
humans 1 worry about. ITiey're the ones
making all the changes.
It is commonly held that the Industrial
Revolution was the fault of machines. You
learn about these mechanical villains which
all had bizarre names like The Spinning
Jenny. The Whirling Kenneth or The Jump
ing Benjamin which were capable of things
like spinning yarn and counting string. Obvi
ously, history says, in the face of such effi
cient string-counting, people had no choice
but to suddenly become modern.
Official type: I'm sorry, sir. but we've just
found out that you'll have to move to the city.
You and your family will live in a single room
with your own filth, another family, and its
filth.
Rural type: [surprised] Why? This is all
very unexpected.
Official type: Because The Thumping
Michael has just been invented.
Rural type: Oh. I see. Well, if The
Thumping Michael has just been invented ...
C'mon kids, we're all moving to the city to be
miserable.

Kids; Why?
Rural type: So that you can contract
cholera.
kids: Hooray!
The idea is that society had no control
over what it invented and, once something
had been invented, had no choice but to
apply it in a certain way. Don't blame us, say
the architects of the factory, technology
made us do it.
To blame the changes in our society on
the Internet is misguided. Along the same
lines Judas Iscariot might as well complain:
"If only we had never invented wood and
nails, then our savior would not have been
crucified by these horrible technological
advances."
Technology doesn't control us. We con
trol it. And if we don't like what computers
are doing to our lives we should reform our
selves, not our machines. The torturer is
never simply the product of the latest tortur
ing techniques.

I didn't test them either. What I did was sit
on the end of an assembly line, pick up
palettes of switches roughly every 10 sec
onds. move them one foot to my left and feed
them into the testing machine. That was all I
did. I did it for eight and a half hours a day.
The only way to survive such things is to
numb yourself. Never look at your watch.
Don't even bother to try and make time pass
because it won't. Shut yourself down and
some day tea break will come. Don't think
and don't feel.
St) we shouldn't really worry ttxi much
about computers changing our lives. Com

puters can't do much harm to you when they
still need you to switch them on. It's the
humans 1 worry about. ITiey're the ones
making all the changes.
It is commonly held that the Industrial
Revolution was the fault of machines. You
learn about these mechanical villains which
all had bizarre names like The Spinning
Jenny. The Whirling Kenneth or The Jump
ing Benjamin which were capable of things
like spinning yarn and counting string. Obvi
ously, history says, in the face of such effi
cient string-counting, people had no choice
but to suddenly become modern.
Official type: I'm sorry, sir. but we've just
found out that you'll have to move to the city.
You and your family will live in a single room
with your own filth, another family, and its
filth.
Rural type: [surprised] Why? This is all
very unexpected.
Official type: Because The Thumping
Michael has just been invented.
Rural type: Oh. I see. Well, if The
Thumping Michael has just been invented ...
C'mon kids, we're all moving to the city to be
miserable.

Kids; Why?
Rural type: So that you can contract
cholera.
kids: Hooray!
The idea is that society had no control
over what it invented and, once something
had been invented, had no choice but to
apply it in a certain way. Don't blame us, say
the architects of the factory, technology
made us do it.
To blame the changes in our society on
the Internet is misguided. Along the same
lines Judas Iscariot might as well complain:
"If only we had never invented wood and
nails, then our savior would not have been
crucified by these horrible technological
advances."
Technology doesn't control us. We con
trol it. And if we don't like what computers
are doing to our lives we should reform our
selves, not our machines. The torturer is
never simply the product of the latest tortur
ing techniques.
