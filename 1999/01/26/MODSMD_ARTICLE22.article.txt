## BASEBALL. SEASON PREVIEW Model of consistency Despite change and loss, Stanford baseball still among elite 
### Jonathan Stull Contributing writer 
In a season full of change for
the Stanford baseball team and
college baseball in general, the
Cardinal somehow finds itself in a
most familiar position as one of
the best teams in the nation.
College baseball will feature
three striking changes this season.
Teams will be playing with

smaller, heavier bats; more teams
will be playing in the NCAA post
season tournament and the Pacific
10 Conference's North and South
Divisions will merge this year,
doing away with the vaunted Six-
Pac.
Amid all these changes and de
spite losing its top three pitchers
from last year's powerhouse, Stan
ford begins the season, once again,
ranked in the top 10 of all three na

tional polls and. as usual, with
sights on the College World Se
ries.
"As always, we'd like to win the
Pac-10, host a regional and get to
the World Series," said junior first
baseman John Gall.
Stanford's high preseason
ranking is mostly because of its re
turning offensive firepower. How
ever. Stanford's lack of pitching
experience makes the season es

pecially intriguing.
"The biggest question mark we
have has to do with our pitching,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"We lost Jeff Austin. [Ail-Ameri
can | Chad Hutchinson and Brett
Hoard — that's almost two-thirds
of all our innings pitched last year.
How do you replace that? It's al
most impossible."
For Stanford to have a success
ful season, someone will have to
try.
Sophomore Justin Wayne will
be taking over Austin's role as the
Cardinal's top starting pitcher.
Wayne, named a Freshman Ail-
American, went 6-0 with six saves
and a 3.78 ERA out of the bullpen.
Sophomore Jason Young, who
appeared in relief in 15 games last
year, will probably be the No. 2
pitcher in the Cardinal rotation.
The No. 3 starter is still largely
up in the air. Sophomore Brad
Drew, freshman Mike Gosling, ju
nior Geoff Linville and freshman
Brian Sager will all compete for
the position, although many say
Gosling will be No. 3 by the end of
the season.
"All these players are talented,
but they just haven't pitched that
much," Marquess said. "You
never know how they're going to
perform.
"The one area of our pitching
staff that's pretty solid is our
bullpen. They are the strength of
our staff."
Senior Tony Cogan, a left-han
der, and junior Austin Coose, a
right-hander, will share the clos
er's job and offer Marquess many
options at the end of close games.
Coose appeared in 24 games, strik
ing out 31 while posting only a 1.78
E ; .RA. Cogan recorded three saves
in 23 appearances while posting a
4.05 ERA.
If the Cardinal pitching suc
cumbs to its inexperience, the of
fense, especially Gall and senior
third baseman Josh Hochgesang,
will have to live up to its advance
billing.
"Our offense is solid." Mar
quess said. "I think we'll hit for
power. I think we'll hit for aver

age. But, 1 just don't know how
many darn runs we're going to
need to score to win games be
cause of our pitching and the de
fense up the middle."
Gall, already Stanford's all
time leading hitter with a .378 ca
reer average, was named a Base

much of the enthusiasm surround
ing him has to do with his summer
performance for Team USA. He
batted .371 and led the national
team with 52 hits, 37 RBI and 15
doubles.
"Gall is a lot like [former Stan

lord major-leaguer] Mike Aldrete;
he's a natural hitter," Marquess
said. "He's just one of those gifted
guys who's going to get his hits.
"The exciting thing is he's start

Junior Edmund Muth, also a
Second-Team Ail-American, will

dropped off slightly last year from a

However, Muth's biggest influ

makes the move from left field to

standout Jodv Cierut. Few of the
Cardinal players have any experi

that position for the team's last 182

Muth's defense will be crucial,
though, because the Cardinal is very
inexperienced up the middle. Three
year starting shortstop Jay Pecci and
two-year starting second baseman
Tony Schrager both left in the Major
League Baseball draft, leaving the
middle infield questionable.
"They say the strength of [a]

Junior Edmund Muth, also a
Second-Team Ail-American, will
also be relied upon to spur the of

Although Muth's numbers
dropped off slightly last year from a
prodigious freshman season, his
play last summer in the Cape Cod
League was outstanding. Muth vv;is
near the top of the league in home
runs, RBIs. runs scored and extra
base hits.
However, Muth's biggest influ
ence could be on defense. He
makes the move from left field to
center field this season, replacing

standout Jodv Cierut. Few of the
Cardinal players have any experi
ence in center field as (ierut started
that position for the team's last 182
games.
Muth's defense will be crucial,
though, because the Cardinal is very
inexperienced up the middle. Three
year starting shortstop Jay Pecci and
two-year starting second baseman
Tony Schrager both left in the Major
League Baseball draft, leaving the
middle infield questionable.
"They say the strength of [a]
baseball [team] is up the middle,
but those are my question marks,"
Marquess said.
In a season full of change for
the Stanford baseball team and
college baseball in general, the
Cardinal somehow finds itself in a
most familiar position as one of
the best teams in the nation.
College baseball will feature
three striking changes this season.
Teams will be playing with

smaller, heavier bats; more teams
will be playing in the NCAA post
season tournament and the Pacific
10 Conference's North and South
Divisions will merge this year,
doing away with the vaunted Six-
Pac.
Amid all these changes and de
spite losing its top three pitchers
from last year's powerhouse, Stan
ford begins the season, once again,
ranked in the top 10 of all three na

tional polls and. as usual, with
sights on the College World Se
ries.
"As always, we'd like to win the
Pac-10, host a regional and get to
the World Series," said junior first
baseman John Gall.
Stanford's high preseason
ranking is mostly because of its re
turning offensive firepower. How
ever. Stanford's lack of pitching
experience makes the season es

pecially intriguing.
"The biggest question mark we
have has to do with our pitching,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"We lost Jeff Austin. [Ail-Ameri
can | Chad Hutchinson and Brett
Hoard — that's almost two-thirds
of all our innings pitched last year.
How do you replace that? It's al
most impossible."
For Stanford to have a success
ful season, someone will have to
try.
Sophomore Justin Wayne will
be taking over Austin's role as the
Cardinal's top starting pitcher.
Wayne, named a Freshman Ail-
American, went 6-0 with six saves
and a 3.78 ERA out of the bullpen.
Sophomore Jason Young, who
appeared in relief in 15 games last
year, will probably be the No. 2
pitcher in the Cardinal rotation.
The No. 3 starter is still largely
up in the air. Sophomore Brad
Drew, freshman Mike Gosling, ju
nior Geoff Linville and freshman
Brian Sager will all compete for
the position, although many say
Gosling will be No. 3 by the end of
the season.
"All these players are talented,
but they just haven't pitched that
much," Marquess said. "You
never know how they're going to
perform.
"The one area of our pitching
staff that's pretty solid is our
bullpen. They are the strength of
our staff."
Senior Tony Cogan, a left-han
der, and junior Austin Coose, a
right-hander, will share the clos
er's job and offer Marquess many
options at the end of close games.
Coose appeared in 24 games, strik
ing out 31 while posting only a 1.78
E ; .RA. Cogan recorded three saves
in 23 appearances while posting a
4.05 ERA.
If the Cardinal pitching suc
cumbs to its inexperience, the of
fense, especially Gall and senior
third baseman Josh Hochgesang,
will have to live up to its advance
billing.
"Our offense is solid." Mar
quess said. "I think we'll hit for
power. I think we'll hit for aver

age. But, 1 just don't know how
many darn runs we're going to
need to score to win games be
cause of our pitching and the de
fense up the middle."
Gall, already Stanford's all
time leading hitter with a .378 ca
reer average, was named a Base
ball America First-Team Presea
son Ail-American.
Although Gall had an out
standing 1998 season, hitting .381
with 15 home runs and 63 RBls.
much of the enthusiasm surround
ing him has to do with his summer
performance for Team USA. He
batted .371 and led the national
team with 52 hits, 37 RBI and 15
doubles.
"Gall is a lot like [former Stan

lord major-leaguer] Mike Aldrete;
he's a natural hitter," Marquess
said. "He's just one of those gifted
guys who's going to get his hits.
"The exciting thing is he's start
ing to hit for some power."
