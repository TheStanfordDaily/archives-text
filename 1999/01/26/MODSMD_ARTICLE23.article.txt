Arthur Lee
Lee has more clutch moments than Elizabeth Taylor has ex
husbands. He added to his collection with his pull-up three
pointer to ice a Cardinal victory against Washington last Satur
day in Maples Pavilion. As if giving the Cardinal a late six-point
lead weren't enough. Lee stole the ball on the Huskies' ensuing
possession. Four late free throws scaled the deal.

Misty Ifyman
Hyman can't he considered clutch simply because when she's in
a race, there's nut much doubt of the outcome. The reigning
NCAA Swimmer of the Year swept all of her events over a
weekend trip to Arizona as the Cardinal had to deal with sev
eral key swimmers staying at home fighting off sickness. Stan
ford split its two meets, but Hyman dominated thoroughly.
