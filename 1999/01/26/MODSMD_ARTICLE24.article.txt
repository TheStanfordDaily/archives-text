# Just a Bit Outside

So this is it. My last week as sports
editor.
I've got to say, this job changes the
way one looks at things. You don't
see just a game, you see a story. There
is no cheering, no unprofessional
chants, no rushing the field. There is
no wearing a backwards baseball cap
at a game and there is no doing the
wave.

And vet. it is more than worth it.
The Stanford Daily has allowed
me to meet some phenomenal peo
ple and witness some phenomenal
events. It is impossible to get tired of
watching Arthur Lee nail a three
pointer is some poor opponent's face
to nail a game.
Hut the Daily provides opportuni
ties to see more than just outstanding
athletes. It gives you the chance to
meet outstanding people.
Before editor. I was a baseball
boy. One of my favorite sports as a

child. I pushed to be the baseball beat
writer last year as a Daily staff writer.
College baseball is very underrated,
and 1 wanted to help change this.
Covering Stanford's top-ranked
baseball program last season, it was
on the road, one weekend in Tucson,
where 1 met one of those outstanding
people.
The sunsets in Arizona are beau
tiful and while I had never seen them
prior to that night. 1 had heard the
rave reviews. There was no denying
their truth. As we shuttled from the
airport to the hotel during the early
evening, each and every baseball
player was in awe. The orange sky
served as a fantastic background for
the green cacti that lined the kxral
streets.
The members of this traveling
party were certainly not foreign to
me. I had been on road trips with this
team before and felt comfortable
with most of the group. There were
the players, student managers,
coaches, baseball secretary Kathy
Wolff. Media Relations Assistant
Director Scott Leykam and Market
ing guru Alain Lillie. This time, how
ever. there was one new edition to
the posse.
Then-Associate Director of Un-


Brian
Eule
dergraduate Admissions John Bun
nell.
I had seen the man speak before
and I had certainly heard about him
and his entertaining stories, but I had
never met him.
"Go talk to him. Brian" Leykam
joked. "Find out how the heck you
got in to this school."
After the laughter died down, 1

did go over to Bunnell and I did talk
to him. And while I didn't ask him
how 1 was accepted into Stanford
University (I was afraid he would
reply, "()li shoot. I knew we let one
slip that year!"), I did ask him about
almost everything else.
The man is Stanford.
He got his undergraduate degree
from Stanford, 1 le got his MBA from
Stanford. He even got his masters in
education from Stanford, and he
spent the last 35 years going from
high school to high school preaching

Stanford's greatness. He loved this
place so much, he got a house nearby
and biked to work every day.
When it rained, he wore a poncho.
And while he brought his work
with him. Bunnell was definitely on
this trip to watch baseball and share
some time with his good friend, head
coach Mark Marquess.
That weekend, 1 learned that Bun
nell had been a big part of Stanford
sports for many years. He had coin
cided his speaking engagements in
various cities with some of Stanford's

road trips so that he would often have
the opportunity to see the Cardinal
on the road.
I still keep in touch with Bunnell.
It gives me energy to see a man who
loves his work so much.
This year, however. Bunnell was
given just a few months notice that,
after 35 years of admitting Stanford
students, lie would be let go.
Stanford seems to be a special
place and Bunnell was a special part
of it. So how. after so many years,
after so much work, could Stanford

get rid of one of its own?
On Friday night. Stanford base
ball will begin a new season with its
own version of opening day, fire
works and all.
I plan on being there â€” wearing a
backwards baseball cap and doing the
wave.
1 wish Bunnell would be there too.

Sports editor Brian Eule's would like
to thank his very talented writers and
co-editor for making this volume a
special experience.
