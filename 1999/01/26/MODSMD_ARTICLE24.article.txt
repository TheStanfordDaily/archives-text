So this is it. My last week as sports
editor.
I've got to say, this job changes the
way one looks at things. You don't
see just a game, you see a story. There
is no cheering, no unprofessional
chants, no rushing the field. There is
no wearing a backwards baseball cap
at a game and there is no doing the
wave.

And vet. it is more than worth it.
The Stanford Daily has allowed
me to meet some phenomenal peo
ple and witness some phenomenal
events. It is impossible to get tired of
watching Arthur Lee nail a three
pointer is some poor opponent's face
to nail a game.
Hut the Daily provides opportuni
ties to see more than just outstanding
athletes. It gives you the chance to
meet outstanding people.
Before editor. I was a baseball
boy. One of my favorite sports as a

child. I pushed to be the baseball beat
writer last year as a Daily staff writer.
College baseball is very underrated,
and 1 wanted to help change this.
Covering Stanford's top-ranked
baseball program last season, it was
on the road, one weekend in Tucson,
where 1 met one of those outstanding
people.
The sunsets in Arizona are beau
tiful and while I had never seen them
prior to that night. 1 had heard the
rave reviews. There was no denying
their truth. As we shuttled from the
airport to the hotel during the early
evening, each and every baseball
player was in awe. The orange sky
served as a fantastic background for
the green cacti that lined the kxral
streets.
The members of this traveling
party were certainly not foreign to
me. I had been on road trips with this
team before and felt comfortable
with most of the group. There were
the players, student managers,
coaches, baseball secretary Kathy
Wolff. Media Relations Assistant
Director Scott Leykam and Market
ing guru Alain Lillie. This time, how
ever. there was one new edition to
the posse.
